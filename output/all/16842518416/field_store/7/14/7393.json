I hope the Alpine natives don't take it into their heads to come up herre afterr any of 'em just now. I just rooted around in the mud and got 'em. Look at my hand, will you?\"  They made a sumptuous repast of wet, crisp chicory roots and \"pearrl-bearing mussels\" as Archer insisted upon calling them, although they found no pearls. The meal was refreshing and not half bad. There was a pleasant air of stealth and cosiness about the whole thing, lying there in their leafy refuge in the edge of the woods with the Alsatian country stretched below them. Perhaps it was the mussels out of the geography (to quote Archer's own phrase) as well as the sense of security which came as the uneventful hours passed, but as the twilight gathered they enjoyed a feeling of safety, and their hope ran high. They had found, as the scout usually finds, that Nature was their friend, never withholding her bounty from him who seeks and uses his resourcefulness and brains.  All through the long afternoon they could distinguish heavy army wagons with dark spots on their canvas sides (the flaring, arrogant German crest which allied soldiers had grown to despise) moving northward along the distant road. They looked almost like toy wagons. Sometimes, when the breeze favored, they could hear the rattle of wheels and occasionally a human voice was faintly audible. And all the while from those towering heights beyond came the spent, muffled booming.  \"I'd like to know just what's going on over there,\" Tom said as he gazed at the blue heights. \"Maybe those wagons down there on the road have something to do with it. If there's a big battle going on they may be bringing back wounded and prisoners.--Some of our own fellers might be in 'em.\"  They tried to determine about where, along that far-flung line, the sounds arose, but they could only guess at it.  \"All I know is what I hearrd 'em say in the prison camp,\" said Archer; \"that our fellers are just the otherr side of the mountains.\"  \"That would be Nancy,\" said Tom thoughtfully.  \"That Loquet feller that got capturred in a raid,\" Archer said, \"told me the Americans were all around therre, just the otherr side of the mountains--in a lot of differrent villages: When they get through training they send 'em ahead to the trenches. Some of 'em have been in raids already, he said.\"  \"You have to run like everything in a raid,\" said Tom. \"I'd like to be in one, wouldn't you?\"  \"Depends on which way I was running.--Let's have a look at these paperrs before it gets too darrk, hey?\" he added, hauling from his pocket the papers which he had taken from the dead Boche. \"I neverr thought about 'em till just now?\"  \"I thought about it,\" said Tom, who indeed seldom forgot anything, \"but I didn't say anything about it 'cause it kind of makes me think about what happened--I mean how they took her away,\" he added, in his dull way.  For a minute they sat silently gazing down at the vineyard which was now touched with the first crimson rays of sunset.  \"You can just see the chimney,\" Tom said; \"see, just left of that big tree.--I hope I don't see Frenchy any more now 'cause I wouldn't like to have to tell him----\"  \"We don't know what happened,\" said Archer. \"Maybe therre werren't any otherr soldierrs; she may have escaped--and her motherr, too.\"  \"It's more likely there _were_ others, though,\" said Tom. \"I keep thinking all the time how scared she was and it kind of----\"  \"Let's look at the papers,\" said Archer.  The German soldier must have been a typical Boche, for he carried with him the customary baggage of written and statistical matter with which these warriors sally forth to battle.  \"He must o' been a walking correspondence school,\" said Archer, unfolding the contents of the parchment envelope. \"Herre's a list--all in German. Herre's some poetry--or I s'pose it's poetry, 'cause it's printed all in and out.\"  \"Maybe it's a hymn of hate,\" said Tom.  \"Herre's a map, and herre's a letter. All in Gerrman--even the map. Anyway, I can't understand it.\"  \"Looks like a scout astronomy chart,\" said Tom. \"It's all dots like the big dipper.\"  \"Do you s'pose it means they're going to conquer the sky and all the starrs and everything?\" Archer asked. \"Here's a letter, it's dated about two weeks ago--I can make out the numbers all right.\"  The letter was in German, of course, and Archer, who during his long incarceration in the prison camp had picked up a few scraps of the language, fell to trying to decipher it. The only reward he had for his pains was a familiar word which he was able to distinguish here and there and which greatly increased their desire to know the full purport of the letter.  \"Herre's President Wilson's name.--See!\" said Archer excitedly. \"And herre's _America_----\"  \"Yes, and there it is again,\" said Tom. \"That must be _Yankees_, see? Something or other Yankees. It's about a mile long.\"  \"Jim-min-nitty!\" said Archer, staring at the word (presumably a disparaging adjective) which preceded the word _Yankees_. \"It's got one--two--three--wait a minute--it's got thirty-seven letters to it. _Go-o-od night_!\"  \"And that must be Arracourt,\" said Tom. \"I heard about that place--it ain't so far from Nancy. Gee, I wish we could read that letter!\"  \"I'd like to know what kind of a Yankee a b-l-o-e----\"  But Archer gave it up in despair.     CHAPTER XI  THE SCOUT THROUGH ALSACE   As soon as it was dark they started southward, following the ridge. Their way took them up hill and down dale, through rugged uplands where they had to travel five miles to advance three, picking their way over the trackless, rocky heights which formed the first foothills of the mighty Alps.  \"S'pose we should meet some one?\" Archer suggested, as he followed Tom's lead over the rocky ledges.  \"Not up here,\" said Tom. \"You can see lights way off south and maybe we'll have to pass through some villages tomorrow night, but not tonight. We'll only do about twelve miles tonight if it keeps up like this.\"  \"S'pose somebody should see us--when we'rre going through a village? We'll tell him we'rre herre to back the Kaiser, hey?\"  \"S'pose he's a Frenchman that belongs in Alsace,\" Tom queried.  \"Then we'll add on _out o' France_. We'll say--look out for that rock!--We'll just say we'rre herre to back the Kaiser, and if he looks sourr we'll say; _out o' France. Back the Kaiser out o' France_. We win either way, see? A fellerr in prison told me General Perrshing wants a lot of men with glass eyes--to peel onions. Look out you don't trip on that root! Herre's anotherr. If you'rre under sixteen what part of the arrmy do they put you in? The infantry, of course. Herre's----\"  \"Never mind,\" laughed Tom. \"Look where you're stepping.\"  \"What I'm worrying about now,\" said Archer, his spirits mounting as they made their way southward, \"is how we're going to cross the frontierr when we get to it. They've got a big tangled fence of barrbed wirre all along, even across the mountains, to where the battleline cuts in. And it's got a good juicy electric current running through it all the time. If you just touch it--good night!\"  \"I got an idea,\" said Tom simply.  \"If I could get a piece of that electrified wirre for a souveneerr,\" mused Archer, \"I'd----\"  \"You'll have a broken head for a souvenir in a minute,\" said Tom, \"if you don't watch where you're going.\"  \"Gee, you've got eyes in your feet,\" said Archer admiringly.  \"Whenever you see a fallen tree,\" said Tom, \"look out for holes. It means the earth is thin and weak all around and couldn't hold the roots.\"  \"It ought to drink buttermilk, hey?\" said Archer flippantly, \"if it's thin and pale.\"  \"I said thin and weak,\" said Tom. \"Do you ever get tired talking?\"  \"Sure--same as a phonograph record does.\"  So they plodded on, encircling areas of towering rock or surmounting them when they were not too high, and always working southward. Tom, who was not unaccustomed to woods and mountains, thought he had never before traversed such a chaotic wilderness. He would have given a good deal for a watch and for some means of knowing how much actual distance they were covering. It was slow, tiresome work.  Every little while he would check their course by the little compass, to see which he often had to light one of their few precious matches.  \"One thing surre, we won't meet anybody up herre,\" said Archer, as he scrambled along. \"See those little lights over to the east?\"  \"Don't worry,\" said Tom, \"that's twenty miles away. We're all right up here. There were some lights further down too and one over that way but I can't see them now. I guess it's after midnight. Sh-h-h. Listen!\"  They stood stark still, Archer gripping Tom's arm.  \"It's water trickling,\" said Tom dully.  \"Gee, you had the life scared out of me!\" breathed Archer.  A little farther on they came to an abrupt, rocky declivity which crossed their course and in the bottom of which was a swift running stream.  \"It's running east,\" said Tom, listening intently. \"I can tell by the ripples.\"  \"Yes, you can!\" said Archer contemptuously.  \"Sure I can,\" Tom answered. He held his hand first to his right ear, then to his left. \"The long, washy sound comes first when you close your left ear, so I know the water's flowing that way. It's easy,\" he added.  They kept along the precipitous brink, searching for a place to descend and at last scrambled down and into the shallow stream.  \"Didn't I tell you so?\" said Tom, laying a twig in the water and watching it as best he could in the dim light. \"What's on the east of Alsace, anyway?\"  \"Another parrt of Gerrmany--Baden,\" Archer answered.  \"I was wondering where this stream goes,\" Tom said; \"let's walk along in it a little way and go up at a different place. They can't track you in the water.\"  \"I bet _you_ could,\" said Archer admiringly.  \"Let's have a drink and give me a couple of those chicory roots, and I'll show you something,\" Tom said.  From each chicory root he cut a plug such as one cuts to test the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18954"],["title","Tom Slade with the Boys Over There (#8)"],["body","of a watermelon. Then he soaked the roots in the stream. \"The inside's softer than the outside,\" he said, \"and it holds the water.\" After a few moments he replaced the plugs. \"Even tomorrow,\" he added, \"they'll be fresh and cool and they'll quench your thirst. Carrots are best but we haven't got any carrots.\"  About fifty yards down stream they turned out of it and scrambled up a less abrupt hillside and into an area of more or less orderly forest.  \"Maybe it's the Black Forest,\" said Archer; \"anyway it's black enough. Look around and you'll probably see some toys--jumping-jacks and things. 'Most all the toys like that arre made in the Black Forest.\"  \"Not here,\" said Tom; \"we won't find anybody in here.\"  They were indeed entering the less densely wooded region which formed the extreme northern reaches of that mountainous wilderness famed in song and story as the Black Forest. Even here, where it fizzled out on the eastern edge of Alsace, the world-renowned fragrance of its dark and stately fir trees was wafted to them out of the wild and solemn recesses they were approaching.  \"I wish I had a map,\" said Tom.  \"We ought to be thankful we've got the compass. If this _is_ the Black Forest, you can bet I'm going to get a sooveneer. Gee, isn't it dark! It smells good though, believe _me_.\"  They passed on now over land comparatively level, the soft, fragrant needles yielding under their feet, the tall cone-like trees diffusing their resiny, pungent odor. It seemed as if the war must be millions of miles away. The silence was deathlike and the occasional crunching of a cone under their feet startled them as they groped their way in the heavy darkness.  \"That looks like an oak ahead,\" said Archer. \"You can see the branches sticking out----\"  \"Sh-h-h,\" said Tom, grasping his arm suddenly and speaking in a tense whisper. \"Look--right under it--don't move----\"  Archer looked intently and under the low spreading branches he saw a human form with something shiny upon its head. As the two boys paused, awestruck and shaking, it moved ever so slightly.  The fugitives stood rooted to the ground, breathing in quick, short gasps, their hearts pounding in their breasts.  \"He didn't see us,\" whispered Tom, in the faintest whisper. \"Wait till there's a breeze and get behind a tree.\"  When presently the breeze rustled in the tress the two moved cautiously behind two trees.  And the silent figure moved also....  [Illustration: \"SH-H-H.\" SAID TOM IN A TENSE WHISPER. \"LOOK--DON'T MOVE.\" Page 78]     CHAPTER XII  THE DANCE WITH DEATH   The boys were thoroughly frightened, but they stood absolutely motionless and silent and Tom, at least, retained his presence of mind. They were not close enough together to communicate with each other, nor could they more than distinguish each other's forms pressed against the dark tree trunks.  But the figure, being comparatively in the open, was discernible and Tom, by concentrating his eyes upon it, satisfied himself beyond a doubt that it was a human form--that of a German soldier, he felt sure.  Thanks to his stealth and dexterity, they were apparently undiscovered. He tried to distinguish the bright spot on the cap or helmet, but it was not visible now, and he thought the man must have turned about.  In his alarm it seemed to him that his breathing must be audible miles away. His heart seemed in his throat and likely to choke him with every fresh breath. But he did not stir. Then another little breeze stirred the trees, sounding clear and solemn in the stillness and Tom moved ever so slightly in unison with it, hoping by changing his angle of vision to catch a better glimpse. He could see the bright spot now, the grim figure standing directly facing him in ghostly silence.  No one moved. And there was no sound save the half audible rustle of some tiny creature of the night as it hurried over the cushiony ground.  What did it mean? Who was it, standing there? Some grim Prussian sentinel? Had they, in this remote wilderness, stumbled upon some obscure pass which the all-seeing eye of German militarism had not forgotten? Was there, after all, any hope of escape from these demons of efficiency?  Archer, his chest literally aching from his throbbing breaths, crowded close behind his tree trunk in terror, startled by every fresh stir of the fragrant breeze. It seemed to him, as he looked, that the figure danced a trifle, but doubtless that was only his tense nerves and blinking eyes playing havoc with his imagination.  There was another rustling in the trees, caused by the freshening night breeze which Tom thought smelt of rain. And again the silent figure veered around with a kind of mechanical precision, the very perfection of clock-work German discipline, as if to give each point of the compass its allotted moment of attention.  Tom strained his eyes, trying to discover whether that lonely sentinel were standing in a path or where two paths crossed or where some favored view might be had of something far off in the country below. But he could make out nothing.  Suddenly he noticed something large and black among the trees. Its outline was barely discernible against the less solid blackness of the night, and it was obscured by the dark tree branches. But as he looked he thought he could see that it terminated in a little dome, like the police telephone booths on the street corners away home in Bridgeboro. A tiny guardhouse, possibly, or shelter for the solitary sentinel. Perhaps, he thought, this was, after all, a strategic spot which they had unconsciously stumbled into; a secret path to the frontier, maybe.  He remembered now the talk he had heard in the prison camp, of Germany's building roads through obscure places in the direction of the Swiss border for the violation of Swiss neutrality if that should be thought necessary. These roads were shrouded in mystery, but he had heard about them and the thought occurred to him that perhaps these poor Alsatian people--women and children--were being taken to work on these avenues of betrayal and dishonor.  But try as he would, he could discern no suggestion of path, nor any other sign of landmark which might explain the presence of this remote station in the desolate uplands of Alsace. He believed that if they had taken five steps more they would have been discovered and challenged. How to withdraw out of the very jaws of this peril was now the question. He feared that Archer might make an incautious move and end all hope of escape.  Tom watched the solitary figure through the heavy darkness. And he marvelled, as he had marvelled before, at the machine-like perfection of these minions of the Iron Hand. Even in the face of their awful danger and amid the solemnity of the black night, the odd thought came to him that this stiff form turning about like a faithful and tireless weathercock to peer into the darkness roundabout, might be indeed a huge carved toy fresh from the quaint handworkers of the Black Forest.  As he gazed he was sure that this lonely watcher danced a step or two. No laughter or sign of merriment accompanied the grim jig, but he was sure that the solitary German tripped, ever so lightly, with a kind of stiff grace. Then the freshening breeze blew Tom's rebellious hair down over his eyes, and as he brushed it aside he saw the German indeed dancing--there was no doubt of it.  Suddenly a cold shudder ran through him and he stepped out from his concealment as he realized that this uncanny figure was not standing but _hanging_ just clear of the ground.     CHAPTER XIII  THE PRIZE SAUSAGE   \"Come on out, Archy,\" said Tom with a recklessness which struck terror to poor Archer's very soul. \"He won't hurt you--he's dead.\"  \"D-e-a-d!\" ejaculated Archer.  \"Sure--he's hanging there.\"  \"And all the time I wanted to sneeze,\" said Archer, laughing in his reaction from fear. \"Ebe-nee-zerr, but I had a good scarre!\"  Going over to the tree, they saw the ghastly truth. A man wearing a garment something like a Russian blouse, but of the field-gray military shade of the Germans (as well as the boys could make out by the aid of a lighted match) was hanging by his garment which had caught in a low spreading branch of the tree. His feet were just clear of the ground and as the breeze blew he swayed this way and that, the gathering strain upon his garment behind the neck throwing his limp head forward and giving his shoulders a hunched appearance, quite in the manner of the clog dancer. The German emblem was blazoned upon his blouse and superimposed in shining metal upon the front of his fatigue cap. Even as they paused before him he seemed to bow perfunctorily as if bidding them a ghastly welcome.  Tom's scout instinct impelled him instantly to fall upon the ground in search of enlightening footprints, but there were none and this puzzled him greatly. He felt sure that the man had not been strangled, but had been killed by impact with some heavier branch higher up in the tree; but he must have made footprints before he climbed the tree, and----  Suddenly he jumped to his feet, remembering what he had thought to be a guardhouse. It lay a hundred or more feet beyond the dangling body and as they neared it it lost its sentinel-station aspect altogether.  \"Well--what--do you--know about that?\" said Archer.  \"It's an observation balloon, I'll bet,\" said Tom. \"A Boche sausage! Look for another man before you do anything else--there's always two. If he's around anywhere we might get into trouble yet.\"  It was a wise thought and characteristic of Tom, but the other man was quite beyond human aid. He lay, mangled out of all semblance to a human being, amid the tangled wreckage of the car.  The fat cigar-shaped envelope of the balloon stood almost upright, and though it looked not the least like a police telephone station now, it was easy to see how, from a distance in the dim light, it might have suggested a little round domed building.  \"How do you s'pose it"]]]
