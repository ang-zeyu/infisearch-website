I have been watching her very closely since we left Sandy Hook, and I really believe she will make eighteen knots with a little crowding.\"  \"What makes you think so, Flint?\" asked Christy, much interested in the statement of the first lieutenant.  \"I suppose it is natural for a sailor to fall in love with his ship, and that is my condition in regard to the Bronx,\" replied Flint, with a smile which was intended as a mild apology for his weakness. \"I used to be in love with the coasting schooner I owned and commanded, and I almost cried when I had to sell her.\"  \"I don't think you need to be ashamed of this sentiment, or that an inanimate structure should call it into being,\" said the young commander. \"I am sure I have not ceased to love the Bellevite; and in my eyes she is handsomer than any young lady I ever saw. I have not been able to transfer my affections to the Bronx as yet, and she will have to do something very remarkable before I do so. But about the speed of our ship?\"  \"I have noticed particularly how easily and gracefully she makes her way through the water when she is going fifteen knots. Why that is faster than most of the ocean passenger steamers travel.\"  \"Very true; but like many of these blockade runners and other vessels which the Confederate government and rich men at the South have purchased in the United Kingdom, she was doubtless built on the Clyde. Not a few of them have been constructed for private yachts, and I have no doubt, from what I have seen, that the Bronx is one of the number. The Scotian and the Arran belonged to wealthy Britishers; and of course they were built in the very best manner, and were intended to attain the very highest rate of speed.\"  \"I shall count on eighteen knots at least on the part of the Bronx when the situation shall require her to do her best. By the way, Captain Passford, don't you think that a rather queer name has been given to our steamer? Bronx! I am willing to confess that I don't know what the word means, or whether it is fish, flesh or fowl,\" continued Flint.  \"It is not fish, flesh or fowl,\" replied Christy, laughing. \"My father suggested the name to the Department, and it was adopted. He talked with me about a name, as he thought I had some interest in her, for the reason that I had done something in picking her up.\"  \"Done something? I should say that you had done it all,\" added Flint.  \"I did my share. The vessels of the navy have generally been named after a system, though it has often been varied. Besides the names of states and cities, the names of rivers have been given to vessels. The Bronx is the name of a small stream, hardly more than a brook, in West Chester County, New York. When I was a small boy, my father had a country place on its banks, and I did my first paddling in the water in the Bronx. I liked the name, and my father recommended it.\"  \"I don't object to the name, though somehow it makes me think of a walnut cracked in your teeth when I hear it pronounced,\" added Flint. \"Now that I know what it is and what it means, I shall take more kindly to it, though I am afraid we shall get to calling her the Bronxy before we have done with her, especially if she gets to be a pet, for the name seems to need another syllable.\"  \"Young men fall in love with girls without regard to their names.\"  \"That's so. A friend of mine in our town in Maine fell in love with a young lady by the name of Leatherbee; but she was a very pretty girl and her name was all the objection I had to her,\" said Flint, chuckling.  \"But that was an objection which your friend evidently intended to remove at no very distant day,\" suggested Christy.  \"Very true; and he did remove it some years ago. What was that noise?\" asked the first lieutenant, suddenly rising from his seat.  Christy heard the sounds at the same moment. He and his companion in the cabin had been talking about the Scotian and the Arran, and what his father had said to him about prudence in speaking of his movements came to his mind. The noise was continued, and he hastened to the door of his state room, and threw it open. In the room he found Dave hard at work on the furniture; he had taken out the berth sack, and was brushing out the inside of the berth. The noise had been made by the shaking of the slats on which the mattress rested. Davis Talbot, the cabin steward of the Bronx, had been captured in the vessel when she was run out of Pensacola Bay some months before. As he was a very intelligent colored man, or rather mulatto, though they were all the same at the South, the young commander had selected him for his present service; and he never had occasion to regret the choice. Dave had passed his time since the Teaser arrived at New York at Bonnydale, and he had become a great favorite, not only with Christy, but with all the members of the family.  \"What are you about, Dave?\" demanded Christy, not a little astonished to find the steward in his room.  \"I am putting the room in order for the captain, sir,\" replied Dave with a cheerful smile, such as he always wore in the presence of his superiors. \"I found something in this berth I did not like to see about a bed in which a gentleman is to sleep, and I have been through it with poison and a feather; and I will give you the whole southern Confederacy if you find a single redback in the berth after this.\"  \"I am very glad you have attended to this matter at once, Dave.\"  \"Yes, sir; Captain Folkner never let me attend to it properly, for he was afraid I would read some of his papers on the desk. He was willing to sleep six in a bed with redbacks,\" chuckled Dave.  \"Well, I am not, or even two in a bed with such companions. How long have you been in my room, Dave?\" added Christy.  \"More than two hours, I think; and I have been mighty busy too.\"  \"Did you hear me when I came into the cabin?\"  \"No, sir, I did not; but I heard you talking with somebody a while ago.\"  \"What did I say to the other person?\"  \"I don't know, sir; I could not make out a word, and I didn't stop in my work to listen. I have been very busy, Captain Passford,\" answered Dave, beginning to think he had been doing something that was not altogether regular.  \"Don't you know what we were talking about, Dave?\"  \"No, sir; I did not make out a single word you said,\" protested the steward, really troubled to find that he had done something wrong, though he had not the least idea what it was. \"I did not mean to do anything out of the way, Captain Passford.\"  \"I have no fault to find this time, Dave.\"  \"I should hope not, sir,\" added Dave, looking as solemn as a sleepy owl. \"I would jump overboard before I would offend you, Massa Christy.\"  \"You need not jump overboard just yet,\" replied the captain, with a pleasant smile, intended to remove the fears of the steward. \"But I want to make a new rule for you, Dave.\"  \"Thank you, sir; if you sit up nights to make rules for me, I will obey all of them; and I would give you the whole State of Florida before I would break one of them on purpose, Massa Christy.\"  \"Massa Christy!\" exclaimed the captain, laughing.  \"Massa Captain Passford!\" shouted Dave, hastening to correct his over-familiarity.  \"I don't object to your calling me Christy when we are alone, for I look upon you as my friend, and I have tried to treat you as a gentleman, though you are a subordinate. But are you going to be a nigger again, and call white men 'Massa?' I told you not to use that word.\"  \"I done forget it when I got excited because I was afraid I had offended you,\" pleaded the steward.  \"Your education is vastly superior to most people of your class, and you should not belittle yourself. This is my cabin; and I shall sometimes have occasion to talk confidentially with my officers. Do you understand what I mean, Dave?\"  \"Perfectly, Captain Passford: I know what it is to talk confidently and what it is to talk confidentially, and you do both, sir,\" replied the steward.  \"But I am sometimes more confidential than confident. Now you must do all your work in my state room when I am not in the cabin, and this is the new rule,\" said Christy, as he went out of the room. \"I know that I can trust you, Dave; but when I tell a secret I want to know to how many persons I am telling it. You may finish your work now;\" and he closed the door.  Christy could not have explained why he did so if it had been required of him, but he went directly to the door leading out into the companion way, and suddenly threw it wide open, drawing the porti√®re aside at the same time. Not a little to his surprise, for he had not expected it, he found a man there; and the intruder was down on his knees, as if in position to place his ear at the keyhole. This time the young commander was indignant, and without stopping to consider as long as the precepts of his father required, he seized the man by the collar, and dragged him into the cabin.  \"What are you doing there?\" demanded Christy in the heat of his indignation.  The intruder, who was a rather stout man, began to shake his head with all his might, and to put the fore finger of his right hand on his mouth and one of his ears. He was big enough to have given the young commander a deal of trouble if he had chosen to resist the force used upon him; but he appeared to be tame and submissive. He did not speak, but he seemed to be exerting himself to the utmost to make himself understood. Flint had resumed his seat at the table, facing the door, and in spite of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18617"],["title","On The Blockade (#4)"],["body",", apparently, he began to laugh.  \"That is Pink Mulgrum, Captain Passford,\" said he, evidently to prevent his superior from misinterpreting the lightness of his conduct. \"As you are aware, he is deaf and dumb.\"    [Illustration: Mulgrum at the captain's door.]  \"I see who he is now,\" replied Christy, who had just identified the man. \"He may be deaf and dumb, but he seems to have a great deal of business at the door of my cabin.\"  \"I have no doubt he is as deaf as the keel of the ship, and I have not yet heard him speak a word,\" added the first lieutenant. \"But he is a stout fellow, very patriotic, and willing to work.\"  \"All that may be, but I have found him once before hanging around that door to-day.\"  At this moment Mulgrum took from his pocket a tablet of paper and a pencil, and wrote upon it, \"I am a deaf mute, and I don't know what you are talking about.\" Christy read it, and then wrote, \"What were you doing at the door?\" He replied that he had been sent by Mr. Lillyworth to clean the brasses on the door. He was then dismissed.     CHAPTER IV  A DEAF AND DUMB MYSTERY   As he dismissed Mulgrum, Christy tore off the leaf from the tablet on which both of them had written before he handed it back to the owner. For a few moments, he said nothing, and had his attention fixed on the paper in his hand, which he seemed to be studying for some reason of his own.  \"That man writes a very good hand for one in his position,\" said he, looking at the first lieutenant.  \"I had noticed that before,\" replied Flint, as the commander handed him the paper, which he looked over with interest. \"I had some talk with him on his tablet the day he came on board. He strikes me as a very intelligent and well-educated man.\"  \"Was he born a deaf mute?\" asked Christy.  \"I did not think to ask him that question; but I judged from the language he used and his rapid writing that he was well educated. There is character in his handwriting too; and that is hardly to be expected from a deaf mute,\" replied Flint.  \"Being a deaf mute, he can not have been shipped as a seaman, or even as an ordinary steward,\" suggested the captain.  \"Of course not; he was employed as a sort of scullion to be worked wherever he could make himself useful. Mr. Nawood engaged him on the recommendation of Mr. Lillyworth,\" added Flint, with something like a frown on his brow, as though he had just sounded a new idea.  \"Have you asked Mr. Lillyworth anything about him?\"  \"I have not; for somehow Mr. Lillyworth and I don't seem to be very affectionate towards each other, though we get along very well together. But Mulgrum wrote out for me that he was born in Cherryfield, Maine, and obtained his education as a deaf mute in Hartford. I learned the deaf and dumb alphabet when I was a schoolmaster, as a pastime, and I had some practice with it in the house where I boarded.\"  \"Then you can talk in that way with Mulgrum.\"  \"Not a bit of it; he knows nothing at all about the deaf and dumb alphabet, and could not spell out a single word I gave him.\"  \"That is very odd,\" added the captain musing.  \"So I thought; but he explained it by saying that at the school they were changing this method of communication for that of actually speaking and understanding what was said by observing the vocal organs. He had not remained long enough to master this method; in fact he had done all his talking with his tablets.\"  \"It is a little strange that he should not have learned either method of communication.\"  \"I thought so myself, and said as much to him; but he told me that he had inherited considerable property at the death of his father, and he was not inclined to learn new tricks,\" said Flint. \"He is intensely patriotic, and said that he was willing to give himself and all his property for the salvation of his country. He had endeavored to obtain a position as captain's clerk, or something of that sort, in the navy; but failing of this, he had been willing to go to the war as a scullion. He says he shall fight, whatever his situation, when he has the opportunity; and that is all I know about him.\"  Christy looked on the floor, and seemed to be considering the facts he had just learned. He had twice discovered Mulgrum at the door of his cabin, though his presence there had been satisfactorily explained; or at least a reason had been given. This man had been brought on board by the influence of Mr. Lillyworth, who had been ordered to the Gulf for duty, and was on board as a substitute for Mr. Flint, who was acting in Christy's place, as the latter was in that of Mr. Blowitt, who outranked them all. Flint had not been favorably impressed with the acting second lieutenant, and he had not hesitated to speak his mind in regard to him to the captain. Though Christy had been more reserved in speech, he had the feeling that Mr. Lillyworth must establish a reputation for patriotism and fidelity to the government before he could trust him as he did the first lieutenant, though he was determined to manifest nothing like suspicion in regard to him.  At this stage of the war, that is to say in the earlier years of it, the government was obliged to accept such men as it could obtain for officers, for the number in demand greatly exceeded the supply of regularly educated naval officers. There were a great many applicants for positions, and candidates were examined in regard to their professional qualifications rather than their motives for entering the service. If a man desired to enter the army or the navy, the simple wish was regarded as a sufficient guaranty of his patriotism, especially in connection with his oath of allegiance. With the deaf mute's leaf in his hand Christy was thinking over this matter of the motives of officers. He was not satisfied in regard to either Lillyworth or Mulgrum, and besides the regular quota of officers and seamen permanently attached to the Bronx, there were eighteen seamen and petty officers berthed forward, who were really passengers, though they were doing duty.  \"Where did you say this man Mulgrum was born, Mr. Flint?\" asked the captain, after he had mused for quite a time.  \"In Cherryfield, Maine,\" replied the first lieutenant; and he could not help feeling that the commander had not been silent so long for nothing.  \"You are a Maine man, Flint: were you ever in this town?\"  \"I have been; I taught school there for six months; and it was the last place I filled before I went to sea.\"  \"I am glad to hear it, for it will save me from looking any further for the man I want just now. If this deaf mute was born and brought up in Cherryfield, he must know something about the place,\" added Christy as he touched a bell on his table, to which Dave instantly responded.  \"Do you know Mulgrum, Dave?\" asked the captain.  \"No, sir; never heard of him before,\" replied the steward.  \"You don't know him! The man who has been cleaning the brass work on the doors?\" exclaimed Christy.  \"Oh! Pink, we all call him,\" said the steward.  \"His name is Pinkney Mulgrum,\" Flint explained.  \"Yes, sir; I know him, though we never had any long talks together,\" added Dave with a rich smile on his face.  \"Go on deck, and tell Mulgrum to come into my cabin,\" said Christy.  \"If I tell him that, he won't hear me,\" suggested Dave.  \"Show him this paper,\" interposed the first lieutenant, handing him a card on which he had written the order.  Dave left the cabin to deliver the message, and the captain immediately instructed Flint to question the man in regard to the localities and other matters in Cherryfield, suggesting that he should conduct his examination so as not to excite any suspicion. Pink Mulgrum appeared promptly, and was placed at the table where both of the officers could observe his expression. Then Flint began to write on a sheet of paper, and passed his first question to the man. It was: \"Don't you remember me?\" Mulgrum wrote that he did not. Then the inquisitor asked when he had left Cherryfield to attend the school at Hartford; and the date he gave placed him there at the very time when Flint had been the master of the school for four months. On the question of locality, he could place the church, the schoolhouse and the hotel; and he seemed to have no further knowledge of the town. When asked where his father lived, he described a white house next to the church; but Flint knew that this had been owned and occupied by the minister for many years.  \"This man is a humbug,\" was the next sentence the first lieutenant wrote, but he passed it to the captain. Christy wrote under it: \"Tell him that we are perfectly satisfied with his replies, and thank him for his attendance;\" which was done at once, and the captain smiled upon him as though he had conducted himself with distinguished ability.  \"Mulgrum has been in Cherryfield; but he could not have remained there more than a day or two,\" said Flint, when the door had closed behind the deaf mute.  The captain made a gesture to impose silence upon his companion.  \"Mulgrum is all right in every respect,\" said he in a loud tone, so that if the subject of the examination had stopped at the keyhole of the door, he would not be made any the wiser for what he heard there.  \"He knows Cherryfield as well as he knows the deck of the Bronx, and as you say, Captain Passford, he is all right in every respect,\" added the first lieutenant in the same loud tone. \"Mulgrum is a well educated man, captain, and you will have a great deal of writing to do: I suggest that you bring him into your cabin, and make him your clerk.\"  \"That is a capital idea, Mr. Flint, and I shall consider it,\" returned the commander, making sure that the man at the door should hear him, if Mulgrum lingered there. \"I have a number of letters sent over from England relating to blockade runners that I wish to have copied for the use of any naval officers with whom I may fall in; and I have not the time to do it myself.\"  \"Mulgrum writes a very handsome hand, and no one could do the"]]]
