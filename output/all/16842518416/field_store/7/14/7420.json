I should not be astonished if he were, for he seems to be on very good terms with the nymphs of Fontainebleau.\"  \"It matters little,\" said Fouquet; \"let us get there; if he is not aware of it we shall see what he will do; if he should know it, as it has two entrances, while he enters by one, we can leave by the other.\"  \"Is it far?\" asked Aramis, \"for the rain is beginning to penetrate.\"  \"We are there now,\" said Fouquet, as he put aside a few branches, and an excavation of the rock could be observed, which had been entirely concealed by heaths, ivy, and a thick covert of small shrubs.  Fouquet led the way, followed by Aramis; but as the latter entered the grotto, he turned round, saying: \"Yes, they are now entering the wood; and, see, they are bending their steps this way.\"  \"Very well; let us make room for them,\" said Fouquet, smiling and pulling Aramis by his cloak; \"but I do not think the king knows of my grotto.\"  \"Yes,\" said Aramis, \"they are looking about them, but it is only for a thicker tree.\"  Aramis was not mistaken, the king's looks were directed upward, and not around him. He held La Valliere's arm within his own, and held her hand in his. La Valliere's feet began to slip on the damp grass. Louis again looked round him with greater attention than before, and perceiving an enormous oak with wide-spreading branches, he hurriedly drew La Valliere beneath its protecting shelter. The poor girl looked round her on all sides, and seemed half afraid, half desirous, of being followed. The king made her lean her back against the trunk of the tree, whose vast circumference, protected by the thickness of the foliage, was as dry as if at that moment the rain had not been falling in torrents. He himself remained standing before her with his head uncovered. After a few minutes, however, some drops of rain penetrated through the branches of the tree and fell on the king's forehead, who did not pay any attention to it.  \"Oh, sire!\" murmured La Valliere, pushing the king's hat toward him. But the king simply bowed, and determinedly refused to cover his head.  \"Now or never is the time to offer your place,\" said Fouquet in Aramis' ear.  \"Now or never is the time to listen, and not lose a syllable of what they may have to say to each other,\" replied Aramis in Fouquet's ear.  In fact, they both remained perfectly silent, and the king's voice reached them where they were.  \"Believe me,\" said the king, \"I perceive, or rather I can imagine your uneasiness; believe how sincerely I regret to have isolated you from the rest of the company, and to have brought you, also, to a spot where you will be inconvenienced by the rain. You are wet already, and perhaps are cold, too?\"  \"No, sire.\"  \"And yet you tremble?\"  \"I am afraid, sire, that my absence may be misinterpreted; at a moment, too, when all the others are reunited.\"  \"I would not hesitate to propose returning to the carriages, Mademoiselle de la Valliere, but pray look and listen, and tell me if it be possible to attempt to make the slightest progress at the present?\"  In fact the thunder was still rolling, and the rain continued to fall in torrents.  \"Besides,\" continued the king, \"no possible interpretation can be made which would be to your discredit. Are you not with the king of France; in other words, with the first gentleman of the kingdom?\"  \"Certainly, sire,\" replied La Valliere, \"and it is a very distinguished honor for me; it is not, therefore, for myself that I fear the interpretations that may be made.\"  \"For whom, then?\"  \"For yourself, sire.\"  \"For me?\" said the king, smiling; \"I do not understand you.\"  \"Has your majesty already forgotten what took place yesterday evening in her highness's apartments?\"  \"Oh! forget that, I beg, or allow me to remember it for no other purpose than to thank you once more for your letter, and--\"  \"Sire,\" interrupted La Valliere, \"the rain is falling, and your majesty's head is uncovered.\"  \"I entreat you not to think of anything but yourself.\"  \"Oh! I,\" said La Valliere, smiling, \"I am a country girl, accustomed to roaming through the meadows of the Loire and the gardens of Blois, whatever the weather may be. And, as for my clothes,\" she added, looking at her simple muslin dress, \"your majesty sees they do not run much risk.\"  \"Indeed, I have already noticed, more than once, that you owed nearly everything to yourself and nothing to your toilet. Your freedom from coquetry is one of your greatest charms in my eyes.\"  \"Sire, do not make me out better than I am, and say merely, 'You cannot be a coquette.'\"  \"Why so?\"  \"Because,\" said La Valliere, smiling, \"I am not rich.\"  \"You admit, then,\" said the king, quickly, \"that you have a love for beautiful things?\"  \"Sire, I only regard those things as beautiful which are within my reach. Everything which is too highly placed for me--\"  \"You are indifferent to?\"  \"Is foreign to me, as being prohibited.\"  \"And I,\" said the king, \"do not find that you are at my court on the footing you should be. The services of your family have not been sufficiently brought under my notice. The advancement of your family has been cruelly neglected by my uncle.\"  \"On the contrary, sire. His royal highness, the Duke of Orleans, had always been exceedingly kind toward M. de Saint-Remy, my father-in-law. The services rendered were humble, and, properly speaking, our services have been adequately recognized. It is not every one who is happy enough to find opportunities of serving his sovereign with distinction. I have no doubt at all, that, if ever opportunities had been met with, my family's actions would; but that happiness has never been ours.\"  \"In that case, Mademoiselle de la Valliere, it belongs to kings to repair the want of opportunity, and most delightedly do I undertake to repair, in your instance, and with the least possible delay, the wrongs of fortune toward you.\"  \"Nay, sire,\" cried La Valliere, eagerly; \"leave things, I beg, as they now are.\"  \"Is it possible! you refuse what I ought, and what I wish to do for you?\"  \"All I desired has been granted me, when the honor was conferred upon me of forming one of Madame's household.\"  \"But if you refuse for yourself, at least accept for your family.\"  \"Your generous intention, sire, bewilders and makes me apprehensive, for, in doing for my family what your kindness urges you to do, your majesty will raise up enemies for us, and enemies for yourself too. Leave me in my mediocrity, sire; of all the feelings and sentiments I experience, leave me to enjoy that pleasing delicacy of disinterestedness.\"  \"The sentiments you express,\" said the king, \"are indeed admirable.\"  \"Quite true,\" murmured Aramis in Fouquet's ear, \"and he cannot be accustomed to them.\"  \"But,\" replied Fouquet, \"suppose she were to make a similar reply to my letter.\"  \"True!\" said Aramis, \"let us not anticipate, but wait the conclusion.\"  \"And then, dear Monsieur d'Herblay,\" added the surintendant, hardly able to appreciate the sentiments which La Valliere had just expressed, \"it is very often a sound calculation to seem disinterested with monarchs.\"  \"Exactly what I was thinking this very minute,\" said Aramis. \"Let us listen.\"  The king approached nearer to La Valliere, and as the rain dripped more and more through the foliage of the oak, he held his hat over the head of the young girl, who raised her beautiful blue eyes toward the royal hat which sheltered her, and shook her head, sighing deeply as she did so.  \"What melancholy thought,\" said the king, \"can possibly reach your heart when I place mine as a rampart before it?\"  \"I will tell you, sire. I had already once before broached this question, which is so difficult for a young girl of my age to discuss, but your majesty imposed silence on me. Your majesty belongs not to yourself alone, you are married; and every sentiment which would separate your majesty from the queen, in leading your majesty to take notice of me, will be a source of the profoundest sorrow for the queen.\" The king endeavored to interrupt the young girl, but she continued with a suppliant gesture. \"The Queen Maria, with an attachment which can be so well understood, follows with her eyes every step of your majesty which separates you from her. Happy enough in having had her fate united to your own, she weepingly implores Heaven to preserve you to her, and is jealous of the faintest throb of your heart bestowed elsewhere.\" The king again seemed anxious to speak, but again did La Valliere venture to prevent him.--\"Would it not, therefore, be a most blameable action,\" she continued, \"if your majesty, a witness of this anxious and disinterested affection, gave the queen any cause for her jealousy? Forgive me, sire, for the expression I have used. I well know it is impossible, or rather that it would be impossible, that the greatest queen of the whole world could be jealous of a poor girl like myself. But, though a queen, she is still a woman, and her heart, like that of any of her sex, cannot close itself against the suspicions which such as are evilly disposed insinuate. For Heaven's sake, sire, think no more of me, I am unworthy of your regard.\"  \"Do you know that in speaking as you have done you change my esteem for you into admiration?\"  \"Sire, you assume my words to be contrary to the truth; you suppose me to be better than I really am, and attach a greater merit to me than God ever intended should be the case. Spare me, sire; for, did I not know that your majesty was the most generous man in your kingdom, I should believe you were jesting.\"  \"You do not, I know, fear such a thing; I am quite sure of that,\" exclaimed Louis.  \"I shall be obliged to believe it, if your majesty continues to hold such language toward me.\"  \"I am most unhappy, then,\" said the king, in a tone of regret"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18997"],["title","The Vicomte de Bragelonne; Or, Ten Years Later (#8)"],["body","was not assumed: \"I am the unhappiest prince in the whole Christian world, since I am powerless to induce belief in my words in one whom I love the best in the wide world, and who almost breaks my heart by refusing to credit my regard for her.\"  \"Oh, sire!\" said La Valliere, gently putting the king aside, who had approached nearer to her, \"I think the storm has passed away now, and the rain has ceased.\" At the very moment, however, as the poor girl, fleeing, as it were, from her own heart, which doubtlessly throbbed too much in unison with the king's, uttered these words, the storm undertook to contradict her. A bluish flash of lightning illumined the forest with a wild, weird-like glare, and a peal of thunder, like a discharge of artillery, burst over their very heads, as if the height of the oak which sheltered them had attracted the storm. The young girl could not repress a cry of terror. The king with one hand drew her toward his heart, and stretched the other above her head, as though to shield her from the lightning. A moment's silence ensued, as the group, delightful as everything young and loving is delightful, remained motionless, while Fouquet and Aramis contemplated it in attitudes as motionless as La Valliere and the king. \"Oh, sire, sire!\" murmured La Valliere, \"do you hear?\" and her head fell upon his shoulder.  \"Yes,\" said the king. \"You see the storm has not passed away.\"  \"It is a warning, sire.\" The king smiled. \"Sire, it is the voice of Heaven in anger.\"  \"Be it so,\" said the king. \"I agree to accept that peal of thunder as a warning, and even as a menace, if, in five minutes from the present moment, it is renewed with equal violence; but if not, permit me to think that the storm is a storm simply, and nothing more.\" And the king, at the same moment, raised his head, as if to interrogate the heavens. But, as if the remark had been heard and accepted, during the five minutes which elapsed after the burst of thunder which had alarmed them no renewed repeal was heard; and when the thunder was again heard, it was passing away in so audible a manner, as if, during those same five minutes, the storm, put to flight, had traversed the heavens with the speed of the wings of the wind. \"Well, Louise,\" said the king, in a low tone of voice, \"will you still threaten me with the anger of Heaven? and, since you wished to regard the storm as a presentiment, will you still believe that presentiment to be one of misfortune?\"  The young girl looked up, and saw that while they had been talking the rain had penetrated the foliage above them, and was trickling down the king's face. \"Oh, sire, sire!\" she exclaimed, in accents of eager apprehension, which greatly agitated the king. \"It is for me,\" she murmured, \"that the king remains thus uncovered, and exposed to the rain. What am I, then?\"  \"You are, you perceive,\" said the king, \"the divinity who dissipates the storm, and brings back fine weather.\" In fact, a ray of sunlight streamed through the forest, and caused the rain-drops which rested upon the leaves, or fell vertically among the openings in the branches of the trees, to glisten like diamonds.  \"Sire,\" said La Valliere, almost overcome, but making a powerful effort over herself, \"think of the anxieties your majesty will have to submit to on my account. At this very moment they are seeking you in every direction. The queen must be full of uneasiness; and Madame--oh, Madame!\" the young girl exclaimed, with an expression which almost resembled terror.  This name had a certain effect upon the king. He started, and disengaged himself from La Valliere, whom he had, till that moment, held pressed against his heart. He then advanced toward the path, in order to look round, and returned, somewhat thoughtfully, to La Valliere. \"Madame, did you say?\" he remarked.  \"Yes, Madame; she, too, is jealous,\" said La Valliere, with a marked tone of voice; and her eyes, so timorous in their expression, and so modestly fugitive in their glance, for a moment ventured to look inquiringly in the king's eyes.  \"Still,\" returned Louis, making an effort over himself, \"it seems to me that Madame has no reason, no right to be jealous of me.\"  \"Alas!\" murmured La Valliere.  \"Are you, too,\" said the king, almost in a tone of reproach, \"are you among those who think the sister has a right to be jealous of the brother?\"  \"It is not for me, sire, to penetrate your majesty's secrets.\"  \"You do believe it, then?\" exclaimed the king.  \"I do believe Madame is jealous, sire,\" La Valliere replied, firmly.  \"Is it possible,\" said the king, with some anxiety, \"that you have perceived it, then, from her conduct toward you? Have her manners in any way been such toward you that you can attribute them to the jealousy you speak of?\"  \"Not at all, sire; I am of so little importance.\"  \"Oh! if it were really the case--\" exclaimed Louis, violently.  \"Sire,\" interrupted the young girl, \"it has ceased raining; some one is coming, I think.\" And, forgetful of all etiquette, she had seized the king by the arm.  \"Well,\" replied the king, \"let them come. Who is there who would venture to think I had done wrong in remaining alone with Mademoiselle de la Valliere?\"  \"For pity's sake, sire! they will think it strange to see you wet through in this manner, and that you should have run such risk for me.\"  \"I have simply done my duty as a gentleman,\" said Louis; \"and woe to him who may fail in his, in criticising his sovereign's conduct.\" In fact, at this moment, a few eager and curious faces were seen in the walk, as if engaged in a search, and who, observing the king and La Valliere, seemed to have found what they were seeking. They were some of the courtiers who had been sent by the queen and Madame, and who immediately uncovered themselves, in token of having perceived his majesty. But Louis, notwithstanding La Valliere's confusion, did not quit his respectful and tender attitude. Then, when all the courtiers were assembled in the walk--when every one had been able to perceive the mark of deference with which he had treated the young girl, by remaining standing and bareheaded during the storm--he offered her his arm, led her toward the group who were waiting, recognized by an inclination of the head the respectful salutations which were paid him on all sides; and, still holding his hat in his hand, he conducted her to her carriage. And, as the rain still continued to fall--a last adieu of the disappearing storm--the other ladies, whom respect had prevented getting into their carriages before the king, remained, and altogether unprotected by hood and cloak, exposed to the rain from which the king, with his hat over her, was protecting, as much as he was able, the humblest among them. The queen and Madame must, like the others, have witnessed this exaggerated courtesy of the king. Madame was so disconcerted at it that she touched the queen with her elbow, saying at the same time, \"Look there, look there!\"  The queen closed her eyes, as if she had been suddenly seized with a fainting attack. She lifted her hand to her face and entered her carriage, Madame following her. The king again mounted his horse, and without showing a preference for any particular carriage-door, he returned to Fontainebleau, the reins hanging over his horse's neck, absorbed in thought. As soon as the crowd had disappeared, and the sound of the horses and carriages grew fainter in the distance, and when they were certain, in fact, that no one could see them, Aramis and Fouquet came out of their grotto, and both of them in silence passed slowly on toward the walk. Aramis looked most narrowly not only at the whole extent of the open space stretching out before and behind him, but even into the very depths of the wood.  \"Monsieur Fouquet,\" he said, when he had quite satisfied himself that they were alone, \"we must get back, at any cost, the letter you wrote to La Valliere.\"  \"That will be easy enough,\" said Fouquet, \"if my servant has not given it to her.\"  \"In any case, it must be done; do you understand?\"  \"Yes; the king is in love with this girl, you mean?\"  \"Exceedingly so; and what is worse is that, on her side, the girl is passionately attached to the king.\"  \"As much as to say that we must change our tactics, I suppose?\"  \"Not a doubt of it; you have no time to lose. You must see La Valliere, and, without thinking any more of becoming her lover, which is out of the question, must declare yourself her dearest friend and her most humble servant.\"  \"I will do so,\" replied Fouquet, \"and without the slightest feeling of disinclination, for she seems a good-hearted girl.\"  \"Or a clever one,\" said Aramis; \"but in that case the greater reason.\" Then he added, after a moment's pause, \"If I am not mistaken, that girl will become the strongest passion of the king. Let us return to our carriage, and, as fast as possible, to the chateau.\"     CHAPTER V.  TOBY.   Two hours after the surintendant's cortege had set off by Aramis' directions, conveying them both toward Fontainebleau with the fleetness of the clouds, which the last breath of the tempest was hurrying across the face of the heavens, La Valliere was closeted in her own apartment, with a simple muslin wrapper round her, having just finished a slight repast, which was placed upon a small marble table. Suddenly the door was opened, and a servant entered to announce M. Fouquet, who had called to request permission to pay his respects to her. She made him repeat the message twice over, for the poor girl only knew M. Fouquet by name, and could not conceive what she could possibly have to do with a surintendant of finances. However, as he might possibly come from the king--and, after the conversation we have recorded, it was very likely--she glanced at her mirror, drew out still more the long ringlets of her hair, and desired him to be admitted. La Valliere could not, however, refrain from a certain feeling of uneasiness. A visit from the"]]]
