The room was a storehouse of explosives and the ball suddenly burst into flames.  Cadet Davis saw it first and calmly turned to his tormentor:  \"The fire-ball has ignited, sir,--what shall I do?\"  The professor dashed for the door:  \"Run! Run for your lives!\"  The cadet snatched the fire-ball from the floor, dashed it through the window and calmly walked out.  He had saved many lives and the building from destruction. His revenge was complete and sweet. But deeper and sweeter than his triumph over an enemy was the consciousness that he was master of himself. He had learned life's profoundest lesson.     VII  LIFE   On his graduation, the Second Lieutenant of Infantry, from the State of Mississippi, barely twenty years old, reported for duty to the Jefferson Barracks at St. Louis.  He was ordered to the frontier to extend the boundaries of the growing Republic--now accompanied by his faithful body servant, James Pemberton.  The Fort, situated on the Wisconsin River, was the northern limit of the Illinois tribe of Indians, and the starting point of all raids against the Iroquois who still held the rich lands around the village of Chicago.  The Boy Lieutenant was the first lumberman to put axe into the virgin forests of Wisconsin. He was sent into the wilderness with a detachment for cutting timber to enlarge the Fort.  Under the direction of two voyageurs he embarked in a little open boat and began the perilous journey.  The first day out his courage and presence of mind were put to quick test.  The Indians suddenly appeared on the shore and demanded a trade for tobacco. The little party rowed to the bank and began to parley. A guide's keen eyes saw through their smooth palaver the hostile purpose of a bloody surprise and warned the commander. The order to push into the river and pull for their lives was instantly given.  With savage yells the Indians sprang into their canoes and gave chase.  It was ten to one and they were sure of their prey. The chance of escape from such strong, swift rowers in light bark canoes was slight. The low fierce cries of victory and the joyous shout of coming torture rang over the waters.  The Indians gained rapidly.  The young Lieutenant's eye measured the distance between them and saw the race was hopeless. With quick command he ordered a huge blanket stretched in the bow for a sail. The wind was blowing a furious gale and might swamp their tiny craft. It was drowning or death by torture. The commander's choice was instantaneous.  The frail boat plunged suddenly forward, swayed and surged from side to side through the angry, swirling waters, settled at last, and drew steadily away from the maddened savages.  With a curious smile, the boyish commander stood in the stern and watched the black swarm of yelling devils fade in the distance.  He was thinking of his old professor at West Point. His insult had been the one thing in life to which he owed most. He could see that clearly now. His heart went out in a wave of gratitude to his enemy. Our enemies are always our best friends when we have eyes to see.  The winter following he was ordered down to Winnebago.  The village of Chicago was the nearest center of civilization. The only way of reaching it was by wagon, and the journey consumed three months.  There was much gambling in the long still nights, and some drinking. In lieu of the excitement of the gaming table, he took his fun in breaking and riding wild horses, and hairbreadth escapes were the order of his daily exercise. It was gambling, perhaps, but it developed the muscles of mind and body.  His success with horses was remarkable. No animal that man has broken to his use is keener to recognize a master and flout a coward than the horse. No coward has ever been able to do anything with a spirited horse.  He was wrestling one day with a particularly vicious specimen, to the terror and anguish of Jim Pemberton.  \"For de Lawd's sake, Marse Jeff, let dat debbil go!\"  \"No, James, not yet--\"  \"He ain't no count, no how--\"  \"All the more reason why I should be his master, not he be mine.\"  The horse was possessed of seven devils. He jumped and plunged and bucked, wheeled and reared and walked on his hind legs in mad effort to throw his cool rider. The moment he reared, the Lieutenant dropped his feet from the stirrups and leaned close to the brute's trembling, angry head. At last in one supreme effort the beast threw himself straight into the air and fell backwards, with the savage purpose of crushing his tormentor beneath his body.  With a quiet laugh, the young officer slipped from the saddle and allowed him to thump himself a crashing blow. As the horse sprang to his feet to run, the Lieutenant leaped lightly into the saddle and the fight was over.  \"Well, for de Lawd, did ye ebber see de beat er dat!\" Jim Pemberton cried with laughing admiration.  Scarcely a week passed without its dangerous excursions against the Pawnees, Comanches and other hostile tribes of Indians. The friendly tribes, too, were everlastingly changing to hostiles in a night. Death rode in the saddle with every man who left a fortified post in these early days of our national life.  The Lieutenant was ordered on a peculiarly long and daring raid into hostile territory, and twice barely escaped a massacre. Their errand accomplished, and leisurely returning to the Fort, they suddenly met a large party of Indians.  The Lieutenant shot a swift glance at their leader and saluted him with friendly uplifted hand:  \"Can you tell us the way to the Fort, Chief?\"  The tall brave placed himself squarely in the path and pointed in the wrong direction.  Instantly the Lieutenant spurred his horse squarely on the savage, grasped him by the hair, dragged him a hundred yards and flung him into the bushes. The assault was so sudden, so unexpected, so daring, the whole band was completely cowed, and the soldiers rode by without attack.  Nor was the Indian the only enemy to test the youngster's mettle. The pioneer soldiers of the rank and file in these turbulent days had minds of their own which they sometimes dared to use.  The Lieutenant had no beard. His smooth, handsome face, clear blue eyes, fresh color and gay laughter, gave the impression of a boy of nineteen, when by the calendar he could boast of twenty-one.  A big strapping, bearded soldier, employed in building the Fort, had proven himself the terror of his fellow workmen. He was a man of enormous strength and gave full rein to an ugly, quarrelsome disposition.  His eyes rested with decided disapproval on the graceful young master of horses.  \"I'll whip that baby-faced Lieutenant,\" he coolly announced to his satellites, \"if ever he opens his jaw to me--watch me if I don't. What does he know about work?\"  The men reported the threat to the Lieutenant. The next day without a moment's hesitation, in quiet tones, he gave his first order to the giant:  \"Put that piece of dressed scantling beside the window--\"  The man deliberately lifted a rough board and placed it.  \"The rough board won't do,\" said the even voice. \"It must he a dressed scantling.\"  The soldier threw him an insolent laugh, and stooped to take up a board exactly like the one he had laid down.  The baby-faced Lieutenant suddenly seized a club, knocked him down, and beat him until he yelled for quarter.  The soldiers had watched the clash at first with grins and winks and nudges, betting on their giant. His strength was invincible. When the unexpected happened, and they saw the slender, plucky youngster standing over the form of the fallen brave, they raised a lusty shout for him.  When the giant scrambled to his feet, the victor said with a smile:  \"This has been a fight, man to man, and I'm satisfied. I'll not report it officially.\"  The big one grinned sheepishly and respectfully offered his hand:  \"You're all right, Lieutenant. I made a mistake. I beg your pardon. You're the kind of a commander I've always liked.\"  Again the soldiers gave a shout. No man under him ever again presumed on his beardless face. He had only to make his orders known to have them instantly obeyed.  Jim Pemberton had watched the little drama of officer and man with an ugly light gleaming in his eyes. The young master had not seen him. That night in his quarters Jim quietly said:  \"I'd a killed him ef he'd a laid his big claws on you, Marse Jeff.\"  \"Would you, James?\"  \"Dat I would, sah.\"  Nothing more was said. But a new bond was sealed between master and man.  While at Fort Crawford, the Lieutenant had been ordered up the Yellow River to build a saw mill. He had handled the neighboring Indians with such friendly skill and won their good will so completely, he was adopted by their chief as a brother of the tribe. An old Indian woman bent with age traveled a hundred miles to the Fort to warn the \"Little Chief\" of a coming attack of hostile bands. Her warning was unheeded by the new commander and a massacre followed.  The success of this attack raised the war spirit of the entire frontier and gave the soldiers a winter of exceptional danger and hardship. The country in every direction swarmed with red warriors on the warpath. The weather was intensely cold, and his Southern blood suffered agonies unknown to his companions. Often wet to the skin and compelled to remain in the saddle, the exposure at last brought on pneumonia. For months he lay in his bed, directing, as best he could, the work of his men.  James Pemberton lifted his weak, emaciated form in his arms as if he were a child. The black man carried his money, his sword and pistols. At any moment, day or night, he could have stepped from the door into the wilderness and been free. He was free. He loved the man he served. With tireless patience and tenderness, he nursed him back from the shadows of death into life again.  On recovering from this illness, the Lieutenant faced a new commander at the head of his regiment--a man destined to set in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18721"],["title","The Victim: A Romance of the Real Jefferson Davis (#6)"],["body"," the greatest event of his life.  Colonel Zachary Taylor had been promoted to the command of the First Infantry on the death of Colonel Morgan. Already he had earned the title that would become the slogan of his followers in the campaign which made him President. \"Old Rough and Ready\" at this time was in the prime of his vigorous manhood.  Colonel Taylor sent the Lieutenant on an ugly, important mission.  Four hundred pioneers had taken possession of the lead mines at Dubuque against the protest of the Indians whose rights had been ignored. The Lieutenant and fifty men were commissioned to eject the miners. To a man, they were heavily armed. They believed they were being cheated of their rights of discovery by the red tape of governmental interference. They had sworn to resist any effort to drive them out of these mines. Most of them were men of the higher types of Western adventurer. The Lieutenant liked these hardy sons of his own race, and determined not to use force against them if it could he avoided.  He crossed the river to announce his official instructions, and was met by a squad of daring, resolute fellows, armed and ready for a fight.  Their leader, a tall, red-headed, serious-looking man, opened the conference with scant ceremony. Looking the youthful officer squarely in the eye, he slowly drawled:  \"Young man, we have defied the gov'ment once befo' when they sent their boys up here to steal our mines. Now, ef yer know when yer well off, you'll let honest white men alone and quit sidin' with Injuns--\"  There was no mistaking his accent. He meant war.  The Lieutenant's answer came in quick, even, tones:  \"The United States Government has ordered your removal, gentlemen. My business as a soldier is to obey. I shall be sorry to use force. But I'll do it, if it's necessary. I suggest a private interview with your leader--\" he nodded to the red-headed man.  \"Sure!\"  \"Talk it over!\"  \"All right.\"  The men from all sides gave their approval. The leader hesitated a moment, and measured the tall, straight young officer. He didn't like this wrestle at close quarters with those penetrating eyes and the trained mind behind them. But with a toss of his red locks he muttered:  \"All right, fire away--you can talk your head off, for all the good it'll do ye.\"  They walked off together a few yards and sat down.  With the friendliest smile the Lieutenant extended his hand:  \"Before we begin our chat, let's shake hands?\"  \"Certain--shore--\"  The brawny hand clasped his.  \"I want you to know,\" the young officer continued earnestly, \"my real feelings toward you and your men. I've been out here four years with you fellows, pushing the flag into the wilderness, and the more I see of you the better I like you. I know real men when I see them. You're strong, generous, brave, and you do things. You're building a great republic on this frontier of the world. I've known your hospitality. You've had little education in the schools, but you're trained for this big work in the only school that counts out here--the School of Danger and Struggle and Experience--\"  The brawny hand was lifted in a helpless sort of protest:  \"Look a here, Boy, you're goin' ter bamboozle me, I kin jist feel it in my bones--\"  \"On the other hand,\" the Lieutenant continued eagerly, \"I assure you I am going to treat you and your friends with the profoundest respect. It's due you. Let's reason this thing out. You've taken up these mines under the old right of first discovery--\"  \"Yes, and they're ours, too,\"--the lean jaws came together with a snap.  \"So I say. But it will take a little time and a little patience to establish your claims. The Indian, you know, holds the first rights to this land--\"  \"T'ell with Injuns!\"  \"Even so, isn't it better to first settle their claims and avoid war?\"  \"Mebbe so.\"  \"And you know we can't settle with the Indians while you hold by force the mines they claim as the owners of the soil--\"  The leader scratched his head and rose with sudden resolution:  \"Come on, and tell this to the boys.\"  The leader escorted the Lieutenant to the crowd, and commanded them to hear him. His speech was interrupted at first by angry exclamations, but at its close there was respectful silence. The fight was won without a blow.  The new Colonel was much pleased at the successful ending of the dangerous job. He had received the orders to eject these miners with a wry face. That the work had been done without bloodshed had lifted a load from his mind.  The Lieutenant was honored on the night of his return by an invitation to dine with Colonel Taylor's family. They had been settled in the crowded quarters of the Fort during his absence--the wife, three daughters and a little son.  The Lieutenant's curiosity was but mildly roused at the thought of meeting the girls. In the lofty ways of youth, he had put marriage out of his mind. A soldier should not marry. He had given his whole soul to his country, its flag and its service. He would be agreeable to the ladies, of course, in deference to his commander and the honor he was receiving at his hands.  The dinner was a success. The mother was charming and gracious in her welcome. Something in her ways recalled his own mother.  She extended her hand with a genial smile, and took his breath with her first remark:  \"I've quite fallen in love with you, sir, because of a story I heard of your West Point career--\"  \"Not in pity for my fall over the cliff, I hope,\" he answered gravely.  The mother's voice dropped to a whisper:  \"No,--your friend Albert Sydney Johnston told me that you saved a large part of your allowance and sent it home to your mother--\"  The young officer's lips trembled, and he looked away for a moment:  \"But she sent it back to me, madam.\"  \"Yes, until you wrote that she hurt you by not keeping it--\"  To relieve his evident embarrassment, the mother introduced him in rapid succession to her daughters, the eldest Anne, the second Sarah Knox, the youngest Elizabeth. Richard, the handsome little boy, had introduced himself. He had liked the Lieutenant from the first.  He had been so surprised by the mother's possession of one of the sweetest secrets of his schoolboy life, and had blushed so furiously over it, he had scarcely noticed the girls, merely bowing in his confusion.  It was not until they were seated at the table and the dinner had fairly begun, that he became conscious of the charm of the second daughter, who sat directly opposite.  Her beauty was not dazzling, but in fifteen minutes she had completely absorbed his attention. It was impossible, of course, not to look at her. She sat squarely before him. There was no embarrassment in the frank, honest curiosity with which she returned his gaze.  The thing that first impressed him was the frankness of a winsome personality. He listened with keen attention to her voice. There was no simper, no affectation, no posing. She was just herself. He found himself analyzing her character. Refined--yes. Intelligent--beyond a doubt. She talked with her father in a quiet, authoritative way which left no doubt on that score. Graceful, tender, sincere, too--her tones to her impulsive brother and her younger sister proved that. And a will of her own she had. The firmly set, full lips were eloquent of character. He liked that above all things in a woman. He couldn't stand a simpering doll.  \"Sing for us, Sarah!\" her brother said impulsively, as they rose from the table.  \"Certainly, Dick, if you wish it.\"  There was no holding back for urging. No mock modesty. No foolishness in her answer. It was straight, affectionate, responsive, open hearted, generous--just like his own sweet little sister Polly when he had asked of her a favor.  And then, he blushed to find himself staring at her in a sort of dreamy reverie. He hoped her music would not spoil the impression her personality had made. This had happened once in his life. He could never talk to the girl again, after he had heard her sing. The memory of it was a nightmare.  He watched her tune the guitar with a sense of silly dread. The tuning finished, she turned to her brother and asked with a smile:  \"And what shall I sing, Sir Richard?\"  \"The one I love best--'Fairy Bells.'\"  When the first line with its sweet accompaniment floated out from the porch on the balmy air of the June evening, the Lieutenant's fears had vanished. Never had he heard a song whose trembling melody so found his inmost soul. It set the Fairy Bells ringing in the deep woods of his far-away Mississippi home. He could see the fairy ringing them--her beautiful hair streaming in the moonlight, a smile on her lips, the joy and beauty of eternal youth in every movement of her exquisite form.  When the last note had died softly away, he leaned close and before he knew what he was doing, whispered:  \"Glorious, Miss Sarah!\"  \"You like it very much?\" she asked.  \"It's divine.\"  \"My favorite, too.\"  All night the \"Fairy Bells\" rang in his heart. For the first time in life, he failed to sleep. He listened entranced until dawn.     VIII  LOVE   In the swift weeks which followed, life blossomed with new and wonderful meaning.  In the stern years on the plains, the young officer had known but one motive of action--duty. He was an exile from home and its comforts, friends and the haunts of civilized man for his country's sake. He had come to plant her flag on the farthest frontier and push it farther against all corners.  In the struggle against the snows of winter and the pestilence of the summer wilderness, he had fought Nature with the dogged determination of the soldier. Snow meant winter quarters, the spring marching and fighting. The hills were breastworks. The night brought dreams of strategy and surprise. The grass and flowers were symbols of a nation's wealth and the prophecy of war.  By a strange magic, the coming of a girl had transformed the world. He had seen the strategic value of these hills and valleys often before. He"]]]
