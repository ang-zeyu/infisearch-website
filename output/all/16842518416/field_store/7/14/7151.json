I did notify them of the crime itself.\"  \"Yes, madam; and we are obliged to you; but how about your silence in regard to the fact of two persons having left that house immediately upon, or just preceding, the death of its master?\"  \"I reserved that bit of information. I waited to see if the police would not get wind of these people without my help. I sincerely wished to keep my name out of this inquiry. Yet I feel a decided relief now that I have made my confession. I never could have rested properly after seeing so much, and----\"  \"Well?\"  \"Thinking my own thoughts in regard to what I saw, if I had found myself compelled to bridle my tongue while false scents were being followed and delicate clews overlooked or discarded without proper attention. I regard this murder as offering the most difficult problem that has ever come in my way, and, therefore----\"  \"Yes, madam.\"  \"I cannot but wonder if an opportunity has been afforded me for retrieving myself in your eyes. I do not care for the opinion of any one else as to my ability or discretion; but I should like to make you forget my last despicable failure in Lost Man's Lane. It is a sore remembrance to me, Mr. Gryce, which nothing but a fresh success can make me forget.\"  \"Madam, I understand you. You have formulated some theory. You consider the young man with the tell-tale face guilty of Mr. Adams's death. Well, it is very possible. I never thought the butler was rehearsing a crime he had himself committed.\"  \"Do you know who the young man is I saw leaving that house so hurriedly?\"  \"Not the least in the world. You are the first to bring him to my attention.\"  \"And the young girl with the blonde hair?\"  \"It is the first I have heard of her, too.\"  \"I did not scatter the rose leaves that were found on that floor.\"  \"No, it was she. She probably wore a bouquet in her belt.\"  \"Nor was that frippery parasol mine, though I did lose a good, stout, serviceable one somewhere that day.\"  \"It was hers; I have no doubt of it.\"  \"Left by her in the little room where she was whiling away the time during which the gentlemen conversed together, possibly about that bit of writing she afterward alluded to.\"  \"Certainly.\"  \"Her mind was not expectant of evil, for she was smoothing her hair when the shock came----\"  \"Yes, madam, I follow you.\"  \"And had to be carried out of the place after----\"  \"What?\"  \"She had placed that cross on Mr. Adams's breast. That was a woman's act, Mr. Gryce.\"  \"I am glad to hear you say so. The placing of that cross on a layman's breast was a mystery to me, and is still, I must own. Great remorse or great fright only can account for it.\"  \"You will find many mysteries in this case, Mr. Gryce.\"  \"As great a number as I ever encountered.\"  \"I have to add one.\"  \"Another?\"  \"It concerns the old butler.\"  \"I thought you did not see him.\"  \"I did not see him in the room where Mr. Adams lay.\"  \"Ah! Where, then?\"  \"Upstairs. My interest was not confined to the scene of the murder. Wishing to spread the alarm, and not being able to rouse any one below, I crept upstairs, and so came upon this poor wretch going through the significant pantomime that has been so vividly described in the papers.\"  \"Ah! Unpleasant for you, very. I imagine you did not stop to talk to him.\"  \"No, I fled. I was extremely shaken up by this time and knew only one thing to do, and that was to escape. But I carried one as yet unsolved enigma with me. How came I to hear this man's cries in Mr. Adams's study, and yet find him on the second floor when I came to search the house? He had not time to mount the stairs while I was passing down the hall.\"  \"It is a case of mistaken impression. Your ears played you false. The cries came from above, not from Mr. Adams's study.\"  \"My ears are not accustomed to play me tricks. You must seek another explanation.\"  \"I have ransacked the house; there are no back stairs.\"  \"If there were, the study does not communicate with them.\"  \"And you heard his voice in the study?\"  \"Plainly.\"  \"Well, you have given me a poser, madam.\"  \"And I will give you another. If he was the perpetrator of this crime, how comes it that he was not detected and denounced by the young people I saw going out? If, on the contrary, he was simply the witness of another man's blow--a blow which horrified him so much that it unseated his reason--how comes it that he was able to slide away from the door where he must have stood without attracting the attention and bringing down upon himself the vengeance of the guilty murderer?\"  \"He may be one of the noiseless kind, or, rather, may have been such before this shock unsettled his mind.\"  \"True, but he would have been seen. Recall the position of the doorway. If Mr. Adams fell where he was struck, the assailant must have had that door directly before him. He could not have helped seeing any one standing in it.\"  \"That is true; your observations are quite correct. But those young people were in a disordered state of mind. The condition in which they issued from the house proves this. They probably did not trouble themselves about this man. Escape was all they sought. And, you see, they did escape.\"  \"But you will find them. A man who can locate a woman in this great city of ours with no other clew than five spangles, dropped from her gown, will certainly make this parasol tell the name of its owner.\"  \"Ah, madam, the credit of this feat is not due to me. It was the initial stroke of a young man I propose to adopt into my home and heart; the same who brought you here to-night. Not much to look at, madam, but promising, very promising. But I doubt if even he can discover the young lady you mean, with no other aid than is given by this parasol. New York is a big place, ma'am, a big place. Do you know how Sweetwater came to find you? Through your virtues, ma'am; through your neat and methodical habits. Had you been of a careless turn of mind and not given to mending your dresses when you tore them, he might have worn his heart out in a vain search for the lady who had dropped the five spangles in Mr. Adams's study. Now luck, or, rather, your own commendable habit, was in his favor this time; but in the prospective search you mentioned, he will probably have no such assistance.\"  \"Nor will he need it. I have unbounded faith in your genius, which, after all, is back of the skilfulness of this new pupil of yours. You will discover by some means the lady with the dove-colored plumes, and through her the young gentleman who accompanied her.\"  \"We shall at least put our energies to work in that direction. Sweetwater may have an idea----\"  \"And I may have one.\"  \"You?\"  \"Yes; I indulged in but little sleep last night. That dreadful room with its unsolved mystery was ever before me. Thoughts would come; possibilities would suggest themselves. I imagined myself probing its secrets to the bottom and----\"  \"Wait, madam; how many of its so-called secrets do you know? You said nothing about the lantern.\"  \"It was burning with a red light when I entered.\"  \"You did not touch the buttons arranged along the table top?\"  \"No; if there is one thing I do not touch, it is anything which suggests an electrical contrivance. I am intensely feminine, sir, in all my instincts, and mechanisms of any kind alarm me. To all such things I give a wide berth. I have not even a telephone in my house. Some allowance must be made for the natural timidity of woman.\"  Mr. Gryce suppressed a smile. \"It is a pity,\" he remarked. \"Had you brought another light upon the scene, you might have been blessed with an idea on a subject that is as puzzling as any connected with the whole affair.\"  \"You have not heard what I have to say on a still more important matter,\" said she. \"When we have exhausted the one topic, we may both feel like turning on the fresh lights you speak of. Mr. Gryce, on what does this mystery hinge? On the bit of writing which these young people were so alarmed at having left behind them.\"  \"Ah! It is from that you would work! Well, it is a good point to start from. But we have found no such bit of writing.\"  \"Have you searched for it? You did not know till now that any importance might be attached to a morsel of paper with some half-dozen words written on it.\"  \"True, but a detective searches just the same. We ransacked that room as few rooms have been ransacked in years. Not for a known clew, but for an unknown one. It seemed necessary in the first place to learn who this man was. His papers were consequently examined. But they told nothing. If there had been a scrap of writing within view or in his desk----\"  \"It was not on his person? You had his pockets searched, his clothes----\"  \"A man who has died from violence is always searched, madam. I leave no stone unturned in a mysterious case like this.\"  Miss Butterworth's face assumed an indefinable expression of satisfaction, which did not escape Mr. Gryce's eye, though that member was fixed, according to his old habit, on the miniature of her father which she wore, in defiance of fashion, at her throat.  \"I wonder,\" said she, in a musing tone, \"if I imagined or really saw on Mr. Adams's face a most extraordinary expression; something more than the surprise or anguish following a mortal blow? A look of determination, arguing some superhuman resolve taken at the moment of death, or--can you read that face for me? Or did you fail to perceive aught of what I say? It would really be an aid to me at this moment to know.\"  \"I noted that look. It was not a common one. But I cannot read it for you----\"  \"I wonder if the young man you call Sweetwater can. I certainly think it has a decided bearing on this mystery; such a fold to the lips, such a look of mingled grief and--what was that you said? Sweetwater has not been admitted to the room of death? Well, well, I shall have to make my own suggestion, then. I shall have to part with an idea that may be totally valueless, but which has impressed me"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18765"],["title","Famous Adventures and Prison Escapes of the Civil War (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: QUESTIONING A PRISONER.]     FAMOUS ADVENTURES AND PRISON ESCAPES OF THE CIVIL WAR   [Illustration]  NEW YORK THE CENTURY CO.  1913  Copyright 1885, 1888, 1889, 1890, 1891, 1893, by  THE CENTURY CO.

CABLE   The following diary was originally written in lead-pencil and in a book the leaves of which were too soft to take ink legibly. I have it direct from the hands of its writer, a lady whom I have had the honor to know for nearly thirty years. For good reasons the author's name is omitted, and the initials of people and the names of places are sometimes fictitiously given. Many of the persons mentioned were my own acquaintances and friends. When, some twenty years afterward, she first resolved to publish it, she brought me a clear, complete copy in ink. It had cost much trouble, she said; for much of the pencil writing had been made under such disadvantages and was so faint that at times she could decipher it only under direct sunlight. She had succeeded, however, in making a copy, _verbatim_ except for occasional improvement in the grammatical form of a sentence, or now and then the omission, for brevity's sake, of something unessential. The narrative has since been severely abridged to bring it within magazine limits.  In reading this diary one is much charmed with its constant understatement of romantic and perilous incidents and conditions. But the original penciled pages show that, even in copying, the strong bent of the writer to be brief has often led to the exclusion of facts that enhance the interest of exciting situations, and sometimes the omission robs her own heroism of due emphasis. I have restored one example of this in a foot-note following the perilous voyage down the Mississippi.  G.W. CABLE.     I  SECESSION   _New Orleans, Dec. 1, 1860._--I understand it now. Keeping journals is for those who cannot, or dare not, speak out. So I shall set up a journal, being only a rather lonely young girl in a very small and hated minority. On my return here in November, after a foreign voyage and absence of many months, I found myself behind in knowledge of the political conflict, but heard the dread sounds of disunion and war muttered in threatening tones. Surely no native-born woman loves her country better than I love America. The blood of one of its Revolutionary patriots flows in my veins, and it is the Union for which he pledged his \"life, fortune, and sacred honor\" that I love, not any divided or special section of it. So I have been reading attentively and seeking light from foreigners and natives on all questions at issue. Living from birth in slave countries, both foreign and American, and passing through one slave insurrection in early childhood, the saddest and also the pleasantest features of slavery have been familiar. If the South goes to war for slavery, slavery is doomed in this country. To say so is like opposing one drop to a roaring torrent.  _Sunday, Dec. ----, 1860._--In this season for peace I had hoped for a lull in the excitement, yet this day has been full of bitterness. \"Come, G.,\" said Mrs. ---- at breakfast, \"leave _your_ church for to-day and come with us to hear Dr. ---- on the situation. He will convince you.\" \"It is good to be convinced,\" I said; \"I will go.\" The church was crowded to suffocation with the élite of New Orleans. The preacher's text was, \"Shall we have fellowship with the stool of iniquity which frameth mischief as a law?\" ... The sermon was over at last, and then followed a prayer.... Forever blessed be the fathers of the Episcopal Church for giving us a fixed liturgy! When we met at dinner Mrs. F. exclaimed, \"Now, G., you heard him prove from the Bible that slavery is right and that therefore secession is. Were you not convinced?\" I said, \"I was so busy thinking how completely it proved too that Brigham Young is right about polygamy that it quite weakened the force of the argument for me.\" This raised a laugh, and covered my retreat.  _Jan. 26, 1861._--The solemn boom of cannon to-day announced that the convention have passed the ordinance of secession. We must take a reef in our patriotism and narrow it down to State limits. Mine still sticks out all around the borders of the State. It will be bad if New Orleans should secede from Louisiana and set up for herself. Then indeed I would be \"cabined, cribbed, confined.\" The faces in the house are jubilant to-day. Why is it so easy for them and not for me to \"ring out the old, ring in the new\"? I am out of place.  _Jan. 28, Monday._--Sunday has now got to be a day of special excitement. The gentlemen save all the sensational papers to regale us with at the late Sunday breakfast. Rob opened the battle yesterday morning by saying to me in his most aggressive manner, \"G., I believe these are your sentiments\"; and then he read aloud an article from the \"Journal des Debats\" expressing in rather contemptuous terms the fact that France will follow the policy of non-intervention. When I answered, \"Well, what do you expect? This is not their quarrel,\" he raved at me, ending by a declaration that he would willingly pay my passage to foreign parts if I would like to go. \"Rob,\" said his father, \"keep cool; don't let that threat excite you. Cotton is king. Just wait till they feel the pinch a little; their tone will change.\" I went to Trinity Church. Some Union people who are not Episcopalians go there now because the pastor has not so much chance to rail at the Lord when things are not going to suit. But yesterday was a marked Sunday. The usual prayer for the President and Congress was changed to the \"governor and people of this commonwealth and their representatives in convention assembled.\"  The city was very lively and noisy this evening with rockets and lights in honor of secession. Mrs. F., in common with the neighbors, illuminated. We walked out to see the houses of others gleaming amid the dark shrubbery like a fairy scene. The perfect stillness added to the effect, while the moon rose slowly with calm splendor. We hastened home to dress for a soirée but on the stairs Edith said, \"G., first come and help me dress Phoebe and Chloe [the negro servants]. There is a ball to-night in aristocratic colored society. This is Chloe's first introduction to New Orleans circles, and Henry Judson, Phoebe's husband, gave five dollars for a ticket for her.\" Chloe is a recent purchase from Georgia. We superintended their very stylish toilets, and Edith said, \"G., run into your room, please, and write a pass for Henry. Put Mr. D.'s name to it.\" \"Why, Henry is free,\" I said. \"That makes no difference; all colored people must have a pass if out late. They choose a master for protection, and always carry his pass. Henry chose Mr. D., but he's lost the pass he had.\"     II  THE VOLUNTEERS--FORT SUMTER   _Feb. 24, 1861._--The toil of the week is ended. Nearly a month has passed since I wrote here. Events have crowded upon one another. On the 4th the cannon boomed in honor of Jefferson Davis's election, and day before yesterday Washington's birthday was made the occasion of another grand display and illumination, in honor of the birth of a new nation and the"]]]
