She was lying on her back, with her eyes very wide open; her face, which had been bright and round and rosy, had grown pale and small, and her tearless eyes had a pathetic expression. She started up when she saw her father come in, gave a glad little cry, and then, remembering something, hid her face in her hands with a moan.  Dr. Maybright sat down in the chair which Helen had occupied the greater part of the day. He did not take any notice of Polly's moan, but sat quite still, looking out at the beautiful, glowing July sunset. Wondering at his stillness, Polly presently dropped her hands from her face, and looked round at him. Her lips began to quiver, and her eyes to fill.  \"If I were you, Polly,\" said the doctor, in his most matter-of-fact and professional manner, \"I would get up and come down to tea. You are not ill, you know. Trouble, even great trouble, is not illness. By staying here in your room you are adding a little to the burden of all the others. That is not necessary, and it is the last thing your mother would wish.\"  \"Is it?\" said Polly. The tears were now brimming over in her eyes, but she crushed back her emotion. \"I didn't want to get up,\" she said, \"or to do anything right any more. She doesn't know--she doesn't hear--she doesn't care.\"  \"Hush, Polly--she both knows and cares. She would be much better pleased if you came down to tea to-night. I want you, and so does Helen, and so do the other girls and the little boys. See, I will stand by the window and wait, if you dress yourself very quickly.\"  \"Give me my pocket-handkerchief,\" said Polly. She dashed it to her eyes. No more tears flowed, and by the time the doctor reached the window he heard a bump on the floor; there was a hasty scrambling into clothes, and in an incredibly short time an untidy, haggard-looking, but now wide-awake, Polly stood by the doctor's side.  \"That is right,\" he said, giving her one of his quick, rare smiles.  He took no notice of the tossed hair, nor the stained, crumpled, cotton frock.  \"Take my arm, Polly,\" he said, almost cheerfully. And they went down together to the old parlor where mother would never again preside over the tea-tray.  It was more than a week since Mrs. Maybright had died, and the others were accustomed to Helen's taking her place, but the scene was new to the poor, sore-hearted child who now come in. Dr. Maybright felt her faltering steps, and knew what her sudden pause on the threshold meant.  \"Be brave, dear,\" he whispered. \"You will make it easier for me.\"  After that Polly would have fought with dragons rather than shed a ghost of a tear. She slipped into a seat by her father, and crumbled her bread-and-butter, and gulped down some weak tea, taking care to avoid any one's eyes, and feeling her own cheeks growing redder and redder.  In mother's time Dr. Maybright had seldom spoken. On many occasions he did not even put in an appearance at the family tea, for mother herself and the group of girls kept up such a chatter that, as he said, his voice would not be heard; now, on the contrary, he talked more than any one, telling the children one or two most interesting stories on natural history. Polly was devoted to natural history, and in spite of herself she suspended her tea-cup in the air while she listened.  \"It is almost impossible, I know,\" concluded Dr. Maybright as he rose from the table. \"But it can be done. Oh, yes, boys, I don't want either of you to try it, but still it can be done. If the hand is very steady, and poised in a particular way, then the bird can be caught, but you must know how to hold him. Yes--what is the matter, Polly?\"  \"I did it!\" burst from Polly, \"I caught two of them--darlings--I was kissing them when--oh, father!\"  Polly's face was crimson. All the others were staring at her.  \"I want you, my dear,\" said her father, suddenly and tenderly. \"Come with me.\"  Again he drew her hand protectingly through his arm, and led her out of the room.  \"You were a very good, brave child at tea-time,\" he said. \"But I particularly wish you to cry. Tears are natural, and you will feel much better if you have a good cry. Come upstairs now to Nurse and baby.\"  \"Oh, no, I can't--I really can't see baby!\"  \"Why not?--She is a dear little child, and when your mother went away she left her to you all, to take care of, and cherish and love. I think she thought specially of you, Polly, for you always have been specially fond of little children. Come to the nursery now with me. I want you to take care of baby for an hour, while Nurse is at her supper.\"  Polly did not say another word. The doctor and she went together into the old nursery, and a moment or two afterwards she found herself sitting in Nurse's little straw arm-chair, holding a tiny red mite of a baby on her knee. Mother was gone, and this--this was left in her place! Oh, what did God mean? thought the woe-begone, broken-hearted child.  The doctor did not leave the room. He was looking through some books, a pile of old MS. books in one corner by the window, and had apparently forgotten all about Polly and the baby. She held the wee bundle without clasping it to her, or bestowing upon it any endearing or comforting little touch, and as she looked the tears which had frozen round her heart flowed faster and faster, dropping on the baby's dress, and even splashing on her tiny face.  Baby did not like this treatment, and began to expostulate in a fretful, complaining way. Instantly Polly's motherly instincts awoke; she wiped her own tears from the baby's face, and raising it in her arms, pressed its little soft velvet cheek to her own. As she did so, a thrill of warm comfort stole into her heart.  \"Polly,\" said her father, coming suddenly up to her, \"please take good care of baby till Nurse returns. I must go out now, I have some patients to see, but I am going to prescribe a special little supper for you, which Helen is to see you eat before you go to bed. Good-night, dear. Please ask Nurse, too, if you can do anything in the morning to help her with baby. Good-night, good-night, both of you. Why the little creature is quite taking to you, Polly!\"  Dr. Maybright was about to leave the room when Polly called him back.  \"Father, I must say one thing. I have been in a dreadful, dreadful dream since mother died. The most dreadful part of my dream, the blackest part, was about you.\"  \"Yes, Polly, yes, dear.\"  \"You were there, father, and you let her die.\"  Dr. Maybright put his arm round the trembling child, and drew her and the baby too close to him.  \"Not willingly,\" he said, in a voice which Polly had never heard him use before. \"Not willingly, my child. It was with anguish I let your mother go away. But Polly, there was another physician there, greater than I.\"  \"Another?\" said Polly.  \"Yes, another--and He prescribed Rest, for evermore.\"  All her life afterwards Polly remembered these words of her father's. They calmed her great sorrow, and in many ways left her a different child.     CHAPTER IV.  QUITE A NEW SORT OF SCHEME.   On a certain sunny morning in August, four or five weeks after Mrs. Maybright's death, six girls stood round Dr. Maybright in his study. They were all dressed in deep mourning, but it was badly made and unbecoming, and one and all looked untidy, and a little run to seed. Their ages were as varied as their faces. Helen, aged sixteen, had a slightly plump figure, a calm, smooth, oval face, and pretty gentle blue eyes. Her hair was fair and wavy; she was the tidiest of the group, and notwithstanding the heavy make of her ugly frock, had a very sweet and womanly expression. Polly, all angles and awkwardness, came next in years; she was tall and very slim. Her face was small, her hair nearly black and very untidy, and her big, dark, restless eyes reflected each emotion of her mind.  Polly was lolling against the mantelpiece, and restlessly changing her position from one leg to another; Katie, aged eleven, was something in Helen's style; then came the twins, Dolly and Mabel, and then a rather pale child, with a somewhat queer expression, commonly known in the family as \"Firefly.\" Her real name was Lucy, but no one ever dreamt of calling her by this gentle title. \"Firefly\" was almost always in some sort of disgrace, and scarcely knew what it was not to live in a state of perpetual mental hot water. It was privately whispered in the family circle that Polly encouraged her in her naughtiness. Whether that was the case or not, these two had a kind of quaint, elfish friendship between them, Firefly in her heart of hearts worshipping Polly, and obeying her slightest nod or wish.  \"I have sent for you, girls,\" said the Doctor, looking round tenderly at his six motherless daughters, \"to say that I have talked over matters with Helen, and for the present at least, I am willing to give her plan a trial. I think she is right when she tells me that if it turns out successful nothing would please your mother more. It entirely depends on yourselves whether it succeeds or fails. If you are agreeable to try it, you can come to me to-morrow at this hour and tell me so. Now good-by, my dears. Helen will explain everything to you. Helen, I shall not be in for early dinner. Good-by, good-by to you all.\"  The Doctor nodded, looked half-abstractedly at the upturned young faces, pushed his way through the little group, and taking up a parcel of papers and a surgical case which lay near, went straight to his carriage, which was heard immediately afterwards to bowl quickly down the avenue.  The moment he was gone Helen was surrounded by a clamorous group.  \"What is it, Nell? oh, do tell us--tell us quickly,\" said they, one and all.  \"I thought Helen looked very important these last few days,\" said Dolly. \"Do tell us what it is, Nell, and what the plan is we are all to agree to.\"  \"It sounds rather nice to be asked to agree to things,\" said Firefly. \"Wh"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18666"],["title","Polly: A New-Fashioned Girl (#3)"],["body","at's the matter, Poll? You look grumpy.\"  \"I think Helen may be allowed to speak,\" said Polly. \"Go on, Nell, out with the budget of news. And you young ones, you had better not interrupt her, for if you do, I'll pay you out by-and-by. Now, Nell. Speak, Nell.\"  \"It's this,\" said Helen.  She seated herself on the window-ledge, and Polly stood, tall and defiant, at her back. Firefly dropped on her knees in front, and the others lolled about anyhow.  \"It's this,\" she said. \"Father would like to carry on our education as much in mother's way as possible. And he says that he is willing, for a time at least, to do without having a resident elderly governess to live with us.\"  \"Oh, good gracious!\" exclaimed Polly, \"was there ever such an idea thought of?\"  \"She'd have spectacles,\" said Dolly.  \"And a hooked nose,\" remarked Katie.  \"And she'd be sure to squint, and have false teeth, and I'd hate her,\" snapped Firefly, putting on her most vindictive face.  \"Well, it's what's generally done,\" said Helen, in her grave, sad, steady, young voice. \"You remember the Brewsters when they--they had their great sorrow--how an elderly governess came, and Aunt Maria Cameron has written to father about two already. She speaks of them as treasures; father showed me the letters. He says he supposes it is quite the usual thing, and he asked me what I'd like. Poor father, you see he must be out all day with the sick folks.\"  \"Of course,\" murmured Polly. \"Well, what did you answer him about the old horrors, Nell?\"  \"One seemed rather nice,\" said Helen. \"She was about forty-five, and had thin grayish hair. Aunt Maria sent her photograph, and said that she was a treasure, and that father ought not to lose an hour in securing her. Her name was Miss Jenkins.\"  \"Jenkins or Jones, I'd have given her sore bones,\" spitefully improvised Firefly.  \"Well, she's not to come,\" continued Helen, \"at least, not at present. For I have persuaded father to let us try the other plan. He says all our relations will be angry with him; of course, he is not likely to care for that. This is what we are to try, girls, if you are agreeable. Father is going to get the very best daily governess from Nettleship to come here every morning. She will stay until after early dinner, and then George will drive her back to town in the pony trap. And then Mr. Masters is to come twice a week, as usual, about our music, and Mr. Danvers for drawing. And Miss Wilson is to stay here most of the day to look after Bunny and Bob. That is a much better arrangement than having a resident governess, is it not?\"  \"Yes,\" said three or four voices, but Polly was silent, and Firefly, eagerly watching her face, closed her own resolute lips.  \"That is part of father's plan,\" continued Helen. \"But the other, and more important part is this. I am to undertake the housekeeping. Father says he would like Polly to help me a little, but the burden and responsibility of the whole thing rests on me. And also, girls, father says that there must be some one in absolute authority. There must be some one who can settle disputes, and keep things in order, and so he says that unless you are all willing to do what I ask you to do, the scheme must still fall through, and we must be like the Brewsters or any other unhappy girls whose mothers are no longer with them, and have our resident governess.\"  \"I know you won't like to obey me,\" continued Helen, looking anxiously round, \"but I don't think I'll be hard on you. No, I am sure I shall not be hard on any of you.\"  \"That remains to be proved,\" said Polly. \"I don't think I like that plan. I won't give any answer at present--I'll think about it. Come along, Fly,\" she nodded to her younger sister, and then, lifting the heavy bottom sash of the window where Helen had been sitting, stepped lightly out, followed by the obedient Firefly.  \"I don't want to obey Nell,\" said the little sister, clasping two of Polly's fingers with her thin, small hand. \"If it was you, Poll Parrot, it would be a different thing, but I don't want to obey Nell. I don't think it's fair; she's only my sister, like the rest of them. There's nothing said in the Catechism about obeying sisters. It's only fathers and mothers, and spiritual pastors and masters.\"  \"And all those put in authority over you,\" proceeded Polly, shaking her fingers free, and facing round on Firefly, in a way which caused that young person to back several inches. \"If Helen once gets the authority the Catechism is on her side, not on yours.\"  \"But I needn't promise, need I?\" pouted Firefly. \"If it was you, it would be different. I always did what you wanted me to do, Polly Perkins.\"  \"Of course you did,\" responded Polly, in a most contemptuous voice. \"Will a duck swim? I led you into mischief--of course you followed. Well, Fly, it rests with yourself. Don't obey our dear, good, gentle Nelly, and you'll have Miss Jenkins here. Won't it be fun to see her squinting at you over her spectacles when she returns your spelling-lessons. Bread and water will be your principal diet most of the week. Well, good-by now; I'm off to baby.\"  Polly took to her heels, and Firefly stood for a moment or two looking utterly miserable and irresolute on the wide gravel walk in the center of the flower-garden. She felt very much inclined to stamp her feet and to screw up her thin little face into contortions of rage. Even very little girls, however, won't go into paroxysms of anger when there is no one there to see. Firefly's heart was very sore, for Polly, her idol, had spoken to her almost roughly.  \"I wish mother wasn't in heaven,\" she murmured in a grieved little voice, and then she turned and walked back to the house. The nearer she approached the study window the faster grew her footsteps. At last, like a little torrent, she vaulted back into the room, and flung her arms noisily round Helen's neck.  \"I'll obey you, darling Nell,\" she said. \"I'd much rather have you than Miss Jenkins.\"  And then she sobbed aloud, and really shook herself, for she felt still so angry with Polly.  \"That's a good little Fly,\" said Helen, kissing her affectionately in return, and putting her arm round her waist, so as to establish her comfortably on her knee. The other girls were all lying about in different easy attitudes, and Firefly joined in the general talk, and found herself much comforted.     CHAPTER V.  A SAFETY-VALVE.   \"Fly caved in, didn't she?\" said Polly to her eldest sister that night.  \"Yes, poor little mite, she did, in a touching way,\" said Helen; \"but she seemed in trouble about something. You know how reserved she is about her feelings, but when she sat on my knee she quite sobbed.\"  \"I was rather brutal to her,\" said Polly, in a nonchalant tone, flinging up the sash of the bedroom window as she spoke, and indulging in a careless whistle.  It was bed-time, but the girls were tempted by the moonlight night to sit up and look out at the still, sweet beauty, and chatter together.  \"How could you be unkind to her?\" said Helen, in a voice of dismay. \"Polly, dear, do shut that window again, or you will have a sore throat. How could you be unkind to poor little Fly, Poll, when she is so devoted to you?\"  \"The very reason,\" said Polly. \"She'd never have gone over to you if I hadn't. I saw rebellion in that young 'un's eye--that was why I called her out. I was determined to nip it in the bud.\"  \"But you rebelled yourself?\"  \"Yes, and I mean to go on rebelling. I am not Fly.\"  \"Well, Polly,\" said Helen, suppressing a heavy sigh on her own account; \"you know I don't want you a bit to obey me. I am not a mistressing sort of girl, and I like to consult you about things, and I want us both to feel more or less as equals. Still father says there are quite two years between us, and that the scheme cannot be worked at all unless some one is distinctly at the head. He particularly spoke of you, Polly, and said that if you would not agree we must go back to the idea of Miss Jenkins, or that he will let this house for a time, and send us all to school.\"  \"A worse horror than the other,\" said Polly. \"I wouldn't be a school-girl for all you could give me! Why, the robin's nest might be discovered by some one else, and my grubs and chrysalides would come to perfection without me. No, no; rather than that--can't we effect a compromise, Nell?\"  \"What is it?\" asked Helen. \"You know _I_ am willing to agree to anything. It is father.\"  \"Oh, yes; poor Nell, you're the meekest and mildest of mortals. Now, look here, wouldn't this be fun?\"  Polly's black eyes began to dance.  \"You know how fond I always was of housekeeping. Let me housekeep every second week. Give me the money and let me buy every single thing and pay for it, and don't interfere with me whatever I do. I'll promise to be as good as gold always, and obey you in every single thing, if only I have this safety-valve. Let me expend myself upon the housekeeping, and I'll be as good, better than gold. I'll help you, and be your right hand, Nell; and I'll obey you in the most public way before all the other girls, and as to Fly, see if I don't keep her in hand. What do you think of this plan, Nell? I, with my safety-valve, the comfort of your life, a sort of general to keep your forces in order.\"  \"But you really can't housekeep, Polly. Of course I'd like to please you, and father said himself you were to help me in the house. But to manage everything--why, it frightens me, and I am two years older.\"  \"But you have so very little spirit, darling. Now it doesn't frighten me a bit, and that's why I'm so certain I shall succeed splendidly. Look here, Nell, let me speak to father, myself; if he says 'yes,' you won't object, will you?\"  \"Of course not,\" said Helen.  \"You are a darling--I'll soon bring father round. Now, shall we go to bed?--I am so sleepy.\"  The next morning at breakfast Polly electrified her brothers and sisters by the very meek way in which she appealed to Helen on all occasions.  \"Do you think,"]]]
