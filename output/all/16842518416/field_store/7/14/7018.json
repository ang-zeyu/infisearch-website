Now there was an aunt of his living at Sandwich and his mother decided to send him there for a change. So giving him two pence for spending money, she packed him off to Sandwich for a visit.  He soon made great friends with an old woman who kept a toy-shop there, where he spent his two pence. One hot day when he had been walking about more than he ought and was tired, he went into the toy-shop to rest. The old woman had gone out but he thought it would be all right for him to sit down on a box and rest.  All at once, he heard a gentle whirring somewhere amongst the toys. Among them was a whistle that had a wind-mill at the end which turned when you blew the whistle. No one was blowing the whistle now and yet the wind-mill was turning and turning and turning.  \"What can it mean?\" said Diamond out loud after watching for a few moments.  \"It means _me_,\" answered the tiniest voice he had ever heard.  \"Who are you, please?\" asked Diamond.  \"Well, really, I begin to be ashamed of you!\" cried the voice. \"You are as bad as a baby that doesn't know its mother in a new bonnet!\"  \"Not quite so bad as that, dear North Wind,\" said Diamond. \"And I am so glad to see you. Did you sink the ship?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"And drown everybody?\"  \"Not quite. One boat got away with six or seven men in it.\"  \"And you took the others to that queer place the gentleman spoke of,\" said Diamond to himself. Aloud he said, \"Please, North Wind, I want you to take me to the country at the back of the north wind.\"  \"That is not so easy,\" said North Wind and was silent so long that he thought she must have gone away. But presently she spoke again.  \"It is not so easy,\" she said thoughtfully. \"But we shall see. We shall see. You must go home, now, my dear, for you do not seem very well.\"  So Diamond went home. That afternoon, his head began to ache very much and he had to go to bed. In the middle of the night, his aunt came in to feel his forehead and to give him a drink of lemonade. Then he went off to sleep, but was awake again soon, for a burst of wind blew open his lattice window. The same moment, he found himself in a cloud of North Wind's hair, with her beautiful face, set in it like a moon, bending over him.  \"Quick! Diamond!\" she said. \"I have found such a chance!\"  \"But I am not well,\" said Diamond.  \"I know. But you will be better for it.\"  \"Very well,\" said Diamond; and getting out of bed, he jumped into North Wind's arms. Sure enough, the moment he felt her arms fold about him, he began to feel better. It was a moonless night and very dark, with glimpses of stars when the clouds parted.  \"We shall soon get to where the waves are dashing about,\" said North Wind. And soon, Diamond looking down saw the white glimmer of breaking water far below him.  \"You see, Diamond,\" said North Wind, \"it is very difficult to get you to the back of the north wind for that country lies in the very north itself. Now, of course, I cannot blow northwards, for then I should have to be South Wind. The north is where I come from--it is my home though I never get nearer to it than the outer door. I can only sit on the door-step and hear the voices in there, behind me. Since I cannot blow in that direction to get there, I have just to draw into myself and grow weaker and fainter as I go. That makes it hard for me to carry anything--even you--with me when I go that way. So I must get some help. Let me get rid of a few of these clouds. There! What do you see now?\"  \"A boat,\" said Diamond.  \"A ship,\" said North Wind, \"whose captain I know well. I have often helped him to sail his eighty miles a day northward.\"  \"He must have tacked often to do that,\" said Diamond who had been watching the ships at Sandwich.  \"Yes, that gave him a share in the business. It is not good at all--mind that, Diamond--to do everything for those you love and not give them a share in the doing. It is not being really kind to them. If South Wind had blown that ship straight north, the captain would just have smoked his pipe all day and got stupider and stupider. But now I am going to put you aboard his ship. Do you see that round thing on the deck like the top of a drum? Below that is where they keep their spare sails. I am going to blow it off and drop you through upon the sails. You will find it nice and warm and dry. Just coil yourself up there and go to sleep.\"  A moment more, and he felt himself tumbled in on the heap of sails. Hour after hour, he lay comfortably there. He could hear the straining of the masts, the creaking of the boom, and the singing of the ropes with the roaring of the wind; also the surge of the waves past the ship's sides and the thud with which every now and then one would strike her.  All at once arose a terrible uproar. The cover was blown off again, a fierce wind rushed in, snatched him up and bore him aloft into the clouds. Down below, he saw the little vessel, he had been in, tossing on the waves like a sea-bird with folded wing. Near it was a bigger ship which was on its way to the north pole.  \"That big ship will give us a lift now,\" said North Wind. Swooping down she tucked him snugly in amongst some flags. And now on and on, they sped toward the north. How long it was, Diamond did not know, but one night she whispered in his ear, \"Come up on deck, Diamond.\"  Everything looked very strange. Here and there on all sides, were huge masses of floating ice looking like cathedrals and castles and crags, and beyond them a blue sea. Some of the icebergs were drifting northward, one passing very near the ship. North Wind seized Diamond and with a single bound, lighted on it. The same instant, South Wind began to blow and North Wind hurried Diamond down the north side of the berg and into a cave. There she sat down as if weary on a ledge of ice.  Diamond was enraptured with the color of the air in the cave, a deep, dazzling, lovely blue that was always in motion, boiling and sparkling. But when he looked at North Wind he was frightened.  He saw that her form and face were growing, not small, but transparent like something dissolving away. He could see the side of the blue cave through her very heart. She melted slowly away till all that was left was a pale face with two great lucid eyes in it.  \"She is dying away!\" he said. \"Of course, as we go northward, she is dying away more and more.\"  After a little, he went out and sat on the edge of his floating island and looked down into the green ocean. When he got tired of that, he went back into the blue cave. He felt as if in a dream. He was not hungry, but he sucked little bits of the berg at times.  At length, far off on the horizon, there rose into the sky a shining peak, and his berg floated right toward it. Other peaks came into view as he went on, and at last his berg floated up to a projecting rock. Diamond stepped ashore and a little way before him saw a lofty ridge of ice with a gap in it like the opening of a valley. As he got nearer, he saw it was not a gap but the form of a woman, her hands in her lap and her hair hanging to the ground.  \"It is North Wind on her door-step!\" said Diamond joyfully and hurried on.  [Illustration: HE WAS SURE IT WAS NORTH WIND BUT HE THOUGHT SHE MUST BE DEAD AT LAST]  She sat motionless with drooping head and did not move nor speak. He was sure it was North Wind but he thought she must be dead at last. Her face was white as the snow, her eyes blue as the ice cave, and she had on a greenish robe like the color in the hollows of a glacier.  He walked toward her instantly and put out his hand to lay it on her. There was nothing there but intense cold. All grew white about him. He groped on further. The white thickened about him and he felt himself stumbling and falling. But as he fell, he rolled over the threshold. It was thus that Diamond got to the back of the north wind.  And what did he find? There was no North Wind in sight nor snow nor ice. It was a country where even the ground smelled sweetly, though Diamond thought the odour must come out of the flowers. A gentle air breathed in his face but he was not quite sure he did not miss the wind. A river as clear as crystal ran not only through the grass but over it too. It murmured a low, sweet song as it ran. There was no sun nor moon but a pure cloudless light always, and the blue arch of the sky seemed like a harp playing the soft airs of Heaven. There were many people there and all the people seemed happy and yet as if they were going to be happier some day.  Nothing ever went wrong at the back of the north wind and the only thing one ever missed was some one he loved who had not yet got there. But if one at the back of the north wind wanted to know how things were going with any one he loved, he had only to go to a certain tree, and climb up and sit down in the branches.  One day, when Diamond was sitting in this tree, he began to long very much to get home again. And no wonder! For he saw his mother crying. Now if you wished anything at the back of the north wind, you could follow your wish if you could find the way. So Diamond knew that he must now find North Wind. He could not go home without her and therefore he must find her. He went all about searching and searching. One day as he was looking and looking, he thought he caught a glimpse of the ice ridge and the misty form of North Wind seated as he had left her. He ran as hard as he could. Yes, he was sure it was she. He pushed on through the whiteness, which began to thicken around him. It was harder and harder to go but he struggled on and at last reached her and sank wearily down at her knees. At that same moment, the country at her back vanished from Diamond's view.  North Wind was as still as Diamond had left her. But as he touched her, her face began to change like that of one waking from sleep. He clambered up upon her breast."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18614"],["title","At the Back of the North Wind (#5)"],["body","gave a great sigh, slowly lifted her arms, and slowly folded them about him, until she clasped him close.  \"Have you been sitting here ever since I went through you, dear North Wind? It has been like a hundred years!\" said Diamond.  \"It has been just seven days,\" said North Wind smiling. \"Come now, we will go.\"  The next moment, Diamond sat alone on the rock. North Wind had vanished. But something like a cockchafer flew past his face. Around and around him in circles it went.  \"Come along, Diamond,\" it said in his ear. \"It is time we were setting out for Sandwich.\"  It seemed to drop to the ground but when he looked Diamond could see nothing but a little spider with long legs which made its way over the ice toward the south. It grew and grew till Diamond discovered that it was not a spider but a weasel. Away glided the weasel and away went Diamond after it. The weasel grew and grew and grew till he saw it was not a weasel but a cat. Away went the cat and away went Diamond after it. When he came up with it, it was not a cat but a leopard. The leopard grew to a jaguar and the jaguar to a Bengal tiger.  Of none of them was Diamond afraid for he had been at North Wind's back and he could be afraid of her no longer whatever she did or grew to be. The tiger flew over the snow in a straight line for the south, growing less and less to Diamond's eyes till it was only a black speck upon the whiteness. Then it vanished altogether.  And now Diamond felt that he would rather not run any further and that the ice had got very rough. Besides he was near the precipices that bounded the sea. So he slowed up his pace to a walk and said to himself, \"North Wind will come back for me, I know. She is just teasing me a little. Then, too, she _must_ get started some way to grow bigger and bigger all the time!\"  \"Here I am, dear boy,\" said North Wind's voice behind him.  Diamond turned and saw her as he liked best to see her, standing beside him a tall, beautiful woman.  \"Where is the tiger?\" he said. \"But of course, you were the tiger. It puzzles me a little. I saw it such a long way off before me, and there you are behind me. It is odd, you know.\"  \"None of these things is odder to me than to see you eat bread and butter,\" said North Wind.  \"I should just like to see a slice of bread and butter!\" cried Diamond. \"I am afraid to say how long it is since I had anything to eat!\"  \"You shall have some soon. I am glad to find you want some!\"  She swept him up in her arms and bounded into the air. Her tresses began to lift and rise and spread and stream and flow and flutter. And North Wind and Diamond went flying southward. The sea slid away from under them like a great web of shot silk, blue shot with gray, and green shot with purple. The stars appeared to sail away past them, like golden boats on a blue sea turned upside down. Diamond himself went fast, fast, fast--he went fast asleep in North Wind's arms.     CHAPTER V  DIAMOND'S FATHER LOSES HIS EMPLOYMENT   When he woke once more, a face was bending over him. It was not North Wind's, however; it was his mother's. He put out his arms to her and she clasped him to her heart and burst out crying.  \"What is the matter, mother?\" cried Diamond.  \"Oh, Diamond dear! You have been so ill!\" she said.  \"Why no, mother dear. I have only been at the back of the North Wind,\" returned Diamond.  \"I thought you were dead,\" said his mother.  At that moment, the doctor came in. He drew his mother aside and told her not to talk to Diamond. He must be kept as quiet as possible. And indeed, Diamond felt very strange and weak. But he soon got better with chicken broth and other nice things.  And it was a good thing that he could get well and strong again. For since he had come to Sandwich, a sad thing had happened to his father. Mr. Coleman, his father's employer, had failed in business. It had come about in this way. Miss Coleman, who had looked so like North Wind that night on which he had seen her having her long black hair combed beside the fire, had a lover, a Mr. Evans. Now Mr. Evans was poor and felt ashamed to marry Miss Coleman until he had made more money and could live finely. This was a sort of false pride and it brought about great trouble for them all.  For Mr. Coleman took Mr. Evans into partnership to help him along. As soon as that happened, Mr. Evans began to urge Mr. Coleman to go into business ventures which were not honest but in which they could make a great deal of money. It was not so bad at first, but as they went on, it became more and more dishonest.  They could not seem to get out of it, however, and get back to carrying on their business in the right way. So North Wind had to take a hand and teach them better. It was Mr. Coleman's ship she sank that night when she carried Diamond into the cathedral to wait for her. In the one boat-load of people which North Wind drove off to a desert island, was Mr. Evans. He had gone along on the ship to manage the business. Now he found that it would have been better to have been poor and stayed at home to marry Miss Coleman than to be ship-wrecked and have to live on a desert island because he longed so to be rich.  The loss of the ship ruined Mr. Coleman. He had to sell off his house and his horses, old Diamond among them, and go and live in a poor little house in a much less pleasant place. He had to begin again to work and learn how much better it is to be honest and contented than to try to get rich quickly. And poor Miss Coleman thought her lover was drowned and was very, very unhappy.  Nobody suffers alone. When old Diamond was sold, young Diamond's father was thrown out of work. Then he had no way to earn money to keep Diamond and his mother and the new little baby brother who had come to them. How Diamond did wish he was big enough to do something! But of course, he could think of nothing he could do. Besides he had to get well and strong first, anyway. His father sent word that he and his mother were to stay down at Sandwich until he found something to do and a place where he could make a home for them. It was a very fortunate thing that Diamond's aunt was glad to keep them with her as long as ever they were willing to stay.  One day when Diamond was getting strong enough to go out, his mother got his aunt's husband, who had a little pony cart, to carry them down to the sea-shore. A whiff of sea air, she said, would do them both good. They sat down on the edge of the rough grass which bordered the sand. Away before them stretched the sparkling waters of the ocean, every wave of which flashed out its delight in the face of the great sun. On each hand, the shore rounded outward, forming a little bay. Dry sand was about their feet, and under them thin wiry grass.  After a time, his mother stretched out her hand for the basket which she had brought with her and she and Diamond had their dinner. Diamond _did_ enjoy it, the drive and the fresh air had made him so hungry! But he was sorry that his mother looked so sad and depressed. He knew she was thinking about his father and how they now had no home. But there was nothing for him to do. So he lay down on the sand again, feeling sleepy, and gazed sleepily out over the sand. \"What is that, mother!\" he said.  \"Only a bit of paper,\" she answered looking where he pointed.  \"It flutters more than a bit of paper would, I think,\" said Diamond.  \"I'll go and see if you like,\" said his mother.  She rose and went and found that it was a little book partly buried in the sand. Several of its leaves were clear of the sand and these the wind kept blowing about in a very fluttering manner. She took it up and brought it to Diamond.  \"What is it, mother?\" he asked.  \"Rhymes, I think,\" said she.  \"I am so sleepy,\" he said. \"Do read some of them to me.\"  \"Well, I will,\" she said and began one. \"But this is such nonsense,\" she said again. \"I will try to find a better one.\"  She turned the leaves, searching, but three times with sudden puffs the wind blew the leaves rustling back to the same verses.  \"I wonder if that is North Wind,\" said Diamond to himself. To his mother he said, \"Do read that one. It sounded very nice. I am sure it is a good one.\"  His mother thought it might amuse him although she could not find any sense in it. So she read on like this:            I know a river           whose waters run asleep,           run, run ever,           singing in the shallows,           dumb in the hollows           sleeping so deep;           and all the swallows           that dip their feathers           in the hollows           or in the shallows           are the merriest swallows of all!  \"Why!\" whispered Diamond to himself sleepily, \"that is what the river sang when I was at the back of the north wind.\"            And so with the daisies           the little white daisies           they grow and they blow           and they spread out their crown           and they praise the sun;           and when he goes down           their praising is done           and they fold up their crown           till over the plain           he is rising amain           and they're at it again!           praising and praising           such low songs raising           that no one hears them           but the sun who rears them!           and the sheep that bite them           awake or asleep           are the quietest sheep           with the merriest bleat!           and the little lambs           are the merriest lambs!           they forget to eat           for the frolic in their feet!  \"Merriest, merriest, merriest,\" murmured Diamond as he sank deeper and deeper in sleep. \"That is what the song of the river is telling me. Even I can be merry and cheerful--and that will help some. And so I will--when--I--wake--up--again.\" And he went off sound asleep.  It was not very long after this that Diamond and his mother could go home again. His father had now found something to do and this is how it came about. He one day"]]]
