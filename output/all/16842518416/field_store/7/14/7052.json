Being a pony, and only half as big as a horse, he had to move his legs twice as quickly as a horse did in order to travel at a horse's speed. Twinkleheels' friends knew that he didn't care to be beaten by any horse, no matter how long-legged.  \"It's spirit, not size, that counts,\" Farmer Green often remarked as he watched Twinkleheels tripping out of the yard, sometimes with Johnnie on his back, sometimes drawing Johnnie in a little, red-wheeled buggy.  Old dog Spot agreed with Farmer Green. When Twinkleheels first came to live on the farm Spot had thought him something of a joke.  \"Huh! This pony's nothing but a toy,\" he had told the farmyard folk. \"He's a child's plaything--about as much use as the little wooly dog that lives down by the sawmill.\"  One trip to the village and back, behind Johnnie Green's glistening new buggy, was enough to change Spot's opinion of the newcomer. Back from the village Twinkleheels came clipping up the road and swung through Farmer Green's front gate as fresh as a daisy. And old Spot, with his tongue lolling out, and panting fast, was glad to lie down on the woodshed step to rest.  \"My goodness!\" said Spot to Miss Kitty Cat. \"This Twinkleheels is the _goingest_ animal I ever followed. He doesn't seem to know the difference between uphill and down. It's all the same to him. I did think he'd walk now and then, or I'd never have travelled to the village behind him.\"  \"He's not lazy, like some people,\" Miss Kitty Cat hissed; and then crept into the farmhouse before Spot could chase her. She had a poor opinion of old Spot. And she never failed to let him know it.  It was true that Twinkleheels was not lazy. And it was just as true that he liked to play. When Johnnie Green turned him loose in the pasture he kicked and frisked about so gayly that Jimmy Rabbit and Billy Woodchuck and their friends had to step lively now and then, to get out of his way. They said they liked high spirits, but that Twinkleheels was almost too playful.  When Twinkleheels took it into his head to do anything he did it without the slightest warning. If he decided to shy at a bit of paper he was out of the road before Johnnie Green knew what had happened. And if he wanted to take a wrong turn, just for fun, he darted off so fast that he usually had his way before Johnnie could shout \"Whoa!\" Everybody said that he was as quick as Miss Kitty Cat. And that was the same as saying that there wasn't anybody any quicker--unless it was Grumpy Weasel himself.  But Twinkleheels and Miss Kitty were not alike in any other way; for Twinkleheels was both merry and good-natured. He let Johnnie Green pick up his feet, one at a time, and clean them. And the worst he ever did was to give Johnnie a playful nip, just as Johnnie himself might have pinched the boy that sat in front of him at school.  Only, of course, Johnnie Green wouldn't have used his teeth to do that.     II  FUN IN THE PASTURE   The first time he tried to catch Twinkleheels in the pasture, Johnnie Green found his new pet entirely too playful to suit him. In response to Johnnie's whistling Twinkleheels came galloping towards the bars. But when he caught sight of the halter that Johnnie held he stopped short. And he snorted, as if to say, \"I don't believe I'll go with you. I'm having too much fun here.\"  \"Come on!\" Johnnie called. \"We're going to the village.\"  But that news didn't catch Twinkleheels. When Johnnie Green began to walk towards him Twinkleheels waited until his young master reached out a hand to take hold of his mane. Then Twinkleheels wheeled like a flash and tore off across the pasture, leaving Johnnie to clutch the empty air.  Johnnie chased him, crying, \"Whoa! Whoa!\" It seemed that the faster he ran the faster Twinkleheels drew away from him. So Johnnie soon fell into a walk. At last Twinkleheels stopped and waited for him, pricking up his ears at Johnnie's whistle. Now, however, he wouldn't let Johnnie get within a dozen feet of him.  \"This is great sport!\" Twinkleheels chuckled as he dashed away again.  Johnnie Green, however, did not enjoy the sport. After following Twinkleheels all over the pasture he became tired and breathless.  Back toward the barn he turned at last.  As he climbed over the fence he looked at Twinkleheels, who stood on a knoll and regarded him pleasantly.  \"I'll get you yet!\" Johnnie called to him. \"You needn't think you can beat me!\"  Twinkleheels dropped his head, flung his hind feet into the air twice, and galloped off. He was sorry that Johnnie Green had stopped chasing him.  Johnnie found his father at work in the barn.  \"What shall I do?\" Johnnie asked him. \"I can't catch Twinkleheels. I've been trying for about an hour. And he won't let me get near enough to him to grab him.\"  Farmer Green laughed.  \"He's a rascal,\" he said. \"You'll have to coax him with something to eat. Put a few handfuls of oats in the four-quart measure and hold it up so he can see it. Shake it, too, so he can hear the oats swishing around in it. You'll get him that way.\"  Johnnie Green hastened to carry out his father's plan. And he was smiling as he stepped through the doorway, holding the four-quart measure and shaking it to hear the sound that the oats made inside it. Then his father called to him.  \"You'd better keep the halter behind you, when you get to the pasture,\" Farmer Green said. \"If Twinkleheels saw it he might not come--oats or no oats.\"  Johnnie Green chuckled.     III  TRICKING TWINKLEHEELS   Clutching in one hand the four-quart measure with a taste of oats in it, and holding the halter carefully behind his back, Johnnie Green walked slowly towards Twinkleheels. He called with short, sharp whistles--all on one note. And Twinkleheels soon came cantering up from the other side of the brook, where he had been feeding. As he neared Johnnie Green he slowed down to a walk.  Johnnie stood still and shook the oats about inside the measure, holding it up so that Twinkleheels could see it.  Twinkleheels whinnied. He knew that sound. He thought it one of the pleasantest on the farm. He, too, stopped. Then he moved forward a few steps, stopped again, sniffed, and at last came straight up to Johnnie and thrust his nose into the grain measure.  While he was munching the oats Johnnie Green passed the end of the halter rope about his neck.  \"There!\" Johnnie cried. \"There, young fellow! Now I've got you. And you'll never lead me such a merry chase again.\"  Twinkleheels acted as mild as the Muley Cow. He stood perfectly still while Johnnie slipped the halter on his head and buckled it. Then he followed Johnnie to the pasture bars, down the lane, and into the barn.  \"I got him!\" Johnnie called to his father.  \"I thought you would,\" said Farmer Green. \"That pony likes oats too well to resist a taste of them.\"  After that Johnnie had little trouble catching Twinkleheels in the pasture. Somehow the sound of the shaking oats, and the sight of the grain measure, seemed to put all thought of the halter out of his head.  To be sure, once Johnnie forgot what he was doing and hid the oats behind his back, while he held the halter up in front of him and "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18656"],["title","The Tale of Pony Twinkleheels (#1)"],["body","that at Twinkleheels. And it was an hour, that time, before Twinkleheels would let Johnnie come near him.  But that was a mistake.  One day Johnnie Green was in a great hurry. He was going to ride over the hill, to play with some friends. Running to the barn, he caught up Twinkleheels' halter and snatched the four-quart measure off the top of a barrel.  \"I won't stop to take any oats to-day,\" Johnnie said to himself. \"I'll fool Twinkleheels. It will be a good joke on him when he puts his nose into the measure and finds it empty.\"  Johnnie Green hurried to the pasture. At his first whistle Twinkleheels pricked up his ears. He had come to think only of one thing when that whistle sounded in the pasture. That one thing was _oats_. And now Twinkleheels squealed and kicked and tore down the hillside to the bars, where Johnnie Green stood and waved the grain measure in the air.  Twinkleheels had long since given up stopping to listen for the swish of the oats inside the measure. He came trotting up to Johnnie and reached his head out for the treat that he had always found waiting for him.  He thrust his nose into the measure. There was something wrong. He blew into the measure. Then he snorted and drew back. And if Johnnie Green hadn't been spry Twinkleheels would have given him the slip.  But Johnnie grabbed him and had the halter on him in a twinkling.  \"I fooled you this time,\" said Johnnie as he turned to let down the pasture bars.  Twinkleheels hung his head.     IV  THE CHEATER CHEATED   Johnnie Green thought he had done something quite clever. He had coaxed Twinkleheels up to him in the pasture with an empty grain measure.  Twinkleheels, however, had his own ideas about the matter.  \"This boy,\" he said to old dog Spot, \"has cheated me.\"  Spot lay on the barn floor, looking on while Johnnie Green harnessed Twinkleheels.  \"This boy,\" Twinkleheels explained, \"made me think he had some oats for me. He caught me unfairly.\"  Old dog Spot grinned. \"Can't you take a joke?\" he asked.  \"This is no joke,\" Twinkleheels grumbled. \"Johnnie is going to drive me over the hill. They're going to have a ball game over there. And you know folks are always in a hurry when they're going to a ball game--especially boys. And they're in the most terrible hurry of all when somebody else has to get them there. If Johnny Green had to walk, maybe he'd think there was time to stop and rest now and then.\"  Old Spot recalled the day when he followed Twinkleheels to the village and back.  \"I don't see what you're grumbling about,\" he remarked. \"I've run behind your little buggy and you kept snapping the miles off as if it was the easiest thing you did.\"  \"_You'd_ grumble yourself if you were cheated of a taste of oats that you were expecting,\" said Twinkleheels.  \"I never eat oats,\" Spot retorted.  \"Then you don't know what's good,\" Twinkleheels declared. \"After getting your mouth all made up for oats, it's pretty disappointing to chew on nothing more appetizing than an iron bit.\"  Old dog Spot snickered.  Twinkleheels stamped one of his tiny feet upon the barn floor.  \"It will never happen again!\" he cried.  Old Spot gave him a sharp look.  \"I hope,\" he said, \"you don't intend to hurt Johnnie Green. I hope you aren't planning to run away with him.\"  \"No!\" Twinkleheels assured him. \"I'm too well trained to run away, though I must say Johnnie Green deserves a spill. But of course I wouldn't do such a thing as to tip the buggy over. What I have in mind is something quite different. It's harmless.\" And that was all he would say.  He took Johnnie Green to the ball game. And he brought him home again. He was so well-behaved that when Johnnie turned him into the pasture, afterward, Johnnie never dreamed that Twinkleheels could be planning any mischief.  The next morning Johnnie took Twinkleheels' halter and the four-quart measure with three big handfuls of oats in it. Then he walked up the lane to the pasture, leaned over the bars and whistled.  Though there was no pony in sight, Twinkleheels soon came strolling out from behind a clump of bushes. He took his own time in picking his way down the hillside, as though he might be glad to keep Johnnie Green waiting.  \"Come on! Come on!\" Johnnie called. \"Come and get your oats!\" And he shook the measure before him.  To his great surprise, Twinkleheels didn't come running up and reach out to get the oats. Instead, he stopped short, with his feet planted squarely under him, as if he didn't intend to budge. Johnnie Green took one step towards him. And then Twinkleheels whisked around and ran. He shook his head and kicked up his heels. And something very like a laugh came floating back to Johnnie Green's ears.  Johnnie followed him all over the pasture. And when the dinner horn sounded at the farmhouse Johnnie had to go home without Twinkleheels.  The afternoon was half gone before Twinkleheels let his young master put the halter on him. By that time Johnnie Green had learned something that he never forgot.  Never again did he cheat Twinkleheels with an empty measure. He knew that Twinkleheels expected fair play, just as much as the boys with whom Johnnie played ball, over the hill.     V  FLYING FEET   When July brought hot, dry weather and the grass became short in the pasture Johnnie Green no longer turned Twinkleheels out to graze. He kept him in a stall in the barn and fed him oats and hay three times a day.  It was at that time that Johnnie Green made an interesting discovery. A row of currant bushes grew behind the barn. And one day when Johnnie stripped off a few stems of the red fruit and stood in the back door of the barn, eating it, he happened to snap a currant at Twinkleheels.  The result both pleased and surprised him. When the currant struck Twinkleheels he laid back his ears, dropped his head, and let fly with both hind feet.  Johnnie Green promptly forgot that he had intended to eat those currants. One by one he threw them at Twinkleheels. It made no difference where they hit the pony. Whenever he felt one, he kicked. Sometimes he kicked only the air; sometimes his feet crashed against the side of his stall.  Throwing currants at Twinkleheels became one of Johnnie Green's favorite sports. Whenever boys from neighboring farms came to play with him, Johnnie was sure to entertain them by taking them out behind the barn to show them how high he could make Twinkleheels kick.  As a mark of special favor, Johnnie would sometimes let his friends flick a few currants at his pet. And sometimes they would even pelt the old horse Ebenezer, who stood in the stall next to Twinkleheels. There was little fun in that, however. Ebenezer refused to kick. The first currant generally brought him out of a doze, with a start. But after that he wouldn't budge, except perhaps to turn his head and look with a bored expression at the boys in the doorway.  Johnnie Green and his friends were not alone in enjoying this sport. Old dog Spot joined them when he could. Unfortunately, when Twinkleheels kicked, old Spot always wanted to bark. And Johnnie didn't like noise at such times. He and his friends were always amazingly quiet when they were engaged in currant throwing behind the barn. And they were always peering about as if they didn't want to be caught there.  \"Run out to the barn and tell your father that dinner's almost ready,\" Mrs. Green said to Johnnie one day.  \"He's not in the barn,\" Johnnie answered.  \"Are you sure?\" Mrs. Green asked. \"I thought I heard him hammering out there a few minutes ago.\"  \"No!\" Johnnie murmured. \"Father's in the hayfield.\"  \"That's queer,\" said his mother. \"I was sure I heard hammering.... Well, blow the horn, then! I don't want dinner to spoil.\"  So Johnnie Green blew several loud blasts on the horn. And he was glad to do it, for it gave him an excuse for having a red face.  He threw no more currants at Twinkleheels that day. Somehow it didn't seem just the wisest thing to do. But the next morning he made Twinkleheels kick a few times. \"It's really good for him,\" Johnnie tried to make himself believe. \"He needs the exercise.\"     VI  PICKING CURRANTS   If there was one sort of work that Johnnie Green had always disliked more than another, it was picking currants. Of course he didn't object to strolling up to a currant bush and taking a few currants for his own use, on the spot. What he hated was having to fill pail after pail full of currants for his mother to make jelly and jam.  It was queer. He certainly liked jelly. And he liked jam. But he had never found currant picking anything but dull. He always groaned aloud when his mother told him that the currants were ripe enough to be picked. And he always had a dozen reasons why he couldn't pick them just then.  Now, however, currant picking didn't seem such a bore to Johnnie. When his mother announced at the supper table one evening that Johnnie would have to begin picking currants right after breakfast the next morning he didn't make a single objection. And he had intended to go swimming the next day!  \"I think--\" Johnnie remarked--\"I think some of the boys would like to help. After supper I'll ride Twinkleheels over the hill and ask the boys to pick currants with me in the morning.\"  Farmer Green and his wife listened to this speech with amazement.  \"I never heard of a boy that liked to pick currants,\" said Johnnie's father. \"Still, you can try if you want to.\"  \"Come home before it gets dark!\" said his mother.  \"Look out for that pony!\" Farmer Green exclaimed. \"I don't know what's come over him. I stepped into his stall to-day and he kicked at me. I've never known him to do that before.\"  Johnnie Green promised to be careful, and to come home early. Having important business on his hands, he hurried away without a second piece of cake. And that was a most unusual oversight on his part.  In the morning three boys appeared before Johnnie had finished his breakfast. Though they had already eaten theirs, they accepted Mrs."]]]
