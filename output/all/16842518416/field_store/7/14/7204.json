But what has become of the chase?\" asked the passenger, for the Ionian did not appear to be in sight, and he began to be anxious about her.  \"Still ahead of us, sir; but she cannot be seen without a glass. I was called with the morning watch, when the captain turned in. His policy is to keep the Ionian so that we may know just where she is, and also to give her the idea that she is running away from us,\" replied Mr. Birdwing, as he took a glass from the brackets and handed it to Christy.  The young officer could just make out the steamer with the aid of the glass. The Chateaugay was following her; and a glance at the compass gave her course as south-east, half south. Christy had sailed the Bronx over this course, and he knew where it would bring up.  \"It is plain enough, Mr. Birdwing, that the Ionian is not bound to Nassau,\" said he.  \"So Captain Chantor said when I came on deck,\" replied the first lieutenant.  \"And it is equally plain where she is bound,\" added Christy. \"That course means the Bermuda Islands, and doubtless that is her destination.\"  \"So the captain said.\"  The passenger was satisfied, and went below for his breakfast. He found Mr. Gilfleur at the table; and as the fact that the Chateaugay was chasing the Ionian was well understood in the ward room, Christy did not hesitate to tell him the news. The Frenchman bestowed one of his penetrating glances upon his associate, and said nothing. After the meal was finished they retired to the detective's room. Mr. Gilfleur looked over his papers very industriously for a few minutes.  \"This affair is not working exactly as it should,\" said he, as he selected a letter from his files. \"I supposed this steamer would proceed directly to Nassau. Read this letter, Mr. Passford.\"  \"Colonel Richard Pierson!\" exclaimed Christy, as he saw to whom the letter was addressed.  \"Anything strange about the address?\" asked the detective.  \"Perhaps nothing strange; but I saw this gentleman in Nassau two years ago,\" replied Christy, as he recalled the events of his first trip to Mobile in the Bellevite. \"I can say of my own knowledge that he is a Confederate agent, and was trying to purchase vessels there. This letter is signed by Hillman Davis.\"  \"The American traitor,\" added Mr. Gilfleur; and both of them were using the French language.  \"He says he shall send the machinery and other merchandise to Nassau to be reshipped to Mobile,\" continued Christy, reading the letter. \"He adds that he has bought the steamer Ionian for this purpose, and he expects to be paid in full for her. I think that is quite enough to condemn the steamer.\"  \"Undoubtedly; but what is the Ionian to do in the Bermudas? That is what perplexes me,\" said the detective.  \"Possibly Captain Chantor can solve the problem, for I am sure I cannot,\" answered the young officer, as he rose from his seat.  He was as much perplexed as his companion, and he went on deck to wait the appearance of the commander. About nine o'clock he came upon the quarter-deck. The Ionian remained at the same relative distance from the Chateaugay, for the captain had given an order to this effect before he turned in.  \"I am glad to see you, Captain Chantor,\" said Christy. \"Can you explain why the Ionian is headed for the Bermudas, for you have later information than any in my possession?\"  \"I think I can,\" replied the captain, taking a letter from his pocket. \"This is the contents of the last envelope brought off from the shore. The writer of it says he has just addressed a letter to 'our friend in New York,' directing him, if it is not too late, to send the steamer with the machinery and other merchandise to the Bermudas, where the cargo will be transferred to the Dornoch; for the Ovidio had been obliged to sail without her armament, and the cargo was too valuable to be risked without protection.\"  \"That is the reason why the reinforcement was sent off at the last moment,\" Christy remarked.  \"The Dornoch carries six guns and fifty men,\" added the captain, reading from the letter. \"I think we need not wait any longer to take possession of the Ionian, Mr. Passford. What is your opinion?\"  \"I concur entirely with you,\" replied Christy.  \"Quartermaster, strike four bells,\" continued the captain to the man who was conning the wheel.  \"Four bells,\" repeated the quartermaster; and the gong could be heard on deck as he did so.  In the course of half an hour, for the steam had been kept rather low for the slow progress the ship was obliged to make in order not to alarm the chase, the Chateaugay began to show what she could do in the matter of speed, and before noon she had overhauled the Ionian.     CHAPTER VI  THE BOARDING OF THE IONIAN   The Chateaugay, with her colors flying, ran abreast of the Ionian and by her; but the latter did not show her flag. A blank cartridge was then fired, but the steamer took no notice of it. A shot was then discharged across her fore foot, and this brought her to her senses, so that she hoisted the British flag, and stopped her screw. All the preparations had been made for boarding her, and two boats were in readiness to discharge this duty.  The first cutter, in charge of Mr. Birdwing, was the first to leave the ship. The sea was quite smooth, so that there was no difficulty in getting the boats off. The first lieutenant's boat went from the starboard side, and the second cutter was lowered on the port in charge of the third lieutenant. Christy went in the first boat, and Mr. Gilfleur in the second. The officers and crews of both boats were especially directed to see that nothing was thrown overboard from the Ionian; for if her captain found that he was in a \"tight place,\" he would be likely to heave his papers into the sea.  The first cutter had not made half the distance to the Ionian before she pulled down the British flag and hoisted the American in its place. Her commander evidently believed that he was getting into hot water, and well he might. He must have been selected for this enterprise on account of his fitness for it, and as the steamer had not sailed on an honest voyage, he could not be an honest man, and the officers of the boats despised him. They were determined to discharge their duty faithfully, even if they were obliged to treat him with the utmost rigor.  \"She has corrected her first blunder,\" said Mr. Birdwing, as the American flag went up to her peak. \"The skipper of that craft don't exactly know what he is about.\"  \"It must be a surprise to him to be brought to by a United States man-of-war,\" added Christy.  \"But why did the fool hoist the British flag when he has no papers to back it up? That would have done very well among the blockaders,\" continued the officer of the boat. \"I don't know very much about this business, and the captain ordered me to let you and the French gentleman in the other boat have your own way on board of her, and to do all you required. Have you any directions for me?\"  \"We desire to have the steamer thoroughly searched, and I have little doubt that we shall ask you to take possession of her,\" replied Christy.  \"Then we are to make a capture of it?\" asked the first lieutenant, manifesting no little surprise.  \"Under certain circumstances, yes.\"  \"Is she a Confederate vessel?\"  \"No; she is an American vessel.\"  \"All right; but I shall obey my orders to the very letter,\" added Mr. Birdwing. \"How many men shall I put on board of her?\"  \"Twelve, if you please,\" replied Christy, who had arranged the plan with the detective.  \"Six from each boat,\" said the executive officer; and then he hailed the second cutter, and directed Mr. Carlin to send this number on board of the Ionian.  \"And, if you please, direct him to board the steamer on the starboard side, for I take it you will board on the port,\" added Christy. \"We fear that she will throw certain papers overboard, and we must prevent that if possible.\"  The order was given to the third lieutenant, and in a few minutes more the first cutter came alongside the steamer. Mr. Birdwing ordered those on board to drop the accommodation ladder over the side; and for so mild a gentleman he did it in a very imperative tone. The order was obeyed, though it appeared to be done very reluctantly. The first lieutenant was the first to mount the ladder, and was closely followed by his passenger.  \"Where is the captain?\" demanded Mr. Birdwing, as the six men detailed for the purpose were coming over the side.  \"I am the captain,\" replied an ill-favored looking man, stepping forward with very ill grace.  \"What steamer is this?\"  \"The Ionian, of New York, bound to St. George's, Bermuda,\" replied the captain in a crusty tone.  \"The captain's name?\" demanded the officer, becoming more imperative as the commander of the Ionian manifested more of his crabbed disposition.  \"Captain Sawlock,\" growled the ill-favored master of the steamer, who was a rather short man, thick-set, with a face badly pitted by the small-pox, but nearly covered with a grizzly and tangled beard.  \"You will oblige me by producing your papers, Captain Sawlock,\" continued Mr. Birdwing.  \"For a good reason, my papers are not regular,\" answered the captain of the Ionian, with an attempt to be more affable, though it did not seem to be in his nature to be anything but a brute in his manners.  \"Regular or not, you will oblige me by exhibiting them,\" the officer insisted.  \"It is not my fault that a change was made in my orders after I got under way,\" pleaded Captain Sawlock.  \"Will you produce your clearance and other papers?\" demanded the lieutenant very decidedly.  \"This is an American vessel, and you have no right to overhaul me in this manner,\" growled the captain of the steamer.  \"You are in command of a steamer, and you cannot be so ignorant as to believe that an officer of a man-of-war has not the right to require you to show your papers,\" added Mr. Birdwing with a palpable sneer.  \"This is an American vessel,\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18803"],["title","Fighting for the Right (#7)"],["body","Captain Sawlock.  \"Then why did you hoist the British flag?\"  \"That's my business!\"  \"But it is mine also. Do you decline to show your papers? You are trifling with me,\" said Mr. Birdwing impatiently.  At this moment there was a scuffle in the waist of the steamer, which attracted the attention of all on the deck. Mr. Gilfleur had suddenly thrown himself on the first officer of the Ionian; and when his second officer and several sailors had gone to his assistance, the third lieutenant of the Chateaugay had rushed in to the support of the Frenchman. The man-of-war's men were all armed with cutlasses and revolvers; but they did not use their weapons, and it looked like a rough-and-tumble fight on the deck.  Mr. Birdwing and Christy rushed over to the starboard side of the steamer; but Mr. Carlin and his men had so effectively sustained the detective that the affray had reached a conclusion before they could interfere. Mr. Gilfleur was crawling out from under two or three men who had thrown themselves upon him when he brought the first officer to the deck by jumping suddenly upon him. The Frenchman had in his hand a tin case about a foot in length, and three inches in diameter, such as are sometimes used to contain charters, or similar valuable papers.  The contest had plainly been for the possession of this case, which the quick eye of the detective had discovered as the mate was carrying it forward; for Mr. Carlin had sent two of his men to the stern at the request of the Frenchman, charged to allow no one to throw anything overboard. The first officer of the Ionian had listened to the conversation between Captain Sawlock and the first lieutenant, and had gone below into the cabin when it began to be a little stormy.  \"What does all this mean, Mr. Carlin?\" inquired Mr. Birdwing.  \"I simply obeyed my orders to support Mr. Gilfleur; and he can explain his action better than I can,\" replied the third lieutenant.  \"I have requested the officers, through Captain Chantor, to see that nothing was thrown overboard, either before or after we boarded the steamer,\" interposed Christy.  \"And the captain's order has been obeyed,\" added the first lieutenant. \"Will you explain the cause of this affray, Mr. Gilfleur?\"  \"With the greatest pleasure,\" answered the detective with one of his politest bows. \"While you were talking with the captain of the Ionian, I saw the first officer of this steamer go into the cabin. I was told by a sailor that he was the mate. In a minute or two he came on deck again, and I saw that he had something under his coat. He moved forward, and was going to the side when I jumped upon him. After a struggle I took this tin case from him.\"  The detective stepped forward, and handed the tin case to the executive officer as gracefully as though he had been figuring in a ballroom. Captain Sawlock had followed the officers over from the port side. He appeared to be confounded, and listened in silence to the explanation of Mr. Gilfleur. But he looked decidedly ugly.  \"That case is my personal, private property,\" said he, as soon as it was in the hands of the chief officer of the boarding-party.  \"I don't dispute it, Captain Sawlock; but at the same time I intend to examine its contents,\" replied Mr. Birdwing mildly, but firmly.  \"This is an outrage, Mr. Officer!\" exclaimed the discomfited master.  \"If it is, I am responsible for it,\" added the executive officer, as he removed the cover from the end of the case.  \"I protest against this outrage! I will not submit to it!\" howled Captain Sawlock, carried away by his wrath.  \"Perhaps you will,\" said Mr. Birdwing quietly.  \"But I will not!\"  With a sudden movement he threw himself upon the officer, and attempted to wrest the tin case from his hands. Christy, who was standing behind him, seized him by the collar with both hands, and hurled him to the deck. A moment later two seamen, by order of Mr. Carlin, took him each by his two arms, and held him like a vice.  \"I think we will retire to the cabin to examine these papers, for I see that the case is filled with documents, including some sealed letters,\" continued Mr. Birdwing, as he moved towards the cabin door.  \"That cabin is mine! You can't go into it!\" howled Captain Sawlock, crazy with anger. \"Don't let them go into the cabin, Withers!\"  Withers appeared to be the mate, and he stepped forward as though he intended to do something; but a couple of seamen, by order of the first lieutenant, arrested and held him. He had apparently had enough of it in his encounter with the detective, for he submitted without any resistance. If the captain of the steamer was a fool, the mate was not, for he saw the folly of resisting a United States force.  \"Mr. Carlin, you will remain on deck with the men; Mr. Passford and Mr. Gilfleur, may I trouble you to come into the cabin with me?\" continued Mr. Birdwing, as he led the way.  The executive officer seated himself at the table in the middle of the cabin, and his companions took places on each side of him. The first paper drawn from the case was the clearance of the Ionian for Wilmington, with a cargo of old iron. The manifest had clearly been trumped up for the occasion. The old iron was specified, and a list of other articles of merchandise.  At this point the executive officer sent for Mr. Carlin, and directed him to take off the hatches and examine the cargo, especially what was under the pieces of machinery. There were several letters to unknown persons, and one in particular to the captain himself, in which he was directed to deliver the machinery to a gentleman with the title of \"Captain,\" who was doubtless a Confederate agent, in St. George's, Bermuda. The papers were abundantly sufficient to convict Davis of treason. The last one found in the case directed Captain Sawlock to deliver the cannon and ammunition in the bottom of the vessel to the steamer Dornoch, on her arrival at St. George's, or at some convenient place in the Bahama Islands.     CHAPTER VII  A BOLD PROPOSITION   The evidence was sufficient to justify the capture of the Ionian without a particle of doubt, for she was as really a Confederate vessel as though the captain and officers were provided with commissions signed by Mr. Jefferson Davis.  Mr. Birdwing went to the door and directed the third lieutenant to have Captain Sawlock conducted to the cabin; and the two seamen who had held him as a prisoner brought him before the first lieutenant of the Chateaugay. He appeared to have got control of his temper, and offered no further resistance. Mr. Carlin came to the door, and his superior directed him to examine all hands forward, in order to ascertain whether they were Confederates or otherwise. He gave him the shipping-list to assist him.  \"Are you an American citizen, Captain Sawlock?\" asked Mr. Birdwing, as soon as the third lieutenant had departed on his mission.  \"I am,\" replied he stiffly.  \"Where were you horn?\"  \"In Pensacola.\"  \"Have you ever taken the oath of allegiance to the United States government?\"  \"No; and I never will!\" protested the captain with an oath.  \"I must inform you, Captain Sawlock, that I am directed by the commander of the United States steamer Chateaugay to take possession of the Ionian, on finding sufficient evidence on board that she is engaged in an illegal voyage. I have no doubt in regard to the matter, and I take possession of her accordingly.\"  \"It is an outrage!\" howled the captain with a heavy oath.  \"You can settle that matter with the courts. I have nothing more to say,\" replied Mr. Birdwing as he rose and left the cabin, followed by Christy and the detective.  \"I found ten heavy guns and a large quantity of ammunition at the bottom of the hold,\" reported Mr. Carlin, as his superior appeared on deck, and handed back the shipping-list of the vessel. \"The three engineers appear to be Englishmen, and so declare themselves. I find six Americans among the crew, who are provided with protections, and they all desire to enlist in the navy. The rest of the crew are of all nations.\"  \"Let the six men with protections man the first cutter. You will remain on board of the Ionian, Mr. Carlin, till orders come to you from the captain,\" said the first lieutenant. \"I shall now return to the Chateaugay to report.\"  Christy decided to return to the ship; but the detective wished to remain, though he said there was nothing more for him to do. The six sailors who wished to enter the navy were ordered into the boat, two of the regular crew remaining in it. The recruits were good-looking men, and they pulled their oars as though they had already served in the navy. They supposed the Ionian was really bound to Wilmington; but they could not explain why they had not enlisted at Brooklyn if they desired to do so. The first lieutenant went on board of the ship, and reported to the captain.  Mr. Gwyndale was at once appointed prize-master, with Mr. Tompers as his executive officer, and sent on board with the ten seamen who had been put on board of the Chateaugay expressly for this duty. Several pairs of handcuffs were sent on board of the Ionian, for the first lieutenant apprehended that they would be needed to keep Captain Sawlock and his mate in proper subjection. The papers which had been contained in the tin case were intrusted to the care of Mr. Gwyndale, with the strictest injunction to keep them safely, and deliver them to the government official before any of the Ionian ship's company were permitted to land.  The cutters returned from the prize with all the hands who had been sent from the ship, including Mr. Gilfleur. The prize-master had a sufficient force with him to handle the steamer, and to control the disaffected, if there were any besides the captain and mate. The engineers and firemen were willing to remain and do duty as long as they were paid. In a couple of hours the Ionian started her screw and headed for New York, where she would arrive the next day.  Captain"]]]
