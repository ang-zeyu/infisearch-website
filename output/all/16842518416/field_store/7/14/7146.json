Thus the trade of the Indian Ocean was secured for Islam, the first Moslem settlements arose in Malabar, and when the Portuguese broke into this _mare clausum_, in 1497-8, they found a belt of \"Moorish\" coast towns, from Magadoxo to Quiloa, controlling both the Indian and the inland African trades, as Ibn Batuta had found in 1330.  By Edrisi's day, moreover, the steady persistence and self-evident results of Arabic overland exploration had become recognised by a sort of \"Traveller's Doctorate.\" It was not enough for the highest knowledge to study the Koran, and the Sunna, and the Greek philosophers at home; for a perfect education, a man must have travelled at least through the length and breadth of Islam. All the successors of Edrisi, in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, shew this mingling of science and religion, of practical and speculative energy.  Tradition still governed Moslem thought, but there had come into being a sort of half-acknowledged appendix to tradition, made up of real observations on men and things. And in these observations, geographical interest was the main factor.  The Life of Al Heravy of Herat (1173-1215), the \"Doctor Ubiquitus\" of Islam in the age of the Crusades, gives us a picture of another Massoudy. The friend of the Emperor Manuel Comnenus, the \"first man among Christians,\" Heravy seems able in his own person to break down the partition wall of religious feud by the common interest of science. In 1192 he was offered the patronage of the Crusading princes, and Richard Coeur de Lion begged for the favour of an interview, and begged in vain. Heravy, who had been on one of his exploring journeys, angrily refused to see the King whose men had broken his quiet and wasted his time. Before his death, he had run over the world (men said) from China to the Pyrenees and from Abyssinia to the Danube, \"scribbling his name on every wall,\" and his survey of the Eastern Empire was the single matter in which Turks and \"Romans\" made common cause,--for Greeks and Latins at Byzantium alike read Heravy, like a Christian doctor. Another example of the same catholic spirit is \"Yacout the Roman,\"[16] whose _Dictionary_, finished in the earlier half of the thirteenth century, was a summary of geographical advance since Edrisi, like the similar work of Ibn Said, of the same period.  [Footnote 16: Yacout \"the ruby,\" originally a Greek slave, who made a brave but fruitless attempt to change his name into Yacoub or Jacob, became one of the greatest of Arab encyclopædists, was checked by the hordes of Genghiz-Khan in his exploration of Central Asia, and died 1229.]  But as a matter of fact, the balance both of knowledge and power was now shifting from Islam to Christendom. The most daring and successful travellers after the rise of the Mongols were the Venetian Marco Polo and the Friar Preachers who revived Chinese Christianity (1270-1350); Madeira and the Canaries (off Moslem Africa) were finally rediscovered not by Arabic enterprise, but by the Italian Malocello in 1270, by the English Macham in the reign of our Edward III., and by Portuguese ships under Genoese captains in 1341; in 1291 the Vivaldi ventured beyond Cape Bojador, where no Moor had ever been, except by force of storm, as in the doubtful story of Ibn Fatimah, who \"first saw the White Headland,\" Cape Blanco, between Cape Bojador and Cape Verde.  In the fourteenth century the map of Edrisi was superseded by the new Italian plans and coast-charts, or Portolani. As the Moslem world fell into political disorder, its science declined. \"Judicial astrology\" seemed gaining a stronger and stronger hold over Islam, and the irruption of the Turks gradually resulted in the ruin of all the higher Moslem culture. Superstition and barbarism shared the honour and the spoils of this victory.  But two great names close the five hundred years of Arab learning.  1. Ibn Batuta (_c._ 1330), who made himself as much at home in China as in his native Morocco, is the last of Mohammedan travellers of real importance. Though we have only abridgments of his work left to us, Colonel Yule is well within his rights in his deliberate judgment, \"that it must rank at least as one of the four chief guide books of the Middle Ages,\" along with the _Book of Ser Marco Polo_ and the journals of the two Friar-travellers, Friar Odoric and Friar William de Rubruquis.  2. With _Abulfeda_ the Eastern school of Moslem geography comes to an end, as the Western does with Ibn Batuta. In the early years of the fourteenth century he rewrote the \"story and description of the Land of Islam,\" with a completeness quite encyclopædic. But his work has all the failings of a compilation, however careful, in that, or any, age. It is based upon information, not upon inspection; it is in no sense original. As it began in imitation, so it ended. If it rejects Ptolemy, it is only to follow Strabo or someone else; on all the mathematical and astronomical data its doctrine is according to the Alexandrians of twelve hundred years before, and this last _précis_ of the science of a great race and a great religion can only be understood in the light of its model--in Greek geography.     CHAPTER I.  EARLY CHRISTIAN PILGRIMS.  CIRCA 333-867.   The special interest of the life and work of Henry the Navigator (1394-1460) lies in the relation it bears to the general expansion of Europe and Christendom--an expansion that had been slowly gathering strength since the eleventh century. But even before the tide had turned in the age of Hildebrand and the First Crusade, even from the time that Constantine founded the Christian Empire of Rome, the Christian Capital on the Bosphorus, and the State Church of the Western World,--pilgrimage, trade, conquest, and colonisation had been successively calling out the energies of the moving races, \"the motor muscles\" of Europe. It is through the \"generous Henry, Prince of Portugal,\" that this activity is brought to its third and triumphant stage--to the time of Columbus and Da Gama and Magellan,--but it is only by tracing the earlier progress of that outward movement, which has made Europe the ruling civilisation of the world, that we can fairly grasp the import of that transition in which Henry is the hero.  More than any other single man he is the author of the discovering movement of the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries,--and by this movement India has been conquered, America repeopled, the world made clear, and the civilisation which the Roman Empire left behind has conquered or utterly overshadowed every one of its old rivals and superiors--Islam, India, China, Tartary.  But before the fifteenth century, before the birth of Prince Henry, Christendom, Greek and Latin, was at best only one of the greater civilising and conquering forces struggling for mastery; before the age of the Crusades, before the eleventh century, it was plainly weaker than the Moslem powers; it seemed unable to fight against Slav or Scandinavian Heathendom; it was only saved by distance from becoming a province of China; India, the world's great prize, was cut off from it by the Arabs. Even before the rise of Islam, under Constantine or Theodosius or Justinian, the Church-State of the Byzantine Cæsars, though then ruling in almost every province of Trajan's empire, was in a splendid but sure decline from the exhaustion of the southern races. Our story then begins naturally with the worst time and climbs up for a thousand years, from the Heathen and Mohammedan conquests of the fifth and seventh centuries, to the reversal of that judgment, of those conquests, in the fifteenth. The expansion of Europe is going on all this time, but at our beginning, in the years before and after Pope Gregory the Great, even the legacy of Greece and Rome, in wide knowledge of the world and practical exploring energy, seemed to have passed from sight.  And in the decline of the old Empire, while Constantine and Justinian are said to receive and exchange embassies with the Court of China, there is no real extension of geographical knowledge or outlook. Christian enterprise in this field is mainly one of pilgrimage, and the pilgrims only cease to be important when the Northmen, first Heathen, then Christian, begin to lead, in a very different manner, the expansion of Europe. Into this folk-wandering of the Vikings, the first great outward movement of our Europe in the Middle Ages, is absorbed the reviving energy of trade, as well as the ever-growing impulse of pilgrimage. The Vikings are the highest type of explorers; they do not merely find out new lands and trade with them, but conquer and colonise them. They extend not merely the knowledge, but the whole state and being of Europe, to a New World.  Lastly, the partial activity of commerce and religion made universal and \"political\" by the leading western race--for itself only--is taken up by all Christendom in the Crusades, borrowed in idea from Spain, but borrowed with the spirit of the Norse rovers, and made universal for the Latin world, for the whole federation of Rome. In the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries we have the preparation for the discovery and colonisation of the outside world by Europeans in the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries of the Christian era.  From the conversion of Constantine to the Reformation the story of Christendom is unbroken; the later Roman Empire is the Church-State of a Christian Prince, as modern Europe is the Church-State of a nominally Christian society. Mediæval Europe thought of itself as nothing but the old world-state under religion; from Spain to Russia men were living under a Holy Roman Empire of an Italian, or Teutonic, or Byzantine, or independent type. England and Russia were not parts of the Germanic revival of Charlemagne, but they had just the same two elements dominant in their life: the classical tradition and the Christian Church."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18757"],["title","Prince Henry the Navigator, the Hero of Portugal and of Modern Discovery, (#8)"],["body"," so throughout this time, the expansion of this society--by whatever name we may call it, discovery, exploration, geographical knowledge--has a continuous history. But before the rise of Islam, in the seventh century, throws Christendom into its proper mediæval life, before the new religion begins the really new age, at the end of which lived Henry himself, we are too far from our subject to feel, for instance in the fourth and fifth-century pilgrims and in Cosmas Indicopleustes, anything but a remote preparation for Henry's work. It is only with the seventh century, and with the time of our own Bede and Wilfrid, that the necessary introduction to our subject really begins.  Yet as an illustration of the general idea, that discovery is an early and natural outlet of any vigorous society and is in proportion to the universal activity of the State, it is not without interest to note that Christian Pilgrimage begins with Constantine. This, the first department of exploring energy, at once evidences the new settlement of religion and politics. Helena, the Emperor's mother, helped, by her visit to Palestine, her church at Bethlehem, and her discoveries of relics in Jerusalem, to make a ruling fashion out of the custom of a few devotees; and eight years after the council of Nicæa, in 333, appeared the first Christian geography, as a guide-book or itinerary, from Bordeaux to the Holy Places of Syria, modelled upon the imperial survey of the Antonines. The route followed in this runs by North Italy, Aquileia, Sirmium, Constantinople, and Asia Minor, and upon the same course thousands of nameless pilgrims journeyed in the next three hundred years, besides some eight or nine who have left an account mainly religious in form, but containing in substance the widest view of the globe then possible among Westerns.  Most of the pilgrims, like Jerome's friend Paula, Bishop Eucherius, and Melania, tread the same path and stop at the same points, but three or four of them distinctly add some fresh knowledge to the ordinary results.  St. Silvia, of Aquitaine (_c._ 385), not only travels through Syria, she visits Lower Egypt and Stony or Sinaitic Arabia, and even Edessa in Northern Mesopotamia, on the very borders of hostile and heathen Persia. \"To see the monks\" she wanders through Osrhöene, comes to Haran, near which was \"the home of Abraham and the farm of Laban and the well of Rachel,\" to the environs of Nisibis and Ur of the Chaldees, lost to the Roman Empire since Julian's defeat; thence by \"Padan-aram\" back to Antioch. When crossing the Euphrates the pilgrims saw the river \"rush down in a torrent like the Rhone, but greater,\" and on the way home by the great military road, then untravelled by Saracens, between Tarsus and the Bosphorus, Silvia makes a passing note on the strength and brigand habits of the Isaurian mountaineers, who in the end saved Christendom from the very Arabs with whom our pilgrim couples them.  Again, Cosmas Indicopleustes, in the time of Justinian, is at the end, as Silvia is at the beginning, of a definite period, the period of the Christian empire of Rome, while still \"Cæsarean\" and not merely Byzantine, \"patrician\" and not papal, \"consular\" and not Carolingian.  And contemporary with Cosmas are two of the chief among the earlier or primitive pilgrims, Theodosius and Antoninus the Martyr. The first-named indulges in a few excursions--in fancy--beyond his known ground of Palestine, going as far east as Susa and Babylon, \"where no one can live for the serpents and hippo-centaurs,\" and south to the Red Sea and its two arms, \"of which the eastern is called the Persian Gulf,\" and the western or Arabian runs up to the \"thirteen cities of Arabia destroyed by Joshua,\"--but, for the rest, his knowledge is not extensive or peculiar. Antoninus of Placentia, on the other hand, is very interesting, a sort of older Mandeville, who mixes truth and its opposite in fairly even proportions and with a sort of resolute partiality to favourite legends.  He tells us how Tripolis has been ruined by the late earthquake (July 9, 551); how silk and various woven stuffs are sold at Tyre; how the pilgrims scratched their names on the relics shewn in Cana of Galilee--\"and here I, sinner that I am, did inscribe the names of my parents\"; how Bethshan, the metropolis of Galilee, \"is placed on a hill,\" though really in the plain; how the Samaritans hate Christians and will hardly speak to them; \"and beware of spitting in their country, for they will never forgive it\"; how \"the dew comes down upon Hermon the Little, as David says, 'The dew of Hermon that fell upon the hill of Zion'\"; how nothing can live or even float in the Dead Sea, \"but is instantly swallowed up\"--as exact an untruth as was ever told by traveller; how the Jordan opens a way for pilgrims \"and stands up in a heap every year at the Epiphany during the baptism of Catechumens, as David told, 'The sea saw that and fled, Jordan was driven back'\"; how at Jericho there is a Holy Field \"sown by the Lord with his own hand.\" A report had been spread that the salt pillar of Lot's wife had been \"lessened by licking\"; \"it was false,\" said Antoninus, the statue was just the same as it had always been.  In Jerusalem the pilgrims first went up the Tower of David, \"where he sang the Psalter,\" and into the Basilica of Sion, where among other marvels they saw the \"Corner-stone that the builders rejected,\" which gave out a \"sound like the murmuring of a crowd.\"  We come back again to fact with rather a start when told in the next section of the Hospitals for 3000 sick folk near the Church of St. Mary, close to Sion; then with the footprints and relics of Christ, and the miraculous flight of the Column of Scourging--\"carried away by a cloud to Cæsarea,\" we are taken through a fresh set of \"impressions.\"  The same wild notions of place and time and nature follow the Martyr through Galilee to Gilboa, \"where David slew Goliath and Saul died, where no dew or rain ever falls, and where devils appear nightly, whirled about like fleeces of wool or the waves of the sea\"--to Nazareth, where was the \"Beam of Christ the Carpenter\"--to Elua, where fifteen consecrated virgins had tamed a lion and trained it to live with them in a cell--to Egypt, where the Pyramids become for him the \"_twelve_ Barns of Joseph,\" for the legend had not yet insisted that the actual number should be made to fit the text of the seven years of plenty.  But with all this Antoninus now and then gives us glimpses of a larger world. In Jerusalem he meets Æthiopians \"with nostrils slit and rings about their fingers and their feet.\" They were so marked, they told him, by the Emperor Trajan \"for a sign.\"  In the Sinai desert he tells us of \"Saracen\" beggars and idolaters; in the Red Sea ports he sees \"ships from India\" laden with aromatics; he travels up the Nile to the Cataracts and describes the Nilometer at Assouan, and the crocodiles in the river; Alexandria he finds \"splendid but frivolous, a lover of pilgrims but swarming with heresies.\"  But far more wonderful than the practical jumble of Antoninus Martyr is the systematic nonsense of Cosmas, who invented or worked out a theory and scheme of the world, a \"Christian topography,\" which required nothing more than a complete disuse of human reason. His assurance was equal to his science.  It may have been his voyage to India, or his monastic profession, or his study of Scripture, or something unknown that made him take up the part of a Christian Aristotle; in any case he felt himself called into the field to support the cause of St. Augustine against infidelity, and to refute the \"anile fable\" of the Antipodes. Cosmas referred men back to Revelation on such matters, and his system was \"demonstrated from Scripture, concerning which a Christian is not allowed to doubt.\" Man by himself could not understand the world, but in the Bible it was all clear enough. And from the Bible this much was beyond dispute.  The universe is a flat parallelogram; and its length is exactly double of its breadth. In the centre of the universe is our world surrounded by the ocean, and by an outer world or ring where men lived before the Flood. Noah and his Ark came over sea from this to the present earth.  To the north of our world is a great hill, like the later Moslem and older Hindu \"Cupola of the Earth,\" which perhaps was Cosmas' own original. Round this the sun and moon revolve, making day and night as they appear or disappear behind it.  The sky consists of four walls meeting in the \"dome of heaven\" over the floor on which we live, and this sky is \"glued\" to the edges of the outer world, the world of the Patriarchs.  But this heaven is also cut in two by the firmament, lying between our atmosphere and that \"New Heaven and New Earth wherein dwelleth Righteousness\"; and the floor of this upper world is covered by the \"waters that be above the firmament\"; above this is Paradise, and below the firmament live the angels, as \"ministers\" and \"flaming fires\" and \"servants of God to men.\"  The proofs of this are simple, mainly resting on some five texts from the Old Testament and two passages of St. Paul.  First the Book of Genesis declared itself to be the \"Book of the Generation of the Heaven and the Earth\"--that is, of everything in the heavens, and the earth. But the \"old wives' fable of the Antipodes\" would make the heaven surround and contain the earth, and God's word would have to be changed \"These are the generations of the sky.\" For the same truth--the twofold and independent being of heaven and earth--Cosmas quotes the additional testimony of Abraham, David, Hosea, Isaiah, Zachariah, and Melchisedek, who clenched the case against the Antipodes. \"For how indeed could even rain be said to 'fall' or to 'descend,' as in the Psalms and the Gospels, in those regions where it could only be said to 'come up'?\"  Again, the world cannot be a globe, or sphere, or be suspended in mid-air, or in any sort "]]]
