I.--_Frontispiece._--Hardly had the ladder been properly placed than the king began to ascend.  II.--As the rain dripped more and more through the foliage of the oak, the king held his hat over the head of the young girl.  III.--D'Artagnan, reclining upon an immense straight-backed chair, with his legs not stretched out, but simply placed upon a stool, formed an angle of the most obtuse form that could possibly be seen.  IV.--De Guiche turned round also, and, at the moment the horse was quiet again, he fired, and the ball carried off De Wardes' hat from his head.  V.--Athos broke his sword across his knee, slowly placed the two pieces upon the floor, and saluting the king, who was almost choking from rage and shame, he quitted the cabinet.  VI.--Raoul, presenting his pistol, threw himself on the leader, commanding the coachman to stop.  VII.--Aramis saw that the young man was stretched upon his bed, his face half-concealed by his arms.  VIII.--\"You will look through the opening, which answers to one of the false windows made in the dome of the king's apartment. Can you see?\"  IX.--\"What is this, monsieur, and what is the meaning of this jest?\" \"It is no jest,\" replied in a deep voice the masked figure that held the lantern.  X.--The king entered into the cell without pronouncing a single word: he was pale and haggard.  XI.--They saw, by the red flashes of the lightning against the violet fog which the wind stamped upon the bankward sky, they saw pass gravely at six paces behind the governor, a man clothed in black and masked by a visor of polished steel, soldered to a helmet of the same nature, which altogether enveloped the whole of his head.  XII.--The Deathbed of Athos--\"Here I am!\"     THE  VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE.     CHAPTER I.  SHOWING WHAT NEITHER THE NAIAD NOR DRYAD HAD ANTICIPATED.   Saint-Aignan stopped at the foot of the staircase which led to the _entresol_, where the maids of honor were lodged, and to the first floor, where Madame's apartments were situated. Then, by means of one of the servants who was passing, he sent to apprise Malicorne, who was still with Monsieur. After having waited ten minutes, Malicorne arrived, looking full of suspicion and importance. The king drew back toward the darkest part of the vestibule. Saint-Aignan, on the contrary, advanced to meet him, but at the first words, indicating his wish, Malicorne drew back abruptly.  \"Oh! oh!\" he said, \"you want me to introduce you into the rooms of the maids of honor?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"You know very well that I cannot do anything of the kind, without being made acquainted with your object.\"  \"Unfortunately, my dear Monsieur Malicorne, it is quite impossible for me to give you any explanation: you must therefore confide in me as in a friend who got you out of a great difficulty yesterday, and who now begs you to draw him out of one to-day.\"  \"Yet, I told you, monsieur, what my object was; that my object was not to sleep out in the open air, and any man might express the same wish, while you, however, admit nothing.\"  \"Believe me, my dear Monsieur Malicorne,\" Saint-Aignan persisted, \"that if I were permitted to explain myself, I would do so.\"  \"In that case, my dear monsieur, it is impossible for me to allow you to enter Mademoiselle de Montalais's apartment.\"  \"Why so?\"  \"You know why better than any one else, since you caught me on the wall paying my addresses to Mademoiselle de Montalais; it would, therefore, be an excess of kindness, on my part, you will admit, since I am paying my attentions to her, to open the door of her room to you.\"  \"But who told you it was on her account I asked you for the key?\"  \"For whom, then?\"  \"She does not lodge there alone, I suppose?\"  \"No, certainly; for Mademoiselle de la Valliere shares her rooms with her; but, really, you have nothing more to do with Mademoiselle de la Valliere than with Mademoiselle de Montalais, and there are only two men to whom I would give this key; to M. de Bragelonne, if he begged me to give it him, and to the king if he ordered me to do so.\"  \"In that case, give me the key, monsieur, I order you to do so,\" said the king, advancing from the obscurity, and partially opening his cloak. \"Mademoiselle de Montalais will step down to talk with you, while we go upstairs to Mademoiselle de la Valliere, for, in fact, it is she only whom we require.\"  \"The king,\" exclaimed Malicorne, bowing down to the very ground.  \"Yes, the king,\" said Louis, smiling, \"the king, who is as pleased with your resistance as with your capitulation. Rise, monsieur, and render us the service we request of you.\"  \"I obey your majesty,\" said Malicorne, leading the way up the staircase.  \"Get Mademoiselle de Montalais to come down,\" said the king, \"and do not breathe a word to her of my visit.\"  Malicorne bowed in sign of obedience, and proceeded up the staircase. But the king, after a hasty reflection, followed him, and that, too, with such rapidity, that although Malicorne was already more than half-way up the staircase, the king reached the room at the same moment he did. He then observed by the door which remained half-opened behind Malicorne, La Valliere, sitting in an armchair with her head thrown back, and in the opposite corner Montalais, who, in her dressing-gown, was standing before a looking-glass, engaged in arranging her hair, and parleying all the while with Malicorne. The king hurriedly opened the door, and entered the room. Montalais called out at the noise made by the opening of the door, and, recognizing the king, made her escape. La Valliere rose from her seat, like a dead person who had been galvanized, and then fell back again in her armchair. The king advanced slowly toward her.  \"You wished for an audience, I believe,\" he said, coldly; \"I am ready to hear you. Speak.\"  Saint-Aignan, faithful to his character of being deaf, blind, and dumb, had stationed himself in a corner of the door, upon a stool which he fortuitously found there. Concealed by the tapestry which covered the doorway, and leaning his back against the wall, he could in this way listen without been seen; resigning himself to the post of a good watch-dog, who patiently waits and watches without ever getting in his master's way.  La Valliere, terror-stricken at the king's irritated aspect, again rose a second time, and assuming a posture of humility and entreaty, murmured, \"Forgive me, sire.\"  \"What need is there for my forgiveness?\" asked Louis.  \"Sire, I have been guilty of a great fault; nay, more than a great fault, a great crime.\"  \"You?\"  \"Sire, I have offended your majesty.\"  \"Not the slightest degree in the world,\" replied Louis XIV.  \"I implore you, sire, not to maintain toward me that terrible seriousness of manner which reveals your majesty's just anger. I feel I have offended you, sire; but I wish to explain to you how it was that I have not offended you of my own accord.\"  \"In the first place,\" said the king, \"in what way can you possibly have offended me? I cannot perceive how. Surely not on account of a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18997"],["title","The Vicomte de Bragelonne; Or, Ten Years Later (#2)"],["body","girl's harmless and very innocent jest? You turned the credulity of a young man into ridicule--it was very natural to do so; any other woman in your place would have done the same.\"  \"Oh! your majesty overwhelms me by your remark.\"  \"Why so?\"  \"Because if I had been the author of the jest, it would not have been innocent.\"  \"Well! is that all you had to say to me in soliciting an audience?\" said the king, as though about to turn away.  Thereupon, La Valliere, in an abrupt and broken voice, her eyes dried up by the fire of her tears, made a step toward the king, and said, \"Did your majesty hear everything?\"  \"Everything, what?\"  \"Everything I said beneath the royal oak.\"  \"I did not lose a syllable.\"  \"And when your majesty heard me, you were able to think I had abused your credulity.\"  \"Credulity; yes, indeed you have selected the very word.\"  \"And your majesty did not suppose that a poor girl like myself might possibly be compelled to submit to the will of others.\"  \"Forgive me,\" returned the king; \"but I shall never be able to understand that she, who of her own free will could express herself so unreservedly beneath the royal oak, would allow herself to be influenced to such an extent by the direction of others.\"  \"But the threat held out against me, sire.\"  \"Threat! who threatened you--who dared to threaten you?\"  \"They who have the right to do so, sire.\"  \"I do not recognize any one as possessing the right to threaten in my kingdom.\"  \"Forgive me, sire, but near your majesty, even, there are persons sufficiently high in position to have, or to believe that they possess, the right of injuring a young girl, without fortune, and possessing only her reputation.\"  \"In what way injure her?\"  \"In depriving her of her reputation, by disgracefully expelling her from the court.\"  \"Oh! Mademoiselle de la Valliere,\" said the king, bitterly, \"I prefer those persons who exculpate themselves without incriminating others.\"  \"Sire!\"  \"Yes; and I confess that I greatly regret to perceive that an easy justification, as your own might be, should have been complicated in my presence by a tissue of reproaches and imputations against others.\"  \"And which you do not believe?\" exclaimed La Valliere. The king remained silent.  \"Nay, but tell me!\" repeated La Valliere, vehemently.  \"I regret to confess it,\" replied the king, bowing coldly.  The young girl uttered a deep groan, striking her hands together in despair. \"You do not believe me, then,\" she said to the king, who still remained silent, while poor La Valliere's features became visibly changed at his continued silence. \"Therefore, you believe,\" she said, \"that I settled this ridiculous, this infamous plot, of trifling, in so shameless a manner, with your majesty.\"  \"Nay,\" said the king, \"it is neither ridiculous nor infamous, it is not even a plot; it is merely a jest, more or less amusing, and nothing more.\"  \"Oh!\" murmured the young girl, \"the king does not, and will not, believe me, then?\"  \"No, indeed, I will not believe you,\" said the king. \"Besides, in point of fact, what can be more natural? The king, you argue, follows me, listens to me, watches me; the king wishes perhaps to amuse himself at my expense, I will amuse myself at his, and as the king is very tender-hearted, I will take his heart by storm.\"  La Valliere hid her face in her hands, as she stifled her sobs. The king continued most pitilessly, he revenged himself upon the poor victim before him for all that he had himself suffered.  \"Let us invent, then, this story of my loving him and preferring him to others. The king is so simple and so conceited that he will believe me; and then we can go and tell others how credulous the king is, and can enjoy a laugh at his expense.\"  \"Oh!\" exclaimed La Valliere, \"to think that, to believe that! it is frightful.\"  \"And,\" pursued the king, \"that is not all; if this self-conceited prince should take our jest seriously, if he should be imprudent enough to exhibit before others anything like delight at it, well, in that case, the king will be humiliated before the whole court; and what a delightful story it will be, too, for him to whom I am really attached, a part of my dowry for my husband, to have the adventure to relate of the king who was so amusingly deceived by a young girl.\"  \"Sire!\" exclaimed La Valliere, her mind bewildered, almost wandering, indeed, \"not another word, I implore you; do you not see that you are killing me?\"  \"A jest, nothing but a jest,\" murmured the king, who, however, began to be somewhat affected.  La Valliere fell upon her knees, and that so violently, that their sound could be heard upon the hard floor. \"Sire,\" she said, \"I prefer shame to disloyalty.\"  \"What do you mean?\" inquired the king, without moving a step to raise the young girl from her knees.  \"Sire, when I shall have sacrificed my honor and my reason both to you, you will perhaps believe in my loyalty. The tale which was related to you in Madame's apartments, and by Madame herself, is utterly false; and that which I said beneath the great oak--\"  \"Well!\"  \"That only is the truth.\"  \"What!\" exclaimed the king.  \"Sire,\" exclaimed La Valliere, hurried away by the violence of her emotions, \"were I to die of shame on the very spot where my knees are fixed, I would repeat it until my latest breath; I said that I loved you, and it is true; I do love you.\"  \"You!\"  \"I have loved you, sire, from the very day first I saw you; from the moment when at Blois, where I was pining away my existence, your royal looks, full of light and life, were first bent upon me. I love you still, sire; it is a crime of high treason, I know, that a poor girl like myself should love her sovereign and should presume to tell him so. Punish me for my audacity, despise me for my shameless immodesty; but do not ever say, do not ever think, that I have jested with or deceived you. I belong to a family whose loyalty has been proved, sire; and I, too, love my king.\"  Suddenly her strength, voice, and respiration ceased, and she fell forward, like the flower Virgil alludes to, which the scythe of the reaper touched as it passed over. The king, at these words, at this vehement entreaty, no longer retained either ill-will or doubt in his mind; his whole heart seemed to expand at the glowing breath of an affection which proclaimed itself in such a noble and courageous language. When, therefore, he heard the passionate confession of that young girl's affection, his strength seemed to fail him, and he hid his face in his hands. But when he felt La Valliere's hands clinging to his own, when their warm pressure fired his blood, he bent forward, and passing his arm round La Valliere's waist, he raised her from the ground and pressed her against his heart. But she, her drooping head fallen forward on her bosom, seemed to have ceased to live. The king, terrified, called out for Saint-Aignan. Saint-Aignan, who had carried his discretion so far as to remain without stirring in his corner, pretending to wipe away a tear, ran forward at the king's summons. He then assisted Louis to seat the young girl upon a couch, slapped her hands, sprinkled some Hungary water over her face, calling out all the while, \"Come, come, it is all over; the king believes you, and forgives you. There, there now! take care, or you will agitate his majesty too much; his majesty is so sensitive, so tender-hearted. Now, really, Mademoiselle de la Valliere, you must pay attention, for the king is very pale.\"  The fact was, the king was visibly losing color. But La Valliere did not move.  \"Do pray recover,\" continued Saint-Aignan, \"I beg, I implore you; it is really time you should; think only of one thing, that if the king should become unwell, I should be obliged to summon his physician. What a state of things that would be! So do pray rouse yourself; make an effort, pray do, and do it at once, too.\"  It was difficult to display more persuasive eloquence than Saint-Aignan did, but something still more powerful and of a more energetic nature than this eloquence aroused La Valliere. The king, who was kneeling before her, covered the palms of her hands with those burning kisses which are to the hands what a kiss upon the lips is to the face. La Valliere's senses returned to her; she languidly opened her eyes, and, with a dying look, murmured, \"Oh! sire, has your majesty pardoned me, then?\"  The king did not reply, for he was still too much overcome. Saint-Aignan thought it his duty again to retire, for he observed the passionate devotion which was displayed in the king's gaze. La Valliere arose.  \"And now, sire, that I have justified myself, at least I trust so in your majesty's eyes, grant me leave to retire into a convent. I shall bless your majesty all my life, and I shall die there thanking and loving Heaven for having granted me one day of perfect happiness.\"  \"No, no,\" replied the king, \"you will live here blessing Heaven, on the contrary, but loving Louis, who will make your existence one of perfect felicity--Louis who loves you--Louis who swears it.\"  \"Oh! sire, sire!\"  And upon this doubt of La Valliere, the king's kisses became so warm that Saint-Aignan thought it his duty to retire behind the tapestry. These kisses however, which she had not had the strength at first to resist, began to intimidate the young girl.  \"Oh! sire,\" she exclaimed, \"do not make me repent my loyalty, for it would show me that your majesty despises me still.\"  \"Mademoiselle de la Valliere,\" said the king, suddenly, drawing back with an air full of respect, \"there is nothing in the world that I love and honor more than yourself, and nothing in my court, I call Heaven to witness, shall be so highly regarded as you shall be henceforward. I entreat your forgiveness for my transport; it arose from an excess of affection, but I can prove to you that I shall love still more than ever by respecting you as much as you can possibly desire.\" Then bending before her, and taking her by"]]]
