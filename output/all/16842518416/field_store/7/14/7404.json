As they released our hands, with the always surprising strength that is part of the dancing woman's stock-in-trade, they slipped behind us suddenly and thrust us forward through the curtains.  There was not much to see in front of us. We found ourselves in a paneled corridor, whose narrow windows overlooked the river, facing a painted door sixty paces distant at the farther end. King strode down the corridor and knocked.  The answer was one word that I did not catch, although it rang like a suddenly struck chord of music, and the door yielded to the pressure of King's hand.  I entered behind him and the door swung shut of its own weight with a click. We were in a high-ceilinged, very long room, having seven sides. There were windows to right and left. A deep divan piled with scented cushions occupied the whole length of one long wall, and there were several huge cushions on the floor against another wall. There was one other door besides that we had entered by.  We stood in that room alone, but I know that King felt as uneasy as I did, for there was sweat on the back of his neck. We were being watched by unseen eyes. There is no mistaking that sensation.  Suddenly a voice broke silence like a golden bell whose overtones go widening in rings into infinity, and a vision of loveliness parted the curtains of that other door.  \"My lord comes as is meet--spurred, and ready to give new kingdoms to his king! Oh, how my lord is welcome!\" she said in Persian.  Her voice thrilled you, because of its perfect resonance, exactly in the middle of the note. She looked into King's eyes with challenging familiarity that made him smile, and then eyed me wonderingly. She glanced from me to a picture on the wall in blue of the Elephant-god--enormous, opulent, urbane, and then back again at me, and smiled very sweetly.  \"So you have brought Ganesha with you? The god of good luck! How wonderful! How does one behave toward a real god?\"  And while she said that she laid her hands on King's arms as naturally as if he were a lover whom she had not seen perhaps since yesterday. Plainly, there was absolutely nothing between him and her except his own obstinate independence. She was his if he wanted her.  She took King's hand with a laugh that had its roots in past companionship and led him to the middle, deepest window-seat, beneath which the river could be heard gurgling busily.  Then, when she had drawn the silken hangings until the softened light suggested lingering, uncounted hours, and had indicated with a nod to me a cushion in the corner, she came and lay on the cushions close to King, chin on hand, where she could watch his eyes.  King sat straight and square, watching her with caution that he did not trouble to conceal. She took his hand and raised the sleeve until the broad, gold, graven bracelet showed.  \"That link forged in the past must bind us two more surely than an oath,\" she said smiling.  \"I used it to show to the gatekeeper.\"  He sat cooly waiting for her next remark. And with almost unnecessary candor began to remove the bracelet and offer it back to her. So she unmasked her batteries, with a delicious little rippling laugh and a lazy, cat-like movement that betokened joy in the danger that was coming, if I know anything at all of what sign-language means.  \"I knew that very day that you resigned your commission in the army, and I laughed with delight at the news, knowing that the gods who are our servants had contrived it. I know why thou art here,\" she said; and the change from you to thou was not haphazard.  \"It is well known, Princess, that your spies are the cleverest in India,\" King answered.  \"Spies? I need no spies as long as old India lives. Friends are better.\"  \"Do all princesses break their promises?\" he countered, meeting her eyes steadily.  \"Never yet did I break one promise, whether it was for good or evil.\"  \"Princess,\" he answered, looking sternly at her, \"in Jamrud Fort you agreed to take no part again in politics, national or international in return for a promise of personal freedom and permission to reside in India.\"  \"My promise was dependent on my liberty. But is this liberty--to be forced to reside in this old palace, with the spies of the Government keeping watch on my doings, except when they chance to be outwitted? Nevertheless, I have kept my promise. Thou knowest me better than to think that I need to break promises in order to outwit a government of Englishmen!\"  \"Quibbles won't help, Princess,\" he answered. \"You promised to do nothing that Government might object to.\"  \"Well; will they object to my religion?\" she retorted, mocking him. \"Has the British _raj_ at last screwed up its courage to the point of trespassing behind the purdah and blundering in among religious exercises?\"  No man in his senses ever challenges a woman's argument until he knows the whole of it and has unmasked its ulterior purpose. So King sat still and said nothing, knowing that that was precisely what she did not want.  \"You must make terms with me, heaven-born!\" she went on, changing her tone to one of rather more suggestive firmness. \"The _Kali-Yug_ (age of darkness) is drawing to a close, and India awakes! There is froth on the surface--a rising here, an agitation there, a deal of wild talk everywhere, and the dead old government proposes to suppress it in the dead old ways, like men with paddles seeking to beat the waves down flat! But the winds of God blow, and the boat of the men with the paddles will be upset presently. Who then shall ride the storm? Their gunners will be told to shoot the froth as it forms and rises! But if there is a wise man anywhere he will make terms with me, and will set himself to guide the underlying forces that may otherwise whelm everything. I think thou art wise, my heaven-born. Thou wert wise once on a time.\"  \"Do you think you can rule India?\" King asked her; and he did not make the mistake of suggesting ridicule.  \"Who else can do it?\" she retorted. \"Do you think we come into the world to let fate be our master? Why have I royal blood and royal views, wealth, understanding and ambition, while the others have blindness and vague yearnings? Can you answer?\"  \"Princess,\" he answered, \"I had only one object in coming here.\"  \"I know that,\" she said nodding.  \"I have simply come to warn you.\"  \"_Chut!_\" she answered with her chin between her hands and her elbows deep in the cushions. \"I know how much is known. This man--what is his name? Ramsden? Pouff! Ganesha, here, is far better! Ganesha is from America. Those fools who went to prepare the American mind for what is coming, because they were altogether too foolish to be anything but in the way in India, have been found out, and Ganesha has come like a big bull-buffalo to save the world by thrusting his clumsy horns into things he does not understand! I tell you, Athelstan, that however much is known there is much more that is not known. You would better make terms with me!\"  \"What you must understand, Princess, is that your plan to overthrow the West and make the East the world's controlling force, is known by those who can prevent you,\" he answered quietly. \"You see, I can't go away from here and tell whoever asks me that you are observing your promise to----\"  \"No,\" she interrupted with a ringing merry laugh of triumph. \"You speak truth without knowing it! You can not go away!\"  Princess Yasmini's boast was good. But we had come to solve a problem, not to run away with it, and she looked disconcerted by our rather obvious willingness to be her prisoners for a while.  \"Do you think I can not be cruel?\" she asked suddenly.  \"I have seen you at your worst, as well as at your best!\" King answered.  \"You act like a man who has resources. Yet you have none,\" she answered slowly, as if reviewing all the situation in her mind. \"None knows where you are--not even Mulji Singh, with whom you left your other clothes before putting on that uniform the better to impress me! The bag that you and Ganesha share between you, like two mendicants emerging from the jail, is now in a room in this palace. You came because you saw that if I should be arrested there would be insurrection. You said so to Ommony sahib, and his butler overheard. But not even Ommony knows where you are. He said to you: 'If you can defeat that woman without using violence, you'll stand alone in the world as the one man who could do it. But if you use violence, though you kill her, she will defeat you and all the rest of us.' Is not that what your Friend Ommony said?\"  \"What kind of terms do you want me to make with you, Princess?\" King answered.  \"I can make you ruler of all India!\" she said. \"Another may wear the baubles, but thou shalt be the true king, even as thy name is! And behind thee, me, Yasmini, whispering wisdom and laughing to see the politicians strut!\"  King leaned back and laughed at her.  \"Do you really expect me to help you ruin my own countrymen, go back on my color, creed, education, oath and everything, and----\"  \"Deluded fools! The East--the East, Athelstan, is waking! Better make terms with me, and thou shalt live to ride on the arising East as God rides on the wind and bits and governs it!\"  \"Very well,\" he said. \"Show me. I'll do nothing blindfold.\"  \"Hah! Thou art not half-conquered yet,\" she laughed. \"And what of Ganesha? Is this mountain of bones and thews a person to be trusted, or shall we show him how much stronger than him is a horsehair in a clever woman's fingers?\"  \"This man Ramsden is my friend,\" King said.  \"Are you _his_ friend?\" she retorted.  He nodded.  \"You are going to see the naked heart of India!\" she said. \"Better to have your eyes burned out now than see that and be false to it afterward!\"  Then, since we failed to order red-hot needles for our eyes, she cried out once--one clear note that sounded almost exactly as if she had struck a silver"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18970"],["title","Caves of Terror (#3)"],["body","ong. A woman entered like the living echo to it. Yasmini spoke, and the woman disappeared again.  Below us the river swallowed and gurgled along the palace wall, and we caught the occasional thumping of a boat-pole. The thumping ceased exactly underneath us, and a man began singing in the time-hallowed language of Rajasthan. I think he was looking upward as he sang, for each word reached its goal.      \"Oh warm and broad the plow land lies,     The idle oxen wait!     We pray thee, holy river, rise,     Nor glut thy fields too late!     The year awakes! The slumbering seed     Swells to its birth! Oh river, heed!\"  \"Strange time of year for that song, Princess! Is that one of your spies?\" asked King, not too politely.  \"One of my friends,\" she answered. \"I told you: India awakes! But watch.\"  It was growing dark. Two women came and drew the curtains closer. Other women brought lamps and set them on stools along one wall; others again brought tapers and lit the candles in the hydra-headed candelabra.  \"It is really too light yet,\" Yasmini grumbled, as if the gods who marshal in the night had not kept faith with her. But even so, the shadows danced among India's gods on the wall facing the row of stools.  Then there began wood-wind music, made by musicians out of sight, low and sweet, suggesting unimaginable mysteries, and one by one through the curtains opposite there came in silently seven women on bare feet that hardly touched the carpet; and all the stories about nautch girls, all the travelers' tales of how Eastern women dance with their arms, not feet, vanished that instant into the kingdom of lies. This was dancing--art absolute. They no longer seemed to be flesh and blood women possessed of weight and other limitations; their footfall was hardly audible, and you could not hear them breathe at all. They were like living shadows, and they danced the way the shadows of the branches do on a jungle clearing when a light breeze makes the trees laugh.  It had some sort of mystic meaning no doubt, although I did not understand it; but what I did understand was that the whole arrangement was designed to produce a sort of mesmerism in the beholder.  However, school yourself to live alone and think alone for a quarter of a century or so, meeting people only as man to man instead of like a sheep among a flock of sheep, and you become immune to that sort of thing.  The Princess Yasmini seemed to realize that neither King nor I were being drawn into the net of dreaminess that those trained women of hers were weaving.  \"Watch!\" said Yasmini suddenly. And then we saw what very few men have been priviliged to see.  She joined the dance; and you knew then who had taught those women. Theirs had been after all a mere interpretation: of her vision. Hers was the vision itself.  She was _It_--the thing itself--no more an interpretation than anything in nature is. Yasmini became India--India's heart; and I suppose that if King and I had understood her we would have been swept into her vortex, as it were, like drops of water into an ocean.  She was unrestrained by any need, or even willingness to explain herself. She was talking the same language that the nodding blossoms and the light and shadow talk that go chasing each other across the hillsides. And while you watched you seemed to know all sorts of things--secrets that disappeared from your mind a moment afterward.  She began singing presently, commencing on the middle F as every sound in nature does and disregarding conventional limitations just as she did when dancing. She sang first of the emptiness before the worlds were made. She sang of the birth of peoples; of the history of peoples.  She sang of India as the mother of all speech, song, race and knowledge; of truths that every great thinker since the world's beginning has propounded; and of India as the home of all of them, until, whether you would or not, at least you seemed to see the undeniable truth of that.  And then, in a weird, wild, melancholy minor key came the story of the _Kali-Yug_--the age of darkness creeping over India, condemning her for her sins. She sang of India under the hoof of ugliness and ignorance and plague, and yet of a few who kept the old light burning in secret--of hidden books, and of stuff that men call magic handed down the centuries from lip to lip in caves and temple cellars and mountain fastnesses, wherever the mysteries were safe from profane eyes.  And then the key changed again, striking that fundamental middle F that is the mother-note of all the voices of nature and, as Indians maintain, of the music of the spheres as well. Music and song and dance became laughter. Doubt vanished, for there seemed nothing left to doubt, as she began to sing of India rising at last, again triumphant over darkness, mother of the world and of all the nations of the world, awake, unconquerable.  Never was another song like that one! Nor was there ever such a climax. As she finished on a chord of triumph that seemed like a new spirit bursting the bonds of ancient mystery and sank to the floor among her women, there stood the Gray Mahatma in their midst, not naked any longer, but clothed from head to heel in a saffron-colored robe, and without his paste of ashes.  He stood like a statue with folded arms, his yellow eyes blazing and his look like a lion's; and how he had entered the room I confess I don't know to this hour, nor does Athelstan King, who is a trained observer of unusual happenings. Both doors were closed, and I will take oath that neither had been opened since the women entered.  \"Peace!\" was his first word, spoken like one in authority, who ordered peace and dared to do it.  He stood looking for more than a minute at King and me with, I think, just a flicker of scorn on his thin lips, as if he were wondering whether we were men enough to face the ordeal before us. Then indefinably, yet quite perceptibly his mood changed and his appearance with it. He held his right hand out.  \"Will you not shake hands with me?\" he asked smiling.  Now that was a thing that no sanctimonious Brahman would have dreamed of doing, for fear of being defiled by the touch of a casteless foreigner; so he was either above or below the caste laws, and it is common knowledge how those who are below caste cringe and toady. So he evidently reckoned himself above it, and the Indian who can do that has met and overcome more tyranny and terrors than the West knows anything about.  I wish I could make exactly clear what happened when I took his outstretched hand.  His fingers closed on mine with a grip like marble. There are few men who are stronger than I am; I can outlift a stage professional; yet I could no more move his hand or pull mine free than if he had been a bronze image with my hand set solid in the casting.  \"That is for your own good,\" he said pleasantly, letting go at last. \"That other man knows better, but you might have been so unwise as to try using violence.\"  \"I'm glad you had that experience,\" said King in a low voice, as I went back to the window-seat. \"Don't let yourself be bewildered by it. There's an explanation for everything. They know something that we don't, that's all.\"     CHAPTER III  FEAR IS DEATH   At a sign from the Gray Mahatma all the women except Yasmini left the room. Yasmini seemed to be in a strange mood mixed of mischief and amused anticipation.  The Mahatma sat down exactly in the middle of the carpet, and his method was unique. It looked just as if an unseen hand had taken him by the hair and lowered him gradually, for he crossed his legs and dropped to the floor as evenly and slowly as one of those freight elevators that disappear beneath the city side-walks.  He seemed to attach a great deal of importance to his exact position and glanced repeatedly at the walls as if to make sure that he was not sitting an inch or two too far to the right or left; however, he had gauged his measurements exactly at the first attempt and did not move, once he was seated.  \"You two _sahibs_,\" he began, with a slight emphasis on the word _sahib_, as if he wished to call attention to the fact that he was according us due courtesy, \"you two honorable gentlemen,\" he continued, as if mere courtesy perhaps were not enough, \"have been chosen unknown to yourselves. For there is but one Chooser, whose choice is never known until the hour comes. For the chosen there is no road back again. Even if you should prefer death, your death could not now be of your own choosing; for, having been chosen, there is no escape from service to the Purpose, and though you would certainly die if courage failed you, your death would be more terrible than life, since it would serve the Purpose without benefiting you.  \"You are both honest men,\" he continued, \"for the one has resigned honors and emoluments in the army for the sake of serving India; the other has accepted toilsome service under a man who seeks, however mistakenly, to serve the world. If you were not honest you would never have been chosen. If you had made no sacrifices of your own free will, you would not have been acceptable.\"  Yasmini clasped her hands and laid her chin on them among the cushions. She was reveling in intellectual enjoyment, as sinfully I daresay as some folk revel in more material delights. The Mahatma took no notice of her, but continued.  \"You have heard of the _Kali-Yug_, the age of darkness. It is at an end. The nations presently begin to beat swords into plowshares because the time has come. But there is yet much else to do, and the eyes of those who have lived so long in darkness are but blinded for the present by the light, so that guides are needed, who can see. You two shall see--a little!\"  It was becoming intolerably hot in the room with the curtains drawn and all those lights burning, but I seemed to be the only one who minded it. The candles in the chandelier were kept from collapsing by metal sheaths, but the very flames"]]]
