Then ensued the delightful and stimulating hour that has now become a feature of the day; an hour in which the remembrance of the table-d'hote dinner at the Hydro, going on at identically the same time, only stirs me to a keener joy and gratitude.  {Honking and hissing like a bewildered orchestra: p23.jpg}  {Harried and pecked by the big geese: p24.jpg}  The ducks swim round in circles, hide under the willows, and attempt to creep into the rat-holes in the banks, a stupidity so crass that it merits instant death, which it somehow always escapes.  Then they come out in couples and waddle under the wrong fence into the lower meadow, fly madly under the tool-house, pitch blindly in with the sitting hens, and out again in short order, all the time quacking and squawking, honking and hissing like a bewildered orchestra.  By dint of splashing the water with poles, throwing pebbles, beating the shrubs at the pond's edges, \"shooing\" frantically with our skirts, crawling beneath bars to head them off, and prodding them from under bushes to urge them on, we finally get the older ones out of the water and the younger ones into some sort of relation to their various retreats; but, owing to their lack of geography, hatred of home, and general recalcitrancy, they none of them turn up in the right place and have to be sorted out.  We uncover the top of the little house, or the enclosure as it may be, or reach in at the door, and, seizing the struggling victim, drag him forth and take him where he should have had the wit to go in the first instance.  The weak ones get in with the strong and are in danger of being trampled; two May goslings that look almost full-grown have run into a house with a brood of ducklings a week old.  There are twenty-seven crowded into one coop, five in another, nineteen in another; the gosling with one leg has to come out, and the duckling threatened with the gapes; their place is with the \"invaleeds,\" as Phoebe calls them, but they never learn the location of the hospital, nor have the slightest scruple about spreading contagious diseases.  {In solitary splendour: p25.jpg}  Finally, when we have separated and sorted exhaustively, an operation in which Phoebe shows a delicacy of discrimination and a fearlessness of attack amounting to genius, we count the entire number and find several missing.  Searching for their animate or inanimate bodies, we \"scoop\" one from under the tool-house, chance upon two more who are being harried and pecked by the big geese in the lower meadow, and discover one sailing by himself in solitary splendour in the middle of the deserted pond, a look of evil triumph in his bead-like eye.  Still we lack one young duckling, and he at length is found dead by the hedge.  A rat has evidently seized him and choked him at a single throttle, but in such haste that he has not had time to carry away the tiny body.  \"Poor think!\" says Phoebe tearfully; \"it looks as if it was 'it with some kind of a wepping.  I don't know whatever to do with the rats, they're gettin' that fearocious!\"  Before I was admitted into daily contact with the living goose (my previous intercourse with him having been carried on when gravy and stuffing obscured his true personality), I thought him a very Dreyfus among fowls, a sorely slandered bird, to whom justice had never been done; for even the gentle Darwin is hard upon him.  My opinion is undergoing some slight modifications, but I withhold judgment at present, hoping that some of the follies, faults, vagaries, and limitations that I observe in Phoebe's geese may be due to Phoebe's educational methods, which were, before my advent, those of the darkest ages.     CHAPTER IV   {Dryshod warnings which are never heeded: p27.jpg}  July 9th.  By the time the ducks and geese are incarcerated for the night, the reasonable, sensible, practical-minded hens--especially those whose mentality is increased and whose virtue is heightened by the responsibilities of motherhood--have gone into their own particular rat- proof boxes, where they are waiting in a semi-somnolent state to have the wire doors closed, the bricks set against them, and the bits of sacking flung over the tops to keep out the draught.  We have a great many young families, both ducklings and chicks, but we have no duck mothers at present.  The variety of bird which Phoebe seems to have bred during the past year may be called the New Duck, with certain radical ideas about woman's sphere.  What will happen to Thornycroft if we develop a New Hen and a New Cow, my imagination fails to conceive.  There does not seem to be the slightest danger for the moment, however, and our hens lay and sit and sit and lay as if laying and sitting were the twin purposes of life.  {The mother goes off to bed: p28.jpg}  The nature of the hen seems to broaden with the duties of maternity, but I think myself that we presume a little upon her amiability and natural motherliness.  It is one thing to desire a family of one's own, to lay eggs with that idea in view, to sit upon them three long weeks and hatch out and bring up a nice brood of chicks.  It must be quite another to have one's eggs abstracted day by day and eaten by a callous public, the nest filled with deceitful substitutes, and at the end of a dull and weary period of hatching to bring into the world another person's children--children, too, of the wrong size, the wrong kind of bills and feet, and, still more subtle grievance, the wrong kind of instincts, leading them to a dangerous aquatic career, one which the mother may not enter to guide, guard, and teach; one on the brink of which she must ever stand, uttering dryshod warnings which are never heeded.  They grow used to this strange order of things after a bit, it is true, and are less anxious and excited.  When the duck-brood returns safely again and again from what the hen-mother thinks will prove a watery grave, she becomes accustomed to the situation, I suppose.  I find that at night she stands by the pond for what she considers a decent, self-respecting length of time, calling the ducklings out of the water; then, if they refuse to come, the mother goes off to bed and leaves them to Providence, or Phoebe.  {Cornelia and the web-footed Gracchi: p29.jpg}  The brown hen that we have named Cornelia is the best mother, the one who waits longest and most patiently for the web-footed Gracchi to finish their swim.  When a chick is taken out of the incubytor (as Phoebe calls it) and refused by all the other hens, Cornelia generally accepts it, though she had twelve of her own when we began using her as an orphan asylum.  \"Wings are made to stretch,\" she seems to say cheerfully, and with a kind glance of her round eye she welcomes the wanderer and the outcast.  She even tended for a time the offspring of an absent-minded, light-headed pheasant who flew over a four-foot wall and left her young behind her to starve; it was not a New Pheasant, either; for the most conservative and old-fashioned of her tribe occasionally commits domestic solecisms of this sort.  {An orphan asylum: p30.jpg}  There is no telling when, where, or how the maternal instinct will assert itself.  Among our Thornycroft cats is a certain Mrs. Greyskin.  She had not been seen for many days, and Mrs. Heaven concluded that she had hidden herself somewhere with a family of kittens; but as the supply of that article with us more than equals the demand, we had not searched for her with especial zeal.  {Phoebe and I followed her stealthily: p31.jpg}  The other day Mrs. Greyskin appeared at the dairy door, and when she had been fed Phoebe and I followed her stealthily, from a distance.  She walked slowly about as if her mind were quite free from harassing care, and finally approached a deserted cow-house where there was a great mound of straw.  At this moment she caught sight of us and turned in another direction to throw us off the scent.  We persevered in our intention of going into her probable retreat, and were cautiously looking for some sign of life in the haymow, when we heard a soft cackle and a ruffling of plumage.  Coming closer to the sound we saw a black hen brooding a nest, her bright bead eyes turning nervously from side to side; and, coaxed out from her protecting wings by youthful curiosity, came four kittens, eyes wide open, warm, happy, ready for sport!  The sight was irresistible, and Phoebe ran for Mr. and Mrs. Heaven and the Square Baby.  Mother Hen was not to be embarrassed or daunted, even if her most sacred feelings were regarded in the light of a cheap entertainment.  She held her ground while one of the kits slid up and down her glossy back, and two others, more timid, crept underneath her breast, only daring to put out their pink noses!  We retired then for very shame and met Mrs. Greyskin in the doorway.  This should have thickened the plot, but there is apparently no rivalry nor animosity between the co-mothers.  We watch them every day now, through a window in the roof.  Mother Greyskin visits the kittens frequently, lies down beside the home nest, and gives them their dinner.  While this is going on Mother Blackwing goes modestly away for a bite, a sup, and a little exercise, returning to the kittens when the cat leaves them.  It is pretty to see her settle down over the four, fat, furry dumplings, and they seem to know no difference in warmth or comfort, whichever mother is brooding them; while, as their eyes have been open for a week, it can no longer be called a blind error on their part.  {Coaxed out . . . by youthful curiosity: p33.jpg}  When we have closed all our small hen-nurseries for the night, there is still the large house inhabited by the thirty-two full-grown chickens which Phoebe calls the broilers.  I cannot endure the term, and will not use it.  \"Now for the April"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1867"],["title","The Diary of a Goose Girl (#3)"],["body","hicks,\" I say every evening.  \"Do you mean the broilers?\" asks Phoebe.  \"I mean the big April chicks,\" say I.  \"Yes, them are the broilers,\" says she.  But is it not disagreeable enough to be a broiler when one's time comes, without having the gridiron waved in one's face for weeks beforehand?  {Nine huddle together: p34.jpg}  The April chicks are all lively and desirous of seeing the world as thoroughly as possible before going to roost or broil.  As a general thing, we find in the large house sixteen young fowls of the contemplative, flavourless, resigned-to-the-inevitable variety; three more (the same three every night) perch on the roof and are driven down; four (always the same four) cling to the edge of the open door, waiting to fly off, but not in, when you attempt to close it; nine huddle together on a place in the grass about forty feet distant, where a small coop formerly stood in the prehistoric ages.  This small coop was one in which they lodged for a fortnight when they were younger, and when those absolutely indelible impressions are formed of which we read in educational maxims.  It was taken away long since, but the nine loyal (or stupid) Casabiancas cling to the sacred spot where its foundations rested; they accordingly have to be caught and deposited bodily in the house, and this requires strategy, as they note our approach from a considerable distance.  {Of a wandering mind: p35.jpg}  Finally all are housed but two, the little white cock and the black pullet, who are still impish and of a wandering mind.  Though headed off in every direction, they fly into the hedges and hide in the underbrush. We beat the hedge on the other side, but with no avail.  We dive into the thicket of wild roses, sweetbrier, and thistles on our hands and knees, coming out with tangled hair, scratched noses, and no hens.  Then, when all has been done that human ingenuity can suggest, Phoebe goes to her late supper and I do sentry-work.  I stroll to a safe distance, and, sitting on one of the rat-proof boxes, watch the bushes with an eagle eye.  Five minutes go by, ten, fifteen; and then out steps the white cock, stealthily tiptoeing toward the home into which he refused to go at our instigation.  In a moment out creeps the obstinate little beast of a black pullet from the opposite clump.  The wayward pair meet at their own door, which I have left open a few inches.  When all is still I walk gently down the field, and, warned by previous experiences, approach the house from behind.  I draw the door to softly and quickly; but not so quickly that the evil-minded and suspicious black pullet hasn't time to spring out, with a make-believe squawk of fright--that induces three other blameless chickens to fly down from their perches and set the whole flock in a flutter.  Then I fall from grace and call her a Broiler; and when, after some minutes of hot pursuit, I catch her by falling over her in the corner by the goose-pen, I address her as a fat, juicy Broiler with parsley butter and a bit of bacon.  {With tangled hair, scratched noses, and no hens: p36.jpg}     CHAPTER V   July 10th.  At ten thirty or so in the morning the cackling begins.  I wonder exactly what it means!  Have the forest-lovers who listen so respectfully to, and interpret so exquisitely, the notes of birds--have none of them made psychological investigations of the hen cackle?  Can it be simple elation?  One could believe that of the first few eggs, but a hen who has laid two or three hundred can hardly feel the same exuberant pride and joy daily.  Can it be the excitement incident to successful achievement? Hardly, because the task is so extremely simple.  Eggs are more or less alike; a little larger or smaller, a trifle whiter or browner; and almost sure to be quite right as to details; that is, the big end never gets confused with the little end, they are always ovoid and never spherical, and the yolk is always inside of the white.  As for a soft-shelled egg, it is so rare an occurrence that the fear of laying one could not set the whole race of hens in a panic; so there really cannot be any intellectual or emotional agitation in producing a thing that might be made by a machine.  Can it be simply \"fussiness\"; since the people who have the least to do commonly make the most flutter about doing it?  Perhaps it is merely conversation.  \"_Cut-cut-cut-cut-cut_-DAH_cut_! . . . I have finished my strictly fresh egg, have you laid yours?  Make haste, then, for the cock has found a gap in the wire-fence and wants us to wander in the strawberry-bed. . . . Cut-cut-cut-cut-cut-DAH_cut_ . . . Every moment is precious, for the Goose Girl will find us, when she gathers the strawberries for her luncheon . . . Cut-cut-cut-cut!  On the way out we can find sweet places to steal nests . . . Cut-cut-cut! . . . I am so glad I am not sitting this heavenly morning; it _is_ a dull life.\"  A Lancashire poultryman drifted into Barbury Green yesterday.  He is an old acquaintance of Mr. Heaven, and spent the night and part of the next day at Thornycroft Farm.  He possessed a deal of fowl philosophy, and tells many a good hen story, which, like fish stories, draw rather largely on the credulity of the audience.  We were sitting in the rickyard talking comfortably about laying and cackling and kindred matters when he took his pipe from his mouth and told us the following tale--not a bad one if you can translate the dialect:--  'Aw were once towd as, if yo' could only get th' hen's egg away afooar she hed sin it, th' hen 'ud think it hed med a mistek an' sit deawn ageean an' lay another.  \"An' it seemed to me it were a varra sensible way o' lukkin' at it.  Sooa aw set to wark to mek a nest as 'ud tek a rise eawt o' th' hens.  An' aw dud it too.  Aw med a nest wi' a fause bottom, th' idea bein' as when a hen hed laid, th' egg 'ud drop through into a box underneyth.  \"Aw felt varra preawd o' that nest, too, aw con tell yo', an' aw remember aw felt quite excited when aw see an awd black Minorca, th' best layer as aw hed, gooa an' settle hersel deawn i' th' nest an' get ready for wark. Th' hen seemed quite comfortable enough, aw were glad to see, an' geet through th' operation beawt ony seemin' trouble.  \"Well, aw darsay yo' know heaw a hen carries on as soon as it's laid a egg.  It starts \"chuckin'\" away like a showman's racket, an' after tekkin' a good Ink at th' egg to see whether it's a big 'un or a little 'un, gooas eawt an' tells all t'other hens abeawt it.  \"Neaw, this black Minorca, as aw sed, were a owdish bird, an' maybe knew mooar than aw thowt.  Happen it hed laid on a nest wi' a fause bottom afooar, an' were up to th' trick, but whether or not, aw never see a hen luk mooar disgusted i' mi life when it lukked i' th' nest an' see as it hed hed all that trouble fer nowt.  \"It woked reawnd th' nest as if it couldn't believe its own eyes.  \"But it dudn't do as aw expected.  Aw expected as it 'ud sit deawn ageean an' lay another.  \"But it just gi'e one wonderin' sooart o' chuck, an then, after a long stare reawnd th' hen-coyt, it woked eawt, as mad a hen as aw've ever sin. Aw fun' eawt after, what th' long stare meant.  It were tekkin' farewell! For if yo'll believe me that hen never laid another egg i' ony o' my nests.  \"Varra like it laid away in a spot wheear it could hev summat to luk at when it hed done wark for th' day.  \"Sooa aw lost mi best layer through mi actin', an' aw've never invented owt sen.\"     CHAPTER VI   One learns to be modest by living on a poultry farm, for there are constant expositions of the most deplorable vanity among the cocks.  We have a couple of pea-fowl who certainly are an addition to the landscape, as they step mincingly along the square of turf we dignify by the name of lawn.  The head of the house has a most languid and self-conscious strut, and his microscopic mind is fixed entirely on his splendid trailing tail. If I could only master his language sufficiently to tell him how hideously ugly the back view of this gorgeous fan is, when he spreads it for the edification of the observer in front of him, he would of course retort that there is a \"congregation side\" to everything, but I should at least force him into a defence of his tail and a confession of its limitations.  This would be new and unpleasant, I fancy; and if it produced no perceptible effect upon his super-arrogant demeanour, I might remind him that he is likely to be used, eventually, for a feather duster, unless, indeed, the Heavens are superstitious and prefer to throw his tail away, rather than bring ill luck and the evil eye into the house.  {More pride of bearing, and less to be proud of: p43.jpg}  The longer I study the cock, whether Black Spanish, White Leghorn, Dorking, or the common barnyard fowl, the more intimately I am acquainted with him, the less I am impressed with his character.  He has more pride of bearing, and less to be proud of, than any bird I know.  He is indolent, though he struts pompously over the grass as if the day were all too short for his onerous duties.  He calls the hens about him when I throw corn from the basket, but many a time I have seen him swallow hurriedly, and in private, some dainty titbit he has found unexpectedly. He has no particular chivalry.  He gives no special encouragement to his hen when he becomes a prospective father, and renders little assistance when the responsibilities become actualities.  His only personal message or contribution to the world is his raucous cock-a-doodle-doo, which, being uttered most frequently at dawn, is the most ill-timed and offensive of all musical notes.  It is so unnecessary too, as if the day didn't come soon enough without his warning; but I suppose he is anxious to waken his hens and get them at their daily task, and so he disturbs the entire community.  In short, I dislike him; his swagger, his autocratic strut, his greed, his irritating self-consciousness, his endless parading of himself up "]]]
