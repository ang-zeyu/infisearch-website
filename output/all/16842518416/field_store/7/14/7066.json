I ate half a pot yesterday on three or four slices of hot bread from the oven, and felt quite a dizzy stupid feeling in my head afterwards.\"  \"Of course, how could you expect it to agree with you, Polly?\" said Helen, looking up innocently from her place at the tea-tray.  \"Had better have a little of this stale bread-and-butter then, dear?\" proceeded Polly in a would-be anxious tone.  \"Yes, if you will, dear. But you never like stale bread-and-butter.\"  \"I'll eat it if you wish me to, Helen,\" answered Polly, in a very meek, good little voice.  The two boys began to chuckle, and even Dr. Maybright looked at his second daughter in a puzzled, abstracted way. Helen, too, colored slightly, and wondered what Polly meant. But the young lady herself munched her stale bread with the most immovable of faces, and even held up the slice for Helen to scrutinize, with the gentle, good little remark--\"Have I put too much butter on it, Nell? It isn't right to waste nice good butter, is it?\"  \"Oh, Polly, how dreadful you are?\" said Fly.  \"What do you mean?\" said Polly, fiercely.  She dropped her meek manners, gave one quick glare at the small speaker, and then half turning her back on her, said in the gentlest of voices, \"What would you like me to do this morning, Helen? Shall I look over my history lesson for an hour, and then practise scales on the piano?\"  \"You may do just as you please, as far as I am concerned,\" replied Helen, who felt that this sort of obedience was far worse for the others than open rebellion. \"I thought you wanted to see father, Polly. He has just gone into his study, and perhaps he will give you ten minutes, if you go to him at once.\"  This speech of Helen's caused Polly to forget her role of the meek, obedient martyr. Her brow cleared.  \"Thank you for reminding me, Nell,\" she said, in her natural voice, and for a moment later she was knocking at the Doctor's study door.  \"Come in,\" he said. And when the untidy head and somewhat neglected person of his second daughter appeared, Dr. Maybright walked towards her.  \"I am going out, Polly, do you want me?\" he said.  \"Yes, it won't take a minute,\" said Polly, eagerly. \"May I housekeep every second week instead of Nell? Will you give me the money instead of her, and let me pay for everything, and buy the food. I am awfully interested in eggs and butter, and I'll give you splendid puddings and cakes. Please say yes, father--Nell is quite willing, if you are.\"  \"How old are you, Polly?\" said Dr. Maybright.  He put his hand under Polly's chin and raised her childish face to scrutinize it closely.  \"What matter about my age,\" she replied; \"I'm fourteen in body--I'm twenty in mind--and as to housekeeping, I'm thirty, if not forty.\"  \"That head looks very like thirty, if not forty,\" responded the Doctor significantly. \"And that dress,\" glancing at where the hem was torn, and where the body gaped open for want of sufficient hooks, \"looks just the costume I should recommend for the matron of a large establishment. Do you know what it means to housekeep for this family, Polly?\"  \"Buy the bread and butter, and the meat, and the poultry, and the tea, and the sugar, and the citron, and raisins, and allspice, and nutmegs, and currants, and flour, and brick-bat, and hearthstone, and--and----\"  Dr. Maybright put his fingers to his ears. \"Spare me any more,\" said he, \"I never ask for items. There are in this house, Polly, nine children, myself, and four servants. That makes in all fourteen people. These people have to be fed and clothed, and some of them have to be paid wages too; they have to be warmed, they have to be kept clean, in short, all their comforts of body have to be attended to; one of them requires one thing, one quite another. For instance, the dinner which would be admirably suited to you would kill baby, and might not be best for Firefly, who is not strong, and has to be dieted in a particular way. I make it a rule that servants' wages and all articles consumed in the house are paid for weekly. Whoever housekeeps for me has to undertake all this, and has to make a certain sum of money cover a certain expenditure. Now do you think, Polly--do you honestly think--that you, an ignorant little girl of fourteen, a very untidy and childish little girl, can undertake this onerous post? I ask you to answer me quite honestly--if you undertake it, are you in the least likely to succeed?\"  \"Oh, father, I know you mean to crush me when you speak like that; but you know you told Helen that you would like her to try to manage the housekeeping.\"  \"I did--and, as I know you are fond of domestic things, I meant you to help her a little. Helen is two years older than you, and--not the least like you, Polly.\"  Polly tossed her head.  \"I know that,\" she said. \"Helen takes twice as long learning her lessons. Try my French beside hers, father; or my German, or my music.\"  \"Or your forbearance--or your neatness,\" added the Doctor.  Here he sighed deeply.  \"I miss your mother, Polly,\" he said. \"And poor, poor child! so do you. There, I can't waste another minute of my time with you now. Come to my study this evening at nine, and we will discuss the matter further.\"     CHAPTER VI.  POLLY'S RAID.   Polly spent some hours of that day in a somewhat mysterious occupation. Instead of helping, as she had done lately, in quite an efficient way, with the baby, for she was a very bright child, and could be most charming and attractive to the smallest living creature when she chose, she left nurse and the little brown-eyed baby to their own devices, and took up a foraging expedition through the house. She called it her raid, and Polly's raid proved extremely disturbing to the domestic economy of the household. For instance, when Susan, the very neat housemaid, had put all the bedrooms in perfect order, and was going to her own room to change her dress and make herself tidy, it was very annoying to hear Polly, in a peremptory tone, desiring her to give her the keys of the linen-press.  \"For,\" said that young lady, \"I'm going to look through the towels this morning, Susan, to see which of them want darning, and you had better stay with me, to take away those that have thin places in them.\"  \"Oh, dear me, Miss Polly,\" said Susan, rather pertly, \"the towels is seen to in the proper rotation. You needn't be a fretting your head about 'em, miss. This ain't the morning for the linen-press, miss. It's done at its proper time and hour.\"  \"Give me the key at once, Susan, and don't answer,\" said Polly. \"There, hold your apron--I'll throw the towels in. What a lot--I don't believe we want half as many. When I take the reins of office next week, I'll put away quite half of these towels. There can't be waste going on in the house--I won't have it, not when I housekeep, at any rate. Susan, wasn't that a little round speck of a hole in that towel? Ah, I thought so. You put it aside, Susan, you'll have to darn it this afternoon. Now then, let me see, let me see.\"  Polly worked vigorously through the towels, holding them up to the light to discover their thin places, pinching them in parts, and feeling their texture between her finger and thumb. In the end she pronounced about a dozen unworthy of domestic service, and Susan was desired to spend her afternoon in repairing them.  \"I can't, then, Miss Polly,\" said the much injured housemaid. \"It ain't neither the day nor the hour, and I haven't got one scrap of proper darning thread left.\"  \"I'll go to the village, then, and get some,\" said Polly. \"It's only a mile away. Things can't be neglected--it isn't right. Take the towels, Susan, and let me find them mended to-morrow morning;\" and the young lady tripped off with a very bright color in her cheeks, and the key of the linen-press in her pocket.  Her next visit was to the kitchen regions.  \"Oh, Mrs. Power,\" she said to the cook, \"I've come to see the stores. It isn't right that they shouldn't be looked into, is it, in case of anything falling short. Fancy if you were run out of pearl barley, Mrs. Power, or allspice, or nutmegs, or mace. Oh, dear, it makes me quite shiver to think of it! What a mess you would be in, if you hadn't all your ingredients handy, in case you were making a plum-cake, or some of those dear little tea-cakes, or a custard, or something of that sort. Now, if you'll just give me the keys, we'll pay a visit to the store-room, and see what is likely to be required. I have my tablet here, and I can write the order as I look through.\"  Mrs. Power was a red-faced and not a very good-humored woman. She was, however, an excellent cook and a careful, prudent servant. Mrs. Maybright had found her, notwithstanding her very irascible temper, a great comfort, for she was thoroughly honest and conscientious, but even from her late mistress Mrs. Power would never brook much interference; it is therefore little to be wondered at that Polly's voluminous speech was not very well received.  Mrs. Power's broad back was to the young lady, as she danced gleefully into the kitchen, and it remained toward her, with one ear just slightly turned in her direction, all the time she was speaking.  Mrs. Power was busy at the moment removing the fat from a large vessel full of cold soup. She has some pepper and salt, and nutmegs and other flavoring ingredients on the table beside her, and when Polly's speech came to a conclusion she took up the pepper canister and certainly flavored the soup with a very severe dose.  \"If I was you, I'd get out of the hot kitchen, child--I'm busy, and not attending to a word you're talking about.\"  No answer could have been more exasperating to Polly. She, too, had her temper, and had no idea of being put down by twenty Mrs. Powers.  \"Take care, you're spoiling the soup,\" she said. \"That's twice too much pepper--and oh, what a lot of salt! Don't you know, Mrs. Power, that it's very wicked to waste good food in that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18666"],["title","Polly: A New-Fashioned Girl (#5)"],["body","ay--it is, really, perhaps you did not think of it in that light, but it is. I'm afraid you can't ever have attended any cookery classes, Mrs. Power, or you'd know better than to put all that pepper into that much soup. Why it ought to be--it ought to be--let me see, I think it's the tenth of an ounce to half a gallon of soup. I'm not quite sure, but I'll look up the cookery lectures and let you know. Now, where's the key of the store-room--we'd better set to work for the morning is going on, and I have a great deal on my hands. Where's the key of the store-room, Mrs. Power?\"  \"There's only one key that I know much about at the present moment,\" replied the exasperated cook, \"and that's the key of the kitchen-door; come, child--I'm going to put you on the other side of it;\" and so saying, before Polly was in the least aware of her intention, she was caught up in Mrs. Power's stalwart arms, and placed on the flags outside the kitchen, while the door was boldly locked in her face.  This was really a check, almost a checkmate, and for a time Polly quite shook with fury, but after a little she sufficiently recovered herself to reflect that the reins of authority had not yet been absolutely placed in her hands, and it might be wisest for her to keep this defeat to herself.  \"Poor old Power! you won't be here long when I'm housekeeper,\" reflected Polly. \"It would not be right--you're not at all a good servant. Why, I know twice as much already as you do.\"  She went slowly upstairs, and going to the school-room, where the girls were all busying themselves in different fashions, sat down by her own special desk, and made herself very busy dividing a long old-fashioned rosewood box into several compartments by means of stout cardboard divisions. She was really a clever little maid in her own way, and the box when finished looked quite neat. Each division was labeled, and Polly's cheeks glowed as she surveyed her handiwork.  \"What a very queer box,\" said Dolly, coming forward. \"What are you so long about, Poll Parrot? And, oh, what red cheeks!\"  \"Never you mind,\" said Polly, shutting up her box. \"It's finished now, and quite ready for father to see to-night. I'm going to become a very important personage, Miss Doll--so you'd better begin to treat me with respect. Oh, dear, where's the cookery book? Helen, do you know where the \"Lectures on Elementary Cookery\" is? Just fancy, Nell, cook doesn't know how much pepper should go to a gallon of soup! Did you ever hear of such shameful ignorance?\"  \"Why, you surely have not been speaking to her on the subject?\" said Helen, who was busily engaged darning Bunny's socks; she raised her head and looked at Polly in some surprise as she spoke.  \"Oh, have I not, though?\" Polly's charming, merry face twinkled all over.  \"I saw Susan crying just now,\" interposed Mabel. \"She said Polly had been--why, what is the matter, Poll?\"  \"Nothing,\" said Poll, \"only if I were you, Mabel, I wouldn't tell tales out of school. I'm going to be a person of importance, so if you're wise, all of you, you'll keep at my blind side. Oh dear! where is that cookery book? Girls, you may each tell me what puddings you like best, and what cake, and what dish for breakfast, and----\"  But here the dinner gong put an end to a subject of much interest.     CHAPTER VII.  THE GROWN-UPS.   In the evening Polly had her interview with her father. Dr. Maybright had gone through a long and fatiguing day; some anxious cases caused him disquiet, and his recent sorrow lay heavily against his heart. How was the father of seven daughters, and two very scampish little sons, to bring them up alone and unaided? How was a man's own heart to do without the sympathy to which it had turned, the love which had strengthened, warmed, and sustained it? Dr. Maybright was standing by the window, looking out at the familiar garden, which showed shadowy and indistinct in the growing dusk, when Polly crept softly into the room, and, going up to his side, laid her pretty dimpled hand on his arm.  \"Now, father,\" she said, eagerly, \"about the housekeeping? I'm all prepared--shall we go into the subject now?\"  Dr. Maybright sighed, and with an effort roused himself out of a reverie which was becoming very painful.  \"My little girl,\" he said, pushing back the tumbled hair from Polly's sunshiny face. Then he added, with a sudden change of manner, \"Oh, what a goose you are, Polly--you know as much about housekeeping as I do, and that is nothing at all.\"  \"I wouldn't make bold assertions,\" replied Polly, saucily--\"I wouldn't really, father dear; I couldn't cure a sick person, of course not, but I could make a very nice cake for one.\"  \"Well, let's go into the matter,\" said the Doctor moving to his study table. \"I have a quarter of an hour to give you, my dear, then I want to go into the village to see Mrs. Judson before she settles for the night; she has a nasty kind of low fever about her, and her husband is anxious, so I promised to look in. By the way, Polly, don't any of you go nearer the Judsons' house until I give you leave; walk at the other side of the village, if you must go there at all. Now, my dear, about this housekeeping. Are you seriously resolved to force your attentions upon us for a week? We shall certainly all be most uncomfortable, and severe attacks of indigestion will probably be the result. Is your heart set on this, Polly, child? For, if so--well, your mother never thwarted you, did she?\"  \"No, father, never--but don't talk of mother, for I don't think I can bear it. When I was with mother somehow or other, I don't know why, I, never wished for anything she did not like.\"  \"Just so, my dear child. Turn up the lamp, if you please, Polly--sit there, will you--I want to see your face. Now I will reply to the first part of your last remark. You asked me not to speak of your mother, my dear; I certainly will mention her name to her children. She has gone away, but she is still one with us. Why should our dearest household word be buried? Why should not her influence reach you and Helen and Dolly from where she now is? She is above--she has gone into the higher life, but she can lead you up. You understand me, Polly. Thoughts of your mother must be your best, your noblest thoughts from this out.\"  \"Yes, father, yes,\" said Polly. Her lips were trembling, her eyes were brimful, she clasped and unclasped her hands with painful tension.  Dr. Maybright bent forward and kissed her on her forehead.  \"Your mother once said to me,\" he continued, in a lighter tone, \"Polly is the most peculiar and difficult to manage of all my children. She has a vein of obstinacy in her which no persuasion will overcome. It can only be reached by the lessons which experience teaches. If possible, and where it is not absolutely wrong, I always give Polly her own way. She is a truthful child, and when her eyes are opened she seldom asks to repeat the experiment.\"  \"Mother was thinking of the hive of honey,\" said Polly, gravely. \"When I worried her dreadfully she let me go and take some honey away. I thought I could manage the bees just as cleverly as Hungerford does, but I got nervous just at the end, and I was stung in four places. I never told any one about the stings, only mother found out.\"  \"You did not fetch any more honey from that hive, eh, Polly?\" asked the Doctor.  \"No, father. And then there was another time--and oh, yes, many other times. But I did not know mother was just trying to teach me, when she seemed so kind and sympathizing, and used to say in that voice of hers--you remember mother's cheerful voice, father?--'Well, Polly, it is a difficult thing, but do your best.'\"  \"All right, child,\" said the Doctor, \"I perceive that your mother's plan was a wise one. Tell me quickly what ideas you have with regard to keeping this establishment together, for it is almost time for me to run away to Mrs. Judson. I allow eight pounds a week for all household expenses, servants' wages, coal, light, food, medicine. I shall not allow you to begin with so much responsibility, but for a week you may provide our table.\"  \"And see after the servants, please, father?\" interrupted Polly, in an eager voice.  \"Well, I suppose so, just for one week, that is, after Helen has had her turn. Your mother always managed, with the help of the vegetables and fruit from the garden, to bring the mere table expenses into four pounds a week; but _she_ was a most excellent manager.\"  \"Oh, father, I can easily do it too. Why it's a lot of money! four pounds--eighty shillings! I shouldn't be a bit surprised if I did it for less.\"  \"Remember, Polly, I allow no stinting; we must have a plentiful table. No stinting, and no running in debt. Those are the absolute conditions, otherwise I do not trust you with a penny.\"  \"I'll keep them, father--never fear! Oh, how delighted I am! I know you'll be pleased; I know what you'll say by-and-by. I'm certain I won't fail, certain. I always loved cooking and housekeeping. Fancy making pie-crust myself, and cakes, and custards! Mrs. Power is rather cross, but she'll have to let me make what things I choose when I'm housekeeper, won't she, father?\"  \"Manage it your own way, dear, I neither interfere nor wish to interfere. Oh, what a mess we shall be in! But thank heaven it is only for a week. My dear child, I allow you to have your way, but I own it is with trepidation. Now I must really go to Mrs. Judson.\"  \"But one moment, please, father. I have not shown you my plan. You think badly of me now, but you won't, indeed you won't presently. I am all system, I assure you. I see my way so clearly. I'll retrench without being mean, and I'll economize without being stingy. Don't I use fine words, father? That's because I understand the subject so thoroughly.\"  \"Quite so, Polly. Now I must be going. Good-night, my dear.\"  \"But my plan--you must stay to hear it. Do you see this box? It has little divisions. I popped them all in before dinner to-day. There"]]]
