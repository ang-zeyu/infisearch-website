Staffs in hand, clad in the short knickerbockers, the khaki shirts and the wide campaign hats that mark the Boy Scout all over the world, they were enough of a spectacle to draw the attention of the busy citizens of Liege, who stopped to watch them admiringly.  Their scoutmaster, Armand Van Verde, had been addressing them.  And now in the fading light of the late afternoon, he dismissed them.  At once the troop broke up, first into patrols, then into small individual groups of two or three.  The faces of the scouts were grave for it was serious news indeed that Van Verde had communicated to the troop at the meeting just ended.  Paul Latour called sharply to his great friend, Arthur Waller.  \"Come on, Arthur,\" he said.  \"We'd better be getting along home.  There may be something for us to do.\"  \"All right,\" agreed Arthur, cheerfully.  He was a little younger than his chum, and was nearly always willing to agree to anything Paul proposed.  The two boys were not natives of Liege.  However, they spent their summers with relatives who lived in the country a few miles beyond the limits of the famous old town, in the direction of the village of Esneux.  They themselves came from Brussels, and, while not themselves related, were both cousins of the family which they were now visiting, that of M. de Frenard.  So now, striking out with a good, swinging pace, they made their way rapidly through the streets of the old town of Liege, narrow and crooked, once they were beyond the great square.  They passed over the new Exposition Bridge and so to the new town of Liege, where the great steel works of Seraing were beginning to cast red reflections against the darkening sky.  \"They have begun to work all night long,\" said Arthur.  \"It's a good thing, too,\" said Paul, soberly.  \"If there is to be a war, as Mr. Van Verde says, we may need all the guns they can turn out.\"  \"But we shall not go to war, Paul!  Belgium is neutral.  All the powers joined in declaring Belgium to be a neutral state.  We have learned that in our history in school!\"  \"I know that, Arthur.  But will the Germans respect our neutrality?  If they don't, we shall have to defend ourselves against them.  And the first attack will be here, at Liege.\"  \"Then these forts that Uncle Henri showed us will really be useful? They are strong forts, Paul.\"  \"I hope not.  But just because there are forts there it is a sign that the government has feared an invasion, Arthur.  I hope that if there is war we shall stay out of it.  But Belgium has always been exposed to war when her great neighbors fought.  Some of the greatest battles in the history of the world have been fought on our soil.\"  \"I know!  Waterloo was where Napoleon was beaten finally.  We have seen that battlefield, Paul, you and I.  Do you think there may be a battle there again?  That would be exciting!\"  \"Waterloo was only one.  Ramillies was fought in Belgium, too, and many other battles.  Even Caesar fought here.  Do you remember the place where he says that of all the tribes he conquered, the bravest were the Belgians?\"  \"Oh, that's so!  I'd forgotten that!  But, Paul, you said there might be something for us to do.  What did you mean?\"  \"I'm not sure yet, Arthur, and I'd rather not say anything more until I am.  But I want you to slip out with me to-night, after dinner.  We'll find out then, for certain.  And I don't want to tell Uncle Henri or anyone else, and afterward find I was wrong.  We'd be laughed at then, you see.\"  \"Then you have found something!  Oh, tell me, Paul!  I won't repeat it to a soul!\"  \"You'll know all in good time.  Do you remember that man who tried the other day to get work as a gardener?\"  \"Yes, I do.  Uncle Henri didn't have any work for him, but he sent him to the factory in Seraing, and told him they would give him a job.\"  \"That's the one.  You know he said he was hungry, and that he hadn't been able to get any work for a long time, so he didn't have any money. Uncle Henri told the cook to give him a dinner.\"  \"Yes, and I was sorry he didn't get a place.  He looked as if he would have been all right.\"  \"Well, Arthur, I saw him again, last night!  He was in Esneux, and he seemed to have plenty of money, though he hadn't gone to Seraing to get work.  He was in Madame Bibet's wine shop, and he was treating everyone.  Do you know what he paid with?\"  \"No.\"  \"A German gold piece!  That's how I know about it, because Madame Bibet had never seen such a coin before, and she was afraid it wasn't good. So she came out, and when she saw me she asked me, and I told her it was good, of course.\"  \"Well, that's nothing, Paul.  We often see German money here in Liege. Isn't it like that in all places that are near a border?  I suppose that on the other side there is a lot of French money.  Why, there is, even in Brussels.\"  \"It may mean nothing at all, Arthur.  I hope it doesn't.  But I think it's funny that that man should be staying around so.  He must have told Uncle Henri a lie when he said he didn't have money.  I'd like to know what he's up to.  I'd like to be sure that he's not a German spy.\"  \"Oh, I never thought of that!  A spy!  Why should the Germans have spies around here, though, Paul?\"  \"It's just the place where they would have them, Arthur.  The forts! They want to find out all they can about them.  Boncelles is near us; so is the fort of Embourg.  They want to know if our people are ready. If they come through Belgium, you know, they will want to get through as quickly as they can, to attack the French.\"  \"But I don't see why they should want to come through Belgium at all, Paul.  Why can't they leave us alone?  They can attack the French along their own border, I should think.\"  \"They can.  But the French know that, and they have their strongest fortresses all along there, from Belfort to Verdun.  It would take the Germans weeks, months perhaps, to get past these fortifications along the border, and that would give the French time to bring up all their soldiers.  And the Germans have to beat the French quickly this time, or else not at all.  They aren't fighting France alone, but Russia as well, and their plan must be to beat France first and then turn on Russia.  They think that here in Belgium it will be easy for them to get around these forts.  If they once get behind them, the French will have to retreat.  And the Germans think that the quickest way to bring that is for them to go through our country and so attack Paris.\"  \"They ought to be stopped!\" said Arthur, hotly.  \"England and France would help us, wouldn't they?\"  \"France certainly would, because she would have to.  And I believe the English would help, too.  I hope so.  Because even if the Germans promised to go away as soon as they'd beaten France, I don't believe they would.  They'd make Belgium a part of Germany.\"  \"They can't do that!  They shan't!  Why, we're not German!  We're a free country!\"  \"Yes, but we may have to fight to remain free, Arthur.  Free countries have had to do that before.  If there is war, I think we shall see the Germans here within a day of its declaration.  We had better hope for peace.  But we must be prepared for war--and we must not deceive ourselves.  A treaty guarantees our neutrality, but I think the time is coming when treaties will be forgotten.\"  \"We shall have to teach these Germans to remember them, then,\" said Arthur, valiantly.  \"We may be weak, but we are brave, we Belgians.  I believe we can give them something to think about.\"  Paul smiled a little sadly.  He understood the true facts, the real possibilities, better than his friend.  \"If it comes to fighting, we will do our part,\" he said, \"but we should be helpless against Germany alone, Arthur.  The only thing we could do would be to try to hold them back long enough for the French and the English to come to our aid.  Either that, or we would have to let them pass through without resisting them.\"  \"So that they could fall on France?  But that would be treachery!\" said Arthur, indignantly.  \"I have heard of that treaty of neutrality.  We are safeguarded from attack, but we are forbidden to allow the troops of a country that is at war to pass through our territory.  If it was the French who talked of invading us to reach Germany, I should say that we must fight them.\"  \"Yes, you're right, Arthur,\" said Paul.  \"I think we should make any sacrifice to keep faith.  But be sure that it will be a terrible sacrifice, if we must make it.\"  \"Look there!\" whispered Arthur, suddenly.  \"Someone started up just now from behind the bushes.  A man--and he is running away from us!\"  \"After him!\" cried Paul.  \"It looks--yes, it is the man I spoke of!\"  They ran as hard as they could, shouting as they went, in the hope"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18838"],["title","The Belgians to the Front (#1)"],["body","someone might intercept the fugitive.  But he had too good a start, and in a few moments he had distanced them by climbing a rail fence and disappearing into a thicket that came down to the edge of a field.  \"No use!\" said Paul, disgustedly.  \"He got away from us.  But I don't suppose it would have done us any good to catch him.  We couldn't have done anything--hello!\"  He ended with an exclamation of surprise, and stooped over.  They were at the foot of the fence the flying figure had climbed a moment before.  \"What is it, Paul?\" asked Arthur, eagerly.  \"This!\" said Paul.  He held up a small black pocket-book, and from it he took a package of papers, wrapped in oil silk.  \"I struck against it with my foot!  I wonder if that man who was running could have dropped it?\"  It was almost dark by this time; too dark, at any rate, for them to be able to see the papers.  But then Arthur remembered the pocket flashlight he carried and produced it, switching on the light.  \"Let's have a look,\" he said.  They unwrapped the oil silk covering.  And, at the first sight of what was within it, they gasped.  They were holding in their hands a complete sketch of the fort of Boncelles, the most important of the works defending Liege to the southwest.  Before they could examine it more fully there was a shout from the fence.  The spy had missed his papers.  They saw him for a moment.  But now it was their turn to run.     CHAPTER II  THE MARKED PLANS  The fierce shouting of the man as he called on them to stop did not terrify either of the scouts, but it did confirm Paul's guess.  There could no longer be any doubt that his presence meant mischief; that he was indeed a spy.  Or else why should he have such papers?  Why, again, should their loss so greatly disturb him?  There was not a chance for him to catch them.  Well as he might know the country, they knew it better.  They had played in these fields and woods since they had been able to walk at all.  Every hollow, every ridge, every tree, almost, was familiar to them.  Circling about, they soon reached the garden of their summer home, a fine, spacious house, with ample grounds surrounding it, that belonged to their Uncle Henri de Frenard, whose wealth was derived from his considerable holdings of coal land around Liege.  \"Did you get a good look at him, Paul?\" gasped Arthur, when at last they felt that it was safe for them to stop running.  \"I couldn't really make sure of him--\"  \"I think I'll know him again, Arthur.  What I'm wondering is if he'll know us.\"  \"I don't see what difference that makes, except that if he saw us before we saw him, it would give him a chance to escape--\"  \"We're more likely to be trying to escape from him than he from us, I'm afraid, Arthur, for a little while.  If the Germans are spying as openly as all that, it must mean that they're getting ready to come into Belgium.  They wouldn't take such chances unless they felt that it didn't make any difference now.\"  \"Don't you think we could find him, Paul?  If we could, we could have him arrested, I think.\"  \"Don't say a word--yet,\" cautioned Paul.  \"Uncle Henri would only laugh at us.  Let's wait until we can look at his papers, and see what there really is there besides the sketch of Fort Boncelles.  If that's all there was in the papers, I don't see why he was so awfully anxious to get them back.  Perhaps we've done even better than we know, Arthur.\"  \"All right, I won't say anything,\" said Arthur.  \"But you are going to do something about it, aren't you, Paul?\"  Paul laughed.  He knew that Arthur was a little disappointed at the idea of having to keep what they had done secret, especially as he had probably rehearsed already the astonishment with which all those at the dinner table would greet the startling announcement of the discovery of the spy.  \"I certainly hope we're going to do something about it, Arthur,\" he said.  \"We'll slip away from the table as soon as we can, and then when we're alone, we'll see exactly what it is we've got.\"  But at the table there was a great surprise for them.  Their uncle (though they both called him uncle the relationship was not really so close) was not in his accustomed seat, and Madame de Frenard's eyes were suspiciously red.  She had been crying.  \"Uncle Henri may not be back for two or three days,\" she said, gravely. \"He is a member of parliament, as you know, and he has been called to Brussels on account--on account of what we all hope may not come.\"  \"War?\" asked Arthur, in a hushed voice.  \"It looks terribly as if war must come,\" she said.  \"And if it does, I am afraid our poor Belgium must suffer as well as the lands that are really concerned.  We have done nothing; we want nothing except to be left alone.  If they will only do that!  But I am afraid we must not hope for that.  Your uncle expects to join the army at once if there is an invasion.\"  \"Then we'll stay here and look after you,\" proposed Arthur, promptly. \"Won't we, Paul?\"  \"For as long as we are needed,\" Paul said, gravely.  It was easy enough for them to cut their dinner short that night.  The house was uneasy, stirring with a strange foreboding of what was to come.  Servants, everyone, indeed, seemed to look always toward the east.  There were the Germans.  Often during the summer they drove to Aix-la-Chapelle, the first city over the German border--Aachen, as the Germans called it.  Paul remembered, with a smile, as he thought of the German city, how indignant he had been when he had first discovered that the Germans invariably spoke of Liege as Luttich, and how he had been appeased when he was told that he and most people outside of Germany refused to adopt the German name for Aix-la-Chapelle.  No one in the house, least of all their aunt, had time that night to think of the two boys.  As a matter of fact, it was that now famous Saturday upon which Germany finally cast the die by declaring war upon Russia in the interest of her Austrian ally, whose quarrel with Servia she thus made her own.  France, as the ally of Russia, was bound to fight Germany.  Belgium lay between the two huge powers on either side of her, well-nigh certain to be caught in the disaster that war meant. But the news that war had actually been declared had not yet come. Madame de Frenard was waiting with the utmost anxiety for a telephone message from her husband in Brussels, who had promised to send her word as soon as there were any important developments.  And so Paul and Arthur slipped out to the garage, which was a favorite hiding place.  Now it was especially safe, since Marcel, the chauffeur, had gone to Brussels with their uncle, and there was no likelihood of any unwelcome interruptions.  They repaired, therefore, to the room above the one in which their uncle's automobile was kept, and spread out the papers they had captured from the German spy.  First there was the sketch they had already seen of the Boncelles fort; then, equally detailed, they found sketches and maps of the other forts--Flemalle, Embourg, Chaudfontaine, Fleron, Evegnee, Pontisse, Liers, Lanlin, Longin and Hollogne--the great chain of detached forts that made Liege, in the opinion of military engineers, one of the strongest fortified towns in Europe.  These forts were not immediately in the town; they were about five miles, on an average, from the old citadel, long since disused as a place for actual fighting.  The connections between the various forts, intended, as both boys knew, for the greater facility of their defence by means of troops fighting more or less independently, were carefully traced on another map, in which the contour of the land and the natural shelter were shown.  And on this map, at certain spots, there were strange marks--well beyond the perimeter of the forts themselves, that is, outside the line that might be drawn around Liege and passing through each of the forts.  \"Look at those crosses,\" said Paul.  \"What do you suppose they mean, Arthur?\"  \"I don't know,\" said Arthur, frowning.  \"But we can find out, you know.\"  \"You mean by going to one or two of these places?  They're some distance off.\"  \"But we ought to find out--don't you think so?\"  \"Yes, you're right, of course.  We can find them easily enough.\"  \"Yes.  All we've got to do is to take the map along with us.  Then when we get near we can make sure by looking at it.\"  \"We could do that, but I think we won't, Arthur.  Suppose we ran into the man it belongs to again?  We might not get away from him another time, and I think it would be just as well to leave these maps here. We can hide them, and then write a note and leave it where it will be found in the morning, telling them where we hid the maps.\"  \"What's the use of hiding them if we tell some one where they are, Paul?\"  \"Can't you see?  Suppose something happens to us, so that we can't get back?  We'd want the maps to be found and taken to the commander of the forts, wouldn't we?\"  \"Of course.  I didn't think of that, that's all.  But if we come back we can get the note back before anyone sees it.  Is that what you mean, Paul?\"  \"Yes.  Now study that map very carefully.  I think we can remember where the cross marks are, all right.\"  \"I can remember this one,\" said Arthur.  \"It's exactly on the spot where that new house was built last summer, near the Ourthe.  Don't you remember?  We stopped and got some milk there, and we wondered how a farmer could build such a solid looking house when he didn't seem to have much money or much of anything else.  A stupid fellow, he was.  He scarcely knew enough to give us the milk we wanted.\"  \"Yes, I remember now,\" said Paul, looking at the map again.  He was thinking hard, trying to fathom the connection between what they both remembered of that house and the strange, significant cross on the map. There was a connection; the cross did have some significance.  Of so much he was sure.  But for the life of him that was all he could guess. It was a perplexing problem. "]]]
