He had finally settled it to his own satisfaction that it was his duty so to do, and he had resolved, as far as lay in his power, to direct the conversation at Sunday morning's breakfast into spiritual rather than into temporal matters.  So, as Mrs. Pedagog was pouring the coffee, Mr. Whitechoker began:  \"Do you gentlemen ever pause in your every-day labors and thought to let your minds rest upon the future--the possibilities it has in store for us, the consequences which--\"  \"No mush, thank you,\" said the Idiot. Then turning to Mr. Whitechoker, he added: \"I can't answer for the other gentlemen at this board, but I can assure you, Mr. Whitechoker, that I often do so. It was only last night, sir, that my genial friend who imbibes and I were discussing the future and its possibilities, and I venture to assert that there is no more profitable food for reflection anywhere in the larders of the mind than that.\"  \"Larders of the mind is excellent,\" said the School-Master, with a touch of sarcasm in his voice. \"Perhaps you would not mind opening the door to your mental pantry, and letting us peep within at the stores you keep there. I am sure that on the subject in hand your views cannot fail to be original as well as edifying.\"  \"I am also sure,\" said Mr. Whitechoker, somewhat surprised to hear the Idiot speak as he did, having sometimes ventured to doubt if that flippant-minded young man ever reflected on the serious side of life--\"I am also sure that it is most gratifying to hear that you have done some thinking on the subject.\"  \"I am glad you are gratified, Mr. Whitechoker,\" replied the Idiot, \"but I am far from taking undue credit to myself because I reflect upon the future and its possibilities. I do not see how any man can fail to be interested in the subject, particularly when he considers the great strides science has made in the last twenty years.\"  \"I fail to see,\" said the School-Master, \"what the strides of science have to do with it.\"  \"You fail to see so often, Mr. Pedagog,\" returned the Idiot, \"that I would advise your eyes to make an assignment in favor of your pupils.\"  \"I must confess,\" put in Mr. Whitechoker, blandly, \"that I too am somewhat--er--somewhat--\"  \"Somewhat up a tree as to science's connection with the future?\" queried the Idiot.  \"You have my meaning, but hardly the phraseology I should have chosen,\" replied the minister.  \"My style is rather epigrammatic,\" said the Idiot, suavely. \"I appreciate the flattery implied by your noticing it. But science has everything to do with it. It is science that is going to make the future great. It is science that has annihilated distance, and the annihilation has just begun. Twenty years ago it was hardly possible for a man standing on one side of the street to make himself heard on the other, the acoustic properties of the atmosphere not being what they should be. To-day you can stand in the pulpit of your church, and by means of certain scientific apparatus make yourself heard in Boston, New Orleans, or San Francisco. Has this no bearing on the future? The time will come, Mr. Whitechoker, when your missionaries will be able to sit in their comfortable rectories, and ring up the heathen in foreign climes, and convert them over the telephone, without running the slightest danger of falling into the soup, which expression I use in its literal rather than in its metaphorical sense.\"  [Illustration: \"YOU CAN MAKE YOURSELF HEARD IN SAN FRANCISCO\"]  \"But--\" interrupted Mr. Whitechoker.  \"Now wait, please,\" said the Idiot. \"If science can annihilate degrees of distance, who shall say that before many days science may not annihilate degrees of time? If San Francisco, thousands of miles distant, can be brought within range of the ear, why cannot 1990 be brought before the mind's eye? And if 1990 can be brought before the mind's eye, what is to prevent the invention of a prophetograph which shall enable us to cast a horoscope which shall reach all around eternity and half-way back, if not further?\"  [Illustration: THE PROPHETOGRAPH]  \"You do not understand me,\" said Mr. Whitechoker. \"When I speak of the future, I do not mean the temporal future.\"  \"I know exactly what you mean,\" said the Idiot. \"I've dealt in futures, and I am familiar with all kinds. It is you, sir, that do not understand me. My claim is perfectly plausible, and in its results is bound to make the world better. Do you suppose that any man who, by the aid of my prophetograph, sees that on a certain date in the future he will be hanged for murder is going to fail to provide himself with an alibi in regard to that particular murder, and must we not admit that having provided himself with that alibi he will of necessity avoid bloodshed, and so avoid the gallows? That's reasonable. So in regard to all the thousand and one other peccadilloes that go to make this life a sinful one. Science, by a purely logical advance along the lines already mapped out for itself, and in part already traversed, will enable men to avoid the pitfalls and reap only the windfalls of life; we shall all see what terrible consequences await on a single misstep, and we shall not make the misstep. Can you still claim that science and the future have nothing to do with each other?\"  \"You are talking of matters purely temporal,\" said Mr. Whitechoker. \"I have reference to our spiritual future.\"  \"And the two,\" observed the Idiot, \"are so closely allied that we cannot separate them. The proverb about looking after the pennies and letting the pounds take care of themselves applies here. I believe that if I take care of my temporal future--which, by-the-way, does not exist--my spiritual future will take care of itself; and if science places the hereafter before us--and you admit that even now it is before us--all we have to do is to take advantage of our opportunities, and mend our lives accordingly.\"  \"But if science shows you what is to come,\" said the School-Master, \"it must show your fate with perfect accuracy, or it ceases to be science, in which event your entertaining notions as to reform and so on are entirely fallacious.\"  \"Not at all,\" said the Idiot. \"We are approaching the time when science, which is much more liberal than any other branch of knowledge, will sacrifice even truth itself for the good of mankind.\"  \"You ought to start a paradox company,\" suggested the Doctor.  \"Either that or make himself the nucleus of an insane asylum,\" observed the School-Master, viciously. \"I never knew a man with such maniacal views as those we have heard this morning.\"  \"There is a great deal, Mr. Pedagog, that you have never known,\" returned the Idiot. \"Stick by me, and you'll die with a mind richly stored.\"  Whereat the School-Master left the table with such manifest impatience that Mr. Whitechoker was sorry he had started the conversation.  The genial gentleman who occasionally imbibed and the Idiot withdrew to the latter's room, where the former observed:  \"What are you driving at, anyhow? Where did you get those crazy ideas?\"  \"I ate a Welsh-rarebit last night, and dreamed 'em,\" returned the Idiot.  \"I thought as much,\" said his companion. \"What deuced fine things dreams are, anyhow!\"     IX   Breakfast was very nearly over, and it was of such exceptionally good quality that very few remarks had been made. Finally the ball was set rolling by the Lawyer.  \"How many packs of cigarettes do you smoke a day?\" he asked, as the Idiot took one from his pocket and placed it at the side of his coffee-cup.  \"Never more than forty-six,\" said the Idiot. \"Why? Do you think of starting a cigarette stand?\"  \"Not at all,\" said Mr. Brief. \"I was only wondering what chance you had to live to maturity, that's all. Your maturity period will be in about eight hundred and sixty years from now, the way I calculate, and it seemed to me that, judging from the number of cigarettes you smoke, you were not likely to last through more than two or three of those years.\"  \"Oh, I expect to live longer than that,\" said the Idiot. \"I think I'm good for at least four years. Don't you, Doctor?\"  \"I decline to have anything to say about your case,\" retorted the Doctor, whose feeling towards the Idiot was not surpassingly affectionate.  \"In that event I shall probably live five years more,\" said the Idiot.  The Doctor's lip curled, but he remained silent.  \"You'll live,\" put in Mr. Pedagog, with a chuckle. \"The good die young.\"  \"How did you happen to keep alive all this time then, Mr. Pedagog?\" asked the Idiot.  \"I have always eschewed tobacco in every form, for one thing,\" said Mr. Pedagog.  \"I am surprised,\" put in the Idiot. \"That's really a bad habit, and I marvel greatly that you should have done it.\"  The School-Master frowned, and looked at the Idiot over the rims of his glasses, as was his wont when he was intent upon getting explanations.  \"Done what?\" he asked, severely.  \"Chewed tobacco,\" replied the Idiot. \"You just said that one of the things that has kept you lingering in this vale of tears was that you have always chewed tobacco. I never did that, and I never shall do it, because I deem it a detestable diversion.\"  \"I didn't say anything of the sort,\" retorted Mr. Pedagog, getting red in the face. \"I never said that I chewed tobacco in any form.\"  \"Oh, come!\" said the Idiot, with well-feigned impatience, \"what's the use of talking that way? We all heard what you said, and I have no doubt that it came as a shock to every member of this assemblage. It certainly was a shock to me, because, with all my weaknesses and bad habits, I think tobacco-chewing unutterably bad. The worst part of it is that you chew it in every form. A man who chews chewing-tobacco only may some time throw off the habit, but when one gets to be such a victim to it that he chews up cigars and cigarettes and plugs of pipe tobacco, it seems to me he is"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18881"],["title","The Idiot (#8)"],["body","ble. It is not only a bad habit then; it amounts to a vice.\"  Mr. Pedagog was getting apoplectic. \"You know well enough that I never said the words you attribute to me,\" he said, sternly.  \"Really, Mr. Pedagog,\" returned the Idiot, with an irritating shake of his head, as if he were confidentially hinting to the School-Master to keep quiet--\"really you pain me by these futile denials. Nobody forced you into the confession. You made it entirely of your own volition. Now I ask you, as a man and brother, what's the use of saying anything more about it? We believe you to be a person of the strictest veracity, but when you say a thing before a tableful of listeners one minute, and deny it the next, we are forced to one of two conclusions, neither of which is pleasing. We must conclude that either, repenting your confession, you sacrifice the truth, or that the habit to which you have confessed has entirely destroyed your perception of the moral question involved. Undue use of tobacco has, I believe, driven men crazy. Opium-eating has destroyed all regard for truth in one whose word had always been regarded as good as a government bond. I presume the undue use of tobacco can accomplish the same sad result. By-the-way, did you ever try opium?\"  \"Opium is ruin,\" said the Doctor, Mr. Pedagog's indignation being so great that he seemed to be unable to find the words he was evidently desirous of hurling at the Idiot.  \"It is, indeed,\" said the Idiot. \"I knew a man once who smoked one little pipeful of it, and, while under its influence, sat down at his table and wrote a story of the supernatural order that was so good that everybody said he must have stolen it from Poe or some other master of the weird, and now nobody will have anything to do with him. Tobacco, however, in the sane use of it, is a good thing. I don't know of anything that is more satisfying to the tired man than to lie back on a sofa, of an evening, and puff clouds of smoke and rings into the air. One of the finest dreams I ever had came from smoking. I had blown a great mountain of smoke out into the room, and it seemed to become real, and I climbed to its summit and saw the most beautiful country at my feet--a country in which all men were happy, where there were no troubles of any kind, where no whim was left ungratified, where jealousies were not, and where every man who made more than enough to live on paid the surplus into the common treasury for the use of those who hadn't made quite enough. It was a national realization of the golden rule, and I maintain that if smoking were bad nothing so good, even in the abstract form of an idea, could come out of it.\"  \"That's a very nice thought,\" said the Poet. \"I'd like to put that into verse. The idea of a people dividing up their surplus of wealth among the less successful strugglers is beautiful.\"  \"You can have it,\" said the Idiot, with a pleased smile. \"I don't write poetry of that kind myself unless I work hard, and I've found that when the poet works hard he produces poems that read hard. You are welcome to it. Another time I was dreaming over my cigar, after a day of the hardest kind of trouble at the office. Everything had gone wrong with me, and I was blue as indigo. I came home here, lit a cigar, and threw myself down upon my bed and began to puff. I felt like a man in a deep pit, out of which there was no way of getting. I closed my eyes for a second, and to all intents and purposes I lay in that pit. And then what did tobacco do for me? Why, it lifted me right out of my prison. I thought I was sitting on a rock down in the depths. The stars twinkled tantalizingly above me. They invited me to freedom, knowing that freedom was not attainable. Then I blew a ring of smoke from my mouth, and it began to rise slowly at first, and then, catching in a current of air, it flew upward more rapidly, widening constantly, until it disappeared in the darkness above. Then I had a thought. I filled my mouth as full of smoke as possible, and blew forth the greatest ring you ever saw, and as it started to rise I grasped it in my two hands. It struggled beneath my weight, lengthened out into an elliptical link, and broke, and let me down with a dull thud. Then I made two rings, grasping one with my left hand and the other with my right--\"  [Illustration: \"I GRASPED IT IN MY TWO HANDS\"]  \"And they lifted you out of the pit, I suppose?\" sneered the Bibliomaniac.  \"I do not say that they did,\" said the Idiot, calmly. \"But I do know that when I opened my eyes I wasn't in the pit any longer, but up-stairs in my hall-bedroom.\"  \"How awfully mysterious!\" said the Doctor, satirically.  \"Well, I don't approve of smoking,\" said Mr. Whitechoker. \"I agree with the London divine who says it is the pastime of perdition. It is not prompted by natural instincts. It is only the habit of artificial civilization. Dogs and horses and birds get along without it. Why shouldn't man?\"  \"Hear! hear!\" cried Mr. Pedagog, clapping his hands approvingly.  \"Where? where?\" put in the Idiot. \"That's a great argument. Dog's don't put up in boarding-houses. Is the boarding-house, therefore, the result of a degraded, artificial civilization? I have seen educated horses that didn't smoke, but I have never seen an educated horse, or an uneducated one, for that matter, that had even had the chance to smoke, or the kind of mouth that would enable him to do it in case he had the chance. I have also observed that horses don't read books, that birds don't eat mutton-chops, that dogs don't go to the opera, that donkeys don't play the piano--at least, four-legged donkeys don't--so you might as well argue that since horses, dogs, birds, and donkeys get along without literature, music, mutton-chops, and piano-playing--\"  \"You've covered music,\" put in the Lawyer, who liked to be precise.  \"True; but piano-playing isn't always music,\" returned the Idiot. \"You might as well argue because the beasts and the birds do without these things man ought to. Fish don't smoke, neither do they join the police-force, therefore man should neither smoke nor become a guardian of the peace.\"  [Illustration: \"PIANO-PLAYING ISN'T ALWAYS MUSIC\"]  \"Nevertheless it is a pastime of perdition,\" insisted Mr. Whitechoker.  \"No, it isn't,\" retorted the Idiot. \"Smoking is the business of perdition. It smokes because it has to.\"  \"There! there!\" remonstrated Mr. Pedagog.  \"You mean hear! hear! I presume,\" said the Idiot.  \"I mean that you have said enough!\" remarked Mr. Pedagog, sharply.  \"Very well,\" said the Idiot. \"If I have convinced you all I am satisfied, not to say gratified. But really, Mr. Pedagog,\" he added, rising to leave the room, \"if I were you I'd give up the practice of chewing--\"  \"Hold on a minute, Mr. Idiot,\" said Mr. Whitechoker, interrupting. He was desirous that Mr. Pedagog should not be further irritated. \"Let me ask you one question. Does your old father smoke?\"  \"No,\" said the Idiot, leaning easily over the back of his chair--\"no. What of it?\"  \"Nothing at all--except that perhaps if he could get along without it you might,\" suggested the clergyman.  \"He couldn't get along without it if he knew what good tobacco was,\" said the Idiot.  \"Then why don't you introduce him to it?\" asked the Minister.  \"Because I do not wish to make him unhappy,\" returned the Idiot, softly. \"He thinks his seventy years have been the happiest years that any mortal ever had, and if now in his seventy-first year he discovered that during the whole period of his manhood he had been deprived through ignorance of so great a blessing as a good cigar, he'd become like the rest of us, living in anticipation of delights to come, and not finding approximate bliss in living over the past. Trust me, my dear Mr. Whitechoker, to look after him. He and my mother and my life are all I have.\"  The Idiot left the room, and Mr. Pedagog put in a greater part of the next half-hour in making personal statements to the remaining boarders to the effect that the word he used was eschewed, and not the one attributed to him by the Idiot.  Strange to say, most of them were already aware of that fact.     X   \"The progress of invention in this country has been very remarkable,\" said Mr. Pedagog, as he turned his attention from a scientific weekly he had been reading to a towering pile of buckwheat cakes that Mary had just brought in. \"An Englishman has just discovered a means by which a ship in distress at sea can write for help on the clouds.\"  \"Extraordinary!\" said Mr. Whitechoker.  \"It might be more so,\" observed the Idiot, coaxing the platterful of cakes out of the School-Master's reach by a dexterous movement of his hand. \"And it will be more so some day. The time is coming when the moon itself will be used by some enterprising American to advertise his soap business. I haven't any doubt that the next fifty years will develop a stereopticon by means of which a picture of a certain brand of cigar may be projected through space until it seems to be held between the teeth of the man in the moon, with a printed legend below it stating that this is _Tooforfivers Best, Rolled from Hand-made Tobacco, Warranted not to Crock or Fade, and for sale by All Tobacconists at Eighteen for a Dime_.\"  [Illustration: \"THE MOON ITSELF WILL BE USED\"]  \"You would call that an advance in invention, eh?\" asked the School-Master.  \"Why not?\" queried the Idiot.  \"Do you consider the invention which would enable man to debase nature to the level of an advertising medium an advance?\"  \"I should not consider the use of the moon for the dissemination of good news a debasement. If the cigars were good--and I have no doubt that some one will yet invent a cheap cigar that is good--it would benefit the human race to be acquainted with that fact. I think sometimes that the advertisements in the newspapers and the periodicals of the day are of more value to the public than the reading-matter, so-called, that stands next to them. I don't see"]]]
