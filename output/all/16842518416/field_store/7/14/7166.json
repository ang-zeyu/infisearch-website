There is a dignity in this rapid developement of muscular power which admits of no surrender--the gauntlet has been thrown down, the chip has been knocked off the shoulder, the black flag is hoisted and skull and bones stand out in bold relief. There may be a calm, the wind may die out, but the monster waves once lashed up to a Titanic power move on of their own accord, and wash away the very vestige of resistance. Asking to _be_ forgiven after slamming a door is like touching off a Rodman gun, and then calling out to the fort in front to 'look out' 'take care!' 'do get out of the way.' A first class slam is cumulative long after the noise has ceased--the nerves go on slamming--the valves of the heart flap to and from--the tympanum roils a revelrie to all the shattered senses, the offender slammed at, at once subsides from rage to fear; the mental barometer falls--and apprehension--the requiescat--is a don't know what is coming next. A bona fide, abandoned slam is a Domestic Earthquake.  I next sat down on my Mexican chair, and waited for the rapid hatching of the egg. A register led up from the kitchen into my room, and though never used, formed one of those abominable listening tubes that might be truthfully called family tale-bearers. This time, however, I had the pleasure of overhearing the following fragmentary evidence of a reaction:  'He must be crazy.' 'Did he drink much after dinner?' 'I say, you have been here longer than I have, have you ever seen him so before?' Then a giggle, and some one saying: 'Is he married?'  'Sabina, ain't you ashamed to laugh?'--'poor thing--won't stay--gallows'--then silence, and in a few minutes one after another of the visitors passed by under the window on tip-toe, and almost immediately a soft knock and a pause. I thought * * * and acted.  'Come in,' said I, in one of those gentle and subdued voices that no one but a passionate man can possess. The door gradually opened, and there stood Susan, the devoted aunt.  I had placed a volume of engravings before my eyes, and was busily engaged in drawing some plan, on paper, as she entered. I went on for a little while in silence, when she said:  'I understood, sir----'  I said 'wait a minute,' and went on ruling one entire side, with double lines, in perfect forgetfulness of her presence.  When she spoke again, 'Did you send for me, sir?' I would have answered at once, for I felt awfully at appearing such a tyro; but the case was a desperate one of long standing, and required heroic treatment. I kept her waiting, at first as a lesson, that her imagination might take wings and fly to the uttermost realms of unhappiness. The second time, I thought I detected a little impatience in her voice, so I said, taking a pen and dipping it in red ink, 'wait one moment, Susan,' and went on lining and interlining. This was not reading, studying, nor writing; it was what she very well knew I could do any time. So it told on her. Each moment her valor oozed out, and as soon as I felt that the cup of bitterness was pretty well drained, I proceeded to offer up this victim as a sacrifice to peace.  'Susan, how is your sister's child?'  I looked straight into her. There was no sternness or smartness in my expression, but the gaze was mathematical. I was measuring her candor, and analyzing her mind.  She colored up and said, 'he's no better, sir; and they've given him up: but the doctor says good nursing will do wonders.'  'I think so, too. Go back to your sister and stay till he is better; I will supply your place.'  This puzzled her, but she could say nothing. I meant 'go' and she went.--There was no delay--I saw her walk by the window almost at once, and overheard the whisper, 'who next?'  I now rang the bell, and Dinah came to the door, saying, before she knocked, the waiter is out, sir, so I answered your ring.  'Do you know where Thomas lives?'  'Yes sir.'  'Then tell him I want him now--'  'Yes sir,' she disappeared.  Oh the benefit of that _slam_.  In half an hour in walked Thomas.  'Never do you enter my room without knocking. It is a piece of impertinence I will not put up with.'  'I did not mean anything by it, sir.'  'Well, don't do it again, and always take your hat off when you come before a gentleman or lady. Such ignorance might lose you a good place.'  His wages were high I knew. It was also winter, and he gave in. He stood still with his hat in hand and waited.  'Thomas I want you to bring the close carriage to the door with the two bays.'  'Yes sir; but the off horse cast his hind shoe yesterday and I am afraid.'  'You need not be, the ground is covered with snow. I shall want the carriage in fifteen minutes.'  'Yes sir, but--'  'But what?'  'I left the carriage this morning at the blacksmiths to have a new tire put on it, sir.'  'Who told you to?'  'Nobody, sir.'  'Then never do anything of that kind again without first reporting it to me.'  'Yes sir,' moving slightly towards the door as though it was all settled now.  'What other vehicle have you got in the stable?'  'The Ph√¶ton, sir; the open box wagon and the carryall.'  'Very well then, bring the nigh horse round in the carryall.'  'He never went in single harness since I drove Mrs. ----'  'Well, then, put the other one in.'  'Nor him neither, sir.'  'Humph!' it looked a little black.  'Well, where is the other horse, the gray, that your mistress always drives when alone?'  'He is at the veterinary surgeons, sir.--I took him there last Monday and he is to be blistered for two weeks off and on, sir.'  'Well, Thomas, as the coachman of the family, I ask you what can be done.  'I _must_ go out to-night. Can you suggest anything?'  'Nothing but to hire a hack, sir.'  'That's a very good idea, how far is the livery stable from here?'  'Just next to where I live, sir. I can get one in a minute, sir.'  Oh! so cheerfully.  'Very well, Thomas, just harness the two bays and ride down there and put them to one. Tell the livery stable keeper that I wish it, and will pay for the use of it.'  'But, sir, it is----'  'Thomas, I would advise you not to be long. You ought to be ashamed to call yourself a coachman, and have what is under your charge in such a condition. The idea of a horse two days without a shoe.'  'It isn't my----'  'Not a word--go and do your duty in future. I shall expect you here in half an hour.'  He backed out of the room, longing to say something (what it was I don't care) but completely at sea. As he passed under my window, (though I have not sworn for many years,) I am pretty sure I heard several full sized oaths. At the appointed time the bell rang and I went out and got into the carriage. The horses looked very warm, and, though the night was cold, one was covered with foam. I said nothing, but told him to drive to Susan's sister's.  On arriving at the door, I heard sounds of very lively music for a dying child, and saw the house all lighted up.  'Oh, I understand, it is one of those Hibernian wakes. Poor thing!' and I began to pardon Susan, feel sorry for the coachman, and made up my mind to give $10 towards the sepulchral expenses. As I entered the house, surcharged with benevolence and overcome by a repentant feeling, I caught sight of Susan and a strapping man whirling round the floor to the tune of the Irish Washwoman. I approached her and said, 'I hope he is better.' She uttered a scream and ran out of the room.  The next morning after having gone over everything in the house, I sent for each servant and told them quietly but firmly that my sister's health was not very good, and that I was housekeeper--that as they had engaged to fill certain positions, I should take it for granted they understood their business; that I had neither the time nor would I take the trouble to overlook their work, but that as soon as I saw anything wrong they would hear from me. If they wanted anything I was the person. My housekeeping hours were from 9 till 10 a. m., no more. If they could not take the trouble to ask for what they wanted at that time, they could go without till the next day. I should not tell them what to do or when to do it, but if it wasn't done, they would certainly leave. That I allowed no company and gave them certain nights to go out, but if anything special and _true_ was the matter I was ready to assist, 'and now,' said I, 'no quarreling down stairs; each one to their work and no complaining.--The moment you are discontented come to me and you can go at once if you choose. I do not want any notice ever, except where a baby is concerned.' This done I then advertised for a cook. The next day my cook, down stair, came up to me quite flushed, and wanted to know if I intended to turn her away. I said no, I had no idea of it, but thought it was a very good plan to have two in the house; that I intended making the new one a waiter, and then if anything happened, such as the sudden departure, 'of my cook,' I said, looking right at her, 'for you know they are quick tempered, why then I have one on hand.' She colored up and retired. After going through a great deal of nonsense about the words 'help' and 'servants,' I at length got what I wanted and all went on smoothly for a time.  My plan for detecting neglect in the cleaning of a room, was to stick half a dozen pins in different places about it--some on the walls, in the window and other places that ought to be wiped. If I found them there after the cleaning, I became suddenly very disagreeable.  During my sister's administration, I had been obliged to wait sometimes three weeks before she could find time, for her servants, to put a button on my waistcoat. Now, when I wanted anything done, the first person that passed my library door was stopped, no matter what her work might be at the time, sent for a clothes brush, needle or hammar, and the thing was done at once. It acted like a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18770"],["title","A Christmas Story (#3)"],["body","harm, and all went on well. At first they objected, (only silently), but I told them plainly that I hired them for my benefit, not theirs, which generally followed; and that though their work was specified to a certain degree, they must on all occasions answer any calls and pay always for breakage. This last saved twenty dollars a month, for hardly anything under those expensive circumstances, fell of their hands; and I noticed the plea of 'sudden change of weather,' or 'some one must have disturbed it,' or 'that horrid cat has been among those dishes and upset them,' or 'twas cracked before,' became as worn out as aphorisms of the past. I was always very attentive to them when sick. This tells, in the long run, on servants, for they are very susceptible to a kind act out of place--indulgence, however, is soon forgotten. I always made it a habit, too, to pay each servant something more a month than any one else. That, also, acted wonderfully like a retainer. But I distinctly told them I wanted my work done, because it was paid for. I asked no favors. Two other rules saved me much trouble. When a girl said she couldn't do any set job, on account of no time, no matter what it was, I always said, 'why, that's all nonsense; it only takes five minutes;' and not infrequently have I irritated them into doing almost impossibilities. I never valued any cheap article under five dollars.  Another great mistake, is to find fault with a servant before any one. Have they done wrong, go to your library and ring loudly--that is half the battle; then tell the waiter to call the chambermaid, and then speak. You will find everything easy. They have had time to reflect; to weigh the pros and cons, and have half thought themselves into submission. Never argue. If you have the right exert it, but never be unjust; and, above all, believe me when I tell you that their feelings are exquisite on the subject of neglect. Let them once feel a _respect_ for you, yet know you are determined to have anything done, and a simple remark will lie like lead on their stomach, and you will hear them talking of it down stairs and using the bow anchor of firmness, 'he said so,' until it is done. Never change your mind.  I remember once, during that memorable interregnum of three months, and, in fact, the only time in my life did it happen.--I had invited some very pleasant, agreeable and talented friends to spend the evening. I ordered my supper in the morning, and it commenced to snow. I continued giving orders, and it continued snowing, and we kept at it very close on to each other; if anything, the snow was a little ahead, but I went on in the same way. At the proposed time the gas was lit, a lantern was placed on the piazza; snow swept off; the side gate unhung by the waiter man, and a path made. The snow piled high, and the domestics began to give in, or out, I don't know which. They doubted the probability of any one venturing out that 'dreadful night.' A little later, they began to talk among themselves of the improbability of any one coming. I immediately ordered the gas turned up in full; the candles lit, and the supper table laid--every dish put in its place empty, to be filled at the proper time--all for discipline. (I had said it was to be done in the morning.) I then went up stairs and dressed. My sister, who had gained five pounds every week since her abdication, met me in the drawing room, dressed elegantly, and with an encouraging air pressed my hand. She did not dare to make a remark, or the contract would have been violated; but I thought I could detect in her eye an acknowledgment of my success. As I sauntered through the brilliantly lighted rooms, rather depressed at the non-arrival of my guests, the waiter said Thomas would like to speak to me. I immediately went to the star chamber and took an easy position.  A knock this time.  'Come in.'  In walked Thomas with his hat in his hand and bowing respectively, he said--'I have just come from the stable Mr. D'Aubrey, and thought you would like to know about the storm, sir.'  'What storm?' I exclaimed, 'oh, you mean the snow storm, yes--is it still snowing?' At that moment the window was crackling with the hail.  'Yes sir, and I thought I'd tell you that no one could come out to-night, for a horse without a wagon could not walk one hundred yards.'  'Thank you, Thomas, give the bay mare more corn to-morrow and call Henry.'--Henry, the waiter, came in expecting orders to put away the _clean_ things and lock up for it was ten, and not a soul had arrived. 'Order supper Henry at eleven.'  'For whom, sir?'  'For me--what are you waiting for?'  'How much, sir,' said he, in a bewildered air. 'All of it.'  He looked anxious. He could not classify me, but discipline must be carried out, so Mary and I sat down to enough for twenty-five persons, who had never known the pangs of dyspepsia. As soon as we had finished I ordered a large portion of it down stairs, for the benefit of the servants and retired. They all looked pleased and I was satisfied. Mrs. Phillips had the nightmare at about two o'clock.  Before I took charge, the allies of my household were accustomed to come in at all hours and sit up till they were too sleepy to go to bed, looking the next morning like wet blotting paper. But that was soon stopped. For the morning of my address to them I stated that the house was shut up at ten p. m., and now and then it was amusing to hear the door open as the clock struck.  One night at about twelve as I was sitting at my desk in the library, I heard someone trying to get in. I knew it was the waiter who had slipped out without leave, so I turned out the gas, put my head out of the window and said 'I know it must be a robber, for they are all in,' and seeing his form I fired off my revolver overhead.--No servant ever tried again to enter by stealing in after hours. When my sister kept house I suffered much for want of dishes during many days in the week.--There was very little variety.  Sundays we had only potatoes and cold meat.  'Why,' I asked.  'They must go to church, my dear brother.'  Mondays, one fry, not even a roast, it was washing day, all the heat must be turned off from the oven for the boiler.--The cook wouldn't have it roasted in front, the only true way.  So no dessert could be baked.  Tuesdays I could have no company for it was ironing day, and the irons filled up the range and nothing extra could be made. I submitted to my sister.  But now I had soup every day, and whenever I saw anything very good in market I ordered it home and had it cooked. Strange isn't it, with the same range and the same cook? Before my reign we could not breakfast till nine, the cook said that the milkman came so late. During my reign we breakfasted at eight punctually, for I suggested to her the propriety of rising at six instead of seven and letting him in on his first trip instead of taking the milk from him on his return. My sister was obliged to tell her two or three days before hand that she was going to have company, that she might have time to get everything ready for dinner. I frequently brought home two or three guests with fish and game in the same carriage and ordered it as the fourth course while partaking of soup. On one occasion I brought in partridges twenty minutes before dinner. I went down stairs knowing she would be roused this time, and flanked her by saying, 'Hannah, you won't have time to pick those birds, so just draw them and _skin_ them. I want them roasted.' Before she recovered from her astonishment I had departed.  Whenever a quarrel down stairs took place I never interfered as long as they did not talk loud, but the next day if I noticed any one in the sulks or a tendency to let things go by, I had the furniture of one room changed to another. This required 'all hands' to work together, and I made them fly round so, that when it was done they were only too happy to go to lunch and rest, and I could hear many a joke and pleasant laugh rise from the kitchen table.  One rainy evening, as my sister and myself were sitting in front of the wood fire, exactly two months since the famous contract, and very much in the same position, and talking over everything but it, a timid knock was heard. I said 'come in,' and Sabina entered, looking very healthy and neat--I cannot say pretty, though she had a good figure.  I never asked questions on these occasions. I always made it difficult for them to talk in this, to them, gloomy room.--They had to stumble through themselves.  'Can I speak to you, sir.'  'Certainly, Sabina--go on.'  'I have come to say, sir, that--that--I have came to say, sir, that'--a pause; she looked very guilty.  'That's right, Sabina; you have come to say that--I understand--but what have you come to say?'  'I have come to say, sir, that--I have come to go, sir!'  I controlled myself. She was an excellent chambermaid; understood my ways thoroughly; and did her work well; had always been respectful to _me_, and was very steady. It would be a great loss, but DISCIPLINE must be preserved, and my mind was at once made up. My sister looked surprised and sorry right out.  'Well, Sabina, when do you wish to go.'  'On Saturday, sir.'  Oh how my sister wanted to speak, but I looked at the tin box that held the contract and she bit her lip.  'Very well, Sabina, you have a perfect right to go when and where you please, and I will take great pleasure in writing out an excellent character for you. Let me see, (looking at my account book) that is two weeks wages making $8. I never make presents, but as you are going here is a ten dollar bill. Where would you like your trunk carried, tell me and I will send it by Thomas Saturday morning?'  'Oh! it isn't that, sir,' said she, 'but--but, sir,' with the tears flowing rapidly.  'Why, what is the matter, Sabina?' (the first question apart from business I had ever asked.)  'I don't want to leave you, sir.'  'Well, that is strange, then"]]]
