At the doorway of his wigwam Sat the ancient Arrow-maker, In the land of the Dacotahs, Making arrow-heads of jasper, Arrow-heads of chalcedony. At his side, in all her beauty, Sat the lovely Minnehaha, Sat his daughter, Laughing Water, Plaiting mats of flags and rushes Of the past the old man’s thoughts were, And the maiden’s of the future.  He was thinking, as he sat there, Of the days when with such arrows He had struck the deer and bison, On the Muskoday, the meadow; Shot the wild goose, flying southward On the wing, the clamorous Wawa; Thinking of the great war-parties, How they came to buy his arrows, Could not fight without his arrows. Ah, no more such noble warriors Could be found on earth as they were! Now the men were all like women, Only used their tongues for weapons!  She was thinking of a hunter, From another tribe and country, Young and tall and very handsome, Who one morning, in the Spring-time, Came to buy her father’s arrows, Sat and rested in the wigwam, Lingered long about the doorway, Looking back as he departed. She had heard her father praise him, Praise his courage and his wisdom; Would he come again for arrows To the Falls of Minnehaha? On the mat her hands lay idle, And her eyes were very dreamy.  Through their thoughts they heard a footstep, Heard a rustling in the branches, And with glowing cheek and forehead, With the deer upon his shoulders, Suddenly from out the woodlands Hiawatha stood before them.  Straight the ancient Arrow-maker Looked up gravely from his labor, Laid aside the unfinished arrow, Bade him enter at the doorway, Saying, as he rose to meet him, “Hiawatha, you are welcome!”  At the feet of Laughing Water Hiawatha laid his burden, Threw the red deer from his shoulders; And the maiden looked up at him, Looked up from her mat of rushes, Said with gentle look and accent, “You are welcome, Hiawatha!”  Very spacious was the wigwam, Made of deer-skins dressed and whitened, With the Gods of the Dacotahs Drawn and painted on its curtains, And so tall the doorway, hardly Hiawatha stooped to enter, Hardly touched his eagle-feathers As he entered at the doorway.  Then uprose the Laughing Water, From the ground fair Minnehaha, Laid aside her mat unfinished, Brought forth food and set before them, Water brought them from the brooklet, Gave them food in earthen vessels, Gave them drink in bowls of bass-wood, Listened while the guest was speaking, Listened while her father answered, But not once her lips she opened, Not a single word she uttered.  Yes, as in a dream she listened To the words of Hiawatha, As he talked of old Nokomis, Who had nursed him in his childhood, As he told of his companions, Chibiabos, the musician, And the very strong man, Kwasind, And of happiness and plenty In the land of the Ojibways, In the pleasant land and peaceful.  “After many years of warfare, Many years of strife and bloodshed, There is peace between the Ojibways And the tribe of the Dacotahs.” Thus continued Hiawatha, And then added, speaking slowly, “That this peace may last forever, And our hands be clasped more closely, And our hearts be more united, Give me as my wife this maiden, Minnehaha, Laughing Water, Loveliest of Dacotah women!”  And the ancient Arrow-maker Paused a moment ere he answered, Smoked a little while in silence, Looked at Hiawatha proudly, Fondly looked at Laughing Water, And made answer very gravely: “Yes, if Minnehaha wishes; Let your heart speak, Minnehaha!”  And the lovely Laughing Water Seemed more lovely as she stood there, Neither willing nor reluctant, As she went to Hiawatha, Softly took the seat beside him, While she said, and blushed to say it, “I will follow you, my husband!”  This was Hiawatha’s wooing! Thus it was he won the daughter Of the ancient Arrow-maker, In the land of the Dacotahs!  From the wigwam he departed, Leading with him Laughing Water; Hand in hand they went together, Through the woodland and the meadow, Left the old man standing lonely At the doorway of his wigwam, Heard the Falls of Minnehaha Calling to them from the distance, Crying to them from afar off, “Fare thee well, O Minnehaha!”  And the ancient Arrow-maker Turned again unto his labor, Sat down by his sunny doorway, Murmuring to himself, and saying: “Thus it is our daughters leave us, Those we love, and those who love us! Just when they have learned to help us, When we are old and lean upon them, Comes a youth with flaunting feathers, With his flute of reeds, a stranger Wanders piping through the village, Beckons to the fairest maiden, And she follows where he leads her, Leaving all things for the stranger!”  Pleasant was the journey homeward, Through interminable forests, Over meadow, over mountain, Over river, hill, and hollow. Short it seemed to Hiawatha, Though they journeyed very slowly, Though his pace he checked and slackened To the steps of Laughing Water.  Over wide and rushing rivers In his arms he bore the maiden; Light he thought her as a feather, As the plume upon his head-gear; Cleared the tangled pathway for her, Bent aside the swaying branches, Made at night a lodge of branches, And a bed with boughs of hemlock, And a fire before the doorway With the dry cones of the pine-tree.  All the travelling winds went with them, O’er the meadows, through the forest; All the stars of night looked at them, Watched with sleepless eyes their slumber; From his ambush in the oak-tree Peeped the squirrel, Adjidaumo, Watched with eager eyes the lovers; And the rabbit, the Wabasso, Scampered from the path before them, Peering, peeping from his burrow, Sat erect upon his haunches, Watched with curious eyes the lovers.  Pleasant was the journey homeward! All the birds sang loud and sweetly Songs of happiness and heart’s-ease; Sang the bluebird, the Owaissa, “Happy are you, Hiawatha, Having such a wife to love you!” Sang the robin, the Opechee, “Happy are you, Laughing Water, Having such a noble husband!”  From the sky the sun benignant Looked upon them through the branches, Saying to them, “O my children, Love is sunshine, hate is shadow, Life is checkered shade and sunshine, Rule by love, O Hiawatha!”  From the sky the moon looked at them, Filled the lodge with mystic splendors, Whispered to them, “O my children, Day is restless, night is quiet, Man imperious, woman feeble; Half is mine, although I follow; Rule by patience, Laughing Water!”  Thus it was they journeyed homeward; Thus it was that Hiawatha To the lodge of old Nokomis Brought the moonlight, starlight, firelight, Brought the sunshine of his people, Minnehaha, Laughing Water, Handsomest of all the women In the land of the Dacotahs, In the land of handsome women.     XI Hiawatha’s Wedding-Feast   You shall hear how Pau-Puk-Keewis, How the handsome Yenadizze Danced at Hiawatha’s wedding; How the gentle Chibiabos, He the sweetest of musicians, Sang his songs of love and longing; How Iagoo, the great boaster, He the marvellous story-teller, Told his tales of strange adventure, That the feast might be more joyous, That the time might pass more gayly, And the guests be more contented.  Sumptuous was the feast Nokomis Made at Hiawatha’s wedding; All the bowls were made of bass-wood, White and polished very smoothly, All the spoons of horn of bison, Black and polished very smoothly.  She had sent through all the village Messengers with wands of willow, As a sign of invitation, As a token of the feasting; And the wedding guests assembled, Clad in all their richest raiment, Robes of fur and belts of wampum, Splendid with their paint and plumage, Beautiful with beads and tassels.  First they ate the sturgeon, Nahma, And the pike, the Maskenozha, Caught and cooked by old Nokomis; Then on pemican they feasted, Pemican and buffalo marrow, Haunch of deer and hump of bison, Yellow cakes of the Mondamin, And the wild rice of the river.  But the gracious Hiawatha, And the lovely Laughing Water, And the careful old Nokomis, Tasted not the food before them, Only waited on the others Only served their guests in silence.  And when all the guests had finished, Old Nokomis, brisk and busy, From an ample pouch of otter, Filled the red-stone pipes for smoking With tobacco from the South-land, Mixed with bark of the red willow, And with herbs and leaves of fragrance.  Then she said, “O Pau-Puk-Keewis, Dance for us your merry dances, Dance the Beggar’s Dance to please us, That the feast may be more joyous, That the time may pass more gayly, And our guests be more contented!”  Then the handsome Pau-Puk-Keewis, He the idle Yenadizze, He the merry mischief-maker, Whom the people called the Storm-Fool, Rose among the guests assembled.  Skilled was he in sports and pastimes, In the merry dance of snow-shoes, In the play of quoits and ball-play; Skilled was he in games of hazard, In all games of skill and hazard, Pugasaing, the Bowl and Counters, Kuntassoo, the Game of Plum-stones. Though the warriors called him Faint-Heart, Called him coward, Shaugodaya, Idler, gambler, Yenadizze, Little heeded he their jesting, Little cared he for their insults, For the women and the maidens Loved the handsome Pau-Puk-Keewis.  He was dressed in shirt of doeskin, White and soft, and fringed with ermine, All inwrought with beads of wampum; He was dressed in deer-skin leggings, Fringed with hedgehog quills and ermine, And in moccasins of buck-skin, Thick with quills and beads"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19000"],["title","Printcrime (#0)"],["body","(C) 2006 by Cory Doctorow.    Printcrime  (originally published in Nature Magazine, January 2006)  Cory Doctorow  The coppers smashed my father's printer when I was eight.  I remember the hot, cling-film-in-a-microwave smell of it, and Da's look of ferocious concentration as he filled it with fresh goop, and the warm, fresh-baked feel of the objects that came out of it.  The coppers came through the door with truncheons swinging, one of them reciting the terms of the warrant through a bullhorn.  One of Da's customers had shopped him.  The ipolice paid in high-grade pharmaceuticals -- performance enhancers, memory supplements, metabolic boosters.  The kind of things that cost a fortune over the counter; the kind of things you could print at home, if you didn't mind the risk of having your kitchen filled with a sudden crush of big, beefy bodies, hard truncheons whistling through the air, smashing anyone and anything that got in the way.  They destroyed grandma's trunk, the one she'd brought from the old country.  They smashed our little refrigerator and the purifier unit over the window.  My tweetybird escaped death by hiding in a corner of his cage as a big, booted foot crushed most of it into a sad tangle of printer-wire.  Da.  What they did to him.  When he was done, he looked like he'd been brawling with an entire rugby side.  They brought him out the door and let the newsies get a good look at him as they tossed him in the car. All the while a spokesman told the world that my Da's organized-crime bootlegging operation had been responsible for at least 20 million in contraband, and that my Da, the desperate villain, had resisted arrest.  I saw it all from my phone, in the remains of the sitting room, watching it on the screen and wondering how, just how anyone could look at our little flat and our terrible, manky estate and mistake it for the home of an organized crime kingpin.  They took the printer away, of course, and displayed it like a trophy for the newsies.  Its little shrine in the kitchenette seemed horribly empty.  When I roused myself and picked up the flat and rescued my poor peeping tweetybird, I put a blender there.  It was made out of printed parts, so it would only last a month before I'd need to print new bearings and other moving parts.  Back then, I could take apart and reassemble anything that could be printed.  By the time I turned 18, they were ready to let Da out of prison.  I'd visited him three times -- on my tenth birthday, on his fiftieth, and when Ma died.  It had been two years since I'd last seen him and he was in bad shape.  A prison fight had left him with a limp, and he looked over his shoulder so often it was like he had a tic.  I was embarrassed when the minicab dropped us off in front of the estate, and tried to keep my distance from this ruined, limping skeleton as we went inside and up the stairs.  \"Lanie,\" he said, as he sat me down.  \"You're a smart girl, I know that. You wouldn't know where your old Da could get a printer and some goop?\"  I squeezed my hands into fists so tight my fingernails cut into my palms.  I closed my eyes.  \"You've been in prison for ten years, Da. Ten.  Years.  You're going to risk another ten years to print out more blenders and pharma, more laptops and designer hats?\"  He grinned.  \"I'm not stupid, Lanie.  I've learned my lesson.  There's no hat or laptop that's worth going to jail for.  I'm not going to print none of that rubbish, never again.\" He had a cup of tea, and he drank it now like it was whisky, a sip and then a long, satisfied exhalation.  He closed his eyes and leaned back in his chair.  \"Come here, Lanie, let me whisper in your ear.  Let me tell you the thing that I decided while I spent ten years in lockup.  Come here and listen to your stupid Da.\"  I felt a guilty pang about ticking him off.  He was off his rocker, that much was clear.  God knew what he went through in prison.  \"What, Da?\" I said, leaning in close.  \"Lanie, I'm going to print more printers.  Lots more printers.  One for everyone.  That's worth going to jail for.  That's worth anything.\"  --------  Cory Doctorow has spent the past four years at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (www.eff.org), fighting at the United Nations and in tech-standards bodies to balance the rights of copyright and patent holders with the public interest.
