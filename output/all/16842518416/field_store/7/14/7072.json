However, I called to him and he came up from the smoky camp-fire, axe on shoulder.  \"Yep,\" he said, squatting beside me; \"the Graham Glacier used to meander through that there hole, but somethin' went wrong with the earth's in'ards an' there was a bust-up.\"  \"And you saw it, William?\" I said, with a sigh of envy.  \"Hey? Seen it? Sure I seen it! I was to Spoutin' Springs, twenty mile west, with a bale o' blue fox an' otter pelt. Fust I knew them geysers begun for to groan egregious like, an' I seen the caribou gallopin' hell-bent south. 'This climate,' sez I, 'is too bracin' for me,' so I struck a back trail an' landed onto a hill. Then them geysers blowed up, one arter the next, an' I heard somethin' kinder cave in between here an' China. I disremember things what happened. Somethin' throwed me down, but I couldn't stay there, for the blamed ground was runnin' like a river--all wavy-like, an' the sky hit me on the back o' me head.\"  \"And then?\" I urged, in that new excitement which every repetition of the story revived. I had heard it all twenty times since we left New York, but mere repetition could not apparently satisfy me.  \"Then,\" continued William, \"the whole world kinder went off like a fire-cracker, an' I come too, an' ran like--\"  \"I know,\" said I, cutting him short, for I had become wearied of the invariable profanity which lent a lurid ending to his narrative.  \"After that,\" I continued, \"you went through the rent in the mountains?\"  \"Sure.\"  \"And you saw a dingue and a creature that resembled a mammoth?\"  \"Sure,\" he repeated, sulkily.  \"And you saw something else?\" I always asked this question; it fascinated me to see the sullen fright flicker in William's eyes, and the mechanical backward glance, as though what he had seen might still be behind him.  He had never answered this third question but once, and that time he fairly snarled in my face as he growled: \"I seen what no Christian oughter see.\"  So when I repeated: \"And you saw something else, William?\" he gave me a wicked, frightened leer, and shuffled off to feed the mules. Flattery, entreaties, threats left him unmoved; he never told me what the third thing was that he had seen behind the Hudson Mountains.  William had retired to mix up with his mules; I resumed my binoculars and my silent inspection of the great, smooth path left by the Graham Glacier when something or other exploded that vast mass of ice into vapor.  The arid plain wound out from the unknown country like a river, and I thought then, and think now, that when the glacier was blown into vapor the vapor descended in the most terrific rain the world has ever seen, and poured through the newly blasted mountain-gateway, sweeping the earth to bed-rock. To corroborate this theory, miles to the southward I could see the d√©bris winding out across the land towards Wellman Bay, but as the terminal moraine of the vanished glacier formerly ended there I could not be certain that my theory was correct. Owing to the formation of the mountains I could not see more than half a mile into the unknown country. What I could see appeared to be nothing but the continuation of the glacier's path, scored out by the cloud-burst, and swept as smooth as a floor.  Sitting there, my heart beating heavily with excitement, I looked through the evening glow at the endless, pine-crowned mountain-wall with its giant's gateway pierced for me! And I thought of all the explorers and the unknown heroes--trappers, Indians, humble naturalists, perhaps--who had attempted to scale that sheer barricade and had died there or failed, beaten back from those eternal cliffs. Eternal? No! For the Eternal Himself had struck the rock, and it had sprung asunder, thundering obedience.  In the still evening air the smoke from the fire below mounted in a straight, slender pillar, like the smoke from those ancient altars builded before the first blood had been shed on earth.  The evening wind stirred the pines; a tiny spring brook made thin harmony among the rocks; a murmur came from the quiet camp. It was William adjuring his mules. In the deepening twilight I descended the hillock, stepping cautiously among the rocks.  Then, suddenly, as I stood outside the reddening ring of firelight, far in the depths of the unknown country, far behind the mountain-wall, a sound grew on the quiet air. William heard it and turned his face to the mountains. The sound faded to a vibration which was felt, not heard. Then once more I began to divine a vibration in the air, gathering in distant volume until it became a sound, lasting the space of a spoken word, fading to vibration, then silence.  Was it a cry?  I looked at William inquiringly. He had quietly fainted away.  I got him to the little brook and poked his head into the icy water, and after a while he sat up pluckily.  To an indignant question he replied: \"Naw, I ain't a-cussin' you. Lemme be or I'll have fits.\"  \"Was it that sound that scared you?\" I asked.  \"Ya-as,\" he replied with a dauntless shiver.  \"Was it the voice of the mammoth?\" I persisted, excitedly. \"Speak, William, or I'll drag you about and kick you!\"  He replied that it was neither a mammoth nor a dingue, and added a strong request for privacy, which I was obliged to grant, as I could not torture another word out of him.  I slept little that night; the exciting proximity of the unknown land was too much for me. But although I lay awake for hours, I heard nothing except the tinkle of water among the rocks and the plover calling from some hidden marsh. At daybreak I shot a ptarmigan which had walked into camp, and the shot set the echoes yelling among the mountains.  William, sullen and heavy-eyed, dressed the bird, and we broiled it for breakfast.  Neither he nor I alluded to the sound we had heard the night before; he boiled water and cleaned up the mess-kit, and I pottered about among the rocks for another ptarmigan. Wearying of this, presently, I returned to the mules and William, and sat down for a smoke.  \"It strikes me,\" I said, \"that our instructions to 'await further orders' are idiotic. How are we to receive 'further orders' here?\"  William did not know.  \"You don't suppose,\" said I, in sudden disgust, \"that Miss Smawl believes there is a summer hotel and daily mail service in the Hudson Mountains?\"  William thought perhaps she did suppose something of the sort.  It irritated me beyond measure to find myself at last on the very border of the unknown country, and yet checked, held back, by the irresponsible orders of a maiden lady named Smawl. However, my salary depended upon the whim of that maiden lady, and although I fussed and fumed and glared at the mountains through my glasses, I realized that I could not stir without the permission of Miss Smawl. At times this grotesque situation became almost unbearable, and I often went away by myself and indulged in fantasies, firing my gun off and pretending I had hit Miss Smawl by mistake. At such moments I would imagine I was free at last to plunge into the strange country, and I would squat on a rock and dream of bagging my first mammoth.  The time passed heavily; the tension increased with each new day. I shot ptarmigan and kept our table supplied with brook-trout. William chopped wood, conversed with his mules, and cooked very badly.  \"See here,\" I said, one morning; \"we have been in camp a week to-day, and I can't stand your cooking another minute!\"  William, who was washing a saucepan, looked up and begged me sarcastically to accept the _cordon bleu_. But I know only how to cook eggs, and there were no eggs within some hundred miles.  To get the flavor of the breakfast out of my mouth I walked up to my favorite hillock and sat down for a smoke. The next moment, however, I was on my feet, cheering excitedly and shouting for William.  \"Here come 'further instructions' at last!\" I cried, pointing to the southward, where two dots on the grassy plain were imperceptibly moving in our direction.  \"People on mules,\" said William, without enthusiasm.  \"They must be messengers for us!\" I cried, in chaste joy. \"Three cheers for the northward trail, William, and the mischief take Miss--Well, never mind now,\" I added.  \"On them approachin' mules,\" observed William, \"there is wimmen.\"  I stared at him for a second, then attempted to strike him. He dodged wearily and repeated his incredible remark: \"Ya-as, there is--wimmen--two female ladies onto them there mules.\"  \"Bring me my glasses!\" I said, hoarsely; \"bring me those glasses, William, because I shall destroy you if you don't!\"  Somewhat awed by my calm fury, he hastened back to camp and returned with the binoculars. It was a breathless moment. I adjusted the lenses with a steady hand and raised them.  Now, of all unexpected sights my fate may reserve for me in the future, I trust--nay, I know--that none can ever prove as unwelcome as the sight I perceived through my binoculars. For upon the backs of those distant mules were two women, and the first one was Miss Smawl!  Upon her head she wore a helmet, from which fluttered a green veil. Otherwise she was clothed in tweeds; and at moments she beat upon her mule with a thick umbrella.  Surfeited with the sickening spectacle, I sat down on a rock and tried to cry.  \"I told yer so,\" observed William; but I was too tired to attack him.  When the caravan rode into camp I was myself again, smilingly prepared for the worst, and I advanced, cap in hand, followed furtively by William.  \"Welcome,\" I said, violently injecting joy into my voice. \"Welcome, Professor Smawl, to the Hudson Mountains!\"  \"Kindly take my mule,\" she said, climbing down to mother earth.  \"William,\" I said, with dignity, \"take the lady's mule.\"  Miss Smawl gave me a stolid glance, then made directly for the camp-fire, where a kettle of game-broth simmered over the coals. The last I saw of her she was smelling of it, and I turned my back and advanced"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18668"],["title","In Search of the Unknown (#8)"],["body"," the second lady pilgrim, prepared to be civil until snubbed.  Now, it is quite certain that never before had William Spike or I beheld so much feminine loveliness in one human body on the back of a mule. She was clad in the daintiest of shooting-kilts, yet there was nothing mannish about her except the way she rode the mule, and that only accentuated her adorable femininity.  I remembered what Professor Lesard had said about blue stockings--but Miss Dorothy Van Twiller's were gray, turned over at the tops, and disappearing into canvas spats buckled across a pair of slim shooting-boots.  \"Welcome,\" said I, attempting to restrain a too violent cordiality. \"Welcome, Professor Van Twiller, to the Hudson Mountains.\"  \"Thank you,\" she replied, accepting my assistance very sweetly; \"it is a pleasure to meet a human being again.\"  I glanced at Miss Smawl. She was eating game-broth, but she resembled a human being in a general way.  \"I should very much like to wash my hands,\" said Professor Van Twiller, drawing the buckskin gloves from her slim fingers.  I brought towels and soap and conducted her to the brook.  She called to Professor Smawl to join her, and her voice was crystalline; Professor Smawl declined, and her voice was batrachian.  \"She is so hungry!\" observed Miss Van Twiller. \"I am very thankful we are here at last, for we've had a horrid time. You see, we neither of us know how to cook.\"  I wondered what they would say to William's cooking, but I held my peace and retired, leaving the little brook to mirror the sweetest face that was ever bathed in water.     VIII   That afternoon our expedition, in two sections, moved forward. The first section comprised myself and all the mules; the second section was commanded by Professor Smawl, followed by Professor Van Twiller, armed with a tiny shot-gun. William, loaded down with the ladies' toilet articles, skulked in the rear. I say skulked; there was no other word for it.  \"So you're a guide, are you?\" observed Professor Smawl when William, cap in hand, had approached her with well-meant advice. \"The woods are full of lazy guides. Pick up those Gladstone bags! I'll do the guiding for this expedition.\"  Made cautious by William's humiliation, I associated with the mules exclusively. Nevertheless, Professor Smawl had her hard eyes on me, and I realized she meant mischief.  The encounter took place just as I, driving the five mules, entered the great mountain gateway, thrilled with anticipation which almost amounted to foreboding. As I was about to set foot across the imaginary frontier which divided the world from the unknown land, Professor Smawl hailed me and I halted until she came up.  \"As commander of this expedition,\" she said, somewhat out of breath, \"I desire to be the first living creature who has ever set foot behind the Graham Glacier. Kindly step aside, young sir!\"  \"Madam,\" said I, rigid with disappointment, \"my guide, William Spike, entered that unknown land a year ago.\"  \"He _says_ he did,\" sneered Professor Smawl.  \"As you like,\" I replied; \"but it is scarcely generous to forestall the person whose stupidity gave you the clew to this unexplored region.\"  \"You mean yourself?\" she asked, with a stony stare.  \"I do,\" said I, firmly.  Her little, hard eyes grew harder, and she clutched her umbrella until the steel ribs crackled.  \"Young man,\" she said, insolently; \"if I could have gotten rid of you I should have done so the day I was appointed president. But Professor Farrago refused to resign unless your position was assured, subject, of course, to your good behavior. Frankly, I don't like you, and I consider your views on science ridiculous, and if an opportunity presents itself I will be most happy to request your resignation. Kindly collect your mules and follow me.\"  Mortified beyond measure, I collected my mules and followed my president into the strange country behind the Hudson Mountains--I who had aspired to lead, compelled to follow in the rear, driving mules.  The journey was monotonous at first, but we shortly ascended a ridge from which we could see, stretching out below us, the wilderness where, save the feet of William Spike, no human feet had passed.  As for me, tingling with enthusiasm, I forgot my chagrin, I forgot the gross injustice, I forgot my mules. \"Excelsior!\" I cried, running up and down the ridge in uncontrollable excitement at the sublime spectacle of forest, mountain, and valley all set with little lakes.  \"Excelsior!\" repeated an excited voice at my side, and Professor Van Twiller sprang to the ridge beside me, her eyes bright as stars.  Exalted, inspired by the mysterious beauty of the view, we clasped hands and ran up and down the grassy ridge.  \"That will do,\" said Professor Smawl, coldly, as we raced about like a pair of distracted kittens. The chilling voice broke the spell; I dropped Professor Van Twiller's hand and sat down on a bowlder, aching with wrath.  Late that afternoon we halted beside a tiny lake, deep in the unknown wilderness, where purple and scarlet bergamot choked the shores and the spruce-partridge strutted fearlessly under our very feet. Here we pitched our two tents. The afternoon sun slanted through the pines; the lake glittered; acres of golden brake perfumed the forest silence, broken only at rare intervals by the distant thunder of a partridge drumming.  Professor Smawl ate heavily and retired to her tent to lie torpid until evening. William drove the unloaded mules into an intervale full of sun-cured, fragrant grasses; I sat down beside Professor Van Twiller.  The wilderness is electric. Once within the influence of its currents, human beings become positively or negatively charged, violently attracting or repelling each other.  \"There is something the matter with this air,\" said Professor Van Twiller. \"It makes me feel as though I were desperately enamoured of the entire human race.\"  She leaned back against a pine, smiling vaguely, and crossing one knee over the other.  Now I am not bold by temperament, and, normally, I fear ladies. Therefore it surprised me to hear myself begin a frivolous _causerie_, replying to her pretty epigrams with epigrams of my own, advancing to the borderland of badinage, fearlessly conducting her and myself over that delicate frontier to meet upon the terrain of undisguised flirtation.  It was clear that she was out for a holiday. The seriousness and restraints of twenty-two years she had left behind her in the civilized world, and now, with a shrug of her young shoulders, she unloosened her burden of reticence, dignity, and responsibility and let the whole load fall with a discreet thud.  \"Even hares go mad in March,\" she said, seriously. \"I know you intend to flirt with me--and I don't care. Anyway, there's nothing else to do, is there?\"  \"Suppose,\" said I, solemnly, \"I should take you behind that big tree and attempt to kiss you!\"  The prospect did not appear to appall her, so I looked around with that sneaking yet conciliatory caution peculiar to young men who are novices in the art. Before I had satisfied myself that neither William nor the mules were observing us, Professor Van Twiller rose to her feet and took a short step backward.  \"Let's set traps for a dingue,\" she said, \"will you?\"  I looked at the big tree, undecided. \"Come on,\" she said; \"I'll show you how.\" And away we went into the woods, she leading, her kilts flashing through the golden half-light.  Now I had not the faintest notion how to trap the dingue, but Professor Van Twiller asserted that it formerly fed on the tender tips of the spruce, quoting Darwin as her authority.  So we gathered a bushel of spruce-tips, piled them on the bank of a little stream, then built a miniature stockade around the bait, a foot high. I roofed this with hemlock, then laboriously whittled out and adjusted a swinging shutter for the entrance, setting it on springy twigs.  \"The dingue, you know, was supposed to live in the water,\" she said, kneeling beside me over our trap.  I took her little hand and thanked her for the information.  \"Doubtless,\" she said, enthusiastically, \"a dingue will come out of the lake to-night to feed on our spruce-tips. Then,\" she added, \"we've got him.\"  \"True!\" I said, earnestly, and pressed her fingers very gently.  Her face was turned a little away; I don't remember what she said; I don't remember that she said anything. A faint rose-tint stole over her cheek. A few moments later she said: \"You must not do that again.\"  It was quite late when we strolled back to camp. Long before we came in sight of the twin tents we heard a deep voice bawling our names. It was Professor Smawl, and she pounced upon Dorothy and drove her ignominiously into the tent.  \"As for you,\" she said, in hollow tones, \"you may explain your conduct at once, or place your resignation at my disposal.\"  But somehow or other I appeared to be temporarily lost to shame, and I only smiled at my infuriated president, and entered my own tent with a step that was distinctly frolicsome.  \"Billy,\" said I to William Spike, who regarded me morosely from the depths of the tent, \"I'm going out to bag a mammoth to-morrow, so kindly clean my elephant-gun and bring an axe to chop out the tusks.\"  That night Professor Smawl complained bitterly of the cooking, but as neither Dorothy nor I knew how to improve it, she revenged herself on us by eating everything on the table and retiring to bed, taking Dorothy with her.  I could not sleep very well; the mosquitoes were intrusive, and Professor Smawl dreamed she was a pack of wolves and yelped in her sleep.  \"Bird, ain't she?\" said William, roused from slumber by her weird noises.  Dorothy, much frightened, crawled out of her tent, where her blanket-mate still dreamed dyspeptically, and William and I made her comfortable by the camp-fire.  It takes a pretty girl to look pretty half asleep in a blanket.  \"Are you sure you are quite well?\" I asked her.  To make sure, I tested her pulse."]]]
