I joined him at once.  \"Who was that?\" he half whispered.  \"Johnson.\"  \"Oh, yes.\" He fumbled in his uniform; his gaze swept the moonlit deck. \"Gregg--take this.\" He handed me a small metal box. I stuffed it at once into my shirt.  \"An insulator,\" he added swiftly. \"Snap is in his office. Take it to him, Gregg. Stay with him--you'll have a measure of security--and you can help him to make the photographs.\" He was barely whispering. \"I won't be with you--no use making it look as though we were doing anything unusual. If your graphs show anything--or if Snap picks up any message--bring it to me.\" He added aloud, \"Well, it will be cool enough presently, Gregg.\"  He sauntered away toward his chart room.  \"By heavens, what a relief!\" Snap murmured as the current went on. We had wired his cubby with the insulator; within its barrage we could at least talk with a degree of freedom.  \"You've seen George Prince, Gregg?\"  \"No. He's assigned A20. But I saw his sister. Snap, no one ever mentioned--\"  Snap had heard of her, but he hadn't known that she was listed for this voyage. \"A real beauty, so I've heard. Accursed shame for a decent girl to have a brother like that.\"  I could agree with him there....  It was now six A.M. Snap had been busy all night with routine cosmos-radios from the Earth, following our departure. He had a pile of them beside him.  \"Nothing queer looking?\" I suggested.  \"No. Not a thing.\"  We were at this time no more than sixty-five thousand miles from the Moon's surface. The _Planetara_ presently would swing upon her direct course for Mars. There was nothing which could cause passenger comment in this close passing of the Moon; normally we used the satellite's attraction to give us additional starting speed.  It was now or never that a message would come from Grantline. He was supposed to be upon the Earthward side of the Moon. While Snap had rushed through with his routine, I searched the Moon's surface with our glass.  But there was nothing. Copernicus and Kepler lay in full sunlight. The heights of the lunar mountains, the depths of the barren, empty seas were etched black and white, clear and clean. Grim, forbidding desolation, this unchanging Moon. In romance, moonlight may shimmer and sparkle to light a lover's smile; but the reality of the Moon is cold and bleak. There was nothing to show my prying eyes where the intrepid Grantline might be.  \"Nothing at all, Snap.\"  And Snap's instruments, attuned for an hour now to pick up the faintest signal, were motionless.  \"If he has concentrated any appreciable amount of ore,\" said Snap. \"We should get an impulse from its rays.\"  But our receiving shield was dark, untouched. Our mirror grid gave the magnified images; the spectro, with its wave length selection, pictured the mountain levels and slowly descended into the deepest seas.  There was nothing.  Yet in those Moon caverns--a million million recesses amid the crags of that tumbled, barren surface--the pin point of movement which might have been Grantline's expedition could so easily be hiding! Could he have the ore insulated, fearing its rays would betray its presence to hostile watchers?  Or might disaster have come to him? He might not be on this hemisphere of the Moon at all....  My imagination, sharpened by fancy of a lurking menace which seemed everywhere about the _Planetara_ this voyage, ran rife with fears for Johnny Grantline. He had promised to communicate this voyage. It was now, or perhaps never.  Six-thirty came and passed. We were well beyond the Earth's shadow now. The firmament blazed with its vivid glories; the Sun behind us was a ball of yellow-red leaping flames. The Earth hung, a huge, dull red half sphere.  We were within forty thousand miles of the Moon. A giant white ball--all of its disc visible to the naked eye. It poised over the bow, and presently, as the _Planetara_ swung upon its course for Mars, it shifted sidewise. The light of it glared white and dazzling in our windows.  Snap, with his habitual red celluloid eyeshade shoved high on his forehead, worked over our instruments.  \"Gregg!\"  The receiving shield was glowing a trifle. Rays were bombarding it! It glowed, gleamed phosphorescent, and the audible recorder began sounding its tiny tinkling murmurs.  Gamma rays! Snap sprang to the dials. The direction and strength were soon obvious. A richly radioactive ore body was concentrated upon this hemisphere of the Moon! It was unmistakable.  \"He's got it, Gregg! He's--\"  The tiny grids began quivering. Snap exclaimed triumphantly, \"Here he comes! By God, the message at last!\"  Snap decoded it.  _Success! Stop for ore on your return voyage. Will give you our location later. Success beyond wildest hopes._  Snap murmured, \"That's all. He's got the ore!\"  We were sitting in darkness, and abruptly I became aware that across our open window, where the insulation barrage was flung, the air was faintly hissing. An interference there! I saw a tiny swirl of purple sparks. Someone--some hostile ray from the deck beneath us, or from the spider bridge that led to our little room--someone out there was trying to pry in!  Snap impulsively reached for the absorbers to let in the outside light. But I checked him.  \"Wait!\" I cut off our barrage, opened our door and stepped to the narrow metal bridge.  \"You stay there, Snap!\" I whispered. Then I added aloud, \"Well, Snap, I'm going to bed. Glad you've cleaned up that batch of work.\"  I banged the door upon him. The lacework of metal bridges seemed empty. I gazed up to the dome, and forward and aft. Twenty feet beneath me was the metal roof of the cabin superstructure. Below it, both sides of the deck showed. All patched with moonlight.  No one visible down there. I descended a ladder. The deck was empty. But in the silence something was moving! Footsteps moving away from me down the deck! I followed; and suddenly I was running. Chasing something I could hear, but could not see. It turned into the smoking room.  I burst in. And a real sound smothered the phantom. Johnson the purser was sitting here alone in the dimness. He was smoking. I noticed that his cigar held a long frail ash. It could not have been him I was chasing. He was sitting there quite calmly. A thick-necked, heavy fellow, easily out of breath. But he was breathing calmly now.  He sat up in amazement at my wild-eyed appearance, and the ash jarred from his cigar.  \"Gregg! What in the devil--\"  I tried to grin. \"I'm on my way to bed--worked all night helping Snap.\"  I went past him, out the door into the main corridor. It was the only way the invisible prowler could have gone. But I was too late now--I could hear nothing. I dashed forward into the main lounge. It was empty, dim and silent, a silence broken presently by a faint click, a stateroom door hastily closing. I swung and found myself in a tiny transverse passage. The twin doors of A20 and A22 were before me.  The invisible eavesdropper had gone into one of these rooms! I listened at each of the panels, but there was only silence within.  The interior of the ship was suddenly singing with the steward's siren--the call to awaken the passengers. It startled me. I moved swiftly away. But as the siren shut off, in the silence I heard a soft, musical voice:  \"Wake up, Anita, I think that's the breakfast call.\"  And her answer, \"All right, George.\"     IV   I did not appear at that morning meal. I was exhausted and drugged with lack of sleep. I had a moment with Snap to tell him what had occurred. Then I sought out Carter. He had his little chart room insulated. And we were cautious. I told him what Snap and I had learned: the rays from the Moon, proving that Grantline had concentrated a considerable ore body. I also told him of Grantline's message.  \"We'll stop on the way back, as he directs, Gregg.\" He bent closer to me. \"At Ferrok-Shahn I'm going to bring back a cordon of Interplanetary Police. The secret will be out, of course, when we stop at the Moon. We have no right, even now, to be flying this vessel as unguarded as it is.\"  He was very solemn. And he was grim when I told him of the invisible eavesdropper.  \"You think he overheard Grantline's message? Who was it? You seem to feel it was George Prince?\"  I told him I was convinced the prowler went into A20. When I mentioned the purser, who seemed to have been watching me earlier in the night, and again was sitting in the smoking room when the eavesdropper fled past, Carter looked startled.  \"Johnson is all right, Gregg.\"  \"Does he know anything about this Grantline affair?\"  \"No--no,\" said Carter hastily. \"You haven't mentioned it, have you?\"  \"Of course I haven't. But why didn't Johnson hear that eavesdropper? And what was he doing there, anyway, at that hour of the morning?\"  The Captain ignored my questions. \"I'm going to have that Prince suite searched--we can't be too careful.... Go to bed, Gregg, you need rest.\"  I went to my cabin. It was located aft, on the stern deck, near the stern watch tower. A small metal room with a chair, a desk and a bunk. I made sure no one was in it. I sealed the lattice grill and the door, set the alarm trigger against any opening of them, and went to bed.  The siren for the midday meal awakened me. I had slept heavily. I felt refreshed.  I found the passengers already assembled at my table when I arrived in the dining salon. It was a low vaulted metal room with blue and yellow tube lights. At its sides the oval windows showed the deck, with its ports on the dome side, through which a vista of the starry firmament was visible. We were well on our course to Mars. The Moon had dwindled to a pin point of light beside the crescent Earth. And behind them our Sun blazed, visually the largest orb in the heavens. It was some sixty-eight million miles from the Earth to Mars. A flight, ordinarily, of some ten days.  There were five "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19066"],["title","Brigands of the Moon (#4)"],["body","in the dining salon, each with eight seats. Snap and I had one of the tables. We sat at the ends, with the passengers on each of the sides.  Snap was in his seat when I arrived. He eyed me down the length of the table. In a gay mood, he introduced me to the three men already seated:  \"This is our third officer, Gregg Haljan. Big, handsome fellow, isn't he? And as pleasant as he is good-looking. Gregg, this is Sero Ob Hahn.\"  I met the keen, somber gaze of a Venus man of middle age. A small, slim graceful man, with sleek black hair. His pointed face, accentuated by the pointed beard, was pallid. He wore a white and purple robe; upon his breast was a huge platinum ornament, a device like a star and cross entwined.  \"I am happy to meet you, sir.\" His voice was soft and deep.  \"Ob Hahn,\" I repeated. \"I should have heard of you, no doubt, but--\"  A smile plucked at his thin, gray lips. \"That is an error of mine, not yours. My mission is that all the universe shall hear of me.\"  \"He's preaching the religion of the Venus mystics,\" Snap explained.  \"And this enlightened gentleman,\" said Ob Hahn ironically, nodding to the man, \"has just termed it fetishism. The ignorance--\"  \"Oh, I say!\" protested the man at Ob Hahn's side. \"I mean, you seem to think I meant something offensive. And as a matter of fact--\"  \"We've an argument, Gregg,\" laughed Snap. \"This is Sir Arthur Coniston, an English gentleman, lecturer and sky-trotter--that is, he will be a sky-trotter; he tells us he plans a number of voyages.\"  The tall Englishman, in his white linen suit, bowed acknowledgement. \"My compliments, Mr. Haljan. I hope you have no strong religious convictions, else we will make your table here very miserable!\"  The third passenger had evidently kept out of the argument. Snap introduced him as Rance Rankin. An American--a quiet, blond fellow of thirty-five or forty.  I ordered my breakfast and let the argument go on.  \"Won't make me miserable,\" said Snap. \"I love an argument. You said, Sir Arthur--\"  \"I mean to say, I think I said too much. Mr. Rankin, you are more diplomatic.\"  Rankin laughed. \"I am a magician,\" he said to me. \"A theatrical entertainer. I deal in tricks--how to fool an audience--\" His keen, amused gaze was on Ob Hahn. \"This gentleman from Venus and I have too much in common to argue.\"  \"A nasty one!\" the Englishman exclaimed. \"By Jove! Really, Mr. Rankin, you're a bit too cruel!\"  I could see we were doomed to have turbulent meals this voyage. I like to eat in quiet; arguing passengers always annoy me. There were still three seats vacant at our table; I wondered who would occupy them. I soon learned the answer--for one seat at least. Rankin said calmly:  \"Where is the little Venus girl this meal?\" His glance went to the empty seat at my right hand. \"The Venza, isn't that her name? She and I are destined for the same theater in Ferrok-Shahn.\"  So Venza was to sit beside me. It was good news. Ten days of a religious argument three times a day would be intolerable. But the cheerful Venza would help.  \"She never eats the midday meal,\" said Snap. \"She's on the deck, having orange juice. I guess it's the old gag about diet, eh?\"  My attention wandered about the salon. Most of the seats were occupied. At the Captain's table I saw the objects of my search: George Prince and his sister, one on each side of the Captain. I saw George Prince in the life now as a man who looked hardly twenty-five. He was at this moment evidently in a gay mood. His clean-cut, handsome profile, with its poetic dark curls, was turned toward me. There seemed little of the villain about him.  And I saw Anita Prince now as a dark-haired, black-eyed little beauty, in feature resembling her brother very strongly. She presently finished her meal. She rose, with him after her. She was dressed in Earth-fashion--white blouse and dark jacket, wide, knee-length trousers of gray, with a red sash her only touch of color. She went past me, flashed me a smile.  My heart was pounding. I answered her greeting, and met George Prince's casual gaze. He, too, smiled, as though to signify that his sister had told him of the service I had done her. Or was his smile an ironical memory of how he had eluded me this morning when I chased him?  I gazed after his small white-suited figure as he followed Anita from the salon. And thinking of her, I prayed that Carter and Halsey might be wrong. Whatever plotting against the Grantline Expedition might be going on, I hoped that George Prince was innocent of it. Yet I knew in my heart it was a futile hope. Prince had been the eavesdropper outside the radio room. I could not doubt it. But that his sister must be ignorant of what he was doing, I was sure.  My attention was brought suddenly back to the reality of our table. I heard Ob Hahn's silky voice. \"We passed quite close to the Moon last night, Mr. Dean.\"  \"Yes,\" said Snap. \"We did, didn't we? Always do--it's a technical problem of the exigencies of interstellar navigation. Explain it to them, Gregg. You're an expert.\"  I waved it away with a laugh. There was a brief silence. I could not help noticing Sir Arthur Coniston's queer look, and I have never seen so keen a glance as Rance Rankin shot at me. Were all three people aware of Grantline's treasure on the Moon? It suddenly seemed so. I wished fervently at that instant that the ten days of this voyage were over. Captain Carter was right. Coming back we should have a cordon of Interplanetary Police aboard.  Sir Arthur broke the awkward silence. \"Magnificent sight, the Moon, from so close--though I was too much afraid of pressure sickness to be up to see it.\"  I had nearly finished my hasty meal when another incident shocked me. The two other passengers at our table came in and took their seats. A Martian girl and man. The girl had the seat at my left, with the man beside her. All Martians are tall. The girl was about my own height. That is, six feet, two inches. The man was seven feet or more. Both wore the Martian outer robe. The girl flung hers back. Her limbs were encased in pseudomail. She looked, as all Martians like to look, a very warlike Amazon. But she was a pretty girl. She smiled at me with a keen-eyed, direct gaze.  \"Mr. Dean said at breakfast that you were big and handsome. You are.\"  They were brother and sister, these Martians. Snap introduced them as _Set_ Miko and _Setta_ Moa--the Martian equivalent of Mr. and Miss.  This Miko was, from our Earth standards, a tremendous, brawny giant. Not spindly, like most Martians, this fellow, for all his seven feet in height was almost heavy set. He wore a plaited leather jerkin beneath his robe and knee pants of leather out of which his lower legs showed as gray, hairy pillars of strength. He had come into the salon with a swagger, his sword ornament clanking.  \"A pleasant voyage so far,\" he said to me as he started his meal. His voice had the heavy, throaty rasp characteristic of the Martian. He spoke perfect English--both Martians and Venus people are by heritage extraordinary linguists. Miko and his sister Moa, had a touch of Martian accent, worn almost away by living for some years in Greater New York.  The shock to me came within a few minutes. Miko, absorbed in attacking his meal, inadvertently pushed back his robe to bare his forearm. An instant only, then it dropped to his wrist. But in that instant I had seen, upon the gray flesh, a thin sear turned red. A very recent burn--as though a pencil ray of heat had caught his arm.  My mind flung back. Only last night in the city corridor, Snap and I had been followed by a Martian. I had shot at him with a heat ray: I thought I had hit him on the arm. Was this the mysterious Martian who had followed us from Halsey's office?     V   Shortly after that midday meal I encountered Venza sitting on the starlit deck. I had been in the bow observatory; taken my routine castings of our position and worked them out. I was, I think, of the _Planetara's_ officers the most expert handler of the mathematical calculators. The locating of our position and charting the trajectory of our course was, under ordinary circumstances, about all I had to do. And it took only a few minutes every twelve hours.  I had a moment with Carter in the isolation of his chart room.  \"This voyage! Gregg, I'm getting like you--too fanciful. We've a normal group of passengers apparently, but I don't like the look of any of them. That Ob Hahn, at your table--\"  \"Snaky looking fellow,\" I commented. \"He and the Englishman are great on arguments. Did you have Princes' cabin searched?\"  My breath hung on his answer.  \"Yes. Nothing unusual among his things. We searched both his room and his sister's.\"  I did not follow that up. Instead I told him about the burn on Miko's thick arm.  He stared. \"I wish we were at Ferrok-Shahn. Gregg, tonight when the passengers are asleep, come here to me. Snap will be here, and Dr. Frank. We can trust him.\"  \"He knows about--about the Grantline treasure?\"  \"Yes. And so do Balch and Blackstone.\" Balch and Blackstone were our first and second officers.  \"We'll all meet here, Gregg--say about the zero hour. We must take some precautions.\"  Then he dismissed me.  I found Venza seated alone in a starlit corner of the secluded deck. A porthole, with the black heavens and the blazing stars was before her. There was an empty seat nearby.  She greeted me with the Venus form of jocular, intimate greeting:  \"Hola-lo, Gregg! Sit here with me. I have been wondering when you would come after me.\"  I sat down beside her. \"Why are you going to Mars, Venza? I'm glad to see you.\"  \"Many thanks. But I am glad to see you, Gregg. So handsome a man. Do you know, from Venus to Earth, and I have no doubt on all of Mars, no man will please me more.\"  \"Glib tongue,\" I laughed. \"Born to flatter the male--every girl of your world.\" And I added seriously, \"You don't answer my question. What takes you to Mars?\"  \"Contract. By the stars, what else? Of"]]]
