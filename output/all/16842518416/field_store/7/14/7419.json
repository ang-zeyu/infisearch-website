The king had noticed the cheerless aspect of the heavens as he approached the window immediately after rising. But as all the necessary directions had been given respecting the promenade, and every preparation had been made accordingly, and as, which was far more imperious than everything else, Louis relied upon this promenade to satisfy the cravings of his imagination, and we will even already say, the clamorous desires of his heart--the king unhesitatingly decided that the appearance of the heavens had nothing whatever to do with the matter; that the promenade was arranged, and that, whatever the state of the weather might be, the promenade should take place. Besides there are certain terrestrial sovereigns who seem to have accorded them privileged existences, and there are certain times when it might almost be supposed that the expressed wish of an earthly monarch has its influence over the Divine will. It was Virgil who observed of Augustus: _Nocte placet tota redeunt spectacula man√®_. Louis attended mass as usual, but it was evident that his attention was somewhat distracted from the presence of the Creator by the remembrance of the creature. His mind was occupied during the service in reckoning more than once the number of minutes, then of seconds, which separated him from the blissful moment when the promenade would begin, that is to say, the moment when Madame would set out with her maids of honor.  Besides, as a matter of course, everybody at the chateau was ignorant of the interview which had taken place between La Valliere and the king. Montalais, perhaps, with her usual chattering propensity, might have been disposed to talk about it; but Montalais on this occasion was held in check by Malicorne, who had placed upon her lips the padlock of mutual interest. As for Louis XIV., his happiness was so extreme that he had forgiven Madame, or nearly so, her little piece of ill-nature of the previous evening. In fact, he had occasion to congratulate himself about it rather than to complain of it. Had it not been for her ill-natured action, he would not have received the letter from La Valliere; had it not been for the letter, he would have had no interview; and had it not been for the interview he would have remained undecided. His heart was filled with too much happiness for any ill-feeling to remain in it, at that moment at least. Instead, therefore, of knitting his brows into a frown when he perceived his sister-in-law, Louis resolved to receive her in a more friendly and gracious manner than usual. But on one condition only, that she would be ready to set out early. Such was the nature of Louis's thoughts during mass, and which made him, during the ceremony, forget matters, which, in his character of Most Christian King and of the oldest son of the Church, ought to have occupied his attention. He returned to the chateau, and as the promenade was fixed for mid-day only, and it was at present just ten o'clock, he set to work most desperately with Colbert and Lyonne. But even while he worked, Louis went from the table to the window, inasmuch as the window looked out upon Madame's pavilion; he could see M. Fouquet in the courtyard, to whom the courtiers, since the favor shown toward him on the previous evening, paid greater attention than ever. The king, instinctively, on noticing Fouquet, turned toward Colbert, who was smiling, and seemed full of benevolence and delight, a state of feeling which had arisen from the very moment one of his secretaries had entered and handed him a pocket-book, which he had put unopened into his pocket. But, as there was always something sinister at the bottom of any delight expressed by Colbert, Louis preferred of the smiles of the two men that of Fouquet. He beckoned to the surintendant to come up, and then, turning toward Lyonne and Colbert, he said: \"Finish this matter, place it on my desk, and I will read it at my leisure.\" And he left the room. At the sign the king had made to him, Fouquet had hastened up the staircase, while Aramis, who was with the surintendant, quietly retired among the group of courtiers, and disappeared without having been even observed by the king. The king and Fouquet met at the top of the staircase.  \"Sire,\" said Fouquet, remarking the gracious manner in which Louis was about to receive him, \"your majesty has overwhelmed me with kindness during the last few days. It is not a youthful monarch, but a being of a higher order, who reigns over France--one whom pleasure, happiness, and love acknowledge as their master.\" The king colored. The compliment, although flattering, was not the less somewhat direct. Louis conducted Fouquet to a small room which separated his study from his sleeping apartment.  \"Do you know why I summoned you?\" said the king, as he seated himself upon the edge of the window, so as not to lose anything that might be passing in the gardens which fronted the opposite entrance to Madame's pavilion.  \"No, sire,\" replied Fouquet; \"but I am sure for something agreeable, if I am to judge from your majesty's gracious smile.\"  \"You are mistaken, then.\"  \"I, sire?\"  \"For I summoned you, on the contrary, to pick a quarrel with you.\"  \"With me, sire?\"  \"Yes, and that a serious one.\"  \"Your majesty alarms me; and yet I wait most confident in your justice and goodness.\"  \"Do you know I am told, Monsieur Fouquet, that you are preparing a grand _fete_ at Vaux.\"  Fouquet smiled, as a sick man would do at the first shiver of a fever which has left him but returns again.  \"And that you have not invited me!\" continued the king.  \"Sire,\" replied Fouquet, \"I have not even thought of the _fete_ you speak of, and it was only yesterday evening that one of my _friends_\" (Fouquet laid a stress upon the word) \"was kind enough to make me think of it.\"  \"Yet I saw you yesterday evening, Monsieur Fouquet, and you said nothing to me about it.\"  \"How dared I hope that your majesty would so greatly descend from your own exalted station as to honor my dwelling with your royal presence?\"  \"Excuse me, Monsieur Fouquet, you did not speak to me about your _fete_.\"  \"I did not allude to the _fete_ to your majesty, I repeat, in the first place, because nothing had been decided with regard to it, and, secondly, because I feared a refusal.\"  \"And something made you fear a refusal, Monsieur Fouquet? You see I am determined to push you hard.\"  \"The profound wish I had that your majesty should accept my invitation--\"  \"Well, Monsieur Fouquet, nothing is easier, I perceive, than our coming to an understanding. Your wish is to invite me to your _fete_--my own is to be present at it; invite me, and I will go.\"  \"Is it possible that your majesty will deign to accept?\" murmured the surintendant.  \"Why, really, monsieur,\" said the king, laughing, \"I think I do more than accept--I think I invite myself.\"  \"Your majesty overwhelms me with honor and delight!\" exclaimed Fouquet; \"but I shall be obliged to repeat what M. de Vieuville said to your ancestor Henry the Fourth, '_Domine non sum dignus_.'\"  \"To which I reply, Monsieur Fouquet, that if you give a _fete_, I will go whether I am invited or not.\"  \"I thank your majesty deeply,\" said Fouquet, as he raised his head beneath this favor, which he was convinced would be his ruin.  \"But how could your majesty have been informed of it?\"  \"By public rumor, Monsieur Fouquet, which says such wonderful things of yourself and of the marvels of your house. Would you become proud, Monsieur Fouquet, if the king were to be jealous of you?\"  \"I should be the happiest man in the world, sire, since the very day on which your majesty were to be jealous of Vaux, I should possess something worthy of being offered to you.\"  \"Very well, Monsieur Fouquet, prepare your _fete_, and open the doors of your house as wide as possible.\"   [Illustration: AS THE RAIN DRIPPED MORE AND MORE THROUGH THE FOLIAGE OF THE OAK, THE KING HELD HIS HAT OVER THE HEAD OF THE YOUNG GIRL.--_Page 22._]   \"It is for your majesty to fix the day.\"  \"This day month, then.\"  \"Has your majesty any further commands?\"  \"Nothing, Monsieur Fouquet, except from the present moment until then to have you near me as much as possible.\"  \"I have the honor to form one of your majesty's party for the promenade.\"  \"Very good. I am now going out indeed, for there are the ladies, I see, who are going to start.\"  With this remark, the king, with all the eagerness, not only of a young man, but of a young man in love, withdrew from the window, in order to take his gloves and cane, which his valet held ready for him. The neighing of the horses and the rumbling of the wheels on the gravel of the courtyard could be distinctly heard. The king descended the stairs, and at the moment he made his appearance upon the flight of steps every one stopped. The king walked straight up to the young queen. The queen-mother, who was still suffering more than ever from the illness with which she was afflicted, did not wish to go out. Maria Theresa accompanied Madame in her carriage, and asked the king in what direction he wished the promenade to take place. The king, who had just seen La Valliere, still pale from the events of the previous evening, get into a carriage with three of her companions, told the queen that he had no preference, and wherever she would wish to go, there would he be with her. The queen then desired that the out-riders should proceed in the direction of Apremont. The out-riders set off, accordingly, before the others. The king rode on horseback, and for a few minutes accompanied the carriage of the queen and Madame, with his hand resting upon the door. The weather had cleared up a little, but a kind of veil of dust, like a thick gauze, was still spread over the surface of the heavens, and the sun made every glittering atom of dust glisten again within the circuit of its rays. The heat was stifling; but as the king did not seem to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18997"],["title","The Vicomte de Bragelonne; Or, Ten Years Later (#6)"],["body","any attention to the appearance of the heavens, no one made himself uneasy about it, and the promenade, in obedience to the orders which had been given by the queen, took its course in the direction of Apremont. The courtiers who followed were merry and full of spirits; it was evident that every one tried to forget, and to make others forget, the bitter discussions of the previous evening. Madame, particularly, was delightful; in fact, seeing the king at the door of her carriage, as she did not suppose he would be there for the queen's sake, she hoped that her prince had returned to her. Hardly, however, had they proceeded a quarter of a mile on the road, when the king, with a gracious smile, saluted them and drew up his horse, leaving the queen's carriage to pass on, then that of the principal ladies of honor, and then all the others in succession, who, seeing the king stop, wished in their turn to stop too; but the king made a sign to them to continue their progress. When La Valliere's carriage passed, the king approached it, saluted the ladies who were inside, and was preparing to accompany the carriage containing the maids of honor, in the same way he had followed that in which Madame was, when suddenly the whole file of carriages stopped. It was probable that Madame, uneasy at the king having left her, had just given directions for the performance of this maneuver, the direction in which the promenade was to take place having been left to her. The king having sent to inquire what her object was in stopping the carriages, was informed in reply that she wished to walk. She very likely hoped that the king, who was following the carriages of the maids of honor on horseback, would not venture to follow the maids of honor themselves on foot. They had arrived in the middle of the forest. The promenade, in fact, was not ill-timed, especially for those who were dreamers or lovers. From the little open space where the halt had taken place, three beautiful long walks, shady and undulating, stretched out before them. These walks were covered with moss, with leaves lying scattered idly about; and each walk had its horizon in the distance, consisting of about a handbreadth of sky, apparent through the interlacing of the branches of the trees. At the end of the walks, evidently in great tribulation and uneasiness, the startled deer were seen hurrying to and fro, first stopping for a moment in the middle of the path, and then raising their heads, they fled with the speed of an arrow, or bounded into the depths of the forest, where they disappeared from view; now and then a rabbit of philosophical mien could be noticed quietly sitting upright, rubbing his muzzle with his fore-paws, and looking about inquiringly, as though wondering whether all these people, who were approaching in his direction, and who had just disturbed him in his meditations and his meal, were not followed by their dogs, or had not their guns under their arms. All alighted from their carriages as soon as they observed that the queen was doing so. Maria Theresa took the arm of one of her ladies of honor, and, with a side-glance toward the king, who did not perceive that he was in the slightest degree the object of the queen's attention, entered the forest by the first path before her. Two of the out-riders preceded her majesty with long poles, which they used for the purpose of putting the branches of the trees aside, or removing the bushes which might impede her progress. As soon as Madame alighted, she found the Comte de Guiche at her side, who bowed and placed himself at her disposal. Monsieur, delighted with his bath of the two previous days, had announced his preference for the river, and, having given De Guiche leave of absence, remained at the chateau with the Chevalier de Lorraine and Manicamp. He was not in the slightest degree jealous. He had been looked for to no purpose among those present; but as Monsieur was a man who thought a great deal of himself, and usually added very little to the general pleasure, his absence had rather been a subject of satisfaction than of regret. Every one had followed the example which the queen and Madame had set, doing just as they pleased, according as chance or fancy influenced them. The king, we have already observed, remained near Valliere, and, throwing himself off his horse at the moment the door of her carriage was opened, he offered her his hand to alight. Montalais and Tonnay-Charente immediately drew back and kept at a distance; the former from calculated, the latter from prudent, motives. There was this difference, however, between the two, that the one had withdrawn from a wish to please the king, the other for a very opposite reason. During the last half hour the weather also had undergone a change; the veil which had been spread over the sky, as if driven by a blast of heated air, had become massed together in the western part of the heavens; and afterward as if driven back by a current of air from the opposite direction, was now advancing slowly and heavily toward them. The approach of the storm could be felt, but as the king did not perceive it, no one thought it was right to do so. The promenade was therefore continued; some of the company, with minds ill at ease on the subject, raised their eyes from time to time toward the sky; others, even more timid still, walked about without wandering too far from the carriages, where they relied upon taking shelter in case the storm burst. The greater number of these, however, observing that the king fearlessly entered the wood with La Valliere, followed his majesty. The king, noticing this, took La Valliere's hand, and led her away by a side-path, where no one this time ventured to follow him.     CHAPTER IV.  THE SHOWER OF RAIN.   At this moment, and in the same direction, too, that the king and La Valliere were proceeding, except that they were walking in the wood itself instead of following the path, two men were walking together, utterly indifferent to the appearance of the heavens. Their heads were bent down in the manner of people occupied with matters of great moment. They had not observed either De Guiche or Madame, or the king or La Valliere. Suddenly something passed through the air like a stream of fire, followed by a loud but distant rumbling noise.  \"Ah!\" said one of them, raising his head, \"here is the storm. Let us reach our carriages, my dear D'Herblay.\"  Aramis looked inquiringly at the heavens. \"There is no occasion to hurry yet,\" he said; and then, resuming the conversation where it had doubtlessly been interrupted, he said, \"You were observing that the letter we wrote last evening must by this time have reached its destination?\"  \"I was saying that she certainly has it.\"  \"Whom did you send it by?\"  \"By my own servant, as I have already told you.\"  \"Did he bring back an answer?\"  \"I have not seen him since; the young girl was probably in attendance on Madame, or was in her own room dressing, and he may have had to wait. Our time for leaving arrived, and we set off, of course: I cannot, therefore, know what is going on yonder.\"  \"Did you see the king before leaving?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"How did he seem?\"  \"Nothing could be better, or worse; according as he be sincere or hypocritical.\"  \"And the _fete_?\"  \"Will take place in a month.\"  \"He invited himself, you say?\"  \"With a pertinacity in which I detected Colbert's influence. But has not last night removed your illusions?\"  \"What illusions?\"  \"With respect to the assistance you may be able to give me in this circumstance.\"  \"No; I have passed the night writing, and all my orders are given.\"  \"Do not conceal it from yourself, D'Herblay, but the _fete_ will cost some millions.\"  \"I will give six, do you on your side get two or three.\"  \"You are a wonderful man, my dear D'Herblay.\"  Aramis smiled.  \"But,\" inquired Fouquet, with some remaining uneasiness, \"how is it that, while now you are squandering millions in this manner, a few days ago you did not pay the fifty thousand francs to Baisemeaux out of your own pocket?\"  \"Because a few days ago I was as poor as Job.\"  \"And to-day?\"  \"To-day I am wealthier than the king himself.\"  \"Very well,\" said Fouquet; \"I understand men pretty well; I know you are incapable of forfeiting your word; I do not wish to wrest your secret from you, and so let us talk no more about it.\"  At this moment a dull, heavy rumbling was heard, which suddenly burst forth in a violent clap of thunder.  \"Oh, oh!\" said Fouquet, \"I was quite right in what I said.\"  \"Come,\" said Aramis, \"let us rejoin the carriages.\"  \"We shall not have time,\" said Fouquet, \"for here comes the rain.\"  In fact, as he spoke, and as if the heavens were opened, a shower of large drops of rain was suddenly heard falling on the trees about them.  \"We shall have time,\" said Aramis, \"to reach the carriages before the foliage becomes saturated.\"  \"It will be better,\" said Fouquet, \"to take shelter somewhere--in a grotto, for instance.\"  \"Yes, but where are we to find a grotto?\" inquired Aramis.  \"I know one,\" said Fouquet, smiling, \"not ten paces from here.\" Then looking round about him, he added: \"Yes, we are quite right.\"  \"You are very fortunate to have so good a memory said Aramis,\" smiling in his turn; \"but are you not afraid that your coachman, finding we do not return, will suppose we have taken another road back, and that he will not follow the carriages belonging to the court?\"  \"Oh, there is no fear of that,\" said Fouquet; \"whenever I place my coachman and my carriage in any particular spot, nothing but an express order from the king could stir them; and more than that, too, it seems that we are not the only ones who have come so far, for I hear footsteps and the sound of voices.\"  As he spoke, Fouquet, turning round, opened with his cane a mass of foliage which hid the path from his view. Aramis' glance as well as his own plunged at the same moment through the opening he had made.  \"A woman,\""]]]
