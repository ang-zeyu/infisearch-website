But Grosvenor was firm. He had given the invitation first, he said, and nobody could take the privilege from him. So the others yielded gracefully, and in high good humor the eight, saying much and humming little songs, walked across the fields from the camp and into the town. Robert noticed the bustling life of Albany with approval. The forest made its appeal to him, and the city made another and different but quite as strong appeal. The old Fort Orange of the Dutch was crowded now, not only with troops but with all the forms of industry that follow in the train of an army. The thrifty Dutch, despite their apprehension over the coming of the French, were busy buying, selling, and between battles much money was made.  The George Inn, a low building but long and substantial was down by the river. The great doors stood wide open and much life flowed in and out, showing that it too profited by war. The eight found seats at a table on a sanded floor, and contented themselves with lemonade, which they drank slowly, while they talked and looked.  It was a motley and strange throng; American, English, Dutch, German, Indian, Swedish. A half dozen languages were heard in the great room, forerunner of the many elements that were to enter in the composition of the American nation. And the crowd was already cosmopolitan. Difference of race attracted no attention. Men took no notice of Tayoga because he was an Indian, unless to admire his tall, straight figure and proud carriage. Albany had known the Iroquois a century and a half.  Robert's spirits, like Grovenor's, mounted. Here he was with many friends of his own age and kindred mind. Everything took on the color of rose. All of them were talking, but his own gift of speech was the finest. He clothed narrative with metaphor and illustration until it became so vivid that the others were glad to fall silent and listen to him, though Robert himself was unconscious of the fact. They made him relate once more his story of the battle as he saw it from inside the French lines at Ticonderoga, and, just as he came to the end of the tale, he caught a glimpse of a tall man entering the tavern.  \"Tell us what you saw from the other side,\" he said to Grosvenor, and they compelled the reluctant Englishman to talk. Then Robert turned his eyes toward the tall man who was now sitting at a small table in the corner and drinking from a long glass. Something familiar in his walk had caught his attention as he came in, and, under cover of Grosvenor's talk, he wished to observe him again without being noticed even by his own comrades.  The stranger was sitting with the side of his face to Robert, and his features were not well disclosed. His dress was that of a seafaring man, rough but rather good in texture, and a belt held a long dirk in a scabbard which was usual at that time. The hand that raised the long glass to his lips was large, red and powerful. Robert felt that his first belief was correct. He had seen him before somewhere, though he could not yet recall where, but when he turned his head presently he knew. They had met under such circumstances that neither was ever likely to forget time or place.  He was amazed that the stranger had come so boldly into Albany, but second thought told him that there was no proof against him, it was merely Robert's word against his. Among people absorbed in a great war his own story would seem wildly improbable and the stranger's would have all the savor of truth. But he knew that he could not be mistaken. He saw now the spare face, clean shaven, and the hard eyes, set close together, that he remembered so well.  Robert did not know what to do. He listened for a little while to Grosvenor's narrative but his attention wandered back to the seafaring man. Then he decided.  \"Will you fellows talk on and excuse me for a few minutes?\" he said.  \"What is it, Lennox?\" asked Colden.  \"I see an acquaintance on the other side of the room. I wish to speak to him.\"  \"That being the case, we'll let you go, but we'll miss you. Hurry back.\"  \"I'll stay only a few minutes. It's an old friend and I must have a little talk with him.\"  He walked with light steps across the room which was crowded, humming with many voices, the air heavy with smoke. The man was still at the small table, and, opposite him, was an empty chair in which Robert sat deliberately, putting his elbows on the table, and staring into the hard blue eyes.  \"I'm Peter Smith,\" he said. \"You remember me?\"  There was a flicker of surprise in the Captain's face, but nothing more.  \"Oh, yes, Peter,\" he said. \"I know you, but I was not looking for you just at this moment.\"  \"But I'm here.\"  \"Perhaps you're coming back to your duty, is that it? Well, I'm glad. I've another ship now, and though you're a runaway seaman I can afford to let bygones be bygones.\"  \"I hope your vessel has changed her trade. I don't think I'd care to sail again on a slaver.\"  \"Always a particular sort of chap you were, Peter. It's asking a lot for me to change the business of my ship to suit you.\"  \"But not too much.\"  The conversation was carried on in an ordinary tone. Neither raised his voice a particle. Nobody took any notice. His own comrades, engrossed in lively talk, seemed to have forgotten Robert for the moment, and he felt that he was master of the situation. Certainly the slaver would be more uncomfortable than he.  \"I was wondering,\" he said, \"how long you mean to stay in Albany.\"  \"It's a pleasant town,\" said the man, \"as I have cause to know since I've been here before. I may remain quite a while. Still, I shall decide wholly according to my taste.\"  \"But there is a certain element of danger.\"  \"Oh, the war! I don't think the French even if they come to Albany will have a chance to take me.\"  \"I didn't have the war in mind. There are other risks of which I think that I, Peter Smith, who sailed with you once before ought to warn you.\"  \"It's good of you, Peter, to think so much of my safety, but I don't believe I've any cause for fear. I've always been able to take care of myself.\"  The last words were said with a little snap, and Robert knew they were meant as a defiance, but he appeared not to notice.  \"Ah, well you've shown that you know how to look out for number one,\" he said. \"I'm only Peter Smith, a humble seaman, but I've the same faculty. I bid you good-day.\"  \"Good-day, Peter. I hope there's no ill feeling between us, and that each will have whatever he deserves!\"  Cool! wonderfully cool, Robert thought, but he replied merely: \"I trust so, too, and in that case it is easy to surmise what one of us would get.\"  He sauntered back to his comrades, and, lest he attract their attention, he did not look toward the slaver again for a minute or two. When he glanced in that direction he saw the man walking toward the door, not in any hurried manner, but as if he had all the time in the world, and need fear nobody. Cool! wonderfully cool, Robert thought a second time.  The slaver went out, and Robert thought he caught a glimpse of a man meeting him, a second man in whose figure also there was something familiar. They were gone in an instant, and he was tempted to spring up and follow them, because the figure of which he had seen but a little at the door reminded him nevertheless of Achille Garay, the spy.     CHAPTER II  THE CHEST OF DRAWERS   It was but a fleeting glimpse that Robert had of the second man, but he believed that it was Garay. He not only looked like the spy, but he was convinced that it was really he. After the first moment or two he did not doubt his identity, and making an excuse that he wanted a little fresh air and would return in an instant he walked quickly to the door. He caught another and fugitive glimpse of two men, one tall and the other short, walking away together, and he could not doubt that they were the slaver and the spy.  Had he been alone Robert would have followed them, though he was quite certain that Garay must have had some place of sure refuge, else he would not have ventured into Albany. Even with that recourse his act was uncommonly bold. If the slaver was daring, the spy was yet more so. There was nothing against the slaver that they could prove, but the spy put his neck in the noose.  Robert whistled softly to himself, and he was very thoughtful. Willet, Tayoga and he had been so completely victorious over Garay in the forest that perhaps he had underrated him. Maybe he was a man to be feared. His daring appearance in Albany must be fortified by supreme cunning, and his alliance with the slaver implied a plan. Robert believed that the plan, or a part of it at least, was directed against himself. Well, what if it was? He could meet it, and he was not afraid. He had overcome other perils, and he had friends, as true and steadfast as were ever held to any man by hooks of steel. His heart beat high, he was in a glow, his whole soul leaped forward to meet prospective danger.  He went back into the inn and took his seat with the others. Now it was Stuart who was talking, telling them of life in the great Southern colony and of its delights, of the big houses, of the fields of tobacco, of the horse races, of the long visits to neighbors, and how all who were anybody were related, making Virginia one huge family.  \"Now Cabell and I,\" he said, \"belong to the same clan. My mother and his father are third cousins, which makes us fourth cousins, or fifth is it? But whether fourth or fifth, we're cousins just the same. All the people of our blood are supposed to stand together, and do stand together. Oh, it has its delights! It makes us sufficient unto ourselves! The old Dominion is a world in itself,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18774"],["title","The Sun of Quebec: A Story of a Great Crisis (#4)"],["body","in all its parts.\"  \"But you have to come to Philadelphia to see a great city and get a taste of metropolitan life,\" said Colden.  Then a discussion, friendly but warm arose as to the respective merits of the Virginia and Pennsylvania provinces, and when it was at its height and the attention of all the others was absorbed in it, Tayoga leaned over and whispered to Robert:  \"What did you see at the door, Dagaeoga?\"  Robert was startled. So, the Onondago was watching, after all. He might have known that nothing would escape his attention.  \"I saw Garay, the spy,\" he replied in the same tone.  \"And the man at the little table was the captain of the slave ship on which you were taken?\"  \"The same.\"  \"It bodes ill, Dagaeoga. You must watch.\"  \"I will, Tayoga.\"  The crowd in the great room of the George Inn increased and the young group remained, eager to watch it. It was a reflex of the life in the colonies, at the seat of conflict, and throbbing with all the emotions of a great war that enveloped nearly the whole civilized world. A burly fellow, dressed as a teamster, finally made his voice heard above the others.  \"I tell you men,\" he said, \"that we must give up Albany! Our army has been cut to pieces! Montcalm is advancing with twenty thousand French regulars, and swarms of Indians! They control all of Lake George as well as Champlain! Hundreds of settlers have already fallen before the tomahawk, and houses are burning along the whole border! I have it from them that have seen the fires.\"  There was a sudden hush in the crowd, followed by an alarmed murmur. The man's emphasis and his startling statements made an impression.  \"Go on, Dobbs! Tell us about it!\" said one.  \"What do you know?\" asked another.  He stood up, a great tall man with a red face.  \"My cousin has been in the north,\" he said, \"and he's seen rangers, some that have just escaped from the Indians, barely saving their hair. He heard from them that the King of France has sent a big army to Canada, and that another just as big is on the way. It won't be a week before you see the French flag from the hills of Albany, and wise men are already packing ready to go to New York.\"  There was another alarmed hush.  \"This fellow must be stopped,\" said Colden. \"He'll start a panic.\"  \"Dagaeoga has the gift of words,\" whispered a voice in Robert's ear, \"and now is the time to use it.\"  Nothing more was needed. Robert was on fire in an instant, and, standing upon his chair, asked for attention.  \"Your pardon a moment, Mr. Dobbs,\" he said, \"if I interrupt you.\"  \"Why it's only a boy!\" a man exclaimed.  \"A boy, it's true,\" said Robert, who now felt himself the center of all eyes, and who, as usual, responded with all his faculties to such an opportunity, \"but I was present at the Battle of Ticonderoga, and perhaps I've a chance to correct a few errors into which our friend, Mr. Dobbs, has fallen.\"  \"What are those errors?\" asked the man in a surly tone, not relishing his loss of the stage.  \"I'll come to them promptly,\" said Robert in his mellowest tones. \"They're just trifles, Mr. Dobbs, but still trifles should be corrected. I stood with the French army in the battle, and I know something about its numbers, which are about one-sixth of what Mr. Dobbs claims them to be.\"  \"What were you doing with the French?\"  \"I happened to be a prisoner, Mr. Dobbs. I escaped a day or two later. But here are with me young officers of ours who were in the attack. Several of them felt the sting of French bullets on that day, so when they tell you what happened they know what they're talking about. Their reports don't come from their cousins, but are the product of their own eyes and ears. Peace, Mr. Dobbs! I've the floor, or rather the chair, and I must tell the facts. We were defeated at Ticonderoga, it's true, but we were not cut to pieces. Our generals failed to bring up our artillery. They underrated the French. They went with rifles, muskets and bayonets alone against breastworks, defended by a valiant foe, for the French are valiant, and they paid the price. But our army is in existence and it's as brave as ever. Albany is in no danger. Don't be alarmed.\"  \"You're but a boy. You don't know,\" growled Dobbs.  \"Peace, Mr. Dobbs! Give us peace. A boy who has seen may know better than a man who has not seen. I tell you once again, friends, that the Marquis de Montcalm will not appear before Albany. It's a long way from Ticonderoga to this city, too long a road for the French army to travel. Wise men are not packing for flight to New York. Wise men are staying right here.\"  \"Hear! Hear!\" exclaimed the Virginians and Philadelphians and Grosvenor, and \"Hear! Hear!\" was repeated from the crowd. Dobbs' red face grew redder, but now he was silent.  \"My friends,\" continued Robert in his golden persuasive tones, \"you're not afraid, you're all brave men, but you must guard against panic. Experience tells you that rumor is irresponsible, that, as it spreads, it grows. We're going to learn from our defeat. The French are as near to Albany as they'll ever come. The war is not going to move southward. Its progress instead will be toward Quebec. Remember that panic is always a bad counselor; but that courage is ever a good one. Things are never as bad as they look.\"  \"Hear! Hear!\" exclaimed his young comrades again, and the echoes from the crowd were more numerous than before. The teamster began to draw back and presently slipped out of the door. Then Robert sat down amid great applause, blushing somewhat because he had been carried away by his feelings and apologizing to the others for making himself conspicuous.  \"Nothing to apologize for,\" exclaimed Cabell. \"'Twas well done, a good speech at the right time. You've the gift of oratory, Lennox. You should come to Virginia to live, after we've defeated the French. Our province is devoted to oratory. You've the gift of golden speech, and the people will follow you.\"  \"I'm afraid I've made an enemy of that man, Dobbs,\" said Robert, \"and I had enemies enough already.\"  His mind went back to the slaver and Garay, and he was troubled.  \"We've had our little triumph here, thanks to Lennox,\" said Colden, \"and it seems to me now that we've about exhausted the possibilities of the George. Besides, the air is getting thick. Let's go outside.\"  Grosvenor paid the score and they departed, a cheer following them. Here were young officers who had fought well, and the men in the George were willing to show respect.  \"I think I'd better return to camp now,\" said Grosvenor.  \"We'll go with you,\" said Colden, speaking for the Pennsylvanians.  \"Stuart and I are detached for the present,\" said Cabell. \"We secured a transfer from our command in Virginia, and we're hoping for commissions in the Royal Americans, and more active service, since the whole tide of war seems to have shifted to the north rather than the west.\"  \"The Royal Americans are fine men,\" said Robert. \"Though raised in the colonies, they rank with the British regulars. I had a good friend in one of the regiments, Edward Charteris, of New York, but he was taken at Ticonderoga. I saw the French bring him in a prisoner. I suppose they're holding him in Quebec now.\"  \"Then we'll rescue him when we take Quebec,\" said Stuart valiantly.  The friends separated with promises to meet again soon and to see much of one another while they were in Albany, Grosvenor and the Pennsylvanians continuing to the camp, Cabell and Stuart turning back to the George for quarters, and Robert and Tayoga going toward the house of Mynheer Jacobus Huysman. But before they reached it young Lennox suggested that they turn toward the river.  \"It is well to do so,\" said the Onondaga. \"I think that Dagaeoga wishes to look there for a ship.\"  \"That's in my mind, Tayoga, and yet I wouldn't know the vessel I'm looking for if I saw her.\"  \"She will be commanded by the man whom we saw in the inn, the one with whom Dagaeoga talked.\"  \"I've no doubt of it, Tayoga. Nothing escapes your notice.\"  \"What are eyes for if not to see! And it is a time for all to watch; especially, it is a time for Dagaeoga to watch with his eyes, his ears and all his senses.\"  \"I've that feeling myself.\"  \"Something is plotting against you. The slaver did not meet the spy for nothing.\"  \"Why should men bother about one as insignificant as I am, when the world is plunged into a great war?\"  \"It is because Dagaeoga is in the way of somebody. He is very much in the way or so much trouble and risk would not be taken to remove him.\"  \"I wonder what it is Tayoga. I know that Mr. Hardy and Mr. Huysman and doubtless others hold the key to this lock, but I feel quite sure they are not going to put it in my hand just at present.\"  \"No, they will not, but it must be for very good reasons. No one ever had better friends than Dagaeoga has in them. If they do not choose to tell him anything it will be wise for him not to ask questions.\"  \"That's just the way I feel about it, and so I'm going to ask no questions.\"  A hulking figure barred their way, a red face glowed at them, and a rough voice demanded satisfaction.  \"You fellow with the slick tongue, you had 'em laughing at me in the tavern,\" said Dobbs, the teamster. \"You just the same as told 'em I was a liar when I said the French were coming.\"  The man was full of unreasoning anger, and he handled the butt end of a heavy whip. Yet Robert felt quite cool. His pistol was in his belt, and Tayoga was at his elbow.  \"You are mistaken, my good Mr. Dobbs,\" he said gaily. \"I would never tell a man he was a liar, particularly one to whom I had not been introduced. I try to be choice in my language. I was trained to be so by Mr. Alexander McLean, a most competent schoolmaster of this city, and I merely tried to disseminate a thought in the minds of the numerous audience gathered in the George Inn. My thought was unlike your thought, and so I was compelled to use words that did not resemble the words used by you. I was not"]]]
