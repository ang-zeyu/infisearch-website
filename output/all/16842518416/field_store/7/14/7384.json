Great Lord, do you actually mean that you're using this stuff as an excuse for depriving men of their jobs?\"  \"I warned you that you should have brought a professional psychologist along,\" Melroy reminded him. \"And maybe you ought to get Koffler and Burris to repeat their complaints on a lie-detector, while you're at it. They took the same tests, in the same manner, as any of the others. They just didn't have the mental equipment to cope with them and the others did. And for that reason, I won't run the risk of having them working on this job.\"  \"That's just your word against theirs,\" Crandall insisted obstinately. \"Their complaint is that you framed this whole thing up to get rid of them.\"  \"Why, I didn't even know who either of them were, until yesterday morning.\"  \"That's not the way they tell it,\" Crandall retorted. \"They say you and Keating have been out to get them ever since they were hired. You and your supervisors have been persecuting both of those men systematically. The fact that Burris has had grounds for all these previous complaints proves that.\"  \"It proves that Burris has a persecution complex, and that Koffler's credulous enough to believe him,\" Melroy replied. \"And that tends to confirm the results of the tests they failed to pass.\"  \"Oh, so that's the line you're taking. You persecute a man, and then say he has a persecution complex if he recognizes the fact. Well, you're not going to get away with it, that's all I have to say to you.\" Crandall flung the test-sheet he had been holding on to the desk. \"That stuff's not worth the paper it's scribbled on!\" He turned on his heel in an automatically correct about-face and strode out of the office.         *       *       *       *       *  Melroy straightened out the papers and put them away, then sat down at his desk, filling and lighting his pipe. He was still working at 1215 when Ben Puryear called him.  \"They walked out on us,\" he reported. \"Harry Crandall was out here talking to them, and at noon the whole gang handed in their wrist-Geigers and dosimeters and cleared out their lockers. They say they aren't coming back till Burris and Koffler come back to work with them.\"  \"Then they aren't coming back, period,\" Melroy replied. \"Crandall was to see me, a couple of hours ago. He tells me that Burris and Koffler told him that we've been persecuting Burris; discriminating against him. You know of anything that really happened that might make them think anything like that?\"  \"No. Burris is always yelling about not getting enough overtime work, but you know how it is: he's just a roustabout, a common laborer. Any overtime work that has to be done is usually skilled labor on this job. We generally have a few roustabouts to help out, but he's been allowed to make overtime as much as any of the others.\"  \"Will the time-records show that?\"  \"They ought to. I don't know what he and Koffler told Crandall, but whatever it was, I'll bet they were lying.\"  \"That's all right, then. How's the reactor, now?\"  \"Hausinger says the count's down to safe limits, and the temperature's down to inactive normal. He and his gang found a big chunk of plutonium, about one-quarter CM, inside. He got it out.\"  \"All right. Tell Dr. Rives to gather up all her completed or partially completed test records and come out to the office. You and the others stay on the job; we may have some men for you by this afternoon; tomorrow morning certainly.\"  He hung up, then picked up the communicator phone and called his secretary.  \"Joan, is Sid Keating out there? Send him in, will you?\"  Keating, when he entered, was wearing the lugubriously gratified expression appropriate to the successful prophet of disaster.  \"All right, Cassandra,\" Melroy greeted him. \"I'm not going to say you didn't warn me. Look. This strike is illegal. It's a violation of the Federal Labor Act of 1958, being called without due notice of intention, without preliminary negotiation, and without two weeks' time-allowance.\"  \"They're going to claim that it isn't a strike. They're going to call it a 'spontaneous work-stoppage.'\"  \"Aah! I hope I can get Crandall on record to that effect; I'll fire every one of those men for leaving their work without permission and absence from duty without leave. How many of our own men, from Pittsburgh, do we have working in these machine shops and in the assembly shop here? About sixty?\"  \"Sixty-three. Why? You're not going to use them to work on the reactor, are you?\"  \"I just am. They're all qualified cybernetics technicians; they can do this work better than this gang we've had to hire here. Just to be on the safe side, I'm promoting all of them, as of oh-eight-hundred this morning, to assistant gang-foremen, on salaries. That'll take them outside union jurisdiction.\"  \"But how about our contract with the I.F.A.W.?\"  \"That's been voided, by Crandall's own act, in interfering with the execution of our contract with the Atomic Power Authority. You know what I think? I think the I.F.A.W. front office is going to have to disavow this. It'll hurt them to do it, but they'll have to. Crandall's put them in the middle on this.\"  \"How about security clearance for our own men?\"  \"Nothing to that,\" Melroy said. \"Most of them are security-cleared, already, from the work we did installing that counter-rocket control system on the U.S.S. _Alaska_, and the work we did on that symbolic-logic computer for the Philadelphia Project. It may take all day to get the red tape unwound, but I think we can be ready to start by oh-eight-hundred tomorrow.\"         *       *       *       *       *  By the time Keating had rounded up all the regular Melroy Engineering Corporation employees and Melroy had talked to Colonel Bradshaw about security-clearance, it was 1430. A little later, he was called on the phone by Leighton, the Atomic Power Authority man.  \"Melroy, what are you trying to do?\" the Power Authority man demanded. \"Get this whole plant struck shut? The I.F.A.W.'s madder than a shot-stung bobcat. They claim you're going to bring in strike-breakers; they're talking about picketing the whole reactor area.\"  \"News gets around fast, here, doesn't it?\" Melroy commented. He told Leighton what he had in mind. The Power Authority man was considerably shaken before he had finished.  \"But they'll call a strike on the whole plant! Have you any idea what that would mean?\"  \"Certainly I have. They'll either call it in legal form, in which case the whole thing will go to mediation and get aired, which is what I want, or they'll pull a Pearl Harbor on you, the way they did on me. And in that case, the President will have to intervene, and they'll fly in technicians from some of the Armed Forces plants to keep this place running. And in that case, things'll get settled that much quicker. This Crandall thinks these men I fired are martyrs, and he's preaching a crusade. He ought to carry an _advocatus diaboli_ on his payroll, to scrutinize the qualifications of his martyrs, before he starts canonizing them.\"  A little later, Doris Rives came into the office, her hands full of papers and cards.  \"I have twelve more tests completed,\" she reported. \"Only one washout.\"  Melroy laughed. \"Doctor, they're all washed out,\" he told her. \"It seems there was an additional test, and they all flunked it. Evinced willingness to follow unwise leadership and allow themselves to be talked into improper courses of action. You go on in to New York, and take all the test-material, including sound records, with you. Stay at the hotel--your pay will go on--till I need you. There'll be a Federal Mediation hearing in a day or so.\"  He had two more telephone calls. The first, at 1530, was from Leighton. Melroy suspected that the latter had been medicating his morale with a couple of stiff drinks: his voice was almost jaunty.  \"Well, the war's on,\" he announced. \"The I.F.A.W.'s walking out on the whole plant, at oh-eight-hundred tomorrow.\"  \"In violation of the Federal Labor Act, Section Eight, paragraphs four and five,\" Melroy supplemented. \"Crandall really has stuck his neck in the guillotine. What's Washington doing?\"  \"President Hartley is ordering Navy personnel flown in from Kennebunkport Reaction Lab; they will be here by about oh-three-hundred tomorrow. And a couple of Federal mediators are coming in to La Guardia at seventeen hundred; they're going to hold preliminary hearings at the new Federal Building on Washington Square beginning twenty hundred. A couple of I.F.A.W. negotiators are coming in from the national union headquarters at Oak Ridge: they should be getting in about the same time. You'd better be on hand, and have Dr. Rives there with you. There's a good chance this thing may get cleared up in a day or so.\"  \"I will undoubtedly be there, complete with Dr. Rives,\" Melroy replied. \"It will be a pleasure!\"         *       *       *       *       *  An hour later, Ben Puryear called from the reactor area, his voice strained with anger.  \"Scott, do you know what those--\" He gargled obscenities for a moment. \"You know what they've done? They've re-packed the Number One Doernberg-Giardano; got a chain-reaction started again.\"  \"Who?\"  \"Fred Hausinger's gang. Apparently at Harry Crandall's orders. The excuse was that it would be unsafe to leave the reactor in its dismantled condition during a prolonged shutdown--they were assuming, I suppose, that the strike would be allowed to proceed unopposed--but of course the real reason was that they wanted to get a chain-reaction started to keep our people from working on the reactor.\"  \"Well, didn't"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18949"],["title","Day of the Moron (#5)"],["body","try to stop them?\"  \"Not very hard. I asked him what he had that deputy marshal's badge on his shirt and that Luger on his hip for, but he said he had orders not to use force, for fear of prejudicing the mediators.\"  Melroy swore disgustedly. \"All right. Gather up all our private papers, and get Steve and Joe, and come on out. We only work here--when we're able.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Doris Rives was waiting on the street level when Melroy reached the new Federal Building, in what had formerly been the Greenwich Village district of Manhattan, that evening. She had a heavy brief case with her, which he took.  \"I was afraid I'd keep you waiting,\" she said. \"I came down from the hotel by cab, and there was a frightful jam at Fortieth Street, and another one just below Madison Square.\"  \"Yes, it gets worse every year. Pardon my obsession, but nine times out of ten--ninety-nine out of a hundred--it's the fault of some fool doing something stupid. Speaking about doing stupid things, though--I did one. Forgot to take that gun out of my overcoat pocket, and didn't notice that I had it till I was on the subway, coming in. Have a big flashlight in the other pocket, but that doesn't matter. What I'm worried about is that somebody'll find out I have a gun and raise a howl about my coming armed to a mediation hearing.\"  The hearing was to be held in one of the big conference rooms on the forty-second floor. Melroy was careful to remove his overcoat and lay it on a table in the corner, and then help Doris off with hers and lay it on top of his own. There were three men in the room when they arrived: Kenneth Leighton, the Atomic Power Authority man, fiftyish, acquiring a waistline bulge and losing his hair: a Mr. Lyons, tall and slender, with white hair; and a Mr. Quillen, considerably younger, with plastic-rimmed glasses. The latter two were the Federal mediators. All three had been lounging in arm-chairs, talking about the new plays on Broadway. They all rose when Melroy and Doris Rives came over to join them.  \"We mustn't discuss business until the others get here,\" Leighton warned. \"It's bad enough that all three of us got here ahead of them; they'll be sure to think we're trying to take an unfair advantage of them. I suppose neither of you have had time to see any of the new plays.\"  Fortunately, Doris and Melroy had gone to the theater after dinner, the evening-before-last; they were able to join the conversation. Young Mr. Quillen wanted Doris Rives' opinion, as a psychologist, of the mental processes of the heroine of the play they had seen; as nearly as she could determine, Doris replied, the heroine in question had exhibited nothing even loosely describable as mental processes of any sort. They were still on the subject when the two labor negotiators, Mr. Cronnin and Mr. Fields, arrived. Cronnin was in his sixties, with the nearsighted squint and compressed look of concentration of an old-time precision machinist; Fields was much younger, and sported a Phi Beta Kappa key.  Lyons, who seemed to be the senior mediator, thereupon called the meeting to order and they took their places at the table.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Now, gentlemen--and Dr. Rives--this will be simply an informal discussion, so that everybody can see what everybody else's position in the matter is. We won't bother to make a sound recording. Then, if we have managed to reach some common understanding of the question this evening, we can start the regular hearing say at thirteen hundred tomorrow. Is that agreeable?\"  It was. The younger mediator, Quillen, cleared his throat.  \"It seems, from our information, that this entire dispute arises from the discharge, by Mr. Melroy, of two of his employees, named Koffler and Burris. Is that correct?\"  \"Well, there's also the question of the Melroy Engineering Corporation's attempting to use strike-breakers, and the Long Island Atomic Power Authority's having condoned this unfair employment practice,\" Cronnin said, acidly.  \"And there's also the question of the I.F.A.W.'s calling a Pearl Harbor strike on my company,\" Melroy added.  \"We resent that characterization!\" Cronnin retorted.  \"It's a term in common usage; it denotes a strike called without warning or declaration of intention, which this was,\" Melroy told him.  \"And there's also the question of the I.F.A.W. calling a general strike, in illegal manner, at the Long Island Reaction Plant,\" Leighton spoke up. \"On sixteen hours' notice.\"  \"Well, that wasn't the fault of the I.F.A.W. as an organization,\" Fields argued. \"Mr. Cronnin and I are agreed that the walk-out date should be postponed for two weeks, in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Labor Act.\"  \"Well, how about my company?\" Melroy wanted to know. \"Your I.F.A.W. members walked out on me, without any notice whatever, at twelve hundred today. Am I to consider that an act of your union, or will you disavow it so that I can fire all of them for quitting without permission?\"  \"And how about the action of members of your union, acting on instructions from Harry Crandall, in re-packing the Number One Doernberg-Giardano breeder-reactor at our plant, after the plutonium and the U-238 and the neutron-source containers had been removed, in order to re-initiate a chain reaction to prevent Mr. Melroy's employees from working on the reactor?\" Leighton demanded. \"Am I to understand that the union sustains that action, too?\"  \"I hadn't known about that,\" Fields said, somewhat startled.  \"Neither had I,\" Cronnin added. \"When did it happen?\"  \"About sixteen hundred today,\" Melroy told him.  \"We were on the plane from Oak Ridge, then,\" Fields declared. \"We know nothing about that.\"  \"Well, are you going to take the responsibility for it, or aren't you?\" Leighton insisted.  Lyons, who had been toying with a small metal paperweight, rapped on the table with it.  \"Gentlemen,\" he interrupted. \"We're trying to cover too many subjects at once. I suggest that we confine ourselves, at the beginning, to the question of the dismissal of these men, Burris and Koffler. If we find that the I.F.A.W. has a legitimate grievance in what we may call the Burris-Koffler question, we can settle that and then go on to these other questions.\"  \"I'm agreeable to that,\" Melroy said.  \"So are we,\" Cronnin nodded.  \"All right, then. Since the I.F.A.W. is the complaining party in this question, perhaps you gentlemen should state the grounds for your complaints.\"  Fields and Cronnin exchanged glances: Cronnin nodded to Fields and the latter rose. The two employees in question, he stated, had been the victims of discrimination and persecution because of union activities. Koffler was the union shop-steward for the men employed by the Melroy Engineering Corporation, and Burris had been active in bringing complaints about unfair employment practices. Furthermore, it was the opinion of the I.F.A.W. that the psychological tests imposed on their members had been a fraudulent pretext for dismissing these two men, and, in any case, the practice of compelling workers to submit to such tests was insulting, degrading, and not a customary condition of employment.  With that, he sat down. Melroy was on his feet at once.  \"I'll deny those statements, categorically and seriatim,\" he replied. \"They are based entirely upon misrepresentations made by the two men who were disqualified by the tests and dropped from my payroll because of being, in the words of my contract with your union, 'persons of unsound mind, deficient intelligence and/or emotional instability.' What happened is that your local official, Crandall, accepted everything they told him uncritically, and you accepted everything Crandall told you, in the same spirit.  \"Before I go on,\" Melroy continued, turning to Lyons, \"have I your permission to let Dr. Rives explain about these tests, herself, and tell how they were given and evaluated?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Permission granted by Lyons, Doris Rives rose. At some length, she explained the nature and purpose of the tests, and her method of scoring and correlating them.  \"Well, did Mr. Melroy suggest to you that any specific employee or employees of his were undesirable and ought to be eliminated?\" Fields asked.  \"Certainly not!\" Doris Rives became angry. \"And if he had, I'd have taken the first plane out of here. That suggestion is insulting! And for your information, I never met Mr. Melroy before day-before-yesterday afternoon; I am not dependent upon him for anything; I took this job as an accommodation to Dr. Karl von Heydenreich, who ordinarily does such work for the Melroy company, and I'm losing money by remaining here. Does that satisfy you?\"  \"Yes, it does,\" Fields admitted. He was obviously impressed by mention of the distinguished Austrian psychologist's name. \"If I may ask Mr. Melroy a question: I gather that these tests are given to all your employees. Why do you demand such an extraordinary level of intelligence from your employees, even common laborers?\"  \"Extraordinary?\" Melroy echoed. \"If the standards established by those tests are extraordinary, then God help this country; we are becoming a race of morons! I'll leave that statement to Dr. Rives for confirmation; she's already pointed out that all that is required to pass those tests is ordinary adult mental capacity.  \"My company specializes in cybernetic-control systems,\" he continued. \"In spite of a lot of misleading colloquial jargon about 'thinking machines' and 'giant brains', a cybernetic system doesn't really think. It only does what it's been designed _and built_ to do, and if somebody builds a mistake into it, it will automatically and infallibly repeat that mistake in practice.\"  \"He's right,\" Cronnin said. \"The men that build a machine like that have got to be as smart as the machine's supposed to be, or the machine'll be as dumb as they are.\"  Fields turned on him angrily. \"Which side are"]]]
