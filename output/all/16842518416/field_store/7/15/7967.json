See?\"  \"Oh, we'll play, of course!\" Bruce grumbled, rolling back again.  \"Sus-sure!\" declared Gamp. \"Whatever Mum-Merry says, gug-gug-gug-gug----\"  \"Are you trying to say goshfry?\" Danny mildly asked, wetting the end of an unlighted cigarette.  \"Gug-goes!\" sputtered Gamp, giving Danny a kick that fairly lifted him from the floor. \"You mum-mum-mum-measly runt, I'll kuk-kill you!\"  \"Because he's a joker, Danny thinks he is the only card in the pack!\" said Dismal.  \"If Merry says we can go into that game next Saturday with Badger in the box and earth the wipe--I mean wipe the earth with those fellows from Hartford, we can do it!\" Rattleton declared emphatically. \"You know he wouldn't say such a thing if he wasn't sure of it.\"  \"There are only two absolutely sure things, death and taxes,\" said Merriwell soberly. \"If I put too much emphasis on my belief, I'll have to withdraw it. I mean to say that I believe we can.\"  \"And that's about the same as saying that we can!\" Rattleton asserted.  \"I'm only doubtful about Bart,\" said Dismal, like a prophet of evil.  \"He will never catch for Badger!\" Diamond declared.  \"I think he will!\" sputtered Rattleton. \"He will see it just as we do, after Merry talks with him. Of course, we don't any of us love Badger, but what's the difference?\"  \"Let 'er go!\" cried Bink, holding up his hands as if they gripped a bat. \"Of course, we'll play ball!\"  \"Of course!\" said Dismal. \"We'll pitch Bart out of the camp if he makes a kick. The fellow that balks on that, when he understands it, is 'fit for treason, stratagem, and spoil!'\"  Shortly after, Merriwell met Hodge on the campus, coming from the fence. He saw at once that Bart was \"steaming.\"  \"Look here, Merriwell,\" said Hodge, bristling with indignation. \"It surely can't be true that you're going to put Badger into the pitcher's box next Saturday?\"  Frank took him by the arm and turned with him away from the crowd.  \"Yes,\" he answered, \"I have promised to do that.\"  Hodge's face grew black with wrath.  \"You've made a fool of yourself!\" he roughly declared. \"I wouldn't believe it. I said it was a lie, and I threatened to thump the face off of Donald Pike because he told it. Say, Merry, you don't really mean it?\"  Frank had dropped Bart's arm, but they still walked on together. It was easy to see that he did not like Hodge's tone and manner.  \"I must say you are outspoken and far from complimentary,\" he observed.  \"I know I don't talk like this to you often.\"  \"That's right. If you did, I'm afraid we might not be such good friends.\"  \"But I must talk straight now, Merry!\"  \"I'm willing that you shall drive ahead, but I want you to hold in your temper. Don't let it run away with you.\"  \"Great Scott! how can I hold in my temper under such provocation?\"  \"Simply by holding it in.\"  \"But you know how I hate Badger? You know that we're bitter enemies! You know what I think of him!\"  \"I think I've heard you express some sentiments along that line.\"  \"You know that he was drunk when he went aboard that excursion steamer! And he can't pitch!\"  \"You are wrong there!\" Frank declared positively. \"He can pitch.\"  \"Why, Merry, those Hartford fellows will just put it all over us. I tell you it won't do! You must give it up!\"  \"I suppose you know why I promised to let him pitch?\"  \"Well, I haven't heard, but I can guess. After you'd saved him from drowning himself, and he came to realize what everything meant, he came licking round you, professing gratitude and friendship, and all that sort of stuff. And you----\"  \"See here, Hodge!\" said Frank, with uncommon sternness. \"I won't stand talk like that, and you ought to know it. I'm your friend, as I've proved many times, but I can't remain your friend if you treat me that way. I'm ready to hear your opinions, but I won't stand abuse from you or any other man!\"  \"I told you a good while ago that whenever you and Badger ceased to be enemies you would become friends!\" Bart declared, somewhat softened. \"And now it has come true. You are wanting to befriend and help him now, just as I knew you would. And after all the dirt he has done you! Why, he's put dirt all over you a dozen times!\"  The memory of it caused Bart to lose his head again.  \"Badger is my enemy! A man who is his friend is no friend of mine! That is flat! I don't think I can make it plainer.\"  \"You can't; it's plain enough. Badger is not my friend, but I am not his enemy.\"  \"Don't tell me, Merriwell! You are his friend. You wouldn't ask such a thing, if you weren't. You must know that every one of the fellows will kick. What did you make such a fool promise for?\"  Merriwell's face was flushed.  \"You are making reckless talk, just because you are badly excited, old man! I am sure you will be sorry as soon as you cool off. If I didn't think so, I'd say some things that would be hot enough to take the skin off your face! Now, listen here! I have promised Dunstan Kirk to let Badger pitch next Saturday in that game against Hartford. Kirk thinks it will brace Badger up a little, and perhaps it will. I am willing to help Badger. He can pitch. We need good pitchers. Besides, I have given Kirk my promise. I mean to keep it.\"  Up to that moment, angry and unreasonable as he was, Bart had half-believed that Merriwell might yet back out of his position, and refuse to let Buck go into the box. He saw now how mistaken he had been.  \"And you expect me to catch for that scoundrel?\" he demanded, shaking with rage. \"I tell you, Merriwell, I won't do it! I'll do any reasonable thing you want me to do, but I won't do that! I draw the line there, short and sharp! I won't play in a nine with Buck Badger!\"  \"Very well, then, we'll have to get along without you!\"  \"Do you mean it, Merry?\" Hodge gasped. \"Do you mean that you will choose him before me?\"  \"Nothing of the kind, and you ought to know it. You would know it, if you were not just blind with anger and prejudice. I am not choosing Badger in preference to any of my friends!\"  \"Why aren't you?\"  \"Because I am not. There is no choosing of friends in this. I have said Badger shall pitch in that game. That does not make him my friend, and it ought not to drive any of my friends away. I am manager of the picked nine, and I supposed that my friends who had known me so long would be willing that I should have some privileges.\"  \"But when I declare I won't catch?\"  \"You have no right to make any such declaration.\"  \"Why haven't I?\"  \"Simply because, as my friend, you ought to be willing to aid me in this matter. I shall not put it on any other ground.\"  \"I'll do anything for you, Merry, but that. I can't do that!\"  \"You mean you will not do it!\"  \"I won't do it!\"  \"Then I shall get another catcher!\"  \"Do you mean it?\"  \"I mean it!\"  Hodge seemed stunned for a moment. Then his rage boiled over.  \"All right, Merry!\" he flashed. \"If you want to favor a scoundrel like Badger instead of me, you can do it. But I will not catch in that game. I refuse to play on any nine with Badger! I----\"  \"I remember to have heard you say those things before!\" said Frank, turning short about. \"We will not discuss it any further, Bart. You are a free man. You may do as you please. I shall not argue the matter with you. Badger is going to pitch for me Saturday forenoon. Good day!\"  Hodge stopped and looked after him, all white and shaky, as Merriwell walked away.  Then the hot blood rushed in a tide into his dark face, and he, too, turned and walked off, filled with smothered exclamations and raging like a volcano.     CHAPTER III.  PIKE'S LITTLE PLAN.   Donald Pike was in a nagging mood. He walked up and down the room a few times, finally stopping in front of his chum, Buck Badger. They had been talking about the Saturday ball-game, and both were in bad humor.  \"I don't know what's the matter with you, Badger! I'm disgusted with you!\"  The Westerner shifted his feet nervously, but said nothing.  \"Perhaps you consider it an honor to receive that invitation from Merriwell? I don't! I am surprised that he sent it.\"  Badger shifted his feet again, and shrugged his thick shoulders. His face was flushed and his eyes looked troubled.  \"I am, too!\"  \"He had a motive, of course!\"  Badger tossed a leg over the arm of his chair, and looked out of the window.  \"It has been his boast all along that he would have you in his flock by and by! You have always sworn by all that's good and bad that you would never become a friend of his!\"  \"I'm not a friend of his!\"  Pike laughed sneeringly.  \"What do you call it? If I say a word against Frank Merriwell you want to eat me up. It's come to that! You were ready to fight him any minute, at first; now you're ready to lick the polish off his shoes, just like the rest of those fellows.\"  \"Nothing of the kind!\" Badger hotly declared.  \"Well, you're going to pitch for his picked team Saturday!\"  \"Kirk asked me to.\"  \"And Merriwell sent him?\"  \"Yes!\"  \"And they have become such friends that they're almost chums. The fellows are beginning to say that Dunstan Kirk manages the Yale ball-team, and Frank Merriwell manages Dunstan Kirk. They are about right, I guess!\"  \"I allow that I'm no nearer being Merriwell's chum than I ever was. We could never be chums. But I'm not going to forget what he did for me on the _Crested Foam_. He saved my life, then, Pike!\"  \"And proposes to wind you round his fingers and drag you at his heels to make you pay for it!\"  \"So, when he sent me that invitation, and I talked it over with Kirk, I thought I ought to accept it.\"  \"Don't you know that Hodge will refuse to catch?\"  \"Don't talk about him!\" Badger hissed.  \"He has already said that he will not catch for such a scoundrel as you!\"  \"Did he say that?\"  \"He says you will lose them the game; that it's an outrage to put you into the box, and he won't be a party to it. He says you can't pitch.\"  \"Can'"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19402"],["title","Frank Merriwell's Reward (#3)"],["body","I? He says that, does he?\"  \"He says that if Frank Merriwell takes up with you, he will never speak to him again. Anyhow, what good will it do you to pitch for Merriwell? You'll be no nearer getting a show on the regular nine.\"  Badger shoved his hands deep into his pockets, and showed his broad white teeth unpleasantly. Pike was again walking up and down the room.  \"I'd almost be willing to become a member of Merriwell's flock just to spite Bart Hodge. My hands just naturally go up, and I want to fight whenever I see him. That's whatever!\"  \"Oh, you two will be as chummy as the Siamese twins in less than a month.\"  \"Never! I hate him too badly.\"  \"That's the way you were talking of Merriwell a month ago. You will come round to it!\"  \"Not on your life! Hodge is a different sort of fellow from Merriwell, I allow.\"  \"And you are going to accept that invitation?\"  \"I told you, Pike, that I have already accepted it. I'm not Merriwell's friend, and I despise Bart Hodge; but I'm not ungrateful. Whatever other things we learn out West, we learn to pay back favor for favor. I'd be a dirty coyote if I refused to accept that invitation after what Merriwell did for me. That's the way I look at it. I know that I can pitch ball. You know it, too. I can twirl a ball just as good as Frank Merriwell, or any other fellow in Yale, and you know that, too. I reckon I'm able to ride my bronco alone, without Merriwell's help. I am not asking favors--none whatever! I'm simply returning a favor already given! You can see through that, can't you? If you can't, you're as chuckle-headed as a prairie-dog!\"  \"I can see that you are becoming Frank Merriwell's friend just as fast as you can!\"  \"You're riding away off the line, Pike! I shall never be Merry's friend in the sense you think. But you know that he is the clean white article. He is straight goods. I've found that out. I used to think different, just as you do, but I've found out I was mistaken. He is a square man. And when he sent that invitation I knew there was no underhand business about it whatever. That's the reason I accepted it; that and because it would have made me feel meaner than a Digger Indian if I had refused it. I'm going to pitch for him Saturday forenoon, and I'll win that game for him, too. Don't you let that fact escape your memory! I hope Bart Hodge will refuse to catch. I'm afraid I couldn't resist the temptation to throw the ball square at his head every time, if he was behind the bat. I want him to stay out!\"  \"Well, you're a fool!\" Pike snapped, striding toward the door. \"I never thought you'd do a thing like that. You are no more like the old Badger than a calf is like a mountain-lion. You had some fire in you once, but you have become as soft as a ninny. The whole thing simply makes me sick.\"  Badger's face was red and his neck veins were swelling.  \"I'm not used to any such talk whatever, Pike!\" he exclaimed, as Pike hurled these sentences back at him from the doorway. \"If you say anything like that again I'll kick you down-stairs! I've taken more off of you to-night than I ever thought I could take from any one, and I won't stand it any longer!\"  \"Cool off, old man!\" Pike sneered. \"You're making a chuckle-headed prairie-dog out of yourself, I think. If you should kick me you would kick the best friend you ever had. Good-by. See you later!\"  The Westerner did not even grunt a reply, but sat still in his chair with his hands in his pockets, his eyes glittering, his broad teeth showing, his neck veins protuberant and his face as red as a boiled lobster, while Pike walked away.  When Pike came back to the room Badger was gone. Pike entered with his own key. He knew that the Westerner would likely be away a number of hours, calling on Winnie Lee. He glanced round the room, then went to the closet in which Badger's clothing hung.  Pike was crafty in his hate. He did not intend to lose his grip of the Kansan. He realized that he had gone almost too far. Badger would bear a good deal from him because of what they had been to each other, but to this there were limits. He felt that he had nearly reached the limit.  \"He shall not pitch ball Saturday, if I can help it!\" he hissed, as he looked over the things in the closet. \"If I can work it, it will make Hodge so hot against him that there will be a fight. And perhaps it will turn Merriwell and his precious flock against him, too. It's risky, but it is worth all the risk.\"  He took out a suit of Badger's clothes, and laid it in a chair. Then he went to a desk and selected from it some \"make-up\" preparations which had been there ever since the production of the sophomore play, \"A Mountain Vendetta.\" Then, after locking the door, he arrayed himself in Badger's suit, and, standing before the mirror, applied the preparations to his face, forehead, and eyebrows.  Pike had a good deal of artistic skill in such matters, and in a short time he had darkened his face, blackened his brows and drawn certain lines and colors, that, together with the change produced by the clothing, made him resemble Badger in a remarkable manner. When he put on Badger's hat the alteration seemed complete.  \"Of course, that wouldn't stand close inspection,\" he muttered. \"But there will be no close inspection. I shall look out for that. Now for the voice!\"  He bunched up his shoulders to give them a thick look, cleared his throat, and looking straight at himself in the glass, began to imitate Badger's tones and characteristics of speech, speaking so low, however, that there was no danger of being heard by any one who might chance to pass.  \"I allow that I'm a Kansan from away beyond the Kaw, and I reckon I'm a diamond pure without the slightest flaw! Sure! A genuine prairie-dog from the short-grass country couldn't chatter more like a Westerner than that. That would fool Badger himself. That's whatever! Yes, I reckon. My daddy is a rancher, and I allow that I am great; for my home is on the boundless plains of the wonderful Sunflower State! If I should practise, I reckon I could become a poet!\"  Satisfied with his make-up and his abilities to imitate Badger's tone and language, Donald Pike returned the unused articles to the drawer, put away the clothing he had removed, and then sneaked down into the campus, carrying under his coat a long, stout cord. Keeping away from the electric lamps and other lights he slipped stealthily on until he reached the entrance which led to the rooms occupied by Merriwell and Hodge.  Diamond and Browning came down, talking in low tones of Merry and Bart, and from this talk, Pike, who had withdrawn into the shadows, learned that both Hodge and Frank were out in town somewhere. This suited Pike's plans, and when Diamond and Bruce disappeared, he crawled into the shadow of a column and watched the path along which Hodge and Merriwell would come on their return.  \"They'll not come back together, sure, unless all the stories I've heard are lies; for they're not on speaking terms!\" he reflected. \"The only thing I fear is that Hodge may not care to come to his rooms at all.\"  The thought made him uneasy, and caused the vigil which followed to appear torturingly long.  \"Ah! there he is!\" he whispered, at last.  Slipping across the path, he tied an end of the cord he had brought to a post, then retreated into the shadow and tied the other end about the column. The youth he had seen came on at a brisk walk. Pike was sure it was Hodge. He almost ceased to breathe as the unsuspecting young fellow approached the cord. He put himself in position for a hasty spring.  Crash!  The youth tripped over the string, and went down headlong, falling heavily.  \"I reckon I've got you now!\" Pike hissed in a low tone, imitating Badger's voice, and at the same time leaping toward the prostrate form. Deceived by the darkness, Donald Pike had tripped Frank Merriwell, but he did not yet know it. With that imitation of the Westerner's speech, he knocked Merriwell down, as the latter tried to get up.  Again he struck, as Frank attempted to rise, but Merriwell dodged the blow, and, catching Pike by the legs, threw him. Before Pike could realize what had happened, Merriwell was on top, with his fingers at Pike's throat.  \"You scoundrel!\" Frank hissed. \"I am tempted to give you what you deserve for that!\"  But Pike was not ready to surrender, though he knew now that he had committed a woful blunder. In fact, the knowledge that he was dealing with Frank Merriwell aroused him to a fierce resistance. He felt that it would simply be ruinous to be held and recognized by Merriwell, and he began to fight like a demon to get away.  He freed his hands, and struck Frank heavily in the face, at the same time kicking with all his might. He tried to thrust his thumbs into Frank's eyes.  \"I'll kill you, if you don't let me go!\" he snarled.  Frank had felt from the first that his assailant could not be Buck Badger; now he recognized the voice of Donald Pike, for Pike, in his fright and desperation, forgot to keep up the disguise.  Seeing that the only way to deal with Pike was to choke him into semi-insensibility, he caught and crushed down the flailing fists and arms and tightened his grip on Pike's throat. Pike writhed and flounced, kicking and struggling, but all without avail. That viselike grip grew tighter and tighter. The pain seemed unbearable. He gurgled and choked, and his lungs seemed to be bursting. He could not breathe, and his brain began to reel.  \"Give in?\" Frank asked.  \"Don't k-k-k-ill me!\" Pike gasped, as the grip on his throat relaxed.  \"You deserve it, you scoundrel!\"  Frank took his knee from Pike's breast, removed the choking hand, and flung Pike from him.  \"Now get up!\" he commanded. \"Get up before I am tempted to kick you across the campus!\"  Pike shuffled and evaded, as his breath came back.  \"I thought you were Badger, and I was just playing a little joke on you!\" he whined.  \"Get up!\" Frank exclaimed.  Pike struggled up, and Merriwell "]]]
