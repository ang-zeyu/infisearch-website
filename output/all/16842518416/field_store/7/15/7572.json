The men of the valley farmed diversified crops, furnishing all that was needed for food and clothing, and they even raised tobacco for the pipes smoked at the general store run by Coonrod Pile in an end room of his home.  It was the day when the weaving-loom was the piano in the home, and all the women carded, spun and wove. The table-garden, the care of the house, the preparation of the meals and the making of the covering and the clothes were in the women's division of the labor. The families usually were large and every member a producer. To the girls fell shares of the mother's work. The boys helped in the fields, chopped the wood and rounded up the stock, that at times wandered far into the mountains. There were bells on the cows, on the sheep and even the hogs, and the boys soon learned to distinguish ownerships by the delicate differences in the browsing \"tong\" in the tone of the bells.  Residents of the valley sold to the outside world the live stock they raised, and poultry and feathers and furs, and tar and resin from the pines on the mountaintops. They purchased tea, coffee and sugar, a few household and farm conveniences, and little else. The balance of the trade was heavily in their favor and they were prosperous and happy.  They had no labor problems. They recognized without collective bargaining the eight-hour shift--\"eight hours agin dinner and eight hours after hit; ef hit don't rain;\" as one old mountaineer, living there to-day, interpreted the phrase, \"A day's work.\"  Even when the home of the mountaineer was a one- or two-room cabin, accommodations for any stranger could be provided, and if he wished to remain, work could be found for him. They observed without thought of inconvenience the Colonial idea of \"bundling.\"  When the stranger proved worthy there would be a log-rolling and a space of ground cleared for him to till, and a log-raising in which the community joined, and made a merry occasion of it, to give him a home. The way was easy for his ownership of the land and the cabin. Prices for cleared land, around the middle of the last century, ranged from twenty-five cents to five dollars an acre.  In the valley the father never talked to the son of the dignity of labor. Much was to be done and everyone labored and thought of it as but the proper use of the sunlight of a day.  Their life was primitive, rugged, but contented. Deer and bears were in the mountains, and wild turkeys were to be found in large flocks, while the cry of wolves added zest to the whine of a winter wind.  A cook-stove was an unknown luxury, and the women prepared their meals in the open fireplace. The men cut their small grain with a reap-hook and threshed it beneath the hoofs of horses.  The mode of life made men of strong convictions and deep feelings. But those feelings were seldom expressed except under the influence of religious devotions.  The ministers were all circuit riders and venerated leaders of the people of the mountainsides. They traveled the mountains on horseback, constantly exposed to hardships, and they labored devoutly without consideration of the personal cost. It was the custom for these itinerant ministers to give free rein to their horses and read as they rode the mountain-paths, stopping for a prayer at every home they reached. Protracted meetings were held in almost every community they visited, for many months would pass before they returned. Funeral services would be held for all who had died during the absence of the minister. The meetings lasted so long as there was hope of a single conversion.  One of the preachers of those old days, who was born in the \"Valley of the Three Forks o' the Wolf\" and preached at Pall Mall as part of his circuit when ordained, has left a record of one year's work:  \"During the conference year I preached 152 times, traveled 1,918 miles on horseback, prayed with 424 families, witnessed 80 conversions to God, and received 67 persons into the church. I sold about $40 worth of books, baptized 40 adults and 18 infants ... and received less than $30 of salary for same, and raised for benevolence $36.25. To God be all the glory! I have toiled and endured as seeing Him who is invisible. However, when God has poured from clouds of mercy rich salvation upon the people, and when in religious enjoyment, from the most excellent glory, I have been lifted to Pisgah's top, and have seen by faith the goodly land before me, I would not exchange this work for a city station.\"  Against the worldliness of some of his people, the same old mountain minister recorded a protest:  \"I have known families who had three or four hundred dollars loaned out on interest, and not less than five hundred dollars' worth of fat cattle on the range, who did not own a Bible, or take any religious newspaper, nor any other kind, and did not have any books in their homes, and yet owned two or three fiddles and three or four rifle-guns.\"  The day of prosperity and religious contentment at Pall Mall lasted until the coming of the Civil War.  Fentress county had contributed its pro rata of volunteers to the conflict with Mexico, and Uriah York, the grandfather of Sergeant York, was among those who stormed the heights at Chapultepec.  Tho this war was declared by a President who came from Tennessee, the Mexican conflict did not reach to the firesides and into the hearts of the people of the mountains of the state as other wars had done. So years passed in which there was no outward evidence of the war spirit of Fentress county that was soon to tear families asunder, leave farms untenanted and to obliterate graveyards under the rush of horses' hoofs.  The Yorks had come to Fentress county from North Carolina and settled on Indian Creek. Uriah York was the son of John York, and they came from Buncombe county in that \"Old North State,\" the county which had a reputation like Nazareth so far as turning out any good thing was concerned, and the path of the cant, derisive phrase, \"All bunkum,\" leads directly back to the affairs of that good old county.  On Indian Creek the Yorks were farmers, but at his home Uriah started one of the few schools then in Fentress county. His school began after crops were laid by and ran for three months. He used but two text books--the \"blue-backed speller\" and the Bible.  There are men living to-day on Indian Creek who went to school under Uriah York, and they recall the uniqueness of his discipline as well as his school curriculum. The hickory rod was the enforcer of school rules, but full opportunity to contemplate the delicate distinction between right and wrong was given to all. A three-inch circle was drawn upon the schoolroom wall and the offending pupil was compelled to hold his nose within the penal mark until penitent.  Young and active he took part in all the school sports in the long recess periods, for his school lasted all day. Learning at the end of one school term that the pupils had planned as part of the simple commencement exercises to duck him in Indian Creek, he exposed their plot, playfully defied them, left the schoolroom with a bound through an open window and led them on a chase through the mountains. He circled in his course so he could lead the run back to the schoolhouse. As evidence of goodfellowship and as an example of the spirit of generosity in the celebration of victory, he gave to each of the boys as they came in, a drink of whisky, from a clay demijohn he had concealed in the schoolroom.  But in those days whisky and apple brandy were considered a necessary part of household supplies, and there was but little drunkenness. Whisky and brandy were medicine, used as first aid, regardless of the ailment, while awaiting the arrival of the doctor with his saddlebags of pills and powders. Their social value, too, was recognized, and the gourd and demijohn appeared almost simultaneously with the arrival of any guest. But it was bad form--evidence of a weak will--for anyone, save the old men, to show the influence of what they drank. This was, however, a perquisite and one of the tolerated pleasures of old age.  In the records of a lawsuit tried in Fentress county in 1841 the price-list of some necessaries and luxuries are shown:  \"To two gallons of liquor, $1; one quart of whisky and six pounds of pork, 80 cents; one deer-skin, 75 cents; two kegs of tar, $2; two ounces of indigo, 40 cents; one gallon of whisky, 50 cents; five and one-half pints of apply brandy, 31-1/4 cents.\"  They were almost uneventful years at Pall Mall from the days of Coonrod Pile until the Civil War. Less than a score of years lapsed from the death of the pioneer in 1849 until over the mountains broke the warstorm in a fury that has no parallel except in wars where father has fought son, and brother fought brother; where the cause of war and the principles for which it is fought are lost in the presence of cruelties created in personal hatred and deeds of treachery perpetrated for revenge. A third generation had grown to manhood at Pall Mall.  In Fentress county, the polling of the vote upon secession was marked with bloodshed. The county was on the military border between the free and the slaveholding states. Coonrod Pile had been a slaveholder, but few of the mountaineers were owners. Slavery as an institution did not appeal to their Anglo-Saxon principles; poverty had prevented slavery's advance into the mountains as a custom, and as racial distinction was not to be clearly defined into master and worker, the negro's presence in the mountains was unwelcomed. A war to uphold a custom they did not practise did not appeal to them; so as a great wedge the Alleghany mountains, extending far into the slaveholding states, was peopled with Union sympathizers.  Fentress county on the slope of the great mountain range and on the border between the territory firmly held by the North and by the South became a no-man's land, subjected successively to marauding"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19135"],["title","The Southerner: A Romance of the Real Lincoln (#0)"],["body","was produced from images generously made available by The Kentuckiana Digital Library)          THE SOUTHERNER  _A ROMANCE OF THE REAL LINCOLN_  BY  THOMAS DIXON  _\"Have you never realized it, my friends, that Lincoln, though grafted on the West, is essentially, in personnel and character, a Southern contribution?\"_--WALT WHITMAN.

THE SOUTHERNER    PROLOGUE  I   Tom seated himself at the table and looked into his wife's face with a smile:  \"Nancy, it's a meal fit for a king!\"  The supper over, he smoked his pipe before the cabin fire of blazing logs, while she cleared the wooden dishes. He watched her get the paper, goose-quill pen and ink as a prisoner sees the scaffold building for his execution.  \"Now we're all ready,\" she said cheerfully.  The man laid his pipe down with a helpless look. A brief respite flashed through his mind. Maybe he could sidestep the lessons before she pinned him down.  \"Lord, Nancy, I forgot my gun. I must grease her right away,\" he cried.  He rose with a quick decisive movement and took his rifle from the rack. She knew it was useless to protest and let him have his way.  Over every inch of its heavy barrel and polished walnut stock he rubbed a piece of greased linen with loving care, drew back the flint-lock and greased carefully every nook and turn of its mechanism, lifted the gun finally to his shoulder and drew an imaginary bead on the head of a turkey gobbler two hundred yards away. A glowing coal of hickory wood in the fire served for his game.  He lowered the gun and held it before him with pride:  \"Nancy, she's the dandiest piece o' iron that wuz ever twisted inter the shape of a weepon. Old 'Speakeasy's her name! She's got the softest voice that ever whispered death to a varmint or an Injun--hit ain't much louder'n the crack of a whip, but, man alive, when she talks she says somethin'. 'Kerpeow!' she whispers soft an' low! She's got a voice like yourn, Nancy--kinder sighs when she speaks----\"  \"Well,\" the wife broke in with a shake of her dark head, \"has mother's little boy played long enough with his toy?\"  \"I reckon so,\" Tom laughed.  \"Then it's time for school.\" She gently took the rifle from his hands, placed it on the buck horns and took her seat at the table.  The man looked ruefully at the stool, suddenly straightened his massive frame, lifted his hand above his head and cocked his eye inquiringly:  \"May I git er drink er water fust?\"  The teacher laughed in spite of herself:  \"Yes, you big lubber, and hurry up.\"  Tom seized the water bucket and started for the door.  \"Where are you going?\" she cried in dismay.  \"I'll jest run down to the spring fer a fresh bucket----\"  \"O Tom!\" she exclaimed.  \"I'll be right back in a minute, Honey,\" he protested softly. \"Hit's goin' ter be powerful hot--I'll need a whole bucket time I'm through.\"  Before she could answer he was gone.  He managed to stay nearly a half hour. She put the baby to sleep and sat waiting with her pensive young eyes gazing at the leaping flames. She heard him stop and answer the call of an owl from the woods. A whip-poor-will was softly singing from the bushes nearby. He stopped to call him also, and then found an excuse to linger ten minutes more fooling with his dogs.  The laggard came at last and dropped on his stool by her side. He sat for five minutes staring helplessly at the copy she had set. Big beads of perspiration stood on his forehead when he took the pen. He held it awkwardly and timidly as if it were a live reptile. She took his clumsy hand in hers and showed him how to hold it.  \"My, but yo' hand's soft an' sweet, Nancy,--jest lemme hold that a while----\"  She rapped his knuckles.  \"All right, teacher, I'll be good,\" he protested, and bent his huge shoulders low over his task. He bore so hard on the frail quill pen the ink ran in a big blot.  \"Not so hard, Tom!\" she cried.  \"But I got so much strenk in my right arm I jist can't hold it back.\"  \"You must try again.\"  He tried again and made a heavy tremulous line. His arm moved at a snail's gait and wobbled frightfully.  \"Make the line quicker,\" she urged encouragingly. \"Begin at the top and come down----\"  \"Here, you show me how!\"  She took his rough hand quietly in hers, and guided it swiftly from right to left in straight smooth lines until a dozen were made, when he suddenly drew her close, kissed her lips, and held the slender fingers in a grip of iron. She lay still in his embrace for a moment, released herself and turned from him with a sigh. He drew her quickly to the light of the fire and saw the unshed tears in her eyes.  \"What's the use ter worry, Nancy gal?\" he said. \"Give it up ez a bad job. I wouldn't fool with no sech scholar ef I wuz you. Ye can't teach an old dog new tricks----\"  \"I won't give up!\" she cried with sudden energy. \"I can teach you and I will. I won't give up and be nobody. O Tom, you promised me before we were married to let me teach you--didn't you promise?\"  \"Yes, Honey, I did----\" he paused and his fine teeth gleamed through the black beard--\"but ye know a feller'll promise any thing ter git his gal----\"  \"Didn't you mean to keep your word?\" She broke in sharply.  \"Of course I did, Nancy, I never wuz more earnest in my life--'ceptin when I got religion. But I had no idee larnin' come so hard. I'd ruther fight Injuns an' wil' cats or rob a bee tree any day than ter tackle them pot hooks you're sickin' after me----\"  \"Well, I won't give up,\" she interrupted impatiently, \"and you'd just as well make up your mind to stick to it. You can do what other men have done. You're good, honest and true, you're kindhearted and popular. They've already made you the road supervisor of this township. Learn to read and write and you can make a good speech and go to the Legislature.\"  \"Ah, Nancy, what do ye want me ter do that fur, anyhow, gal? I'd be the happiest man in the world right here in this cabin by the woods ef you'd jest be happy with me. Can't ye quit hankerin' after them things, Honey?\"  She shook her dark head firmly.  \"You know, Nancy, we wuz neighbors to Dan'l Boone. We thought he wuz about the biggest man that ever lived. Somehow the love o' the woods an' fields is always singin' in my heart. Them still shinin' stars up in the sky out thar to-night keep a callin' me. I could hear the music o' my hounds in my soul ez I stood by the spring a while ago. Ye know what scares me most ter death sometimes, gal?\" He paused and looked into her eyes intently.  \"No, what?\" she asked.  \"That you'll make a carpenter outen me yit ef I don't mind.\"  Again a smile broke through the cloud in her eyes: \"I don't think there's much danger of _that_, Tom----\"  \"Yes ther is, too,\" he laughed. \"Ye see, I love you so and try ter make ye happy, an' ef there wuz ter"]]]
