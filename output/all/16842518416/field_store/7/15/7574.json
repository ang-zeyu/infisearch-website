That's what the Bible means when it says, 'the stork knoweth her appointed time.' I read that to you the other night, don't you remember?\"  \"But maybe God'll be so busy he'll forget my birds?\"  \"He never forgets, he counts the beat of a sparrow's wing.\"  The mother's faith was contagious. The drooping spirit caught the flash of light from her eyes and smiled.  \"We'll watch for 'em next spring, won't we? And I'll put up new gourds long before they come!\"  Comforted at last, he went to the woods to gather chinquapins. The squirrels were scampering in all directions and he asked his father that night to let him go hunting with him next day.  \"All right, Boy!\" was the hearty answer. \"We'll have some fun this winter.\"  He paused as he saw the mother's lips suddenly close and a shadow pass over her dark, sensitive face.  \"Hit's no use ter worry, Nancy,\" he went on good-naturedly. \"I promised you not ter take him 'less he wanted ter go. But hit's in the blood, and hit's got ter come out.\"  Tom picked the Boy up and placed him on his knee and stroked his dark head. Sarah crouched at his feet and smiled. He was going to tell about the Indians again. She could tell by the look in his eye as he watched the flames leap over the logs.  \"Did ye know, Boy,\" he began slowly, \"that we come out to Kaintuck with Daniel Boone?\"  \"Did we?\"  \"Yes sirree, with old Dan'l hisself. It wuz thirty years ago. I wuz a little shaver no bigger'n you, but I remember jest as well ez ef it wuz yistiddy. Lordy, Boy, thar wuz er man that wuz er man! Ye couldn't a made no jackleg carpenter outen him----\" He paused and cast a sly wink at Nancy as she bent over her knitting.  \"Tell me about him?\" the Boy cried.  \"Yessir, Dan'l Boone wuz a man an' no mistake. The Indians would ketch 'im an' keep er ketchin' 'im an' he'd slip through their fingers slicker'n a eel. The very fust trip he tuck out here he wuz captured by the Redskins. Dan'l wuz with his friend John Stuart.  \"They left their camp one day an' set out on a big hunt, and all of a sudden they wuz grabbed by the Injuns.\"  \"Why didn't they shoot 'em?\" the Boy asked.  \"They wuz too many of 'em an' they wuz too quick for Dan'l. He didn't have no show at all. The Injuns robbed 'em of everything they had an' kept 'em prisoners.  \"But ole Dan'l wuz a slick un. He'd been studyin' Injuns all his life an' he knowed 'em frum a ter izard. They didn't have nothin' but bows an' arrers then an' he had a rifle thes like mine. He never got flustered or riled by the way they wuz treatin' him, but let on like he wuz happy ez er June bug. Dan'l would raise his rifle, put a bullet twixt a buffalo's eyes an' he'd drap in his tracks. The Injuns wuz tickled ter death an' thought him the greatest man that ever lived--an' he wuz, too. So they got ter likin' him an' treatin' 'im better. For seven days an' nights him an' Stuart helped 'em hunt an' showed 'em how ter work er rifle. The Injuns was plum fooled by Dan'l's friendly ways an' didn't watch 'im so close.  \"So one night Dan'l helped 'em ter eat a bigger supper than ever. They wuz all full enough ter bust, an' went ter sleep an' slept like logs. Hit wuz a dark night an' the fire burned low, an' long 'bout midnight Dan'l made up his mind ter give 'em the slip.  \"Hit wuz er dangerous job. Ef he failed hit wuz death shore-nuff, for nothin' makes a Injun so pizen mad ez fer anybody ter be treated nice by 'em an' then try ter get away. The Redskins wuz all sleepin' round the fire. They wuz used ter jumpin' in the middle o' the night or any minute. Mebbe they wuz all ersleep, an' mebbe they wasn't.  \"Old Dan'l he pertended ter be sleepin' the sleep er the dead, an' I tell ye he riz mighty keerful, shuck Stuart easy, waked him up an' motioned him ter foller. Talk about sneakin' up on a wild duck er a turkey--ole Dan'l done some slick business gettin' away frum that fire! Man, ef they'd rustled a leaf er broke a twig, them savages would a all been up an' on 'em in a minute. Holdin' tight to their guns--you kin bet they didn't leave them--and a steppin' light ez feathers they crept away from the fire an' out into the deep dark o' the woods. They stopped an' stood as still ez death an' watched till they see the Injuns hadn't waked----\"  The pioneer paused and his white teeth shone through his black beard as he cocked his shaggy head to one side and looked into the Boy's wide eyes.  \"And then what do you reckon Dan'l Boone done, sir?\"  \"What?\"  \"Waal, ye seed the way them bees made fer their trees, didn't ye, when they got a load er honey?\"  \"Yes, that's the way I found their home.\"  \"But you had the daylight, mind ye! And Dan'l was in pitch black night, but, sir, he made a bee-line through them dark woods straight for his camp he'd left seven days afore. And, man, yer kin bet they made tracks when they got clear o' the Redskins! Hit wuz six hours till day an' when the Injuns waked they didn't know which way ter look----\"  Tom paused and the Boy cried eagerly:  \"Did they get there?\"  \"Git whar?\" the father asked dreamily.  \"Get back to their own camp?\"  \"Straight ez a bee-line I tell ye. But the camp had been busted and robbed and the other men wuz gone.\"  \"Gone where?\"  Tom shook his shaggy head.  \"Nobody never knowed ter this day--reckon the Injuns scalped 'em----\"  He paused again and a dreamy look overspread his rugged face.  \"Like they scalped your own grandpa that day.\"  \"Did they scalp my grandpa?\" the Boy asked in an awed whisper.  \"That they did. Your Uncle Mordecai an' me was workin' with him in the new ground, cleanin' it fur corn when all of a sudden the Injuns riz right up outen the ground. Your grandpa drapped dead the fust shot, an' Mordecai flew ter the cabin fer the rifle. A big Redskin jumped over a log an' scalped my own daddy before my eyes! He grabbed me an' started pullin' me ter the woods, an' then, Sonny, somethin' happened----\"  Tom looked at the long rifle in its buck's horn rest and smiled:  \"Old 'Speakeasy' up thar stretched her long neck through a chink in the logs an' said somethin' ter Mr. Redskin. She didn't raise her voice much louder'n a whisper. She jist kinder sighed:  \"_Kerpeow!_\"  \"I kin hear hit echoin' through them woods yit. That Injun drapped my hands before I heerd the gun, an' she hadn't more'n sung out afore he wuz lyin' in a heap at my feet. The ball had gone clean through him----\"  Tom paused again and looked for a long time in silence into the glowing coals. The little cabin was very still. The Boy lifted his face to his mother's curiously:  \"Ma, you said God counted the beat of a sparrow's wing?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Well, what was He doin' when that Indian scalped my grandpa?\"  The mother threw a startled look at the bold little questioner and answered reverently:  \"Keeping watch in Heaven, my Boy. The hairs of your head are numbered and not one falls without his knowledge. We had to pay the price of blood for this beautiful country. Nothing is ever worth having that doesn't cost precious lives.\"  Again the cabin was still. An owl's deep cry boomed from the woods and a solitary wolf answered in the distance. The Boy's brow was wrinkled for a moment and then he suddenly looked up to his father's rugged face:  \"And what became of Dan'l Boone?\"  \"Oh, he lit on his feet all right. He always did. He moved on with Stuart, built him another camp in the deepest woods he could find and hunted there all winter--jest think, Boy, all winter--every day--thar wuz a man that wuz a man shore nuff!\"  \"Yes, sirree!\" the listener agreed.  The mother lifted her head and thoughtfully watched the sparkling eyes.  \"And do you want to know why Daniel Boone was great, my son?\" she quietly asked.  \"Yes, why?\" was the quick response.  \"Because he used his mind and his hands, while the other men around him just used their hands. He learned to read and write when he was a little boy. He mixed brains with his powder and shot.\"  \"Did he, Pa?\" the questioner cried.  The father smiled. He could afford to be generous. The Boy looked to him as the authority on Daniel Boone.  \"Yes, I reckon he did. He wuz smart. I didn't have no chance when I wuz little.\"  \"Then I'm going to learn, too. Ma can teach me.\" He leaped from his father's lap and climbed into hers. \"You will, won't you, Ma?\"  The mother smiled us she slowly answered:  \"Yes, Honey, I'll begin to-morrow night when you get back from hunting.\"   VI  Slowly but surely the indomitable will within the Boy's breast conquered the cries of aching muscles, and he went about his daily farm tasks with the dogged persistence of habit. He had learned to whistle at his work and his eager mind began to look for new worlds to conquer.  At the right moment the tempter appeared. It rained on Saturday and Austin, his neighbor, came over to see him. They cracked walnuts and hickory-nuts in the loft while the rain pattered noisily on the board roof. Austin had a definite suggestion for Sunday that would break the monotony of life.  \"Let's me an' you not go ter meetin' ter-morrow?\" the neighbor ventured for a starter.  \"All right!\" the Boy agreed. \"Preachin' makes me tired anyhow.\"  \"Me, too, an' I tell ye what I'll do. I'll get my Ma ter let me come ter your house to stay all day, an' when your folks go off ter meetin', me an' you'll have some fun!\"  \"What?\"  \"We'll stay all day on the creek banks, find duck nests, turkey and quail nests, an',----\" Austin paused and dropped his voice, \"go in swimmin' if we take a notion----\"  The Boy slowly shook his head.  \"No, less don't do that.\"  \"Why?\"  \"'Cause Ma don't 'low me to go in the creek till June--says I might ketch my death o' cold.\"  \"Shucks! I've been in twice already!\"  \"Have ye?\"  \"Yep!\"  \"And ye didn't get sick?\"  \"Do I _look_ sick?\"  \"Not a bit.\"  \"Well, then?\"  \"All right--we'll go.\"  The spirit of freedom born of the fields and woods had grown into something more than an attitude of mind. He was ready for the deed--the positive act of adventure. He didn't like to disobey "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19135"],["title","The Southerner: A Romance of the Real Lincoln (#4)"],["body","mother. But he couldn't afford to let Austin think that he was a molly-coddle, a mere babe hanging to her skirts. He was doing a man's work. It was time he took a few of man's privileges.  He revelled in the situation of adventure that night and saw himself the hero of stirring scenes.  Next morning on Austin's arrival he asked his mother to let him stay at home and play.  \"Don't you want to go to meeting and hear the new preacher?\" she asked persuasively.  \"No, I'm tired.\"  The mother smiled indulgently. He was young--far too young yet to know the meaning of true religion. She was a Baptist, and the first principle of her religion was personal faith and direct relations of the individual soul with God. She remembered her own hours of torture in childhood.  \"All right, Boy,\" she said graciously. \"Be good now, while we're gone.\"  His big toe was digging in the dirt while he murmured:  \"Yes'm.\"  The wagon had no sooner disappeared than he and Austin were flying with swift bare feet along the path that led to the creek. It was the hottest day of the spring--a close air and broiling sun to be remembered longer than the hottest day of August.  They ran for a mile without a pause, rolled in the sand on the banks of the creek and shouted their joy in perfect freedom. They explored the deep cane brakes and stalked imaginary buffaloes and bears without number, encountering nothing bigger than a grey fox and a couple of muskrats.  \"Let's cross over!\" Austin cried. \"I saw a bear track on that side one day. We can trail him to his den and show him to your Pap when he comes home. Here's a log!\"  The Boy looked dubiously, measured it with his eye, and shook his head.  \"Nope--it's too little and too high in the air--it'll wobble,\" he declared.  \"But we can coon it over!\" Austin urged. \"We can grab hold of a limb over there and slide down--it's easy--come on!\"  Before he could make further objection, the young adventurer quickly straddled the swaying pole, and, with the agility of a cat, hopped across, grasped one of the limbs and slipped to the sand.  \"Come on!\" he shouted. \"See how easy it is!\"  The Boy looked doubtfully at the swaying sapling and wished he had gone to hear that preacher after all. It would never do to say he was afraid. The other fellow had done it so quickly. And it was no use to argue with Austin that his legs were shorter, his body more compact and so much easier to hold his balance. The idea of cowardice was something too vile for thought. The Boy felt that he was doomed to fall before he moved but he waved a brave little hand in answer:  \"All right, I'm comin'!\"  Half way across the pole began to tear its roots from the bluff. He felt it sinking, stopped and held his breath as it suddenly broke with a crash and fell.  \"Look out! Hold tight!\" Austin yelled.  He did his best, but lost his balance and toppled head downward into the deep still water.  His mouth flew open at the first touch of the chill stream; he gasped for breath and drew into his lungs a strangling flood. The blood rushed to his brain in a wild explosion of terror. He struck out madly with his long arms and legs, fighting with desperation for breath and drinking in only the agony and fear of death. His mother's voice came low and faint and far away in some other world, saying softly:  \"Be good now, while we're gone!\"  Again he struck out blindly, fiercely, madly into the darkness that was slowly swallowing him body and soul.  His hand touched something as he sank, he grasped it with instinctive terror and knew no more until he waked in the infernal regions with the Devil sitting on his stomach glaring into his eyes and holding him by the throat trying to choke him to death. His head was down a steep hill.  With a mighty effort he threw the Devil off, loosed his hold and sucked in a tiny breath of air, and then another and another, coughing and spluttering and wheezing foam and water from his mouth and ears and nose and eyes.  At last a voice gasped:  \"Is--that--you--Austin?\"  \"You bet it's me! I got ye a breathin' all right now--who'd ye think it wuz?\"  The Boy coughed again and squeezed his lungs clear of water.  \"Why--I was afraid I was dead and you was the Old Scratch and had me.\"  \"Well, I thought you was a goner shore nuff till yer hand grabbed the pole I stuck after ye. Man alive, but you did hold onto it! I lakened ter never got yer hand loose so's I could pull ye up on the bank and turn ye upside down and squeeze the water outen ye.\"  \"Did you sit on my stomach and choke me?\" the Boy asked.  \"I set on yer and mashed the water out, but I didn't choke you.\"  \"I thought the Old Scratch had me!\"  For an hour they talked in awed whispers of Sin and Death and Trouble and then the blood of youth shook off the nightmare.  They were alive and unhurt. They were all right and it was a good joke. They swore eternal secrecy. The day was yet young and it was a glorious one. Their clothes were wet and they had to be dried before night. That settled it. They would strip, hang their clothes in the hot sun and wallow in the sand and play in the shallow water until sundown.  \"And besides,\" Austin urged, \"this here's a warnin' straight from the Lord--me and you must learn ter swim.\"  \"That's so, ain't it?\" the Boy agreed.  \"It's what I calls a sign from on high--and it pints right into the creek!\"  They agreed that the thing to do was to heed at once this divine revelation and devote the whole Sabbath day to the solemn work--in the creek.  They found a beautifully sunny spot with an immense sand bar and wide shallow safe waters. They carefully placed their clothes to dry and basked in the bright sun. They practiced swimming in water waist deep and Austin learned to make three strokes and reach the length of his body before sinking.  They rolled in the sun again and ate their lunch. They ran naked through the woods to a branch that flowed into the creek, followed it to the source and drank at a beautiful spring.  Through the long afternoon they lived in a fairy world of freedom, of dreams and make-believe. They talked of great hunters and discussed the best methods of attacking all manner of wild beasts.  The sun was sinking toward the western hills when they hastily picked up their clothes and found a safe ford across which they could wade, holding their things above their heads.  The Boy reached the house just as the wagon drove up to the door. He hurried to help his father with the horse. A sense of elation filled his mind that he was shrewd enough to keep his own secrets. Of course, his mother needn't know what had happened. He was none the worse for it.  In answer to her question of how he had spent the day he vaguely answered:  \"In the woods. They're awfully pretty now with the dogwood all in bloom.\"  He talked incessantly at supper, teasing Sarah about her jolly time at the meeting. Toward the end of the meal he grew silent. A curious sensation began on his back and shoulders and arms. He paid no attention to it at first, but it rapidly grew worse. The more he tried to shake off the feeling the more distinct and sharp it grew. At last every inch of his body seemed to be on fire.  He rose slowly from the table and walked to his stool in the corner wondering--wondering and fearing. He sat in dead silence for half an hour. The perspiration began to stand out on his forehead. It was no use longer to try to fool himself, there was something the matter--something big--something terrible! A fierce and scorching fever was burning him to death. He dared not move. Every muscle quivered with agony when he tried.  The mother's keen eye saw the tears he couldn't keep back.  \"What's the matter, Boy?\" she tenderly asked while his father was at the stable putting the wagon under the shed.  \"I don't know 'm,\" he choked. \"I'm all on fire--I'm burnin' up----\"  She touched his forehead and slipped her arm around his shoulders.  He screamed with pain.  The mother looked into his face with a sudden start.  \"Why, what on earth, child? What have you been doing to-day?\"  He hesitated and tried to be brave, but it was no use. He felt that he would drop dead the next moment unless relief came. He buried his face in her lap and sobbed his bitter confession.  \"Do you think I'm going to die?\" he asked.  She smiled:  \"No, my Boy, you're only sunburned. How long were you naked in the sun?\"  \"From 'bout ten o'clock till nearly sundown----\"  He moved again and screamed with agony.  The mother tenderly undressed the little, red, swollen body. The rough clothes had stuck to the blistered skin in one place and the pain was so frightful he nearly fainted before they were finally removed.  For two days and nights she never left his side, holding his hand to give him courage when he was compelled to move. Almost his entire body, inch by inch, was blistered. She covered it with cream and allowed only two greased linen cloths to touch him.  On the second day as he lay panting for breath and holding her hand with feverish grasp he looked into her pensive grey eyes through his own bleared and bloodshot with pain and said softly:  \"I'm sorry, Ma.\"  She pressed his hand:  \"It's all right, my Boy; your mother loves you.\"  \"I'm not sorry for the pain,\" he gasped. \"What hurts me worse is that you're so sweet to me!\"  The dark face bent and kissed his trembling lips:  \"It's all for the best. You couldn't have understood the preacher Sunday when he took the text: 'The stars in their courses fought against Sisera.' You learned it for yourself the only way we really learn anything. God's in the wind and rain, the sun, the storm. All nature works with him. You can easily fool your mother. It's not what you seem to others; it's what you are that counts. God sees and knows. You see and know in your little heart. I want you to be a great man--only a good man can ever be great.\"  And so for an hour she poured into his heart her faith in God and His glory until He became the one power fixed"]]]
