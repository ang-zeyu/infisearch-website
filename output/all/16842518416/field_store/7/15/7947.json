His glossy feathers glistened       With dyes as richly red     As any tulip flaming       From out the garden bed.      But ah, unlike the tulips,       In joyous strain, ere long,     This red-bird flower unfolded       A heart of golden song!     WILD BEASTS       I will be a lion       And you shall be a bear,     And each of us will have a den       Beneath a nursery chair;     And you must growl and growl and growl,       And I will roar and roar,     And then--why, then--you'll growl again,       And I will roar some more!     WHEREFORE WINGS?       Heigho, sparrow! Reckless of the rain;       When chill the cheerless wind grows,     Chirping might and main!       Is it naught, then, when the rose                 Blows again?      Beating, sleeting on your draggled coat!       Surely, 'tis enough to drown     Any happy note       Nestling in that downy brown                 Little throat.      Ah me, sparrow! Had I but your power,       Think you in the freezing sleet     I would waste an hour?       --I'd sing my sweetest to a sweet                 Orange flower!     BASKING       Frosty winter chased away       By the blessed sun,     Down upon the garden walks       Basking has begun.      Oh, the happy, happy heat!       How the pulses stir,     How it warms the hearts beneath       Little coats of fur!      Oh, the happy pussy-cats!       Days to doze and doze,     And what pleasant dreams they dream       Only pussy knows.     WITH A MAY-BASKET FOR BABY AGNES                 Peach-buds to meet thee,               Robins to greet thee,     Hey, little Sweetheart! and May morning, hey!               Sunbeam and sing time,               Bluebird and wing time,     This time is kiss time for sweethearts, I say!                Dearest, God bless thee,               Fold and caress thee,     Unto thy cradle may good fairies fly!               Fortune be fair for thee,               This is my prayer for thee,     Lullaby, little one, hush-a-by-bye!                So for a love now               Token thereof now,     Sweet, see this tiny May-basket I bring;               Posies to play with,               Pinks to be gay with,     Dear little baby of sunshine and spring!     THE LITTLE NEST       A little picture haunts me;       It comes and comes again;     It is a tiny bird's-nest,       All ragged from the rain.      It clings within a birch-tree       Upon the moorland's edge,     Between the barren branches,       Above the swaying sedge.      The sky is gray behind it,       And when the north winds blow,     The birch-tree bends and shivers,       And tosses to and fro.      I wonder, does it haunt them,       The birds that flew away?     And will they come to seek it,       Some sunny summer day?      I wonder, does some redbreast       Upon an orange-bough,     Still picture it as plainly       As I can see it now?      Ah me! I would forget it,       Yet still, with sense of pain,     I see this little bird's-nest       Within the driving rain.     CHRISTMAS CANDLES       When the Christ-child comes again       Softly down the street to-night,     Twinkling through the window pane       Let our candles shed their light.      Though the clouds are dark above       And the golden stars are dim,     We can tell Him of our love       If we set a light for Him.      Oh, the blessed Christ-child dear,       In His robe of shining white,     Let our candles give Him cheer       As He passes by to-night!     A SONG OF THE CHRISTMAS-TREE  [Illustration: CHRISTMAS CANDLES]      We can tell Him of our love       If we set a light for Him.       Hurrah! Hurrah! for the Christmas-tree     With its glory and glitter and mystery!     Its twinkling candles that bud and bloom     Like strange bright flowers in the darkened room,     Its glistening gold and silver balls,     Its candy canes and its blue-eyed dolls,     The sugary fruits it bears,--for oh,     Where else do such wonderful sweetmeats grow?--     Its tasseled horns and its pop-corn strings     And all its myriad marvelous things!                 O-ho! and ah-ha!                   And a hip hurrah!     For our dear and beautiful tree, because     It grew in the gardens of Santa Claus      And he brought it here in his reindeer sleigh     From ever and ever so far away!       _So, children, come, let us make a ring       And all clasp hands as we dance and sing       To the blessed tree and the blessed night       When the Christ-child walks in the candles' light!_      Hurrah! Hurrah! for the Christmas-tree     That Santa Claus brought to you and me!     He cut it down with a silver axe--     There's a tree in each of his million packs!--     And carried it safely over the snow     And down our chimney and here, you know;     Its golden cobwebs that glint and gleam     He took from a lovely Christmas dream     And tangled them over it till, behold,     It shines like the fabled Fleece of Gold!                  Oh, Santa Claus, here's                   A thrice three cheers     For garlands green and berries of red,     And mistletoe clustering overhead,     For the joy of our Christmas festival!     But our beautiful tree, it is best of all!       _And circling still in a merry ring       We'll still clasp hands as we dance and sing       To the blessed tree and the blessed night       When the Christ-child walks in the candles' light!_      Hurrah! Hurrah! for the Christmas-tree!     And look, O look to its tip and see     The feathery slim fir leaves and where,     In the topmost boughs, is the image fair     Of the Christ-child nestling amid the green     And the little brown cones that peep between!      And high above Him glittering bright     A gold star sparkles with golden light,     And we children think, as we gaze on them,     Of the wonderful Star of Bethlehem,                 Of the lovely Star                   And the Kings who far,     Oh, far, came seeking a Babe and brought     Their love and worship to Him they sought,     And made Him gifts, as the gifts we make     With loving hearts for that Baby's sake.       _Oh, come, come all, and join the ring!       Let all clasp hands as we dance and sing       To the blessed tree and the blessed night       When the Christ-child walks in the candles' light!_     OUR KITTENS       Our kittens have the softest fur,     And the sweetest little purr,     And such little velvet paws     With such cunning little claws,     And blue eyes, just like the sky!     (_Must_ they turn green, by and by?)     Two are striped like tigers, three     Are as black as black can be,     And they run so fast and play     With their tails, and are so gay,     Is it not a pity that     Each must grow into a cat?     IN JULY       Let us find a shady wady       Pretty little brook;     Let us have some candy handy,       And a picture-book.      There all day we'll stay and play and       Never mind the heat,     While the water gleaming, streaming,       Ripples round our feet.      And we'll gather curly pearly       Mussel-shells while bright     Frightened minnows darting, parting,       Scurry out of sight.      What if, what if,--heigho! my oh!--       All the \"ifs\" were true,     And the little fishes wishes,       Now, what would you do?     A VALENTINE TO A LITTLE CHILD       Dear heart, on this thrice-blessed day,       An thou my sweetheart be,     The rose of love shall bide alway       Upon the red-rose tree.      And in the garden of my heart       So ceaselessly shall shine,     The little birds will know thou art       Mine own true Valentine.      And I will bid them wing and sing       To all good winds that blow,     That to thy little feet they bring       All blessings, even so.      And o'er thy cradle I will coax,       By every lucky charm,     The friendship of the fairy folks       To fold thee from all harm.      So may they hover round thy head       And gently thereupon,     As doth the April sunshine, shed       Most gracious benison.      And all fair gifts that Fortune hath,       I'll pray she promise these,     And that she loose about thy path       All sweet influences.      Then here's a kiss! and there's a kiss!       And kisses, one, two, three!     I seal them in the folds of this,       And speed them unto thee!     ZIP!       When we went to drive the cows home       Down the lane to-day,     There was such a funny bunny       Jumped across the way!      All we saw as he ran past us,       Faster than a quail,     Was his snow-white fuzzy-wuzzy       Little cotton tail!     A LITTLE CAROL       Welcome, little Brother!       Lowly, holy One!     Hail thee, Virgin Mother,     More than any other       Blessed in thy Son!      Child, since the poor manger       Once thou didst not scorn,     Rest thee, little Stranger,     Folded from all danger,       In our hearts new-born!      Nestle thus, we pray thee,       In our love's caress;     Fain we are to pay thee     Worship, and obey thee,       Babe, and Prince no less!     SONG       Honey-dew drippity-drops for a feast,     Dreams of delight when the feasting has ceased,                 Poppy and rose,                 Drain them and doze;     This is a song that the butterfly knows.     THE THREE CANDLES       When the Christmas-tide drew nigh,     On a shelf three candles bright,     Two were red and one was white,     Waited for who came to buy.      Said the first one, \"I shall be     Chosen for a Christmas-tree!\"     Said the second, \"I shall light     Christ Jesus on His way to-night!\"     Then the third one sighed, \"Ah me,     I know not what my lot will be!\"      When the dark fell, bright and gay     The first candle burned away,     Red as all the berries red     On the holly overhead,     While the children in their glee     Danced around the Christmas-tree.      And the second, twinkling bright,     Poured forth all"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19389"],["title","Child Songs of Cheer (#5)"],["body"," golden light     Through a window decked with green     Garlands and red ribbons' sheen,     So the Christ-child when He came     Might be guided by its flame.      But the third one in the gloom     Of a bare and cheerless room     Softly burned where long had lain     A poor little child in pain,     And the baby in its bed     By the light was comforted.      When the Christ-child passed that night     All three candles gave Him light,     But the brightest was the spark     By the baby in the dark."]]]
