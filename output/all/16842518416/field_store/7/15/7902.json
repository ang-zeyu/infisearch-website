Indeed she knew as well as I did that it was not merely because I was an orphan that I wept, as I thought of my early childhood. We could not speak of it, but she knew enough to guess at what was passing through my mind. I was only six years old when my mother died, but I can remember her. I can remember her brief appearances in the room where I played, in much dirt and contentment, at my Ayah's feet--rustling in silks and satins, glittering with costly ornaments, beautiful and scented, like a fairy dream. I would forego all these visions for one--only one--memory of her praying by my bedside, or teaching me at her knee. But she was so young, and so pretty! And yet, O Mother, Mother! better than all the triumphs of your loveliness in its too short prime would it have been to have left a memory of your beautiful face with some devout or earnest look upon it--\"as it had been the face of an angel\"--to your only child.  As I sit thinking thus, I find Eleanor's dark eyes gazing at me from her place, to which she has gone back; and she says softly, \"Margery, dear Margery, do let us give it up.\" But I would not give it up now, for anything whatever.]  The first six years of my life were spent chiefly with my Ayah. I loved her very dearly. I kissed and fondled her dark cheeks as gladly as if they had been fair and ruddy, and oftener than I touched my mother's, which were like the petals of a china rose. My most intimate friends were of the Ayah's complexion. We had more than one \"bearer\" during those years, to whom I was greatly attached. I spoke more Hindostanee than English. The other day I saw a group of Lascar sailors at the Southampton Station; they had just come off a ship, and were talking rapidly and softly together. I have forgotten the language of my early childhood, but its tones had a familiar sound; those dark bright faces were like the faces of old friends, and my heart beat for a minute, as one is moved by some remembrance of an old home.  When my mother went out for her early ride at daybreak, before the heat of the day came on, Ayah would hold me up at the window to see her start. Sometimes my father would have me brought out, and take me before him on his horse for a few minutes. But my nurse never allowed this if a ready excuse could prevent it. Her care of me was maternal in its tenderness, but she did not keep me tidy enough for me to be presentable off-hand to company.  There was always \"company\" wherever my mother went--gentleman company especially. The gentlemen, in different places, and at different times, were not the same, but they had a common likeness. I used to count them when they rode home with my father and mother, or assembled for any of the many reasons for which \"company\" hung about our homes. I remember that it was an amusement to me to discover, \"there are six to-day,\" or \"five to-day,\" and to tell my Ayah. I was even more minute. I divided them into three classes: \"the little ones, the middle ones, and the old ones.\" The \"little ones\" were the very young men--smooth-cheeked ensigns, etc.; the \"old ones\" were usually colonels, generals, or elderly civilians. From the youngest to the oldest, officers and civilians, they were all very good-natured to me, and I approved of them accordingly.  When callers came, I was often sent into the drawing-room. Great was my dear Ayah's pride when I was dressed in pink silk, my hair being arranged in ringlets round my head, to be shown off to the company. I was proud of myself, and was wont rather to strut than walk into the room upon my best kid shoes. They were pink, to match my frock, and I was not a little vain of them. There were usually some ladies in the room, dressed in rustling finery like my mother, but not like her in the face--never so pretty. There were always plenty of gentlemen of the three degrees, and they used to be very polite to me, and to call me \"little Rosebud,\" and give me sweetmeats. I liked sweetmeats, and I liked flattery, but I had an affection stronger than my fancy for either. I used to look sharply over the assembled men for the face I wanted, and when I had found it I flew to the arms that were stretched out for me. They were my father's.  I remember my mother, but I remember my father better still. I did not see very much of him, but when we were together I think we were both thoroughly happy. I can recall pretty clearly one very happy holiday we spent together. My father got some leave, and took us for a short time to the hills. My clearest memory of his face is as it smiled on me, from under a broad hat, as we made nosegays for Mamma's vases in our beautiful garden, where the fuchsias and geraniums were \"hardy,\" and the sweet-scented verbenas and heliotropes were great bushes, loading the air with perfume.  I have one remembrance of it almost as distinct--the last.     CHAPTER II.  THE CHOLERA SEASON--MY MOTHER GOES AWAY--MY SIXTH BIRTHDAY.   We were living in a bungalow not far from the barracks at X. when the cholera came. It was when I was within a few weeks of six years old. First we heard that it was among the natives, and the matter did not excite much notice. Then it broke out among the men, and the officers talked a good deal about it. The next news was of the death of the Colonel commanding our regiment.  One of my early recollections is of our hearing of this. An ensign of our regiment (one of the \"little ones\") called upon my mother in the evening of the day of the Colonel's death. He was very white, very nervous, very restless. He brought us the news. The Colonel had been ill barely thirty-six hours. He had suffered agonies with wonderful firmness. He was to be buried the next day.  \"He never was afraid of cholera,\" said Mr. Gordon; \"he didn't believe it was infectious; he thought keeping up the men's spirits was everything. But, you see, it isn't nervousness, after all, that does it.\"  \"It goes a long way, Gordon,\" said my father. \"You're young; you've never been through one of these seasons. Don't get fanciful, my good fellow. Come here, and play with Margery.\"  Mr. Gordon laughed.  \"I am a fool, certainly,\" he said. \"Ever since I heard of it, I have fancied a strange, faint kind of smell everywhere, which is absurd enough.\"  \"I will make you a camphor-bag,\" said my mother, \"that ought to overpower any faint smell, and it is a charm against infection.\"  I believe Mr. Gordon was beginning to thank her, but his words ended in a sort of inarticulate groan. He stood on his feet, though not upright, and at last said feebly, \"I beg your pardon, I don't feel quite well.\"  \"You're upset, old fellow; it's quite natural,\" said my father. \"Come and get some brandy, and you shall come back for the camphor.\"  My father led him away, but he did not come back. My father took him to his quarters, and sent the surgeon to him; and my mother took me on her knee, and sat silent for a long time, with the unfinished camphor-bag beside her.  The next day I went to the end of our compound with Ayah, to see the Colonel's funeral pass. The procession seemed endless. The horse he had ridden two days before by my mother's side tossed its head fretfully, as the \"Dead March\" wailed, and the slow tramp of feet poured endlessly on. My mother was looking out from the verandah. As Ayah and I joined her, a native servant, who was bringing something in, said abruptly, \"Gordon Sahib--he dead too.\"  When my father returned from the funeral he found my mother in a panic. Some friends had lately invited her to stay with them, and she was now resolved to go. \"I am sure I shall die if I stay here!\" she cried, and it ended in her going away at once. There was some difficulty as to accommodating me and Ayah, and it was decided that, if necessary, we should follow my mother later.  For my own part, I begged to remain. I had no fear of cholera, and I was anxious to dine with my father on my birthday, as he had promised that I should.  It was on the day before my birthday that one of the surgeons was buried. The man next in rank to the poor Colonel was on leave, and the regiment was commanded by our friend Major Buller, whose little daughters were invited to spend the following evening with me. The Major, my father, and two other officers had been pall-bearers at the funeral. My father came to me on his return. He was slightly chilled, and said he should remain indoors; so I had him all to myself, and we were very happy, though he complained of fatigue, and fell asleep once on the floor with his head in my lap. He was still lying on the floor when Ayah took me to bed. I believe he had been unwell all the day, though I did not know it, and had been taking some of the many specifics against cholera, of which everybody had one or more at that time.  Half-an-hour later he sent for a surgeon, who happened to be dining with Major Buller. The Doctor and the Major came together to our bungalow, and with them two other officers who happened to be of the party, and who were friends of my father. One of them was a particular friend of my own. He was an ensign, a reckless, kind-hearted lad \"in his teens,\" a Mr. Abercrombie, who had good reason to count my father as a friend.  Mr. Abercrombie mingled in some way with my dreams that night, or rather early morning, and when I fairly woke, it was to the end of a discussion betwixt my Ayah, who was crying, and Mr. Abercrombie, in evening dress, whose face bore traces of what looked to me like crying also. I was hastily clothed, and he took me in his arms.  \"Papa wants you, Margery dear,\" he said; and he carried me quickly down the passages in the dim light of the early summer dawn.  Two or three officers, amongst whom I recognized Major Buller, fell back, as we came in, from the bed to which Mr. Abercrombie carried me. My father turned his face eagerly"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19360"],["title","Six to Sixteen: A Story for Girls (#3)"],["body"," me, but I shrank away. That one night of suffering and collapse had changed him so that I did not know him again. At last I was persuaded to go to him, and by his voice and manner recognized him as his feeble fingers played tenderly with mine. And when he said, \"Kiss me, Margery dear,\" I crept up and kissed his forehead, and started to feel it so cold and damp.  \"Be a good girl, Margery dear,\" he whispered; \"be very good to Mamma.\" There was a short silence. Then he said, \"Is the sun rising yet, Buller?\"  \"Just rising, old fellow. Does the light bother you?\"  \"No, thank you; I can't see it. The fact is, I can't see you now. I suppose it's nearly over. GOD'S will be done. You've got the papers, Buller? Arkwright will be kind about it, I'm sure. You'll break it to my wife as well as you can?\"  After another pause he said, \"It's time you fellows went to bed and got some sleep.\"  But no one moved, and there was another silence, which my father broke by saying, \"Buller, where are you? It's quite dark now. Would you say the Lord's Prayer for me, old fellow? Margery dear, put your hands with poor Papa's.\"  \"I've not said my prayers yet,\" said I; \"and you know I ought to say my prayers, for I've been dressed a long time.\"  The Major knelt simply by the bed. The other men, standing, bent their heads, and Mr. Abercrombie, kneeling, buried his face on the end of the bed and sobbed aloud.  Major Buller said the Lord's Prayer. I, believing it to be my duty, said it also, and my father said it with us to the clause \"For Thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory,\" when his voice failed, and I, thinking he had forgotten (for I sometimes forgot in the middle of my most familiar prayers and hymns), helped him--\"Papa dear! _for ever and ever_.\"  Still he was silent, and as I bent over him I heard one long-drawn breath, and then his hands, which were enfolded with mine, fell apart. The sunshine was now beginning to catch objects in the room, and a ray lighted up my father's face, and showed a change that even I could see. An officer standing at the head of the bed saw it also, and said abruptly, \"He's dead, Buller.\" And the Major, starting up, took me in his arms, and carried me away.  I cried and struggled. I had a dim sense of what had happened, mixed with an idea that these men were separating me from my father. I could not be pacified till Mr. Abercrombie held out his arms for me. He was more like a woman, and he was crying as well as I. I went to him and buried my sobs on his shoulder. Mr. George (as I had long called him, from finding his surname hard to utter) carried me into the passage and walked up and down, comforting me.  \"Is Papa really dead?\" I at length found voice to ask.  \"Yes, Margery dear. I'm so sorry.\"  \"Will he go to Abraham's bosom, Mr. George?\"  \"Will he go _where_, Margery?\"  \"To Abraham's bosom, you know, where the poor beggar went that's lying on the steps in my Sunday picture-book, playing with those dear old dogs.\"  Mr. Abercrombie's knowledge of Holy Scripture was, I fear, limited. Possibly my remarks recalled some childish remembrance similar to my own. He said, \"Oh yes, to be sure. Yes, dear.\"  \"Do you think the dogs went with the poor beggar?\" I asked. \"Do you think the angels took them too?\"  \"I don't know,\" said Mr. George. \"I hope they did.\"  There was a pause, and then I asked, in awe-struck tones, \"Will the angels fetch Papa, do you think?\"  Mr. George had evidently decided to follow my theological lead, and he replied, \"Yes, Margery dear.\"  \"Shall you see them?\" I asked.  \"No, no, Margery. I'm not good enough to see angels.\"  \"_I_ think you're very good,\" said I. \"And please be good, Mr. George, and then the angels will fetch you, and perhaps me, and Mamma, and perhaps Ayah, and perhaps Bustle, and perhaps Clive.\" Bustle was Mr. Abercrombie's dog, and Clive was a mastiff, the dog of the regiment, and a personal friend of mine.  \"Very well, Margery dear. And now you must be good too, and you must let me take you to bed, for it's morning now, and I have had no sleep at all.\"  \"Is it to-morrow now?\" I asked; \"because, if it's to-morrow, it's my birthday.\" And I began to cry afresh, because Papa had promised that I should dine with him, and had promised me a present also.  \"I'll give you a birthday present,\" said my long-suffering friend; and he began to unfasten a locket that hung at his watch-chain. It was of Indian gold, with forget-me-nots in turquoise stones upon it. He opened it and pulled out a photograph, which he tore to bits, and then trampled underfoot.  \"There, Margery, there's a locket for you; you can throw it into the fire, or do anything you like with it. And I wish you many happy returns of the day.\" And he finally fastened it round my neck with his Trichinopoli watch-chain, leaving his watch loose in his waistcoat-pocket. The locket and chain pleased me, and I suffered him to carry me to bed. Then, as he was parting from me, I thought of my father again, and asked:  \"Do you think the angels have fetched Papa _now_, Mr. George?\"  \"I think they have, Margery.\"  Whereupon I cried myself to sleep. And this was my sixth birthday.     CHAPTER III.  THE BULLERS--MATILDA TAKES ME UP--WE FALL OUT--MR. GEORGE.   Major Buller took me home to his house after my father's death. My father had left his affairs in his hands, and in those of a friend in England--the Mr. Arkwright he had spoken of. I believe they were both trustees under my mother's marriage settlement.  The Bullers were relations of mine. Mrs. Buller was my mother's cousin. She was a kind-hearted, talkative lady, and good-looking, though no longer very young. She dressed as gaily as my poor mother, though, somehow, not with quite so good an effect. She copied my mother's style, and sometimes wore things exactly similar to hers; but the result was not the same. I have heard Mrs. Minchin say that my mother took a malicious pleasure, at times, in wearing costumes that would have been most trying to beauty less radiant and youthful than hers, for the fun of seeing \"poor Theresa\" appear in a similar garb with less success. But Mrs. Minchin's tales had always a sting in them!  Mrs. Buller received me very kindly. She kissed me, and told me to call her \"Aunt Theresa,\" which I did ever afterwards. Aunt Theresa's daughters and I were like sisters. They showed me their best frocks, and told me exactly all that had been ordered in the parcel that was coming out from England.  \"Don't you have your hair put in papers?\" said Matilda, whose own curls sat stiffly round her head as regularly as the rolls of a lawyer's wig. \"Are your socks like lace? Doesn't your Ayah dress you every afternoon?\"  Matilda \"took me up.\" She was four years older than I was, which entitled her to blend patronage with her affection for me. In the evening of the day on which I went to the Bullers, she took me by the hand, and tossing her curls said, \"I have taken you up, Margery Vandaleur. Mrs. Minchin told Mamma that she has taken the bride up. I heard her say that the bride was a sweet little puss, only so childish. That's just what Mrs. Minchin said. I heard her. And I shall say so of you, too, as I've taken you up. You're a sweet little puss. And of course you're childish, because you're a child,\" adds Miss Matilda, with an air. For had not she begun to write her own age with two figures?  Had I known then as much as I learned afterwards of what it meant to be \"taken up\" by Mrs. Minchin, I might not have thought the comparison a good omen for my friendship with Matilda. To be hotly taken up by Mrs. Minchin meant an equally hot quarrel at no very distant date. The squabble with the bride was not slow to come, but Matilda and I fell out first. I think she was tyrannical, and I know I was peevish. My Ayah spoilt me; I spoke very broken English, and by no means understood all that the Bullers said to me; besides which, I was feverishly unhappy at intervals about my father.  It was two months before Mrs. Minchin found out that her sweet little puss was a deceitful little cat; but at the end of two days I had offended Matilda, and we plunged into a war of words such as children wage when they squabble.  \"I won't show you any more of my dresses,\" said Matilda.  \"I've seen them all,\" I boldly asserted; and the stroke told.  \"You don't know that,\" said Matilda.  \"Yes, I do.\"  \"No, you don't.\"  \"Well, show me the others then.\"  \"No, that I won't.\"  \"I don't care.\"  \"I've got a blue silk coming out from England,\" Matilda continued, \"but you haven't.\"  \"I've got a pink silk here,\" said I, \"and pink shoes.\"  \"Ah, but you can't wear them now your papa's dead,\" said Matilda; \"Mamma says you will have to wear black for twelve months.\"  I am sure Matilda did not mean to be cruel, but this blow cut me deeply. I remember the tide of misery that seemed to flood over my mind, to this day. I was miserable because my father was dead, and I could not go to him for comfort. I was miserable because I was out of temper, and Matilda had had the best of the quarrel. I was miserable--poor little wretch!--because I could not wear my pink silk, now my father was dead. I put my hands to my eyes, and screaming, \"Papa! Papa!\" I rushed out into the verandah.  As I ran out, some one ran in; we struck against each other, and Bustle and I rolled over on to the floor. In a moment more I was in Mr. Abercrombie's arms, and sobbing out my woes to him.  I am sorry to say that he swore rather loudly when he heard what Matilda had said, and I fancy that he lectured her when I had gone to Ayah, for she came to me presently and begged my pardon. Of course we were at once as friendly as before. Many another breach was there between us after that, hastily made and quickly healed. But the bride and Mrs. Minchin never came to terms.  \"Mr. George\" remained my devoted friend. I looked for him as I used to look for my father. The first time I saw him after I came to the Bullers was on the day of my father's"]]]
