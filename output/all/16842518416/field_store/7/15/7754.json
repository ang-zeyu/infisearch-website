He heard the crack of the ball as it hit Graves's glove. Then with swift scrape on hands and breast he was sliding in the dust. He stopped suddenly as if blocked by a stone wall. Something hard struck him on the head. A blinding light within his brain seemed to explode into glittering slivers. A piercing pain shot through him. Then from darkness and a great distance sounded a voice:  \"Ward, I said I'd get you!\"     VII  ANNIHILATION   That incident put Ken out of the practice for three days. He had a bruise over his ear as large as a small apple. Ken did not mind the pain nor the players' remarks that he had a swelled head anyway, but he remembered with slow-gathering wrath Graves's words: \"I said I'd get you!\"  He remembered also Graves's reply to a question put by the coach. \"I was only tagging him. I didn't mean to hurt him.\" That rankled inside Ken. He kept his counsel, however, even evading a sharp query put by Arthurs, and as much as it was possible he avoided the third-baseman.  Hard practice was the order of every day, and most of it was batting. The coach kept at the candidates everlastingly, and always his cry was: \"Toe the plate, left foot a little forward, step into the ball and swing!\" At the bat Ken made favorable progress because the coach was always there behind him with encouraging words; in the field, however, he made a mess of it, and grew steadily worse.  The directors of the Athletic Association had called upon the old varsity to go out and coach the new aspirants for college fame. The varsity had refused. Even the players of preceding years, what few were in or near the city, had declined to help develop Wayne's stripling team. But some of the older graduates, among them several of the athletic directors, appeared on the field. When Arthurs saw them he threw up his hands in rage and despair. That afternoon Ken had three well-meaning but old-fashioned ball-players coach him in the outfield. He had them one at a time, which was all that saved him from utter distraction. One told him to judge a fly by the sound when the ball was hit. Another told him to play in close, and when the ball was batted to turn and run with it. The third said he must play deep and sprint in for the fly. Then each had different ideas as to how batters should be judged, about throwing to bases, about backing up the other fielders. Ken's bewilderment grew greater and greater. He had never heard of things they advocated, and he began to think he did not know anything about the game. And what made his condition of mind border on imbecility was a hurried whisper from Arthurs between innings: \"Peg, don't pay the slightest attention to 'em fat-head grad. coaches.\"  Practice days succeeding that were worse nightmares to Ken Ward than the days he had spent in constant fear of the sophomores. It was a terribly feverish time of batting balls, chasing balls, and of having dinned into his ears thousands of orders, rules of play, talks on college spirit in athletics--all of which conflicted so that it was meaningless to him. During this dark time one ray of light was the fact that Arthurs never spoke a sharp word to him. Ken felt vaguely that he was whirling in some kind of a college athletic chaos, out of which he would presently emerge.  Toward the close of March the weather grew warm, the practice field dried up, and baseball should have been a joy to Ken. But it was not. At times he had a shameful wish to quit the field for good, but he had not the courage to tell the coach. The twenty-fifth, the day scheduled for the game with the disgraced varsity team, loomed closer and closer. Its approach was a fearful thing for Ken. Every day he cast furtive glances down the field to where the varsity held practice. Ken had nothing to say; he was as glum as most of the other candidates, but he had heard gossip in the lecture-rooms, in the halls, on the street, everywhere, and it concerned this game. What would the old varsity do to Arthurs' new team? Curiosity ran as high as the feeling toward the athletic directors. Resentment flowed from every source. Ken somehow got the impression that he was blamable for being a member of the coach's green squad. So Ken Ward fluctuated between two fears, one as bad as the other--that he would not be selected to play, and the other that he would be selected. It made no difference. He would be miserable if not chosen, and if he was--how on earth would he be able to keep his knees from wobbling? Then the awful day dawned.  Coach Arthurs met all his candidates at the cage. He came late, he explained, because he wanted to keep them off the field until time for practice. To-day he appeared more grave than worried, and where the boys expected a severe lecture, he simply said: \"I'll play as many of you as I can. Do your best, that's all. Don't mind what these old players say. They were kids once, though they seem to have forgotten it. Try to learn from them.\"  It was the first time the candidates had been taken upon the regular diamond of Grant Field. Ken had peeped in there once to be impressed by the beautiful level playground, and especially the magnificent turreted grand-stand and the great sweeping stretches of bleachers. Then they had been empty; now, with four thousand noisy students and thousands of other spectators besides, they stunned him. He had never imagined a crowd coming to see the game.  Perhaps Arthurs had not expected it either, for Ken heard him mutter grimly to himself. He ordered practice at once, and called off the names of those he had chosen to start the game. As one in a trance Ken Ward found himself trotting out to right field.  A long-rolling murmur that was half laugh, half taunt, rose from the stands. Then it quickly subsided. From his position Ken looked for the players of the old varsity, but they had not yet come upon the field. Of the few balls batted to Ken in practice he muffed only one, and he was just beginning to feel that he might acquit himself creditably when the coach called the team in. Arthurs had hardly given his new players time enough to warm up, but likewise they had not had time to make any fumbles.  All at once a hoarse roar rose from the stands, then a thundering clatter of thousands of feet as the students greeted the appearance of the old varsity. It was applause that had in it all the feeling of the undergraduates for the championship team, many of whom they considered had been unjustly barred by the directors. Love, loyalty, sympathy, resentment--all pealed up to the skies in that acclaim. It rolled out over the heads of Arthurs' shrinking boys as they huddled together on the bench.  Ken Ward, for one, was flushing and thrilling. In that moment he lost his gloom. He watched the varsity come trotting across the field, a doughty band of baseball warriors. Each wore a sweater with the huge white \"W\" shining like a star. Many of those players had worn that honored varsity letter for three years. It did seem a shame to bar them from this season's team. Ken found himself thinking of the matter from their point of view, and his sympathy was theirs.  More than that, he gloried in the look of them, in the trained, springy strides, in the lithe, erect forms, in the assurance in every move. Every detail of that practice photographed itself upon Ken Ward's memory, and he knew he would never forget.  There was Dale, veteran player, captain and pitcher of the nine, hero of victories over Place and Herne. There was Hogan, catcher for three seasons, a muscular fellow, famed for his snap-throw to the bases and his fiendish chasing of foul flies. There was Hickle, the great first-baseman, whom the professional leagues were trying to get. What a reach he had; how easily he scooped in the ball; low, high, wide, it made no difference to him. There was Canton at second, Hollis at short, Burns at third, who had been picked for the last year's All-American College Team. Then there was Dreer, brightest star of all, the fleet, hard-hitting centre-fielder. This player particularly fascinated Ken. It was a beautiful sight to see him run. The ground seemed to fly behind him. When the ball was hit high he wheeled with his back to the diamond and raced out, suddenly to turn with unerring judgment--and the ball dropped into his hands. On low line hits he showed his fleetness, for he was like a gleam of light in his forward dash; and, however the ball presented, shoulder high, low by his knees, or on a short bound, he caught it. Ken Ward saw with despairing admiration what it meant to be a great outfielder.  Then Arthurs called \"Play ball!\" giving the old varsity the field.  With a violent start Ken Ward came out of his rhapsody. He saw a white ball tossed on the diamond. Dale received it from one of the fielders and took his position in the pitcher's box. The uniform set off his powerful form; there was something surly and grimly determined in his face. He glanced about to his players, as if from long habit, and called out gruffly: \"Get in the game, fellows! No runs for this scrub outfit!\" Then, with long-practised swing, he delivered the ball. It travelled plateward swift as the flight of a white swallow. The umpire called it a strike on Weir; the same on the next pitch; the third was wide. Weir missed the fourth and was out. Raymond followed on the batting list. To-day, as he slowly stepped toward the plate, seemingly smaller and glummer than ever, it was plain he was afraid. The bleachers howled at the little green cap sticking over his ear. Raymond did not swing at the ball; he sort of reached out his bat at the first three pitches, stepping back from the plate each time. The yell that greeted his weak attempt seemed to shrivel him up. Also it had its effect on the youngsters huddling around Arthurs. Graves went up and hit a feeble grounder to Dale and was thrown out at"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19247"],["title","Dotty Dimple's Flyaway (#0)"],["body","Viswanathan, and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net                   [Illustration: \"WHAT FOR YOU LOOK THAT WAY TO ME?\"]                            DOTTY DIMPLE STORIES.

BEGINNING TO REMEMBER.   Katie Clifford was a very bright child. She almost knew enough to keep out of fire and water, but not quite. She looked like other little girls, only so wise,--O, so very wise!--that you couldn't tell her any news about the earth, or the sun, moon, and stars, for she knew all about it \"byfore.\"  Her hair was soft and flying like corn-silk, and when the wind took it you would think it meant to blow it off like a dandelion top. She was so light and breezy, and so little for her age, that her father said \"they must put a cent in her pocket to keep her from flying away;\" so, after that, the family began to call her _Flyaway_. She thought it was her name, and that when people said \"Katie,\" it was a gentle way they had of scolding.  Everybody petted her. Her brother Horace put his heart right under her feet, and she danced over it. Her \"uncle Eddard\" said \"she drove round the world in a little chariot, and all her friends were harnessed to it, only they didn't know it.\"  Her shoulders were very little, but they bore a crushing weight of care. From the time she began to talk, she took upon herself the burden of the whole family. When Mrs. Clifford had a headache, Flyaway was so full of pity that nothing could keep her from climbing upon the sufferer, stroking her face, and saying, \"O, my _dee_ mamma,\" or perhaps breaking the camphor bottle over her nose.  She sat at table in a high chair beside her father, and might have learned good manners if it had not been for the care she felt of Horace. She could scarcely attend to her own little knife and fork, because she was so busy watching her brother. She wished to see for herself that he was sitting straight, and not leaning his elbows on the table. If he made any mistake she cried, \"Hollis!\" in a tone as sweet as a wind-harp, though she meant it to be terribly severe, adding to the effect by shaking the corn-silk on her head in high displeasure. If she could correct him she thought she had done as much good in the family as if she had behaved well herself. He received all rebukes very meekly, with a \"Thank you, little Topknot. What would be done here without you to preserve order?\"  Flyaway could remember as far back as the beginning of the world,--that is to say, she could remember when _her_ world began.  It is strange to think of, but the first thing she really knew for a certainty, she was standing in a yellow chair, in her grandmother Parlin's kitchen! It was as if she had always been asleep till that minute. People did say she had once been a baby, but she could not recollect that, \"it was so MANY years ago.\"  Her mind, you see, had always been as soft as a bag of feathers; and nothing that she did, or that any one else did, made much impression. But now something remarkable was taking place, and she would never forget it.  It was this: she was grinding coffee. How prettily it pattered down on the floor! What did it look like? O, like snuff, that people sneezed with. This was housework. Next thing they would ask her to wash dishes and set the table. She would grow larger and larger, and Gracie would grow littler and littler; and O, how nice it would be when she could do all the work, and Gracie had to sit in mamma's lap and be rocked!  \"Flywer'll do some help,\" said she. \"Flywer'll take 'are of g'amma's things.\"  While she stood musing thus, with a dreamy smile, and turning the handle of the mill as fast as it would go round, somebody sprang at her very unexpectedly. It was Ruth, the kitchen-girl. She seized Katie by the shoulders, carried her through the air, and set her on her feet in the sink.  \"There, little Mischief,\" said she, \"you'll stay there one while! We'll see if we can't put a stop to this coffee-grinding! Why, you're enough to wear out the patience of Job!\"  Katie had often heard about Job; she supposed it was something dreadful, like a lion, or a whale. She looked up at Ruth, and saw her black eyes flashing and the rosy color trembling in her cheeks. Cruel Ruth! She did not know Katie was her best friend, working and helping get dinner as fast as she could. \"Ruthie,\" sobbed she, \"you didn't ask please.\"  \"Well, well, child, I'm in a hurry; and when you set things to flying, you're enough to wear out the patience of Job.\"  Job again.  \"You've said so two times, Ruthie! Now I don't like you tall, tenny rate.\"  This was as harsh language as Katie dared use; but she frowned fearfully, and a tuft of hair, rising from her head like a waterspout, made her look so fierce that Ruth seemed to be frightened, and ran away with her apron up to her face.  The sink was so high that Katie could not get out of it alone,--\"course _indeed_ she couldn't.\"  \"It most makes me 'fraid,\" said she to herself: \"Ruthie's a big woman, I's a little woman. When I's the biggest I'll put Ruthie in _my_ sink.\"  Very much comforted by this resolve, she dried her eyes and began to look about her for more housework. \"Let's me see; I'll pump a bushel o' water.\"  There was a pail in the sink; so, what should she do but jump into that, and then jerk the pump-handle up and down, till a fine stream poured out and sprinkled her all over!  \"Sing a song, O sink-spout,\" sang she, catching her breath: but presently she began to feel cold.  \"O, how it makes me _shivvle_!\" said she.  \"Katie!\" called out a voice.  \"Here me are!\" gurgled the little one, her mouth under the pump-nose.  When Horace came in she was standing in water up to the tops of her long white stockings. He took her out, wrung her a little, and set her on a shelf in the pantry to dry.  \"Oho!\" said she, shaking her wet plumage, like a duckling; \"what for you look that way to me? I didn't do nuffin,--not the leastest nuffin! The water kep' a comin' and a comin'.\"  \"Yes, you little naughty girl, and you kept pumping and pumping.\"  \"I'm isn't little naughty goorl,\" thought Katie, indignantly; \"but Ruthie's naughty goorl, and Hollis _velly_ naughty goorl.\"  \"O, here you are, you little Hop-o'-my-thumb,\" said Mrs. Clifford, coming into the pantry; \"a baby with a cough in her throat and pills in her pocket musn't get wet.\"  Flyaway thrust her hand into her wet pocket to make sure the wee vial of white dots was still there.  \"I fished her out of a pail of water,\" said Horace; \"to-morrow I shall find her in a bird's nest.\"  Mrs. Clifford sent for some fresh stockings and shoes. Her baby-daughter was so often falling into mischief that she thought very little about it. She did not know this was a remarkable occasion, and the baby had to-day begun to remember. She did not know that if Flyaway should live to be an old lady, she would sometimes say to her grandchildren,--  \"The very first thing I have any recollection of, dears, is grinding coffee in your great-grandmamma's kitchen at Willowbrook. The girl, Ruth Dillon, took me up by the shoulders, carried me through the air, and set me in the sink, and then I pumped water over myself.\"  This is about the way little Flyaway would be likely to talk, sixty years from now, adding, as she polished her spectacles,--  \"And after that, children, things went into a mist, and I don't remember anything else that happened for some time.\"  Why was it that things \"went into a mist\"? Why didn't she keep on remembering every day? I don't know.  But the next thing that really did happen to Miss Thistleblow Flyaway, though she went right off and forgot it, was this: She persuaded her mother to write a letter for her to \"Dotty Dimpwill.\" As it was her first letter, I will copy it.       \"MY DEAR DOTTY DIMPWILL first, then MY PRUDY:       \"I'm going to say that I dink milk, and that girl lost my      pills.       \"I see a hop-toad. He hopped. Jennie took _her_ up in _his_      dress.       \"And 'bout we put hop-toad in wash-dish. He put his foots      out, _stwetched_, honest! He was a slippy fellow. First      thing we knowed it, he hopped on to her dress. Isn't that      funny?       \"Now 'bout the chickens; they are trottin' round on the      grass: they didn't be dead. _We_ haven't got any only but      dead ones; but Mis' Gray has.       \"I like Dr. Gray ever so much!       \"Mis' Gray gave me the kitty to play with. I bundled it all      up in my dress, 'cause I didn't want the cat to get it. When      I went home I gave it to the cat. [You got that _wroten_?]       \"There wasn't any _dead_ little kittens. She gave me a      cookie, and I eated it, and I told her to give me another to      bring home, 'cause I liked her cookies; they was curly      cookies. [Got it wroted, mamma?]       \"Now 'bout I pumped full a pail full o' water.       \"[She _knows_ we've got a house?]       \"Now say good by, and I kiss her a pretty little kiss. O,      no; I want her to come and see me,--her and Prudy,--_two_      of 'em! I's here yet. ['Haps she knows it!]       \"That's all--I feel sleepy.       (Signed) \"From       "]]]
