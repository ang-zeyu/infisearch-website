The pregnancy and significance of each of these tiny musical \"words\" (or figures, as we are to call them),--small and apparently imperfect as they are,--can best be tested by concentrating the attention upon each as if it stood alone upon the page; it is such vitality of the separate particles that invests a musical masterwork with its power and permanency of interest.        *      *      *      *      *      *  DEFINING THE FIGURES.--It is not always easy to distinguish the figures in a melodic sentence.  While they are unquestionably analogous to the words in speech, they are by no means as concrete, nor are they separated as distinctly, as the words upon a written or printed sheet. This is in keeping with the intangible quality of music, and the peculiar vagueness of its medium of expression; the quality which veils its intrinsic purport from the mass of music admirers, and lends it such exquisite and inexplicable charm to all hearers alike.  In a word, it is not the common practice for a composer to cut up his melodic sentences into separately recognizable small particles, by distinctly marking each component _figure_.  Here and there it is done, by way of contrast, or emphasis, or for a definite rhythmic effect,--as shown in Ex. 2 and Ex. 6.  But more generally the figures are so closely interlinked that the whole sentence may impress the hearer as one coherent strain, with an occasional interruption.  The very minute \"breaks\" between figures are often nearly or quite imperceptible; and in many cases it is possible to define the figures of a motive in various, equally plausible ways, simply because the \"breaks\" (which are of course surely present, and become more and more apparent between the larger members of a composition) are likely to be too inconsiderable among these, smallest factors of the melodic form.  The following three guides may serve to indicate the extremities of the melodic figures:--  (1) A brief rest, or a longer tone, usually marks the end of a figure. This is fully illustrated in Ex. 6.  See also Ex. 10, Ex. 12.  (2) Similarity of formation (rhythm and melodic direction) almost invariably defines the mutually opposed, and therefore separable, divisions of the melody,--both small and large.  For example (the figures are bracketed _a_):--  [Illustration: Example 7.  Fragments of Czerny, Mendelssohn, and Schumann.]  See also Ex. 1.  The operation of this exceedingly important rule of \"corresponding formation\" (about which more will be said later on) is seen--on a larger scale--in Ex. 2, Ex. 5, and Ex. 6, where it defines the whole _motive_.  (3) In default of more definite signs, the figures may be found to correspond to the metric groups (that is, in lengths of whole or half measures).  Thus:--  [Illustration: Example 8.  Fragments of Beethoven.]  This example illustrates the interlinking of the figures, and suggests the difficulty that may be encountered in the effort to define melodic figures.  The difficulty is probably greatest in melodies of a lyric character, where it is necessary to sustain the coherency of the sentence; for instance, in many of the Songs Without Words,--see No. 40, No. 22, and others, in which an entirely definite separation of the figures is well-nigh a hopeless task.  For this reason,--that is, because the melodic divisions are so minute and vague between these smaller particles of the musical sentence,--it is advisable _to give no heed to any factor smaller than the \"motive,\"_ and to undertake the analysis of nothing less than the latter; for even the most scrupulous \"phrasing,\" in the playing of a composition, must avoid the risk of incoherency almost certain to result from distinctly separating all the figures.  The melodies in Ex. 8 should not betray the secret of their formation.   THE MELODIC MOTIVE OR PHRASE-MEMBER.--This, as has already been stated, is a somewhat longer section, compounded of two or more figures.  Being thus longer, the \"breaks\" or spaces between motives are generally more emphatic and recognizable than those between the figures, and therefore it is easier, as a rule, to define the extremities of motives.  Melodic motives differ in length from one to four measures; by far the most common extent, however, is two measures, and the student will do wisely to accept this dimension and analyze accordingly, unless there is unmistakable evidence to the contrary.  The indications are precisely the same as those illustrated in the preceding two examples as guides for the definition of figures.  For example:--  [Illustration: Example 9.  Fragments of Beethoven, Mendelssohn, and Mozart.]  In the first of these examples the extent of the motives is proven by each of the three given guides: the rest, which marks the end of the first member; the similarity of melodic and rhythmic formation, which proclaims the beginning of the second member, parallel with that of the first; and the regular (two-measure) dimension.  In Nos. 2 and 3 there are no rests between the motives, and the melodic formation differs; here it is the standard of two measures that defines the members.  Ex. 3 is a two-measure motive.  In Exs. 2, 5, and 6, the motives are all two measures in length.  In the following:--  [Illustration: Example 10.  Fragment of Beethoven.]  one is tempted to call each _single_ measure a motive, because of the number of tones it contains, and the weight (length) of the final tone, which makes a much more emphatic interruption than commonly occurs between figures.  And in the following, on the other hand:--  [Illustration: Example 11.  Fragment of Beethoven.]  the entire four-measure sentence is evidently one motive, for there is no recognizable indication of an interruption at any point.  The same is true of the two melodies given in Ex. 8.  The following illustrates an irregular (uneven) association of members:--  [Illustration: Example 12.  Fragment of Mozart.]  Here again, there may be a disposition to adopt the upper line of brackets, assigning a single measure to each motive.  But both here, _and in Ex. 10_, the student is advised to adhere to the two-measure standard; he will avoid much needless confusion by so doing,--at least until he shall have so developed and sharpened his sense of melodic syntax that he can apprehend the finer shades of distinction in the \"motion and repose\" of a melody.  Adopting the lower line of brackets, we discover successive members of unequal length, the first one containing two, the next one three measures.   PRELIMINARY TONES.--It is a singularly effective and pregnant quality of the element of musical rhythm, that its operations are not bounded by the vertical bars which mark off the measures.  That is to say, a rhythmic figure (and, in consequence, a melodic figure or motive) does not necessarily extend from bar to bar, but may run from the middle (or any other point) of one measure, to the middle (or corresponding point) of the next; precisely as prosodic rhythm comprises poetic feet which begin either with an accented or with an unaccented syllable.  See Ex. 10.  Hence the significant rule, _that a melodic member may begin at any part of a measure_, upon an accented or an unaccented beat, or upon any fraction of a beat.  For example:--  [Illustration: Example 13.  Fragments of Mendelssohn.]  [Illustration: Example 13 continued.  Fragments of Mendelssohn and Mozart.]   In No. 1, the motive begins squarely with the measure, upon the accented beat.  In No. 2, the same motive is enlarged by two tones at the outset, which locates its beginning upon the fourth 8th--the second half of the second beat.  In No. 3 the motive begins upon an accented beat, but it is the lighter (secondary) accent of the 3d beat.  The various conditions of unaccented beginnings in Nos. 4, 5 and 6 are easily recognizable.  In No. 7 quite a large fraction of a measure precedes the first accent (at the beginning of the full measure). Examine, also, all the preceding examples, and note the different accented or unaccented locations of the first tone, in each figure and motive.  When a figure or motive starts at the accented beat, it begins, so to speak, in the right place; _any tone or tones which precede the accent are merely preliminary or introductory tones_.  While they are very desirable and necessary, in the fulfilment of certain purposes, they are not an _essential_ part of the motive; they appear to represent the ornamental rather than the stable element of the melodic sentence, and their employment is therefore a matter of option and taste rather than of absolute necessity.  The accent indicates the point where the body of the motive begins; the accent is the point where the stake is driven; all that goes before is simply preparatory,--the changeable material which flutters about the fixed center.  Therefore the preliminary tones do not indicate the _essential_ or actual beginning of the motive, but its apparent or conditional beginning only; or what might be called its _melodic_ beginning.  For this reason, also, the actual \"first measure\" of a motive or phrase or sentence of any kind is always the first FULL measure,--the measure which contains the first primary accent; that is to say, the preliminary tone or tones do not count as first measure.  For this reason, further, it is evident that preliminary tones are invariably to be regarded as borrowed from the final measure of the preceding motive or phrase; they must be accounted for in someway,--must derive their metric pulse from some group,--and as they cannot be a part of the first measure, they obviously form a borrowed portion of the (preceding) last measure.  This will be better understood by reference to Ex. 14, No. 3; the two 16ths at the end of the 4th measure (preliminary tones of the following phrase) are borrowed from the _f_ which precedes,--the final tone of the first"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19354"],["title","Lessons in Music Form (#5)"],["body",", that would, but for this reduction, have been the full half-note necessary to complete the four measures (like the final _g_).  Perhaps the most striking feature of this rule of preliminary tones is the absolute freedom of its application.   It is _always_ wholly optional with the composer to begin his figure or motive at whatever part of the measure he may elect; at the accent or not; with or without preliminary tones; to borrow beats from the preceding ending or not, as his judgment or taste, or possibly some indirect requirement, may decide.  So valid is this license, that it is by no means unusual to find consecutive members of the same phrase beginning at different points in the measure.  This results, apparently, in motives of irregular, unsymmetric lengths; but no confusion is possible if the student will recollect and apply the rule that the objective point (the heart, so to speak) of each motive is the first primary accent it contains; counting from these points, all irregularities of melodic extent become purely accidental and harmless.  For illustration (the preliminary tones are marked _a_):--  [Illustration: Example 14.  Fragments of Mozart, Beethoven, and Mendelssohn.]  In No. 1, the first motive evidently ends with the longer tone, _g_-sharp.  In No. 2, each one of the four motives differs from the others in length; the sum of them is, however, exactly 24 beats, or 8 measures; hence, each one is _actually_ a two-measure motive, counting from accent to accent.  The upper numbers indicate the _actual, vital_ beginning of each motive.  This very natural, and fairly common, inequality increases the difficulty of analysis somewhat.  A knowledge of the principal chords, and familiarity with their manner of employment in composition, greatly facilitates the task, because the harmonic design furnishes in many cases the only unmistakable clue to the extremities of the melodic members.  The difficulty finally vanishes only when the student has learned to appreciate the declamatory quality of all good melody, and can detect its inflections, its pauses; can _feel_ which (and how many) of its tones are coherent and inseparable, and where the points of repose interrupt the current, and thus divulge the sense of the melodic sentence.   LESSON 3.--Analyze the third Song Without Words of Mendelssohn (A major, the so-called Hunting Song); first of all, locate the principal melody,--it is not always the uppermost line of tones; then divide this melody into its melodic motives, marking the \"breaks\" which separate each from the following one; the figures may be noted, also, but only mentally.  No. 35 may also be analyzed in the same manner.     CHAPTER IV.  THE PHRASE.  THE PHRASE.--It is not altogether easy to give a precise definition of the phrase.  Like so many of the factors which enter into the composition of this most abstract, ideal, and intangible of the arts, the phrase demands considerable latitude of treatment, and will not readily submit to strict limitations or absolute technical conditions. Perhaps the most correct definition is, that the term phrase is equivalent to \"sentence,\" and represents the smallest musical section that expresses a _complete_ idea; not necessarily wholly finished, and therefore independent of other adjoining phrases, but at least as complete _in itself_ as is an ordinary brief sentence in grammar, with its subject, predicate, and object.  It should be sufficiently long to establish the sense of tonality, the consciousness of beginning, course, and ending, and should exhibit a certain (though limited) amount of palpable and satisfying melodic and harmonic contents.  For this reason, the Phrase, and nothing smaller, should be regarded as the structural basis of musical form.  The factors defined in the preceding chapter (the figure and motive) are, as a rule, decidedly less than is demanded of a complete phrase, which--as has been intimated--usually consists in the union of two (possibly more) motives,--just as the motive is compounded of figures, and the latter of single tones.  In some, comparatively rare, cases the composer gives a phrase an independent place upon his page, as complete miniature sentence, not directly connected with other phrases.  This may be seen, very plainly, at the beginning (the first four or five measures) of the Songs Without Words, Nos. 28, 41, 35, 3, 4, 16.  Examine each, carefully, and the nature of the phrase in its most definite form will become apparent.  Such independent phrases are most likely to be found, like the above, at the beginning or end of a larger composition, to which they are related indirectly, as isolated introduction, or postlude.  Thus, the following complete phrase appears at the beginning of a song:  [Illustration: Example 15.  Fragment of Schubert.]  Its division into two melodic motives, and the subdivision of these into figures, is plainly marked.  When the phrase assumes such a conspicuous position, and is so complete and definite in its effect as the ones just seen, there is naturally no difficulty in recognizing and defining its extremities.  But the task of phrase analysis is by no means always thus easy.   LENGTH OF THE REGULAR PHRASE.--Fortunately for the work of analysis, there are certain established landmarks of forms, so conscientiously observed, and so firmly grounded in the practices of classic writing (because the necessary consequences of natural law), that it is generally practicable to fix fairly regular and plausible boundaries to the phrase, notwithstanding the freedom and elasticity which characterize the application of the syntactic principle in music.  Therefore the student will find that a phrase, in the great majority of cases, covers exactly _four measures_, and will seldom be misled if he looks for the end of his phrase four measures beyond its beginning. This refers, be it understood, only to measures of average size (in the ordinary time denominations, 3-4, 4-4, 6-8 measure).  If the measures are uncommonly large (9-8, 12-8), the phrase will probably cover no more than two of them; or, if small (2-4, or 3-4 in rapid tempo), the phrase may extend to the eighth measure.  The operation of this four-measure rule is exhibited with striking regularity and persistence in the _Jugend Album_ of Schumann (op. 68); throughout its forty-three numbers there are probably no more than a half-dozen phrases whose length differs from this standard.  For example:  [Illustration: Example 16.  Fragment of Schumann, Op. 68, No. 11.]   It will be observed that the first (and also the third) of these phrases consists of two exactly similar two-measure motives.  This seems to lend some confirmation to the idea of a two-measure phrase; but the student is warned against deviating from his four-measure standard, upon such evidence as this.  Many instances will be found, like these, in which the impression of a complete phrase is not gained until the motive of two measures has been thus repeated; _the repetition is necessary_, in order to finish the sentence, and this proves that the two measures alone do not constitute the \"complete idea\" which we expect the phrase to represent.  The same regularity of dimension will usually be found in all kinds of dance music; in technical exercises (for instance, the études of Czerny and others); and in all music of a simple or popular character.        *       *       *       *       *       *  EXCEPTIONS.--In its ordinary, normal condition the phrase is a musical sentence four measures in length.  But this rule has its necessary exceptions; necessary because, as we have learned, the principle of Variety is quite as vital as that of Unity or symmetry.  The phrase is not always regular; by various means and for various reasons, it occasionally assumes an irregular form.  When such irregular phrases are encountered (phrases of less or more than four measures) the student will best distinguish them by defining their extremities, their beginning and ending--as \"beginning\" and \"ending,\" without reference to their length.  This should not be attended with any serious difficulty; at least not to the observant student who reads his musical page thoughtfully, and attaches some meaning to the figures and motives of the melody; who endeavors to recognize the extent to which the successive tones appear to cling together (like the letters in a word) and constitute an unbroken melodic number,--and, in so doing, also recognizes the points where this continuity is broken, and a new number is announced.  Much assistance may be derived from the fact--striking in its simplicity--that the ending of one phrase defines, at the same time, the beginning of the next, and _vice versa_.  The locating of one, therefore, serves to locate the other.  There is, usually, something sufficiently indicative about a \"beginning,\" to render it noticeable to a careful observer, and the same is true of an \"ending.\" This is illustrated in the following:  [Illustration: Example 17.  Fragments of Beethoven.]   No. 1 is from the pianoforte sonata, op. 10, No. 3, second movement; see the original.  This phrase exhibits an ending, unmistakably, in the _fifth_ measure, and not in the fourth.  Its form is therefore irregular.  In No. 2 (from the first pianoforte sonata), the first phrase ends with the fourth measure, obviously, for the evidence of a new \"beginning\" in the following measure is perfectly clear; the phrase is therefore regular.  But the next phrase runs on to the _sixth_ measure from this point (the tenth from the beginning of the whole), because there is no earlier evidence of an \"ending.\"  Observe that the first phrase has a preliminary quarter-note, the second phrase none.  Turning to Mendelssohn's Songs Without Words, the very first (introductory) phrase of No. 3 is five measures in length; the first one in No. 35 also contains five measures; the first one in No. 16, and in No. 9, contains three measures.
