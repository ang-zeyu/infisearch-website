You wouldn't have us without a friend in the world when the girls come out; and really, what with regimental duties in the morning, and insects afterwards, Edward, you are so absorbed, that if it wasn't for a lady friend coming in now and then, I should hardly have a soul to speak to.\"  The Major was melted in a moment.  \"I am afraid I am a very inattentive husband,\" he said. \"You must forgive me, my dear. And this sprained ankle keeping me in makes me cross, too. And I had so reckoned on these days at home to finish my list of Coleoptera, and get some dissecting and mounting done. But to-day, Mrs. Minchin brought her work directly after breakfast, and that empty-headed fellow Elliott dropped in for lunch, and we had callers all the afternoon, and a _coterie_ for tea, and Mrs. St. John (who seems to get through life somehow without the most indefinite notion of how time passes) came in just when tea was over, and you had to order a fresh supply when we should have been dressing for dinner, and the dinner was spoilt by waiting till she discovered that she had no idea (whoever did know her have an idea?) how late it was, and that Mr. St. John would be so angry. And now you want me to go in a cab to a concert at the Rooms to meet all these people over again!\"  \"I'm sure I don't care for Mrs. St. John a bit more than you do,\" said Mrs. Buller. \"And really she does repeat such things sometimes--without ever looking round to see if the girls are in the room. She told me a thing to-day that old Lady Watford had told her.\"  \"My dear, her ladyship's stories are well known. Cremorne's wife hears them from her, and tells them to her husband, and he tells them to the other fellows. I can always hear them if I wish. But I do not care to. But if you don't like Mrs. St. John, Theresa, what on earth made you ask her to come and sit with you in the morning?\"  \"Well, my dear, what can I do?\" said Mrs. Buller. \"She's always saying that everybody is so unsociable, and that she is so dull, she doesn't know what to do with herself, and begging me to take my work and go and sit with her in a morning. How can I go and leave the children and the servants, just at the time of day when everything wants to be set going? So I thought I'd better ask her to come here instead. It's a great bore, but I can keep an eye over the house, and if any one else drops in I can leave them together. It's not me that she wants, it's something to amuse her.  \"You talk about my having nothing to do,\" Aunt Theresa plaintively continued. \"But I'm sure I can hardly sleep at night sometimes for thinking of all I ought to do and haven't done. Mrs. Jerrold, you know, made me promise faithfully when we were coming away to write to her every mail, and I never find time. Every week, as it comes round, I think I will, and can't. I used to think that one good thing about coming home would be the no more writing for the English mail; but the Indian mail is quite as bad. And I'm sure mail-day seems to come round quicker than any other day of the week. I quite dread Fridays. And then your mother and sisters are always saying I never write. And I heard from Mrs. Pryce Smith only this morning, telling me I owed her two letters; and I don't know what to say to her when I do write, for she knows nobody _here_, and I know nobody _there_. And we've never returned the Ridgeways' call, my dear. And we've never called on the Mercers since we dined there. And Mrs. Kirkshaw is always begging me to drive out and spend the day at the Abbey. I know she is getting offended, I've put her off so often; and Mrs. Minchin says she is very touchy. And Mrs. Taylor looks quite reproachfully at me because I've not been near the Dorcas meetings for so long. But it's all very well for people who have no children to work at these things. A mother's time is not her own, and charity begins at home. I'm sure I never seem to be at rest, and yet people are never satisfied. Lady Burchett says she's certain I am never at home, for she always misses me when she calls; and Mrs. Graham says I never go out, she's sure, for she never meets me anywhere.\"  \"Isn't all that just what I say?\" said Major Buller, laying down his knife and fork. (The discussion took place at dinner.) \"It's the tyranny of the idle over the busy; and why, in the name of common sense, should it be yielded to? Why should friends be obliged, at the peril of disparagement of their affection or good manners, to visit each other when they do not want to go--to receive each other when it is not convenient, and to write to each other when there is nothing to say? You women, my dear, I must say, are more foolish in this respect than men. Men simply won't write long letters to their friends when they've nothing to say, and I don't think their friendships suffer by it. And though there are heaps of idle gossiping fellows, as well as ladies with the same qualities, a man who was busy would never tolerate them to his own inconvenience, much less invite them to persecute him. We are more straightforward with each other, and that is, after all, the firmest foundation for friendship. It is partly a misplaced amiability, a phase of the unselfishness in which you excel us, and partly also, I think, a want of some measuring quality that makes you women exact unreasonable things, make impossible promises, and after blandly undertaking a multiplicity of small matters that would tax the method of a man of business to accomplish punctually, put your whole time at the disposal of every fool who is pleased to waste it.\"  \"It's all very well talking, Edward,\" said Aunt Theresa. \"But what is one to do?\"  \"Make a stand,\" said the Major. \"When you're busy, and can't conveniently see people, let your servant tell them so in as many words. The friendship that can't survive that is hardly worth keeping, I think. Eh, my dear?\"  But I suppose the stand was to be made further on, for Major Buller took Aunt Theresa to the concert at \"the Rooms.\"     CHAPTER VI.  DRESS AND MANNER--I EXAMINE MYSELF--MY GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.   When we began our biographies we resolved that neither of us should read the other's till both were finished. This was partly because we thought it would be more satisfactory to be able to go straight through them, partly as a check on a propensity for beginning things and not finishing them, to which we are liable, and partly from the childish habit of \"saving up the treat for the last,\" as we used--in \"old times\"--to pick the raisins out of the puddings and lay them by for a _bonne bouche_ when we should have done our duty by the more solid portion.  But our resolve has given way. We began by very much wishing to break it, and we have ended by finding excellent reasons for doing so.  We both wish to read the biographies--why should we tease ourselves by sticking obstinately to our first opinion?  No doubt it would be nice to read them \"straight through.\" But we are rather apt to devour books at a pace unfavourable to book-digestion, so perhaps it will be better still to read them by bits, as one reads a thing that \"comes out in numbers.\"  And in short, at this point Eleanor took mine, and has read it, and I have read hers. She lays down mine, saying, \"But, my dear, you don't remember all this?\"  Which is true. What I have recorded of my first English home is more what I know of it from other sources than what I positively remember. And yet I have positive memories of my own about it, too.  I have hinted that my poor young mother did not look after me much. Also that the Ayah, who had a mother's love and care for me, paid very little attention to my being tidy in person or dress, except when I was exhibited to \"company.\"  But my mother was dead. Ayah (after a terrible parting) was left behind in India. And from the time that I passed into Aunt Theresa's charge, matters were quite changed.  I do remember the dresses I had then, and the keen interest I took in the subject of dress at a very early age. A very keen interest was taken in it by Aunt Theresa herself, by Aunt Theresa's daughters, and by the ladies of Aunt Theresa's acquaintance. I think I may say that it formed (at least one of) the principal subjects of conversation during all those working hours of the day which the ladies so freely sacrificed to each other. Mrs. Buller was truly kind, and I am sure that if I had depended in every way upon her, she would have given to my costume as much care as she bestowed upon that of her own daughters. But my parents had not been poor; there was no lack of money for my maintenance, and thus \"no reason,\" as Aunt Theresa said, why my clothes should not be \"decent,\" and \"decent\" with Aunt Theresa and her friends was a synonym for \"fashionable.\"  Thus my first black frock was such an improvement (in fashion) upon the pink silk one, as to deprive my deep mourning of much of its gloom. Mrs. (Colonel) St. Quentin could not refuse to lend one of her youngest little girl's frocks as a copy, for \"the poor little orphan\"; and a bevy of ladies sat in consultation over it, for all Mrs. St. Quentin's things were well worth copying.  \"Keep a paper pattern, dear,\" said Mrs. Minchin; \"it will come in for the girls. Her things are always good.\"  And Mrs. Buller kept a paper pattern.  I remember the dress quite clearly. It is fixed in my mind by an incident connected with it. It had six crape tucks, of which fact I was very proud, having heard a good deal said about it. The first time Mr. George came to our bungalow, after I had begun to wear it, I strutted up to him holding my skirt out, and my head up.  \"Look at my black frock, Mr. George,\" said I; \"it has got six crape tucks.\"  Matilda was most precocious in--at least--one way: she could repeat grown-up observations of wonderful length.  \"It's the best crape,\" she said; \"it won't spot. Cut on the bias. They're not real tucks though, Margery. They're laid on;"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19360"],["title","Six to Sixteen: A Story for Girls (#7)"],["body","rs. Minchin said so.\"  \"They are real tucks,\" I stoutly asserted.  \"No, they're not. They're cut on the bias, and laid on to imitate tucks,\" Matilda repeated. I think she was not sorry there should be some weak point in the fashionable mourning in which she did not share.  I turned to Mr. George, as usual.  \"Aren't they real tucks, Mr. George?\"  But Mr. George had a strange look on his face which puzzled and disconcerted me. He only said, \"Good heavens!\" And all my after efforts were vain to find out what he meant, and why he looked in that strange manner.  Little things that puzzle one in childhood remain long in one's memory. For years I puzzled over that look of Mr. George's, and the remembrance never was a pleasant one. It chilled my enthusiasm for my new dress at the time, and made me feel inclined to cry. I think I have lived to understand it.  But I was not insensible of my great loss, though I took pride in my fashionable mourning. I do not think I much connected the two in my mind. I did not talk about my father to any one but Mr. George, but at night I often lay awake and cried about him. This habit certainly affected my health, and I had become a very thin, weak child when the home voyage came to restore my strength.  By the time we reached Riflebury, my fashionable new dress was neither new nor fashionable. It was then that Mrs. Minchin ferreted out a dressmaker whom Mrs. St. Quentin employed, and I was put under her hands.  The little Bullers' things were \"made in the house,\" after the pattern of mine.  \"And one sees the fashion-book, and gets a few hints,\" said Mrs. Buller.  If Mr. George was not duly impressed by my fashionable mourning, I could (young as I was) trace the effect of Aunt Theresa's care for my appearance on other friends in the regiment. They openly remarked on it, and did not scruple to do so in my hearing. Callers from the neighbourhood patronized me also. Pretty ladies in fashionably pitched bonnets smiled, and said, \"One of your little ones, Mrs. Buller? What a pretty little thing!\" and duly sympathized over the sad story which Aunt Theresa seemed almost to enjoy relating. Sometimes it was agony to me to hear the oft-repeated tale of my parents' death, and then again I enjoyed a sort of gloomy importance which gave me satisfaction. I even rehearsed such scenes in my mind when I was in bed, shedding real tears as (in the person of Aunt Theresa) I related the sad circumstances of my own grief to an imaginary acquaintance; and then, with dry eyes, prolonging the \"fancy\" with compliments and consolations of the most flattering nature. I always took care to fancy some circumstances that led to my being in my best dress on the occasion.  Gentleman company did not haunt my new home as was the case with the Indian one. But now and then officers of the regiment called on Mrs. Buller, and would say, \"Is that poor Vandaleur's child? Dear me! Very interesting little thing;\" and speculate in my hearing on the possibility of my growing up like my mother.  \"'Pon my soul, she _is_ like her!\" said one of the \"middle ones\" one day, examining me through his eyeglass, \"Th' same expressive eyes, you know, and just that graceful gracious little manner poor Mrs. Vandaleur had. By Jove, it was a shocking thing! She was an uncommonly pretty woman.\"  \"You never saw _her_ mother, my good fellow,\" said one of the \"old ones\" who was present. \"She _had_ a graceful gracious manner, if you like, and Mrs. Vandaleur was not to be named in the same day with her. Mrs. Vandaleur knew how to dress, I grant you----\"  \"You may go and play, Margery dear,\" said Aunt Theresa, with kindly delicacy.  The \"old one\" had lowered his voice, but still I could hear what he said, as Mrs. Buller saw.  When my father was not spoken of, my feelings were very little hurt. On this occasion my mind was engaged simply with the question whether I did or did not inherit my mother's graces. I ran to a little looking-glass in the nursery and examined my eyes; but when I tried to make them \"expressive,\" I either frowned so unpleasantly, or stared so absurdly, that I could not flatter myself on the point.  The girls were out; I had nothing to do; the nursery was empty. I walked about, shaking out my skirts, and thinking of my gracious and graceful manner. I felt a pardonable curiosity to see this for myself, and, remembering the big glass in Aunt Theresa's room, I stole out to see if I could make use of it unobserved. But the gentlemen had gone, and I feared that Mrs. Buller might come up-stairs. In a few minutes, however, the door-bell rang, and I heard the sound of a visitor being ushered into the drawing-room.  I seized the chance, and ran to Aunt Theresa's room.  The mirror was \"full length,\" and no one could see me better than I now saw myself. Once more I attempted to make expressive eyes, but the result was not favourable to vanity. Then I drew back to the door, and, advancing upon the mirror with mincing steps, I threw all the grace and graciousness of which I was conscious into my manner, and holding out my hand, said, in a \"company voice,\" \"_Charmed_ to see you, I'm sure!\"  \"_Mais c'est bien drôle!_\" said a soft voice close behind me.  I had not heard the door open, and yet there stood Aunt Theresa on the threshold, and with her a little old lady. The little old lady had a bright, delicately cut face, eyes of whose expressiveness there could be no question, and large grey curls. She wore a large hat, with large bows tied under her chin, and a dark-green satin driving-cloak lined with white and grey fur.  She looked like a fairy godmother, like the ghost of an ancestor--like \"somebody out of a picture.\" She was my great-grandmother.     CHAPTER VII.  MY GREAT-GRANDMOTHER--THE DUCHESS'S CARRIAGE--MRS. O'CONNOR IS CURIOUS.   I was much discomfited. My position was not a dignified one at the best, and in childhood such small shames seem too terrible ever to be outlived. My great-grandmother laughed heartily, and Mrs. Buller, whose sense of humour was small, looked annoyed.  \"What in the world are you doing here, Margery?\" she said.  I had little or no moral courage, and I had not been trained in high principles. If I could have thought of a plausible lie, I fear I should have told it in my dilemma. As it was, I could not; I only put my hand to my burning cheek, and said:  \"Let me see!\"  I must certainly have presented a very comical appearance, but the little old lady's smiles died away, and her eyes filled with tears.  \"It is strange, is it not,\" she said to Aunt Theresa, \"that, after all, I should laugh at this meeting?\"  Then, sitting down on a box by the door, she held out her hands to me, saying:  \"Come, little Margery, there is no sin in practising one's good manners before the mirror. Come and kiss me, dear child; I am your father's father's mother. Is not that to be an old woman? I am your great-grandmother.\"  My great-grandmother's voice was very soft, her cheek was soft, her cloak was soft. I buried my face in the fur, and cried quietly to myself with shame and excitement; she stroking my head, and saying:  \"_Pauvre petite!_--thou an orphan, and I doubly childless! It is thus we meet at last to join our hands across the graves of two generations of those we love!\"  \"It was a dreadful thing!\" said Mrs. Buller, rummaging in her pocket for a clean handkerchief. \"I'm sure I never should forget it, if I lived a thousand years. I never seemed able to realize that they were gone; it was all so sudden.\"  The old lady made no answer, and we all wept in silence.  Aunt Theresa was the first to recover herself, and she insisted on our coming down-stairs. A young regimental surgeon and his wife dropped in to lunch, for which my great-grandmother stayed. We were sitting in the drawing-room afterwards, when \"Mrs. Vandaleur's carriage\" was announced. As my great-grandmother took leave of me, she took off a watch and chain and hung them on my neck. It was a small French watch with an enamelled back of dark blue, on which was the word \"Souvenir\" in small pearls.  \"I gave it to your grandfather long years ago, my child, and he gave it back to me--before he sailed. I would only part with it to his son's child. Farewell, _petite_! Be good, dear child--try to be good. Adieu, Mrs. Buller, and a thousand thanks! Major Buller, I am at your service.\"  Major Buller took the hand she held out to him and led the old lady to the front door, whither we all followed them.  Mrs. Vandaleur's carriage was before the steps. It was a very quaint little box on two wheels, in by no means good repair. It was drawn by a pony, white, old, and shaggy. At the pony's head stood a small boy in decent, but not smart, plain clothes.  \"Put the mat over the wheel to save my dress, Adolphe,\" said the old lady; and as the little boy obeyed her order she stepped nimbly into the carriage, assisted by the Major. \"The silk is old,\" she observed complacently; \"but it is my best, of course, or it would not have been worn to-day,\" and she gave a graceful little bow towards Aunt Theresa; \"and I hope that, with care, it will serve as such for the rest of my life, which cannot be very long.\"  \"If it wears as well as you do, Madam,\" said Major Buller, tucking her in, \"it may; not otherwise.\"  The Surgeon was leaning over the other side of the little cart, and seemed also to be making polite speeches. It recalled the way that men used to hang upon my mother's carriage. The old lady smiled, and made gracious little replies, and meanwhile deliberately took off her kid gloves, folded, and put them into her pocket. She then drew on a pair of old worsted ones.  \"Economy, economy,\" she said, smiling, and giving a hand on each side of her to the two gentlemen. \"May I trouble you for the reins? Many thanks. Farewell, gentlemen! I cannot pretend to fear that my horse will catch cold--his coat is too thick; but you may. Adieu, Mrs. Buller, once more. Farewell, little one, I wish you good-morning,"]]]
