[From the Guardian:]  Dear and valued co-workers:  The community of the Most Great Name in these far-off islands have lost a great leader, a stalwart upholder of the new World Order of Bahá’u’lláh. The influence he has exercised will however continue to live, and the example he has set will inspire the rising generation to perform deeds as great and brilliant as those which will ever remain associated with his name. Our dear friend, Mr. Hyde Dunn, will, from his exalted station intercede on your behalf, and you should, on your part strive to emulate one whom Bahá’í historians will recognise and acclaim as Australia’s spiritual conqueror. I will pray for his dear spiritual children from the depths of my heart.  Your true brother, Shoghi.  The passing of yet another staunch and indefatigible worker, Miss Stevenson, constitutes yet another loss to the believers in that continent. The work which that exemplary pioneer has achieved however is imperishable. Kindly assure her relatives of my deepfelt sympathy.  Sh.      LETTER OF JULY 30TH, 1941   July 30th, 1941  Dear Bahá’í Sister:  The Guardian has instructed me to answer your welcome letter to him of June 20th, with all its good news.  The response your teaching work met with in Brisbane is truly most encouraging and shows a remarkable receptivity on the part of the people of Australia to the Divine Message. Shoghi Effendi hopes that you will be able to undertake many such trips in furtherance of the teaching work and that an increasing number of the friends will do likewise.  Indeed all the news that comes from the Bahá’ís of Australia and New Zealand bears witness to the soundness of their understanding of the teachings, their loyalty and devotion to the Cause and its laws, and the excellence of their faith itself.  The Guardian has recently written a long general letter to the Bahá’ís of the West. Owing to its length and the difficulty of sending a large number of manuscripts abroad at such a time, he has requested the N.S.A. of America to forward it to the other National Spiritual Assemblies. He trusts it will soon reach you.  The news received of the Winter session of the Yerrinbool school was very encouraging. Shoghi Effendi hopes that many of these points of community contact, such as school sessions, teaching conferences—whatever form of activity is most feasible—will be increasingly inaugurated, as they are of vital importance in fostering the work of the Cause.  He most deeply appreciates your own untiring services in promotion of the Faith in all its branches. You may rest assured that he will often pray for you, and he will also pray for the confirmation of those souls whom you and Mrs. Hawthorne attracted during your recent trip.  With Bahá’í love,  Yours in His service, R. Rabbani.  P.S. The Guardian has not yet received the record of Martha’s voice nor photographs of Father Dunn. Will you kindly send one copy of each to him as soon as convenient.  R. R.  [From the Guardian:]  Dear and valued co-workers:  It is indeed thrilling to note the rapidity and soundness with which the flourishing Bahá’í community in that far-off land is establishing the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, is fearlessly proclaiming its truths, upholding its verities and standards, multiplying its institutions, defending its interests, disseminating its literature, and exemplifying its invincible power and spirit. I rejoice, feel proud, and am eternally grateful. I cannot but pray, with redoubled fervour, to Him Who so manifestly guides and sustains you, to increase your numbers, to remove every barrier that obstructs your path, to safeguard your unity, to bless your undertakings and to enable you to demonstrate, afresh and with still greater force, the reality of the faith that animates you in the discharge of your sacred duties. Be assured and persevere.  Shoghi.      LETTER OF DECEMBER 26TH, 1941   Haifa, December 26th, 1941.  Dear Bahá’í Sister:  The Guardian has instructed me to answer your letters dated Sep. 23rd. and Oct. 1st, and to acknowledge the receipt of the manuscript you sent for “Bahá’í World” vol. IX, also the photographs of Father Dunn’s home and his own picture.  Regarding the questions you asked in your letter:  No. 1. Confucius was not a Prophet. It is quite correct to say he is the founder of a moral system and a great reformer.  No. 2. The Buddha was a Manifestation of God, like Christ, but his followers do not possess his authentic writings.  No. 3. Zoroaster was not Abraham; the Muslims, some of them, contend that they were the same, but we believe they were two distinct Prophets. There is a misunderstanding in the reference in “Bahá’í Proofs” to this matter.  No. 4. There are no Prophets, so far, in the same category as Bahá’u’lláh, as He culminates a great cycle begun with Adam.  No. 5. The Greatest Name is the Name of Bahá’u’lláh. “Yá Bahá’u’l-Abhá” is an invocation meaning: “O Thou Glory of Glories”! “Alláh-u-Abhá” is a greeting which means: “God the All-Glorious”. Both refer to Bahá’u’lláh. By Greatest Name is meant that Bahá’u’lláh has appeared in God’s Greatest Name, in other words, that He is the Supreme Manifestation of God.  No. 6. Revelations 3.12, refers to the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh.  No. 7. References in the Bible to “Mt. Paran” and “Paraclete” refer to Muhammad’s Revelation. Deuteronomy 33.2; Genesis 21.21.; Numbers 12.16; Numbers 13.3.; Genesis 17.20 refers to the twelve Imams and in the Revelation of St. John, Chap. 11.; where it mentions two witnesses, it refers to Muhammad and ‘Alí.  No. 8. The statement in the “Gleanings”, p. 64–65, “who out of utter nothingness..” etc., should be taken in a symbolic and not literal sense. It is only to demonstrate the power and greatness of God.  No. 9. The Guardian considers that the gist of what Mrs. Hanford Ford reported can be considered quite correct.  No. 10. The figures 1290 date from the declaration of Muhammad, ten years before His flight to Medina.  No. 11. The intercalary days are specially set aside for hospitality, the giving of gifts, etc. Bahá’u’lláh Himself specified that they be used this way, but gave no explanation for it.  No. 12. The Bahá’í Summer-Schools were originated in America to meet the requirements of the friends. They have been adopted by other Bahá’í communities the world-over, but there is no reason why they should be called “Summer Schools”. There is nothing rigid about the term, it is purely descriptive. The Guardian feels that although you can have the immediate affairs of your Summer-Schools managed by a convenient local assembly, they should remain under the direct supervision of the National Spiritual Assembly as they are national in character and not purely local.  A few days ago Mr. Jim Heggie came to see the Guardian. He was able to visit all the shrines and archives as well. Shoghi Effendi was delighted with him, he found him devoted, full of faith and zeal, and very well read in the teachings. He feels that if this is a sample of the Bahá’í youth of Australia, there is, indeed, a wonderful future ahead of that country!  He will be very pleased to receive the picture of Father Dunn’s grave as soon as it is available.  The Guardian assures you and the members of the National Spiritual Assembly that his prayers are constantly being offered on your behalf. He is so very pleased with the good news he receives of your activities and the spread of the Cause in those distant lands.  Only yesterday he was reading a most heartening and enthusiastic report of the work in Tasmania, which greatly cheered him.  Dark as these days are he feels confident that the Australian and New-Zealand Bahá’ís will continue with unabated devotion to carry on their excellent and exemplary services to the Faith.  His prayers are with them all, and his loving gratitude goes out to you who lead and co-ordinate their activities.  With warm Bahá’í greetings  Yours in the service of the beloved Faith, R. Rabbani.  [From the Guardian:]  Dearly-beloved co-workers:  In these days when perils are increasingly threatening that far-off continent, the most distant outpost of our beloved Faith, my thoughts turn with deepening anxiety, solicitude, and love to those who are so valiantly holding aloft the banner of the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh. I appeal to every one of them, and particularly to the members of the assemblies who safeguard their interests, not to allow any disturbance, suffering, or anxiety to dim the splendour of their faith, to deflect them from their high purpose, to cause any division in their ranks, to interfere with the steady consolidation and expansion of their activities and institutions. I will specially pray that the work they have magnificently initiated, and so marvellously and soundly developed may suffer no setback, but rather continue to develop and yield its destined fruit. Persevere and rest assured.  Your true and grateful brother, Shoghi.      LETTER OF FEB. 23RD, 1942   Haifa, Feb. 23rd, 1942.  Dear Bahá’í Sister:  Your letter, with enclosures, of Nov. 8th reached the Guardian safely, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  His thoughts and prayers are very often with the Australian Bahá’ís in these difficult and dangerous times. They are now facing a much more acute situation than hitherto. But whatever of trial and affliction the immediate future may hold for them, we know that the destiny of mankind is in the firm grasp of Bahá’u’lláh, and that He will guide it to its ultimate and highest goal. This assurance is more precious than life itself, it is our anchor in every difficulty and trial.  The Guardian was very happy to know that the work in Brisbane is progressing, and that the Cause is more and more coming before the public and reaching the attention of prominent people.  He feels the believers must continue to do their utmost to acquaint their fellow-citizens with the teachings, that they may at"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19275"],["title","God Passes By (#0)"],["body","Passes By   by Shoghi Effendi     Edition 1, (September 2006)                                 BAHA’I TERMS OF USE   You have permission to freely make and use copies of the text and any other information (\"Content\") available on this Site including printing, emailing, posting, distributing, copying, downloading, uploading, transmitting, displaying the Content in whole or in part subject to the following:  1.

It will commemorate at once the hundreth anniversary of the inception of the Bábí Dispensation, of the inauguration of the Bahá’í Era, of the commencement of the Bahá’í Cycle, and of the birth of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. The weight of the potentialities with which this Faith, possessing no peer or equal in the world’s spiritual history, and marking the culmination of a universal prophetic cycle, has been endowed, staggers our imagination. The brightness of the millennial glory which it must shed in the fullness of time dazzles our eyes. The magnitude of the shadow which its Author will continue to cast on successive Prophets destined to be raised up after Him eludes our calculation.  Already in the space of less than a century the operation of the mysterious processes generated by its creative spirit has provoked a tumult in human society such as no mind can fathom. Itself undergoing a period of incubation during its primitive age, it has, through the emergence of its slowly-crystallizing system, induced a fermentation in the general life of mankind designed to shake the very foundations of a disordered society, to purify its life-blood, to reorientate and reconstruct its institutions, and shape its final destiny.  To what else can the observant eye or the unprejudiced mind, acquainted with the signs and portents heralding the birth, and accompanying the rise, of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh ascribe this dire, this planetary upheaval, with its attendant destruction, misery and fear, if not to the emergence of His embryonic World Order, which, as He Himself has unequivocally proclaimed, has “deranged the equilibrium of the world and revolutionized mankind’s ordered life”? To what agency, if not to the irresistible diffusion of that world-shaking, world-energizing, world-redeeming spirit, which the Báb has affirmed is “vibrating in the innermost realities of all created things” can the origins of this portentous crisis, incomprehensible to man, and admittedly unprecedented in the annals of the human race, be attributed? In the convulsions of contemporary society, in the frenzied, world-wide ebullitions of men’s thoughts, in the fierce antagonisms inflaming races, creeds and classes, in the shipwreck of nations, in the downfall of kings, in the dismemberment of empires, in the extinction of dynasties, in the collapse of ecclesiastical hierarchies, in the deterioration of time-honored institutions, in the dissolution of ties, secular as well as religious, that had for so long held together the members of the human race—all manifesting themselves with ever-increasing gravity since the outbreak of the first World War that immediately preceded the opening years of the Formative Age of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh—in these we can readily recognize the evidences of the travail of an age that has sustained the impact of His Revelation, that has ignored His summons, and is now laboring to be delivered of its burden, as a direct consequence of the impulse communicated to it by the generative, the purifying, the transmuting influence of His Spirit.  It is my purpose, on the occasion of an anniversary of such profound significance, to attempt in the succeeding pages a survey of the outstanding events of the century that has seen this Spirit burst forth upon the world, as well as the initial stages of its subsequent incarnation in a System that must evolve into an Order designed to embrace the whole of mankind, and capable of fulfilling the high destiny that awaits man on this planet. I shall endeavor to review, in their proper perspective and despite the comparatively brief space of time which separates us from them, the events which the revolution of a hundred years, unique alike in glory and tribulation, has unrolled before our eyes. I shall seek to represent and correlate, in however cursory a manner, those momentous happenings which have insensibly, relentlessly, and under the very eyes of successive generations, perverse, indifferent or hostile, transformed a heterodox and seemingly negligible offshoot of the _Sh_ay_kh_í school of the I_th_ná-‘A_sh_’áríyyih sect of _Sh_í’ah Islám into a world religion whose unnumbered followers are organically and indissolubly united; whose light has overspread the earth as far as Iceland in the North and Magellanes in the South; whose ramifications have spread to no less than sixty countries of the world; whose literature has been translated and disseminated in no less than forty languages; whose endowments in the five continents of the globe, whether local, national or international, already run into several million dollars; whose incorporated elective bodies have secured the official recognition of a number of governments in East and West; whose adherents are recruited from the diversified races and chief religions of mankind; whose representatives are to be found in hundreds of cities in both Persia and the United States of America; to whose verities royalty has publicly and repeatedly testified; whose independent status its enemies, from the ranks of its parent religion and in the leading center of both the Arab and Muslim worlds, have proclaimed and demonstrated; and whose claims have been virtually recognized, entitling it to rank as the fourth religion of a Land in which its world spiritual center has been established, and which is at once the heart of Christendom, the holiest shrine of the Jewish people, and, save Mecca alone, the most sacred spot in Islám.  It is not my purpose—nor does the occasion demand it,—to write a detailed history of the last hundred years of the Bahá’í Faith, nor do I intend to trace the origins of so tremendous a Movement, or to portray the conditions under which it was born, or to examine the character of the religion from which it has sprung, or to arrive at an estimate of the effects which its impact upon the fortunes of mankind has produced. I shall rather content myself with a review of the salient features of its birth and rise, as well as of the initial stages in the establishment of its administrative institutions—institutions which must be regarded as the nucleus and herald of that World Order that must incarnate the soul, execute the laws, and fulfill the purpose of the Faith of God in this day.  Nor will it be my intention to ignore, whilst surveying the panorama which the revolution of a hundred years spreads before our gaze, the swift interweaving of seeming reverses with evident victories, out of which the hand of an inscrutable Providence has chosen to form the pattern of the Faith from its earliest days, or to minimize those disasters that have so often proved themselves to be the prelude to fresh triumphs which have, in turn, stimulated its growth and consolidated its past achievements. Indeed, the history of the first hundred years of its evolution resolves itself into a series of internal"]]]
