A yell arose then in the constricted passageway that seemed to Ken to raise College Hall from its foundation. It terrified him. Like an eel he slipped through reaching arms and darted forward. Ken was heavy and fast on his feet, and with fear lending him wings he made a run through College Hall that would have been a delight to the football coach. For Ken was not dodging any sophomores now. He had played his humiliating part of dodger long enough. He knocked them right and left, and many a surprised Soph he tumbled over. Reaching the farther door, he went through out into the open.  The path before him was clear now, and he made straight for the avenue. It was several hundred yards distant, and he got a good start toward it before the Sophs rolled like a roaring stream from the passage. Ken saw other students running, and also men and boys out on the avenue; but as they could not head him off he kept to his course. On that side of the campus a high, narrow stairway, lined by railings, led up to the sidewalk. When Ken reached it he found the steps covered with ice. He slipped and fell three times in the ascent, while his frantic pursuers gained rapidly.  Ken mounted to the sidewalk, gave vent to a gasp of relief, and, wheeling sharply, he stumbled over two boys carrying a bushel basket of potatoes. When he saw the large, round potatoes a daring inspiration flashed into his mind. Taking the basket from the boys he turned to the head of the stairway.  The bronze-haired Soph was half-way up the steps. His followers, twelve or more, were climbing after him. Then a line of others stretched all the way to College Hall.  With a grim certainty of his mastery of the situation Ken threw a huge potato at his leading pursuer. Fair and square on the bronze head it struck with a sharp crack. Like a tenpin the Soph went down. He plumped into the next two fellows, knocking them off their slippery footing. The three fell helplessly and piled up their comrades in a dense wedge half-way down the steps. If the Sophs had been yelling before, it was strange to note how they were yelling now.  Deliberately Ken fired the heavy missiles. They struck with sodden thuds against the bodies of the struggling sophomores. A poor thrower could not very well have missed that mark, and Ken Ward was remarkably accurate. He had a powerful overhand swing, and the potatoes flew like bullets. One wild-eyed Soph slipped out of the tangle to leap up the steps. Ken, throwing rather low, hit him on the shin. He buckled and dropped down with a blood-curdling yell. Another shook himself loose and faced upward. A better-aimed shot took him in the shoulder. He gave an exhibition of a high and lofty somersault. Then two more started up abreast. The first Ken hit over the eye with a very small potato, which popped like an explosive bullet and flew into bits. As far as effect was concerned a Martini could not have caused a more beautiful fall. Ken landed on the second fellow in the pit of the stomach with a very large potato. There was a sound as of a suddenly struck bass-drum. The Soph crumpled up over the railing, slid down, and fell among his comrades, effectually blocking the stairway.  For the moment Ken had stopped the advance. The sophomores had been checked by one wild freshman. There was scarcely any doubt about Ken's wildness. He had lost his hat; his dishevelled hair stood up like a mane; every time he hurled a potato he yelled. But there was nothing wild about his aim.  All at once he turned his battery on the students gathering below the crush, trying to find a way through the kicking, slipping mass on the narrow stairs. He scattered them as if they had been quail. Some ran out of range. Others dove for cover and tried to dodge. This dodging brought gleeful howls from Ken.  \"Dodge, you Indian!\" yelled Ken, as he threw. And seldom it was that dodging was of any use. Then, coming to the end of his ammunition, he surveyed the battle-field beneath him and, turning, ran across the avenue and down a street. At the corner of the block he looked back. There was one man coming, but he did not look like a student. So Ken slackened his pace and bent his steps toward his boarding-house.  \"By George! I stole those potatoes!\" he exclaimed, presently. \"I wonder how I can make that good.\"  Several times as he turned to look over his shoulder he saw the man he had noticed at first. But that did not trouble him, for he was sure no one else was following him. Ken reached his room exhausted by exertion and excitement. He flung himself upon his bed to rest and calm his mind so that he could think. If he had been in a bad light before, what was his position now? Beyond all reasoning with, however, was the spirit that gloried in his last stand.  \"By George!\" he kept saying. \"I wouldn't have missed that--not for anything. They made my life a nightmare. I'll have to leave college--go somewhere else--but I don't care.\"  Later, after dinner as he sat reading, he heard a door-bell ring, a man's voice, then footsteps in the hall. Some one tapped on his door. Ken felt a strange, cold sensation, which soon passed, and he spoke:  \"Come in.\"  The door opened to admit a short man with little, bright eyes sharp as knives.  \"Hello, Kid,\" he said. Then he leisurely removed his hat and overcoat and laid them on the bed.  Ken's fear of he knew not what changed to amazement. At least his visitor did not belong to the faculty. There was something familiar about the man, yet Ken could not place him.  \"Well up in your studies?\" he asked, cordially. Then he seated himself, put a hand on each knee, and deliberately and curiously studied Ken.  \"Why, yes, pretty well up,\" replied Ken. He did not know how to take the man. There was a kindliness about him which relieved Ken, yet there was also a hard scrutiny that was embarrassing.  \"All by your lonely here,\" he said.  \"It is lonely,\" replied Ken, \"but--but I don't get on very well with the students.\"  \"Small wonder. Most of 'em are crazy.\"  He was unmistakably friendly. Ken kept wondering where he had seen him. Presently the man arose, and, with a wide smile on his face, reached over and grasped Ken's right arm.  \"How's the whip?\"  \"What?\" asked Ken.  \"The wing--your arm, Kid, your arm.\"  \"Oh--Why, it's all right.\"  \"It's not sore--not after peggin' a bushel of potatoes on a cold day?\"  Ken laughed and raised his arm up and down. \"It's weak to-night, but not sore.\"  \"These boys with their India-rubber arms! It's youth, Kid, it's youth. Say, how old are you?\"  \"Sixteen.\"  \"What! No more than that?\"  \"No.\"  \"How much do you weigh?\"  \"About one hundred and fifty-six.\"  \"I thought you had some beef back of that stunt of yours to-day. Say, Kid, it was the funniest and the best thing I've seen at the university in ten years--and I've seen some fresh boys do some stunts, I have. Well... Kid, you've a grand whip--a great arm--and we're goin' to do some stunts with it.\"  Ken felt something keen and significant in the very air.  \"A great arm! For what?... who are you?\"  \"Say, I thought every boy in college knew me. I'm Arthurs.\"  \"The baseball coach! Are you the baseball coach?\" exclaimed Ken, jumping up with his heart in his throat.  \"That's me, my boy; and I'm lookin' you up.\"  Ken suddenly choked with thronging emotions and sat down as limp as a rag.  \"Yes, Kid, I'm after you strong. The way you pegged 'em to-day got me. You've a great arm!\"     III  PRISONER OF THE SOPHS   \"But if--it's really true--that I've a great arm,\" faltered Ken, \"it won't ever do me any good. I could never get on the varsity.\"  \"Why not?\" demanded the coach. \"I'll make a star of a youngster like you, if you'll take coachin'. Why not?\"  \"Oh, you don't know,\" returned Ken, with a long face.  \"Say, you haven't struck me as a kid with no nerve. What's wrong with you?\"  \"It was I who slugged Captain Dale and caused that big rush between the freshmen and sophomores. I've lived like a hermit ever since.\"  \"So it was you who hit Dale. Well--that's bad,\" replied Arthurs. He got up with sober face and began to walk the floor. \"I remember the eye he had. It was a sight.... But Dale's a good fellow. He'll--\"  \"I'd do anything on earth to make up for that,\" burst out Ken.  \"Good! I'll tell you what we'll do,\" said Arthurs, his face brightening. \"We'll go right down to Dale's room now. I'll fix it up with him somehow. The sooner the better. I'm goin' to call the baseball candidates to the cage soon.\"  They put on coats and hats and went out. Evidently the coach was thinking hard, for he had nothing to say, but he kept a reassuring hand on Ken's arm. They crossed the campus along the very path where Ken had fled from the sophomores. The great circle of dormitories loomed up beyond with lights shining in many windows. Arthurs led Ken through a court-yard and into a wide, bright hallway. Their steps sounded with hollow click upon the tiled floor. They climbed three flights of stairs, and then Arthurs knocked at a door. Ken's heart palpitated. It was all so sudden; he did not know what he was going to say or do. He did not care what happened to him if Arthurs could only, somehow, put him right with the captain.  A merry voice bade them enter. The coach opened the door and led Ken across the threshold. Ken felt the glow of a warm, bright room, colorful with pennants and posters, and cozy in its disorder. Then he saw Dale and, behind him, several other students. There was a moment's silence in which Ken heard his heart beat.  Dale rose slowly from his seat, the look on his frank face changing from welcome to intense amazement and then wild elation.  \"Whoop!\" he shouted. \"Lock the door! Worry Arthurs, this's your best bet ever!\"  Dale dashed at the coach, hugged him frantically, then put his head out of the door to bawl: \"Sophs! Sophs! Sophs! Hurry call! Number nine!... Oh, my!\"  Then he faced about, holding the door partially open. He positively beamed upon the coach.  \"Say, Cap, what's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19246"],["title","The Young Pitcher (#3)"],["body","tin' you?\" asked Arthurs. He looked dumfounded. Ken hung to him desperately; he thought he knew what was coming. There were hurried footsteps in the corridor and excited voices.  \"Worry, it's bully of you to bring this freshman here,\" declared the captain.  \"Well, what of it?\" demanded the coach. \"I looked him up to-night. He's got a great arm, and will be good material for the team. He told me about the little scrap you had in the lecture-room. He lost his temper, and no wonder. Anyway, he's sorry, Cap, and I fetched him around to see if you couldn't make it up. How about it, Kid?\"  \"I'm sorry--awfully sorry, Captain Dale,\" blurted out Ken. \"I was mad and scared, too--then you fellows hurt me. So I hit right out.... But I'll take my medicine.\"  \"So--oh!\" ejaculated Dale. \"Well, this beats the deuce! _That's_ why you're here?\"  The door opened wide to admit half a dozen eager-faced youths.  \"Fellows, here's a surprise,\" said Dale. \"Young Ward, the freshman! the elusive slugging freshman, fast on his feet, and, as Worry here says, a lad with a great arm!\"  \"WARD!\" roared the Sophs in unison.  \"Hold on, fellows--wait--no rough-house yet--wait,\" ordered Dale. \"Ward's here of his own free will!\"  Silence ensued after the captain spoke. While he turned to lock the door the Sophs stared open-mouthed at Ken. Arthurs had a worried look, and he kept his hand on Ken. Dale went to a table and began filling his pipe. Then he fixed sharp, thoughtful eyes upon his visitors.  \"Worry, you say you brought this freshman here to talk baseball?\" he asked.  \"Sure I did,\" blustered Arthurs. It was plain now where he got the name that Dale called him. \"What's in the wind, anyhow?\"  Dale then gravely spoke to Ken. \"So you came here to see me? Sorry you slugged me once? Want to make up for it somehow, because you think you've a chance for the team, and don't want me to be sore on you? That it?\"  \"Not exactly,\" replied Ken. \"I'd want to let you get square with me even if you weren't the varsity captain.\"  \"Well, you've more than squared yourself with me--by coming here. You'll realize that presently. But don't you know what's happened, what the freshmen have done?\"  \"No; I don't.\"  \"You haven't been near the university since this afternoon when you pulled off the potato stunt?\"  \"I should say I haven't.\"  This brought a laugh from the Sophs.  \"You were pretty wise,\" went on Dale. \"The Sophs didn't love you then. But they're going to--understand?\"  Ken shook his head, too bewildered and mystified to reply.  \"Well, now, here's Giraffe Boswick. Look what you did to him!\"  Ken's glance followed the wave of Dale's hand and took in the tall, bronze-haired sophomore who had led the chase that afternoon. Boswick wore a huge discolored bruise over his left eye. It was hideous. Ken was further sickened to recollect that Boswick was one of the varsity pitchers. But the fellow was smiling amiably at Ken, as amiably as one eye would permit. The plot thickened about Ken. He felt his legs trembling under him.  \"Boswick, you forgive Ward, don't you--now?\" continued Dale, with a smile.  \"With all my heart!\" exclaimed the pitcher. \"To see him here would make me forgive anything.\"  Coach Arthurs was ill at ease. He evidently knew students, and he did not relish the mystery, the hidden meaning.  \"Say, you wise guys make me sick,\" he called out, gruffly. \"Here's a kid that comes right among you. He's on the level, and more'n that, he's game! Now, Cap, I fetched him here, and I won't stand for a whole lot. Get up on your toes! Get it over!\"  \"Sit down Worry, here's a cigar--light up,\" said Dale, soothingly. \"It's all coming right, lovely, I say. Ward was game to hunt me up, a thousand times gamer than he knows.... See here, Ward, where are you from?\"  \"I live a good long day's travel from the university,\" answered Ken, evasively.  \"I thought so. Did you ever hear of the bowl-fight, the great event of the year here at Wayne University?\"  \"Yes, I've heard--read a little about it. But I don't know what it is.\"  \"I'll tell you,\" went on Dale. \"There are a number of yearly rushes and scrapes between the freshmen and sophomores, but the bowl-fight is the one big meeting, the time-honored event. It has been celebrated here for many years. It takes place on a fixed date. Briefly, here's what comes off: The freshmen have the bowl in their keeping this year because they won it in the last fight. They are to select one of their number, always a scrappy fellow, and one honored by the class, and they call him the bowl-man. A week before the fight, on a certain date, the freshmen hide this bowl-man or protect him from the sophomores until the day of the fight, when they all march to Grant field in fighting-togs. Should the sophomores chance to find him and hold him prisoner until after the date of the bowl-fight they win the bowl. The same applies also in case the bowl is in possession of the sophomores. But for ten years neither class has captured the other's bowl-man. So they have fought it out on the field until the bowl was won.\"  \"Well, what has all that got to do with me?\" asked Ken. He felt curiously light-headed.  \"It has a _little_ to do with you--hasn't it, fellows?\" said Dale, in slow, tantalizing voice.  Worry Arthurs lost his worried look and began to smile and rub his hands.  \"Ward, look here,\" added Dale, now speaking sharply. \"You've been picked for the bowl-man!\"  \"Me--me?\" stammered Ken.  \"No other. The freshmen were late in choosing a man this year. To-day, after your stunt--holding up that bunch of sophomores--they had a meeting in Carlton Club and picked you. Most of them didn't even know your name. I'll bet the whole freshman class is hunting for you right now.\"  \"What for?\" queried Ken, weakly.  \"Why, I told you. The bowl-fight is only a week off--and here you are. _And here you'll stay until that date's past!_\"  Ken drew a quick breath. He began to comprehend. The sudden huzzahs of Dale's companions gave him further enlightenment.  \"But, Captain Dale,\" he said, breathlessly, \"if it's so--if my class has picked me--I can't throw them down. I don't know a soul in my class. I haven't a friend. But I won't throw them down--not to be forever free of dodging Sophs--not even to square myself with you.\"  \"Ward, you're all right!\" shouted Dale, his eyes shining.  In the quiet moment that followed, with all the sophomores watching him intently, Ken Ward instinctively felt that his measure had been taken.  \"I won't stay here,\" said Ken, and for the first time his voice rang.  \"Oh yes, you will,\" replied Dale, laughing.  Quick as a cat Ken leaped for the door and got it unlocked and half open before some one clutched him. Then Dale was on him close and hard. Ken began to struggle. He was all muscle, and twice he broke from them.  \"His legs! Grab his legs! He's a young bull!\"  \"We'll trim you now, Freshie!\"  \"You potato-masher!\"  \"Go for his wind!\"  Fighting and wrestling with all his might Ken went down under a half dozen sophomores. Then Dale was astride his chest, and others were sitting on his hands and feet.  \"Boys, don't hurt that arm!\" yelled Worry Arthurs.  \"Ward, will you be good now and stop scrapping or shall we tie you?\" asked Dale. \"You can't get away. The thing to do is to give your word not to try. We want to make this easy for you. Your word of honor, now?\"  \"Never!\" cried Ken.  \"I knew you wouldn't,\" said Dale. \"We'll have to keep you under guard.\"  They let him get up. He was panting, and his nose was bleeding, and one of his knuckles was skinned. That short struggle had been no joke. The Sophs certainly meant to keep him prisoner. Still, he was made to feel at ease. They could not do enough for him.  \"It's tough luck, Ward, that you should have fallen into our hands this way,\" said Dale. \"But you couldn't help it. You will be kept in my rooms until after the fifteenth. Meals will be brought you, and your books; everything will be done for your comfort. Your whereabouts, of course, will be a secret, and you will be closely watched. Worry, remember you are bound to silence. And Ward, perhaps it wasn't an ill wind that blew you here. You've had your last scrap with a Soph, that's sure. As for what brought you here--it's more than square; and I'll say this: if you can play ball as well as you can scrap, old Wayne has got a star.\"     IV  THE CALL FOR CANDIDATES   There were five rooms in Dale's suite in the dormitory, and three other sophomores shared them with him. They confined Ken in the end room, where he was safely locked and guarded from any possible chance to escape.  For the first day or two it was irksome for Ken; but as he and his captors grew better acquainted the strain eased up, and Ken began to enjoy himself as he had not since coming to the university.  He could not have been better provided for. His books were at hand, and even notes of the lectures he was missing were brought to him. The college papers and magazines interested him, and finally he was much amused by an account of his mysterious disappearance. All in a day he found himself famous. Then Dale and his room-mates were so friendly and jolly that if his captivity had not meant the disgrace of the freshman class, Ken would have rejoiced in it. He began to thaw out, though he did not lose his backwardness. The life of the great university began to be real to him. Almost the whole sophomore class, in squads of twos and threes and sixes, visited Dale's rooms during that week. No Soph wanted to miss a sight of a captive bowl-man. Ken felt so callow and fresh in their presence that he scarcely responded to their jokes. Worry Arthur's nickname of \"Kid\" vied with another the coach conferred on Ken, and that was \"Peg.\" It was significant slang expressing the little baseball man's baseball notion of Ken's throwing power.  The evening was the most interesting time for Ken. There was always something lively going on. He wondered when the boys studied. When some of the outside"]]]
