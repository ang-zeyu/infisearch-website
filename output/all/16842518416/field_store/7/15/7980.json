This press should be divided vertically as well as     horizontally by sundry partitions, on which the books may be     ranged so as to be separated from one another; for fear they     be packed so close as to injure each other, or delay those who     want them.  Recesses such as these were developed in Cistercian houses into a small square room without a window, and but little larger than an ordinary cupboard. In the plans of Clairvaux and Kirkstall this room is placed between the chapter-house and the transept of the church; and similar rooms, in similar situations, have been found at Fountains, Beaulieu, Tintern, Netley, etc. The catalogue, made 1396, of the Cistercian Abbey at Meaux in Holderness, now totally destroyed, gives us a glimpse of the internal arrangement of one of these rooms. The books were placed on shelves against the walls, and even over the door. Again, the catalogue of the House of White Canons at Titchfield in Hampshire, dated 1400, shews that the books were kept in a small room, on shelves there called _columpnæ_, set against the walls. It is obvious that no study could have gone forward in such places as these; they must have been intended for security only, and to replace the wooden presses used elsewhere.  As time went on, the number of the books would naturally increase, and by the beginning of the fifteenth century the larger monasteries at least had accumulated many hundred volumes. For instance, at Christ Church, Canterbury, at the beginning of the 14th century, there were 698. These had to be bestowed in various parts of the House without order or selection,--in presses set up wherever a vacant corner could be found--to the great inconvenience, we may be sure, of the more studious monks, or of scholars who came to consult them. To remedy such a state of things a definite room was constructed for books--in addition to the presses in the cloister, which were still retained for the books in daily use. A few instances of this will suffice. At Christ Church, Canterbury, a library was built between 1414 and 1443 by Archbishop Chichele, over the Prior's Chapel; at Durham between 1416 and 1446 by Prior Wessyngton, over the old sacristy; at Citeaux in 1480, over the writing-room (_scriptorium_); at Clairvaux between 1495 and 1503, in the same position; at S. Victor in Paris--an Augustinian House--between 1501 and 1508; and at S. Germain des Prés in the same city about 1513, over the south cloister.  Most of us, I take it, have more or less imperfect ideas of the appearance of a great monastery in the days of its completeness; and information on this point is unfortunately much more defective for our own country than it is for France. In illustration, therefore, of what I have been saying about the position of monastic libraries, I will next shew you two bird's-eye views of the Benedictine House of S. Germain des Prés, Paris. The first, dated 1687, shews the library over the south walk of the cloister, where it was placed in 1513. It must not, however, be supposed that no library existed before this. On the contrary, the House seems to have had one from the first foundation, and so early as the thirteenth century it could be consulted by strangers, and books borrowed from it. The second view, dated 1723, shews a still further extension of the library. It has now invaded the west side of the cloister, which has received an upper storey, and even the external appearance of the venerable refectory, which was respected when nearly all the rest of the buildings were rebuilt in a classical style, has been sacrificed to a similar gallery. The united lengths of these three rooms must have been little short of 324 feet. This library was at the disposal of all scholars who desired to use it. When the Revolution came it contained more than 49,000 printed books, and 7000 manuscripts. The fittings belonged to the period of its latest extension: they appear to have been sumptuous, but for my present object, uninteresting.   _Views of S. Germain des Prés:_ (1) _from Franklin, \"Anciennes Bibliothèques de Paris,\"_ i. 126; (2) _from Bouillart, \"Histoire de l'Abbaye de S. Germain des Préz.\"_   At Canterbury the library, built as I have said, over the Prior's Chapel, was 60 feet long, by 22 feet broad; and we know, from some memoranda written in 1508, when a number of books were sent to be bound or repaired, that it contained sixteen bookcases, each of which had four shelves. I have calculated that this library could have contained about 2000 volumes.  I have shewn you a Benedictine House, and will next shew you a bird's-eye view of Citeaux, the parent house of the Cistercian Order, founded at the close of the eleventh century. The original was taken, so far as I can make out, about 1500, at any rate before the primitive buildings had been seriously altered. The library here occupied two positions--under the roof between the dormitory and the refectory (which must have been extremely inconvenient); and subsequently it was rebuilt in an isolated situation on the north side of the second cloister, over the writing-room (_scriptorium_). This was also the position of the new library at Clairvaux--the other great Cistercian House in France--the fame of which was equal to, if not greater than, that of Citeaux. Of this latter library we have two descriptions; the first written in 1517, the second in 1723.   _View of Citeaux: from Viollet-Le-Duc, \"Dictionnaire de l'Architecture,\"_ i. 271.   The former account, by the secretary of the Queen of Sicily, who visited Clairvaux 13 July 1517, is as follows:      On the same side of the cloister are fourteen studies, where     the monks write and study, and over the said studies is the     new library, to which one mounts by a broad and lofty spiral     staircase from the aforesaid cloister. This library is 189     feet long, by 17 feet wide. In it are 48 seats (_bancs_), and     in each seat 4 shelves (_poulpitres_) furnished with books on     all subjects, but chiefly theology; the greater number of the     said books are of vellum, and written by hand, richly storied     and illuminated. The building that contains the said library     is magnificent, built of stone, and excellently lighted on     both sides with fine large windows, well glazed, looking out     on the said cloister and the burial-ground of the brethren....     The said library is paved throughout with small tiles adorned     with various designs.  The description written in 1723, by the learned Benedictines to whom we owe the _Voyage Littéraire_, is equally interesting:      From the great cloister you proceed into the cloister of     conversation, so called because the brethren are allowed to     converse there. In this cloister there are 12 or 15 little     cells, all of a row, where the brethren formerly used to write     books; for this reason they are still called at the present     day the writing-rooms. Over these cells is the Library, the     building for which is large, vaulted, well lighted, and     stocked with a large number of manuscripts, fastened by chains     to desks; but there are not many printed books.  In the great cloister, on the side next the Chapter House, the same observer noted \"books chained on wooden desks, which brethren can come and read when they please.\" The library was for serious study, the cloister for daily reading, probably in the main devotional.  If my time were unlimited I could describe to you several other fifteenth century monastic libraries, but I feel that I must content myself with only one more--that of the Franciscan House in London, commonly called Christ's Hospital. The first stone of this library was laid by Sir Richard Whittington, 21 October, 1421, and by Christmas Day in the following year the roof was finished. Stow tells us that it was 129 feet long by 31 feet broad; and the Letters Patent of Henry the Eighth add that it had 28 desks, and 28 double settles of wainscot. The whole building--so well worth preservation--has been totally destroyed, but I am able to shew you a view of it.   _Library of Christ's Hospital: from Trollope's \"History of Christ's Hospital,\"_ p. 105.  This view is an excellent illustration of the point on which I have insisted, namely, that in the course of the fifteenth century the great religious Houses--no matter to what Order they belonged--found that their books had become too numerous for the localities primitively intended for them, and began to build special libraries--usually over some existing structure; or--in other words--established a library of reference, which was not unfrequently thrown open to scholars in general, who were allowed to borrow books from it, on execution of an indenture, or deposit of a sufficient pledge. \"It is safer to fall back on a pledge, than to proceed against an individual,\" said the Customs of the Priory at Abingdon.  In what way were these monastic libraries fitted up? No trace of any monastic fittings has survived, so far as I am aware, either in England, or in France, or in Italy; and even M. Viollet-Le-Duc dismisses \"The Library\" in a few brief sentences, of which the keynote is despair. My own view is that a close analogy may be traced between the fittings of monastic libraries and those of collegiate libraries; and that when we understand the one we shall understand the other.  The collegiate system was in no sense of the word monastic, indeed it was to a certain extent established to counteract monastic influence; but it is absurd to suppose that the younger communities would borrow nothing from the elder--especially when we reflect that the monastic system had completed at least seven centuries of successful existence before Walter de Merton was moved to found a college; that many of the subsequent founders of colleges were churchmen, if not actually monks; and that there were monastic colleges at both Universities. Further, as we"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19415"],["title","Libraries in the Medieval and Renaissance Periods (#3)"],["body","seen that study was specially enjoined upon the monks by S. Benedict, it is precisely in the direction of study that we should expect to find common features in the two sets of communities. And this, in fact, is what came to pass. An examination of the statutes affecting the library in the codes imposed upon the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge shews that their provisions were borrowed directly from the monastic Customs. The resemblances are too striking to be accidental. Take, for instance, this clause, from the statutes of Oriel College, Oxford, dated 1329:      The common books (_communes libri_) of the House are to be     brought out and inspected once a year, on the feast of the     Commemoration of Souls [2 November], in presence of the     Provost or his deputy, and of the Scholars [Fellows].      Every one of them in turn, in order of seniority, may select a     single book which either treats of the science to which he is     devoting himself, or which he requires for his use. This he     may keep until the same festival in the succeeding year, when     a similar selection of books is to take place, and so on, from     year to year. If there should happen to be more books than     persons, those that remain are to be selected in the same     manner.  Bishop Bateman--who had been educated in the priory at Norwich, and whose brother was an abbot--gave statutes to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in 1350, with similar provisions, and the addition that certain books \"are to remain continuously in the library-chamber, fastened with iron chains, for the common use of the Fellows.\" These were copied by Wykeham at New College, Oxford, but with extended provisions for lending books to students, and a direction that all the books \"which remain unassigned after the Fellows have made their selection are to be fastened with iron chains, and remain for ever in the common Library.\" This statute was repeated at King's College, Cambridge, and at several colleges in Oxford.  Let me now remind you of Archbishop Lanfranc's statute for English Benedictines, dated 1070, which was based, as he himself tells us, on the general monastic practice of his time:      On the Monday after the first Sunday in Lent, before brethren     come into the Chapter House, the librarian (_custos librorum_)     shall have had a carpet laid down, and all the books got     together upon it, except those which a year previously had     been assigned for reading. These brethren are to bring with     them, when they come into the Chapter House, each his book in     his hand....      Then the librarian shall read a statement as to the manner in     which brethren have had books during the past year. As each     brother hears his name pronounced he is to give back the book     which had been entrusted to him for reading; and he whose     conscience accuses him of not having read the book through     which he had received, is to fall on his face, confess his     fault, and entreat forgiveness.      The librarian shall then make a fresh distribution of books,     namely, a different volume to each brother for his reading.  You will agree with me, I feel sure, that this statute, or similar provisions extracted from other regulations, is the source of the collegiate provisions for an annual audit and distribution of books; while the reservation of the undistributed volumes, and their chaining for common use in a library, was in accordance with the unwritten practice of the monasteries. This being the case I think that we are justified in assuming that the internal fittings of the libraries would be identical also; and it must be further remembered that both collegiate and monastic libraries were being fitted up during the same period, the fifteenth century.  When books were first placed in a separate room, fastened with iron chains, for the use of the Fellows of a college or the monks of a convent, the piece of furniture used was, I take it, an elongated lectern or desk, of a convenient height for a seated reader to use. The books lay on their sides on the desk, and were attached by chains to a horizontal bar above it. There were at least two libraries in this University fitted with such desks, at the colleges of Pembroke and Queens'; and that it was a common form abroad is proved by its appearance in a French translation of the first book of the _Consolations of Philosophy_ of Boethius, which I lately found in the British Museum[1], executed towards the end of the fifteenth century (fig. 1).  [Illustration: FIG. 1. Interior of a library: from a MS. of a French translation of the first book of the _Consolations of Philosophy_ of Boethius.]  One example at least of these fittings still exists, in the library attached to the church of S. Wallberg, at Zutphen in Holland. This library was built in its present position in 1555, but I suspect that some of the fittings, those namely which are more richly ornamented, were removed from an earlier library. Each of these desks is 9 feet long by 5 feet 6 inches high; and, as you will see directly, a man can sit and read at them very conveniently. I shall shew you first a general view of part of the library (fig. 2); and, secondly, a single desk (fig. 3).  Such cases as these must have been in use at the Sorbonne, where a library was first established in 1289 for books chained for the common convenience of the Fellows (_in communem sociorum utilitatem_). A description of this library, based probably on records now lost, has been given by Claude Héméré (Librarian 1638-1643) in his MS. history. This I proceed to translate:  [Illustration: FIG. 3. Desk in the library at Zutphen: from a photograph.]      The old library was contained under one roof. It was firmly     and solidly built, and was 120 feet long by 36 feet broad.     Further, that it might be the more safe from the danger of     being burnt, should any house in the neighbourhood catch     fire, there was a sufficient interval between it and every     dwelling-house. Each side was pierced with 19 windows of equal     size, that plenty of daylight both from the east and the west     (for this was the direction of the room) might fall upon the     desks, and fill the whole length and breadth of the library.     There were 28 desks, marked with the letters of the alphabet,     five feet high, and so arranged that they were separated by a     moderate interval. They were loaded with books, all of which     were chained, that no sacrilegious hand might [carry them off.     These chains were attached to the right-hand board of every     book] so that they might be readily thrown aside, and reading     not be interfered with. Moreover the volumes could be opened     and shut without difficulty. A reader who sat down in the     space between two desks, as they rose to a height of five feet     as I said above, neither saw nor disturbed any one else who     might be reading or writing in another place by talking or by     any other interruption, unless the other student wished it, or     paid attention to any question that might be put to him. It     was required, by the ancient rules of the library, that     reading, writing, and handling of books should go forward in     complete silence.  This system must have been very wasteful as regards space; for only a few volumes, say a couple of dozen, could be accommodated on a single desk. As books accumulated therefore some other form of case had to be devised, which would accommodate more volumes than could be consulted at once. The desk could not be dispensed with so long as books were chained, but one or more shelves were added to it. This addition was effected in two ways, according as the books were to stand on their ends, or to lie on their sides.  As an illustration of the former plan I will take the library of Merton College, Oxford, attributed by tradition to William Reade, Bishop of Chichester 1368-85; and it has been so little altered that it may be taken as a type of a medieval collegiate or monastic library. It is a long narrow room, as all medieval libraries were, with equidistant windows, and the bookcases stand at right angles to the walls in the spaces between each pair of windows, in front of which is the seat for the reader. Each bookcase had originally two shelves only above the desk. I will shew you, first, a general view of the interior of this library, and then a single bookcase and seat.   _Merton College, Oxford: (1) general view of the interior of the Library; (2) a single bookcase as at present._   The system of chaining, as adopted in this country, would allow of the books being readily taken down from the shelves, and laid on the desk for reading. One end of the chain was attached to the middle of the upper edge of the right-hand board; the other to a ring which played on a bar set in front of the shelf on which the book stood. The fore-edge of the books, not the back, was turned forwards. A swivel, usually in the middle of the chain, prevented tangling. The chains varied in length according to the distance of the shelf from the desk. The bar was kept in place by a rather elaborate system of iron-work attached to the end of the bookcase, and secured by a lock which often required two keys--that is, the presence of two officials--to open it. To illustrate this I will shew you a sketch of one of the bookcases in Hereford Cathedral (fig. 4).  [Illustration: FIG. 4. Bookcase in Hereford Cathedral. (Lent by the Syndics of the University Press.)]  Having said thus much about chaining, I return to the Merton bookcases. Cases similar to these were evidently in use in the library of Christ Church, Canterbury, where the memoranda I mentioned record four shelves--that is, two on each side--in each bookcase, and also at Clairvaux, where a similar feature was observed. The design was evidently much admired, for we find cases on a similar plan, but larger, elsewhere in Oxford, as at the Colleges of Corpus"]]]
