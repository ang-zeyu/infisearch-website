He had good reason to remember them.  \"That's understandable,\" Loudons said, \"after what their ancestors went through in the last war. And so are the others, in their own way.  \"But this crowd here!\" Loudons put down his cigar and began chewing on his mustache, a sure sign that he was more than puzzled: he was a very worried man.  Altamont respected his partner's abilities in this area. However, he also knew that the best way to get his friend to work any problem was to have him do it in conversation.  \"What has you stopped, Jim?\"  \"Number of things, Monty. They're hard to explain because--\" the sociologist shrugged, winced a little as the gesture pushed his leg down on the edge of his bunk--\"well, let me just mention them.  \"These people are the descendants of an old United States Army platoon, yet they have a fully-developed religion centered on a slain and resurrected god.  \"Now, Monty, with all due respect to the old US Army, that just doesn't make sense! Normally, it would take thousands of years for a slain-god religion to develop, and then only in a special situation, from the field-fertility magic of primitive agriculturists.  \"Well, you saw those people's fields from the air. Some members of that old platoon were men who knew the latest methods of scientific farming. They didn't need naive fairy tales about the planting and germination of seed.\"  \"Sure this religion isn't just a variant of Christianity?\"  \"Absolutely not!  \"In the first place, these Sacred Books cannot be the Bible--you heard Tenant Jones say that they mentioned firearms that used cartridges. That means they can't be older than 1860 at the earliest.  \"And, in the second place, this slain god wasn't crucified, or put to death by any form of execution: he perished, together with his enemy, in combat, and both god and devil were later resurrected.\"  Loudons picked up his cigar again. \"By the way, the Enemy is supposed to be the master-mind back of these cannibal savages in the woods and also in the ruins.\"  \"Did you get a look at these Sacred Books, or find out what they might be?\"  Loudons shook his head disgustedly. \"Every time I brought up the question, they evaded me. The Tenant sent the Reader out to bring in this old lady, Irene Klein--she was a perfect gold-mine of information about the history and traditions of the platoon, by the way--and then he sent the Reader out on some other errand, undoubtedly to pass the word around not to talk to us about their religion.\"  \"I don't get that,\" Altamont said. \"They showed me everything--their gunshop, their powder mill, their defenses, everything.\"  He smoked in silence for a moment, then added, in an apologetic tone, \"Jim, I'm sure you've thought of this: the slain god couldn't be the original platoon commander, could he?\"  \"I've thought of it, and he isn't, Monty.  \"No, definitely not, though they have the greatest respect for his memory--decorate his grave regularly, drink toasts to him, and so on. But he hasn't been deified. They got the idea for this god of theirs out of the Sacred Books.\"  Loudons put the cigar down again and returned to chewing his mustache. \"Monty, this has me worried like the devil:  \"I believe that they suspect that you are the Slain and Risen One!\"  Altamont considered the idea, then nodded slowly. \"Could be, at that. I know the Tenant came up to me, very respectfully, and said, 'I hope you don't think, sir, that I was presumptuous in trying to display my humble deductive abilities to you.'\"  \"What did you say?\" Loudons demanded rather sharply.  \"Told him certainly not, that he'd used a good, quick method of demonstrating that he and his people weren't like those mindless subhumans in the woods.\"  \"That was all right,\" Loudons approved, but then his worries returned. \"I don't know how we're going to handle this--\"  \"Jim, how about that pows business? Is there something there?\"  \"Monty!\" Loudons voice was drily chiding as he took a pad of paper and scribbled briefly. \"Take a look and figure for yourself.\"  Altamont looked at the paper. Loudons had simply printed the first three letters of the word in capitals and separated each letter with a period. \"Ouch! Yes, of course, that's what an infantry platoon would be guarding.  \"Go ahead, Jim, this is your end of our business. I'll stay out of it and, especially, I'll keep my mouth shut.\"  \"I don't think you'll be able to,\" Loudons said soberly. \"As things stand now, they only suspect that you are their deity.  \"And that means this: we're on trial here!\"  \"We have been in spots like this before, Jim,\" Altamont reminded his friend.  \"Not like this, Monty, and let me explain.  \"I get the impression here that logic, not faith, is the supreme religious virtue. And get this, Monty, because it's something practically unheard of: skepticism is a religious obligation, not a sin!  \"I wish I knew....\"     VII   Tenant Mycroft Jones, Reader Stamford Rawson, Toon Sarge Verner Hughes, and his son, Murray Hughes, sat around the bare-topped table in the room on the second floor of the Aitch-Cue House. A lighted candle flickered in the cool breeze that came in through the open window, throwing their shadows back and forth on the walls.  \"Pass the tantalus, Murray,\" the Tenant said, and the youngest of the four handed the corncob-corked bottle to the eldest. Tenant Jones filled his cup and then sat staring at it, while Verner Hughes thrust his pipe into the toe of the moccasin and filled it. Finally, the Tenant drank about half the clear, wild-plum brandy.  \"Gentlemen, I am baffled,\" he confessed. \"We have three alternate possibilities here and we dare not disregard any of them.  \"Either this man who calls himself Altamont is truly He, or his is merely what we are asked to believe, one of a community of men like ours, with more of the old knowledge than we possess.\"  \"You know my views,\" Verner Hughes said. \"I cannot believe that He was more than a man, as we are. A great, a good, a wise man, but a man and mortal.\"  \"Let's not go into that, now.\" The Reader emptied his cup and took the bottle, filling it again. \"You know my views, too. I hold that He is no longer upon earth in the flesh, but lives in the spirit and is only with us in the spirit.  \"But you said there were three possibilities, none of which can be eliminated. What was your third possibility, Tenant?\"  \"That they are creatures of the Enemy, perhaps that one or the other of them is the Enemy.\"  Reader Rawson, lifting his cup to his lips, almost strangled. The Hugheses, father and son stared at Tenant Jones in horror.  \"The Enemy--with such weapons and resources!\" Murray Hughes gasped. Then he emptied his cup and refilled it. \"No! I can't believe that: he would have struck before this and wiped us all out!\"  \"Not necessarily, Murray,\" the Tenant replied. \"Until he became convinced that his agents, the Scowrers, could do nothing against us, he would bide his time. He sits motionless, like a spider, at the center of the web; he does little himself; his agents are numerous.  \"Or, perhaps, he wishes to recruit us into this hellish organization.\"  \"It is a possibility,\" the Reader admitted, \"and one which we can neither accept or reject safely. And we must learn the truth as soon as possible. If this man is really He, we must not spurn Him on mere suspicion. If he is a man, come to help us, we must accept his help; if he is speaking the truth, the people who sent him could do wonders for us, and the greatest wonder would be to make us again a part of a civilized community.  \"And if he is the Enemy....\" Rawson left the sentence unfinished, but his face was grim.  \"But if he is really He,\" Murray said, a little diffidently, for he was not yet accustomed to being included in the council of the elders, \"I think we are on trial.\"  \"What do you mean, son? Oh, I see. Of course, I don't believe that he is, but that's mere doubt, not negative certainty. However, if I'm wrong, if this man is truly He, we are worthy of him, we will penetrate his disguise.\"  \"A very pretty problem, gentlemen,\" the Tenant said, smacking his lips over his brandy, \"for all that it may be a deadly serious one for us. There is, of course, nothing we can do tonight. But, tomorrow, we have promised to help our visitors, whoever they may be, in searching for this crypt in the city.  \"Murray, you were to be in charge of the detail that was to accompany them. Carry on as arranged, and say nothing of our suspicions, but advise your men to keep a sharp watch on the strangers, that they may learn all they can from them.  \"Stamford, you and Verner and I will go along. We should, if we have any wits at all, observe something.\"     VIII   \"Listen to this infernal thing!\" Altamont raged. \"'Wielding a gold-plated spade handled with oak from an original rafter of the Congressional Library, at three-fifteen one afternoon last week--' One afternoon last week!\" He cursed luridly. \"Why couldn't that blasted magazine say what afternoon? I've gone over a lot of twentieth century copies of that magazine and that expression was a regular cliche with them.\"  Loudons looked over his shoulder at the photostated magazine page.  \"Well, we know it was between June thirteen and nineteen, inclusive,\" he said. \"And there's a picture of the university president, complete with gold-plated spade, breaking ground. Call it Wednesday, the sixteenth. Over there's the tip of the shadow of the old Cathedral of Learning, about a hundred yards away. There are so many inexactitudes, that one'll probably cancel out the other.\"  \"That's so, and it's also pretty futile getting angry at somebody who's been dead two hundred years, but why couldn't they say Wednesday, or Monday, or Saturday, or whatever?\"  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19158"],["title","The Return (#5)"],["body","checked back in the astronomical handbook, and the photostated pages of the old almanac, then looked over his calculations. \"All right, here is the angle of the shadow, and the compass-bearing.  \"I had a look, yesterday, when I was taking the local citizenry on that junket. The old baseball diamond at Forbes Field is plainly visible, and I located the ruins of the Cathedral of Learning from that.  \"Here's the above-sea-level altitude of the top of the tower. After you've landed us, go up to this altitude--use the barometric altimeter, not the radar--and hold position.\"  Loudons leaned forward from the desk to the contraption Altamont had rigged up in the nose of the helicopter; one of the telescope-sighted hunting rifles clamped in a vise, with a compass and a spirit-level under it.  \"Rifle's pointing downward at the correct angle now?\" he asked. \"Good. Then all I have to do is to hold the helicopter steady, keep it at the right altitude, level and pointed in the right direction, and watch through the sight while you move the flag around, and direct you by radio.\"  \"Simple, if I had been born quintuplets!\"  \"Mr. Altamont! Doctor Loudons!\" a voice outside the helicopter called. \"Are you ready for us now?\"  Altamont went to the open door and looked out. The old Toon Leader, the Reader, Toon Sarge Hughes, his son and four young men in buckskins with slung rifles were standing outside.  \"I have decided,\" the Tenant said, \"that Mr. Rawson and Sarge Hughes and I would be of more help than an equal number of young men. We may not be as active, but we do know the old ruins better, especially the paths and hiding places of the Scowrers. These four young men you probably met last evening, but it will do no harm to introduce them again.  \"Birdy Edwards; Sholto Jiminez; Jefferson Burns; Murdo Olsen.\"  \"Very pleased, Tenant, gentlemen. I met all of you young men last evening and I remember you,\" Altamont said. \"Now, if you'll crowd in here, I'll explain what we're going to try to do.\"  He showed them the old picture. \"You see where the shadow of a tall building falls?\" he asked. \"We know the height and location of this building. Doctor Loudons will hold this helicopter at exactly the position of the top of the building and aim through the sights of the rifle, there. One of you will have this flag in his hand, and will move it back and forth. Doctor Loudons will tell us when the flag is in sight of the rifle.\"  \"He'll need a good pair of lungs to do that,\" Verner Hughes commented.  \"We'll use the radio. A portable set on the ground, and the helicopter's radio set,\" Altamont said.  To his surprise, he was met with looks of incomprehension. He had not supposed that these people would have lost all memory of radio communication.  \"Why, that's wonderful!\" the Reader exclaimed, when the explanation was concluded. \"You can talk directly. How much better than just sending a telegram!\"  \"But, finding the crypt by the shadow, that's exactly like the--\" Murray Hughes began, then stopped short. Immediately, he began talking about the rifle that was to be used as a surveying transit, comparing it with the ones in the big first-floor room at the Aitch-Cue House.  Locating the point where the shadow of the old Cathedral of Learning had fallen proved easier than either Altamont or Loudons had expected. The towering building was now a tumbled mass of slagged rubble, but it was quite possible to determine its original center, and with the old data from the excellent reference library at Fort Ridgeway, its height above sea level was known. After a little jockeying, the helicopter came to a hovering stop, and the slanting barrel of the rifle in the vise pointed downward along the line of the shadow that had been cast on that afternoon in June, 1993.  The cross-hairs of the scope sight centered almost exactly on the spot Altamont had estimated on the map.  Guiding himself by peering through the rifle-sight, Loudons brought the helicopter slanting down to land on the sheet of fused glass that had once been a grassy campus.  \"Well, this is probably it,\" Altamont said. \"We didn't have to bother fussing around with that flag after all. That hump over there looks as though it had been a small building, and there's nothing corresponding to it on the city map. That may be the bunker over the stair-head to the crypt.\"  They began unloading equipment--a small, portable nuclear-electric conversion unit, a powerful solenoid-hammer, crowbars and intrenching tools, tins of blasting plastic. They took out the two hunting rifles and the auto-carbines, and Altamont showed the young men of Murray Hughes' detail how to use them.  \"If you will pardon me, sir,\" the Tenant said to Altamont, \"I think it would be a good idea if your companion went up in the flying machine and circled over us, to keep watch for the Scowrers. There are quite a few of them, particularly farther up the rivers, to the east, where the damage was not so great and they can find cellars and shelters and buildings to live in.\"  \"Good idea. That way, we won't have to put out guards,\" Altamont said. \"From the looks of this, we'll need every body to help dig into that thing. Hand out one of the portable radios, Jim and go up to about a thousand feet. If you see anything suspicious, give us a yell, then spray it with bullets, and find out what it is afterward.\"  They waited until the helicopter had climbed to position and was circling above, and then turned their attention to the place where the sheet of fused earth and stone bulged upward. It must have been almost ground-zero of one of the hydrogen-bombs: the wreckage of the Cathedral of Learning had fallen predominantly to the north, and the Carnegie Library was tumbled to the east.  \"I think the entrance would be on this side, toward the Library,\" Altamont said. \"Let's try it, to begin with.\"  He used the solenoid-hammer, slowly pounding a hole in the glaze, and placed a small charge of the plastic explosive. Chunks of the lava-like stuff pelted down between the little mound and the huge one of the old library, blowing a hole six feet in diameter and the two and a half feet deep, revealing concrete bonded with crushed steel-mill slag.  \"We missed the door,\" Altamont said. \"That means we'll have to tunnel in through who knows how much concrete. Well....\"  He used a second and larger charge, after digging a hole a foot deep. When he and his helpers came up to look, they found a large mass of concrete blown out, and solid steel behind it. Altamont cut two more holes, one on either side of the blown-out place, and fired a charge in each of them, bringing down more concrete.  He found he hadn't missed the door after all. It had merely been concreted over.  A few more shots cleared it, and after some work, they got it open. There was a room inside, concrete-floored and entirely empty. Altamont stood in the doorway and inspected the interior with his flashlight; he heard somebody behind him say something about a most peculiar sort of dark-lantern.  Across the small room, on the opposite wall, was a bronze plaque.  The plaque carried quite a lengthy inscription, including the names of all the persons and institutions participating in the microfilm project. The History Department at the Fort would be interested in that, but the only thing that interested Altamont was the statement that the floor had been laid over the trapdoor leading to the vault where the microfilms were stored. He went outside to the radio.  \"Hello, Jim. We're inside, but the films were stored in an underground vault, and so we have to tear up a concrete floor,\" he said. \"Go back to the village and gather up all the men you can carry. I don't want to use explosives inside. The interior of the crypt oughtn't to be damaged. Besides, I don't know what a blast in there might do to the film, and I don't want to take any chances.\"  \"No, of course not. How thick do you think the floor is?\"  \"Haven't the least idea. Plenty thick, I would guess. Those films would have to be well-buried, to shield them from radioactivity. We can expect that it will take some time.\"  \"All right. I'll be back as soon as I can.\"  The helicopter turned and went windmilling away, over what had been the Golden Triangle, down the Ohio. Altamont went back to the little concrete bunker and sat down, lighting his pipe. Murray Hughes and his four riflemen spread out, one circling around the glazed butte that had been the Cathedral of Learning, another climbing to the top of the old Library, and the others taking positions to the south and east.  Altamont sat in silence, smoking his pipe and trying to form some conception of the wealth under that concrete floor.  It was no use.  Jim Loudons probably understood a little more clearly what those books would mean to the world of today, and what they could do toward shaping the world of the future.  There was a library at Fort Ridgeway, and it was an excellent one ... for its purpose. In 1996, when the rockets had come crashing down, it had contained the cream of the world's technical knowledge--and very little else. There was only a little fiction, a few books of ideas, just enough to give the survivors a tantalizing glimpse of the world of their fathers.  But now....         *       *       *       *       *  A rifle banged to the south and east, and banged again. Either Murray Hughes or Birdy Edwards: it was one of the two hunting rifles from the helicopter.  On the heels of the reports, they heard a voice shouting, \"Scowrers! A lot of them, coming from up the river!\"  A moment later, there was a light whip-crack of one of the muzzleloaders, from the top of the old Carnegie Library, and Altamont could see a wisp of grey-white smoke drifting away from where it had been fired.  Altamont jumped to his feet and raced for the radio, picking it up and bring it to the bunker.  Tenant Jones, old Reader Rawson, and Verner Hughes had caught up their rifles. The Tenant was"]]]
