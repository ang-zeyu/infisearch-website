Little round ball for a head, little mites o' eyes; but you won't care--you can see _just_ as well.\"  \"It does beat all where children get such queer ideas--doesn't it, Ruth?\" said Miss Whiting.  \"Didn't you know it?\" cried Katie, finding she had startled Miss Polly. \"Didn't you know you's goin' to be little, and fly in the air just so?\" throwing up her arms. \"I want to go dreffully, for there's a gold harp o' music up there, and I'll play on it: it'll be mine.\"  \"You don't feel in a hurry to die, I hope,\" said Miss Polly, anxiously.  Katie's eager face clouded. \"No,\" said she, sorrowfully; \"I want to, but I hate to go up to God and leave my pink dress. I can't go into it then, I'll be so little.\"  \"You'll be just big enough to go into the pocket,\" laughed Dotty.  \"Hush!\" said Miss Polly, gravely; \"you shouldn't joke upon such serious subjects. Good by, children. Your house is full of company, and I didn't come to stay. Here's a bag of thoroughwort I've been picking for your grandmother; you may give it to her with my love, and tell her my side is worse. I shall be in to-morrow.\"  So saying, Miss Polly went away, seeming to be wafted out of the room on a sigh.  The high-chair was brought down from the attic for Flyaway, who sat in it that evening at the tea-table, and smiled round upon her friends in the most benevolent manner.  \"I's growing so big now, mamma,\" said she, coaxingly, \"don't you spect I must have some tea?\"  Grandmother pleaded for the youngest, too. \"Let me give her some just this once, Maria.\"  \"Well, _white_ tea, then,\" returned Mrs. Clifford, smiling; \"and will Flyaway remember not to ask for it again? Mamma thinks little girls should drink milk.\"  \"Yes'm, I won't never. She gives it to me _this_ night, 'cause I's her little _grand-girl_. Mayn't Hollis have it too, 'cause he's her little grand-_boy_?\"  \"Cunning as ever, you see,\" whispered the admiring Horace to cousin Susy, who replied, rather indifferently,--  \"No cunninger than our Prudy used to be.\"  Flyaway made quick work of drinking her white tea, and when she came to the last few drops she swung her cup round and round, saying,--  \"Didn't you know, Hollis, that's the way gampa does, when _he_ gets most froo, to make it sweet?\"  No, Horace had not noticed; it was \"Fly, with her little eye,\" who saw everything, and made remarks about it.  \"O, O,\" cried Grace, dropping her knife and fork, and patting her hands softly under the table, \"isn't it so nice to be at Willowbrook again, taking supper together? Doesn't it remind you of pleasant things, Susy, to eat grandma's cream toast?\"  \"Reminds me,\" said Susy, after reflecting, \"of jumping on the hay.\"  \"'Minds me of--of--\" remarked Flyaway; and there she fell into a brown study, with her head swaying from side to side.  \"I don't know why it is,\" said Prudy, \"but since you spoke, this cream toast makes me think of the rag-bag. Excuse me for being impolite, grandma, but where _is_ the rag-bag?\"  \"In the back room, dear, where it always is; and you may wheel it off to-morrow.\"  It had been Mrs. Parlin's custom, once or twice every summer, to allow the children to take the large, heavy rag-bag to the store, and sell its contents for little articles, which they divided among themselves. Sometimes the price of the rags amounted to half or three quarters of a dollar, and there was a regular carnival of figs, candy, and fire-crackers.  Horace was so much older now, that he did not fancy the idea of being seen in the street, trundling a wheelbarrow; but he went on with his cream toast and made no remark.     CHAPTER VI.  THE RAG-BAG.   Next morning there was a loud call from the three Parlins for the rag-bag, in which Flyaway joined, though she hardly knew the difference between a rag-bag and a paper of pins.  \"I wish you to understand, girls,\" said Horace, flourishing his hat, \"that I'm not going to cart round any such trash for you this summer.\"  \"Now, Horace!\"  \"You know, Gracie, you belong to a Girls' Rights' Society. Do you suppose I want to interfere with your privileges?\"  \"Why, Horace Clifford, you wouldn't see your own sister trundling a wheelbarrow?\"  \"O, no; I shan't be there,\" said Horace, coolly; \"I shan't see you. I promised to weed the verbena bed for your aunt Louise. Good by, girls. Success to the rag-bag!\"  \"Let's catch him!\" cried Susy, darting after her ungallant cousin; but he ran so fast, and flourished his garden hoe so recklessly, that she gave up the chase.  \"Let him go,\" said Grace, with a fine-lady air: \"who cares about rag-bags? We've outgrown that sort of thing, you and I, Susy; let the little girls have our share.\"  \"Yes, to be sure,\" replied Susy, faintly, though not without a pang, for she still retained a childish fondness for jujube paste, and was not allowed a great abundance of pocket-money. \"Yes, to be sure, let the _little_ girls have our share.\"  \"Then may we three youngest have the whole rag-bag?\" said Prudy, brightly. \"Dotty, you and I will trundle the wheelbarrow, and Fly shall go behind.\"  \"What an idea!\" exclaimed Grace. \"I've seen little beggar children drawing a dog-cart. Grandma'll never allow such a thing.\"  \"Indeed I will,\" said grandma, tying on her checked apron. \"Dog-carts or wheel-barrows, so they only take care not to be rude. In a city it is different.\"  \"Yes, grandma,\" said Dotty, twisting her front hair joyfully; \"but here in the country they want little girls to have good times--don't they? Why don't everybody move into the country, do you s'pose? Lots of bare spots round here,--nothing on 'em but cows.\"  \"Yes, nuffin' but gampa's cows,\" chimed in Flyaway, twisting _her_ front hair.  \"Louisa,\" said Mrs. Parlin, \"you may help me about this loaf of 'Maine plum cake,' and while you are beating the butter and sugar I will look over the rag-bag. Dotty, please run for my spectacles.\"  When Dotty returned with the spectacles, Jennie Vance came with her, pouting a little at the cool reception she had met, and thinking Miss Dimple hardly polite because she was too much interested in an old rag-bag to pay proper attention to visitors.  \"Grandma, what makes you pick over these rags? We can take them just as they are.\"  \"I always do so, my dear, and for several reasons. One is, that woollen pieces may have crept in by mistake. As we profess to sell cotton rags, it would be dishonest to mix them with woollen.\"  \"Yes'm, I understand,\" said Jennie, who often spoke when it was quite as well to keep silent; \"it's always best to be honest--isn't it, Mrs. Parlin?\"  The rags were spread out upon the table, giving Flyaway a fine opportunity to scatter them right and left.  \"O, here's a splendid piece of blue ribbon to make my doll a bonnet,\" said Dotty.  \"That's another reason why she picks 'em over,\" remarked Jennie; \"so she won't waste things. Only, Dotty, that has got an awful grease-spot.\"  \"There, children,\" said Mrs. Parlin, presently, \"I have taken out a card of hooks and eyes, a flannel bandage, and a shoe-string. You may have everything else.\"  Dotty caught her grandmother's arm. \"Please, grandma, don't sweep 'em into the bag; let us look some more. I've just found a big Lisle glove; if I can find another, then Abner can go blackberrying; he says his hands are ever so tender.\"  \"And you thought he was in earnest,\" said Prudy. \"While you are looking, I'll go into the nursery and finish that holder.\"  Flyaway, having climbed upon the table, had rolled herself into some mosquito netting, like a caterpillar in a cocoon. They were all so much interested, that grandma, in the kindness of her heart, did not like to disturb them.  \"You are welcome to all the treasures you can find, but as soon as the cake is made I shall want the table; so be quick,\" said she, looking out from the pantry, where she was beating eggs.  \"Yes, indeed, grandma, we'll hurry; and may we have every single thing we like the looks of? now, honest.\"  \"Yes, Dotty.\"  Then Mrs. Parlin and Miss Louise talked about currants, and citron, and quite forgot such trifles as rag-bags.  \"Here's another big glove,\" said Dotty, \"not the same color, but no matter; and here are some saddle-bags, Jennie. I'm going to be a doctor.\"  \"Saddle-bags, Dotty! those are pockets.\" Jennie took them from Miss Dimple's hands. They were held together by a narrow strip of brown linen, and had once belonged to a pair of pantaloons.  \"I'm going to see if there isn't something inside,\" said Jennie. \"Why, yes, here's a raisin, true's you live. And here, in the other one,--O, Dotty!\"  But Dotty had run into the nursery to show Prudy a muslin cap.  \"A wad of--\"  Jennie was determined to see what; so she unrolled it.  \"Scrip,\" cried she, holding up some greenbacks.  \"Skipt,\" echoed Flyaway, who had come out of the cocoon and gone into the form of a mop, her head adorned with cotton fringe.  Yes; a two dollar bill and a one dollar bill, as green as lettuce leaves. This was a great marvel. Columbus was not half so much surprised when he discovered America.  \"Mrs. Parlin, do you hear?\"  But Mrs. Parlin heard nothing, for the din of the egg-beating drowned both the shrill little voices.  A sudden idea came to Jennie. Whose money was this? Mrs. Parlin's? No;"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19247"],["title","Dotty Dimple's Flyaway (#6)"],["body","n't Mrs. Parlin looked over the rags once, and said the children might have what was left? \"'You are welcome to all the treasures you can find;' that was what she said,\" repeated Jennie to herself. \"I'm the one that found this treasure,--not Dotty, not Flyaway. This is honest, and I do not lie when I say it.\"  Jennie began to tremble, and a hot color flew into her cheeks, and added new lustre to her black eyes. \"If I could only make Flyaway forget it,\" thought she, with a whirling sensation of anger towards the innocent child, who knew no better than to proclaim aloud every piece of news she heard. \"I'll make her forget it.\" Jenny hastily concealed the money in the neck of her dress.  \"Where's that skipt? that skipt?\" said Flyaway.  \"Fly Clifford,\" said Jennie, severely, \"you've climbed on the table! Just think of it! Your grandmother doesn't allow you on her table. What made you get up here.\"  \"'Cause,\" replied Flyaway, seizing the kitty by the tail, and thrusting her into a cabbage-net, \"'cause I fought best.\"  \"But you must get right down, this minute.\"  \"No,\" said Flyaway, shaking her head-dress of white fringe with great solemnity; \"I isn't goin' to get down.\"  \"Ah, but you must.\"  Flyaway opened and shut her eyes slowly, in token of deep displeasure. \"I don't never 'low little girls to scold to me,\" said she. \"You'd better call grandma; 'haps _she_ can make me get down.\"  But it was not Jennie's purpose to wait for that; she seized the little one roughly by the arms, pulled her from the table, and hurried her into the parlor.  Flyaway was indignant. \"Does you--feel happy?\" said she, with a reproachful glance at Jennie.  \"There, look out of the window, Flyaway, darling, and watch to see if Horace isn't coming in from the garden.\"  \"Can't Hollis come, 'thout me watching him?\" returned Flyaway, winking slowly again, for her sweet little soul was stirred with wrath. The memory of the \"skipt\" had indeed been driven away, and she could only think,--  \"Isn't Jennie so easy fretted! I wasn't doin' nuffin'; and then she jumped me right down. Unpolite gell! that's one thing.\"  And Jennie was thinking, \"She never'll remember the money now, or, if she does, I don't believe Mrs. Parlin will pay any attention to what she says.\" Jennie was still very much excited, and wondered why she trembled so.  \"I don't mean to keep it unless it's perfectly proper,\" thought she; \"I guess I know the eighth commandment fast enough. I shan't keep it unless Dotty thinks best. I'll tell her, and see what she says.\"  Jennie had often pilfered little things from her mother's cupboard, such as cake and raisins; but a piece of money of the most trifling value she had never thought of taking before.  Leaving Flyaway busy with block houses, she ran to the nursery door, and motioned with her finger for Dotty to come out.  \"What is it?\" said Dotty, when they were both shut into the china closet; \"don't you want my sister Prudy to know?\"  Jennie replied, in a great flutter, \"No, no, no. You musn't tell a single soul, Dotty Dimple, as long as you live, and I'll give you half.\"  \"Half what?\"  Jennie produced the money from her bosom, feeling, I am glad to say, very guilty. \"Out o' those saddle-bag pockets out there,\" added she, breathlessly; \"true's the world.\"  \"Why, Jennie Vance!\"  \"One had a raisin in and a button, and nobody but me would have thought of looking. You wouldn't--now would you? My father says I've got such sharp eyes!\"  \"H'm!\" said Dotty, who considered her own eyes as bright as any diamonds; \"you took the saddle-bag right out of my hand. How do you know I shouldn't have peeked in?\"  Jennie did not reply, but smoothed out the wrinkled notes with many a loving pat.  \"What did grandma say?\" asked Dotty; \"wasn't she pleased?\"  \"Your grandmother doesn't know anything about it, Dotty Dimple; what business is it to her?\"  Jennie's tone was defiant. She assumed a courage she was far from feeling.  Dotty was speechless with surprise, but her eyes grew as round as soap-bubbles.  \"The pockets don't belong to her, Dotty, and never did. They never came out of any of her dresses--now did they?\"  Dotty's eyes swelled like a couple of bubbles ready to burst.  \"Jennie Vance, I didn't know you's a thief.\"  \"You stop talking so, Dotty. She was going to sweep everything into the rag-bag--now wasn't she? And this money would have gone in too, if it hadn't been for my sharp eyes--now wouldn't it?\"  \"But it isn't yours, Jennie Vance--because it don't belong to you.\"  \"Now, Dotty--\"  \"You go right off, Jennie Vance, and carry it to my grandma this minute.\"  The tone of command irritated Jennie. She had not felt at all decided about keeping the money, but opposition gave her courage. Her temper and Dotty's were always meeting and striking fire.  \"It isn't your grandma's pockets, Miss Parlin. If it was the last word I was to speak, it isn't your grandmother's pockets!\"  \"Jane Sidney Vance!\"  \"You needn't call me by my middle name, and stare so at me, Dotty Dimple. I was going to give you half!\"  \"What do I want of half, when it isn't yours to give?\" said Dotty, gazing regretfully at the money, nevertheless. Three dollars! Why, it was a small fortune! If it only did really belong to Jenny!  \"Your grandmother said everything we liked the looks of, Dotty. Don't you like the looks of this?\"  \"But you know, Jennie--\"  \"O, you needn't preach to me. You wasn't the one that found it. If I'd truly been a thief, or if I hadn't been a thief, it would have been right for me to keep it, and perfectly proper, and not said a word to you, either; so there.\"  \"Jennie Vance, I'm going right out of this closet, and tell my grandma what you've said.\"  \"Wait, Dotty Dimple; let me get through talking. I meant to buy things for your grandmother with it. O, yes, I did--a silk dress, and cap, and shoes.\"  Dotty twirled her hair, and looked thoughtful.  \"Of course I did. Wouldn't it surprise her, when she wasn't expecting it? And Flyaway, too,--something for her. We wouldn't keep anything for ourselves, only just enough to buy clothes and such things as we really need.\"  Before Dotty had time to reply there was a loud scream from the parlor.  \"Fly is killed--she is killed!\" cried Dotty; but Jennie had presence of mind enough to tuck the bills into the neck of her dress.  \"Don't you tell anybody a word about it, Dotty. If you tell I'll do something awful to you. Do you hear?\"  Dotty heard, but did not answer. The fate of her cousin Flyaway seemed more important to her just then than all the bank-bills in the world.     CHAPTER VII.  THE WICKED GIRL.   Flyaway had only been climbing the outside of the staircase, and would have done very well, if some one had not rung the door-bell, and startled her so that she fell from the very top stair to the floor. It was feared, at first, that several bones were broken and her intellect injured for life; but after crying fifteen minutes, she seemed to feel nearly as well as before.  \"If ever a child was made of thistle-down it is Flyaway Clifford,\" said aunt Louise.  Still it was not thought best for her to fatigue herself that day by selling rags, and the wheelbarrow enterprise was put off until the next morning.  The person who rang the door-bell was Mrs. Vance's girl Susan, who called for Jennie to go home and try on a frock. Jennie did not return, and Dotty had a sense of uneasiness all day. The guilty secret of the three dollars weighed upon her mind. Should she, or should she not, tell her grandmother?  \"I don't know but Jennie would do something to my things if I told,\" thought she; \"but then I never promised a word. Here it is four o'clock. Who knows but she's gone and spent that money, and my grandmother never'll know what's 'come of it?\"  This possibility was very alarming. \"Jennie Vance doesn't seem to have any little whisper inside of _her_ heart, that ticks like a watch; but _I_ have. _My_ conscience pricks; so I know that perhaps it's my duty to go and tell.\"  Dotty drew herself up virtuously and looked in the glass. There she seemed to see an angelic little girl, whose only wish was to do just right--a little girl as much purer than Jennie Vance, as a lily is purer than a very ugly toadstool.  Well, Miss Dotty, there is some truth in the picture. Jennie is not a good child; but neither are you an angel. There is more wickedness in your proud little heart than you will ever begin to find out. And wait a minute. Who teaches you all you know of right and wrong? Is it your mother? Suppose she had died, as did Jennie's mamma, when you were a toddling baby?  There, that's all; you do not hear a word I say; and if you did, you would not heed, O, self-righteous Dotty Dimple!  Dotty ran up stairs to find her grandmother.  \"Grandma,\" whispered she, though there was no one else in the room; \"something dreadful has happened. You've lost three dollars!\"  \"What, dear?\"  \"O, you needn't look in your pocket. Jennie found 'em in the rag-bag, and tried to make me take half; but of course I never; and now she's run off with 'em!\"  \"Found three dollars in the rag-bag? I guess not.\"  \"Yes, grandma; for I saw her just as she was going to find em', in a pair of pockets. I should have seen 'em myself if she hadn't looked first.\"  \"Indeed! Is this really so? But she ought to have come and given them to me.\"  \"That was just what I told her, over and over, grandma, and over again. But she's a dreadful naughty girl, Jennie Vance is. If there's anything bad she can do, she goes right off and does it.\"  \"Hush, my child.\"  \"Yes'm, I won't say any more, _only_ I don't think my mother would like to have me play with little girls that take money out of rag-bags.\"  Dotty drew herself up again in a very stately way.  \"Jennie _said_ she was going to buy you a silk dress and so forth; but she does truly lie so, 'one to another,' that you can't believe her for certain, not half she says.\"  Grandma looked over her spectacles and through the window, as if trying to"]]]
