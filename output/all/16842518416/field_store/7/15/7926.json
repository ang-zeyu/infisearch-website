Colonel O'Leary, returning with the jugs, wanted to know what he'd missed. Blount told him.  \"Ha! She's been reading that thing of Stanley-Browne's,\" he said.  \"What's the matter with Stanley-Browne?\" Paula demanded.  \"Stanley-Browne is one author you can depend on,\" O'Leary assured her. \"If you read it in Stanley-Browne, it's wrong. You know, I don't think she's run into many Kragans. We ought to take her over and introduce her to King Kankad.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Von Schlichten allowed himself to be smitten by an idea. \"By Allah, so we had!\" he exclaimed. \"Look, you're going to Skilk, in the next week, aren't you? Well, do you think you could get all your end-jobs cleared up here and be ready to leave by 0800 Tuesday? That's four days from today.\"  \"I'm sure I could. Why?\"  \"Well, I'm going to Skilk, myself, with the armed troopship _Aldebaran_. We're stopping at King Kankad's Town to pick up a battalion of Kragan Rifles for duty at the Polar mines, where you're going. Suppose we leave here in my command-car, go to Kankad's Town, and wait there till the _Aldebaran_ gets in. That would give us about two to three hours. If you think the Kragans are 'pathetic cultural mongrels', what you'll see there will open your eyes. And I might add that the nearest Stanley-Browne ever came to seeing Kankad's Town was from the air, once, at a distance of more than four miles.\"  \"Well, general, I'll take you up,\" she said. \"But I warn you; if this is some scheme to indoctrinate me with the Ullr Company's side of the case and blind me to unjust exploitation of the natives here, I don't propagandize very easily.\"  \"Fair enough, as long as you don't let fear of being propagandized blind you to the good we're doing here, or impair your ability to observe and draw accurate conclusions. Just stay scientific about it and I'll be satisfied. Now, let's take time out for lubrication,\" he said, filling her glass and passing the jug.  Two hours and five cocktails later, they were still at the table, and they had taught Paula Quinton some twenty verses of _The Heathen Geeks, They Wear No Breeks_, including the four printable ones.         *       *       *       *       *  Four days later they stood together as the aircar passed over the Kraggork Swamps--pleasantly close together, von Schlichten realized. For the moment, he could almost forget the queer, intangible tension that had been growing steadily, and the feeling that things were nearing a breaking point of some kind.  Von Schlichten was scanning the horizon ahead. He pulled over a pair of fifty-power binoculars on a swinging arm and put them where she could use them.  \"Right ahead, there; just a little to the left. See that brown-gray spot on the landward edge of the swamp? That's King Kankad's Town. It's been there for thousands of years, and it's always been Kankad's Town. You might say, even the same Kankad. The Kragan kings have always provided their own heirs, by self-fertilization. The offspring is an exact duplicate of the single parent. The present Kankad speaks of his heir as 'Little Me,' which is a fairly accurate way of putting it.\"  He knew what she was seeing through the glasses--a massive butte of flint, jutting out into the swamp on the end of a sharp ridge, with a city on top of it. All the buildings were multi-storied, some piling upward from the top and some clinging to the sides. The high watchtower at the front now carried a telecast-director, aimed at an automatic relay-station on an unmanned orbiter two thousand miles off-planet.  \"They're either swamp-people who moved up onto that rock, or they're mountaineers who came out that far along the ridges and stopped,\" she said. \"Which?\"  \"Nobody's ever tried to find out. Maybe if you stay on Ullr long enough, you can. That ought to be good for about eight to ten honorary doctorates. And maybe a hundred sols a year in book royalties.\"  \"Maybe I'll just do that, general.... What's that, on the little island over there?\" she asked, shifting the glasses. \"A clump of flat-roofed buildings. Under a red-and-yellow danger-flag.\"  \"That's Dynamite Island; the Kragans have an explosives-plant there. They make nitroglycerine, like all the thalassic peoples; they also make TNT and propellants. Learned that from us, of course. They also manufacture most of their own firearms, some of them pretty extreme--up to 25-mm. for shoulder rifles. Don't ever fire one; it'd break every bone in your body.\"  \"Are they that much stronger than us?\"  He shook his head. \"Just denser; heavier. They're about equal to us in weight-lifting. They can't run, or jump, as well as we can. We often come out here for games with the Kragans, where the geeks can't watch us. And that reminds me--you're right about that being a term of derogation, because I don't believe I've ever knowingly spoken of a Kragan as a geek, and in fact they've picked up the word from us and apply it to all non-Kragans. But as I was saying, our baseball team has to give theirs a handicap, but their football team can beat the daylights out of ours. In a tug-of-war, we have to put two men on our end for every one of theirs. But they don't even try to play tennis with us.\"  \"Don't the other natives make their own firearms?\"  \"No, and we're not going to teach them how!\"         *       *       *       *       *  The aircar came in, circling slowly over the town on the big rock, and let down on the roof of the castle-like building from which the watchtower rose. There were a dozen or so individuals waiting for them--the five Terrans, three men and two women, from the telecast station, and the rest Kragans. One of these, dark-skinned but with speckles no darker than light amber, armed only with a heavy dagger, came over and clapped von Schlichten on the shoulder, grinning opalescently.  \"Greetings, Von!\" he squawked in Kragan, then, seeing Paula, switched over to the customary language of the Takkad Sea country. \"It makes happiness to see you. How long will you stay with us?\"  \"Till the _Aldebaran_ gets in from Konkrook, to pick up the Rifles,\" von Schlichten replied, in Lingua Terra. He looked at his watch. \"Two hours and a half.... Kankad, this is Paula Quinton; Paula, King Kankad.\"  He took out his geek-speaker and crammed it into his mouth. Before any other race on Ullr, that would have been the most shocking sort of bad manners, without the token-concealment of the handkerchief. Kankad took it as a matter of course. At some length, von Schlichten explained the nature of Paula's sociographic work, her connection with the Extraterrestrials' Rights Association, and her intention of going to the Arctic mines. Kankad nodded.  \"You were right,\" he said. \"I wouldn't have understood all that in your language. If I had read it, maybe, but not if I heard it.\" He put his upper right hand on Paula's shoulder and uttered a clicking approximation of her name. He turned and introduced another Kragan, about his own age, who wore the equipment and insignia of a Company native-major and was freshly painted with the Company emblem. \"This is Kormork. He and I have borne young to each other. Kormork, you watch over Paula Quinton.\" He managed, on the second try, to make it more or less recognizable. \"Bring her back safe. Or else find yourself a good place to hide.\"  Kankad introduced the rest of his people, and von Schlichten introduced the Terrans from the telecast-station. Then Kankad looked at the watch he was wearing on his lower left wrist.  \"We will have plenty of time, before the ship comes, to show Paula the town,\" he suggested. \"Von, you know better than I do what she would like to see.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He led the way past a pair of long 90-mm. guns to a stone stairway. Von Schlichten explained, as they went down, that the guns of King Kankad's town were the only artillery above 75-mm. on Ullr in non-Terran hands. They climbed into an open machine-gun carrier and strapped themselves to their seats, and for two hours King Kankad showed her the sights of the town. They visited the school, where young Kragans were being taught to read Lingua Terra and studied from textbooks printed in Johannesburg and Sydney and Buenos Aires. Kankad showed her the repair-shops, where two-score descendants of Kragan river-chieftains were working on contragravity equipment, under the supervision of a Scottish-Afrikaner and his Malay-Portuguese wife; the small-arms factory, where very respectable copies of Terran rifles and pistols and auto-weapons were being turned out; the machine-shop; the physics and chemistry labs; the hospital; the ammunition-loading plant; the battery of 155-mm. Long Toms, built in Kankad's own shops, which covered the road up the sloping rock-spine behind the city; the printing-shop and book-bindery; the observatory, with a big telescope and an ingenious orrery of the Beta Hydrae system; the nuclear-power plant, part of the original price for giving up brigandage.  Half an hour before the ship from Konkrook was due, they had arrived at the airport, where a gang of Kragans were clearing a berth for the _Aldebaran_. From somewhere, Kankad produced two cold bottles of Cape Town beer for Paula and von Schlichten, and a bowl of some boiling-hot black liquid for himself. Von Schlichten and Paula lit cigarettes; between sips of his bubbling hell brew, Kankad gnawed on the stalk of some swamp-plant. Paula seemed as much surprised at Kankad's disregard for the eating taboo as she had been at von Schlichten's open flouting of the convention of concealment when he had put in his geek-speaker.  \"This is the only place on Ullr where this happens,\" von Schlichten told her. \"Here, or in the field when Terran and Kragan soldiers are together. There aren't any taboos between us and the Kragans.\"  \"No,\" Kankad said. \"We cannot eat each"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19370"],["title","Ullr Uprising (#6)"],["body","' food, and because our bodies are different, we cannot be the fathers of each others' young. But we have been battle-comrades, and work-sharers, and we have learned from each other, my people more from yours than yours from mine. Before you came, my people were like children, shooting arrows at little animals on the beach, and climbing among the rocks at dare-me-and-I-do, and playing war with toy weapons. But we are growing up, and it will not be long before we will stand beside you, as the grown son stands beside his parent, and when that day comes, you will not be ashamed of us.\"         *       *       *       *       *  It was easy to forget that Kankad had four arms and a rubbery, quartz-speckled skin, and a face like a lizard's.  \"I want Little Me, when he's old enough to travel, to visit your world,\" Kankad said. \"And some of the other young ones. And when Little Me is old enough to take over the rule of our people, I would like to go to Terra, myself.\"  \"You're going,\" von Schlichten assured him. \"Some day, when I return, I'll see that you make the trip with me.\"  \"Wonderful, Von!\" Kankad was silent for a moment. When he spoke again, it was in Kragan, and quickly. \"If we live so long, old friend. There is trouble coming, though even my spies cannot find what that trouble is. And two days ago in Keegark, two of my people died trying to learn it. I ask you--be careful!\"  Then he switched hastily back to the language Paula could understand, apologizing. It gave von Schlichten time to wipe the worry from his face before she turned back to him, though it was worse news than he had expected. If Kankad thought things were bad enough to add his own spies to those of the Company, things couldn't be much worse. In fact, anything that brought whatever it was out into the open would be better.  He was still fretting over it as they said their good-byes to Kankad and boarded the _Aldebaran_ for Skilk.     V   The last clatter of silverware and dishes ceased as the native servants finished clearing the table. There was a remaining clatter of cups and saucers; liqueur-glasses tinkled, and an occasional cigarette-lighter clicked. At the head table, the voices seemed louder.  \"... don't like it a millisol's worth,\" Brigadier-General Barney Mordkovitz, the Skilk military CO, was saying to the lady on his right. \"They're too confounded meek. Nowadays, nobody yells '_Znidd suddabit!_' at you. They just stand and look at you like a farmer looking at a turkey the week before Christmas, and that I don't like!\"  \"Oh, bosh!\" Jules Keaveney, the Skilk Resident-Agent, at the head of the table, exclaimed. \"If they don't bow and scrape to you and get off the sidewalk to let you pass, you say they're insolent and need a lesson. If they do, you say they're plotting insurrection.\"  \"What I said,\" Mordkovitz repeated, \"was that I expect a certain amount of disorder, and a certain minimum show of hostility toward us from some of these geeks, to conform to what I know to be our unpopularity with many of them. When I don't find it, I want to know why.\"  \"I'm inclined,\" von Schlichten came to his subordinate's support, \"to agree. This sudden absence of overt hostility is disquieting. Colonel Cheng-Li,\" he called on the local Intelligence officer and Constabulary chief. \"This fellow Rakkeed was here, about a month ago. Was there any noticeable disorder at that time? Anti-Terran demonstrations, attacks on Company property or personnel, shooting at aircars, that sort of thing?\"  \"No more than usual, general. In fact, it was when Rakkeed came here that the condition General Mordkovitz was speaking of began to become conspicuous.\"  Von Schlichten nodded. \"And I might say that Lieutenant-Governor Blount has reported from Keegark, where he is now, that the same unnatural absence of hostility exists there.\"  \"Well, of course, general,\" Keaveney said patronizingly, \"King Orgzild has things under pretty tight control at Keegark. He'd not allow a few fanatics to do anything to prejudice these spaceport negotiations.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"I wonder if the idea back of that spaceport proposition isn't to get us concentrated at Keegark, where Orgzild could wipe us all out in one surprise blow,\" somebody down the table suggested, and others nodded.  \"Oh, Orgzild wouldn't be crazy enough to try anything like that,\" Commander Dirk Prinsloo, of the _Aldebaran_, declared. \"He'd get away with it for just twelve months--the time it would take to get the news to Terra and for a Federation Space Navy task-force to get here. And then, there'd be little bits of radioactive geek floating around this system as far out as the orbit of Beta Hydrae VII.\"  \"That's quite true,\" von Schlichten agreed. \"The point is, does Orgzild know it? I doubt if he even believes there is a Terra.\"  \"Then where in Space does he think we come from?\" Keaveney demanded.  \"I believe he thinks Niflheim is our home world,\" von Schlichten replied. \"Or, rather, the string of orbiters and artificial satellites around Niflheim. Where he thinks Niflheim is, I wouldn't even try to guess.\"  \"Yes. After he'd wiped us out, he might even consider the idea of an invasion of Niflheim with captured contragravity ships,\" Hideyoshi O'Leary chuckled. \"That would be a big laugh--if any of us were alive, then, to do any laughing.\"  \"You don't really believe that, general?\" Keaveney asked. His tone was still derisive, but under the derision was uncertainty. After all, von Schlichten had been on Ullr for fifteen years, to his two.  \"Any question of geek psychology is wide open as far as I'm concerned; the longer I stay here, the less I understand it.\" Von Schlichten finished his brandy and got out cigarette-case and lighter. \"I have an idea of the sort of garbled reports these spies of his who spend a year on Niflheim as laborers bring back.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"You know the line Rakkeed's been taking, of course,\" Colonel Cheng-Li put in. \"He as much as says that Niflheim's our home, and that the farms where we raise food, here, and those evergreen plantings on Konk Isthmus and between here and Grank are the beginning of an attempt to drive all native life from this planet and make it over for ourselves.\"  \"And that savage didn't think an idea like that up for himself; he got it from somebody like Orgzild,\" the black-bearded brigadier-general added. \"You know, the main base off Niflheim is practically self-supporting, with hyproponic-gardens and animal-tissue culture vats. And it's enough bigger than one of the _City_ ships to pass for a little world. Yes; somebody like Orgzild, or King Firkked, here, could easily pick up the idea that that's our home planet.\"  \"The Company ought to let us stockpile nuclear weapons here, just to be on the safe side,\" another officer, farther down the table, said.  \"Well, I'm not exactly in favor of that,\" von Schlichten replied. \"It's the same principle as not allowing guards who have to go in among the convicts to carry firearms. If somebody like Orgzild got hold of a nuclear bomb, even a little old First-Century H-bomb, he could use it for a model and construct a hundred like it, with all the plutonium we've been handing out for power reactors. And there are too few of us, and we're concentrated in too few places, to last long if that happened. What this planet needs, though, is a visit by a fifty-odd-ship task-force of the Space Navy, just to show the geeks what we have back of us. After a show like that, there'd be a lot less _znidd suddabit_ around here.\"  \"General, I deplore that sort of talk,\" Keaveney said. \"I hear too much of this mailed-fist-and-rattling-sabre stuff from some of the junior officers here, without your giving countenance and encouragement to it. We're here to earn dividends for the stockholders of the Ullr Company, and we can only do that by gaining the friendship, respect and confidence of the natives....\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Mr. Keaveney,\" Paula Quinton spoke. \"I doubt if even you would seriously accuse the Extraterrestrials Rights Association of favoring what you call a mailed fist and rattling sabre policy. We've done everything in our power to help these people, and if anybody should have their friendship, we should. Well, only five days ago, in Konkrook, Mr. Mohammed Ferriera and I were attacked by a mob, our native aircar driver was murdered, and if it hadn't been for General von Schlichten and his soldiers, we'd have lost our own lives. Mr. Ferriera is still hospitalized as a result of injuries he received. It seems that General von Schlichten and his Kragans aren't trying to get friendship and confidence; they're willing to settle for respect, in the only way they can get it--by hitting harder and quicker than the natives can.\"  Somebody down the table--one of the military, of course--said, \"Hear, hear!\" Von Schlichten came as close as a man wearing a monocle can to winking at Paula. Good girl, he thought; she's started playing on the Army team, and about time!  \"Well, of course....\" Keaveney began. Then he stopped, as a Terran sergeant came up to the table and bent over Barney Mordkovitz' shoulder, whispering urgently. The black-bearded brigadier rose immediately, taking his belt from the back of his chair and putting it on. Motioning the sergeant to accompany, he spoke briefly to Keaveney and then came around the table to where von Schlichten sat, the Resident-Agent accompanying him.  \"Message just came in from Konkrook, general,\" he said softly. \"Governor Harrington's dead.\"  It took von Schlichten all of a second to grasp what had been said. \"Good God! When? How?\"  \"Here's all we know, sir,\" the sergeant said, giving him a radioprint slip. \"Came in ten minutes ago.\"  It was an all-station priority telecast. Governor-General Harrington had died suddenly, in his room, at 2210; there were no details. He glanced at his watch; it was 2243. Konkrook and Skilk were in the"]]]
