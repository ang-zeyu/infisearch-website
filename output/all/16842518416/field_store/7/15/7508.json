It went around the contact team; when it came to him, he returned it to point of origin.  \"I don't think they get it at all,\" he added in a whisper.  \"They ought to,\" Lillian said. \"Every language has a word for self and a word for person-addressed.\"  \"Well, look at them,\" Karl Dorver invited. \"Six different opinions about what we mean, and now the band's starting an argument of their own.\"  \"Phase Two-A,\" Lillian said firmly, stepping forward. She pointed to herself. \"Me--Lillian Ransby. Lillian Ransby--me _name_. You--_name_?  \"_Bwoooo!_\" the spokesman screamed in horror, clutching his staff as though to shield it from profanation. The others howled like a hound-pack at a full moon, except one of the short-tunic boys, who was slapping himself on the head with both hands and yodeling. The horn-crew hastily swung their piece around at the Terrans, pumping frantically.  \"What do you suppose I said?\" Lillian asked.  \"Oh, something like, 'Curse your gods, death to your king, and spit in your mother's face,' I suppose.\"  \"Let me try it,\" Gofredo said.  The little Marine major went through the same routine. At his first word, the uproar stopped; before he was through, the natives' faces were sagging and crumbling into expressions of utter and heartbroken grief.  \"It's not as bad as all that, is it?\" he said. \"You try it, Mark.\"  \"Me ... Mark ... Howell....\" They looked bewildered.  \"Let's try objects, and play-acting,\" Lillian suggested. \"They're farmers; they ought to have a word for water.\"         *       *       *       *       *  They spent almost an hour at it. They poured out two gallons of water, pretended to be thirsty, gave each other drinks. The natives simply couldn't agree on the word, in their own language, for water. That or else they missed the point of the whole act. They tried fire, next. The efficiency of a steel hatchet was impressive, and so was the sudden flame of a pocket-lighter, but no word for fire emerged, either.  \"Ah, to Niflheim with it!\" Luis Gofredo cried in exasperation. \"We're getting nowhere at five times light speed. Give them their presents and send them home, Paul.\"  \"Sheath-knives; they'll have to be shown how sharp they are,\" he suggested. \"Red bandannas. And costume jewelry.\"  \"How about something to eat, Bennet?\" Meillard asked Fayon.  \"Extee Three, and C-H trade candy,\" Fayon said. Field Ration, Extraterrestrial Service, Type Three, could be eaten by anything with a carbon-hydrogen metabolism, and so could the trade candy. \"Nothing else, though, till we have some idea what goes on inside them.\"  Dorver thought the six members of the delegation would be persons of special consequence, and should have something extra. That was probably so. Dorver was as quick to pick up clues to an alien social order as he was, himself, to deduce a culture pattern from a few artifacts. He and Lillian went back to the landing craft to collect the presents.  Everybody, horn-detail, armed guard and all, got one ten-inch bowie knife and sheath, a red bandanna neckcloth, and a piece of flashy junk jewelry. The (town council? prominent citizens? or what?) also received a colored table-spread apiece; these were draped over their shoulders and fastened with two-inch plastic pins advertising the candidacy of somebody for President of the Federation Member Republic of Venus a couple of elections ago. They all looked woebegone about it; that would be their expression of joy. Different type nerves and different facial musculature, Fayon thought. As soon as they sampled the Extee Three and candy, they looked crushed under all the sorrows of the galaxy.  By pantomime and pointing to the sun, Meillard managed to inform them that the next day, when the sun was in the same position, the Terrans would visit their village, bringing more gifts. The natives were quite agreeable, but Meillard was disgruntled that he had to use sign-talk. The natives started off toward the village on the mound, munching Extee Three and trying out their new knives. This time tomorrow, half of them would have bandaged thumbs.         *       *       *       *       *  The Marine riflemen and submachine-gunners were coming in, slinging their weapons and lighting cigarettes. A couple of Navy technicians were getting a snooper--a thing shaped like a short-tailed tadpole, six feet long by three at the widest, fitted with visible-light and infra-red screen pickups and crammed with detection instruments--ready to relieve the combat car over the village. The contact team crowded into the Number One landing craft, which had been fitted out as a temporary headquarters. Prefab-hut elements were already being unloaded from the other craft.  Everybody felt that a drink was in order, even if it was two hours short of cocktail time. They carried bottles and glasses and ice to the front of the landing craft and sat down in front of the battery of view and communication screens. The central screen was a two-way, tuned to one in the officers' lounge aboard the _Hubert Penrose_, two hundred miles above. In it, also provided with drinks, were Captain Guy Vindinho and two other Navy officers, and a Marine captain in shipboard blues. Like Gofredo, Vindinho must have gotten into the Service on tiptoe; he had a bald dome and a red beard, and he always looked as though he were gloating because nobody knew that his name was really Rumplestiltskin. He had been watching the contact by screen. He lifted his glass toward Meillard.  \"Over the hump, Paul?\"  Meillard raised his drink to Vindinho. \"Over the first one. There's a whole string of them ahead. At least, we sent them away happy. I hope.\"  \"You're going to make permanent camp where you are now?\" one of the other officers asked. Lieutenant-Commander Dave Questell; ground engineering and construction officer. \"What do you need?\"  There were two viewscreens from pickups aboard the 2500-foot battle cruiser. One, at ten-power magnification, gave a maplike view of the broad valley and the uplands and mountain foothills to the south. It was only by tracing the course of the main river and its tributaries that they could find the tiny spot of the native village, and they couldn't see the landing craft at all. The other, at a hundred power, showed the oblong mound, with the village on its flat top, little dots around a circular central plaza. They could see the two turtle-shaped landing-craft, and the combat car, that had been circling over the mound, landing beside them, and, sometimes, a glint of sunlight from the snooper that had taken its place.  The snooper was also transmitting in, to another screen, from two hundred feet above the village. From the sound outlet came an incessant gibber of native voices. There were over a hundred houses, all small and square, with pyramidal roofs. On the end of the mound toward the Terran camp, animals of at least four different species were crowded, cattle that had been herded up from the meadows at the first alarm. The open circle in the middle of the village was crowded, and more natives lined the low palisade along the edge of the mound.  \"Well, we're going to stay here till we learn the language,\" Meillard was saying. \"This is the best place for it. It's completely isolated, forests on both sides, and seventy miles to the nearest other village. If we're careful, we can stay here as long as we want to and nobody'll find out about us. Then, after we can talk with these people, we'll go to the big town.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The big town was two hundred and fifty miles down the valley, at the forks of the main river, a veritable metropolis of almost three thousand people. That was where the treaty would have to be negotiated.  [Illustration: \"... But no two of them speak the same language!\"]  \"You'll want more huts. You'll want a water tank, and a pipeline to that stream below you, and a pump,\" Questell said. \"You think a month?\"  Meillard looked at Lillian Ransby. \"What do you think?\"  \"_Poodly-doodly-oodly-foodle_,\" she said. \"You saw how far we didn't get this afternoon. All we found out was that none of the standard procedures work at all.\" She made a tossing gesture over her shoulder. \"There goes the book; we have to do it off the cuff from here.\"  \"Suppose we make another landing, back in the mountains, say two or three hundred miles south of you,\" Vindinho said. \"It's not right to keep the rest aboard two hundred miles off planet, and you won't be wanting liberty parties coming down where you are.\"  \"The country over there looks uninhabited,\" Meillard said. \"No villages, anyhow. That wouldn't hurt, at all.\"  \"Well, it'll suit me,\" Charley Loughran, the xeno-naturalist, said. \"I want a chance to study the life-forms in a state of nature.\"  Vindinho nodded. \"Luis, do you anticipate any trouble with this crowd here?\" he asked.  \"How about it, Mark? What do they look like to you? Warlike?\"  \"No.\" He stated the opinion he had formed. \"I had a close look at their weapons when they came in for their presents. Hunting arms. Most of the spears have cross-guards, usually wooden, lashed on, to prevent a wounded animal from running up the spear-shaft at the hunter. They made boar-spears like that on Terra a thousand years ago. Maybe they have to fight raiding parties from the hills once in a while, but not often enough for them to develop special fighting weapons or techniques.\"  \"Their village is fortified,\" Meillard mentioned.  \"I question that,\" Gofredo differed. \"There won't be more than a total of five hundred there; call that a fighting strength of two hundred, to defend a twenty-five-hundred-meter perimeter, with woodchoppers' axes and bows and spears. If you notice, there's no wall around the village itself. That palisade is just a fence.\"  \"Why would they mound the village up?\" Questell, in the screen wondered. \"You don't think the river gets up that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19076"],["title","Naudsonce (#2)"],["body","igh, do you? Because if it does--\"  Schallenmacher shook his head. \"There just isn't enough watershed, and there's too much valley. I'll be very much surprised if that stream, there\"--he nodded at the hundred-power screen--\"ever gets more than six inches over the bank.\"  \"I don't know what those houses are built of. This is all alluvial country; building stone would be almost unobtainable. I don't see anything like a brick kiln. I don't see any evidence of irrigation, either, so there must be plenty of rainfall. If they use adobe, or sun-dried brick, houses would start to crumble in a few years, and they would be pulled down and the rubble shoved aside to make room for a new house. The village has been rising on its own ruins, probably shifting back and forth from one end of that mound to the other.\"  \"If that's it, they've been there a long time,\" Karl Dorver said. \"And how far have they advanced?\"  \"Early bronze; I'll bet they still use a lot of stone implements. Pre-dynastic Egypt, or very early Tigris-Euphrates, in Terran terms. I can't see any evidence that they have the wheel. They have draft animals; when we were coming down, I saw a few of them pulling pole travoises. I'd say they've been farming for a long time. They have quite a diversity of crops, and I suspect that they have some idea of crop-rotation. I'm amazed at their musical instruments; they seem to have put more skill into making them than anything else. I'm going to take a jeep, while they're all in the village, and have a look around the fields, now.\"  Charley Loughran went along for specimens, and, for the ride, Lillian Ransby. Most of his guesses, he found, had been correct. He found a number of pole travoises, from which the animals had been unhitched in the first panic when the landing craft had been coming down. Some of them had big baskets permanently attached. There were drag-marks everywhere in the soft ground, but not a single wheel track. He found one plow, cunningly put together with wooden pegs and rawhide lashings; the point was stone, and it would only score a narrow groove, not a proper furrow. It was, however, fitted with a big bronze ring to which a draft animal could be hitched. Most of the cultivation seemed to have been done with spades and hoes. He found a couple of each, bronze, cast flat in an open-top mold. They hadn't learned to make composite molds.  There was an even wider variety of crops than he had expected: two cereals, a number of different root-plants, and a lot of different legumes, and things like tomatoes and pumpkins.  \"Bet these people had a pretty good life, here--before the Terrans came,\" Charley observed.  \"Don't say that in front of Paul,\" Lillian warned. \"He has enough to worry about now, without starting him on whether we'll do these people more harm than good.\"  Two more landing craft had come down from the _Hubert Penrose_; they found Dave Questell superintending the unloading of more prefab-huts, and two were already up that had been brought down with the first landing.  A name for the planet had also arrived.  \"Svantovit,\" Karl Dorver told him. \"Principal god of the Baltic Slavs, about three thousand years ago. Guy Vindinho dug it out of the 'Encyclopedia of Mythology.' Svantovit was represented as holding a bow in one hand and a horn in the other.\"  \"Well, that fits. What will we call the natives; Svantovitians, or Svantovese?\"  \"Well, Paul wanted to call them Svantovese, but Luis persuaded him to call them Svants. He said everybody'd call them that, anyhow, so we might as well make it official from the start.\"  \"We can call the language Svantovese,\" Lillian decided. \"After dinner, I am going to start playing back recordings and running off audiovisuals. I will be so happy to know that I have a name for what I'm studying. Probably be all I will know.\"         *       *       *       *       *  After dinner, he and Karl and Paul went into a huddle on what sort of gifts to give the natives, and the advisability of trading with them, and for what. Nothing too far in advance of their present culture level. Wheels; they could be made in the fabricating shop aboard the ship.  \"You know, it's odd,\" Karl Dorver said. \"These people here have never seen a wheel, and, except in documentary or historical-drama films, neither have a lot of Terrans.\"  That was true. As a means of transportation, the wheel had been completely obsolete since the development of contragravity, six centuries ago. Well, a lot of Terrans in the Year Zero had never seen a suit of armor, or an harquebus, or even a tinder box or a spinning wheel.  Wheelbarrows; now there was something they'd find useful. He screened Max Milzer, in charge of the fabricating and repair shops on the ship. Max had never even heard of a wheelbarrow.  \"I can make them up, Mark; better send me some drawings, though. Did you just invent it?\"  \"As far as I know, a man named Leonardo da Vinci invented it, in the Sixth Century Pre-Atomic. How soon can you get me half a dozen of them?\"  \"Well, let's see. Welded sheet metal, and pipe for the frame and handles. I'll have some of them for you by noon tomorrow. Now, about hoes; how tall are these people, and how long are their arms, and how far can they stoop over?\"         *       *       *       *       *  They were all up late, that night. So were the Svants; there was a fire burning in the middle of the village, and watch-fires along the edge of the mound. Luis Gofredo was just as distrustful of them as they were of the Terrans; he kept the camp lighted, a strong guard on the alert, and the area of darkness beyond infra red lighted and covered by photoelectric sentries on the ground and snoopers in the air. Like Paul Meillard, Luis Gofredo was a worrier and a pessimist. Everything happened for the worst in this worst of all possible galaxies, and if anything could conceivably go wrong, it infallibly would. That was probably why he was still alive and had never had a command massacred.  The wheelbarrows, four of them, came down from the ship by midmorning. With them came a grindstone, a couple of crosscut saws, and a lot of picks and shovels and axes, and cases of sheath knives and mess gear and miscellaneous trade goods, including a lot of the empty wine and whisky bottles that had been hoarded for the past four years.  At lunch, the talk was almost exclusively about the language problem. Lillian Ransby, who had not gotten to sleep before sunrise and had just gotten up, was discouraged.  \"I don't know what we're going to do next,\" she admitted. \"Glenn Orent and Anna and I were on it all night, and we're nowhere. We have about a hundred wordlike sounds isolated, and twenty or so are used repeatedly, and we can't assign a meaning to any of them. And none of the Svants ever reacted the same way twice to anything we said to them. There's just no one-to-one relationship anywhere.\"  \"I'm beginning to doubt they have a language,\" the Navy intelligence officer said. \"Sure, they make a lot of vocal noise. So do chipmunks.\"  \"They have to have a language,\" Anna de Jong declared. \"No sapient thought is possible without verbalization.\"  \"Well, no society like that is possible without some means of communication,\" Karl Dorver supported her from the other flank. He seemed to have made that point before. \"You know,\" he added, \"I'm beginning to wonder if it mightn't be telepathy.\"  He evidently hadn't suggested that before. The others looked at him in surprise. Anna started to say, \"Oh, I doubt if--\" and then stopped.  \"I know, the race of telepaths is an old gimmick that's been used in new-planet adventure stories for centuries, but maybe we've finally found one.\"  \"I don't like it, Karl,\" Loughran said. \"If they're telepaths, why don't they understand us? And if they're telepaths, why do they talk at all? And you can't convince me that this boodly-oodly-doodle of theirs isn't talking.\"  \"Well, our neural structure and theirs won't be nearly alike,\" Fayon said. \"I know, this analogy between telepathy and radio is full of holes, but it's good enough for this. Our wave length can't be picked up with their sets.\"  \"The deuce it can't,\" Gofredo contradicted. \"I've been bothered about that from the beginning. These people act as though they got meaning from us. Not the meaning we intend, but some meaning. When Paul made the gobbledygook speech, they all reacted in the same way--frightened, and then defensive. The you-me routine simply bewildered them, as we'd be at a set of semantically lucid but self-contradictory statements. When Lillian tried to introduce herself, they were shocked and horrified....\"  \"It looked to me like actual physical disgust,\" Anna interpolated.  \"When I tried it, they acted like a lot of puppies being petted, and when Mark tried it, they were simply baffled. I watched Mark explaining that steel knives were dangerously sharp; they got the demonstration, but when he tried to tie words onto it, it threw them completely.\"  \"ALL RIGHT. Pass that,\" Loughran conceded. \"But if they have telepathy, why do they use spoken words?\"  \"Oh, I can answer that,\" Anna said. \"Say they communicated by speech originally, and developed their telepathic faculty slowly and without realizing it. They'd go on using speech, and since the message would be received telepathically ahead of the spoken message, nobody would pay any attention to the words as such. Everybody would have a spoken language of his own; it would be sort of the instrumental accompaniment to the song.\"  \"Some of them don't bother speaking,\" Karl nodded. \"They just toot.\"  \"I'll buy that, right away,\" Loughran agreed. \"In mating, or in group-danger situations, telepathy would be a race-survival characteristic. It would be selected for genetically, and the non-gifted strains would tend to die out.\"  It wouldn't do. It wouldn't do at all. He said so.  \"Look at their technology. We either have a young race, just emerged from savagery, or an old, stagnant race."]]]
