SCENE IV   _The Summit._  _On the snow on the pinnacle of Aether Mountain, with only bright blue sky all round and everywhere, recline_ QUEEN ZOOMZOOMARMA _and the_ PRINCE OF ZOON.  THE QUEEN: You had known no love before, First of a Hundred?  PRINCE OF ZOON: There is no love on earth, O Queen of all.  QUEEN: Only here.  ZOON: Pure love is only here on this peak lonely in heaven.  QUEEN: Would you love me elsewhere if we went from here?  ZOON: But we will never go from here.  QUEEN: No, we will never leave it.  ZOON: Lady, look down. (_She looks._) The earth is sorrowful. (_She sighs._) Cares. Cares. All over the wide surface we can see are troubles; troubles far off and grey, that harm not Aether Mountain.  QUEEN: It looks a long way off and long ago.  ZOON (_wonderingly_): Only to-day we came to Aether Mountain.  QUEEN: Only to-day?  ZOON: We crossed a gulf of time.  QUEEN: It lies below us, all drowsy with years.  ZOON: Lady, here is your home, this peak that has entered heaven. Let us never leave your home.  QUEEN: I knew not until to-day of Aether Mountain. None had told me.  ZOON: Knew you never, lady, of love?  QUEEN: None had told me.  ZOON: This is your home; not Earth; no golden palace. Reign here alone, not knowing the cares of men, without yesterday or to-morrow, untroubled by history or council.  QUEEN: Yes, yes, we will return no more.  ZOON: See, lady, see the Earth. Is it not as a dream just faded?  QUEEN: It is dim indeed, grey and dream-like.  ZOON: It is the Earth we knew.  QUEEN: It is all dream-like.  ZOON: It is gone; we can dimly see it.  QUEEN: Was it a dream?  ZOON: Perhaps. It is gone now and does not matter.  QUEEN: Poor Earth. I hope it was real.  ZOON (_seizing her hand_): Oh, Zoomzoomarma, say not you hope that Earth was real. It is gone now. See; it is so far away. Sigh not for Earth, oh lady, sigh not for Earth.  QUEEN: Why not, King of Aether Mountain?  ZOON: Because when you sigh for tiny things I tremble for your love. See how faint and small it is and how far away.  QUEEN: I do not sigh for Earth, King of the Mountain. I only wish it well.  ZOON: Oh, wish it not well, lady.  QUEEN: Let us wish the poor Earth well.  ZOON: No, lady, no. Be with me always wholly, living not partly in dreams. There is no Earth. It is but a dream that left us. See, see (_pointing down_) it is a dim dream.  QUEEN (_looking down_): The people move there still. See, there is Prince Ximenung. Something down there seems almost unlike dreams.  ZOON: No, lady, it cannot be.  QUEEN: How know you, Lord of the Mountain?  ZOON: It was too unreal for life. Love was not there. Surely it was a dream.  QUEEN: Yes, I knew not love in the golden palace of Zoorm.  ZOON: Then indeed it was unreal, Golden Lady. Forget the dream of Earth.  QUEEN: If love be real ...  ZOON: Can you doubt it?  QUEEN: No. It was a dream. Just now I dreamt it. Are dreams bad, my Prince?  ZOON: No. They are just dreams.  QUEEN: We will think of dreams no more.  ZOON: This is where love is, and here only. We should not dream too much or think of dreams, because the place is holy.  QUEEN: Is love here only, darling?  ZOON: Here only, Golden Queen. Do any others elsewhere love as we.  QUEEN: No, I think not.  ZOON: Then how can pure love be elsewhere?  QUEEN: It is true.  ZOON: On this clear peak that just enters Heaven love is and only here. The rest is dreams.  QUEEN: Could we awake from love and find Earth true?  ZOON: No, no, no. Sweet Lady, let not such fancies alarm you.  QUEEN: And yet folks wake from dreams. It would be terrible.  ZOON: No, no, there are things too real for dreams. You cannot waken from love. Dreams are of fantastic things, things fanciful and weak, and things confused and intricate like Earth. When you think of them in your dreams you see their unreality. But if love were not real what could there be to wake to.  QUEEN: True. How wise you are. It was but a fancy that troubled me. (_Looking down._) It was one of those dreams at dawn. It is faint and far-off now.  ZOON: Will you love me for ever, Golden Queen?  QUEEN: For ever. Why not? You will love me for ever?  ZOON: For ever. I cannot help it.  QUEEN: Let us look at the dream far off, in the dimness our thoughts have forsaken.  ZOON: Aye, let us look. It was a sad dream somewhat; and yet upon this peak where all is love all that we see seems happy.  QUEEN: See the dream there. Look at those. They seem to walk dreamily as they walk in the dream.  ZOON: It is because they have not love, which is only here.  QUEEN: Look! Look at those dreamers in the dream.  ZOON: They are running.  QUEEN: Oh! Look!  ZOON: They are pursued.  QUEEN: The brown ones are pursuing them with spears.  ZOON: It is Prince Meliflor, Prince Moomoomon, Prince Ximenung that run in the dream. And the Prince of Huz. The brown men are close.  QUEEN: The brown ones are overtaking them.  ZOON: Yes, they are closer.  QUEEN: Look! Prince Ximenung!  ZOON: Yes, he is dead in the dream.  QUEEN: The Prince of Huz?  ZOON: Speared.  QUEEN: Still, still they are killing them.  ZOON: It is all the Hundred Princes.  QUEEN: They are killing them all.  ZOON: A sad sight once.  QUEEN: Once?  ZOON: I should have wept once.  QUEEN: It is so far off now.  ZOON: It is so far, far off. We can only feel joy upon this holy mountain.  QUEEN: Only joy. (_He sighs as he looks._) Look! (_He sighs again._)  ZOON: There falls the poor Prince Meliflor.  QUEEN: How huge a thrust it was with the great spear.  ZOON: He is dead.  QUEEN: Are you not happy?  ZOON: Yes.  QUEEN: In your voice there seemed to sound some far-off thing. Some strange thing. Was it sorrow?  ZOON: No; we are too high; sorrow cannot come. No grief can touch us here, no woe drift up to us from the woes of Earth.  QUEEN: I thought there was some strange thing in your voice, like sorrows we have dreamed.  ZOON: No, Golden Queen. Those fancied sorrows of dreams cannot touch reality.  QUEEN: You will never be sorry we have woken and left the dream of Earth?  ZOON: No, glorious lady; nothing can bring me trouble ever again.  QUEEN: Not even I?  ZOON: Never you, my Golden Zoomzoomarma, for on this sacred peak where there is only love you cannot.  QUEEN: We will dwell here for ever in endless joy.  ZOON (_looking down_): All dead now, all the Princes.  QUEEN: Turn, my Prince, from the dream of Earth, lest trouble come up from it.  ZOON: It cannot drift up here; yet we will turn from the dream.  QUEEN: Let us think of endless joy upon the edge of heaven.  ZOON: Yes, Queen; for ever in reality while all else dream away.  QUEEN: It is the years that make them drowsy. They dream to dream the years away. Time cannot reach so high as here, the years are far below us.  ZOON: Far below us, making a dream and troubling it.  QUEEN: They do not know in the dream that only love is real.  ZOON: If time could reach us here we should pass, too. Nothing is real where time is.  QUEEN: How shall we spend the calm that time does not vex, together here for ever?  ZOON: Holding your hand. (_She gives it._) And kissing it often in the calm of eternity. Sometimes watching, a moment, the dream go by; then kissing your hand again all in eternity.  QUEEN: And never wearying?  ZOON: Not while eternity lingers here in heaven.  QUEEN: Thus we will live until the dream goes by and Earth has faded under Aether Mountain.  ZOON: And then we shall watch the calm of Eternity.  QUEEN: And you will still kiss my hand at times.  ZOON: Yes, while eternity wiles Heaven away.  QUEEN: The silence is like music on Aether Mountain.

Music had to be made and then soon passed trembling away. Here all things always are as the desire of Earth, Earth's desire that groped among fantasies finding them false.  QUEEN: Let us forget the dream.  ZOON (_kissing her hand_): I have forgotten for ever.  QUEEN: Ah!  ZOON: What trouble has drifted up to you from Earth?  QUEEN: An old saying.  ZOON: It was said in the dream.  QUEEN: It was true!  [_She snatches her hand away._  Ah, I remember it. It was true.  ZOON: All is unreal but love, my crownéd Zoomzoomarma. Where there was not love it cannot have been true.  [_He tries to take her hand again._  QUEEN: Touch not my hand. It was true.  ZOON: What was the saying heard in the dream of Earth that was true?  QUEEN: None is worthy to touch my hand; no, none.  ZOON: By Aether Mountain, I will kiss your hand again! What is this saying out of a dream that dares deny reality?  QUEEN: It is true! Oh, it is true!  ZOON: Out of that hurried, aimless dream, that knows not its own end even, you have brought me a saying and say it against love.  QUEEN: I say it is true!  ZOON: Nothing is true against love. Fate only is greater.  QUEEN: Then it is Fate.  ZOON: Against Fate I will kiss your hand again.  QUEEN: None are worthy. No, none.  [_She draws her rapier._  ZOON: I will kiss your hand again.  QUEEN: It must be this (_pointing with rapier_) for none are worthy.  ZOON: Though it be death I kiss your hand again.  QUEEN: It is certain death.  ZOON: Oh, Zoomzoomarma, forget that troubled dream, and things said by dreamers, while I kiss your hand in heaven if only once again.  QUEEN: None are worthy. It is death. None are worthy. None.  ZOON: Though it be death, yet once again upon Aether Mountain in heaven I kiss your hand.  QUEEN: Away! It is death. Upon the word of a Queen.

CHEEZO   _DRAMATIS PERSONÆ_  SLADDER, _a successful man_. SPLURGE, _his secretary and publicity agent_. THE REV. CHARLES HIPPANTHIGH. BUTLER. MRS. SLADDER. ERMYNTRUDE SLADDER.    SCENE  _The big house that_ SLADDER _has bought in the country._ SLADDER'S _study. Large French window opening on to a lawn._  _Time: Now._  SLADDER'S _daughter is seated in an armchair tapping on the arm of it a little impatiently._  _The door opens very cautiously, and the head of_ MRS. SLADDER _is put round it._  MRS. SLADDER: O, Ermyntrude. Whatever are you doing here?  ERMYNTRUDE: I wanted to speak to father, mother.  MRS. SLADDER: But you mustn't come in here. We mustn't disturb father.  ERMYNTRUDE: I want to speak to father.  MRS. SLADDER: Whatever about, Ermyntrude?  ERMYNTRUDE (_taps the arm of the chair_): O, nothing, mother. Only about that idea of his.  MRS. SLADDER: What idea, child?  ERMYNTRUDE: O, that idea he had, that--er--I was some day to marry a duke.  MRS. SLADDER: And why shouldn't you marry a duke, child? I am sure father would make it worth his while.  ERMYNTRUDE: O well, I don't think I want to, mother.  MRS. SLADDER: But why not, Ermyntrude?  ERMYNTRUDE: O well, you know Mr. Jones----  MRS. SLADDER: That good man!  ERMYNTRUDE: ----did say that dukes were no good, mother. They oppress the poor, I think he said.  MRS. SLADDER: Very true.  ERMYNTRUDE: Well, there you are.  MRS. SLADDER: Yes, yes, of course. At the same time, father had rather set his heart on it. You wouldn't have any other reason now, child, would you?  ERMYNTRUDE: What more do you want, mother? Mr. Jones is a Cabinet Minister; he must know what he's talking about.  MRS. SLADDER: Yes, yes.  ERMYNTRUDE: And I hear he's going to get a peerage.  MRS. SLADDER (_with enthusiasm_): Well, I'm sure he deserves it. But child, you mustn't talk to father to-day. You mustn't stay here any longer.  ERMYNTRUDE: But why not, mother?  MRS. SLADDER: Well, child, he's been smoking one of those big cigars again, and he's absent-like. And he's been talking a good deal with Mr. Splurge. It's one of his great days, I think, Ermyntrude. I feel sure it is. One of those days that has given us all this money, and all these fine houses, with all those little birds that his gentlemen friends shoot. He has an idea!  ERMYNTRUDE: O, mother, do you really think so?  MRS. SLADDER: I'm sure of it, child. (_Looking out._) There! There he is! Walking along that path that they made. I can see he's got an idea. How like Napoleon.[*] He's walking with Mr. Splurge. They're coming in now. Come along, Ermyntrude, we mustn't disturb him to-day. He has some great idea, some great idea.  [Footnote *: (N.B.--SLADDER _is not in the very least like Napoleon._)]  ERMYNTRUDE: How splendid, mother! What do you think it is?  MRS. SLADDER: Ah. I could never explain it to you, even if I knew. It is business, child, business. It isn't everybody that can understand business.  ERMYNTRUDE: I hear them coming, mother.  MRS. SLADDER: There must be things we can never understand: things too deep for us like. And business is the most wonderful of them all.  [_Exeunt R._  [_Enter_ SLADDER _and_ SPLURGE _through the window, which opens on to the lawn, down a step or two._  SLADDER: Now, Splurge, we must do some business.  SPLURGE: Yes, sir.  SLADDER: Sit down, Splurge.  SPLURGE: Thank you, sir.  SLADDER: Splurge, I am going to say to you now, what I couldn't talk about with all those gardeners hanging about. And, by the way, Splurge, haven't we bought rather too many gardeners?  SPLURGE: No, sir. The Earl of Etheldune has seven; we had to go one better than him, sir.  SLADDER: Certainly, Splurge, certainly.  SPLURGE: So I bought ten for you, sir, to be on the safe side.  SLADDER: Ah, quite right, Splurge, quite right. There seemed to be rather a lot, but that's quite right. Well, now to business.  SPLURGE: Yes, sir.  SLADDER: I told you I'd invented a new name for a food.  SPLURGE: Yes, sir. Cheezo.  SLADDER: Well, what have you been able to do about it?  SPLURGE: I've had some nice little posters done, sir. I'm having it well written up. I've got some samples here, and it looks like doing very well indeed.  SLADDER: Ah!  SPLURGE: It's a grand name, if I may say so, sir. It sounds so classical-like with that \"O\" at the end; and yet anyone can see what it's derived from, even if he's never learnt anything. It suggests cheese to them every time.  SLADDER: Let's see your samples.  SPLURGE: Well, sir, here's one. (_Brings paper from pocket. Reads._) \"What is Cheezo? Go where you may, speak with whom you will, the same question confronts you. Cheezo is the great new----\"  SLADDER: No, Splurge. Cut that question bit. We must have no admission on our part that there's anyone who doesn't know what Cheezo is. Cut it.  SPLURGE: You're quite right, sir; you're quite right. That's a weak bit. I'll cut it. (_He scratches it out. Reads._) \"Cheezo is the great new food. It builds up body and brain.\"  SLADDER: That's good.  SPLURGE: \"There is a hundred times more lactic fluid in an ounce of Cheezo than in a gallon of milk.\"  SLADDER: What's lactic fluid, Splurge?  SPLURGE: I don't know, sir, but it's good stuff all right. It's the right thing to have in it. It's a good man that I got to write this.  SLADDER: All right. Go on.  SPLURGE: \"Cheezo makes darling baby grow.\"  SLADDER: Good. Very good. Very good indeed, Splurge.  SPLURGE: Yes, I think that catches them, sir.  SLADDER: Go on.  SPLURGE: \"Cheezo. The only food.\"  SLADDER: \"The only food\"? I don't like that.  SPLURGE: It will go down all right, sir, so long as the posters are big enough.  SLADDER: Go down all right! I wasn't fool enough to suppose that it wouldn't go _down_ all right. What are posters for if the public doesn't believe them? Of course it will go _down_ all right.  SPLURGE: O, I beg your pardon, sir. Then what don't you quite like about it?  SLADDER: I might invent another food one of these days, and then where should we be?  SPLURGE: I hadn't thought of that, sir.  SLADDER: Out with it.  SPLURGE: (_Scratches with pencil_). \"Cheezo is made out of the purest milk from purest English cows.\"  SLADDER: Y-e-s, y-e-s. I don't say you're wrong. I don't say you're exactly wrong. But in business, Splurge, you want to keep more to generalities. Talk about the bonds that bind the Empire, talk about the Union Jack, talk by all means about the purity of the English cow; but definite statements you know, definite statements----  SPLURGE: O, yes, I know, sir; but the police never interfere with anything one puts on a poster. It would be bad for business, a jury would never convict, and----  SLADDER: I didn't say they would; but if some interfering ass were to write to the papers to say that Cheezo wasn't made from milk, we should have to go to the expense of buying a dozen cows, and photographing them, and one thing and another. (_He gets up and goes to cupboard._) Now, look here. I quite understand what you say, purity and all that, and a very good point too, but you look at this.  [_He unrolls a huge poster representing a dairymaid smirking in deadly earnest. On it is printed: \"WON'T YOU HAVE SOME?\" and on another part of the poster \"CHEEZO FOR PURITY.\"_  You see. Your whole point's there. We state nothing and we can make the dairymaid as suggestive as we like.  SPLURGE: Yes, sir, that is excellent. Quite splendid.  SLADDER: They shall look at that on "]]]
