The Sceptres of our Kings are not so much respected; for the Savages have such a Deference for this Pipe, that one may call it _The God of Peace and War, and the Arbiter of Life and Death_. Their _Calumet of Peace_ is different from the _Calumet of War_; They make use of the former to seal their Alliances and Treaties, to travel with safety, and receive Strangers; and the other is to proclaim War.”  This reverence for the calumet is shown by the manner in which it is used at dances, in the ceremony of smoking, etc., indicating a religious devoutness approaching that recently observed among various Algonkian tribes in connection with the ceremonies of the Midē´wiwin. When the calumet dance was held, the Illinois appear to have resorted to the houses in the winter and to the groves in the summer. The above-named authority continues in this connection:    They chuse for that purpose a set Place among Trees, to shelter   themselves against the Heat of the Sun, and lay in the middle a large   Matt, as a Carpet, to lay upon the God of the Chief of the Company,   who gave the Ball; for every one has his peculiar God, whom they call   _Manitoa_. It is sometime a Stone, a Bird, a Serpent, or anything else   that they dream of in their Sleep; for they think this _Manitoa_ will   prosper their Wants, as Fishing, Hunting, and other Enterprizes. To   the Right of their _Manitoa_ they place the _Calumet_, their Great   Deity, making round about it a Kind of Trophy with their Arms, viz.   their Clubs, Axes, Bows, Quivers, and Arrows.  *  *  *  Every Body   sits down afterwards, round about, as they come, having first of all   saluted the _Manitoa_, which they do in blowing the Smoak of their   Tobacco upon it, which is as much as offering to it Frankincense.   *  *  *  This _Preludium_ being over, he who is to begin the Dance   appears in the middle of the Assembly, and having taken the _Calumet_,   presents it to the Sun, as if he wou’d invite him to smoke. Then he   moves it into an infinite Number of Postures sometimes laying it near   the Ground, then stretching its Wings, as if he wou’d make it fly, and   then presents it to the Spectators, who smoke with it one after   another, dancing all the while. This is the first Scene of this famous   Ball.  The infinite number of postures assumed in offering the pipe appear as significant as the “smoke ceremonies” mentioned in connection with the preparatory instruction of the candidate previous to his initiation into the Midē´wiwin.  In his remarks on the religion of the Indians and the practices of the sorcerers, Hennepin says:    As for their Opinion concerning the Earth, they make use of a Name of   a certain _Genius_, whom they call _Micaboche_, who has cover’d the   whole Earth with water (as they imagine) and relate innumerable   fabulous Tales, some of which have a kind of Analogy with the   Universal Deluge. These Barbarians believe that there are certain   Spirits in the Air, between Heaven and Earth, who have a power to   foretell future Events, and others who play the part of Physicians,   curing all sorts of Distempers. Upon which account, it happens, that   these _Savages_ are very Superstitious, and consult their Oracles with   a great deal of exactness. One of these Masters-Jugglers who pass for   Sorcerers among them, one day caus’d a Hut to be erected with ten   thick Stakes, which he fix’d very deep in the Ground, and then made a   horrible noise to Consult the Spirits, to know whether abundance of   Snow wou’d fall ere long, that they might have good game in the   Hunting of Elks and Beavers: Afterward he bawl’d out aloud from the   bottom of the Hut, that he saw many Herds of Elks, which were as yet   at a very great distance, but that they drew near within seven or   eight Leagues of their Huts, which caus’d a great deal of joy among   those poor deluded Wretches.  That this statement refers to one or more tribes of the Algonkian linguistic stock is evident, not only because of the reference to the sorcerers and their peculiar methods of procedure, but also that the name of _Micaboche_, an Algonkian divinity, appears. This Spirit, who acted as an intercessor between Ki´tshi Man´idō (Great Spirit) and the Indians, is known among the Ojibwa as Mi´nabō´zho; but to this full reference will be made further on in connection with the Myth of the origin of the Midē´wiwin. The tradition of Nokomis (the earth) and the birth of Manabush (the Mi´nabō´zho of the Menomoni) and his brother, the Wolf, that pertaining to the re-creation of the world, and fragments of other myths, are thrown together and in a mangled form presented by Hennepin in the following words:    Some Salvages which live at the upper end of the River St. _Lawrence_,   do relate a pretty diverting Story. They hold almost the same opinion   with the former [the Iroquois], that a Woman came down from Heaven,   and remained for some while fluttering in the Air, not finding Ground   whereupon to put her Foot. But that the Fishes moved with Compassion   for her, immediately held a Consultation to deliberate which of them   should receive her. The Tortoise very officiously offered its Back on   the Surface of the Water. The Woman came to rest upon it, and fixed   herself there. Afterwards the Filthiness and Dirt of the Sea gathering   together about the Tortoise, there was formed by little and little   that vast Tract of Land, which we now call _America_.    They add that this Woman grew weary of her Solitude, wanting some body   for to keep her Company, that so she might spend her time more   pleasantly. Melancholy and Sadness having seiz’d upon her Spirits, she   fell asleep, and a Spirit descended from above, and finding her in   that Condition approach’d and knew her unperceptibly. From which   Approach she conceived two Children, which came forth out of one of   her Ribs. But these two Brothers could never afterwards agree   together. One of them was a better Huntsman than the other; they   quarreled every day; and their Disputes grew so high at last, that one   could not bear with the other. One especially being of a very wild   Temper, hated mortally his Brother who was of a milder Constitution,   who being no longer able to endure the Pranks of the other, he   resolved at last to part from him. He retired then into Heaven,   whence, for a Mark of his just Resentment, he causeth at several times   his Thunder to rore over the Head of his unfortunate Brother.    Sometime after the Spirit descended again on that Woman, and she   conceived a Daughter, from whom (as the Salvages say) were propagated   these numerous People, which do occupy now one of the greatest parts   of the Universe.  It is evident that the narrator has sufficiently distorted the traditions to make them conform, as much as practicable, to the biblical story of the birth of Christ. No reference whatever is made in the Ojibwa or Menomoni myths to the conception of the Daughter of Nokomis (the earth) by a celestial visitant, but the reference is to one of the wind gods. Mi´nabō´zho became angered with the Ki´tshi Man´idō, and the latter, to appease his discontent, gave to Mi´nabō´zho the rite of the Midēwiwin. The brother of Mi´nabō´zho was destroyed by the malevolent underground spirits and now rules the abode of shadows,--the “Land of the Midnight Sun.”  Upon his arrival at the “Bay of Puans” (Green Bay, Wisconsin), Marquette found a village inhabited by three nations, viz: “Miamis, Maskoutens, and Kikabeux.” He says:    When I arriv’d there, I was very glad to see a great Cross set up in   the middle of the Village, adorn’d with several White Skins, Red   Girdles, Bows and Arrows, which that good People had offer’d to the   Great _Manitou_, to return him their Thanks for the care he had taken   of them during the Winter, and that he had granted them a prosperous   Hunting. _Manitou_, is the Name they give in general to all Spirits   whom they think to be above the Nature of Man.  Marquette was without doubt ignorant of the fact that the cross is the sacred post, and the symbol of the fourth degree of the Midē´wiwin, as will be fully explained in connection with that grade of the society. The erroneous conclusion that the cross was erected as an evidence of the adoption of Christianity, and possibly as a compliment to the visitor, was a natural one on the part of the priest, but this same symbol of the Midē´ Society had probably been erected and bedecked with barbaric emblems and weapons months before anything was known of him.  The result of personal investigations among the Ojibwa, conducted during the years 1887, 1888 and 1889, are presented in the accompanying paper. The information was obtained from a number of the chief Midē´ priests living at Red Lake and White Earth reservations, as well as from members of the society from other reservations, who visited the last named locality during the three years. Special mention of the peculiarity of the music recorded will be made at the proper place; and it may here be said that in no instance was the use of colors detected, in any birch-bark or other records or mnemonic songs, simply to heighten the artistic effect; though the reader would be led by an examination of the works of Schoolcraft to believe this to be a common practice. Col. Garrick Mallery; U.S. Army, in a paper read before the Anthropological Society of Washington, District of Columbia, in 1888, says, regarding this subject:    The general character of his voluminous publications has not been such   as to assure modern critics of his accuracy, and the wonderful   minuteness, as well as comprehension, attributed by him to the Ojibwa   hieroglyphs has been generally regarded of late with suspicion. It was   considered in the Bureau of Ethnology an important duty to ascertain   how much of truth"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19368"],["title","The Mide'wiwin or \"Grand Medicine Society\" of the Ojibwa (#3)"],["body","in these remarkable accounts, and for that   purpose its pictographic specialists, myself and Dr. W. J. Hoffman as   assistant, were last summer directed to proceed to the most favorable   points in the present habitat of the tribe, namely, the northern   region of Minnesota and Wisconsin, to ascertain how much was yet to be   discovered.  *  *  *  The general results of the comparison of   Schoolcraft’s statements with what is now found shows that, in   substance, he told the truth, but with much exaggeration and coloring.   The word “coloring” is particularly appropriate, because, in his   copious illustrations, various colors were used freely with apparent   significance, whereas, in fact, the general rule in regard to the   birch-bark rolls was that they were never colored at all; indeed, the   bark was not adapted to coloration. The metaphorical coloring was also   used by him in a manner which, to any thorough student of the Indian   philosophy and religion, seems absurd. Metaphysical expressions are   attached to some of the devices, or, as he calls them, symbols, which,   could never have been entertained by a people in the stage of culture   of the Ojibwa.   SHAMANS.  There are extant among the Ojibwa Indians three classes of mystery men, termed respectively and in order of importance the Midē´, the Jĕs´sakkīd´, and the Wâbĕnō´, but before proceeding to elaborate in detail the Society of the Midē´, known as the Midē´wiwin, a brief description of the last two is necessary.  The term Wâbĕnō´ has been explained by various intelligent Indians as signifying “Men of the dawn,” “Eastern men,” etc. Their profession is not thoroughly understood, and their number is so extremely limited that but little information respecting them can be obtained. Schoolcraft,[5] in referring to the several classes of Shamans, says “there is a third form or rather modification of the medawin,  *  *  *  the Wâbĕnō´; a term denoting a kind of midnight orgies, which is regarded as a corruption of the Meda.” This writer furthermore remarks[6] that “it is stated by judicious persons among themselves to be of modern origin. They regard it as a degraded form of the mysteries of the Meda.”      [Footnote 5: Information respecting the history, condition, and     prospects of the Indian tribes of the United States. Philadelphia,     1851, vol. 1, p. 319.]      [Footnote 6: Ibid., p. 362.]  From personal investigation it has been ascertained that a Wâbĕnō´ does not affiliate with others of his class so as to constitute a society, but indulges his pretensions individually. A Wâbĕnō´ is primarily prompted by dreams or visions which may occur during his youth, for which purpose he leaves his village to fast for an indefinite number of days. It is positively affirmed that evil man´idōs favor his desires, and apart from his general routine of furnishing “hunting medicine,” “love powders,” etc., he pretends also to practice medical magic. When a hunter has been successful through the supposed assistance of the Wâbĕnō´, he supplies the latter with part of the game, when, in giving a feast to his tutelary daimon, the Wâbĕnō´ will invite a number of friends, but all who desire to come are welcome. This feast is given at night; singing and dancing are boisterously indulged in, and the Wâbĕnō´, to sustain his reputation, entertains his visitors with a further exhibition of his skill. By the use of plants he is alleged to be enabled to take up and handle with impunity red-hot stones and burning brands, and without evincing the slightest discomfort it is said that he will bathe his hands in boiling water, or even boiling maple sirup. On account of such performances the general impression prevails among the Indians that the Wâbĕnō´ is a “dealer in fire,” or “fire-handler.” Such exhibitions always terminate at the approach of day. The number of these pretenders who are not members of the Midē´wiwin, is very limited; for instance, there are at present but two or three at White Earth Reservation and none at Leech Lake.  As a general rule, however, the Wâbĕnō´ will seek entrance into the Midē´wiwin when he becomes more of a specialist in the practice of medical magic, incantations, and the exorcism of malevolent man´idōs, especially such as cause disease.  The Jĕs´sakkīd´ is a seer and prophet; though commonly designated a “juggler,” the Indians define him as a “revealer of hidden truths.” There is no association whatever between the members of this profession, and each practices his art singly and alone whenever a demand is made and the fee presented. As there is no association, so there is no initiation by means of which one may become a Jĕs´sakkīd´. The gift is believed to be given by the thunder god, or Animiki´, and then only at long intervals and to a chosen few. The gift is received during youth, when the fast is undertaken and when visions appear to the individual. His renown depends upon his own audacity and the opinion of the tribe. He is said to possess the power to look into futurity; to become acquainted with the affairs and intentions of men; to prognosticate the success or misfortune of hunters and warriors, as well as other affairs of various individuals, and to call from any living human being the soul, or, more strictly speaking, the shadow, thus depriving the victim of reason, and even of life. His power consists in invoking, and causing evil, while that of the Midē´ is to avert it; he attempts at times to injure the Midē´ but the latter, by the aid of his superior man´idos, becomes aware of, and averts such premeditated injury. It sometimes happens that the demon possessing a patient is discovered, but the Midē´ alone has the power to expel him. The exorcism of demons is one of the chief pretensions of this personage, and evil spirits are sometimes removed by sucking them through tubes, and startling tales are told how the Jĕs´sakkīd´ can, in the twinkling of an eye, disengage himself of the most complicated tying of cords and ropes, etc. The lodge used by this class of men consists of four poles planted in the ground, forming a square of three or four feet and upward in diameter, around which are wrapped birch bark, robes, or canvas in such a way as to form an upright cylinder. Communion is held with the turtle, who is the most powerful man´idō of the Jĕs´sakkīd´, and through him, with numerous other malevolent man´idōs, especially the Animiki´, or thunder-bird. When the prophet has seated himself within his lodge the structure begins to sway violently from side to side, loud thumping noises are heard within, denoting the arrival of man´idōs, and numerous voices and laughter are distinctly audible to those without. Questions may then be put to the prophet and, if everything be favorable, the response is not long in coming. In his notice of the Jĕs´sakkīd´, Schoolcraft affirms[7] that “while he thus exercises the functions of a prophet, he is also a member of the highest class of the fraternity of the Midâwin--a society of men who exercise the medical art on the principles of magic and incantations.” The fact is that there is not the slightest connection between the practice of the Jĕs´sakkīd´ and that of the Midē´wiwin, and it is seldom, if at all, that a Midē´ becomes a Jĕs´sakkīd´, although the latter sometimes gains admission into the Midē´wiwin, chiefly with the intention of strengthening his power with his tribe.      [Footnote 7: Op. cit., vol. 5, p. 423.]  The number of individuals of this class who are not members of the Midē´wiwin is limited, though greater than that of the Wâbĕnō´. An idea of the proportion of numbers of the respective classes may be formed by taking the case of Menomoni Indians, who are in this respect upon the same plane as the Ojibwa. That tribe numbers about fifteen hundred, the Midē´ Society consisting, in round numbers, of one hundred members, and among the entire population there are but two Wâbĕnō´ and five Jĕs´sakkīd´.  It is evident that neither the Wâbĕnō´ nor the Jĕs´sakkīd´ confine themselves to the mnemonic songs which are employed during their ceremonial performances, or even prepare them to any extent. Such bark records as have been observed or recorded, even after most careful research and examination extending over the field seasons of three years, prove to have been the property of Wâbĕnō´ and Jĕs´sakkīd´, who were also Midē´. It is probable that those who practice either of the first two forms of ceremonies and nothing else are familiar with and may employ for their own information certain mnemonic records; but they are limited to the characteristic formulæ of exorcism, as their practice varies and is subject to changes according to circumstances and the requirements and wants of the applicant when words are chanted to accord therewith.  Some examples of songs used by Jĕs´sakkīd´, after they have become Midē´, will be given in the description of the several degrees of the Midē ’wiwin.  There is still another class of persons termed Mashkī´kĭkē´winĭnĭ, or herbalists, who are generally denominated “medicine men,” as the Ojibwa word implies. Their calling is a simple one, and consists in knowing the mysterious properties of a variety of plants, herbs, roots, and berries, which are revealed upon application and for a fee. When there is an administration of a remedy for a given complaint, based upon true scientific principles, it is only in consequence of such practice having been acquired from the whites, as it has usually been the custom of the Catholic Fathers to utilize all ordinary and available remedies for the treatment of the common disorders of life. Although these herbalists are aware that certain plants or roots will produce a specified effect upon the human system, they attribute the benefit to the fact that such remedies are distasteful and injurious to the demons who are present in the system and to whom the disease is attributed. Many of these herbalists are found among women,"]]]
