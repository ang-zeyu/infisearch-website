On the photograph      made at the Washington Observatory the helium line is certain, as a      second exposure was made with a sodium flame; and the two lines are      shown distinctly separated.       2. THE NEGATIVE ACCELERATION. This phenomenon was observed      to a greater or less extent all over the globe. It was especially      marked near the equator; but in Northern Europe it was noted by only      a few observers, though many clocks were stopped and other      instruments deranged. There appears to be no doubt that a force of      terrific magnitude was applied in a tangential direction to the      surface of the earth, in such a direction as to oppose its axial      rotation, with the effect that the surface velocity was diminished      by about one part in three hundred, resulting in a lengthening of      the day by five minutes, thirteen and a half seconds.       The application of this brake--(_Bremsekraft_), as we may term      it--caused acceleration phenomena to manifest themselves precisely      as on a railroad train when being brought to a stop. The change in      the surface speed of the earth at the equator has amounted to about      6.4 kilometres an hour; and various observations show that this      change of velocity was brought about by the operation of the unknown      force for a period of time of less than three minutes. The negative      acceleration thus represented would certainly be too small to      produce any marked physiological sensations, and yet the reports      from various places indicate that they were certainly observed. The      sensations felt are usually described as similar to those      experienced in a moving automobile when the brake is very gently      applied.       Moreover, certain destructive actions are reported from localities      near the equator--chimneys fell and tall buildings swayed; while      from New York comes the report that the obelisk in Central Park was      thrown from its pedestal. It appears that these effects were due to      the circumstance that the alteration of velocity was propagated      through the earth as a wave similar to an earthquake wave, and that      the effects were cumulative at certain points--a theory that is      substantiated by reports that at certain localities, even near the      equator, no effects were noted.       3. TIDAL WAVES. These were observed everywhere and were      very destructive in many places. In the Panama Canal, which is near      the equator and which runs nearly east and west, the sweep of the      water was so great that it flowed over the Gatun Lock. On the      eastern coasts of the various continents there was a recession of      the sea, the fall of the tide being from three to five metres below      the low-water mark. On the western coasts there was a corresponding      rise, which in some cases reached a level of over twelve metres.       That the tidal phenomena were not more marked and more destructive      is a matter of great surprise, and has been considered as evidence      that the retarding force was not applied at a single spot on the      earth's surface, but was a distributed force, which acted on the      water as well as on the land, though to a less extent. It is      difficult, however, to conceive of a force capable of acting in such      a way; and Björnson's theory of the magnetic vortex in the ether has      been rejected by this commission.       4. ATMOSPHERIC DISTURBANCES. Some time after the appearance      of the yellow aurora a sudden rise in atmospheric pressure, followed      by a gradual fall considerably below the normal pressure, was      recorded over the entire surface of the globe. Calculations based on      the time of arrival of this disturbance at widely separated points      show that it proceeded with the velocity of sound from a point      situated probably in Northern Labrador. The maximum rise of pressure      recorded was registered at Halifax, the self-recording barographs      showing that the pressure rose over six centimetres in less than      five minutes.       5. SHIFT IN DIRECTION OF THE EARTH'S AXIS. The axis of the      earth has been shifted in space by the disturbance and now points      almost exactly toward the double star Delta Ursæ Minoris. This      change appears to have resulted from the circumstance that the force      was applied to the surface of the globe in a direction not quite      parallel to the direction of rotation, the result being the      development of a new axis and a shift in the positions of the poles,      which it will now be necessary to rediscover.       It appears that these most remarkable cosmic phenomena can be      explained in either of two ways: they may have resulted from an      explosive or volcanic discharge from the surface of the earth, or      from the oblique impact of a meteoric stream moving at a very high      velocity. It seems unlikely that sufficient energy to bring about      the observed changes could have been developed by a volcanic      disturbance of the ordinary type; but if radioactive forces are      allowed to come into play the amount of energy available is      practically unlimited.       It is difficult, however, to conceive of any way in which a sudden      liberation of atomic energy could have been brought about by any      terrestrial agency; so that the first theory, though able to account      for the facts, seems to be the less tenable of the two. The meteoric      theory offers no especial difficulty. The energy delivered by a      comparatively small mass of finely divided matter, moving at a      velocity of several hundred kilometres a second--and such a velocity      is by no means unknown--would be amply sufficient to alter the      velocity of rotation by the small amount observed.       Moreover, the impact of such a meteoric stream may have      developed a temperature sufficiently high to bring about      radioactive changes, the effect of which would be to expel      helium and other disintegration products at cathode-ray      velocity--(_Kathoden-Strahlen-Fortpflanzung-Geschwindigkeit_)--from      the surface of the earth; and the recoil exerted by this expulsion      would add itself to the force of the meteoric impact.       The presence of helium makes this latter hypothesis not altogether      improbable, while the atmospheric wave of pressure would result at      once from the disruption of the air by the passage of the meteor      stream through it. Exploration of the region in which it seems      probable that the disturbance took place will undoubtedly furnish      the data necessary for the complete solution of the problem.\"      [Pp. 17-19.]     V   At ten o'clock one evening, shortly after the occurrences heretofore described, an extraordinary conference occurred at the White House, probably the most remarkable ever held there or elsewhere. At the long table at which the cabinet meetings took place sat six gentlemen in evening dress, each trying to appear unconcerned, if not amused. At the head of the table was the President of the United States; next to him Count von Koenitz, the German Ambassador, representing the Imperial[1] German Commissioners, who had taken over the reins of the German Government after the abdication of the Kaiser; and, on the opposite side, Monsieur Emil Liban, Prince Rostoloff, and Sir John Smith, the respective ambassadors of France, Russia, and Great Britain. The sixth person was Thornton, the astronomer.  [Footnote 1: The Germans were unwilling to surrender the use of the words \"Empire\" and \"Imperial,\" even after they had adopted a republican form of government.]  The President had only succeeded in bringing this conference about after the greatest effort and the most skilful diplomacy--in view of the extreme importance which, he assured them all, he attached to the matters which he desired to lay before them. Only for this reason had the ambassadors of warring nations consented to meet--unofficially as it were.  \"With great respect, your Excellency,\" said Count von Koenitz, \"the matter is preposterous--as much so as a fairy tale by Grimm! This wireless operator of whom you speak is lying about these messages. If he received them at all--a fact which hangs solely upon his word--he received them _after_ and not _before_ the phenomena recorded.\"  The President shook his head. \"That might hold true of the first message--the one received July 19th,\" said he, \"but the second message, foretelling the lengthening of July 27th, _was delivered on that day, and was in my hands before the disturbances occurred_.\"  Von Koenitz fingered his moustache and shrugged his shoulders. It was clear that he regarded the whole affair as absurd, undignified.  Monsieur Liban turned impatiently from him.  \"Your Excellency,\" he said, addressing the President, \"I cannot share the views of Count von Koenitz. I regard this affair as of the most stupendous importance. Messages or no messages, extraordinary natural phenomena are occurring which may shortly end in the extinction of human life upon the planet. A power which can control the length of the day can annihilate the globe.\"  \"You cannot change the facts,\" remarked Prince Rostoloff sternly to the German Ambassador. \"The earth has changed its orbit. Professor Vaskofsky, of the Imperial College, has so declared. There is some cause. Be it God or devil, there is a cause. Are we to sit still and do nothing while the globe's crust freezes and our armies congeal into corpses?\" He trembled with agitation.  \"Calm yourself, _mon cher Prince_!\" said Monsieur Liban. \"So far we have gained fifteen minutes and have lost nothing! But, as you say, whether or not the sender of these messages is responsible, there is a cause, and we must find it.\"  \"But how? That is the question,\" exclaimed the President almost apologetically, for he felt,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19174"],["title","The Man Who Rocked the Earth (#4)"],["body"," did Count von Koenitz, that somehow an explanation would shortly be forthcoming that would make this conference seem the height of the ridiculous. \"I have already,\" he added hastily, \"instructed the entire force of the National Academy of Sciences to direct its energies toward the solution of these phenomena. Undoubtedly Great Britain, Russia, Germany, and France are doing the same. The scientists report that the yellow aurora seen in the north, the earthquakes, the variation of the compass, and the eccentricities of the barometer are probably all connected more or less directly with the change in the earth's orbit. But they offer no explanation. They do not suggest what the aurora is nor why its appearance should have this effect. It, therefore, seems to me clearly my duty to lay before you all the facts as far as they are known to me. Among these facts are the mysterious messages received by wireless at the Naval Observatory immediately preceding these events.\"  \"_Post hoc, ergo propter hoc!_\" half sneered Von Koenitz.  The President smiled wearily.  \"What do you wish me to do?\" he asked, glancing round the table. \"Shall we remain inactive? Shall we wait and see what may happen?\"  \"No! No!\" shouted Rostoloff, jumping to his feet. \"Another week and we may all be plunged into eternity. It is suicidal not to regard this matter seriously. We are sick from war. And perhaps Count von Koenitz, in view of the fall of Berlin, would welcome something of the sort as an honourable way out of his country's difficulties.\"  \"Sir!\" cried the count, leaping to his feet. \"Have a care! It has cost Russia four million men to reach Berlin. When we have taken Paris we shall recapture Berlin and commence the march of our victorious eagles toward Moscow and the Winter Palace.\"  \"Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Be seated, I implore you!\" exclaimed the President.  The Russian and German ambassadors somewhat ungraciously resumed their former places, casting at each other glances of undisguised contempt.  \"As I see the matter,\" continued the President, \"there are two distinct propositions before you: The first relates to how far the extraordinary events of the past week are of such a character as to demand joint investigation and action by the Powers. The second involves the cause of these events and their connection with and relation to the sender of the messages signed Pax. I shall ask you to signify your opinion as to each of these questions.\"  \"I believe that some action should be taken, based on the assumption that they are manifestations of one and the same power or cause,\" said Monsieur Liban emphatically.  \"I agree with the French Ambassador,\" growled Rostoloff.  \"I am of opinion that the phenomena should be the subject of proper scientific investigation,\" remarked Count von Koenitz more calmly. \"But as far as these messages are concerned they are, if I may be pardoned for saying so, a foolish joke. It is undignified to take any cognizance of them.\"  \"What do you think, Sir John?\" asked the President, turning to the English Ambassador.  \"Before making up my mind,\" returned the latter quietly, \"I should like to see the operator who received them.\"  \"By all means!\" exclaimed Von Koenitz.  The President pressed a button and his secretary entered.  \"I had anticipated such a desire on the part of all of you,\" he announced, \"and arranged to have him here. He is waiting outside. Shall I have him brought in?\"  \"Yes! Yes!\" answered Rostoloff. And the others nodded.  The door opened, and Bill Hood, wearing his best new blue suit and nervously twisting a faded bicycle cap between his fingers, stumbled awkwardly into the room. His face was bright red with embarrassment and one of his cheeks exhibited a marked protuberance. He blinked in the glare of the electric light.  \"Mr. Hood,\" the President addressed him courteously, \"I have sent for you to explain to these gentlemen, who are the ambassadors of the great European Powers, the circumstances under which you received the wireless messages from the unknown person describing himself as 'Pax.'\"  Hood shifted from his right to his left foot and pressed his lips together. Von Koenitz fingered the waxed ends of his moustache and regarded the operator whimsically.  \"In the first place,\" went on the President, \"we desire to know whether the messages which you have reported were received under ordinary or under unusual conditions. In a word, could you form any opinion as to the whereabouts of the sender?\"  Hood scratched the side of his nose in a manner politely doubtful.  \"Sure thing, your Honour,\" he answered at last. \"Sure the conditions was unusual. That feller has some juice and no mistake.\"  \"Juice?\" inquired Von Koenitz.  \"Yare--current. Whines like a steel top. Fifty kilowatts sure, and maybe more! And a twelve-thousand-metre wave.\"  \"I do not fully understand,\" interjected Rostoloff. \"Please explain, sir.\"  \"Ain't nothin' to explain,\" returned Hood. \"He's just got a hell of a wave length, that's all. Biggest on earth. We're only tuned for a three-thousand-metre wave. At first I could hardly take him at all. I had to throw in our new Henderson ballast coils before I could hear properly. I reckon there ain't another station in Christendom can get him.\"  \"Ah,\" remarked Von Koenitz. \"One of your millionaire amateurs, I suppose.\"  \"Yare,\" agreed Hood. \"I thought sure he was a nut.\"  \"A what?\" interrupted Sir John Smith.  \"A nut,\" answered Hood. \"A crank, so to speak.\"  \"Ah, 'krank'!\" nodded the German. \"Exactly--a lunatic! That is precisely what I say!\"  \"But I don't think it's no nut now,\" countered Hood valiantly. \"If he is a bug he's the biggest bug in all creation, that's all I can say. He's got the goods, that's what he's got. He'll do some damage before he gets through.\"  \"Are these messages addressed to anybody in particular?\" inquired Sir John, who was studying Hood intently.  \"Well, they are and they ain't. Pax--that's what he calls himself--signals NAA, our number, you understand, and then says what he has to say to the whole world, care of the United States. The first message I thought was a joke and stuck it in a book I was reading, '_Silas Snooks_'----\"  \"What?\" ejaculated Von Koenitz impatiently.  \"Snooks--man's name--feller in the book--nothing to do with this business,\" explained the operator. \"I forgot all about it. But after the earthquake and all the rest of the fuss I dug it out and gave it to Mr. Thornton. Then on the 27th came the next one, saying that Pax was getting tired of waiting for us and was going to start something. That came at one o'clock in the afternoon, and the fun began at three sharp. The whole observatory went on the blink. Say, there ain't any doubt in your minds that it's _him_, is there?\"  Von Koenitz looked cynically round the room.  \"There is not!\" exclaimed Rostoloff and Liban in the same breath.  The German laughed.  \"Speak for yourselves, Excellencies,\" he sneered. His tone nettled the wireless representative of the sovereign American people.  \"Do you think I'm a liar?\" he demanded, clenching his jaw and glaring at Von Koenitz.  The German Ambassador shrugged his shoulders again. Such things were impossible in a civilized country--at Potsdam--but what could you expect----  \"Steady, Hood!\" whispered Thornton.  \"Remember, Mr. Hood, that you are here to answer our questions,\" said the President sternly. \"You must not address his Excellency, Baron von Koenitz, in this fashion.\"  \"But the man was making a monkey of me!\" muttered Hood. \"All I say is, look out. This Pax is on his job and means business. I just got another call before I came over here--at nine o'clock.\"  \"What was its purport?\" inquired the President.  \"Why, it said Pax was getting tired of nothing being done and wanted action of some sort. Said that men were dying like flies, and he proposed to put an end to it at any cost. And--and----\"  \"Yes! Yes!\" ejaculated Liban breathlessly.  \"And he would give further evidence of his control over the forces of nature to-night.\"  \"Ha! Ha!\" Von Koenitz leaned back in amusement. \"My friend,\" he chuckled, \"you--are--the 'nut'!\"  What form Hood's resentment might have taken is problematical; but as the German's words left his mouth the electric lights suddenly went out and the windows rattled ominously. At the same moment each occupant of the room felt himself sway slightly toward the east wall, on which appeared a bright yellow glow. Instinctively they all turned to the window which faced the north. The whole sky was flooded with an orange-yellow aurora that rivalled the sunlight in intensity.  \"What'd I tell you?\" mumbled Hood.  The Executive Mansion quivered, and even in that yellow light the faces of the ambassadors seemed pale with fear. And then as the glow slowly faded in the north there floated down across the aperture of the window something soft and fluffy like feathers. Thicker and faster it came until the lawn of the White House was covered with it. The air in the room turned cold. Through the window a large flake circled and lit on the back of Rostoloff's head.  \"Snow!\" he cried. \"A snowstorm--in August!\"  The President arose and closed the window. Almost immediately the electric lights burned up again.  \"Now are you satisfied?\" cried Liban to the German.  \"Satisfied?\" growled Von Koenitz. \"I have seen plenty of snowstorms in August. They have them daily in the Alps. You ask me if I am satisfied. Of what? That earthquakes, the aurora borealis, electrical disturbances, snowstorms exist--yes. That a mysterious bugaboo is responsible for these things--no!\"  \"What, then, do you require?\" gasped Liban.  \"More than a snowstorm!\" retorted the German. \"When I was a boy at the gymnasium we had a thunderstorm with fishes in it. They were everywhere one stepped, all over the ground. But we did not conclude that Jonah was giving us a demonstration of his power over the whale.\"  He faced the others defiantly; in his voice was mockery.  \"You may retire, Mr."]]]
