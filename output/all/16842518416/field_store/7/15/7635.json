There ain't another station in the world but this can pick him up!\"  \"NAA--NAA--NAA,\" came the call.  Throwing in his rheostat he sent an \"O.K\" in reply, and waited expectantly, pencil in hand. A moment more and he dropped his pencil in disgust.  \"Just another bug!\" he remarked aloud to the thermometer. \"Ought to be poisoned! What a whale of a wave length, though!\"  For several minutes he listened intently, for the amateur was sending insistently, repeating everything twice as if he meant business.  \"He's a jolly joker all right,\" muttered Hood, this time to the clock. \"Must be pretty hard up for something to do!\"  Then he laughed out loud and took up the pencil again. This amateur, whoever he was, was almost as good as his detective story. The \"bug\" called the Naval Observatory once more and began repeating his entire message for the third time.  \"To all mankind\"--he addressed himself modestly--\"To all mankind--To all mankind--I am the dictator--of human destiny--Through the earth's rotation--I control--day and night--summer and winter--I command the--cessation of hostilities and--the abolition of war upon the globe--I appoint the--United States--as my agent for this purpose--As evidence of my power I shall increase the length of the day--from midnight to midnight--of Thursday, July 22d, by the period of five minutes.--PAX.\"  The jolly joker, having repeated thus his extraordinary message to all mankind, stopped sending.  \"Well, I'll be hanged!\" gasped Bill Hood. Then he wound up his magnetic detector and sent an answering challenge into the ether.  \"Can--the--funny--stuff!\" he snapped. \"And tune out--or--we'll revoke--your license!\"  \"What a gall!\" he grunted, folding up the yellow sheet of pad paper upon which he had taken down the message to all mankind and thrusting it into his book for a marker. \"All the fools aren't dead yet!\"  Then he picked up the _Lincoln_ and got down to real work. The \"bug\" and his message passed from memory.     II   The following Thursday afternoon a perspiring and dusty stranger from St. Louis, who, with the Metropolitan Art Museum as his objective, was trudging wearily through Central Park, New York City, at two o'clock, paused to gaze with some interest at the obelisk known as Cleopatra's Needle. The heat rose in shimmering waves from the asphalt of the roadway, but the stranger was used to heat and he was conscientiously engaged in the duty of seeing New York. Opposite the Museum he seated himself upon a bench in the shade of a faded dogwood and wiped the moisture from his eyes. The glare from the unprotected boulevards was terrific. Under these somewhat unfavourable conditions he was occupied in studying the monument of Egypt's past magnificence when he felt a slight dragging sensation. It was indefinable and had no visual concomitant. But it was as though the brakes were being gently applied to a Pullman train. He was the only human being in the neighbourhood; not even a policeman was visible; and the experience gave him a creepy feeling. Then to his amazement Cleopatra's Needle slowly toppled from its pedestal and fell with a crash across the roadway. At first he thought it an optical illusion and wiped his eyes again, but it was nothing of the kind. The monument, which had a moment before pointed to the zenith, now lay shattered in three pieces upon the softening concrete of the drive. The stranger arose and examined the fragments of the monolith, one of which lay squarely across the road, barring all passage. Round the pedestal were scattered small pieces of broken granite, and from these, after looking about cautiously, he chose one with care and placed it in his pocket.  \"Gosh!\" he whispered to himself as he hurried toward Fifth Avenue. \"That'll just be something to tell 'em at home! Eh, Bill?\"  The dragging sensation experienced by the tourist from St. Louis was felt by many millions of people all over the world, but, as in most countries it occurred coincidently with pronounced earthquake shocks and tremblings, for the most part it passed unnoticed as a specific, individual phenomenon.  Hood, in the wireless room at Georgetown, suddenly heard in his receivers a roar like that of Niagara and quickly removed them from his ears. He had never known such statics. He was familiar with electrical disturbances in the ether, but this was beyond anything in his experience. Moreover, when he next tried to use his instruments he discovered that something had put the whole apparatus out of commission. About an hour later he felt a pronounced pressure in his eardrums, which gradually passed off. The wireless refused to work for nearly eight hours, and it was still recalcitrant when he went off duty at seven o'clock. He had not felt the quivering of the earth round Washington, and being an unimaginative man he accepted the other facts of the situation philosophically. The statics would pass, and then Georgetown would be in communication with the rest of the world again, that was all. At seven o'clock the night shift came in, and Hood borrowed a pipeful of tobacco from him and put on his coat.  \"Say, Bill, did you feel the shock?\" asked the shift, hanging up his hat and taking a match from Hood.  \"No,\" answered the latter, \"but the statics have put the machine on the blink. She'll come round all right in an hour or so. The air's gummy with ions. Shock, did you say?\"  \"Sure. Had 'em all over the country. Say, the boys at the magnetic observatory claim their compass shifted east and west instead of north and south, and stayed that way for five minutes. Didn't you feel the air pressure? I should worry! And say, I just dropped into the Meteorological Department's office and looked at the barometer. She'd jumped up half an inch in about two seconds, wiggled round some, and then come back to normal. You can see the curve yourself if you ask Fraser to show you the self-registering barograph. Some doin's, I tell you!\"  He nodded his head with an air of importance.  \"Take your word for it,\" answered Hood without emotion, save for a slight annoyance at the other's arrogation of superior information. \"'Tain't the first time there's been an earthquake since creation.\" And he strolled out, swinging to the doors behind him.  The night shift settled himself before the instruments with a look of dreary resignation.  \"Say,\" he muttered aloud, \"you couldn't jar that feller with a thirteen-inch bomb! He wouldn't even rub himself!\"  Hood, meantime, bought an evening paper and walked slowly to the district where he lived. It was a fine night and there was no particular excitement in the streets. His wife opened the door.  \"Well,\" she greeted him, \"I'm glad you've come home at last. I was plumb scared something had happened to you. Such a shaking and rumbling and rattling I never did hear! Did you feel it?\"  \"I didn't feel nothin'!\" answered Bill Hood. \"Some one said there was a shock, that was all I heard about it. The machine's out of kilter.\"  \"They won't blame you, will they?\" she asked anxiously.  \"You bet they won't!\" he replied. \"Look here, I'm hungry. Are the waffles ready?\"  \"Have 'em in a jiffy!\" she smiled. \"You go in and read your paper.\"  He did as he was directed, and seated himself in a rocker under the gaslight. After perusing the baseball news he turned back to the front page. The paper was a fairly late edition, containing up-to-the-minute telegraphic notes. In the centre column, alongside the announcement of the annihilation of three entire regiments of Silesians by the explosion of nitroglycerine concealed in dummy gun carriages, was the following:       CLEOPATRA'S NEEDLE FALLS       EARTHQUAKE DESTROYS FAMOUS MONUMENT       SHOCKS FELT HERE AND ALL OVER U. S.       Washington was visited by a succession of earthquake shocks early      this afternoon, which, in varying force, were felt throughout the      United States and Europe. Little damage was done, but those having      offices in tall buildings had an unpleasant experience which they      will not soon forget. A peculiar phenomenon accompanying this      seismic disturbance was the variation of the magnetic needle by over      eighty degrees from north to east and an extraordinary rise and fall      of the barometer. All wireless communication had to be abandoned,      owing to the ionizing of the atmosphere, and up to the time this      edition went to press had not been resumed. Telegrams by way of      Colon report similar disturbances in South America. In New York the      monument in Central Park known as Cleopatra's Needle was thrown from      its pedestal and broken into three pieces. The contract for its      repair and replacement has already been let. The famous monument was      a present from the Khedive of Egypt to the United States, and      formerly stood in Alexandria. The late William H. Vanderbilt      defrayed the expense of transporting it to this country.  Bill Hood read this with scant interest. The Giants had knocked the Braves' pitcher out of the box, and an earthquake seemed a small matter. His mind did not once revert to the mysterious message from Pax the day before. He was thinking of something far more important.  \"Say, Nellie,\" he demanded, tossing aside the paper impatiently, \"ain't those waffles ready yet?\"     III   On that same evening, Thursday, July 22d, two astronomers attached to the Naval Observatory sat in the half darkness of the meridian-circle room watching the firmament sweep slowly across the aperture of the giant lens. The chamber was as quiet as the grave, the two men rarely speaking as they noted their observations. Paris might be taken, Berlin be razed, London put to the torch; a million human beings might be blown into eternity, or the shrieks of mangled creatures lying in heaps before pellet-strewn barbed-wire entanglements "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19174"],["title","The Man Who Rocked the Earth (#2)"],["body","the summer night; great battleships of the line might plunge to the bottom, carrying their crews with them; and the dead of two continents rot unburied--yet unmoved the stars would pursue their nightly march across the heavens, cruel day would follow pitiless night, and the careless earth follow its accustomed orbit as though the race were not writhing in its death agony. Gazing into the infinity of space human existence seemed but the scum upon a rainpool, human warfare but the frenzy of insectivora. Unmindful of the starving hordes of Paris and Berlin, of plague-swept Russia, or of the drowned thousands of the North Baltic Fleet, these two men calmly studied the procession of the stars--the onward bore of the universe through space, and the spectra of newborn or dying worlds.  It was a suffocatingly hot night and their foreheads reeked with sweat. Dim shapes on the walls of the room indicated what by day was a tangle of clockwork and recording instruments, connected by electricity with various buttons and switches upon the table. The brother of the big clock in the wireless operating room hung nearby, its face illuminated by a tiny electric lamp, showing the hour to be eleven-fifty. Occasionally the younger man made a remark in a low tone, and the elder wrote something on a card.  \"The 'seeing' is poor to-night,\" said Evarts, the younger man. \"The upper air is full of striae and, though it seems like a clear night, everything looks dim--a volcanic haze probably. Perhaps the Aleutian Islands are in eruption again.\"  \"Very likely,\" answered Thornton, the elder astronomer. \"The shocks this afternoon would indicate something of the sort.\"  \"Curious performance of the magnetic needle. They say it held due east for several minutes,\" continued Evarts, hoping to engage his senior in conversation--almost an impossibility, as he well knew.  Thornton did not reply. He was carefully observing the infinitesimal approach of a certain star to the meridian line, marked by a thread across the circle's aperture. When that point of light should cross the thread it would be midnight, and July 22, 1916, would be gone forever. Every midnight the indicating stars crossed the thread exactly on time, each night a trifle earlier than the night before by a definite and calculable amount, due to the march of the earth around the sun. So they had crossed the lines in every observatory since clocks and telescopes had been invented. Heretofore, no matter what cataclysm of nature had occurred, the star had always crossed the line not a second too soon or a second too late, but exactly on time. It was the one positively predictable thing, foretellable for ten or for ten thousand years by a simple mathematical calculation. It was surer than death or the tax-man. It was absolute.  Thornton was a reserved man of few words--impersonal, methodical, serious. He spent many nights there with Evarts, hardly exchanging a phrase with him, and then only on some matter immediately concerned with their work. Evarts could dimly see his long, grave profile bending over his eyepiece, shrouded in the heavy shadows across the table. He felt a great respect, even tenderness, for this taciturn, high-principled, devoted scientist. He had never seen him excited, hardly ever aroused. He was a man of figures, whose only passion seemed to be the \"music of the spheres.\"  A long silence followed, during which Thornton seemed to bend more intently than ever over his eyepiece. The hand of the big clock slipped gradually to midnight.  \"There's something wrong with the clock,\" said Thornton suddenly, and his voice sounded curiously dry, almost unnatural. \"Telephone to the equatorial room for the time.\"  Puzzled by Thornton's manner Evarts did as instructed.  \"Forty seconds past midnight,\" came the reply from the equatorial observer.  Evarts repeated the answer for Thornton's benefit, looking at their own clock at the same time. It pointed to exactly forty seconds past the hour. He heard Thornton suppress something like an oath.  \"There's something the matter!\" repeated Thornton dumbly. \"Aeta isn't within five minutes of crossing. Both clocks can't be wrong!\"  He pressed a button that connected with the wireless room.  \"What's the time?\" he called sharply through the nickel-plated speaking-tube.  \"Forty-five seconds past the hour,\" came the answer. Then: \"But I want to see you, sir. There's something queer going on. May I come in?\"  \"Come!\" almost shouted Thornton.  A moment later the flushed face of Williams, the night operator, appeared in the doorway.  \"Excuse me, sir,\" he stammered, \"but something fierce must have happened! I thought you ought to know. The Eiffel Tower has been trying to talk to us for over two hours, but I can't get what he's saying.\"  \"What's the matter--atmospherics?\" snapped Evarts.  \"No; the air _was_ full of them, sir--shrieking with them you might say; but they've stopped now. The trouble has been that I've been jammed by the Brussels station talking to the Belgian Congo--same wave length--and I couldn't tune Brussels out. Every once in a while I'd get a word of what Paris was saying, and it's always the same word--'_heure_.' But just now Brussels stopped sending and I got the complete message of the Eiffel Tower. They wanted to know our time by Greenwich. I gave it to 'em. Then Paris said to tell you to take your transit with great care and send result to them immediately----\"  The ordinarily calm Thornton gave a great suspiration and his face was livid. \"Aeta's just crossed--we're five minutes out! Evarts, am I crazy? Am I talking straight?\"  Evarts laid his hand on the other's arm.  \"The earthquake's knocked out your transit,\" he suggested.  \"And Paris--how about Paris?\" asked Thornton. He wrote something down on a card mechanically and started for the door. \"Get me the Eiffel Tower!\" he ordered Williams.  The three men stood motionless, as the wireless man sent the Eiffel Tower call hurtling across the Atlantic:  \"ETA--ETA--ETA.\"  \"All right,\" whispered Williams, \"I've got 'em.\"  \"Tell Paris that our clocks are all out five minutes according to the meridian.\"  Williams worked the key rapidly, and then listened.  \"The Eiffel Tower says that their chronometers also appear to be out by the same time, and that Greenwich and Moscow both report the same thing. Wait a minute! He says Moscow has wired that at eight o'clock last evening a tremendous aurora of bright yellow light was seen to the northwest, and that their spectroscopes showed the helium line only. He wants to know if we have any explanation to offer----\"  \"Explanation!\" gasped Evarts. \"Tell Paris that we had earthquake shocks here together with violent seismic movements, sudden rise in barometer, followed by fall, statics, and erratic variation in the magnetic needle.\"  \"What does it all mean?\" murmured Thornton, staring blankly at the younger man.  The key rattled and the rotary spark whined into a shriek. Then silence.  \"Paris says that the same manifestations have been observed in Russia, Algeria, Italy, and London,\" called out Williams. \"Ah! What's that? Nauen's calling.\" Again he sent the blue flame crackling between the coils. \"Nauen reports an error of five minutes in their meridian observations according to the official clocks. And hello! He says Berlin has capitulated and that the Russians began marching through at daylight--that is about two hours ago. He says he is about to turn the station over to the Allied Commissioners, who will at once assume charge.\"  Evarts whistled.  \"How about it?\" he asked of Thornton.  The latter shook his head gravely.  \"It may be--explainable--or,\" he added hoarsely, \"it may mean the end of the world.\"  Williams sprang from his chair and confronted Thornton.  \"What do you mean?\" he almost shouted.  \"Perhaps the universe is running down!\" said Evarts soothingly. \"At any rate, keep it to yourself, old chap. If the jig is up there's no use scaring people to death a month or so too soon!\"  Thornton grasped an arm of each.  \"Not a word of this to anybody!\" he ground out through compressed lips. \"Absolute silence, or hell may break loose on earth!\"     IV   Free translation of the Official Report of the Imperial Commission of the Berlin Academy of Science to the Imperial Commissioners of the German Federated States:       The unprecedented cosmic phenomena which occurred on the 22d and      27th days of the month of July, and which were felt over the entire      surface of the globe, have left a permanent effect of such      magnitude on the position of the earth's axis in space and the      duration of the period of the rotation, that it is impossible to      predict at the present time the ultimate changes or modifications      in the climatic conditions which may follow. This commission has      considered most carefully the possible causes that may have been      responsible for this catastrophe--(_Weltunfall_)--and by      eliminating every hypothesis that was incapable of explaining all      of the various disturbances, is now in a position to present two      theories, either one of which appears to be capable of explaining      the recent disturbances.       The phenomena in question may be briefly summarized as follows;       1. THE YELLOW AURORA. In Northern Europe this appeared suddenly on      the night of July 22d as a broad, faint sheaf--(_Lichtbündel_)--of      clear yellow light in the western sky. Reports from America show      that at Washington it appeared in the north as a narrow shaft of      light, inclined at an angle of about thirty degrees with the      horizon, and shooting off to the east. Near the horizon it was      extremely brilliant, and the spectroscope showed that the light was      due to glowing helium gas.       The Potsdam Observatory reported that the presence of sodium has      been detected in the aurora; but this appears to have been a mistake      due to the faintness of the light and the circumstance"]]]
