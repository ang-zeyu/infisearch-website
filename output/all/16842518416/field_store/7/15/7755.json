CHAPTER II.  RUNNING AWAY TO CHURCH.   The little Parlins came the next week. One Sunday morning Dotty Dimple stood before the glass, putting on her hat for church. Katie came and peeped in with her, opening her small mouth and drawing her lips over her teeth, as her grandfather did when he shaved.  \"See, Flyaway, you haven't any dimples at all!\" said Dotty, primping a little. \"Your hair isn't smooth and curly like mine; it sticks up all over your head, like a little fan.\"  \"O, my shole!\" sighed Flyaway, scowling at herself. She did not know how lovely she was, nor how      \"The light of the heaven she came from     Still lingered and gleamed in her hair.\"  \"I wisht 'twouldn't get out,\" said she.  \"What do you mean by _out_?\"  \"O, unwetted, and un-comb-bid, and un-parted.\"  \"That's because you fly about like such a little witch.\"  \"I doesn't do the leastest nuffin, Dotty Dimpwill! Folks ought to let me to go to churches.\"  \"I _should_ laugh, Fly Clifford, to see _you_ going to churches! All the ministers would come down out of the pulpits and ask what little mischief that was, and make aunt 'Ria carry you home!\"  \"No, he wouldn't, too! I'd sit stiller'n two, free, five hundred mouses,\" pleaded Flyaway, climbing up the back of a chair to show how quiet she could be.  \"O, it's no use to talk about it, darling. Give me one kiss, and I'll go get my sun-shade.\"  \"Can't, Dotty Dimpwill! My mamma's kiss I'll keep; it's ahind my mouf; she's gone to 'Dusty.  \"Well, 'keep it ahind your mouf,' then; and here's another to put with it. What _do_ you s'pose makes me love to kiss you so?\"  \"O, 'cause I so sweet,\" replied Flyaway, promptly; but she was not thinking of her own sweetness, just then; she was wondering if she could manage to run away to church.  \"I'se a-goin' there myse'f! Sit still's a--a--\" She looked around for a comparison, and saw a grasshopper on the window-sill: \"still's a _gas-papa_. Man won't say nuffin' to me, see 'f he does!\"  Strange such an innocent-looking child could be so sly! She ran down the path with Horace, kissing her little hand to everybody for good by, all the while thinking how she could steal off to church without being seen.  \"You may go up stairs and lie down with me on my bed,\" said grandma, who was not very well. So Katie climbed upon the bed.  \"My dee gamma, I so solly you's sick!\" said she, stroking Mrs. Parlin's face, and picking open her eyelids. But after patting and \"pooring\" the dear lady for some time, she thought she had made her \"all well,\" and then was anxious to get away. Mrs. Parlin wished to keep her up stairs as long as possible, because Ruth had a toothache.  \"Shan't I tell you a story, dear?\" said she.  \"Yes, um; tell 'bout a long baby--no, a long story 'bout a short baby.\"  \"Well, once there was a king, and he had a daughter--\"  \"O, no, gamma, not that! Tell me 'bout baby that _didn't_ be on the bul-yushes; I don't want to hear 'bout _Mosey_!\"  Grandma smiled, and wondered if people, in the good old Bible days, were in the habit of using pet names, and if Pharaoh's daughter ever called the Hebrew boy \"Mosey.\" She was about to begin another story, when Flyaway said, \"Guess I'll go out, now,\" and slid off the bed. There was an orange on the table. She took it, held it behind her, and walked quickly to the door. Looking back, she saw that her grandmother was watching her.  \"What you looking at, gamma? 'Cause I'm are goin' to bring the ollinge right back.\"  And so she did, but not because it was wrong to keep it. Flyaway had no conscience, or, if she had any, it was very small, folded up out of sight, like a leaf-bud on a tree in the spring.  \"Ask Ruthie to wash your face and hands, and then come right back to grandma and hear the story.\"  \"Yes um.\"  Down stairs she pattered. The moment Ruth had kissed her, and turned away to make a poultice, she crept into the nursery, and put on Horace's straw hat. Then she took from a corner an old cane of her grandfather's, and from the paper-rack a daily newspaper, and started out in great glee. The \"Journal\" she hugged to her heart, and her short dress she held up to her waist, \"'Cause I s'pect I mus' keep it out o' the mud,\" said she, as anxiously as any lady with a train.  She had no trouble in finding the church, for the road was straight, but the cane kept tripping her up.  \"Naughty fing! Wisht I hadn't took you, to-day, you act so bad!\" said she, picking herself up for the fifth time, and slinging the \"naughty fing\" across her shoulder like a gun. When she came to the meeting-house there was not a soul to be seen. \"Guess they's eatin' dinner in here,\" decided Flyaway, after looking about for a few seconds. \"Guess I'll go up chamer, see where the folks is.\"  [Illustration: RUNNING AWAY TO CHURCH.]  Up stairs she clattered, hitting the balusters with her cane. Good Mr. Lee was preaching from the text, \"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy,\" and people could not imagine who was naughty enough to make such a noise outside--thump, thump, thump.  \"Who's that a-talkin'?\" thought Flyaway, startled by Mr. Lee's voice. \"O, ho! that's the _prayer-man_ a-talkin'. He makes me kind o' 'fraid!\"  But just at that minute she had reached the top of the stairs, and was standing in the doorway.  \"O, my shole! so _many_ folks!\"  She trembled, and was about to run away with her newspaper and cane; but her eyes, in roving wildly about, fell upon grandpa Parlin and all the rest of them, in a pew very near the pulpit. Then she thought it must be all right, and, taking courage, she marched slowly up the aisle, swinging the cane right and left.  Everybody looked up in surprise as the droll little figure crept by. Grandpa frowned through his spectacles, and aunt Louise shook her head; but Horace hid his face in a hymn-book and Dotty Dimple actually smiled.  \"They didn't know _I_ was a-comin',\" thought Flyaway, \"but I camed!\"  And with that she fluttered into the pew.  \"Naughty, naughty girl,\" said aunt Louise, in an awful whisper.  She longed to take up the morsel of naughtiness, called Katie, in her thumb and finger, shake it, and carry it out. But there was a twinkle in the little one's eye that might mean mischief; she did not dare touch her.  \"O, what a child!\" said aunt Louise, taking off the big hat and setting Flyaway down on the seat as hard as she could.  Flyaway looked up, through her veil of flossy hair, at her pretty auntie with the roses round her face.  \"Nobody didn't take 'are o' me to my house,\" said she, in a loud whisper, \"and _that's_ what is it!\"  \"Hush!\" said aunt Louise, giving Flyaway another shake, which frightened her so that she dropped her head on her brother's shoulder, and sat perfectly still for half a minute.  Aunt Louise was sadly mortified, and so were Susy and Prudy. They dared not look up, for they thought everybody was gazing straight at the Parlin pew, and laughing at their crazy little relative. Horace and Dotty Dimple did not care in the least; they thought it very funny.  \"They shan't scold at my cunning little Topknot,\" whispered Horace, consolingly. \"Sit still, darling, and when we get home I'll give you a cent.\"  \"Yes um, I will,\" replied poor brow-beaten Flyaway, and held up her head again with the best of them. Perhaps she had been naughty; perhaps folks were going to snip her fingers; but \"Hollis\" was on her side now and forever. She began to feel quite contented. She had got inside the church at last, and was very well pleased with it. It was even queerer than she had expected.  \"What was that high-up thing the prayer-man was a-standin' on?\"  Flyaway merely asked this of her own wise little brain. She concluded it must be \"a chimley.\"  \"Great red curtains ahind him,\" added she, still conversing with her own little brain. \"Lots o' great big bubbles on the walls all round. Big's a tea-kiddle! Lamps, I s'pose. There's that table. Where's the cups and saucers for the supper? And the tea-pot?  \"All the bodies everywhere had their bonnets on; why for? Didn't say a word, and the prayer-man kep' a-talkin' all the time; why for? Flywer didn't talk; no indeed. Folks mus'n't. If folks did, then the man would come down out the chimley and tell the other bodies to carry 'em home. 'Cause it's the holy Sabber-day,--and _that's_ what is it.\"  Flyaway's airy brain went dancing round and round. She slid away from Horace's shoulder, spread her little length upon the seat, closed her wondering, tired eyes, and sailed off to Noddle's Island. A fly, buzzing in from out doors, had long been trying to settle on Flyaway's restless nose. He never did settle: Horace kept guard with a palm-leaf fan, and \"all the other bodies\" in the pew sat as still as if they had been nailed down; so anxious were they to keep the little sleeper safely harbored at Noddle's Island.  \"Such a relief!\" thought aunt Louise, venturing to look up once more.  Flyaway did not waken till the last prayer, when Horace held her fast, lest she should make a sudden rush upon a speckled dog, which came trotting up the aisle.  On the steps they met Ruth, with wild eyes and face tied up in a scarf, hunting for Flyaway. Mrs. Parlin, she said, was going up the hill, so frightened that it would make her \"down sick.\"  When grandma got home, all out of breath, she found Flyaway looking very downcast. Her heart was heavy under so many scoldings. \"O, Katie,\" said grandma, \"how could you run away?\"  \"I didn't yun away,\" replied Flyaway, thrusting her finger into her mouth; \"I _walked_ away!\"  \"There, if that isn't a cunning baby, where'll you find one?\" whispered brother Horace to Prudy. \"Grandmother can't punish her after such a 'cute speech.\"  But grandmother could, and did. She took her by the little soft hand, led her to the china closet, and locked her in.  \"Half an hour you must stay there,\" said she, \"and think what a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19247"],["title","Dotty Dimple's Flyaway (#2)"],["body","girl you've been!\"  \"Yes um,\" said Flyaway, meekly, and wiped off a tear with the hem of her frock.  But the moment she was left alone, her quick, observing eyes saw something which gave her a thrill of delight. It was a jar of quince jelly, which had been left by accident on the lower shelf.  \"'Cause I spect I likes um,\" said she, serenely, after eating all she possibly could.  At the end of half an hour grandma came and turned the key.  \"Have you been thinking, dear, and are you sorry and ready to come out?\"  \"Yes, um,\" replied the little culprit, with her mouth full, and feeling very brave as long as the door was shut between her and her jailer. \"Yes, um, I've thought it all up,--defful solly. _But_ you won't never shut me up no more, gamma Parlin!\"  \"Katie Clifford!\" said grandma, sternly; and then she opened the door, and faced Flyaway.  \"'Cause--'cause--_'cause_,\" cried the little one, in great alarm; \"you won't shut me up, 'cause I won't never walk away no more, gamma Parlin!\"  Mrs. Parlin tried hard not to smile; but the mixture on Flyaway's little face of naughtiness, jelly, and fright, was very funny to see.  The child noticed that her grandmother's brows knit as if in displeasure, and then she remembered the jelly.  \"I hasn't been a-touchin' your 'serves, gamma,\" said she.  Mrs. Parlin really did not know what to do,--Flyaway's conscience was _so_ little and folded away in so many thicknesses, like a tiny pearl in a whole box of cotton wool. How could anybody get at it?  \"Gamma, I hasn't been a-touchin' your 'serves,\" repeated the little thief.  \"Ah, don't tell me that,\" said grandma, sadly; \"I see it in your eye!\"  \"What, gamma, the _'serves_ in my eye?\" said Flyaway, putting up her finger to find out for herself. \"'Cause I put 'em in my _mouf_, I did.\"  Mrs. Parlin washed the little pilferer's face and hands, took her in her lap, and tried to feel her way through the cotton wool to the tiny conscience.  The child looked up and listened to all the good words, and when they had been spoken over and over, this was what she said:--  \"O, gamma, you's got such pitty little wrinkles!\"     CHAPTER III.  RUNNING AWAY TO HEAVEN.   About ten o'clock one morning, Flyaway was sitting in the little green chamber with Dotty Dimple and Jennie Vance, bathing her doll's feet in a glass of water. Dinah had a dreadful headache, and her forehead was bandaged with a red ribbon.  \"_Does_ you feel any better?\" asked Flyaway, tenderly, from time to time; but Dinah had such a habit of never answering, that it was of no use to ask her any questions.  Dotty Dimple and Jennie were talking very earnestly.  \"I do wish I did know where Charlie Gray is!\" said Dotty, looking through the open window at a bird flying far aloft into the blue sky.  \"You do know,\" answered Jennie, quickly; \"he's in heaven.\"  \"Yes, of course; but so high up--O, so high up,\" sighed Dotty, \"it makes you dizzy to think.\"  \"Can um see we?\" struck in little Flyaway, holding to Dinah's flat nose a bottle of reviving soap suds.  \"Prudy says it's beautiful to be dead,\" added Dotty, without heeding the question; \"beautiful to be dead.\"  \"Shtop!\" cried Flyaway; \"I's a-talkin'. Does um see _we_?\"  \"O, I don' know, Fly Clifford; you'll have to ask the minister.\"  Flyaway squeezed the water from Dinah's ragged feet, and dropped her under the table, headache and all. Then she tipped over the goblet, and flew to the window.  \"The Charlie boy likes canny seeds; I'll send him some,\" said she, pinning a paper of sugared spices to the window curtain, and drawing it up by means of the tassel. \"O, dear, um don't go high enough. Charlie won't get 'em.\"  \"Why, what is that baby trying to do?\" said Dotty Dimple.  \"Charlie's defful high up,\" murmured Flyaway, heaving a little sigh; \"can't get the canny seeds.\"  \"O, what a Fly! How big do you s'pose her mind is, Jennie Vance?\"  \"Big as a thimble, perhaps,\" replied Jennie, doubtfully.  \"Why, I shouldn't think, now, 'twas any larger than the head of a pin,\" said Dotty, with decision; \"s'poses heaven is top o' this room! Why, Jennie Vance, I _persume_ it's ever so much further off 'n Mount Blue--don't you?\"  \"O, yes, indeed! What queer ideas such children do have! Flyaway doesn't understand but very little we say, Dotty Dimple; not but very little.\"  Flyaway turned round with one of her wise looks. She thought she did understand; at any rate she was catching every word, and stowing it away in her little bit of a brain for safe keeping. Heaven was on Mount Blue. She had learned so much.  \"But I knowed it by-fore,\" said she to herself, with a proud toss of the silky plume on the crown of her head.  \"Shall we take her with us?\" asked Jennie Vance.  Flyaway listened eagerly; she thought they were still talking of heaven, when in truth Jennie only meant a concert which was to be given that afternoon at the vestry.  \"Take _that_ little snip of a child!\" replied Dotty; \"O, no; she isn't big enough; 'twouldn't be any use to pay money for _her!_\"  With which very cutting remark Dotty swept out of the room, in her queenly way, followed by Jennie. Flyaway threw herself across a pillow, and moaned,--  \"O, dee, dee!\"  Her little heart was ready to bleed; and this wasn't the first time, either. Those great big girls were always running away from her, and calling her \"goosies\" and \"snips;\" and now they meant to climb to heaven, where Charlie was, and leave her behind.  \"But I won't stay down here in this place; I'll go to heaven too, now, _cerdily_!\" She sprang from the pillow and stood on one foot, like a strong-minded little robin that will not be trifled with by a worm. \"I'll go too, now, cerdily.\"  Having made up her mind, she hurried as fast as she could, and tucked a stick of candy in her pocket, also the bottle of soap suds, and two thirds of a \"curly cookie\" shaped like a leaf. \"Charlie would be so glad to see Fly-wer!\" She purred like a contented kitten as she thought about it. \"'Haps they've got a _bossy-cat_ up there, and a piggy, and a swing. O, my shole!\"  There was no time to be lost. Flyaway must overtake the girls, and, if possible, get to heaven before they did. She flew about like a distracted butterfly.  \"I must have some skipt; her said me's too little to pay for money;\" and she curled her pretty red lip; \"but I'm isn't much little; man'll _want_ some skipt.\"  For she fancied somebody standing at the door of heaven holding out his hand like the ticket-man at the depot. She found her mother's purse in the writing-desk, and scattered its contents into the wash-bowl, then picked out the wettest \"skipt,\" a five-dollar bill, and tucked it into her bosom. This would make it all right at the door of heaven.  \"Now my spetty-curls,\" she added, hunting in the \"uppest drawer\" till she found the eyeless spectacles used for playing \"old lady.\" With these on, Flyaway thought she could see the way a great deal better. Horace's boots would help her up hill; so she jumped into those, and clattered down the back stairs with Dinah under her arm.  There was nobody in the kitchen, for Ruthie was down cellar sweeping. Flyaway caught her shaker off the \"short nail,\" and stole out without being seen. Sitting in the sun on the piazza was the \"blue\" kittie. \"Finkin' 'bout a mouse, I spect,\" said little Flyaway, seizing her and blowing open her eyes like a couple of rosebuds.  \"Does you know where I's a-goin'? Up to heaven. We don't let tinty folks, like cats, go to heaven.\"  Pussy winked sorrowfully at this, and baby's tender heart was touched.  \"Yes, we does,\" said she; \"but you musn't scwatch the Charlie boy;\" and she tucked the \"tinty folks\" under her left arm. Then all was ready, and the little pilgrim started for heaven.  \"Um's on the toppest hill,\" said she, looking at the far-off mountains, reaching up against the blue sky. One mountain was much higher than the others, and on that she fixed her eye. It was Mount Blue, and was really twenty miles away. If Flyaway should ever reach that cloud-capped peak, it was not her wee, wee feet which would carry her there. But the baby had no idea of distances. She went out of the yard as fast as the big boots would allow. She felt as brave as a little fly trying to walk the whole length of the Chinese Wall.  Where were Dotty Dimple and Jennie Vance? O, they were half way to heaven by this time; she must \"hurry quick.\"  The fact was, they were \"up in the Pines,\" picking strawberries. Nobody saw Flyaway but a caterpillar.  \"O, my shole! there's a _catty-pillow_--what he want, you fink?\"  Kitty winked and Dinah sulked, but there was no reply.  The next thing they met was a grasshopper. \"O, dee, a _gas-papa_! Where you s'pose um goin'?\"  Kitty winked again and Dinah sulked.  Flyaway answered her own question. \"Diny, dat worm gone see his mamma.\"  Dinah did not care anything about the family feelings of the \"worms;\" so she kept her red silk mouth shut; but she grew very heavy--so heavy, indeed, that once her little mother dropped her in the sand, but picking her up, shook her and trudged on. Presently she dropped something else, and this time it was the kitty. Flyaway turned about in dismay.  \"Shtop,\" cried she, scowling through her \"spetty-curls,\" as she saw three white paws and one blue one go tripping over the road. \"Shtop!\" But the paws kept on.  \"O, Diny,\" said Flyaway, as pussy's tail disappeared round a corner,--\"O, Diny, her don't want to go to heaven!\"  Then Flyaway sat down in the sand, and pulled off one of the big boots.  \"Um won't walk,\" said she; but, before she had time to pull off the second one, a dog came along and frightened her so she tried to run, though she only hopped on one foot, and dragged the other. She did not know what the matter was till she fell down and the boot came off of itself, after which she could walk very well. What cared she that both \"Hollis's\" new boots were left in the road, ready to be crushed by wagon wheels?  She kept on and kept on; but where was that blue"]]]
