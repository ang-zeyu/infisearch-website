It shall be the first thing they see when they come back home, and the last thing for them to remember when they leave England. I'll have it everywhere. I'll rub their noses in it. And then, Splurge, they'll ask for Cheezo when they want cheese, and that will mean I shall have the monopoly of all the cheese in the world.  SPLURGE: You're a great man, sir.  SLADDER: I'll be a greater one, Splurge. I'm not past work yet. What more have you got?  SPLURGE: I've rather a nice little poster being done, sir. A boy and a girl looking at one another with a rather knowing look. There's a large query mark all over the girl's dress. Then over the top in big letters I've put: \"What is the secret?\" and in smaller letters: \"I've got a bit of Cheezo.\" It _makes_ people look at it, the children's faces are so wicked.  SLADDER: Good, Splurge. Very good. I'll have that one. I'll rub their noses in that one.  SPLURGE: Then I've got some things for the Press. (_Reads._) \"She: 'Darling.' He: 'Yes, wifey.' She: 'You won't forget, darling.' He: 'No, wifey.' She: 'You won't forget to bring me some of that excellent Cheezo, so nutritious, so nice for darling baby, to be had at all grocers; but be sure that you find the name of Sladder on their well-known pink wrappers.' He: 'Certainly, wifey.'\" Just the usual thing, sir, of course; only I have a very good little picture to go with it, very suggestive indeed; I've made all the arrangements with the Press and the bill-posters, sir. I think we'll make a big thing of it, sir.  SLADDER: Well, Splurge, nothing remains to be done now, except to make the Cheezo.  SPLURGE: How do you think of doing it, sir?  SLADDER: Do you know how they kill pigs in Chicago? No, you've not travelled yet. Well, they get their pigs on a slide, one man cuts their throats as fast as they go by, another shaves their bristles, and so on, and so on; one man for each job, and all at it at once; they do it very expeditiously. Well, there's an interfering fellow sent there by the Government (we wouldn't stand him in England), and if a pig has a sign of tuberculosis on him he won't let that pig go down. Now you'd think that pig was wasted. He isn't. He goes into soap. Now, Splurge, how many cakes of soap were used in the world last year?  SPLURGE (_getting up_): Last year? I don't think we have the figures in for last year yet, sir.  [_He goes to bookshelf._  SLADDER: Well, the year before will do.  SPLURGE: (_taking book and turning pages_): The figures are given, I think, sir, from the 1st of March to the 1st of March.  SLADDER: That will do.  SPLURGE: Ah, here it is, sir. Soap statistics for the twelve months ending 1st of March this year. A hundred and four million users, using on an average twenty cakes each per year. Then there are partial users, and occasional users. The total would be about twenty-one hundred million, sir.  SLADDER: Pure waste, Splurge, all pure waste.  SPLURGE: Waste, sir?  SLADDER: Pure waste. What do you suppose becomes of all that soap, all that good fat? Proteids, I think they call 'em. And proteids are _good_ for you, Splurge.  SPLURGE: What _becomes_ of them, sir? They're used up.  SLADDER: No, Splurge. They disappear, I grant you. They float away. But they're still there Splurge, they're still there. All that good fat is somewhere.  SPLURGE: But--but, sir--but--In the drains, sir?  SLADDER: All those million of cakes of soap. There must be tons of it, Splurge. And we'll _get_ it.  SPLURGE: You are a wonderful man, sir.  SLADDER: O, I've a few brains, Splurge. That anyone might have. But I use mine, that's all. There's cleverer people than me in the world----  SPLURGE: No, sir.  SLADDER: O, yes, there are. Lots of them. But they're damned fools. And why? 'Cause they don't use their brains. They mess about learning Greek. Greek! Can you believe it? What good does Greek ever do them?... But the money's not made yet, Splurge.  SPLURGE: I'm having it well advertised, sir.  SLADDER: Not so fast. What if they won't eat it?  SPLURGE: O, they'll eat it all right when it's advertised, sir. They eat everything that's advertised.  SLADDER: What if they can't eat it, Splurge?  SPLURGE: Can't, sir?  SLADDER: Send for my daughter.  SPLURGE: Yes, sir. (_He rises and goes to the door._)  SLADDER: The battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of some damned place. A million of money will be won or lost in this house in five minutes.  SPLURGE: In this house, sir?  SLADDER: Yes, in Ermyntrude's sitting-room. Send for her.  SPLURGE: Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Miss Sladder! Miss Sladder!  ERMYNTRUDE (_off_): Yes, Mr. Splurge.  SPLURGE: Would you come to the study, miss, Mr. Sladder wants to speak to you.  ERMYNTRUDE: O, yes, Mr. Splurge.  SLADDER: The test! The test!  [_Re-enter_ SPLURGE.  SPLURGE: Miss Sladder is coming, sir.  SLADDER: The test!  [_Enter_ ERMYNTRUDE.  ERMYNTRUDE: What is it, father?  SLADDER: How are your white mice, child?  ERMYNTRUDE: Quite well, father, both of them.  Sladder (_draws a box from his pocket, takes out a little bit of cheese_): Give them that, Ermyntrude.  ERMYNTRUDE: That, father. What is it?  SLADDER: Cheese.  ERMYNTRUDE: May I have a bit?  SLADDER: No, don't touch it!  ERMYNTRUDE: Very well, father.  SLADDER: If they eat it, you shall have----  ERMYNTRUDE: What, father?  SLADDER: Anything, everything. Only go and give them the cheese.  ERMYNTRUDE: All right, father.  [_She moves to the door R., she looks round, then goes out by the French window instead._  SLADDER: Why are you going that way, child?  ERMYNTRUDE: O--er--I thought it would be nice to go round over the lawn, father. I can get in by the drawing-room.  SLADDER: O, very well. Be quick, dear.  ERMYNTRUDE: All right, father.  [_The magnet that has attracted_ ERMYNTRUDE _to the lawn now appears in the form of_ MR. HIPPANTHIGH, _passing the window on his way to the hall-door._ SLADDER _and_ SPLURGE _do not see him, having their backs to the window._ ERMYNTRUDE _looks round now and then to be sure of this. They hold hands longer than is laid down as necessary in books upon etiquette under the head of visiting. She gives him a look of glad and hopeful interrogation but he shakes his head solemnly, and passes gravely on, as one whose errand is no cheerful duty. She looks after him, then goes her way._  SLADDER: Well, Splurge, we can only wait. (_With emphasis._) If these mice eat it----  SPLURGE: Yes, sir?  SLADDER: The public will eat it.  SPLURGE: Ah!  SLADDER: Any other business to-day?  SPLURGE: O, only the cook, sir. He's complaining about the vegetables, sir. He says he's never been anywhere before where they didn't buy them. We get them out of the kitchen garden here, and it seems he doesn't understand it. Says he won't serve a greengrocer, sir.  SLADDER: A kitchen garden is the wrong thing, is it?  SPLURGE: He says so, sir.  SLADDER: But there was one here when we came.  SPLURGE: O, only country people, sir. I suppose they didn't know any better.  SLADDER: Well, where do people grow vegetables, then?  SPLURGE: I asked the cook that, sir, and he said they don't grow them, they buy them.  SLADDER: O, all right, then. Let him buy them, then. We must do the right thing.  [_The hall-door bell rings._  SLADDER: Hullo! Who's ringing my bell?  SPLURGE: That was the hall-door, wasn't it, sir?  SLADDER: Yes. What are they ringing it for?  [_Enter_ BUTLER.  BUTLER: Mr. Hippanthigh has called to see you, sir.  SLADDER: Called to see me! What about?  BUTLER: He didn't inform me, sir.  SLADDER: I say, Splurge, have I got to see him?  SPLURGE: I think so, sir. I think they call on one another like that in the country.  SLADDER: Good lord, whatever for? (_To_ BUTLER.) O, yes. I'll see him, I'll see him.  BUTLER: Very good, sir, I'll inform him so, sir.  [_Exit._  SLADDER: I say, Splurge, I suppose I've got to have a butler, and all that, eh?  SPLURGE: O, yes, sir. One at least. It's quite necessary.  SLADDER: You--you couldn't have bought me a cheerfuller one now, could you?  SPLURGE: I'm afraid not, sir. If you were to take all this too lightheartedly, the other landowners would hardly like it, you know.  SLADDER: O, well! O, well! What kind of man is this Hippanthigh that's coming?  SPLURGE: He's the man that quarrels with the bishop, sir.  SLADDER: O, the curate. O, yes. I've heard about him. He's been here before, I think. Lawn tennis.  [_Enter_ BUTLER.  BUTLER: Mr. Hippanthigh, sir.  [_Enter_ HIPPANTHIGH. _Exit_ BUTLER.  SLADDER: How do you do, Mr. Hippanthigh? How do you do? Pleased to see you.  HIPPANTHIGH: I wished to speak with you, Mr. Sladder, if you will permit me.  SLADDER: Certainly, Mr. Hippanthigh, certainly. Take a chair.  HIPPANTHIGH: Thank you, sir. I think I would sooner stand.  SLADDER: Please yourself. Please yourself.  HIPPANTHIGH: I wished to speak with you alone, sir.  SLADDER: Alone, eh? Alone? (_Aside to_ SPLURGE.) It's usual, eh? (_To_ HIPPANTHIGH.) Alone, of course, yes. You've come to call, haven't you. (_Exit_ SPLURGE.) Can I offer you--er, er--calling's not much in my line, you know--but what I mean is--will you have a bottle of champagne?  HIPPANTHIGH: Mr. Sladder, I've come to speak with you because I believe it to be my duty to do so. I have hesitated to come, but when for particular reasons it became most painful to me to do so, then I knew that it was my clear duty, and I have come.  SLADDER: O, yes, what they call a duty call. O, yes, quite so. Yes, exactly.  HIPPANTHIGH: Mr. Sladder, many of my parishioners are acquainted with the thing that you sell as bread. (_From the moment of_ HIPPANTHIGH'S _entry till now_ SLADDER, _over-cheerful and anxious, has been struggling to do and say the right thing through all the complications of a visit; but now that the note of Business has been sounded he suddenly knows where he is and becomes alert and stern, and all there._)  SLADDER: What? Virilo?"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19393"],["title","Plays of Near & Far (#8)"],["body","IPPANTHIGH: Yes. They pay more for it than they pay for bread, because they've been taught somehow, poor fools, that \"they must have the best.\" They've been made to believe that it makes them, what they call virile, poor fools, and they're growing ill on it. Not so ill that I can prove anything, and the doctor daren't help me.  SLADDER: Are you aware, Mr. Hippanthigh, that if you said in public what you're saying to me, you would go to prison for it, unless you can run to the very heavy fine--damages would be enormous.  HIPPANTHIGH: I know that, Mr. Sladder, and so I have come to you as the last hope for my people.  SLADDER: Are you aware, Mr. Hippanthigh, that you are making an attack upon business? I don't say that business is as pure as a surplice. But I do say that in business it is--as you may not understand--get on or go under; and without my business, or the business of the next man, who is doing his best to beat me, what would happen to trade? I don't know what's going to happen to England if you get rid of her trade, Mr. Hippanthigh.... Well?... When we're broke because we've been doing business with surplices on, what are the other countries going to do, Mr. Hippanthigh? Can you answer me that?  HIPPANTHIGH: No, Mr. Sladder.  SLADDER: Ah! So I've got the best of you?  HIPPANTHIGH: Yes, Mr. Sladder. I'm not so clever as you.  SLADDER: Glad you admit the point. As for cleverness it isn't that I've so much of that, but I use what I've got. Well, have you anything more to say?  HIPPANTHIGH: Only to appeal to you, Mr. Sladder, on behalf of these poor people.  SLADDER: Why. But you admitted one must have business, and that it can't be run like a tea-party. What more do you want?  HIPPANTHIGH: I want you to spare them, Mr. Sladder.  SLADDER: Spare them? Spare them? Why, what's the matter with them? I'm not killing them.  HIPPANTHIGH: No, Mr. Sladder, you're not killing them. The mortality among children's a bit on the high side, but I wouldn't say that was entirely due to your bread. There's a good many minor ailments among the grown-up people, it seems to attack their digestion mostly, one can't trace each case to its source; but their health and their teeth aren't what they were when they had the pure wheaten bread.  SLADDER: But there _is_ wheat in my bread, prepared by a special process.  HIPPANTHIGH: Ah! It's that special process that does it, I expect.  SLADDER: Well, they needn't buy it if it isn't good.  HIPPANTHIGH: Ah, they can't help themselves, poor fools; they've been taught to do it from their childhood up. Virilo, Bredo and Weeto, that are all so much better than bread, it's a choice between these three. Bread is never advertised, or God's good wheat.  SLADDER: Mr. Hippanthigh, if I'm too much of a fool to sell my goods I suffer for it; if they're such fools as to buy my Virilo, they suffer for it--that is to say, you say they do--that is a natural law that may be new to you. But why should I suffer more than them? Besides, if I take my Virilo off the market just to oblige you, Mr. Hippanthigh, a little matter of £30,000 a year----  HIPPANTHIGH: I--er----  SLADDER: O, don't mention it. Any little trifle to oblige! But if I did, up would go the sales of Bredo and Weeto (which have nothing to do with my firm), and your friends wouldn't be any better for that let me tell you, for I happen to know how _they're_ made.  HIPPANTHIGH: I am not speaking of the wickedness of others. I come to appeal to you, Mr. Sladder, that for nothing that _you_ do, our English race shall lose anything of its ancient strength, in its young men in their prime, or that they should grow infirm a day sooner than God intended, when He planned his course for man.  ERMYNTRUDE (_off_): Father! Father!  [SLADDER _draws himself up, and stands erect to meet the decisive news that he has expected._  [_Enter_ ERMYNTRUDE.  ERMYNTRUDE: Father! The mice have eaten the cheese.  SLADDER: Ah! The public will---- O! (_He has suddenly seen_ HIPPANTHIGH).  HIPPANTHIGH (_solemnly_): What new wickedness is this, Mr. Sladder? (_All stand silent._) Good-bye, Mr. Sladder.  [_He goes to the door, passing_ ERMYNTRUDE. _He looks at her and sighs as he goes. He passes_ MRS. SLADDER _near the door, and bows in silence._  [_Exit._  ERMYNTRUDE: What have you been saying to Mr. Hippanthigh, father?  SLADDER: Saying! He's been doing all the saying. He doesn't let you do much saying, does Hippanthigh.  ERMYNTRUDE: But, father. What did he come to see you about?  SLADDER: He came to call your poor old father all kinds of bad names, he did. It seems your old father is a wicked fellow, Ermyntrude.  ERMYNTRUDE: O, father, I'm sure he never meant it.  [HIPPANTHIGH _goes by the window with a mournful face._ ERMYNTRUDE _runs to the window and watches him till he is out of sight. She quietly waves her hand to_ HIPPANTHIGH, _unseen by her father._  SLADDER: O, he meant it all right. He meant it. I'm sorry for that bishop of his that he quarrels with, if he lets him have it the way he went for your poor old father. O, dear me; dear me.  ERMYNTRUDE: I don't think he quarrels with him, father. I think he only insists that there can be no such thing as eternal punishment. I think that's rather nice of him.  SLADDER: I don't care a damn about eternal punishment one way or the other. But a man who quarrels with the head of his firm's a fool. If his bishop's keen on hell, he should push hell for all it's worth.  ERMYNTRUDE: Y-e-s, I suppose he should. But, father, aren't you glad that my mice have eaten the new cheese? I thought you'd be glad, father.  SLADDER: So I am, child. So I am. Only I don't feel quite so glad as I thought I was going to, now. I don't know why. He seems to have stroked me the wrong way somehow.  ERMYNTRUDE: You said you'd give me whatever I liked.  SLADDER: And so I will, child. So I will. A motor if you like, with chauffeur and footman complete. We can buy anything now, and I wouldn't grudge----  ERMYNTRUDE: I don't want a motor, father.  SLADDER: What would you like to have?  ERMYNTRUDE: O, nothing, father, nothing. Only about that duke, father----  SLADDER: What duke, Ermyntrude?  ERMYNTRUDE: Mother said you wanted me to marry a duke some day, father.  SLADDER: Well?  ERMYNTRUDE: Well I--er--I don't think I quite want to, father.  SLADDER: Ah! Quite so. Quite so. Quite so. And who _did_ you think of marrying?  ERMYNTRUDE: O, father.  SLADDER: Well? (ERMYNTRUDE _is silent._) When I was his age, I had to work hard for my living.  ERMYNTRUDE: O, father. How do you know what age he is?  SLADDER: O, I guessed he was 82, going to be 83 next birthday. But I daresay I know nothing of the world. I daresay I may have been wrong.  ERMYNTRUDE: O, father, he's young.  SLADDER: Dear me, you don't say so. Dear me, you do surprise me. Well, well, well, well. We do live and learn. Don't we? And what might his name be now?  ERMYNTRUDE: It's Mr. Hippanthigh, father.  SLADDER: O-o-o! It's Mr. Hippanthigh, is it? O-ho, O-ho! (_He touches a movable bell, shouting_ \"SPLURGE!\" _To his daughter or rather to himself._) We'll see Mr. Hippanthigh.  ERMYNTRUDE: What are you going to do, father?  SLADDER: We'll see Mr. Hippanthigh. (_Enter_ SPLURGE.) Splurge, run after Mr. Hippanthigh and bring him back. Say I've got something to say to him. He's gone that way. Quick!  SPLURGE: Yes, sir. [_Exit._  SLADDER: I've got something to say to _him_ this time.  ERMYNTRUDE: Father! What are you going to do?  SLADDER: I'm going to give him What For.  ERMYNTRUDE: But why, father?  SLADDER: Because he's been giving it to your poor old father.  ERMYNTRUDE: Father----  SLADDER: Well?  ERMYNTRUDE: Be kind to him, father.  SLADDER: O, _I'll_ be kind to him. I'll be _kind_ to him. Just you wait. I'll be _kind_ to him!  ERMYNTRUDE: But you wouldn't send him away, father. Father, for my sake you wouldn't do that?  SLADDER: O, we haven't _come_ to that yet.  ERMYNTRUDE: But, but--you've sent for him.  SLADDER: O, I've sent for him to give him What For. We'll come to the rest later.  ERMYNTRUDE: But, when you do come to it, father.  SLADDER: Why, when we do come to it, if the young man's any good, I'll not stand in my daughter's way----  ERMYNTRUDE: O, thank you, father.  SLADDER: And if he's no good (_firmly_) I'll protect my child from him.  ERMYNTRUDE: But, father, I don't want to be protected.  SLADDER: If a man's a man, he must be some good at something. Well, this man's chosen the clergyman job. I've nothing against the job, it's well enough paid at the top, but is this young man ever going to get there? Is he ever going to get off the bottom rung? How long has he been a curate?  ERMYNTRUDE: Eight years, father.  SLADDER: It's a long time.  ERMYNTRUDE: But, father, he would get a vicarage if it wasn't for the bishop. The bishop stands in his way. It isn't nice of him.  SLADDER: If I'd quarrelled with the head of my firm when I was his age, you wouldn't be getting proposals from a curate; no such luck. The dustman would have been more in your line.  ERMYNTRUDE: But, father, he doesn't quarrel with the bishop. His conscience doesn't let him believe in eternal punishment, and so he speaks straight out. I do admire him so for it. He knows that if he was silent he'd have had a good living long ago.  SLADDER: The wife of the head of my firm believed in spirit rapping. Did I go and tell her what an old fool she was? No, I brought her messages from another world as regular as a postman.  [_Steps are heard outside the window._  SLADDER: Run along, my dear, now.  ERMYNTRUDE: Very well, father.  SLADDER: The man that's going to look after my daughter must be able to look after himself. Otherwise _I_ will, till a better man comes.  [_Exit_ ERMYNTRUDE. HIPPANTHIGH _and_ SPLURGE _appear at the window._ HIPPANTHIGH _enters and_ SPLURGE _moves away._  HIPPANTHIGH: You sent for me, Mr. Sladder?  SLADDER: Y-e-s--y-e-s. Take a chair. Now, Mr. Hippanthigh, I haven't often been told off the way you told me "]]]
