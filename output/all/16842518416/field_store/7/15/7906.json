First he enters the hall of the novel-writers, a vast apartment crowned with an enormous transparent cupola. In one corner is a telephone, through which a hundred Earth Chronicle _litt√©rateurs_ in turn recount to the public in daily installments a hundred novels. Addressing one of these authors who was waiting his turn, \"Capital! Capital! my dear fellow,\" said he, \"your last story. The scene where the village maid discusses interesting philosophical problems with her lover shows your very acute power of observation. Never have the ways of country folk been better portrayed. Keep on, my dear Archibald, keep on! Since yesterday, thanks to you, there is a gain of 5000 subscribers.\"  \"Mr. John Last,\" he began again, turning to a new arrival, \"I am not so well pleased with your work. Your story is not a picture of life; it lacks the elements of truth. And why? Simply because you run straight on to the end; because you do not analyze. Your heroes do this thing or that from this or that motive, which you assign without ever a thought of dissecting their mental and moral natures. Our feelings, you must remember, are far more complex than all that. In real life every act is the resultant of a hundred thoughts that come and go, and these you must study, each by itself, if you would create a living character. 'But,' you will say, 'in order to note these fleeting thoughts one must know them, must be able to follow them in their capricious meanderings.' Why, any child can do that, as you know. You have simply to make use of hypnotism, electrical or human, which gives one a two-fold being, setting free the witness-personality so that it may see, understand, and remember the reasons which determine the personality that acts. Just study yourself as you live from day to day, my dear Last. Imitate your associate whom I was complimenting a moment ago. Let yourself be hypnotized. What's that? You have tried it already? Not sufficiently, then, not sufficiently!\"  Mr. Smith continues his round and enters the reporters' hall. Here 1500 reporters, in their respective places, facing an equal number of telephones, are communicating to the subscribers the news of the world as gathered during the night. The organization of this matchless service has often been described. Besides his telephone, each reporter, as the reader is aware, has in front of him a set of commutators, which enable him to communicate with any desired telephotic line. Thus the subscribers not only hear the news but see the occurrences. When an incident is described that is already past, photographs of its main features are transmitted with the narrative. And there is no confusion withal. The reporters' items, just like the different stories and all the other component parts of the journal, are classified automatically according to an ingenious system, and reach the hearer in due succession. Furthermore, the hearers are free to listen only to what specially concerns them. They may at pleasure give attention to one editor and refuse it to another.  Mr. Smith next addresses one of the ten reporters in the astronomical department--a department still in the embryonic stage, but which will yet play an important part in journalism.  \"Well, Cash, what's the news?\"  \"We have phototelegrams from Mercury, Venus, and Mars.\"  \"Are those from Mars of any interest?\"  \"Yes, indeed. There is a revolution in the Central Empire.\"  \"And what of Jupiter?\" asked Mr. Smith.  \"Nothing as yet. We cannot quite understand their signals. Perhaps ours do not reach them.\"  \"That's bad,\" exclaimed Mr. Smith, as he hurried away, not in the best of humor, toward the hall of the scientific editors. With their heads bent down over their electric computers, thirty scientific men were absorbed in transcendental calculations. The coming of Mr. Smith was like the falling of a bomb among them.  \"Well, gentlemen, what is this I hear? No answer from Jupiter? Is it always to be thus? Come, Cooley, you have been at work now twenty years on this problem, and yet--\"  \"True enough,\" replied the man addressed. \"Our science of optics is still very defective, and through our mile-and-three-quarter telescopes--\"  \"Listen to that, Peer,\" broke in Mr. Smith, turning to a second scientist. \"Optical science defective! Optical science is your specialty. But,\" he continued, again addressing William Cooley, \"failing with Jupiter, are we getting any results from the moon?\"  \"The case is no better there.\"  \"This time you do not lay the blame on the science of optics. The moon is immeasurably less distant than Mars, yet with Mars our communication is fully established. I presume you will not say that you lack telescopes?\"  \"Telescopes? O no, the trouble here is about--inhabitants!\"  \"That's it,\" added Peer.  \"So, then, the moon is positively uninhabited?\" asked Mr. Smith.  \"At least,\" answered Cooley, \"on the face which she presents to us. As for the opposite side, who knows?\"  \"Ah, the opposite side! You think, then,\" remarked Mr. Smith, musingly, \"that if one could but--\"  \"Could what?\"  \"Why, turn the moon about-face.\"  \"Ah, there's something in that,\" cried the two men at once. And indeed, so confident was their air, they seemed to have no doubt as to the possibility of success in such an undertaking.  \"Meanwhile,\" asked Mr. Smith, after a moment's silence, \"have you no news of interest to-day?\"  \"Indeed we have,\" answered Cooley. \"The elements of Olympus are definitively settled. That great planet gravitates beyond Neptune at the mean distance of 11,400,799,642 miles from the sun, and to traverse its vast orbit takes 1311 years, 294 days, 12 hours, 43 minutes, 9 seconds.\"  \"Why didn't you tell me that sooner?\" cried Mr. Smith. \"Now inform the reporters of this straightway. You know how eager is the curiosity of the public with regard to these astronomical questions. That news must go into to-day's issue.\"  Then, the two men bowing to him, Mr. Smith passed into the next hall, an enormous gallery upward of 3200 feet in length, devoted to atmospheric advertising. Every one has noticed those enormous advertisements reflected from the clouds, so large that they may be seen by the populations of whole cities or even of entire countries. This, too, is one of Mr. Fritz Napoleon Smith's ideas, and in the Earth Chronicle building a thousand projectors are constantly engaged in displaying upon the clouds these mammoth advertisements.  When Mr. Smith to-day entered the sky-advertising department, he found the operators sitting with folded arms at their motionless projectors, and inquired as to the cause of their inaction. In response, the man addressed simply pointed to the sky, which was of a pure blue. \"Yes,\" muttered Mr. Smith, \"a cloudless sky! That's too bad, but what's to be done? Shall we produce rain? That we might do, but is it of any use? What we need is clouds, not rain. Go,\" said he, addressing the head engineer, \"go see Mr. Samuel Mark, of the meteorological division of the scientific department, and tell him for me to go to work in earnest on the question of artificial clouds. It will never do for us to be always thus at the mercy of cloudless skies!\"  Mr. Smith's daily tour through the several departments of his newspaper is now finished. Next, from the advertisement hall he passes to the reception chamber, where the ambassadors accredited to the American government are awaiting him, desirous of having a word of counsel or advice from the all-powerful editor. A discussion was going on when he entered. \"Your Excellency will pardon me,\" the French Ambassador was saying to the Russian, \"but I see nothing in the map of Europe that requires change. 'The North for the Slavs?' Why, yes, of course; but the South for the Latins. Our common frontier, the Rhine, it seems to me, serves very well. Besides, my government, as you must know, will firmly oppose every movement, not only against Paris, our capital, or our two great prefectures, Rome and Madrid, but also against the kingdom of Jerusalem, the dominion of Saint Peter, of which France means to be the trusty defender.\"  \"Well said!\" exclaimed Mr. Smith. \"How is it,\" he asked, turning to the Russian ambassador, \"that you Russians are not content with your vast empire, the most extensive in the world, stretching from the banks of the Rhine to the Celestial Mountains and the Kara-Korum, whose shores are washed by the Frozen Ocean, the Atlantic, the Mediterranean, and the Indian Ocean? Then, what is the use of threats? Is war possible in view of modern inventions--asphyxiating shells capable of being projected a distance of 60 miles, an electric spark of 90 miles, that can at one stroke annihilate a battalion; to say nothing of the plague, the cholera, the yellow fever, that the belligerents might spread among their antagonists mutually, and which would in a few days destroy the greatest armies?\"  \"True,\" answered the Russian; \"but can we do all that we wish? As for us Russians, pressed on our eastern frontier by the Chinese, we must at any cost put forth our strength for an effort toward the west.\"  \"O, is that all? In that case,\" said Mr. Smith, \"the thing can be arranged. I will speak to the Secretary of State about it. The attention of the Chinese government shall be called to the matter. This is not the first time that the Chinese have bothered us.\"  \"Under these conditions, of course--\" And the Russian ambassador declared himself satisfied.  \"Ah, Sir John, what can I do for you?\" asked Mr. Smith as he turned to the representative of the people of Great Britain, who till now had remained silent.  \"A great deal,\" was the reply. \"If the Earth Chronicle would but open a campaign on our behalf--\"  \"And for what object?\"  \"Simply for the annulment of the Act of Congress annexing to the United States the British islands.\"  Though, by a just turn-about of things here below, Great Britain has become a colony of the United States, the English"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19362"],["title","In the Year 2889 (#2)"],["body","not yet reconciled to the situation. At regular intervals they are ever addressing to the American government vain complaints.  \"A campaign against the annexation that has been an accomplished fact for 150 years!\" exclaimed Mr. Smith. \"How can your people suppose that I would do anything so unpatriotic?\"  \"We at home think that your people must now be sated. The Monroe doctrine is fully applied; the whole of America belongs to the Americans. What more do you want? Besides, we will pay for what we ask.\"  \"Indeed!\" answered Mr. Smith, without manifesting the slightest irritation. \"Well, you English will ever be the same. No, no, Sir John, do not count on me for help. Give up our fairest province, Britain? Why not ask France generously to renounce possession of Africa, that magnificent colony the complete conquest of which cost her the labor of 800 years? You will be well received!\"  \"You decline! All is over then!\" murmured the British agent sadly. \"The United Kingdom falls to the share of the Americans; the Indies to that of--\"  \"The Russians,\" said Mr. Smith, completing the sentence.  \"Australia--\"  \"Has an independent government.\"  \"Then nothing at all remains for us!\" sighed Sir John, downcast.  \"Nothing?\" asked Mr. Smith, laughing. \"Well, now, there's Gibraltar!\"  With this sally the audience ended. The clock was striking twelve, the hour of breakfast. Mr. Smith returns to his chamber. Where the bed stood in the morning a table all spread comes up through the floor. For Mr. Smith, being above all a practical man, has reduced the problem of existence to its simplest terms. For him, instead of the endless suites of apartments of the olden time, one room fitted with ingenious mechanical contrivances is enough. Here he sleeps, takes his meals, in short, lives.  He seats himself. In the mirror of the phonotelephote is seen the same chamber at Paris which appeared in it this morning. A table furnished forth is likewise in readiness here, for notwithstanding the difference of hours, Mr. Smith and his wife have arranged to take their meals simultaneously. It is delightful thus to take breakfast _tƒôte-≈ï-tƒôte_ with one who is 3000 miles or so away. Just now, Mrs. Smith's chamber has no occupant.  \"She is late! Woman's punctuality! Progress everywhere except there!\" muttered Mr. Smith as he turned the tap for the first dish. For like all wealthy folk in our day, Mr. Smith has done away with the domestic kitchen and is a subscriber to the Grand Alimentation Company, which sends through a great network of tubes to subscribers' residences all sorts of dishes, as a varied assortment is always in readiness. A subscription costs money, to be sure, but the _cuisine_ is of the best, and the system has this advantage, that it does away with the pestering race of the _cordons-bleus_. Mr. Smith received and ate, all alone, the _hors-d'oeuvre_, _entr√©es_, _r√¥ti_, and _legumes_ that constituted the repast. He was just finishing the dessert when Mrs. Smith appeared in the mirror of the telephote.  \"Why, where have you been?\" asked Mr. Smith through the telephone.  \"What! You are already at the dessert? Then I am late,\" she exclaimed, with a winsome _naƒèvet√©_. \"Where have I been, you ask? Why, at my dress-maker's. The hats are just lovely this season! I suppose I forgot to note the time, and so am a little late.\"  \"Yes, a little,\" growled Mr. Smith; \"so little that I have already quite finished breakfast. Excuse me if I leave you now, but I must be going.\"  \"O certainly, my dear; good-by till evening.\"  Smith stepped into his air-coach, which was in waiting for him at a window. \"Where do you wish to go, sir?\" inquired the coachman.  \"Let me see; I have three hours,\" Mr. Smith mused. \"Jack, take me to my accumulator works at Niagara.\"  For Mr. Smith has obtained a lease of the great falls of Niagara. For ages the energy developed by the falls went unutilized. Smith, applying Jackson's invention, now collects this energy, and lets or sells it. His visit to the works took more time than he had anticipated. It was four o'clock when he returned home, just in time for the daily audience which he grants to callers.  One readily understands how a man situated as Smith is must be beset with requests of all kinds. Now it is an inventor needing capital; again it is some visionary who comes to advocate a brilliant scheme which must surely yield millions of profit. A choice has to be made between these projects, rejecting the worthless, examining the questionable ones, accepting the meritorious. To this work Mr. Smith devotes every day two full hours.  The callers were fewer to-day than usual--only twelve of them. Of these, eight had only impracticable schemes to propose. In fact, one of them wanted to revive painting, an art fallen into desuetude owing to the progress made in color-photography. Another, a physician, boasted that he had discovered a cure for nasal catarrh! These impracticables were dismissed in short order. Of the four projects favorably received, the first was that of a young man whose broad forehead betokened his intellectual power.  \"Sir, I am a chemist,\" he began, \"and as such I come to you.\"  \"Well!\"  \"Once the elementary bodies,\" said the young chemist, \"were held to be sixty-two in number; a hundred years ago they were reduced to ten; now only three remain irresolvable, as you are aware.\"  \"Yes, yes.\"  \"Well, sir, these also I will show to be composite. In a few months, a few weeks, I shall have succeeded in solving the problem. Indeed, it may take only a few days.\"  \"And then?\"  \"Then, sir, I shall simply have determined the absolute. All I want is money enough to carry my research to a successful issue.\"  \"Very well,\" said Mr. Smith. \"And what will be the practical outcome of your discovery?\"  \"The practical outcome? Why, that we shall be able to produce easily all bodies whatever--stone, wood, metal, fibers--\"  \"And flesh and blood?\" queried Mr. Smith, interrupting him. \"Do you pretend that you expect to manufacture a human being out and out?\"  \"Why not?\"  Mr. Smith advanced $100,000 to the young chemist, and engaged his services for the Earth Chronicle laboratory.  The second of the four successful applicants, starting from experiments made so long ago as the nineteenth century and again and again repeated, had conceived the idea of removing an entire city all at once from one place to another. His special project had to do with the city of Granton, situated, as everybody knows, some fifteen miles inland. He proposes to transport the city on rails and to change it into a watering-place. The profit, of course, would be enormous. Mr. Smith, captivated by the scheme, bought a half-interest in it.  \"As you are aware, sir,\" began applicant No. 3, \"by the aid of our solar and terrestrial accumulators and transformers, we are able to make all the seasons the same. I propose to do something better still. Transform into heat a portion of the surplus energy at our disposal; send this heat to the poles; then the polar regions, relieved of their snow-cap, will become a vast territory available for man's use. What think you of the scheme?\"  \"Leave your plans with me, and come back in a week. I will have them examined in the meantime.\"  Finally, the fourth announced the early solution of a weighty scientific problem. Every one will remember the bold experiment made a hundred years ago by Dr. Nathaniel Faithburn. The doctor, being a firm believer in human hibernation--in other words, in the possibility of our suspending our vital functions and of calling them into action again after a time--resolved to subject the theory to a practical test. To this end, having first made his last will and pointed out the proper method of awakening him; having also directed that his sleep was to continue a hundred years to a day from the date of his apparent death, he unhesitatingly put the theory to the proof in his own person. Reduced to the condition of a mummy, Dr. Faithburn was coffined and laid in a tomb. Time went on. September 25th, 2889, being the day set for his resurrection, it was proposed to Mr. Smith that he should permit the second part of the experiment to be performed at his residence this evening.  \"Agreed. Be here at ten o'clock,\" answered Mr. Smith; and with that the day's audience was closed.  Left to himself, feeling tired, he lay down on an extension chair. Then, touching a knob, he established communication with the Central Concert Hall, whence our greatest _maestros_ send out to subscribers their delightful successions of accords determined by recondite algebraic formulas. Night was approaching. Entranced by the harmony, forgetful of the hour, Smith did not notice that it was growing dark. It was quite dark when he was aroused by the sound of a door opening. \"Who is there?\" he asked, touching a commutator.  Suddenly, in consequence of the vibrations produced, the air became luminous.  \"Ah! you, Doctor?\"  \"Yes,\" was the reply. \"How are you?\"  \"I am feeling well.\"  \"Good! Let me see your tongue. All right! Your pulse. Regular! And your appetite?\"  \"Only passably good.\"  \"Yes, the stomach. There's the rub. You are over-worked. If your stomach is out of repair, it must be mended. That requires study. We must think about it.\"  \"In the meantime,\" said Mr. Smith, \"you will dine with me.\"  As in the morning, the table rose out of the floor. Again, as in the morning, the _potage_, _r√¥ti_, _rago≈±ts_, and _legumes_ were supplied through the food-pipes. Toward the close of the meal, phonotelephotic communication was made with Paris. Smith saw his wife, seated alone at the dinner-table, looking anything but pleased at her loneliness.  \"Pardon me, my dear, for having left you alone,\" he said through the telephone. \"I was with Dr. Wilkins.\"  \"Ah, the good doctor!\" remarked Mrs. Smith, her countenance lighting up.  \"Yes. But, pray, when are you coming home?\"  \"This evening.\"  \"Very well. Do you come by tube or by air-train?\"  \"Oh, by"]]]
