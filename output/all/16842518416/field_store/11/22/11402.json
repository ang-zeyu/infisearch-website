Sissy was watching for him from behind a tree across the street, and she came toward him running.  \"Maggie's in de alley, sir, yonder by de lamp, layin' dere an' moanin', an' I t'ink dey's sumpin' wrong wid her,\" said Sissy.  She led him to the spot beyond which they had not been able to escape, where Maggie was lying with the light from the street lamp shining full in her face. Her dress was torn at the neck, for she had not been costumed as the others were, and the cold, wintry night-air was blowing on her bare throat and breast. Her big eyes had lost their dimness, and were blazing with a fire kindled by a wild imagination. Mr. Dootleby took off his hat and knelt upon the alley stones, and threw his arms around her shoulders, supporting her. She looked through him at some one not present but beyond.  \"I didn't do it, Swiggsy, an' he couldn't 'a' made me if he'd burned my eyes out like he said he was goin' to!\" she whispered faintly. \"But he used me rough, Swiggsy, an' I'm--just--a little--bit--tired.\"  \"Good God in Heaven!\" murmured Mr. Dootleby, \"look upon this wavering soul in Thy full compassion. She is tired, so very, very tired.\"  \"And, Swiggsy, let's go somewheres where he can't fin' me, cause I'm fearful of him. An' you'll get steady work, Swiggsy, tendin' bar, an' then--\"  She closed her eyes, and for several moments lay silent and still.  \"Swiggsy--\"  The sound was faint now, and Mr. Dootleby bent low to catch it.  \"I suspicion something ails me in my side, an' I'm falling, falling, falling---- Ketch me, Swiggsy, hold me--I'm honest wid you, don't you know it. Tell me so, and say it loud, so's I can hear. I'll be good to you when I get--rested.\"  [Illustration: STARS OF THE NIGHT, ARE YOU WATCHING HERE?]  The street is empty. Not a sound is heard. Not a footfall. Not a voice. The world is sleeping, dreaming of its own ambitions. Stars of the night, are you watching here?  \"You said you t'ought I was pretty, Swiggsy, an' it made me so glad an' happy, 'cause I wants you to think I'm pretty--ah! where are you going! Come back! come back! come back! Don't leave me all alone, please, please don't, for I'm falling again, fast, faster all the time, an' I'll soon fall--\"  She opened her eyes wide--wider than ever. She looked into Mr. Dootleby's face and smiled. She lifted her hand and dropped it heavily into his. Her head dropped on his shoulder. She had fallen--out of human sight!     V.  THE HON. DOYLE O'MEAGHER.   At this particular moment the Hon. Doyle O'Meagher is a busy man. Tammany Hall's nominating convention is shortly to be held, and Mr. O'Meagher is putting the finishing touches upon the ticket which he has decided that the convention shall adopt. The ticket, written down upon a sheet of paper, is before him, together with a bottle of whisky and a case of cigars, and the finishing touches consist of little pencil-marks placed opposite the candidates' names, indicating that they have visited Mr. O'Meagher and have duly paid over their several campaign assessments--a preliminary formality which Mr. O'Meagher enforces with strict impartiality. The amount of each assessment depends entirely upon Mr. O'Meagher's sense of the fitness of things. To dispute Mr. O'Meagher's sense in this particular is looked upon as treason and rebellion. In the case of the Hon. Thraxton Wimples, the intended candidate for the Supreme Court, the assessment is $20,000.  Mr. Wimples is a little man of profound learning and ancient lineage. Mr. O'Meagher is a man of indifferent learning and no lineage to speak of. Mr. Wimples's grandfather had signed the Declaration of Independence, and had moved on three separate occasions that the Continental Congress do now adjourn, while no reason whatever existed, other than the one most obvious but least apt to occur to any one, for supposing that Mr. O'Meagher had ever had a grandfather at all. And yet, as Mr. Wimples, though on the threshold of great dignity and power, walks into Mr. O'Meagher's presence, he find himself all of a tremble, and glows and chills chase each other up and down his spinal column.  \"Ah, Mr. O'Meagher,\" he says, \"good-morning! Good-morning! Happy to see you so--er--well. Charming day, so warm for the--er--season.\"  \"Yes,\" says Mr. O'Meagher, \"so it be.\"  \"I received your notification of the high--er--honor, you propose to confer on me.\"  \"Yes,\" says Mr. O'Meagher, \"you're the man for the place.\"  \"So kind of you to--er--say so. You mentioned that the--er--assessment was--\"  \"Twenty thousand dollars,\" says Mr. O'Meagher, with great promptness.  [Illustration: \"JUST SO,\" SAYS MR. WIMPLES, \"JUST SO.\"]  \"Just so,\" says Mr. Wimples, \"just so.\"  \"And you've called to pay it,\" says Mr. O'Meagher, taking up his list and his pencil. \"I've been expecting you.\"  \"Ah, yes, to be sure, of course. I was going to propose a--er--settlement.\"  \"A what?\" says Mr. O'Meagher sharply.  Mr. Wimples mops his brow. \"The fact is,\" he says, \"I don't happen to have so considerable a sum as $20,000 at the--er--moment, and I was thinking of suggesting that I just pay you, say, $10,000 down, and give you two--er--notes.\"  \"'Twont do,\" says Mr. O'Meagher, shaking his head and fetching his pencil down upon the table with a smart tap, \"'twont do at all.\"  \"Eh? Indorsed, you know, by--\"  \"Mr. Wimples, that $20,000 in hard cash must be in my hands by six o'clock to-night, or your name goes off the ticket.\"  \"O--er--Lud!\" says Mr. Wimples, sadly.  \"By six P. M.\"  \"But, my dear Mr. O'Meagher--\"  \"Or your name goes off the ticket.\"  Mr. Wimples groaned, grasped the whisky bottle, poured out a copious draught, tossed it down his throat, bowed meekly, and withdrew. In the vestibule he met the Hon. Perfidius Ruse, the Mayor of the city, whose term of office was about to expire, and as to whose renomination there was going on a heated controversy. Mr. Ruse was a reformer. It was as a reformer that he had been elected two years before. At that time Mr. O'Meagher found himself menaced by a strange peril. It had been alleged by jealous enemies that he was corrupt, and they called loudly for reform. At first, Mr. O'Meagher experienced some difficulty in understanding what was meant by corrupt and what by reform. His mission in life, as he understood it, was to name the individuals who should hold the city's offices and to control their official acts in the interest of Tammany Hall, and he had great difficulty in comprehending how it could be anybody's business that he had grown rich performing his mission. But perceiving that a large and dangerous class of voters was clamoring for a reformer, he concluded to humor it if he could find a good safe reformer on whom he could rely. In this emergency he had produced the Hon. Perfidius Ruse.  It cannot be said that Mr. O'Meagher regarded the Ruse experiment as entirely satisfactory. Mr. Ruse had certainly reformed several things, and with considerable adroitness and skill, but there were many who said that his reforms had all been made with an eye single to the glory of the Hon. Perfidius Ruse, and with a view to the establishment of a personal influence hostile to the man who made him. The time had now come for the test of strength. Concerning his ultimate intentions, the Hon. Doyle O'Meagher was cold, silent, and reserved.  \"How are you, Mr. Mayor?\" said the crestfallen Mr. Wimples, as he came upon the reformer in the vestibule. \"Going up to see the--er--Boss?\"  \"I was thinking of it, yes. How's he feeling?\"  \"Ugly. He's in a dev'lish uncompromising--er--humor. If you were going to ask anything of him I advise you to--er, not.\"  \"Thank you. I only intend to suggest some matters in the interest of reform.\"  \"I wish you well. But--er--go slow.\"  Mr. O'Meagher did not rise to greet his distinguished visitor. He simply drew a chair close to his own, poured out a glass of whisky, and said, \"Hello!\"  \"I thought I'd just drop in, Mr. O'Meagher,\" said the Mayor, \"to say a word or two about the situation. What are the probabilities?\"  \"As regards which?\"  \"H'm, well, the nominations?\"  [Illustration: \"WHO CAN TELL?\" EJACULATED MR. O'MEAGHER.]  \"Who can tell,\" ejaculated Mr. O'Meagher. \"Who can tell? What is more uncertain, Mr. Ruse, than the action of a nominating convention?\"  \"To be sure,\" responded Mr. Ruse. \"What, indeed?\" Whereupon each statesman looked at the other out of the corners of his eyes.  \"There's only one thing I care about,\" continued Mr. Ruse, \"and that is reform. If my successor is a reformer, I shall be satisfied.\"  \"Make yourself easy,\" replied Mr. O'Meagher. \"He'll be a reformer. I've been paying some attention during the last two years to the education of our people in the matter of reform. My success has been flattering. I think I can truthfully say now that Tammany Hall has a reformer ready for every salary paid by the city, and that there's no danger of our stock of reformers giving out as long as the salaries last.\"  Mr. Ruse hesitated a moment, as if reflecting how he should take these observations. Finally he laughed in a feeble way and said, \"Good, yes, very.\" Then he added, \"But, speaking seriously, I do feel that my duty to the public requires me to exert all the influence I have for the protection of reform.\"  \"I feel the same way,\" said Mr. O'Meagher, \"exactly the same way. I'm just boiling over with enthusiasm for reform.\"  \"Then our sympathies and desires are common. Now, if I could feel sure that I ought to run again in the interest of reform--\"  \"You've done so much already,\" Mr. O'Meagher hastily put in, \"you've sacrificed so heavily that I don't think it would be fair to ask it of you.\"  \"N-no,\" said the Mayor, dubiously, \"I suppose it wouldn't, now, would it?\"  \"Of course not.\"  \"And yet I don't like to run away from the call, so to speak, of duty.\"  \"Don't be worried about that.\"  \"But I am worried, O'Meagher.

Professor of Entomology in Rutgers College, &c.  PUBLISHED BY THE BROOKLYN ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY BROOKLYN, N. Y. 1906  PRESS OF THE NEW ERA PRINTING COMPANY LANCASTER, PA.  {Scanner's note: This book is about a century old at the time of scanning.  I found it in the discard pile of a local university library.  I find the book to be of exceptional historical interest in the insights it gives into the development of early modern entomological science.  It also is of practical value as a source for terms that are obscure to modern users because they are no longer current.  I have edited the text as well as I could and I think it is by now very usable, but do treat any really suspicious looking passages with reserve.  I have avoided the use of non-alphabetic symbols as far as I could, for example Greek letters and male, female and hermaphroditic symbols, but if you encounter difficulties you might find the problem there.  Also, the colour table at the end is not really much good for anything beyond general impressions; not only are the paper and ink old, but between my scanner and your screen or printer, there is room for too much misinterpretation of precise colour, for anyone to take it seriously.  In any case, enjoy.  The book is a valuable product of serious workers in an age of exploration.}    FOREWORD.  When, some time since, in consequence of continuing demands, the Brooklyn Entomological Society resolved to publish a new edition of its Explanation of Terms used in Entomology, and entrusted the writer and two associates with the task of preparing the same, it was believed that a little revision of definitions, the dropping of a few obsolete terms and the addition of a few lately proposed, would be all that was necessary. It was to be a light task to fill idle time in summer, report to be made in fall. Two years have passed since that time; the associates have dropped by the way; the manuscript contains five times the number of terms in the original \"Explanation.\" and if it is published now, it is not because I believe it to be complete; but because I do not believe it can be made complete except as the result of criticism and voluntary addition by specialists throughout the country.  It is twenty-six years since the original list was published and nothing can better illustrate the advances made than a comparison between the old and the new Glossary. No one realizes better than I the fact that as students have increased in each order, each has followed an independent line of research, absolutely without regard to the work done elsewhere. In consequence, we have several terms for the same thing in many cases and, in an equal number, several meanings to the same term. As no one man can now-a-days cover the entire field of Entomology, it goes without saying that I was compelled to rely partly upon books and partly upon the good nature of correspondents to make the work even approximately complete.  The first notable contribution came from Professor Justus W. Folsom, of Urbana, Illinois, who sent me over 2000 cards of terms collected by himself and his assistants, and these added materially at the beginning of the work.  A number of correspondents were good enough to send in lists of terms in Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Orthoptera, Hemiptera and Neuroptera, and to refer me to literature where explanations of other special terms could be found.  After the cards were so far advanced as to warrant a preliminary manuscript, Dr. Philip P. Calvert of the University of Pennsylvania. Mr. Nathan Banks of Washington, D.C., and Mr. C. W. Johnson of the Boston Society of Natural History went carefully over the entire work and by their criticisms and additions contributed materially to such merit as it possesses. To these gentlemen and to the many others not specifically mentioned I give thanks for their assistance, and if there have not been more co-workers it has been only because of the time element that seems to demand the best that is ready, rather than a delay to secure perfection.  It would be interesting to go at length into the history of the correspondence to determine what sort of terms should or should not be included and to bring out the hopeless divergencies existing; but all that is important here is to state briefly what has been included and what omitted.  Common English terms even if descriptive, when used in their ordinary dictionary sense, have not been included as a rule; but this is subject to many exceptions. Latin terms and derivatives, even if used in their usual sense have been generally included; but compounds made up of adequately defined descriptive terms are generally omitted. Adverbial or adjective forms have been omitted whenever it has been considered safe, and so have terms prefixed by sub-, supra- and the like, indicating degree or position. In doubtful cases the terms have been included and defined. All terms of venation are, so far as possible, reduced to the Comstock system which is the only one that has been satisfactorily worked out for all orders, and a series of figures is added to explain this system so far as seems necessary. It has not been considered feasible to determine the proper use of terms applied differently in different orders or families; that is scarcely within the scope of a work of this kind.  Terms used in embryological and histological study have been included only so far as seemed necessary to an understanding of the general works, and no attempt has been made to cover the terms applied to musculature and other details of microscopic structure: this has seemed rather to be outside of the scope of the present essay.  All color terms are reduced so far as possible to terms of the Windsor and Newton system of water colors which are standard in the English-speaking world, and the color plate shows solid blocks of those colors that seem necessary to explain all modifications except metallics, blacks and whites. {Scanner's note: color plate may be excluded, partly because it is in poor condition.}  The figures illustrating body structures and other details have been drawn under my supervision by Mr. John A. Grossbeck, and are meant to be guides merely - else the glossary would exceed its scope.  In the admission that the work is incomplete, no apology is intended for its publication; it is merely a statement of fact to encourage constructive rather than destructive criticism. It is hoped that those who note errors or omissions will communicate them to the writer so that when another edition is needed, as it will be before many years are past, a standard work may be possible.    JOHN B. SMITH, Sc.D.  New Brunswick,  N.J.  April 1906     EXPLANATORY.  Definitions of general application are as a rule given first, where more than one is necessary; next those of limited use, and finally the specific meaning in each order in which there is any notable difference.  Where a word has more than one ending, the difference is given after a hyphen which represents the stem word: e.g. ametabola -ous; the latter in place of ametabolous, which indicates the possession of the characters peculiar to the ametabola. Where there is an English and a Latin ending, the former is usually given with the word and the other is added: e.g. aequilate -us, instead of aequilatus, there being no difference in the application. Usually the singular form of the word is first given, and the plural ending is added; e.g.       antenna -ae,       cenchrus -ri,       desideratum -ata;  but occasionally, when the plural is more commonly used, e.g. epimera -eron, this is reversed and the singular ending is added: when the two are different in form, e.g. foot and feet, the words are given separately, and so when there is a difference in the application, as in       uncus and unci.  In the definition of color terms the words in brackets [ ] refer to the equivalent color as named on the plate, or the combination needed to produce it.  The names in parentheses ( ) are those of the writers whose definitions are used, or who have used the term in the sense defined. In the terms of venation, these parentheses occur most frequently.  Most of the signs and abbreviations are those in common use       :=     equal to, or the same as;       q.v.   which see;       pl.    plural;       abb.   abbreviated.  The abbreviated names are: Comst. for Comstock; Coq. for Coquillett; Meig. for Meigen; Nort. for Norton: O. S. for Osten-Sacken: and Will. for Williston.   A  A: prefix, is privative; wanting or without.  Ab: off; away from.  Abbreviated: cut short; not of usual length.  Abdomen: the third or posterior division of the insect body: consists normally of nine or ten apparent segments, but actual number is a mooted question: bears no functional legs in the adult stage.  Abdominal: belonging or pertaining to the abdomen.  Abdominal feet: see pro-legs.  Abdominal groove: the concave lobe of the inner margin of secondaries enveloping the abdomen beneath, in some butterflies.  Abdominal pouch: in female Parnassiids, a sac-like ventral cavity, formed by material secreted during copulation.  Abductor: applied to muscles that open out or extend an appendage or draw it away from the body: see adductor.  Abductor mandibulae: the muscle that opens the mandibles.  Aberrant: unusual; out of the ordinary course.  Aberration: a form that departs in some striking way from the normal type; either single or occurring rarely, at irregular intervals.  Abiogenesis: spontaneous generation.  Abnormal: outside the usual range or course; not normal.  Aborted: a structure developed so as to be unfit for its normal function obsolete or atrophied.  Abraded: scraped or rubbed.  Abrupt: suddenly or without gradation.  Abscissus: cut off squarely, with a straight margin.  Absconditus: hidden, concealed; retracted into another.
