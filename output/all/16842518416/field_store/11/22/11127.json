I reckon dinner is about ready now.\"  Kit felt ready for the dinner, for the morning's ride had sharpened his appetite. So when, five minutes later, he was summoned to the table, he willingly accepted the invitation.  \"This is my new 'prentice, Mrs. Bickford,\" said the blacksmith, by way of introduction, to a spare, red headed woman, who was bustling about the kitchen, where the table was spread.  Mrs. Bickford eyed Kit critically.  \"He's one of the kid glove kind, by his looks,\" she said. \"You don't expect to get much work out of him, do you?\"  \"I reckon I will, or know the reason why,\" responded Bickford, significantly.  \"Set right down and I'll dish up the victuals,\" said Mrs. Bickford. \"We don't stand on no ceremony here. What's your name, young man?\"  \"People call me Kit.\"  \"Sounds like a young cat. It's rediculous to give a boy such a name. First thing you know I'll be calling you Kitty.\"  \"I hope I don't look like a cat,\" said Kit laughing.  \"You ain't got no fur on your cheeks yet,\" said the blacksmith, laughing heartily at his own witticism. \"What have you got for dinner, mother?\"  \"It's a sort of picked-up dinner,\" answered Mrs. Bickford. \"There's some pork and beans warmed up, some slapjacks from breakfast, and some fried sassidges.\"  \"Why, that's a dinner for a king,\" said the blacksmith, rubbing his hands.  He took his seat, and put on a plate for Kit specimens of the delicacies mentioned above. In spite of his appetite Kit partook sparingly, supplementing his meal with bread, which, being from the baker's shop, was of good quality. He congratulated himself that he was not to board permanently at Mr. Bickford's table.  When dinner was over, the blacksmith in a genial mood said to Kit: \"You needn't begin to work till to-morrow. You can tramp round the village if you want to.\"  Kit was glad of the delay, as early the next morning he expected to bid farewell to Oakford, and thus would avoid a conflict.  He had been in Oakford before, and knew his way about. He went out of the yard and walked about in a leisurely way. It was early in June, and the country was at its best. The birds were singing, the fields were green with verdure, and Kit's spirits rose. He felt that it would be delightful to travel about the country, as he would do if he joined Barlow's Circus.  He overtook a boy somewhat larger than himself, a stout, strong country boy, attired in a rough, coarse working suit. He was about to pass him, when the country boy called out, \"Hallo, you!\"  \"Were you speaking to me?\" asked Kit, turning and looking back.  \"Yes. Didn't I see you riding into town with Aaron Bickford?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Are you going to work for him?\"  \"That is what he expects,\" answered Kit diplomatically. He hesitated about confiding his plans to a stranger.  \"Then I pity you.\"  \"Why?\"  \"I used to work for him.\"  \"Did you?\"  \"Yes, I stood it as long as I could.\"  \"Then you didn't like it?\"  \"I guess not.\"  \"What was the trouble?\"  \"Everything. He's a stingy old hunks, to begin with. I went to work for a dollar a week and board. If the board had been decent, it would have been something, but I'd as soon board at the poorhouse.\"  \"I have taken dinner there,\" said Kit, smiling.  \"Did you like it?\"  \"I have dined better. In fact I have seldom dined worse.\"  \"What did the old woman give you?\"  Kit enumerated the articles composing the bill of fare.  \"That's better than usual,\" said the new acquaintance.  \"I suppose the dollar a week is all right,\" said Kit.  \"Good enough if you can get it. It's about as easy to get blood out of a stone, as money out of old Bickford. Generally I had to wait ten days after the time before I could get the money.\"  \"How is the work?\"  \"Hard, and plenty of it. It's work early and work late, and if there isn't work at the forge, you've got to help the old woman, by drawing water and doing chores. You don't live in Oakford, do you?\"  \"No; I came from Smyrna.\"  \"I thought not. Bickford can't get a boy to work for him here. What made you come? Couldn't you get a place at home?\"  \"I didn't try.\"  \"Well, you haven't done much in coming here.\"  \"I begin to think so,\" Kit responded, with a smile.  \"Hasn't the circus been in your town?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"I wanted to go, but I guess I'll manage to see it in Grafton. It shows there to-morrow.\"  \"Are you going?\" asked Kit with interest.  \"Yes; I shall walk. I'll start early and spend the day there.\"  \"We may meet there.\"  \"You don't expect to go, do you? Bickford won't let you off.\"  Kit smiled.  \"I don't think Mr. Bickford will have much to say about it,\" he said.  \"Are you going to hook jack?\" asked his new acquaintance.  \"I didn't mean to tell you, but I will. I have made up my mind not to work for Mr. Bickford at all.\"  \"Then why did you come here?\"  \"Because my uncle saw fit to arrange with him.\"  \"What are you going to do, then?\"  \"I am offered work with the circus.\"  \"You are!\" exclaimed the country boy, opening wide his eyes in astonishment. \"What are you going to do?\"  \"I'm going to be an acrobat.\"  \"What's that?\"  Kit explained as well as he could.  \"What are they going to pay you?\"  \"Ten dollars a week and my expenses,\" answered Kit, proudly.  \"Jehu!\" ejaculated the other boy. \"Why, that's good wages for a man. Do you think they'd hire me, too?\"  \"If you think you can do what they require, you can ask them.\"  \"Why can't I do it as well as you?\"  \"Because I have been practicing for a long time at a gymnasium. What is your name?\"  \"Bill Morris.\"  \"Then, Bill, don't say a word to any one about my plans. Suppose we go to Grafton together?\"  \"All right!\"  Before the boys parted they made an agreement to meet at five o'clock the next morning, to set out on their walk to Grafton.     CHAPTER X.  KIT'S FIRST NIGHT AT THE BLACKSMITH'S.   At nine o'clock the blacksmith, giving a deep yawn, said: \"You'd better be getting to bed, young feller. You'll have to be up bright and airly in the morning.\"  Kit was already feeling sleepy, and made no objection. Though it was yet early, he had found it hard work to get through the evening, as he could find nothing to read except a weekly paper, three months old, and a copy of \"Pilgrim's Progress.\" In truth, neither Mr. Bickford nor his wife were of a literary turn, and did not even manage to keep up with the news of the day.  \"I am ready,\" said Kit.  \"Mother, show him to his room,\" added the blacksmith. \"To-morrow I'll give him a lesson at the forge.\"  \"Perhaps you will,\" said Kit to himself, \"but I think it doubtful.\"  Kit's room was a small back one on the second floor. The front apartment was occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Bickford, and there was one of the same size which was used as a spare chamber.  Kit's room was supplied with a cot bed, and was furnished in the plainest manner. One thing he missed. He saw no washstand.  \"Where am I to wash in the morning?\" he asked.  \"You can wash in the tin basin in the kitchen,\" answered Mrs. Bickford. \"There's a bar of soap down there and a roller towel, so I guess you won't have to go dirty.\"  Kit shuddered at the suggestion. He had seen bars of yellow soap in the grocery at home, and didn't think he should enjoy its use. Nor did he fancy using the same towel with the blacksmith and his wife. He had seen the roller towel hanging beside the sink, and judged from its appearance that it had already been used nearly a week.  \"I have been accustomed to wash in my own room,\" he ventured to say.  \"You've been used to a great many things that you won't find here,\" replied Mrs. Bickford, grimly.  Kit thought it extremely likely.  \"If you can't do as the rest of us do, you can get along without washing,\" continued the lady.  \"I will try and manage,\" answered Kit, bearing in mind that he expected to leave the Bickford mansion forever the next morning.  \"That new boy of yours is kind of uppish,\" remarked Mrs. Bickford, when she returned to the sitting room.  \"What's the matter now?\"  \"He wants to wash in his own room. He's too fine a gentleman to wash in the kitchen.\"  \"What did you tell him?\"  Mrs. Bickford repeated her remark.  \"Good for you, mother! We'll take down his pride a little.\"  \"Is he goin' to work in them fine clo'es he brought with him?\"  \"He didn't bring any others.\"  \"He'll spile 'em, and not have anything to wear to meetin'.\"  \"Haven't we got a pair of overalls in the house--one that the last boy used?\"  \"Yes; I'll get 'em right away.\"  \"They'll be good for him to wear.\"  Before Kit got into bed, the door of his chamber was unceremoniously opened, and Mrs. Bickford walked in, carrying a faded pair of overalls.  \"You can put these on in the mornin',\" she said. \"They'll keep your clo'es clean. They may be a mite long for you, but you can turn up the legs at the bottom.\"  She left the room without waiting for an answer.  Kit surveyed the overalls with amusement.  \"I wonder how I should look in them,\" he said to himself.  He drew them over his trousers, and regarded his figure as well as he could in the little seven by nine glass that hung on the wall.  \"There is Kit, the young blacksmith!\" he said with a smile. \"On the whole, I don't think it improves my appearance. I'll take them off, and leave them for the next boy.\"  \"What did the boy say, mother?\" asked Mr. Bickford, upon his wife's return.  \"He just took 'em; he didn't say anything.\"  \"I s'pose he's never worn overalls before,\" said the blacksmith. \"What do you think he told me on the way over?\"  \"I don't know.\"  \"He said he wasn't goin' to work for me at all. He didn't like the blacksmith's trade.\"  \"Well, of all things!\"  \"I just told him he hadn't no choice in the matter, that me and his uncle had arranged matters, and that I should hold him to the contract.\"  \"I'm afraid he'll be dainty about his vittles. He didn't eat much dinner.\"  \"Wait till he gets to work, mother. I guess he'll have appetite enough. I mean he shall earn his board, at any rate.\"  \"I hope"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22521"],["title","The Young Acrobat of the Great North American Circus (#7)"],["body"," won't have no trouble with him, Aaron.\"  \"You needn't be afraid, mother.\"  \"Somehow, Aaron, you never did manage to keep boys very long,\" said Mrs. Bickford, dubiously.  \"Because their folks were weak, and allowed 'em to have their own way. It'll be different with this boy.\"  \"What makes you think so?\"  \"Because his uncle is anxious to get rid of him. He told me the boy, till lately, had imagined he was goin' to have property. He's supported him out of charity, dressin' him like a gentleman, sendin' him to school, and spendin' a pile of money on him. Now he thinks it about time to quit, and have the boy learn a trade. Of course the boy'll complain, and try to beg off, but it won't be no use. Stephen Watson won't make no account of what he says. He keeps a horse himself, and has promised to have him shod at my shop.\"  \"Well, it may be for the best; I hope so.\"  Aaron Bickford felt a good deal of confidence in himself. He understood very well that Kit was averse to working in his shop, but he meant to make him do it.  \"I'd like to see the boy I can't master,\" he said to himself, complacently. \"Years hence, when the boy has a forge of his own, he'll thank me for perseverin' with him. There's money to be made in the business. Why, when I began I wasn't worth a hundred dollars, and I owed for my anvil. Now I own this house and shop, and I've got a tidy sum in the bank.\"  This was true. But it must be added that the result was largely due to the pinching economy which both he and his wife had practiced.  When Mr. Bickford woke up the next morning it was half-past five o'clock.  \"Strange how I came to oversleep,\" he said. \"I guess I must have been more tuckered out than I supposed. Well, the boy's had a longer nap than I meant he should. However, it's only for one mornin'.\"  Mr. Bickford did not linger over his toilet. Five minutes was rather an overstatement of the time.  He went to Kit's chamber, and, opening the door, went in as unceremoniously as his wife had done the night before.  A surprise awaited him.  There was no one in the bed.  \"What! has the boy got up a'ready?\" he asked himself, in a bewildered way. \"He's better at gettin' up than I expected.\"  Looking about him, he discovered on a chair by the bedside the overalls, and upon them a note and a silver dollar.  \"What's all that mean?\" he asked himself.  Looking closer he saw that the note was directed to him. Beginning to suspect that something was wrong, he opened it.  This was what the note contained:       MR. BICKFORD--I leave you a dollar to pay for my food and lodging.      I do not care to become a blacksmith. Good by.                                                       KIT WATSON.  \"I'll have him back!\" exclaimed Aaron Bickford, an angry look appearing on his face. \"He ain't goin' to get the best of me.\"  Mr. Bickford harnessed up his horse, and started after the fugitive. But in what direction should he drive? He was not long at fault. He met a milkman who had seen two boys starting out on the Grafton road, and so informed him.  \"I guess they're bound for the circus,\" he said.  \"Like as not,\" returned the blacksmith.  But he had a long chase of it. It was not until he was within half a mile of the circus tents that he descried the two boys, trudging along, Kit with his valise in his hand. Hearing the sound of wheels, the boys looked back, and in some dismay recognized their pursuer.  The blacksmith stood up in his wagon, and pointing his long whip at Kit, cried out, \"Stop where you are, Kit Watson, or I'll give you the worst thrashing you ever had!\"     CHAPTER XI.  KIT FALLS INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY.   If Aaron Bickford expected to frighten Kit by his threat, he was destined to find himself badly mistaken.  Kit was startled at first, not having anticipated that the blacksmith would get upon his track so soon. But he was a boy of spirit, and had no thought of surrender. Mr. Bickford halted his horse, and Kit faced him.  \"Didn't you find my note?\" he asked.  \"Yes, I did.\"  \"Then you know that I don't care to work for you.\"  \"What's that got to do with it? Your uncle and me have settled that you shall.\"  \"Then you'll have to unsettle it. I have a right to choose my own occupation, and I don't intend to become a blacksmith. Even if I did, I should choose some one else as my teacher.\"  \"None of your impudence, young man! You'll have a long account to settle with me, I warn you of that.\"  \"I had but one account to settle--for my board and lodging--and I've attended to that. Good morning, Mr. Bickford.\"  Kit turned and began to continue his journey.  \"Hallo! Stop, I tell you!\" shouted the blacksmith.  \"Have you got any more to say? If so, I'll listen.\"  \"What more I have to say, I shall say with a horsewhip!\" retorted Bickford, grimly, preparing to descend from his wagon.  \"Come, William, we must run for it,\" said Kit. \"Are you good at running?\"  \"Try me!\" was the laconic reply.  By the time Aaron Bickford was out of his wagon, the boys had increased the distance between them by several rods.  \"Oho, so that's your game, is it?\" said the blacksmith. \"If I don't overhaul them, my name isn't Aaron Bickford.\"  Kit was a good runner--quite as good as his pursuer--but he had one serious disadvantage. His valise was heavy, and materially affected his speed. He had carried it several miles, and though he had shifted it from one hand to the other, both arms were now tired.  \"Let me take it, Kit,\" said his companion, who was now on intimate terms with him.  \"It'll be just as heavy for you as for me.\"  \"Never mind! He isn't after me.\"  \"Well, if you don't mind carrying it a little while.\"  The advantage of the change was soon apparent. Kit increased his speed, and William, whose arms were not tired, was not materially retarded by his burden.  \"If I had no valise I would climb a tree,\" said Kit, while running. \"I don't believe Mr. Bickford is good at climbing.\"  \"We haven't got far to go to reach the circus tents,\" returned William.  But though the boys held out well, Aaron Bickford gradually gained upon them. Many years at the anvil had given him plenty of wind and endurance. Besides, he was entirely fresh, not having taken a long walk already, as the boys had done.  \"You'd better give up!\" he cried out, in the tone of one who was sure of victory. \"It takes more than a boy like you to get the best of Aaron Bickford.\"  It did indeed seem as if the boys must surrender. Within a few rods Bickford would be even with them.  Kit came to a sudden determination.  \"Jump over the fence!\" he cried.  There was a rail fence skirting one side of the road.  No sooner said than done. Both boys clambered over the fence, and with that barrier between them faced the angry blacksmith.  \"Well, I've got you!\" he cried, panting.  \"Have you? I don't see it,\" answered Kit.  \"You might as well give up fust as last.\"  \"Suppose we discuss matters a little, Mr. Bickford,\" said Kit, calmly. \"What right have you to pursue me?\"  \"What right? Your uncle's given me the charge of you.\"  \"That is something he had no right to do.\"  \"Why not? Ain't he your guardian?\"  \"No.\"  \"Who is, then?\"  \"I have no guardian but myself.\"  \"That's a likely story. I can't listen to no such foolish talk.\"  Aaron Bickford felt that it was time to move upon the enemy's entrenchments, and, putting one leg on the lower rail, he proceeded to climb over the fence.  But the boys had anticipated this move, and were prepared for it. By the time the blacksmith was inside the field, the boys, who were considerably lighter and more active, had crossed to the reverse side.  \"Here we are again, Mr. Bickford,\" said William Morris.  The blacksmith frowned.  \"Don't you be impudent, Bill Morris,\" he said. \"I haven't anything to do with you, but I sha'n't let you sass me.\"  \"What have I said that's out of the way?\" asked William.  \"Oh, you're mighty innocent, you are! You're aidin' and abettin' Kit Watson to escape from me, his lawful master.\"  \"I have no master, Mr. Bickford,\" said Kit, proudly.  \"Well, that's what they used to call 'em when I was a boy. Boys weren't so pert and impudent in them days.\"  Meanwhile the blacksmith was recrossing the fence.  Kit and William took the opportunity to run, and by the time Mr. Bickford was again on the roadside they were several rods away.  This naturally exasperated the blacksmith, who felt mortified at his failure to overtake the youngsters. A new idea occurred to him.  \"You, Bill, do you want to earn a dime?\" he asked.  \"How?\" inquired William.  \"Just help me catch that boy Kit, and I'll give you ten cents.\"  \"I don't care to earn money that way, Mr. Bickford,\" responded William, scornfully.  \"Good for you, William!\" exclaimed Kit.  \"You won't earn ten cents any easier,\" persisted Bickford.  \"I wouldn't do such a mean thing for a dollar, nor five dollars,\" replied William. \"Kit's a friend of mine, and I'm going to stand by him.\"  The blacksmith was made angry by this persistent refusal. Then again he was faint and uncomfortable from having missed his breakfast, which seemed likely to be indefinitely postponed.  \"I'll lick you, Bill Morris, as well as Kit, when I catch you,\" he said.  \"Probably you will--when you catch me!\" retorted William, in an aggravating tone. \"Run faster, Kit.\"  The boys ran, but again they were impeded by the heavy valise, and slowly but surely the blacksmith was gaining upon them.  Kit, who was again carrying the burden, began to show signs of distress, and dropped behind his companion.  \"I can't hold out much longer, Bill,\" he said, puffing laboriously.  Aaron Bickford heard these words, and they impelled him to extra exertion. At last he caught up and grasped Kit by the collar.  \"I've got ye at last!\" he cried, triumphantly.     CHAPTER XII.  MR. BICKFORD'S DEFEAT.   Aaron Bickford was a strong man. By his work at the forge he had strengthened his muscles till they were like iron. So was Kit a strong boy, but it would be absurd to represent him as a match"]]]
