The hero of our tale displays all that careless jollity, which copious draughts of maddening wine are calculated to inspire; he laughs the world away, and bids it pass. The poor dupe, without his periwig, in the back-ground, forms a good contrast of character: he is maudlin drunk, and sadly sick. To keep up the spirit of unity throughout the society, and not leave the poor African girl entirely neglected, she is making signs to her friend the porter, who perceives, and slightly returns, her love-inspiring glance. This print is rather crowded,--the subject demanded it should be so; some of the figures, thrown into shade, might have helped the general effect, but would have injured the characteristic expression.\"  [Illustration: THE RAKE'S PROGRESS.  PLATE 3.  TAVERN SCENE.]     PLATE IV.  ARRESTED FOR DEBT.      \"O, vanity of youthful blood,     So by misuse to poison good!     Reason awakes, and views unbarr'd     The sacred gates he wish'd to guard;     Approaching, see the harpy _Law_,     And _Poverty_, with icy paw,     Ready to seize the poor remains     That vice has left of all his gains.     Cold _penitence_, lame _after-thought_,     With fear, despair, and horror fraught,     Call back his guilty pleasures dead,     Whom he hath wrong'd, and whom betray'd.\"   The career of dissipation is here stopped. Dressed in the first style of the ton, and getting out of a sedan-chair, with the hope of shining in the circle, and perhaps forwarding a former application for a place or a pension, he is arrested! To intimate that being plundered is the certain consequence of such an event, and to shew how closely one misfortune treads upon the heels of another, a boy is at the same moment stealing his cane.  The unfortunate girl whom he basely deserted, is now a milliner, and naturally enough attends in the crowd, to mark the fashions of the day. Seeing his distress, with all the eager tenderness of unabated love, she flies to his relief. Possessed of a small sum of money, the hard earnings of unremitted industry, she generously offers her purse for the liberation of her worthless favourite. This releases the captive beau, and displays a strong instance of female affection; which, being once planted in the bosom, is rarely eradicated by the coldest neglect, or harshest cruelty.  The high-born, haughty Welshman, with an enormous leek, and a countenance keen and lofty as his native mountains, establishes the chronology, and fixes the day to be the first of March; which being sacred to the titular saint of Wales, was observed at court.      Mr. Nichols remarks of this plate:--\"In the early impressions, a     shoe-black steals the Rake's cane. In the modern ones, a large group     of sweeps, and black-shoe boys, are introduced gambling on the     pavement; near them a stone inscribed _Black's_, a contrast to     _White's_ gaming-house, against which a flash of lightning is     pointed. The curtain in the window of the sedan-chair is thrown     back. This plate is likewise found in an intermediate state; the sky     being made unnaturally obscure, with an attempt to introduce a     shower of rain, and lightning very aukwardly represented. It is     supposed to be a first proof after the insertion of the group of     blackguard gamesters; the window of the chair being only marked for     an alteration that was afterwards made in it. Hogarth appears to     have so far spoiled the sky, that he was obliged to obliterate it,     and cause it to be engraved over again by another hand.\"      Mr. Gilpin observes:--\"Very disagreeable accidents often befal     gentlemen of pleasure. An event of this kind is recorded in the     fourth print, which is now before us. Our hero going, in full dress,     to pay his compliments at court on St. David's day, was accosted in     the rude manner which is here represented.--The composition is good.     The form of the group, made up of the figures in action, the chair,     and the lamplighter, is pleasing. Only, here we have an opportunity     of remarking, that a group is disgusting when the extremities of it     are heavy. A group in some respects should resemble a tree. The     heavier part of the foliage (the cup, as the landscape-painter calls     it) is always near the middle; the outside branches, which are     relieved by the sky, are light and airy. An inattention to this rule     has given a heaviness to the group before us. The two bailiffs, the     woman, and the chairman, are all huddled together in that part of     the group which should have been the lightest; while the middle     part, where the hand holds the door, wants strength and consistence.     It may be added too, that the four heads, in the form of a diamond,     make an unpleasing shape. All regular figures should be studiously     avoided.--The light had been well distributed, if the bailiff     holding the arrest, and the chairman, had been a little lighter, and     the woman darker. The glare of the white apron is disagreeable.--We     have, in this print, some beautiful instances of expression. The     surprise and terror of the poor gentleman is apparent in every limb,     as far as is consistent with the fear of discomposing his dress. The     insolence of power in one of the bailiffs, and the unfeeling heart,     which can jest with misery, in the other, are strongly marked. The     self-importance, too, of the honest Cambrian is not ill portrayed;     who is chiefly introduced to settle the chronology of the story.--In     pose of grace, we have nothing striking. Hogarth might have     introduced a degree of it in the female figure: at least he might     have contrived to vary the heavy and unpleasing form of her     drapery.--The perspective is good, and makes an agreeable shape.\"  [Illustration: THE RAKE'S PROGRESS.  PLATE 4.  ARRESTED FOR DEBT AS GOING TO COURT.]     PLATE V.  MARRIES AN OLD MAID.      \"New to the school of hard _mishap_,     Driven from the ease of fortune's lap.     What schemes will nature not embrace     T' avoid less shame of drear distress?     _Gold_ can the charms of youth bestow,     And mask deformity with shew:     Gold can avert the sting of shame,     In Winter's arms create a flame:     Can couple youth with hoary age,     And make antipathies engage.\"   To be thus degraded by the rude enforcement of the law, and relieved from an exigence by one whom he had injured, would have wounded, humbled, I had almost said reclaimed, any man who had either feeling or elevation of mind; but, to mark the progression of vice, we here see this depraved, lost character, hypocritically violating every natural feeling of the soul, to recruit his exhausted finances, and marrying an old and withered Sybil, at the sight of whom nature must recoil.  The ceremony passes in the old church, Mary-le-bone, which was then considered at such a distance from London, as to become the usual resort of those who wished to be privately married; that such was the view of this prostituted young man, may be fairly inferred from a glance at the object of his choice. Her charms are heightened by the affectation of an amorous leer, which she directs to her youthful husband, in grateful return for a similar compliment which she supposes paid to herself. This gives her face much meaning, but meaning of such a sort, that an observer being ask, \"_How dreadful must be this creature's hatred?_\" would naturally reply, \"_How hateful must be her love!_\"  In his demeanor we discover an attempt to appear at the altar with becoming decorum: but internal perturbation darts through assumed tranquillity, for though he is _plighting his troth_ to the old woman, his eyes are fixed on the young girl who kneels behind her.  The parson and clerk seem made for each other; a sleepy, stupid solemnity marks every muscle of the divine, and the nasal droning of the _lay brother_ is most happily expressed. Accompanied by her child and mother, the unfortunate victim of his seduction is here again introduced, endeavouring to enter the church, and forbid the banns. The opposition made by an old pew-opener, with her bunch of keys, gave the artist a good opportunity for indulging his taste in the burlesque, and he has not neglected it.  A dog (Trump, Hogarth's favorite), paying his addresses to a one-eyed quadruped of his own species, is a happy parody of the unnatural union going on in the church.  The commandments are broken: a crack runs near the tenth, which says, _Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife;_ a prohibition in the present case hardly necessary. The creed is destroyed by the damps of the church; and so little attention has been paid to the poor's box, that it is covered with a _cobweb_! These three high-wrought strokes of satirical humour were perhaps never equalled by any exertion of the pencil; excelled they cannot be.  On one of the pew doors is the following curious specimen of church-yard poetry, and mortuary orthography.      THESE : PEWES : VNSCRUD : AND TANE : IN : SVNDER     IN : STONE : THERS : GRAUEN : WHAT : IS : VNDER     TO : WIT : A VALT : FOR : BURIAL : THERE : IS     WHICH : EDWARD : FORSET : MADE : FOR : HIM : AND : HIS.  This is a correct copy of the inscription. Part of these lines, in raised letters, now form a pannel in the wainscot at the end of the right-hand gallery, as the church is entered from the street. The mural monument of the Taylor's, composed of lead, gilt over, is still preserved: it is seen in Hogarth's print, just under the window.  A glory over the bride's head is whimsical.  The bay and holly, which decorate the pews, give a date to the period, and determine this preposterous union of January with June, to have taken place about the time of Christmas;      \"When Winter linger'd in her icy veins.\"  Addison would"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22500"],["title","The Works of William Hogarth: In a Series of Engravings (#5)"],["body"," classed her among the evergreens of the sex.  It has been observed, that \"the church is too small, and the wooden post, which seems to have no use, divides the picture very disagreeably.\" This cannot be denied: but it appears to be meant as an accurate representation of the place, and the artist delineated what he saw.  The grouping is good, and the principal figure has the air of a gentleman. The light is well distributed, and the scene most characteristically represented.  The commandments being represented as broken, might probably give the hint to a lady's reply, on being told that thieves had the preceding night broken into the church, and stolen the communion-plate, and the ten commandments. \"I suppose,\" added the informant, \"that they may melt and sell the plate; but can you divine for what possible purpose they could steal the commandments?\"--\"To _break_ them, to be sure,\" replied she;--\"to _break_ them.\"  [Illustration: THE RAKE'S PROGRESS.  PLATE 5.  MARRIES AN OLD MAID.]     PLATE VI.  SCENE IN A GAMING HOUSE.      \"_Gold_, thou bright son of Phoebus, source     Of universal intercourse;     Of weeping Virtue soft redress:     And blessing those who live to bless:     Yet oft behold this sacred trust,     The tool of avaricious lust;     No longer bond of human kind,     But bane of every virtuous mind.     What chaos such misuse attends,     Friendship stoops to prey on friends;     Health, that gives relish to delight,     Is wasted with the wasting night;     Doubt and mistrust is thrown on _Heaven_,     And all its power to chance is given.     Sad purchase of repentant tears,      }     Of needless quarrels, endless fears,  }     Of hopes of moments, pangs of years!  }     Sad purchase of a tortured mind,     To an imprison'd body join'd.\"   Though now, from the infatuated folly of his antiquated wife, in possession of a fortune, he is still the slave of that baneful vice, which, while it enslaves the mind, poisons the enjoyments, and sweeps away the possessions of its deluded votaries. Destructive as the earthquake which convulses nature, it overwhelms the pride of the forest, and engulfs the labours of the architect.  Newmarket and the cockpit were the scenes of his early amusements; to crown the whole, he is now exhibited at a gaming-table, where all is lost! His countenance distorted with agony, and his soul agitated almost to madness, he imprecates vengeance upon his own head.      \"In heartfelt bitter anguish he appears,     And from the blood-shot ball gush purpled tears!     He beats his brow, with rage and horror fraught;     His brow half bursts with agony of thought!\"  That he should be deprived of all he possessed in such a society as surround him, is not to be wondered at. One of the most conspicuous characters appears, by the pistol in his pocket, to be a highwayman: from the profound stupor of his countenance, we are certain he also is a losing gamester; and so absorbed in reflection, that neither the boy who brings him a glass of water, nor the watchman's cry of \"Fire!\" can arouse him from his reverie. Another of the party is marked for one of those well-dressed continental adventurers, who, being unable to live in their own country, annually pour into this, and with no other requisites than a quick eye, an adroit hand, and an undaunted forehead, are admitted into what is absurdly enough called _good_ company.  At the table a person in mourning grasps his hat, and hides his face, in the agony of repentance, not having, as we infer from his weepers, received that legacy of which he is now plundered more than \"a little month.\" On the opposite side is another, on whom fortune has severely frowned, biting his nails in the anguish of his soul. The fifth completes the climax; he is frantic; and with a drawn sword endeavours to destroy a _pauvre miserable_ whom he supposes to have cheated him, but is prevented by the interposition of one of those staggering votaries of Bacchus who are to be found in every company where there is good wine; and gaming, like the rod of Moses, so far swallows up every other passion, that the actors, engrossed by greater objects, willingly leave their wine to the audience.  In the back-ground are two collusive associates, eagerly dividing the profits of the evening.  A nobleman in the corner is giving his note to an usurer. The lean and hungry appearance of this cent. per cent. worshipper of the golden calf, is well contrasted by the sleek, contented vacancy of so well-employed a legislator of this great empire. Seated at the table, a portly gentleman, of whom we see very little, is coolly sweeping off his winnings.  So engrossed is every one present by his own situation, that the flames which surround them are disregarded, and the vehement cries of a watchman entering the room, are necessary to rouse their attention to what is generally deemed the first law of nature, self-preservation.      Mr. Gilpin observes:--\"The fortune, which our adventurer has just     received, enables him to make one push more at the gaming-table. He     is exhibited, in the sixth print, venting curses on his folly for     having lost his last stake.--This is, upon the whole, perhaps, the     best print of the set. The horrid scene it describes, was never more     inimitably drawn. The composition is artful, and natural. If the     shape of the whole be not quite pleasing, the figures are so well     grouped, and with so much ease and variety, that you cannot take     offence.      \"The expression, in almost every figure, is admirable; and the whole     is a strong representation of the human mind in a storm. Three     stages of that species of madness which attends gaming, are here     described. On the first shock, all is inward dismay. The ruined     gamester is represented leaning against a wall, with his arms     across, lost in an agony of horror. Perhaps never passion was     described with so much force. In a short time this horrible gloom     bursts into a storm of fury: he tears in pieces what comes next him;     and, kneeling down, invokes curses upon himself. He next attacks     others; every one in his turn whom he imagines to have been     instrumental in his ruin.--The eager joy of the winning gamesters,     the attention of the usurer, the vehemence of the watchman, and the     profound reverie of the highwayman, are all admirably marked. There     is great coolness, too, expressed in the little we see of the fat     gentleman at the end of the table.\"  [Illustration: THE RAKE'S PROGRESS.  PLATE 6.  GAMING HOUSE SCENE.]     PLATE VII.  PRISON SCENE.      \"Happy the man whose constant thought,     (Though in the school of hardship taught,)     Can send remembrance back to fetch     Treasures from life's earliest stretch;     Who, self-approving, can review     Scenes of past virtues, which shine through     The gloom of age, and cast a ray     To gild the evening of his day!     Not so the guilty wretch confined:     No pleasures meet his conscious mind;     No blessings brought from early youth,     But broken faith, and wrested truth;     Talents idle and unused,     And every trust of Heaven abused.     In seas of sad reflection lost,     From horrors still to horrors toss'd,     _Reason_ the vessel leaves to steer,     And gives the helm to mad _Despair_.\"   By a very natural transition Mr. Hogarth has passed his hero from a gaming house into a prison--the inevitable consequence of extravagance. He is here represented in a most distressing situation, without a coat to his back, without money, without a friend to help him. Beggared by a course of ill-luck, the common attendant on the gamester, having first made away with every valuable he was master of, and having now no other resource left to retrieve his wretched circumstances, he at last, vainly promising himself success, commences author, and attempts, though inadequate to the task, to write a play, which is lying on the table, just returned with an answer from the manager of the theatre, to whom he had offered it, that his piece would by no means do. Struck speechless with this disastrous occurrence, all his hopes vanish, and his most sanguine expectations are changed into dejection of spirit. To heighten his distress, he is approached by his wife, and bitterly upbraided for his perfidy in concealing from her his former connexions (with that unhappy girl who is here present with her child, the innocent offspring of her amours, fainting at the sight of his misfortunes, being unable to relieve him farther), and plunging her into those difficulties she never shall be able to surmount. To add to his misery, we see the under-turnkey pressing him for his prison fees, or garnish-money, and the boy refusing to leave the beer he ordered, without being first paid for it. Among those assisting the fainting mother, one of whom we observe clapping her hand, another applying the drops, is a man crusted over, as it were, with the rust of a gaol, supposed to have started from his dream, having been disturbed by the noise at a time when he was settling some affairs of state; to have left his great plan unfinished, and to have hurried to the assistance of distress. We are told, by the papers falling from his lap, one of which contains a scheme for paying the national debt, that his confinement is owing to that itch of politics some persons are troubled with, who will neglect their own affairs, in order to busy themselves in that which noways concerns them, and which they in no respect understand, though their immediate ruin shall follow it: nay, so infatuated do we find him, so taken up with his beloved object, as not to bestow a few minutes on the decency of his person. In the back of the room is one who owes his ruin to an indefatigable search after the philosopher's stone. Strange and unaccountable!--Hence we are taught by these characters, as well as by the pair of human wings on the tester of the bed, that scheming"]]]
