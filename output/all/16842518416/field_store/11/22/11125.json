Well, that explains it. I say, kid, you ought to join a circus. You'd command a fine salary.\"  \"Would I? How much could I get?\" asked Kit, with interest.  \"Ten or twelve dollars a week and all expenses paid. That's pretty good pay for a kid, isn't it?\"  \"It's more than I ever earned yet,\" answered Kit, with a smile.  \"I shouldn't wonder if Mr. Barlow would give you that now. If you ever make up your mind to join a show, come round and see him.\"  \"Thank you,\" said Kit.  Soon after the boys left the circus lot and went home.  \"Would you really join a circus, Kit?\" asked Dan.  \"It isn't the life I would choose,\" answered Kit, seriously, \"but I may have to find some way of earning a living, and that very soon.\"  \"I thought your father left you a fortune.\"  \"So did I; but I hear that I am to be taken from boarding school, and possibly set to work. Ralph has given me a hint of it. I shall soon know, as my uncle intimates that he has a communication to make me.\"  \"I hope it isn't as bad as you think, Kit.\"  \"I hope so too, but I can tell you better to-morrow. We will meet to-night at the show.\"     CHAPTER IV.  A SCENE NOT DOWN ON THE BILLS.   Just before supper Kit was asked to an interview with his uncle.  \"You wish to speak to me, Uncle Stephen?\" he said.  \"Yes; I have decided not to postpone the explanation for which you asked yesterday.\"  \"I shall be glad to hear it, sir.\"  \"Ever since your father's death I have supported you, not because I was morally or legally bound to do so, but because you were my nephew.\"  \"But didn't my father leave any property?\" asked Kit in amazement.  \"He was supposed to have done so.\"  \"This house and grounds are surely worth a good deal of money!\"  \"So they are,\" answered Stephen Watson, dryly, \"but unfortunately they did not belong to your father.\"  \"This is certainly a mistake,\" exclaimed Kit, indignantly.  \"Wait till I have finished. These stood in your father's name, but there was a mortgage of two thousand dollars held by the Smyrna Savings Bank.\"  \"Surely the place is worth far more than two thousand dollars!\"  \"Curb your impatience, and you will soon understand me. The place _is_ worth far more than two thousand dollars. I consider it worth ten thousand.\"  \"Then I don't see----\"  \"Your father left large debts, which of course had to be paid. I was therefore obliged to sell the estate, in order to realize the necessary funds.\"  \"For how much did you sell the place?\"  \"For nine thousand dollars. I regarded that as a good price, considering that it was paid in cash or the equivalent.\"  \"To whom did you sell?\"  \"I bought it in myself; I was not willing that the place which my brother had loved so well, should pass into the hands of strangers.\"  \"May I ask who was my father's principal creditor?\" asked Kit.  \"Ahem! I was,\" answered Stephen Watson, in a tone of slight embarrassment.  \"You!\" exclaimed Kit, in fresh surprise.  \"Yes; your father owed me twelve thousand dollars borrowed at various times.\"  \"How could he have been obliged to borrow so much?\" asked Kit. \"He always seemed comfortably situated. I never once heard him complain of being pressed for money.\"  \"Very likely; he was very reticent about his affairs. I would explain, but the matter is rather a delicate one.\"  \"I think I am entitled to know all about it, Uncle Stephen,\" said Kit, firmly.  \"Be it so! Perhaps you are right. Let me tell you in the briefest terms, then, that in his later years your father speculated in Wall Street--not heavily, for he had not the means, but heavily for one of his property. Of course he lost. Almost every one does, who ventures into the 'street.' His first losses, instead of deterring him from further speculation, led him on to rasher ventures. It was then that he came to me for money.\"  \"Didn't you urge him to give up speculating?\" asked Kit.  \"Yes, but my words availed little. Perhaps you will think I ought to have refused him loans, but he assured me in the strongest terms that unless he obtained money from some source he would be ruined, and I yielded. I might have been weak--it was weak, for I stood a chance of losing all, having merely his notes of hand to show for the money I lent. But it is hard to refuse a brother. I think I should do the same again.\"  Kit was silent. His uncle's words were warm, and indicated strong sympathy for Kit's father, but his tone was cold, and there seemed a lack of earnestness. Kit could not repress a feeling of incredulity. There was another obstacle to his accepting with full credence the tale which his uncle told him. He had always understood from his father that his uncle was a poor and struggling man. How could he have in his possession the sum of twelve thousand dollars to lend his brother? This question was certainly difficult to answer. He paused, then refraining from discussing the subject, said:  \"Why have you not told me this before, Uncle Stephen?\"  \"Would it have made you any happier?\" returned Stephen Watson.  \"No.\"  \"Till you had acquired a fair education, I thought it better to keep the unpleasant truth from you. It would only have annoyed you to feel that you owed everything to my generosity, and were in fact a child of charity.\"  Kit's face flushed deeply as he heard this expression from his uncle's lips.  \"Do you mean that my father left absolutely nothing?\" he asked.  \"Yes, absolutely nothing. Well, no, not quite that. I think there was a balance of a little over a hundred dollars left after paying all debts. That is hardly worth counting.\"  \"Yes, that is hardly worth counting,\" said Kit in a dull, mechanical tone.  \"Still, I determined to educate you, and give you equal advantages with my own son. I have done so up to the present moment. I wish I could continue to do so, but Ralph is getting more expensive as he grows older (and you also), and I cannot afford to keep you both at school. You will therefore stop studying, and I shall secure you some work.\"  \"If things are as you say, I cannot complain of this,\" Kit said in a dull, spiritless tone, \"but it comes upon me like a thunderbolt.\"  \"No doubt, no doubt. I knew it would be a shock, and I have postponed telling you as long as possible.\"  \"I suppose I ought to thank you. Have you anything more to say to me now?\"  \"No.\"  \"Then, sir, I will leave you. I will ask further particulars some other day.\"  \"He takes it hard,\" muttered Stephen Watson, eyeing the retreating form of his nephew thoughtfully. \"I wonder if he will suspect that there is anything wrong. Even if he does, he is only a boy, and can prove nothing.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"What makes you so glum, Kit?\" asked Dan Clark, when they met at seven o'clock, as agreed, to go together to the show.  \"Not much, Dan, only I have learned that I am a pauper.\"  \"But the estate--the house and the grounds?\" said Dan, bewildered.  \"Belong to my uncle.\"  \"Who says so?\"  \"He says so. But I don't want to say any more about it now. Let us start for the circus, and I will try to forget my pauper position, for one evening at least.\"  Before they reached the lot, they heard the circus band discoursing lively music. They were in a crowd, for all Smyrna, men, women and children, were bound for the show. It was a grand gala night. In the city, where there are many amusements, the circus draws well, but in the country everybody goes.  Outside the great tent were the side shows. In one of them Kit found his friends of the morning, the giant, the dwarf, and the fat lady, with other curiosities hereafter to be mentioned. Just inside the tent, in what might be called the ante chamber, was the collection of animals. The elephants were accorded more freedom than the rest, but the lion, tiger, and leopard were shut up in cages. The lion seemed particularly restless. He was pacing his narrow quarters, lashing his tail, and from time to time emitting deep growls, betokening irritation and anger.  \"How would you like to go into the cage?\" asked Dan.  \"I don't care for an interview with his majesty,\" responded Kit.  A stranger was standing near the cage.  \"Don't go too near, boys!\" he said. \"That lion is particularly fierce. He nearly killed a man last season in Pennsylvania.\"  \"How was that?\"  \"The man ventured too near the cage. The lion stretched out his claws, and fastened them in the man's shoulder, lacerating it fearfully before he could be released. He came near dying of blood poisoning.\"  Kit and Dan sheered off. The lion looked wicked enough to kill a dozen men.  At eight o'clock the performance commenced. First there was a procession of elephants and horses, the latter carrying the bareback riders and other members of the circus, with the curiosities and freaks. Then came two bareback riders, who jumped through hoops, and over banners, and performed somersaults, to the wondering delight of the boys. Then came tumblers, and in preparation for another scene a gaudily dressed clown entered the ring. Suddenly there was heard a deep baying sound, which struck terror into every heart. It was the lion; but seemed close at hand. In an instant a dark, cat-like form, rushing down the aisle, sprang into the ring.  The great Numidian lion had broken from his cage, and the life of every one in the audience was in peril. Ladies shrieked, strong men grew pale, and all wildly looked about for some way of escape.  Striking down the clown, and standing with one foot on the prostrate form, the lion's cruel eyes wandered slowly over the vast assemblage.  Only ten feet from him, in front seats, sat Kit and Dan.  Kit rose in his seat pale and excited, but with a resolute fire in his eyes. He had thought of a way to vanquish the lion.     CHAPTER V.  HOW KIT VANQUISHED THE LION.   The danger was imminent. Under the canvas there were at least"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22521"],["title","The Young Acrobat of the Great North American Circus (#3)"],["body","thousand spectators. Smyrna had less than five thousand inhabitants, but from towns around there were numerous excursion parties, which helped to swell the number present. Had these people foreseen the terrible scene not down on the bills, they would have remained at home and locked the doors of their houses. But danger is seldom anticipated and peril generally finds us unprepared.  Dan Clark saw Kit about to leave his seat.  \"Where are you going?\" he cried.  \"I am going into the arena.\"  \"What? Are you out of your head?\" asked Dan, and he took hold of Kit to detain him. But the boy tore himself from the grasp of his friend, and with blanched brow, for he knew full well the risk he ran, he sprang over the parapet, and in an instant he stood in the sawdust circle facing the angry monarch of the wilds, whose presence had struck terror into the hearts of two thousand members of a superior race.  The sudden movement of Kit created a sensation only less than the appearance of the lion.  The residents of Smyrna all knew him, but they could not understand the cause of his apparent fool-hardiness.  \"Come back! Come away, for your life!\" exclaimed dozens of Kit's friends and acquaintances.  \"Who is that boy? Is he one of the circus men?\" asked strangers who were present.  \"You will be killed, Kit! Come back!\" implored Dan Clark, appalled at the danger of his friend.  Kit heard, but did not heed, the various calls. He knew what he was about, and he did not mean to be killed. But there seemed the greatest danger of it. He was six feet from the angry beast, who lashed his tail with renewed wrath, when he saw his new and puny foe. Kit knew, however, that the lion's method of attack is to spring upon his victims, and that he needs a space of from twelve to fifteen feet to do it. He himself, being but six feet distant, was within the necessary space. The lion must increase the distance between them in order to accomplish its purpose.  Now it happened that Mr. Watson had in his kitchen an elderly woman, who had for years been addicted to the obnoxious habit of snuff taking--a habit, I am glad to be able to say, which is far less prevalent now than in former days. Just before Kit had started for the circus, Ellen, who was a Scotch woman, said: \"Master Kit, if you are going near the store, will you buy me a quarter of a pound of snuff?\"  \"Certainly, Ellen,\" answered Kit, who was always obliging.  The snuff he had in his pocket at the time of the lion's appearance in the ring, and it was the thought of this unusual but formidable weapon that gave him courage. If he had merely had a pistol or revolver in his pocket, he would not have ventured, for he knew that a wound would only make the lion fiercer and more dangerous.  The lion stood stock still for a moment. Apparently he was amazed at the daring of the boy who had rushed into his presence. His fierce eyes began to roll wickedly and he uttered one of those deep, hoarse growls, such as are wont to strike fear alike into animals and men. He glared at Kit very much as a cat surveys a puny mouse whom she purposes to make her victim.  It was a few brief seconds, but to the audience, who were spellbound, and scarcely dared to breathe, it seemed as many minutes that the boy and lion stood confronting each other without moving. Indeed, Kit stood as if fascinated before the mighty beast, and a thrill passed through his frame as he realized the terrible danger into which he had impulsively rushed. But he knew full well that his peril was each instant growing greater. He could not retreat now, for the furious beast would improve the chance to spring upon him and rend him to pieces.  With curious deliberation he drew from his pocket a paper parcel, while the lion, as if stirred by curiosity, eyed him attentively. He opened it carefully, and then, without an instant's delay, he flung a handful of the snuff which it contained full in the eyes of the terrible animal.  No sooner had he done so than he gave a spring, and in a flash was over the parapet and back in his seat.  It was not a moment too soon!  The lion was blinded by the snuff, which caused him intense pain. He released the terrified clown, who lost no time in escaping from the arena, while the vanquished beast rolled around on the sawdust in his agony, sending forth meanwhile the most terrible roars.  By this time the circus management had recovered from its momentary panic. The trainer and half a dozen animal men (those whose duty it was to take care of the animals) rushed into the circle, and soon obtained the mastery of the lion, whose pain had subdued his fury, and who was now moaning piteously.  Then through the crowded tent there ran a thrill of admiration for the boy who had delivered them all from a terrible danger.  One man, an enthusiastic Western visitor, sprang to his feet, and, waving his hat, exclaimed: \"Three cheers for the brave boy, who has shown more courage than all the rest of us put together! Hip, hip, hurrah!\"  The call was responded to with enthusiasm. Men and even women rose in their seats, and joined in the cheering. But some of the friends of Kit amended the suggestion by crying, \"Hurrah for Kit Watson!\"  \"Hurrah for Kit Watson!\" cried the Western man. \"He's the pluckiest kid I ever saw yet.\"  Kit had not been frightened before, but he felt undeniably nervous when he saw the eyes of two thousand people fixed upon him. He blushed and seemed disposed to screen himself from observation. But at this moment a tall, portly man advanced from the front of the tent, and came up to where Kit was sitting.  \"My boy,\" he said, \"do me the favor to follow me. I am Mr. Barlow.\"  It was indeed the proprietor of the circus. He had come in person to greet the boy who had averted such a tragedy.  Mechanically Kit followed Mr. Barlow, who led him again into the arena. Then the manager cleared his throat, and said:  \"Ladies and gentlemen, I have nothing to show you here to-night that is better worth your attention than the young man whose heroic act you have just witnessed and profited by. I introduce to you the boy hero, Kit Watson!\"  \"Speech! speech!\" exclaimed the spectators, after a liberal meed of applause.  Kit stood erect, and spoke modestly.  \"I don't pretend to be a hero,\" he said. \"I was as much frightened as anybody, but I thought of the snuff in my pocket, and I recalled to mind a story of a man who subdued a lunatic by means of it. So, on the impulse of the moment, I jumped into the ring. I am very much obliged to you for your cheers, and I wish I was as brave as you seem to think. I won't take up any more of your time, for I know you want the show to go on.\"  Kit retired amid a burst of applause, and resumed his seat.  The entertainment of the evening now proceeded, greatly to the satisfaction of the crowded ranks of spectators. But from time to time glances were cast towards the seat which Kit occupied.  \"Kit,\" whispered Dan, \"I am proud of you! I didn't think you had it in you.\"  \"Don't say any more, Dan, or I shall become so vain you can't endure me. Look! there are our friends, the acrobats.\"     CHAPTER VI.  KIT'S POOR PROSPECTS.   There was one of the spectators who did not admire Kit's heroic conduct, nor join in the applause which was so liberally showered upon him. This was Ralph Watson, who sat on the opposite side of the tent, with his chum, James Schuyler, a boy who had recently come to Smyrna from the city of New York. Ralph had been very pale when the lion first made his appearance in the arena, and trembled with fear, and no one had felt greater relief when the danger was past. But, being naturally of a jealous disposition, he was very much annoyed by the sudden popularity won by Kit.  \"Isn't that your cousin?\" asked James Schuyler.  \"Yes,\" answered Ralph shortly.  \"What a brave boy he is!\"  Ralph shrugged his shoulders.  \"I don't see much bravery about it,\" he said. \"It isn't as if the lion was a wild one in his native forest. This one was tame.\"  \"He didn't look very tame to me,\" rejoined James, who, though rather snobbish, was willing to admit the danger they had all incurred. \"The people didn't think so either. Hear them cheer your cousin.\"  \"It will make him terribly conceited. He will actually think he's a hero.\"  \"I wouldn't have given much for any of our lives if he hadn't jumped into the ring, and blinded the lion.\"  Meanwhile Kit was enjoying the performance, and thinking very little of how his action would be regarded by Ralph, for whom he had no very cordial feeling, though they had been, from the necessity of the case, close companions for many years.  On their return home, Kit and Ralph reached the gate together.  \"It seems you're a great hero all at once,\" said Ralph, with a sneer.  Kit understood the sneer, but did not choose to notice it.  \"Thank you for the compliment,\" he responded quietly.  \"O, I didn't mean to flatter you! You are puffed up enough.\"  \"Are you sorry I jumped into the ring, Ralph?\" asked Kit good-naturedly.  \"I don't believe there was any real danger.\"  \"Then I must congratulate you upon your courage. All the rest of us were frightened, and even Mr. Barlow admitted that there was danger.\"  \"The lion was half tame. It isn't as if he were wild.\"  \"He looked wild enough to me when I faced him in the ring. I confess that my knees began to tremble, and I wished myself at home.\"  \"You'd better set up as a lion tamer,\" said Ralph.  \"Thank you; I think I should prefer some other business, where my life would be safer.\"  \"You are likely to have your wish, then.\"  \"What do you mean?\" asked Kit quickly, detecting a significance in Ralph's tone.  \"I mean that father intends to have you learn a trade.\"  \"Has he told you so?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Doesn't he propose to consult me?\"  \"Why should he? You are only a boy, and can't judge what is best for yourself.\"  \"Still I am likely to be more interested than any one else in the way I am to earn my living. What trade are _you_ going to "]]]
