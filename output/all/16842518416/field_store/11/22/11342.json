However, he answered in the negative.  \"Am I as homely as a hedge-fence?\" pursued the widow.  \"Has anybody been calling you so? If so, tell me who it is.\"  \"Never you mind, stranger. Am I old and wrinkled?\"  \"Certainly she's out of her mind,\" thought Miles. \"I must humor her.\"  \"I think you are a very good-looking woman,\" he said, soothingly.  \"No, I'm not,\" said the strong-minded lady, \"but at the same time I ain't a scarecrow.\"  \"Certainly not.\"  \"Don't talk too much, stranger. I expect you're surprised at my questions, but I'll come to the p'int at once. I'm tired of livin' here alone. I didn't think I'd miss Brown so much. He wasn't any great shakes of a man, but he was better than nothing. He was company for me, Brown was, in the long evenin's, and I miss him. I've made up my mind to take on somebody in his place, and I reckon I'd like to engage you, stranger. Will you marry me?\"  Mrs. Brown did not blush when she asked this extraordinary question. She was entirely self-possessed, and could not have been cooler, if she had been transacting an ordinary piece of business.  John Miles had never before received a proposal of marriage. He felt as awkward and confused as a young girl, and began to hesitate and stammer.  \"Really, Mrs. Brown,\" he began, \"you have taken me by surprise.\"  \"I expect I have,\" said the widow, \"but I'll give you time to think it over. Brown left me I pretty comfortable, though I did more to get the property together than he. You wouldn't think it, perhaps, but I've got five thousand dollars in gold hid away somewheres near, and there's a claim not far away, that belongs to me, and will pay for workin'.\"  \"I am glad you are so well off, Mrs. Brown,\" said Miles.  \"If you marry me,\" continued the widow, \"you can work that claim. You're a strong, able-bodied man, and a year from now, if you want to, we'll go to the city, and settle down. I'm older than you; but a matter of a few years don't make much difference. You were robbed, you told me?\"  \"Yes, of all that I had.\"  \"How much was it?\"  \"About two hundred dollars.\"  \"That ain't much.\"  \"It's a good deal when it's all you have,\" answered Miles.  \"If you marry me you won't miss it,\" said Mrs. Brown. \"I won't give you my money right off, for you might run off with it, but at the end of the first year you shall have half of it. There's a parson a few miles up the caéš³n, at Dirt Hole, that will marry us any time we ride over. What do you say, stranger?\"  It was an embarrassing moment for John Miles. He had no desire to succeed the deceased Brown, notwithstanding the little property he had left behind him. Mrs. Brown did not in the least resemble the wife of whom he had sometimes dreamed. But how could he decline without exciting the resentment of that singular female? He bore in mind that Mrs. Brown carried a revolver, and she might take a notion to shoot him down. He must temporize.  \"Your proposal is a very kind and flattering one, Mrs. Brown, but I don't care to marry just at present. I want to go to the city and try my fortune. I've only lately arrived in California, and I am not ready to settle down yet.\"  To his relief Mrs. Brown accepted his objection in good part.  \"No offence, stranger,\" she said. \"I didn't know how you might feel about it. I've made you a fair offer.\"  \"Indeed you have. The time may come when I shall return, and--\"  \"I won't promise to wait for you, stranger. Somebody else may happen along that'll take the situation.\"  \"It would be too much to expect you to wait for me, I admit.\"  \"All right, stranger. You've answered fair, and now we'll let the matter drop.\"  When Miles left the cabin he carried with him an addition to his stock of provisions, for which he was indebted to Mrs. Brown's liberality. It was evident that she bore no malice, notwithstanding her suit had been rejected.     CHAPTER XI.  BILL CRANE'S GOOD LUCK.   About an hour after John Miles rode away from the widow's door Mr. William Crane came in sight of the cabin. He had strayed from the direct course, and that had delayed him. Otherwise he would not have fallen behind Miles.  Bill Crane was in rather a melancholy mood. He had not got over his disappointment of the morning. He was fagged out and hungry, and felt that luck was against him. When he saw the cabin, and the widow Brown sitting in the door-way, it instantly occurred to him that here was a chance to get a dinner. He had nothing to pay, to be sure, but he need say nothing about it till after the dinner was eaten.  As he rode up, he removed his hat, and said, \"Good-day, ma'am.\"  Mrs. Brown scrutinized the new-comer with critical eyes. She decided that he was not as good-looking as John Miles. Indeed Bill Crane never could have been accounted handsome; but on this point the widow was not exacting. She was looking for somebody to fill the place of her lamented Brown, and relieve her loneliness, and it was Crane's eligibility in this respect that she was considering. Beauty was but skin deep, as Mrs. Brown was practical enough to admit, and she was not overstocked with that attractive quality herself. Though Crane did not know it, the resolute, middle-aged female, from whom he hoped to obtain a gratuitous dinner, was making up her mind to offer him the position of husband.  \"Good-day, stranger,\" she answered composedly. \"Are you travelin' fur?\"  \"I'm thinkin' of goin' to Frisco,\" he said, \"but it's a long journey and I'm fagged out. If you have no objection, I'll stop at your place and see if I can rest a few minutes.\"  \"You can stop if you want to,\" she said. \"I don't see much company, and I like to see a new face now and then.\"  \"So do I,\" said Crane, thinking a little flattery might help him; \"especially when it's the face of a good-looking woman.\"  \"I ain't good-lookin' enough to hurt me,\" returned Mrs. Brown, with a frankness which rather disconcerted and puzzled Crane, \"but I don't mind you callin' me so. If you are anyways hungry, I haven't cleared away the dinner, and--\"  \"You are very kind,\" broke in Crane, eagerly; \"I don't mind saying I am a little bit hungry.\"  \"All right, stranger. If you'll wait long enough for me to make some hot tea, and warm the victuals, you shall have a chance to judge of my cookin'.\"  Bill Crane was quite elated. He decided that the widow would not ask him for payment, thus saving him from embarrassing excuses. In due time he was called in and seated in the chair not long since occupied by John Miles.  \"You're the second man that's dined with me to-day,\" said the widow.  \"And who was the first lucky man?\" inquired Crane, suspecting at once that it might have been Miles.  \"I don't know his name, but he was a good-looking young man, who said he had had a bag of gold-dust stolen from him.\"  \"That's Miles,\" thought Crane; and he at once decided not to betray any knowledge of him.  \"He was in bad luck,\" said Bill. \"Did he know who stole it?\"  \"He didn't tell me. I don't think he knew.\"  \"That's well,\" thought Crane.  \"Did he say where he was going?\"  \"To the city.\"  \"Do you live here all the year round, Mrs.----?\"  \"My name's Brown, stranger.\"  \"All I can say is, that Brown is a lucky man. Another cup of tea if you please, Mrs. Brown.\"  \"You might not like to exchange places with him, for all his luck, stranger,\" remarked the widow.  \"Indeed I would,\" said Bill, with a languishing look.  \"He's six feet under ground!\" explained Mrs. Brown, dryly.  \"Dead?\" ejaculated Crane.  \"Yes; he's been dead these three weeks.\"  \"And you are a widow?\"  \"That's so, stranger.\"  \"But you don't mean to stay a widow?\" interrogated Crane.  \"Well, it is kinder lonesome. It seems natural like to have a man round.\"  \"I wonder if she's got any money,\" thought Crane. \"I'll find out if I can.\"  \"Yes, Mrs. Brown, I feel for you,\" he said. \"A woman can't struggle with the world as a man can.\"  \"I don't know about that, stranger. I can take care of myself, if that's what you mean.\"  \"But a woman needs a man to protect and work for her,\" insinuated Crane.  \"I don't need any one to protect me,\" said the widow; \"and, as for support, I've got a matter of five thousand dollars laid by, and a good claim that'll pay for the workin'. I don't think I shall need to go to the poor-house yet awhile.\"  Bill Crane's eyes sparkled. The widow Brown seemed wonderfully attractive in his eyes. He was willing to barter his young affections for five thousand dollars and a claim, even if the widow had been thrice as homely as she was. If he had known that Mrs. Brown was bent on marriage his way would have been clearer. His mind was made up. He would woo and win his fair hostess if he could.  \"When did Brown die?\" he inquired.  \"Three weeks ago, stranger.\"  \"You must miss him.\"  \"Yes, he was a quiet man, Brown was. He never gave me any trouble, and it was natural to see him round.\"  \"You must not mourn for him too much, Mrs. Brown.\"  \"I shan't make a fool of myself,\" said the widow. \"He's gone, and he won't come back. There's no use cryin'.\"  \"She's rather a queer specimen,\" thought Crane. \"She hasn't broken her heart, it seems.\"  \"You ought to marry again,\" he said.  \"I mean to,\" said Mrs. Brown.  \"Well, that's frank,\" thought Crane. \"There ain't any nonsense about her.\"  \"Your second husband will be a lucky man, Mrs. Brown.\"  \"Well, he'll have a good livin', and, if he treats me right, he'll get treated right too.\"  \"This is a cold world, Mrs. Brown. I've been drifting about till I'm tired. I'd like to settle down with a good wife.\"  \"If you want to take Brown's place, say so,\" remarked the widow, in a business-like tone.  Bill Crane was staggered by the promptness with which his hint was taken, but did not hesitate to follow it up.  \"That's what I mean,\" he said.  \"What's your name, stranger?\"  \"William Crane.\"  \"You haven't got another wife anywhere, have you?\"  \"Of course not.\"  \"I've got to take your word for it, I s'pose. I guess I'll take the risk. I'll marry you if you say so.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22674"],["title","Boy Scouts on Hudson Bay; Or, The Disappearing Fleet (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: \"I see it, Ned!\" suddenly said Jack, triumphantly.

HARVEY RALPHSON  CHAPTER I.  THE FIVE CHUMS IN CAMP.   \"Sure it's me that hopes we've seen the last tough old carry on this same wild-goose chase up to the Frozen North!\"  \"Hello! there, is that you, Jimmy, letting out that yawp? I thought you had more sporting blood in you than to throw up your hands like that!\"  \"Oh! well I sometimes say things that don't come from the heart, you know, Jack. Wait, me boy, till I get good and rested up, and mebbe I'll sing a different tune. Ask Ned here if it's me that often shows the white flag when trouble comes.\"  \"Well, I should say not, Jimmy McGraw. There never was a more stubborn nature in all New York than you, once you'd set your mind on anything. That talk of being discouraged is all on the surface. A thousand cataracts wouldn't keep _you_ from getting to Hudson Bay in the end, if you'd said you meant to reach open water. And Jack Bosworth knows that as well as I do.\"  \"That's right; I do,\" laughed the party mentioned as Jack, as he slapped Jimmy on the back. \"I've seen him tested and tried out many the time, and never once did he squeal. I was only joking, Jimmy; you understand?\"  \"And sure that's what I was doing when I grunted about the carry. It was next door to a picnic down Coney Island way, and I don't care how many more times the lot of us have to pack canoes and duffle from one creek to another. But Francois here is after saying we're getting near the end of our long voyage, and Tamasjo, the red Injun, backs him up. So let's try and forget our troubles, and settle down for a decent night's rest.\"  \"First of all, we'll get the tent up, because it looks a little like it might rain before morning,\" remarked the boy who had been designated as Ned, and whom the other four seemed to look upon in the light of leader.  All of them were garbed in the familiar khaki of the Boy Scouts, and from their actions it would seem as though long familiarity with outdoor life had made this thing of pitching camp second nature with every one of the five well-grown lads.  These boys with their guides were a long way from home. Hundreds upon hundreds of miles separated them from the great metropolis of New York City, where the troop to which they belonged had its headquarters.  Those readers who have had the pleasure of meeting the five husky scouts in the pages of previous volumes of this series will not need any introduction to them. But for the sake of those who are not as yet acquainted with the chums, a few words of explanation may not come in amiss.  They all belonged to the same lively troop, but Ned Nestor and his shadow, Jimmy McGraw, were members of the Wolf Patrol, while Jack Bosworth, Frank Shaw and Teddy Green belonged to the patrol that proudly pointed to the head of an American black bear as its totem.  Ned Nestor had long been secretly in the employ of the United States Government, and had won considerable renown in carrying to a successful conclusion several difficult cases entrusted to his charge by the authorities in command of the Secret Service.  Jimmy, who had once been a typical Bowery newsboy, but now \"reformed,\" fairly worshiped Jack, and had been his faithful henchman for a long time past. He was witty, brave, and as as true as the needle to the pole.  Then there was Frank Shaw, whose father owned and edited one of the great daily papers in New York; he had long ago shown a desire to be a correspondent, and was always on the lookout for chances to visit far-off corners of the world which did not happen to be well known, and about which he might write interesting accounts for the columns of his father's paper. He was a great admirer of the celebrated Frank Carpenter, whom he had met many times in his father's office.  Jack Bosworth's father was a wealthy corporation lawyer and a capitalist as well, always ready to invest in promising schemes of a legitimate character. And it was really because of this venturesome nature of Mr. Bosworth that these five lads had undertaken this tremendous journey, away above the outskirts of Canadian civilization, many weary leagues beyond the northern limits of Lake Superior, and with the almost unknown shores of the great Hudson Bay as their objective point.  The last boy was Teddy Green. He had a well-known Harvard professor as his father, and some day no doubt the lad anticipated following in the footsteps of his parent. Just now his greatest ambition was to be an explorer and endure some of the privations which such men as Stanley, Livingstone, Dr. Kane and other renowned characters in history were said to have met with in carrying out their tasks.  From the desolate character of their present surroundings it would seem that Teddy was in a fair way to realize his boyish dream. For days now they had not met with a living human being, even an Indian trapper far away from his tepee in search of game. Mountains and valleys, plains covered with scrub trees and seemingly endless bogs, and stretches of moss-covered land surrounded them day after day.  They had ascended one river until they could paddle their three canoes no further. At this point had come the first carry to another stream, and from that day on it had been the hardest kind of work as time passed on.  Already Jimmy had lost all track of direction, and often declared that it would not surprise him if they finally turned up somewhere over in Siberia, for to his mind it seemed as though they had come far enough to have passed the North Pole, even though they had seen no ice packs.  The taciturn Indian guide, who went under the name of Tamasjo, and the dusky voyageur, a French Canadian named Francois, assured them that all was well, whenever one of the boys ventured to voice a suspicion that they might have lost their way and wandered far past their objective point.  Both guides claimed to have hunted all over this country in times past, and the voyageur had even accompanied a noted explorer on a summer wandering up here. Hence their confidence reassured Ned, who often consulted a rude chart which had been placed in his hands before starting out on this journey, and thus verified the statements made by Francois.  Much paddling through rushing rapids and against the current of boisterous rivers had made the muscles of the boys' arms seem like iron. Every one of them appeared to be the picture of good health; because there is absolutely nothing equal to this outdoor life to build up sturdy constitutions.  Already all of them were at work. The tents went up so rapidly that it was plain to be seen these lads would easily take the prize offered for perfection in camp making, in a contest between rival patrols.  The canoes had been safely drawn up on the shelving beach, and doubly secured; because it would be nothing short of a calamity to lose one of the handy vessels while so far from civilization, and with no suitable birch trees around from which another light boat might be fashioned by the craft of the guides.  The day was nearly done, and when presently the smoke of their campfire began to ascend in the still air, night crept slowly about them. As it was the summer season and the days were very long up here in the Far North, the hour was later than they had ever started in to make camp before.  Plenty of supplies had apparently been carried along, to judge from the fragrant odors that soon began to steal forth. All of these lads belonged to families of wealth, so that at no time were they reduced to limiting their outfit. Anything that money could buy, and which prudence would allow to carry with them, was always at their service.  So the guns owned by Ned and his chums were of the latest pattern, and capable of doing good service when properly handled. The boys, who had been through campaigns in many parts of"]]]
