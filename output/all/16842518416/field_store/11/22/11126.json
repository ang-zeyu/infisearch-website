I shall be a merchant or a professional man.\"  \"And why should not I be the same?\" asked Kit.  \"Because you're a poor boy. Didn't my father tell you this afternoon that you had no money coming to you?\"  \"Yes; but that needn't prevent me from becoming a merchant, or studying a profession.\"  \"So _you_ think. You can't expect my father to pay for sending you to college, or support you while you are qualifying yourself to be a merchant.\"  \"I don't know yet what I am entitled to expect.\"  \"You will soon know.\"  \"How soon?\"  \"To-morrow. There's a blacksmith in the next town, Aaron Bickford, who has agreed to take you as an apprentice.\"  \"So it's all settled, is it?\" Kit asked, full of indignation.  \"Yes, if Mr. Bickford likes your appearance. He's coming to Smyrna on business to-morrow, and will call here. You're to live at his house.\"  \"Indeed! I am very much obliged for the information.\"  \"Oh, you needn't get grouty about it. I've no doubt you'll have enough to eat.\"  \"So I am to be a blacksmith, and you a merchant or----\"  \"Lawyer. I think I shall decide to be a lawyer,\" said Ralph, complacently.  \"That will make quite a difference in our social positions.\"  \"Of course; but I will help you all I can. If you have a shop of your own, I will have my horses shod at your place.\"  \"Does your father think I am particularly well fitted to be a blacksmith?\"  \"He thinks you will get along very well in the business, if you are industrious. A poor boy can't choose. He must take the best he can get.\"  Kit did not sleep very much that night. He was full of anger and indignation with his uncle. Why should his future be so different from his cousin's? At school he had distinguished himself more in his studies, and he did not see why he was not as well fitted to become a merchant or a lawyer as Ralph.  \"They can't make me a blacksmith without my consent,\" was his final thought, as he closed his eyes and went to sleep.  Kit was up early the next morning. As breakfast was not ready, he strolled over to the hotel, which was only five minutes' walk from his uncle's house.  The circus tent had vanished. Late at night, after the evening performance was over, the canvas men had busied themselves in taking them down, and packing them for transportation to a town ten miles distant on the railroad, where they were to give two exhibitions the next day. The showy chariots, the lions, tigers, elephants and camels, with all the performers, were gone. But Mr. Barlow, the owner of the circus, had remained at the Smyrna Hotel all night, preferring to journey comfortably the next morning.  He was sitting on the piazza when Kit passed. Though he had never seen Kit but once, his business made him observant of faces, and he recognized him immediately.  \"Aha!\" he said, \"this is the young hero of last evening, is it not?\"  Kit smiled.  \"I am the boy who jumped into the ring,\" he said.  \"So I thought. I hope you slept well after the excitement.\"  A sudden thought came to Kit. Mr. Barlow looked like a kind hearted man, and he had already shown that he was well disposed toward him.  \"I slept very poorly,\" he said.  \"Was it the thought of the danger you had been in?\"  \"No, sir; I learned that my uncle, without consulting me, had arranged to apprentice me to a blacksmith.\"  Mr. Barlow looked surprised.  \"But you look like a boy of independent means,\" he said, puzzled.  \"I have always supposed that this was the case,\" said Kit, \"but my uncle told me yesterday, to my surprise, that I was dependent upon him, and had no expectations.\"  \"You don't want to be a blacksmith?\"  \"No, sir; I consider any kind of work honorable, but that would not suit me.\"  \"You would succeed well in my business,\" said the showman, \"but I am very careful how I recommend it to boys. It isn't a good school for them. They are exposed to many temptations in it. But if a boy has a strong will, and good principles, he may avoid all the evils connected with it.\"  Kit had not thought of it before, but now the question suggested itself: \"Why should I not join the circus. I should like it better than being a blacksmith.\"  \"How much do you pay acrobats?\" he asked.  \"Are you an acrobat?\" asked Mr. Barlow.  Kit told the story of his practicing with the Vincenti Brothers.  \"Good!\" said Mr. Barlow. \"If they indorse you, it is sufficient. If you decide to join my company, I will give you, to begin with, ten dollars a week and your expenses.\"  \"Thank you, sir,\" said Kit, dazzled by the offer, \"Where will you be on Saturday?\"  \"At Grafton on Saturday, and Milltown on Monday.\"  \"If I decide to join you, I will do so at one or the other of those places.\"  Here the railroad omnibus came up, and Mr. Barlow entered it, for he was to leave by the next train.     CHAPTER VII.  AARON BICKFORD, THE BLACKSMITH.   Kit returned to breakfast in good spirits. He saw a way out of his difficulties. Though he had no false pride, he felt that a blacksmith's life would be distasteful to him. He was fond of study, and had looked forward to a college course. Now this was out of the question. It seemed that he was as poor as his friend, Dan Clark, with his own way to make in the world. When he left school, at the beginning of the vacation, he supposed that he would inherit a competence. It was certainly a great change in his prospects, but now he did not feel dispirited. He thought, upon the whole, he would enjoy traveling with the circus. His duties would be light, and the pay liberal.  Before he returned to breakfast, Ralph had come down-stairs, and had a few words with his father.  \"I think you are going to have trouble with Kit, father,\" he commenced.  \"What makes you think so, and what about?\" asked Mr. Watson.  \"I told him last evening about your plan of apprenticing him to Mr. Bickford.\"  \"You did wrong. I did not propose to mention the matter to him till Mr. Bickford's arrival. What did he say?\"  \"He turned up his nose at the idea. He thinks he ought to become a merchant or a professional man like me. He is too proud to be a blacksmith.\"  \"Then he must put his pride in his pocket. It will be all I can do to pay the expenses of your education. I can't provide for two boys.\"  \"When Kit is off your hands won't you increase my allowance, father?\" asked Ralph, insinuatingly.  \"Suppose we postpone that matter,\" replied Mr. Watson, in a tone of voice that was not encouraging. \"I have lost some money lately, and I can't do anything more for you just at present.\"  Ralph looked disappointed, but did not venture to press the subject.  \"Where have you been, Kit?\" he asked, as he saw his cousin entering the gate, and coming up the path to the front door.  \"I have been taking a walk,\" answered Kit, cheerfully.  \"It's a good idea to rise early.\"  \"Why?\"  \"Because you will probably be required to do so in your new place.\"  \"What new place?\"  \"At the blacksmith's.\"  Kit smiled. To Ralph's surprise he did not appear to be annoyed.  \"I see you are getting reconciled to the idea. Last evening you seemed to dislike it.\"  \"Your father has not said anything about it to me.\"  \"He will very soon.\"  \"Won't you come round and see me occasionally, Ralph?\" asked Kit, with a curious smile.  \"Yes; I may call on Saturday. I should like to see how you look.\"  Kit smiled again. He thought it extremely doubtful whether Ralph would see him at the blacksmith's forge.  Half an hour after breakfast, while Ralph and Kit were in the stable, the sound of wheels was heard, and a stout, broad-shouldered man, with a bronzed complexion, drove up in a farm wagon. Throwing his reins over the horse's neck, he descended from the wagon, and turned in at the gate. Mr. Watson, who had been sitting at the front window, opened the door for him.  \"Glad to see you, Mr. Bickford,\" he said.  \"Is the boy ready?\" asked the blacksmith. \"I can take him right over with me this morning.\"  \"Come into the house, I will send for him.\"  Mr. Bickford noticed the handsome appearance of the hall, and the front room, the door of which was partly open, and said: \"If the boy's been used to livin' here, he must be kind of high strung. I can't give him no such home as this.\"  \"Of course not, Mr. Bickford. He can't expect it. He's a poor boy, and will have to make his own way in the world. Beggars can't be choosers, you know.\"  A servant was sent to the stable to summon Kit. Ralph, who thought he should enjoy the scene, accompanied him.  Kit regarded the blacksmith with some curiosity.  \"This is Mr. Aaron Bickford, of Oakford, Kit,\" began his uncle.  \"I hope you are well, Mr. Bickford,\" said Kit, politely.  The blacksmith gazed at Kit with earnest scrutiny.  \"Humph!\" said he; \"are you strong and muscular?\"  \"Pretty fair,\" answered Kit, with a smile.  \"Kit,\" said his uncle, clearing his throat, \"in your circumstances I have thought it desirable that you should learn a trade, and have spoken to Mr. Bickford about taking you as an apprentice.\"  \"In what business?\" asked Kit.  \"I'm a blacksmith,\" said Mr. Bickford, taking it upon himself to reply, \"and it's a good, healthy business as any you'd want to follow.\"  \"I have no doubt of it,\" said Kit, quietly, \"but I don't think I should like it all the same. Uncle Stephen, how does it happen that you have selected such a business for me?\"  \"I heard that Mr. Bickford needed an apprentice, and I have arranged matters with him to take you, and teach you his trade.\"  \"Yes,\" put in Mr. Bickford, \"I've agreed to give you your board and a dollar a week the first year. That's more than I got when I was 'prentice. My old master only paid me fifty cents a week.\"  Kit turned to his uncle.  \"Do you think my education has fitted me for a blacksmith's trade?\" he asked.  \"It won't interfere,\" replied Mr. Watson, a little uneasily.  \"Wouldn't it have been well to consult me in the matter? It seems to me I am rather interested.\"  \"Oh, I supposed you"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22521"],["title","The Young Acrobat of the Great North American Circus (#5)"],["body","object, as you had been looking forward to being a gentleman, but I can't afford to keep you in idleness any longer, and so have arranged matters with Mr. Bickford.\"  \"Suppose I object to going with him?\" said Kit, calmly.  \"Then I shall overrule your objections, and compel you to do what I think is for your good.\"  Kit's eye flashed with transient anger, but as he had no idea of acceding to his uncle's order, he did not allow himself to become unduly excited. Indeed he had a plan, which made temporary submission a matter of policy.  \"What's the boy's name?\" asked Aaron Bickford.  \"I am generally called Kit. My right name is Christopher.\"  \"Then, Kit, you'd better be getting your traps together, for I can't stop long away from the shop.\"  \"I have arranged to have you go back with Mr. Bickford to-day,\" said Stephen Watson.  \"That's rather short notice, isn't it?\" Kit rejoined.  \"The sooner the matter is arranged, the better!\" answered his uncle.  \"Very well,\" said Kit, with unexpected submission. \"I'll go and pack up my clothes.\"  Mr. Watson looked relieved. He had expected to have more trouble with his nephew.  In twenty minutes Kit reappeared with his school valise. He had packed up a supply of shirts, socks, handkerchiefs, and underclothing.  \"I am all ready,\" he said.  \"Then we'll be going,\" said the blacksmith, rising with alacrity.  Kit took his place on the seat beside Mr. Bickford.  \"Good-by, uncle!\" he said; \"it may be some time before we meet again.\"  \"What does the boy mean?\" asked Stephen Watson, turning to Ralph with a puzzled look.  \"I don't know. He's been acting queer all the morning.\"  So Kit rode away with Aaron Bickford, but he had not the slightest intention of becoming blacksmith. Instead of blacksmith's forges, visions of a circus ring and acrobatic feats were dancing before his mind.     CHAPTER VIII.  KIT'S RIDE TO OAKFORD.   Oakford was six miles away. The blacksmith's horse was seventeen years old, and did not make very good speed. Kit was unusually busy thinking. He had taken a decisive step; he had, in fact, made up his mind to enter upon a new life. He had not objected to going away with the blacksmith, because it gave him an excuse for packing up his clothes, and leaving the house quietly.  It may be objected that he had deceived Mr. Bickford. This was true, and the thought of it troubled him, but he hardly knew how to explain matters.  Not much conversation took place till they were within a mile of Oakford. Aaron Bickford had filled his pipe at the beginning of the journey, and he had smoked steadily ever since. At last he removed his pipe from his mouth, and put it in his pocket.  \"Were you ever in Oakford?\" he asked.  \"Yes,\" answered Kit. \"I know the place very well.\"  \"How do you think you'll like livin' there?\"  \"I don't think I shall like it.\"  Mr. Bickford looked surprised.  \"I'll keep you at work so stiddy you won't mind where you are,\" he remarked dryly.  \"Not if I know it,\" Kit said to himself.  He knew Mr. Bickford by reputation. He was a close-fisted, miserly man, who was not likely to be a very desirable employer, for he expected every one who worked for him to labor as hard as himself. Moreover, he and his wife lived in a very stingy manner, and few of the luxuries of the season appeared on their table. The fact that complaints upon this score had been made by some of Kit's predecessors in his employ, led Mr. Bickford to make inquiries with a view to ascertaining whether Kit was particular about his food.  \"Are you partic'lar about your vittles?\" he asked abruptly.  \"I have been accustomed to good food,\" answered Kit.  \"You can't expect to live as you have at your uncle's,\" continued the blacksmith. \"Me and my wife have enough to eat, but we think it best to eat plain food. Some of my help have had stuck up notions, and expected first class hotel fare, but they didn't get it at my house.\"  \"I believe you,\" said Kit.  Mr. Bickford eyed him sharply, not being sure but this might be a sarcastic observation, but Kit's face was straight, and betrayed nothing.  \"You'll live as well as I do myself,\" he proceeded, after a pause. \"I don't pamper my appetite by no means.\"  Kit was quite ready to believe this also, but did not say so.  \"What time did you get up at your uncle's?\" asked the blacksmith.  \"We have breakfast a little before eight. I get up in time for breakfast.\"  \"You do, hey?\" ejaculated the blacksmith, scornfully. \"Wa'al, I declare! You must be tuckered out gettin' up so airly.\"  \"O no, I stand it very well, Mr. Bickford,\" said Kit, amused.  \"Do you know what time I get up?\" asked Mr. Bickford, with a touch of indignation in his tone.  \"I would like to know,\" answered Kit meekly.  \"Wa'al, I get up at five o'clock. What do you say to that, hey?\"  \"I think it is very early.\"  \"I suppose you couldn't get up so early as that?\"  \"I might, if there was any need of it.\"  \"I reckon there will be need of it if you're goin' to work for me.\"  Kit cleared his throat. He felt that the time had come for an explanation.  \"Mr. Bickford,\" he said, \"I owe you an apology.\"  \"What?\" said Bickford, regarding his young companion in surprise.  \"I have deceived you.\"  \"I don't know what you're talkin' about.\"  \"I don't think I did right to come with you to day.\"  \"I can't make out what you're talkin' about. Your uncle has engaged to let you work for me.\"  \"But I haven't engaged to work for you, Mr. Bickford.\"  \"Hey?\" and the blacksmith eyed our hero in undisguised amazement.  \"I may as well say that I don't intend to work for you.\"  \"You don't mean to work for me?\" repeated Bickford slowly.  \"Just so. I have no intention of becoming a blacksmith.\"  \"Is the boy crazy?\" ejaculated Aaron Bickford.  \"No, Mr. Bickford; I have full command of my senses. You will have to look out for another apprentice.\"  \"Then why did you agree to come with me?\"  \"That is what I have to apologize for. I wanted to get away from my uncle's house quietly, and I thought it the best way to pretend to agree to his plan.\"  Aaron Bickford was not a sweet tempered man. He had a pretty strong will of his own, and was called, not without reason, obstinate. He began to feel angry.  \"Well, boy, have you got through with what you had to say?\" he asked.  \"I believe so--for the present.\"  \"Then I guess it's about time for me to say something.\"  \"Very well, sir.\"  \"You'll find me a tough customer to deal with, young man.\"  \"Then perhaps it is just as well that I do not propose to work for you.\"  \"But you are goin' to work for me!\" said the blacksmith, nodding his head.  \"Whether I want to or not?\" interrogated Kit, placidly.  \"Yes, whether you want to or not, willy nilly, as the lawyers say.\"  \"I think, Mr. Bickford, you will find that it takes two to make a bargain.\"  \"So it does, and there's two that's made this bargain, your uncle and me.\"  Mr. Bickford was not always strictly grammatical in his language, as the reader will observe.  \"I don't admit my uncle's right to make arrangements for me without my consent.\"  \"You know more'n he does, I reckon?\"  \"No, but this matter concerns me more than it does him.\"  \"Maybe you expect to live without workin'!\"  \"No; if it is true, as my uncle says, that I have no money, I shall have to make my living, but I prefer to choose my own way of doing it.\"  \"You're a queer boy. Bein' a blacksmith is too much work for you, I reckon.\"  \"At any rate it isn't the kind of work I care to undertake.\"  \"What's all this rigmarole comin' to? Here we are 'most at my house. If you ain't goin' to work for me, what are you goin' to do?\"  \"I should like to pass the night at your house, Mr. Bickford. After breakfast I will pay you for your accommodations, and go----\"  \"Where?\"  \"You must excuse my telling you that. I have formed some plans, but I do not care to have my uncle know them.\"  \"Are you going to work for anybody?\" asked the blacksmith, whose curiosity was aroused.  \"Yes, I have a place secured.\"  \"Is it on a farm?\"  \"No.\"  \"You're mighty mysterious, it seems to me. Now you've had your say, I've got something to tell you.\"  \"Very well, Mr. Bickford.\"  \"You say you're not goin' to work for me?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Then I say you _are_ goin' to work for me. I've got your uncle's authority to set you to work, and I'm goin' to do it.\"  Kit heard this calmly.  \"Suppose we postpone the discussion of the matter,\" he said. \"Is that your house?\"  Aaron Bickford's answer was to drive into the yard of a cottage. On the side opposite was a blacksmith's forge.  \"That's where you're goin' to work!\" he said, grimly, pointing to the forge.     CHAPTER IX.  KIT MAKES A NEW ACQUAINTANCE.   Grafton, where Barlow's circus was billed to appear on Saturday, was only six miles farther on. Oakford was about half way, so that in accompanying the blacksmith to his home, Kit had accomplished about half the necessary journey. Now that he had undeceived the blacksmith as to his intention of staying he felt at ease in his mind. It was his plan to remain over night in the house and pursue his journey early the next day.  \"Are these all the clo'es you brought with you?\" asked Bickford, surveying Kit's neat and rather expensive suit with disapproval.  \"Yes. Am I not well enough dressed for a blacksmith?\" asked Kit, with a smile.  \"You're a plaguy sight too well dressed,\" returned Bickford. \"You want a good rough suit, for the forge is a dirty place.\"  \"I thought I told you I did not intend to work for you, Mr. Bickford.\"  \"That's what you said, but I don't take no stock in it. Your uncle has bound you out to me, and that settles it.\"  \"If he has bound me out, where are the papers, Mr. Bickford?\" asked Kit, keenly.  This question was a poser. The blacksmith supposed that Kit might be ignorant that papers were required, but he found himself mistaken.  \"There ain't no papers, but that don't make no difference,\" he said. \"He says you're to work for me, and I'm goin' to hold you to it.\"  Kit did not reply, for he saw no advantage in"]]]
