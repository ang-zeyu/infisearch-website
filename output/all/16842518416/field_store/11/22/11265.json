Suspensive Conjunctions, e.g. \"either,\" \"not only,\" \"on the one hand,\" add clearness.*--Take the following sentence:--\"You must take this extremely perilous course, in which success is uncertain, and failure disgraceful, as well as ruinous, or else the liberty of your country is endangered.\" Here, the meaning is liable to be misunderstood, till the reader has gone half through the sentence. Write \"_Either_ you must,\" &c., and the reader is, from the first, prepared for an alternative. Other suspensive conjunctions or phrases are _partly_, _for our part_; _in the first place_; _it is true_; _doubtless_; _of course_; _though_; _on the one hand_.   *35. Repeat the Subject when the omission would cause ambiguity or obscurity.*--The omission is particularly likely to cause obscurity after a Relative standing as Subject:--  \"He professes to be helping the nation, which in reality is suffering from his flattery, and (he? or it?) will not permit anyone else to give it advice.\"  The Relative should be repeated when it is the Subject of several Verbs. \"All the pleasing illusions _which_ made power gentle and obedience liberal, _which_ harmonized the different shades of life, and _which_, by a bland assimilation, incorporated into politics the sentiments that beautify and soften private society, are to be dissolved by this new conquering empire of light and reason.\"   *36. Repeat a Preposition after an intervening Conjunction, especially if a Verb and an Object also intervene.*  \"He forgets the gratitude that he owes to those that helped all his companions when he was poor and uninfluential, and (_to_) John Smith in particular.\" Here, omit _to_, and the meaning may be \"that helped all his companions, and John Smith in particular.\" The intervention of the verb and object, \"helped\" and \"companions,\" causes this ambiguity.   *37. When there are several Verbs at some distance from a Conjunction on which they depend, repeat the Conjunction.*[14]  \"When we look back upon the havoc that two hundred years have made in the ranks of our national authors--and, above all, (_when_) we refer their rapid disappearance to the quick succession of new competitors--we cannot help being dismayed at the prospect that lies before the writers of the present day.\"  Here omit \"when,\" and we at once substitute a parenthetical statement for what is really a subordinate clause.  In reporting a speech or opinion, \"that\" must be continually repeated, to avoid the danger of confusing what the writer says with what others say.  \"We might say that the CÃ¦sars did not persecute the Christians; (_that_) they only punished men who were charged, rightly or wrongly, with burning Rome, and committing the foulest abominations in secret assemblies; and (_that_) the refusal to throw frankincense on the altar of Jupiter was not the crime, but only evidence of the crime.\" But see (6 _b_).  *37 a. Repeat Verbs after the conjunctions \"than,\" \"as,\" &c.*  \"I think he likes me better _than_ you;\" _i.e._ either \"than you like me,\" or \"he likes you.\"  \"Cardinal Richelieu hated Buckingham as sincerely as _did_ the Spaniard Olivares.\" Omit \"did,\" and you cause ambiguity.  *38. If the sentence is so long that it is difficult to keep the thread of meaning unbroken, repeat the subject, or some other emphatic word, or a summary of what has been said.*  \"Gold and cotton, banks and railways, crowded ports, and populous cities--_these_ are not the elements that constitute a great nation.\"  This repetition (though useful and, when used in moderation, not unpleasant) is more common with speakers than with writers, and with slovenly speakers than with good speakers.  \"The country is in such a condition, that if we delay longer some fair measure of reform, sufficient at least to satisfy the more moderate, and much more, if we refuse all reform whatsoever--I say, if _we adopt so unwise a policy, the country is in such a condition_ that we may precipitate a revolution.\"  Where the relative is either implied (in a participle) or repeated, the antecedent must often be repeated also. In the following sentence we have the Subject repeated not only in the final summary, but also as the antecedent:--  \"But if there were, in any part of the world, a national church regarded as heretical by four-fifths of the nation committed to its care; a _church_ established and maintained by the sword; a _church_ producing twice as many riots as conversions; a _church_ which, though possessing great wealth and power, and though long backed by persecuting laws, had, in the course of many generations, been found unable to propagate its doctrines, and barely able to maintain its ground; a _church_ so odious that fraud and violence, when used against its clear rights of property, were generally regarded as fair play; a _church_ whose ministers were preaching to desolate walls, and with difficulty obtaining their lawful subsistence by the help of bayonets,--_such a church_, on our principles, could not, we must own, be defended.\"   *39. It is a help to clearness, when the first part of the sentence prepares the way for the middle and the middle for the end, in a kind of ascent. This ascent is called \"climax.\"*  In the following there are two climaxes, each of which has three terms:--  \"To gossip(a) is a fault(b); to _libel_(a'), a _crime_(b'); to slander(a''), a _sin_(b'').\"  In the following, there are several climaxes, and note how they contribute to the clearness of a long sentence:--  \"Man, working, has _contrived_(a) the Atlantic Cable, but I declare that it _astonishes_(b) me far more to think _that for his mere amusement_(c), that to _entertain a mere idle hour_(c'), he has _created_(a') 'Othello' and 'Lear,' and I am more than astonished, I am _awe-struck_(b'), at that inexplicable elasticity of his nature which enables him, instead of _turning away_(d) from _calamity and grief_(e), or instead of merely _defying_(d') them, actually to _make them the material of his amusement_(d''), and to draw from the _wildest agonies of the human spirit_(e') a pleasure which is not only _not cruel_(f), but is in the highest degree _pure and ennobling_(f').\"  The neglect of climax produces an abruptness that interferes with the even flow of thought. Thus, if Pope, in his ironical address to mankind, had written--      \"Go, wondrous creature, mount where science guides;     Go, measure earth, weigh air, and state the tides;     Go, teach Eternal Wisdom how to rule\"--  the ascent would have been too rapid. The transition from earth to heaven, and from investigating to governing, is prepared by the intervening climax--      \"Instruct the planets in what orbs to run;     Correct old Time, and regulate the Sun;     Go, soar with Plato to th' empyreal sphere,     To the first good, first perfect, and first fair.\"   *40. When the thought is expected to ascend and yet descends, feebleness and sometimes confusion is the result. The descent is called \"bathos.\"*  \"What pen can describe the tears, the lamentations, the agonies, the _animated remonstrances_ of the unfortunate prisoners?\"  \"She was a woman of many accomplishments and virtues, graceful in her movements, winning in her address, a kind friend, a faithful and loving wife, a most affectionate mother, and she _played beautifully on the pianoforte_.\"  INTENTIONAL BATHOS has a humorous incongruity and abruptness that is sometimes forcible. For example, after the climax ending with the line--      \"Go, teach Eternal Wisdom how to rule,\"  Pope adds--      \"Then drop into thyself, and be a _fool_.\"  *40 a. A new construction should not be introduced without cause.*--A sudden and apparently unnecessary change of construction causes awkwardness and roughness at least, and sometimes breaks the flow of the sentence so seriously as to cause perplexity. Thus, write \"virtuous and accomplished,\" or \"of many virtues and accomplishments,\" not \"of many virtues and accomplished;\" \"riding or walking\" or \"on foot or horseback,\" not \"on foot or riding.\" In the same way, do not put adjectives and participles, active and passive forms of verbs, in too close juxtaposition. Avoid such sentences as the following:--  \"He had good reason _to believe_ that the delay was not _an accident_ (accidental) but _premeditated_, and _for supposing_ (to suppose, or else, for believing, above) that the fort, though strong both _by art_ and _naturally_ (nature), would be forced by the _treachery of the_ governor and the _indolent_ (indolence of the) general to capitulate within a week.\"  \"They accused him of being _bribed_ (receiving bribes from) by the king and _unwilling_ (neglecting) to take the city.\"   *41. Antithesis adds force, and often clearness.*--The meaning of _liberal_ in the following sentence is ascertained by the antithesis:--  \"All the pleasing illusions which made _power_(a) _gentle_(b) and _obedience_(a') _liberal_(b') ... are now to be destroyed.\"  There is a kind of proportion. As _gentleness_ is to _power_, so _liberality_ (in the sense here used) is to _obedience_. Now _gentleness_ is the check on the excess of power; therefore _liberal_ here applies to that which checks the excess of obedience, _i.e._ checks servility. Hence _liberal_ here means \"free.\"  The contrast also adds force. \"They aimed at the _rule_(a), not at the _destruction_(a'), of their country. They were men of great _civil_(b) and great _military_(b') talents, and, if the _terror_(c), the _ornament_(c') of their age.\"  Excessive antithesis is unnatural and wearisome:--  \"Who can persuade where _treason_(a) is above _reason_(a'), and _might_(b"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22600"],["title","How to Write Clearly: Rules and Exercises on English Composition (#7)"],["body",") ruleth _right_(b'), and it is had for _lawful_(c) whatsoever is _lustful_(c'), and _commotioners_(d) are better than _commissioners_(d'), and _common woe_(e) is named common _wealth_(e')?\"  *42. Epigram.*--It has been seen that the neglect of climax results in lameness. Sometimes the suddenness of the descent produces amusement: and when the descent is intentional and very sudden, the effect is striking as well as amusing. Thus:--  (1) \"You are not only not vicious, you are virtuous,\" is a _climax_.  (2) \"You are not vicious, you are vice,\" is not _climax_, nor is it _bathos_: it is _epigram_.[15]  Epigram may be defined as a \"short sentence expressing truth under an amusing appearance of incongruity.\" It is often antithetical.    \"The Russian grandees came to { and diamonds,\" _climax_.      court dropping pearls      { and vermin,\" _epigram_.    \"These two nations were divided  { and the bitter remembrance      by mutual fear                { of recent losses,\" _climax_.                                    { and mountains,\" _epigram_.  There is a sort of implied antithesis in:--  \"He is full of information--(but flat also) like yesterday's _Times_.\"  \"Verbosity is cured (not by a small, but) by a large vocabulary.\"  The name of epigram may sometimes be given to a mere antithesis; _e.g._ \"An educated man should know something of everything, and everything of something.\"   *43. Let each sentence have one, and only one, principal subject of thought.*  \"This great and good man died on the 17th of September, 1683, leaving behind him the memory of many noble actions, and a numerous family, of whom three were sons; one of them, George, the eldest, heir to his father's virtues, as well as to his principal estates in Cumberland, where most of his father's property was situate, and shortly afterwards elected member for the county, which had for several generations returned this family to serve in Parliament.\" Here we have (1) the \"great and good man,\" (2) \"George,\" (3) \"the county,\" disputing which is to be considered the principal subject. Two, if not three sentences should have been made, instead of one. Carefully avoid a long sentence like this, treating of many different subjects on one level. It is called _heterogeneous_.   *44. The connection between different sentences must be kept up by Adverbs used as Conjunctions, or by means of some other connecting words at the beginning of each sentence.*--Leave out the conjunctions and other connecting words, and it will be seen that the following sentences lose much of their meaning:--  \"Pitt was in the army for a few months in time of peace. His biographer (_accordingly_) insists on our confessing, that, if the young cornet had remained in the service, he would have been one of the ablest commanders that ever lived. (_But_) this is not all. Pitt (, _it seems_,) was not merely a great poet _in esse_ and a great general _in posse_, but a finished example of moral excellence.... (_The truth is, that_) there scarcely ever lived a person who had so little claim to this sort of praise as Pitt. He was (_undoubtedly_) a great man. (_But_) his was not a complete and well-proportioned greatness. The public life of Hampden or of Somers resembles a regular drama which can be criticised as a whole, and every scene of which is to be viewed in connection with the main action. The public life of Pitt (, _on the other hand_,) is,\" &c.  The following are some of the most common connecting adverbs, or connecting phrases: (1) expressing consequence, similarity, repetition, or resumption of a subject--_accordingly_, _therefore_, _then_, _naturally_, _so that_, _thus_, _in this way_, _again_, _once more_, _to resume_, _to continue_, _to sum up_, _in fact_, _upon this_; (2) expressing opposition--_nevertheless_, _in spite of this_, _yet_, _still_, _however_, _but_, _on the contrary_, _on the other hand_; (3) expressing suspension--_undoubtedly ... but_; _indeed ... yet_; _on the one hand ... on the other_; _partly ... partly_; _some ... others_.  Avoid a style like that of Bishop Burnet, which strings together a number of sentences with \"and\" or \"so,\" or with no conjunction at all:  \"Blake with the fleet happened to be at Malaga, before he made war upon Spain; _and_ some of his seamen went ashore, _and_ met the Host carried about; _and_ not only paid no respect to it, but laughed at those who did.\" Write \"_When_ Blake &c.\"   *45. The connection between two long sentences sometimes requires a short intervening sentence, showing the transition of thought.*  \"Without force or opposition, it (chivalry) subdued the fierceness of pride and power; it obliged sovereigns to submit to the soft collar[16] of social esteem, compelled stern authority to submit to elegance, and gave a dominating vanquisher of laws to be subdued by manners. But now (_all is to be changed_:) all the pleasing illusions which made power gentle and obedience liberal, which harmonized the different shades of life, and which, by a bland assimilation, incorporated into politics the sentiments that beautify and soften private society, are to be dissolved by this new conquering empire of light and reason.\" If the words italicized were omitted, the transition would be too abrupt: the conjunction _but_ alone would be insufficient.   FOOTNOTES:  [5] _For_, at the beginning of a sentence, sometimes causes temporary doubt, while the reader is finding out whether it is used as a conjunction or preposition.  [6] _It_ should refer (1) either to the Noun immediately preceding, or (2) to some Noun superior to all intervening Nouns in emphasis. See (25).  [7] So useful that, on mature consideration, I am disposed to adopt \"that\" here and in several of the following exceptional cases.  [8] Of course \"and which\" may be used where \"which\" precedes.  [9] \"That which,\" where _that_ is an _object_, _e.g._ \"then (set forth) _that which_ is worse,\" _St. John_ ii. 10, is rare in modern English.  [10] Sometimes the emphatic Adverb comes at the beginning, and causes the transposition of an Auxiliary Verb, \"_Gladly_ do I consent.\"  [11] Of course punctuation will remove the ambiguity; but it is better to express oneself clearly, as far as possible, independently of punctuation.  [12] Professor Bain.  [13] See (30).  [14] The repetition of Auxiliary Verbs and Pronominal Adjectives is also conducive to clearness.  [15] Professor Bain says: \"In the epigram the mind is roused by a conflict or contradiction between the form of the language and the meaning really conveyed.\"  [16] This metaphor is not recommended for imitation.          *       *       *       *       *   BREVITY.  *46. Metaphor is briefer than literal statement.* See (13).  \"The cares and responsibilities of a sovereign often disturb his sleep,\" is not so brief as \"Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown,\" where the effect of care on the mind is assimilated to the effect of a heavy crown pressing on the head.   *47. General terms are briefer, though less forcible, than particular terms.* Thus: \"He devours _literature_, no matter of what kind,\" is shorter than, \"Novels or sermons, poems or histories, no matter what, he devours them all.\"  *47 a. A phrase may be expressed by a word.*  \"These impressions _can never be forgotten_, i.e. are _indelible_.\"  \"The style of this book is _of such a nature that it cannot be understood_, i.e. _unintelligible_.\"  The words \"of such a nature that\" are often unnecessarily inserted. See the extract from Sir Archibald Alison.   *48. Participles can often be used as brief (though sometimes ambiguous) equivalents of phrases containing Conjunctions and Verbs.*  \"Hearing (when he heard) this, he advanced.\" See (7) for more instances. So \"phrases _containing_ conjunctions\" means \"phrases _that contain_ conjunctions.\" \"_This done_, (for, _when this was done_) he retired.\"  Sometimes the participle \"being\" is omitted. \"France at our doors, he sees no danger nigh,\" for \"France being\" or \"though France is.\"   *49. Participles and participial adjectives may be used like Adjectives, as equivalents for phrases containing the Relative.*  \"The never-_ceasing_ wind,\" \"the _clamouring_ ocean,\" \"the _drenching_ rain,\" are instances. The licence of inventing participial adjectives by adding _-ing_ to a noun, is almost restricted to poetry. You could not write \"the _crannying_ wind\" in prose.   *50. A statement may sometimes be briefly implied instead of being expressed at length.* Thus, instead of \"The spirit of Christianity was humanizing, and therefore &c.,\" or \"Christianity, since it was (or being) of a humanizing spirit, discouraged &c.,\" we can write more briefly and effectively, \"Gladiatorial shows were first discouraged, and finally put down, by the _humanizing spirit of Christianity_.\" So instead of \"The nature of youth is thoughtless and sanguine, and therefore &c.,\" we can write, \"The danger of the voyage was depreciated and the beauty of the island exaggerated by _the thoughtless nature of youth_.\"  Sometimes a mere name or epithet implies a statement. \"It was in vain that he offered the Swiss terms: war was deliberately preferred by the _hardy mountaineers_,\" _i.e._ \"by the Swiss, _because they were mountaineers and hardy_.\" \"The deed was applauded by all honest men, but the Government affected to treat it as murder, and set a price upon the head of (him whom they called) the _assassin.\" \"The conqueror of Austerlitz_ might be expected to hold different language from _the prisoner of St. Helena_,\" _i.e._ \"Napoleon when elated by the victory of Austerlitz,\" and \"Napoleon when depressed by his imprisonment at St. Helena.\"  CAUTION.--Different names must not be used for the same person unless each of them derives an appropriateness from its context. Thus, if we are writing about Charles II., it would be in very bad taste to avoid repeating \"he\" by using such periphrases as the following: \"The third of the Stewarts hated business,\" \"the Merry Monarch died in the fifty-fo"]]]
