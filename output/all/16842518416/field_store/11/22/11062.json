Like one in a daze the Count moved along with Gortchky. When sufficiently in the light, Surigny, with an expression of astonishment, found that he was the possessor of thirty twenty-franc notes.  \"I did not know that I had this!\" cried the Count. \"How did I come to overlook it?\"  \"It is but a trifle to a man of your fortune,\" cried M. Gortchky gayly.  \"It is all I have in the world!\" sighed the young man. \"And I am still amazed that I possess so much.\"  \"Poor?\" asked Gortchky, in a voice vibrating with sympathy. \"And you so young, and a gentleman of old family! Monsieur, it may be that this is a happy meeting. Perhaps I may be able to offer you the employment that befits a gentleman.\"  Then Gortchky lowered his voice, almost whispering:  \"For I am in the diplomatic service, and have need of just such an attach√© as you would make. Young, a gentleman, and of charming manners! Your intellect, too, I am sure, is one that would fit you for eminence in the diplomatic service.\"  \"The mere mention of the diplomatic service attracts me,\" confessed M. le Comte wistfully.  \"Then you shall have your fling at it!\" promised M. Gortchky. \"But enough of this. You shall talk it over with me to-morrow. Diplomacy, you know, is all gamble, and the gambler makes the best diplomat in the world. For to-night, Monsieur, you shall enjoy yourself! If I know anything of gaming fate, then you are due to reap a harvest of thousands with your few francs to-night. I can see it in your face that your luck is about to turn. An evening of calm, quiet play, Monsieur, and in the morning you and I will arrange for your entrance into the diplomatic world. _Faites votre jeux!_ (Make your wagers.) Wealth to-night, and a career to-morrow! Come! To the Casino!\"     CHAPTER V  DANNY GRIN FIGHTS A SMILE   Side by side Dave and Dan strolled through the vast main salon of the Casino.  Here at tables were groups of men and women. Each player hoped to quit the tables that night richer by thousands. Most of them were doomed to leave poorer, as chance is always in favor of the gambling institution and always against the player.  \"It's a mad scene,\" murmured Dan, in a low voice.  \"You are looking on now at an exhibition of what is probably the worst, and therefore the most dangerous, human vice,\" Dave replied. \"Bad as drunkenness is, gambling is worse.\"  \"What is at the bottom of the gambling mania?\" Dan asked thoughtfully.  \"Greed,\" Dave responded promptly. \"The desire to possess property, and to acquire it without working for it.\"  \"Some of these poor men and women look as if they were working hard indeed,\" muttered Dan, in almost a tone of sympathy.  \"They are not working so much as suffering,\" Dave rejoined. \"Study their faces, Danny boy. Can't you see greed sticking out all over these countenances? Look at the hectic flush in most of the faces. And--look at that man!\"  A short, stout man sprang up from a table, his face ghastly pale and distorted as though with terror. His eyes were wild and staring. He chattered incoherently as he hastened away with tottering steps. Then his hands gripped his hair, as though about to tear it from his head.  A few of the players in this international congress of greed glanced at the unfortunate man, who probably had just beggared himself, shrugged their shoulders, and turned their fascinated eyes back to the gambling table.  One woman, young and charming, reached up to her throat, unfastening and tossing on the table a costly diamond necklace and pendant.  \"Now,\" she laughed hysterically, \"I may go on playing for another hour.\"  The Casino's representative in charge at that table smiled and shook his head.  \"We accept only money, madame,\" he said, with a grave bow.  \"But I have no more money--with me,\" flashed back the young woman, her cheeks burning feverishly.  \"I regret, madame,\" insisted the Casino's man. Then an attendant, at a barely perceptible sign from the _croupier_, as the man in charge of the table is called, stepped up behind the young woman, bent over her and murmured:  \"If you care to leave the table for a few minutes, madame, there are those close at hand who will advance you money on your necklace.\"  The young woman pouted at first. In another instant there was a suppressed shout at the table. A player had just won four thousand francs.  \"I must have money!\" cried the young woman, springing from her chair. \"This is destined to be my lucky night, and I must have money!\"  As though he had been waiting for his prey, the attendant was quickly by the woman's side. Bowing, he offered his arm. The man, attendant though he was, was garbed in evening dress. Without a blush the woman moved away on this attendant's arm.  \"Shall we move on?\" asked Dan.  \"Not just yet,\" urged Darrin, in an undertone. \"I am interested in the further fate of that foolish young woman.\"  Within five minutes she had returned. Her former seat had been reserved for her; the young woman dropped into it.  \"You have enough money now?\" asked the woman at her left.  \"I have money,\" pouted the pretty young woman, \"but be warned by me. The pawnbrokers at Monte Carlo are robbers. The fellow would advance me only six thousand francs, whereas my husband paid a hundred thousand for that necklace.\"  A moment later the young woman was absorbed in the wild frenzy of play.  \"And that attendant undoubtedly gets a handsome commission from the pawnbroker,\" murmured Darrin in his chum's ear. \"Greed here is in the very air; none can escape it who lingers.\"  \"How much have you lost, Darrin?\" called a bantering voice in Dave's ear.  The speaker was Lieutenant Totten.  \"About as much, I imagine, as you have, sir,\" was Darrin's smiling answer.  \"Meaning that you now have as much money as when you entered the place?\" answered the lieutenant, banteringly.  \"Exactly,\" returned Darrin. \"I have only to study the faces here to know better than to risk even a franc-piece at one of these tables.\"  \"And you, Dalzell?\" inquired Totten.  \"I haven't any French money, anyway,\" grinned Dan.  \"Not at all necessary to have French money,\" laughed Totten. \"Any kind of real money is good here--as long as it lasts. Every nation on earth is represented here to-night, and the attendants know the current exchange rate for any kind of good money that is coined or printed. Look closely about you and you will see other things that are worth nothing. There are men here, some of them limping, others showing the pallor of illness, who are undoubtedly French, English or Italian officers, injured at the front and sent home to hospitals. Being still unfitted to return to their soldier duties at the front, they are passing time here and indulging in their mania for gambling. And here, too, you will see wealthy French, Italian, English or Russian civilians who have returned to Monte Carlo to gamble, though later on they are pretty certain to be held up to contempt at home for gambling money away here instead of buying government war bonds at home.\"  \"You have been here before?\" Dave asked.  \"Oh, yes,\" nodded Totten, \"and as I do not play, and would not do so in any circumstances, this place has not much interest for me.\"  \"I can hardly imagine,\" said Ensign Darrin, gravely, \"that I shall ever bother to pay a second visit here.\"  \"It's a good deal of a bore,\" yawned Lieutenant Totten, behind his hand. \"I am glad to note that most of the people here look like Europeans. I should hate to believe that many Americans could be foolish enough to come here.\"  At that moment a stout, red-faced man rose from a table near by, his voice booming as he laughed:  \"I have lost only sixteen thousand francs. I shall be sure to come back and have my revenge. In Chicago my signature is good at any time for a million dollars--for five million francs!\"  Many eyes, followed this speaker wistfully. With such wealth as his how many months of frenzied pleasure they might have at Monte Carlo!  \"One American idiot, at least,\" muttered Totten, in disgust. \"Or else he's a liar or braggart.\"  Madly the play went on, the faces of the players growing more flushed as the hour grew later.  Totten moved along with a bored air.  \"I guess he's going,\" said Dan. \"I don't blame him for being tired of the place. It's like a human menagerie.\"  \"We'll go, then,\" agreed Dave. \"Surely I have seen enough of the Casino. I shall never care to revisit it.\"  \"Ah, here you are, my dear fellows!\" exclaimed a musical voice. \"And the Countess Ripoli has asked me to present you to her. She is eager to know if you American officers are as wonderful as I have told her.\"  The speaker was Dandelli, a handsome, boyish-looking, frank-faced young Italian naval officer with whom Darrin and Dalzell had become acquainted at Gibraltar.  The Countess Ripoli, to whom Dandelli now presented the two young ensigns, was a woman in the full flower of her beauty at twenty-five or so. Tall, willowy, with a perfect air, her wonderful eyes, in which there was a touch of Moorish fire, were calculated to set a young man's heart to beating responses to her mood. Attired in the latest mode of Paris, and wearing only enough jewels to enhance her great beauty, the Countess chose to be most gracious to the young ensigns. Dave thought her a charming young woman; Dan Dalzell nearly lost his head.  From a distance Emil Gortchky looked on, a quiet smile gleaming in his eyes.  \"Dandelli is a fool, who will do any pretty woman's bidding,\" mused the spy. \"Madame Ripoli can play with him. Also I believe she will surely ensnare for me at least one of the Americans. Which, I wonder? But then why should I care which? The Ripoli knows how to manage such affairs far better than I do.\"  For the Countess was another of the many dangerous tools with which Mr. Green Hat plied his wicked trade.  If the Countess, as unscrupulous as Gortchky himself, could "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22431"],["title","Dave Darrin on Mediterranean Service; or, With Dan Dalzell on European Duty (#8)"],["body","either of these young officers with her fascinations, he was likely to be that much the weaker, and a readier prey for the trap that Emil Gortchky was arranging.  \"Dandelli,\" murmured the Countess sweetly, in French, \"you will wish, I know, to talk with your dear friend, Mr. Darrin, so I must look to Mr. Dalzell to offer me his arm.\"  Dan was ready, with a bow, to offer the Countess Ripoli his arm, and to escort her in the direction which she indicated.  It was to one of the verandas that the Countess led the way. As she chatted she laughed and looked up at Dan with her most engaging expression. There were other promenaders on the veranda, though not many, for the furious fascination of gambling tables kept nearly all the frequenters of the place inside.  \"You have played to-night?\" asked the Countess, again glancing sweetly up into the young naval officer's face.  \"Not to-night,\" Dan replied.  \"But you will doubtless play later?\" she insisted.  \"I haven't gambled to-night, nor shall I gamble on any other night,\" Dan replied pleasantly.  \"But why?\" demanded the Countess, looking puzzled.  \"Gambling does not fit in with my idea of honesty,\" replied Dalzell quite bluntly.     CHAPTER VI  DAVE RUNS INTO A REAL THRILL   \"I do not understand,\" murmured the Countess.  \"I know that the European idea of gambling is very different from that entertained by most people in my country,\" Dan went on pleasantly. \"To the greater number of Americans, gambling is a method of getting other people's money away from them without working for it.\"  \"And that is why you term it dishonest?\" asked the Countess.  \"Yes,\" replied Dan frankly. \"And, in addition, it is a wicked waste of time that could be put to so many good uses.\"  Countess Ripoli shrugged her fine shoulders, and looked up once more at the young officer. But Dan was smiling back coolly at her.  \"You have not a flattering idea of the Europeans?\" she asked.  \"Quite to the contrary,\" Dan assured her.  \"Yet you think we are both weak and dishonest, because we use our time to poor advantage and because so many of us find Monte Carlo delightful?\" she pressed him.  \"Not all Europeans frequent Monte Carlo,\" Dalzell answered.  \"May I ask my new American friend why _he_ should waste his time here?\" laughed the Countess.  \"I do not believe I have exactly wasted my time,\" Dan replied. \"A naval officer, or any other American, may well spend some of his time here in gaining a better knowledge of human nature. Surely, there is much of human nature to be seen here, even though it be not one of the better sides.\"  \"What is the bad trait, or the vice, that one beholds most at Monte Carlo?\" the Countess asked.  \"Greed,\" Dan rejoined promptly.  \"And dishonesty?\"  \"Much of that vice, no doubt,\" Dan continued. \"To-night there must be many a man here who is throwing away money that his family needs, yet he will never tell his wife that he lost his money over a table at Monte Carlo. Again, there must be many a woman here throwing away money in large sums, and she, very likely, will never tell her husband the truth. Let us say that, in both sexes, there are a hundred persons here to-night who will be dishonest toward their life partners afterward. And then, perhaps, many a young bachelor, who, betrothed to some good woman, is learning his first lessons in greed and deceit. And some young girls, too, who are perhaps learning the wrong lessons in life. I know of one very young man here who tried to blow out his brains to-night. For the sake of a few hours, or perhaps a few weeks, over the gaming tables of Monte Carlo, he had thrown away everything that made life worth living. Any man who gambles bids good-by to the finer things of life.\"  Dan's slow, halting French made the Countess listen very attentively, that she might understand just what he said. She puckered her brow thoughtfully, then suddenly glanced up, laughing with all the witchery at her command.  \"Then, my dear American,\" she said insinuatingly, \"I fear that you are going to refuse me a very great favor.\"  \"I hope not,\" Dan replied, gallantly.  \"There is,\" pursued the Countess, \"such a thing as luck. Often a prophecy of that luck is to be seen in one's face. I see such luck written in your face now. Since you will not play for yourself, I had hoped that you would be willing to let me have the benefit of a little of the luck that is so plainly written on your face. I had hoped, up to this instant, that you would consent to play as my proxy.\"  The Countess was looking at him in a way that would have melted many a man into agreeing to her wishes, but Dan answered promptly:  \"I regret, Countess, to be compelled to refuse your request, but I would not play for myself, nor for anyone else.\"  \"If you so detest Monte Carlo and its pursuits,\" replied the Countess with a pout, \"I cannot understand why you are here.\"  \"There was something useful to be gained from witnessing the sights here, but I have seen as much as I wish,\" Dalzell went on, \"and now I am ready to leave. I am returning to my ship as soon as Darrin is ready to go.\"  \"And he, also, is tired of Monte Carlo?\" asked Countess Ripoli.  \"Darrin's views are much the same as my own,\" Dan responded quietly.  Countess Ripoli bit her lip, then surveyed Dalzell with a sidelong look which she did not believe he saw, but Dan, trained in habits of observation, had missed nothing.  \"Will you take me back to the tables?\" asked the Countess suddenly.  \"With pleasure,\" bowed Dan.  Lightly resting a hand on his arm the Countess guided Dalzell rather than walked with him. Back into the largest salon they moved.  Dan's eye roved about in search of Darrin, but that young ensign was not in sight.         *       *       *       *       *  At that very moment, in fact, Dave Darrin was very much concerned in a matter upon which he had stumbled.  A few moments before his quick eye had espied Emil Gortchky crossing the room at a distance. Gortchky paused barely more than a few seconds to say a few words to a white-bearded, rather distinguished-looking foreigner. The older man returned Gortchky's look, then smiled slightly and moved on.  It was a trivial incident, but it was sufficient to set Dave's mind to working swiftly, on account of what he already knew about Mr. Green Hat.  For a few moments longer Ensign Darrin stood where he was; then, tiring of the scene, and wondering what had become of Danny Grin, he moved out upon one of the verandas, strolling slowly along. Reaching a darker part of the veranda, where a clump of small potted trees formed a toy grove, Dave paused, looking past the trees out upon the vague glimpses to be had of the Mediterranean by night.  There, in the near distance, gleamed the lights of the \"Hudson.\" Darrin's face glowed with pride in the ship and in the Nation that stood behind her.  Almost unconsciously he stepped inside the little grove. For a few minutes longer his gaze rested on the sea. Then, hearing voices faintly, he turned to see if Dalzell were approaching.  Instead, it was the white-bearded foreigner, the murmur of whose voice had reached him. With him was another man, younger, black-haired, and with a face that somehow made the beholder think of an eagle.  The two men were engaged in close, low-voiced conversation.  \"I'd better step into view,\" reflected Darrin, \"so that they may not talk of private matters in my hearing.\"  Just then a chuckle escaped the younger of the pair, and with it Dave distinguished the word, \"American.\"  It was the sneering intonation given the word that made Dave Darrin start slightly.  \"Those men are discussing my country,\" muttered the young ensign, swiftly, \"and one of them at least is well acquainted with that spy, Gortchky. Perhaps I shall do better to remain where I am.\"  Nor had Dave long to deliberate on this point, for the pair now neared the grove. They were speaking French, and in undertones, but Dave's ear was quick for that tongue, and he caught the words:  \"England's friendship is important to America at the present moment, and it is very freely given, too. The English believe in their Yankee cousins.\"  \"When the English lose a naval ship or two at Malta or elsewhere, and learn that it is the Americans who sink their ships, and then lie about it, will the English love for America be as great?\" laughed the younger man.  \"The English will be furious,\" smiled the white-bearded man, \"and they will never learn the truth, either. For a hundred years to come Great Britain will hate the United States with the fiercest hatred.\"  \"It is a desperate trick, but a clever one,\" declared the younger man, admiringly. \"Nor will there be any way for either England or America to learn the truth. The whole world will know that the Yankees destroyed two British ships with all on board. It will probably bring the two countries to actual war. No matter though England is at present engaged in a huge war, the sentiment of her people would force her to take the United States on, too.\"  Ensign Dave Darrin, overhearing that conversation, and well knowing that he was listening to more than vaporing, felt his face blanch. He steeled himself to rigid posture as he felt himself trembling slightly.  Farther down the veranda strolled the French-speaking pair, then wheeled out of sight.  In a twinkling Dave strode silently, swiftly toward the salon that he had left. As he stepped into the brighter light, with admirable control, he slowed down to a sauntering stroll, looking smilingly about as though his whole mind were on the scenes of gambling before him.  A moment or two later Darrin's eyes caught sight of Dan Dalzell, as that young officer bowed the Countess Ripoli to a seat.  In vain did the Countess use her prettiest smiles to hold Danny Grin by her side as she played. Dalzell had been schooled at Annapolis and in the Navy itself, and knew how to take his leave gracefully, which he did, followed by the pouts of the Countess. As soon as she saw that "]]]
