The astute old man was a good judge of human nature, especially human nature as exemplified by a board of women managers. He had held back the fact that Mary Louise also intended to endow the home. He was determined to have her put on the board first, and also her clever little friend, who had such a quiet way of hitting the nail on the head.  With the air of conferring on Mary Louise and Josie a tremendous favor they were finally elected to the board.  \"But who is this Josie O'Gorman?\" asked a smartly dressed woman, \"and why? Isn't she a kind of a washerwoman?\"  \"Hush!\" admonished another. \"Don't you know she is in the Higgledy-Piggledy Shop with Elizabeth Wright?\"  The secretary was requested to inform the two young women of the honor conferred upon them.  \"They are in my office,\" said Dr. Weston, \"and I might just step in and tell them myself.\"  \"Oh, horrors!\" cried one of the women. \"Do you suppose they heard what we said?\"  \"I never said anything but that they were too young. Nobody could object to that.\"  \"And I said board work might prove too arduous for them.\"  \"And I said our board was too big as it was.\"  \"I was for them all the time.\"  \"And I!\"  \"And I!\"    CHAPTER III MARY LOUISE TELLS A STORY  The members of the board need not have concerned themselves in regard to the waiting girls. Josie and Mary Louise had been fully occupied. At the moment that the hubbub had arisen, marking the time when Dr. Weston had made his announcement, there had been a sharp tap on the office door. Josie had opened the door and there had entered a woman and two children, a girl of eight and a boy of about six. The girl carried a badly wrapped bundle of clothes.  Mary Louise and Josie felt a keen interest in all three. The woman was young--under thirty. She was handsome, with raven black hair and well-cut features. Her face was pale and her eyes gloomy. She carried herself with a slow, lazy grace. The good lines of her tall figure asserted themselves in spite of the cheap, ill-fitting serge suit. Josie always noticed hands and feet, because she declared they were more difficult to disguise than any other portion of one's anatomy. One glance at the woman's ungloved hands made Josie wonder at the well-kept nails and dimpled knuckles.  \"No horny-handed daughter of toil, at least,\" was her mental note. She then instinctively glanced at the woman's feet.  \"Too well shod for the serge suit,\" was her verdict, \"high arched triple A with French heels, about a five, which is small for a person of her height. She must be at least five feet, ten inches.\"  This inventory took Josie the fraction of a second, so quick was she to see and pigeon-hole her observations in her well-ordered brain.  The children had evidently been crying. The girl's eyes and nose were red and the boy at intervals gave a dry sob as though he had been through a storm of weeping and could with difficulty stop. They clung to each other as they would had they been drowning. The woman pushed them into the room. The children's clothes were the worse for wear, and untidy. Their faces were dirty and showed signs of grimy little knuckles having been dug into streaming eyes. The eyes of both children were blue, as blue as cornflowers, and their hair very light, the boy's curling in tight rings but the girl's straight and bobbed.  \"I want to see the manager,\" said the woman in a well-modulated voice.  \"Dr. Weston will be here in a few minutes,\" said Mary Louise. \"Won't you sit down?\"  The young woman sank into a chair. She paid no attention to the children, but Josie found them a seat on a bench by the window. The little girl lifted the boy to the bench and put her arm around his shoulders, drawing him close to her sisterly bosom.  \"Quite warm today,\" said Josie to the woman.  Mary Louise could with difficulty keep from giggling. It was so foreign to Josie's character to discuss the weather.  \"Think so?\" answered the woman shortly.  \"Not so warm as it was yesterday, but still a little unseasonable,\" persisted Josie. \"I find a suit quite warm, but then, what is one to wear?\"  Mary Louise listened in amazement. Josie talking weather and clothes! She had reduced the problem of dress to a science and having done so dismissed the matter from her mind. As for the weather, she had frequently declared that all weather was good if one just accepted it.  \"Clothes are getting a little cheaper than they were last spring,\" she chattered on, \"almost pre-war prices at Temple & Sweet's this week. Charming georgette blouses for a mere song and shoes at a great bargain if one wears a narrow last.\"  The woman was plainly interested.  \"Temple & Sweet's?\" she murmured, and her glance instinctively fell on her own well-turned arch and narrow toe.  Suddenly the little boy's sobs got the better of him and he wept convulsively. His sister hugged him more closely and with the hem of her skirt wiped his eyes. She shook her own tow head and her blue eyes snapped dangerously as the woman said roughly: \"Stop your bawling!\"  \"Peter, dear, please!\" she whispered, but Peter could not stop. Mary Louise went over and sat on the bench by the children.  \"You mustn't cry, my boy,\" she said gently. \"Whatever troubles you I am sure will come out right. Look out of the window at that robin. Isn't he busy? Do you know what he is doing? He is building his nest. There is his wife. She is going to help him. What a good little wife she is! She thinks it is better to help because her husband is always stopping and singing. There he goes now! A cunning little teasing song the robin sings. I love to hear him in the spring. He always sounds so gay and cheery. Do you know what will happen when they get the nest built?\"  \"Wha-at?\" sobbed the boy. The tears had ceased and the sobs were almost under control.  \"The little wife bird will lay four beautiful eggs. They will be a greenish blue, the blue that people call robin's egg blue. And then she will stay patiently on her nest for many days keeping those eggs nice and warm, only leaving her nest for something to eat and a drink of water and when she is off, her husband, if he can stop singing long enough, will keep the eggs warm for her, and by and by the pretty blue shells will crack and inside them will be the most ridiculous-looking little creatures you ever saw, all mouth at first, with no feathers at all, and those mouths will always be stretched wide open like this,\" and Mary Louise stretched her pretty mouth as wide as nature would allow. The boy laughed and his sister smiled contentedly.  Mary Louise resumed, in her pleasant voice:  \"Then such a business! Mother and Father Robin will be working every minute of daylight to try and fill those hungry mouths. Poor little worms will be afraid to show their noses or their tails because there will be a robin ready to peck them up and carry them off to their babies. Those little birds will eat so much that by and by they will begin to grow feathers and they will be pretty and fluffy and two of them will take after their father and have very red breasts and two of them will take after their mother and have just a delicate shade of red on their breasts. And after those little birds get all covered with feathers and their wings begin to grow strong Father Robin will say to Mother Robin, 'See here, my dear, it is time these young rascals learned how to fly and to grub for themselves.' That will make Mother Robin sad, because she hates for her babies to grow up and have to leave her.\"  \"O--h!\" in a long-drawn sigh from the little girl. \"Do you think she feels that way? How wonderful?\"  \"Of course she does; at least she will,\" smiled Mary Louise.  \"Go on!\" commanded Peter. \"Polly, don't interrupt! Will they leave their nice house--I mean nest?\"  Josie silently noted the speech of the children. \"From the South!\" was her verdict. \"Soft slurred r's and the way the boy says house would give them away.\"  \"Yes,\" continued Mary Louise, \"some pleasant morning in June, perhaps, they will awaken very early and their mother and father will get busy catching the early worm for their breakfast. You see, nobody must ever try to do anything very important, like learning to fly, on an empty stomach.\"  \"That's what I been a-tellin' Polly; but go on, please.\"  \"Then, when they are all fed and full and happy, Mother Robin balances herself on the side of the nest and spreads her wings and says 'Now, children, watch me!' and she floats down to the ground.\"  \"From away up in the tree tops?\"  \"No, not so high up, because you see robins build in high bushes and hedges, but it will seem very far to the little birds, as high as the top of trees and even church steeples would seem to you.\"  \"But if my mother would say, 'Come on, Peter, and jump off the church steeple, I'm a-gonter do it. I wouldn't feel 'fraid--not a mite, not if my mo--\" But he could not finish the word mother. A realization of something came over him and again his lip trembled and he seemed on the verge of more tears and sobs.  \"And then the little birds,\" continued Mary Louise quickly, trying to keep the tears from her own sweet eyes, \"they will look over the edge of the nest and see their mother hopping around on the soft green grass, and maybe they will see her catch a nice fat wiggly worm and, wonder of wonders! and horror of horrors! instead of flying back to the nest to give it to one of her babies she will gobble it up her own self. That won't be because she is a greedy mother, but just to let them realize that if they get down on the grass they can find plenty of delicious worms for themselves. Then Father Robin will tell them they are all little cry-babies not to jump up and fly from the nest, and one by one "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22532"],["title","Mary Louise and Josie O'Gorman (#3)"],["body","little baby birds will make up their minds and before you know it all four will be down in the grass by their mother. Then, goodness gracious me! what a busy day they will have! The little birds are very plump, because their mother and father have worked so hard to keep them well fed and they have never taken any exercise before except with their mouths, and their little wings seem so weak and their little tummies are so fat and so full, but they try and try and by dusk they have almost learned. At any rate they are able to flutter back into the bush where their old nest is, not that they ever expect to get back in their nest. They would no more try to do that than a great big grown-up man would want to get back in the little cradle in which his mother had rocked him when he was a baby.\"  The biography of the robins was finished just as Dr. Weston came in to announce to Mary Louise and Josie that they had been elected to the board of governors of the Children's Home Society.  \"Oh, but--\" faltered Mary Louise.  \"No buts at all, Mary Louise,\" insisted Josie. \"Of course you must serve because you are interested and I'll serve too just to keep you in countenance.\"  \"I think this lady wishes to speak with you, Dr. Weston.\"  The old man had been so full of his news that he had for the moment overlooked the other occupants of his office. He now turned courteously to the woman who stood up as though she had about finished her business and was ready to leave.  \"If you are the manager then I can go,\" she asserted. \"I want to leave these two children with you.\"  \"Not so fast, madam!\" said Dr. Weston. \"We don't take little children offhand this way. We must find out who they are, why they are here, who is placing them here, all about their parentage--many things, in fact. I shall ask you to be seated, madam, for a few moments while I conduct these young ladies to the board, which is now in session.\"  The woman resumed her seat, a sullen expression on her handsome face. Dr. Weston drew the girls into the parlor, carefully closed the door and then, with a graceful little speech, courtly and kindly, he presented the new members.  \"We think it is splendid that you will give the house to us,\" said one to Mary Louise, who was smiling happily.  \"When can we get in?\" asked another.  \"Immediately!\"  \"We can't afford to move,\" spake the treasurer.  \"Well, we can't afford to stay here, either,\" snapped Mrs. Wright. \"We'll just raise the money by hook or crook.\"  \"I--I--will give some money along with the house,\" faltered Mary Louise. \"It isn't very much, but if $50,000 would help any I can give that much.\"  The board was not noted for its sense of humor, but even it realized how absurd it was for this slip of a girl to be so modest with her fifty thousand dollars, and was it enough? The board burst into laughter. Dr. Weston looked as though he might burst with pride and happiness.  \"To whom must I make the check?\" asked Mary Louise simply, as though making checks for fifty thousand dollars was no more than paying one's gas bill.  \"To the treasurer,\" answered the president, with a gasp.  \"No, no, not to me! I would be afraid to carry around such a check.\" But the treasurer was overruled and Mary Louise proceeded to make out a check there and then. Her fortune had been left to her in cash owing to her grandfather's being unbalanced many months before his death and having converted all of his securities into gold, which he had hid away.  \"I'll have the deeds to the house made over to the Children's Home Society as soon as Mr. Conant, my lawyer, can manage it,\" said Mary Louise.  There being no further business before the board it was joyfully and noisily adjourned by the smiling but flustered president.  \"Now I must go interview the woman with the two little children,\" Dr. Weston said to Josie and Mary Louise.  \"I must see the children again,\" declared Mary Louise. \"Poor lambs!\" But when the door leading to the office was opened the room was found empty. The woman and two children had disappeared.    CHAPTER IV JOSIE DONS A HENNA WIG  \"Believe me, there's something shady about that woman!\" said Josie to Mary Louise. \"She was ready enough to leave the kids until Dr. Weston told her she would have to produce some kind of information about them. That is what scared her off.\"  \"Dear little children,\" said Mary Louise sadly. \"I wonder if she is their mother.\"  \"Of course not! There wasn't a trace of resemblance.\"  \"I know she was a decided brunette and the children were blue-eyed and tow-headed,\" Mary Louise remembered.  \"Color isn't such a proof as line and certain tricks of pose and motion. They had not one single thing in common with the woman and then she was plainly indifferent to them and they were a little in awe of her. That happens sometimes with a mother, but if she is indifferent to her children she usually tries to hide it and makes a show of affection with strangers. And children just have to love their mothers a little bit and it was easy to see those poor kiddies actually hated her. I watched the girl, Polly, and when the woman told the boy to stop bawling Polly had a look in her blue eyes that suggested a desire to bite and scratch and kick or even use a hatchet if one were handy. I think I'll look those people up.\"  \"But how, Josie?\"  \"There are ways,\" smiled Josie. \"You see, I am kind of self-elected detective for the Children's Home Society and my work has begun already. It is not merely to look after the children in the home but those who might, could, would or should be in the home.\"  \"Well, I hope you can find out something. I'd like to know about my poor little Peter. What a precious boy he is!\"  That forenoon Josie happened, as if by chance, into the department store of Temple & Sweet's. First she gave a cursory glance at the bargain counters where georgette blouses were being tossed about by eager shoppers like corks on the restless sea. She then looked in at the shoe department. Seeing nothing there to interest her she made her way to a lunch counter in the basement and satisfied her healthy appetite with a club sandwich and a cup of chocolate. All the time she kept her eye on the shoppers who passed back and forth. After her luncheon she again visited the pile of rumpled blouses, much diminished, and again made her way to the shoe department. Evidently she saw something there that interested her keenly. She hurried to the dressing room and in a moment emerged looking strangely unlike the Josie her friends knew. Her sandy hair was completely covered by a henna wig, bobbed and crimped. Her sedate sailor hat was cocked at a rakish angle and draped with a much-ornamented veil, and mirabile dictu! a lipstick had been freely and relentlessly applied to her honest mouth and her cheeks were touched up with a paint of purplish hue. Her sober Norfolk jacket was as much disguised as its wearer by a silly lace frill pinned around the neck and down the front.  Back to the shoe department Josie hurried and flopped herself down by a young woman who was busily engaged in trying on several styles of bargain pumps. Her slender, high-arched foot was just the kind for the shoes advertised as greatly reduced. It was the woman of the morning, but she, too, was much changed--so much so that Josie herself might not have recognized her had she not been looking for and expecting a change. The dress she wore was no longer a cheap blue serge but a handsome tricolette, richly trimmed according to the prevailing mode. Her hat was plainly a Paris model in strong contrast to the battered, flower-trimmed thing she had worn in the morning. She also had been using a lip-stick and an extra touch of color was on her cheeks.  \"Such sweet shoes!\" ventured Josie in a mincing tone quite in keeping with her henna wig and lace ruffle. \"My, you have a pretty arch!\"  The young woman smiled encouragement, while the admiring shoe clerk tried on a smart brown suede pump.  \"I have been trying to get my arch up,\" continued Josie, sticking out her own well-shod little foot. Josie had very pretty feet and they were one weakness. She always wore a sensible shoe, but it must be of the best material and nobby cut.  \"What do you advise?\" she asked the clerk. \"But maybe you can tell me,\" she said, addressing the young woman by her side. \"Your foot is so wonderful.\"  The woman was evidently pleased and flattered.  \"Oh, thanks awfully,\" she drawled.  \"I wonder if you dance much,\" continued Josie. \"I bet you could do barefoot dancing with such a foot as that. Now could you? Ain't her foot a wonder?\" to the clerk.  \"I never saw a prettier,\" was his verdict.  \"Well, I do dance,\" she confessed. \"In fact, dancing is my profession. I'm not working right now but expect to get back on the road immediately.\"  \"How thrilling!\" cried Josie. Josie's intimates had often wondered at her histrionic powers when she pretended to be stupid, which was her usual way of disarming persons who might have been suspicious of her. She had found out much about those archvillains Felix and Hortense Markle by an assumption of supreme dullness. But no one of her acquaintances had ever seen Josie assume the role of a skittish, dressed-up miss, painted and brazen, talkative and impertinent.  \"I'm just dying to go on the stage,\" she continued. \"I get awful tired of pounding out a living on the typewriter. I'd a sight rather make a living with my toes than with my fingers.\"  The young woman bought the brown suede pumps and also a pair of black ones similar to them. She had already selected several pairs of oxfords and walking boots.  \"You have to be mighty particular with your feet when you have to show them,\" she said, Josie's expansiveness having had its influence on her indifference. \"I never can wear old shoes. They are simply ruination to one's feet. As for cheap shoes--never! Of course, these are bargains merely because they are a bit shop-worn.\"  \"Shall I send these, lady?\" asked the clerk.  \""]]]
