It had been the best of the very few hatchets they had....  \"The next time you even nick that hatchet I'm going to split your skull with it,\" he said. \"Pick it up and get back to work. I mean _work_. You'll have broken blisters on every finger tonight or you'll go on the log-carrying force tomorrow. Now, move!\"  What Bemmon had thought to be his wrath deserted him before Prentiss's fury. He stooped to obey the order but the hatred remained on his face and when the hatchet was in his hands he made a last attempt to bluster:  \"The day may come when we'll refuse to tolerate any longer your sadistic displays of authority.\"  \"Good,\" Prentiss said. \"Anyone who doesn't like my style is welcome to try to change it--or to try to replace me. With knives or clubs, rifles or broken hatchets, Bemmon--any way you want it and any time you want it.\"  \"I----\" Bemmon's eyes went from the hatchet in his half raised hand to the long knife in Prentiss's belt. He swallowed with a convulsive jerk of his Adam's apple and his hatchet-bearing arm suddenly wilted. \"I don't want to fight--to replace you----\"  He swallowed again and his face forced itself into a sickly attempt at an ingratiating smile. \"I didn't mean to imply any disrespect for you or the good job you're doing. I'm very sorry.\"  Then he hurried away, like a man glad to escape, and began to chop stakes with amazing speed.  But the sullen hatred had not been concealed by the ingratiating smile; and Prentiss knew Bemmon was a man who would always be his enemy.         *       *       *       *       *  The days dragged by in the weary routine, but overworked muscles slowly strengthened and people moved with a little less laborious effort. On the twentieth day the wall was finally completed and the camp was prowler proof.  But the spring weather was a mad succession of heat and cold and storm that caused the Hell Fever to take its toll each day and there was no relaxation from the grueling labor. Weatherproof shelters had to be built as rapidly as possible.  So the work of constructing them began; wearily, sometimes almost hopelessly, but without complaint other than to hate and curse the Gerns more than ever.  There was no more trouble from Bemmon; Prentiss had almost forgotten him when he was publicly challenged one night by a burly, threatening man named Haggar.  \"You've bragged that you'll fight any man who dares disagree with you,\" Haggar said loudly. \"Well, here I am. We'll use knives and before they even have time to bury you tonight I'm goin' to have your stooges kicked out and replaced with men who'll give us competent leadership instead of blunderin' authoritarianism.\"  Prentiss noticed that Haggar seemed to have a little difficulty pronouncing the last word, as though he had learned it only recently.  \"I'll be glad to accommodate you,\" Prentiss said mildly. \"Go get yourself a knife.\"  Haggar already had one, a long-bladed butcher knife, and the duel began. Haggar was surprisingly adept with his knife but he had never had the training and experience in combat that interstellar explorers such as Prentiss had. Haggar was good, but considerably far from good enough.  Prentiss did not kill him. He had no compunctions about doing such a thing, but it would have been an unnecessary waste of needed manpower. He gave Haggar a carefully painful and bloody lesson that thoroughly banished all his lust for conflict without seriously injuring him. The duel was over within a minute after it began.  Bemmon, who had witnessed the challenge with keen interest and then watched Haggar's defeat with agitation, became excessively friendly and flattering toward Prentiss afterward. Prentiss felt sure, although he had no proof, that it had been Bemmon who had spurred the simple-minded Haggar into challenging him to a duel.  If so, the sight of what had happened to Haggar must have effectively dampened Bemmon's desire for revenge because he became almost a model worker.         *       *       *       *       *  As Lake had predicted, he and Prentiss worked together well. Lake calmly took a secondary role, not at all interested in possession of authority but only in the survival of the Rejects. He spoke of the surrender of the _Constellation_ only once, to say:  \"I knew there could be only Ragnarok in this section of space. I had to order four thousand people to go like sheep to what was to be their place of execution so that four thousand more could live as slaves. That was my last act as an officer.\"  Prentiss suspected that Lake found it impossible not to blame himself subconsciously for what circumstances had forced him to do. It was irrational--but conscientious men were quite often a little irrational in their sense of responsibility.  Lake had two subleaders: a genial, red-haired man named Ben Barber, who would have been a farmer on Athena but who made a good subleader on Ragnarok; and a lithe, cat-like man named Karl Schroeder.  Schroeder claimed to be twenty-four but not even the scars on his face could make him look more than twenty-one. He smiled often, a little too often. Prentiss had seen smiles like that before. Schroeder was the type who could smile while he killed a man--and he probably had.  But, if Schroeder was a born fighter and perhaps killer, they were characteristics that he expended entirely upon the prowlers. He was Lake's right hand man; a deadly marksman and utterly without fear.  One evening, when Lake had given Schroeder some instructions concerning the next day's activities, Schroeder answered him with the half-mocking smile and the words, \"I'll see that it's done, Commander.\"  \"Not 'Commander,'\" Lake said. \"I--all of us--left our ranks, titles and honors on the _Constellation_. The past is dead for us.\"  \"I see,\" Schroeder said. The smile faded away and he looked into Lake's eyes as he asked, \"And what about our past dishonors, disgraces and such?\"  \"They were left on the _Constellation_, too,\" Lake said. \"If anyone wants dishonor he'll have to earn it all over again.\"  \"That sounds fair,\" Schroeder said. \"That sounds as fair as anyone could ever ask for.\"  He turned away and Prentiss saw what he had noticed before: Schroeder's black hair was coming out light brown at the roots. It was a color that would better match his light complexion and it was the color of hair that a man named Schrader, wanted by the police on Venus, had had.  Hair could be dyed, identification cards could be forged--but it was all something Prentiss did not care to pry into until and if Schroeder gave him reason to. Schroeder was a hard and dangerous man, despite his youth, and sometimes men of that type, when the chips were down, exhibited a higher sense of duty than the soft men who spoke piously of respect for Society--and then were afraid to face danger to protect the society and the people they claimed to respect.         *       *       *       *       *  A lone prowler came on the eleventh night following the wall's completion. It came silently, in the dead of night, and it learned how to reach in and tear apart the leather lashings that held the pointed stakes in place and then jerk the stakes out of their sockets. It was seen as it was removing the third stake--which would have made a large enough opening for it to come through--and shot. It fell back and managed to escape into the woods, although staggering and bleeding.  The next night the stockade was attacked by dozens of prowlers who simultaneously began removing the pointed stakes in the same manner employed by the prowler of the night before. Their attack was turned back with heavy losses on both sides and with a dismayingly large expenditure of precious ammunition.  There could be no doubt about how the band of prowlers had learned to remove the stakes: the prowler of the night before had told them before it died. It was doubtful that the prowlers had a spoken language, but they had some means of communication. They worked together and they were highly intelligent, probably about halfway between dog and man.  The prowlers were going to be an enemy even more formidable than Prentiss had thought.  The missing stakes were replaced the next day and the others were tied down more securely. Once again the camp was prowler proof--but only for so long as armed guards patrolled inside the walls to kill attacking prowlers during the short time it would take them to remove the stakes.  The hunting parties suffered unusually heavy losses from prowler attacks that day and that evening, as the guards patrolled inside the walls, Lake said to Prentiss:  \"The prowlers are so damnably persistent. It isn't that they're hungry--they don't kill us to eat us. They don't have any reason to kill us--they just hate us.\"  \"They have a reason,\" Prentiss said. \"They're doing the same thing we're doing: fighting for survival.\"  Lake's pale brows lifted in question.  \"The prowlers are the rulers of Ragnarok,\" Prentiss said. \"They fought their way up here, as men did on Earth, until they're master of every creature on their world. Even of the unicorns and swamp crawlers. But now we've come and they're intelligent enough to know that we're accustomed to being the dominant species, ourselves.  \"There can't be two dominant species on the same world--and they know it. Men or prowlers--in the end one is going to have to go down before the other.\"  \"I suppose you're right,\" Lake said. He looked at the guards, a fourth of them already reduced to bows and arrows that they had not yet had time to learn how to use. \"If we win the battle for supremacy it will be a long fight, maybe over a period of centuries. And if the prowlers win--it may all be over within a year or two.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The giant blue star that was the other component of Ragnarok's binary grew swiftly in size as it preceded the yellow sun farther each morning. When summer came the blue star would be a sun as hot as the yellow sun and Ragnarok would be "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22549"],["title","Space Prison (#6)"],["body","them. The yellow sun would burn the land by day and the blue sun would sear it by the night that would not be night. Then would come the brief fall, followed by the long, frozen winter when the yellow sun would shine pale and cold, far to the south, and the blue sun would be a star again, two hundred and fifty million miles away and invisible behind the cold yellow sun.  The Hell Fever lessened with the completion of the shelters but it still killed each day. Chiara and his helpers worked with unfaltering determination to find a cure for it but the cure, if there was one, eluded them. The graves in the cemetery were forty long by forty wide and more were added each day. To all the fact became grimly obvious: they were swiftly dying out and they had yet to face Ragnarok at its worst.  The old survival instincts asserted themselves and there were marriages among the younger ones. One of the first to marry was Julia.  She stopped to talk to Prentiss one evening. She still wore the red skirt, now faded and patched, but her face was tired and thoughtful and no longer bold.  \"Is it true, John,\" she asked, \"that only a few of us might be able to have children here and that most of us who tried to have children in this gravity would die for it?\"  \"It's true,\" he said. \"But you already knew that when you married.\"  \"Yes ... I knew it.\" There was a little silence. \"All my life I've had fun and done as I pleased. The human race didn't need me and we both knew it. But now--none of us can be apart from the others or be afraid of anything. If we're selfish and afraid there will come a time when the last of us will die and there will be nothing on Ragnarok to show we were ever here.  \"I don't want it to end like that. I want there to be children, to live after we're gone. So I'm going to try to have a child. I'm not afraid and I won't be.\"  When he did not reply at once she said, almost self-consciously, \"Coming from me that all sounds a little silly, I suppose.\"  \"It sounds wise and splendid, Julia,\" he said, \"and it's what I thought you were going to say.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Full spring came and the vegetation burst into leaf and bud and bloom, quickly, for its growth instincts knew in their mindless way how short was the time to grow and reproduce before the brown death of summer came. The prowlers were suddenly gone one day, to follow the spring north, and for a week men could walk and work outside the stockade without the protection of armed guards.  Then the new peril appeared, the one they had not expected: the unicorns.  The stockade wall was a blue-black rectangle behind them and the blue star burned with the brilliance of a dozen moons, lighting the woods in blue shadow and azure light. Prentiss and the hunter walked a little in front of the two riflemen, winding to keep in the starlit glades.  \"It was on the other side of the next grove of trees,\" the hunter said in a low voice. \"Fred was getting ready to bring in the rest of the woods goat. He shouldn't have been more than ten minutes behind me--and it's been over an hour.\"  They rounded the grove of trees. At first it seemed there was nothing before them but the empty, grassy glade. Then they saw it lying on the ground no more than twenty feet in front of them.  It was--it had been--a man. He was broken and stamped into hideous shapelessness and something had torn off his arms.  For a moment there was dead silence, then the hunter whispered, _\"What did that?\"_  The answer came in a savage, squealing scream and the pound of cloven hooves. A formless shadow beside the trees materialized into a monstrous charging bulk; a thing like a gigantic gray bull, eight feet tall at the shoulders, with the tusked, snarling head of a boar and the starlight glinting along the curving, vicious length of its single horn.  _\"Unicorn!\"_ Prentiss said, and jerked up his rifle.  The rifles cracked in a ragged volley. The unicorn squealed in fury and struck the hunter, catching him on its horn and hurling him thirty feet. One of the riflemen went down under the unicorn's hooves, his cry ending almost as soon as it began.  The unicorn ripped the sod in deep furrows as it whirled back to Prentiss and the remaining rifleman; not turning in the manner of four-footed beasts of Earth but rearing and spinning on its hind feet. It towered above them as it whirled, the tip of its horn fifteen feet above the ground and its hooves swinging around like great clubs.  Prentiss shot again, his sights on what he hoped would be a vital area, and the rifleman shot an instant later.  The shots went true. The unicorn's swing brought it on around but it collapsed, falling to the ground with jarring heaviness.  \"We got it!\" the rifleman said. \"We----\"  It half scrambled to its feet and made a noise; a call that went out through the night like the blast of a mighty trumpet. Then it dropped back to the ground, to die while its call was still echoing from the nearer hills.  From the east came an answering trumpet blast; a trumpeting that was sounded again from the south and from the north. Then there came a low and muffled drumming, like the pounding of thousands of hooves.  The rifleman's face was blue-white in the starlight. \"The others are coming--we'll have to run for it!\"  He turned, and began to run toward the distant bulk of the stockade.  \"No!\" Prentiss commanded, quick and harsh. \"Not the stockade!\"  The rifleman kept running, seeming not to hear him in his panic. Prentiss called to him once more:  \"Not the stockade--_you'll lead the unicorns into it!_\"  Again the rifleman seemed not to hear him.  The unicorns were coming in sight, converging in from the north and east and south, the rumble of their hooves swelling to a thunder that filled the night. The rifleman would reach the stockade only a little ahead of them and they would go through the wall as though it had been made of paper.  For a little while the area inside the stockade would be filled with dust, with the squealing of the swirling, charging unicorns and the screams of the dying. Those inside the stockade would have no chance whatever of escaping. Within two minutes it would be over, the last child would have been found among the shattered shelters and trampled into lifeless shapelessness in the bloody ground.  Within two minutes all human life on Ragnarok would be gone.  There was only one thing for him to do.  He dropped to one knee so his aim would be steady and the sights of his rifle caught the running man's back. He pressed the trigger and the rifle cracked viciously as it bucked against his shoulder.  The man spun and fell hard to the ground. He twisted, to raise himself up a little and look back, his face white and accusing and unbelieving.  _\"You shot me!\"_  Then he fell forward and lay without moving.  Prentiss turned back to face the unicorns and to look at the trees in the nearby grove. He saw what he already knew, they were young trees and too small to offer any escape for him. There was no place to run, no place to hide.  There was nothing he could do but wait; nothing he could do but stand in the blue starlight and watch the devil's herd pound toward him and think, in the last moments of his life, how swiftly and unexpectedly death could come to man on Ragnarok.         *       *       *       *       *  The unicorns held the Rejects prisoners in their stockade the rest of the night and all the next day. Lake had seen the shooting of the rifleman and had watched the unicorn herd kill John Prentiss and then trample the dead rifleman.  He had already given the order to build a quick series of fires around the inside of the stockade walls when the unicorns paused to tear their victims to pieces; grunting and squealing in triumph as bones crushed between their teeth and they flung the pieces to one side.  The fires were started and green wood was thrown on them, to make them smoulder and smoke for as long as possible. Then the unicorns were coming on to the stockade and every person inside it went into the concealment of the shelters.  Lake had already given his last order: There would be absolute quiet until and if the unicorns left; a quiet that would be enforced with fist or club wherever necessary.  The unicorns were still outside when morning came. The fires could not be refueled; the sight of a man moving inside the stockade would bring the entire herd charging through. The hours dragged by, the smoke from the dying fires dwindled to thin streamers. The unicorns grew increasingly bolder and suspicious, crowding closer to the walls and peering through the openings between the rails.  The sun was setting when one of the unicorns trumpeted; a sound different from that of the call to battle. The others threw up their heads to listen, then they turned and drifted away. Within minutes the entire herd was gone out of sight through the woods, toward the north.  Lake waited and watched until he was sure the unicorns were gone for good. Then he ordered the All Clear given and hurried to the south wall, to look down across the barren valley and hope he would not see what he expected to see.  Barber came up behind him, to sigh with relief. \"That was close. It's hard to make so many people stay absolutely quiet for hour after hour. Especially the children--they don't understand.\"  \"We'll have to leave,\" Lake said.  \"Leave?\" Barber asked. \"We can make this stockade strong enough to hold out unicorns.\"  \"Look to the south,\" Lake told him.  Barber did so and saw what Lake had already seen; a broad, low cloud of dust moving slowly toward them.  \"Another herd of unicorns,\" Lake said. \"John didn't know they migrated--the Dunbar Expedition wasn't here long enough to learn that. There'll be herd after herd coming through and no time for us to strengthen the walls. We'll have to leave tonight.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Preparations were made for the departure; preparations that consisted"]]]
