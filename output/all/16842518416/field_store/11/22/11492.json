London Printed by Spottiswoode and Co. New-Street Square   THE SUPERSTITIONS OF WITCHCRAFT.  by  HOWARD WILLIAMS, M.A.  St. John's College, Cambridge.  'Somnia, terrores magicos, miracula, sagas,  Nocturnos lemures, portentaque Thessala rides?'        London: Longman, Green, Longman, Roberts, & Green. 1865.     PREFACE.   'THE SUPERSTITIONS OF WITCHCRAFT' is designed to exhibit a consecutive review of the characteristic forms and facts of a creed which (if at present apparently dead, or at least harmless, in Christendom) in the seventeenth century was a living and lively faith, and caused thousands of victims to be sent to the torture-chamber, to the stake, and to the scaffold. At this day, the remembrance of its superhuman art, in its different manifestations, is immortalised in the every-day language of the peoples of Europe.         *       *       *       *       *  The belief in Witchcraft is, indeed, in its full development and most fearful results, modern still more than mediæval, Christian still more than Pagan, and Protestant not less than Catholic.

EARLIER FAITH.     CHAPTER I.       The Origin, Prevalence, and Variety of Superstition--The      Belief in Witchcraft the most horrid Form of      Superstition--Most flourishing in the Sixteenth and      Seventeenth Centuries--The Sentiments of Addison,      Blackstone, and the Lawyers of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22822"],["title","The Superstitions of Witchcraft (#1)"],["body","Eighteenth Century upon      the Subject--Chaldean and Persian Magic--Jewish      Witchcraft--Its important Influence on Christian and Modern      Belief--Greek Pharmacy and Sorcery--Early Roman Laws against      Conjuration and Magic Charms--Crimes perpetrated, under the      Empire, in connection with Sorceric Practices--The general      Persecution for Magic under Valentinian and Valens--German      and Scandinavian Sagæ--The probable Origin of the general      Belief in an Evil Principle.   Superstition, the product of ignorance of causes, of the proneness to seek the solution of phenomena out of and beyond nature, and of the consequent natural but unreasoning dread of the Unknown and Invisible (ignorantly termed the supernatural), is at once universal in the extent, and various in the kinds, of its despotism. Experience and reason seem to prove that, inherent to and apparently coexistent with the human mind, it naturally originates in the constitution of humanity: in ignorance and uncertainty, in an instinctive doubt and fear of the _Unknown_. Accident may moderate its power among particular peoples and persons; and there are always exceptional minds whose natural temper and exercise of reason are able to free them from the servitude of a delusive imagination. For the mass of mankind, the germ of superstition, prepared to assume always a new shape and sometimes fresh vigour, is indestructible. The severest assaults are ineffectual to eradicate it: hydra-like, far from being destroyed by a seeming mortal stroke, it often raises its many-headed form with redoubled force.  It will appear more philosophic to deplore the imperfection, than to deride the folly of human nature, when the fact that the superstitious sentiment is not only a result of mere barbarism or vulgar ignorance, to be expelled of course by civilisation and knowledge, but is indigenous in the life of every man, barbarous or civilised, pagan or Christian, is fully recognised. The enlightening influence of science, as far as it extends, is irresistible; and its progress within certain limits seems sure and almost omnipotent. But it is unfortunately limited in the extent of its influence, as well as uncertain in duration; while reason enjoys a feeble reign compared with ignorance and imagination.[1] If it is the great office of history to teach by experience, it is never useless to examine the causes and the facts of a mischievous creed that has its roots deep in the ignorant fears of mankind; but against the recurrence of the fatal effects of fanaticism apparent in the earliest and latest records of the world, there can be no sufficient security.    [1] That 'speculation has on every subject of human enquiry   three successive stages; in the first of which it tends to   explain the phenomena by supernatural agencies, in the   second by metaphysical abstractions, and in the third or   final state, confines itself to ascertaining their laws of   succession and similitude' (_System of Logic_, by J. S.   Mill), is a generalisation of Positive Philosophy, and a   theory of the Science of History, consistent probably with   the progress of knowledge among philosophers, but is   scarcely applicable to the mass of mankind.  Dreams, magic terrors, miracles, witches, ghosts, portents, are some of the various forms superstition has invented and magnified to disturb the peace of society as well as of individuals. The most extravagant of these need not be sought in the remoter ages of the human race, or even in the 'dark ages' of European history: they are sufficiently evident in the legislation and theology, as well as in the popular prejudices of the seventeenth century.  The belief in the _infernal_ art of witchcraft is perhaps the most horrid, as it certainly is the most absurd, phenomenon in the religious history of the world. Of the millions of victims sacrificed on the altars of religion this particular delusion can claim a considerable proportion. By a moderate computation, nine millions have been burned or hanged since the establishment of Christianity.[2] Prechristian antiquity experienced its tremendous power, and the primitive faith of Christianity easily accepted and soon developed it. It was reserved, however, for the triumphant Church to display it in its greatest horrors: and if we deplore the too credulous or accommodative faith of the early militant Church or the unilluminated ignorance of paganism, we may still more indignantly denounce the cruel policy of Catholicism and the barbarous folly of Protestant theology which could deliberately punish an impossible crime. It is the reproach of Protestantism that this persecution was most furiously raging in the age that produced Newton and Locke. Compared with its atrocities even the Marian burnings appear as nothing: and it may well be doubted whether the fanatic zeal of the 'bloody Queen,' is no less contemptible than the credulous barbarity of the judges of the seventeenth century. The period 1484 (the year in which Innocent VIII. published his famous 'Witch Hammer' signally ratified 120 years later by the Act of Parliament of James I. of England) to 1680 might be characterised not improperly as the era of devil-worship; and we are tempted almost to embrace the theory of Zerdusht and the Magi and conceive that Ahriman was then superior in the eternal strife; to imagine the _Evil One_, as in the days of the Man of Uz, 'going to and fro in the earth, and walking up and down in it.' It is come to that at the present day, according to a more rational observer of the seventeenth century, that it is regarded as a part of religion to ascribe great wonders to the devil; and those are taxed with infidelity and perverseness who hesitate to believe what thousands relate concerning his power. Whoever does not do so is accounted an atheist because he cannot persuade himself that there are two Gods, the one good and the other evil[3]--an assertion which is no mere hyperbole or exaggeration of a truth: there is the certain evidence of facts as well as the concurrent testimony of various writers.    [2] According to Dr. Sprenger (_Life of Mohammed_). Cicero's   observation that there was no people either so civilised or   learned, or so savage and barbarous, that had not a belief   that the future may be predicted by certain persons (De   Divinatione, i.), is justified by the faith of Christendom,   as well as by that of paganism; and is as true of witchcraft   as it is of prophecy or divination.    [3] Dr. Balthazar Becker, Amsterdam, 1691, quoted in   Mosheim's _Institutes of Ecclesiastical History_, ed. Reid.  Those (comparatively few) whose reason and humanity alike revolted from a horrible dogma, loudly proclaim the prevailing prejudice. Such protests, however, were, for a long time at least, feeble and useless--helplessly overwhelmed by the irresistible torrent of public opinion. All classes of society were almost equally infected by a plague-spot that knew no distinction of class or rank. If theologians (like Bishop Jewell, one of the most esteemed divines in the Anglican Church, publicly asserting on a well known occasion at once his faith and his fears) or lawyers (like Sir Edward Coke and Judge Hale) are found unmistakably recording their undoubting conviction, they were bound, it is plain, the one class by theology, the other by legislation. Credulity of so extraordinary a kind is sufficiently surprising even in theologians; but what is to be thought of the deliberate opinion of unbiassed writers of a recent age maintaining the possibility, if not the actual occurrence, of the facts of the belief?  The deliberate judgment of Addison, whose wit and preeminent graces of style were especially devoted to the extirpation of almost every sort of popular folly of the day, could declare: 'When I hear the relations that are made from all parts of the world, not only from Norway and Lapland, from the East and West Indies, but from every particular nation in Europe, I cannot forbear thinking that there is such an intercourse and commerce with evil spirits as that which we express by the name of witchcraft.... In short, when I consider the question whether there are such persons in the world as those we call witches, my mind is divided between two opposite opinions; or rather, to speak my thoughts freely, I believe in general that there is and has been such a thing as witchcraft, but at the same time can give no credit to any particular modern instance of it.'[4] Evidence, if additional were wanted, how deference to authority and universal custom may subdue the reason and understanding. The language and decision of Addison are adopted by Sir W. Blackstone in 'Commentaries on the Laws of England,' who shelters himself behind that celebrated author's sentiment; and Gibbon informs us that 'French and English lawyers of the present age [the latter half of the last century] allow the _theory_ but deny the _practice_ of witchcraft'--influenced doubtless by the spirit of the past legislation of their respective countries. In England the famous enactment of the subservient parliament of James I. against the crimes of sorcery, &c., was repealed in the middle of the reign of George II., our laws sanctioning not 130 years since the popular persecution, if not the legal punishment.    [4] _Spectator_, No. 117. The sentiments of Addison on a   kindred subject are very similar. Writing about the vulgar   ghost creed, he adds these remarkable words: 'At the same   time I think a person who is thus terrified with the   imagination of ghosts and spectres much more reasonable than   one who, contrary to the reports of all historians, sacred   and profane, ancient and modern, and to the traditions of   all nations, thinks the appearance of spirits fabulous and   groundless. Could not I give myself up to the general   testimony of mankind, I should to the relations of   particular persons who are now living, and whom I"]]]
