I could not and would not do it. I would be cut to pieces, and have my limbs torn piecemeal from my body before I would do it.  As far as the principal was concerned, I felt that, provoked and irritated by his tyranny and injustice, I had exhibited a proud and defiant spirit, which was dangerous to the discipline of the school. I was sorry that, when he called me back, I had not obeyed. While I was in the school-room, or on the premises of the academy, I should have yielded obedience, both in fact and in spirit; and I could not excuse my defiant bearing by the plea that I had been expelled. I was willing, after reflection, to apologize to Mr. Parasyte.  He proposed to pay for my boat. This was a great concession on his part, though it was called forth by the belief that he was legally liable for its destruction. He was willing to do me justice in that respect, if I would humiliate myself before Poodles, and publicly heal the wound which the discipline of the Institute had received at my hands. Even at that time it seemed to me to be noble and honorable to acknowledge an error and atone for it; and I am quite sure, if I could have felt that I had done wrong, I should have been glad to own it, and to make the confession in the presence of the students. There was a principle at stake, and something more than mere personal feeling.  While I was debating with myself what I should do, Mr. Parasyte appeared again. It was a matter of infinite importance to him. The prosperity, if not the very existence, of his school depended upon the issue of this affair; and he was naturally nervous and excited. The students were in a state of incipient rebellion, as their conduct in the afternoon indicated, and it was of the highest moment to the Institute to have the matter amicably adjusted.  On the one hand, if I apologized to Poodles and the principal, the \"powers that be\" would be vindicated, and the authority of the master fully established. On the other hand, if I declined to do so, and the sentence of expulsion was carried out, the boys were in sympathy with me, and the rebellion might break out afresh, and end in the total dissolution of the establishment. Under these circumstances, it was not strange that Mr. Parasyte desired to see me again.  \"I hope you have carefully considered your position, Thornton,\" said he.  \"I have,\" I replied; \"and I am willing to apologize to you, but not to Poodles.\"  \"That is something gained,\" added he; and I could see his face brighten up under the influence of a hope.  \"My manner was defiant, and my conduct disobedient. I am willing to apologize to you for this, and to submit to such punishment as you think proper to inflict.\"  \"That is very well; but it does not fully meet the difficulty. You must also apologize to Poodles, which you are aware may be done in private.\"  \"I cannot do it, sir, either in public or in private. Poodles was wholly and entirely to blame.\"  \"I think not; when I settled the case it was closed up, and it must not be opened again; at least not till some new testimony is obtained. I cannot eat my own words.\"  \"You may obtain new testimony, if you desire,\" I suggested.  \"What?\"  \"Poodles signed the declaration that he had performed the examples on the papers without assistance.\"  \"He did. Have you any doubt that such is the case?\" asked Mr. Parasyte, though he must have been satisfied that Poodles did not work out the examples.  \"I am entirely confident that he did not perform them. Mr. Parasyte,\" I continued, earnestly, \"I desire to stay at the Institute. It would be very bad for me to be turned out, and I am willing to confess I have done wrong. If you give Poodles the paper with the examination on it, and he can perform one half of the examples, even now, without help, I will apologize to him in public or in private.\"  \"That looks very fair, but it is not,\" replied the principal, rubbing his head, as if to stimulate his ideas.  \"If Poodles can do the problems, I shall be willing to believe that I am mistaken. In my opinion, he cannot perform a single one of them, let alone the whole of them.\"  \"I object to this proceeding,\" said he, impatiently. \"It will be equivalent to my making a confession.\"  The bell rang for the boys to assemble for the evening devotions. It gave Mr. Parasyte a shock, for the business was still unsettled. I had submitted to him a method by which he could ascertain the truth or falsehood of Poodle's statements; but it involved an acknowledgment that he, Mr. Parasyte, was in the wrong. He seemed to be afraid it would be proved that he had made a blunder; that he had given an unjust judgment. I was fully aware that the principal's position was a difficult and painful one, and I was even disposed to sympathize with him to a certain extent, though I was the victim of his partiality and injustice. The perils and discomforts of his situation, however, had been produced by his own hasty and unfair judgment; and it would have been far better for him even to apologize to me. He would have lost nothing with the boys by such a course; for never in my life did I have so exalted an opinion of a schoolmaster, as when, conscious that he had done wrong, he nobly and magnanimously acknowledged his error, and begged the forgiveness of the boy whom he had unintentionally misjudged.  I feel bound to say, in this connection, and after a longer experience of the world, that many schoolmasters, \"armed with a little brief authority,\" are the most contemptible of petty tyrants. Their arrogance and oppression are intolerable; and I have often wondered, that where such men have been planted, they have not produced more of the evil fruit of strife and rebellion. Mr. Parasyte was one of this class; and the fact that he was a splendid teacher did not help his influence in the slightest degree.  \"There is the bell for evening prayers, Thornton, and it is necessary for me to know instantly what you intend to do,\" said the principal.  \"I shall not apologize to Poodles; I will to you.\"  \"Think well of it.\"  \"I have done so. If Poodles can do one half the examples on the paper, I will apologize.\"  \"I have decided that question, and shall not open it again.\"  \"I have nothing more to say, Mr. Parasyte,\" I replied, with becoming dignity, as I braced myself for the consequences of the decision I had made.  \"You are an obstinate and self-willed fellow!\" exclaimed the principal, irritated by the result.  I made no reply.  \"The consequences be upon your own head.\"  I bowed in silence.  \"You have lost your good character and your boat.\"  I glanced out of the window, and saw the boys filing into the school-room.  \"I shall explain this matter to your fellow-students, and tell them what I proposed.\"  \"Do so,\" I answered.  He could not help seeing that I was thoroughly in earnest, and that I did not intend to yield any more than I had indicated. He was vexed, annoyed, angry, and bolted out of the room, at last, in no proper frame of mind to conduct the religious exercises of the hour. It was quite dark now; and I lay down upon the bed, to think of what had passed, and to conjecture the result of my conduct. How I sighed then for some kind friend to advise me! How I wished that I had a father who would tell me what to do, and fight my battle for me! How I longed for a tender mother, into whose loving face I could gaze as I related the sad experience of that eventful day! Perhaps she would bid me apologize to Poodles, for the sake of saving my good name, and retaining my connection with the school. If so, though it would be weak and unworthy, I could humble myself for her sake.  I felt that I had done right. I had made all the concession which truth and justice required of me, and I was quite calm. I hardly inquired why Mr. Parasyte was keeping me a prisoner in the Institute after he had expelled me, or what he intended to do with me. About nine o'clock my own clothes were brought back to me by one of the servants; but the door was securely locked when he retired.  A few minutes later, and before the sound of the servant's retreating footsteps had ceased, I heard some one thrust a key into the door. It did not fit, and a dozen others were tried in like manner, but with no better success. I heard a whispered consultation; and then the door began to strain, and crack, until the bolt yielded, and it flew open. My sympathizing friends, the students, headed by Bob Hale, had broken it down.  \"Come, Ernest,\" said Bob. \"You needn't stay in here any longer. We want you down stairs.\"  \"What are you going to do?\" I asked, quietly, of my excited deliverers.  \"There is no law or justice in this concern; and we are going to put things to rights,\" replied Tom Rush, a good fellow, who had spent a week's vacation with me circumnavigating Lake Adieno in the Splash.  \"You know I don't approve of any rows or riots,\" I added.  \"No row nor riot about it. We have taken possession of this establishment, and we are going to straighten things out,--you can bet your life on that.\"  \"Where is Mr. Parasyte?\"  \"He has gone up to see your uncle. He told us, at evening prayers, what an obstinate boy you were; how kind, and tender, and forgiving he had been to you, and how he had exhausted good nature in trying to bring you to a proper sense of duty.\"  \"Did he say that?\"  \"He did, and much more. But come with us. The fellows have captured the citadel, and we hold the school-room now, waiting for you.\"  \"I will go with you; but I don't want the fellows to make a disturbance.\"  \"No disturbance at all, Ernest; but we have turned the assistant teachers out, and mean to ascertain who is right and who is wrong in this matter.\"  The rebellion had actually broken out again; and the students, in the most high-handed manner, had established a tribunal in the school-room, to try the issue of my affair with the principal."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22433"],["title","Breaking Away; or, The Fortunes of a Student (#7)"],["body"," I followed Bob Hale, Tom Rush, and half a dozen others, who constituted the committee to wait on me. They conducted me to the main school-room, which was a large hall. At every door and window were stationed two or three of the larger boys, with their hockies, bats, and rulers as weapons, to defend the court, as they called it, from any interruption.  About two thirds of the students were there assembled; and though the gathering was a riotous proceeding, the boys were in as good order as during the sessions of the school. In an arm-chair, on the platform, sat Henry Vallington, one of the oldest and most dignified students of the Institute, who, it appeared, was to act as judge. Before him were Bill Poodles and Dick Pearl,--the latter being one of the six whose examples were all right,--arraigned for trial, and guarded by four stout students.     CHAPTER VII.  IN WHICH ERNEST ATTENDS THE TRIAL OF BILL POODLES AND DICK PEARL.   I confess that I was appalled at the boldness and daring of my fellow-students, who had actually taken possession of the Parkville Liberal Institute, and purposed to mete out justice to me and to Bill Poodles. There was a certain kind of solemnity in the proceedings, which was not without its effect upon me. My companions were thoroughly in earnest, and the affair was not to be a farce.  Mr. Parasyte, after prayer, had made a statement to the students in regard to the unpleasant event of the day, in which he represented me as a contumacious offender, one who desired to make all the trouble he could; an obstinate, self-willed fellow, whose example was dangerous to the general peace, and who had refused to be guided by reason and common sense. He told the students that he had even offered to pay for my boat--a concession on his part which had had no effect in softening my obdurate nature. He appealed to them to sustain the discipline of the Parkville Liberal Institute, which had always been celebrated as a remarkably orderly and quiet establishment. He then added that he should consult my uncle in regard to me, and be guided in some measure by his judgment.  The students heard him in silence; but Bob Hale assured me that it was with compressed lips, and a fixed determination to carry out the plan which had been agreed upon while the boys were watching the chase on the lake, and which had not been modified by the wilful destruction of the Splash.  I glanced around at my fellow-students as I entered the hall; and though they smiled as their gaze met mine, there was a look of earnestness and determination which could not be mistaken. Henry Vallington, the chairman, judge, or whatever the name of his office was, had the reputation of being the steadiest boy in the school. It was understood that he intended to become a minister. He was about eighteen, and was nearly fitted to enter college. He never joined in what were called the \"scrapes\" of the Institute, but devoted himself with the closest attention to his studies. He was esteemed and respected by all who knew him; and when I saw him presiding over this irregular assemblage, I could not help regarding the affair as much more serious than it had before seemed, even to me, the chief actor therein.  Poodles and Pearl, I learned, had been captured in their rooms, and dragged by sheer force into the school-room, to be examined on the charges to be preferred against them. Poodles looked timid and terrified, while Pearl was dogged and resolute.  \"Thornton,\" said Henry Vallington, as my conductors paused before the judge, \"I have sent for you in order that we may ascertain the truth of the charges brought against you by Mr. Parasyte. If you provoked the quarrel to-day noon with Poodles, it is no more than fair and right that you should make the apology required of you. If you did not, we intend to stand by you. Have you anything to say?\"  \"I wish to say, in the first place, that, guilty or innocent, I am willing to submit to whatever penalty the principal imposes upon me.\"  \"That is very well for you, but it won't do for us,\" interposed the judge. \"If such gross injustice is done to one, it may be to another. We act in self-defence.\"  \"I don't know what you intend to do; but I am opposed to any disorderly conduct, and to any violation of the rules of the Institute.\"  \"We know you are, Thornton; and you shall not be held responsible for what we do to-night. If you are willing to tell us what you know about this affair, all right. If not, we shall go on without you.\"  \"I am willing to tell the truth here, as I have done to-day. As there seems to be some mistake in regard to what transpired between Mr. Parasyte and myself, up stairs, I will state the facts as they occurred. He agreed to pay for my boat on condition that I would apologize, privately, to Poodles, and publicly to the principal. I offered to apologize to Mr. Parasyte, but not to Poodles, who was the aggressor in the beginning. I told him, if Poodles would perform half the examples now, I would make the apology to him.\"  \"That's it!\" shouted half a dozen boys.  \"Order!\" interposed the judge, sternly.  \"I think that would be a good way to prove that Poodles did or did not tell the truth, when he said he had performed the examples,\" interposed Bob Hale.  \"Capital!\" added Tom Rush.  \"I approve the method; but let us have no disorder,\" replied Vallington. \"Conduct Poodles to the blackboard.\"  The custodians of the culprit promptly obeyed this order, and led him to the blackboard, which was cleaned for immediate use. The school-room was well lighted, and the expression on the faces of all could be distinctly seen.  \"Poodles, we desire to have justice done to all,\" said Vallington, when the culprit had taken his place at the blackboard. \"You shall have fair play in every respect. You shall have a chance to prove that you were right, and Thornton wrong.\"  \"Well, I was right,\" replied Poodles.  \"Did you perform all the examples on your paper without any help?\"  \"Of course I did.\"  \"Then of course you know how to perform them. Here is an examination paper. If you can perform five of the ten examples you shall be acquitted.\"  \"Perhaps I don't choose to do them,\" said Poodles, looking around for some way to escape his fate.  \"Are you not willing that the truth should come out?\"  \"I told the truth to-day.\"  \"All right, if you did. You surely will not object to _prove_ that you did. You shall have fair play, I repeat.\"  \"Suppose I don't choose to do them?\" asked Poodles, doubtfully.  \"Then we shall take it for granted that you did not do them, as you declared on your paper.\"  \"You can take it for granted, then, if you like,\" answered Poodles, as he dropped the chalk.  \"You refuse to perform the examples--do you?\" demanded Vallington, sternly.  \"Yes, I do.\"  \"Then you may take the consequences. Either you shall be expelled from the Institute, or at least fifty of us will petition our parents to take us from this school. We have done with you.\"  Bill Poodles smiled, and was pleased to get off so easily; but I noticed that Dick Pearl turned pale, and looked very much troubled. He was a relative of Mr. Parasyte, and it was generally understood that he was a free scholar, his parents being too poor to pay his board and tuition. While he expected to be ducked in the lake, or subjected to some personal indignity, after the manner in which boys usually treat such cases, his courage was good. Now, it appeared that the boys simply intended to have Poodles expelled, or to ask their parents and guardians to remove them; and as most of the students were from fourteen to eighteen years of age, they would probably have influence enough to effect their design.  \"Pearl,\" said the judge, while the other culprit was apparently still attempting to figure out the result of the trial.  \"I'm here,\" replied Pearl.  \"We are entirely satisfied that Poodles had some assistance in performing his examples. It is believed that you gave him that assistance. If you did, own up.\"  \"Who says I helped Poodles?\"  \"I say so, for one,\" added the judge, sharply.  \"Can you prove it?\"  \"I will answer that question after you have confessed or refused to confess. You shall have fair play, as well as Poodles. If you wish to put yourself right on the record, you can do so; if not, you shall leave, or we will.\"  Pearl looked troubled. He was under very great obligations to Mr. Parasyte. If he denied that he had helped Poodles, and it was then proved against him, the boys would insist that he should be expelled. If he stood out, he must either be expelled or the Institute be broken up. He did not appear willing to take such a responsibility.  \"You can do as you please, Pearl; but tell the truth, if you say anything,\" continued Vallington.  \"I did help Poodles,\" said he, looking down at the floor.  \"How much did you help him?\"  \"I lent him my examination paper, and he copied all the solutions upon his own.\"  \"And after that you were willing to declare that you had not assisted any one?\" demanded the judge, with a look of supreme contempt on his fine features.  \"I had not helped any one _when_ I signed my paper.\"  \"Humph!\" exclaimed Vallington, with a withering sneer. \"That is the meanest kind of a lie.\"  \"I didn't mean to assist him; he teased me till I couldn't help myself,\" pleaded Pearl.  A further examination showed that Poodles had browbeaten and threatened him; and we were disposed to palliate Pearl's offence, in consideration of his poverty and his dependent position, after he had confessed his error.  \"Are you willing to make this acknowledgment to Mr. Parasyte?\" asked the judge, in a tone of compassion.  \"I don't want to; but I will. I suppose he will send me home then,\" replied the culprit.  \"We will do what we can for you,\" added the judge.  Pearl had been a pretty good fellow among the boys, was generally popular, and all were sorry for him. But his confession in a manner absolved him, and the students heartily declared that they"]]]
