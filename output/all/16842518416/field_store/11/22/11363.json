[Illustration]  A showman, particularly with some attraction of the passing hour, must \"boom his show for all it's worth,\" as the Americans say; so I \"boomed\" my \"Artistic Joke\" with an advertising joke, and at the same time parodied another branch of art--the art of advertising the artists, by a special number of a magazine devoted to the work of an Academician. The special numbers, generally published at Christmas, are familiar and interesting to us all. Still, from any point of view they are fair game. They are of course merely non-critical, eulogistic accounts of the artist and his work. So  \"_How he Did It--The Story of my 'Artistic Joke,'_\" duly appeared, written by my Lay-figure.   \"PREFACE.  [Illustration]  \"The fact of my being only an artist's lay-figure will account for any stiffness or angularity in my literary style. Whilst conscious of my deficiencies in this respect, I am comforted by the consideration that a lay-figure attempting literature cannot by any possibility perpetrate greater absurdities than are committed by many a ready writer who indulges in those glowing and gushing descriptions of artists and their work which it is now the fashion to publish, in some such shape as the present, for the delectation (and delusion) of a gossip-loving public.\"  This, the origin of \"The Artistic Joke,\" is a fair specimen of the absurdity I published as an advertisement, though many bought it and read it as a \"true and authentic account\" of the confessions of a caricaturist's lay-figure:  [Illustration: MY PORTRAIT. FRONTISPIECE FOR 'HOW HE DID IT.']  \"As many would be interested in knowing how this extraordinary idea of an Academy _pour rire_ first occurred to this artist, I hasten to gratify their natural curiosity. It was before little Harry reached the age of seven, and while watching with fellow-feeling the house-painters at work in his father's house. One day, at lunchtime, when the men had left their ladders and paraphernalia near the picture-gallery (a long room containing choice works of all the great masters), he seized his opportunity: with herculean strength and Buffalo-Billish agility, our hero dragged all the ladders, paints and brushes into the gallery, and soon was at work 'touching up' the pictures, to gratify his boyish love of mischief. Truth to tell, his performance was but on a par, artistically, with that usually shown when mischievous boys get hold of brushes and paint and a picture to restore.\"  [Illustration:  25, Old Bond Street, LONDON, W. Jubilee Day 1887  I have been favoured--if that is the proper word--with a sight of an advance copy of this perpetration.  I feel that the Easy confidence which has hitherto existed between an artist and his Lay Figure is for ever broken and fled. If I had only known that wine was taking advantage of her exceptional opportunities to betray my misplaced confidence in this popular but pestilent fashion, I would have made firewood of her long ago.  It is now too late. The temptation is turn Graphic Gusher and confidential Trotter-out, has proved too much for a wee docile and discreet Lay Figure. I am one more victim at unsuspected hands, to the revolting rage for \"Revelations.\"  I am bound to admit, however, that whilst the taste of the whole \"Story\" is execrable, the facts upon which it is founded are undisputable.  The Tale is an o'er true one, though it has been compiled without the knowledge, and is published exactly against the desire of  Harry Furniss]  \"Before Harry had finished touching-up the valuable family portraits, his father came in, glanced round, and fell onto a couch in roars of laughter. 'It's the best Artistic Joke I've ever seen, my boy, and here's a shilling for you!' A happy thought struck Harry at the moment. He kept it to himself for over twenty-five years; and now, standing high upon an allegorical ladder, he repeats the Joke daily, from nine to seven, admission one shilling.\"  This book of sixty pages sold extremely well, and, strange to say, I made more money out of this joking advertisement--the work of a few days--than I did out of my elaborate album of seventy photogravure plates which occupied two years to produce and cost me £2,000.  The following lines from _Fun_ give the origin of my Joke's peculiar and ingenious turn:    \"The fact is the Forty were sad in their mind     (Unfortunate _Aca_demicians!)   Associates also were troubled in kind,     With jeers at their works and positions,   Till one who was younger and bolder than all     Declared 'doleful dumps' to be folly,   'Come--away to the club, and for supper let's call,     And try to be decently jolly.'    \"So they fed with good will on the viands prepared     (Pork chops were the principal portion),   Then retiring to bed, with their dreams they were scared,     And spent half the night in contortion;   Then rose in their sleep and came down to this room,     And, instead of a purposeless pawing,   They painted these pictures, then fled in the gloom,     And Furniss has touched up the drawing!\"  Having parodied the artists' work, the R.A. catalogue, and the publishers' R.A. special numbers, I went one step further. I parodied \"Art Patrons.\" At that time there was a great stir in art circles in consequence of the authorities of the National Gallery dallying with Mr. Tate's offer of his pictures to the nation; so to emulate him, and Mr. Alexander, and Mr. Watts, and other public benefactors in the world of art, I sent the following letter to the Directors of the National Gallery:       \"Mr. Harry Furniss presents his compliments to the Trustees of the      National Gallery and begs to congratulate them upon the munificent      gifts lately made to them, particularly Mr. Henry Tate's, which      provides the nation with an excellent sample of current art. At the      same time Mr. Harry Furniss feels that having it in his power to      provide a more complete collection of our modern English school, he      is inspired by the generous offers of others to humbly imitate this      good example, and will therefore willingly give his 'Royal Academy'      (parodies on modern painters), better known as 'The Artistic Joke,'      which caused such a sensation in 1887, to the National Gallery if      the Trustees will honour him by accepting the collection.\"  Yet it was not believed, at least not in Aberdeen, for the leading paper of the Granite City published the following:       \"Someone has played a joke on Mr. Harry Furniss. An announcement      appears this morning to the effect that 'animated by the generosity      of Mr. Henry Tate and other benefactors of the National Gallery,      Mr. Harry Furniss has offered to the Trustees his collection of      illustrations of the work of modern artists recently on view in      Bond Street,' and that he 'has received a communication to the      effect that his offer is under consideration.' I believe no one was      more surprised by this communication than Mr. Furniss. He never      made the offer except possibly in jest to some Member of      Parliament, and naturally he was much surprised to learn that his      offer was 'under consideration.' The illustrations in question      could scarcely be dispensed with by Mr. Furniss, as they are to him      a sort of stock-in-trade.\"  Not only in Aberdeen but I found generally my seriousness was doubted, so I reproduce on the opposite page in facsimile the graceful reply of the authorities of our National Gallery:  The \"Artistic Joke\" was never intended as an attack on the Royal Academy at all, as a clear-headed critic wrote:       \"It would be more just to regard it as an attempt on Mr. Furniss's      part to show the Academicians the possibilities of real beauty, and      wonder, and pleasure that lie hidden in their work.... On the      whole, the Royal Academicians have never appeared under more      favourable conditions than in this pleasant gallery. Mr. Furniss      has shown that the one thing lacking in them is sense of humour,      and that, if they would not take themselves so seriously, they      might produce work that would be a joy, and not a weariness to the      world. Whether or not they will profit by the lessons it is      difficult to say, for dulness has become the basis of      respectability, and seriousness the only refuge of the shallow.\"  [Illustration: The Artistic Joke.]     CHAPTER IX.

If I wasn't ill, I ought to be. I must be overworked and break down. I had \"burnt the candle at both ends and in the middle as well,\" and it was a duty I owed to humanity to collapse. For years I had done the work of three men with the constitution of one, so one day it came to pass that I was forced by my friends into the consulting-room of a celebrated physician, labelled \"Ill. To be returned to Dead Letter Office, or to be sent by foreign mail to some distant land, or to be cremated on the spot,\" anything but to leave me free to return to my mad disease, the worst mania of all--the mania for work.  My good physician stripped me, pommelled me, stethoscoped me, made me say \"99\" when he had squeezed all the breath out of me (why \"99\"? Why not \"98\" or \"4\"?--he was testing internal rebellion), flashed a reflector under my eyes, seized a drumstick and hammered me under my knee-joints, sat upon me literally and figuratively, and told me to give up all food, drink, pleasure, and work for two months, which I did. My balance at the bankers' and my balance on the scales were both reduced considerably. I lost a good many pounds in weight and money.         *       *       *       *       *  [Illustration]  My friends all assured me that I looked well, but I never felt so ill in all my life. If I was not ill, I ought to be. I tried to work, but broke down. I was idle in the mornings, in the evenings, and in the middle of the day as well, and it was a duty I owed to my doctor to collapse. So one day I forced myself into his consulting-room before a hundred patients waiting their turn, labelled \"Well again.\" I pushed him into his chair, pommelled him 99 times, flashed my cane under his eyes, seized the poker and hammered him under his knee-joints, and told him I would get him six months' hard labour if he did not pronounce me sound,--he did.  \"You only want a tonic now, my dear fellow--a sea-trip!\"  \"A _Teutonic_,\" I replied _Majestic_ally. \"The very thing--sails to-morrow--a new berth--I'll be born again under a White Star--_au revoir_!\"  \"Your prescription!\" he called after me. \"Take it, and if you value your life act up to it to the letter.\"  It contained two words and no hieroglyphics. Those two words were--\"No Work!\"  How I acted up to it the following pages will show.         *       *       *       *       *  [Illustration: AN ATLANTIC \"GREYHOUND.\"]  In strong contrast to the crowd and bustle at leaving in the afternoon is the quietude late in the evening. Many promenade up and down the beautiful deck under the electrically-lighted roof, and gaze upon the lights of many craft flitting to and fro in the gentle breeze like will-o'-the-wisps, postponing retiring, as they are not yet accustomed to the vibration of the Atlantic greyhound, which trembles underneath them as if, like the real greyhound in full cry after a hare, it is literally straining every muscle to beat the record from the Old World to the New.  What a difference has taken place since those \"good old days\" of those good old wooden ships, with their good old slow passages and their good old uncomfortable berths! Now the state cabin is an apartment perfectly ventilated, gorgeously furnished, equipped with every modern improvement, and electrically lighted; the switches close to the bed (not berth) enable one to turn the light on or off at will. The ever-watchful attendant comes in, wishes me good-night, after folding my clothes, and departs. Leaving the incandescent light burning over my head, I open the book dealing with the wonders of America which I have taken from the well-stocked library, and read of great Americans, from Washington to the man who has brought this very light to such perfection, turning over page after page of well-nigh incredible description of the country which has raised the system of \"booming\" to a high art, till my brain reels with an Arabian Nightish flavour of exaggeration, and turning off the electric current, I am gradually lulled to sleep by the rhythmical vibrations of the steamer, the sole reminder that I am in reality sleeping upon a ship and about to enjoy a thorough week's rest.  I awoke from the dreams in which I had pictured myself a veritable Columbus, and drawing aside the blind of my porthole, I looked out into the morning light, and was, perhaps, for a second surprised to see land. \"Sandy Hook already! Can it be?\" Well, hardly, just at present. Though who can tell but that in another fifty years it may be possible in the time? It is in reality the \"Ould Counthry,\" and we are nearing Queenstown.  There is a good muster at breakfast, and everyone is smiling, having had at least one good night's rest on the voyage. The waters skirting the Irish coast sometimes outdo the fury of the broad Atlantic, and are generally just as troubled and combatant as the fiery political elements on the little island; but so far we have had a perfect passage, and the beautiful bay of Queenstown looks more charming than ever as the engines stop for a short period before their five days' incessant activity to follow.  Not only the ship, but the doctor, comes from the Emerald Isle. Who crossing the Atlantic does not know the witty Dr.----? \"Ah, shure, me darlin', and isn't it himself that's a broth av a bhoy?\" And so he is, simply bubbling over with humour and good-nature. Presiding at one end of the long table, I have to pass him as I leave the saloon. Having sketched Irish scenery and Irish character in my youth, I am not tempted to open my forbidden sketch-book; but somehow or other I find myself making a rapid sketch of the Doctor as he rises from his seat at the end of the table to wish the \"top of the mornin'\" to a lady who sits on his right. My excuse is to send it to his friend, my doctor in London. Then, without thinking, I sketch in a few other passengers, and instinctively make a note of the surroundings. I confess I am already guilty of breaking my pledge! And, therefore, make my escape on deck.  The huge steamer seems to act as a sort of magnet on the small fry of the harbour, for they rush out to her from the land in all their sorts and sizes, in a desperate race for supremacy. Prominent among this fleet is a long, ungainly rowing-boat propelled by a tough Hibernian, and seated in the stern are his women folk, surrounded by baskets, who, in strong Milesian vernacular, urge the rower on in his endeavours to reach the ship first. Looked down upon them from your floating tower, they strongly resemble a swarm of centipedes. Harder and harder pull the \"bhoys,\" and louder and louder comes the haranguing of the females as they approach us. I have my eye on the lady in the stern of the first boat. She is fair, fat, and forty, possessed of really massive proportions, most powerful lungs, and a true Irish physiognomy--a cast of countenance in which it always strikes me that Nature had originally forgotten the nasal organ, and then returning to complete the work had taken between finger and thumb a piece of flesh and pinched it, thus forming the nose rather high up on the face, while the waste of material below goes to make the upper lip.  [Illustration: THE SALOON OF THE _TEUTONIC_. THE FIRST MORNING AT BREAKFAST.]  The puller of the stroke oar is probably her husband, two others are wielded evidently by her two sons, and the bow is taken by her strapping daughter. One of her arms encircles the merchandise she intends to dispose of on board our vessel, while the other vigorously helps to propel the oar held by her brawny husband. All the while she is urging on her crew in her native language, with what may be commands, exhortations, or even blessings, but sounding to the unaccustomed Saxon ear very much like curses, which chase one another out of her capacious mouth with a rapidity unequalled by even an irritated monkey at the Zoo.  [Illustration: AT QUEENSTOWN--A REMINISCENCE.]  Their lumbering craft is the first to touch the side of the _Teutonic_. Standing up in the boat, the good old lady exerts her vocal powers on the crew on the lower deck, with the result that a rope fully fifty feet long is thrown in her direction, having a loop on the end of it, by which she is lassoed. With an agility only acquired after years of practice, she adjusts the loop rapidly round her, and calls on the crew to hoist away. The boat heels over to one side as she vigorously pushes herself away from it, and souse the old dame goes up to her waist in the water; the good-natured sailors give an extra jerk, and up she comes, with baskets tied round her waist, and her feet acting as fenders against the side of the ship. Fortunately the _Teutonic_ is bulky enough to resist heeling over under this extra weight on the starboard side. She is shipped like a bale of goods, and is immediately engaged in discharging some more of her loquacity in directing the acrobatic performances of her daughter, who is the next to ascend.  This scene caused much laughter, and I was induced to make a sketch of the lady's acrobatic performance.  The other maritime vendors are hauled up in similar unceremonious fashion, and they take possession of both decks. The pretty daughter of Erin lays out with no little artistic taste her bog-oak ornaments, and 'Arry (for the _genus_ cad is to be encountered even on board such aristocratic ships as these) attempts to be rampantly facetious at her expense. But the damsel with the unkempt auburn locks flowing about her comely face, lit up by a pair of blue Irish eyes under their dark lashes, takes the cad's vulgarity together with his money, like the pill with the jam, giving in return the valueless pieces of carved wood, until her little stock is exhausted and a good morning's work is done.  [Illustration: BOG-OAK SOUVENIRS.]  On the lower deck trade is brisker.
