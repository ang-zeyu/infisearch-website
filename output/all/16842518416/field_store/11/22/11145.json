It was a case that appealed to her detective instincts.  As was her habit, she took her story to Captain Charlie Lonsdale, chief of police, and asked his advice. He listened carefully to all her points.  \"Sounds shady, very shady. Evidently this Dink is a bad 'un, but who is employing you on this case?\"  \"Nobody. I'm just on my own, but I can't sit still and see two clever little kids done out of home and mother and maybe a fortune just because nobody makes it his business to dig out the evidence. I'd like to travel a little, anyhow, so I'm going on a trip to Atlanta and see for myself who these Wallers are and what this Chester Hunt is doing and if the father is really dead. Sooner or later somebody is going to want to know and your Aunt Josie is going to have that information when it is called for.\"  Captain Lonsdale smiled. \"The real spirit of a detective, my child, is to be interested in every mystery whether it is your business or not. I give you all honor because of it. But tell me, who is to defray expenses? One can't live on curiosity.\"  \"Almost!\" laughed Josie. \"But this time Mary Louise is to help me out. I am going to take a holiday, I tell you, and go on a trip for my health, so why shouldn't I pay for my own jaunt?\"  \"No reason at all. I wish I had a few like you on the force. My men are afraid to take a taxi when it is of paramount importance to get to a spot in a hurry. Afraid somebody won't reimburse them.\"  \"That's not their fault,\" declared Josie. \"I fancy they have families to support and maybe the city is slow to recognize their expense accounts. I have nobody to support but myself and I would pay out my whole income just for the satisfaction of getting ahead of some crook. This Cousin Dink is the limit for selfishness and impertinence. You haven't advised me yet.\"  \"Tell me first what your plans are?\"  \"Well, first I'm going to find out all I can here in Dorfield about this woman. I'm thinking of staying a few days in that greasy Todgers to get on to her all I can from the standpoint of her fellow boarders.\"  \"Good! Then what?\"  \"Then I'll go on to Atlanta and see what I can see.\"  \"Will you be traveling for your health ostensibly?\"  \"No indeed! I'm going to get a job as saleslady for some kind of household novelty, house-to-house canvass.\"  \"Good. What next?\"  \"When I find out all I want to know I'll come back and tell you about it.\"  \"Fine!\"  \"Any other advice to offer?\" asked Josie, trying to hide a sly little smile. One of her quiet jokes was that Captain Lonsdale always labored under the impression that he gave her advice. Of course, his habit was to applaud her decision, but the kindly police officer really thought Josie's plans of campaign originated with him. She always came to him and he always backed her up. She declared the moral support he gave her was better than the good advice he thought he gave her.  \"Nothing else,\" replied the kind chief. \"But don't run any risks. A man like this Chester Hunt and a woman like this Dink person are often capable of any crime to attain their ends.\"  \"I'll be careful,\" said Josie, \"but I can't promise not to run risks. I don't see what fun there is in the business without some few risks.\"  \"Bless me, child, you are surely your father's own daughter! Pity you weren't a son!\"  \"Pity nothing!\" answered Josie hotly. \"You have plenty of sons on your police force. I should think you'd be glad of an occasional daughter. Slater is a son of somebody and didn't he let the Markles get off? Don't talk to me about sons!\"  \"All right, daughter, never again!\" grinned the chief.  From the police station Josie went back to the Higgledy-Piggledy Shop. She found Elizabeth Wright and Irene attending to business, which was flourishing.  \"We are missing you a lot, but I fancy we can manage,\" said Elizabeth. \"The laundry work is not urgent and if it does become so we shall have to turn it down. I'd do it if I could but I'm the bummest ever.\"  \"Just tell them I'm off on a trip for my health,\" suggested Josie. \"You can call it lungs or heart or just plain head if you'd rather, but I've got to be away for many days.\" She then told the girls all the complications concerning the children who had recently been gent to the home. \"Keep your eyes and ears open for me, but your mouths shut, please. You two girls might pick up a lot to help me out. Now I must transform the plain Josie into a giddy miss after a job selling household and jewel novelties.\"  \"Have you got the job?\" laughed Irene.  \"No, but I'm going to fix up so pretty and talk so silly I'll be sure to get it. There is an ad in the morning paper for canvassers for southern cities.\"  \"Why do you go after that kind of job?\" asked Elizabeth.  \"Because nobody can pick up so much information concerning neighbors as a canvasser.\"  Josie disappeared into her sleeping compartment, packed her suitcase, and in half an hour emerged a changed being. The henna wig again served its turn and her countenance was so made up that her best friends had difficulty in recognizing her. Mary Louise, who came in at that moment, almost had hysterics when the same old Josie spoke from behind that painted mask.  \"I wish I didn't have such a blob of a nose,\" she said ruefully. \"There is mighty little to be done with a nose like mine unless I have paraffin injected under the skin right on top. Of course, I could make it up for the stage from the outside, but not for close inspection. Are my skirts too short for decency?\"  Josie grimaced comically at her friends.  \"No shorter than some we see, but to think of our Josie looking like that!\" gasped Irene. \"Let's see you walk.\"  Josie minced off with a good deal of hip movement according to the fashion of the day.  \"I'd like to wear run-down heels, but I can't afford to ruin my feet. I have a pair of fancy blue and gray shoes I got at a second-hand shop and I'll put those on for dress occasions, but I'll have to wear my own decently sensible shoes when I am at work. I am going to be in town for a few days yet, but won't be staying here but at a swell third-class boarding house on Centre Street. If I should come in here and you have customers do you think you can keep straight faces?\"  \"We'll try!\" giggled the partners.  \"Here comes somebody now,\" cried Elizabeth. \"You'd better hide!\"  But there was no time to hide. The visitors turned out to be Mrs. Wright and a Mrs. Hasbrook, a rich woman who had recently moved to Dorfield, and according to Mrs. Wright's custom she had been among the first to call on the newcomer and now had her in tow telling her where to buy and what to buy. She had conducted her to the Higgledy-Piggledy Shop as a place where her fine damask could be laundered well. Mrs. Wright had recovered from her mortification over Elizabeth's engaging in this strange occupation and now that the shop was proving so successful and so fashionable she was not only reconciled but very proud of her daughter's connection with it and she took every opportunity to come to the shop and to bring others there.  \"Where is Miss O'Gorman?\" demanded Mrs. Wright. \"I want Mrs. Hasbrook to talk with her concerning this work.\"  \"She is not in,\" faltered Elizabeth.  \"Not in! I saw her come in not half an hour ago. Mrs. Hasbrook was having a shampoo just across the street and I certainly saw Miss O'Gorman enter the building and I have not seen her depart.\"  Elizabeth looked hopeless under this relentless questioning of her determined parent. She turned to Josie for help. Josie arose to the occasion with such spirit that Mary Louise and Irene were taken completely off their guard and almost exploded with laughter. With a lisping drawl and a voice none of her friends had ever heard before Josie said:  \"You were going to show me one of those vanity boxes. Miss O'Gorman told me you had some for seven dollars. I met her at the corner about five minutes ago.\"  \"Oh, you did?\" asked Mrs. Wright. \"Well, I fancy I must have looked another way for a moment.\" She glanced curiously at Josie, who returned her stare with the utmost composure.  Elizabeth opened a drawer of vanity boxes and Josie crossed the room to inspect them with an exaggerated walk which reminded Mary Louise of a movie vamp. Again she was moved to laughter and had to pretend to sneeze.  \"I am afraid you have caught cold,\" said Mrs. Wright. \"You must take five grains of aspirin and go to bed. Follow it up with a dose of aromatic spirits of ammonia and let your diet be light.\"  Mary Louise listened politely and Josie made her escape with her suitcase without purchasing the vanity box.    CHAPTER VII JOSIE GETS A JOB  When Josie left the Higgledy-Piggledy Shop, after having hoodwinked Mrs. Wright, she made her way to a small hotel much favored by traveling men. It was the address given by a man who wished to employ a number of young women to travel in the South to introduce a line of household articles as well as some jewel novelties.  \"What experience have you had?\" the man asked her.  \"Plenty of it,\" Josie answered with assurance. \"I tell you, mister, I can sell anything from a baby's rattle to a tombstone. You can ask the girls who run the Higgledy-Piggledy Shop here in Dorfield. Ever hear of them?\"  \"Sure!\"  \"Well, I have a letter here from Miss Josie O'Gorman, who is chief cook and bottle washer 'round there and she will tell you that I am a winner. I tell you Mrs. Danny Dexter and Miss O'Gorman think old Sally Blossom is a peacherino.\"  The man took the letter, which was written on Higgledy-Piggledy paper and in Josie's best handwriting. In it the cleverness of Miss Sally Blossom was lauded to the skies. Josie blushed through her paint as he read it aloud.  \"To think of my having the nerve to say all that about myself!\" flashed through her mind. \"But I bet it lands me my job.\"  It did. Since she was the first to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22532"],["title","Mary Louise and Josie O'Gorman (#7)"],["body","she was given her choice of a field of operations and she chose Atlanta. She gave her address as 126 East Centre and made an engagement with the man to see him the next day to receive instructions and literature concerning her wares. Samples were to be sent to her at Atlanta.  \"Now, having given my address as 126 East Centre, I must hurry over there and apply for board,\" said Josie to herself as she left the hotel.  The group gathered on the porch at 126 East Centre was the same as it had been on the day that Josie had tracked the elusive Dink to her lair. The young men were tilted back in their chairs at the same angle, and the young women were equally taken up with their ear puffs and frizzes. The clientele of 126 was an ever-changing one, but the class characteristics were stationary.  Josie tripped up the steps, assuming a kind of nonchalance as she calmly viewed the loafing boarders. They in turn gazed at her, some with interest and some with open disdain. With the boarders at 126 one must prove herself down to their standards before being accepted into their social order.  \"Stuck up!\" declared one young woman--the one with the most extreme ear puffs of all, the shortest skirt and the highest heels.  \"Oh, I don't know,\" objected a man, removing the toothpick from his mouth and his gaudily socked feet from the railing. \"I think she's some cutey.\"  A snicker of derision answered this sally.  \"With them unstylish low heels? I guess you ain't got below her henna bob,\" snapped the girl, arching her instep and poking out her near-silk clad foot with its high-heeled, dirty, white kid pump.  Josie pulled the bell. It was the old-fashioned kind that must be pulled not pushed. When it was in working order a pull would set a wire in motion through the length of the house to the back entry and there a bell attached to the wire would start such a jangling that someone would come to the front door. This happened when the bell was in order, which was seldom the case at 126. When Josie gave a tug, which was vigorous and somewhat vicious from the embarrassment she could but feel at the overheard remarks, the bell handle with a coil of broken wire spring came limply away, and it was nothing but Josie's training that kept her ever on the alert that saved her from falling backwards.  \"April fool!\" called a grinning youth from the porch.  Josie laughed good-naturedly at her prospective fellow-boarder.  \"Anyhow I know how not to get in,\" she said.  \"'Tain't any trouble to get in this joint,\" ventured a woman. \"There's more goin' than comin'. I'll never send a dog here.\"  \"Oh, 'tain't so bad considering the H. C. of L.,\" put in a middle-aged man in a very tight Shepherd's plaid suit. \"Mrs. Pete feeds us the best she can for the mon.\"  \"Oh, you're sweet on Mrs. Pete,\" laugheed the youth who had called \"April fool\" to Josie.  \"Is Mrs. Pete at home?\" asked Josie, glad to know the name of her future landlady.  \"Sure she's home! Just open the door and walk in. Follow your nose-- there's cabbage to-day so it's easy--right down the hall until you come to some steps. Then fall down the steps to the dining room. If Mrs. Pete ain't there she's in the kitchen next to it.\"  Josie thanked the youth and followed his advice. She found everything as he had told her she would, even to Mrs. Pete in the kitchen. She was hardly prepared for the knock-down odors which greeted her nostrils as she fell down the steps, nor was she prepared for the appearance of Mrs. Pete.  Josie's first thought was: \"How does the woman ever get down those narrow stairs?\" but she realized afterwards that she was of the soft type of fat that could be squeezed into any space. She was bursting from a tight kimono, a garment usually the loosest of all apparel, but Mrs. Pete's arms quite filled the flowing sleeves and although it was drawn tightly around her huge hips the fronts refused to meet but took on the slant of a cutaway coat. There was no expression to her face. It was simply fat. Her eyes looked like raisins in a bun and her mouth had almost disappeared. One tooth projected as though nature had decided that would be the only way to save the mouth from being entirely submerged. Her nose would have been lost had it not been for a wart. She moved lightly and easily, reminding Josie of a balloon with not enough gas in it to soar aloft. She wore a black wig at a rakish angle and a string of huge pink beads were lost and found in the folds of fat of her neck.  \"Well?\" she questioned Josie in a voice that sounded as though she were speaking down an empty hogshead.  \"I want a room and board,\" said Josie.  \"How many in a room?\"  \"I'd like one to myself.\"  \"Humph! You'll have to pay for it then.\"  Josie expressed her willingness and they soon came to terms.  \"It's a room a professional lady has just left, her and two children. I don't usually take children but she engaged the room without letting on there were any kids. She didn't take her meals here regular so I never saw them much. Lord knows what the little things ate because she never brought them down to what few dinners she got here. I'm so fleshy like I never get up on the top floor. Here, Betty, you Betty! Come show this lady the room on the top floor, the one Miss Dingus just left,\" she called to a slouchy colored girl who was washing dishes at the sink.  \"Dinner at half past one,\" boomed the landlady to Josie's back as she followed Betty up the narrow stairs.  \"I ain't ter say cleaned up that there top floor room yit,\" confessed the maid, \"but I'll try ter git it in fust rate fix befo' come night time.\"  \"Oh, that's all right,\" said Josie. \"You just give me some clean sheets and a clean pillow case and I won't mind the rest at all.\"  The room was large, the third floor back, with windows overlooking dingy back yards. Its disorder was astonishing.  \"I didn't know it wa' quite so stirred up as this,\" exclaimed the girl. \"These here, folks ain't many er 'em got no raisin'. They ought ter git bo'd an' lodgin' in a pig pen. I's kinder fussed ter be a showin' you sich a spot. Well,\" she added philosophically: \"What kin you expect from a hog but a grunt?\"  Josie laughed.  \"Never mind, Betty,\" she said, giving the girl a quarter. \"I can manage very well. You go on and finish your dishes and I will make up the bed myself if you get the bed linen.\"  Betty looked at Josie curiously.  \"Say, miss, you belies yo' looks. You got the 'pearance er these here folks but you ain't got they ways. I been wuckin' in this here bo'din house fer three years an' I ain't never had a one of them give me mo'n a dime at a time unless'n it wa' ter git me not to tell Mrs. Pete 'bout some devilment or other they done got in.\"  Josie had not thought it necessary to be other than herself before the colored maid but she took herself severely to task for lowering her guard, even with anyone seemingly so unimportant as Betty.  \"Father used to say that small things were the stumbling blocks of some of the biggest detectives,\" she said to herself. \"I'll try to do better.\"  The grateful Betty returned immediately with clean sheets and pillow slips and one small towel. She then departed to finish her dishwashing.  As soon as she was alone Josie, first taking the precaution of locking the door, began a search in the dirty grate for any papers that might prove of importance to the matter in hand.  The grate was piled high with old torn letters and some had been dumped in without even being mutilated. A match had evidently been applied to the mass of papers but had only charred the corners of the envelopes.  \"Oh what a careless Cousin Dink! Now we will see what we can find,\" whispered Josie.  The girl worked quickly and methodically, sorting out the letters and putting them in neat packets and snapping rubber bands around them. She examined the seemingly worthless accumulation of advertisements and circulars, saving the envelopes wherever the date and postoffice stamp were legible. Every scrap of paper in the heaped fireplace was carefully scrutinized. What she deemed worthless was finally put back, care being taken to pull the mass apart so that the grate seemed to be as full as before.  \"That Betty is too noticing to be careless,\" Josie reflected.  She then sat down by the window and began piecing together the letters Cousin Dink had taken the trouble to tear up.  \"She had a reason for tearing up some and not bothering about others.\"  The ones that were mutilated were all in the same handwriting. Fortunately for Josie's patience they were not torn in very small pieces. Fitting them together was not a difficult task for one so alert and quick fingered as our little detective. In several instances the letter had been torn and the pieces all put back in the envelope. That made plain sailing indeed for the puzzle worker.  These letters that so especially interested our Josie were signed in various ways but always with the same flourish of the pen: \"Yours always, C. H.\" \"Lovingly, Ches.\" \"Hastily, C.\" Several were signed: \"Chester Hunt.\" The letters were a strange mixture of love and business. They commenced sometimes \"Dear Coz:\" sometimes \"My own Dink:\" or \"My own dear girl:\" Always, while they were more or less affectionate, Josie could read between the lines that this Chester Hunt could command Cousin Dink to do as he chose. Whether he controlled her by affection or whether by some other force it was hard to say. Sometimes his tone was frankly impatient but he usually ended up such epistles with repeated assurances of affection. Through the correspondence Josie traced much in regard to Peter and Polly. There was one telegram in which this Chester Hunt had summoned the woman to Atlanta. That was dated about a year before.  \"Come--I need you--C. H.\" That was all.  \"That must have been when she went and got the poor kids,\" Josie decided. \"But there is one thing that is worrying me: why should this Dink have saved all these letters up to this time, and"]]]
