DEVIL'S ASTEROID   by MANLY WADE WELLMAN  [Illustration: _The Rock Bred Evolution in Reverse_]   It was not very large, as asteroids go, but about it clung a silvery mist of atmosphere. Deeper flashes through the mist betokened water, and green patches hinted of rich vegetation. The space-patroller circled the little world knowledgeably, like a wasp buzzing around an apple. In the control room, by the forward ports, the Martian skipper addressed his Terrestrial companion.  \"I wissh you joy of yourr new home,\" he purred. Like many Martians, he was braced upright on his lower tentacles by hoops and buckles around his bladdery body, so that he had roughly a human form, over which lay a strange loose armor of light plates. In the breathing hole of his petal-tufted skull was lodged an artificial voice-box that achieved words. \"I rregrret--\"  Fitzhugh Parr glowered back. He was tall, even for a man of Earth, and his long-jawed young face darkened with wrath. \"Regret nothing,\" he snapped. \"You're jolly glad to drop me on this little hell.\"  \"Hell?\" repeated the Martian reproachfully. \"But it iss a ssplendid miniaturre worrld--nineteen of yourr miless in diameterr, with arrtificial grravity centerr to hold airr and waterr; ssown, too, with Terresstrrial plantss. And companionss of yourr own rrace.\"  [Illustration: _\"You! They drive you out?\" A thick, unsure voice accosted him._]  \"There's a catch,\" rejoined Parr. \"Something you Martian swine think is a heap big joke. I can see that, captain.\"  The tufted head wagged. \"Underr trreaty between Marrs and Earrth, judgess of one planet cannot ssentence to death crriminalss frrom the otherr, not even forr murrderr--\"  \"It wasn't for murder!\" exploded Parr. \"I struck in self-defense!\"  \"I cannot arrgue the point. Yourr victim wass a high official perrhapss inssolent, but you Earrth folk forrget how eassy ourr crraniumss crrack underr yourr blowss. Anyway, you do not die--you arre exiled. Prreparre to dissembarrk.\"  Behind them three Martian space-hands, sprawling like squids near the control-board, made flutelike comments to each other. The tentacle of each twiddled an electro-automatic pistol.  \"Rremove tunic and bootss,\" directed the skipper. \"You will not need them. Quickly, ssirr!\"  Parr glared at the levelled weapons of the space-hands, then shucked his upper garment and kicked off his boots. He stood up straight and lean-muscled, in a pair of duck shorts. His fists clenched at his sides.  \"Now we grround,\" the skipper continued, and even as he spoke there came the shock of the landfall. The inner panel opened, then the outer hatch. Sunlight beat into the chamber. \"Goodbye,\" said the skipper formally. \"You have thirrty ssecondss, Earrth time, to walk clearr of our blasstss beforre we take off. Marrch.\"  Parr strode out upon dark, rich soil. He sensed behind him the silent quiver of Martian laughter, and felt a new ecstasy of hate for his late guards, their race, and the red planet that spawned them. Not until he heard the rumble and swish of the ship's departure did he take note of the little world that was now his prison home.  At first view it wasn't really bad. At second, it wasn't really strange. The sky, by virtue of an Earth-type atmosphere, shone blue with wispy clouds, and around the small plain on which he stood sprouted clumps and thickets of green tropical trees. Heathery ferns, with white and yellow edges to their leaves, grew under his bare feet. The sun, hovering at zenith, gave a July warmth to the air. The narrow horizon was very near, of course, but the variety of thickets and the broken nature of the land beyond kept it from seeming too different from the skyline of Earth. Parr decided that he might learn to endure, even to enjoy. Meanwhile, what about the other Terrestrials exiled here? And, as Parr wondered, he heard their sudden, excited voices.  Threats and oaths rent the balmy air. Through the turmoil resounded solid blows. Parr broke into a run, shoved through some broad-leafed bushes, and found himself in the midst of the excitement.         *       *       *       *       *  A dozen men, with scraggly beards and skimpy rags of clothing, were setting upon an unclassifiable creature that snarled and fought back. It was erect and coarsely hairy--Parr saw that much before the enigma gave up the unequal fight and ran clumsily away into a mass of bright-flowered scrub. Execrations and a volley of sticks and stones speeded its flight.  Then the mob was aware of Parr. Every man--they were all male Terrestrials--turned toward him, with something like respect. One of them, tall and thin, spoke diffidently:  \"You just arrived?\"  \"I was just booted out, ten minutes ago,\" Parr informed him. \"Why?\"  \"Because you're our new chief,\" responded the thin man, bowing. \"The latest comer always commands here.\"  Parr must have goggled, for the thin one smiled through tawny stubble. \"The latest comer is always highest and wisest,\" he elaborated. \"He is healthiest. Best. The longer you stay on this asteroid, the lower you fall.\"  Parr thought he was being joked with, and scowled. But his informant smiled the broader. \"My name's Sadau--here under sentence for theft of Martian government property.\"  \"I'm Fitzhugh Parr. They said I was a murderer. It's a lie.\"  One or two chuckled at that, and the one who called himself Sadau said: \"We all feel unjustly condemned. Meet the others--Jeffords, Wain, Haldocott....\" Each man, as named, bowed to Parr. The final introduction was of a sallow, frowning lump of a fellow called Shanklin.  \"I was boss until you came,\" volunteered this last man. \"Now you take over.\" He waved toward a little cluster of grass huts, half hidden among ferny palms. \"This is our capital city. You get the largest house--until somebody new shows up. Then you step down, like me.\"  He spoke with ill grace. Parr did not reply at once, but studied these folk who were putting themselves under his rule. They would not have been handsome even if shaved and dressed properly. Indeed, two or three had the coarse, low-browed look of profound degenerates. Back into Parr's mind came the words of Sadau: \"The longer you stay ... the lower you fall.\"  \"Gentlemen,\" said Parr at last, \"before I accept command or other office, give me information. Just now you were acting violently. You, Sadau, started explaining. Go ahead.\"  Sadau shrugged a lean freckled shoulder, and with a jerk of his head directed his companions to retire toward the huts. They obeyed, with one or two backward glances. Left alone with Parr, Sadau looked up with a wise, friendly expression.  \"I won't waste time trying to be scientific or convincing. I'll give you facts--we older exiles know them only too well. This asteroid seems a sort of Eden to you, I daresay.\"  \"I told the Martians that I knew there was a catch somewhere.\"  \"Your instinct's sound. The catch is this: Living creatures--Terrestrials anyway--degenerate here. They go backward in evolution, become--\" Sadau broke off a moment, for his lips had begun to quiver. \"They become beasts,\" he finished.  \"What?\" growled Parr. \"You mean that men turn into apes?\"  \"Yes. And the apes turn into lower creatures. Those become lower creatures still.\" Sadau's eyes were earnest and doleful. \"The process may run back and down to the worm, for all we can judge. We try not to think too much about it.\"  \"This is a joke of some kind,\" protested Parr, but Sadau was not smiling.  \"Martian joke, perhaps. The treaty keeps them from killing us--and this is their alternative punishment. It makes death trivial by comparison.... You don't believe. It's hard. But you see that some of us, oldest in point of exile, are sliding back into bestiality. And you saw us drive away, as our custom is, a man who had definitely become a beast.\"  \"That thing was a man?\" prompted Parr, his spine chilling.  \"It had been a man. As you wander here and there, you'll come upon queer sights--sickening ones.\"  Parr squinted at the huts, around the doors of which lounged the other men. \"That looks like a permanent community, Sadau.\"  \"It is, but the population's floating. I came here three months ago--Earth months--and the place was operating under the rules I outlined. Latest comer, necessarily the highest-grade human being, to be chief; those who degenerate beyond a certain point to be driven out; the rest to live peaceably together, helping each other.\"  Parr only half heard him. \"Evolution turned backward--it can't be true. It's against nature.\"  \"Martians war against nature,\" replied Sadau pithily. \"Mars is a dead world, and its people are devils. They'd be the logical explorers to find a place where such things can be, and to make use of it. Don't believe me if you don't want to. Time and life here will convince you.\"         *       *       *       *       *  In the days that followed--the asteroid turned once in approximately twenty-two hours--Parr was driven to belief. Perhaps the slowness of the idea's dawning kept him from some form of insanity.  Every man of the little group that called him chief was on the way to be a man no more. There were stooped backs among them, a forward hang to arms, a sprouting of coarse, lank hair. Foreheads fell away, noses flattened coarsely, eyes grew small and shifty. Sadau informed Parr that such evidences of degeneration meant a residence of a year or so on the exile asteroid.  \"We'll be driving one or two of them away pretty soon,\" he observed.  \"What then?\" asked Parr. \"What happens to the ones that are driven out?\"  \"Sometimes we notice them, peering through the brush, but mostly they haul out by themselves a little way from here--shaggy brutes, like our earliest fathers. There are lower types still. They stay completely clear of us.\"  Parr asked the question that had haunted him"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22538"],["title","The Devil's Asteroid (#1)"],["body","his first hour of exile: \"Sadau, do you see any change in me?\"  Sadau smiled and shook his head. \"You won't alter in the least for a month.\"  That was reasonable. Man, Parr remembered, has been pretty much the same for the past ten thousand years. If a year brought out the beast in the afflicted exiles, then that year must count for a good hundred thousand years turned backward. Five years would be five hundred thousand of reverse evolution--in that time, one would be reduced to something definitely animal. Beyond that, one would drop into the category of tailed monkeys, of rodent crawlers--reptiles next, and then--  \"I'll kill myself first,\" he thought, but even as he made the promise he knew he would not. Cowards took the suicide way out, the final yielding to unjust, cruel mastery by the Martians. Parr stiffened his shoulders, that had grown tanned and vigorous in the healthy air. He spoke grimly to Sadau:  \"I don't accept all this yet. It's happened to others, but not to me so far. There's a way of stopping this, and paying off those Martian swine. If it can be done--\"  \"I'm with you, Chief!\" cried Sadau, and they shook hands.  Heartened, he made inquiries. The Martian space-patroller came every month or so, to drop a new exile. It always landed on the plain where Parr had first set foot to the asteroid. That gave him an idea, and he held conference in the early evening, with Sadau, Shanklin, and one or two others of the higher grade.  \"We could capture that craft,\" urged Parr. \"There's only a skipper and three Martians--\"  \"Yes, with pistols and ray throwers,\" objected Shanklin. \"Too big a risk.\"  \"What's the alternative?\" demanded Sadau. \"You want to stay here and turn monkey, Shanklin? Chief,\" he added to Parr, \"I said once that I was on your side. I'll follow wherever you lead.\"  \"Me, too,\" threw in Jeffords, a sturdy man of middle age who had been sentenced for killing a Martian in a brawl.  \"And me,\" wound up Haldocott, a blond youth whose skin was burned darker than his hair and downy beard. \"We four can pull it off without Shanklin.\"  But Shanklin agreed, with something like good humor, to stand by the vote of the majority. The others of the community assented readily, for they were used to acting at the will of their wiser companions. And at the next arrival of the Martian patroller--an observer, posted by Parr in a treetop, reported its coming whole hours away--they made a quick disposal of forces around the rocket-scorched plain that did duty for a landing field. Parr consulted for a last moment with Sadau, Shanklin, Jeffords and Haldocott.  \"We'll lead rushes from different directions,\" he said. \"As the hatchway comes open, the patroller will stall for the moment--can't take off until it's airtight everywhere. I'll give a yell for signal. Then everybody charge. Jam the tubes by smacking the soft metal collars at the nozzles--we can straighten them back when the ship's ours. Out to your places now.\"  \"The first one at the hatch will probably be shot or rayed,\" grumbled Shanklin.  \"I'll be first there,\" Parr promised him. \"Who wants to live forever, anyway? Posts, everybody. Here she comes in.\"  Tense, quick-breathing moments thereafter as the craft descended and lodged. Then the hatchway opened. Parr, crouching in a clump of bushes with two followers, raised his voice in a battle yell, and rushed.  A figure had come forward to the open hatch, slender and topped with tawny curls. It paused and shrank back at the sudden apparition of Parr and his men leaping forward. Tentacles swarmed out, trying to push or pull the figure aside so as to close the hatch again. That took more seconds--then Parr had crossed the intervening space. Without even looking at the newcoming exile who had so providentially forestalled the closing of the hatch, he clutched a shoulder and heaved mightily. The Martian whose tentacles had reached from within came floundering out, dragged along--it was the skipper whose ironic acquaintance Parr had made in his own voyage out, all dressed in that loose-plate armor. Parr wrenched a pistol from a tentacle. Yelling again, he fired through the open hatchway. Two space-hands ducked out of sight.  \"We've won!\" yelled Parr, and for a moment he thought they had. But not all his followers had charged with his own bold immediacy.  Sadau on one side of the ship, Jeffords and Haldocott at the other, had run in close and were walloping manfully at the nozzles of the rocket tubes. The outer metal yielded under the blows, threatening to clog the throats of the blasts. Only at the rear was there no attack--Shanklin, and with him three or four of the lesser men, had hung back. The few moments' delay there was enough to make all the difference.  Thinking and acting wisely, even without a leader, the Martian space-hands met the emergency. They had withdrawn from the open hatchway, but could reach the mechanism that closed it. Parr was too late to jump in after them. Then one of them fired the undamaged rear tubes.  _Swish! Whang!_ The ship took off so abruptly that Parr barely dodged aside in time, dragging along with him the new Terrestrial whose shoulder he clutched, and also the surprised Martian skipper. The rocket blasts, dragging fiery fingers across the plain, struck down Haldocott and Jeffords, and bowled over two of the laggards with Shanklin's belated contingent. Then it was away, moving jumpily with its half-wrecked side tubes, but nevertheless escaping.  Parr swore a great oath, that made the stranger gasp. And then Parr had time to see that this was a woman, and young. She was briefly dressed in blouse and shorts, her tawny hair was tumbled, her blue eyes wide. To her still clung the Martian skipper, and Parr covered him with the captured pistol. Next instant Shanklin, arriving at last, struck out with his club and shattered the flowerlike cranium inside the plated cap. The skipper fell dead on the spot.  \"I wanted him for a prisoner!\" growled Parr.  \"What good would that do?\" flung back Shanklin roughly. \"The ship's what we wanted. It's gone. You bungled, Parr.\"  Parr was about to reply with the obvious charge that Shanklin's own hesitancy had done much to cause the failure, when Sadau spoke:  \"This young lady--miss, are you an exile? Because,\" and he spoke in the same fashion that he had once employed to Parr, \"then you're our new chief. The latest comer commands.\"  \"Why--why--\" stammered the girl.  \"Wait a minute,\" interposed Parr again. \"Let's take stock of ourselves. Haldocott and Jeffords killed--and a couple of others--\"  Shanklin barked at him. \"You don't give orders any more. We've got a new chief, and you're just one of the rabble, like me.\" He made a heavily gallant bow toward the latest arrival. \"May I ask your name, lady?\"  \"I'm Varina Pemberton,\" she said. \"But what's the meaning of all this?\"  Shanklin and Sadau began to explain. The others gathered interestedly around. Parr felt suddenly left out, and stooped to look at the dead Martian. The body wore several useful things--a belt with ammunition and a knife-combination, shoes on the thickened ends of the tentacles, and that strange armor. As Parr moved to retrieve these, his companions called out to halt him.  \"The new chief will decide about those things,\" said Shanklin officiously. \"Especially the gun. Can I have it?\"  To avoid a crisis, Parr passed the weapon to the girl, who nodded thanks and slid it into her own waist-belt. Shanklin asked for, and received, the knife. Sadau was the only man slender enough to wear the shoes, and gratefully donned them. Parr looked once again at the armor, which he had drawn free of its dead owner.  \"What's that for?\" asked Shanklin.  Parr made no answer, because he did not know. The armor was too loosely hung together for protection against weapons. It certainly was no space-overall. And it had nothing of the elegance that might make it a Martian uniform of office. Casting back, Parr remembered that the skipper had worn it at the time when he, Parr, was landed--but not during the voyage out. He shook his head over the mystery.  \"Let that belong to you,\" the girl Varina Pemberton was telling him. \"It has plates of metal that may be turned to use. Perhaps--\" She seemed to be on the verge of saying something important, but checked herself.  \"If you'll come with us,\" Sadau told her respectfully, \"we'll show you where we live and where you will rule.\"         *       *       *       *       *  They held council that night among the grass huts--the nine that were left after the unsuccessful attack on the patroller. Varina Pemberton, very pretty in her brief sports costume, sat on the stump that was chief's place; but Shanklin did most of the talking.  \"Nobody will argue about our life and prospects being good here,\" he thundered, \"but there's no use in making things worse when they're bad enough.\" He shook a thick forefinger at Fitzhugh Parr, who wore the armor he had stripped from the dead Martian. \"You were chief, and what you said goes. But you're not chief now--you're just the man who murdered four of us!\"  \"Mmm--yes,\" growled one of the lower-fallen listeners, a furry-shouldered, buck-toothed clod named Wain. \"That blast almost got me, right behind Haldocott.\" His eyes, grown small, gleamed nastily at Parr. \"We ought to condemn this man--\"  \"Please,\" interposed Sadau, who alone remained friendly to Parr, \"it's for the chief to condemn.\" He looked to Varina Pemberton, who shook her head slowly.  \"I feel,\" she ventured with her eyes on Parr, \"that this ought to be left up to you as a voting body.\"  Shanklin sprang to his feet. \"Fair enough!\" he bawled. \"I call Parr guilty. All who think like me, say aye!\"  \"Aye!\"  \"Aye!\"  \"Aye!\"  They were all agreeing except Sadau, who looked shrunken and sad and frightened. Shanklin smirked.  \"All who think he should be killed as a murderer--\"  \"Hold on,\" put in Varina Pemberton. \"If I'm chief, I'll draw the line there. Don't kill him.\""]]]
