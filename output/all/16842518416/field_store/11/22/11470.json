Colonna, who was a contemporary of Stradella, but not so famous, has left one oratorio, \"St. Basil,\" which is highly praised. Bononcini also, who afterwards became a rival of Handel in England, wrote several oratorios before he went to that country, the best of which is entitled \"San Girolamo della Carità.\"  The conclusion of this period brings us to the second stage in the evolution of the oratorio; namely, the passion-music, which may be regarded as the connecting link between the earlier form as developed by the Italian composers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and the oratorio as it appeared after it had felt the mighty influence of Handel. The  passion-music was the direct outgrowth of the passion-play. It portrayed the passion of Christ. Its earliest forms are found in the \"Passio secundum Matthæum\" by Stephani, a Nuremberg composer who flourished in the sixteenth century; in a hymn-book published in 1573 by Keuchental; and in Selenica's hymn-book, which appeared in 1587. Heinrich Schütz, however, was the first to establish the passion-music in genuine oratorio form. He was born in 1585, and died in 1672. The pupil of an Italian master, the famous Gabrielli of Venice, he retained the Italian forms, but added to them his native German force and solidity. His most prominent work, \"Die Auferstehung Christi,\" first performed at Dresden in 1623, where he was chapel-master to the Elector George I., is regarded as the foundation of the German oratorio. The passion-music was usually assigned to three priests, one of whom recited or intoned the part of Jesus, the second that of the evangelist, and the third the other parts, while the chorus served for the \"turbæ,\" or people. In Schütz's music, however, the narrative is given to a chorus of evangelists, the accompaniment being performed by four viole di gamba and organ. There is also a wide departure from all his predecessors in the entire absence of dramatic action. His first work was followed by another, entitled \"Die sieben Worte Christi\" (\"The Seven Words of Christ\"),--a subject which Haydn subsequently treated with powerful effect,--and four different compositions on the passion of our Lord. In these works are to be found the real germs of the modern oratorio; they were preparing the way for Handel and Bach. Johann Sebastiani succeeded Schütz, and in 1672 published a passion-music, in which the narrative appears in recitative form and solidly harmonized chorales are used,--with this peculiarity, that only the treble was sung, the other voices being taken by the strings. In 1673 still another passion, written by Theile, was produced at Lübeck. From this time until 1704 there appears to be a gap in the sequence of works of this kind.  In the latter year, however, two more were produced, which made a sensation all over Germany, \"The Bleeding and Dying Jesus,\" by Reinhard Keiser, and the \"Passion nach Cap. 19 S. Johannis\" by Handel. In the former, cantatas were substituted for the narrative and chorales, one of the numbers being in the nature of a love-song,--an innovation upon the established forms which brought down upon the composer the indignation of the critics both in the pulpit and out of it. The passion-music of Handel was but a weak prelude to the colossal works which were to follow from his pen. Between 1705 and 1718 several other passions appeared, written by Keiser, Handel, Telemann, and Mattheson, preparing the way for the two composers who above all others were destined to develop the chorale and make it not only the foundation, but the all-pervading idea of their passions; they were Carl Heinrich Graun and Johann Sebastian Bach. The former's greatest work, \"Der Tod Jesu,\" was produced in Berlin in 1755, and was a revelation in the matter of chorale treatment. Nothing which had preceded it could equal it in musical skill or artistic handling. But there was one coming greater than Graun, the father of modern music, Johann Sebastian Bach. \"If all the music written since Bach's time should be lost,\" says Gounod, \"it could be reconstructed on the foundations which he laid.\" Besides his \"Christmas Oratorio,\" Bach wrote five passion oratorios, two of which, the \"St. John\" and \"St. Matthew,\" have been published and are still performed. Of these two, the \"St. Matthew\" was conceived on the grander scale. In this sublime masterpiece, the early oratorio reached its highest form in Germany. It contains a narration delivered by an evangelist, solo parts for the principal characters, arias, choruses, double choruses, and chorales, the congregation joining in the latter, in which the composer not only reveals an astonishing dramatic power in the expression of sentiment and the adaptation of his music to the feeling and situation of the characters, but also a depth and accuracy of musical skill and invention which have been the despair of composers from that time to this.  With Bach, the passion-music accomplished its purpose, and we now enter upon the third and last stage of the evolution of oratorio. It is a new form, and the change leads us to a new country. We have examined the sacred dramas, with their musical setting, in Italy, and the passion-music in Germany; and now comes the oratorio in England,--the oratorio as we know it and hear it to-day. Handel was its great originator. He began his English career as an operatic writer; but he soon tired of setting music to the trivial subjects so common in opera, which, as he himself declared, were not suited to a composer advancing in years. There were other inducements, however, which led him to turn to the oratorio, and among them one of the most powerful unquestionably was his disgust with the cabals which were organized against him by Italian rivals. \"Esther\" was his first English oratorio, and it made a great success. It was followed by \"Deborah\" and \"Athalia.\" His vigorous dramatic power and close musical scholarship were never more apparent than in these works. They aroused such an enthusiasm that from this time forth (1737) he devoted himself exclusively to this species of composition. He wrote in all seventeen English oratorios. In 1739 he produced \"Saul,\" one of the most dramatic of his sacred works, and the colossal \"Israel in Egypt.\" In 1741 he began \"The Messiah,\" the most sublime of all his oratorios and one of the profoundest works of human genius in music. It still holds its place upon the stage as one of the grandest expressions of human aspiration and divine truth, and no Christmas is complete without its performance. Other works followed it, among them \"Samson,\" \"Joseph,\" \"Belshazzar,\" \"Judas Maccabæus,\" \"Joshua,\" and \"Theodora,\" which Handel considered his best work; but none of them equalled \"The Messiah,\" in which his genius reached its climax. Of those last named, only \"Samson\" and \"Judas Maccabæus\" still hold their place in the modern repertory, though the other oratorios mentioned contain many of his most effective numbers.  While Handel was writing in England, the oratorio languished in Germany. Hasse, Porpora, and Fux produced several oratorios, but they have not left an impression upon the world. Handel died in 1759. It was not until 1798 that a successor appeared worthy to wear his mantle. That successor was Joseph Haydn, whose greatest work, \"The Creation,\" rivals \"The Messiah\" in its popularity. He was in his seventieth year when he produced it, as well as his delightful work, \"The Seasons;\" but \"Papa\" Haydn, as his countrymen love to call him, preserved the freshness of youth to the very last. The melodies of his old age are as delicious as those of his youth. Both these oratorios are exquisite pictures of nature, as well as of human and divine love. They were inspired by Handel's oratorios (which he heard for the first time when he visited London in 1791), and when first performed aroused as great enthusiasm, though they are not cast in the same heroic mould as are \"The Messiah\" and \"Israel in Egypt.\" They are characterized rather by grace, sweetness, and elegance of form, and by pure, healthy music. Haydn was a master of instrumentation, as he had shown years before in the string quartet, of which he was the creator, and in his almost innumerable symphonies,--he being the originator of the modern symphony. He had had the advantage of a magnificent orchestra while in service at Prince Esterhazy's, and the results are seen in the orchestral resources which he employs in his oratorios. During this period several Italian oratorios by Salieri, Zingarelli, and Cimarosa appeared, as well as oratorios in the same style by the German composers Himmel and Winter. In 1803 Beethoven wrote his only oratorio, \"Christ on the Mount of Olives.\" This production has not attained to the popularity of his instrumental works or of his single opera, \"Fidelio,\" in part because it is not in pure oratorio form, and in part because of its wretched libretto. Schubert, contemporary with Beethoven, also undertook an oratorio on the subject of \"Lazarus;\" but it was never completed, and the fragment even was not heard until 1863.  The first really successful oratorio of the present century was \"Das jüngste Gericht\" (\"The Last Judgment\"), by Spohr, which was produced under his own supervision at Erfurt in 1812. This oratorio, however, the work of his earlier years, was but the prelude to his masterpiece, \"Die letzten Dinge\" (\"The Last Things\"), which is now commonly known as \"The Last Judgment,\" and was first performed at Cassel in 1826. Nine years later he brought out \"Des Heiland's letzte Stunden\" (\"The Saviour's Last Hours,\" now known as \"Calvary\"), and still later, \"The Fall of Babylon,\" which he produced for the first time in England in 1843; but neither of these are constructed upon the grand proportions which characterize \"Die letzten Dinge,\" or so well illustrate the profound musical knowledge of the great violinist."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22793"],["title","The Standard Oratorios: Their Stories, Their Music, And Their Composers (#3)"],["body","with Spohr was Schneider, an unusually prolific writer, who produced no less than sixteen oratorios in a period of twenty-eight years, in addition to a large number of operas. Though his oratorios were very popular at the time, but one of them has survived, the \"Weltgericht,\" written in 1819. Among other contemporaries were Lindpaintner, whose \"Abraham\" was very successful,--though this composer is now remembered only by his orchestral pieces,--and Klein, who brought out two oratorios, \"Jephthah\" (1828) and \"David\" (1830), which were greatly admired, though they are now almost unknown.  Spohr had easily held his place in the first rank of the oratorio composers of his time, but was eclipsed when Mendelssohn appeared, as were all his contemporaries. This gifted composer had studied Handel and Bach very closely. In 1829 he brought out the latter's \"St. Matthew\" passion-music after it had lain concealed for an entire century. He aroused enthusiasm for the two old masters both in Germany and England. His \"St. Paul,\" first produced at Düsseldorf in 1836, was greeted with acclamations of enthusiasm, and still holds its place in the popular regard. Ten years later his greatest work, \"Elijah,\" was performed in England. Though widely different in form and treatment from \"The Messiah,\" it shares equally with that work in the enjoyment of popular favor. Its numbers are almost as familiar as household words, through constant repetition not only upon the oratorio stage, but in the concert-room and choir-loft. In the presentation of the personalities concerned in the progress of the work, in descriptive power, in the portrayal of emotion and passion, and in genuine lyrical force, \"Elijah\" has many of the attributes of opera, and some critics have not hesitated to call it a sacred opera. Indeed, there can be no question that with costume, scenery, and the aids of general stage-setting, its effect would be greatly enhanced. Mendelssohn began still a third oratorio, \"Christus,\" but did not live to complete it. His \"Lobgesang\" (\"Hymn of Praise\"), a symphony-cantata, is usually given as an oratorio, though it is not in the genuine oratorio form. Contemporary with him and since his death numerous oratorios have been written, more or less inspired by his work; but \"Elijah\" and \"St. Paul\" still remain unsurpassed. Robert Schumann gave the world a delightful oratorio with a secular subject, \"Paradise and the Peri.\" Numerous English composers have produced meritorious works, among them Sterndale Bennett, whose \"Woman of Samaria\" is thoroughly devotional. In Germany, Hiller, Rheinthaler, and others have made successful essays in this form of musical art. In France, Massenet and Saint-Saëns have written short one-part oratorios, and Gounod has constructed two, \"The Redemption\" and \"Mors et Vita,\" upon the old classical form, so far as division is concerned, and is now at work upon a third, of which Joan of Arc is the theme. In \"The Tower of Babel\" and \"Paradise Lost,\" Rubinstein has given us works which are certainly larger in design than the cantata, and are entitled to be called oratorios. In our own country, Professor Paine, of Harvard University, has written one oratorio, \"St. Peter,\" which commands attention for its scholarly work and musical treatment. Mendelssohn and Spohr, however, represent the nineteenth century of oratorio as Haydn, Handel, and Bach did the eighteenth. Who will take the next step forward in the twentieth, and give to this noblest form of musical art still higher expression?  Before closing this sketch, it will not be out of place to refer briefly to the Requiem, Te Deum, Stabat Mater, and Magnificat, since illustrations of these musical forms appear in the body of the work. \"Requiem\" is the name given to the \"Missa pro Defunctis\" (\"Mass for the Dead\"), and comes from the first word of the Introit, \"Requiem æternam dona eis, Domine.\" Its musical divisions are as follows: (1) Introit; (2) the Kyrie; (3) the Gradual and Tract,--\"Requiem æternam\" and \"Absolve Domine;\" (4) the Sequence or Prose,--\"Dies Iræ;\" (5) Offertorium; (6) Sanctus; (7) Benedictus; (8) Agnus Dei; (9) Communio,--\"Lux æterna.\" The most famous requiems are Palestrina's, written for five voices, but left incomplete (1595); Vittoria's, for six voices, written for the funeral of the Empress Marie, widow of Maximilian II. (1605); Colonna's, for eight voices (1684); Mozart's great masterpiece (1791); Cherubini's in C minor, written for the anniversary of the death of Louis XVI., 1793, and a second for three male voices (1836); Berlioz's \"Messe des Morts;\" Verdi's \"Manzoni Requiem,\" and Brahms' \"German Requiem.\" Though an integral part of the Roman service, appointed for a special day in commemoration of the dead, the Requiem is also employed for the anniversaries of distinguished persons who have passed away, as well as for funeral occasions.  The Stabat Mater, or Lamentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the well-known Latin hymn on the Crucifixion, is one of the most familiar numbers in the Roman Missal. It is appointed to be sung at High Mass on the Friday in Passion Week, and also on the third Sunday in September. On Thursday in Holy Week it is also sung in the Sistine Chapel as an Offertorium. The poem was written by the monk Jacobus de Benedictis in the thirteenth century, and is regarded as one of the finest of mediæval sacred lyrics. Grove says of it: \"Several readings are extant; the one most frequently set to music being that which immediately preceded its last revision in the Roman Office-Books. There are also at least four distinct versions of its plain-chant melody, apart from minor differences attributable to local usage.\" It has always been a favorite hymn with the composers. The most famous settings are those of Josquin des Prés; two by Palestrina,--the first, which is the most effective, for a double choir of eight voices, and the second for a triple choir of twelve voices; that by Pergolesi for soprano and contralto; Haydn's, which is in his peculiarly melodious style; Steffani's for six voices; those by Clari, Astorga, Winter, Racimondi, Vito, Lanza, Inzenga, and Neukomm; Rossini's, which is the best known of all; and Dvorák's, written in 1881, which is one of the Bohemian composer's finest efforts. Few hymns have been so variously treated, and, it may be added, few in the Roman service are more popular.  The \"Te Deum Laudamus\" is another familiar hymn. Its origin is doubtful, though it is usually credited to Saint Ambrose. L'Estrange, in his \"Alliance of Divine Offices,\" says: \"The Te Deum was made by a bishop of Triers, named Nicetius, or Nicettus, about the year 500, which was almost a century after the death both of Saint Ambrose and Saint Augustine.\" Bingham, in his \"Antiquities of the Church,\" says: \"The Benedictines, who published the works of Saint Ambrose, judge him not to have been the author of it; and Dr. Cave, though at one time he was of a different judgment, and Bishop Stillingfleet, concur in the opinion that the Te Deum was not the composition of Saint Ambrose, or of him and Saint Augustine jointly.\" Hawkins also says: \"The zeal of Saint Ambrose to promote psalm-singing is in nothing more conspicuous than in his endeavors to reduce it into form and method; as a proof whereof, it is said that he, jointly with Saint Augustine, upon occasion of the conversion and baptism of the latter, composed the hymn Te Deum Laudamus, which even now makes a part of the liturgy of our Church, and caused it to be sung in his church at Milan. But this has been discovered to be a mistake. This, however, is certain,--that he instituted that method of singing known by the name of the Cantus Ambrosianus, or Ambrosian Chant, a name, for aught that now appears, not applicable to any determined series of notes, but invented to express in general a method of singing agreeable to some rule given or taught by him.\" In spite of controversy, however, the Te Deum is still and will always be known as the \"Ambrosian Hymn.\" The original melody is very ancient, but not so old as the hymn itself. It is thoroughly familiar in the Roman Church, though the number of settings for Church use is almost endless. The early composers harmonized it in various forms. It has also borne a conspicuous part on festival occasions. The most celebrated Te Deums of this character, arranged for solos, chorus, organ, and orchestra, are those of Sarti, to commemorate Prince Potemkin's victory at Otchakous; of Graun, to celebrate the battle of Prague; of Berlioz, for two choirs; of Purcell, for St. Cecilia's Day; of Dr. Blow and Dr. Croft, with accompaniments of two violins, two trumpets, and bass; and the magnificent Utrecht and Dettingen Te Deums of Handel. Among those by contemporary writers are Macfarren's, written in 1884, and Sullivan's, commemorating the recovery of the Prince of Wales.  The Magnificat, or Song of the Virgin, is part of the vesper service of the Church, and has been treated by all the old Church composers of prominence both in plain chant and in polyphonic form. In the English cathedral service it is often richly harmonized, and Bach, Mozart, Handel, Mendelssohn and others have set it in oratorio style with complete orchestral accompaniment.
