In view of all this uncertainty we may well inquire what it has been called in the past.[211]  {57}  As already stated, the Hindus called it _['s][=u]nya_, \"void.\"[212] This passed over into the Arabic as _a[s.]-[s.]ifr_ or _[s.]ifr_.[213] When Leonard of Pisa (1202) wrote upon the Hindu numerals he spoke of this character as _zephirum_.[214] Maximus Planudes (1330), writing under both the Greek and the Arabic influence, called it _tziphra_.[215] In a treatise on arithmetic written in the Italian language by Jacob of Florence[216] {58} (1307) it is called _zeuero_,[217] while in an arithmetic of Giovanni di Danti of Arezzo (1370) the word appears as _çeuero_.[218] Another form is _zepiro_,[219] which was also a step from _zephirum_ to zero.[220]  Of course the English _cipher_, French _chiffre_, is derived from the same Arabic word, _a[s.]-[s.]ifr_, but in several languages it has come to mean the numeral figures in general. A trace of this appears in our word _ciphering_, meaning figuring or computing.[221] Johann Huswirt[222] uses the word with both meanings; he gives for the tenth character the four names _theca, circulus, cifra_, and _figura nihili_. In this statement Huswirt probably follows, as did many writers of that period, the _Algorismus_ of Johannes de Sacrobosco (c. 1250 A.D.), who was also known as John of Halifax or John of Holywood. The commentary of {59} Petrus de Dacia[223] (c. 1291 A.D.) on the _Algorismus vulgaris_ of Sacrobosco was also widely used. The widespread use of this Englishman's work on arithmetic in the universities of that time is attested by the large number[224] of MSS. from the thirteenth to the seventeenth century still extant, twenty in Munich, twelve in Vienna, thirteen in Erfurt, several in England given by Halliwell,[225] ten listed in Coxe's _Catalogue of the Oxford College Library_, one in the Plimpton collection,[226] one in the Columbia University Library, and, of course, many others.  From _a[s.]-[s.]ifr _has come _zephyr, cipher,_ and finally the abridged form _zero_. The earliest printed work in which is found this final form appears to be Calandri's arithmetic of 1491,[227] while in manuscript it appears at least as early as the middle of the fourteenth century.[228] It also appears in a work, _Le Kadran des marchans_, by Jehan {60} Certain,[229] written in 1485. This word soon became fairly well known in Spain[230] and France.[231] The medieval writers also spoke of it as the _sipos_,[232] and occasionally as the _wheel_,[233] _circulus_[234] (in German _das Ringlein_[235]), _circular {61} note_,[236] _theca_,[237] long supposed to be from its resemblance to the Greek theta, but explained by Petrus de Dacia as being derived from the name of the iron[238] used to brand thieves and robbers with a circular mark placed on the forehead or on the cheek. It was also called _omicron_[239] (the Greek _o_), being sometimes written õ or [Greek: ph] to distinguish it from the letter _o_. It also went by the name _null_[240] (in the Latin books {62} _nihil_[241] or _nulla_,[242] and in the French _rien_[243]), and very commonly by the name _cipher_.[244] Wallis[245] gives one of the earliest extended discussions of the various forms of the word, giving certain other variations worthy of note, as _ziphra_, _zifera_, _siphra_, _ciphra_, _tsiphra_, _tziphra,_ and the Greek [Greek: tziphra].[246]         *       *       *       *       *   {63}  CHAPTER V  THE QUESTION OF THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NUMERALS INTO EUROPE BY BOETHIUS  Just as we were quite uncertain as to the origin of the numeral forms, so too are we uncertain as to the time and place of their introduction into Europe. There are two general theories as to this introduction. The first is that they were carried by the Moors to Spain in the eighth or ninth century, and thence were transmitted to Christian Europe, a theory which will be considered later. The second, advanced by Woepcke,[247] is that they were not brought to Spain by the Moors, but that they were already in Spain when the Arabs arrived there, having reached the West through the Neo-Pythagoreans. There are two facts to support this second theory: (1) the forms of these numerals are characteristic, differing materially from those which were brought by Leonardo of Pisa from Northern Africa early in the thirteenth century (before 1202 A.D.); (2) they are essentially those which {64} tradition has so persistently assigned to Boethius (c. 500 A.D.), and which he would naturally have received, if at all, from these same Neo-Pythagoreans or from the sources from which they derived them. Furthermore, Woepcke points out that the Arabs on entering Spain (711 A.D.) would naturally have followed their custom of adopting for the computation of taxes the numerical systems of the countries they conquered,[248] so that the numerals brought from Spain to Italy, not having undergone the same modifications as those of the Eastern Arab empire, would have differed, as they certainly did, from those that came through Bagdad. The theory is that the Hindu system, without the zero, early reached Alexandria (say 450 A.D.), and that the Neo-Pythagorean love for the mysterious and especially for the Oriental led to its use as something bizarre and cabalistic; that it was then passed along the Mediterranean, reaching Boethius in Athens or in Rome, and to the schools of Spain, being discovered in Africa and Spain by the Arabs even before they themselves knew the improved system with the place value.  {65}  A recent theory set forth by Bubnov[249] also deserves mention, chiefly because of the seriousness of purpose shown by this well-known writer. Bubnov holds that the forms first found in Europe are derived from ancient symbols used on the abacus, but that the zero is of Hindu origin. This theory does not seem tenable, however, in the light of the evidence already set forth.  Two questions are presented by Woepcke's theory: (1) What was the nature of these Spanish numerals, and how were they made known to Italy? (2) Did Boethius know them?  The Spanish forms of the numerals were called the _[h.]ur[=u]f al-[.g]ob[=a]r_, the [.g]ob[=a]r or dust numerals, as distinguished from the _[h.]ur[=u]f al-jumal_ or alphabetic numerals. Probably the latter, under the influence of the Syrians or Jews,[250] were also used by the Arabs. The significance of the term [.g]ob[=a]r is doubtless that these numerals were written on the dust abacus, this plan being distinct from the counter method of representing numbers. It is also worthy of note that Al-B[=i]r[=u]n[=i] states that the Hindus often performed numerical computations in the sand. The term is found as early as c. 950, in the verses of an anonymous writer of Kairw[=a]n, in Tunis, in which the author speaks of one of his works on [.g]ob[=a]r calculation;[251] and, much later, the Arab writer Ab[=u] Bekr Mo[h.]ammed ibn `Abdall[=a]h, surnamed al-[H.]a[s.][s.][=a]r {66} (the arithmetician), wrote a work of which the second chapter was \"On the dust figures.\"[252]  The [.g]ob[=a]r numerals themselves were first made known to modern scholars by Silvestre de Sacy, who discovered them in an Arabic manuscript from the library of the ancient abbey of St.-Germain-des-Prés.[253] The system has nine characters, but no zero. A dot above a character indicates tens, two dots hundreds, and so on, [5 with dot] meaning 50, and [5 with 3 dots] meaning 5000. It has been suggested that possibly these dots, sprinkled like dust above the numerals, gave rise to the word _[.g]ob[=a]r_,[254] but this is not at all probable. This system of dots is found in Persia at a much later date with numerals quite like the modern Arabic;[255] but that it was used at all is significant, for it is hardly likely that the western system would go back to Persia, when the perfected Hindu one was near at hand.  At first sight there would seem to be some reason for believing that this feature of the [.g]ob[=a]r system was of {67} Arabic origin, and that the present zero of these people,[256] the dot, was derived from it. It was entirely natural that the Semitic people generally should have adopted such a scheme, since their diacritical marks would suggest it, not to speak of the possible influence of the Greek accents in the Hellenic number system. When we consider, however, that the dot is found for zero in the Bakh[s.][=a]l[=i] manuscript,[257] and that it was used in subscript form in the _Kit[=a]b al-Fihrist_[258] in the tenth century, and as late as the sixteenth century,[259] although in this case probably under Arabic influence, we are forced to believe that this form may also have been of Hindu origin.  The fact seems to be that, as already stated,[260] the Arabs did not immediately adopt the Hindu zero, because it resembled their 5; they used the superscript dot as serving their purposes fairly well; they may, indeed, have carried this to the west and have added it to the [.g]ob[=a]r forms already there, just as they transmitted it to the Persians. Furthermore, the Arab and Hebrew scholars of Northern Africa in the tenth century knew these numerals as Indian forms, for a commentary on the _S[=e]fer Ye[s.][=i]r[=a]h_ by Ab[=u] Sahl ibn Tamim (probably composed at Kairw[=a]n, c. 950) speaks of \"the Indian arithmetic known under the name of _[.g]ob[=a]r_ or dust calculation.\"[261] All this suggests that the Arabs may very {68} likely have known the [.g]ob[=a]r forms before the numerals reached them again in 773.[262] The term \"[.g]ob[=a]r numerals\" was also used without any reference to the peculiar use of dots.[263] In this connection it is worthy of mention that the Algerians employed two different forms of numerals in manuscripts even of the fourteenth century,[264] and that the Moroccans of to-day employ the European forms instead of the present Arabic.  The Indian use of subscript dots to indicate the tens, hundreds, thousands, etc., is"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22599"],["title","The Hindu-Arabic Numerals (#8)"],["body","by a passage in the _Kit[=a]b al-Fihrist_[265] (987 A.D.) in which the writer discusses the written language of the people of India. Notwithstanding the importance of this reference for the early history of the numerals, it has not been mentioned by previous writers on this subject. The numeral forms given are those which have usually been called Indian,[266] in opposition to [.g]ob[=a]r. In this document the dots are placed below the characters, instead of being superposed as described above. The significance was the same.  In form these [.g]ob[=a]r numerals resemble our own much more closely than the Arab numerals do. They varied more or less, but were substantially as follows:  {69}    1[267][Illustration]   2[268][Illustration]   3[269][Illustration]   4[270][Illustration]   5[271][Illustration]   6[271][Illustration]  The question of the possible influence of the Egyptian demotic and hieratic ordinal forms has been so often suggested that it seems well to introduce them at this point, for comparison with the [.g]ob[=a]r forms. They would as appropriately be used in connection with the Hindu forms, and the evidence of a relation of the first three with all these systems is apparent. The only further resemblance is in the Demotic 4 and in the 9, so that the statement that the Hindu forms in general came from {70} this source has no foundation. The first four Egyptian cardinal numerals[272] resemble more the modern Arabic.  [Illustration: DEMOTIC AND HIERATIC ORDINALS]  This theory of the very early introduction of the numerals into Europe fails in several points. In the first place the early Western forms are not known; in the second place some early Eastern forms are like the [.g]ob[=a]r, as is seen in the third line on p. 69, where the forms are from a manuscript written at Shiraz about 970 A.D., and in which some western Arabic forms, e.g. [symbol] for 2, are also used. Probably most significant of all is the fact that the [.g]ob[=a]r numerals as given by Sacy are all, with the exception of the symbol for eight, either single Arabic letters or combinations of letters. So much for the Woepcke theory and the meaning of the [.g]ob[=a]r numerals. We now have to consider the question as to whether Boethius knew these [.g]ob[=a]r forms, or forms akin to them.  This large question[273] suggests several minor ones: (1) Who was Boethius? (2) Could he have known these numerals? (3) Is there any positive or strong circumstantial evidence that he did know them? (4) What are the probabilities in the case?  {71}  First, who was Boethius,--Divus[274] Boethius as he was called in the Middle Ages? Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius[275] was born at Rome c. 475. He was a member of the distinguished family of the Anicii,[276] which had for some time before his birth been Christian. Early left an orphan, the tradition is that he was taken to Athens at about the age of ten, and that he remained there eighteen years.[277] He married Rusticiana, daughter of the senator Symmachus, and this union of two such powerful families allowed him to move in the highest circles.[278] Standing strictly for the right, and against all iniquity at court, he became the object of hatred on the part of all the unscrupulous element near the throne, and his bold defense of the ex-consul Albinus, unjustly accused of treason, led to his imprisonment at Pavia[279] and his execution in 524.[280] Not many generations after his death, the period being one in which historical criticism was at its lowest ebb, the church found it profitable to look upon his execution as a martyrdom.[281] He was {72} accordingly looked upon as a saint,[282] his bones were enshrined,[283] and as a natural consequence his books were among the classics in the church schools for a thousand years.[284] It is pathetic, however, to think of the medieval student trying to extract mental nourishment from a work so abstract, so meaningless, so unnecessarily complicated, as the arithmetic of Boethius.  He was looked upon by his contemporaries and immediate successors as a master, for Cassiodorus[285] (c. 490-c. 585 A.D.) says to him: \"Through your translations the music of Pythagoras and the astronomy of Ptolemy are read by those of Italy, and the arithmetic of Nicomachus and the geometry of Euclid are known to those of the West.\"[286] Founder of the medieval scholasticism, {73} distinguishing the trivium and quadrivium,[287] writing the only classics of his time, Gibbon well called him \"the last of the Romans whom Cato or Tully could have acknowledged for their countryman.\"[288]  The second question relating to Boethius is this: Could he possibly have known the Hindu numerals? In view of the relations that will be shown to have existed between the East and the West, there can only be an affirmative answer to this question. The numerals had existed, without the zero, for several centuries; they had been well known in India; there had been a continued interchange of thought between the East and West; and warriors, ambassadors, scholars, and the restless trader, all had gone back and forth, by land or more frequently by sea, between the Mediterranean lands and the centers of Indian commerce and culture. Boethius could very well have learned one or more forms of Hindu numerals from some traveler or merchant.  To justify this statement it is necessary to speak more fully of these relations between the Far East and Europe. It is true that we have no records of the interchange of learning, in any large way, between eastern Asia and central Europe in the century preceding the time of Boethius. But it is one of the mistakes of scholars to believe that they are the sole transmitters of knowledge. {74} As a matter of fact there is abundant reason for believing that Hindu numerals would naturally have been known to the Arabs, and even along every trade route to the remote west, long before the zero entered to make their place-value possible, and that the characters, the methods of calculating, the improvements that took place from time to time, the zero when it appeared, and the customs as to solving business problems, would all have been made known from generation to generation along these same trade routes from the Orient to the Occident. It must always be kept in mind that it was to the tradesman and the wandering scholar that the spread of such learning was due, rather than to the school man. Indeed, Avicenna[289] (980-1037 A.D.) in a short biography of himself relates that when his people were living at Bokh[=a]ra his father sent him to the house of a grocer to learn the Hindu art of reckoning, in which this grocer (oil dealer, possibly) was expert. Leonardo of Pisa, too, had a similar training.  The whole question of this spread of mercantile knowledge along the trade routes is so connected with the [.g]ob[=a]r numerals, the Boethius question, Gerbert, Leonardo of Pisa, and other names and events, that a digression for its consideration now becomes necessary.[290]  {75}  Even in very remote times, before the Hindu numerals were sculptured in the cave of N[=a]n[=a] Gh[=a]t, there were trade relations between Arabia and India. Indeed, long before the Aryans went to India the great Turanian race had spread its civilization from the Mediterranean to the Indus.[291] At a much later period the Arabs were the intermediaries between Egypt and Syria on the west, and the farther Orient.[292] In the sixth century B.C., Hecatæus,[293] the father of geography, was acquainted not only with the Mediterranean lands but with the countries as far as the Indus,[294] and in Biblical times there were regular triennial voyages to India. Indeed, the story of Joseph bears witness to the caravan trade from India, across Arabia, and on to the banks of the Nile. About the same time as Hecatæus, Scylax, a Persian admiral under Darius, from Caryanda on the coast of Asia Minor, traveled to {76} northwest India and wrote upon his ventures.[295] He induced the nations along the Indus to acknowledge the Persian supremacy, and such number systems as there were in these lands would naturally have been known to a man of his attainments.  A century after Scylax, Herodotus showed considerable knowledge of India, speaking of its cotton and its gold,[296] telling how Sesostris[297] fitted out ships to sail to that country, and mentioning the routes to the east. These routes were generally by the Red Sea, and had been followed by the Phoenicians and the Sabæans, and later were taken by the Greeks and Romans.[298]  In the fourth century B.C. the West and East came into very close relations. As early as 330, Pytheas of Massilia (Marseilles) had explored as far north as the northern end of the British Isles and the coasts of the German Sea, while Macedon, in close touch with southern France, was also sending her armies under Alexander[299] through Afghanistan as far east as the Punjab.[300] Pliny tells us that Alexander the Great employed surveyors to measure {77} the roads of India; and one of the great highways is described by Megasthenes, who in 295 B.C., as the ambassador of Seleucus, resided at P[=a]tal[=i]pu[t.]ra, the present Patna.[301]  The Hindus also learned the art of coining from the Greeks, or possibly from the Chinese, and the stores of Greco-Hindu coins still found in northern India are a constant source of historical information.[302] The R[=a]m[=a]yana speaks of merchants traveling in great caravans and embarking by sea for foreign lands.[303] Ceylon traded with Malacca and Siam, and Java was colonized by Hindu traders, so that mercantile knowledge was being spread about the Indies during all the formative period of the numerals.  Moreover the results of the early Greek invasion were embodied by Dicæarchus of Messana (about 320 B.C.) in a map that long remained a standard. Furthermore, Alexander did not allow his influence on the East to cease. He divided India into three satrapies,[304] placing Greek"]]]
