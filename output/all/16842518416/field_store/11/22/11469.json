A.D. 1886.                                     PREFACE.   The \"Standard Oratorios\" is intended as a companion to the \"Standard Operas;\" and with this purpose in view the compiler has followed as closely as possible the same method in the arrangement and presentation of his scheme. The main object has been to present to the reader a comprehensive sketch of the oratorios which may be called \"standard,\" outlining the sacred stories which they tell, and briefly indicating and sketching their principal numbers, accompanied in each case with a short biography of the composer and such historical matter connected with the various works as is of special interest. The compiler has also included in his scheme a sketch of the origin and development of the Oratorio as illustrated in its three principal evolutionary stages, together with descriptions of several works which are not oratorios in the strict sense, but at the same time are sacred compositions written upon a large scale and usually performed by oratorio societies, such as Bach's \"Passion Music\" and \"Magnificat,\" Berlioz's, Mozart's, and Verdi's Requiems, Mendelssohn's \"Hymn of Praise,\" Handel's \"Dettingen Te Deum,\" Schumann's \"Paradise and the Peri,\" and Rubinstein's \"Tower of Babel.\"  As in the case of the \"Standard Operas,\" the work has been prepared for the general public rather than for musicians, and as far as practicable, technical terms have been avoided. Description, not criticism, has been the purpose of the volume, and the various works are described as fully as the necessarily brief space allotted to each would allow. The utmost pains have been taken to secure historical and chronological accuracy, inasmuch as these details are nearly always matters of controversy. The favor which has been so generously accorded to the \"Standard Operas\" leads the compiler to believe that the \"Standard Oratorios\" will also be welcomed by those who enjoy the sacred music of the great masters, and that it will prove a valuable addition to other works of musical reference.

THE ORATORIO.   The oratorio in its modern form is a musical setting of a sacred story or text in a style more or less dramatic. Its various parts are assigned to the four solo voices and to single or double chorus, with accompaniment of full orchestra, sometimes amplified by the organ. Like the opera, it has its recitative, linking together and leading up to the various numbers. The origin of the word is to be found in the \"oratory,\" or place of prayer, where these compositions were first performed. Crescimbeni, one of the earliest musical writers, says: \"The oratorio had its origin from San Filippo Neri,[1] who, in his chapel, after sermons and other devotions, in order to allure young people to pious offices, and to detain them from earthly pleasures, had hymns, psalms, and such like prayers sung by one or more voices.\" In tracing its evolutionary stages, its root will be found in the moralities, mysteries, and miracle-plays of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, which were instituted for the purpose of impressing Biblical events in symbolical form upon the early converts to the Christian Church. These representations were entirely dramatic in character, and their subjects, though always sacred, were often grotesquely treated, and sometimes verged on buffoonery. Among the actors, God, Christ, Satan, Mary, and the angels nearly always appeared; later, the various virtues and vices were personified. The representations were usually given in the streets or in fields, and sometimes on the water. The highest dignitaries of the Church did not disdain to act in these plays, nor did their promoters hesitate at times to reduce the exhibition to the level of a Punch-and-Judy show by the introduction of puppets cleverly manipulated. The earliest of these miracle-plays in England were performed by the various London Companies. The Tanners, for instance, produced the Fall of Lucifer. The Drapers played the Creation, in which Adam and Eve appeared in their original costume,--apparently without giving offence. The Water-Drawers naturally chose the Deluge. In the scene describing the embarkation of Noah's family, the patriarch has a great deal of trouble with his wife, who is determined not to go aboard. She declares that if her worldly friends are left behind, she will stay and drown with them, and he can        \"Rowe forth away when thou liste,       And get thee another wif.\"  Noah expostulates with her in vain, grows furiously indignant, and bids her        \"Come in,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22793"],["title","The Standard Oratorios: Their Stories, Their Music, And Their Composers (#1)"],["body"," wif, in twenty devill ways,       Or alles stand thee without.\"  Her friends the gossips entreat her to remain with them, and have a carousal over a \"pottel full of malmsey;\" but at last Shem makes a virtue of necessity and forces her into the ark, as the following scene shows:--        \"In faith, moder, in ye shall,       Whither you will or noughte.\"              NOE.        \"Well me wif into this boate.\"           [_She gives him a box on the ear._]       \"Haue you that for thee note.\"              NOE.        \"A le Mary this whote,       A childre methinks my boate remeues,       Our tarrying here heughly me grieues.\"           [_She is forced into the ark._]  The earliest of these representations, so far as has been discovered, dates back to the twelfth century, and is known as the Feast of Asses. In these exhibitions, Balaam, superbly habited and wearing an enormous pair of spurs, rode a wooden ass, in which the speaker was concealed. The ass and the devil were favorite characters. The former sometimes appeared in monkish garb and brayed responses to the intonations of the priests, while the latter, arrayed in fantastic costumes, seems to have been the prototype of clown in the pantomime. As late as 1783 the buffoonery of this kind of exhibition continued. An English traveller, describing a mystery called the \"Creation\" which he saw at Bamberg in that year, says:--    \"Young priests had the wings of geese tied on their shoulders to   personate angels. Adam appeared on the scene in a big curled wig and   brocaded morning-gown. Among the animals that passed before him to   receive their names were a well-shod horse, pigs with rings in their   noses, and a mastiff with a brass collar. A cow's rib-bone had been   provided for the formation of Eve; but the mastiff spied it out,   grabbed it, and carried it off. The angels tried to whistle him back;   but not succeeding, they chased him, gave him a kicking, and recovered   the bone, which they placed under a trap-door by the side of the   sleeping Adam, whence there soon emerged a lanky priest in a loose   robe, to personate Eve.\"  The buffoonery and profanity of the early exhibitions, however, gradually wore away when the Church assumed the monopoly of them and forbade secular performances. Among the earlier works Burney cites the following:--    \"The 'Conversion of St. Paul,' performed at Rome, 1440, as described by   Sulpicius, has been erroneously called the first opera, or musical   drama. 'Abram et Isaac suo Figliuolo,' a sacred drama (_azione sacra_),   'showing how Abraham was commanded by God to sacrifice his son Isaac on   the mountain,' was performed in the Church of St. Mary Magdalen in   Florence, 1449. Another on the same subject, called 'Abraham and   Sarah,' 'containing the good life of their son Isaac, and the bad   conduct of Ishmael, the son of his handmaid, and how they were turned   out of the house,' was printed in 1556; 'Abel e Caino,' and 'Samson,'   1554; 'The Prodigal Son,' 1565; and 'La Commedia Spirituale dell'   Anima' ('The Spiritual Comedy of the Soul'), printed at Siena, without   date, in which there are near thirty personifications, besides Saint   Paul, Saint John Chrysostom, two little boys who repeat a kind of   prelude, and the announcing angel, who always speaks the prologue in   these old mysteries. He is called _l'angelo che nunzia_, and his figure   is almost always given in a wooden cut on the title-page of printed   copies. Here, among the interlocutors, we have God the Father, Michael   the archangel, a chorus of angels, the Human Soul with her guardian   angel, memory, intellect, free-will, faith, hope, charity, reason,   prudence, temperance, fortitude, justice, mercy, poverty, patience, and   humility; with hatred, infidelity, despair, sensuality, a chorus of   demons, and the devil. None of these mysteries are totally without   music, as there are choruses and _laudi_, or hymns, that are sung in   them all, and sometimes there was playing on instruments between the   acts. In a play written by Damiano and printed at Siena, 1519,   according to Crescimbeni, at the beginning of every act there was an   octave stanza, which was sung to the sound of the lyra viol by a   personage called Orpheus, who was solely retained for that purpose; at   other times a madrigal was sung between the acts, after the manner of a   chorus.\"  It was not until the time when San Filippo Neri began his dramatization and performance of Biblical stories, such as \"The Good Samaritan,\" \"The Prodigal Son,\" and \"Tobias and the Angels,\" accompanied with music written by his friend Giovanni Animuccia, that the term \"Oratorio\" came to be accepted as the distinctive title of these sacred musical dramas. His productions were very crudely and hastily arranged, his only purpose having been to render his service attractive. After his death, however, in 1595, his work was continued by Emilio del Cavaliere, a Roman composer, who produced the first real oratorio which had as yet appeared. It was entitled \"La Rappresentazione dell' Anima e del Corpo\" (\"The Soul and the Body\"), and was first performed in February, 1600, in the oratory of the Church of Santa Maria della Vallicella at Rome. Burney assigns to it the credit of being \"the first sacred drama or oratorio in which recitative was used.\" The characters were Time, Human Life, the World, Pleasure, the Intellect, the Soul, the Body, and two youths who were to recite the prologue. The orchestra was composed of a double lyre, a harpsichord, a large or double guitar, and two flutes. The composer has left some curious instructions for the performance of his work; among them the following:--    \"Pleasure, an imaginary character, with two companions, are to have   instruments in their hands, on which they are to play while they sing   and perform the ritornels.    \"Il Corpo, the Body, when these words are uttered, 'Sí che hormai alma   mia,' etc., may throw away some of his ornaments, as his gold collar,   feather from his hat, etc.    \"The World, and Human Life in particular, are to be gayly and richly   dressed; and when they are divested of their trappings, to appear very   poor and wretched, and at length dead carcases.\"  The ballet played a prominent part in all the early oratorios, and the composer has also left detailed instructions for its guidance. During the ritornels the four principal dancers accompanied them in \"a ballet enlivened with capers,\" and at the close of the performance stanzas were sung, alternating with dances to be executed \"sedately and reverentially.\"  Emilio del Cavaliere was followed by a long line of Italian oratorio composers who contributed to amplify and enrich this form of composition. Among the earliest of these writers were Carissimi, Stradella, Scarlatti, Mazzocchi, Federici, Pistocchi, Caldara, and Colonna. Carissimi perfected the recitative and invested the music with more importance, giving it something like equal rank with the dramatic character of the composition. It was during his time that the personage known as \"Historicus\" was introduced, who continued the action with explanatory passages between the numbers,--a modern illustration of which may be found in the \"Narrator,\" as used by Gounod in his \"Redemption.\" Carissimi employed this expedient, and made it very effective. It is also claimed that he was the first to introduce the cantata as a form of church music, and the accompaniment of violins in motet performances. His most famous oratorios are \"Jephte,\" \"Abraham et Isaac,\" \"Le Jugement Dernier,\" and \"Judicium Salomonis.\" Of the first named, Hawkins says: \"It consists of recitative, airs, and chorus; and for sweetness of melody, artful modulation, and original harmony, is justly esteemed one of the finest efforts of musical skill and genius that the world knows of.\" Stradella, whose romantic history is familiar to every one, is chiefly remembered by his attachment for Hortensia, the vengeance of the Venetian lover which followed them so long, and the song which saved the composer's life from the assassins. This song was from his own oratorio, \"St. John the Baptist,\" first performed in the Church of St. John Lateran at Rome. Burney, who examined the score, says: \"The recitative is in general excellent, and there is scarce a movement among the airs in which genius, skill, and study do not appear.\" He also observes that this oratorio is the first work in which the proper sharps and flats are generally placed at the clef. Scarlatti, born in 1659, was a composer of great originality, as well as versatility. He has left, in addition to his numerous operas and cantatas, several oratorios, the most famous of which are \"I Dolori di Maria sempre Vergine,\" \"Il Sagrifizio d' Abramo,\" \"Il Martirio di Santa Teodosia,\" and \"La Concezzione della beata Vergine.\" He gave to the oratorio more breadth, boldness, and dignity of style, improved the form of the aria, made the accompanied recitative more dramatic, and developed the treatment of several instruments, among them the trumpet, whose real beauty and effect he was the first to bring out. Mazzocchi is chiefly known by his oratorio, \"Querimonia,\" produced in Rome in 1631, which is said to have drawn tears from all who heard it. Federici wrote two oratorios, \"Santa Cristina,\" and \"Santa Caterina de Sienna,\" in both of which \"interstitial\" accompaniment is used for the first time; that is, the violins, instead of accompanying the voice, repeat portions of the melody in short symphonies. Pistocchi was one of the most prominent stage-singers of his time, and established a school of singing at Bologna.
