The small bar, therefore, is influenced by the exterior magnetic field (Z).  [Illustration: _Fig. 10._ TWO PERMANENT MAGNETS]  [Illustration: _Fig. 11._ MAGNETS IN THE EARTH'S MAGNETIC FIELD]  Let us now take the outline represented by the earth's surface (Fig. 11), and suspend a magnet (A) at any point, like the needle of a compass, and it will be seen that the needle will arrange itself north and south, within the magnetic field which flows from the north to the south pole.  PECULIARITY OF A MAGNET.--One characteristic of a magnet is that, while apparently the magnetic field flows out at one end of the magnet, and moves inwardly at the other end, the power of attraction is just the same at both ends.  In Fig. 12 are shown a bar (A) and a horseshoe magnet (B). The bar (A) has metal blocks (C) at each end, and each of these blocks is attracted to and held in contact with the ends by magnetic influence, just the same as the bar (D) is attracted by and held against the two ends of the horseshoe magnet. These blocks (C) or the bar (D) are called armatures. Through them is represented the visible motion produced by the magnetic field.  [Illustration: _Fig. 12._ ARMATURES FOR MAGNETS]  ACTION OF THE ELECTRO-MAGNET.--The electro-magnet exerts its force in the same manner as a permanent magnet, so far as attraction and repulsion are concerned, and it has a north and a south pole, as in the case with the permanent magnet. An electro-magnet is simply a bar of iron with a coil or coils of wire around it; when a current of electricity flows through the wire, the bar is magnetized. The moment the current is cut off, the bar is demagnetized. The question that now arises is, why an electric current flowing through a wire, under those conditions, magnetizes the bar, or _core_, as it is called.  [Illustration: _Fig. 13._ MAGNETIZED FIELD]  [Illustration: _Fig. 14._ MAGNETIZED BAR]  In Fig. 13 is shown a piece of wire (A). Let us assume that a current of electricity is flowing through this wire in the direction of the darts. What actually takes place is that the electricity extends out beyond the surface of the wire in the form of the closed rings (B). If, now, this wire (A) is wound around an iron core (C, Fig. 14), you will observe that this electric field, as it is called, entirely surrounds the core, or rather, that the core is within the magnetic field or influence of the current flowing through the wire, and the core (C) thereby becomes magnetized, but it is magnetized only when the current passes through the wire coil (A).  [Illustration: _Fig. 15._ DIRECTION OF CURRENT]  From the foregoing, it will be understood that a wire carrying a current of electricity not only is affected within its body, but that it also has a sphere of influence exteriorly to the body of the wire, at all points; and advantage is taken of this phenomenon in constructing motors, dynamos, electrical measuring devices and almost every kind of electrical mechanism in existence.  EXTERIOR MAGNETIC INFLUENCE AROUND A WIRE CARRYING A CURRENT.--Bear in mind that the wire coil (A, Fig. 14) does not come into contact with the core (C). It is insulated from the core, either by air or by rubber or other insulating substance, and a current passing from A to C under those conditions is a current of _induction_. On the other hand, the current flowing through the wire (A) from end to end is called a _conduction_ current. Remember these terms.  In this connection there is also another thing which you will do well to bear in mind. In Fig. 15 you will notice a core (C) and an insulated wire coil (B) wound around it. The current, through the wire (B), as shown by the darts (D), moves in one direction, and the induced current in the core (C) travels in the opposite direction, as shown by the darts (D).  [Illustration: _Fig. 16._ DIRECTION OF INDUCTION CURRENT]  PARALLEL WIRES.--In like manner, if two wires (A, B, Fig. 16) are parallel with each other, and a current of electricity passes along the wire (A) in one direction, the induced current in the wire (B) will move in the opposite direction.  These fundamental principles should be thoroughly understood and mastered.     CHAPTER IV  FRICTIONAL, VOLTAIC OR GALVANIC, AND ELECTRO-MAGNETIC ELECTRICITY   THREE ELECTRICAL SOURCES.--It has been found that there are three kinds of electricity, or, to be more accurate, there are three ways to generate it. These will now be described.  When man first began experimenting, he produced a current by frictional means, and collected the electricity in a bottle or jar. Electricity, so stored, could be drawn from the jar, by attaching thereto suitable connection. This could be effected only in one way, and that was by discharging the entire accumulation instantaneously. At that time they knew of no means whereby the current could be made to flow from the jar as from a battery or cell.  FRICTIONAL ELECTRICITY.--With a view of explaining the principles involved, we show in Fig. 17 a machine for producing electricity by friction.   [Illustration: _Fig. 17._ FRICTION-ELECTRICITY MACHINE]  This is made up as follows: A represents the base, having thereon a flat member (B), on which is mounted a pair of parallel posts or standards (C, C), which are connected at the top by a cross piece (D). Between these two posts is a glass disc (E), mounted upon a shaft (F), which passes through the posts, this shaft having at one end a crank (G). Two leather collecting surfaces (H, H), which are in contact with the glass disc (E), are held in position by arms (I, J), the arm (I) being supported by the cross piece (D), and the arm (J) held by the base piece (B). A rod (K), U-shaped in form, passes over the structure here thus described, its ends being secured to the base (B). The arms (I, J) are both electrically connected with this rod, or conductor (K), joined to a main conductor (L), which has a terminating knob (M). On each side and close to the terminal end of each leather collector (H) is a fork-shaped collector (N). These two collectors are also connected electrically with the conductor (K). When the disc is turned electricity is generated by the leather flaps and accumulated by the collectors (N), after which it is ready to be discharged at the knob (M).  In order to collect the electricity thus generated a vessel called a Leyden jar is used.  LEYDEN JAR.--This is shown in Fig. 18. The jar (A) is of glass coated exteriorly at its lower end with tinfoil (B), which extends up a little more than halfway from the bottom. This jar has a wooden cover or top (C), provided centrally with a hole (D). The jar is designed to receive within it a tripod and standard (E) of lead. Within this lead standard is fitted a metal rod (F), which projects upwardly through the hole (D), its upper end having thereon a terminal knob (G). A sliding cork (H) on the rod (F) serves as a means to close the jar when not in use. When in use this cork is raised so the rod may not come into contact, electrically, with the cover (C).  The jar is half filled with sulphuric acid (I), after which, in order to charge the jar, the knob (G) is brought into contact with the knob (M) of the friction generator (Fig. 17).  VOLTAIC OR GALVANIC ELECTRICITY.--The second method of generating electricity is by chemical means, so called, because a liquid is used as one of the agents.  [Illustration: _Fig. 18._ LEYDEN JAR]  Galvani, in 1790, made the experiments which led to the generation of electricity by means of liquids and metals. The first battery was called the \"crown of cups,\" shown in Fig. 19, and consisting of a row of glass cups (A), containing salt water. These cups were electrically connected by means of bent metal strips (B), each strip having at one end a copper plate (C), and at the other end a zinc plate (D). The first plate in the cup at one end is connected with the last plate in the cup at the other end by a conductor (E) to make a complete circuit.  [Illustration: _Fig. 19._ GALVANIC ELECTRICITY. CROWN OF CUPS]  THE CELL AND BATTERY.--From the foregoing it will be seen that within each cup the current flows from the zinc to the copper plates, and exteriorly from the copper to the zinc plates through the conductors (B and E).  A few years afterwards Volta devised what is known as the voltaic pile (Fig. 20).  VOLTAIC PILE--HOW MADE.--This is made of alternate discs of copper and zinc with a piece of cardboard of corresponding size between each zinc and copper plate. The cardboard discs are moistened with acidulated water. The bottom disc of copper has a strip which connects with a cup of acid, and one wire terminal (A) runs therefrom. The upper disc, which is of zinc, is also connected, by a strip, with a cup of acid from which extends the other terminal wire (B).  [Illustration: _Fig. 20._ VOLTAIC ELECTRICITY]  _Plus and Minus Signs._--It will be noted that the positive or copper disc has the plus sign (+) while the zinc disc has the minus (-) sign. These signs denote the positive and the negative sides of the current.  The liquid in the cells, or in the moistened paper, is called the _electrolyte_ and the plates or discs are called _electrodes_. To define them more clearly, the positive plate is the _anode_, and the negative plate the _cathode_.  The current, upon entering the zinc plate, decomposes the water in the electrolyte, thereby forming oxygen. The hydrogen in the water, which has also been formed by the decomposition, is carried to the copper plate, so that the plate finally is so coated with hydrogen that it is difficult for the current to pass through. This condition is called \"polarization,\" and to prevent it has been the aim of all inventors. To it also we may attribute"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22766"],["title","Electricity for Boys (#5)"],["body","great variety of primary batteries, each having some distinctive claim of merit.  THE COMMON PRIMARY CELL.--The most common form of primary cell contains sulphuric acid, or a sulphuric acid solution, as the electrolyte, with zinc for the _anode_, and carbon, instead of copper, for the _cathode_.  The ends of the zinc and copper plates are called _terminals_, and while the zinc is the anode or positive element, its _terminal_ is designated as the positive pole. In like manner, the carbon is the negative element or cathode, and its terminal is designated as negative pole.  Fig. 21 will show the relative arrangement of the parts. It is customary to term that end or element from which the current flows as positive. A cell is regarded as a whole, and as the current passes out of the cell from the copper element, the copper terminal becomes positive.  [Illustration: _Fig. 21._ PRIMARY BATTERY]  BATTERY RESISTANCE, ELECTROLYTE AND CURRENT.--The following should be carefully memorized:  A cell has reference to a single vessel. When two or more cells are coupled together they form a _battery_.  _Resistance_ is opposition to the movement of the current. If it is offered by the electrolyte, it is designated \"Internal Resistance.\" If, on the other hand, the opposition takes place, for instance, through the wire, it is then called \"External Resistance.\"  The electrolyte must be either acid, or alkaline, or saline, and the electrodes must be of dissimilar metals, so the electrolyte will attack one of them.  The current is measured in amperes, and the force with which it is caused to flow is measured in volts. In practice the word \"current\" is used to designate ampere flow; and electromotive force, or E. M. F., is used instead of voltage.  ELECTRO-MAGNETIC ELECTRICITY.--The third method of generating electricity is by electro-magnets. The value and use of induction will now be seen, and you will be enabled to utilize the lesson concerning magnetic action referred to in the previous chapter.  MAGNETIC RADIATION.--You will remember that every piece of metal which is within the path of an electric current has a space all about its surface from end to end which is electrified. This electrified field extends out a certain distance from the metal, and is supposed to maintain a movement around it. If, now, another piece of metal is brought within range of this electric or magnetic zone and moved across it, so as to cut through this field, a current will be generated thereby, or rather added to the current already exerted, so that if we start with a feeble current, it can be increased by rapidly \"cutting the lines of force,\" as it is called.  DIFFERENT KINDS OF DYNAMO.--While there are many kinds of dynamo, they all, without exception, are constructed in accordance with this principle. There are also many varieties of current. For instance, a dynamo may be made to produce a high voltage and a low amperage; another with high amperage and low voltage; another which gives a direct current for lighting, heating, power, and electroplating; still another which generates an alternating current for high tension power, or transmission, arc-lighting, etc., all of which will be explained hereafter.  In this place, however, a full description of a direct-current dynamo will explain the principle involved in all dynamos--that to generate a current of electricity makes it necessary for us to move a field of force, like an armature, rapidly and continuously through another field of force, like a magnetic field.  DIRECT-CURRENT DYNAMO.--We shall now make the simplest form of dynamo, using for this purpose a pair of permanent magnets.  [Illustration: _Fig. 22._ DYNAMO FIELD AND POLE PIECE]  SIMPLE MAGNET CONSTRUCTION.--A simple way to make a pair of magnets for this purpose is shown in Fig. 22. A piece of round 3/4-inch steel core (A), 5-1/2 inches long, is threaded at both ends to receive at one end a nut (B), which is screwed on a sufficient distance so that the end of the core (A) projects a half inch beyond the nut. The other end of the steel core has a pole piece of iron (C) 2\" × 2\" × 4\", with a hole midway between the ends, threaded entirely through, and provided along one side with a concave channel, within which the armature is to turn. Now, before the pole piece (C) is put on, we will slip on a disc (E), made of hard rubber, then a thin rubber tube (F), and finally a rubber disc (G), so as to provide a positive insulation for the wire coil which is wound on the bobbin thus made.  HOW TO WIND.--In practice, and as you go further along in this work, you will learn the value, first, of winding one layer of insulated wire on the spool, coating it with shellac, and then putting on the next layer, and so on; when completely wound, the two wire terminals may be brought out at one end; but for our present purpose, and to render the explanation clearer, the wire terminals are at the opposite ends of the spool (H, H').  THE DYNAMO FIELDS.--Two of these spools are so made and they are called the _fields_ of the dynamo.  We will next prepare an iron bar (I), 5 inches long and 1/2 inch thick and 1-1/2 inches wide, then bore two holes through it so the distance measures 3 inches from center to center. These holes are to be threaded for the 3/4-inch cores (A). This bar holds together the upper ends of the cores, as shown in Fig. 23.  [Illustration: _Fig. 23._ BASE AND FIELDS ASSEMBLED]  We then prepare a base (J) of any hard wood, 2 inches thick, 8 inches long and 8 inches wide, and bore two 3/4-inch holes 3 inches apart on a middle line, to receive a pair of 3/4-inch cap screws (K), which pass upwardly through the holes in the base and screw into the pole pieces (C). A wooden bar (L), 1-1/2\" × 1-1/2\", 8 inches long, is placed under each pole piece, which is also provided with holes for the cap screws (K). The lower side of the base (J) should be countersunk, as at M, so the head of the nut will not project. The fields of the dynamo are now secured in position to the base.  [Illustration: _Fig. 24._ DETAILS OF THE ARMATURE, CORE  _Fig. 25._ DETAILS OF THE ARMATURE, BODY]  THE ARMATURE.--A bar of iron (Fig. 24), 1\" × 1\" and 2-1/4 inches long, is next provided. Through this bar (1) are then bored two 5/16-inch holes 1-3/4 inches apart, and on the opposite sides of this bar are two half-rounded plates of iron (3) (Fig. 25).  ARMATURE WINDING.--Each plate is 1/2 inch thick, 1-3/4 inches wide and 4 inches long, each plate having holes (4) to coincide with the holes (2) of the bar (1), so that when the two plates are applied to opposite sides of the bar, and riveted together, a cylindrical member is formed, with two channels running longitudinally, and transversely at the ends; and in these channels the insulated wires are wound from end to end around the central block (1).  MOUNTING THE ARMATURE.--It is now necessary to provide a means for revolving this armature. To this end a brass disc (5, Fig. 26) is made, 2 inches in diameter, 1/8 inch thick. Centrally, at one side, is a projecting stem (6) of round brass, which projects out 2 inches, and the outer end is turned down, as at 7, to form a small bearing surface.  [Illustration: _Fig. 26._ JOURNALS _Fig. 27._ COMMUTATOR, ARMATURE MOUNTINGS]  The other end of the armature has a similar disc (8), with a central stem (9), 1-1/2 inches long, turned down to 1/4-inch diameter up to within 1/4 inch of the disc (7), so as to form a shoulder.  THE COMMUTATOR.--In Fig. 27 is shown, at 10, a wooden cylinder, 1 inch long and 1-1/4 inches in diameter, with a hole (11) bored through axially, so that it will fit tightly on the stem (6) of the disc (5). On this wooden cylinder is driven a brass or copper tube (12), which has holes (13) opposite each other. Screws are used to hold the tube to the wooden cylinder, and after they are properly secured together, the tube (12) is cut by a saw, as at 14, so as to form two independent tubular surfaces.  [Illustration: _Fig. 28._ END VIEW ARMATURE, MOUNTED]  These tubular sections are called the commutator plates.  [Illustration: _Fig. 29._ TOP VIEW OF ARMATURE ON BASE]  In order to mount this armature, two bearings are provided, each comprising a bar of brass (15, Fig. 28), each 1/4 inch thick, 1/2 inch wide and 4-1/2 inches long. Two holes, 3 inches apart, are formed through this bar, to receive round-headed wood screws (16), these screws being 3 inches long, so they will pass through the wooden pieces (I) and enter the base (J). Midway between the ends, each bar (15) has an iron bearing block (17), 3/4\" × 1/2\" and 1-1/2 inches high, the 1/4-inch hole for the journal (7) being midway between its ends.  COMMUTATOR BRUSHES.--Fig. 28 shows the base, armature and commutator assembled in position, and to these parts have been added the commutator brushes. The brush holder (18) is a horizontal bar made of hard rubber loosely mounted upon the journal pin (7), which is 2-1/2 inches long. At each end is a right-angled metal arm (19) secured to the bar (18) by screws (20). To these arms the brushes (21) are attached, so that their spring ends engage with the commutator (12). An adjusting screw (22) in the bearing post (17), with the head thereof bearing against the brush-holder (18), serves as a means for revolubly adjusting the brushes with relation to the commutator.  DYNAMO WINDINGS.--There are several ways to wind the dynamos. These can be shown better by the following diagrams (Figs. 30, 31, 32, 33):  THE FIELD.--If the field (A, Fig. 30) is not a permanent magnet, it must be excited by a cell or battery, and the wires (B, B') are connected up with a battery, while the wires (C, C') may be connected up to run a motor. This would, therefore, be what is called a \"separately excited\" dynamo. In this case the battery excites the field and the armature (D), cutting the lines of force at the pole pieces (E), so that the armature gathers the current for the wires (C, C').  [Illustration:"]]]
