At the end of the long dinner, all were so properly employed in this manner that apparently no one noticed the departure of the silent, scornful-lipped governess, and she was able to make her exit without notice or remonstrance.  For a little while she walked up and down in the garden under the rays of a new and early-retiring slip of moon.  Then, with a pain at her heart that she had hoped it was for ever out of the power of life to deal her, she retired to the nursery, relieved the coloured nurse from her watch, and went quietly to bed.  For fully an hour afterward she heard the echo of laughter and voices in the front veranda--sometimes the chink of glasses.  Later, Mrs. van Cannan sang and played waltz-music to them in the drawing-room.  At last the men departed, one by one.  Mrs. van Cannan was heard calling sharply for her night lemonade and someone to unlace her frock.  Next, the servants shuffled softly homeward through the dusk.  The old Cape cook, who had quarters somewhere near the kitchen, went the rounds, locking up.  The clang of the iron bar falling into its bracket across the great front door echoed through the house.  Then all was still.  In the sinister, brooding peace of the desert that ensued, the night noises presently began to make themselves heard.  A cricket somewhere in the house set up a sprightly cheeping.  Far, far away, an animal wailed, and a jackal distressfully called to its mate. Then something laughed terribly--rocking, hollow laughter--it might have been a hyena.  Christine Chaine was a Catholic.  She crossed herself in the darkness and softly repeated some of the prayers whose cadences and noble phrases seem to hold power to hush the soul into peace.  She hoped at this time they would hush her mind into sleep, but for a long while many impressions of the day haunted her.  Sometimes she saw the twitching shoulders and tormented gaze of a sick man, then the smiling blond-and-pink beauty of a woman.  Sometimes a pair of blue eyes, with riddles in them that she would not read, held her; then graves--graves in a long arid line.  At last she slept, the sleep of weariness that mercifully falls upon the strong and healthy like a weight, blotting out consciousness.  Then--taps on the shutter, and words:  \"_Mind the boy--take care of the boy!_\"  They were soft taps and whispered words, but, like the torment of dropping water, they had their effect at last.  The girl sat up in bed again, her fingers pressed to her temples, her eyes staring, listening, listening.  Yes--they were the same eternal taps and words.  With the dull desperation of fatigue, she got out of bed and approached the window.  \"Who are you?  What are you?  Tell me what to do,\" she said quietly.  In the long silence that followed, there was only one answer--the subtle odour of rottenness stole into the room.  She never knew afterward what possessed her to take the course she did. Probably if she had not gone to sleep in the strength and peace of prayers, and awakened with the protection of them woven about her, she would have taken no course at all.  As it was, she knew she had got to do something to solve the mystery of this warning.  It did not occur to her to get out of the window.  The right thing seemed to be to make her way very quietly through the house, let herself out by the front door, and come round to the window where the warning thing waited.  It would not hurt her, she knew.  It was a hateful Thing, but that its intentions were benevolent was a conclusion that had forced itself upon her soul.  Groping for her dressing-gown, she found it and put it on without striking a light.  And though she carried a box of matches in her hand, she believed she would not need them, for the way was perfectly simple and well known to her--a long passage that led to the dining-room, at one end of which was the great, iron-barred front door.  Her feet and hands found the way quietly, and she reached the front door without incident, but when she felt for the great bar whose strident clanging in its bracket had been a last signal of night within the house, her hand encountered nothing.  Wonderingly she slid her fingers up and down the polished oak.  At last she realized that the bar hung loose; the door was merely on the latch.  Someone beside herself who dwelt within the house had business without its portals that night and was still abroad!  For the first time, the girl's purpose faltered.  A slow fear pierced her, and her feet refused to take her farther.  The thought flashed into her mind that, if she passed the door, she might find herself locked out, with the night--and she knew not what beside.  Even as she stood there hesitating, trying to collect her courage, a sound--the soft tread of a foot on gravel--told her that some other being was close by.  There came the same stealthy tread in the porch. Swiftly she shrank back into the embrasure of one of the long windows, thankful for the green blinds against which her dark dressing-gown would give no sign.  With one full sleeve, she shrouded her face.  She had suddenly become terribly aware of being nothing but a slight girl in a nightgown and wrap, with bare feet thrust into straw slippers. She remembered stories she had heard of struggles in the darkness with powerful natives, and her heart turned to water.  It seemed to her the most horrible moment of her life while she stood shrinking there in the shadow, listening to the door open and close, the bar being replaced, the quiet, regular breathing of that other person.  Whoever it was, his movements were calm and undisturbed, but Christine could see nothing, only a large, dim outline that moved sure-footedly across the room, opened another door on the far side, closed it, and was gone.  There were so many other doors, so many other passages.  All Christine could be certain of and thankful for was that it was not her door and her passage that had swallowed up the mysterious night-walker.  It was some little time before she collected sufficient fortitude to creep back whence she had come, her plan unfulfilled, her courage melted. She was bitterly ashamed, yet felt as if she had escaped from some great evil.  Once in the nursery, she locked the door, lighted a candle, and, after she had looked to ascertain that the children were sleeping soundly, she opened her dressing-case and took out a little box of cachets that had been prescribed for her a year before when bitter trouble had stolen sleep for many a night.  She felt, and with some reason, that this was an occasion when it would not be too cowardly to resort to artificial means of restoring her nerves by sleep.  For though fright and surprise had bereft her, for the time being, of her nerve, her firm spirit was neither beaten nor cowed.  She meant to see this thing through, and her last waking thought was a murmured prayer for help to steel her heart against terrors that walked by night, and to resist to the utmost any menace of evil that should approach the little children in her charge.     PART II  There followed some tranquil days of which nothing broke the peaceful monotony.  The children were extraordinarily tractable, perhaps because Mrs. van Cannan seemed too preoccupied to lay any injunctions upon them.  True, Roddy made one of his mysterious disappearances, but it was not long before Christine, hard on his heels, discovered him emerging from an outhouse, where she later assured herself that he could have come to no great harm, for it was merely a big barn stacked with grain and forage, and a number of old packing cases.  Nothing there to account for the expression he wore--that same suggestion of tears fiercely restrained which she had noticed when they were looking at the unmarked grave in the cemetery.  It wrung her heart to see his young mouth pursed up to whistle a tune that would not come, the look of longing in eyes where only happiness and the divine contentment of childhood should dwell; but the boy volunteered no information, and she did not press him.  She wanted his confidence, not to have him regard her as a sort of jailer.  Every day, in the cool of the early morning, while the others were still sleeping, he and she visited the graveyard, starting the good work of making it blossom like the rose, as Christine had promised. They planted lilies and geraniums over the little brothers, and edged the lonely, unmarked grave with a species of curly-leaved box common to that part of the country and which grew rapidly.  It was Roddy's fancy, too, to cover this grave with portulaca--a little plant bearing starry flowers of vivid hues that live for a day only.  He chose plants that bore only scarlet and golden blossoms.  \"She liked those two colours,\" he told Christine, smiling.  \"She said that when we were babies we were all like that--very red, with yellowy golden hair.\"  Christine, looking at the bright head and the fresh cheeks so rare in a South African child, readily understood.  But she could not help wondering, as before, at the loyal little heart that remembered so well the words and fancies of a dead woman--when all others forgot!  Nearly always on returning from these morning excursions they met Saltire, rapidly wreaking destruction upon the district.  Already, scores of the prickly-pears through which they must wend their way were assuming the staggering attitude characteristic of them as the sap dried and they died of their wounds.  Sometimes, one side of a bush would shrivel first, causing it to double up like a creature agonizing. Some crouched like strange beasts watching to spring.  Others thrust themselves ominously forward with projected arms, as if ready to grapple.  Some brandished their flat leaves as the painter Wiertz, in his famous picture of _Napoleon in Hell_, made wives and mothers brandish their menacing fists at the man who had robbed them of their loved ones.  All wore a look that suggested both"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22568"],["title","Blue Aloes: Stories of South Africa (#5)"],["body"," and revenge. Christine understood, at last, why the Kafirs hated to go about the land after dark, averring that the afflicted bushes threatened and chased them.  She began herself to experience an inexplicable feeling of relief, as though at the overcoming of an enemy, when a great spire of smoke betokened the final uprooting and burning of a clump of bush. For fire was the ultimate element used to transform the pest from a malignant into a beneficent factor, and, as aromatic ash, it became of service to the land it had ruined so long.  Almost, the process seemed an exposition of Job's words: \"When thou hast tried me with fire, I shall come forth as gold.\"  It was a curious thing how the \"personality\" of the bushes appeared to affect them all.  Saltire at his work gave the impression of a fighter concentrating on the defeat of an enemy.  Roddy would dance for joy before each staggering bush.  The impassivity of the natives departed from them when they stood about the funeral pyres, and clapping of hands and warlike chanting went heavenward with the smoke.  Christine and Roddy often lingered to watch these rejoicings; indeed, it was impossible at any time to get the boy past Saltire and his gang without a halt.  The English girl, while standing somewhat aloof, would nevertheless not conceal from herself the interest she felt in the forestry man's remarks, not only on the common enemy, but his work in general.  \"They have a great will to live, Roddy--much stronger than you and I, because we dissipate our will in so many directions.  I've met this determination before in growing things, though.  There are plants in the African jungle that you have to track and trail like wild beasts and do murder upon before they will die.  And this old prickly-pear is of the same family.  If a bit of leaf can break off and fly past you, it hides itself behind a stone, hastily puts roots into the ground, and grows into a bush before you can say 'Jack Robinson.'  Your farm will be a splendid place when we've got rid of all these and replaced them with the spineless plant.  Prickly-pear without spines is a perfect food for cattle and ostriches in this climate.\"  Thus he talked to Roddy, as if the latter were already a man and in possession of his heritage--the wide lands of Blue Aloes; but always while he talked, he looked at and considered the girl who stood aloof, wearing her air of world-weariness like a veil over the youth and bloom of her.  And she, on her side, was considering and reading him, too.  She liked him better, because, since that first night of Mr. van Cannan's departure, he had absented himself from the dinner-table.  That showed some glimmer of grace in him.  Still, there was far too much arrogance in his manner, she thought, and decided that he had probably been spoiled by too facile women.  Nothing blunts the fine spiritual side of a man's character so rapidly as association with women of low ideals. The romance of her own life had been split upon that rock.  She had known what it was to stand by and see the man she loved with all the pure idealism of youth wrecked by the cheap wiles of a high-born woman with a second-rate soul.  Perhaps her misfortune had sharpened her vision for this defect in men.  Certainly, it had tainted her outlook with disdain.  She sometimes felt, as Pater wrote of _Mona Lisa_, that \"she had looked upon all the world, and her eyelids were a little weary.\"  At any rate, when she found Dick Saltire's blue eyes looking into hers so straightly and significantly that it almost seemed as if an arrow came glancing from him to her, she merely told herself, with an inward-smiling bitterness, that no doubt the same phenomenon occurred when he spoke to Mrs. van Cannan.  Some days after the departure of the master of the farm for the coast, the post-bag arrived from Cradock, and, as Mrs. van Cannan was still sleeping, it fell to Christine, as it had sometimes done before, to distribute the mail.  Among her own large batch of home letters it was so unusual to find a South African one that she opened it immediately, and was astonished to discover it to be from Bernard van Cannan.  It had been written from Cradock on the evening of the day he left the farm.   \"DEAR MISS CHAINE:  \"I want once more to commend to you the very special care of my children while I am away.  My wife, not being very strong, is unable to see as much of them as she would wish, and I do not like her to be worried.  But there are many dangers on a farm, and I have already, by most unhappy chance, lost two young sons.  Both deaths occurred during absences of mine and were the result of accident, though, at the time, they were surrounded by every loving care and security.  Perhaps, therefore, you will understand the kind of superstitious apprehension I feel about Roderick, who is the last and only one left to come after me in the old place.  He has always needed special looking-after, being extremely curious and impulsive while, at the same time, nervous and reticent.  \"Perhaps it is only my illness that makes me full of fears, but _I can assure you that had it not been for the great confidence you have inspired in me from the first_, I should not have left the farm, so anxious do I continually feel about the welfare of my third and last son.  However, I trust in God I shall be back soon, better in health, to find that all is well.  \"Do not worry my dear wife with this matter.  She is of a disposition that cannot cope with sorrow and trouble, and I would not for the world cloud her happy outlook with my morbid fancies.  Keep my confidence, and remember that I rely on you with all my heart to guard my little ones.  \"Sincerely yours,  \"BERNARD VAN CANNAN.  \"P. S.--I append my last London address, and if I am detained for any time, I shall be glad to hear from you.\"   A vision of the gloomy-eyed man, twitching with pain and nerves, rose up before her eyes as she folded the letter, and she resolved to write to him at once, allaying his fears as much as possible by an assurance of her devotion.  She was sitting in the summer-house at the time, the children beside her, bent over their morning lessons.  Through the creeper-framed doorway, she could see the walls and veranda of the old farm, glaring white in the fierce sunlight, but with every line expressing such harmony as only the old Dutch architects seem to have had the secret of putting into the building of South African homesteads.  Before the front door stood three gnarled oaks, which yet bore the marks of chains used by the early van Cannans to fasten up the cattle at night, for fear of the hostile Kafirs who at set of sun came creeping over the kopjes.  Scores of fierce, man-eating dogs were kept to deal with the marauders, and there were still loopholes in the white walls from which those within had watched and defended.  But those days were long past.  Nothing now in the gracious building, with its shady stoeps and high, red roof, toned melodiously by age, to betoken battle, murder, and sudden death.  It seemed strange that sinister forebodings should attach themselves in any mind to such harmony of form and colour.  Yet Christine held in her hand the very proof of such thoughts, and, what was more, knew herself to be obsessed by them when darkness took the land.  For a moment even now, looking out at the brilliant sunshine, she was conscious of a falter in her soul, a moment of horrible loneliness, a groping-out for some human being stronger than herself of whom to take counsel.  A thought of Saltire flashed across her.  He looked strong and sane, kind and chivalrous.  But could he be trusted?  Had she not already learned in the bitter school of life that \"Ye have no friend but resolution!\"  A shadow fell across the doorway.  It was Saxby, the manager.  He gave her his pleasant, melancholy smile.  \"I wonder if Mrs. van Cannan is up yet,\" he said, in his full, rich voice.  \"There are one or two farm matters I want to consult her about.\"  Christine looked at the watch on her wrist and saw that it was past eleven.  \"Oh, I should think so, Mr. Saxby.  The closing of all the shutters is usually a sign that she is up and about.\"  It is, in fact, a practice in all Karoo houses to close every window and shutter at about ten o'clock each morning, not throwing them open again until sunset.  This keeps the interiors extraordinarily cool, and, as the walls are usually whitewashed, there is plenty of light.  \"I expect I shall find her in the drawing-room,\" Saxby remarked, and passed on.  Christine saw him leave again about half an hour later. Then the sound of waltz-music within the closed house told that Mrs. van Cannan was beguiling away the rest of the long, hot morning in a favourite fashion.  At noon, the heat, as usual, made the summer-house untenable, and its occupants were driven indoors.  Lunch introduced the only excitement the quiet monotony of the day ever offered, when the men came filing into the soft gloom of the dining-room, bringing with them a suggestion of a world of work that still went on its way, come rain, come shine.  All of them took advantage of the custom of the climate to appear coatless.  Indeed, the fashion of shirts was sometimes so _décolletée_ as to be slightly embarrassing to English eyes.  Only Saltire paid the company the compliment of unrolling his sleeves, buttoning the top button of his shirt, and assuming a tie for the occasion.  Everyone seemed of opinion that the summer rains were brewing and that was the reason of the insufferable heat.  \"We'll have a couple of days of this,\" prophesied Andrew McNeil, \"then down it will come with a vengeance.\"  \"The land wants it, of course, but it will be a confounded nuisance to me,\" remarked the forestry expert.  \"Oh, Mr. Saltire, you are insatiable in your work of murder,\" smiled his hostess.  \"Are you as merciless in all your dealings?\"  She looked at him with provoking eyes.  Christine hardened herself"]]]
