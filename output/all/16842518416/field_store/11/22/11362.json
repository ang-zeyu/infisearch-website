Consoled by their assurances, I returned once more to my studio, where the burning smell grew worse and worse. However, concluding that it was due to some fire in the neighbourhood, I settled down to work once more; but hardly had I taken my brush in hand when showers of sparks and particles of smouldering wood began to descend upon my head and shoulders, and cover the work I was engaged on. I started up, and looking up at my big sunlight, saw to my horror that I had wound up my easel, which is twelve feet high, and more nearly resembles a guillotine than anything else, so far that the top of it was in immediate contact with the gas, and actually alight!  [Illustration: FIRE!]  The _Times_ took the unusual course of giving, a month in advance of its opening on April 23rd, 1887, a preliminary notice of this Exhibition.  It said: \"A novel Exhibition, for which we venture to prophesy no little success, is being prepared by Harry Furniss of _Punch_ celebrity. As everyone knows, Mr. Furniss has long adorned the columns of our contemporary with pictorial parodies of the chief pictures of the Royal Academy, the Grosvenor, and other shows, and it has now occurred to him to develop this idea and to have a humorous Royal Academy of his own. He has taken the Gainsborough Gallery in Old Bond Street, which he will fill some time before the opening of Burlington House with a display of elaborate travesties of the works of all the best known artists of the day. There will be seventy pictures in black and white, many of them large size, turning into good-natured ridicule the works of every painter, good and bad, whose pictures are familiar to the public,\" etc., etc. This gives a very fair idea of the nature and objects of my \"Royal Academy.\" My aim was to burlesque not so much individual works as general style, not so much specific performances as habitual manner. As an example I take the work of that clever decorative painter and etcher, Mr. R. W. Macbeth, A.R.A. By his permission I here reproduce reductions in black and white of three of his well-known pictures, and side by side I show my parody of his style and composition--not, as you will observe, a caricature of any _one_ picture, but a boiling down of _all_ into an original picture of my own in which I emphasise his mannerisms. Furthermore, in my catalogue I parodied the same artist's mannerism in drawing in black and white, and with one or two exceptions this applies to all the works I exhibited. I hit upon a new idea for the illustrated catalogue. The illustrations, with few exceptions, did not convey any idea of the composition of the pictures, and in many cases they were designed to further the idea and object of the Exhibition by reference to pictures not included therein. My joke was that the Exhibition could not be understood by anyone without a catalogue, and the catalogue could not be understood by anyone without seeing the Exhibition. Therefore everyone visiting the Exhibition had to buy a catalogue, and everyone seeing the catalogue had to visit the Exhibition. _Q.E.D.!_ The idea, the catalogue, and everything connected with this \"Artistic Joke\" were my own, with the exception of the title, which was so happily supplied by Mr. Humphry Ward as the heading to the preliminary notice he wrote for the _Times_. _At the last moment_ I called in my fellow-worker on _Punch_, Mr. E. J. Milliken, to assist me with some of the letterpress of the catalogue and write the verses for it. I had all but a small portion of the catalogue written before he so kindly gave this assistance, but at the suggestion of a mutual friend I gave him half the profits of the catalogue, which amounted to several hundred pounds. I am obliged to make this point clear, as to my astonishment it was reported that the whole Exhibition was a joint affair, no doubt originated by Mr. Punch in a few lines: \"When two of Mr. Punch's young men put their heads together to produce so excellent a literary and artistic a joke as that now on view at the Gainsborough Gallery----\" This was accepted as a matter of fact by many, not knowing that this \"joke,\" my work of years, was a secret in the _Punch_ circle as outside it. The false impression which Mr. Punch had originated he corrected in his Happy Thought way: \"_The Artistic Jubilee Jocademy in Bond Street._--The fire insurances on the building will be uncommonly heavy because there is to be a show of Furniss's constantly going on inside. Why not call it 'Furniss Abbey Thoughts?'\"  [Illustration: POTATO GANG IN THE FENS.  TWITCH-BURNING IN THE FENS.  A FLOOD IN THE FENS.  THE PICTURES BY R. MACBETH.  _Reproduced by permission of the Artist._]  [Illustration: MACBETH IN THE FENS.  _My parody in \"An Artistic Joke\" of Mr. Macbeth's composition and style of work, showing that in my \"Academy\" I did not parody one subject, but designed a picture embodying all the characteristics of the Artist._]  The following brief correspondence passed between the President of the Royal Academy and myself:--       \"Mr. Harry Furniss presents his compliments to Sir Frederick      Leighton and trusts he will forgive being bothered with the      following little matter.       \"Sir Frederick is no doubt aware of Mr. Furniss's intention to have      a little Exhibition in Bond Street this spring,--a good-natured      parody on the Royal Academy. The title settled upon--the only one      that explains its object--is            \"HARRY FURNISS'S           \"ROYAL ACADEMY,           \"'AN ARTISTIC JOKE.'\"       \"In this particular case the authorities (Mr. Furniss is informed)      see no objection to the use of the word _Royal_ pure and simple,      but as a matter of etiquette he thinks it right to ask the question      of Sir Frederick Leighton also.       \"_March 11th, 1887._\"  [Illustration: LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL ACADEMY.]  A word or two may not be out of place here on the practical difficulties which beset an artist who opens an Exhibition on his own account, and is forced by circumstances to become his own \"exploiteur.\" Men may have worked with a more ambitious object, but certainly no man can ever have worked harder than I did at this period. Outside work was pouring in, my current _Punch_ work seemed to be increasing, but I never allowed \"Furniss's Folly\" (as some good-natured friend called my Exhibition at the moment) to interfere with it. I had only arranged with a \"business man\" to take the actual \"running\" of the show off my hands, and he was to have half the profits if there should happen to be any. At the critical moment, when I was working night and day at my easel, when in fact the \"murther was out\" and the date actually settled for the \"cracking\" of my joke--in short, when I fondly imagined that all the arrangements were made, I received a letter from my \"business\" friend backing out of the affair, \"as he doubted its success.\" Half-an-hour after the receipt of this staggerer (I have never had time to reply to it) I was dashing into Bond Street, where I quickly made all arrangements for the hire of a gallery and the necessary printing, engaged an advertising agent and staff, and myself saw after the thousand and one things indispensable to an undertaking of this kind. And all this extraneous worry continued to hamper my studio work until the Exhibition was actually opened. Of course I had to make hurried engagements at any price, and consequently bad ones for me. Every householder is aware that should he change his abode he is surrounded in his new home by a swarm of local tradespeople and others anxious to get something out of him. Well, my experience upon entering the world of \"business,\" hitherto strange to me, was precisely the same. All sorts of parasites try to fasten themselves on to you. Business houses regard you as an amateur, and consequently you pay dearly for your experience. You are not up to the tricks of the trade, and although you may not generally be written down an ass, you must in your new vocation pay your footing. It is therefore incumbent upon anyone entering the world of trade for the first time to keep his wits very much about him.  The local habitation for my Exhibition, which upon the spur of the moment I was fortunate enough to find in Bond Street, was called for some inexplicable reason the Gainsborough Gallery, and thereby hangs a tale. One afternoon there arrived a venerable dowager in a gorgeous canary-coloured chariot, attended by her two colossal footmen. She sailed into the gallery, which, fortunately for the old and scant of breath, was on the ground floor, and slightly raising the pince-nez on her aristocratic nose, looked about her with an air of bewilderment. Then going up to my secretary she said, \"Surely! these are not by Gainsborough?\"  \"No, madam,\" was the reply. \"This is the Gainsborough Gallery, but the pictures are by Harry Furniss.\"  Almost fainting on the spot, the old lady called for her salts, her stick, and her attendants three, and was rapidly driven away from the scene of her lamentable mistake.  The public attendance at the \"The Artistic Joke\" was prodigious from the first. Even upon the private view day, when I introduced a novelty, and instead of inviting everybody who is somebody to pay a gratuitous visit to the show, raised the entrance fee to half-a-crown, the fashionable crowd besieged the doors from an early hour, and made a very considerable addition to my treasury. Those of my readers, however, who did not pay a visit to the Gainsborough will be better able to realise the amount of patronage we received, notwithstanding the numerous attractions of the \"Jubilee\" London season, if I relate an incident which occurred on the Saturday after we opened. It was the \"private view\" of the Grosvenor Gallery, and the crowd was immense. Indeed, many ladies and gentlemen were returning to their carriages without going through the rooms, not, like my"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22689"],["title","The Confessions of a Caricaturist, Vol. 2 (#4)"],["body","the dowager, because they were disappointed at not finding the work of the old masters, but because the visitors were too numerous and the atmosphere too oppressive. As I passed through the people I heard a lady who was stepping into her carriage say to a friend, \"I have just come from 'The Artistic Joke,' and the crowd is even worse there. They have had to close the doors because the supply of catalogues was exhausted.\" This soon caused me to quicken my pace, and hastening down the street to my own Exhibition, I found the police standing at the doors and the people being turned away. The simple explanation of this was that so great had been the public demand that the stock of catalogues furnished by the printers was exhausted early in the afternoon, and as it was quite impossible to understand the caricatures without a catalogue, there was no alternative but to close the doors until some more were forthcoming.  Finding the telephone was no use, I was soon in a hansom bound for the City, intending by hook or by crook to bring back with me the much-needed catalogues, or the body of the printer dead or alive. Upon arriving in the City, however, to my chagrin I found his place of business closed, though the caretaker, with a touch of fiendish malignity, showed me through a window whole piles of my non-delivered catalogues. Not to be beaten, I hastened back to the West End and despatched a very long and explicit telegram to the printer at his private house (of course he would not be back in the City until Monday), requiring him, under pain of various severe penalties, to yield up my catalogues instanter. As I stood in the post office of Burlington House anxiously penning this message, and harassed into a state of almost feverish excitement, the sounds of martial music and the tramp of armed men in the adjacent courtyard fell upon my distracted ear. With a sickly and sardonic smile upon my face I laid down the pen and peeped through the door.  \"Yes! I see it all now,\" I muttered. \"The whole thing is a plant. The printer was bribed, and, _coûte que coûte_, the Academy has decided to take my body! Hence the presence of the military; and see, those cooks--what are they doing here in their white caps? My body! Ha! then nothing short of cannibalism is intended!\"  This frightful thought almost precipitated me into the very ranks of the soldiery, when I discovered that the corps was none other than that of the Artist Volunteers, which contains several of my friends. Seizing one of those whom I chanced to recognise, I hurriedly whispered in his ear the thoughts of impending butchery which were passing in my terrified mind. But he only laughed. \"You will disturb their digestions, my dear Furniss, some other way,\" he said, \"than by providing them with a _pièce de résistance_. Make your mind easy, for we are only here to do honour to the guests. This is the banqueting night of the Royal Academy.\"  From what I heard, some amusing incidents occurred in the house at my \"Royal Academy.\"  [Illustration: \"AN ARTISTIC JOKE.\"  _A portion of my parody of the work of Sir Alma Tadema, R.A._]  It was no uncommon sight to see the friends and relatives, even the sons and daughters, of certain well-known Academicians standing opposite the parody of a particular picture, and hugely enjoying it at the expense of the parent or friend who had painted the original. Other R.A.'s, who went about pooh-poohing the whole affair, and saying that they intended to ignore it altogether, turned up nevertheless in due time at the Gainsborough, where, it is true, they did not generally remain very long. They had not come to see the Exhibition, but only their own pictures. One glance was usually enough, and then they vanished. The critics (and their friends) of course remained longer. Even Mr. Sala went in one day and seemed to be immensely tickled by what he saw. Strange to relate, however, when he had passed through about one-third of the show, he was observed to stop abruptly, turn himself round, and flee away incontinently, never to be seen there again. I was much puzzled to discover a reason for this remarkable man[oe]uvre, the more so as at that time I had not wounded his _amour propre_ by indulging in an \"Artistic Joke\" of much more diminutive proportions at his expense, or, as it subsequently turned out, at my own. Since, however, the world-famous trial of _Sala_ v. _Furniss_ I have looked carefully over all the pictures in my Royal Academy, with a view to throwing some light upon the critic's abrupt departure. I remain, nevertheless, in the dark, for the most rigid scrutiny has failed to reveal to me one single feature in the show, not even a Grecian nose, or a foot with six toes, which could have jarred upon the refined taste of the most sensitive of journalists. I shall return to Mr. Sala in another portion of these confessions, but am more concerned now with the parasites, the artistic failures, the common showmen, the traffickers in various wares, and other specimens of more or less impecunious humanity, who applied to me to let them participate in the profits of a success which I had toiled so hard to achieve. In imitation of Barnum, I might have had, if I had been so inclined, a series of side shows, ranging in kind from the big diamond which a well-known firm in Bond Street asked me to let them exhibit, to the \"Queen's Bears\" and a curious waxwork of a bald old man which by means of electricity showed the gradual alterations of tint produced by the growth of intemperance. One of these applications I was for a moment inclined to entertain. It has more than once been proposed that to enable the British public to take its annual bolus at Burlington House with less nausea, the Royal Academy should introduce a band of some sort, so that under the influence of its inspiriting strains the masterpieces might be robbed of a little of their tameness, the portrait of My Lord Knoshoo might seem less out of place in a public Exhibition, and the insanities of certain demented colourists might be made less obtrusive monopolists of one's attention. Therefore, when \"a musical lady and her daughters\" applied to me for permission to give \"Soirées Musicales\" at the Gainsborough, it struck me for a moment that it would be effective to forestall the action of the Academy; but on second thoughts I reflected that as the Burlington House band would probably be of the same quality as the pictures, it would be adhering more closely to the spirit of my \"Artistic Joke\" if I gave my patrons a barrel organ or a hurdy-gurdy which should play the \"Old Hundredth\" by steam. Although one would have thought that a single visit of a few hours' duration would have sufficed to go through a humorous Exhibition of this kind, I found that several people became _habitués_ of the place, and paid many visits; but it is of course possible to have too much of a good thing, and a joke loses its point when you have too much of it. No better illustration of this can be afforded than in the case of my own secretary at the time, who had sat in the Exhibition for many months. One day, when the plates were being prepared for an album which I published as a souvenir of the show, the engraver arrived with a proof.  [Illustration: MR. SAMBOURNE'S PROSPECTUS.]  \"But there is some mistake here,\" said my secretary. \"We have no such picture as that on the premises.\"  The engraver was puzzled, and as he seemed rather sceptical upon the point, he was allowed to look round, and speedily found the picture he had copied. It had actually been close at my secretary's elbow since the \"Artistic Joke\" was opened to the public, but as the pictures were all under glass, I suppose he had only seen his own reflection when gazing at them. It was this perhaps which caused another gentleman whom I have before mentioned to beat so hasty a retreat. Both of them may have been frightened by what they saw.  The suggestion that I should be run as a public company emanated from the fertile brain of my friend Mr. Linley Sambourne. This is his rough idea of the prospectus:       This Company has been formed to acquire the sole exclusive      concession of the marvellous and rapid power of production of the      above-mentioned Managing Director, and to take over the same as a      going concern.       These productions have been in continual flow for many years past,      and are too well known to need any assurance of the possibility of      a failure of supply. It is therefore with the utmost confidence      that this sure and certain investment is now offered to the public      with an absolute guarantee of a percentage for Fifteen Years of      Forty-five per cent.       Mr. Furniss can be seen at work with the regularity of a threshing      machine and the variety of a kaleidoscope any day from 8 o'c. a.m.      to 8 o'c. p.m. on presentation of visiting card.
