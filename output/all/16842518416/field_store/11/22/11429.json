Between Bideford and Appledore, on this northern coast of Devon, stands Kenwith Castle--long called Hennaborough or Henry Hill--under whose walls the great Alfred and his son met the Danes under Hubba, and defeated them with great slaughter about the year 877.  The English captured the famous standard of the Danes, the Raven, which was \"wrought in needlework by the daughters of Lothbroc,\" and which had magical properties--clapping its wings when defeat was at hand.  The remnant of the Danish force, carrying their wounded leader with them, retreated to their ships, and Hubba died there on the beach, and was buried by his followers before they fled aboard, under a great rock called Hubba's Stone, and now in corrupt form Hubblestone, a name which still clings near the spot, though probably the rock of Hubba is now swept by the sea.  But under this rock he lies, with his weapons and trophies about him and his crown of gold on his head, until the last trump shall rouse him.  [Illustration: Bossington Hill from Porlock Hill]  The grave of Hubba lies under the sea, like King Arthur's lost country of Lyonesse, where the fisher-folk say they can hear the bells ring from the drowned churches as they sail over them on still summer mornings; but near Porlock the sea has yielded the strip of land it has stolen from Bideford, and the Danish long-ships rode what are now the green fields around Porlock.  That it was so the very name Porlock shows, for Port-locan means an enclosed place for ships, under which name it is mentioned twice in the Saxon Chronicle.  So the sea has retreated a mile and a half since the Danish raid of A.D. 918, when they entered the Severn, harried Wales, and landed at Porlock, only to be beaten back to their ships again by the Saxons.  Harold, the great English Harold who was slain at the Battle of Hastings, made a raid from Ireland in 1052.  He ran into Porlock with nine ships, landed and went several miles inland, killing and looting, and returned in safety.  But this filibustering expedition, so greatly to his discredit, and so unworthy to find a place among all his other acts, was almost certainly done in anger and dictated by personal revenge.  For Porlock, which was plainly an important harbour and one of the seats of the Saxon Kings--at least, it is mentioned as having a \"King's house\" there--was the property of Algar, the son of Leofric, Earl of Mercia.  But Harold was the son of Godwin, Earl of Kent, and Kent and Mercia were old and bitter enemies, and it was due to the intrigues of Mercia that Earl Godwin was banished, and Harold went with him to Ireland.  Then, fourteen years later, William came to an England weakened by internal strife, and Harold was slain at Hastings and the Saxon lords dispossessed of their lands and goods, which were given to the foreigner.  Here the Domesday Book, with its plain bare statements, gives us a grim record of the Conquest.  All, or almost all, the Saxon names of the overlords disappear, and the Norman take their place, continuing down to our own day.  This same Porlock was taken from Algar, son of Leofric, and given to Baldwin Redvers.  Countisbury was taken from Ailmer, and held by William himself.  Lynton was taken from Ailward Touchstone--it is interesting to find the name of Shakespeare's fool in Domesday Book--and held by William.  Combe Martin (then called \"Comba\") was taken from Aluric and held by Jubel.  Bideford and Clovelly were taken from Brihtric and given to Queen Matilda.  There is a curious and romantic story about this Brihtric, son of Aelfgar.  He was one of the most powerful of the Saxon Thanes, and seems to have owned lands not only in Devon, but in Dorset, Somerset, and even in Gloucester, though the latter entries in Domesday may refer to another Brihtric, who was not the son of Aelfgar.  When he was a young man, and before the marriage of Matilda to William of Normandy, Brihtric was sent by King Edward on a diplomatic mission to the Count of Flanders, Matilda's father, and there he met Matilda, who fell in love with him and offered herself in marriage.  He refused her, and she married William; but later, when the cycle of events put her old lover in the power of her husband, she sued for and obtained the grant of many of his lands.  Brihtric himself was seized at his house at Hanley, in Worcestershire, on the very day that Wulfstan had hallowed his chapel, and sent to Winchester, where he died in prison.  This story, which would have made a stirring theme for Sir Walter Scott, is found in the chronicles of Tewkesbury, in the Anglo-Norman chronicles, and in Wace, the old rhyming historian of the twelfth century.  Here are a few lines of the old French version:    \"Laquele jadsi, quant fu pucele,   Ama un conte dangleterre,   Brictrich Mau le oi nomer   Apres le rois ki fu riche ber;   A lui la pucele enuera messager   Pur sa amour a lui procurer;   Meis Brictrich Maude refusa,   Dune ele m'lt se coruca,   Hastivement mer passa   E a Willam bastard se maria.  which we may put into English so:    \"Who formerly, as a maiden,   Loved an English count,   Brihtric Maude heard him named;   And who, save the King, than he was richer?   To him the maiden sent a messenger   To obtain his love;   But Brihtric refused Matilda,   Whereat she waxed very angry,   Hastily passed over the sea   And married William the bastard.\"   But if this is one of the stories which is preserved to us, with its fierce love, and its fierce hate, and its unsparing revenge, and all the human hopes and acts and motives of which it gives but a bare hint--the pride of Brihtric perhaps, or perhaps his love for another woman, for an alliance with the Count of Flanders might satisfy an ambitious man--how many tragic dramas, how many stories of cruelty and oppression and exile and mourning, lie behind the bare short records of the Domesday Book?  All these sunny towns of North Devon and Somerset--Lynton, Crinton, Porlock, Countisbury, Paracombe, Challacombe, and north to Dunster, and south to Barnstaple and Bideford--all these wooded or wind-swept spots, which look as if they could have had no history, save of market-days and fairs, had their individual drama in that fierce annexation.  Sometimes, perhaps, they suffered hardly at all.  Their Saxon lord lived elsewhere; he was slain or banished, and they came imperceptibly under the Norman rule.  But more often, I imagine, particularly on the smaller estates, the lord dwelt in patriarchal intercourse with his tenants, with that freedom of speech and right of judgment, which, in \"Ivanhoe,\" Scott draws in the household and retinue of Cedric; and the eviction was bitter, and the rule of the new lord oppressive and hateful.  Domesday Book was compiled in 1086, twenty years after the landing of William, so that a new generation was already growing up, and the old scars were beginning to heal.  Here is a translation of the entry on Lynton:  \"William has a manor called Lintona, which Ailward Touchstone held on the day on which King Edward was alive and dead, and with this manor was added formerly another called Incrintona, which Algar held.  These are held by William for one manor, and they rendered geld for one hide. . . .  Lintona is worth four pounds and Incrintona three pounds.  When William received them Lintona was worth 20 shillings and Incrintona 15. . . .\"  It is interesting to note how all property throughout England had advanced in value since \"the day that King Edward was alive and dead\"; in the old English, \"on pam timan pe Eadward cing was cucu and dead\"--_i.e._, on the fifth of January 1066--which is a clear intimation that the firm rule of the Conqueror had increased the material prosperity of the country in one generation.  After the Conquest there was peace in Devonshire for many years, though Exeter was besieged by Stephen for three months in 1137, when he and Matilda, the mother of Henry II, rent England with a war of succession; but the young Henry came to the throne in 1152, and ruled wisely and strongly for thirty-five years.  Under him Devon prospered, as did all England, and the cloth-making industry, which in Westcote's time, in the seventeenth century, was so notable a part of the wealth of Devon, probably had its first considerable beginnings in this reign.  But Henry II is remembered less for his wise laws and far-sighted government than for the murder of Thomas Ã  Becket, which clouded his latter years and brought his enemies--his wife and his son among them--swarming about his ears.  This northern coast of Devon is linked with that dark crypt in Canterbury where Becket fell in the sacerdotal robes of High Mass; for it was a Tracy who was one of the four knights who spurred from London to rid Henry \"of this turbulent priest,\" and the Tracys owned Lynton, Countisbury, and Morthoe.  It is to Morthoe that Tracy is supposed to have come after the murder, with the curse upon him which descended to his family--that, wherever they went,          \"the Tracys   Have always the wind and the rain in their faces\"--  and to have lived out the bitter end of his life with the horror of sacrilege in his heart.  There is a monument in the church of Morthoe of William de Tracy, but it is of early fourteenth-century date, and belongs to a descendant of King Henry's knight, who was rector of the parish.  A later Tracy was Baron of Barnstaple, and was appointed Governor of the island of Lundy in the reign of Henry III.  Nearly a century later Edward II, flying from the armies of his Queen and the turbulent barons, took ship for Lundy, but was driven back to Wales by contrary winds.  And of this event a poem was made in the reign of James I, which is quoted by Westcote as written by a \"modern poet,\" though he does not give us the name.  The verse still retains a smack of the Elizabethan diction--not the Shakespeare magic, indeed, but the euphuistic, antithetical, fantastic balance of phrases:    \"To Lundy"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22765"],["title","Lynton and Lynmouth: A Pageant of Cliff & Moorland (#2)"],["body"," in Sabrin's mouth doth stand,   Carried with hope (still hoping to find ease),   Imagining it were his native land,   England itself; Severn, the narrow seas;   With this conceit, poor soul, himself doth please.   And sith his rule is over-ruled by men,   On birds and beasts he'll king it once again.\"   Devon took its unhappy share in the Wars of the Roses, and Perkin Warbeck besieged Exeter in 1497, but unsuccessfully, like most other exploits of that unlucky adventurer.  Fifty years later the West rose in arms against Henry VIII, in support of the \"old religion,\" and to protest against the dissolution of the monasteries; but the rising was put down, and Henry took and subdued Exeter, and carried through his bold and often ruthless policy.  But it is in the reign of Elizabeth that Devon takes on the special glamour with which it is still associated in most minds.  For it was the sixteenth century which gave to England such men as Richard and John Hawkins, Adrien and Humphrey Gilbert, John Davies--that sailor friend of Adrien Gilbert's who, inspired by him, made the first dark voyage into the Polar regions, and traded with the Esquimaux, as told in Hakluyt's \"Voyages\"--and Sir Richard Grenville, with his \"men of Bideford in Devon,\" with whom he fought the _Revenge_ single-handed against the fifty and three Spanish galleons in that last, greatest fight of all; and Sir Walter Raleigh, a philosopher among courtiers, a poet among princes, statesman, dreamer, adventurer, who planned nobly and executed daringly, and failed more greatly than other men succeed. Millais has drawn him for us, in his boyhood, sitting on the beach at Budleigh Salterton, with the wind blowing his hair round his sensitive, eager face, hugging his knees as he listens to the stories of the sailor with the bright parrot-feathers in his hat, one of the men, perhaps, who sailed with Frobisher or terrible John Hawkins, round the world to the far-off coasts of adventure, the lands of gold and spices. It is to Raleigh, and to his half-brother, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, that we owe the first colony of America, \"Virginia,\" called so by Raleigh from the Virgin Queen, in the compliment of his day--to them is due the praise of having seen that \"colonization, trade, and the enlargement of Empire, were all more important for the welfare of England than the acquisition of gold,\" and this in an age which was dazzled by the facilities of wealth lying ready to the greedy hand in that \"New World.\"  And this mind, so daring, so original, so diverse, which could turn a sonnet or design a battleship (for the _Ark Raleigh_, built after his plans, was admittedly the best ship of our fleet that met the Armada), which had experienced the favour and disfavour of princes in the fullest degree, which had known triumph and discouragement beyond the ordinary measure of humanity, turned in the last dark years of imprisonment to a steady contemplation of human activity, and, largely conceiving here, as in all else, planned a \"History of the World.\"  Let his own noble words be his epitaph:  \"O eloquent, just, and mighty Death! whom none could advise, thou hast persuaded; what none have dared, thou hast done; and whom all the world have flattered, thou only hast cast out of the world and despised; thou hast drawn together all the far-stretched greatness, all the pride, cruelty and ambition of man, and covered it all over with these two narrow words, 'Hic jacet.'\"  And then there was Drake--Drake, whose name perhaps overshadows all other names in Devon; Drake, who          \"was playing a rubber of bowls   When the great Armada came;\"  but, being told of the sighting of the fleet, remarked that \"they must wait their turn, good souls,\" and continued his game; Drake, who, the year before the sailing of the Armada, \"singed the King of Spain's beard\" most mightily, going up and down the coasts of Spain and Portugal, plundering and burning the ships in their very harbours; who sailed round the world, with the sun for \"fellow traveller,\" as an epitaph under his portrait in the Guildhall says of him; who, on the first independent expedition which he led to America, received a dangerous wound in his attack on Nombre de Dios, but concealed it from his men, and led them to the public treasury, telling them \"that he had brought them to the mouth of the treasury of the world,\" and then fainted over the great bars of silver and gold, and when they took him up he was losing \"so much blood as filled his very footsteps in the sand;\" Drake, who has become a legend and a myth in Devon, so that the country-people say that he brought water from Dartmoor to Plymouth, by compelling a stream to follow his horse's heels all the way into the town; who, like King Arthur and Barbarossa, is not dead, but will return again to his country if his people in their need strike on his drum and call him.  But beyond and behind all these great names, which ring in our ears like martial music, are the nameless crowd of Devon men who sailed with them, and fought with them, and worked with them, and loved them.  Men from Bideford and Appledore and Barnstaple, from Teignmouth and Budleigh and Dartmouth, from every little harbour along the bold north coast, from every creek and bay of the south, from the sheltered villages among their trees, from the wind-swept, hilly little towns, from the busy quayside or the lonely farm, came the men whose courage and whose will, whose love of profit and greater love of adventure, gave a lustre to England in the \"golden days of Elizabeth.\"  Those days passed, and were followed presently by the unhappy years of the great Civil Wars.  It was perhaps not unfitting that a Grenville--Sir Bevil Grenville--led an army against the Parliamentarian troops in the Battle of Lansdown Hill, though it was an army of Cornishmen he led, and not of Devonshire men, for the Grenvilles were then living at their Cornish home of Stowe.  Sir Bevil was killed in battle, but Anthony Payne, his servant, a great giant of a man, and a true friend to his master, set Sir Bevil's young son upon his father's horse, and bade him lead his father's men to victory, as, had he lived, his father would have done.  Afterwards Anthony Payne brought Sir Bevil's body back to Stowe, and he wrote to Lady Grenville a letter which deserves to be recorded for its true and simple dignity:   \"HONOURED MADAM,--  \"Ill news flieth apace: the heavy tidings hath no doubt already travelled to Stowe that we have lost our blessed master by the enemies' advantage.  You must not, dear lady, grieve too much for your noble spouse.  You know, as we all believe, that his soul was in heaven before his bones were cold.  He fell, as he did often tell us he wished to die, for the good Stewart cause, for his country and his King.  He delivered to me his last commands, and with such tender words for you and for his children as are not to be set down with my poor pen, but must come to your ears upon my best heart's breath. . . .  I am coming down with the mournfullest burden that ever a poor servant did bear, to bring the great heart that is cold to Kilkhampton vault.  Oh, my lady, how shall I ever brook your weeping face? . . .\"   This perhaps, is Cornish history and not Devonshire, except that the name of Grenville is so inseparably linked in our minds with Devon.  During the Royalist wars from 1642-1650 Exeter was twice besieged by the Parliamentarians; Ilfracombe twice changed hands, in 1644 being taken by Doddington for the Royalists, and two years later falling to Fairfax after his capture of Barnstaple; Tiverton also was besieged by the Royalists, though it seems to have held within itself the two irreconcilable factions.  But it was not in Devon that the fiercest battles of that time were fought, nor the greatest and bitterest disunion prevailed.  Of the subsequent history of Devon I shall say little.  The unhappy expedition of the Duke of Monmouth landed at Lyme Regis, just on the borders of Dorset and Devon, and he himself was joyfully received in Exeter; but it was in Somerset that the battle of Sedgemoor was lost, and Somerset that suffered chiefly from the Bloody Assizes.  Let us rather turn to the Devon of to-day, realizing with thankfulness that the traditions of Drake and Frobisher, of Grenville and Hawkins, still hold; that the heirs of the men who put out in their frail ships for the New World, now buffet round our wild coasts in minesweeper or trawler, destroyer or old cargo tubs, on a far more grim adventure. Without the hope of gain, without the spur of glory, from every port and harbour, from every creek and bay and inlet of our coasts comes the patient, silent, heroic service of the men of the sea.  And on many a hasty grave, in the shot-riddled mud of Flanders, or on the barren beaches of Gallipoli or the ruined lands of Babylon, might that poem of Sir Henry Newbolt's which he calls \"April on Waggon Hill\" be set up as a fitting epitaph:    \"Lad, and can you rest now,     There beneath your hill?   Your hands are on your breast now,     But is your heart so still?   'Twas the right death to die, lad,     A gift without regret,   But unless truth's a lie, lad,     You dream of Devon yet.    \"Ay, ay, the year's awaking,     The fire's among the ling,   The beechen hedge is breaking,     The curlew's on the wing;   Primroses are out, lad,     On the high banks of Lee,   And the sun stirs the trout, lad,     From Brendon to the sea.    \"I know what's in your heart, lad--     The mare he used to hunt,   And her blue market-cart, lad,     With posies tied in front.   We miss them from the moor road,     They're getting old to roam,   The road they're on's a sure road     And nearer, lad, to home.    \"Your name, the name they cherish?     'Twill fade, lad, 'tis true:   But stone and all may perish     With little loss to you.   While fame's fame you're Devon, lad,     The Glory of the West;   Till the roll's called in heaven, lad,     You "]]]
