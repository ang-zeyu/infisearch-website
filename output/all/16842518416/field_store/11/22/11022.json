This implies skilful accentuation of melody, subordination of accompaniment, increasing the tempo or force in some portions, decreasing them in others, _et cetera_. Clear enunciation and forceful declamation in choral music are also included, and in it all, the performer or conductor must so subordinate his own personality that the attention of the listeners will be centered upon the composition and not upon the eccentricities of dress or manner of the artist.  [Sidenote: THE BOUNDARIES OF MUSIC]  It is inevitable that there should be considerable difference of opinion among composers, critics, listeners, and performers, as to just what music may or may not legitimately be expected to express. Some modern composers are apparently convinced that it ought to be possible through music to suggest pictures, tell stories, or depict moral and intellectual struggles on the part of the individual. Others contend that music exists solely because of its own inherent beauty, that it can arouse _general_ emotional states only, and that if it is good music, it needs no further meaning than this. Even \"pure music,\" the champions of this latter idea urge, may express an infinite variety of emotional tones, from joy, encouragement, excitement, tenderness, expectancy, invigoration, and tranquillity, to dread, oppression of spirit, hesitation, harshness, and despondency. A modern writer on esthetics treats this matter at length, and finally concludes:[11]       Is the symbolization pervasive enough to account for the      steady continuing charm of lengthy compositions?... The      symbolizations ... mostly resemble patches; they form no      system, no plot or plan accompanying a work from beginning      to end; they only guarantee a fitful enjoyment--a fragment      here, a gleam there, but no growing organic exaltation like      that actually afforded by musical compositions.  [Footnote 11: Gehring, _The Basis of Musical Pleasure_, p. 89.]  At another point in the same work, this writer again discusses this same matter (page 120):       Music is presentative in character, not representative.      Measure, to be sure, may correspond to the beating of the      pulse, and the final cadence may picture the satisfaction of      desires; the coda may simulate a mental summary; but the      composition in its totality, with its particular melodies,      harmonies, and rhythms, and with the specific union of all      these elements characteristic of this composition, does not      represent any definite psychical or material fact.  The majority of us would doubtless take a middle-ground position, admitting the beauty and power of music, _per se_, but acknowledging also the fact that abstract beauty together with a certain amount of suggested imagery, in combination, will usually make a stronger appeal to the majority of people than either element by itself. Many of us are entirely willing to grant, therefore, that a more complex and more vividly colored emotional state will probably result if the auditor is furnished with the title or program of the work being performed; _but we contend nevertheless that this music, regardless of its connection with imagery, must at the same time be sound music, and that no matter how vividly descriptive our tonal art may become, if it cannot stand the test of many hearings as music, entirely apart from the imagery aroused, it is not worthy to endure_. It is not the _meaning_ of the music which makes us want to hear it repeated, but its inherent _beauty_; it is not usually our intellectual impression, but our emotional thrill which we recall in thinking back over a past musical experience.  Those of us who take the middle ground that we have just been presenting contend also that descriptive music can only legitimately arouse its appropriate imagery when the essential idea has been supplied beforehand in the form of a title or program, and that even then _the effect upon various individuals is, and may well be, quite different_, since each one has the music thrown, as it were, upon the screen of his own personal experience.  [Sidenote: EXPRESSION CONCERNS BOTH COMPOSER AND PERFORMER]  It will be noted that in this discussion we are constantly using the word _expression_ from the twofold standpoint of composer and performer, each having an indispensable part in it, and neither being able to get along without the other. But in our treatment of conducting, we shall need to come back again and again to the idea of expression from the standpoint of interpretation, and in directing a piece of music we shall now take it for granted that the composer has said something which is worthy of being heard, and that as the intermediary between composer and audience, we are attempting to interpret to the latter what the former has expressed in his composition. It should be noted in this connection that wrong interpretation is possible in music, even as in literature. One may so read a poem that the hearer, without being in any way to blame, will entirely miss the point. So also may one conduct a musical work, whether it be a child's song or a symphonic poem, in such a fashion that neither performers nor audience gain a proper conception of what it means.  [Sidenote: INTERPRETATION IN VOCAL MUSIC]  In the case of vocal music, the key to the emotional content of the work may almost always be found by carefully studying the words. In preparing to conduct choral singing, master the text, therefore; read it aloud as though declaiming to an audience; and when you come to the performance, see that your vocalists sing the music in such a way that the audience will be able to catch without too great effort both the meaning of the individual words and the spirit of the text as a whole.  The great Italian tenor Caruso expressed himself forcibly upon this point during an interview for the _Christian Science Monitor_, in 1913. In reply to the question \"Where do you locate the source of expression in singing?\" he said:       I find it in the words always. For unless I give my hearers      what is in the text, what can I give them? If I just produce      tone, my singing has no meaning.  \"Thereupon\" (continues the interviewer), \"vocalizing a series of scale passages such as are used in studio practice, Caruso commented\":       Now, when I do that, I don't say anything. I may make      musical sounds, but I express nothing. I may even execute      the notes with a good staccato or legato (again illustrating      with his voice) and still, having no words to go by, I make      no effect on my listeners.       Look at the question in another way. Suppose I were to sing      a line of text with a meaning in my voice that contradicted      the idea of the words. Would not that be nonsense? It would      be as much as though I were to say to you \"This wood is      hard,\" and were to say it with a soft voice. People have      observed that I sing as though I were talking. Well, that is      just what I mean to do.  \"Singing, then\" (the interviewer goes on), \"as Caruso began to define it, is a sort of exalted speech, its purpose being to illuminate the imagery and sentiment of language. The mere music of singing he seemed for the moment to put in a subordinate place.  \"By way of further emphasizing his point, he referred to a theme in Donizetti's _L'Elisir d'Amore_, which is used in two opposing situations--by the soprano in a mood of joy, and by the tenor in a mood of sorrow. He sang the measures of the soprano as though laughing. Then he sang those of the tenor as though weeping.\"       \"But those two passages of melody cannot be identical,\"      objected the interviewer.       \"Oh, yes, they are,\" the tenor declared; and he quickly      proved it by singing them over again with a less marked      indication of the moods. \"Here you plainly see where      expression must start. It has to be from the words, of      course. The performer puts in the feeling of gladness or      sadness without regard to the notes, paying attention only      to the text.\"  Expression in choral music is dependent upon the text to just as great an extent as in the case of solo singing; and choral conductors may well ponder upon the above words of one of the world's greatest singers, and apply the lesson to their own problems. The average audience is probably more interested in the _words_ of vocal music than in anything else; and since both vocal and choral performances are usually given before \"average audiences\" it behooves the conductor to look into the minds of those before whom he is directing, and to adapt the performance to the attitude of the listeners.     CHAPTER V  INTERPRETATION IN CONDUCTING  (_Continued_)  TEMPO   [Sidenote: EXPRESSION IN INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]  In the last chapter we discussed expression and interpretation from a general standpoint, closing with certain comments upon the interpretation of vocal music. But it must be admitted at once that expression in instrumental music is a vastly more intricate matter than in the case of vocal music; and in order to get at the subject in any tangible way, it will be necessary for us, first, to analyze music into its expressional elements; second, to decide which of these elements belong exclusively to the composer and which are shared by the interpreter; and third, to examine each of these latter elements in turn from the standpoint of the conductor as interpreter.  [Sidenote: THE ELEMENTS OF EXPRESSION]  There are eight elements upon which expression in instrumental music rests. These are:       1. Rhythm      2. Melody      3. Harmony      4. Pitch registers      5. Timbre      6. Phrasing      7. Tempo      8. Dynamics  Of these, the composer is able to indicate _exactly_ the first four, to convey his meaning fairly well in the fifth and sixth, but to give only a relative idea of the seventh and eighth."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22396"],["title","King Arthur's Knights (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team (https://www.pgdp.net)    Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustrations.

With Illustrations in Color by Walter Crane        Thomas Nelson and Sons New York, Edinburgh, London Toronto, And Paris      In tholdè dayès of the King Arthour,   Of which that Britons speken great honour,   All was this land fulfilled of faery.                         _The Canterbury Tales._    Printed in the United States of America     PREFACE   This book is an attempt to tell some of the stories of King Arthur and his Knights in a way which will be interesting to every boy and girl who loves adventures.  Although tales of these old British heroes have been published before in a form intended for young people, it is believed that they have never been related quite in the same spirit nor from the same point of view; and it is hoped that the book will fill a place hitherto vacant in the hearts of all boys and girls.  No doubt many of you, my young readers, have at some time or another taken down the _Morte D'Arthur_ from your father's bookshelves and read a few pages of it here and there. But I doubt if any of you have ever gone very far in the volume. You found generally, I think, that it was written in a puzzling, old-fashioned language, that though it spoke of many interesting things, and seemed that it ought to be well worth reading, yet somehow it was tedious and dry.  In the tales as I have retold them for you, I hope you will not find any of these faults. Besides writing them in simple language, I have chosen only those episodes which I know would appeal to you. I have added or altered here and there, for in places it struck me that there was just wanting a word or two to make you feel the magic that was everywhere abroad in those days. It seemed to me that some mysterious adventure might easily be waiting in the ruined and deserted Roman town on the desolate moor, or even just round the mossy trunk of the next oak in the forest-drive, through which the knight was riding; or that any fair lady or questing dog which he might meet could turn out to be a wizard seeking to work woe upon him. Nevertheless, I was always sure that in those bright days when the world was young, whatever evil power might get the mastery for a little while, the knight's courage, humility, and faith would win through every peril at the end.  In this book, besides reading of wonderful adventures and brave fighting, you will learn just what sort of man a perfect knight was required to be in the chivalrous times when men wore armour and rode on errantry. The duties of a 'good and faithful knight' were quite simple, but they were often very hard to perform. They were--to protect the distressed, to speak the truth, to keep his word to all, to be courteous and gentle to women, to defend right against might, and to do or say nothing that should sully the fair name of Christian knighthood.  Although, therefore, these stories of King Arthur and his men treat of knights and their ladies, of magical trolls and wonder-working wizards, and it might seem for that reason that they can have little or nothing in common with life of the present day, it will be seen that the spirit in which they are told conveys something which every boy can learn.  Indeed, the great and simple lesson of chivalry which the tales of King Arthur teach is, in a few words, to merit 'the fine old name of gentleman.'  The history of King Arthur and his Knights is contained in two books, one being the _Morte D'Arthur_, written by Sir Thomas Malory, the other being the _Mabinogion_, a collection of old Welsh stories, first translated by Lady Charlotte Guest in 1838. I have selected thirteen tales from the number which these two books contain; but there are many more, equally as interesting, which remain.  Little is known about Sir Thomas Malory, who lived in the fifteenth century. We only learn that he was a Welshman, a man of heroic mind who, as an old writer relates, 'from his youth, greatly shone in the gifts of mind and body.' Though much busied with cares of state, his favourite recreation was said to be the reading of history, and in this pursuit 'he made selections from various authors concerning the valour and the victories of the most renowned King Arthur of the Britons.' We know, further, that these selections or tales were translated mostly from poems about Arthur written by old French poets in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, and that Sir Thomas Malory finished his translation in the ninth year of King Edward the Fourth (1469). This, of course, was before printing was introduced into England, but no doubt many written copies were made of the book, so as to enable the stories to be read to the lords and ladies and other rich people who would desire to hear about the flower of kings and chivalry, the great King Arthur. When, in 1477, Caxton set up his printing press at Westminster, the _Morte D'Arthur_ was one of the books which then saw the light of day.  The _Mabinogion_, which contains other tales about King Arthur, is a collection of old Welsh romances. Though our earliest collection of them is to be found in a manuscript written in the thirteenth or fourteenth century, some of them are probably as old as the time when Welshmen clothed themselves in the skins of the beaver and the bear, and used stone for their tools and weapons.  It may be that, when you get older, you will go back to the two books I have mentioned, and you will find them so fascinating that you will be impatient of any other book which pretends to tell you the same tales. But until that time arrives, I hope you will find the stories as I have told them quite interesting and exciting.  HENRY GILBERT.  _June_ 1911.

OF THE REBELLION OF MORDRED AND THE DEATH OF KING ARTHUR    333     KING ARTHUR'S KNIGHTS     I  HOW ARTHUR WAS MADE KING AND WON HIS KINGDOM   In the hall of his Roman palace at London, King Uther, Pendragon of the Island of Britain, lay dying. He had been long sick with a wasting disease, and forced to lie in his bed, gnawing his beard with wrath at his weakness, while the pagan Saxons ravened up and down the fair broad lands, leaving in their tracks the smoking ruin of broken towns and desolated villages, where mothers lay dead beside their children on the hearths, fair churches stood pillaged and desecrated, and priests and nuns wandered in the wilds.  At length, when the pagans, bold and insolent, had ventured near London, the king had been able to bear his shame and anguish no longer. He had put himself, in a litter, at the head of his army, and meeting the fierce, brave pagans at Verulam (now called St. Albans) he had, in a battle day-long and stubborn, forced them at length to fly with heavy slaughter.  That was three days ago, and since then he had lain in his bed as still as if he were dead; and beside him sat the wise wizard Merlin, white with great age, and in his eyes the calmness of deep learning.  It was the third night when the king suddenly awoke from his stupor and clutched the hand of Merlin.  'I have dreamed!' he said in a low shaken voice. 'I have seen two dragons fighting--one white, the other red. First the white dragon got the mastery, and clawed with iron talons the red one's crest, and drove him hither and thither into holes and crannies of the rocks. And then the red one took heart, and with a fury that was marvellous to see, he drove and tore the white dragon full terribly, and anon the white one crawled away sore wounded. And the red dragon walked up and down in the place of his triumph, and grew proud, and fought smaller red dragons and conquered. Thus for a long time he stayed, and was secure and boastful. Then I saw the white dragon return with a rage that was very terrible, and the red dragon fought with him; but his pride had softened him, so he drew off. Then other red dragons came upon him in his wounds and beat him sore, which seeing, the white dragon dashed upon them all--and I awoke. Merlin, tell me what this may mean, for my mind is sore distraught with the vision.'  Then Merlin looked at the trembling king, wasted with disease, and in his wise heart was great pity.  'It means, lord,' he said in slow grave tones, 'that thy people shall conquer--that a red dragon shall rise from thy kin, who shall drive out the loathsome pagan and shall conquer far and wide, and his fame shall go into all lands and for all time.'  'I thank thee, Merlin, for thy comfort,' sighed the wearied king. 'I have feared me these"]]]
