The exorcists were a   recognised and respectable order in the Church. See id. iii.   for an account of the _Energumenoi_ or demoniacs. The lawyer   Ulpian, in the time of Tertullian, mentions the Order of   Exorcists as well known. St. Augustin (_De Civit. Dei_,   xxii. 8) records some extraordinary cures on his own   testimony within his diocess of Hippo.  Christian witchcraft was of a more tremendous nature than even that of older times, both in its origin and practice. The devils of Christianity were the metamorphosed deities of the old religions. The Christian convert was convinced, and the Fathers of the Church gravely insisted upon the fact, that the oracles of Delphi or Dodona had been inspired in the times of ignorance and idolatry by the great Enemy, who used the priest or priestess as the means of accomplishing his eternal schemes of malice and mischief. At the instant, however (so it was confidently affirmed), of the divine incarnation the oracular temples were closed for ever; and the demons were no longer permitted to delude mankind by impersonating pagan deities. They must now find some other means of effecting their fixed purpose. It was not far to seek. There were human beings who, by a preeminently wicked disposition, or in hope of some temporary profit, were prepared to risk their future prospects, willing to devote both soul and body to the service of hell. The 'Fathers' and great expounders of Christianity, by their sentiments, their writings, and their claims to the miraculous powers of exorcising, greatly assisted to advance the common opinions. Justin Martyr, Origen, Tertullian, Jerome, were convinced that they were in perpetual conflict with the disappointed demons of the old world, who had inspired the oracles and usurped the worship of the true God. Nor was the contest always merely spiritual: they engaged personally and corporeally. St. Jerome, like St. Dunstan in the tenth, or Luther in the sixteenth century, had to fight with an incarnate demon.  Exorcism--the magical or miraculous ejection of evil spirits by a solemn form of adjuration--was a universal mode of asserting the superior authority of the orthodox Church against the spurious pretensions of heretics.[37]    [37] The art of expelling demons, indeed, has been preserved   in the Protestant section of the Christian Church until a   recent age. The _exorcising_ power, it is remarkable, is the   sole claim to miraculous privilege of the Protestants. The   formula _de Strumosis Attrectandis_, or the form of touching   for the king's evil (a similar claim), was one of the   recognised offices of the English Established Church in the   time of Queen Anne, or of George I.  Christian theology in the first age even was considerably indebted to the Platonic doctrines as taught in the Alexandrian school; and demonology in the third century received considerable accessions from the speculations of Neo-Platonism, the reconciling medium between Greek and Oriental philosophy. Philo-Judæus (whose reconciling theories, displayed in his attempt to prove the derivation of Greek religious or philosophical ideas from those of Moses, have been ingeniously imitated by a crowd of modern followers) had been the first to undertake to adapt the Jewish theology to Greek philosophy. Plotinus and Porphyrius, the founders of the new school of Platonism, introduced a large number of angels or demons to the acquaintance of their Christian fellow-subjects in the third century.[38] It has been remarked that 'such was the mild spirit of antiquity that the nations were less attentive to the difference than to the resemblance of their religious worship. The Greek, the Roman, and the barbarian, as they met before their respective altars, easily persuaded themselves that, under various names and with various ceremonies, they adored the same deities.'[39] Magianism and Judaism, however, were little imbued with the spirit of toleration; and the purer the form of religious worship, the fiercer, too often, seems to be the persecution of differing creeds. Christianity, with something of the spirit of Judaism from which it sprung, was forced to believe that the older religions must have sprung from a diabolic origin. The whole pagan world was inspired and dominated by wicked spirits. 'The pagans _deified_, the Christians _diabolised_, Nature.'[40] It is in this fact that the entirely opposite spirit of antique and mediæval thought, evident in the life, literature, in the common ideas of ancient and mediæval Europe, is discoverable.    [38] 'The knowledge that is suited to our situation and   powers, the whole compass of moral, natural, and   mathematical science, was neglected by the new Platonists;   whilst they exhausted their strength in the verbal disputes   of metaphysics, they attempted to explore the secrets of the   invisible world, and studied to reconcile Aristotle with   Plato on subjects of which both these philosophers were as   ignorant as the rest of mankind. Consuming their reason in   those deep but unsubstantial meditations, their minds were   exposed to illusions of fancy. They flattered themselves   that they possessed the secret of disengaging the soul from   its corporeal prison; claimed a familiar intercourse with   demons and spirits; and by a very singular revolution,   converted the study of philosophy into that of magic.'--_The   Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_, chap. xiii.    [39] The Egyptians, almost the only exception to polytheistic   tolerance, seem to have been rendered intolerant by the   number of antagonistic animal-gods worshipped in different   parts of the country, enumerated by Juvenal, who describes   the effects of religious animosity displayed in a faction   fight between Ombi or Coptos and Tentyra.--_Sat._ xv.    [40] _Life of Goethe_, by G. H. Lewes.  The female sex has been always most concerned in the crime of Christian witchcraft. What was the cause of this general addiction, in the popular belief, of that sex, it is interesting to inquire. In the East now, and in Greece of the age of Simonides or Euripides, or at least in the Ionic States, women are an inferior order of beings, not only on account of their weaker natural faculties and social position, but also in respect of their natural inclination to every sort of wickedness. And if they did not act the part of a Christian witch, they were skilled in the practice of toxicology. With the Latin race and many European peoples, the female sex held a better position; and it may appear inconsistent that in Christendom, where the Goddess-Mother was almost the highest object of veneration, woman should be degraded into a slave of Satan. By the northern nations they were supposed to be gifted with supernatural power; and the universal powers of the Italian hag have been already noticed. But the Church, which allowed no miracle to be legitimate out of the pale, and yet could not deny the fact of the miraculous without, was obliged to assert it to be of diabolic origin. Thus the _priestess_ of antiquity became a _witch_. This is the historical account. Physically, the cause seems discoverable in the fact that the natural constitution of women renders their _imaginative_ organs more excitable for the ecstatic conditions of the prophetic or necromantic arts. On all occasions of religious or other cerebral excitement, women (it is a matter of experience) are generally most easily reduced to the requisite state for the expected supernatural visitation. Their hysterical (_hystera_) natures are sufficiently indicative of the origin of such hallucinations. Their magical or pharmaceutical attributes might be derived from savage life, where the men are almost exclusively occupied either in war or in the chase: everything unconnected with these active or necessary pursuits is despised as unbecoming the superior nature of the male sex. To the female portion of the community are abandoned domestic employments, preparation of food, the selection and mixture of medicinal herbs, and all the mysteries of the medical art. How important occupations like these, by ignorance and interest, might be raised into something more than natural skill, is easy to be conjectured. That so extraordinary an attribute would often be abused is agreeable to experience.[41]    [41] Quintilian declared, '_Latrocinium_ facilius in viro,   _veneficium_ in feminâ credam.' To the same effect is an   observation of Pliny: 'Scientiam feminarum in _veneficiis_   prævalere.'  According to the earlier Christian writers, the frailer sex is addicted to infernal practices by reason of their innate wickedness: and in the opinion of the 'old Fathers' they are fitted by a corrupt disposition to be the recipients and agents of the devil's will upon earth. The authors of the _Witch-Hammer_ have supported their assertions of the proneness of women to evil in general, and to sorcery in particular, by the respectable names and authority of St. Chrysostom, Augustin, Dionysius Areopagiticus, Hilary, &c. &c.[42] The Golden-mouthed is adduced as especially hostile in his judgment of the sex; and his 'Homily on Herodias' takes its proper place with the satires of Aristophanes and Juvenal, of Boccaccio and Boileau.[43]    [42]                               'They style a wife        The dear-bought curse and lawful plague of life,        A bosom-serpent and a domestic evil.'    [43] The royal author of the _Demonologie_ finds no   difficulty in accounting for the vastly larger proportion of   the female sex devoted to the devil's service. 'The reason   is easy,' he declares; 'for as that sex is frailer than man   is, so is it easier to be entrapped in the gross snares of   the devil, as was over-well proved to be true by the   serpent's deceiving of Eva at the beginning, which makes him   the homelier with that sex sensine:' and it is profoundly   observed that witches cannot even shed"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22832"],["title","The Cathedral Church of Canterbury [2nd ed.] (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: CANTERBURY CATHEDRAL FROM THE SOUTH.]                            THE CATHEDRAL CHURCH OF                               CANTERBURY                        A DESCRIPTION OF ITS FABRIC                       AND A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE                           ARCHIEPISCOPAL SEE                         BY HARTLEY WITHERS, B.A.                   [Illustration: Arms of Canterbury.]                     LONDON GEORGE BELL & SONS 1897                      _First Edition December, 1896._ _Second Edition, Revised, with many Additional Illustrations, May, 1897._         *       *       *       *       *     GENERAL PREFACE.   This series of monographs has been planned to supply visitors to the great English Cathedrals with accurate and well illustrated guide books at a popular price. The aim of each writer has been to produce a work compiled with sufficient knowledge and scholarship to be of value to the student of archæology and history, and yet not too technical in language for the use of an ordinary visitor or tourist.  To specify all the authorities which have been made use of in each case would be difficult and tedious in this place. But amongst the general sources of information which have been almost invariably found useful are:--firstly, the great county histories, the value of which, especially in questions of genealogy and local records, is generally recognized; secondly, the numerous papers by experts which appear from time to time in the transactions of the antiquarian and archæological societies; thirdly, the important documents made accessible in the series issued by the Master of the Rolls; fourthly, the well-known works of Britton and Willis on the English Cathedrals; and, lastly, the very excellent series of Handbooks to the Cathedrals, originated by the late Mr. John Murray, to which the reader may in most cases be referred for fuller detail, especially in reference to the histories of the respective sees.

CHAPTER I.  THE HISTORY OF THE BUILDING.   More than four hundred years passed by between the beginning of the building of this cathedral by Archbishop Lanfranc (1070-1089) and its completion, by the addition of the great central tower, at the end of the fifteenth century. But before tracing the history of the construction of the present well-known fabric, a few words will not be out of place concerning the church which preceded it on the same site. A British or Roman church, said to have been built by a certain mythical King Lucius, was given to St. Augustine by Ethelbert in A.D. 597. It was designed, broadly speaking, on the plan of the old Basilica of St. Peter at Rome, but as to the latest date of any alterations, which may or may not have been made by Augustine and his immediate successors, we have no accurate information. It is, however, definitely stated that Archbishop Odo, who held the see from A.D. 942-959, raised the walls and rebuilt the roof. In the course of these alterations the church was roofless for three years, and we are told that no rain fell within the precincts during this time. In A.D. 1011 Canterbury was pillaged by the Danes, who carried off Archbishop Alphege to Greenwich, butchered the monks, and did much damage to the church. The building was, however, restored by Canute, who made further atonement by hanging up his crown within its walls, and bringing back the body of Alphege, who had been martyred by the Danes. In the year 1067 the storms of the Norman Conquest overwhelmed St. Augustine's church, which was completely destroyed by fire, together with many royal deeds of privilege and papal bulls, and other valuable documents.
