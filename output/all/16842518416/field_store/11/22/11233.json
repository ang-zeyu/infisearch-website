CHAPTER I.  TWO TRAVELERS.   \"Well, that's a pretty nervy piece of business!\"  It was Frank Merriwell who spoke the words, more to himself than to any one else.  Frank was westbound, from Oklahoma City at the time, continuing the extensive tour mapped out after his Uncle Asher had died and left him so much money.  As readers of former books in this series know, Frank was not making the tour alone. Professor Scotch, his guardian, was with him as was also Barney Mulloy, his old schoolmate from Fardale. But, as the professor and Barney had not wanted to stop at Oklahoma, they had gone on ahead, leaving Frank to catch up with them later.  The \"nervy piece of business\" to which Frank referred was the following account of a hold-up published in a leading Oklahoma newspaper:       \"BLACK HARRY'S LATEST STROKE.       \"HE HOLDS UP AN EXPRESS TRAIN, AND SHOOTS AN EASTERN BANKER.       \"As we go to press, an imperfect account of Black Harry's latest      outrage reaches us from Elreno. Ten days ago this youthful      desperado was unknown to fame, but within that number of days he      has left a red trail from the Texas Panhandle to the Canadian      River. He began by raiding Moore's ranch, and killing a cowboy, and      he and his band of desperadoes, which he calls his 'Braves,' have      robbed and plundered and burned and murdered at their own sweet      will, till the climax was capped last night by the holding up of      the northbound express on the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific,      shortly after leaving Chickasha and crossing the Washita. Between      Chickasha and Minco is a twenty-mile stretch of desolate track, and      a better place for a train hold-up could not be found.       \"Just how the express was stopped we do not know at present, but      the trick was accomplished, and Black Harry and his Braves boarded      the cars. Strangely enough, they did not attempt to enter the      express car, but were satisfied to go through the train hastily and      relieve the passengers of their valuables. In this work, Black      Harry took the lead; but Mr. Robert Dawson, an Eastern banker, who      happened to have quite a sum on his person, objected, and snatched      the mask from the young ruffian's face. Before the eyes of Miss      Lona Dawson, who was traveling with her father, Black Harry      deliberately shot the banker down, and then relieved him of his      watch, diamond pin, and pocketbook, having first re-covered his      face with the mask.       \"The robbers made a hasty but very thorough job of it, leaping from      the train at a signal from their boy leader, and quickly      disappearing in the darkness. But Black Harry's face was seen      fairly by the banker's horrified daughter, and by several other      passengers, so there will be no trouble in identifying him if he is      captured. Sheriff Kildare, of Canadian County, is aroused, and      Burchel Jones, an Eastern detective, has promised to round up Black      Harry within a very short time. Let us hope, for the good of the      Territory, that the young ruffian's career may be quickly      terminated, and that he may receive his just due at the hands of      the law.       \"Mr. Dawson was taken to Elreno, where a surgical operation was      performed. He is still alive, but his chance of recovery is small.      His daughter, who seems to be a girl of spirit, has stated that, if      her father dies, she will know no rest nor spare no expense till      Black Harry is run to earth.\"  The article terminated abruptly, showing it had been hastily written, and had been inserted at the last moment before publication.  \"Truly an outrage!\" Frank continued. \"It would be a good scheme to organize a hunting party, and give this Black Harry a run for it.\"  \"Just my idea,\" said an oily voice, as a man slipped into the seat beside the young traveler, without as much as saying \"by your leave.\" \"The people out here do not seem to mind these things. I suppose they are used to them.\"  Frank glanced the speaker over, with a pair of searching, brown eyes. He saw a slender figure in a well-worn suit of gray. The striking features of the man's face were his eyes and his nose. His eyes were too near together, and his nose was long and pointed. He was smooth-shaved, and there was a cunning, foxy look about his face.  Frank did not seem in any hurry about speaking; he continued to inspect the man, who moved restlessly beneath the scrutiny, and said:  \"I have not been very long in this country, but I have noted the peculiarities of the people. They do not seem to have time to bother much about an affair like this train hold-up, and the shooting of an occasional tenderfoot, as they call all Easterners. If they should happen to capture Black Harry, they would give him their full attention for a short time--a very short time. They would be pretty sure to lynch him, as they would consider that the easiest way of disposing of him, and they would not consider it worth while to spend time in giving him a regular trial. To be sure, this train robbery and tragedy occurred in Indian Territory, but I understand that Hank Kildare, the sheriff at Elreno, has offered three hundred dollars reward for the capture of Black Harry himself, and fifty dollars each for his men. Er--ah--ahem! My name is--Walker. I am from Jersey.\"  Frank bowed.  \"How do you do, Mr.--er--ah--Walker. I presume that what you say about Black Harry's chances, if he is captured, is quite true--he will be lynched.\"  \"Oh, it is not certain, of course; he might obtain protection by officers of the law. But he would stand a good show of being lynched. And Elreno is the worst place in Oklahoma for him to show his face in at present.\"  \"I should presume it might be. Dawson, the wounded banker, is there?\"  \"And his daughter--can she identify this young desperado the moment she sees him?\"  \"Without doubt.\"  \"Black Harry will be very foolish if he goes to Elreno.\"  \"He is not likely to go there, I fancy.\"  \"I don't know about that. He is a dare-devil fellow.\"  \"So it seems.\"  \"And he might take a fancy that Elreno would be the last place where he would be expected to appear, and so he would go there.\"  \"He might do that.\"  \"Now, in your own case, if you were Black Harry, for instance, you might put on a bold face, and show yourself in Elreno, while everybody outside that town would be on the lookout for you.\"  \"Possibly, you are right.\"  \"I think such a trick would be very like Black Harry. He might go so far as to take the train to Elreno from some place that would make it seem that he could not have been in the locality where the hold-up was "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22571"],["title","Frank Merriwell's Bravery (#1)"],["body","committed. If he were to come into Elreno on this train, for instance, it would be a blind.\"  \"How far is Oklahoma City from the place where the train was robbed?\"  \"Between thirty and forty miles, direct.\"  \"That distance could be made on horseback between the time of the robbery and this morning--do you think so?\"  \"Well, it is very likely. What do you think, Mr.--ah--er--I beg your pardon?\"  \"My name is Frank Merriwell.\"  \"Really?\"  Walker lifted his eyebrows in a very odd manner, which Frank did not fail to observe.  \"You appear as if you doubted me,\" came a trifle warmly from the lad's lips, while the color rushed to his cheeks.  \"Oh, not at all--not at all! You are in Oklahoma on business?\"  \"No, sir.\"  \"Not?\"  \"No.\"  \"Pleasure?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"How? Traveling?\"  \"I am.\"  \"Alone?\"  \"No.\"  \"Didn't notice you had company.\"  \"I have not, at present.\"  \"H'm! Ha! Your friends--are they on this train?\"  \"No, sir.\"  Walker elevated his eyebrows again. His nose seemed longer and more pointed than ever. It was a nose that reminded the boy of an interrogation point. It seemed built to thrust itself into other people's business.  \"Ha! Not on the train?\"  \"No.\"  \"You expect to meet them?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Where?\"  \"In Elreno.\"  \"How many of them?\"  \"Two.\"  \"No more?\"  \"No.\"  Frank was answering curtly, and his manner announced his dislike for his inquisitive companion. Still, he was courteous and cool, holding himself in check.  \"I presume your companions are older than yourself?\" questioned the prying Jerseyite, his small eyes glistening.  \"One is; the other is a boy about my age.\"  \"Ha! H'm! Just so. You are from the East, I presume?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"It seems to me that I have seen you before, but I cannot remember where it was. And I do not remember your name. Do you mind giving me the names of your traveling companions?\"  \"Not at all. They are Professor Horace Orman Tyler Scotch, of Fardale Military Academy, sometimes known as 'Hot' Scotch, as he has a peppery temper, and the initials of his first three names form the word 'hot.' The other is Barney Mulloy, a youth who was born in Ireland, and has not recovered from it yet. The latter was a classmate of mine at Fardale, and he is traveling with me as a friendly companion, which he can afford to do, as I pay all the bills.\"  \"Haw!\" exclaimed Walker. \"You must have money to burn!\"  \"No, I have not. My uncle left me a comfortable fortune, and his will provided that, in order to broaden my knowledge of the world, I should travel in company with my guardian. He selected Professor Scotch as a proper man to become my guardian, and specified that I might take along a schoolmate as a companion, if I so desired.\"  \"Re-e-markable!\" cried Walker. \"A most astonishing will! And how does it happen that you have become separated from your guardian and friend?\"  \"We were going through to Texas on the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific. I wished to visit Guthrie, the capital of Oklahoma, and they did not care to do so. I left them at Caldwell, in Kansas, with the understanding that they were to proceed to Elreno, and wait for me there.\"  \"H'm!\"  Walker's nose seemed pointing at the boy like an accusing finger. Doubt was expressed all over that foxy face.  \"You tell it well,\" said the man, with another queer lifting of his thin eyebrows.  \"What do you mean by that?\" demanded the youth, sharply, wheeling squarely toward Walker. \"Do you insinuate that I am not telling the truth?\"  Before Walker could reply, a commotion arose in the seat directly behind them.     CHAPTER II.  \"HANDS UP!\"   \"Aw! Thay, weally, this ith verwy impudent, don't yer know!\" drawled a languid voice. \"What wight have you to cwout yourthelf into a theat bethide a gentleman, thir?\"  \"I don'd seen der shentleman anyvere,\" replied a nasal voice, a voice that had the genuine Jewish sound.  \"Thir! Do you mean to thay I am no gentleman, thir?\"  \"Vell, I don'd mean to say nodding aboud id. I don'd vant to hurd your veelings.\"  \"You insulting w'etch!\"  \"Don'd get excided, mein friendt.\"  \"Will you leave thith theat, thir?\"  \"Cerdinly I vill--ven I leaf der drain.\"  \"I thall call the conductor!\"  \"Don'd vaste your preath--peckon to him.\"  \"Thir, I would have you understand that my name ith Cholly Gwayson De Smythe.\"  \"Vell, I vos bleased to meed you. Anypody vould be pleased shust to dake a look ad you.\"  \"Thir!\"  \"My name vas Solomon Rosenbum, vid the accent on der bum. Shake handts vid yourself.\"  By this time everybody in the car was staring at the Jew and the dudish fellow beside whom Solomon had taken a seat. The latter was a youth of uncertain age, with an insipid mustache, a sallow face, and spectacles of colored glass, which seemed to indicate that he had weak eyes. He was dressed, as far as possible, in imitation of an English tourist.  The Jew, who had given his name as \"Solomon Rosenbum, vid der accent on der bum,\" was a rather disreputable-looking man of about thirty, having the appearance of the Jew peddler, and carrying a pack, which he had stuffed down between his knees and the back of the next seat, thus completely fencing in Cholly De Smythe.  \"Will you wemove yourthelf fwom this theat?\" squawked the dude, in a flutter.  \"Say, mein friendt, you vas nervous. Now, I dell you vat you do vor dat. Shust dake a pottle of Snyde's Shain-Lighdning Nearf Regulardor. Id vill simbly gost you von tollar a pottle, dree bottles vor dwo tollars. I haf shust dree pottles left. Vill you dake 'em?\"  Solomon began to untie his pack.  \"Stop it!\" squealed Cholly, in terror. \"I don't want your nawsty stuff, don't yer know!\"  \"Berhaps I know petter dan vat you do. I haf studied to pe a horse toctor, und I make a sbecialty uf shack-asses.\"  \"You wude thing!\"  The other passengers in the car were enjoying all this, and the laughter that had begun with the first passage between the two now threatened to swell to a tumult.  \"Uf one pottle don'd gure you, der dree pottles vill--or kill you, und nopody vill mindt dot.\"  \"Go'way!\"  \"Vill you half der dree pottles?\"  \"No, thir!\"  \"Veil, dake von uf dem ad sefenty-fife cends.\"  \"Get out!\"  \"I alvays haf von brice vor all uf mine goots, und I nefer make a bractice uf dakin' off a cend; but I see dat you vas on der verge uf nerfus brosdration, und I vant to safe your life, so I vill sell you von pottle vor a hellufer-tollar.\"  \"I don't want it--I won't take the nawsty stuff!\"  \"Dat vas too sheap at hellufer-tollar, but in your gase I vill make an eggsception, und you may haf von pottle vor a qvarter. Dake id qvick, before I shange my mindt.\"  \"Help! Take the w'etch away!\"  \"Moses in der pulrushes! Vat you vant? Vas you dryin' to ruin me? Dot medicine gost me ninedy-dree cends a pottle, und I don'd ged a cend discoundt uf I puy dwo pottles. Dake a pottle ad dwenty cends, und I vill go indo pankrupcy.\"  \"Conductaw! Conductaw!\" squawked Cholly.  \"What is all this noise about?\" demanded the conductor, as he came hastily down the aisle and stood scowling at Cholly.  He had overheard all that passed, and he was enjoying it as much as any of the passengers.  \"Conductaw,\" said the dude, with great dignity, \"I wish you to instantly wemove this verwy insolent cwecher. He cwoded in thith theat without awsking leave.\"  \"Have you paid for a whole seat?\"  \"I have paid one fare, thir, and ----\"  \"So has this gentleman. He is entitled to half of this seat, if he chooses to sit here. Don't bother me again.\"  The conductor walked away, and Cholly looked at Solomon, faintly gasping:  \"Thith gentleman! Gweat Scott!\"  Then he seemed to collapse.  Solomon grinned, and lifted his hat to the conductor. Then he turned to Cholly.  \"Vill you half a pottle uf der Nearf Regulador ad dwendy cends?\"  \"Let me out!\" gurgled the dude. \"I will not stay heaw and be inthulted!\"  \"Set down,\" advised the Jew. \"You ain'd bought a pottle uf medicine, und I can'd boder to mofe vor you.\"  Cholly fell back into his seat, giving up the struggle. He turned his head away, and looked out of the window, while Solomon talked to him for ten minutes, without seeming to draw a breath. Cholly, however, could not be induced to purchase a single bottle of the \"Nearf Regulador.\"  All through this, Mr. Walker had not seemed to remove his keen eyes from the face of the boy at his side. The lad apparently enjoyed the affair between the Jew and the dude as much as any one in the car, laughing merrily, and seeming quite at ease.  Somehow, Walker did not seem to be pleased at all. He appeared like a man with a very little sense of humor, or he had so much of grave importance on his mind that he did not observe what was going on behind him.  When Cholly De Smythe had collapsed, and the Jew had ceased to talk, the boy squared about in his seat, and seemed to settle to take things in the most comfortable manner possible. He pulled his hat over his forehead, and continued his perusal of the newspaper.  This did not satisfy his seat mate.  \"You seem to be very interested in that paper,\" said Walker.  \"I am,\" was the curt return, and the boy continued reading.  \"You are not much of a talker.\"  \"You are.\"  \"H'm! Ha! I am; I am very sociable.\"  \"So I observed.\"  \"I have been wondering what we would do if a band of robbers was to hold up this train.\"  \"I am sure I cannot tell what I would do. I scarcely think any person can tell what he would do in such a case till he meets the emergency.\"  \"I presume you go armed?\"  \"In the West--yes.\"  Walker's thin nose seemed to resemble a wedge which he was driving deeper and deeper with each question.  \"Would you mind permitting me to look at your revolver?\"  \"Yes.\"  The boy uttered that word, and remained silent, without offering to take the weapon out.  Walker coughed.  \"H'm! Ha! I think you misunderstood me.\"  \"I think not.\"  \"I asked you if you would mind letting me look at your revolver.\"  \"And I said I would mind.\"  \"Oh!\"  The Jew's voice sounded in Walker's ear.  \"I haf a revolfer vat I vill sell you sheep.
