Nor is this to be wondered at when we consider the variety and the loveliness of the scenery, the great open, heathery wastes of Exmoor, the wind-swept cliffs and highlands, the fair and luxuriant valleys where the pure bright waters of these hill-fed streams flow through a green tunnel of overarching trees, making a fertile paradise of flower and fern in their course.  And the magnificent bold rocks and forelands of the coast, the streams broken into feathery spray falling down the precipitous face of the cliffs, creek and gully and cave, the wave-washed golden sands of the bays, or the line of foam fretting ever at the foot of these granite crags.  And beyond is the sea; from every hilltop the eye turns to it, in the sheltered orchards the air is salt with it, the thunder of its great breakers on the coast can be heard far inland, an undercurrent beneath the singing of birds and the hum of bees; it is never far from the eyes or from the mind, blue as faery under a June sun, when the wheeling gulls are dazzling white flashes above it, broken into greys and greens and purples by the sudden hail of quick spring squalls, a heaving grey waste of waters under steady rain, or a wild and elemental force, terrible and splendid, under the fury of a gale.  It is a land for poets and dreamers, a land to touch the fancy and stir the imagination of men, a land of beauty and of adventure.  It will not, therefore, be without interest to pick up thread after thread by which the ports and hamlets, woods and waterfalls, are woven into the history of our literature.  [Illustration: Dunkerry Beacon]  We find a trace, firstly, of the chief of poets and greatest name of all--Shakespeare--in the municipal records of Barnstaple, where under the date 1605 an entry records: \"Geven to the Kynges players being in the town this year xs.\"  That is all, and Shakespeare is not named; but we know that he was associated with the Kynges Players for many years, and Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps, who is a well-known authority on this subject, asserts that at this date Shakespeare was still one of the company.  It is a shadowy trace enough, but in view of the bare outlines of the life and death of this man, whose name is almost universal and whose history is almost completely obscure, we seize on any tiny fact that may help to bring before us so wonderful a personality.  That Shakespeare was in Barnstaple, went up and down Boutport Street, the old street that half encircles the town, running \"about the port,\" that he acted here, lodged here, if only for a week or two, talked in the tavern and walked in the old town, with that observant inner eye which noted the veriest detail of life, the swing of a flower, the swallow under the eaves, the idiosyncrasy of dress or gesture in the passers-by, and at the same time comprehended and recorded the springs of action, the fumbling thoughts, the consciences, the strivings, and the pretences, of the world of men and women that moved around him--that Shakespeare was, once in his short and wonderful life, actually in Barnstaple gives even to the most unreflective an interest and a romance to this town.  It was near Barnstaple, also, and during Shakespeare's lifetime, that Thomas Westcote, gentleman, was born at Westcote, in the parish of Marwood, in 1567.  He wrote, towards the end of his life, a description of the country called \"A View of Devon,\" and a genealogy of the principal families.  It was not published until 1845, but is well worthy of being preserved, not only for its antiquarian interest, as being the earliest account of Devonshire, its agriculture and its industries, but also for the pleasure of its quaint turns of phrase, the ponderous classic authorities which he marshals to support a simple fact--and there are indeed some strange wild-fowl among his authorities--and above all for a gentle and unobtrusive humour which seasons all the narrative.  Westcote gives a list of the fish afforded by the Devon seas (a very imperfect list by modern computation), and adds:  \"It might be much more enlarged, but your server shall stand no longer at the dresser, lest the first dish be stale ere the last come to the table.  Yet, notwithstanding, I will here confess that had you supped with Aulus Gellius, the Roman Emperor, you might say my bill came much too short; yea! by 1800; for as Suetonius, in lib. 9, and Josephus, lib. 5, alledge, he was served at one meal with 2,000; (if you please to believe there are so many species of fish;) but he had indeed a large country to make his provision in, the whole then known world. . . .  But for the other supper of 7,000 divers kinds of fowls, I will not undertake to name them here, nor in Africa, and Asia, with all the assistance that Gesnerus can afford me.\"  This is a style without hurry, indeed, in a peaceable rambling world, and one can imagine Westcote, with his pointed beard and his tall hat of the fashion of James I., taking a little walk in the afternoon sun after having spent the morning with his quill-pen and his calf-bound, close-printed classics--Suetonius, and Gesnerus, and Diodorus Siculus. His book is interspersed with little rhymes, couplets or longer verses, in the style of the \"Arabian Nights\" stories, and which George Meredith in the \"Shaving of Shagpat\" has used with such quaint effect; on every subject and for every statement Westcote has an authority and an aphorism, whether it is of \"Day labourers in Tin-works, and Hirelings in Husbandry,\" of fishermen or merchantmen, of trade or agriculture--\"for, as Horace speaketh,\" says he,    \"Who much do crave, of much have need;   But well is he whom God indeed,   Though with a sparing hand, doth feed.\"  Or again, speaking of \"the commodities this country yields\":    \"England hath store of bridges, hills, and wool,   Of churches, wells, and women beautiful.\"   He is no mere antiquarian, however, and quotes Chaucer and Robert of Gloucester as well as Theocritus and Horace; he is seriously perturbed at the decline of agriculture in Devonshire; in spite of the fertility of the soil, he says, it yields insufficience of bread, beer, and victual, to feed itself, for which the country has to have recourse to Wales or Ireland, so much so that in 1610 there was 60,000 pounds of corn brought into one harbour alone.  The reason for this is the increase in trades, so that . . . \"the meanest sort of people will now rather place their children to some of these mechanical trades than to husbandry\"; in spite, also, of the almost sacred character of husbandry, which was clearly recognized in \"elder times,\" so that even the rudest and most savage peoples respected ploughmen and tillers of the soil in time of war.  He then quotes some melancholy verses of Virgil, and gives the whole chapter a twist of humour by ending up with--\"But not a word of this in any case, especially that I told you so; and we will proceed to the next and speak of mines.\"  I will also \"proceed to the next,\" and speak of Bishop Jewel, a fellow-countryman of Westcote's, and one about whom he speaks in the highest praise: \"a perfect rich gem and true jewel indeed . . . so that if anywhere the observation of Chrysostom be true, that there lies a great hidden treasure in names, surely it may rightly be said to be here: grace in John, and eminent perfection in jewel.\"  John Jewel was born at Berrynarbor, near Ilfracombe, in 1522; he went to Merton College, Oxford, where he had for tutor John Parkhurst, under whom he early acquired a bent towards Protestantism.  After the accession of Mary he allowed himself, in a moment of weakness, to sign an adherence to the Romish faith, but his recantation weighed upon his conscience, he fled to the Continent, and there publicly withdrew it. In the reign of Elizabeth he returned to England, and was one of the Protestant doctors chosen to dispute before her at Westminster with a like number of Catholic divines.  He became Bishop of Salisbury in 1560, and held that office till his death in 1571.  His chief work was an \"Apology for the Anglican Church\"; and his chief opponent was Thomas Harding, who was born at Comb Martin, the next parish, and who, like Jewel, went to the grammar-school at Barnstaple in his early boyhood, so that they were near neighbours and dear enemies.  \"As I cannot well take a hair from your lying beard, so I wish I could pluck malice from your blasphemous heart,\" says Harding to Jewel, in that savage personal invective that religious controversialists have permitted themselves in all ages.  Jewel does not seem ever to have answered in this unworthy strain, and the singular purity of his life, the sincerity of his opinions, and a certain lovable quality to which all his contemporaries bear witness, gave even his political adversaries a personal attachment to him.  \"I should love thee, Jewel, wert thou not a Zwinglian,\" cries one.  \"In thy faith thou art a heretic, but sure in the life thou art an angel\"--surely the most splendid tribute that a man can have, when we consider the bitterness and animosity bred by a difference of religious belief.  To all who loved him--and it seems to have been his whole generation--his name gave the opportunity of affectionate puns, quips, and little epigrams; to Queen Elizabeth he was \"my Jewel,\" and the epitaph Westcote makes upon him is that of St. Gregory upon St. Basil: \"His words were thunder, and his life lightning,\" and his memory \"a fragrant sweet-smelling odour, blown abroad . . . throughout the whole kingdom.\"  We may find a lingering trace at Barnstaple, also, before going farther north, of another eager spirit and earnest reformer, Shelley, whose gift of poetry we accept, and whose quick courage we profit by, in a world of thought where we breathe a little"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22765"],["title","Lynton and Lynmouth: A Pageant of Cliff & Moorland (#4)"],["body","because of his efforts and ideals, while we still despise or half shamefacedly apologize for the strivings and struggles of his life.  He prevailed upon Syle, a printer of Barnstaple, to publish his \"Letter to Lord Ellenborough,\" which was in effect a violent and heated attack upon this Judge for the sentence he had passed on the publisher of Tom Paine's \"Age of Reason,\" which was considered by Lord Ellenborough and that generation as a dangerous and revolutionary document, subversive of the political morals of the world.  Those were the days of the French Revolution, and it seemed to many, as honest as Shelley, that the whole social fabric was threatening to crumble before the rising flood of anarchy, bloodshed, and disorder.  Syle was prevailed upon to withdraw the greater number of copies--it speaks much for his courage and convictions that he ever published it--and Shelley found it advisable to leave Devon.  For Shelley had been living at Lynton during the early days of his ill-fated first marriage with the Harriet; the cottage where they lived can still be seen, though much altered and modernized since the unhappy young man and woman tried to work out together a means of right living and mutual happiness, and made so tragic a failure of it.  It was to Lynton, too, that Wordsworth, his sister Dorothy, and Coleridge, came on a visit, and were so ravished by the beauty of the place that they were nearly decided to settle here, and might have founded a school of Devon poets instead of Lake poets.  It was at Lynton, also, that \"The Ancient Mariner\" was planned, to pay for the expenses of the holiday, and was begun by Wordsworth and Coleridge together, though there is actually very little of Wordsworth's work in it, and the spirit of it, the air of mystery and the sense of brooding elemental forces with which its simplest lines are somehow invested, belongs to Coleridge alone, and to that strange genius of his, which only twice or thrice in his life--in \"Christabel,\" \"The Ancient Mariner,\" and \"Kubla Khan\"--produced poetry of inimitable, strange beauty and wonder.  If Lynton is beautiful now, with its new houses and hotels, and that air of snugness that prosperity gives to places and persons, the poetic appeal of its loveliness to Wordsworth and Coleridge can be well imagined when only the low-browed, thatched little cottages clung to the steep cliff-paths and clustered round the small harbour, and from the surrounding heights and hills one looked down upon nothing but green valleys, and from the valleys one looked up to the bare cliffs and crags.  Southey also was drawn to this corner of England by the fame of its beauty; on one occasion, when walking across Exmoor, he was driven to take refuge at Porlock from the heavy rain, and visitors to the Ship Inn are still shown the corner by the wide old fireplace where the poet, presumably, dried his knees and wrote the ode which begins with the following inadequate description:    \"Porlock, thy verdant vale, so fair to sight,   Thy lofty hills, with fern and furze so brown,   Thy waters that so musical roll down   Thy woody glens, the traveller with delight   Recalls to memory, and the channel grey   Circling it, surging in thy level bay.\"   Then, George Eliot and Lewes discovered this north-west coast, and came to Ilfracombe, with which they were delighted; and the unconventional lady, with her broad-brimmed straw hat tied under her chin (in the days when people wore bonnets), was soon a familiar enough figure, to be seen scrambling over the rocks of the bay which is haunted by the spirit of Tracy, or looking for seaweed and anemones in the clear rock-pools at low-tide.  Ilfracombe then, in the middle of the last century, kept much of its original character as a seaport of importance, which in its day had sent representatives to a shipping council in the fourteenth century, had contributed six ships towards the Siege of Calais--at a time when Liverpool was only of sufficient size to send one--and had had enough strategical value to be the scene of a projected French invasion under Napoleon.  Already Ilfracombe was beginning to be, however, what it now is pre-eminently, a \"holiday resort.\"  It was patronized by royalty, and, following royalty, by \"the aristocracy and military,\" who came to enjoy the \"overwhelming charms\" Nature poured forth here \"with a tremendous and prolific grandeur which we shall not pretend to describe,\" as Mr. Cornish mellifluously exclaims in his \"Rise and Progress of the Towns in North Devon.\"  In the seventies the present German Emperor, then Prince William of Prussia, was sent here with his tutors; and there is a story, preserved with great pride, of a fight on the beach between him and a bathing-machine boy, at whose father's property the Prince was throwing stones.  An account of this historic battle is preserved in a doggerel ballad, printed and sold locally, and composed Heaven knows where, which is called \"Tapping the War-Lord's Claret: Why Kaiser Bill hates England.\"    \"When Kaiser Will'um was a y'uth   He com'd t' Combe one day,   And at the big hotel out there   He stopped on holiday. . . .\"   He went bathing in Rapparee Cove, and when his tutors were out of sight began blazing at the numbers on the boxes, though warned by \"young Alfie Price\" not to; and after a wordy altercation the Kaiser knocked down Alfie, who got up and went for him \"just like a Devon bull.\"    \"He knacked the Kaiser on the nose,   And tapped the ry'al blid. . . .\"   The tutors came up and intervened, and Alf was given thirty shillings to keep the matter quiet; but Kaiser Bill swore implacable hate of the English, because of the affront, built his Dreadnoughts and drilled his army to avenge the insult of Rapparee Cove upon the English nation.  Local publications are always, I think, of some interest, even when they are as rough and simple a doggerel as the above; and there are two magazines, printed and published at Barnstaple in the early years of the nineteenth century, and which may be seen in the Athenaeum Library of the town.  They are the _Lundy Review_ and _The Cave_, and they contain stories, poetry, puns, epigrams, acrostics, all with the mild, faint flavour of a curate's tea-party in a cathedral town, and yet invested with a kind of charm by the old-fashioned type, the yellowing paper, and a small, dim picture--like the images of ourselves and our furniture which we see in those old, round, diminishing mirrors--of the life of a century ago.  There is poetry of the Lake School fashion, exhortations to Bideford and Woody Bay, to Lynton or \"The Beauties of Devon\"; there is more poetry of the Byronic fashion, fierce and satiric invective (yet never, be it understood, transgressing the bounds of decency or good manners!) against the lady of the poet's affection; there are stories, in which love and virtue triumph over temptation and evil-doing; there is, of course, at least one story of a blind girl, and one of a consumptive; there is much harmless punning, and in the acrostics which the ladies of 1820 so much loved are fantastically woven the names of the handsome young women of Barnstaple whose only other record is now upon a tombstone.  There is a strong tone of \"patriotism,\" if by that we mean a dignified contempt for foreign manners and customs, foreign thought and foreign speech.  I call to mind one article, where the writer is good-humouredly but supremely contemptuous of the French, because of their manner of pronouncing classical names.  What can you expect of a nation, says he, for whom Titus Livy is no better than a \"tom-tit-liv-ing\" in a hedge, and Marcus Aurelius, the Emperor philosopher, becomes \"Mark O'Rail,\" a mere beggerly, abusive Irishman?  This insularity of ours, which appears in a comic aspect in this article in _The Cave_, continued throughout the nineteenth century, and withstood the shock of the Crimea and the Indian Mutiny without apparently being in any way shaken; it is breaking now, indeed, under the humiliations of the South African War, when we were made to feel our isolation in Europe, and under the stress of this greatest war of all, when at last we feel and say that we are proud to stand with the nations of the Continent in a common cause.  But, in the nineteenth century, not only was our insular prejudice extreme, but there was a pride in our very prejudice, which made it seem hopelessly fixed and stultified.  There is a trail of it through all but the greatest writings of that time, Tennyson was not without it, Charles Kingsley, Froude. . . .  To the novel it became actually a stock-in-trade, and as such it was used by Henry Kingsley in his novel of \"Ravenshoe.\"  He was a younger brother of Charles, and his life was as restless and adventurous as a novel.  He was, besides being an author, an explorer to the Australian goldfields--from which he came back rich in observation of men and manners, but without having made a pecuniary fortune--the editor of a paper, the _Edinburgh Daily Review_, and a correspondent in the Franco-Prussian War.  He was a prolific and too hasty writer, but his novel of \"Ravenshoe,\" whose scene is principally laid on the northern strip of Somerset coast, bordering the Bristol Channel, and which was his own favourite among his works, is considered by many critics to reach a high level, and to stand comparison with the work of his more famous brother.  In the _Academy_ of 1901 the following tribute to the book appeared under the initials C.K.B.: \"I first read 'Ravenshoe' at that period when absolute romance and absolute fact have to live together; and very turbulent partners they make.  The appeal of the book was instant and permanent.  Even now, after a dozen years I cannot read the story unmoved. . . .  Each point holds me of old, by sheer force of its human presentation, its resourceful dialogue, its unwearied vitality.\"  I first read \"Ravenshoe\" in this year of 1917, and to me the world"]]]
