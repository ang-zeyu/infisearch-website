WHITEFRIARS, about 1605-1614(?).]     TO  LANE COOPER  IN GRATITUDE AND ESTEEM     PREFACE   The method of dramatic representation in the time of Shakespeare has long received close study. Among those who have more recently devoted their energies to the subject may be mentioned W.J. Lawrence, T.S. Graves, G.F. Reynolds, V.E. Albright, A.H. Thorndike, and B. Neuendorff, each of whom has embodied the results of his investigations in one or more noteworthy volumes. But the history of the playhouses themselves, a topic equally important, has not hitherto been attempted. If we omit the brief notices of the theatres in Edmond Malone's _The Plays and Poems of William Shakespeare_ (1790) and John Payne Collier's _The History of English Dramatic Poetry_ (1831), the sole book dealing even in part with the topic is T.F. Ordish's _The Early London Theatres in the Fields_. This book, however, though good for its time, was written a quarter of a century ago, before most of the documents relating to early theatrical history were discovered, and it discusses only six playhouses. The present volume takes advantage of all the materials made available by the industry of later scholars, and records the history of seventeen regular, and five temporary or projected, theatres. The book is throughout the result of a first-hand examination of original sources, and represents an independent interpretation of the historical evidences. As a consequence of this, as well as of a comparison (now for the first time possible) of the detailed records of the several playhouses, many conclusions long held by scholars have been set aside. I have made no systematic attempt to point out the cases in which I depart from previously accepted opinions, for the scholar will discover them for himself; but I believe I have never thus departed without being aware of it, and without having carefully weighed the entire evidence. Sometimes the evidence has been too voluminous or complex for detailed presentation; in these instances I have had to content myself with reference by footnotes to the more significant documents bearing on the point.  In a task involving so many details I cannot hope to have escaped errors--errors due not only to oversight, but also to the limitations of my knowledge or to mistaken interpretation. For such I can offer no excuse, though I may request from my readers the same degree of tolerance which I have tried to show other laborers in the field. In reproducing old documents I have as a rule modernized the spelling and the punctuation, for in a work of this character there seems to be no advantage in preserving the accidents and perversities of early scribes and printers. I have also consistently altered the dates when the Old Style conflicted with our present usage.  I desire especially to record my indebtedness to the researches of Professor C.W. Wallace, the extent of whose services to the study of the Tudor-Stuart drama has not yet been generally realized, and has sometimes been grudgingly acknowledged; and to the labors of Mr. E.K. Chambers and Mr. W.W. Greg, who, in the _Collections_ of The Malone Society, and elsewhere, have rendered accessible a wealth of important material dealing with the early history of the stage.  Finally, I desire to express my gratitude to Mr. Hamilton Bell and the editor of _The Architectural Record_ for permission to reproduce the illustration and description of Inigo Jones's plan of the Cockpit; to the Governors of Dulwich College for permission to reproduce three portraits from the Dulwich Picture Gallery, one of which, that of Joan Alleyn, has not previously been reproduced; to Mr. C.W. Redwood, formerly technical artist at Cornell University, for expert assistance in making the large map of London showing the sites of the playhouses, and for other help generously rendered; and to my colleagues, Professor Lane Cooper and Professor Clark S. Northup, for their kindness in reading the proofs.  JOSEPH QUINCY ADAMS  ITHACA, NEW YORK     CONTENTS       I. THE INN-YARDS                                                 1     II.

These yards, especially those of carriers' inns, were admirably suited to dramatic representations, consisting as they did of a large open court surrounded by two or more galleries. Many examples of such inn-yards are still to be seen in various parts of England; a picture of the famous White Hart, in Southwark, is given opposite page 4 by way of illustration. In the yard a temporary platform--a few boards, it may be, set on barrel-heads[1]--could be erected for a stage; in the adjacent stables a dressing-room could be provided for the actors; the rabble--always the larger and more enthusiastic part of the audience--could be accommodated with standing-room about the stage; while the more aristocratic members of the audience could be comfortably seated in the galleries overhead. Thus a ready-made and very serviceable theatre was always at the command of the players; and it seems to have been frequently made use of from the very beginning of professionalism in acting.  [Footnote 1: \"Thou shalt not need to travel with thy pumps full of gravel any more, after a blind jade and a hamper, and stalk upon boards and barrel-heads.\" (_Poetaster_, III, i.)]  One of the earliest extant moralities, _Mankind_, acted by strollers in the latter half of the fifteenth century, gives us an interesting glimpse of an inn-yard performance. The opening speech makes distinct reference to the two classes of the audience described above as occupying the galleries and the yard:       O ye sovereigns that sit, and ye brothers that stand right      up.  The \"brothers,\" indeed, seem to have stood up so closely about the stage that the actors had great difficulty in passing to and from their dressing-room. Thus, Nowadays leaves the stage with the request:       Make space, sirs, let me go out!  New Gyse enters with the threat:       Out of my way, sirs, for dread of a beating!  While Nought, with even less respect, shouts:       Avaunt, knaves! Let me go by!  Language such as this would hardly be appropriate if addressed to the \"sovereigns\" who sat in the galleries above; but, as addressed to the \"brothers,\" it probably served to create a general feeling of good nature. And a feeling of good nature was desirable, for the actors were facing the difficult problem of inducing the audience to pay for its entertainment.  This problem they met by taking advantage of the most thrilling moment of the plot. The Vice and his wicked though jolly companions, having wholly failed to overcome the hero, Mankind, decide to call to their assistance no less a person than the great Devil himself; and accordingly they summon him with a \"Walsingham wystyle.\" Immediately he roars in the dressing-room, and shouts:       I come, with my legs under me!  There is a flash of powder, and an explosion of fireworks, while the eager spectators crane their necks to view the entrance of this \"abhomynabull\" personage. But nothing appears; and in the expectant silence that follows the actors calmly announce a collection of money, facetiously making the appearance of the Devil dependent on the liberality of the audience:       _New Gyse._ Now ghostly to our purpose, worshipful sovereigns,      We intend to gather money, if it please your negligence.      For a man with a head that of great omnipotence--       _Nowadays_ [_interrupting_]. Keep your tale, in goodness, I      pray you, good brother!       [_Addressing the audience, and pointing towards the      dressing-room, where the Devil roars again._]       He is a worshipful man, sirs, saving your reverence.      He loveth no groats, nor pence, or two-pence;      Give us red royals, if ye will see his abominable presence.       _New Gyse._ Not so! Ye that may not pay the one, pay the other.  And with such phrases as \"God bless you, master,\" \"Ye will not say nay,\" \"Let us go by,\" \"Do them all pay,\" \"Well mote ye fare,\" they pass through the audience gathering their groats, pence, and twopence; after which they remount the stage, fetch in the Devil, and continue their play without further interruption.  [Illustration: AN INN-YARD  The famous White Hart, in Southwark. The ground-plan shows the arrangement of a carriers' inn with the stabling below; the guest rooms were on the upper floors.]  In the smaller towns the itinerant players might, through a letter of recommendation from their noble patron, or through the good-will of some local dignitary, secure the use of the town-hall, of the schoolhouse, or even of the village church. In such buildings, of course, they could give their performances more advantageously, for they could place money-takers at the doors, and exact adequate payment from all who entered. In the great city of London, however, the players were necessarily forced to make use almost entirely of public inn-yards--an arrangement which, we may well believe, they found far from satisfactory. Not being masters of the inns, they were merely tolerated; they had to content themselves with hastily provided and inadequate stage facilities; and, worst of all, for their recompense they had to trust to a hat collection, at best a poor means of securing money. Often too, no doubt, they could not get the use of a given inn-yard when they most needed it, as on holidays and festive occasions; and at all times they had to leave the public in uncertainty as to where or when plays were to be seen. Their street parade, with the noise of trumpets and drums, might gather a motley crowd for the yard, but in so large a place as London it was inadequate for advertisement among the better classes. And as the troupes of the city increased in wealth and dignity, and as the playgoing public grew in size and importance, the old makeshift arrangement became more and more unsatisfactory.  At last the unsatisfactory situation was relieved by the specific dedication of certain large inns to dramatic purposes; that is, the proprietors of certain inns found it to their advantage to subordinate their ordinary business to the urgent demands of the actors and the playgoing public. Accordingly they erected in their yards permanent stages adequately equipped for dramatic representations, constructed in their galleries wooden benches to accommodate as many spectators as possible, and were ready to let the use of their buildings to the actors on an agreement by which the proprietor shared with the troupe in the \"takings\" at the door. Thus there came into existence a number of inn-playhouses, where the actors, as masters of the place, could make themselves quite at home, and where the public without special notification could be sure of always finding dramatic entertainment.  Richard Flecknoe, in his _Discourse of the English Stage_ (1664), goes so far as to dignify these reconstructed inns with the name \"theatres.\" At first, says he, the players acted \"without any certain theatres or set companions, till about the beginning of Queen Elizabeth's reign they began here to assemble into companies, and set up theatres, first in the city (as in the inn-yards of the Cross Keys and Bull in Grace and Bishop's Gate Street at this day to be seen), till that fanatic spirit [i.e., Puritanism], which then began with the stage and after ended with the throne, banished them thence into the suburbs\"--that is, into Shoreditch and the Bankside, where, outside the jurisdiction of the puritanical city fathers, they erected their first regular playhouses.  The \"banishment\" referred to by Flecknoe was the Order of the Common Council issued on December 6, 1574. This famous document described public acting as then taking place \"in great inns, having chambers and secret places adjoining to their open stages and galleries\"; and it ordered that henceforth \"no inn-keeper, tavern-keeper, nor other person whatsoever within the liberties of this city shall openly show, or play, nor cause or suffer to be openly showed or played within the house yard or any other place within the liberties of this city, any play,\" etc.  How many inns were let on special occasions for dramatic purposes we cannot say; but there were five \"great inns,\" more famous than the rest, which were regularly used by the best London troupes. Thus Howes, in his continuation of Stow's _Annals_ (p. 1004), in attempting to give a list of the playhouses which had been erected \"within London and the suburbs,\" begins with the statement, \"Five inns, or common osteryes, turned to playhouses.\" These five were the Bell and the Cross Keys, hard by each other in Gracechurch Street, the Bull, in Bishopsgate Street, the Bell Savage, on Ludgate Hill, and the Boar's "]]]
