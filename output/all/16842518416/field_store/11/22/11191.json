Public opinion, indeed, was showing itself in many curious ways. \"The town here is employed,\" writes the Lord Chancellor, \"in nothing but speculation whether her Majesty will or will not come. Great bets are laid about it. Some people have taken fifty guineas, undertaking in lieu of them to pay a guinea a-day till she comes, so sure are these that she will come within fifty days; others, again, are taking less than fifty guineas, undertaking to pay a guinea a-day till she comes, so sure are they that she will not come; others assert that they know she will come, and that she will find her way into Westminster Abbey and Westminster Hall on the Coronation, in spite of all opposition. I retain my old opinion that she will not come, _unless she is insane_.\"[13]        [13] Twiss's \"Life of Eldon,\" vol. ii. p. 5.  A change of Ministry, Lord Dudley[14] assures us, was talked about more than usual; but, as the Opposition were obliged to confess that they would find great difficulty in establishing a Government, the existing Administration held a tolerably secure tenancy.        [14] \"Letters,\" p. 251. Alison states that attempts were made       to form a new Ministry, with Lord Wellesley at the head--\"History       of Europe,\" vol. ii. p. 457. This, however, as has been shown       (_ante_ p. 9), is incorrect.  An Order in Council was issued for omitting the Queen's name from the Church Service, and other signs appeared, indicating a desire to withhold from her her queenly title. This made a temper, never remarkably tractable, not to be controlled by the dictates of prudence; the old spirit manifested itself in its most spirited form; and she lost no time in letting the world know that she was returning to England to obtain justice for her wrongs. Those who thought they knew her best, considered that vindictive feelings influenced her resolution, and that, with a full knowledge of the inflammable state of public opinion in the British Empire, she had determined on some great work of mischief against the peace of the kingdom and the security of its ruler.  At this period there were many elements of discord in the social community that were acting upon a large and dangerous portion of it, to the prejudice of the Government.[15] Besides the Thistlewood gang, justice was about to dispose of Mr. Orator Hunt and his myrmidons, then awaiting their trial. Sir Charles Wolseley, a baronet, and Joseph Harrison, a preacher, were under prosecution for uttering seditious speeches.[16] Sir Francis Burdett--a more popular tribune--was also at variance with the laws for a scandalous attack on Ministers; in short, every day seemed to bring to light some source of mischief which could not fail to add to the uneasiness of the responsible servants of the Crown. A general election stirred up other noxious ingredients, and during the spring of the year everything seemed to betoken a coming convulsion. At this time the following communication was written:--        [15] Lord Sidmouth's intelligence led him to expect daily a       revolutionary movement.--\"Life,\" by Dean Pellew, vol. iii.       p. 325.        [16] The minister of religion exceeded the democratic baronet       in the violence of his denunciations of the ruling powers,       a fair example of which may be found in the following       _morceau_:--\"Kings, princes, dukes, lords, commons, parliaments,       archbishops, bishops, prelates, rectors, high-constables,       constables, sheriffs, deputy-constables and bailiffs, are all       corrupt, and the time is near at hand when they will be upset.       The people should rise _en masse_ to suppress such a tyrannical       Government as the one of this country, and it will not be long,       but very soon, that it shall be overturned, and many a bloody       battle may be fought, and many a one incarcerated in prison,       before it shall be accomplished.\"       LORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.      March 29, 1820.      Hunt's conviction is beyond my hope, though it would certainly have     been no easy matter for any jury to acquit him, even under the     charge such as it is. His motion for a new trial is, I imagine,     nothing more than the sort of last resource at which defeated men,     whether at elections or trials, always love to catch. It would have     been a dreadful thing indeed if it had been established by the     result of that trial that the Manchester meeting was, under all its     circumstances, a legal assembly.   Alarming as might be considered the aspect of domestic affairs, the Government, so far from betraying apprehension, carried on the business of the country with untiring vigilance and decision. Hunt and five of his associates, after a long trial, were on the 23rd of March, at York, found guilty of unlawfully assembling and inciting to hatred of the Government. On the same day, Sir Francis Burdett was found guilty of uttering a seditious libel. On the 10th of April, Sir Charles Wolseley and Mr. Joseph Harrison were also found guilty of sedition. The most guilty of the Cato Street heroes made their last public appearance at the Old Bailey on the 1st of May; the remainder were expatriated to New South Wales. Thus the supremacy of the law was vindicated; but there still existed in the more populous districts feelings inimical to the authorities, that might be restrained by coercive demonstrations, but which only waited a favourable season for bursting through all control: and as, on the 20th of April, Mr. Denman and Mr. Brougham had been acknowledged by the Lord Chancellor, from his seat in the Court of Chancery, the Queen's Solicitor and Attorney-General, the discontented took heart, and saw in this admission of the Queen's position, a prognostication of the struggle that was to create for them the opportunity for which they were waiting.  The Court of the Monarch did not appear more apprehensive than his Ministers. A day was fixed for the Coronation; and among those who would have to assist in the ceremonial, no one ventured to hint on the possibility of the Queen having any position in it. On the 3rd of May, the King received addresses at Carlton House; and on the 10th, his Majesty held his first Levee since his accession to the throne, at which nearly 1800 persons of distinction were present, who testified their attachment to his person in a manner that must have left him little to desire. It was known that his consort intended to agitate the empire from end to end, and her arrival was looked for in a few weeks; but the families of the great political party that formed and supported the Government, betrayed no uneasiness--indeed, the most influential regarded, or affected to regard, the coming struggle with a quiet disdain, that evinced their confidence in the loyalty and good sense of the nation. \"His Majesty's Opposition,\" however, talked and looked very differently;--the Democratic party were vehement in their denunciations of the Queen's wrongs, and the leading Whigs began to come forward prominently as champions of her rights. This is about the date of the following communications:--       RIGHT HON. THOS. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.      Cleveland Square, May 4, 1820.      MY DEAR LORD B----,      I have but little news to tell you. The general arrangement of the     Civil List, by replacing it as it stood in 1816, is so much better     a bargain for the public than I had expected, that I for one am     well contented with it; and if report be true, it was obtained by     nothing but the most determined refusal of the Ministers to do     more. Still, however, I understand that the Admiralty Droits are     unpopular enough to threaten the Government with a good deal of     embarrassment; for undoubtedly, if they have bargained with the     King for the statement of 1816, when he had the Admiralty Droits,     they cannot in equity deprive him of that part of his bargain.     Brougham seems by his speech to have conceived the notion of giving     the King _compensation_ for them; but it seems to me to be but     a bad bargain for the public, to make them, under the present     pressure, purchase out a remote contingent future revenue, which     can arise only out of a war that no Power in Europe is rich enough     to make, any more than ourselves.      Nobody knows what Brougham's motion will be to-morrow, or what     course the Opposition will take on Monday. I hope none of our     friends will disturb an arrangement which I believe the Government     had some merit and great difficulty in reducing to its present     form.      The Coronation, which Lord G. Seymour told me ten days ago was     suspended, is now again in expectation, according to general     belief; it has revived in common report, because I fancy the Earl     Marshal has just been ordered to have an estimate made of the     necessary expenses attending it in his department; but it does not     follow from that estimate that the ceremony will take place, I     think it more probable that it will be put off, because the King     will not like it unless it be expensive, and Van knows not how to     pay for it if it is. Clive told me yesterday, that three naval     peers are about to be made--Sir W. Young, Warren, and Saumarez.     This looks as if an Accession List was preparing; but I have heard     of no others. It seems now understood that the whole Militia will     be called out. Manchester, as Lady Grosvenor tells me, is quieter;     as Harriet writes, is as bad as ever. Scotland is still only quiet     from the military force there, but the temper is said to be as bad     as ever.       MR. W. H. FREMANTLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.      Stanhope Street, May 8, 1820.      MY DEAR LORD,      We had a heavy debate last night,--Tierney very able, and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22553"],["title","Memoirs of the Court of George IV. 1820-1830 (Vol 1) (#3)"],["body","good,--but an evident indisposition of the House to the subject;     and the division on the part of Government very bad--only 99     majority. They cannot get attendance, and the report of dissension     on the part of the King and his Ministers is no doubt the cause of     this; notwithstanding, however, I am quite sure there can be no     change, and a very short time must commit the Opposition with the     King on the subject of the Queen. Tierney last night touched upon     it, and complained that she was not recognised by the Bill or Civil     List, and yet acknowledged by the Lord Chancellor of England. You     will see hardly any addition of names to the Opposition, or any     increased numbers, but the _feature_ is the want of attendance     of the Government friends. Everybody believes the report of Denison     having stated to his nephew his determination to disinherit him if     he accepts the new situation. We must see the result of this in a     very short time, should it be the case.--The ladies are not to walk     at the Coronation, and it is to be on the cheapest scale. No     dinner. The estimate is called 150,000_l._ All your members     were present yesterday, and if we had voted against the Government,     only see how we would have diminished their numbers.--Mr. Chard is     in a peck of troubles. He has not got the address, without which it     is useless to go to the Levee.--I was glad of Brougham's mention of     Lady Grenville's pension (it certainly was not an attack), because     it produced an authorized declaration of its surrender, which was     received with great applause.      You have no conception with what attention Baring was heard in a     full house last night, when for an hour or so he described the     commercial state of England in the most lamentable terms. It had     great effect--The King never shows himself. He has never been out     of Carlton House.--Lady C----[17] goes to him of an evening, and he     has had his usual dinners of Sir Carnaby Haggerston, Forester, and     two or three of this description. His language is only about the     Coronation and Lady C----: very little of the state of the country.      I will keep this open, in case anything occurs.      Ever, &c.,      W. H. F.      P.S.--I have just seen Chard, who is in despair about the address;     but he has determined, by my advice, to defer his presentation to     Wednesday se'nnight, in case we hear nothing of the address     to-morrow morning.        [17] Lady Conyngham.       RIGHT HON. THOS. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.      Cleveland Square, May 9, 1820.      MY DEAR LORD B----,      The Opposition, you see, continues to muster in their original     force of 160 upon their great questions, and though they do not     increase, it seems to me that there is either an indifference or a     disinclination in many to give any active support to Government;     for while the Ministers produce only their ordinary numbers, their     antagonists always are able to command their full force,--and if     that disproportion continues, it will not do, particularly under     the alarmed, and restless, and fearful circumstances of the     country. You see, by the loud cheering of Baring, how strongly the     impression prevails in the House that the present evils demand     great and vigorous remedies; and though, perhaps, I may be less     sanguine in the application of these theories, I see plainly that     the House and country are so alarmed as to call for great talents     and great vigour in their Ministers--much greater than they are     likely to find--for the only new feature of yesterday's debate on     the part of the Administration was to show that, upon a commercial     question, the head of the Board of Trade is in opinion with Baring,     while that of his colleagues is against him. This is a wretched     beginning on a topic of such overruling importance.--The Coronation     stands for the 1st August I hear of no more new peers yet. I think     the less you hear of the _man_ the better: you should only have to     do with the _master_. Lord Arundel told me yesterday that they do     not go yet, if at all. Sir Francis[18] at Lillies is really the _ne     plus ultra_!!!        [18] Sir Francis Burdett.       RIGHT HON. THOS. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.      Cleveland Square, May 11, 1820.      MY DEAR LORD B----,      I met my brother this morning, to take our new oaths at the Council     Office, and showed him your letter. I was glad to see in it that     you are gradually getting strength, and was surprised to see that     the two old uncles had both written to you at the same time, on the     same subject, without any previous communication had between us.      Lord Harrowby told my brother that it was the intention in every     respect to follow the same ceremonial at this Coronation that took     place at the last, and this should be good authority; but, on the     other hand, so general a rumour and expectation prevails of the     banquet being curtailed, that one scarce knows what to believe. But     my own, opinion is, that Lord H. is correct, and that it will be     neither more nor less than the last. Public conversation supposes     four Dukes--viz., my neighbour, yourself, Lord Hastings, and Lord     Winchester. The only Commoner, I hear, is Sir ---- Liddell, who, I     am well assured, says that it is promised to him. The other names,     I presume, grow out of public talk only; at least, my neighbours     told me they had heard nothing of it two or three days ago.   To give the reader an idea of the state of our public streets in the metropolis at this period from turbulent mobs, we quote the following anecdote:--\"A very large family party happened to be assembled in the house, and the garrison being thus strong, it sallied forth, headed by Lord Exmouth, and attacked the assailants, who, disconcerted possibly by this unusual system of tactics, instantly dispersed. One prisoner was taken--a juvenile printer--who, by his insolence, which was consummate, obtained for himself the glory of a night's imprisonment instead of a lecture.\" The third attack occurred on a Wednesday ensuing, while Lord Sidmouth was attending the Cabinet dinner. It was feeble, and of brief duration; and as no further annoyance was anticipated by the police officers, the narrator, who had been left in charge, retired to his lodgings in the same street. Shortly afterwards he heard the mob returning, and hastened back to his Lordship's door, against which the watchman had placed himself. Before, however, they could gain admittance, the Philistines were upon them, filling the whole doorway, and hemming them up in the entrance. At this moment a carriage dashed rapidly down the street, drew up at the door, and Lord Sidmouth exclaimed from within it, \"Let me out--I must get out!\" But another and a commanding voice replied, \"You shall not alight--drive on!\" and instantly the carriage bounded forward and disappeared, but not before the glass of the window nearest the speaker had been shivered to atoms by a stick or stone. In a moment afterwards, at a signal given, the mob dispersed, leaving the watchman and his companion the only occupants of the street. In a few minutes the same carriage returned, escorted by a small party of the Life Guards. It was that of the Duke of Wellington, and contained his Grace, Lord Eldon, and Lord Sidmouth.[19]        [19] Pellew's \"Life of Lord Sidmouth,\" vol. iii. p. 328.  The next communication, from a member of the Royal Family, refers to a much-valued distinction which was conferred on his Royal Highness's correspondent. It shows also the kind feelings which this amiable Prince entertained for him:--       THE DUKE OF GLOUCESTER TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.      Gloucester House, Sunday Evening, May 28.      MY DEAR LORD,      I hasten to return your Lordship my best thanks for your friendly     attention in immediately notifying to me an event that, I trust,     you are well assured must afford me the truest gratification. To     the Garter you are so justly entitled that I have real satisfaction     in seeing you receive that Order; but it is particularly gratifying     to me to know that it comes _direct_ to you from the King, and that     this distinction is conferred upon you unsolicited, the spontaneous     act of his Majesty. Of my sentiments towards yourself I hope you     are so well convinced that I need not add that I shall attend the     Chapter to-morrow with the sincerest pleasure.      In offering to you my warmest congratulations, I am happy to renew     to you an assurance of the very great regard and high esteem with     which      I am always, my dear Lord,      Very sincerely yours,      WILLIAM FREDERICK.   The following refers to the same subject, and is equally creditable to the writer:--       THE MARQUIS WELLESLEY TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.      Richmond, Monday, May 29, 1820.      MY DEAR LORD,      I went to Carlton House to-day to attend a Chapter of the Garter,     at which I understood that I should have had the satisfaction of     seeing the King invest your Lordship with his own Garter, vacated     by his accession to the Crown.      Upon my arrival, I found that the Chapter had been postponed; and     as the King goes to Windsor this evening for the Ascot races, I     suppose some days will elapse before the Chapter can take place. I     was informed, however, from good authority, that the King will     offer the Garter to your Lordship.      Sincerely hoping that you will not decline the offer, I shall be     anxious to attend on the day of your investiture; and I should be     much obliged to you if you would apprise me of it as soon as you     know it. I shall, of course, receive the usual summons; but I     should grieve to be out of the way when it might reach this place.      Always, my dear Lord,      Yours"]]]
