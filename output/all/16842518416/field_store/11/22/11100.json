Whatever else we indulge ourselves in, is attended with some small degree of relish, and has some trifling satisfaction in the enjoyment, but, in this, the farther we go, the more we are lost; and when arrived at the mark proposed, we are as far from the object we pursue, as when we first set out. Here then, are we inexcusable, in not attending to the secret dictates of reason, and in stopping our ears at the timely admonitions of friendship. Headstrong and ungovernable, we pursue our course without intermission; thoughtless and unwary, we see not the dangers that lie immediately before us; but hurry on, even without sight of our object, till we bury ourselves in that gulf of woe, where perishes at once, health, wealth and virtue, and whose dreadful labyrinths admit of no return.  Struck with the foresight of that misery, attendant on a life of debauchery, which is, in fact, the offspring of prodigality, our author has, in the scenes before us, attempted the reformation of the worldling, by stopping him as it were in his career, and opening to his view the many sad calamities awaiting the prosecution of his proposed scheme of life; he has, in hopes of reforming the prodigal, and at the same time deterring the rising generation, whom Providence may have blessed with earthly wealth, from entering into so iniquitous a course, exhibited the life of a young man, hurried on through a succession of profligate pursuits, for the few years Nature was able to support itself; and this from the instant he might be said to enter into the world, till the time of his leaving it. But, as the vice of avarice is equal to that of prodigality, and the ruin of children is often owing to the indiscretion of their parents, he has opened the piece with a scene, which, at the same time that it exposes the folly of the youth, shews us the imprudence of the father, who is supposed to have hurt the principles of his son, in depriving him of the necessary use of some portion of that gold, he had with penurious covetousness been hoarding up, for the sole purpose of lodging in his coffers.     PLATE I.  THE YOUNG HEIR TAKING POSSESSION.      Oh, vanity of age untoward!     Ever spleeny, ever froward!     Why these bolts and massy chains,     Squint suspicions, jealous pains?     Why, thy toilsome journey o'er,     Lay'st thou up an useless store?     _Hope_, along with _Time_ is flown;     Nor canst thou reap the field thou'st sown.     Hast thou a son? In time be wise;     He views thy toil with other eyes.     Needs must thy kind paternal care,     Lock'd in thy chests, be buried there?     Whence, then, shall flow that friendly ease,     That social converse, heartfelt peace,     Familiar duty without dread,     Instruction from example bred,     Which youthful minds with freedom mend,     And with the _father_ mix the _friend_?     Uncircumscribed by prudent rules,     Or precepts of expensive schools;     Abused at home, abroad despised,     Unbred, unletter'd, unadvised;     The headstrong course of life begun,     What comfort from thy darling son?      HOADLEY.   The history opens, representing a scene crowded with all the monuments of avarice, and laying before us a most beautiful contrast, such as is too general in the world, to pass unobserved; nothing being more common than for a son to prodigally squander away that substance his father had, with anxious solicitude, his whole life been amassing.--Here, we see the young heir, at the age of nineteen or twenty, raw from the University, just arrived at home, upon the death of his father. Eager to know the possessions he is master of, the old wardrobes, where things have been rotting time out of mind, are instantly wrenched open; the strong chests are unlocked; the parchments, those securities of treble interest, on which this avaricious monster lent his money, tumbled out; and the bags of gold, which had long been hoarded, with griping care, now exposed to the pilfering hands of those about him. To explain every little mark of usury and covetousness, such as the mortgages, bonds, indentures, &c. the piece of candle stuck on a save-all, on the mantle-piece; the rotten furniture of the room, and the miserable contents of the dusty wardrobe, would be unnecessary: we shall only notice the more striking articles. From the vast quantity of papers, falls an old written journal, where, among other memorandums, we find the following, viz. \"May the 5th, 1721. Put off my bad shilling.\" Hence, we learn, the store this penurious miser set on this trifle: that so penurious is the disposition of the miser, that notwithstanding he may be possessed of many large bags of gold, the fear of losing a single shilling is a continual trouble to him. In one part of the room, a man is hanging it with black cloth, on which are placed escutcheons, by way of dreary ornament; these escutcheons contain the arms of the covetous, _viz._ three vices, hard screwed, with the motto, \"BEWARE!\" On the floor, lie a pair of old shoes, which this sordid wretch is supposed to have long preserved for the weight of iron in the nails, and has been soling with leather cut from the covers of an old Family Bible; an excellent piece of satire, intimating, that such men would sacrifice even their God to the lust of money. From these and some other objects too striking to pass unnoticed, such as the gold falling from the breaking cornice; the jack and spit, those utensils of original hospitality, locked up, through fear of being used; the clean and empty chimney, in which a fire is just now going to be made for the first time; and the emaciated figure of the cat, strongly mark the natural temper of the late miserly inhabitant, who could starve in the midst of plenty.--But see the mighty change! View the hero of our piece, left to himself, upon the death of his father, possessed of a goodly inheritance. Mark how his mind is affected!--determined to partake of the mighty happiness he falsely imagines others of his age and fortune enjoy; see him running headlong into extravagance, withholding not his heart from any joy; but implicitly pursuing the dictates of his will. To commence this delusive swing of pleasure, his first application is to the tailor, whom we see here taking his measure, in order to trick out his pretty person. In the interim, enters a poor girl (with her mother), whom our hero has seduced, under professions of love and promises of marriage; in hopes of meeting with that kind welcome she had the greatest reason to expect; but he, corrupted with the wealth of which he is now the master, forgets every engagement he once made, finds himself too rich to keep his word; and, as if gold would atone for a breach of honour, is offering money to her mother, as an equivalent for the non-fulfilling of his promise. Not the sight of the ring, given as a pledge of his fidelity; not a view of the many affectionate letters he at one time wrote to her, of which her mother's lap is full; not the tears, nor even the pregnant condition of the wretched girl, could awaken in him one spark of tenderness; but, hard hearted and unfeeling, like the generality of wicked men, he suffers her to weep away her woes in silent sorrow, and curse with bitterness her deceitful betrayer. One thing more we shall take notice of, which is, that this unexpected visit, attended with abuse from the mother, so engages the attention of our youth, as to give the old pettifogger behind him an opportunity of robbing him. Hence we see that one ill consequence is generally attended with another; and that misfortunes, according to the old proverb, seldom come alone.      Mr. Ireland remarks of this plate--\"He here presents to us the     picture of a young man, thoughtless, extravagant, and licentious;     and, in colours equally impressive, paints the destructive     consequences of his conduct. The first print most forcibly contrasts     two opposite passions; the unthinking negligence of _youth_, and the     sordid avaricious rapacity of age. It brings into one point of view     what Mr. Pope so exquisitely describes in his Epistle to Lord     Bathurst--          'Who sees pale _Mammon_ pine amidst his store,         Sees but a backward steward for the poor;         This year a reservoir, to keep and spare;         The next a fountain, spouting through his heir.'      The introduction to this history is well delineated, and the     principal figure marked with that easy, unmeaning vacancy of face,     which speaks him formed by nature for a DUPE. Ignorant of the value     of money, and negligent in his nature, he leaves his bag of untold     gold in the reach of an old and greedy pettifogging attorney, who is     making an inventory of bonds, mortgages, indentures, &c. This man,     with the rapacity so natural to those who disgrace the profession,     seizes the first opportunity of plundering his employer. Hogarth     had, a few years before, been engaged in a law suit, which gave him     some experience of the PRACTICE of those pests of society.\"  [Illustration: THE RAKE'S PROGRESS.  PLATE 1.

HOADLEY.   We are next to consider our hero as launched into the world, and having equipped himself with all the necessaries to constitute him a man of taste, he plunges at once into all the fashionable excesses, and enters with spirit into the character he assumes.  The avarice of the penurious father then, in this print, is contrasted by the giddy profusion of his prodigal son. We view him now at his levee, attended by masters of various professions, supposed to be here offering their interested services. The foremost figure is readily known to be a dancing-master; behind him are two men, who at the time when these prints were first published, were noted for teaching the arts of defence by different weapons, and who are here drawn from the life; one of whom is a Frenchman, teacher of the small-sword, making a thrust with his foil; the other an Englishman, master of the quarter-staff; the vivacity of the first, and the cold contempt visible in the face of the second, beautifully describe the natural disposition of the two nations. On the left of the latter stands an improver of gardens, drawn also from the life, offering a plan for that purpose. A taste for gardening, carried to excess, must be acknowledged to have been the ruin of numbers, it being a passion that is seldom, if ever, satisfied, and attended with the greatest expense. In the chair sits a professor of music, at the harpsichord, running over the keys, waiting to give his pupil a lesson; behind whose chair hangs a list of the presents, one Farinelli, an Italian singer, received the next day after his first performance at the Opera House; amongst which, there is notice taken of one, which he received from the hero of our piece, thus: \"A gold snuff-box, chased, with the story of Orpheus charming the brutes, by J. Rakewell, esq.\" By these mementos of extravagance and pride, (for gifts of this kind proceed oftener from ostentation than generosity,) and by the engraved frontispiece to a poem, dedicated to our fashionable spendthrift, lying on the floor, which represents the ladies of Britain sacrificing their hearts to the idol Farinelli, crying out, with the greatest earnestness, \"one G--d, one Farinelli,\" we are given to understand the prevailing dissipation and luxury of the times. Near the principal figure in this plate is that of him, with one hand on his breast, the other on his sword, whom we may easily discover to be a bravo; he is represented as having brought a letter of recommendation, as one disposed to undertake all sorts of service. This character is rather Italian than English; but is here introduced to fill up the list of persons at that time too often engaged in the service of the votaries of extravagance and fashion. Our author would have it imagined in the interval between the first scene and this, that the young man whose history he is painting, had now given himself up to every fashionable extravagance; and among others, he had imbibed a taste for cock-fighting and horse-racing; two amusements, which, at that time, the man of fashion could not dispense with. This is evident, from his rider bringing in a silver punch-bowl, which one of his horses is supposed to have won, and his saloon being ridiculously ornamented with the portraits of celebrated cocks. The figures in the back part of this plate represent tailors, peruke-makers, milliners, and such other persons as generally fill the antichamber of a man of quality, except one, who is supposed to be a poet, and has written some panegyric on the person whose levee he attends, and who waits for that approbation he already vainly anticipates. Upon the whole, the general tenor of this scene is to teach us, that the man of fashion is too often exposed to the rapacity of his fellow creatures, and is commonly a dupe to the more knowing part of the world.      \"How exactly,\" says Mr. Ireland, \"does Bramston describe the     character in his _Man of Taste_:--          'Without Italian, and without an ear,         To Bononcini's music I adhere.----         To boon companions I my time would give,         With players, pimps, and parasites I'd live;         I would with jockeys from Newmarket dine,         And to rough riders give my choicest wine.         My evenings all I would with sharpers spend,         And make the thief-taker my bosom friend;         In Figg, the prize-fighter, by day delight,         And sup with Colley Cibber every night.'      \"Of the expression in this print, we cannot speak more highly than     it deserves. Every character is marked with its proper and     discriminative stamp. It has been said by a very judicious critic     (the Rev. Mr. Gilpin) from whom it is not easy to differ without     being wrong, that the hero of this history, in the first plate of     the series, is _unmeaning_, and in the second _ungraceful_. The fact     is admitted; but, for so delineating him, the author is entitled to     our praise, rather than our censure. Rakewell's whole conduct proves     he was a fool, and at that time he had not learned how to perform an     artificial character; he therefore looks as he is, unmeaning, and     uninformed. But in the second plate he is _ungraceful_.--Granted.     The ill-educated son of so avaricious a father could not have been     introduced into very good company; and though, by the different     teachers who surround him, it evidently appears that he wishes to     _assume_ the character of a gentleman, his internal feelings tell     him he has not attained it. Under that consciousness, he is properly     and naturally represented as ungraceful, and embarrassed in his new     situation.\"  [Illustration: THE RAKE'S PROGRESS.  PLATE 2.  SURROUNDED BY ARTISTS & PROFESSORS.]     PLATE III.  THE TAVERN SCENE.      \"O vanity of youthful blood,     So by misuse to poison good!     Woman, framed for social love,     Fairest gift of powers above,     Source of every household blessing;     All charms in innocence possessing:     But, turn'd to vice, all plagues above;     Foe to thy being, foe to love!     Guest divine, to outward viewing;     Ablest minister of ruin?     And thou, no less of gift divine,     Sweet poison of misused wine!     With freedom led to every part,     And secret chamber of the heart,     Dost thou thy friendly host betray,     And shew thy riotous gang the way     To enter in, with covert treason,     O'erthrow the drowsy guard of reason,     To ransack the abandon'd place,     And revel there with wild excess?\"   Mr. Ireland having, in his description of this Plate, incorporated whatever is of value in Dr. Trusler's text, with much judicious observation and criticism of his own, the Editor has taken the former _verbatim_.  \"This Plate exhibits our licentious prodigal engaged in one of his midnight festivities: forgetful of the past, and negligent of the future, he riots in the present. Having poured his libation to Bacchus, he concludes the evening orgies in a sacrifice at the Cyprian shrine; and, surrounded by the votaries of Venus, joins in the unhallowed mysteries of the place. The companions of his revelry are marked with that easy, unblushing effrontery, which belongs to the servants of all work in the isle of Paphos;--for the maids of honour they are not sufficiently elevated.  \"He may be supposed, in the phrase of the day, to have beat the rounds, overset a constable, and conquered a watchman, whose staff and lantern he has brought into the room, as trophies of his prowess. In this situation he is robbed of his watch by the girl whose hand is in his bosom; and, with that adroitness peculiar to an old practitioner, she conveys her acquisition to an accomplice, who stands behind the chair.  \"Two of the ladies are quarrelling; and one of them _delicately_ spouts wine in the face of her opponent, who is preparing to revenge the affront with a knife, which, in a posture of threatening defiance, she grasps in her hand. A third, enraged at being neglected, holds a lighted candle to a map of the globe, determined to _set the world on fire, though she perish in the conflagration_! A fourth is undressing. The fellow bringing in a pewter dish, as part of the apparatus of this elegant and Attic entertainment, a blind harper, a trumpeter, and a ragged ballad-singer, roaring out an obscene song, complete this motley group.  \"This design may be a very exact representation of what were then the nocturnal amusements of a brothel;--so different are the manners of former and present times, that I much question whether a similar exhibition is now to be seen in any tavern of the metropolis. That we are less licentious than our predecessors, I dare not affirm; but we are certainly more delicate in the pursuit of our pleasures.  \"The room is furnished with a set of Roman emperors,--they are not placed in their proper order; for in the mad revelry of the evening, this family of frenzy have decollated all of them, except Nero; and his manners had too great a similarity to their own, to admit of his suffering so degrading an insult; their reverence for _virtue_ induced them to spare his head. In the frame of a _Cæsar_ they have placed a portrait of _Pontac_, an eminent cook, whose great talents being turned to heightening sensual, rather than mental enjoyments, he has a much better chance of a votive offering from this company, than would either Vespasian or Trajan.  \"The shattered mirror, broken wine-glasses, fractured chair and cane; the mangled fowl, with a fork stuck in its breast, thrown into a corner, and indeed every accompaniment, shews, that this has been a night of riot without enjoyment, mischief without wit, and waste without gratification.  \"With respect to the"]]]
