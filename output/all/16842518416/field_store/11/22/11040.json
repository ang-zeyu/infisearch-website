From that time every rabbit has had a split lip. The rabbit was afraid of the moon, and he was afraid of the people on the earth. He had been brave before, but now he is the most timid of animals, for he is afraid of everything and everybody.     WHY THE PEETWEET CRIES FOR RAIN.   \"Come to me, every bird that flies,\" said the Great Father. \"There is work to be done that only my birds can do.\"  The birds were happy that they could do something to please the Great Father, for they remembered how good he had always been to them. They flew to him eagerly to ask what they should do for him. \"O Great Father,\" they sang all together, \"tell us what we can do for you.\"  \"The waters that I have made know not where to go,\" said the Father. \"Some should go to the seas, some should go to the lakes in the hollows among the mountains, and some should make rivers that will dance over the rocks and through the fields on their way to the sea.\"  \"And can even as small a bird as I show them where to go?\" asked the sparrow eagerly.  \"Yes,\" said the Father, \"even my little humming-bird can help me.\"  Every bird that flies had come to the Father, but the peetweet had come last because he was lazy.  \"I do not really wish to fly all over the earth,\" said he, \"to show the waters where to go.\"  \"Oh, I wish I were a bird,\" said a butterfly. \"I should be so glad to do something for the Father.\"  But the peetweet went on, \"I should think the lakes could find their way into the hollows of the mountains by themselves.\"  The Father heard the lazy peetweet, and he said, \"Do you not wish to show the waters where to go?\"  \"They never showed me where to go,\" said the lazy bird. \"I am not thirsty. Let whoever is thirsty and needs the water help the lakes and rivers.\"  The other birds all stood still in wonder. \"He will be punished,\" they whispered.  \"Yes, he must be punished,\" said the Father sadly. Then said he to the lazy peetweet, \"Never again shall you drink of the water that is in river or lake. When you are thirsty, you must look for a hollow in the rock where the rain has fallen, and there only shall you drink.\"  That is why the peetweet flies over river and lake, but ever cries eagerly, \"Peet-weet, peet-weet!\" for that is his word for \"Rain, rain!\"     WHY THE BEAR HAS A SHORT TAIL.   One cold morning when the fox was coming up the road with some fish, he met the bear.  \"Good-morning, Mr. Fox,\" said the bear.  \"Good-morning, Mr. Bear,\" said the fox. \"The morning is brighter because I have met you.\"  \"Those are very good fish, Mr. Fox,\" said the bear. \"I have not eaten such fish for many a day. Where do you find them?\"  \"I have been fishing, Mr. Bear,\" answered the fox.  \"If I could catch such fish as those, I should like to go fishing, but I do not know how to fish.\"  \"It would be very easy for you to learn, Mr. Bear,\" said the fox. \"You are so big and strong that you can do anything.\"  \"Will you teach me, Mr. Fox?\" asked the bear.  \"I would not tell everybody, but you are such a good friend that I will teach you. Come to this pond, and I will show you how to fish through the ice.\"  So the fox and the bear went to the frozen pond, and the fox showed the bear how to make a hole in the ice.  \"That is easy for you,\" said the fox, \"but many an animal could not have made that hole. Now comes the secret. You must put your tail down into the water and keep it there. That is not easy, and not every animal could do it, for the water is very cold; but you are a learned animal, Mr. Bear, and you know that the secret of catching fish is to keep your tail in the water a long time. Then when you pull it up, you will pull with it as many fish as I have.\"  The bear put his tail down into the water, and the fox went away. The sun rose high in the heavens, and still the bear sat with his tail through the hole in the ice. Sunset came, but still the bear sat with his tail through the hole in the ice, for he thought, \"When an animal is really learned, he will not fear a little cold.\"  It began to be dark, and the bear said, \"Now I will pull the fish out of the water. How good they will be!\" He pulled and pulled, but not a fish came out. Worse than that, not all of his tail came out, for the end of it was frozen fast to the ice.  [Illustration]  He went slowly down the road, growling angrily, \"I wish I could find that fox;\" but the cunning fox was curled up in his warm nest, and whenever he thought of the bear he laughed.     WHY THE WREN FLIES CLOSE TO THE EARTH.   One day when the birds were all together, one of them said, \"I have been watching men, and I saw that they had a king. Let us too have a king.\"  \"Why?\" asked the others.  \"Oh, I do not know, but men have one.\"  \"Which bird shall it be? How shall we choose a king?\"  \"Let us choose the bird that flies farthest,\" said one.  \"No, the bird that flies most swiftly.\"  \"The most beautiful bird.\"  \"The bird that sings best.\"  \"The strongest bird.\"  The owl sat a little way off on a great oak-tree. He said nothing, but he looked so wise that all the birds cried, \"Let us ask the owl to choose for us.\"  \"The bird that flies highest should be our king,\" said the owl with a wiser look than before, and the others said, \"Yes, we will choose the bird that flies highest.\"  The wren is very small, but she cried even more eagerly than the others, \"Let us choose the bird that flies highest,\" for she said to herself, \"They think the owl is wise, but I am wiser than he, and I know which bird can fly highest.\"  Then the birds tried their wings. They flew high, high up above the earth, but one by one they had to come back to their homes. It was soon seen which could fly highest, for when all the others had come back, there was the eagle rising higher and higher.  \"The eagle is our king,\" cried the birds on the earth, and the eagle gave a loud cry of happiness. But look! A little bird had been hidden in the feathers on the eagle's back, and when the eagle had gone as high as he could, the wren flew up from his back still higher.  \"Now which bird is king?\" cried the wren. \"The one that flew highest should be king, and I flew highest.\"  The eagle was angry, but not a word did he say, and the two birds came down to the earth together.  \"I am the king,\" said the wren, \"for I flew higher than the eagle.\" The other birds did not know which of the two to choose. At last they went to the oak-tree and asked the owl. He looked to the east, the west, the south, and the north, and then he said, \"The wren did not fly at all, for she was carried on the eagle's back. The eagle is king, for he not only flew highest, but carried the wren on his back.\"  \"Good, good!\" cried the other birds. \"The owl is the wisest bird that flies. We will do as he says, and the eagle shall be our king.\" The wren crept away. She thought she was wise before, but now she is really wise, for she always flies close to the earth, and never tries to do what she cannot.     WHY THE HOOFS OF THE DEER ARE SPLIT.   The manito of the Indians taught them how to do many things. He told them how to build wigwams, and how to hunt and to fish. He showed them how to make jars in which to keep food and water. When little children came to be with them, it was the manito who said, \"See, this is the way to make soft, warm cradles for the babies.\"  The good spirit often comes down from his happy home in the sky to watch the Indians at their work. When each man does as well as he can, the manito is pleased, but if an Indian is lazy or wicked, the spirit is angry, and the Indian is always punished in one way or another.  One day when the manito was walking in the forest, he said to himself, \"Everything is good and happy. The green leaves are whispering merrily together, the waves are lapping on the shore and laughing, the squirrels are chattering and laying up their food for winter. Everything loves me, and the colors of the flowers are brighter when I lay my hand upon them.\"  Then the manito heard a strange sound. \"I have not often heard that,\" said he. \"I do not like it. Some one in the forest has wicked thoughts in his heart.\"  Beside a great rock he saw a man with a knife.  \"What are you doing with the knife?\" asked the manito.  \"I am throwing it away,\" answered the man.  \"Tell me the truth,\" said the manito.  \"I am sharpening it,\" replied the man.  \"That is strange,\" said the manito, \"You have food in your wigwam. Why should you sharpen a knife?\"  The man could not help telling the truth to the manito, and so he answered, but greatly against his will, \"I am sharpening the knife to kill the wicked animals.\"  \"Which animal is wicked?\" asked the manito. \"Which one does you harm?\"  [Illustration: THE KNIFE ONLY WENT IN DEEPER]  \"Not one does me harm,\" said the man, \"but I do not like them. I will make them afraid of me, and I will kill them.\"  \"You are a cruel, wicked man,\" said the manito. \"The animals have done you no harm, and you do not need them for food. You shall no longer be a man. You shall be a deer, and be afraid of every man in the forest.\"  The knife fell from the man's hand and struck his foot. He leaped and stamped, but the knife only went in deeper. He cried aloud, but his voice sounded strange. His hands were no longer hands, but feet. Antlers grew from his head, and his whole body was not that of a man, but that of a deer. He runs in the forest as he will, but whenever he sees a man, he is afraid. His hoofs are split because the knife that he had made so sharp fell upon his foot when he was a man; and whenever he looks at them, he has to remember that it was his own wickedness which made him a deer.     THE STORY OF THE FIRST GRASSHOPPER.   In a country that is far away there once lived a young man called Tithonus. He was strong and beautiful. Light of heart and light of foot, he hunted the deer or danced and sang the livelong day. Every one who saw him loved him, but the one"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22420"],["title","The Book of Nature Myths (#7)"],["body","loved him most was a goddess named Aurora.  Every goddess had her own work, but the work of Aurora was most beautiful of all, for she was the goddess of the morning. It was she who went out to meet the sun and to light up his pathway. She watched over the flowers, and whenever they saw her coming, their colors grew brighter. She loved everything beautiful, and that is why she loved Tithonus.  \"Many a year have I roamed through this country,\" she said to herself, \"but never have I seen such bright blue eyes as those. O fairest of youths,\" she cried, \"who are you? Some name should be yours that sounds like the wind in the pine trees, or like the song of a bird among the first blossoms.\"  The young man fell upon his knees before her. \"I know well,\" said he, \"that you are no maiden of the earth. You are a goddess come down to us from the skies. I am but a hunter, and I roam through the forest looking for deer.\"  \"Come with me, fairest of hunters,\" said Aurora. \"Come with me to the home of my father. You shall live among my brothers and hunt with them, or go with me at the first brightness of the morning to carry light and gladness to the flowers.\"  So it was that Tithonus went away from his own country and his own home to live in the home of Aurora.  For a long time they were happy together, but one day Aurora said, \"Tithonus, I am a goddess, and so I am immortal, but some day death will bear you away from me. I will ask the father of the gods that you too may be immortal.\"  Then Aurora went to the king of the gods and begged that he would make Tithonus immortal.  \"Sometimes people are not pleased even when I have given them what they ask,\" replied the king, \"so think well before you speak.\"  \"I have only one wish,\" said Aurora, \"and it is that Tithonus, the fairest of youths, shall be immortal.\"  \"You have your wish,\" said the king of the gods, and again Tithonus and Aurora roamed happily together through forest and field.  One day Tithonus asked, \"My Aurora, why is it that I cannot look straight into your eyes as once I did?\" Another day he said, \"My Aurora, why is it that I cannot put my hand in yours as once I did?\"  Then the goddess wept sorrowfully. \"The king of the gods gave me what I asked for,\" she wailed, \"and I begged that you should be immortal. I did not remember to ask that you should be always young.\"  Everyday Tithonus grew older and smaller. \"I am no longer happy in your father's home,\" he said, \"with your brothers who are as beautiful and as strong as I was when I first saw you. Let me go back to my own country. Let me be a bird or an insect and live in the fields where we first roamed together. Let me go, dearest goddess.\"  \"You shall do as you will,\" replied Aurora sadly. \"You shall be a grasshopper, and whenever I hear the grasshopper's clear, merry song, I shall remember the happy days when we were together.\"     THE STORY OF THE ORIOLE.   The king of the north once said to himself, \"I am master of the country of ice and snow, but what is that if I cannot be ruler of the land of sunshine and flowers? I am no king if I fear the king of the south. The northwind shall bear my icy breath. Bird and beast shall quiver and tremble with cold. I myself will call in the voice of the thunder, and this ruler of the south, his king of summer, shall yield to my power.\"  The land of the south was ever bright and sunny, but all at once the sky grew dark, and the sun hid himself in fear. Black storm-clouds came from the north. An icy wind blew over the mountains. It wrestled with the trees of the southland, and even the oaks could not stand against its power. Their roots were tough and strong, but they had to yield, and the fallen trees lay on the earth and wailed in sorrow as the cruel storm-wind and rain beat upon them. The thunder growled in the hollows of the mountains, and in the fearful gloom came the white fire of the forked lightning, flaring through the clouds.  \"We shall perish,\" cried the animals of the sunny south. \"The arrows of the lightning are aimed at us. O dear ruler of the southland, must we yield to the cruel master of the north?\"  \"My king,\" said a little buzzing voice, \"may I go out and fight the wicked master of the storm-wind?\"  The thunder was still for a moment, and a mocking laugh was heard from among the clouds, for it was a little hornet that had asked to go out and meet the power of the ruler of the north.  \"Dear king, may I go?\" repeated the hornet.  \"Yes, you may go,\" said the king of the south, and the little insect went out alone, and bravely stung the master of the storm-wind.  The king of the north struck at him with a war-club, but the hornet only flew above his head and stung him again. The hornet was too small to be struck by the arrows of the lightning. He stung again and again, and at last the king of the north went back to his own country, and drove before him the thunder and lightning and rain and the black storm-clouds and the icy wind.  \"Brave little hornet,\" said the king of the south, \"tell me what I can do for you. You shall have whatever you ask.\"  Then said the little hornet, \"My king, on all the earth no one loves me. I do not wish to harm people, but they fear my sting, and they will not let me live beside their homes. Will you make men love me?\"  \"Little hornet,\" said the king gently, \"you shall no longer be a stinging insect feared by men. You shall be a bright and happy oriole, and when men see you, they will say, 'See the beautiful oriole. I shall be glad if he will build his nest on our trees.'\"  So the hornet is now an oriole, a bird that is loved by every one. His nest looks like that of a hornet because he learned how to build his home before he became an oriole.     WHY THE PEACOCK'S TAIL HAS A HUNDRED EYES.   Juno, queen of the gods, had the fairest cow that any one ever saw. She was creamy white, and her eyes were of as soft and bright a blue as those of any maiden in the world. Juno and the king of the gods often played tricks on each other, and Juno knew well that the king would try to get her cow. There was a watchman named Argus, and one would think that he could see all that was going on in the world, for he had a hundred eyes, and no one had ever seen them all asleep at once, so Queen Juno gave to Argus the work of watching the white cow.  The king of the gods knew what she had done, and he laughed to himself and said, \"I will play a trick on Juno, and I will have the white cow.\" He sent for Mercury and whispered in his ear, \"Mercury, go to the green field where Argus watches the cream-white cow and get her for me.\"  Mercury was always happy when he could play a trick on any one, and he set out gladly for the field where Argus watched the cream-white cow with every one of his hundred eyes.  Now Mercury could tell merry stories of all that was done in the world. He could sing, too, and the music of his voice had lulled many a god to sleep. Argus knew that, but he had been alone a long time, and he thought, \"What harm is there in listening to his merry chatter? I have a hundred eyes, and even if half of them were asleep, the others could easily keep watch of one cow.\" So he gladly hailed Mercury and said, \"I have been alone in this field a long, long time, but you have roamed about as you would. Will you not sing to me, and tell me what has happened in the world? You would be glad to hear stories and music if you had nothing to do but watch a cow, even if it was the cow of a queen.\"  So Mercury sang and told stories. Some of the songs were merry, and some were sad. The watchman closed one eye, then another and another, but there were two eyes that would not close for all the sad songs and all the merry ones. Then Mercury drew forth a hollow reed that he had brought from the river and began to play on it. It was a magic reed, and as he played, one could hear the water rippling gently on the shore and the breath of the wind in the pine-trees; one could see the lilies bending their heads as the dusk came on, and the stars twinkling softly in the summer sky.  It is no wonder that Argus closed one eye and then the other. Every one of his hundred eyes was fast asleep, and Mercury went away to the king of the gods with the cream-white cow.  [Illustration]  Juno had so often played tricks on the king that he was happy because he had played this one on her, but Juno was angry, and she said to Argus, \"You are a strange watchman. You have a hundred eyes, and you could not keep even one of them from falling asleep. My peacock is wiser than you, for he knows when any one is looking at him. I will put every one of your eyes in the tail of the peacock.\" And to-day, whoever looks at the peacock can count in his tail the hundred eyes that once belonged to Argus.     THE STORY OF THE BEES AND THE FLIES.   There were once two tribes of little people who lived near together. They were not at all alike, for one of the tribes looked for food and carried it away to put it up safely for winter, while the other played and sang and danced all day long.  \"Come and play with us,\" said the lazy people, but the busy workers answered, \"No, come and work with us. Winter will soon be here. Snow and ice will be everywhere, and if we do not put up food now we shall have none for the cold, stormy days.\"  So the busy people brought honey from the flowers, but the lazy people kept on playing. They laughed together and whispered to one another, \"See those busy workers! They will have food for two tribes, and they will give us some. Let us go and dance.\"  While the summer lasted, one tribe worked and the other played. When winter came, the busy workers were sorry for their friends and said, \"Let us give them some of our honey.\" So the people who played had as much food as if they, too, had brought honey from the flowers.  Another summer was coming, and the workers said, \"If we should make our home near the lilies that give us honey, it would be easier to get our food.\" So the"]]]
