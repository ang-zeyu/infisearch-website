This cow swerved around, and in a twinkling Abner Balberry was thrown on his back and the milk was sent flying over him.     CHAPTER II  A QUARREL IN THE BARNYARD   The sight of Abner Balberry flat on his back, and with the milk flowing over him, was a comical one, and for the instant Nat had to laugh out-right.  \"Hi! hi!\" roared the farmer. \"Git away! Drat the beasts! Now, Nat Nason, jest see what you've done!\"  He struggled to his feet, and Nat at once became sober, for he realized that trouble was at hand.  \"It's too bad, Uncle Abner----\" began the youth.  \"Too bad? I should say it was too bad!\" cried the farmer. \"An' all your fault, too!\"  \"I can't see how it was my fault. You told me to drive the cow up here.\"  \"Don't tell me, Nat Nason! It's your fault. An' all that fresh milk gone to waste!\" Abner Balberry gave a groan. \"I don't know most what I'm a-goin' to do with you fer this.\"  \"I can't see how it's my fault.\"  \"You made the cows git frightened.\"  \"No, I didn't.\"  \"Don't tell me! Don't you know that milk is worth money?\"  \"Yes, but----\"  \"You scart thet cow out o' her wits,\" went on the farmer, his rage growing as he looked at the spilt milk. \"Nat Nason, I tell you, you're a bad boy!\"  To this the youth made no reply.  \"I'm a-goin' to teach ye a lesson fer it!\"  \"Shall I milk Jule?\"  \"Yes, an' mind ye don't spill a drop nuther!\"  Silently Nat went to work, and milked not only the new cow but also two of the others. By this time milking was over, and the lacteal fluid was carried to the spring-house to cool. Then the cows were allowed to wander down to the pasture for the night.  When Nat approached the kitchen again an appetizing odor of frying fish filled the air. The boy's uncle followed him.  \"Supper is ready,\" said Mrs. Felton, cheerfully. \"You had some trouble with the cows, didn't you?\" she continued.  \"It was Nat's fault,\" grumbled Abner Balberry. \"He made them run around an' upset everything. Nat, I said as how I was going to teach ye a lesson. You wash up an' go to bed at once.\"  \"Go to bed?\" queried the boy.  \"Thet's what I said, didn't I?\"  \"Do you mean right after supper?\"  \"No, I mean before supper,\" snarled Abner Balberry.  \"Oh, isn't he to have his supper first?\" put in the housekeeper, timidly.  \"No, he ain't.\"  After this abrupt declaration there was an awkward pause.  \"Do you want me to go to bed without my supper?\" asked Nat, slowly.  \"That's what I said.\"  \"It isn't fair.\"  \"Ain't it?\"  \"No, it isn't. It wasn't my fault that the milk was spilt, so there!\"  \"You say much more to me an' I'll tan yer hide well fer ye!\" stormed Abner Balberry.  \"Don't you want him to have none of the fish he brought in?\" asked the housekeeper.  \"The fish ain't worth much.\"  \"Maybe you'd like to have all the fish yourself?\" put in Nat, tartly, before he had stopped to think.  Angered at this remark the farmer turned around and caught the youth by the collar and began to shake him.  \"I'll teach ye to talk back to me!\" he snarled. \"I'll teach ye! Now go to bed, an' be quick about it.\"  \"I want my supper!\" came doggedly from Nat. He felt that he had earned the meal and he needed it.  \"Not a mouthful.\"  \"If you don't give me my supper I won't work for you any more, Uncle Abner!\"  \"Wot! Goin' to talk to me like this!\" screamed the farmer, and caught the boy once again. \"Up to your room with ye, before I trounce ye well!\"  He shook Nat fiercely, and a struggle ensued between the pair which came to an end when a chair was overturned and then a side table on which rested some of the things for supper.  \"Oh, the eating!\" screamed the housekeeper, in alarm. \"And the teapot is smashed!\" she added, sadly.  \"It's all Nat's fault,\" came from Abner Balberry. \"He is a good-fer-nuthin', he is! Off to bed with ye, before I git my horsewhip!\"  He opened the door leading to the enclosed stairs, and fearful of another attack Nat retreated. As soon as he was on the stairs, the farmer slammed the door shut and bolted it. A minute later he and Mrs. Felton heard the youth ascend the stairs to his own room.  \"It was kind of hard on the boy to make him go to bed without his supper,\" remarked the housekeeper, as she gathered up the things on the floor.  \"It's his own fault,\" snorted the farmer. \"He's got to be took down, he has!\"  \"He hasn't had a mouthful since noon, and we had a light dinner, too.\"  \"I can't help that, Mrs. Felton. I'm goin' to teach him a lesson.\"  \"Nat is a high-spirited boy, Mr. Balberry. Maybe he won't stand for it.\"  \"He has got to stand fer it,\" was the answer, from the sink, where the farmer was washing his face and hands.  \"But if he won't?\"  \"Wot can he do, I'd like to know?\"  \"I'm sure I don't know--but he may do something that you least expect.\"  \"He won't do nuthin',\" said the farmer, and sank down in his seat at the table. \"He can't do nuthin'. I give him a good home, but he don't seem to a'preciate it nohow.\"  To this Mrs. Felton did not reply, but set the food on the table. The fish had not been spoilt, and the farmer ate all he wished of the dish.  \"Why don't you eat?\" he asked of the housekeeper, seeing that she had abstained from touching the fish.  \"I--I don't care for it,\" she answered. She had in mind to save what was left and give it to Nat for his breakfast.  \"That boy is gittin' too big fer his boots,\" went on Abner Balberry. \"He acts like he was of age, an' he is only sixteen. Last week he wanted to know how soon I was goin' to pay him reg'lar wages.\"  \"And what did you tell him?\"  \"Told him I'd pay him wages when he was wuth it an' not before.\"  \"He does almost a man's work now, doesn't he?\"  \"Not much! Besides, don't I feed an' clothe him an' give him a comfortable home? He's got too high-falutin' notions, he has!\"  \"But don't you think he ought to have some money?\" went on Mrs. Felton, who could be a trifle independent herself at times.  \"No. Money is the ruination o' young folks. Week before last he wanted a quarter to go to the circus with, but he didn't git it.\"  \"Almost all of the boys in this district went to the circus. Tom Bradley told me it was very good, too.\"  \"Humph! That Bradley boy is going to the dogs as fast as he can go.\"  \"Deacon Slide thinks he is a very good boy.\"  \"Well, the deacon don't know everything. I'm goin' to make Nat toe the mark until he is twenty-one. After that I'll wash my hands o' him.\"  The farmer finished his supper and then went out to see that everything was all right around the farm for the night. A little later he took a lamp and went upstairs. Tiptoeing his way through an upper hall he came to a pause in front of Nat's room.  \"Asleep, jest as I thought,\" he told himself, after listening to the boy's breathing. Then he peeped into the room, to behold Nat lying under the cover of the bed, with his face turned to the wall.  \"I'll give him another talkin' to in the mornin',\" the farmer told himself; and then retired, with no thought of what was going to happen before the sun arose upon another day.     CHAPTER III  NAT LEAVES THE FARM   Farmer Balberry was mistaken; Nat was not asleep, nor was there any thought of sleep in the boy's mind.  The youth had not even gone to bed. He had been sitting on a chair by the open window when he had heard his uncle coming upstairs, and to deceive his relative had jumped into bed and pulled the blanket up over him.  When Nat was thrust up the stairs his mind was in a tumult. He felt that his uncle was not treating him fairly--and he wanted his supper very much.  It is bad enough to have a real grievance of any kind--it is worse when one must bear it on an empty stomach. As he made his way to his room the boy was in a savage humor and fit to do almost any deed.  \"Uncle Abner is getting worse every day!\" he muttered to himself. \"He treats me worse than I would treat a dog!\"  Sitting by the open window Nat thought of many things--of the death of his parents, and of the taking off of his aunt--and of how his miserly uncle had treated him ever since.  \"It's not fair!\" he told himself, over and over again. \"Uncle Abner doesn't believe in giving a boy a fair show. I wish I lived with somebody else.\"  The more he thought over the situation the more he felt that he ought not to stand such treatment. He felt that he was entitled to his supper, and also to some spending money if not to regular wages. At the present time he had not a cent in the world.  \"If I had a few dollars I might strike out for myself,\" he reasoned. \"But I haven't even a few cents. Wonder how I could raise a few dollars?\"  As said before Nat's worldly possessions were few. In his room he had some trinkets from home and also an old silver watch which had belonged to his father.  \"I might sell the watch,\" he thought, but then decided that it would be best to keep the heirloom.  Then he thought of Jennie, the white and brown cow. As a calf she had been given to Nat by his mother, and she was now a part of the herd on the Balberry farm.  \"Jennie ought to be worth twenty or twenty-five dollars,\" he said to himself. \"That's a pile of money, for a start. Wonder how I could manage to sell her?\"  Thus speculating, Nat gradually drifted around to the point where he decided that he would leave the farm at once. He had told his uncle that he wanted his supper or he would not work for the man any more, and he meant to keep his word.  By the time all was quiet around the house and he was certain both the housekeeper and his uncle had retired, Nat had settled just what he was going to do.  Making no noise, he slipped off his working clothes and put on his best suit--something just a trifle better than the others. He also donned a clean shirt and collar and necktie and got out his best hat and shoes. Then, with his other possessions wrapped in a small bundle, and with his shoes under his arm, he tiptoed his way out of the bedchamber, along the hall, and down to the lower floor of the farmhouse.  Nat knew exactly where Mrs. Felton kept the things to eat, so"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22565"],["title","From Farm to Fortune; or, Nat Nason's Strange Experience (#2)"],["body","was not necessary for him to light a lamp. The use of a match revealed as much as he wanted to know, and in a short time he was devouring what was left of the fish and also some bread and butter and a generous quarter of a cherry pie, which the housekeeper had insisted upon baking the day before, somewhat against Abner Balberry's will, for the farmer would rather have sold the cherries at the store.  His meal finished, Nat hesitated for a moment, and then got out an old newspaper. Into this he wrapped half a dozen slices of bread and butter, along with a bit of cheese and two rather stale doughnuts.  \"They'll come in handy for breakfast, along with an apple or two,\" was the way he reasoned. \"Especially if I don't happen to sell the cow.\"  The boy's next move was to leave the house, which he did after tying his clothes and the lunch into one bundle, which he slung on a stick over his shoulder. Once outside, he put on his shoes and then made his way from the house to the barnyard, and then along the lane leading to the pasture.  The late moon was showing over the hills and the heavens were bright with stars, so it was by no means dark. As he entered the lane Nat looked back, to see if his departure from the house had been discovered.  A sight met his gaze which caused his heart to jump. A man was crossing the dooryard and coming toward the barn!  \"It must be Uncle Abner!\" he thought. \"Perhaps he heard me leave after all!\"  He looked back again, but could not see the man now, and then broke into a run. Soon a row of trees in the orchard hid both the barn and the house from view. He continued to run, however, and did not slacken his pace until he reached the pasture where the cows were at rest.  Jennie did not relish having her rest disturbed and had to be prodded several times before she would arise and move in the direction he desired. Some of the other cows wished to follow, but he drove them back.  \"I only want my own,\" he murmured half aloud. \"I don't want a thing that belongs to Uncle Abner.\"  Nat had expected to take to the highway which ran directly beside the house. But he was afraid that his uncle was watching for him from the barn, and so he drove Jennie along a back road, leading to another highway which was but little traveled and which had along it only a handful of farmhouses.  \"He shan't catch me if I can help it,\" the boy told himself. \"Now I've left I'm going to stay away.\"  Nat was still very much agitated in his mind, so no thought of sleep came to him as he trudged along, mile after mile, driving the tired cow before him. He met not a soul; and thus he progressed until three o'clock in the morning.  Boy and cow had now been on the road six hours and Jennie refused to go further. Seeing this, he turned into a small patch of woods and there tied the creature to a tree. Then, finding a sheltered nook, he threw himself down to rest and was soon fast asleep.  \"Hullo, there, what are you doing here?\"  Such was the demand which aroused Nat several hours later, and he sprang up to find himself confronted by a farmer boy of about his own age.  \"Hullo, Sam,\" he answered. \"I--I was driving the cow to market and I got so tired I thought I'd take a nap.\"  \"Going to sell the cow?\" asked Sam Price.  \"Yes, if I can.\"  \"Where?\"  \"Over to Brookville, if anybody will buy her.\"  \"Jackson the butcher was after cows only day before yesterday.\"  \"Then maybe I'll go and see him.\"  \"You must have got an early start,\" went on Sam Price.  \"I did. But I must hurry along,\" continued Nat, not caring to answer too many questions. \"I slept too long.\"  \"You'd better hurry. Your uncle ain't the one to let you play, is he?\"  \"You're right, Sam.\"  \"What does he want you to get for the cow?\"  \"It isn't his cow. She belongs to me. I had her from the time she was a little calf, and I've a right to sell her.\"  \"Oh, yes, I remember now. Well, I hope you get a good price for her.\"  \"I'll get as much as I can.\"  \"Want me to go along?\"  \"You can go along if you wish.\"  \"All right, I haven't anything else to do for a while.\"  \"But I want to tell you one thing, Sam. Can you keep a secret?\"  \"Can I? Try me and see.\"  \"You won't tell a soul?\"  \"I'll give you my word. But what's up?\"  \"I'm not coming back.\"  \"What!\"  \"It's a fact.\"  \"Do you mean that you are going to run away?\"  \"That's the plain English of it, Sam. I'm tired of living with my uncle. He doesn't treat me fairly.\"  \"I believe that. My father thinks he is the meanest man in the State of Ohio.\"  \"Well, I don't know about that, but he is pretty mean, I can tell you that. I'm not going to stand it any longer.\"  \"Where are you going?\"  \"I don't know yet. Most likely to one of the big cities. Somehow, I think I could do better in a city than on a farm.\"  \"Do you? Now I think a country boy has no show in a big city. He don't know the ways, and he is sure to get cheated out of his eyes--so my father says.\"  \"They won't cheat me,\" said Nat, decidedly.  \"Father says every big city is full of sharpers, on the watch for greenies.\"  \"Well, they shan't catch me for a greeny,\" answered Nat.  Alas for poor Nat! Little did he dream of what was in store for him, and of the little trap into which he was to fall as soon as he arrived in New York City.     CHAPTER IV  ABNER BALBERRY'S DISCOVERY   \"Nat!\"  Abner Balberry uttered the name in a loud, clear voice and waited fully a minute for an answer.  \"Nat!\" he repeated. \"I want you to answer me, do you hear? Nat!\"  Still there was no reply, and now, in some alarm, Abner Balberry turned back into his bedchamber and donned part of his clothing.  \"If that boy is moving around this house I'm goin' to know it,\" he murmured to himself, as he felt his way toward Nat's room. Coming to the door, he threw it open and took a step toward the bed.  As we already know, it was empty. The discovery was something of a shock to the farmer and for the moment he stood stock-still, gazing at the bed and feeling under the covers to make certain that his nephew was not really there.  \"Gone!\" he muttered at last. \"He must be downstairs. More'n likely he went down to git somethin' to eat. Wait till I catch him! I'll tan him well!\"  Hoping to catch Nat unawares, he tiptoed his way down the stairs and entered the living room. Then he passed to the kitchen and the shed, and came back to peer into the parlor. Not a trace of the lad was to be found anywhere.  \"I certainly heard him,\" he reasoned. \"I certainly did.\"  \"Mr. Balberry!\" The call came from the housekeeper. \"Are you up?\"  \"Yes, I am.\"  \"Oh, all right.\"  \"But it ain't all right! Nat's up too.\"  \"Is he down there with you?\"  \"No, I don't know at all where he is. I'm a-lookin' fer him.\"  By this time Mrs. Felton's curiosity was aroused and she lost no time in slipping on her wrapper. When she came down she brought with her a lamp.  \"Where do you suppose he went?\" she asked.  \"How do I know?\" snarled Abner Balberry.  The housekeeper happened to glance into the pantry. She was about to utter an exclamation, but checked herself.  \"What did you say, Mrs. Felton?\"  \"I--I didn't say anything.\"  \"He ain't in there, is he?\"  \"No.\"  \"Has he been at the victuals?\"  \"Not--not very much,\" stammered the housekeeper.  \"Humph! I guess he ate as much as he wanted. Jest wait till I catch him--I'll tan him harder than he was ever tanned before!\"  \"Maybe he went to bed again.\"  \"No, I jest looked into his room.\"  Abner Balberry unlocked the kitchen door and stepped out into the dooryard. As he did this he caught sight of somebody running swiftly down the road.  \"Hi! Stop!\" he yelled. \"Stop, Nat, do you hear?\"  To this there was no answer, and the fleeing individual merely ran the faster.  \"Was it Nat?\" asked the housekeeper.  \"To be sure it was. Oh, wait till I lay my hands on him!\" And the farmer shook his fist at the figure that was fast disappearing in the gloom.  \"What's that light in the barn?\" demanded Mrs. Felton, an instant later.  \"Light? Where?\"  \"Up in the haymow.\"  Abner Balberry gave a glance toward the structure.  \"The barn's afire!\" he screamed. \"Thet good-fer-nuthin' boy has set the place on fire!\"  \"Oh! oh!\" screamed the housekeeper, and began to tremble from head to feet, for to her mind a fire was the most dreadful thing that could happen.  \"I've got to git thet fire out,\" said the farmer, and ran toward the barn with all speed.  \"Be careful, or you'll be burnt up!\" screamed Mrs. Felton.  \"Go on an' git the water pails!\" said the farmer. \"Fill everything with water. An' bring a rag carpet, an' I'll soak thet too!\"  He already had an old patch of carpet used at the doorstep in his hand, and this he soused in the watering trough as he passed. Then he ran into the open barn and mounted to the loft.  The fire was in a patch of hay at one end of the loft, close to an open window. Regardless of his personal safety, Abner Balberry leaped in and threw part of the hay out of the window. Then he began to beat out the fire with the water-soaked carpet.  \"Here's some water,\" came timidly from below, and Mrs. Felton appeared with two pails full to the brim. He took these upstairs and dashed them on the flames.  \"You look out or you'll be burnt up!\" cried the housekeeper. She was trembling to such a degree that she could scarcely stand.  \"Git some more water,\" was Abner Balberry's only reply. The thought that his barn might be totally destroyed filled him with dread, for there was no insurance on the structure--he being too miserly to pay the premium demanded by the insurance company.  More water was procured by Mrs. Felton, and at last it was apparent that the farmer was getting the best of the fire. He worked hard and did not seem to mind the fact that his eyebrows were singed and his hands slightly blistered.  \"There! now I've got it!\" he sighed at last.  \"Are you sure?\" asked the housekeeper in a faint voice.  \"Yes, but I'm a-goin' to hunt around fer sparks. Git some more water.\"  Additional water was soon at hand, and Abner"]]]
