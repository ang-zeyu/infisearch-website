How dare he be curious about her, she thought rather angrily.  Let him confine himself to making the lids of his hostess droop and her cheeks dimple.  Not that Christine believed there to be any harm in their open flirtation--Mrs. van Cannan was plainly devoted to her husband; perhaps it was natural that she should enjoy admiration.  She possessed the kind of beauty only to be achieved by the woman who makes the care of her appearance an art, and spends hours in absolute repose of mind and body.  Her face had not a line in it of strain or sorrow.  Faint pink tinted her cheeks.  Her pink-linen gown, open in a low V, showed the perfect contour and creaminess of her breast.  The restless, adoring eyes of her husband came back to her always with that glance, vigilant and sombre, that was peculiar to them.  With some assumption of state, he always sat in the centre of the body of the table, with his wife beside him.  Saltire sat at her right, and Saxby, the overseer, was placed beside his host.  Opposite them, on the other side of the table, were the two young Hollanders and a cheerful Scotch colonial called McNeil.  These six men were expected to take both luncheon and dinner at the farm, but only the Hollanders turned up in the evening, perhaps because the excellence of the fare was outbalanced by the long prayers and hymns with which the meal was prefaced and ended.  Even at lunch-time, there was a Bible at the host's elbow, from which he read a number of texts before pronouncing a long grace, while the visitors listened with expressions that varied from embarrassment to impatience.  Richard Saltire always looked frankly bored, but sometimes he and Mrs. van Cannan exchanged a smile of sympathy at having to listen to the maledictions of Job while the roast was getting cold.  Hymns for lunch were mercifully omitted.  Bernard van Cannan, though plainly a religious fanatic, was also the owner of one of the wealthiest farms in the colony, and no doubt he realized that the working-hours of his employees might be more profitably engaged than by chanting hymns.  Saxby, the overseer, a dark, burly man of unusual height, was marked by the thick lips and general fulness of countenance that suggests to those who have lived long enough in Africa \"a touch of colour.\"  He had the soft voice, too, and full, deep laugh of those who have a dash of native blood in their veins.  His manner was melancholy, though charming, and he imposed his society upon no man, but attended strictly to his business.  He was the best manager the farm had ever known. After being there for less than a year, he had so improved the stock and the land that Bernard van Cannan looked upon him as a little god, and his word was law on the farm.  His private history, a rather sad one, Christine had already heard from Mrs. van Cannan.  It appeared that his wife had been terribly disfigured in a fire and was not only a semi-invalid but a victim of melancholia.  She lived with him in an isolated bungalow some way off, and he did everything for her with his own hands as she shrank from being seen by any one, and particularly detested natives.  While her husband was away at his duties, she remained locked in the bungalow, inaccessible to any one save Mrs. van Cannan, who sometimes went to sit with her.  \"But I can't bear to go often,\" Isabel van Cannan told Miss Chaine. \"She depresses me so terribly, and what good can I do her, poor soul?\"  Unnecessary for her to add that she hated being depressed.  It was bad for the complexion, she laughed.  Laughter was never far from her lips. But, at the moment, there really seemed some trace of the morning's pain on her as she looked at her husband.  \"Bernard's shoulder is giving him so much trouble,\" she said appealingly to Saltire.  \"He wants to go to East London to see his old specialist, but I don't believe in that man.  I think rest in bed is the cure for all ills.  Don't you agree with me, Mr. Saltire?\"  \"Bed has its uses no doubt,\" laughed Saltire, with the cheerful carelessness of the thoroughly healthy man, \"but a change of scene is better sometimes, for some people.\"  Van Cannan, his shoulder and left eye twitching perpetually, turned a searching gaze upon the deeply tanned face of the forestry expert, as though suspecting some double meaning in the words.  Saltire bore the scrutiny undisturbed.  Immaculate in white linens, his handsome fairish head wearing a perpetually well-groomed look, perhaps by reason of a bullet which, during the Boer War, had skimmed straight through his hair, leaving a perfect parting in the centre, he was a striking contrast to the haggard master of the house, who muttered morosely:  \"There is some Latin saying--isn't there?--about people 'changing their skies but not their dispositions.'\"  \"_In_disposition is a different matter,\" remarked Saxby sagely, \"and with neuritis it is a mistake to let the pain get too near the heart. I think you ought to see a doctor, Mr. van Cannan, but East London is a long way off.  Why not call in the district man?\"  \"He would prescribe a bottle of pink water and charge me a couple of pounds for it.  I need better treatment than that.  I could not even ride this morning--had to leave my horse and walk home.  The pain was vile.\"  Saxby looked at him sympathetically.  \"Well, try a couple of weeks' rest in bed, as Mrs. van Cannan suggests. You know that I can keep things going all right.\"  \"And Mr. Saltire will continue to turn the prickly-pears into ogres and hags,\" said his wife, with her childlike smile.  \"When you get up again, he will have a whole army of shrivelled monsters ready for you.\"  It is true that this was Richard Saltire's business on the farm--to rid the land of that bane and pest of the Karoo, the prickly-pear cactus. The new governmental experiment was the only one, so far, that had shown any good results in getting rid of the pest.  It consisted in inoculating each bush with certain poisons, which, when they entered the sap of the plant, shrivelled and withered it to the core, making its large, pale, flapping hands drop off as though smitten by leprosy, and causing the whole bush to assume a staggering, menacing attitude that was immensely startling and grotesque.  Many of the natives were now afraid to go about on the farm after dusk.  They said the prickly-pears threatened them, even ran after them, intent on revenge.  Christine had heard Mr. van Cannan say that his father knew the man whose grandfather was the first Dutchman to introduce the prickly-pear into the Karoo.  It was a great treasure then, being looked upon as good fodder for beast and ostrich in time of drought, and the boy used to be beaten if he did not properly water the leaves which were being laboriously preserved on the great trek into the desert. Unfortunately, the preservation had been so complete that it was now the ruin of many a fine Karoo estate, springing up everywhere, smothering other growths and destroying, with its tiny multitudinous thorns, the stomachs of the cattle, who love too much its watery leaves.  Mr. van Cannan was one of the farmers rich enough to take drastic steps to save his farm.  Saltire was doing it for him very thoroughly and efficiently.  \"How much longer do you expect to be?\" asked van Cannan.  \"Oh, another three weeks ought to finish the job,\" said Saltire.  \"But, as you know, they are most persistent things.  When you think they are done for, you find them sprouting green again below the wound, and have to give them another dose.\"  \"Three weeks!\" muttered van Cannan, with moody eyes.  He looked to Christine like a man suffering with sickness of the soul.  Everyone supposed the rest-cure definitely settled on, but, with the contrariness of an ailing child, he suddenly announced determinedly, \"I shall leave for East London this afternoon.\"  The children were called to kiss him good-bye, and they clustered round him.  \"Take care of them for me,\" he said, with a piercing wistfulness, to Christine.  \"Take care of my boy.\"  Then he turned brusquely to Saxby, making arrangements for a mule-cart to be ready at two o'clock to drive him into Cradock, the nearest large town, where he would have to spend the night before proceeding farther by rail.  Christine could not but be struck by the words he had used, and mused over them wonderingly while she tucked Rita and Coral under their mosquito-curtains.  It was her habit to spend this hour with Roddy and a story-book.  But today he hovered restlessly, showing no inclination to settle down, and seeming full of some suppressed excitement.  At last, he whispered in her ear:  \"Don't forget where you said you would come with me--to see Carol and the others.\"  Christine wondered if old Sophy was one of the others, and, even in the noontide heat, she felt a chill.  \"All right, Roddy,\" she agreed slowly.  \"Wait till I get a sunshade, though.  It is dreadfully hot.\"  She shaded him as much as herself while they threaded their way through the shrubs that seemed to simmer in the grey-brown heat.  Almost every South African farm has its private cemetery.  It is the custom to bury the dead where they have lived, and often the graveyard is in the shadiest corner of the garden, where the women sit to sew, the men bring their pipes, and children spread their playthings upon the flat, roughly hewn tombstones.  At Blue Aloes, the place of the dead was hidden far from the haunts of the living, but the narrow, uncertain path led to it at last--a bare, sun-bleached spot, secluded but unshaded by a gaudy-blossomed hedge of cactus.  A straight, single line of graves, less than a dozen in number, lay blistering in the sunshine.  Some were marked with slabs of lime-worn [Transcriber's note: time-worn?] stone, upon whose faded lettering little green rock-lizards were disporting "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22568"],["title","Blue Aloes: Stories of South Africa (#3)"],["body","themselves.  The last two in the line had white marble crosses at their heads, each bearing a name in black letters, and a date.  The preceding one, too, was fairly new, with the earth heaped in still unbroken lumps upon it, but it bore no distinguishing mark of any kind.  Death appeared to have been fairly busy in recent times at Blue Aloes.  The date on the end grave was no older than six months.  Little Bernard Quentin van Cannan lay there, sleeping too soon at the age of three and a half.  Roddy pronounced his brief but sufficiently eloquent epitaph.  \"He was Coral's twin.  A tarantula bit him--one of the awful big poisonous ones out of the aloe hedge.\"  The next cross registered the resting-place of Carol Quentin van Cannan--drowned a year back, at the age of nine.  Christine's sad gaze travelled to the third and unmarked mound.  \"Is that Sophy's grave?\" she asked softly, for shrivelling on the lumps of earth lay a bunch of poppies that she had seen Roddy gathering the day before, and now remembered wondering where he had disappeared to afterward.  Roddy did not answer.  He was staring before him with manful eyes that winked rapidly but shed no tears.  His lips were pursed up as if to whistle, yet made no sound.  At the sight of him and the withered poppies in the place where never a flower of memory blossomed, hot tears surged to the girl's eyes.  It was wistful to think of a child remembering when all others forgot.  \"No one ever comes here but me,\" he said, at last.  Christine got rid of her tears by turning her back on him and pressing them away with her fingers, for she knew that emotion embarrasses and pains children, and she wanted to help this small, brave man, not hurt him.  \"You and I will come here often, Roddy.  We will turn it into a garden, and make it blossom like the rose--shall we?\"  \"Yes, yes!\" he cried eagerly.  \"'Blossom like the rose'--that comes out of the Bible!  I have heard daddy read it.  But we must not talk about it to mamma.  It makes her too sad to come here, or even talk about it. Mamma doesn't like sad things.\"  Suddenly, the strange quietude of the place was invaded by the sound of voices.  They were far-off voices, but both the girl and the child started as though caught in some forbidden act, and instinctively took hands.  A moment later they were hurrying away from the lonely spot, back by the way they had come.  Half-way home they came upon Richard Saltire and the squad of Kafirs who carried his implements and liquids. Theirs were the voices that had been heard.  Work had begun on the territory so thickly sewn with prickly-pears that lay between farm and cemetery.  Saltire, with sleeves rolled up, was operating with a syringe upon the trunk of a giant bush, but he turned round to throw a smile to Roddy.  \"Hello, Rod!\"  \"Hello, Dick!\" was the blithe response.  \"Gr-r-r!  You giving it to that old bush?\"  \"Rather!  He's getting it where the chicken got the ax.  Like to have a go at him?\"  \"Oh--oh--yes!\"  Roddy delightedly grasped the syringe, and was instructed how to fill and plunge it into the green, dropsical flesh of the plant.  The Kafirs stood looking on with grave, imperturbable faces.  Christine sat down on a rock and, from the rosy shadow of her parasol, observed the pair. She was astonished at this revelation of intimacy.  Saltire's satirical blue eyes were full of warm affection as he looked at the boy, and Roddy's manner toward him contained a loving familiarity and trust she had never seen him exhibit to any one.  It was interesting, too, to watch the man's fine, capable hands manipulating his instruments and his quick eye searching each bush to select a vulnerable spot for the virus of death.  His movements had the grace and energy of one whose every muscle is trained by service and in perfect condition.  Only men who hail from cold climates retain this characteristic in Africa. Those born in its disintegrating heats are usually overtaken in the early thirties by physical weariness or, as some choose to call it, \"slackness\" that only fine moral training can overcome.  He was good to look at, too, this man in spotless white clothes, the blueness of his eyes throwing up the clear tan of his face, his burnished hair lying close to his head.  Christine thought rather sadly that the presence on the farm of any one so sane and fearless-looking would have been a great comfort to her, if only he had not been one of the people whose ways troubled her most.  It was with difficulty that she at last got Roddy away, he was so evidently under the forestry man's spell.  Almost she felt that spell herself when he began talking to her, looking deep into her eyes while he explained his work; but suddenly it seemed to her that those blue eyes were explaining something quite different, and, flushing furiously, she made haste to take Roddy's hand and end the interview by walking away.  There was considerable trouble during the afternoon with Rita and Coral.  If Christine turned her back for a moment, they flew out into the sunshine, hatless, disporting themselves like baby ostriches. Reproaches were received with trills of laughter, warnings of punishment with trusting, happy eyes.  When, at last, Christine had them safely absorbed in a table-game, it was to realize that Roddy had suddenly disappeared.  Calling Meekie to take charge of the little girls, she hastened, with beating heart, in search of the boy.  Instinct took her in the direction of the dam, and she caught him up just as he had reached its brink.  He looked at her brightly, no sign of shamefacedness or sulkiness on him, but would give no further explanation than that he \"only wanted to peep in.\"  \"But, Roddy, how could you be so disobedient, dear?  And you remember what your mother said this morning?\"  \"Yes, I remember; but I did not promise.  If I had promised, I would not have gone.\"  \"Well, will you promise me, darling?\"  But at that he broke away from her and ran toward the house, singing, \"Just a little peep-in--just a little peep-in.\"  She felt more than slightly dispirited.  There were three bad nights behind her, and the day had been particularly tiring.  Though young and energetic, and with an extraordinary sense of love and responsibility toward these naughty, attractive children, she wondered, for a weary moment, whether she could stand the racket.  The work of governessing was new to her.  Any work was new to her, and governessing in Africa is as different to governessing in England (which is bad enough) as plowing cultivated land is to opening up virgin soil.  But life had unexpectedly laid the burden of work upon Christine Chaine, and having put her hand to the plow, she did not mean to turn back.  Only, for once, she was glad when nightfall brought the hour when she could leave her charges for a while in someone else's care.  Once the children were safely in bed, it was Meekie's task to sit beside them until Christine had dined and rested, and chose to come to bed.  Meekie belonged to the kraal people, but she had white blood in her, like so many natives, and spoke very good English.  That all the men on the farm should turn up to dinner that evening did not seem to Christine so much a cause for surprise as for contempt.  In her short but not too happy experience of life, she had, like a certain great American philosopher, discovered that the game of life is not always \"played square\" when there is a woman in it.  Of course, it was comprehensible that all men liked a good dinner, especially when it was not marred by hymns and long prayers, fervent to the point of fanaticism.  Equally, of course, the pretty hostess, with a charming word of welcome for everyone, was an attraction in herself.  But, somehow, it sickened the clear heart of Christine Chaine to see this jubilant gathering round a dinner table that was usually deserted, and from which the host had just departed, a sick and broken man.  She thought the proceedings more worthy of a lot of heartless schoolboys delighting in a master's absence than of decent, honest men.  And whatever she thought of the Hollanders and colonials, whose traditions were unknown to her, it was certain that her scorn was redoubled for the one man she knew to be of her own class and land.  Yet there he sat at the elbow of his hostess, calm and smiling, no whit removed from his usual self-contained and arrogant self.  Christine gave him one long look that seemed to turn her violet eyes black; then she looked no more his way.  She could not have told why she hated this action in him so bitterly.  Perhaps she felt that he was worthy of higher things, but, if questioned, she would probably have laid it at the door of caste and country.  All that she knew, for a poignant moment, was an intense longing to strike the smile from his lips with anything to hand--a wine-glass, a bowl, a knife.  Mercifully, the moment passed, and all that most of them saw was a young girl who had come late to dinner--a girl with a rather radiant skin, purply black hair that branched away from her face as though with a life of its own, and violet eyes that, after one swordlike glance all round, were hidden under a line of heavy lashes.  The black-velvet dinner gown she wore, simple to austerity, had just a faint rim of tulle at the edges against her skin.  Only an artist or connoisseur would have observed the milkiness of that skin and the perfect lines under the sombre velvet.  Small wonder that most eyes turned to the lady who tonight took the place of ceremony at the table, and who, as always, was arrayed in the delicate laces and pinkish tints that seemed to call to notice the gold of the hair, the rose of her cheek, and the golden-brown shadows of her eyes.  The little cloud of sadness and loss that hovered over her, yet never descended, was like the rain-cloud that sometimes threatens a June day. It seemed everyone's business to drive that cloud away, and everyone but Christine applied"]]]
