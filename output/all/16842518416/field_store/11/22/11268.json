The great names of Hiawatha and Atotarho are still borne by plain farmer-councillors on the Canadian Reservation.  When the League was established, Hiawatha had been adopted by the Mohawk nation as one of their chiefs.  The honor in which he was held by them is shown by his position on the roll of councillors, as it has been handed down from the earliest times.  As the Mohawk nation is the \"elder brother,\" the names of its chiefs are first recited.  At the head of the list is the leading Mohawk chief, Tekarihoken, who represents the noblest lineage of the Iroquois stock.  Next to him, and second on the roll, is the name of Hiawatha.  That of his great colleague, Dekanawidah, nowhere appears.  He was a member of the first council; but he forbade his people to appoint a successor to him.  \"Let the others have successors,\" he said proudly, \"for others can advise you like them.  But I am the founder of your league, and no one else can do what I have done.\"  The boast was not unwarranted.  Though planned by another, the structure had been reared mainly by his labors.  But the Five Nations, while yielding abundant honor to the memory of Dekanawidah, have never regarded him with the same affectionate reverence which has always clung to the name of Hiawatha.  His tender and lofty wisdom, his wide-reaching benevolence, and his fervent appeals to their better sentiments, enforced by the eloquence of which he was master, touched chords in the popular heart which have continued to respond until this day.  Fragments of the speeches in which he addressed the council and the people of the league are still remembered and repeated.  The fact that the league only carried out a part of the grand design which he had in view is constantly affirmed.  Yet the failure was not due to lack of effort.  In pursuance of his original purpose, when the league was firmly established, envoys were sent to other tribes to urge them to join it or at least to become allies.  One of these embassies penetrated to the distant Cherokees, the hereditary enemies of the Iroquois nations.  For some reason with which we are not acquainted--perhaps the natural suspicion or vindictive pride of that powerful community--this mission was a failure.  Another, despatched to the western Algonquins, had better success.  A strict alliance was formed with the far-spread Ojibway tribes, and was maintained inviolate for at least two hundred years, until at length the influence of the French, with the sympathy of the Ojibways for the conquered Hurons, undid to some extent, though not entirely, this portion of Hiawatha's work.  His conceptions were beyond his time, and beyond ours; but their effect, within a limited sphere, was very great.  For more than three centuries the bond which he devised held together the Iroquois nations in perfect amity.  It proved, moreover, as he intended, elastic.  The territory of the Iroquois, constantly extending as their united strength made itself felt, became the \"Great Asylum\" of the Indian tribes.  Of the conquered Eries and Hurons, many hundreds were received and adopted among their conquerors.  The Tuscaroras, expelled by the English from North Carolina, took refuge with the Iroquois, and became the sixth nation of the League. From still further south, the Tuteloes and Saponies, of Dakota stock, after many wars with the Iroquois, fled to them from their other enemies, and found a cordial welcome.  A chief still sits in the council as a representative of the Tuteloes, though the tribe itself has been swept away by disease, or absorbed in the larger nations.  Many fragments of tribes of Algonquin lineage--Delawares, Nanticokes, Mohicans, Mississagas,--sought the same hospitable protection, which never failed them.  Their descendants still reside on the Canadian Reservation, which may well be styled an aboriginal \"refuge of nations,\"--affording a striking evidence in our own day of the persistent force of a great idea, when embodied in practical shape by the energy of a master mind.  The name by which their constitution or organic law is known among them is _kayánerenh_, to which the epitaph _kowa_ [Transcriber's note: the \"o\" is the Unicode o-macron], \"great,\" is frequently added.  This word, _kayánerenh_, is sometimes rendered \"law,\" or \"league,\" but its proper meaning seems to be \"peace.\"  It is used in this sense by the missionaries, in their translations of the scriptures and the prayer-book.  In such expressions as \"the Prince of Peace,\" \"the author of peace,\" \"give peace in our time,\" we find _kayánerenh_ employed with this meaning.  Its root is _yaner_, signifying \"noble,\" or \"excellent,\" which yields, among many derivatives, _kayánere_, \"goodness,\" and _kayánerenh_, \"peace,\" or \"peacefulness.\"  The national hymn of the confederacy, sung whenever their \"Condoling Council\" meets, commences with a verse referring to their league, which is literally rendered, \"We come to greet and thank the PEACE\" (_kayánerenh_).  When the list of their ancient chiefs, the fifty original Councillors, is chanted in the closing litany of the meeting, there is heard from time to time, as the leaders of each clan are named, an outburst of praise, in the words--    \"This was the roll of you--   You that were joined in the work,   You that confirmed the work,     The GREAT PEACE.\" (_Kayánerenh-kowa._)  [Transcriber's note: the \"o\" in \"kowa\" is the Unicode o-macron.]   The regard of Englishmen for their Magna Charta and Bill of Rights, and that of Americans for their national Constitution, seem weak in comparison with the intense gratitude and reverence of the Five Nations for the \"Great Peace\" which Hiawatha and his colleagues established for them.  Of the subsequent life of Hiawatha, and of his death, we have no sure information.  The records of the Iroquois are historical, and not biographical.  As Hiawatha had been made a chief among the Mohawks, he doubtless continued to reside with that nation.  A tradition, which is in itself highly probable, represents him as devoting himself to the congenial work of clearing away the obstructions in the streams which intersect the country then inhabited by the confederated nations, and which formed the chief means of communication between them.  That he thus, in some measure, anticipated the plans of De Witt Clinton and his associates, on a smaller scale, but with perhaps a larger statesmanship, we may be willing enough to believe.  A wild legend, recorded by some writers, but not told of him by the Canadian Iroquois, and apparently belonging to their ancient mythology, gives him an apotheosis, and makes him ascend to heaven in a white canoe.  It may be proper to dwell for a moment on the singular complication of mistakes which has converted this Indian reformer and statesman into a mythological personage.  When by the events of the Revolutionary war the original confederacy was broken up, the larger portion of the people followed Brant to Canada. The refugees comprised nearly the whole of the Mohawks, and the greater part of the Onondagas and Cayugas, with many members of the other nations.  In Canada their first proceeding was to reëstablish, as far as possible, their ancient league, with all its laws and ceremonies.  The Onondagas had brought with them most of their wampum records, and the Mohawks jealously preserved the memories of the federation, in whose formation they had borne a leading part.  The history of the league continued to be the topic of their orators whenever a new chief was installed into office.  Thus the remembrance of the facts has been preserved among them with much clearness and precision, and with very little admixture of mythological elements.  With the fragments of the tribes which remained on the southern side of the Great Lakes the case was very different.  Except among the Senecas, who, of all the Five Nations, had had least to do with the formation of the league, the ancient families which had furnished the members of their senate, and were the conservators of their history, had mostly fled to Canada or the West.  The result was that among the interminable stories with which the common people beguile their winter nights, the traditions of Atotarho and Hiawatha became intermingled with the legends of their mythology.  An accidental similarity, in the Onondaga dialect, between the name of Hiawatha and that of one of their ancient divinities, led to a confusion between the two, which has misled some investigators.  This deity bears, in the sonorous Mohawk tongue, the name of Aronhiawagon, meaning \"the Holder of the Heavens.\"  The early French missionaries, prefixing a particle, made the name in their orthography, Tearonhiaouagon.  He was, they tell us, \"the great god of the Iroquois.\"  Among the Onondagas of the present day, the name is abridged to Taonhiawagi, or Tahiawagi.  The confusion between this name and that of Hiawatha (which, in another form, is pronounced Tayonwatha) seems to have begun more than a century ago; for Pyrlaeus, the Moravian missionary, heard among the Iroquois (according to Heckewelder) that the person who first proposed the league was an ancient Mohawk, named Thannawege.  Mr. J. V. H. Clark, in his interesting History of Onondaga, makes the name to have been originally Ta-oun-ya-wat-ha, and describes the bearer as \"the deity who presides over fisheries and hunting-grounds.\"  He came down from heaven in a white canoe and after sundry adventures, which remind one of the labors of Hercules, assumed the name of Hiawatha (signifying, we are told, \"a very wise man\"), and dwelt for a time as an ordinary mortal among men, occupied in works of benevolence.  Finally, after founding the confederacy and bestowing many prudent counsels upon the people, he returned to the skies by the same conveyance in which he had descended. This legend was communicated by Clark to Schoolcraft, when the latter was compiling his \"Note"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22601"],["title","Hiawatha and the Iroquois Confederation (#4)"],["body","on the Iroquois.\"  Mr. Schoolcraft, pleased with the poetical cast of the story and the euphonious name, made confusion worse confounded by transferring the hero to a distant region and identifying him with Manabozho, a fantastic divinity of the Ojibways.  Schoolcraft's volume, absurdly entitled \"The Hiawatha Legends,\" has not in it a single fact or fiction relating either to Hiawatha himself or to the Iroquois deity Aronhiawagon.  Wild Ojibway stories concerning Manabozho and his comrades form the staple of its contents.  But it is to this collection that we owe the charming poem of Longfellow; and thus, by an extraordinary fortune, a grave Iroquois lawgiver of the fifteenth century has become, in modern literature, an Ojibway demigod, son of the West Wind, and companion of the tricksy Paupukkeewis, the boastful Iagoo, and the strong Kwasind.  If a Chinese traveller, during the middle ages, inquiring into the history and religion of the western nations, had confounded King Alfred with King Arthur, and both with Odin, he would not have made a more preposterous confusion of names and characters than that which has hitherto disguised the genuine personality of the great Onondaga reformer.  About the main events of his history, and about his character and purposes, there can be no reasonable doubt.  We have the wampum belts which he handled, and whose simple hieroglyphics preserve the memory of the public acts in which he took part.  We have, also, in the Iroquois \"Book of Rites,\" a still more clear and convincing testimony to the character both of the legislator and of the people for whom his institutions were designed.  This book, sometimes called the \"Book of the Condoling Council,\" might properly enough be styled an Iroquois Veda.  It comprises the speeches, songs and other ceremonies, which, from the earliest period of the confederacy, have composed the proceedings of their council when a deceased chief is lamented and his successor is installed in office.  The fundamental laws of the league, a list of their ancient towns, and the names of the chiefs who constituted their first council, chanted in a kind of litany, are also comprised in the collection.  The contents, after being preserved in memory, like the Vedas, for many generations, were written down by desire of the chiefs, when their language was first reduced to writing; and the book is therefore more than a century old.  Its language, archaic when written, is now partly obsolete, and is fully understood by only a few of the oldest chiefs.  It is a genuine Indian composition, and must be accepted as disclosing the true character of its authors.  The result is remarkable enough.  Instead of a race of rude and ferocious warriors, we find in this book a kindly and affectionate people, full of sympathy for their friends in distress, considerate to their women, tender to their children, anxious for peace, and imbued with a profound reverence for their constitution and its authors.  We become conscious of the fact that the aspect in which these Indians have presented themselves to the outside world has been in a large measure deceptive and factitious.  The ferocity, craft, and cruelty, which have been deemed their leading traits, have been merely the natural accompaniments of wars of self-preservation, and no more indicated their genuine character than the war-paint, plume, and tomahawk of the warrior displayed the customary guise in which he appeared among his own people.  The cruelties of war, when war is a struggle for national existence, are common to all races. The persistent desire for peace, pursued for centuries in federal unions, and in alliances and treaties with other nations, has been manifested by few as steadily as by the countrymen of Hiawatha.  The sentiment of universal brotherhood, which directed their polity, has never been so fully developed in any branch of the Aryan race, unless it may be found incorporated in the religious quietism of Buddha and his followers.  To come back to our first proposition,--it is unquestionable that the Iroquois, when they framed the political system which exhibited this singular force of intellect and elevation of character, were a people of the Stone Age; and there is no good reason for supposing that they were superior in character and capacity to the people of the most primitive times.  What we know of them entitles us to affirm that the makers of the earliest flint implements may have been equal, if not superior, in natural powers to the members of any existing race.  And as language is the outgrowth and image of the mental faculties, it is not impossible, or even unlikely, that among the languages spoken by the people of those early ages, there may have been some as far superior in construction and power of expression to any tongue of modern Europe, as the languages of the barbarous Greeks and Germans, a thousand years before the Christian era, were superior to the speech of the highly civilized Egyptians.  The conclusions to which these facts and reasonings point are of great scientific importance.  As there could be no sound astronomy while the notion prevailed that the earth was the centre of the universe, and no science of history while each nation looked with contempt upon every other people, so we can hope for no complete and satisfying science of man and of human speech until our minds are disabused of those other delusions of self-esteem which would persuade us that superior culture implies superior capacity, and that the particular race and language which we happen to claim as our own are the best of all races and languages.
