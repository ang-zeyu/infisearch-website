Russia began the work by bringing about an agreement between Bulgaria and Servia; England completed it by bringing Greece into the League.  There ensued a local, which, in accordance with the old diplomatic prophecy, was soon to lead to the universal conflagration.  Organized as she was, Greece succeeded better than anyone expected; and the national gratitude--the exuberant gratitude of a Southern people--went out to the two men directly responsible for that success: to King Constantine, whose brilliant generalship beat the enemy hosts; and to M. Venizelos, whose able statesmanship had prepared the field.  Poets and pamphleteers vied with each other in expatiating on the wonders they had performed, to the honour and advantage of their country.  In this ecstasy of popular adoration the spirit of the soldier and the spirit of the lawyer seemed to have met.  But the union was illusive and transient.  Between these two men, so strangely flung together by destiny, there existed no link of sympathy; and propinquity only forced the growth of their mutual antagonism.  The seeds of discord had already borne fruit upon the common ground of their Balkan exploits.  Immediately after the defeat of Turkey a quarrel over the spoils arose among the victors.  King Constantine, bearing in mind Bulgaria's long-cherished dream of hegemony, and persuaded that no sacrifices made by Greece and Servia could do more than defer a rupture, urged a Graeco-Servian alliance against their truculent partner.  He looked at the matter from a purely Greek standpoint and was anxious to secure the maximum of profit for his country.  M. Venizelos, on the other hand, aware that the Western Powers, and particularly England, wanted a permanent Balkan coalition as a barrier against Germany in the East, and anxious to retain those Powers' favour, was prepared to concede {6} much for the sake of averting a rupture.  Not until the Bulgars betrayed their intentions by actual aggressions in Macedonia did he withdraw his opposition to the alliance with Servia, which ushered in the Second Balkan War and led to the Peace of Bucharest.  He yielded to the pressure of the circumstances brought to bear upon him; but the encounter represented no more than the preliminary crossing of swords between two strong antagonists.     {7}  CHAPTER I  From the moment when the rupture between Austria and Servia, in July, 1914, came to disturb the peace, Greece deliberately adopted an attitude of neutrality, with the proviso that she would go to Servia's assistance in case of a Bulgarian attack upon the latter.  Such an attitude was considered to be in accordance with the Graeco-Servian Alliance.  For, although the Military Convention accompanying the Treaty contained a vague stipulation for mutual support in case of war between one of the allied States and \"a third Power,\" the Treaty itself had as its sole object mutual defence against Bulgaria.[1]  In the opinion of M. Venizelos, her pact did not oblige Greece to go to Servia's assistance against Austria, but at most to mobilize 40,000 men.[2]  Treaty obligations apart, neutrality was also imposed by practical considerations.  It was to the interest of Greece--a matter of self-preservation--not to tolerate a Bulgarian attack on Servia calculated to upset the Balkan balance of power established by the Peace of Bucharest, and she was firmly determined, in concert with Rumania, to oppose such an attack with all her might.  But as to Austria, M. Venizelos had to consider whether Greece could or could not offer her ally effective aid, and after consideration he decided that she {8} should not proceed even to the mobilization of 40,000 men, for such a measure might provoke a Bulgarian mobilization and precipitate complications.  For the rest, the attitude of Greece in face of Servia's war with Austria, M. Venizelos pointed out, corresponded absolutely with the attitude which Servia had taken up in face of Greece's recent crisis with Turkey.[3]  On that occasion Greece had obtained from her ally merely moral support, the view taken being that the _casus faederis_ would arise only in the event of Bulgarian intervention.[4]  Accordingly, when the Servian Government asked if it could count on armed assistance from Greece, M. Streit, Minister for Foreign Affairs under M. Venizelos, answered that the Greek Government was convinced that it fully performed its duty as a friend and ally by adopting, until Bulgaria moved, a policy of most benevolent neutrality.  The co-operation of Greece in the war with Austria, far from helping, would harm Servia; by becoming a belligerent Greece could only offer her ally forces negligible compared with the enemy's, while she would inevitably expose Salonica, the only port through which Servia could obtain war material, to an Austrian attack; and, moreover, she would weaken her army which, in the common interest, ought to be kept intact as a check on Bulgaria.[5]  A similar communication, emphasizing the decision to keep out of the conflict, and to intervene in concert with Rumania only should Bulgaria by intervening against Servia jeopardize the _status quo_ established by the Bucharest Treaty--in which case the action of Greece would have a purely Balkan character--was made to the Greek Ministers abroad after a Council held in the Royal Palace under the presidency of the King.[6]  This policy brought King Constantine into sharp collision with one of the Central Powers, whose conceptions in regard to the Balkans had not yet been harmonized.  Vienna readily acquiesced in the Greek Government's declaration that it could not permit Bulgaria to compromise {9} the Bucharest Treaty, and since by an eventual action against Bulgaria Greece would not quarrel with Austria, the Austrian Government, on its part, promised to abstain from manifesting any solidarity with Bulgaria in the event of a Graeco-Bulgarian war.[7] Not so Berlin.  The German Emperor egotistically presumed to dictate the course which Greece should pursue, and on 31 July he invited King Constantine to join Germany, backing the invitation with every appeal to sentiment and interest he could think of.  The memory of his father, who had been assassinated, made it impossible for Constantine to favour the Servian assassins; never would Greece have a better opportunity of emancipating herself, under the protection of the Central Powers, from the tutelage which Russia aimed at exercising over the Balkan Peninsula; if, contrary to the Kaiser's expectations, Greece took the other side, she would be exposed to a simultaneous attack from Italy, Bulgaria and Turkey, and by the same token all personal relations between him and Constantine would be broken for ever.  He ended with the words: \"I have spoken frankly, and I beg you to let me know your decision without delay and with the same absolute frankness.\"  He had nothing to complain of on that score.  King Constantine on 2 August replied that, while it was not the policy of Greece to take an active part in the Austro-Servian conflict, it was equally impossible for her \"to make common cause with the enemies of the Serbs and to fall upon them, since they are our allies.  It seems to me that the interests of Greece demand an absolute neutrality and the maintenance of the _status quo_ in the Balkans such as it has been created by the Treaty of Bucharest.\"  He went on to add that Greece was determined, in concert with Rumania, to prevent Bulgaria from aggrandizing herself at the expense of Servia; if that happened, the balance in the Balkans would be upset and it would bring about the very Russian tutelage which the Kaiser feared.  \"This way of thinking,\" he concluded, \"is shared by the whole of my people.\"  What the Kaiser thought of these opinions was summed up in one word on the margin, \"Rubbish.\"  This, however, was not meant for his brother-in-law's ears.  To him he {10} used less terse language.  On 4 August he informed King Constantine through the Greek Minister in Berlin that an alliance had that day been concluded between Germany and Turkey, that Bulgaria and Rumania were similarly ranging themselves on Germany's side, and that the German men-of-war in the Mediterranean were going to join the Turkish fleet in order to act together.  Thus all the Balkan States were siding with Germany in the struggle against Slavism.  Would Greece alone stand out?  His Imperial Majesty appealed to King Constantine as a comrade, as a German Field Marshal of whom the German Army was proud, as a brother-in-law; he reminded him that it was thanks to his support that Greece was allowed to retain Cavalla; he begged him to mobilize his army, place himself by the Kaiser's side and march hand in hand against the common enemy--Slavism.  He made this urgent appeal for the last time, convinced that the King of Greece would respond to it.  If not, all would be over between the two countries--this being a slightly attenuated version of another marginal note: \"I will treat Greece as an enemy if she does not adhere at once.\"  King Constantine's answer was tactful but final: His personal sympathies and his political opinions, he said, were on the Kaiser's side.  But alas! that which the Kaiser asked him to do was completely out of the question.  Greece could not under any conceivable circumstances side against the Entente: the Mediterranean was at the mercy of the united French and British fleets, which could destroy the Greek marine, both royal and mercantile, take the Greek islands, and wipe Greece off the map.  Things being so, neutrality, he declared, was the only policy for Greece, and he ended up by meeting the Kaiser's threat with a counter-threat, none the less pointed for being veiled under the guise of an \"assurance not to touch his friends among my neighbours (i.e. Bulgaria and Turkey) as long as they do not touch our local Balkan interests.\" [8"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22677"],["title","Greece and the Allies, 1914-1922 (#3)"],["body","]  {11}  Germany did not immediately resign herself to this rebuff.  The Kaiser's Government thought King Constantine's attachment to neutrality reasonable--for the present; but at the same time urged Greece to enter as soon as possible into a secret understanding with Bulgaria and Turkey for eventual action against Servia, describing the latter country as the bear's skin of which it would be a good stroke of business for Greece to secure a share.  The German Minister at Athens, better acquainted with Greek views and feelings, took a less naïve line.  He did not want Greece to attack her ally, but was content to advise that she should free herself from the ties that bound her to Servia, and in the event of Bulgarian aggression just leave her ally in the lurch.  But, if he went less far than his chief in one direction, he went farther in another, threatening, should Greece move on Servia's behalf, to ask for his passport.  This threat, like all the others, failed to move the Athens Government;[9] and, unable to gain Greece as an ally, Germany was henceforth glad enough not to have her as an enemy.  So far all those responsible for the policy of Greece appeared to be unanimous in the decision not to be drawn prematurely into the European cataclysm, but to reserve her forces for the defence of the Balkan equilibrium.  Under this apparent unanimity, however, lay divergent tendencies.  King Constantine, a practical soldier, estimated that the European War would be of long duration and doubtful issue: in this battle of giants he saw no profit for pygmies, but only perils.  At the same time, he did not forget that Greece had in Bulgaria and Turkey two embittered enemies {12} who would most probably try to fish in the troubled waters.  If they did so, he was prepared to fight; but to fight with a definite objective and on a definite military plan which took into account the elements of time, place, and resources.  The King's standpoint was shared by most Greek statesmen and soldiers of note: they all, in varying degrees, stood for neutrality, with possible intervention on the side of the Entente at some favourable moment.  But it did not commend itself to his Premier.  Caution was foreign to M. Venizelos's ambitious and adventurous temperament. Military considerations had little meaning for his civilian mind. Taking the speedy victory of the Entente as a foregone conclusion, and imbued with a sort of mystical faith in his own prophetic insight and star, he looked upon the European War as an occasion for Imperialist aggrandizement which he felt that Greece ought to grasp without an instant's delay.  It was not long before the underlying divergence came to the surface.  In the morning of 18 August, at a full Cabinet Meeting, M. Streit mentioned that the Russian Minister had privately referred to the possibility of Greece sending 150,000 men to fight with Servia against the Austrians on the Danube--far away from the Greek Army's natural base in Macedonia.  On hearing this M. Venizelos impulsively declared that he was ready to place all the Greek forces at the disposal of the Entente Powers in accordance with their invitation.  M. Streit remonstrated that there had been no \"invitation,\" but at most a sounding from one of the Entente Ministers, which Greece should meet with a counter-sounding, in order to learn to what extent the suggestion was serious.  Further, he objected that, before Greece committed herself, it was necessary to find out where she would be expected to fight, the conditions under which she would fight, and the compensations which she would receive in the event of victory.  As a last resort he proposed to adjourn the discussion until the afternoon. But M. Venizelos answered that there was no time to lose: the War would be over in three weeks.[10]  Whereupon {13} M. Streit resigned, and M. Venizelos offered to the Entente Ministers the adhesion of Greece forthwith.  The terms in which this offer was couched have never been divulged; but from the French Minister's descriptions of it as made \"_à titre gracieux_\" and \"_sans conditions,_\" [11] it seems to have been unconditional and unqualified.  On the other hand, M. Venizelos at a later period explained that he had offered to place Greece at the disposal of the Entente Powers, if Turkey went to war with them.[12] And it is not improbable that the primary objective in his mind was Turkey, who still refused to relinquish her claims to the islands conquered by the Greeks in 1912, and had just strengthened her navy with two German units, the _Goeben_ and the _Breslau_.  However that may be, King Constantine seconded the offer, expressing himself quite willing to join the Entente there and then with the whole of his army, but stipulating, on the advice of the General Staff, that the Greek forces should not be moved to any place where they could not, if need arose, operate against Bulgaria.  The King of England telegraphed to the King of Greece, thanking him for the proposal, which, he said, his Government would consider.  The French and Russian Governments expressed lively satisfaction, France, however, adding: \"For the moment we judge that Greece must use all her efforts to make Turkey observe her promised neutrality, and to avoid anything that might lead the Turkish Government to abandon its neutrality.\"  The British answer, when it came at last, was to the same effect: England wished by all means to avoid a collision with Turkey and advised that Greece also should avoid a collision.  She only suggested for the present an understanding between the Staffs with a view to eventual action.  This suggestion was apparently a concession to Mr. Winston Churchill, who just then had formed the opinion that Turkey would join the Central Powers, and had arranged with Lord Kitchener that two officers of the Admiralty should meet two officers of the War Office to work out a plan for the seizure, by means of a Greek army, of the {14} Gallipoli Peninsula, with a view to admitting a British fleet to the Sea of Marmara.[13] But it no way affected the British Government's policy. The utmost that England and France were prepared to do in order to meet the offer of Greece, and that only if she were attacked, was to prevent the Turkish fleet from coming out of the Dardanelles; France also holding out some hope of financial assistance, but none of war material on an adequate scale.[14]  Such a reception of his advances was not very flattering to M. Venizelos--it made him look foolish in the eyes of those who had pleaded against precipitancy; and he took the earliest opportunity to vent his ill-humour.  King Constantine, in a reply to the British Admiralty drafted with Vice-Admiral Mark Kerr, stated that he would not fight Turkey unless attacked by her--a statement in strict consonance with the wishes of the Entente Powers at the time.  But M. Venizelos objected.  After his own declarations to the Entente Ministers, and after the exchange of telegrams with the King of England, he told his sovereign he did not consider this reply possible.  Turkey was their enemy, and was it wise for them to reject a chance of fighting her with many and powerful allies, so that they might eventually have to fight her single-handed?[15]  Thus M. Venizelos argued, in the face of express evidence that those allies did not desire the immediate participation of Greece in a war against Turkey--because, anxious above all things to establish close contact with them, he wanted the offer to remain open: \"a promise that, should at any time the Powers consider us useful in a war against Turkey . . . we would be at their disposal.\" [16]  And he professed himself unable to understand how a course which appeared so clear to him could possibly be obscure to others.  But he had a theory--a theory which served him henceforward as a stock explanation of every difference of opinion, and in which the political was skilfully mixed {15} with the personal factor.  According to this theory, when face to face with M. Venizelos, the King seldom failed to be convinced; but as soon as M. Venizelos withdrew, he changed his mind.  This happened not once, but many times.[17]  We have here a question of psychology which cannot be casually dismissed.  M. Venizelos's persuasive powers are notorious, and it is highly probable that King Constantine underwent the fascination which this man had for others.  But behind it all, according to the Venizelist theory, lurked another element:  \"What, I think, confuses things and begets in the mind of your Majesty and of M. Streit tendencies opposed to those supported by me, is the wish not to displease Germany by undertaking a war against Turkey in co-operation with Powers hostile to her.\"  Although M. Streit had laid down his portfolio, he continued to be consulted by the King, with the result, M. Venizelos complained, that the difference of opinions between the ex-Minister for Foreign Affairs and himself was fast developing into a divergence of courses between the Crown and the Cabinet: such a state of things was obviously undesirable, and M. Venizelos, \"in order to facilitate the restoration of full harmony between the Crown and its responsible advisers,\" offered his resignation.[18]  M. Venizelos did not resign after all.  But his letter marks an epoch none the less.  At first, as we have seen, the avowed policy of the Premier, of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and of the King was the same.  The difference which now emerges is that M. Venizelos desired to throw Greece into the War immediately, without conditions and without any invitation from the Entente, while the King and M. Streit were more circumspect.  M. Venizelos chose to interpret their circumspection as prompted by regard for Germany, and did not hesitate to convey this view to Entente quarters.  It was, perhaps, a plausible insinuation, since the King had a German wife and M. Streit was of German descent. But, as a matter of"]]]
