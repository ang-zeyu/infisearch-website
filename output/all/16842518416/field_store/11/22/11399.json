To Bootsey's mind the baby presented a great variety of psychological and other problems. He wondered what could be the mental operation that caused it to kink its nose in that amazing manner, why it should manifest such a persistent desire to swallow its fist, what could be the particular woe and grievance that suddenly possessed its little soul and moved it to pucker up its mouth and yell as though it saw nothing but despair as its earthly portion?  Bootsey had debated these and similar questions until two beats upon the clock warned him that, even upon the most liberal calculation, the noonday hour must be looked upon as gone. Then he rolled the baby up in one corner of the box and started back to the office.  It was Mr. Absalom Jayres's office to which Bootsey's way tended, and a peculiarity about it that had impressed both Mr. Jayres and Bootsey was that Bootsey could perform a given distance of which it was the starting-point in at least one-tenth the time required to perform the same distance of which it was the destination. This was odd, but true.  After taking leave of the baby and locking it in, all snugly smothered at the bottom of its dry-goods box, Bootsey delivered the key of the room to Mrs. Maguinness and descended into the court. Here he found two other boys involved in a difficulty. Things had gone so far that Bootsey saw it would be a waste of time to try to ascertain the merits of the controversy--his only and obvious duty being to hasten the crisis.  \"Hi! Shunks!\" he cried, \"O'll betcher Jakey kin lick ye!\"  The rapidity with which this remark was followed by offensive movements on Shunks's part proved how admirably it had been judged.  \"Kin he!\" screamed Shunks. \"He's nawfin' but a Sheeny two-fer!\"  Jakey needed no further provocation, and with great dexterity he crowded his fists into Shunks's eyes, deposited his head in Shunks's stomach, and was making a meritorious effort to climb upon Shunks's shoulders, when a lordly embodiment of the law's majesty hove gracefully into sight. Bootsey yelled a shrill warning, and himself set the example of flight.  While passing under the Brooklyn Bridge Bootsey met a couple of Chinamen, and moved by a sudden inspiration he grabbed the cue of one of them, and both he and the Chinaman precipitately sat down. Bootsey recovered quickly and in a voice quivering with rage he demanded to know what the Chinaman had done that for. A large crowd immediately assembled and lent its interest to the solution of this question. It was in vain that the Chinaman protested innocence of any aggressive act or thought. The crowd's sympathies were with Bootsey, and when he insisted that the Mongol had tangled him up in his pig-tail, the aroused populace with great difficulty restrained its desire to demolish the amazed heathens. At last, however, they were permitted to go, followed by a rabble of urchins, and Bootsey proceeded on his way to the office.  [Illustration: HE GRABBED THE CUE OF ONE OF THEM.]  Many other interruptions retarded his progress. He had not gone far before he was invited into a game of ball, and this, of course, could not be neglected. The game ending in a general conflict of the players, caused by Bootsey's falling on top of another boy, whom he utterly refused to let up unless it should be admitted that the flattened unfortunate was \"out,\" he issued from the turmoil in time to join in an attack upon a peanut roaster and to avail himself largely of the spoils. Enriched with peanuts, he had got as far as the City Hall Park when a drunken man attracted his attention, and he assisted actively in an effort to convince the drunken man that the Mayor's office was the ferry to Weehawken. It was while engaged in giving these disinterested assurances that he felt himself lifted off his feet by a steady pull at his ears, and looking up he beheld Mr. Jayres.  \"You unmitigated little rascal!\" cried Mr. Jayres, \"where've you been?\"  \"Nowhere,\" said Bootsey, in an injured tone.  \"Didn't I tell you to get back promptly?\"  \"Aint I a-getting' back?\"  \"Aint you a-get--whew!\" roared Mr. Jayres, with the utmost exasperation, \"how I'd like to tan your plaguey little carcass till it was black and blue! Come on, now,\" and Mr. Jayres strode angrily ahead.  Bootsey followed. He offered no reply to this savage expression, but from his safe position in the rear he grinned amiably.  Mr. Jayres was large and dark and dirty. His big fat face, shaped like a dumpling, wore a hard and ugly expression. Small black eyes sat under his low, expansive forehead. His cheeks and chin were supposed to be shaven, and perhaps that experience may occasionally have befallen them. His costume was antique. Around his thick neck he wore a soiled choker. His waistcoat was low, and from it protruded the front of a fluted shirt. A dark-blue swallow-tail coat with big buttons and a high collar wrapped his huge body, and over his shoulders hung a heavy mass of black hair, upon which his advanced age had made but a slight impression.  [Illustration: \"WE'VE CALLED,\" SAID THE MAN, SLOWLY.]  His office was upon the top floor of a building in Murray Street. It was a long, low room. Upon its door was fastened a battered tin sign showing the words: \"Absalom Jayres, Counsellor.\" The walls and ceiling were covered with dusty cobwebs. In one end of the room stood an old wood stove, and near it was a pile of hickory sticks. A set of shelves occupied a large portion of the wall, bearing many volumes, worn, dusty, and eaten with age.  Among them were books of the English peerage, records of titled families, reports of the Court of Chancery in hundreds of testamentary cases, scrap-books full of newspaper clippings concerning American claimants to British fortunes, lists of family estates in Great Britain and Ireland, and many other works bearing upon heraldry, the laws of inheritance, and similar subjects.  Upon the walls hung charts showing the genealogical trees of illustrious families, tracing the descent of Washington, of Queen Victoria, and of other important personages. There was no covering on the floor except that which had accumulated by reason of the absence of broom and mop. A couple of tables, a few dilapidated chairs, a pitcher and a basin, were about all the furniture that the room contained.  Being elderly and huge, it required far more time for Mr. Jayres to make the ascent to his office than for Bootsey. Having this fact in mind, Bootsey sat down upon the first step of the first flight, intending to wait until Mr. Jayres had at least reached the final flight before he started up at all. He failed to communicate his resolution, however, and when Mr. Jayres turned about upon the third floor, hearing no footsteps behind him, he stopped. He frowned. He clinched his fist and swore.  \"There'll be murder on me,\" he said, \"I know there will, if that Boy don't do better! Now, where the pestering dickens can he be?\"  Mr. Jayres leaned over the bannister and started to call. \"Boo--\" he roared, and then checked himself. \"Drat such a name as that,\" he said. \"Who ever heard of a civilized Boy being called Bootsey? What'll people think to see a man of my age hanging over a bannister yelling 'Bootsey'! No, I must go down and hunt him up. I wonder why I keep that Boy? I wonder why I do it?\"  Mr. Jayres turned, and with a heavy sigh he began to descend to the street. On the second landing he met Bootsey smoking a cigarette and whistling. Mr. Jayres did not fly into a passion. He did not grow red and frantic. He just took Bootsey by the hand and led him, step by step, up the rest of the way to the office. He drew him inside, shut the door, and led him over to his own table. Then he sat down, still holding Bootsey's hand, and waited until he had caught his breath.  \"Now, then,\" he said, at last.  \"Yez'r,\" said Bootsey.  \"You're a miserable little rogue!\" said Mr. Jayres.  Bootsey held his peace.  \"I've stood your deviltries till I've got no patience left, and now I'm going to discharge you!\"  \"Aw, don't,\" said Bootsey.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. Jayres, \"I will; if I don't, the end of it all will be murder. Some time or other I'll be seized of a passion, and there's no telling what'll happen. There's your two dollars to the end of the week--now, go!\"  \"Aw, now,\" said Bootsey, \"wot's de use? I aint done nawfin'. 'Fi gets bounced mom'll drub me awful! You said you wanted me to take a letter up to Harlem dis afternoon.\"  \"Yes, you scamp! And here's the afternoon half gone.\"  \"O'll have it dere in less 'n no time,\" pleaded Bootsey.  Mr. Jayres scowled hard at Bootsey and hesitated. But finally he drew the letter from the drawer of his table and handed it over, saying as he did so, \"If you aint back here by 5 o'clock, I'll break every bone in your body!\"  Bootsey left the office with great precipitation, and as he closed the door behind him, Mr. Jayres glared morosely at a knot-hole in the floor. \"Funny about that boy!\" he said reflectively. \"I don't know as I ever gave in to any living human being before that Boy came along in all my life.\"  Mr. Jayres turned to his table and began to write, but was almost immediately interrupted by a knock upon the door. He called out a summons to enter, and two people, a man and a woman, came in. The man was large, stolid, and rather vacant in his expression. The woman was small and quick and sharp.  \"Well, sir,\" said Mr. Jayres.  The woman poked the man and told him to speak.  \"We've called--\" said the man slowly.  \"About your advertisement in the paper,\" added the woman"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22731"],["title","Tin-Types Taken in the Streets of New York (#3)"],["body","y.  \"Which paper?\" asked Mr Jayres.  \"Where's the paper?\" asked the man, turning to the woman.  \"Here,\" she replied, producing it.  \"Oh, yes, I see,\" said Mr. Jayres, \"it's about the Bugwug estate. What is your name, sir?\"  \"His name is Tobey, and I'm Mrs. Tobey, and we keeps the Gallinipper Laundry, sir, which is in Washington Place, being a very respectable neighborhood, though the prices is low owing to competition of a party across the street.\"  \"Now, Maggie,\" said the man, \"let me talk.\"  \"Who's hindering you from talking, Tobey? I'm not, and that's certain. The gentleman wanted to know who we were, and I've told him. He'd been a week finding out from you.\"  \"Come, come,\" said Mr. Jayres sharply, \"let's get to business.\"  \"That's what I said,\" replied Mrs. Tobey, \"while I was putting on my things to come down town. 'Tobey,' says I, 'get right to business. Don't be wasting the gentleman's time,' which he always does, sir, halting and hesitating and not knowing what to say, nor ever coming to the point. 'It's bad manners,' says I, 'and what's more, these lawyers,' says I, 'which is very sharp folks, wont stand it,' says I. But I don't suppose I done him much good, for he's always been that way, sir, though I'm sure I've worked my best to spur him up. But a poor, weak woman can't do everything, though you'd think he thought so, if--\"  \"Oh, now stop, stop, stop!\" cried Mr. Jayres, \"you mustn't run on so. Your name is Tobey and you have called about the Bugwug property. Well, now, what of it?\"  \"I want to know is there any money in it,\" answered Mr. Tobey.  \"Now, if you please, sir, just listen to that,\" cried Mrs. Tobey pityingly. \"He wants to know is there money in it! Why, of course, there's money in it, Tobey. You're a dreadful trial to me, Tobey. Didn't the gentleman's advertisement say there was 500,000 pounds in it? Aint that enough? Couldn't you and me get along on 500,000 pounds, or even less, on a pinch?\"  \"But the question is,\" said Mr. Jayres, \"what claim you have on the Bugwug property. Are you descended from Timothy Bugwug, and if so, how directly and in what remove?\"  \"That's what we wants you to tell us, sir,\" replied Mr. Tobey.  \"Why, we supposed you'd have it all settled,\" added his wife. \"Aint you a lawyer?\"  \"Oh, yes, I'm a lawyer,\" Mr. Jayres suavely replied, \"and I can tell you what your claim is if I know your relationship to Timothy Bugwug. He died in 1672, leaving four children, Obediah, Martin, Ezekiel, and Sarah. Obediah died without issue. Martin and Sarah came to America, and Ezekiel was lost at sea before he had married. Now then, where do you come in?\"  \"My mother--\" said Mr. Tobey.  \"Was a Bugwug,\" said Mrs. Tobey. \"There's no doubt at all but what all that money belongs to us, and if you've got it you must pay it right away to us, for plenty of use we have for it with six young children a-growing up and prospects of another come April, which as regards me is terrible to think of, though, I suppose, I shouldn't repine, seeing that it's the Lord's will that woman should suffer, which, I must say, it seems to me that they have more than their fair share. However, I don't blame Tobey, for he's a fine man, and a hard-working one, if he hasn't got the gift of speech and is never able to come to the point, though that's not for the lack of having it dinged into his ears, for if I says it once I says it fifty times a day, 'Tobey, will you come to the point?'\"  Mr. Jayres took up his pen. \"Well, let's see,\" he said. \"What is your full name, Mr. Tobey?\"  \"William Tobey, sir. I am the son of--\"  \"Jonathan Tobey and Henrietta Bugwug,\" continued the lady, \"it being so stated in the marriage license which the minister said was for my protection, and bears the likeness of Tobey on one side and mine on the other and clasped hands in the center signifying union, and is now in the left-hand corner of the sixth shelf from the bottom in the china closet and can be produced at any time if it's needful. I've kept it very careful.\"  \"Whose daughter was Henrietta Bugwug?\" asked Mr. Jayres.  \"Tobey's grandfather's, sir, a very odd old gentleman, though blind, which he got from setting off fireworks on a Fourth of July, and nearly burned the foot off the blue twin, called blue from the color of his eyes, the other being dark-blue, which is the only way we have of telling 'em apart, except that one likes cod liver oil and the other don't, and several times when the blue twin's been sick the dark-blue twin has got all the medicine by squinting up his eyes so as I couldn't make him out and pretending it was him that had the colic, and Mr. Bugwug, that's Tobey's grandfather, lives in Harlem all by himself, because he says there's too much noise and talking in our flat, and I dare say there is, though I don't notice it.\"  \"In Harlem, eh? When did you first hear that you had an interest in the Bugwug estates?\"  \"Oh, ever so long, and we'd have had the money long ago if it hadn't been that a church burned down a long time ago somewhere in Virginia where one of the Bugwugs married somebody and all the records were lost, though I don't see what that had to do with it, because Tobey's here all ready to take the property, and it stands to reason that he wouldn't have been here unless that wedding had 'a' happened without they mean to insult us, which they'd better not, and wont, if they know when they are well off,\" and at the very thought of such a thing Mrs. Tobey tossed her head angrily.  \"I see,\" said Mr. Jayres, \"I see. And you want me to take the matter in hand, I suppose, and see if I can recover the money, eh?\"  \"Oh, dear!\" said Mrs. Tobey, in a disappointed tone, \"I thought from the piece in the paper that the money was all ready for us.\"  \"You mustn't be so impatient,\" soothingly responded Mr. Jayres, laying his fat finger on his fat cheek and smiling softly. \"All in good time. All in good time. The money's where it's safe. You only need to establish your right to it. We must fetch a suit in the Court of Chancery, and that I'll do at once upon looking up the facts. Of course--er--there'll be a little fee.\"  \"A little what?\" said Mr. Tobey.  \"A little which?\" said Mrs. Tobey.  [Illustration: \"A LITTLE FEE,\" SAID MR. JAYRES, SMILING SWEETLY.]  \"A little fee,\" said Mr. Jayres, smiling sweetly. \"A mere trifle, I assure you; just enough to defray expenses--say--er--a hundred dollars.\"  \"Oh, dear me!\" cried Mrs. Tobey. \"This is vexing. To think of coming down town, Tobey, dear, with the expectations of going back rich, and then going back a hundred dollars poorer than we were. I really don't think we'd better do it, Tobey?\"  \"Ah,\" said Mr. Jayres, \"but think also of the fortune. Two millions and a half! Isn't that worth spending a few hundred dollars for? Just put your mind on it, ma'am.\"  \"I've had my mind on it ever since I seen your piece in the paper,\" replied Mrs. Tobey, \"and a hundred dollars does seem, as you say, little enough to pay for two millions and a half, which would be all I'd ask or wish for, and would put us where we belong, Tobey, which is not in the laundry line competing with an unscrupulous party across the street, though I don't mention names, which perhaps I ought, for the public ought to be warned. It's a party that hasn't any honor at all--\"  \"I'm sure not,\" said Mr. Jayres sympathetically. \"He is, without doubt, a dirty dog.\"  \"Oh, it isn't a he,\" Mrs. Tobey replied, \"the party is a her.\"  [Illustration: \"THE PARTY IS A HER,\" SAID MRS. TOBEY.]  \"Of course, of course,\" said Mr. Jayres. \"And to think that you have to put up with the tricks of a female party directly across the street. Why, it's shameful, ma'am! But if you had that two millions, as you just observed, all that would be over.\"  \"Two million and a half I thought you said it was,\" said Mrs. Tobey rather sharply.  \"Oh, yes, and a half--and a half,\" the lawyer admitted in a tone of indifference, as much as to say that there should be no haggling about the odd $500,000. \"What a pretty pile it is, Mrs. Tobey?\"  \"I don't know, Tobey, but what we'd better do it,\" Mrs. Tobey said after a pause. \"It aint so very much when you think of what we're to get for it.\"  \"That's the right way to look at it, ma'am. I'll just draw up the receipt, and to-morrow I'll call at the Gallinipper Laundry to get some further particulars necessary to help me make out the papers.\"  Mr. Tobey seemed to be somewhat at a loss to know precisely what was the net result of the proceedings in which he had thus far taken so small a part, but upon being directed by Mrs. Tobey to produce the hundred dollars, he ventured a feeble remonstrance. This was immediately checked by Mrs. Tobey, who assured him that he knew nothing whatever about such matters and never could come to the point, which he ought to be able to do by this time, for nobody could say but that she had done her part. At last two fifty-dollar bills were deposited in Mr. Jayres's soft palm and a bit of writing was handed over to Mrs. Tobey in exchange for them; and followed by Mr. Jayres's warm insistence that they had never done a better thing in their lives, the Tobeys withdrew.  It was nearly six o'clock when the door of Mr. Jayres's office opened again and the shocky head of Bootsey appeared. Mr. Jayres was waiting for him.  \"Here you are at last, you wretched little scamp!\" he cried. \"Didn't I tell you I'd whale you if you weren't back by five o'clock?\"  \"I come jest as soon 's I could,\" said Bootsey. \"He was a werry fly ole gen'l'man.\"  \"What did he say?\"  \"He said he didn't hev no doubts but wot you was a reg'lar villyum an' swin'ler, an' cheat an' blackmailer, an' ef he had de user his eyes an' legs he'd come down yere an' han' you over ter de coppers; dat you aint smart enuff ter get no money outer him, fer he's bin bled by sich coveys like you all he's a-going ter bleed, an' dat he don't b'lieve dere is any sech ting as de Bugwug estate nohow, an' ef yer wants ter keep outen jail yer'd"]]]
