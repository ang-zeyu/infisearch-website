P.

Christine Chaine, wakeful and nervous, listening to the night sounds, found them far more distracting than any the day could produce.  Above the breathing of the three children sleeping near her in the big room, the buzz of a moth-beetle against the ceiling, and the far-off howling of jackals, she could hear something out in the garden sighing with faint, whistling sighs.  More disquieting still was a gentle, intermittent tapping on the closed and heavily barred shutters, inside which the windows stood open, inviting coolness.  She had heard that tapping every one of the three nights since she came to the farm.  The window stood to the right of her bed, and, by stretching an arm, she could have unbolted the shutters and looked out, but she would have died rather than do it.  Not that she was a coward.  But there was some sinister quality in the night noises of this old Karoo farm that weighed on her courage and paralyzed her senses.  So, instead of stirring, she lay very still in the darkness, the loud, uncertain beats of her heart adding themselves to all the other disconcerting sounds.  Mrs. van Cannan had laughed her lazy, liquid laugh when Christine spoke, the first morning after her arrival, of the tapping.  \"It was probably a stray ostrich pecking on your shutters,\" said the mistress of Blue Aloes.  \"You are strange to the Karoo, my dear.  When you have been here a month, you'll take no notice of night noises.\"  There was possibly truth in the prophecy, but Christine doubted it. There were also moments when she doubted being able to last a week out at the farm, to say nothing of a month.  That was only in the night watches, however; by day, she found it hard to imagine any circumstances so unpleasant as to induce her to leave the three little van Cannan children, who, even in so short a time, had managed to twine their fingers and their mops of bronze hair round her affections.  The tapping began again, soft and insistent.  Christine knew it was not a branch, for she had taken the trouble to ascertain; and that a stray ostrich should choose her window to peck at for three nights running seemed fantastic.  Irrelatively, one of the children murmured drowsily in sleep, and the little human sound braced the girl's nerves.  The sense of loneliness left her, giving place to courageous resolution. She forgot everything save that she was responsible for the protection of the children, and determined that the tapping must be investigated, once and for all.  Just as she was stirring, the soft sighing recommenced close to the shutters, followed by three clear taps. Christine changed her mind about getting out of bed, but she leaned toward the window on her elbow, and said, in a low voice that trembled a little:  \"Is any one there?\"  A whistling whisper answered her:  \"_Take care of the children._\"  With the words, a strangely revolting odour came stealing through the shutters.  The girl shrank back, all her fears returning.  Yet she forced herself to speak again.  \"Who is it?  What do you want?\"  \"_Mind the boy--take care of the boy,_\" sobbed the whistling voice, and again the foul odour stole into the room.  It seemed to Christine the smell of something dead and rotten and old.  She could not bear it. Hatred of it was greater than fear, and, springing from her bed, she wrestled with the bolts of the shutters.  But when she threw them open there was--nothing!  Darkness stood without like a presence, and seemed to push against the shutters, trying to enter as she hastily rebarred them.  Something was stirring in the room, too.  With hands that shook, she lit the candle and, by its gleam, discovered Roderick, the eldest child, sitting up in bed, his red-gold mop all tumbled, his eyes, full of dreams, fixed on her with a wide stare.  She crossed the room, and knelt beside him.  \"What is it, darling?\"  \"I thought my nannie was there,\" he murmured.  \"Your nannie?\" she echoed, in surprise, knowing that \"nannie\" was the common name for any black nurse who tended and waited on them.  \"But she is in bed and asleep long ago.\"  \"I don't mean _that_ one.  I mean my nannie what's dead--Sophy.\"  The girl's backbone grew chill.  She remembered hearing that the children had been always minded by an educated old Basuto woman called Sophy, who had been a devoted slave to each from birth up, and because of whose death, a few months back, a series of English governesses had come and gone at the farm.  She remembered, too, those fluty whispers that resembled no human voice.  \"Lie down, darling, and sleep,\" she said gently.  \"I will stay by you.\"  The boy did not instantly obey.  He had a whim to sit up, watching. There was no fear in his wide grey eyes, but it was uncanny to see them searching the shadows of the room and returning always, with a fixed, somnambulistic stare, to the window.  Christine had a fancy that children, with the memories of another world clinging to them, have a vision of unseen things denied to older people; and she wondered painfully what was going on in the mind behind this handsome little face.  At last, she prevailed upon him to lie down, but it was long before he slept.  Even then, she sat on, holding his hand, keeping vigil over him and the two other small sleepers.  They were lovely children.  Each head glowed red-gold upon its pillow, and each little profile was of a regularity almost classical, with the pure colouring peculiar to red-haired people.  The boy's face was well sprinkled with freckles, but five-year-old Marguerite and little Coral, of four, who were perfect little imps of mischief, had the dainty snow-pink look of daisies growing in a meadow with their faces turned up to God.  It was difficult to connect such fragrant, well-tended flowers with the whistling horror out in the darkness.  More, it was absurd, impossible. The girl decided that the whole thing was a bad nightmare which she must shake off.  The explanation of it could only be that, half asleep, she had dreamed she heard the tapping and the whispers, and smelled the evil odour.  Why should a _Thing_ come and tell her to mind the children?  \"_Mind the boy._\"  He was already minded--they were all happy and well cared for in their own home.  The boy Roderick must have been dreaming, too, and talking in his sleep.  Thus, Christine's clear English mind rejected the whole thing as an illusion, resulting from weariness and the new, strange conditions of her life.  Yet there was an Irish side to her that could not so easily dispose of the matter. She remembered with what uneasiness her nights had been haunted from the first.  How always, when the dark fell, she had sensed something uncanny, something unseen and menacing, that she could never track to its source.  But tonight the sense of hovering evil had taken definite form and direction.  It was at the children that harm was directed; the whistling, sighing words had concerned the children only.  The girl shivered again at the horrid recollection.  \"Yet anything that cares about children cannot be altogether evil,\" she thought.  That comforted her a little, but the spell of horror the night had laid upon her was not lifted until dawn came.  Then she slipped on some clothes and let herself out into the morning air.  The garden that straggled about the farm was composed of a dozen century-old oaks, a sprinkling of feathery pepper-trees, and many clumps of brilliant-blossomed cacti.  The veranda and outbuildings were heavily hung with creepers, and great barrels of begonias and geraniums stood about.  Within a few hundred yards of the house, the green and glowing cultivation stopped as abruptly as the edges of an oasis in the desert, and the Karoo began--that sweeping, high table-land, empty of all but brown stones, long white thorns, fantastically shaped clumps of prickly-pear, bare brown hills, and dried-up rivulets, and that yet is one of the healthiest and, from the farmer's point of view, wealthiest plateaux in the world.  Between the farm and the far hills arose a curious line of shroudy blue, seeming to hover round the estate, mystically encircling it, and cutting it off from the rest of the desert.  This was the century-old hedge of blue aloes which gave the farm its name.  Planted in a huge ring of many miles' circumference, the great spiked cacti, with leaves thick and flat as hide shields, and pointed as steel spears, made a barrier against cattle, ostriches, and human beings that was impassable except by the appointed gaps.  No doubt it had a beauty all its own, but beneath its fantastic, isolated blooms and leaves of Madonna blue, the gnarled roots sheltered a hundred varieties of poisonous reptiles and insects.  That is why, in Africa, no one likes blue aloes--they always harbour death.  Dawn on the Karoo more than compensates for its fearsome nights and torrid noontides.  The dew, jewelling a thousand spider-webs, the sparkling brightness of the air, the exquisite purity of the atmosphere, and grandeur of space and loneliness rimmed about by rose-tipped skies and far forget-me-not hills make a magic to catch the heart in a net from which it never quite escapes.  Christine felt this enchantment as she wandered across the veld, her eyes fixed on the hills from behind which the sun would"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22568"],["title","Blue Aloes: Stories of South Africa (#1)"],["body","emerge to fill the land with a clear, pitiless heat that turned everything curiously grey.  A dam of water reflecting pink cloud-tips lay bright and still as a sheet of steel.  The fields of lucerne, under the morning light, were softly turning from black to emerald, and beyond the aloe hedge a native kraal that was scattered on the side of a hill slowly woke to life.  A dog barked; a wisp of smoke curled between the thatched huts, and one or two blanketed figures crept from the low doors.  The simple yet secret lives of these people intrigued Christine deeply.  She knew little of Kafirs, for she had been in Africa only a few months; but the impassive silence of them behind their watching, alert eyes always fascinated her.  They said so little before their masters, the whites.  Here, for instance, was a little colony of fifty or more people living in a kraal close to their employers.  Some of them were grey-haired and had worked for a quarter of a century on the farm--the men on the land, the women at the house--yet, once their daily tasks were over, none knew what their lives were when they returned to the straggling village of palisades and low-doored huts.  Musing on these things, Christine turned at last and sauntered slowly homeward.  Everything was still very quiet, but smoke was rising from the solid farm chimneys, and, rounding the corners of some large outbuildings, she came suddenly upon more life--feathery, fantastic life of spindlelegs and fluttering wings.  Scores of baby ostriches, just released from their night shelter, were racing into the morning light, pirouetting round each other like crazy, gleesome sprites. Christine stood laughing at their fandangos and the antics of the Kafirs engaged in herding them.  A man standing near, pipe in mouth, and hands in pockets, observing the same scene, was astonished that her sad yet passionate face could so change under the spell of laughter. He had wondered, when he first saw her, why a girl with such ardent eyes should wear such weariness upon her lips and look so disdainfully at life.  Now he saw that it was a mask she wore and forgot when she was alone, and he wondered still more what had brought such a girl to be a governess on a Karoo farm.  But in a moment Christine's face changed, resuming, like a veil over its youth and bloom, the look of world-weariness.  She bowed slightly to him, with a somewhat cool response to his pleasant morning greeting, and made haste to resume her walk homeward.  She knew him to be Richard Saltire, the government forest and land expert, who was engaged in certain experiments on the farm.  He shared a bungalow somewhere on the land with two young Hollanders who were learning ostrich-farming, and came with them to lunch every day at the house.  Already, his bold, careless face, with its sunbitten beauty, had separated itself in her memory from the faces of the other men, for it was a face and personality that could not leave a woman undisturbed. Incidentally, it had disturbed her in connection with an impression not altogether agreeable.  One of the first hints Mrs. van Cannan had given the new governess was that the master of Blue Aloes did not care for any kind of intimacy to exist between the womenfolk of the farm and the men occupied about it. Christine had been long enough in South Africa to recognize that this was an odd departure from the general rule of friendliness and equality; but a hint to the proud has the same efficacy as a word to the wise.  Besides, she had no longing for the society of men, but rather a wish to forget that she had ever known any.  Life had made a hole in her heart which she meant to fill if she could, but only with inanimate things and the love of children.  So that Mr. van Cannan's unsociable restriction, far from being irksome, suited her perfectly.  Mrs. van Cannan apparently did not apply to herself her husband's injunction, for she was charming to everybody, and especially to Mr. Saltire.  It was impossible not to notice this, and also that the fact was not lost upon the gloomy, fanatic glance of the master of the house.  If Mr. Saltire showed bad taste in so openly returning Mrs. van Cannan's interest, it had to be admitted that it was the form of bad taste that is a law unto itself and takes no thought of the opinion of others.  Although Africa had spoiled Saltire's complexion, it was evident that she had never bowed his neck or put humility into his eye or made him desist from looking over his boldly cut nose as though he had bought the world and did not want it.  But to Christine Chaine it seemed that to cause pain to a man racked with neuritis and jealousy for the sake of a mild flirtation with a pretty woman was a cruel as well as a dangerous game.  That was one of the reasons why the friendliness of his morning greeting had been met with such coldness.  She had known heartlessness before in her life, and wished no further acquaintance with it.  That was the resolution with which she hurried back through the straggling garden, the whitewashed porch, and massive front door to the nursery.  The children, full of high spirits and wilfulness, were engaged in their morning romp of trying to evade Meekie, the colored \"nannie,\" whose business it was to bathe them.  They were extraordinarily lovable children, in spite of a certain elf-like disobedience which possessed them like a disease.  It was quite enough to tell them not to do a thing for them to be eaten up with a desire to do it forthwith.  Christine had discovered this, and had learned to manage them in other ways than by direct command.  \"Take Roddy--no; take Coral, she is the dirtiest--no, no--Rita!  Rita is the pig!\" they shrieked, as they pranced from bed to bed.  \"Bathe yourself, old Meekie--you are the blackest of all.\"  Christine had her work cut out with them for the next half-hour, but at last they were marshalled, sweet and shining, to breakfast, where she presided, for their father always took an early breakfast, and Mrs. van Cannan never rose until eleven.  Afterward, according to custom, they paid a visit to the latter's room, to wish her good-morning.  Isabel van Cannan was a big, lazy, laughing woman, with sleepy, golden eyes.  She spent hours in bed, lying, as she did now, amid quantities of pillows, doing absolutely nothing.  She had told Christine that she was of Spanish extraction, yet she was blond as a Swede.  Her hair, which had a sort of lamb's-wool fluffiness, lay upon her pillows in two great ropes, yellow as the pollen of a lily.  She took the children one by one into a sleepy embrace, kissed and patted their cheeks, admonishing them to be good and obey Miss Chaine in everything.  \"Be sure not to go in the sun without your hats,\" she adjured the two small girls.  \"Roddy doesn't matter so much, but little girls' complexions are very important.\"  Rita and Coral stuck out their rose-pink chins and exchanged a sparkling glance.  Christine knew that she would have trouble with them and their hats all day.  \"Good-bye,\" said Mrs. van Cannan, and sank back among her pillows.  As the children scampered out of the room, she called sharply, \"Don't go near the dam, Roddy!\"  Christine had heard her say that before, and always with that sharp inflection.  \"I never let them go near the dam without me,\" she said reassuringly. Mrs. van Cannan did not answer, but a quiver, as if of pain, passed over her closed eyelids.  Outside in the passage, Roderick pressed close to Christine and murmured, with a sort of elfin sadness:  \"Carol was drowned in the dam.\"  The girl was startled.  \"Carol?\" she echoed.  \"Who was Carol?\"  \"My big brother--a year older than me,\" he whispered.  \"He is buried out in the graveyard.  I'll take you to see the place if you like.  Let us go now.\"  Christine collected herself.  \"We must go to lessons now, dear.  Later on, you shall show me anything you like.\"  But from time to time during the morning, sitting in the creeper-trimmed summer-house they used for a school-room, with her charges busy round her, Christine's thoughts returned to the strange little revelation.  Roddy, with his red-gold brush of hair, bent over his slate, was not the first-born, then!  _He_ had been drowned in the dam--that peaceful sheet of walled-in water that reflected the pink tips of dawn and wherein, at eventide, the cattle waded happily to drink.  This old Karoo farmhouse had known tragedy, even as she had sensed.  Small wonder Bernard van Cannan's eyes wore a haunted look! Yet his wife, with her full happy laugh and golden locks, lying among her pillows, seemed curiously untouched by sorrow.  Except for that quiver of the eyelids, Christine had never seen her show anything but a contented face to life.  Well--the history of Blue Aloes was a sealed book when the girl came to it, knowing nothing of its inmates beyond their excellent references as an old Huguenot family.  Now the book, slowly opening page by page, was revealing strange things.  The luncheon-hour always provided fresh material for a reflective mind. The dining-room was large and lofty, and the table must have dated back to the early days at the Cape, when every great family had its scores of retainers and slaves.  It was composed of time-stained teak, and could have seated dozens, being curiously shaped like a capital E with the middle branch of the letter missing.  Only one of the branches was now in use, and at this Christine presided over her small charges, fortunately somewhat aloof from the rest, for they had many odd habits which it was her business to correct without drawing attention.  Coral did not like pumpkin, and would keep dropping it on the floor.  Rita loved to kill flies with a spoon.  Roddy's specialty was sliding bits of meat into the open jaws of a pointer--there were always several under the table--then briskly passing his plate for more.  Once or twice, looking up from correcting these idiosyncrasies, the girl found the blue"]]]
