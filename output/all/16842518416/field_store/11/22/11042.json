Then we saw the balloon rise a little, like a bird freed of burden; but it suddenly collapsed, fluttered downward, and the mists leaped up and clutched it like a thousand exulting demons, dragging it down from our sight. We crawled up from the rocks, but it was a close call--a close call.\"  He lay exhausted, his eyes closed, his hand ceasing to fumble beneath the straw. Once more Professor Scotch gave him a little of the brandy.  Frank Merriwell was more than interested; he could feel his heart trembling with excitement. Something seemed to tell him that this man was speaking the truth, and he was eager to hear more.  For a long time the unfortunate lay gasping painfully for breath, but, at last, he was easier. He opened his eyes, and saw Frank watching him steadily, with an anxious expression.  \"Ah!\" he murmured, exultantly, \"you believe me--you do not doubt! I must tell you everything. You shall be Jack Burk's heir. Think of it--heir to wealth enough to make you richer than Monte Cristo! Witness--witness that I make this boy my heir!\"  He turned to the professor and Hans, and both bowed, the former saying:  \"We are witnesses.\"  \"Good! We escaped with our lives, but we brought little of the treasure with us. I was determined to find the way back there, and I made a map. See, here it is.\"  He thrust a soiled and crumpled piece of paper into Frank's hand, and the boy saw there were lines and writing on it.  \"How we found our way out of the mountains, how we endured the heat of the desert I cannot tell,\" went on the weak voice of the man on the bed of straw. \"We reached Zacatecas, and then Bushnell went for another balloon. He knows friends who have money and power, and he will get the balloon--if he lives.\"  \"But the proof--the proof that you were going to show us?\"  \"It is here! Look!\"  From beneath the straw Jack Burk drew forth a queer little figure of solid gold--a figure like the pictures of Aztec gods, which Frank had seen.  \"This is proof!\" declared the man. \"It is some of the treasure we brought from the palace. Bushnell took the rest.\"  The professor excitedly grasped the little image, and gazed searchingly at it.  \"It is all right--it is genuine!\" he finally exclaimed.  \"Of course it is genuine!\" said the man on the bed of grass. \"And there are more in the Silver Palace. There the treasures of the Aztecs were hidden, and they have remained. The country all around is full of fierce natives, who hold the palace in awe and prevent others from reaching it. They have kept the secret well, but----\"  \"Vot vos dot?\" interrupted Hans.  At some distance on the plain outside the hut were wildly galloping horses, for they could hear hoof-beats and loud cries. Then came a fusillade of pistol shots!   [Illustration: \"Frank began shooting, and his first bullet brought down one of the ponies of the pursuers.\" (See page 14)]     CHAPTER II.  GONE.   \"Bandits!\" cried Jack Burk. \"It may be Pacheco!\"  \"Pacheco?\" questioned Frank.  \"Pacheco, the human hawk! He haunts the mountains and the desert. He pursued us across the desert, but we escaped him. I have been in hiding here to avoid him. He believes we brought much treasure from the mountains.\"  The professor had leaped to the door, and was looking away on the plain. Now he cried, excitedly:  \"Look here! A band of horsemen pursuing a white man--plainly an American. Look, he is shooting again!\"  Once more the shots were heard.  Frank ran to the door, catching up a rifle that had been leaning against the wall of the hut, for he knew he was in a \"bad man's land.\"  \"Stand aside!\" he shouted, forcing his way past the professor. \"No countryman of mine can be in danger that I do not try to give him a helping hand.\"  \"What do you mean to do?\"  \"Get a crack at those Greasers.\"  \"You are crazy! You will bring the entire band down on us!\"  \"Let 'em come! One Yankee is good for six Greasers.\"  Past the hut at a distance a single horseman was riding, hotly spurring the animal which bore him. At least a dozen dark-faced, fierce-looking ruffians, mounted on hardy little ponies, were in pursuit.  As Professor Scotch had said, the fugitive was plainly an American, a native of the United States. He had turned in the saddle to send bullets whistling back at his pursuers.  Frank ran out and dropped on one knee. The professor followed him, and Hans came from the hut.  Just as Frank lifted the rifle to his shoulder and was on the point of shooting, the voice of Jack Burk sounded from the doorway, to which he had dragged himself:  \"It is Bushnell, my partner! Al! Al! Al Bushnell!\"  His voice was faint and weak, and it did not reach the ears of the man out on the plain.  Then Frank began shooting, and his first bullet brought down one of the ponies of the pursuers, sending a bandit rolling over and over in the dust, to leap up like a cat, and spring behind a comrade on the back of another pony.  \"Dot peen britty goot, Vrankie,\" complimented Hans Dunnerwust.  Again and again Frank fired, and the bandits quickly swerved away from the hut, feeling their ponies sway or fall beneath them.  In an astonishingly brief space of time the course of pursuit was deflected, giving the fugitive a chance to get away into Mendoza, which lay at a distance of about three miles from the hut.  The man in flight heard the shots, saw the figures in front of the hut, and waved his hand to them.  The professor excitedly beckoned for Bushnell to come to the hut, but the horseman did not seem to understand, and he kept straight on toward the town.  \"Confound him!\" exploded the professor. \"Why didn't he come?\"  \"He don'd like a trap to run into,\" said Hans.  \"But there is no trap here.\"  \"How he known dot?\"  \"Well, I don't know as I blame him. Of course he could not be sure it was not a trap, and so he was cautious.\"  Frank was calmly refilling the magazine of the rifle with fresh cartridges.  \"Why you didn't shoot some uf der pandits deat, Vrankie?\" asked Hans.  \"I do not wish to shed human blood if I can avoid it.\"  \"You don't done dot uf you shoot six or elefen uf dose togs.\"  \"Oh, they are human beings.\"  \"Don't you belief me? Dey vos volves--kiotes.\"  \"Well, I did not care to shoot them if I could aid the man in any other way, and I succeeded. See, they have given up the pursuit, and the fugitive is far away in that little cloud of dust.\"  \"Frank!\"  \"Yes, professor.\"  \"We should follow him, and bring him back to his dying partner.\"  \"And leave Jack Burk here alone--possibly to die alone?\"  \"We can't do that.\"  \"Of course not.\"  \"What then?\"  \"We'll have to consider the matter. But Burk---- Look--see there, professor! He is flat on his face in the doorway! He fell like that after trying to shout to his partner.\"  Frank leaped forward, and turned the man on his back. It was a drawn, ghastly face that the trio gazed down upon.  Professor Scotch quickly knelt beside the motionless form, feeling for the pulse, and then shaking his head gravely.  \"What is it?\" anxiously asked Frank. \"Has he----\"  He was silent at a motion from the professor, who bent to listen for some movement of the man's heart.  After a few seconds, Professor Scotch straightened up, and solemnly declared:  \"This is the end for him. We can do nothing more.\"  \"He is dead?\"  \"Yes.\"  There was an awed hush.  \"Now we can leave him,\" the professor finally said. \"Pacheco, the bandit, cannot harm him now.\"  They lifted the body and bore it back to the wretched bed of straw, on which they tenderly placed it.  \"The idol--the golden image?\" said the professor. \"You must not forget that, Frank. You have it?\"  \"Little danger that I shall forget it. It is here, where it fell from my fingers as I ran out.\"  He picked up the image, and placed it in one of his pockets.  Then, having covered the face of Jack Burk with his handkerchief, Frank led the way from the hut.  Their horses had been tethered near at hand, and they were soon mounted and riding away toward Mendoza.  The sun beat down hotly on the plain of white sand, and the sky was of a bright blue, such as Frank had never seen elsewhere.  Outside Mendoza was a narrow canal, but a few feet in width, and half filled with water, from which rose little whiffs of hot steam.  Along the side of the canal was a staggering rude stone wall, fringed with bushes in strips and clumps.  Beyond the canal, which fixed the boundary of the plain of sand, through vistas of tree trunks, could be seen glimpses of brown fields, fading away into pale pink, violet, and green.  The dome and towers of a church rose against the dim blue; low down, and on every side were spots of cream-white, red, and yellow, with patches of dark green intervening, revealing bits of the town, with orange groves all about.  Across the fields ran a road that was ankle deep with dust, and along the road a string of burros, loaded with great bundles of green fodder, were crawling into the town.  An undulating mass of yellow dust finally revealed itself as a drove of sheep, urged along by peons, appeared.  Groups of natives were strolling in both directions, seeking the shadows along the canal. The women were in straw hats, with their black hair plaited, and little children strung to their backs; the men wore serapes and sandals, and smoked cigarettes.  Along the side of the canal were scattered scores of natives of all ages and both sexes, lolling beneath the bushes or soaking their bodies in the water, while their heads rested on the ground.  Those stretched in the shadow of the bushes had taken their bath, and were waiting for their bodies to dry, covered simply by serapes.  From beneath such a covering dark-eyed native girls stared curiously at the passing trio, causing Hans no small amount of confusion.  \"I say, Vrankie,\" said the Dutch boy, \"vot you dinks apoudt dot pusiness uf dakin' a path in bublic mit der roadt beside?\"  \"It seems to be the custom of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22424"],["title","Frank Merriwell Down South (#2)"],["body"," country,\" smiled Frank; \"and they do not seem to think it at all improper.\"  \"Vell, somepody better toldt dem to stob id. Id keeps mein plood mein face in so much dot I shall look like you hat peen drinking.\"  \"They think nothing of it,\" explained the professor. \"You will notice with what deftness they disrobe, slipping out of their clothes and into the water without exposing much more than a bare toe.\"  \"Oxcuse you!\" fluttered Hans. \"I don'd like to took mein chances py looking. Somepody mighd make a misdake.\"  The sun was low down as they rode into the town.  \"We have no time to lose,\" said Frank. \"We must move lively, if we mean to return to the hut before nightfall.\"  \"That's right,\" nodded Professor Scotch.  They were successful in finding a native undertaker, but the fellow was very lazy, and he did not want to do anything till the next day.  \"To-morrow, señors, to-morrow,\" he said.  That did not satisfy, however, and he was soon aroused by the sight of money. Learning where the corpse was, he procured a cart and a burro, and they again set out along the road.  They found whole families soaking in groups in the canal, sousing their babies in the water, and draining them on the bank.  Young Indian girls in groups were combing out their hair and chatting merrily among themselves and with friends in the water.  \"Dere oughter peen some law for dot,\" muttered Hans.  Leaving the canal, they set out upon the sand-plain, the undertaker's burro crawling along at an aggravating pace, its master refusing to whip it up, despite urging.  The sun had set, and darkness was settling in a blue haze on the plain when the hut was reached.  Frank lighted a pocket lamp he always carried, and entered.  A cry of astonishment broke from his lips.  \"Professor! professor!\" he called; \"the body is gone!\"     CHAPTER III.  HELD FOR RANSOM.   \"Gone!\"  The professor was astonished.  \"Shimminy Gristmas! I don'd toldt you dot!\" came from Hans Dunnerwust.  \"Yes, gone,\" repeated Frank, throwing the light about the room and finally bringing it back to the bed of grass.  \"But--but it's impossible.\"  \"Impossible or not, it is true, as you may see.\"  \"But the man was dead--as dead as he could be!\"  \"Yah!\" snorted Hans. \"Py shingoes! dot peen der trute. Dot man vos teader as a goffin nail, und don'd you vorget him!\"  The trio were silent, staring in stupefied amazement at the bed of grass.  An uncanny feeling began to creep over Frank, and it seemed that a chill hand touched his face and played about his temples.  Hans' teeth began to chatter.  \"I am quite ill,\" the professor faintly declared, in a feeble tone of voice. \"The exertions of the day have been far too severe for me.\"  \"Yah, yah!\" gurgled the Dutch lad. \"You vos anodder. Oxcuse me while I go oudt to ged a liddle fresh air.\"  He made a bolt for the open door, and Professor Scotch was not long in following. Frank, however, was determined to be thoroughly satisfied, and he again began looking for the body of the dead man, once more going over the entire hut.  \"The body is gone, beyond a doubt,\" he finally muttered.  \"There is no place for it to be concealed here, and dead men do not hide themselves.\"  He went out, and found Professor Scotch and Hans awaiting his appearance with no small amount of anxiety.  \"Ah!\" said the professor, with a deep breath of relief, \"you are all right.\"  \"All right,\" said Frank, with amusement; \"of course I am. What did you think? Fancy I was going to be spirited away by spooks?\"  The little man drew himself up with an assumption of great dignity.  \"Young man,\" he rumbled, in his deepest tone, \"don't be frivolous on such an occasion as this. You are quite aware that I do not believe in spooks or anything of the sort; but we are in a strange country now, and strange things happen here.\"  \"Yah,\" nodded Hans. \"Dot peen oxactly righdt.\"  \"For instance, the disappearance of that corpse is most remarkable.\"  \"Dot peen der first dime I nefer known a deat man to ged ub un valk avay all alone mit himseluf by,\" declared Hans.  \"What do you think has happened here, professor?\" asked Frank.  \"It is plain Jack Burk's body is gone.\"  \"Sure enough.\"  \"And does it not seem reasonable that he walked away himself?\"  \"Vell, you don'd know apout dot,\" broke in Hans. \"Maype he don'd pelief we vos goin' pack here to bury him, und he got tiret uf vaiting for der funerals.\"  \"There must have been other people here after we left,\" said Frank.  \"Right,\" nodded the professor.  \"Bandits?\"  \"Bushnell?\"  \"One or the other.\"  \"Perhaps both.\"  Frank fell to examining the ground for \"signs,\" but, although his eyes were unusually keen, he was not an expert in such matters, and he discovered nothing that could serve as a revelation.  \"The man was dead beyond a doubt, professor--you are sure?\"  \"Sure?\" roared the little man, bristling in a moment. \"Of course I'm sure! Do you take me for a howling idiot?\"  \"Don't get excited, professor. The best of us are liable to err at times. It would not be strange if you----\"  \"But I didn't--I tell you I didn't! The body may have been removed by the bandits which hang about this section.\"  \"Or by Al Bushnell, Burk's partner.\"  \"Yes; Bushnell may have recognized him, although he did not seem to do so. In that case, he has been here----\"  \"And that explains everything.\"  \"Everything.\"  \"He took the body away to give it decent burial.\"  \"And we have had our trouble for nothing.\"  By this time the native undertaker got the drift of the talk, and set up a wail of lamentation and accusation. He had come all that distance at great expense to himself and great waste of time during which he might have been sleeping or smoking. It was robbery, robbery, robbery. It was like the _Americanoes_. He had a wife and many--very many children depending on him. He had been tricked by the _Americanoes_, and he would complain that he had been cheated. They should be arrested; they should be compelled to pay.  \"Oh, come your perch off, und gone took a fall to yournseluf!\" cried Hans, in disgust. \"You gif me der lifer gomblaint!\"  The native continued to wail and lament and accuse them until Frank succeeded in quieting him by paying him three times as much as he would have asked had the body been found in the hut. The old fellow saw how he could make it appear as a clean case of deception on the part of the strangers, and he worked his little game for all there was in it. Having received his money, he lost no time in turning his cart about and heading back toward Mendoza, evidently fearing the body might be found at last and forced upon him.  \"We'd better be going, too,\" said Professor Scotch.  \"That's right,\" agreed Frank. \"There is no telling what danger we may encounter on the plain after nightfall.\"  \"Vell, don'd let us peen all nighd apout gedding a mofe on,\" fluttered Hans, hastening toward the horses.  So they mounted and rode away toward Mendoza, although Frank was far from satisfied to do so without solving the mystery of the remarkable disappearance.  Darkness was falling heavily on the plain, across which a cool and refreshing breath came from the distant mountains.  Frank kept his eyes open for danger, more than half expecting to run upon a gang of bandits at any moment. As they approached the town they began to breathe easier, and, before long, they were riding along the dusty road that led into the little town.  Entering Mendoza they found on each hand low buildings connected by long, white adobe walls, against which grew prickly pears in abundance, running in straggling lines away out upon the open country.  About the edges of the town were little fires, winking redly here and there, with earthen pots which were balanced on smoldering embers raked out from the general mass.  Withered and skinny old hags were crooning over the pots, surrounded by swarthy children and lazy men, who were watching the preparation of the evening meal.  Groups of peons, muffled to the eyes with their serapes, were sitting with their backs to the adobe walls, apparently fast asleep; but Frank noted that glittering, black eyes peered out from between the serapes and the huts, and he had no doubt but that many of the fellows would willingly cut a throat for a ridiculously small sum of money.  Within the town it was different. All day the window shutters had been closely barred, but now they were flung wide, and the flash of dark eyes or the low, musical laugh of a señorita told that the maidens who had lolled all the hot day were now astir.  Doors were flung wide, and houses which at midday had seemed uninhabited were astir with life. In the patios beautiful gardens were blooming, and through iron gates easy-chairs and hammocks could be seen.  Many of the señoritas had come forth, and were strolling in groups of threes or fours, dressed in pink and white lawn, with Spanish veils and fans. The most of them wore white stockings and red-heeled slippers.  Many a witching glance was shyly cast at Frank, but his mind was so occupied that he heeded none of them.  The hotel was reached, and they were dismounting, when a battered and tattered old man, about whose shoulders was cast a ragged blanket, and whose face was hidden by a scraggly, white beard, came up with a faltering step.  \"Pardon me,\" he said, in a thin, cracked voice, \"I see you are Americans, natives of the States, Yankees, and, as I happen to be from Michigan, I hasten to speak to you. I know you will have pity on an unfortunate countryman. My story is short. My son came to this wretched land to try to make a fortune. He went into the mines, and was doing well. He sent me home money, and I put a little aside, so that I had a snug little sum after a time. Then he fell into the hands of Pacheco, the bandit. You have heard of Pacheco, gentlemen?\"  \"We have,\" said Frank, who was endeavoring to get a fair look into the old man's eyes.  \"We surely have,\" agreed the professor.  \"Vell, you can pet my poots on dot!\" nodded Hans.  \"The"]]]
