Then he's to be kicked out?\"  There was a chorus of approving yells, and all save Sadau jumped up to look for sticks and stones. Parr laid his hand on the club he had borne in the skirmish that day.  \"Now wait,\" he said clearly and harshly, and the whole party faced him--Sadau wanly, the girl questioningly, the rest angrily.  \"I'm to be kicked out,\" Parr repeated. \"I'll accept that. I'll go. But,\" and the club lifted itself in his right hand, \"I'm not going to be rough-housed. I've seen it happen here, and none of it for me.\"  \"Oh, no?\" Shanklin had picked up a club of his own, and grinned fiercely.  \"No. Let me go, and I leave without having to be whipped out of camp. Mob me, and I promise to die fighting, right here.\" He stamped a foot on the ground. \"I'll crack a skull or two before I wink out. That's a solemn statement of fact.\"  \"Let him go,\" said Varina Pemberton again, this time with a ring of authority. \"He wears that armor, and he'll put up a fight. We can't spare any more men.\"  \"Thank you,\" Parr told her bleakly. He gave Shanklin a last long stare of challenge, then turned on his heel and walked away toward the thickets amid deep silence. Behind him the council fire made a dwindling hole in the blackness of night. It seemed to be his last hope, fading away.  He pushed in among thick, leafy stems. A voice hailed him:  \"Hah!\"  And a figure, blacker than the gloom, tramped close to him across a little grassy clearing.  \"You! They drive you out?\" a thick, unsure voice accosted him.  Parr hefted his club, wondering if this would be an enemy. \"Yes. They drove me out. I'm exiled from among exiles.\"  \"Uh.\" The other seemed perplexed over these words, as though they stated a situation too complicated. Parr's eyes, growing used to the darkness, saw that this was a grotesque, shaggy form, one of the degenerate outcasts from the village. \"Uh,\" repeated his interrogator. \"You come to us. Make one more in camp. Come.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Among tall trees, thickly grown, lay a throng of sleepers. Parr's companion led him there, and made an awkward gesture.  \"You lie down. You sleep. Tomorrow--boss talk. Uh!\"  So saying, the beast-man curled up at the root of a tree. Parr sat down with his back against another trunk, the club across his knees, but he did not sleep.  This, plainly enough, was the outcast horde. It clung together, the gregariousness of humanity not yet winnowed out by degeneration. It had a ruler, too--\"Tomorrow boss talk.\" Talk of what? In what fashion?  Thus Parr meditated during the long, moonless night. He also took time to examine once more his captured armor. Its metal plates, clamped upon a garment of leatheroid, covered his body and limbs, even the backs of his hands, as well as his neck and scalp. Yet, as he had decided before, it was no great protection against violence. As clothing it was superfluous on this tropical planetoid. What then?  He could not see, but he could feel. His fingers quested all over one plate, probing and tapping. The plate was hollow--in reality, two saucer-shaped plates with their concave faces together. They gave off a muffled clink of hollowness when he tapped them. When he shook the armor, there was something extra in the sound, and that impelled him to hold a plate close to his ear. He heard a soft, rhythmic whirr of machinery.  \"There's a vibration in this stuff,\" he summed up in his mind. \"What for? To protect against what?\"  Then, suddenly, he had it.  The greatest menace of the whole tiny world was the force that reversed evolution--the vibration must be designed to neutralize that force!  \"I'm immune!\" cried Fitzhugh Parr aloud; and, in the early dawn that now crept into the grove, his sleeping companions began to wake and rise and gape at him.  He gaped back, with the shocked fascination that any intelligent person would feel at viewing such reconstructions of his ancestors. At almost the first glance he saw that the newest evolutionary thought was correct--these were simian, but not apes. Ape and man, as he had often heard, sprang from the same common fore-father, low-browed, muzzle-faced, hairy. Such were these, in varying degrees of intensity. None wore clothes. Grinning mouths exhibited fanglike teeth, bare chests broadened powerfully, clumsy hands with short, ineffectual thumbs made foolish gestures. But the feet, for instance, were not like hands, they were flat pedestals with forward-projecting toes. The legs, though short, were powerful. Man's father, decided Parr, must have had something of the bear about his appearance ... and the most bearlike of the twenty or thirty beast-men heaved himself erect and came slouching across toward Parr.  This thing had once been a giant of a man, and remained a giant of an animal. None of the others present were nearly as large, nor were any of the men who had driven Parr forth. Six feet six towered this hair-thicketed ogre, with a chest like a drayhorse, and arms as thick as stovepipes. One hand--the thumb had trouble opposing the great cucumber fingers--flourished a club almost as long as Parr's whole body.  \"I--boss,\" thundered this monster impressively. \"Throw down stick.\"  Parr had risen, his own club poised for defense. The giant's free hand pointed to the weapon. \"Throw down,\" it repeated, with a growl as bearlike as the body.  \"Not me,\" said Parr, and ducked away from the tree-trunk against which he might be pinned. \"What's the idea? I didn't do anything to you--\"  \"I--boss,\" said his threatener again. \"Nobody fight me.\"  \"True, true,\" chorused the others sycophantically. \"Ling, he boss--throw down club, you new man.\"  Parr saw what they meant. With the other community, the newest and therefore most advanced individual ruled. In this more primitive society, the strongest held sway until a stronger displaced him. The giant called Ling was by no means the most human-seeming creature there, but he was plainly the ruler and plainly meant so to continue. Parr was no coward, but he was no fool. As the six-foot bludgeon whirled upward between him and the sky, he cast down his own stick in token of surrender.  \"No argument, Ling,\" he said sensibly.  There was laughter at that, and silly applause. Ling swung around and stripped bare his great pointed fangs in a snarl. Silence fell abruptly, and he faced Parr again. \"You,\" he said. \"You got on--\" And he stepped close, tapping the plates on Parr's chest.  \"It's armor,\" said Parr.  \"Huh! Ah--ar--\" The word was too much for the creature, whose brain and mouth alike had forgotten most language. \"Well,\" said Ling, \"I want. I wear.\"  He fumbled at the fastenings.  Parr jumped clear of him. He had accepted authority a moment ago, but this armor was his insurance against becoming a beast. \"It's mine,\" he objected.  Solemnly Ling shook his great browless head, as big as a coal-scuttle and fringed with bristly beard. \"Mine,\" he said roughly. \"I boss. You--\"  He caught Parr by the arm and dragged him close. So quick and powerful was the clutch that it almost dislocated Parr's shoulder. By sheer instinct, Parr struck with his free fist.  Square and solid on that coarse-bearded chin landed Parr's knuckles, with their covering of armor plate. And Ling, confident to the point of innocence because of his strength and authority, had neither guarded nor prepared. His great head jerked back as though it would fly from his shoulders. And Parr, wrenching loose, followed up the advantage because a second's hesitation would be his downfall.  He hit Ling on the lower end of the breastbone, where his belly would be softest. Above him he heard the beast-giant grunt in pain, and then Parr swung roundabout to score on the jaw again. Ling actually gave back, dropping his immense bludgeon. A body less firmly pedestalled upon powerful legs and scoop-shovel feet would have gone down. It took a moment for him to recover.  \"Aaaah!\" he roared. \"I kill you!\"  Parr had stooped and caught up his own discarded club. Now he threw it full at the distorted face of his enemy. Ling's hands flashed up like a shortstop's, snatched the stick in midair, and broke it in two like a carrot. Another roar, and Ling charged, head down and arms outflung for a pulverizing grapple.  Parr sprang sidewise. Ling blundered past. His stooping head crashed against a tree, his whole body bounded back from the impact, and down he went in a quivering, moaning heap. He did not get up.  Parr backed away, gazing at the others. They stood silent in a score of attitudes, like children playing at moving statues. Then:  \"Huh!\" cried one. \"New boss!\"  A chorus of cries and howls greeted this. They gathered around Parr with fawning faces. \"You boss! You fight Ling--beat 'im. Huh, you boss!\"  At the racket, Ling recovered a little, and managed to squirm into a sitting posture. \"Yes,\" he said, \"you boss.\"  With one hand holding his half-smashed skull, he lifted the other in salute to Parr.         *       *       *       *       *  It took time--several days--but Parr got over his first revulsion at the bestial traits of his new companions. After all, in shedding the wit and grace of man, they were recovering the honest simplicity of animals. For instance, Ling was not malicious about being displaced, as Shanklin had been. Too, there was much more real mutual helpfulness, if not so much talk about it. When one of the horde found a new crop of berries or roots or nuts, he set up a yell for his friends to come and share. A couple of oldsters, doddering and incompetent gargoyles, were fed and cared for by the younger beast-men. And all stood ready to obey Parr's slightest word or gesture.  Thus, though it was a new thought to them, several went exploring with him to the north pole of their world. The journey was no more than fifteen miles, but took them across grassy, foodless plains which had never been worth negotiation. Parr chose Ling and another"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22538"],["title","The Devil's Asteroid (#3)"],["body","intelligent specimen who called himself Ruba. Izak, the mild-mannered one who had first met and guided Parr on the night of his banishment from the human village, also pleaded to go. Several others would have joined the party, but the deterioration of legs and feet made them poor walkers. The four went single file--Parr, then big Ling, then Ruba, then Izak. Each carried, on a vine sling, a leaf-package of fruit and a melon for quenching thirst. They also carried clubs.  The plain was well-grassed, as high as Ling's knuckled knee. Occasionally small creatures hopped or scuttled away. The beast-men threw stones until Parr told them to stop--he could not help but wonder if those scurriers had once been men. The hot sun made him sweat under his plate-armor, but not for all the Solar System would he have laid it aside.  They paused for noonday lunch in a grove of ferny trees beyond the plain, then scaled some rough lava-like rocks. In the early afternoon they came to what must be the asteroid's northern pole.  Like most of the asteroids, this was originally jagged and irregular. Martian engineers in fitting it artificially to support life, had roughed it into a sphere and pulverized quantities of the rock into soil. Here, at the apex, was a ring of rough naked hills enclosing a pit into which the sun could not look. Ling, catching up with Parr on the brow of the circular range, pointed with his great club.  \"Look like mouth of world,\" he hazarded. \"Dark. Maybe world hungry--eat us.\"  \"Maybe,\" agreed Parr. The pit, about a hundred yards across and full of shadow, looked forbidding enough to be a savage maw. Izak also came alongside.  \"Mouth?\" he repeated after Ling. \"Mmm! Look down. Men in there.\"  There was a movement, sure enough, and a flare of something--a torch of punky wood. Izak was right. Men were inside this polar depression.  \"Come on,\" said Parr at once, and began to scramble down the steep, gloomy inner slope. Ling grimaced, but followed lest his companions think him afraid. Ruba and Izak, who feared to be left behind, stayed close to his heels.  The light of the torch flared more brightly. Parr could make out figures in its glow--two of them. The torch itself was wedged in a crack of the rock, and beneath its flame the couple seemed to tug and wrench at something that gleamed darkly, like a great metal toadstool at the bottom of the depression. So engrossed were the workers that they did not notice Parr and his companions, and Parr, drawing near, had time to recognize both.  One was Sadau, who would have remained his friend. The other was Varina Pemberton. In the torchlight she looked browner and more vigorous than when he had seen her last.  \"What are you doing?\" he called to them.  Abruptly they both snapped erect and looked toward him. Sadau seized the torch and whirled it on high, shedding light. Varina Pemberton peered at the newcomers.  \"Oh,\" she said, \"it's you. Parr. Well, get out of here.\"  Parr stood his ground, studying the toadstool-thing they had been laboring over. It was a wheel-like disk of metal, set upon an axle that sprouted from the floor of rock. By turning it, they could finish opening a great rock-faced panel near by....  \"Get out,\" repeated the girl, with a hard edge on her voice.  Parr felt himself grow angry. \"Take it easy,\" he said. \"Your crowd booted me out, and I'm not under your rule any more. Neither can this be said to be your country. We've as much right here as you.\"  \"Four of us,\" added Ruba with threatening logic. \"Two of you. Fight, uh?\"  \"Parr,\" said Sadau, \"do as Miss Pemberton tells you. Leave here.\"  \"And if I don't?\" temporized Parr, who felt the eagerness of his beast-men for some sort of a skirmish.  Varina Pemberton took something from her belt and pointed it. A brittle report resounded--_whick_! And an electro-automatic pellet exploded almost between Parr's feet, digging a hole in the rock. He jumped back. So did his three comrades, from whose memories had not faded the knowledge of firearms.  \"The next shot,\" she warned, \"will be a little higher and more carefully placed. Get out, and don't come back.\"  \"They win,\" said Parr. \"Come on, boys.\"  They retired to the upper combing of rock, with the sun at their backs. There Parr motioned them into hiding behind jagged boulders. Time passed, several hours of it. Finally they saw Sadau and Varina Pemberton depart on the other side of the hole.  \"Good,\" rumbled Ling. \"We follow. Sneak up. Grab. Kill.\"  \"Not us,\" Parr ruled. \"No war against women, Ling. But we'll go down where they were working, and see what it's all about.\"  They groped their way down again. At the bottom of the pit-valley they found the metal projection, so like a mighty steering wheel. Sadau's torch lay there, extinguished, and Parr still carried a radium lighter in the pocket of his shabby shorts. He made a light, and looked.  The big panel or rock, that had been half-open, was closed. As for the wheel, it had been bent and jammed, by powerful blows with a rock. He could not budge it, nor could the mighty Ling, nor could all of them together.  \"They were inside this asteroid,\" decided Parr, half to himself. \"Down where the Martians planted the artificial gravity-machinery. Having been there, they fixed things so nobody will follow them. Only blasting rays could open up a way, and those would probably wreck the mechanism and send air, water and exiles all flying into space. All this she did. Why?\"  \"Why what?\" asked Izak, not comprehending.  \"Yes, why what?\" repeated Parr. \"I can only guess, Izak, and none of my guesses have been worth much lately. Let's go home, and keep an eye peeled on our neighbors.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The Martians had come again--the same space-patroller, repaired, and twice as many hands and a new skipper. They carried no Terrestrial exile--for once their errand was different.  Four of them, harnessed into erect human posture, armed and armored, stood around the evening fire in the central clearing of the village now ruled by Varina Pemberton. The skipper was being insistent, but not particularly deadly.  \"We rrecognize that fourr dead among you will ssettle forr one dead Marrtian,\" he told the gathered exiles. \"The morre sso ass you assurre me that the man rressponssible hass been drriven frrom among you. But we make one demand--the arrmorr taken frrom the body of the dead Marrtian.\"  \"I am sorry about that,\" the chieftainess replied from her side. \"We didn't know that you valued it. If we get it back for you--\"  \"Ssuch action would rreflect favorrably upon you,\" nodded the Martian skipper. \"Get the arrmorr again, and we will rrefrrain frrom punitive meassurress.\"  \"Why do you want that armor so much?\" inquired Shanklin boldly. He himself had never thought of it as worth much. He was more satisfied to have the knife, which he now hid behind him lest the Martians see and claim. But the skipper only shook his petalled skull.  \"It iss no prroblem of yourrss,\" he snubbed Shanklin. And, to Varina Pemberton: \"What time sshall we grrant you? A day? Two dayss?... Come before the end of that time and rreporrt to me at the patrrol vessel.\"  He turned and led his followers back toward the plain where the ship was parked.  Night had well fallen, and silence hung about the vessel. Only a rectangle of soft light showed the open hatchway. The Martian officer led the way thither, ducked his head, entered--  Powerful hairy hands caught and overpowered him. Before he could collect himself for resistance, other hands had disarmed him and were dragging him away. His three companions, narrowly escaping the same fate, fell back and drew their guns and ray throwers. A voice warned them sharply:  \"Don't fire, any of you. We've got your friends in here, and we've taken their electro-automatics. Give us the slightest reason, and we'll wipe them out first--you second.\"  \"Who arre you?\" shrilled one of the Martians, lowering his weapon.  \"My name's Fitzhugh Parr,\" came back the grim reply. \"You framed me into this exile--it's going to prove the worst day's work you Martian flower-faces ever did. Not a move, any of you! The ship's mine, and I'm going to take off at dawn.\"  The three discomfited hands tramped away again. Inside the control room, Parr spoke to his shaggy followers, who grinned and twinkled like so many gnomes doing mischief.  \"They won't dare rush us,\" he said, \"but two of you--Ling and Izak--stay at the door with those guns. Dead sure you can still use 'em?... You, Ruba, come here to the controls. You say you once flew space-craft.\"  Ruba's broad, coarse hand ruffled the bushy hair that grew on his almost browless head. \"Once,\" he agreed dolefully. \"Now I--many thing I don't remember.\" His face, flat-nosed and blubber-lipped, grew bleak and plaintive as he gazed upon instruments he once had mastered.  \"You'll remember,\" Parr assured him vehemently. \"I never flew anything but a short-shot pleasure cruiser, but I'm beginning to dope things out. We'll help each other, Ruba. Don't you want to get away from here, go home?\"  \"Home!\" breathed Ruba, and the ears of the others--pointed, some of those ears, and all of them hairy--pricked up visibly at that word.  \"Well, there you are,\" Parr said encouragingly. \"Sweat your brains, lad. We've got until dawn. Then away we go.\"  \"You will never manage,\" slurred the skipper from the corner where the Martian captives, bound securely, sprawled under custody of a beast-man with a lever bar for a club. \"Thesse animalss have not mental powerr--\"  \"Shut up, or I'll let that guard tap you,\" Parr warned him. \"They had mental power enough to fool you all over the shop. Come on, Ruba. Isn't this the rocket gauge? Please remember how it operates!\"  The capture of the ship had been easy, so easy. The guard had been well kept only until the skipper and his party had gone out of sight toward the human village. Nobody ever expected trouble from beast-men, and the watch on board "]]]
