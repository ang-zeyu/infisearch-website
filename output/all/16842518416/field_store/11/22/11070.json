Conway knew that the boy had saved them, but he gave him no thanks.  It took the ground a long time to cool, and they advanced all the next day over a burned area.  They traveled northward ten days, always ascending, and they were coming now to a wooded country. They crossed several creeks, flowing down from the higher mountains, and along the beds of these they found cottonwood, ash, box elder, elm, and birch.  On the steeper slops were numerous cedar brakes and also groves of yellow pine.  There was very little undergrowth, but the grass grew in abundance. Although it was now somewhat dry, the horses and mules ate it eagerly.  The buffaloes did not appear here, but they saw many signs of bear, mule deer, panther or mountain lion, and other game.  They camped one night in a pine grove by the side of a brook that came rushing and foaming down from the mountains, and the next morning Albert, who walked some distance from the water, saw a silver-tip bear lapping the water of the stream. The bear raised his head and looked at Albert, and Albert stopped and looked at the bear.  The boy was unarmed, but he was not afraid.  The bear showed no hostility, only curiosity.  He gazed a few moments, stretched his nose as if he would sniff the air, then turned and lumbered away among the pines.  Albert returned to camp, but he said nothing of the bear to anybody except Dick.  \"He was such a jolly, friendly looking fellow, Dick,\"  he said, \"that I didn't want any of these men to go hunting him.\"  Dick laughed.  \"Don't you worry about that, Al,\" he said.  \"They are hunting gold, not bears.\"  On the twelfth day they came out on a comparatively level plateau, where antelope were grazing and prairie chickens whirring.  It looked like a fertile country, and they were glad of easy traveling for the wagons.  Just at the edge of the pine woods that they were leaving was a beautiful little lake of clear, blue water, by which they stayed half a day, refreshing themselves, and catching some excellent fish, the names of which they did not know.  \"How much long, Bright Sun, will it take us to reach the gold country?\" asked Conway of the Indian, in Dick's hearing.  \"About a week,\" replied Bright Sun.  \"The way presently will be very rough and steep, up! up! up! and we can go only a few miles a day, but the mountains are already before us.  See!\"  He pointed northward and upward, and there before them was the misty blue loom that Dick knew was the high mountains.  In those dark ridges lay the gold that they were going to seek, and his heart throbbed.  Albert and he could do such wonderful things with it.  They were so high already that the nights were crisp with cold; but at the edge of the forest, running down to the little lake, fallen wood was abundant, and they built that night a great fire of fallen boughs that crackled and roared merrily.  Yet they hovered closely, because the wind, sharp with ice, was whistling down from the mountains, and the night air, even in the little valley, was heavy with frost.  Dick's buffalo robe was dry now, and he threw it around Albert, as he sat before the fire.  It enveloped the boy like a great blanket, but far warmer, the soft, smooth fur caressing his cheeks, and as Albert drew it closer, he felt very snug indeed.  \"We cross this valley to-morrow,\" said Dick, \"and then we begin a steeper climb.\"  \"Then it will be mountains, only mountains,\" said Bright Sun. \"We go into regions which no white men except the fur hunters, have ever trod.\"  Dick started.  He had not known that the Indian was near. Certainly he was not there a moment ago.  There was something uncanny in the way in which Bright Sun would appear on noiseless footstep, like a wraith rising from the earth.  \"I shall be glad of it, Bright Sun,\" said Albert.  \"I'm tired of the plains, and they say that the mountains are good for many ills.\"  Bright Sun's enigmatic glance rested upon Albert a moment.  \"Yes,\" he said, \"the mountains will cure many ills.\"  Dick glanced at him, and once more he received the impression of thought and power.  The Indian's nose curved like an eagle's beak, and the firelight perhaps exaggerated both the curve and its effect.  The whole impression of thought and force was heightened by the wide brow and the strong chin.  Dick looked back into the fire, and when he glanced around a few moments again, Bright Sun was not there.  He had gone as silently as he had come.  \"That Indian gives me the shivers sometimes,\" he said to Albert. \"What do you make of him?\"  \"I don't know,\" replied the boy.  \"Sometimes I like him and sometimes I don't.\"  Albert was soon asleep, wrapped in the buffalo robe, and Dick by and by followed him to the same pleasant land.  The wind, whistling as it blew down from the mountains, grew stronger and colder, and its tone was hostile, as if it resented the first presence of white men in the little valley by the lake.     Chapter III The Pass  They resumed the journey early the next day, Bright Sun telling Conway that they could reach the range before sunset, and that they would find there an easy pass leading a mile or two farther on to a protected and warm glen.  \"That's the place for our camp,\" said Conway, and he urged the train forward.  The traveling was smooth and easy, and they soon left the little blue lake well behind, passing through a pleasant country well wooded with elm, ash, birch, cottonwood, and box elder, and the grass growing high everywhere.  They crossed more than one clear little stream, a pleasant contrast to the sluggish, muddy creeks of the prairies.  The range, toward which the head of the train was pointing, now came nearer.  The boys saw its slopes, shaggy with dark pine, and they knew that beyond it lay other and higher slopes, also dark with pine.  The air was of a wonderful clearness, showing in the east and beyond the zenith a clear silver tint, while the west was pure red gold with the setting sun.  Nearer and nearer came the range.  The great pines blurred at first into an unbroken mass, now stood out singly, showing their giant stems.  Afar a flash of foamy white appeared, where a brook fell in a foamy cascade.  Presently they were within a quarter of a mile of the range, and its shadow fell over the train.  In the west the sun was low.  \"The pass is there, straight ahead,\" said Bright Sun, pointing to the steep range.  \"I don't see any opening,\" said Conway.  \"It is so narrow and the pines hide it,\" rejoined Bright Sun, \"but it is smooth and easy.\"  Albert was at the rear of the train.  He had chosen to walk in the later hours of the afternoon.  He had become very tired, but, unwilling to confess it even to himself, he did not resume his place in the wagon.  His weariness made him lag behind.  Albert was deeply sensitive to the impressions of time and place.  The twilight seemed to him to fall suddenly like a great black robe.  The pines once more blurred into a dark, unbroken mass.  The low sun in the west dipped behind the hills, and the rays of red and gold that it left were chill and cold.  \"Your brother wishes to see you.  He is at the foot of the creek that we crossed fifteen minutes ago.\"  It was Bright Sun who spoke.  \"Dick wants to see me at the crossing of the creek!  Why, I thought he was ahead of me with the train!\" exclaimed Albert.  \"No, he is waiting for you.  He said that it was important,\" repeated Bright Sun.  Albert turned in the darkening twilight and went back on the trail of the train toward the crossing of the creek.  Bright Sun went to the head of the train, and saw Dick walking there alone and looking at the hills.  \"Your brother is behind at the creek,\" said Bright Sun.  \"He is ill and wishes you.  Hurry!  I think it is important!\"  \"Albert at the creek, ill?\" exclaimed Dick in surprise and alarm.  \"Why, I thought he was here with the train!\"  But Bright Sun had gone on ahead.  Dick turned back hastily, and ran along the trail through the twilight that was now fast merging into the night.  \"Al, ill and left behind!\" he exclaimed again and again.  \"He must have overexerted himself!\"  His alarm deepened when he saw how fast the darkness was increasing.  The chill bars of red and gold were gone from the west.  When he looked back he could see the train no more, and heard only the faint sound of the cracking of whips.  The train was fast disappearing in the pass.  But Dick had become a good woodsman and plainsman.  His sense of direction was rarely wrong, and he went straight upon the trail for the creek.  Night had now come but it was not very dark, and presently he saw the flash of water.  It was the creek, and a few more steps took him there.  A figure rose out of the shadows.  \"Al!\" he cried.  \"Have you broken down?  Why didn't you get into the wagon?\"  \"Dick,\" replied Albert in a puzzled tone, \"there's nothing the matter with me, except that I'm tired.  Bright Sun told me that you were here waiting for me, and that you had something important to tell me.  I couldn't find you, and now you come running.\"  Dick stopped in amazement.  \"Bright Sun said I was waiting here for you, and had something important to tell you?\" exclaimed Dick.  \"Why, he told me that you were ill, and had been left unnoticed at the crossing!\"  The two boys stared at each other.  \"What does it mean?\" they exclaimed together.  From the dark pass before them came a sound which in the distance resembled the report of a firecracker, followed quickly by two or three other sounds, and then by many, as if the whole pack had been ignited at once.  But both boys knew it was not firecrackers. It was something far more deadly and terrible--a hail of rifle bullets.  They looked toward the pass and saw there pink and red flashes appearing and reappearing.  Shouts, and mingled with them a continuous long, whining cry, a dreadful overnote, came to their ears.  \"The train has been attacked!\" cried Dick.  \"It has marched"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22464"],["title","The Last of the Chiefs: A Story of the Great Sioux War (#6)"],["body","into an ambush!\"  \"Indians?\"  exclaimed Albert, who was trembling violently from sheer physical and mental excitement.  \"It couldn't be anything else!\" replied Dick.  \"This is their country!  And they must be in great force, too!  Listen how the fight grows!\"  The volume of the firing increased rapidly, but above it always rose that terrible whining note.  The red and pink flashes in the pass danced and multiplied, and the wind brought the faint odor of smoke.  \"We must help!\" exclaimed Dick.  \"One can't stand here and see them all cut down!\"  He forgot in his generous heart, at that moment, that he disliked Conway and all his men, and that he and Albert had scarcely a friend in the train.  He thought only of doing what he could to beat back the Indian attack, and Albert felt the same impulse. Both had their rifles--fine, breech-loading, repeating weapons, and with these the two might do much.  No one ever parted with his arms after entering the Indian country.  \"Come on, Albert!\" exclaimed Dick, and the two ran toward the pass.  But before they had gone a hundred yards they stopped as if by the same impulse.  That terrible whining note was now rising higher and higher.  It was not merely a war whoop, it had become also a song of triumph.  There was a certain silvery quality in the night air, a quality that made for illumination, and Dick thought he saw dusky forms flitting here and there in the mouth of the pass behind the train.  It was only fancy, because he was too far away for such perception, but in this case fancy and truth were the same.  \"Hurry, Dick!  Let's hurry!\" exclaimed the impulsive and generous Albert.  \"If we don't, we'll be too late to do anything!\"  They started again, running as fast as they could toward that space in the dark well where the flashes of red and blue came and went.  Dick was so intent that he did not hear the short, quick gasps of Albert, but he did hear a sudden fall beside him and stopped short.  Albert was lying on his back unconscious.  A faint tinge of abnormal red showed on his lips.  \"Oh, I forgot!  I forgot!\" groaned Dick.  Such sudden and violent exertion, allied with the excitement of the terrible moment, had overpowered the weak boy.  Dick bent down in grief.  At first he thought his brother was dead, but the breath still came.  Dick did not know what to do.  In the pass, under the shadow of night, the pines, and the mountain wall, the battle still flared and crackled, but its volume was dying.  Louder rose the fierce, whining yell, and its note was full of ferocity and triumph, while the hoarser cries of the white men became fewer and lower. Now Dick really saw dusky figures leaping about between him and the train.  Something uttering a shrill, unearthly cry of pain crashed heavily through the bushes near him and quickly passed on.  It was a wounded horse, running away.  Dick shuddered.  Then he lifted Albert in his arms, and he had the forethought, even in that moment of excitement and danger, to pick up Albert's rifle also.  Strong as he naturally was, he had then the strength of four, and, turning off at a sharp angle, he ran with Albert toward a dense thicket which clustered at the foot of the mountain wall.  He went a full three hundred yards before he was conscious of weariness, and he was then at the edge of the thicket, which spread over a wide space.  He laid Albert down on some of last year's old leaves, and then his quick eyes caught the sight of a little pool among some rocks.  He dipped up the water in his felt hat, and after carefully wiping the red stain from his brother's lips, poured the cold fluid upon his face.  Albert revived, sat up, and tried to speak, but Dick pressed his hand upon his mouth.  \"Nothing above a whisper, Al,\" he said softly.  \"The fight is not yet wholly over, and the Sioux are all about.\"  \"I fainted,\" said Albert in a whisper.  \"O  Dick, what a miserable, useless fellow I am!  But it was the excitement and the run!\"  \"It was doubtless a lucky thing that you fainted,\" Dick whispered back.  \"If you hadn't, both of us would probably be dead now.\"  \"It's not all over yet,\" said Albert.  \"No, but it soon will be.  Thank God, we've got our rifles.  Do you feel strong enough to walk now, Al?  The deeper we get into the thicket the better it will be for us.\"  Albert rose slowly to his feet, rocked a little, and then stood straight.  Only a few flashes were appearing now in the pass.  Dick knew too well who had been victorious.  The battle over, the Sioux would presently be ranging for stragglers and for plunder.  He put one arm under Albert, while he carried both of the rifles himself. They walked on through the thicket and the night gradually darkened.  The silvery quality was gone from the air, and the two boys were glad.  It would not be easy to find them now.  In the pass both the firing and the long, whining whoop ceased entirely. The flashes of red or blue appeared no more.  Silence reigned there and in the valley.  Dick shivered despite himself.  For the moment the silence was more terrible than the noise of battle had been.  Black, ominous shadows seemed to float down from the mountains, clothing all the valley.  A chill wind came up, moaning among the pines.  The valley, so warm and beautiful in the day, now inspired Dick with a sudden and violent repulsion.  It was a hateful place, the abode of horror and dread.  He wished to escape from it.  They crossed the thicket and came up against the mountain wall. But it was not quite so steep as it had looked in the distance, and in the faint light Dick saw the trace of a trail leading up the slope among the pines.  It was not the trail of human beings, merely a faint path indicating that wild animals, perhaps cougars, had passed that way.  \"How are you feeling, Al?\" he asked, repeating his anxious query.  \"Better.  My strength has come back,\" replied his brother.  \"Then we'll go up the mountain.  We must get as far away as we can from those fiends, the Sioux.  Thank God, Al, we're spared together!\"  Each boy felt a moment of devout thankfulness.  They had not fallen, and they were there together!  Each also thought of the singular message that Bright Sun had given to them, but neither spoke of it.  They climbed for more than half an hour in silence, save for an occasional whisper.  The bushes helped Albert greatly.  He pulled himself along by means of them, and now and then the two boys stopped that he might rest.  He was still excited under the influence of the night, the distant battle, and their peril, and he breathed in short gasps, but did not faint again.  Dick thrust his arm at intervals under his brother's and helped him in the ascent.  After climbing a quarter of an hour, they stopped longer than usual and looked down at the pass, which Dick reckoned should be almost beneath them.  They heard the faint sound of a shot, saw a tiny beam of red appear, then disappear, and after that there was only silence and blank darkness.  \"It's all over now,\" whispered Albert, and it was a whisper not of caution, but of awe.  \"Yes, it's all over,\" Dick said in the same tone.  \"It's likely, Al, that you and I alone out of all that train are alive.  Conway and all the others are gone.\"  \"Except Bright Sun,\" said Albert.  The two boys looked at each other again, but said nothing.  They then resumed their climbing, finding it easier this time.  They reached a height at which the undergrowth ceased, but the pines, growing almost in ordered rows, stretched onward and upward.  Dick sent occasional glances toward the pass, but the darkness there remained unbroken.  Every time he turned his eyes that way he seemed to be looking into a black well of terror.  Both Dick and Albert, after the first hour of ascent, had a feeling of complete safety.  The Sioux, occupied with their great ambush and victory, would not know there had been two stragglers behind the train, and even had they known, to search for them among the dense forests of distant mountain slopes would be a futile task.  Dick's mind turned instead to the needs of their situation, and he began to appreciate the full danger and hardship of it.  Albert and he were right in feeling thankful that they were spared together, although they were alone in the wilderness in every sense of the word.  It was hundreds of miles north, east, south, and west to the habitations of white men.  Before them, fold on fold, lay unknown mountains, over which only hostile savages roamed.  Both he and Albert had good rifles and belts full of cartridges, but that was all.  It was a situation to daunt the most fearless heart, and the shiver that suddenly ran over Dick did not come from the cold of the night.  They took a long rest in a little clump of high pines and saw a cold, clear moon come out in the pale sky.  They felt the awful sense of desolation and loneliness, for it seemed to them that the moon was looking down on an uninhabited world in which only they were left.  They heard presently little rustlings in the grass, and thought at first it was another ambush, though they knew upon second thought that it was wild creatures moving on the mountain side.  \"Come, Al,\" said Dick.  \"Another half hour will put us on top of the ridge, and then I think it will be safe for us to stop.\"  \"I hope they'll be keeping a good room for us at the hotel up there,\" said Albert wanly.  Dick tried to laugh, but it was a poor imitation and he gave it up.  \"We may find some sort of a sheltered nook,\" he said hopefully.  Dick had become conscious that it was cold, since the fever in his blood was dying down.  Whenever they stopped and their bodies relaxed, they suffered from chill.  He was deeply worried about Albert, who was in no condition to endure exposure on a bleak mountain, and wished now for the buffalo robe they had regarded as such a fine trophy.  They reached the crest of the ridge in a half hour, as Dick had expected, and looking northward in the moonlight saw"]]]
