Sometimes they were addressed to Miss E. Dingus, sometimes Margery Dubois; sometimes Hester Broughton. Sometimes they were sent to a street number, but often to General Delivery. Mention was often made of the children and usually in rather impatient terms. The following are extracts from the letters:  \"Don't let the brats worry you but you had better not let anything happen to them.\"  \"Get a doctor if the pests are sick, because we don't want investigations.\"  \"If they keep on insisting on going back to their mother just tell them she is dead.\"  \"Caution them not to tell anything about themselves and if need be intimidate them. Polly can remember too much.\"  \"Keep up and don't get too tired of your job. There will be an end of it sometime and you will receive your reward.\"  \"Of course I mean to marry you as soon as I can arrange our affairs. It is important to go carefully for a while. Don't let the kids know there is any possibility of our marrying. Be sure and burn all of my letters.\"  \"M. W. is safe behind bars. S. W.'s will has been probated, it being certain now that he is dead. I am sole executor and guardian of the children in case his wife should pass away without a will. She will I am sure.\"  \"The infamous wretch!\" exclaimed Josie,  In many of the letters there was a response to a plea for money and more money. \"I send you all I can spare. Don't let the brats spend so much. They have been spoiled by too much indulgence already.\"  \"Humph! Pickle and cream puffs for breakfast!\" stormed Josie. \"Mr. Chester Hunt I certainly hope to make you squirm. But I wish I could find out why Dink gave up the kiddies and why she destroyed her more-or-less love letters.\"  Every torn letter was pieced together and the contents mastered before Josie heard the dinner bell. The other communications appeared to be of little value--letters from theatrical persons from different parts of the country and a few from some man who signed himself \"Mike.\" The letters from Mike, Josie put in a packet to themselves. \"She may have another man on the string,\" she mused. \"Mike may be our trump card, the joker.\"  All of Mike's letters were addressed to Margery Dubois. They were badly spelled and written in a labored handwriting but Josie felt that Mike was a worthy fellow. Reading character by means of chirography had been one of Detective O'Gorman's hobbies and Josie had taken up the science to some extent. As Josie perused these epistles she gathered that Mike had been Margery Dubois's dancing partner. Evidently they had been on the vaudeville stage together.  \"Not love letters at all,\" Josie decided. \"When he says he misses her so much, can't get along without her, he means he wants her to act with him again.\"  The last one was from Chicago. In it he made an urgent appeal to his former partner to join him there. \"A big thing if you can come in a day or so. Plenty of tin and three-night stands in big towns. No barnstorming bizness in this job.\" This letter was signed Mike Brady and the Chicago address was given.  \"That's where she has gone,\" decided Josie.  By the time the great gong in the basement clanged forth its summons to dinner Josie had grasped the contents of most of the letters found in the grate, had tied them in neat packages and had them carefully stowed away in her suitcase, the suitcase locked and the key in her pocket.    CHAPTER VIII PETER REFUSES NEW PARENTS  The Children's Home Society moved to the old Hathaway house as soon as possible after Mary Louise signed the deed making over the property to the society. The new quarters were well suited to the needs of the Children's Home, large airy rooms with long porches and a delightful yard and garden where the little tots could play.  \"I don't want to leave Mr. and Mrs. Robin before they hatch out their fambly,\" moaned Peter. \"Looks like we can't never stay put, can we, Polly?\"  \"But the big house is much nicer, Peter dear,\" comforted Polly. \"It kinder reminds me of where we lived one time with Mother and Daddy. That had a yard to it and lots of sweet violets bordering the walks. I wish you could remember the violets, Peter.\"  \"I wish I could. Sometimes I 'most can--but don't you ever forget 'em, Polly. You keep on talking about 'em and maybe sometime I can 'member too the way I can the porridge bowls. I won't never forget our mother. I'm sure glad you didn't never let Cousin Dink know we had her picture, hers and Daddy's.\"  \"Not me! That old Dink wouldn't have let me keep them. I haven't ever showed them to anybody but that nice Miss Josie girl. She is safe I believe and she wouldn't ever let Cousin Dink nor anybody know. She is going to have them framed and let us hang them up in our room. I like being here lots better than traveling 'round with old Cousin Dink, don't you, Peter!\"  \"I should say so. I hope nobody won't want to 'dopt us. They say folks is all time 'doptin' children from here. That's what the nurse told me when she washed my face and hands. She says, 'If you don't be clean nobody won't want to 'dopt you,' so I'm gonter be as dirty as ever I can be.\"  \"Oh, Peter, what would Mother say? It would be real nice to be 'dopted if we could get 'dopted together.\"  \"Oh, but they couldn't take me without you,\" and Peter began to weep. \"Let's both of us have dirty faces all the time so nobody won't want us.\"  \"No, let's both of us have clean faces all the time so somebody will want both of us. I'm mighty sorry I cut my hair off so jiggly. When it grows out I'm going to see if I can't save up some money and get a permanent wave so's I'll look lovely and everybody that comes to the home will say, 'Who is that charming child? I'll take her and her dear little brother too and well be a happy family.' Now wouldn't that be nice, Peter dear?\"  \"That 'pends on who it is. Supposin' it was a person like Cousin Dink that comed along an' took us away an' then knocked us around an' wouldn't let us stay put; I'm thinkin' about stayin' put for a while.\"  The two little waifs had many conversations similar to the foregoing. They soon fitted themselves into the life of the home. Peter was a general favorite because of his engaging manner and sweet confiding nature, while Polly made herself so useful in helping to care for the babies with which the home swarmed that the nurses declared they did not know what they would do without her. She was a motherly child and, having taken care of Peter so much during her mother's illness and after the wanderings with Cousin Dink began, she was well able to nurse the little ones.  \"There's something about little babies that makes me happy all over and makes me want to cry too,\" she said to one of the nurses, holding to her bosom a little pink mummy-like bundle, a recent addition to the home. \"I hope some nice kind lady is going to want this little baby child and she will grow up and never know she's 'dopted. Being 'dopted isn't so bad if you don't ever know it. Peter don't want ever to be 'dopted because he thinks somebody like Cousin Dink might get him. I hope they will just let me go on living here and by and by I can be a real sure-enough nurse and wash all the little babies and Peter can grow up and be a policeman or something. Peter used to be afraid of policemen but ever since Miss Josie told him what nice men they were and one time introduced him to a big cop on the corner and Peter shook hands with him, he's been thinking policemen are the finest things going and he wants to be one worse than anything. Peter could be a big policeman and could bring all the little homeless babies here and I could wash them clean and curl their hair and get them ready to be 'dopted.\"  One day shortly after they had moved to the Hathaway house a ringing of the front door bell heralded the advent of callers. Since callers often meant would-be adopters of infants it was natural for manager and nurses to wish to make as good a showing as possible. A lady and a gentleman were ushered into the parlor. Dr. Weston congratulated himself that everything was in such good order and that he could testify to the good health and disposition of so many of his charges.  \"I am thinking of adopting a little boy,\" spoke the lady, an exceedingly prim little person with a determined chin. \"My husband wants a boy, although I should really prefer a girl.\"  The husband, a sad-eyed man with a humorous twitch to his mouth, looked a bit astonished at this statement. He had been laboring under the idea that it was just the other way around--that he preferred a girl and his wife a boy--but it made very little difference. She was going to have what she wanted, even to the extent of making him pretend he wanted what she wanted.  \"An infant, I presume, madam?\" said Dr. Weston.  \"No, not at all! I'd prefer a little boy who has cut his teeth and can talk. Of course I'd like him to have curls, and to come from a nice family, and to be perfectly sound and healthy, and to have no bad habits--such as eating plastering or having adenoids. I want a bright, attractive child with a sweet disposition so that I can raise him up for the ministry.\"  \"Um-hum!\" mused Dr. Weston. \"I'll see what we have to offer in the way of angels. There are some children playing in the yard now, madam. Perhaps you and your husband would like to go have a look at them. The infants are on the southern porch in their cribs but the little ones who can toddle we keep out in the yard all we can.\"  The garden of the old Hathaway house again was the background for a picturesque scene. In the same spot where Hortense Markle had so cleverly staged Mary Louise's out door wedding not so many months before, ten little children from two years up to six were playing happily in a sand pile,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22537"],["title","Mr. Dooley in Peace and in War (#0)"],["body","Mr. DOOLEY  IN PEACE AND IN WAR        [Illustration]  Boston Small, Maynard & Company 1899  Copyright, 1898, by the Chicago Journal Copyright, 1898, by Small, Maynard & Company  First Edition (10,000 copies) November, 1898 Second Edition (10,000 copies) December, 1898 Third Edition (10,000 copies) January, 1899  Press of George H. Ellis, Boston, U.S.A.     TO W.H. TURNER     PREFACE.   Archey Road stretches back for many miles from the heart of an ugly city to the cabbage gardens that gave the maker of the seal his opportunity to call the city \"urbs in horto.\" Somewhere between the two--that is to say, forninst th' gas-house and beyant Healey's slough and not far from the polis station--lives Martin Dooley, doctor of philosophy.  There was a time when Archey Road was purely Irish. But the Huns, turned back from the Adriatic and the stock-yards and overrunning Archey Road, have nearly exhausted the original population,--not driven them out as they drove out less vigorous races, with thick clubs and short spears, but edged them out with the more biting weapons of modern civilization,--overworked and under-eaten them into more languid surroundings remote from the tanks of the gas-house and the blast furnaces of the rolling-mill.  But Mr. Dooley remains, and enough remain with him to save the Archey Road. In this community you can hear all the various accents of Ireland, from the awkward brogue of the \"far-downer\" to the mild and aisy Elizabethan English of the southern Irishman, and all the exquisite variations to be heard between Armagh and Bantry Bay, with the difference that would naturally arise from substituting cinders and sulphuretted hydrogen for soft misty air and peat smoke. Here also you can see the wakes and christenings, the marriages and funerals, and the other fêtes of the ol' counthry somewhat modified and darkened by American usage. The Banshee has been heard many times in Archey Road. On the eve of All Saints' Day it is well known that here alone the pookies play thricks in cabbage gardens. In 1893 it was reported that Malachi Dempsey was called \"by the other people,\" and disappeared west of the tracks, and never came back.  A simple people! \"Simple, says ye!\" remarked Mr. Dooley. \"Simple like th' air or th' deep sea. Not complicated like a watch that stops whin th' shoot iv clothes ye got it with wears out. Whin Father Butler wr-rote a book he niver finished, he said simplicity was not wearin' all ye had on ye'er shirt-front, like a tin-horn gambler with his di'mon' stud. An' 'tis so.\"  The barbarians around them are moderately but firmly governed, encouraged to passionate votings for the ruling race, but restrained from the immoral pursuit of office.  The most generous, thoughtful, honest, and chaste people in the world are these friends of Mr. Dooley,--knowing and innocent; moral, but giving no heed at all to patented political moralities.  Among them lives and prospers the traveller, archæologist, historian, social observer, saloon-keeper, economist, and philosopher, who has not been out of the ward for twenty-five years \"but twict.\" He reads the newspapers with solemn care, heartily hates them, and accepts all they print for the sake of drowning Hennessy's rising protests against his logic. From the cool heights of life in the Archey Road, uninterrupted by the jarring noises of crickets and cows, he observes the passing show, and meditates thereon. His impressions are transferred to the desensitized plate of Mr. Hennessy's mind, where they can do no harm.  \"There's no betther place to see what's goin' on thin the Ar-rchey Road,\" says Mr. Dooley. \"Whin th' ilicthric cars is hummin' down th' sthreet an' th' blast goin' sthrong at th' mills, th' noise is that gr-reat ye can't think.\"  He is opulent in good advice, as becomes a man of his station; for he has mastered most of the obstacles in a business career, and by leading a prudent and temperate life has established himself so well that he owns his own house and furniture, and is only slightly behind on his license. It would be indelicate to give statistics as to his age. Mr. Hennessy says he was a \"grown man whin th' pikes was out in forty-eight, an' I was hedge-high, an' I'm near fifty-five.\" Mr. Dooley says Mr. Hennessy is eighty. He closes discussion on his own age with the remark, \"I'm old enough to know betther.\" He has served his country with distinction. His conduct of the important office of captain of his precinct (1873-75) was highly commended, and there was some talk of nominating him for alderman. At the expiration of his term he was personally thanked by the Hon. M. McGee, at one time a member of the central committee. But the activity of public life was unsuited to a man of Mr. Dooley's tastes; and, while he continues to view the political situation always with interest and sometimes with alarm, he has resolutely declined to leave the bar for the forum. His early experience gave him wisdom in discussing public affairs. \"Politics,\" he says, \"ain't bean bag. 'Tis a man's game; an' women, childher, an' pro-hybitionists'd do well to keep out iv it.\" Again he remarks, \"As Shakespeare says, 'Ol' men f'r th' council, young men f'r th' ward.'\"  An attempt has been made in this book to give permanent form to a few of the more characteristic and important of Mr. Dooley's utterances. For permission to reprint the articles the thanks of the editor are due to Mr. George G. Booth, of the Chicago _Journal_, and to Mr. Dooley's constant friend, Mr. H.H.
