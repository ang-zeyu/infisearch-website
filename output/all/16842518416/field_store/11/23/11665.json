Then let him get alone with the Moses of the New Testament. For there is no man who was so utterly transformed, and so quickly, as the man on the Damascus road. The whole course of his character and life was radically changed as by a lightning touch. This is the most striking illustration of all. No man so reveals in himself the tremendous transforming power there is in the sight of the Christ as does this high-strung son of the Hebrew race.  But--words are such lame things. They cannot tell the story here. They are all one has to use. Yet they'll never be understood except as the light of experience shines upon them. When any one attempts to talk of such a thing as this of seeing God or Christ, his words seem so poor and lame and under the mark by the man who has had something of the vision. And they either are meaningless and uninteresting, or else they seem overstated, and quite beyond the mark to one who has had no inkling in experience of the thing itself.  I recall distinctly the experience of a Danish friend in Copenhagen. She had been trying to read in English a certain devotional book, but said she couldn't seem to grasp the meaning of the English words. They eluded her, and so the book didn't help her much.  Then she went through a time of sore stress of spirit in the sickness and death of her mother. A new experience of the nearness of God came to her. And then happening--as it seemed--to pick up the English book again she was amazed and delighted to find how much better and more quickly she knew the words and sensed the meaning.  It is only as the heart is fired that the brain awakens. Experience gives the meaning to language. Without experience it is a dead language in meaning even though it be one's own mother tongue. Only the man who has caught something of the vision of Christ's face can understand the strong words used in talking of such a vision.  It is most striking to notice that even when the glory of God's presence was hidden beneath human wrappings in Jesus it still could be _felt_. Men felt that presence though they knew not just what it was they felt, nor why. When the glory came yet closer in the coming of Jesus, it must be well covered up for the sake of men's eyes, that they might not go blind at once; but its power of attraction could not be wholly hid.  So really human was Jesus in the outer circumstance of His life that His brothers of the home couldn't believe he was essentially different from themselves. But the attraction of that presence was felt constantly even through the human hiding of it.  John of the Wilderness instinctively recognized that here was more than the man he saw, and so obeyed His word. The crowds gathered eagerly in the Jordan bottoms in even greater numbers than to hear John, drawn by a power they felt they must yield to, and did yield to gladly.  From the first the crowds gathered thick about Him, Jewish aristocrat, Samaritan half-breed and sinful outcast jostling elbows in their eagerness to hear, drawn by a power they could feel, but could not understand any more than they could withstand it. The children loved his presence and touch.  The bad in life were as resistlessly drawn up to a new life as the Greeks were drawn from clear beyond the blue waters of the Hellespont into His presence. The crowds were irresistibly drawn to follow on that last eventful journey to Jerusalem even while they felt \"afraid.\"  It was the sight of the glory on the Mount that drew faithful John in _with_ Jesus, and held him steady that awful night in palace and courtyard, and that later brought poor blasphemous Peter back for forgiveness. The two walking to Emmaus found their hearts all aflame, though they supposed it was only the chance stranger of the roadway they listened to.  Even those who hated Him were compelled to recognize the wondrous power of His presence. The Nazareth hands that itched to seize Him were restrained by His presence as He passed through their midst. Ten times did the Jerusalem crowds attempt his life, and ten times were they restrained by a power in Him that they could neither understand nor withstand.  The men officially empowered to arrest Him return empty-handed, confessing the overawing power of His words. That last week the leaders that were hotly plotting His death felt the strange restraint of His presence while He quietly sat in their very midst, and swayed the crowds.  In the garden soldiers and priests alike were felled to the ground by the power of His presence. So it always has been. No one has ever had a sight of that Face, and gotten used to it, or gotten over it.   A Fresh Vision Needed.  But the thing we are specially needing to-day is a sight of Christ _as He is now_. It seems a bit strange that we don't get this more. One historic Church has Him fastened to a cross, never freed from the old fastenings. Another has Him set in picture frame, behind glass. And the multitudes prostrate themselves and reverently kiss the glass.  In widely differing Churches He seems quite covered up out of sight by classical ritual, beautiful music, and impressive stately service. The crowds gather and listen and bow low in hushed stillness. But, apparently, _Him they see not_, else how different their conduct as they come out, and their lives.  And yet as I have mingled with the worshippers in Catholic Churches in the south of Europe, in Greek Churches in Russia, and in congregations of the Church of England classed as \"high,\" I have been caught by faces here and there in the crowd that clearly were reaching out hungrily for _Him_, and were having some sort, some real sort, of touch with Him, too. Yet it seemed to be in spite of surroundings. The insistence of their hunger pierces through these to Him. He seems hidden from the crowd by them.  Scholarly orthodox theologians talk learnedly about Him, but Himself as He walked among us and as He is now, Him it would seem that they see not, at least not enough to burn through and burn out and burn up and send men out aflame with the Jesus-passion. Philosophies about Him that are classed as \"liberal\" and put attractively, yet have nothing of the burn in them that reveals Himself.  The more modern Church of the more western world seems to have gotten a new lease of aggressiveness in service, a new intensity in activities so numerous as to be a bit bewildering sometimes. The wheels whir busily and noisily. You feel them. But Him, the unseen presence that makes you reverently wrap your face up out of sight, and stand with awed heart to listen, _Him_ we seem not to see.  The wondrous quiet Voice that makes your heart burn within you with a burning that cleanses and mellows and melts down, _that_ we seem to hear only by getting away from the noise of the whirring wheels into some quiet corner.  There are in every Church and nation those who seem to have the close personal touch with Himself. Their faces and daily lives show the marks. Their lips may not say so much, for they who see most can say least of what they see. But the marks in the life are unmistakable.  Yet even here the sight of Christ emphasizes chiefly the personal side, what He is personally to them. And what a blessed side that is only they who know it know. They think of Him as a personal Saviour, and the heart glows. They see Him at the Father's right hand interceding, and gratefully remember that He will forget no name where there is a trusting heart. They think of the Holy Spirit, the other Jesus, Jesus' other self, always \"alongside to help,\" alongside _in_side. And they practise letting Him work out the Christ-likeness within themselves.  And all this is blessed, only blessed. They see Him in His personal relation to themselves. But there's something more than this. No one knew more of this blessed personal part than John. But John saw more than this on Patmos. He saw Christ _as He is now_.  This is clearly a new sight of Christ. It was new to John. It would seem to be new to us. It is new in the pages of this book. It is something different from any sight seen before. In the Gospels we see Jesus the _Man_. In carpenter shop and little whitewashed stone cottage, in the ministering life clear from the Jordan bottoms to the healing touch at Gethsemane's gate, and in the suffering clear up to the ninth hour of that fateful day He is the _Man_, one of ourselves, though clearly more even in His humanity than the humanity we are.  On the Transfiguration Mount the favoured inner three, the leaders, see the glory within shining out through the Man. So bewildered are they that the chief impression that remains is of a blinding brightness. Yet this is up on a high mountain far away from the crowd, and from the haunts of men.  As Stephen is being stoned his eyes are opened to see the Son of Man standing in glory up at the Father's right hand. The Damascus traveller sees an overpowering burst of glory out of the blue and hears a voice speaking. In the epistles Paul pictures Him seated at the Father's right hand with an authority greater than any other. All the power He has is placed at the disposal of His followers on the earth. He Himself is above in the glory.[55]  But in this very end of the Book John is given a _new sight of Christ_. He sees Him _as He is now_. That is to say, this is the sight of Christ as He is now _characteristically_. It is the distinctive sight that stands out above all these others.  He _is_ at one's right hand in closest personal relation, through His Holy Spirit. He _is_ at the Father's right hand in glory waiting expectantly till the time is ripe for the next direct move on the earth. But there's more than these. There's a sight of Him that overshadows these. It is the characteristic sight that lets us see Him as He is peculiarly _now_ in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23050"],["title","Peter Biddulph: The Story of an Australian Settler (#0)"],["body","Biddulph, by W.H.G.

THE SETTLER'S EARLY DAYS.  From my earliest days to the present time I have been gradually climbing up the ladder towards a comfortable berth on the top; and if a ratlin has given way beneath my feet, I always have had a firm hold above my head.  The first step I took was off the mud on to dry ground.  I can recollect nothing clearly before that time.  I was born on board a river barge, and never left it, winter nor summer, till I was fully six years old.  One day the barge took the mud, which is not surprising, considering that I was the only person on deck.  I ran to the helm to turn her head off the shore, but it was too late--there she stuck hard and fast.  My mother was below, tending my father, and he lay dying.  It was the barge's last voyage, and his too.  Both had seen much service. The barge never moved again, but went on rotting and rotting till the owner sold her and she was broken up.  Father died that night, and a boat came and took mother and me on shore, with father's body, and such property as we possessed--not much, I fancy,--a kettle and pot, some plates, and knives, and cups, and a few clothes,--we hadn't wanted furniture, and with these mother and I had to begin the world.  She said things might have been worse, for she might have had a dozen children instead of one, and debts to pay--and she didn't owe a farthing, which was a great comfort in her affliction.  My mother was indeed, while she lived, a very good mother to me, for she taught me to distinguish right from wrong, to love the former and to hate the latter.  As may be supposed, she was very poor, and I was often without a meal.  I know, too, that she frequently stinted herself to give me food.  She lived on the banks of the Thames somewhere below London, and I very soon found my way down to the mud, where I now and then used to pick up odds and ends, bits of iron and copper, and sometimes even coin, and chips of wood.  The first my mother used to sell, and I often got enough in the week to buy us a hearty meal; the last served to boil our kettle when we had any food to cook in it.  Few rich people know how the poor live; our way was a strange one.  My poor mother used to work with her needle, and go out as a charwoman, and to wash, when she could get any one to wash for, but that was seldom; and toil as hard as she might, a difficult matter she had to pay the rent of the little room in which we lived.  She felt sorely the struggle she had to endure with poverty, for she had seen better days--far better, I suspect,--and was not accustomed to it.  She was, I have reason to believe, well educated--at all events, much above most persons in the station in life she then occupied; and, young as I was, she taught me to read, and to repeat poetry, and to sing psalms; and though I forget nearly all the events of my life at that time, I remember many of the verses she taught me; they have been a wonderful comfort to me through life.  My mother had married unwisely, I have no doubt, and if she ever had any relations, they discarded her; so she was very soon reduced to the condition I have described, aided by an illness which at length terminated in her death.  I was about eight years old when I became an orphan; but my intellects were sharpened by exercise, and I was as precocious as many children double my age.  As I was able to do something to gain my own livelihood, the people of the house where we lodged took compassion on me, and, instead of sending me to the workhouse, gave me the corner of a garret to sleep in.  I understood the compact, and worked harder than ever.  Young as I was I felt my mother's loss most bitterly.  We had been all in all to each other, and I should have broken down altogether with grief, had not my kind host roused me up and advised me to go out and try and do something to gain my livelihood.  Hunger is a severe taskmaster; it makes many an idle man work.  I now became a regular mudlark, though I got employment when I could by running on errands and in assisting the boatmen on the river.  I was one summer's day, with a number of other boys, wading up to my knees in the water, when a boat with several gentlemen on a pleasure excursion came down the river, and pulled into the shore near where we were.  Some of the gentlemen landed, while the others who remained in the boat amused themselves by throwing halfpence into the water for us to dive after. They scattered them about in every direction, so that many coins were altogether lost; for as the boys rushed after them they drove them into the mud.  At last, as I was standing some way from the other boys, a gentleman threw a penny towards me; but it passed over my head and fell into deep water, and directly afterwards I heard him exclaim--  \"Dear me!  I've lost my ring--my diamond ring, too.  I would not have lost it for a hundred pounds.\"  As he had been throwing pence in various directions, he had no notion where it had fallen, though he naturally concluded that it had come off at one of those times.  As I saw that he was very much annoyed at his loss I felt sorry for him; so I went up to him, and told him that I would hunt about for his ring, and that if I found it I would gladly bring it to him, provided he would tell me where he lived.  \"But don't you bargain for a reward?\" asked one of his companions.  \"That depends upon how far off the gentleman lives,\" I replied.  \"If near at hand this errand may be only worth a sixpence; but if far off, perhaps he won't think a shilling too much to give me.\"  \"I'll tell you what, my man; I'll gladly give you ten shillings if you find it; but I fear there is little chance of your so doing,\" replied the gentleman, smiling.  \"There's nothing like trying, sir,\" I replied; \"and if you'll tell me your name and where you live, if I pick it up you shall have it again.\"  \"Well, then, you must inquire for Mr Wells, -- Street, -- Square, London,\" said the gentleman.  \"If you write it down I shall have less chance of forgetting it,\" I replied.  \"That would be little use to you, my man,\" he observed; \"you cannot read, I should suppose.\"  \"But I can, though,\" I replied.  \"Give me your card, and you will see I speak the truth.\"  On this one of the gentlemen drew out a card from his pocket, and wrote some words on it with a pencil, while I washed my hands and dried them in my shirt-sleeves.  He then handed me the card.  I looked at it and saw that it was in a language I could not understand.  \"Those are Latin words, and I did not say I could read any language,\" I observed, handing him back his card.  \"You are right, my boy,\" said the gentleman who had lost his ring; \"but here are some lines in English: let us hear if you can read them.\"  I looked at the lines attentively: they were at the commencement of a poem my mother had taught me; so I not only read them off fluently, but, to the great surprise of all present, went on repeating the succeeding ones.  \"Bravo! bravo!\" exclaimed the gentlemen, highly delighted.  \"You're a genius, my lad--a perfect marvel.  A mudlark spout poetry!  Truly the schoolmaster is abroad.\"  \"Who taught you your learning, my boy?\" asked another.  \"My mother, sir,\" I replied, calmly, and rather surprised at their expressions, for I saw nothing wonderful in my performance.  \"I should like to see this mother of yours; she must be out of the common way too,\" observed the same person.  \"Mother is dead, sir,\" I answered, crying; for the very mention of her name wrung my young heart with grief.  \"There is something more here than meets the eye,\" said Mr Wells.  \"My poor boy, don't cry.  Come to-morrow to my house, whether you find my ring or not.  In the meantime here is half a crown; your poetry deserves it.\"  I took the money almost mechanically; for I was thinking of my mother, and was scarcely aware of the amount of wealth I was receiving.  On seeing Mr Wells give me money, the other gentlemen did the same, and some even gave me as much as five shillings; so that I felt as if coin was raining down on me from the skies.  My tears dried up, and, for a minute, I felt supremely happy; but on a sudden the thought occurred to me, that if my mother had been alive how happy it would have made her, and I burst forth into tears again.  Mr Wells on this asked me why I cried; so I told him the truth, and he believed me; though I believe, from the expression of some of the other gentlemen's faces, that they fancied I was crying to gain their compassion: at all events,"]]]
