He turned to his cousins. \"Why can't we take turns in carrying him, either on our backs or on a litter?\"  \"I think we had better try to make some sort of litter of pine boughs,\" answered Jack. \"It will be much easier for the four of us to do the carrying than for one.\"  \"I've got a hatchet in my game bag, and you can cut some pine boughs with that. And you will find some cord in my game bag, too.\"  \"How did the accident happen, if I may ask?\" questioned Randy, while Jack began to trim several large boughs from the fallen pine.  \"It came quicker'n lightning,\" was the old lumberman's answer. \"I had just spotted a fine, fat rabbit, and was taking aim, when, without warning, the tree gave a sudden snap like the report of a gun, and down it came right on top of me. Of course, I tried to jump out of the way, but my foot caught on a tree root, or a rock, or something, and down I went, and the next minute the tree came down on top of me, right across my legs and my left arm, like when you found me. I tried to pull myself loose, but my legs and my arm seemed to be wedged down between the tree and some stones, and I couldn't budge nary a one of 'em.\"  \"I guess you can be thankful that you didn't break your arm or your legs.\"  \"I suppose that's true, my boy. Just the same, I suppose this will lay me up for a week or two, and maybe longer,\" answered Barney Stevenson, dubiously.  Having cut several pine boughs that looked as if they might answer the purpose, the four boys lost no time in twisting them together and then tying them into a rude litter. Across this they laid additional pine boughs, and upon these placed the form of the hurt man. When they moved him he shut his teeth hard, evidently to keep from crying out with pain.  \"I know it must hurt you, Mr. Stevenson,\" said Jack kindly. \"We'll be just as careful as possible.\"  \"I know you'll be, my lads. I suppose I ought to have a doctor, but if I can get to Bill Hobson's cabin, I guess I'll be all right. Bill will most likely have some liniment, and that will fix me up.\"  With the old lumberman resting on the litter and the four youths carrying this as carefully as possible, the party made its way along the Rick Rack River, which at this point was little better than a mountain torrent. They had considerable difficulty in climbing over the rocks and in making their way through the heavy brushwood, but finally they came out to a cleared space, beyond which there were only scattered patches of trees.  \"I see some smoke!\" cried Fred presently.  \"That must be the smoke from Bill Hobson's place,\" announced the old lumberman, and then he closed his eyes once more and lay back on the litter, for the pain he was suffering was great.  Keeping on in the direction where they had seen the smoke, they soon came in sight of a fairly large cabin with a lean-to attached. They marched up to the place, and Jack rapped upon the door, which was opened a moment later by a burly man, well along in years.  \"What do you want?\" began the man, and then looked past Jack to the litter and the old lumberman lying on it. \"What's this? Why, it's Uncle Barney, I declare! What's happened?\"  \"I got hurt by a falling tree, Bill,\" was the reply. \"And if it hadn't been for these cadets, I might be layin' down in the woods yet.\"  \"He is quite a bit hurt,\" explained Jack. \"You had better let us carry him in and place him on a couch or a bed of some kind.\"  \"Surest thing you know, young man,\" answered Bill Hobson. \"Fetch him right in,\" and he turned to make a bunk ready for the sufferer.  Fortunately the cabin was well warmed, so that as soon as they had Barney Stevenson safe inside, they lost no time in taking off some of his clothing and examining his hurts. The other old lumberman, assisted by Jack, did this, and Hobson examined the condition of his friend with care.  \"I can't see that anything is broken,\" he announced; \"but those bruises are pretty bad. I think I'll bathe 'em with hot water, and then put on some liniment and bind 'em up.\"  \"I guess I'll have to stay right where I am for a spell, Bill,\" said the hurt man.  \"That's what, Uncle Barney. And you're welcome to stay as long as you please,\" announced the owner of the cabin. The boys had brought along the old lumberman's game bag and shotgun.  Bill Hobson wanted to know the particulars of the affair, and the Rover boys related how they had come up into the woods to hunt and heard Barney Stevenson's cries for assistance, and how they had liberated him and brought him along on the litter.  \"I'm very thankful indeed to you,\" said Barney Stevenson, and his face showed his gratitude. \"If I can ever do you boys a good turn, believe me, I'll do it.\"  \"Didn't you say you lived on Snowshoe Island?\" queried Jack.  \"Yes.\"  \"I've heard of the place, but I don't know exactly where it is located or why they call it Snowshoe Island.\"  \"It's a big island located almost in the middle of Lake Monona,\" answered the old lumberman. \"I own the place, and it's called Snowshoe Island because some years ago a number of Indians lived on it and made their living by making snowshoes. The Indians are all gone now.\"  \"I guess, Uncle Barney, you've lived on that island a good number of years,\" put in Bill Hobson.  \"Twelve years coming this Christmas,\" was the reply. \"I went there the day after my wife was buried,\" and the old lumberman's face clouded as if the memory of what had happened was still bitter.  \"Do you do any lumbering there?\" questioned Randy, more to change the subject than for any other reason.  \"Oh, yes; I do quite some lumbering during the season. I have a firm in the city that sends up there every year for all the stuff I cut. At this time of year. I like to go out hunting. It's the one sport that I thoroughly enjoy. And I reckon you boys enjoy it, too, or you wouldn't be out with your guns.\"  \"Yes, we like to go hunting once in a while.\"  \"Well, now, listen to me, boys. You saved my life out there in the woods, and if I was real well off, I'd try to reward you for it. But, as it is----\"  \"We don't want any reward,\" broke in Jack quickly.  \"I know you don't--you're not that kind. And I'm not going to offend you by offering it. Just the same, if you ever feel like coming over to Snowshoe Island and paying me a visit, I'll treat you as well as I know how.\"  \"Maybe we might be able to go over there and do some hunting some time,\" suggested Andy.  \"Yes, you come over some time and stay a few days or a week with me, and I'll give you the best time hunting I can,\" answered Barney Stevenson.  \"By the way, Mr. Stevenson,\" said Jack curiously, \"do you know a Mr. Frederic Stevenson?\" Jack had learned from Ruth that that was her father's name.  At this unexpected question, the old lumberman opened wide his eyes and glared at the young cadet.  \"Yes, I know him--very well,\" he growled. \"But I don't want to hear anything about him--not a word! Is he a friend of yours?\"  \"He is the father of one of the young ladies who is a pupil at Clearwater Hall.\"  \"Oh, I see! Humph! Well, I don't want to hear anything about Fred Stevenson, and if you want to be friends with me, you needn't mention his name to me again,\" went on the old lumberman, much to the surprise of the Rover boys.     CHAPTER VI  DEEP IN THE WOODS   \"What do you suppose was the reason that old lumberman didn't want to hear Mr. Stevenson's name mentioned?\" questioned Randy of Jack, about half an hour later, when the four cadets were tramping through the woods again to resume their hunting.  \"I'm sure I don't know, Randy,\" was the slow reply. \"Evidently he was very bitter over something.\"  \"Having the same name, it looks to me as if this Uncle Barney, as they call him, might be some relative of Ruth's family,\" said Fred.  \"More than likely.\"  \"Maybe he's some cast-off relation, who got into trouble with them and then took himself off to that Snowshoe Island,\" was Fred's comment.  \"I'd have asked him some more questions if he hadn't acted so ugly about it,\" went on Jack.  \"Yes. But he seemed to be a very nice sort of man otherwise,\" put in Andy quickly.  \"I agree with you there.\" Jack gave a little sigh. \"There must be some mystery to it.\"  \"Why don't you ask Ruth about it some time?\"  \"I will, when I get a good chance to do it. Of course, if it's some sort of family affair, I'm not going to butt in.\"  Before the Rover boys had left the cabin of Bill Hobson, they had been assured by old Uncle Barney that he was feeling fairly comfortable and that the owner of the place would look after him until he recovered. Barney Stevenson had mentioned Snowshoe Island several times, and had told the boys again that he was sorry he could not reward them for coming to his assistance, but that if they ever cared to visit his island, he would do his best to make them feel at home and show them where the best hunting in that vicinity was to be had. He had also mentioned the fact that there was a vacant cabin close to his own on the island, and that they would be welcome to camp out there at any time they chose to do so.  \"I'd like to visit his place some time,\" said Fred, \"just to see how the old fellow lives. I'll bet he's got quite a comfortable outfit there.\"  \"He may live in very queer style,\" returned Randy. \"According to what he says, and what that Bill Hobson told me, he must be a good deal of a hermit.\"  \"Maybe he committed some sort of crime and the other Stevensons cast him off,\" suggested Andy.  \"Oh, I can't think that! He didn't look to be a criminal,\" returned Jack. \"Don't you remember what he said about taking up his residence on the island after his wife died? Maybe that loss made him feel as if he didn't want to mingle with the rest of the world.\"  The boys talked the matter over for some time, but could reach no conclusion whatever regarding the way the old lumberman had"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22996"],["title","The Rover Boys on Snowshoe Island; or, The Old Lumberman's Treasure Box (#7)"],["body"," when Frederic Stevenson's name had been mentioned. Then, however, they stirred up some more squirrels and rabbits, and in the excitement of the chase that subject, for the time being, was forgotten.  They had brought a lunch with them, and at noon they found a convenient spot and there built a small campfire, over which they made themselves a can of hot chocolate, and this, with some sandwiches and some doughnuts, constituted the repast. Andy wanted to take time to clean a couple of the squirrels and cook them, but Jack and the others were afraid this would take too long, and so the idea had to be abandoned.  \"Gee! but this tramping through the woods gives a fellow an appetite!\" cried Andy, after he had eaten his second sandwich and his third doughnut. \"I could eat a whole rabbit or a squirrel myself.\" And then, feeling in fine fettle, he proceeded to pull himself up on a near-by tree limb and \"skin the cat,\" as it is called by acrobatic boys.  \"You look out, young man, that you don't tumble down on your head,\" warned Jack. \"This ground around here is frozen pretty hard.\"  \"If I tumble, I know where I'll land,\" cried Andy gleefully; and, swinging himself back and forth on the tree limb, he suddenly let go and came down straight on Jack's shoulders. Both went down in the snow, and there rolled over and over, each trying to get the better of the other. Then Fred commenced to snowball the fallen pair, and Randy joined in; and a moment later there began a snowball fight on the part of all four which lasted about ten minutes.  \"Cease firing!\" cried Fred at last, as he dug some of the snow out of his left ear. \"If this is going to be a snowballing contest, all right; but I thought we were out to do some hunting.\"  \"Fred surrenders, and the war is over!\" cried Jack.  \"Hoist the milk-blue flag and call it off!\" burst out Andy gleefully. \"Throw the snowballs into the ice-cream freezer and season to taste!\"  After that the four young hunters packed up their belongings and saw to it that the campfire was completely extinguished. Then they continued on their tramp in the vicinity of the Rick Rack River.  \"I'm getting tired of hanging around this watercourse,\" said Fred finally. \"I believe the reports of our guns have driven all the remaining game away. Why can't we strike off into the woods yonder and come in on the other side of Haven Point?\"  They noted the position of the sun with care, and then struck off at right angles to the river. Soon they found themselves going up hill and presently struck a lumberman's trail leading down in the direction of the town. Here, however, after two hours of hunting, they failed to find any game whatever.  \"We didn't improve things by coming over here,\" grumbled Andy.  \"Now I guess we had better be thinking of getting back to the school,\" said Jack, as he consulted his watch. They had been told that they must return in time for the evening meal.  \"All right, I'm ready to go,\" came from Fred. \"Gosh! I wish I had a horse to ride, or something.\" The many miles of tramping had wearied him greatly.  \"My left foot is beginning to hurt me a little,\" put in Randy. \"I slipped on the rocks this morning when we were carrying that old Uncle Barney. I didn't think much of it at the time, but now it's growing quite lame.\"  \"You can walk on it, can't you?\" questioned Jack anxiously.  \"Oh, yes, I can walk; but I can't go any too fast--or any too far, either.\"  The boys had done their best to keep track of where they were going, and now they turned in what they thought was the direction of Haven Point. But, as my young readers may have heard, it is an easy matter to lose one's sense of direction in the woods, and before they knew it, they found themselves in a locality that was entirely strange to them.  \"We don't seem to be getting much closer to town,\" announced Fred presently. \"I don't see a farmhouse of any sort in sight.\"  They had gone but a short distance when they stirred up several more rabbits, and had the pleasure of bringing two of the creatures down. Then they came to a small clearing, and beyond this some farm fields.  \"Now we must be getting to somewhere,\" announced Randy; and a few minutes later a turn of the road brought them in sight of a farmhouse. Here they saw a farmer coming from a cowshed with a pail of foaming milk, and accosted him.  \"Sure, you're on the road to Haven Point,\" answered the farmer, in reply to their question. \"It's about two miles and a half from here. But do you want to go to the Point or to Colby Hall?\" he went on, noticing their uniforms.  \"We want to get to the Hall--and by as short a route as possible,\" answered Jack.  \"Then the best thing you lads can do is to come right through my lane here and go across the back field. Then you will come out on the road that runs from the Hall to Carwell. I guess you know that?\"  \"Oh, yes; we know that road,\" returned Randy.  The cadets thanked the farmer for his information, and lost no time in following his directions. Soon they came out on the other highway, and then started forward as rapidly as their somewhat weary legs would permit.  When they reached the vicinity of Colby Hall Jack found, by again consulting his watch, that they were almost three-quarters of an hour late.  \"Let's see if we can't slide in without any of the teachers seeing us,\" suggested Andy.  \"Oh, I don't know that we've got to do that, Andy,\" returned Jack. \"We haven't done anything wrong.\"  \"Well, we are late, and you know some of the teachers won't stand for that.\"  \"We had permission to go hunting, and we couldn't help it getting lost up there in the woods,\" answered his twin.  They were just about to enter one of the side doors of the Hall, when it was flung open and they found themselves confronted by one of the younger teachers, accompanied by Professor Lemm. They stepped to one side to let the teachers pass.  \"Yes, as I remarked before, Tompkins, unless you have strict discipline in that class----\" Asa Lemm was saying, when, of a sudden, he happened to glance at the cadets and recognized the Rovers. \"What are you doing here? Where have you been?\" he demanded, coming to an abrupt halt.  \"We've been out hunting, sir,\" answered Jack.  \"Hunting, eh?\" And as was usual with him, Asa Lemm drew down the corners of his mouth.  \"We had permission from Colonel Colby to go,\" put in Randy.  \"Ah, well, in that case----\" Asa Lemm paused for a moment. \"Did he say you could stay out as late as this?\" he added suddenly.  \"We had permission to stay out until supper time,\" answered Jack.  \"Don't you know it is an hour after that time now, Rover?\"  \"Three-quarters of an hour, Professor. We might have been on time, only my cousin here slipped on the rocks and hurt his ankle, and that has delayed us a little.\"  \"Humph! always some excuse! You boys have got to learn to be on time. You'll never get through life unless you are punctual. I shall mention the fact of your being late to Colonel Colby. Now go in at once, and if you are too late to get anything to eat, it will be your own fault;\" and thus speaking, Asa Lemm moved on with the other teacher.  \"Oh, but he's the sourest old lemon that ever grew!\" was Andy's comment.  \"You never said anything truer than that, Andy,\" answered his twin.     CHAPTER VII  AN UNEXPECTED MEETING   \"Say, fellows, did you ever hear this song?\"  It was Ned Lowe who spoke. He sat in one of the rooms belonging to the Rovers. On his knee rested a mandolin which he had been strumming furiously for the past ten minutes.  \"Sure we've heard it, Ned!\" cried Andy. \"What is it?\"  \"For gracious sake, Ned! why don't you let up?\" cried Fred, who was in the next room trying his best to study. \"How in the world is a fellow going to do an example in algebra with you singing about good times on the old plantation?\"  \"That is right, Ned. Why don't you sing about good times in the classroom when Asa Lemm is there?\"  \"Gee Christopher! what's the use of your throwing cold water on this camp meeting?\" came from Walt Baxter, who sat on the edge of the bed munching an apple.  \"Really, it's a shame the way you young gentlemen attempt to choke off Ned's efforts to please this congregation!\" exclaimed Spouter Powell, who sat in an easy chair with his feet resting on the edge of a chiffonier. \"Now, when a man's soul is overflowing with harmony, and beautiful thoughts are coursing through his cranium, and he is doing his utmost to bring pleasure----\"  \"Wow! Spouter is at it again! Somebody choke him off!\" cried Randy, and catching up a pillow, he threw it at the head of the cadet who loved to make long speeches.  \"Say, fellows, why won't some of you let me get a word in edgeways?\" came from Dan Soppinger, who stood with his back against the door leading to the hall. \"I've been wanting to ask you a question for the last ten minutes. Who of you can tell me the names of the fifth, tenth, and fifteenth presidents of our country?\"  \"Oh, baby!\" wailed Andy, throwing up his hands in comic despair. \"Dan is worse than either Spouter or Ned.\"  \"I thought you were going to put a padlock on that question box of yours, Dan,\" remarked Fred.  \"I'll bet there isn't one of you can answer my question,\" retorted Dan Soppinger.  \"Sure! I can answer it!\" returned Andy readily. \"What was that question? Who was the first laundryman in Chicago?\"  \"No; I said, who were the fifth, the tenth, and the fifteenth----\"  \"Oh! I remember now--the fifth, tenth and fifteenth discoverers of the North Pole. That's easy, Dan. The fifth was Julius Cæsar, the tenth, Benjamin Frank----\"  \"See here! I didn't say a word about the North Pole discoverers!\" ejaculated the Human Question Box. \"I said the fifth, tenth and fifteenth----\"  \"Men to find out how to manufacture oleomargarine out of pure butter,\" finished Andy. \"Now that's a purely scientific problem, Dan, not an ordinary question. You want to take three pounds of oleomargarine and divide them by two pounds of unadulterated butter, then----\"  \"For"]]]
