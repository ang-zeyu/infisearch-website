Not the less solemn was my vow       Because unheard, and oh! the sin     Will not be less, if I should now       Deny the feeling felt within.     Unwedded to my dying day       I must, my father dear, remain;     'Tis well, if so thou will'st, but say       Can man balk Fate, or break its chain?      \"If Fate so rules, that I should feel       The miseries of a widow's life,     Can man's device the doom repeal?       Unequal seems to be a strife,     Between Humanity and Fate;       None have on earth what they desire;     Death comes to all or soon or late;       And peace is but a wandering fire;     Expediency leads wild astray;       The Right must be our guiding star;     Duty our watchword, come what may;       Judge for me, friends,--as wiser far.\"      She said, and meekly looked to both.       The father, though he patient heard,     To give the sanction still seemed loth,       But Narad Muni took the word.     \"Bless thee, my child! 'Tis not for us       To question the Almighty will,     Though cloud on cloud loom ominous,       In gentle rain they may distil.\"     At this, the monarch--\"Be it so!       I sanction what my friend approves;     All praise to Him, whom praise we owe;       My child shall wed the youth she loves.\"   PART II.      Great joy in Madra. Blow the shell       The marriage over to declare!     And now to forest-shades where dwell       The hermits, wend the wedded pair.     The doors of every house are hung       With gay festoons of leaves and flowers;     And blazing banners broad are flung,       And trumpets blown from castle towers!     Slow the procession makes its ground       Along the crowded city street:     And blessings in a storm of sound       At every step the couple greet.      Past all the houses, past the wall,       Past gardens gay, and hedgerows trim,     Past fields, where sinuous brooklets small       With molten silver to the brim     Glance in the sun's expiring light,       Past frowning hills, past pastures wild,     At last arises on the sight,       Foliage on foliage densely piled,     The woods primeval, where reside       The holy hermits;--henceforth here     Must live the fair and gentle bride:       But this thought brought with it no fear.      Fear! With her husband by her still?       Or weariness! Where all was new?     Hark! What a welcome from the hill!       There gathered are a hermits few.     Screaming the peacocks upward soar;       Wondering the timid wild deer gaze;     And from Briarean fig-trees hoar       Look down the monkeys in amaze     As the procession moves along;       And now behold, the bridegroom's sire     With joy comes forth amid the throng;--       What reverence his looks inspire!      Blind! With his partner by his side!       For them it was a hallowed time!     Warmly they greet the modest bride       With her dark eyes and front sublime!     One only grief they feel.--Shall she       Who dwelt in palace halls before,     Dwell in their huts beneath the tree?       Would not their hard life press her sore;--     The manual labour, and the want       Of comforts that her rank became,     Valkala robes, meals poor and scant,       All undermine the fragile frame?      To see the bride, the hermits' wives       And daughters gathered to the huts,     Women of pure and saintly lives!       And there beneath the betel-nuts     Tall trees like pillars, they admire       Her beauty, and congratulate     The parents, that their hearts' desire       Had thus accorded been by Fate,     And Satyavan their son had found       In exile lone, a fitting mate:     And gossips add,--good signs abound;       Prosperity shall on her wait.      Good signs in features, limbs, and eyes,       That old experience can discern,     Good signs on earth and in the skies,       That it could read at every turn.     And now with rice and gold, all bless       The bride and bridegroom,--and they go     Happy in others' happiness,       Each to her home, beneath the glow     Of the late risen moon that lines       With silver, all the ghost-like trees,     Sals, tamarisks, and South-Sea pines,       And palms whose plumes wave in the breeze.      False was the fear, the parents felt,       Savitri liked her new life much;     Though in a lowly home she dwelt       Her conduct as a wife was such     As to illumine all the place;       She sickened not, nor sighed, nor pined;     But with simplicity and grace       Discharged each household duty kind.     Strong in all manual work,--and strong       To comfort, cherish, help, and pray,     The hours past peacefully along       And rippling bright, day followed day.      At morn Satyavan to the wood       Early repaired and gathered flowers     And fruits, in its wild solitude,       And fuel,--till advancing hours     Apprised him that his frugal meal       Awaited him. Ah, happy time!     Savitri, who with fervid zeal       Had said her orisons sublime,     And fed the Bramins and the birds,       Now ministered. Arcadian love,     With tender smiles and honeyed words,       All bliss of earth thou art above!      And yet there was a spectre grim,       A skeleton in Savitri's heart,     Looming in shadow, somewhat dim,       But which would never thence depart.     It was that fatal, fatal speech       Of Narad Muni. As the days     Slipt smoothly past, each after each,       In private she more fervent prays.     But there is none to share her fears,       For how could she communicate     The sad cause of her bidden tears?       The doom approached, the fatal date.      No help from man. Well, be it so!       No sympathy,--it matters not!     God can avert the heavy blow!       He answers worship. Thus she thought.     And so, her prayers, by day and night,       Like incense rose unto the throne;     Nor did she vow neglect or rite       The Veds enjoin or helpful own.     Upon the fourteenth of the moon,       As nearer came the time of dread,     In Joystee, that is May or June,       She vowed her vows and Bramins fed.      And now she counted e'en the hours,       As to Eternity they past;     O'er head the dark cloud darker lowers,       The year is rounding full at last.     To-day,--to-day,--with doleful sound       The word seem'd in her ear to ring!     O breaking heart,--thy pain profound       Thy husband knows not, nor the king,     Exiled and blind, nor yet the queen;       But One knows in His place above.     To-day,--to-day,--it will be seen       Which shall be victor, Death or Love!      Incessant in her prayers from morn,       The noon is safely tided,--then     A gleam of faint, faint hope is born,       But the heart fluttered like a wren     That sees the shadow of the hawk       Sail on,--and trembles in affright,     Lest a down-rushing swoop should mock       Its fortune, and o'erwhelm it quite.     The afternoon has come and gone       And brought no change;--should she rejoice?     The gentle evening's shades come on,       When hark!--She hears her husband's voice!      \"The twilight is most beautiful!       Mother, to gather fruit I go,     And fuel,--for the air is cool       Expect me in an hour or so.\"     \"The night, my child, draws on apace,\"       The mother's voice was heard to say,     \"The forest paths are hard to trace       In darkness,--till the morrow stay.\"     \"Not hard for me, who can discern       The forest-paths in any hour,     Blindfold I could with ease return,       And day has not yet lost its power.\"      \"He goes then,\" thought Savitri, \"thus       With unseen bands Fate draws us on     Unto the place appointed us;       We feel no outward force,--anon     We go to marriage or to death       At a determined time and place;     We are her playthings; with her breath       She blows us where she lists in space.     What is my duty? It is clear,       My husband I must follow; so,     While he collects his forest gear       Let me permission get to go.\"      His sire she seeks,--the blind old king,       And asks from him permission straight.     \"My daughter, night with ebon wing       Hovers above; the hour is late.     My son is active, brave, and strong,       Conversant with the woods, he knows     Each path; methinks it would be wrong       For thee to venture where he goes,     Weak and defenceless as thou art,       At such a time. If thou wert near     Thou might'st embarrass him, dear heart,       Alone, he would not have a fear.\"      So spake the hermit-monarch blind,       His wife too, entering in, exprest     The self-same thoughts in words as kind,       And begged Savitri hard, to rest.     \"Thy recent fasts and vigils, child,       Make thee unfit to undertake     This journey to the forest wild.\"       But nothing could her purpose shake.     She urged the nature of her vows,       Required her now the rites were done     To follow where her loving spouse       Might e'en a chance of danger run.      \"Go then, my child,--we give thee leave,       But with thy husband quick return,     Before the flickering shades of eve       Deepen to night, and planets burn,     And forest-paths become obscure,       Lit only by their doubtful rays.     The gods, who guard all women pure,       Bless thee and kept thee in thy ways,     And safely bring thee and thy lord!\"       On this she left, and swiftly ran     Where with his saw in lieu of sword,       And basket, plodded"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23245"],["title","Ancient Ballads and Legends of Hindustan (#4)"],["body","yavan.      Oh, lovely are the woods at dawn,       And lovely in the sultry noon,     But loveliest, when the sun withdrawn       The twilight and a crescent moon     Change all asperities of shape,       And tone all colours softly down,     With a blue veil of silvered crape!       Lo! By that hill which palm-trees crown,     Down the deep glade with perfume rife       From buds that to the dews expand,     The husband and the faithful wife       Pass to dense jungle,--hand in hand.      Satyavan bears beside his saw       A forkèd stick to pluck the fruit,     His wife, the basket lined with straw;       He talks, but she is almost mute,     And very pale. The minutes pass;       The basket has no further space,     Now on the fruits they flowers amass       That with their red flush all the place     While twilight lingers; then for wood       He saws the branches of the trees,     The noise, heard in the solitude,       Grates on its soft, low harmonies.      And all the while one dreadful thought       Haunted Savitri's anxious mind,     Which would have fain its stress forgot;       It came as chainless as the wind,     Oft and again: thus on the spot       Marked with his heart-blood oft comes back     The murdered man, to see the clot!       Death's final blow,--the fatal wrack     Of every hope, whence will it fall?       For fall, by Narad's words, it must;     Persistent rising to appall       This thought its horrid presence thrust.      Sudden the noise is hushed,--a pause!       Satyavan lets the weapon drop--     Too well Savitri knows the cause,       He feels not well, the work must stop.     A pain is in his head,--a pain       As if he felt the cobra's fangs,     He tries to look around,--in vain,       A mist before his vision hangs;     The trees whirl dizzily around       In a fantastic fashion wild;     His throat and chest seem iron-bound,       He staggers, like a sleepy child.      \"My head, my head!--Savitri, dear,       This pain is frightful. Let me lie     Here on the turf.\" Her voice was clear       And very calm was her reply,     As if her heart had banished fear:       \"Lean, love, thy head upon my breast,\"     And as she helped him, added--\"here,       So shall thou better breathe and rest.\"     \"Ah me, this pain,--'tis getting dark,       I see no more,--can this be death?     What means this, gods?--Savitri, mark,       My hands wax cold, and fails my breath.\"      \"It may be but a swoon.\" \"Ah! no--       Arrows are piercing through my heart,--     Farewell my love! for I must go,       This, this is death.\" He gave one start     And then lay quiet on her lap,       Insensible to sight and sound,     Breathing his last.... The branches flap       And fireflies glimmer all around;     His head upon her breast; his frame       Part on her lap, part on the ground,     Thus lies he. Hours pass. Still the same,       The pair look statues, magic-bound.   PART III.      Death in his palace holds his court,       His messengers move to and fro,     Each of his mission makes report,       And takes the royal orders,--Lo,     Some slow before his throne appear       And humbly in the Presence kneel:     \"Why hath the Prince not been brought here?       The hour is past; nor is appeal     Allowed against foregone decree;       There is the mandate with the seal!     How comes it ye return to me       Without him? Shame upon your zeal!\"      \"O King, whom all men fear,--he lies       Deep in the dark Medhya wood,     We fled from thence in wild surprise,       And left him in that solitude.     We dared not touch him, for there sits,       Beside him, lighting all the place,     A woman fair, whose brow permits       In its austerity of grace     And purity,--no creatures foul       As we seemed, by her loveliness,     Or soul of evil, ghost or ghoul,       To venture close, and far, far less      \"To stretch a hand, and bear the dead;       We left her leaning on her hand,     Thoughtful; no tear-drop had she shed,       But looked the goddess of the land,     With her meek air of mild command.\"--       \"Then on this errand I must go     Myself, and bear my dreaded brand,       This duty unto Fate I owe;     I know the merits of the prince,       But merit saves not from the doom     Common to man; his death long since       Was destined in his beauty's bloom.\"   PART IV.      As still Savitri sat beside       Her husband dying,--dying fast,     She saw a stranger slowly glide       Beneath the boughs that shrunk aghast.     Upon his head he wore a crown       That shimmered in the doubtful light;     His vestment scarlet reached low down,       His waist, a golden girdle dight.     His skin was dark as bronze; his face       Irradiate, and yet severe;     His eyes had much of love and grace,       But glowed so bright, they filled with fear.      A string was in the stranger's hand       Noosed at its end. Her terrors now     Savitri scarcely could command.       Upon the sod beneath a bough,     She gently laid her husband's head,       And in obeisance bent her brow.     \"No mortal form is thine,\"--she said,       \"Beseech thee say what god art thou?     And what can be thine errand here?\"       \"Savitri, for thy prayers, thy faith,     Thy frequent vows, thy fasts severe,       I answer,--list,--my name is Death.      \"And I am come myself to take       Thy husband from this earth away,     And he shall cross the doleful lake       In my own charge, and let me say     To few such honours I accord,       But his pure life and thine require     No less from me.\" The dreadful sword       Like lightning glanced one moment dire;     And then the inner man was tied,       The soul no bigger than the thumb,     To be borne onwards by his side:--       Savitri all the while stood dumb.      But when the god moved slowly on       To gain his own dominions dim,     Leaving the body there--anon       Savitri meekly followed him,     Hoping against all hope; he turned       And looked surprised. \"Go back, my child!\"     Pale, pale the stars above them burned,       More weird the scene had grown and wild;     \"It is not for the living--hear!       To follow where the dead must go,     Thy duty lies before thee clear,       What thou shouldst do, the Shasters show.      \"The funeral rites that they ordain       And sacrifices must take up     Thy first sad moments; not in vain       Is held to thee this bitter cup;     Its lessons thou shall learn in time!       All that thou _canst_ do, thou hast done     For thy dear lord. Thy love sublime       My deepest sympathy hath won.     Return, for thou hast come as far       As living creature may. Adieu!     Let duty be thy guiding star,       As ever. To thyself be true!\"      \"Where'er my husband dear is led,       Or journeys of his own free will,     I too must go, though darkness spread       Across my path, portending ill,     'Tis thus my duty I have read!       If I am wrong, oh! with me bear;     But do not bid me backward tread       My way forlorn,--for I can dare     All things but that; ah! pity me,       A woman frail, too sorely tried!     And let me, let me follow thee,       O gracious god,--whate'er betide.      \"By all things sacred, I entreat,       By Penitence that purifies,     By prompt Obedience, full, complete,       To spiritual masters, in the eyes     Of gods so precious, by the love       I bear my husband, by the faith     That looks from earth to heaven above,       And by thy own great name O Death,     And all thy kindness, bid me not       To leave thee, and to go my way,     But let me follow as I ought       Thy steps and his, as best I may.      \"I know that in this transient world       All is delusion,--nothing true;     I know its shows are mists unfurled       To please and vanish. To renew     Its bubble joys, be magic bound       In _Maya's_ network frail and fair,     Is not my aim! The gladsome sound       Of husband, brother, friend, is air     To such as know that all must die,       And that at last the time must come,     When eye shall speak no more to eye       And Love cry,--Lo, this is my sum.      \"I know in such a world as this       No one can gain his heart's desire,     Or pass the years in perfect bliss;       Like gold we must be tried by fire;     And each shall suffer as he acts       And thinks,--his own sad burden bear;     No friends can help,--his sins are facts       That nothing can annul or square,     And he must bear their consequence.       Can I my husband save by rites?     Ah, no,--that were a vain pretence,       Justice eternal strict requites.      \"He for his deeds shall get his due       As I for mine: thus here each soul     Is its own friend if it pursue       The right, and run straight for the goal;     But its own worst and direst foe       If it choose evil, and in tracks     Forbidden, for its pleasure go.       Who knows not this, true wisdom lacks,     Virtue should be the turn and end       Of every life, all else is vain,     Duty should be its dearest friend       If higher life, it would attain.\"      \"So sweet thy words ring on mine ear,       Gentle Savitri, that I fain     Would give some sign to make it clear       Thou hast not prayed to me in vain.     Satyavan's life I may not grant,       Nor take before its term thy life,     But I am not all adamant,       I feel for thee, thou faithful wife!     Ask thou aught else, and let it be       Some good thing for thyself or thine,     And I shall give it, child, to thee,       If any power on earth be mine.\"      \"Well be it so. My husband's sire,       Hath lost his sight and fair domain,     Give to his eyes their former fire,       And place him on his throne again.\"     \"It shall be done. Go back, my child,       The hour wears late, the wind feels cold,     The path becomes more weird and wild,       Thy feet are torn, there's blood, behold!     Thou feelest faint from weariness,       Oh try "]]]
