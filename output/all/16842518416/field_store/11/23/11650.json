But neither among the Benedictines was this roistering spirit at ease. He left them irregularly, but managed to escape punishment for his irregularity. At last, after various vicissitudes of occupation, he settled down as curate of Meudon, where (the place, however, is doubtful, as also the date) in 1553 he died. He was past fifty years of age before he finished the work which has made him famous.  This work is \"The Life of Gargantua and Pantagruel,\" a grotesque and nondescript production, founded, probably, on some prior romance or traditionary tale of giants. The narrative of Rabelais is a tissue of adventures shocking every idea of verisimilitude, and serving only as a vehicle for the strange humor of the writer. The work is replete with evidences of Rabelais's learning. It would be useless to attempt giving any abstract or analysis of a book which is simply a wild chaos of material jumbled together with little regard to logic, order, or method of whatever sort. We shall better represent its character by giving a few specimen extracts.  Rabelais begins his romance characteristically. According as you understand him here, you judge the spirit of the whole work. Either he now gives you a clew by which, amid the mazes of apparent sheer frivolity on his part, you may follow till you win your way to some veiled serious meaning that he had all the time, but never dared frankly to avow; or else he is playfully misleading you on a false scent, which, however long held to, will bring you out nowhere--in short, is quizzing you. Let the reader judge for himself. Here is the opening passage,--the \"Author's Prologue,\" it is called in the English translation executed by Sir Thomas Urquhart and Motteux; a version, by the way, which, with whatever faults of too much freedom, is the work of minds and consciences singularly sympathetic with the genius of the original; the English student is perhaps hardly at all at disadvantage, in comparison with the French, for the full appreciation of Rabelais:--       Most noble and illustrious drinkers, and you thrice precious      pockified blades (for to you, and none else, do I dedicate my      writings), Alcibiades, in that dialogue of Plato's which is      entitled, \"The Banquet,\" whilst he was setting forth the praises of      his schoolmaster Socrates (without all question the prince of      philosophers), amongst other discourses to that purpose said that      he resembled the Sileni. Sileni of old were little boxes, like      those we now may see in the shops of apothecaries, painted on the      outside with wanton toyish figures, as harpies, satyrs, bridled      geese, horned hares, saddled ducks, flying goats, thiller harts,      and other such counterfeited pictures, at pleasure, to excite      people unto laughter, as Silenus himself, who was the foster-father      of good Bacchus, was wont to do; but within those capricious      caskets called Sileni, were carefully preserved and kept many rich      and fine drugs, such as balm, ambergreese, amomon, musk, civet,      with several kinds of precious stones, and other things of great      price. Just such another thing was Socrates; for to have eyed his      outside, and esteemed of him by his exterior appearance, you would      not have given the peel of an onion for him, so deformed he was in      body, and ridiculous in his gesture.... Opening this box, you would      have found within it a heavenly and inestimable drug, a more than      human understanding, an admirable virtue, matchless learning,      invincible courage, inimitable sobriety, certain contentment of      mind, perfect assurance, and an incredible disregard of all that      for which men commonly do so much watch, run, sail, fight, travel,      toil, and turmoil themselves.       Whereunto (in your opinion) doth this little flourish of a preamble      tend? For so much as you, my good disciples, and some other jolly      fools of ease and leisure,... are too ready to judge, that there is      nothing in them but jests, mockeries, lascivious discourse, and      recreative lies;... therefore is it, that you must open the book,      and seriously consider of the matter treated in it. Then shall you      find that it containeth things of far higher value than the box did      promise; that is to say, that the subject thereof is not so      foolish, as by the title at the first sight it would appear to be.       ...Did you ever see a dog with a marrow-bone in his mouth?... Like      him, you must, by a sedulous lecture [reading], and frequent      meditation, break the bone, and suck out the marrow; that is, my      allegorical sense, or the things I to myself propose to be      signified by these Pythagorical symbols;... the most glorious      doctrines and dreadful mysteries, as well in what concerneth our      religion, as matters of the public state and life economical.  Up to this point, the candid reader has probably been conscious of a growing persuasion that this author must be at bottom a serious if also a humorous man,--a man, therefore, excusably intent not to be misunderstood as a mere buffoon. But now let the candid reader proceed with the following, and confess, upon his honor, if he is not scandalized and perplexed. What shall be said of a writer who thus plays with his reader?       Do you believe, upon your conscience, that Homer, whilst he was      couching his Iliad and Odyssey, had any thought upon those      allegories which Plutarch, Heraclides Ponticus, Eustathius,      Phornutus, squeezed out of him, and which Politian filched again      from them? If you trust it, with neither hand nor foot do you come      near to my opinion, which judgeth them to have been as little      dreamed of by Homer, as the gospel sacraments were by Ovid, in his      Metamorphoses; though a certain gulligut friar, and true      bacon-picker, would have undertaken to prove it, if, perhaps, he      had met with as very fools as himself, and, as the proverb says, \"a      lid worthy of such a kettle.\"       If you give any credit thereto, why do not you the same to these      jovial new Chronicles of mine? Albeit, when I did dictate them, I      thought thereof no more than you, who possibly were drinking the      whilst, as I was. For, in the composing of this lordly book, I      never lost nor bestowed any more, nor any other time, than what was      appointed to serve me for taking of my bodily refection; that is,      whilst I was eating and drinking. And, indeed, that is the fittest      and most proper hour, wherein to write these high matters and deep      sentences; as Homer knew very well, the paragon of all philologues,      and Ennius, the father of the Latin poets, as Horace calls him,      although a certain sneaking jobbernol alleged that his verses      smelled more of the wine than oil.  Does this writer quiz his reader, or, in good faith, give him a needed hint? Who shall decide?  We have let our first extract thus run on to some length, both for the reason that the passage is as representative as any we could properly offer of the quality of Rabelais, and also for the reason that the key of interpretation is here placed in the hand of the reader, for unlocking the enigma of this remarkable book. The extraordinary horse-play of pleasantry, which makes Rabelais unreadable for the general public of to-day, begins so promptly, affecting the very prologue, that we could not present even that piece of writing entire in our extract. We are informed that the circulation in England of the works of Rabelais, in translation, has been interfered with by the English government, on the ground of their indecency. We are bound to admit, that, if any writings whatever were to be suppressed on that ground, the writings of Rabelais are certainly entitled to be of the number. It is safe to say that never, no, not even in the boundless license of the comedy of Aristophanes, was more flagrant indecency, and indecency proportionately more redundant in volume, perpetrated in literature, than was done by Rabelais. Indecency, however, it is, rather than strict lasciviousness. Rabelais sinned against manners, more than he sinned against morals. But his obscenity is an ocean, without bottom or shore. Literally, he sticks at nothing that is coarse. Nay, this is absurdly short of expressing the fact. The genius of Rabelais teems with invention of coarseness, beyond what any one could conceive as possible, who had not taken his measure of possibility from Rabelais himself. And his diction was as opulent as his invention.  Such is the character of Rabelais the author. What, then, was it, if not fondness for paradox, that could prompt Coleridge to say, \"I could write a treatise in praise of the moral elevation of Rabelais' works, which would make the church stare and the conventicle groan, and yet would be truth, and nothing but the truth\"? If any thing besides fondness for paradox inspired Coleridge in saying this, it must, one would guess, have been belief on his part in the allegorical sense hidden deep underneath the monstrous mass of the Rabelaisian buffoonery. A more judicial sentence is that of Hallam, the historian of the literature of Europe: \"He [Rabelais] is never serious in a single page, and seems to have had little other aim, in his first two volumes, than to pour out the exuberance of his animal gayety.\"  The supply of animal gayety in this man was something portentous. One cannot, however, but feel that he forces it sometimes, as sometimes did Dickens those exhaustless animal spirits of his. A very common trick of the Rabelaisian humor is to multiply specifications, or alternative expressions, one after another, almost without end. From the second book of his romance,--an afterthought, probably, of continuation to his unexpectedly successful first book,--we take the last paragraph of the prologue, which shows this."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23033"],["title","Classic French Course in English (#6)"],["body"," The veracious historian makes obtestation of the strict truth of his narrative, and imprecates all sorts of evil upon such as do not believe it absolutely. We cleanse our extract a little:--       And, therefore, to make an end of this Prologue, even as I give      myself to an hundred thousand panniers-full of fair devils, body      and soul,... in case that I lie so much as one single word in this      whole history; after the like manner, St. Anthony's fire burn you,      Mahoom's disease whirl you, the squinance with a stitch in your      side, and the wolf in your stomach truss you, the bloody flux seize      upon you, the cursed sharp inflammations of wild fire, as slender      and thin as cow's hair strengthened with quicksilver, enter into      you,... and, like those of Sodom and Gomorrha, may you fall into      sulphur, fire, and bottomless pits, in case you do not firmly      believe all that I shall relate unto you in this present Chronicle.  So much for Rabelais's prologues. Our readers must now see something of what, under pains and penalties denounced so dire, they are bound to believe. We condense and defecate for this purpose the thirty-eighth chapter of the first book, which is staggeringly entitled, \"How Gargantua did eat up Six Pilgrims in a Sallad\":--       The story requireth that we relate that which happened unto six      pilgrims, who came from Sebastian near to Nantes; and who, for      shelter that night, being afraid of the enemy, had hid themselves      in the garden upon the chickling peas, among the cabbages and      lettuces. Gargantua, finding himself somewhat dry, asked whether      they could get any lettuce to make him a salad; and, hearing that      there were the greatest and fairest in the country,--for they were      as great as plum trees, or as walnut trees,--he would go thither      himself, and brought thence in his hand what he thought good, and      withal carried away the six pilgrims, who were in so great fear      that they did not dare to speak nor cough. Washing them, therefore,      first at the fountain, the pilgrims said one to another, softly,      \"What shall we do? We are almost drowned here amongst these      lettuce: shall we speak? But, if we speak, he will kill us for      spies.\" And, as they were thus deliberating what to do, Gargantua      put them, with the lettuce, into a platter of the house, as large      as the huge tun of the White Friars of the Cistertian order; which      done, with oil, vinegar, and salt, he ate them up, to refresh      himself a little before supper, and had already swallowed up five      of the pilgrims, the sixth being in the platter, totally hid under      a lettuce, except his bourbon, or staff, that appeared, and nothing      else. Which Grangousier [Gargantua's father] seeing, said to      Gargantua, \"I think that is the horn of a shell snail: do not eat      it.\"--\"Why not?\" said Gargantua; \"they are good all this month:\"      which he no sooner said, but, drawing up the staff, and therewith      taking up the pilgrim, he ate him very well, then drank a terrible      draught of excellent white wine. The pilgrims, thus devoured, made      shift to save themselves, as well as they could, by drawing their      bodies out of the reach of the grinders of his teeth, but could      not escape from thinking they had been put in the lowest dungeon of      a prison. And, when Gargantua whiffed the great draught, they      thought to have drowned in his mouth, and the flood of wine had      almost carried them away into the gulf of his stomach.      Nevertheless, skipping with their bourbons, as St. Michael's      palmers used to do, they sheltered themselves from the danger of      that inundation under the banks of his teeth. But one of them, by      chance, groping, or sounding the country with his staff, to try      whether they were in safety or no, struck hard against the cleft of      a hollow tooth, and hit the mandibulary sinew or nerve of the jaw,      which put Gargantua to very great pain, so that he began to cry for      the rage that he felt. To ease himself, therefore, of his smarting      ache, he called for his tooth-picker, and, rubbing towards a young      walnut-tree, where they lay skulking, unnestled you my gentlemen      pilgrims. For he caught one by the legs, another by the scrip,      another by the pocket, another by the scarf, another by the band of      the breeches; and the poor fellow that had hurt him with the      bourbon, him he hooked to him by [another part of his clothes]....      The pilgrims, thus dislodged, ran away.  Rabelais closes his story with jocose irreverent application of Scripture,--a manner of his which gives some color to the tradition of a biblical pun made by him on his death-bed.  The closest English analogue to Rabelais is undoubtedly Dean Swift. We probably never should have had \"Gulliver's Travels\" from Swift, if we had not first had Gargantua and Pantagruel from Rabelais. Swift, however, differs from Rabelais as well as resembles him. Whereas Rabelais is simply monstrous in invention, Swift in invention submits himself loyally to law. Give Swift his world of Liliput and Brobdingnag respectively, and all, after that, is quite natural and probable. The reduction or the exaggeration is made upon a mathematically calculated scale. For such verisimilitude Rabelais cares not a straw. His various inventions are recklessly independent one of another. A characteristic of Swift thus is scrupulous conformity to whimsical law. Rabelais is remarkable for whimsical disregard of even his own whimseys. Voltaire put the matter with his usual felicity,--Swift is Rabelais in his senses.  One of the most celebrated--justly celebrated--of Rabelais's imaginations is that of the Abbey of Thélème [Thelema]. This constitutes a kind of Rabelaisian Utopia. It was proper of the released monk to give his Utopian dream the form of an abbey, but an abbey in which the opposite should obtain of all that he had so heartily hated in his own monastic experience. A humorously impossible place and state was the Abbey of Thélème,--a kind of sportive Brook Farm set far away in a world unrealized. How those Thelemites enjoyed life, to be sure! It was like endless plum pudding--for everybody to eat, and nobody to prepare:--       All their life was spent not in laws, statutes, or rules, but      according to their own free will and pleasure. They rose out of      their beds when they thought good; they did eat, drink, labor,      sleep, when they had a mind to it, and were disposed for it. None      did awake them, none did offer to constrain them to eat, drink, nor      to do any other thing; for so had Gargantua established it. In all      their rule, and strictest tie of their order, there was but this      one clause to be observed,--        DO WHAT THOU WILT.        ...By this liberty they entered into a very laudable emulation, to      do all of them what they saw did please one. If any of the gallants      or ladies should say, Let us drink, they would all drink. If any      one of them said, Let us play, they all played. If one said, Let us      go a walking into the fields, they went all.... There was neither      he nor she amongst them, but could read, write, sing, play upon      several musical instruments, speak five or six several languages,      and compose in them all very quaintly, both in verse and prose.      Never were seen so valiant knights, so noble and worthy, so      dextrous and skilful both on foot and a horseback, more brisk and      lively, more nimble and quick, or better handling all manner of      weapons than were there. Never were seen ladies so proper and      handsome, so miniard and dainty, less forward, or more ready with      their hand, and with their needle, in every honest and free action      belonging to that sex, than were there. For this reason, when the      time came, that any man of the said abbey, either at the request of      his parents, or for some other cause, had a mind to go out of it,      he carried along with him one of the ladies, namely her who had      before that accepted him as her lover, and they were married      together.  The foregoing is one of the most purely sweet imaginative passages in Rabelais's works. The representation, as a whole, sheathes, of course, a keen satire on the religious houses. Real religion, Rabelais nowhere attacks.  The same colossal Gargantua who had that eating adventure with the six pilgrims, is made, in Rabelais's second book, to write his youthful son Pantagruel--also a giant, but destined to be, when mature, a model of all princely virtues--a letter on education, in which the most pious paternal exhortation occurs. The whole letter reads like some learned Puritan divine's composition. Here are a few specimen sentences:--       Fail not most carefully to peruse the books of the Greek, Arabian,      and Latin physicians, not despising the Talmudists and Cabalists;      and by frequent anatomies get thee the perfect knowledge of that      other world, called the microcosm, which is man. And at some of the      hours of the day apply thy mind to the study of the Holy      Scriptures: first, in Greek, the New Testament, with the Epistles      of the Apostles; and then the Old Testament in Hebrew. In brief,      let me see thee an abyss and bottomless pit of knowledge....       ...It behoveth thee to serve, to love, to fear God, and on him to      cast all thy thoughts and all thy hope, and, by faith formed in      charity, to cleave unto him, so that thou mayst never be separated      from him by thy sins. Suspect the abuses of the world. Set not thy      heart upon vanity, for this life is transitory; but the Word of the      Lord endureth forever.  \"Friar John\" is a mighty man of valor, who figures equivocally in the story of Gargantua and Pantagruel. The Abbey of Thélème is given him in reward of his services."]]]
