For preparing and mounting all small and medium size specimens I would advise the following list of tools. They will enable the worker to care for any of our native birds, quadrupeds up to the coyote, and any of our game heads, fur rugs, etc.      1 small skinning knife     1 medium skinning knife     1 larger skinning knife     1 pair scissors, fine points     1 pair shears, heavy, short     2 pairs flat nose pliers, large and small.     1 pair side or end cutters  [Illustration: HOME MADE TOOLS.  (1) Skin Scraper (made from screw driver) (2) (3) (4) Modeling Tools (wood and brass) (5) Setting Needle. (6) (7) Stuffers (heavy wire.)]      1 pair fine forceps, 5 or 6 inch     2 flat files, large and small     1 adjustable tool handle, assorted tools, awls.     2 pinking irons, 3/4 and 1-1/2 inch     Needles, assortment of cloth and glovers     Oilstone  If it is capable of taking and holding a good edge the small blade of a pocket knife is equal to a surgeon's scalpel and a sharp shoe or paring knife, ground to the proper shape, is a nice medium size for skinning or trimming skins. A hunting or butcher knife is sufficient for the largest size. A few carpenter's tools are necessary and a complete set does not come amiss if much large work is attempted.  We must have:      Handsaw     Hatchet     Hammer     Bit brace     Assortment, drills and bits, 1/2 in. and less.     Drawshave     Screwdriver     Small grindstone or corundum wheel     Chisels, two or three sizes     1 wood rasp     1 cabinet rasp     1 chopping block, made of a section of       hardwood log  If large animals are to be mounted we will need in addition some iron working tools, such as      Set of taps and dies 1/4 to 1 in.     Monkey wrench     Hack saw     Tanner's knives, 1 or more  A combination vise and anvil will be needed in any case as well as some miscellaneous tools:      Fur comb, coarse and fine combined     Paint, wax, and varnish brushes     Foot rule     Tape measure     Putty knife     Pointing trowel     Skin scraper  and some stuffing and modelling tools which you can make yourself. The list of materials seems like a long one, but many are inexpensive and others are used only in some small amounts, so the aggregate cost is small.

The permanent mounts are treated of elsewhere.  In ordering glass eyes it is often best to get them in the clear glass iris with black pupil so they may be given any color desired by painting the backs with tube colors, afterward protecting the paint with varnish. In this way a small stock will answer for many varieties. The plain black eye which is the least expensive can be used for many of the smaller birds and mammals, but should never be when the iris of the eye has any distinct tint. Do not make the mistake of ordering an assortment of \"off\" sizes and colors, that is those which are seldom called for. Aim to have those on hand for which you will have the most frequent use, the exceptions can be quickly had by parcel post. There is more demand for eyes of some shade of yellow or brown than any other colors, probably.  All birds have the round pupil. Elongated pupils are suitable for horned game and the cat tribe, irregular pupils fish, and the veined iris for dogs, wolves and foxes. Suitable sizes for some species of birds are as follows:    Number  3 to  5   Sparrows generally.   Number  5 to  7   Robin, blue jay, flicker.   Number  7 to  9   The smaller hawks and herons,                     nearly all the ducks.   Number 10 to 12   The smaller owls, the wild goose.   Number 12 to 14   The larger hawks and herons.   Number 15         Screech owl, eagles.   Number 17         Barred owl.   Number 19 or 20   Snowy owl and great horned owl.  [Illustration: GLASS EYES FOR ANIMALS, BIRDS, FISH.]  Size of eyes for quadrupeds:    Number  7 or  8   Mink, skunk, red squirrel.   Number 10 to 12   Gray and fox squirrel, wood                     chuck, raccoon and opossum.   Number 12 to 14   Rabbit, small dogs, house cat.   Number 15 to 17   Jack rabbit, fox, medium size                     dogs, wild cat, black bear.   Number 18         Large dog, wolf, lynx, and grizzly bear.   Number 20 to 22   Puma, jaguar, small deer.   Number 23 to 24   Large deer, tiger.   Number 25 to 27   Moose, elk, caribou, horse, cow, lion.  [Illustration: SIZES OF GLASS EYES.]  [Illustration: SIZES OF GLASS EYES (Style 1)]  Of wire the following sizes are suitable for birds:    Number  6         Pelican.   Number  7         Wild turkey, swan.   Number  8         Eagles.   Number  9         Loon, goose, large herons.   Number 10         Seagull, large ducks, hawks,                     owls, and fish hawk.   Number 11 or 12   Medium size ducks, herons, and similar.   Number 13 or 14   Small ducks and grouse.   Number 15         Small herons, and medium owls.   Number 16         Doves, small owls.   Number 17 or 18   Bob white, jay, robin, snipe.   Number 19         Blackbird, waxwing, oriole.   Number 20         Bluebird, cardinal.   Number 21 to 24   Warblers, wrens, titmouse, finches.   Number 26         North American humming bird.  For quadrupeds:    Number  7         Wild cat.   Number  8         Foxes.   Number 10         Raccoon, wood chuck.   Number 11         Skunk, opossum.   Number 12 or 13   Muskrat, rabbit.   Number 14 or 15   Mink, large squirrels.   Number 17 or 18   Weasel, bull frog, and small squirrels.  These sizes are approximate, varying with size of the individual specimen and the required attitude wanted. For instance, a bird mounted with wings spread would be better for a large size wire than if in a resting position. An animal crouched does not require as heavy supports as one upright or in action. It is best to give the specimen the benefit of the doubt, as nothing is more disastrous than to have an otherwise well mounted subject sag down and spoil the entire effect from lack of sufficient mechanical support. The best wire for this purpose is annealed, galvanized iron. Larger animals require Norway iron rod in the following sizes:      1/4 in.   Coyote, setter dog.    5/16 in.   Wolf, puma.     3/8 in.   Medium deer.     1/2 in.   Caribou and large deer.     3/4 in.   Moose, elk.  A large earthen jar or two will hold sufficient skin pickle for small animals. For large animals or great numbers of small ones a tank or barrel. Keep such jars or barrels covered to prevent evaporation. With dry arsenic and alum, arsenical solution, formaldehyde for an emergency and plenty of salt, even a beginner should be able to save almost anything that falls into his clutches.  There are numbers of reliable dealers in tools and supplies for the taxidermist and a perusal of their catalogs will be helpful, among the number being James P. Babbitt, 192 Hodges Ave., Taunton, Mass. Ready to use head forms, pinked rug and robe trimming, artificial tongues and ear forms, and even paper head and neck forms for the mounting of large game heads are some of the time and labor saving supplies they list. If you cannot attain to these, emergency supplies can be had of the dealer in hardware and dry goods, and one who cares for the art will rise superior to the material at his hand. What you \"stuff 'em with\" is of small consequence provided you use brains in the job. I have seen an elk head stuffed with old clothes with the bottoms of pop bottles for eyes, but would advise some other filling if possible.     CHAPTER III.  PRESERVATIVE PREPARATIONS, FORMULAS, ETC.   Probably arsenic in some form has been, and will continue to be the leading taxidermic preservative, or rather, insect deterrent. Many people are shy of handling this, but with reasonable care the use of arsenic is perfectly safe. Always keep poisons well labeled and out of the way of children. Nine children out of ten would never think of sampling them, but the tenth might prove the fatal exception.  There is far less danger to the operator in handling the needful amount of poisons than in endeavoring to save some rare but over-ripe subject. In many years' use of arsenic, dry, in wet solution, and in soap, I have received nothing more serious than an occasional sore finger.  The shape in which I have found it most satisfactory for poisoning hair and feathers of mounted specimens and the interior of furred skins I will give as  ARSENICAL SOLUTION.      Commercial arsenic       1 lb.     Bicarbonate of soda    1/2 lb.     Water                    5 pts.  Boil until arsenic and soda have dissolved, stirring frequently. Use a vessel at least twice as large as necessary to contain the quantity used as it foams up while boiling. When cold put in a large bottle or jar marked _Poison_, of course. For poisoning finished specimens, mounted heads, etc., take one part of this solution to two parts water and spray the entire surface with this in an atomizer or larger sprayer. It should be tested before using by"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23259"],["title","Home Taxidermy for Pleasure and Profit (#3)"],["body"," a black feather in it and if a gray or white deposit is left on drying, it should be diluted still further until this is prevented.  To poison the inside of skins we make Arsenical Paste: Arsenical Solution (full strength), whiting sufficient to produce the consistency of cream. This should be mixed in a wide mouthed bottle or small pan and applied with a common paint brush. Do not apply to a perfectly dry skin, like tanned hide for a robe or rug, but dampen the inside first with clear water, then paint over with the paste and it will strike through to the fur side and be taken up around the fur roots by capillary action. This tends to put a damper on the activities of the moth, whose favorite grazing ground is at the hair roots just outside the skin.  The paste is equally good on skins of birds, except, perhaps the smaller ones, when freshly skinned, and some of the smaller mammals. The mixture of whiting makes it easy to see when the surface has already been treated, unless the skin is dressed white, in which case dry ochre may be used in place of whiting.  For poisoning the skins of the smaller furred animals and all but the larger birds:  DRY PRESERVATIVE.      Powdered white arsenic     Powdered alum  Mix equal parts by measure and apply to inside of the fresh skin with a soft brush or pad of cotton. If during the skinning and cleaning the skin has dried so the powder will not stick, moisten the inside of the skin with water before applying. Some taxidermists prefer to use in place of the paste some form of Arsenical Soap. This may be purchased from the supply dealer or made at home at quite a reduction. Personally I dislike the greasy, sticky feel of it; it is apt to cling around the finger nails and scratches, making them sore.  However, the following is the best formula for a time honored preservative:  HORNADAY'S ARSENICAL SOAP.      White bar soap            1 lb.     Powdered arsenic          1 lb.     Camphor gum               2-1/2 oz.     Subcarbonate of potash    3 oz.     Alcohol (wood or grain)   4 oz.  Slice the soap and melt slowly with a little water. When melted stir in the potash and arsenic. Boil to the consistency of molasses and pour into a jar to harden. Add the camphor already dissolved in the alcohol and stir occasionally while cooling. Mix with water and apply with a paint brush to flesh side of skins.  In case one is timid about using any of the arsenical preparations I would advise them to try  BROWNE'S NON-POISONOUS PRESERVATIVE SOAP.      Whiting          24 oz.     White soap        8 oz.     Chloride lime   1/2 oz.     Tincture camphor  1 oz.     Water             1 pt.  Shave the soap thin and boil it with the whiting and water till dissolved. Then remove from the fire and stir in the chloride, adding the tincture camphor later when cold, as much of the strength of the latter would be lost were the mixture hot.  Keep in closed jars or bottles, and if too thick, thin down with water or alcohol. Apply like arsenical soap or paste. This is highly recommended by English writers. For a non-poisonous powder I would advise equal parts of powdered alum and insect powder in place of the arsenic and alum.  SOLUTION FOR THE PRESERVATION OF SMALL SPECIMENS ENTIRE.      Formaldehyde (40% strength)  1 part     Water                        9 parts  Mix thoroughly and put in glass or earthen jars or large mouthed bottles.  While most of the heads and skins of big game are preserved until they can reach the taxidermist, many of the smaller specimens become a total loss. Lack of time and knowledge are the chief causes of this loss of valuable souvenirs of days out of doors and interesting natural objects. Probably the easiest and least expensive method of temporarily preserving entire the smaller animals, birds, fish and reptiles is by immersion in the above preparation.  I would not advise its use on animals larger than a small fox or cat, and to insure an immediate penetration of the flesh the abdominal viscera should be removed from the larger specimens. The amount of solution used should be about ten times the volume of the subject, and it had best be replaced with fresh liquid after two or three days. I think this will work equally well on birds, reptiles and mammals.  On removal from the solution they may be skinned and mounted as fresh specimens. On removing from the solution, rinse in water containing a little ammonia to neutralize the irritating odor of the formaldehyde. Do not stand over the solution while mixing as the fumes of the formic acid affect the eyes. The condensed form in which this chemical can be carried and its cheapness (30c. per lb.), make it desirable as a temporary preservative. The saying, \"It never rains but it pours,\" applies to the taxidermist and a sudden rush of subjects may often be saved by using the foregoing preparation. Other work may be under way, or for other reasons it may be desirable to keep a specimen in the flesh a short time before mounting.  ALCOHOLIC SOLUTION.      Alcohol (94% strength)  Equal parts     Water  If alcohol is less than 94% use less water. Use same as formaldehyde solution. This is said to be superior to the formaldehyde solution, though more expensive and harder to carry about on account of its greater bulk before mixing.  Specimens kept long in any liquid are apt to lose their colors. This fading will be reduced to a minimum if kept in the dark.  In order to do any satisfactory work on quadrupeds the taxidermist makes use of a bath or pickle of some sort for keeping skins in a wet state. This pickle sets the hair and in a measure tans the skin, reducing its liability to shrinkage and rendering it less desirable pasturage for insects.  All furred skins of any size should be immersed in this for a time before mounting, and may be kept in it for months or years without injury. If you have time to skin an animal properly the skin may be dropped in the pickle jar and in a day, week, or month be better fit for final mounting than at first.  For the first few days it is necessary to move it about every day so all parts may be exposed to the action of the pickle. The form of pickle which I have found most helpful is:  TANNING LIQUOR.      Water                    1 gal.     Salt                     1 qt.     Sulphuric acid (measure) 1 oz.  Bring to boiling point to dissolve the salt. Allow to cool before stirring in the acid. When cold is ready for use.  When keeping skins in a wet state a long time I would prefer to use:  SALT AND ALUM PICKLE.      Water  1 gal.     Salt   1 qt.     Alum   1 pt.  Boil to dissolve salt and alum; use like preceding.  If skins are to be kept some time they should, after a preliminary pickling, be put in new, fresh pickle and it should be occasionally tested with a salinometer and kept up to the original strength. Dirty and greasy pickle should be thrown away, but if clean and of low strength it can be brought up by adding new pickle of extra strength. It will do no hurt if more salt, even a saturated solution, is made of either of the foregoing.  While the salt and alum or acid pickle will keep our animal skins safely and in a relaxed condition ready for further preparation at any time, it will not answer for bird skins. For this we have a solution for keeping bird skins soft:      Glycerine               2 parts     Carbolic acid           1 part  After skinning the bird and applying some arsenical solution to the inside, brush this solution liberally over the entire inside of the skin. Pay special attention to the bones, wing and leg, skull and root of the tail. If necessary the skin may be packed flat for shipment. One treatment will keep all but the larger skins soft for several months. The feet, of course, will become hard and dry and must be relaxed as usual before mounting.  Every taxidermist needs to be more or less of a modeler, and one of the most useful materials is:  PAPIER MACHE.      Wet wood pulp                        10 oz.     Glue (hot) or LePage's (measure)      3 oz.     Plaster paris, dry                   20 oz.  This formula may be varied at the convenience of the operator. Work the glue into the pulp and knead the plaster into the mass. The more glue the slower it sets and a few drops of glycerine will keep it soft several days. Made with little or no glue it hardens quickly.  If the paper pulp is not at hand it may be made by tearing old newspapers or sheathing paper small and boiling and pounding till a pulp results. This composition is much in use in Europe in the making of many familiar toys and similar objects.  For modeling open mouths, finishing mounted specimens, making artificial rocks, stumps and boughs, it is very desirable.  WAX FOR OPEN MOUTHS.      Beeswax               1 part     Paraffin wax          1 part  Melt and color with tube oil colors. To color dip up a spoonful of melted wax, squeeze some tube color in and stir until stiff. Place the spoon in the hot wax and stir till evenly mixed. Do not try to put the color directly in the hot wax as it will not mix evenly so.  Wax should be melted in a water bath, like a glue pot, as excessive heat will darken it. Cakes of wax of suitable colors may be had of the supply dealers and are most economical when no great amount of work is done. The same parties supply the paper pulp previously mentioned.     CHAPTER IV.  PANELS, SHIELDS AND NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL MOUNTS.   The preparation of a suitable setting for almost any mounted specimen will add greatly to its attractiveness. If you know where it is to be placed it is not difficult to make it suit its surrounding. For instance, a head of big game for hanging in a dining or ball room is suitably mounted on a polished and carved hardwood shield. While this would hardly match its surroundings on the wall of a log camp, a rustic panel of natural wood with the bark on would perfectly suit the latter place.  Heads, horns, and antlers are usually mounted on what are called "]]]
