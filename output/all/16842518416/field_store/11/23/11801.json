Shirley says (post, p. 70),--      It has no window, all the light admitted entering through an     aperture where there _will_ be a door when it becomes cold enough     for such a luxury.  Describing the service, the Doctor says, in part,--      After a long and wandering impromptu prayer by somebody, a prayer     which \"Shirley\" found disagreeable (since she herself was a     churchwoman, and missed the burial service), the procession,     containing twenty men and three women, set out.  Shirley was not, at that time, a churchwoman, and her account of the prayer, etc., is,--      About twenty men, with the three women of the place, had assembled     at the funeral. An extempore prayer was made, filled with all the     peculiarities usual to that style of petition. Ah, how different     from the soothing verses of the glorious burial service of the     church!  It may not be inappropriate here to note that the baby referred to in the two immediately preceding pages is none other than the original of The Luck in Bret Harte's Luck of Roaring Camp. How the funeral scene as described by Shirley was adapted by this master of short-story writing, and how skillfully he combined it with the birth of The Luck, may be perceived in the two paragraphs following.      [Shirley, post, p. 70.] On a board, supported by two butter-tubs,     was extended the body of the dead woman, covered with a sheet. By     its side stood the coffin, of unstained pine, lined with white     cambric.      [The Luck of Roaring Camp, Overland, vol. i, p. 184.] Beside the     low bunk or shelf, on which the figure of the mother was starkly     outlined below the blankets, stood a pine table. On this a     candle-box was placed, and within it, swathed in staring red     flannel, lay the last arrival at Roaring Camp.  Bancroft (History of California, vol. vii, p. 724), speaking of early California literature, says,--      Mining life in California furnished inexhaustible material;... and     almost every book produced in the golden era gave specimens more or     less entertaining of the wit and humor developed by the struggle     with homelessness, physical suffering, and mental gloom. And when,     perchance, a writer had never heard original tales of the kind he     felt himself expected to relate, he took them at second-hand....     Even the most powerful of Bret Harte's stories borrowed their     incidents from the letters of Mrs. Laura A. K. Clapp, who under the     nom de plume of 'Shirley,' wrote a series of letters published in     the _Pioneer Magazine_, 1851-2. The 'Luck of Roaring Camp' was     suggested by incidents related in Letter II., p. 174-6 of vol. i.     of the _Pioneer_. In Letter XIX., p. 103-10 of vol. iv., is the     suggestion of the 'Outcasts of Poker Flat.' Mrs. Clapp's simple     epistolary style narrates the facts, and Harte's exquisite style     imparts to them the glamour of imagination.  The temptation cannot be resisted, at this point, to pursue the history of The Luck of Roaring Camp a little further. The reader will kindly remember that no changes are made in printing extracts. Mr. T. Edgar Pemberton, in his Bret Harte: A Treatise and a Tribute (London, 1900), says, in referring to criticism of the story when it was first in type,--      Mr. Noah Brooks has recorded this strange incident as follows:--      'Perhaps I may be pardoned,' he says, 'for a brief reference to an     odd complication that arose while _The Luck of Roaring Camp_ was     being put into type in the printing office where _The Overland     Monthly_ was prepared for publication. A young lady who served as     proof-reader in the establishment had been somewhat shocked by the     scant morals of the mother of Luck, and when she came to the scene     where Kentuck, after reverently fondling the infant, said, \"he     wrastled with my finger, the d----d little cuss,\" the indignant     proof-reader was ready to throw up her engagement rather than go     any further with a story so wicked and immoral. There was     consternation throughout the establishment, and the head of the     concern went to the office of the publisher with the virginal     proof-reader's protest. Unluckily, Mr. Roman was absent from the     city. Harte, when notified of the obstacle raised in the way of     _The Luck of Roaring Camp_, manfully insisted that the story must     be printed as he wrote it, or not at all. Mr. Roman's _locum     tenens_ in despair brought the objectionable manuscript around to     my office and asked my advice. When I had read the sentence that     had caused all this turmoil, having first listened to the tale of     the much-bothered temporary publisher, I surprised him by a burst     of laughter. It seemed to me incredible that such a tempest in a     tea-cup could have been raised by Harte's bit of character     sketching. But, recovering my gravity, I advised that the whole     question should await Mr. Roman's return. I was sure that he would     never consent to any \"editing\" of Harte's story. This was agreed     to, and when the publisher came back, a few days later, the embargo     was removed. _The Luck of Roaring Camp_ was printed as it was     written, and printing office and vestal proof-reader survived the     shock.'      It is amazing to think that, but for the determination and     self-confidence of quite a young author, a story that has gladdened     and softened the hearts of thousands,--a story that has drawn     welcome smiles and purifying tears from all who can appreciate its     deftly-mingled humour and pathos,--a story that has been a boon to     humanity--might have been sacrificed to the shallow ruling of a     prudish 'young-lady' proof-reader, and a narrow-minded, pharisaical     deacon-printer!      It is appalling to think what might have happened if through     nervousness or modesty the writer had been frightened by the     premature criticisms of this precious pair.  The \"deacon-printer\" mentioned by Pemberton was Jacob Bacon, a fine specimen of the printer of the latter half of the last century. He was the junior partner of the firm of Towne and Bacon, the printers of Harte's _first_ volume, The Lost Galleon. Mr. Towne (not _Tane_, as spelled in Merwin's Life of Bret Harte) obtained judgment in Boston for the printing of that volume. (See further, Mrs. T. B. Aldrich's Crowding Memories, as to satisfaction of judgment.)  A half-tone portrait of the \"prudish 'young-lady' proof-reader\" (what a lacerating taunt!) is printed in the Bret Harte Memorial Number of the Overland (September, 1902).  The proof-readers have not dealt kindly with The Luck of Roaring Camp; but the first of that ilk to mutilate the story was also the worst, to wit, the aforesaid \"prudish 'young-lady' proof-reader.\"  Good usage in typography was utterly unknown to this young lady,--punctuation, capitalization, the use of the hyphen in dividing and compounding words. In practice she did not--perhaps could not--recognize any distinction between a cipher and a lower-case _o_. As to spelling, one may find \"etherial,\" \"azalias,\" \"tessallated.\"  Noah Brooks, in the Overland Memorial Number, says (p. 203),--      He [Bret Harte] collected some half-dozen stories and poems and     they were printed in a volume entitled \"The Luck of Roaring Camp     and Other Sketches,\" (1870.)  There were no poems printed in that volume. It was published in Boston by Fields, Osgood, & Co. Printed at the University Press at Cambridge, then unquestionably the best book-printing house in the United States, of course many of the typographical errors were weeded out. This volume was reprinted in London by John Camden Hotten.  It is to be regretted that the University Press was not more painstaking in the proof-reading, for the Overland typographical perversions persist in some instances to the present day. The reader is not misled by the lubbering punctuation of the sentence, \"She was a coarse, and, it is to be feared, a very sinful woman.\" The usage in such a construction is, \"She was a coarse, and it is to be feared a very sinful, woman.\" But note where the sense is affected:--      Cherokee Sal was sinking fast. Within an hour she had climbed, as     it were, that rugged road that led to the stars, and so passed out     of Roaring Camp, its sin and shame forever.  Cherokee Sal could not possibly be the sin and shame of Roaring Camp forever; hence the sense calls for a comma after \"shame,\" in the extract. It is gratifying to note that the comma is used in the Hotten reprint.  Another egregious blunder which has persisted is the printing of the word \"past\" for \"passed,\" in the extract below.      Then he [Kentuck] walked up the gulch, past the cabin, still     whistling with demonstrative unconcern. At a large redwood tree he     paused and retraced his steps, and again passed the cabin.  It remained for a proof-reader at the Riverside Press to reconstruct the sentence by deleting the comma after the word \"gulch\"; thus, \"the gulch past the cabin.\" That Kentuck \"again passed the cabin\" seems not to have been considered. Hence, in the Houghton Mifflin Company's printings of The Luck of Roaring Camp, the last error is worse than the first.  These errors are not venial. Those that are such have not been mentioned, as they occur in almost every book, and appear to be unavoidable. Other errors, evincing a lack of knowledge of good usage in book-typography, must also pass unnoticed.  The Luck of Roaring Camp having been disposed of, consideration of Dr. Royce's review of the Shirley Letters will be resumed.  The Doctor, on page 350 of his work, says, \"In her little library she had a Bible, a prayer-book, Shakespeare, and Lowell's 'Fable for the Critics,' with two or three other books.\" Shirley (p. 100, post) says she had a--      Bible and prayer-book, Shakespeare, Spenser, Coleridge, Shelley,     Keats, Lowell's Fable for Critics, Walton's Complete Angler, and     some"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23280"],["title","The Shirley Letters from California Mines in 1851-52 (#2)"],["body","books.  The poet Spenser's name was spelled with a _c_ in the Pioneer, but the article \"the\" was not used before \"Critics,\" as in the extract from Royce,--an unpardonable error in a book printed in Cambridge, and at the Riverside Press too.  The Spanish books mentioned by Shirley were evidently not neglected by her, and her acquaintance with and friendship for the Spanish-speaking population scattered along the banks of the Río de las Plumas must have made her very familiar with their tongue. In reading these Letters one cannot fail to perceive how fittingly Spanish words and phrases are interwoven with her own English. At the time these Letters were written, many Spanish words were a part of the California vernacular, but to Shirley belongs the honor of introducing them into the literature of California; hence, in printing the Letters, such words are not italicized, as they usually are, by printers who should know better.  Dr. Royce also says on page 350, \"Prominent in the society of the Bar was a trapper, of the old Frémont party, who told blood-curdling tales of Indian fights.\" (See post, p. 111.) It is singular that the Doctor has failed to identify this trapper with the well-known James P. Beckwourth, whose Life and Adventures (Harpers, New York, 1856) was written from his own dictation by Thomas D. Bonner, a justice of the peace in Butte County in 1852. His name is preserved in \"Beckwourth Pass.\" He first entered this pass probably in the spring of the year 1851, although 1850 is the year given in his Life. The Western Pacific Railroad utilizes the pass for its tracks entering California, and through it came the pioneers of whom Shirley has much to say in Letter the Twenty-second.  Among punishments for thefts, the Doctor, on page 351, speaks of a \"decidedly barbarous case of hanging\" for that offense. It is referred to here for the reason that in the sequel of the hanging Bret Harte found more than a suggestion for his finale of The Outcasts of Poker Flat. Both are reprinted here for the purpose of comparison. Shirley says (post, p. 157),--      The body of the criminal was allowed to hang for some hours after     the execution. It had commenced storming in the earlier part of the     evening, and when those whose business it was to inter the remains     arrived at the spot, they found them enwrapped in a soft white     shroud of feathery snowflakes, as if pitying nature had tried to     hide from the offended face of Heaven the cruel deed which her     mountain-children had committed.  The finale of The Outcasts of Poker Flat follows, in part, with no other changes than those of punctuation and capitalization.      They slept all that day and the next, nor did they waken when     voices and footsteps broke the silence of the camp. And when     pitying fingers brushed the snow from their wan faces, you could     scarcely have told, from the equal peace that dwelt upon them,     which was she that had sinned. Even the law of Poker Flat     recognized this, and turned away, leaving them still locked in each     other's arms. But at the head of the gulch, on one of the largest     pine-trees, they found the deuce of clubs pinned to the bark with a     bowie-knife.... And pulseless and cold, with a derringer by his     side and a bullet in his heart, though still calm as in life,     beneath the snow lay he who was at once the strongest and yet the     weakest of the outcasts of Poker Flat.  The phrase, \"though still calm as in life,\" in the last sentence of the extract immediately preceding, is one that would seem to invite the challenge of a proof-reader. It is passed without further notice.  Dr. Royce is not at his best in reviewing Letter the Nineteenth. The suggestion for The Outcasts of Poker Flat was found therein by Bret Harte, as previously noted. On page 354 the Doctor says,--      A \"majestic-looking Spaniard\" had quarreled with an Irishman about     a Mexican girl (\"Shirley\" for the first time, I think, thus showing     a knowledge of the presence at Indian Bar of those women who seem,     in the bright and orderly days of her first arrival, to have been     actually unknown in the camp). The Mexican, having at last stabbed     and killed the other, fled to the hills.  It does not appear from the letter that a girl of any kind was involved in this stabbing and death. Shirley distinguishes between the Spaniard and the Mexican; the Doctor does not. As to the presence of \"those women,\" Shirley, without commenting, sheds much light upon that subject, as will be perceived from the following extracts. Dr. Royce's review does not coincide with the facts.      Seven miners from Old Spain, enraged at the cruel treatment which     their countrymen had received on the Fourth,... had united for the     purpose of taking revenge on seven Americans. All well armed,...     intending to challenge each one his man,... on arriving at Indian     Bar ... they drank a most enormous quantity of champagne and     claret. Afterwards they proceeded to [a vile resort kept by an     Englishman], when one of them commenced a playful conversation with     one of his countrywomen. This enraged the Englishman, who instantly     struck the Spaniard a violent blow.... Thereupon ensued a spirited     fight, which ... ended without bloodshed.... Soon after,... Tom     Somers, who is said always to have been a dangerous person when in     liquor, without any apparent provocation struck Domingo (one of the     original seven) a violent blow.... The latter,... mad with wine,     rage, and revenge, without an instant's pause drew his knife and     inflicted a fatal wound upon his insulter. [Post, p. 271.]      In the bakeshop, which stands next door to our cabin, young Tom     Somers lay straightened for the grave (he lived but fifteen minutes     after he was wounded), while over his dead body a Spanish woman was     weeping and moaning in the most piteous and heartrending manner.     [Post, p. 264.]      Domingo, with a Mexicana hanging upon his arm, and brandishing     threateningly the long, bloody knife,... was parading up and down     the street unmolested.... The [Americans] rallied and made a rush     at the murderer, who immediately plunged into the river and swam     across,... and without doubt is now safe in Mexico. [Post, p. 263.]  A disregard of exactness is not peculiar to Dr. Royce. Secondary authorities are generally open to criticism. Of the authenticity of Shirley's facts there can be no question. Dr. Royce recognized this, while subjecting the work of other writers to severe scrutiny. But Shirley's printer did her much evil. It is not necessary here to say much concerning trade usages in making an author's manuscript presentable in type,--the essentially different ways of and differences between the job, the newspaper, and the book printer. Shirley's letters, not having been written for publication, required exceptional care while being put in type, and especially so since the manuscript was not prepared for the press. It is amusing to read what the printers of the Pioneer have to say of themselves.      Our facilities for doing FINE BOOK WORK, are very great, possessing     as we do, large founts of new type, and an ADAMS POWER PRESS. We     refer to the Pioneer Magazine, as a specimen. We have in use a     MAMMOTH PRESS, which gives us a great advantage in the execution of     the LARGEST SIZE MAMMOTH POSTERS, in colors or plain.  In the estimation of the printers, the matériel was the principal thing; the personnel, not worthy of mention,--and it so happened that it wasn't, for, judging from the typographical inaccuracies of the Pioneer, the compositors were of a very low order of intelligence, and if a proof-reader was employed, he assuredly stood high in their estimation, as he evidently caused them but little trouble.  Much has been said by writers on matters typographical as to what is meet and necessary in the reprinting of a book, and much more on literary blunders and mistakes. Some printers are rash, and perpetrate a worse blunder than that attempted to be corrected in reprinting. Worse than such people are the amateur proof-readers, who generally run to extremes, that is, they either cannot see a blunder, and hence pass it unchallenged, or else they manifest a disposition to challenge and \"improve\" everything they do not comprehend, and, knowing nothing of typographical usages or style, they are a decidedly malignant quantity.  Every old printer knows, what is often said, that English is a grammarless tongue, and that no grammarian ever wrote a sentence worth reading. No proof-reader, with the experience of a printer behind him, will change a logically expressed idea so as to make it conform to grammatical rules, nor will he harass the author thereof with suggestions looking to that end.  Critical readers of these Letters must ever bear in mind the fact that Shirley was not writing for publication, and that the printer of this edition had no desire to and did not alter Shirley's text to suit his ideas of what was fitting and proper, further than to smooth or round out in many instances rugged or careless construction. Punctuation, hyphenization, capitalization, italicizing, spelling, required much, and of course received much, attention.  In some instances where Shirley does not express her meaning clearly, and reconstruction seemed necessary, no change was made. Singularly, this was the case in the first sentence of the first letter.      I can easily imagine, dear M., the look of large wonder which     gleams from your astonished eyes when they fall upon the date of     this letter.  M. could be astonished but once, but the language used conveys the idea of wonder arising each time the letter is read; then, again, it is the place-name, and not the date, that is to cause wonder to gleam from astonished eyes, as the context shows.  Where reconstruction was not needed to make the meaning clear, "]]]
