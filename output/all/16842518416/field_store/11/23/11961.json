You'll not be denyin' that! Now, a diny hangs around a man's house and it eats his food and his tools and it's no sort of good to anybody while it's alive. Is that the action of a lizard? It is not! But it's notorious that porcupines hang around men's houses and eat the handles of their tools for the salt in them, ignoring' the poor man whose sweat had the salt in it when he was laborin' to earn a livin' for his family. And when a thing acts like a porcupine, a porcupine it is and nothing else! So a diny is a Eirean porcupine, native to the planet, and no man can deny it!  \"And what, then, is a snake?\" demanded President O'Hanrahan oratorically. \"It's a creature that sneaks about upon the ground and poisons by its bite when it's not blarneyin' unwise females into tasting' apples. Do the black creatures here do anything of that sort? They do not! They go about their business plain and open, givin' a half of the road and a how'd'y-do to those they meet. They're sober and they're industrious. They mind their own business, which is killin' the Eirean porcupines we inaccurate call by the name of dinies. It's their profession! Did yea ever hear of a snake with a profession? I'll not have it said that there's snakes on Eire! And I'll denounce yea as a conscienceless politician if yea dare to put such a name on the honest, friendly, industrious Eirean porcupine eaters that up to this moment have been the savin' of the colony! I'll not have it!\"  There was a long silence. Then Sean O'Donohue spoke dryly: \"Porcupine eaters, you say? Not snakes?\"  \"Not snakes!\" repeated the president defiantly. \"Porcupine eaters!\"  \"Hm-m-m,\" said Sean O'Donohue. \"That's better. The Dail's not immune to blarney when it's needful to accept it--and Eire back on Earth is hard put for breathin' room you say can be had from now on. What would be the reason for Moira standin' so close to you?\"  \"She's marryin' me,\" said President O'Hanrahan firmly.  Sean O'Donohue's voice was waspish.  \"But I forbid it!\" it said sharply. \"Until I'm up and about and able to be givin' her in marriage as her grandfather ought to be doin'! Ye'll wait the few days till I'm able! Understand?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said the president. Meekness seemed called for.  \"Then begone!\" snapped Sean O'Donohue. Then he added sternly: \"Remember--no shenanigans!\"  The solicitor general watched them depart on a wedding journey to a cottage in Ballyhanninch, which was on Donegal Peninsular, fronting on the Emmett Sea. He waved, like the assembled populace. But when they were out of sight he said darkly to the chief justice and the Chancellor of the Exchequer:  \"I didn't have the heart to bring it up before, but there's the devil of a problem buildin' up against the time he comes back.\"  \"Which problem?\" asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer, warily.  \"It's the sn ... the porcupine killers,\" said the solicitor general. \"Things look bad for them. They're out of work. Even Timothy. There's no dinies to speak of for them to earn a livin' by killin'. It's technological unemployment. They earned their way faithful, doin' work they knew an' loved. Now they're jobless. There's no work for them. What's to be done? Put 'em on re [remainder of text is missing]  There was a pause. The solicitor general said firmly:  \"I mean it! They've a claim on us! A claim of the highest order! They can't starve, it's sure! But would you have them have to hold mass meetin's and set up picket lines and the like, to get justice done them?\"  \"Ah,\" said the chief justice. \"Some way will turn up to handle the matter.

It is, however, unfortunately impossible entirely to separate the sensational from the criminal, and a chronicler is left in the dilemma that he must either sacrifice details which are essential to his statement and so give a false impression of the problem, or he must use matter which chance, and not choice, has provided him with.  With this short preface I shall turn to my notes of what proved to be a strange, though a peculiarly terrible, chain of events.  It was a blazing hot day in August.  Baker Street was like an oven, and the glare of the sunlight upon the yellow brickwork of the house across the road was painful to the eye.  It was hard to believe that these were the same walls which loomed so gloomily through the fogs of winter.  Our blinds were half-drawn, and Holmes lay curled upon the sofa, reading and re-reading a letter which he had received by the morning post.  For myself, my term of service in India had trained me to stand heat better than cold, and a thermometer at ninety was no hardship.  But the morning paper was uninteresting.  Parliament had risen. Everybody was out of town, and I yearned for the glades of the New Forest or the shingle of Southsea.  A depleted bank account had caused me to postpone my holiday, and as to my companion, neither the country nor the sea presented the slightest attraction to him.  He loved to lie in the very center of five millions of people, with his filaments stretching out and running through them, responsive to every little rumour or suspicion of unsolved crime.  Appreciation of nature found no place among his many gifts, and his only change was when he turned his mind from the evil-doer of the town to track down his brother of the country.  Finding that Holmes was too absorbed for conversation I had tossed aside the barren paper, and leaning back in my chair I fell into a brown study.  Suddenly my companion's voice broke in upon my thoughts:  \"You are right, Watson,\" said he.  \"It does seem a most preposterous way of settling a dispute.\"  \"Most preposterous!\" I exclaimed, and then suddenly realizing how he had echoed the inmost thought of my soul, I sat up in my chair and stared at him in blank amazement.  \"What is this, Holmes?\" I cried.  \"This is beyond anything which I could have imagined.\"  He laughed heartily at my perplexity.  \"You remember,\" said he, \"that some little time ago when I read you the passage in one of Poe's sketches in which a close reasoner follows the unspoken thoughts of his companion, you were inclined to treat the matter as a mere tour-de-force of the author.  On my remarking that I was constantly in the habit of doing the same thing you expressed incredulity.\"  \"Oh, no!\"  \"Perhaps not with your tongue, my dear Watson, but certainly with your eyebrows.  So when I saw you throw down your paper and enter upon a train of thought, I was very happy to have the opportunity of reading it off, and eventually of breaking into it, as a proof that I had been in rapport with you.\"  But I was still far from satisfied.  \"In the example which you read to me,\" said I, \"the reasoner drew his conclusions from the actions of the man whom he observed. If I remember right, he stumbled over a heap of stones, looked up at the stars, and so on.  But I have been seated quietly in my chair, and what clues can I have given you?\"  \"You do yourself an injustice.  The features are given to man as the means by which he shall express his emotions, and yours are faithful servants.\"  \"Do you mean to say that you read my train of thoughts from my features?\"  \"Your features and especially your eyes.  Perhaps you cannot yourself recall how your reverie commenced?\"  \"No, I cannot.\"  \"Then I will tell you.  After throwing down your paper, which was the action which drew my attention to you, you sat for half a minute with a vacant expression.  Then your eyes fixed themselves upon your newly framed picture of General Gordon, and I saw by the alteration in your face that a train of thought had been started.  But it did not lead very far.  Your eyes flashed across to the unframed portrait of Henry Ward Beecher which stands upon the top of your books.  Then you glanced up at the wall, and of course your meaning was obvious.  You were thinking that if the portrait were framed it would just cover that bare space and correspond with Gordon's picture there.\"  \"You have followed me wonderfully!\" I exclaimed.  \"So far I could hardly have gone astray.  But now your thoughts went back to Beecher, and you looked hard across as if you were studying the character in his features. Then your eyes ceased to pucker, but you continued to look across, and your face was thoughtful.  You were recalling the incidents of Beecher's career.  I was well aware that you could not do this without thinking of the mission which he undertook on behalf of the North at the time of the Civil War, for I remember your expressing your passionate indignation at the way in which he was received by the more turbulent of our people.  You felt so strongly about it that I knew you could not think of Beecher without thinking of that also.  When a moment later I saw your eyes wander away from the picture, I suspected that your mind had now turned to the Civil War, and when I observed that your lips set, your eyes sparkled, and your hands clenched I was positive that you were indeed thinking of the gallantry which was shown by both sides in that desperate struggle. But then, again, your face grew sadder, you shook your head.  You were dwelling upon the sadness and horror and useless waste of life.  Your hand stole towards your own old wound and a smile quivered on your lips, which showed me that the ridiculous side of this method of settling international questions had forced itself upon your mind. At this point I agreed with you that it was preposterous and was glad to find that all my deductions had been correct.\"  \"Absolutely!\" said I.  \"And now that you have explained it, I confess that I am as amazed as before.\"  \"It was very superficial, my dear Watson, I assure you.  I should not have intruded it upon your attention had you not shown some incredulity the other day.  But I have in my hands here a little problem which may prove to be more difficult of solution than my small essay in thought reading.  Have you observed in the paper a short paragraph referring to the remarkable contents of a packet sent through the post to Miss Cushing, of Cross Street, Croydon?\"  \"No, I saw nothing.\"  \"Ah! then you must have overlooked it.  Just toss it over to me. Here it is, under the financial column.  Perhaps you would be good enough to read it aloud.\"  I picked up the paper which he had thrown back to me and read the paragraph indicated. It was headed, \"A Gruesome Packet.\"  \"Miss Susan Cushing, living at Cross Street, Croydon, has been made the victim of what must be regarded as a peculiarly revolting practical joke unless some more sinister meaning should prove to be attached to the incident.  At two o'clock yesterday afternoon a small packet, wrapped in brown paper, was handed in by the postman.  A cardboard box was inside, which was filled with coarse salt. On emptying this, Miss Cushing was horrified to find two human ears, apparently quite freshly severed.  The box had been sent by parcel post from Belfast upon the morning before.  There is no indication as to the sender, and the matter is the more mysterious as Miss Cushing, who is a maiden lady of fifty, has led a most retired life, and has so few acquaintances or correspondents that it is a rare event for her to receive anything through the post.  Some years ago, however, when she resided at Penge, she let apartments in her house to three young medical students, whom she was obliged to get rid of on account of their noisy and irregular habits.  The police are of opinion that this outrage may have been perpetrated upon Miss Cushing by these youths, who owed her a grudge and who hoped to frighten her by sending her these relics of the dissecting-rooms.  Some probability is lent to the theory by the fact that one of these students came from the north of Ireland, and, to the best of Miss Cushing's belief, from Belfast.  In the meantime, the matter is being actively investigated, Mr. Lestrade, one of the very smartest of our detective officers, being in charge of the case.\"  \"So much for the Daily Chronicle,\" said Holmes as I finished reading. \"Now for our friend Lestrade.  I had a note from him this morning, in which he says:  \"I think that this case is very much in your line.  We have every hope of clearing the matter up, but we find a little difficulty in getting anything to work upon.  We have, of course, wired to the Belfast post-office, but a large number of parcels were handed in upon that day, and they have no means of identifying this particular one, or of remembering the sender.  The box is a half-pound box of honeydew tobacco and does not help us in any way.  The medical student theory still appears to me to be the most feasible, but if you should have a few hours to spare I should be very happy to see you out here.  I shall be either at the house or in the police-station all day.  \"What say you, Watson?  Can you rise superior to the heat and run down to Croydon with me on the off chance of a case for your annals?\"  \"I was longing for something to do.\"  \"You shall have it then.  Ring for our boots and tell them to order a cab.  I'll be back in a moment when I have changed my dressing-gown and filled my cigar-case.\"  A shower of rain fell while we were in the train, and the heat was far less oppressive in Croydon than in town.  Holmes had "]]]
