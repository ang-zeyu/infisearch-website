North America                      100     FOREWORD   Once upon a time as four blind men sat by the roadside they heard the tramp of an elephant's feet, and said one to another, \"Here comes an elephant; now we shall know what he is like.\" The first blind man put out his hand and touched the elephant's broad side. The second took hold of a leg. The third grasped a tusk, and the fourth clutched the animal's tail.  \"Now do you know what an elephant looks like?\" asked a friend.  \"Yes,\" cried the first. \"The elephant is broad and flat like a barn door.\"  \"What!\" exclaimed the second. \"The elephant is big and round like the trunk of a tree.\"  \"Not so!\" cried the third. \"The elephant is hard and smooth like a polished stone.\"  \"What are you all talking about?\" cried the fourth. \"The elephant is just like a piece of rope.\"  Much so-called teaching of geography leads to just such incomplete and fantastic ideas about geographical concepts. Very many children have only vague, incomplete and incorrect conceptions of the things they see. Like these physically and mentally blind men we are too often satisfied with mere wordy descriptions of subjects when we might study the subject at first hand if we would.  This little book is intended to prevent the giving of information by description, but to suggest ways of directing attention to those things which lie within reach of the child's senses, things which he might pass by, things which are needed now to stimulate an intelligent interest in his surroundings, things which are needed later for an appreciation and enjoyment of his study of the larger facts and concepts of geography. If the larger geographical concepts are to have accuracy and richness for the child he must have his attention directed to his surroundings. The trite expression \"from the known to the unknown\" is good pedagogy, but there must be a \"known\" on which to build.  The book is based upon the author's actual experience in the class-room studying the children at their geography tasks. It has been her experience that the efforts of the teachers to build broad geographical concepts were of no avail because the pupils did not have accurate intimate knowledge of the necessary home geography upon which to build. To correct this defect she set about collecting and classifying the necessary material. With the use of this material she not only found that the class teachers had much less difficulty in presenting the study of the earth as a whole, but that an interest beyond all expectation was apparent in the children.  The following pages are valuable more on account of the things they suggest than for any geographical facts which they incidentally present. The book is not a text-book on geography; it is a compendium of suggestion on the study of the subject. It makes little effort to present facts, but rather it tells how to gather, classify and study facts. It is intended to be used with children during the age when they especially delight in the making of collections, and is intended to turn to a definite use this childish instinct.  Map study is based entirely upon the child's experiences as he makes plans of his schoolroom, schoolhouse, streets and city. The suggestions regarding the study of things foreign to the child are based entirely upon his experience in the study of the types with which he has become familiar in his study of his surroundings.    Milton C. Cooper,   Superintendent of District Nine, Philadelphia.     INTRODUCTION   Geographical knowledge should progress from the known to the unknown, from the familiar to the unfamiliar. The world is the home of mankind. We can best understand the larger world by a preliminary consideration of our own small intimate home. We therefore begin to study geography with an account of the child's immediate environment. The school stands for the common home of the class. From the school we gradually widen out our teaching to include the immediate neighborhood with its buildings, and finally the whole town or community.  We study the various types of people whom we meet every day, and the industries in which they engage in their efforts to obtain the three main necessities of human life,--food, clothing and shelter. The animals and plants sharing the world with man and contributing to his sustenance next focus our attention.  The home neighborhood has its physiographical features distinguishing it from other places and influencing the life of its inhabitants. The land and water divisions in the immediate environment are studied as types, while those not closely related to our home are reserved for consideration as each one occurs in its local geographical place in the course of study.  We must know something of direction in order to conveniently locate the streets, buildings and physiographical features near our home. Finally, we will try to realize the great size of the earth, of which our home is but a small portion, by a consideration of the relationship of our community to the rest of the world and to some of this world's great diversities.  As geography is a study of cause and effect, the early lessons should be mainly oral. Later, in order to obtain a broad knowledge of geographical data, not one but many books should be read. This little book aims to serve as a bridge between the oral lesson and the descriptive text-book. The presentation of many questions leads the pupil to think out cause and effect, and to connect his present knowledge with the realm of the unknown. Special care has been exercised to present facts only when facts are absolutely necessary, and only after allowing the pupil the opportunity to first exercise his own reasoning faculties in obtaining the information.  The excursion is an essential part of every geography course, and every effort should be made to use this effective means of teaching.  Four types of valuable exercises may be suggested in the use of this book:  1. The pupils may read the questions orally and give the answers orally.  2. They may read the questions silently, answering them orally.  3. They may read the questions orally and write the answers.  4. Finally, they may silently read the questions and write the answers.  All definitions have been carefully avoided as tending to hamper the free acquisition of ideas.     PART I    TOPICS     1. Our School.    2. The Streets and Roads.    3. The Buildings.    4.

PART ONE  [Illustration: THE CAPITOL AT WASHINGTON.]     WHERE WE LIVE--A HOME GEOGRAPHY   CHAPTER I  OUR SCHOOL   1  What is the name of our school?  Where have you seen this name?  [Illustration: A TOWN SCHOOL.]  Why was this name given to our school?  On what street or road does our school stand?  How long have you been attending this school?  See how much you have noticed as you came here each day. Tell what you can remember of the different parts of the building which can be seen from the street or road. Describe each of these parts:    Walls      Roof   Windows    Chimneys   Doors      Fire-escape   2  As you look at the school from the outside what materials do you see that the builders have used? Where have they needed stone, slate, glass, tin, iron, steel, wood?  Now let us think of the garden and playground. Tell about the different parts and the materials that have been used in making them.  What great numbers of workmen were needed before a school like ours could be built! Who procured the stone and the slate? Whose work was needed to obtain the iron, the steel and the tin? Who made the glass? Which workmen shall we thank for the wood?  Can you think how the bare lot looked before the school was built? Many men with shovels and pick-axes dug out the foundation, and numbers of horses and wagons were needed to carry out the earth. Then came the builders. How were so many materials brought here?   3  1. We will go outdoors together and look at the school building.  2. We will stand north of the school, south, east and west of it. Notice the position of the parts, their number, shape, size and color.  3. As we stand at each side, see whether there are any parts which you never noticed before or any parts which we forgot to mention yesterday.   4  [Illustration]  Look at this drawing of a school building and grounds. It is called a plan. Before any"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22911"],["title","Where We Live (#1)"],["body"," or church or home is built a plan must be drawn. This is to show the workmen what to do. See how much of the ground is used for the building. Find the garden. What are in the garden? Which is larger, the garden or the playground? What shape is the playground? How many doors are there to the building? In how many ways can you get into the playground?  Try to draw a plan of your school building and yard, showing the gates, the flagpole, the drinking fountain or pump, and any other parts you think of. Show which door you use most.      _Note to the Teacher._--The pupils should draw the plan upon paper     while the teacher draws it upon the blackboard. Infinite care should     be exercised to invest every line with its full meaning. Upon the     proper interpretation of this first plan will depend much of the     pupil's future ability to correctly read a map as the representation     of a reality.   5  THE INSIDE OF THE SCHOOL  As you walk from the school door to your room what do you see? Tell all that you have noticed in the corridors, on the staircases, in the cloak-rooms and the class-rooms.   6  We will go on a little excursion through the school today, walking along all of the corridors and upon all of the staircases. Look especially to see anything that you never saw before, and notice anything that you forgot to mention in yesterday's description.   7  Answer the following questions:  1. How many stories high is our school?  2. How many class-rooms are on each floor?  3. How many other rooms are on each floor?  4. How many staircases does our school have?  5. What materials have been used in building the staircases?  6. What can be seen in the corridor nearest your room?  7. By how many doorways can the children leave the building?  8. How is your school heated and ventilated?   8  Describe everything that you can see in your class-room.   9  [Illustration: PLAN OF SCHOOL ROOM]  Look at this plan of a school-room. See if you can draw a plan of _your_ school-room.   10  Make a list of all the materials that have been used in building the inside of your school. Remember all of the following parts:    Floors      Windows       Corridor furnishings   Ceilings    Doors         Class-room furnishings   Walls       Staircases  Now write a list of the kinds of workmen who gathered together these materials. Name as many of the kinds of workmen as you can think of who were engaged on the inside work of the building.   11  Write a letter to anyone whom you know who has never seen our school. Tell all about our building and the good workmen by whom it was planned and built.     CHAPTER II  THE STREETS AND ROADS   1  On what street or road does your school stand?  On what street or road do you live?  What streets or roads do you pass on your way home?  What do you think is the finest street or road that you have ever seen anywhere? What makes that so good a street or road?  Name a poor street or road. What could be done to improve it?   2  Why do cities and towns have streets and roads? Where are there no streets?  Look at the country picture shown on page 19. How pretty it is! When would it be pleasant to walk there? When would it not be so pleasant? Why? What must be done to a road to make it into a good street? Tell what you can of the different ways of paving, lighting and draining streets and roads, and of the different kinds of name-signs you have seen.  Now what can be done to make a street or road beautiful and pleasant in warm weather?  How can boys and girls help to keep the streets and roads pleasant?  Here is a plan of some of the streets in a large city.  [Illustration: PLAN OF CITY STREETS.]   3  Draw the shape of the school lot. Now show the street or road that the school stands upon. If you live in a town, draw the streets next to the school. Then draw the next streets, and keep on until you have drawn the street on which your home stands. Place a little cross to show your home. With your pencil start from your house and make a dotted line to show how you come to school.   4  On your plan of the neighborhood place a circle to show the grocery store or bakery that you pass on your way to school. Make a large dot to show the nearest store to school, and with a dotted line explain how you would go there from school if your teacher sent you to buy ink. Make a circle with a cross in it to show where there is a church, a bank, a factory, or any other important building near your school. If there is a railroad near, show it upon your plan.  [Illustration: A COUNTRY HOME.]   5  Many streets and lanes have names of trees. Some have been named after great and good men. There are some streets with only numbers for names. Do you know of any streets having names of these different kinds? Can you think of any street or road that received its name for some other reason?  Get as many pictures as you can of the streets of your town or any other town and paste them in your note-book. Get some pictures of country roads and paste them also in your note-book.  [Illustration: A CITY STREET.   (Copyright, 1911, William H. Rau, Philadelphia.)]   6  In some towns the streets are nearly straight and cross each other like the wires of a window-screen. In other towns the streets run off from the centre of the town like the spokes of a wheel. Some streets and roads are very crooked.  How are the streets in our town arranged? Name some of our best business streets. Which streets have the finest homes in which people live? Name some streets or roads with trolley lines upon them. Are our streets paved?   7  Perhaps you live in the country where there are very few streets or none at all. How different is your walk to school each day from that of the city boy or girl! In town, children walk on paved streets and pass many buildings. What kind of roads do the country children walk upon? What buildings do they pass? A country school.  [Illustration: A MODERN COUNTRY SCHOOL.]  Do you take a pleasant road between broad fields? Do you walk through the cool shady woods? Perhaps you run over a bridge with the clear brook sparkling and babbling beneath. What else do you see or hear in the country which city folks do not know in their built up towns?     CHAPTER III  THE BUILDINGS   1  What kinds of buildings do you pass on your way to school? Write a list of all the kinds that you have ever seen.  Look at the pictures of buildings in this book and see if you know for what each is used. How can you tell?   2  Of all the many kinds of buildings in town or country, the _houses_ are the most important. It is more necessary to have good homes to live in than to have the other buildings large or beautiful. What makes a good residence? There must be enough room for the whole family. It needs plenty of light, air, sunshine and water. It must have a good roof to keep it dry in stormy weather. It should be well heated in the cold winter. Tell of other things that are needed in our homes to keep the family healthy and happy. How can you help to make your home pleasant?   3  Good _schools_, too, are very necessary. The school-house must be built to keep the boys and girls comfortable and healthy while at work. Name some of the things needed for a good school building.  [Illustration: A STREET SCENE IN NEW YORK.]   4  The libraries and museums also teach people. A _library_ is like a home where many friendly teachers live. These friends will talk to you and tell you many useful and wonderful things. Have you ever visited them at the library? Have you ever taken any of them home with you? Is there a library near our school?  The _museums_ are full of many interesting objects. You may see beautiful pictures and statuary. Some have collections of pretty stones and of stuffed animals. Curious clothing, jewelry, toys and musical instruments used by people in distant lands are shown too. In a museum in Portland you may see the dear little clothing worn by the poet Longfellow when he was a tiny baby. Many books that Washington read are kept in a museum near the city of Washington. Have you ever visited a museum in a city? What did you see there?   5  No buildings anywhere are more beautiful than the _churches_. Are there any churches in your neighborhood? Describe the church which you attend.   6  In town and country there are many ill people who cannot be cared for at home. They go to _hospitals_ to be nursed back to health and strength. The good doctors and nurses work day and night to cure the sick people. How can well people help sick people? Where is the nearest hospital to your home? What is it named?  [Illustration: INDEPENDENCE HALL.]   7  Almost every town has a _Town Hall_. Have you ever seen such a building? What is it used for? Here the mayor has his office. Sometimes the Town Hall or Court House has a high tower, or a fine dome, or a cupola. If you have ever seen a Town Hall tell how it looked.   8  Think of the _stores_ that you have seen. How many kinds can you name? What does each sell principally? Where are these things made? Have you ever seen a large _factory_? What does it manufacture?  [Illustration: PITTSBURGH OBSERVATORY.]  It would be fine if all of the buildings in which folks work were sunny, airy and clean. People employed in comfortable stores and factories are happy and feel like working.  Alas! there are many miserable places where the workmen are crowded and uncomfortable. The impure air makes them tired and ill. If you have seen a good store or factory tell what helps to keep the workers comfortable and healthy.   9  Old cities have in them many very old buildings that all Americans love. The magnificent Capitol at Washington was built long ago. It is one of the finest buildings in the world. It is built of white marble. In the first picture in this book notice the beautiful dome and the great high stairs. In Philadelphia is the dear old Independence Hall with the Liberty Bell. Boston has the old Faneuil Hall.
