Giving a parting kiss to my wife and daughters, I leaped again on deck.  It was a question whether we should be able to keep off the shore till we could reach the island.  I could see the surf breaking furiously on the rocks to leeward, and the gale blew as heavily as ever.  A slight shift of wind might save us.  If the wind held as it then did, I had no hopes for the little _May Flower_.  The day was drawing to a close.  Every instant the danger increased. The gale, instead of breaking, raged more furiously than ever.  Closer and closer the schooner drifted towards the shore.  It would have been madness to carry more sail; for already her lee bulwarks were under water, and yet I dared not take any off her with the slightest hopes of being able to claw off shore.  The seas came breaking on board, deluging our decks, and, had not the hatches been firmly secured, would quickly have swamped us.  I was at the helm, with Charley White by my side, my boys and the two men having lashed themselves to the weather rigging. No one appeared to be terror-stricken, and yet the youngest, as well as old Bob Hunt, knew perfectly well that there was every probability of our being in a few short minutes overwhelmed among the foaming breakers under our lee.  Anxiously I looked out for the island; and the wind blew fiercer and fiercer.  Suddenly there was a lull; but it was of no advantage to us, as the huge rollers were literally throwing us rapidly towards the rocks.  Again the gale came down on us, but its direction was altered.  It blew nearer from the westward, by several points, than it had before done.  Already the schooner was heading off from the shore, but very slowly; and I was doubtful how far she would make way against the rollers, which sent her bodily back towards it.  Still there was hope, and I could venture to slide back the hatch and to sing out to the dear ones below that the wind had changed.  \"Thank God for His mercy,\" was the reply from below, for I had speedily to shut the hatch again.  Just afterwards I saw an opening in the land to the westward, and I knew that it must be the passage between the island and the main.  There was a hillock and a peculiar rock, which prevented me from having any doubt about the matter.  What a comfort to feel sure that we were steering a right course for a safe harbour!  I could now venture to keep away again a little.  The entrance to the sound became more and more distinct as we advanced. The various landmarks noted in the chart, appeared one after the other, and in half an hour we ran into a beautiful little harbour, with the water as smooth as a mill-pond.  Our first care, directly the anchor was dropped, was to take off the hatches and give air to our poor sheep. The boys jumped below to ascertain if they had suffered.  \"All the animals are alive,\" they cried out; \"but send us down a bucket of water.\"  The creatures sucked it up quickly.  They probably would not have held out many hours longer; but we lifted them up, two at a time, on deck, and the fresh air soon revived them.  We had only just light enough to see our way into the harbour, but we hoped in the morning to get on shore and to cut some grass, which would do them more good than the fresh air.  I should have said that directly we were in smooth water my wife and daughters came on deck, and, as they gazed on the sheltering shore under which we were running, they lifted up their hands in earnest thankfulness to that merciful God who had brought us into a haven of rest.  On sounding the well, we found that, notwithstanding all the tossing we had gone through, the stout little craft had not made a drop of water. We spent two very busy days in Refuge harbour, cutting grass and wood, and filling up our water casks.  All this time no natives were seen. There are indeed but few on that part of the coast.  Short-sighted mortals that we are--we had been inclined to complain of our detention, but we had reason to be thankful that we had gone into Refuge harbour.  As soon as we had filled up with wood and water, we got under weigh, and stood out through the eastern end of the sound.  Before, however, we had got from under the shelter of the island--a long, low sandy point intervening between us and the ocean--we saw to the southward a dark bank of clouds coming, like an army in close rank, rapidly up towards us.  The breeze was light, and the sea comparatively calm, but underneath the cloud there came a line of white foam, beyond which the whole ocean seemed a mass of tossing seas.  I knew what to expect, and, going about, stood back to our snug little bay.  Scarcely had we dropped our anchor and furled sails than the hurricane burst above the island, and we could see the breakers dashing furiously on the opposite shore.  For nearly three days the tempest--one of the most violent ever known on that coast--continued raging.  Many a big ship went down, and many a stout one was cast upon the rooks and dashed to pieces.  We waited--grateful for our escape--till the wind moderated and the sea went down, and then once again sailed for our final destination.  In our small vessel we had to economise fresh water, fodder for the animals, and fuel; and it was very important that we should have a quick passage. We had, therefore, again filled up with those necessary articles, and in every corner we had stowed away all the fresh grass we could cut. This, mixed with the hay, kept the sheep in excellent condition.  We had ere long to be thankful that we had not neglected to prepare for all contingencies.    CHAPTER SEVEN.  FRESH WATER.  We had for some time very fine weather, which confirmed Bob Hunt in his opinion that the cat, Duchess, was as wise as he had at first believed.  \"She knowed it,\" he observed, looking sagaciously at Dick Nailor, who was sitting on the capstan with his arms folded across his broad chest, looking out ahead, \"she knowed it, and she'll stick by this craft till we get safe into Port Jackson, you'll see that.\"  \"As to that, I see that the cat is there, and that our little craft is afloat, and every prospect of remaining so!\" answered Dick.  It was seldom he uttered so long an expression.  \"You don't even say that the cat has had any hand in keeping her afloat; and to my mind, it's just this: she found the craft tight and wholesome, she was fond of us, and she saw that we didn't leave her, and so she didn't.  No, no, Bob, the old Duchess had nothing to do with the matter.  There's one aloft who took care of us, and if the cat had fallen overboard, or gone ashore and been left behind, it would have made no manner of difference.\"  \"Then, I suppose you mean to say that there is no such person as the Flying Dutchman?\" observed Bob; \"everybody who has rounded the Cape has heard of him.\"  \"There might have been some villain of a Dutchman who swore that he'd beat about the seas till the Day of Judgment; but depend on it, if he ever did utter such an oath, he's gone to answer for it long ago--far away from this world,\" said Dick Nailor, solemnly.  \"I've heard many, many men talk of the Flying Dutchman, but I never yet met with one who had seen him.\"  Neither had Bob Hunt, and so he had nothing to answer to this--indeed, talkative as he was, he always had to knock under to Dick's sturdy, matter-of-fact arguments, or to his pertinacious silence, if no argument was forthcoming.  The quaint fellow would fold his arms, sit down, and look a picture of stolidity.  I have not said much about how my children passed their time during the voyage.  The boys were generally employed in sailing the vessel, or about the rigging; for my object was not only to keep the vessel in good order during the voyage, but to take her into Port Jackson looking as fresh as I could.  However, the boys had time to practice writing and to study their books, and both Peter and Charles White were able to help them.  The girls had plenty of work to do, as my wife had laid in a store of all sorts of things to make up.  They also were not idle with regard to their books; and they had several pleasant ones to read.  I found also that Charley White was very happy to help them forward in their studies, and Susan took it into her head that she should very much like to learn navigation.  She, however, gave up that idea, and took to singing, as Charley, who knew something about music, thought he could help her, and it was likely to prove a more amusing study, and quite as useful to her.  I may safely say that no one was idle on board; and what is more, that not a real quarrel, and scarcely a dispute of any sort occurred among the inhabitants of our little world.  If one differed in opinion from another, it was always good naturedly, and all discussions were finished amicably.  People in families on shore would always be able to do the same if they kept a watch over their tempers, and did not allow envy, jealousy, and pride to spring up and hold dominion in their hearts.  Our tempers were occasionally tried.  When within a week's sail of the western shores of Australia the wind fell to a dead calm.  The sea was smooth as glass, and the hot sun came down with fearful force on our heads, while the reflection of his rays from the glittering sea almost blinded our eyes.  Long as I had ploughed the salt ocean, I had never felt the heat greater.  For two or three days it was endurable, but after that every one began to complain; even Duchess looked out for a shady place, under the sail or bulwarks, to lie down in, and poor Steadfast went panting about the deck with his tongue out, the fowls hung down their heads, and the merry robins and sparrows ceased to chirp.  If a chip or a feather was thrown overboard, it lay motionless alongside, though the schooner herself kept moving round, with her head towards all the points of the compass.  The heat created a violent thirst: everybody was thirsty--the men, my children, my wife and I, and the poor "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23050"],["title","Peter Biddulph: The Story of an Australian Settler (#8)"],["body","animals; they required water more than we did, for they got no moisture out of the packed hay.  We gave them as much as we dared, and, as soon as the sun was down, had them on deck to give them fresh air.  We were not alone in our misfortunes, however, for when the sun rose, on the first morning of the calm, his rays fell on the white canvas of a ship, just rising out of the western horizon.  After some time she disappeared, either because her sails had been clewed up, or that she was too far off to be seen unless the sun was shining directly on them. We had many discussions as to what she was.  I need scarcely say that she caused us no little uneasiness.  Still the calm continued.  Day after day the sun went down in the calm ocean, and rose again to cast a ruddy glow over its mirror-like surface, and there in the distance lay the stranger, though only sharp eyes could have detected her.  I began to be very anxious about the sheep.  The success of the undertaking depended in a great measure on their being kept alive, still, we had to put them on an allowance, as we had ourselves.  Little Margaret and Tommy couldn't understand why they shouldn't have as much water as they wanted, when there was plenty alongside.  They could not understand that salt water was worse than no water at all; nor could the poor sheep, probably, when they were brought up on deck, and gazed out on the glittering ocean around them.  When matters had come to this pass, I began for the first time to lose heart.  I was sitting with my head bowed down, resting on my hand, when my boy Peter said to me--\"Father I have an idea--I have heard that fresh water may be got out of salt, and I think I can manage it, if you do not mind expending our fuel.\"  These words restored my spirits.  We had laid in a large supply of fuel at the Cape; water was of more consequence than anything else.  It would be better to break up all the spare cases, and even the bulkheads and cabin furniture, than to go without it.  Peter soon explained his plan; I agreed to try it.  We, after a search among the cargo, found two large camp kettles.  Soldering down their lids, we bored a hole in the top of one and in the side of the other, and joined the two with a piece of piping, three feet long.  The one with a hole in the top we placed on the fire.  We fitted a funnel to the spout, through which we poured in water; the other kettle was fixed on a stand, and we soldered a small pipe in at the bottom.  Above the outside kettle we slung a bucket full of water also, with a small pipe in it, and the top of the kettle we covered over with cloths, which, by the means of the bucket, were kept constantly wet.  The kettle on the fire was filled, the fire blazed up, and, as the water boiled, we watched with anxiety the result of the process.  Some drops at length fell from the lower kettle, and a jug was ready to catch them.  Peter eagerly poured the water into a mug, and, putting it to his lips, with a triumphant smile passed it round to us all.  It was deliciously cool and perfectly sweet.  It now came pouring out quickly, and we got up an empty cask to contain it.  We all knelt down and thanked God that we had obtained the means for sustaining life, should our supply of water altogether fail.  It took a long time, and used up a large quantity of fuel to produce even a gallon of fresh water, yet a gallon was sufficient liquid for everybody on board for a couple of days, and we might thus give a larger share to the sheep.  You might not think so, but the gale off the Cape did not cause me as much anxiety as this long calm.  I ought, I confess, to have remembered that in both instances God was watching over us.  In the one, I trusted to my stout little craft and my seamanship; in the other, my seamanship was of no avail--the stoutest ship would not have prevented all on board dying a frightful death had the calm continued.  Here was my human folly: on both occasions, had I thrown all my care on God, I should have saved myself from all the anxiety I had suffered.  This was increased by the uncertainty I felt as to the character of the sail we saw in the distance.  I was in my own mind persuaded that she was a French privateer, and if we were discovered, her boats would probably pay us a visit, even if she did not.  We were all seated languidly about on the deck, under an awning rigged to give us some shade, when Peter started up, exclaiming, \"There comes the breeze.\"  Some downy feathers, fastened by a silk thread to the after backstay, had, he thought, moved for a moment though the vane quickly dropped again.  We were speedily on foot, but the first glance at the glowing, tranquil ocean, like some huge mirror on which we were resting, made me fear that my son had been mistaken.  I shook my head, and a sigh escaped from several of our party, as they sank down again on their seats.  Just then, however, I caught sight of a light cat's-paw skimming over the water in the distance, and Peter, springing at the same moment into the rigging and pointing westward, exclaimed, \"Here it comes, father, no mistake about it now.\"  I followed him up the rigging, and saw in the far west a wide-extending dark blue line moving quickly on towards us.  Peter and I sprang back on deck, got the awning stowed, the head sails set, and the big square-sail ready for hoisting.  The cat's-paws came thicker and thicker, the dark blue line increasing in width, till in a short time we were staggering away before as brisk a breeze as the little craft could desire.  All languor quickly vanished, and we served out an additional supply of water to our poor sheep.  My anxiety, however, did not cease, for just afterwards, as I was sweeping the horizon with my telescope, I saw, rising above it, the royals of a square-rigged ship, the same, I concluded, which I had seen at the commencement of the calm.  She might be a friend, or an English ship, and be ready to supply us with any necessaries we might require: but I had taken it into my head that she was an enemy, and I could not tell to what treatment we might be subjected.  Sometimes French officers behaved very kindly to passengers captured by them, but during the republican period many of those in command were brutal men, who outraged all the laws of humanity when they got the crews and passengers of an English ship into their power.  I, of course, said nothing of this to my wife or children.  I, however consulted with Charley White and Peter, and we agreed that it would be more prudent to alter our course to the northward for a few hours, so as to allow the ship to pass us during the night.  Though we were not now visible to her, when the sun came to set in the west she would have got so far nearer to us that his rays falling on our canvas, we should be probably seen from her tops.  This plan we followed.  Charley White had become even more anxious than I was, and he was constantly going aloft to watch the stranger.  Half an hour before sunset, we could see half way down her topsails from the deck.  Though they looked no bigger than a small pocket handkerchief, the sharp eyes of my girls caught sight of them, and seemed much surprised that we were not eager to speak with the stranger.  I was very glad when darkness hid us, as I hoped, from her.  We arranged, however, to keep a bright look out all night, and to furl everything, should she pass near us, so as to escape observation.  Charley and Peter kept a watch together.  They insisted on my turning in after my first watch was over, and in truth I could leave the vessel in their care with as much confidence as if I had her myself.    CHAPTER EIGHT.  A JOYFUL DISCOVERY.  More than once I saw in my dreams a big ship closing rapidly with us and the French flag run up at the main, and a voice ordering us to heave to. We were all to be made prisoners; horrible would be the fate of those dearest to me.  I started up in a cold perspiration, though the weather was hot enough as may be supposed.  There was scarcely a sound except the rippling of the water against the vessel's side, the breathing of those sleeping round me in our little cabin, and the tread of Peter's feet overhead.  Charley was at the helm I guessed.  He said something, and then they both burst into a merry laugh.  \"All's right,\" I thought to myself, \"I know why I had that uncomfortable dream.  I was over anxious.  I ought, having done my best, to have thrown all my care and anxiety on God; knowing that He cares for me and those dear to me.\"  I got out of bed, knelt down, and prayed, and when I lay down again I slept as soundly as I had ever done in my life. Awaking at daylight, I went on deck to relieve the young men.  No sail was in sight.  Once more we put the schooner on her proper course.  I proposed touching on the western or southern coast of Australia for the sake of obtaining grass or hay for the sheep, and water and fuel.  We had found the importance of having a good supply of fuel.  I was no longer anxious about the stranger, but still I knew that if he was bound in the same direction that we were, owing to the uncertain winds and calms, we might very possibly again fall in with him.  Still, he might after all be a friend.  I would banish the subject from my mind.  I did so.  In the next week we had fine weather and a fair breeze, till the land, stretching away in the north, blue and indistinct, was seen on our larboard bow.  We hauled up for it till we got near enough to distinguish objects on shore.  I cannot say that the appearance of that part of the new country which was to be our future home was at all attractive.  Backs and sand-hills, and slight elevations covered with dark green trees, were the only objects we could discern.  We could obtain plenty of wood, but that we could find any water in that dry looking country seemed very doubtful, even if we could manage to land. We had all been so eagerly watching the coast, that for a long time no"]]]
