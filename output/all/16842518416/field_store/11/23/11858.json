The interest attaching to this discussion had helped the three comrades and crew alike, to tide over what might otherwise have proved a tedious forenoon, for during the whole of that day the dense fog and profound calm continued.  On returning to the deck the discussion was continued for a time, but gradually the interest flagged, then other subjects engaged attention, and the raft was finally allowed to lie undisturbed and forgotten.  \"I don't know how it is,\" said Bob Mabberly; \"but somehow I always feel a depression of spirits in a fog at sea.\"  \"Explanation simple enough,\" returned Jackman; \"are we not constantly reading in the papers of ships being run down in fogs?  Where there is risk there is always in some minds anxiety--in your case you call it depression of spirits.\"  \"Your explanation, Giles, uncomplimentary to me though it be, might have some force if we were just now in the Channel, where being run down in fog is an event of frequent occurrence; but here, in a comparatively unfrequented sea, it would be strange indeed were I to be influenced by such possibilities.  What say you, Captain?\"  McPherson, who had sauntered towards the group, gazed in the direction where the horizon would have been visible had the fog been absent, and said:--  \"Hm!--weel--\" and then stopped, as if for the purpose of mature consideration.  The audience waited for the announcement of the oracle's opinion.  \"Oo ay--weel, ye see, many persons are strangely influenced by possibeelities, what-e-ver.  There is a maiden aunt o' my own--she wass niver marrit, an' she wass niver likely to be, for besides bein' poor an' plain, an' mittle-aged, which are not in my opeenion objectionable, she had an uncommon bad temper.  Yet she wass all her life influenced by the notion that half the young men o' the place wass wantin' to marry her! though the possibeelities in her case wass fery small.\"  \"I should like to 'ave know'd that old gurl!\" whispered Tips to Quin.  \"Howld your tongue, ye spalpeen!\" whispered his friend in reply.  \"Have you any idea, Captain, where we are now?\" asked Jackman.  \"Oo ay, we're somewhere's wast'ard o' the Lewis.  But whether wast, nor'-wast, or sooth-wast, I could not say preceesely.  The nicht, ye see, wass uncommon dark, an' when the fog came doon i' the mornin', I could na' feel sure we had keep it the richt coorse, for the currents hereaboots are strang.  But we'll see whan it comes clear.\"  \"Do you believe in presentiments, Giles?\" asked Barret, in an unusually grave tone.  \"Of course I do,\" answered Jackman.  \"I have a presentiment just now that you are going to talk nonsense.\"  Barret was not, however, to be silenced by his friend's jest.  \"Listen,\" he said, earnestly, as he rose and stood in an attitude of intense attention.  \"It may be imagination playing with the subjects of our recent conversation, but I cannot help thinking that I hear the beating of paddles.\"  \"Keep a sherp look-oot, Shames,\" cried the skipper, suddenly, as he went forward with unwonted alacrity.  A few minutes more and the sound which had at first been distinguished only by Barret's sharp ear, became audible to all--the soft regular patting of a paddle-wheel steamer in the distance, yet clearly coming towards them.  Presently a shrill sound, very faint but prolonged, was heard, showing that she was blowing her steam-whistle as a precaution.  \"Strange, is it not, that the very thing we have been talking about should happen?\" said Mabberly.  \"Nay,\" returned Jackman, lightly, \"we were talking about being run down, and we have not yet come to that.\"  \"The strangest thing of all to me,\" said Barret, \"is that, with a wide ocean all round, vessels should ever run into each other at all, at least on the open sea, for there is only one line, a few feet wide, in favour of such an accident, whereas there are thousands of miles against it.\"  Jackman, who was a great theorist, here propounded a reason for this.  \"If vessels would only hold straight on their courses, you see,\" he said, \"the accident of collision would be exceedingly rare, for, although thousands of ships might pass near to each other, not one in ten thousand would meet; but when vessels come pretty near, their commanders sometimes become anxious, take fancies into their heads, as to each having forgotten the `rules of the road,' and each attempting to correct the other--as we do sometimes in the streets--they bring about the very disaster they are trying to avoid.\"  \"Had we not better ring the bell, Captain?\" cried Mabberly, in rising excitement.  \"Oo ay, if you think so, sir.  Ring, poy!\"  The boy, who was getting alarmed, seized the tongue of the ship's bell, and rang with all his might.  Whether this had the effect to which Jackman had referred, we cannot tell, but next moment what appeared to be a mountain loomed out of the mist.  The steam-whistle had been silent for some time, but as soon as the bell was heard it burst forth with increased fury.  From the instant her form was dimly seen the fate of the yacht was sealed.  There was a wild shouting on board the steamer, but there was no time for action.  \"Starboard hard!\" was the cry.  \"Starboard it is!\" was the immediate answer.  But before the helm could act, the great rushing mass struck the _Fairy_ amidships, and literally cut her in two!  The awful suddenness of a catastrophe, which those on board had just been arguing was all but impossible, seemed to have paralysed every one, for no one made the slightest effort to escape.  Perhaps the appearance of the wall-like bow of the steamer, without rope or projection of any kind to lay hold of, or jump at, might have conveyed the swift perception that their case was hopeless.  At all events, they all went under with the doomed yacht, and nothing was left in the wake of the leviathan but a track of foam on the mist-encumbered sea.  But they were not lost!  One after another the wrecked party rose struggling to the surface, and all of them could swim except the boy.  Giles Jackman was the first who rose.  Treading water and brushing the hair out of his eyes, he gazed wildly about.  Barret came up close beside him, almost a moment later.  He had barely taken breath, when the others rose at various distances.  A cry not far from him caused him to turn.  It was poor Robin Tips, struggling for life.  A few powerful strokes carried Barret alongside.  He got behind the boy, caught him under the armpits, and thus held him, at arm's length, until he could quiet him.  \"There is a spar, thank God!  Make for it, Barret, while I see to Quin,\" shouted Jackman.  As he spoke, they could hear the whistle of the steamer rushing away from them.  Barret, forcing himself breast-high out of the water, glanced quickly round, and caught sight of the floating spar, to which his companion had referred.  Although only a few yards off, the fog rendered it almost invisible.  \"Are you quiet now?\" demanded Barret, in a stern voice, for the terrified boy still showed something like a hysterical determination to turn violently round, and grasp his rescuer in what would probably have turned out to be the grip of death.  \"Yes, sir, oh! yes.  But d-don't let me go!  M-mind, I can't swim!\"  \"You are perfectly safe if you simply do nothing but what I tell you,\" returned Barret, in a quiet, ordinary tone of voice, that reassured the poor lad more than the words.  By way of reply he suddenly became motionless, and as limp as a dead eel.  Getting gradually on his back, and drawing Tips slowly on to his chest, so that he rested with his mouth upwards, and his head entirely out of the water, Barret struck out for the spar, swimming thus on his back.  On reaching it, he found to his surprise that it was the experimental raft, and that the captain, Mabberly, and McGregor were already clinging to it.  \"Won't bear us all, I fear,\" said Mabberly; \"but thank God that we have it.  Put the boy on.\"  In order to do this, Barret had to get upon the raft, and he found that it bore him easily as well as the boy.  \"Have you seen Jackman?\" asked Mabberly.  \"Yes,\" replied Barret, rising and looking round.  \"Here he comes, towing Quin, I think, who seems to be stunned.  Hallo! This way--hi!  Giles!\"  But Giles suddenly ceased to swim, turned over on his back, and lay as if dead.  \"Rescue, Bob, rescue!\" shouted Barret, plunging into the water. Mabberly followed, and soon had hold of Giles and his man by the hair.  \"All right!\" said Jackman, turning round; \"I was only taking a rest.  No one lost, I hope?\"  \"No; all safe, so far.\"  \"You can tow him in now.  I'm almost used up,\" said Jackman, making for the raft.  \"He's only stunned, I think.\"  It was found that the Irishman had in truth been only stunned when they lifted him on to the raft, for he soon began to show signs of returning life, and a large bump on his head sufficiently explained the nature of his injury.  But when the whole party had cautiously clambered up on the raft it sank so deep that they scarcely dared to move.  To make matters worse, they clearly distinguished the steamer's whistle going farther and farther away, as if she were searching for them in a wrong direction.  This was indeed the case, and although they all shouted singly and together, the whistle grew fainter by degrees, and finally died away.  With feelings approaching to despair, the crew of the frail raft began to talk of the prospect before them, when they were silenced by a slight movement in the mist.  The white curtain was lifted for a few yards, and revealed to their almost incredulous eyes a rocky shore, backed by a range of precipitous cliffs, with a wild mountainous region beyond.  As the sea was still perfectly calm, there was no surf.  Our castaways, therefore, with "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23373"],["title","The Eagle Cliff (#5)"],["body","exception of Quin and the boy, quietly slipped into the water, and, with thankful hearts, propelled the raft vigorously towards the shore.    CHAPTER THREE.  THE WRECK IS FOLLOWED BY REPOSE, REFRESHMENT, SURPRISE, AND DISASTER.  The distance from land was not more than a few hundred yards; nevertheless, it occupied a considerable time to pass over that space, the raft being ill-adapted for quick progression through the water.  Close to the shore there was a flat rock, to which, as they approached it, their attention was drawn by the appearance of what seemed to be living creatures of some sort.  Quin and Robin Tips, sitting on the raft, naturally saw them first.  \"I do belave it's men, for they're liftin' their hids an' lookin' at us. Av it was the South Says, now, I'd say they was saviges peepin' at us over the rocks.\"  \"P'raps they're boys a-bathin',\" suggested Tips.  \"Are they white?\" asked Captain McPherson, who, being chin-deep in the water and behind the raft, could not see the rock referred to.  \"No; sure they seem to be grey, or blue.\"  \"Oo, they'll be seals,\" returned the skipper, nasally--a tone which is eminently well adapted for sarcastic remark without the necessity of elaborate language.  \"In coorse they is,\" said Tips; \"don't you see they're a-heavin' up their tails as well as their 'eads?\"  On advancing a few yards farther, all doubt upon the question was put at rest.  The animals, of which about a dozen were enjoying themselves on the rock, raised themselves high on their flippers and gazed, with enormous eyes, at the strange-looking monster that was coming in from the sea!  Thus they remained, apparently paralysed with astonishment, until the raft was within pistol-shot, and then, unable to endure the suspense longer, they all slipped off into the sea.  A few minutes later and the raft struck on the shore.  And well was it for the party that the weather chanced to be so fine, for if there had been anything like a breeze, their frail contrivance would inevitably have been dashed to pieces.  Even a slight swell from the westward would have raised such a surf on that rugged shore that it would have been impossible for the best of swimmers to have landed without broken limbs, if not loss of life.  As it was, they got ashore not only without difficulty, but even succeeded in hauling the raft up on the beach without much damage to its parts--though, of course, the unfortunate fowls in the hen-coops had all perished!  While Mabberly and the others were engaged in securing the raft, Barret was sent off along shore with directions to ascertain whether there was any habitation near.  To his right the high cliffs came down so close to the sea that it seemed very improbable that any cottage or hamlet could be found in that direction.  He therefore turned towards the left, where the cliffs receded some distance from the shore, leaving a narrow strip of meadow land.  Hurrying forward about a quarter of a mile, he stopped and looked about him.  The sun was still high in the heavens--for the days are long and nights brief in that region during summer--and its rays had so far scattered the mists that all the low-lying land was clear, though the mountain-range inland was only visible a short distance above its base. The effect of this was to enhance the weird grandeur of the view, for when the eye had traced the steep glens, overhanging cliffs, rugged water-courses, and sombre corries upward to the point where all was lost in cloud, the imagination was set free to continue the scenery to illimitable heights.  The youth was still gazing upward, with solemnised feelings, when there was presented to him one of those curious aspects of nature which are sometimes, though rarely, witnessed in mountainous regions.  Suddenly an opening occurred in the clouds--or mist--which shrouded the mountain-tops, and the summit of a stupendous cliff bathed in rich sunshine, was seen as if floating in the air.  Although obviously part of the mountain near the base of which he stood, this cliff--completely isolated as it was--seemed a magical effect, and destitute of any real connection with earth.  While he was looking in wonder and admiration at the sight, he observed a bird hovering about motionless in the blue vault high above the cliffs.  Although inexperienced in such scenery and sights, Barret knew well enough that nothing but an eagle--and that of the largest size-- could be visible at all at such a distance.  Suddenly the bird sailed downwards with a grand circular sweep, and was lost among the shadows of the perpendicular rocks.  A few minutes more and the mists drifted over the opening, causing the vision to disappear.  This was Barret's first view of the Eagle Cliff, which was destined to exercise a powerful and lasting influence upon his fortunes!  A few yards beyond this the explorer came upon a sheep track, and a little farther on he found one of those primitive roads which are formed in wild out-of-the-way places by the passage of light country carts, with the aid of a few rounded stones where holes required to be filled up, or soft places strengthened.  Following it a short distance to a spot where it ran between a precipice and the shore, he came suddenly in sight of a wilderness of fallen rocks, which were varied in size from mere pebbles to masses the size of an omnibus.  These had all fallen from a steep spur of the mountains which projected towards the sea of that place.  The whole of the level land at the base of the spur was strewn with them; some being old, moss-covered and weather-worn, others fresh and sharp in outline, as if they had fallen only the previous winter, as probably they had, for the places from which they had been dislodged could be seen still fresh and light-coloured, nearly a thousand feet up on the riven cliffs.  It was a species of desolation that powerfully recalled some scenes in Dante's \"Inferno,\" and had a depressing effect on the youth's spirits, for nothing seemed more unlikely than the existence of a human habitation in such a place.  A new view of the matter broke upon him, however, when he suddenly became aware that a spot in the confused scene which he had taken to be a clump of withered bracken was in reality a red cow!  Looking a little more narrowly at objects he soon perceived a hut among the rocks.  It was so small and rude and rugged as almost to escape detection.  A furious barking soon told that he had been seen, and two collie dogs rushed towards him with demonstrations that threatened him with immolation on the spot.  The uproar put life into a few more clumps of red bracken, and produced a lively display of sheep and cattle throughout the region.  Barret walked straight up to the door of the hut, and the collies withdrew from the attack--as most noisy demonstrators do when treated with silent indifference.  \"Is there any one inside?\" he asked of a bare-legged, shaggy-headed boy, who came out and gazed at him, apparently with his mouth as well as his eyes.  \"Na,\" answered the boy.  \"Any other cottages or houses near this?\"  \"Ay; yonder.\"  The boy pointed in the direction of the sea, where, in a stony nook between two jutting masses of rock, nestled about a dozen huts built of boulder stones gathered from the sea-shore.  So small were these huts, and so stupendous the rocks around them, that they might easily have been overlooked by a careless eye.  So might the half-dozen fishing-boats that lay in the little cove beside them.  A stream or rivulet--better known in Scotland as a burn--ran past the hamlet, formed a pool just below it, and dropped into the cove close to the place where the boats lay.  Rejoiced to find even the poorest kind of shelter in such a place, Barret hastened down to the cove, and, tapping at the door of the largest of the cottages, was bidden \"come in\" by a soft voice.  Entering, he was surprised to find a neatly, though plainly, furnished room, which was evidently the kitchen of the house--indeed, the sole room, with the exception of an off-shoot closet.  The large open fireplace contained a peat fire on the hearth, over which hung a bubbling pot.  There were two box-beds opposite the fire, and in the wall which faced the door there was a very small window, containing four panes of glass, each of which had a knot in the middle of it.  One of them also presented the phenomenon of a flattened nose, for the boy with the ragged head had rushed down and stationed himself there to observe the result of the unexpected and singular visit.  Beside the window, in a homely arm-chair, sat an invalid girl with pale thin cheeks, bright blue eyes, and long flaxen hair.  If not pretty, she was, at all events, extremely interesting, and possessed the great charm of a winning smile.  Apologising for causing her alarm by his damp, dishevelled, and sudden appearance, Barret asked if there were any men about the place.  No, there were none there at the moment; most of them being out after the sheep and cattle, and some gathering peat, or away in the boats.  \"But surely they have not left you all by yourself?\" said Barret, struck not only by the appearance of the girl, but by the comparative refinement of her language.  \"Oh no!\" she replied, with a slight smile; \"they look well after me. Mrs Anderson has only gone to fetch some peats.  But where have you come from, sir?  Your clothes are all wet!\"  \"You are right.  I have just been saved from drowning, through God's mercy, along with my companions.\"  Here Barret gave her a brief outline of the recent disaster, and then asked if Mrs Anderson was her mother.  \"No; she is my aunt, but she is very good to me; takes as much care of me as if I was her own daughter.  I don't belong to this place.  They have sent me here for my health.\"  At this point they were interrupted by Mrs Anderson herself, who entered with a load of peat, which she flung down, shook her fist at the nose-flattener outside, and turned in"]]]
