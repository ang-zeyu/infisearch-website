Whatever is done in London, you generally find that just the contrary is done in Paris.\"  \"Don't we have any thing, then, after dinner?\" asked Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George. \"The French generally go and take a seat at a little round table on the sidewalk, and have a little glass of brandy and a cigar.\"  Here Rollo threw his head back, and laughed loud and long. He was greatly amused at the idea of his making an allowance, in calculating how far his five francs would go, for a glass of brandy and a cigar. Mr. George himself, sedate as he was, could not but smile.  \"The fact is,\" said he, at length, \"there are only two meals to calculate for, and they will not cost, upon an average, more than three francs and a half, if we are prudent and economical, and go to plain and not expensive places. But then there is the immense amount that you will be always wishing to spend for cakes, and candy, and oranges, and nuts, and bonbons of all sorts and kinds. There is an endless variety of such things in Paris. You will find half a dozen cake shops in every street, with fifty different kinds of gingerbread and cake in them, all of the richest and most delicious description.\"  \"Yes,\" said Rollo, \"I shall want some of those things.\"  \"No doubt,\" said Mr. George, \"you will make yourself sick eating them, I'll venture to say, before you have been in Paris twenty-four hours.\"  \"No,\" said Rollo, shaking his head resolutely; \"and I think I had better take the five francs and pay my own board.\"  \"Very well,\" said Mr. George, \"and that provides for every thing except incidentals. Your father said that I might pay you five francs a day for incidentals and pocket money. That is to include all your personal expenses of every kind, except what we have already provided for. There will be excursions, and tickets to concerts and shows, and carriage hire, and toys that you will want to buy, and all such things. The amount of it is, that your father pays all your expenses for transportation, for lodging, and for casualties. You pay every thing else, and are allowed ten francs a day for it. I am to be treasurer, and to have the whole charge of your funds, except so far as I find it prudent and safe to intrust them to you, and you are to buy nothing at all against my consent.\"  \"Nothing at all?\" asked Rollo.  \"No,\" said Mr. George, \"nothing at all. You are not to expend a single centime in any way that I object to.\"  \"What is a centime?\" asked Rollo.  \"It is of the value of less than one fourth of a cent,\" replied Mr. George.  \"But I should think I might buy such little things as that would come to, of myself,\" said Rollo. \"Suppose I should wish to buy a small piece of gingerbread for a cent.\"  \"Say for a sou,\"[A] replied Mr. George. \"There are no cents in Paris.\"  [A] Pronounced _soo_.  \"Well,\" rejoined Rollo, \"suppose I should wish to spend a _sou_ for gingerbread, and eat it, and you should object to it.\"  \"Very well,\" replied Mr. George; \"and suppose you were to wish to spend a sou for poison, and drink it.\"  \"But I should not be likely to buy poison,\" said Rollo, laughing.  \"Nor should I be likely to object to your buying gingerbread,\" rejoined Mr. George. \"A boy, however, may, it is clear, do mischief with a little money as well as with a great deal; and, therefore, the power in his guardian should be absolute and entire. At any rate, so it is in this case. If I see fit to forbid your expending a single sou for any thing whatever, I can, and you will have no remedy till we see your father again; and then you can ask him to put you under some other person's care. Until he does this, however, the control is absolute and entire in my hands. I would not take charge of a boy on any other terms.\"  \"Well,\" said Rollo, \"I agree to it.\"  \"And now,\" said Mr. George, \"I am ready to begin your account.\"  Mr. George then took a small account book from his pocket book as he said this, and, opening it at the beginning, he wrote across the top of the two pages which came together the words,  _Rollo Holiday, in Account with his Father._  On the corner of the left-hand page he wrote Dr., which stands for debtor; and on that of the right-hand page, Cr., which stands for creditor.  \"There,\" said he, \"now I shall enter, from time to time, on the creditor side, all the money that becomes due to you; and on the debtor side, all that I pay to you. Then, by striking a balance, we can always tell how much of your money there is in my hands.  \"Let me see,\" continued Mr. George. \"Your father and mother concluded finally to go by the way of Folkstone. The fare that way is two pound eleven. This way, it is one pound four. I am to pay you the difference. The difference is one pound seven; and one pound seven, in francs, is--let me see how much.\"  Mr. George made a calculation with a pencil and paper, and found that it amounted to thirty-three francs seventy-five centimes.  \"I don't understand reckoning by francs and centimes very well,\" said Rollo.  \"No,\" replied Mr. George, \"that is your misfortune; and you'll have to bear it as well as you can till you get out of it.\"  So Mr. George entered the francs--thirty-three seventy-five--in Rollo's book.  \"You have got thirty-three francs to begin with,\" said he; \"that's a pretty good stock.  \"Now, there is your allowance of ten francs per day. I will enter that weekly. There are three days in this week, including to-day and Sunday. That makes thirty francs.\"  So Mr. George entered the thirty francs.  \"There,\" said he, \"the whole amount due you up to Monday morning is sixty-three francs seventy-five centimes. That is sixty-three francs and three fourths. A hundred centimes make a franc.  \"And now,\" continued Mr. George, \"I will make you a payment, so as to put you in funds, and that must be put down on the other side. How much would you like?\"  \"I don't know,\" said Rollo; \"a few francs, I suppose.\"  \"Have you got a purse?\" asked Mr. George. \"Let me see it.\"  So Rollo took out a small leather bag which he had bought in London.  \"That's it,\" said Mr. George. \"I'll give you ten francs. When you want more, you can have it--that is, provided it is due to you.\"  Here Mr. George rang a bell, and a waiter came in immediately. Mr. George handed the waiter a sovereign, and asked him to get change for it in French money. The waiter took the money, and presently came in with five five-franc pieces. These he presented very respectfully to Mr. George. Mr. George took two of them and gave them to Rollo. The others he put into his own pocket. The five-franc pieces were very bright and new, and they were of about the size of silver dollars. Rollo was very much pleased with his portion, and put them in his purse, quite proud of having so much spending money.  \"And you say that I must not spend any of it without first asking you,\" said Rollo.  \"O, no,\" replied Mr. George, \"I have not said any such thing. That would be a great deal of trouble, both for you and for me.\"  \"But I thought you said that I was not to spend any thing without your consent.\"  [Illustration: THE DINNER AT NEW HAVEN.]  \"No,\" said Mr. George, \"I said _against_ my consent. I may forbid your spending whenever I think proper; but I shall not do so, so long as I find you always ask me in doubtful cases. Spend for yourself freely, whenever you are sure it is right. When you are not sure, ask me. If I find you abuse the privilege, I shall have to restrict you. Otherwise, not.\"  Rollo was well satisfied with this understanding of the case; and just then the waiter came in, bearing a handsome silver tureen containing soup, which he put down upon the table, between Mr. George and Rollo. So the writing materials and the purses were put away, and the two travellers were soon occupied very busily in eating their dinner.     CHAPTER II.  CROSSING THE CHANNEL.   Mr. Holiday had two reasons for making the arrangements described in the last chapter, in respect to Rollo's expenses. In the first place, it would gratify Rollo himself, who would feel more independent, and more like a man, he thought, in being allowed thus, in some measure, to have the charge and control of his own expenditures. But his second and principal reason was, that he might accustom his son, in early life, to bear pecuniary responsibilities, and to exercise judgment and discretion in the use of money. Many young men never have any training of this sort till they become of age. Before that time, whenever they wish for money, they go to their father and ask for it. They take all they can get; and when that is gone, they go and ask for more. They have no direct personal motive for exercising prudence and economy, and they have no experience of the evils that result from thriftlessness and prodigality. It is much better for all children that they should have pecuniary responsibilities, such as are suited to their years, thrown upon them in their youth, when the mistakes they make in acquiring their experience are of little moment. The same mistakes made after they become of age might be their ruin.  In carrying the system into effect in Rollo's case, there seemed to be something very abrupt, at least, if not positively harsh, in Mr. George's mode of dealing with him. And yet Rollo did not dislike it. He felt that his uncle was treating him more like a man, on this account, or rather more like a large boy, and not like a child. In fact, a part of the rough handling which Rollo got from his uncle was due to this very circumstance--Mr. George having observed that he did not mind being knocked about a little.  After dinner, Rollo proposed to his uncle that they should go out and take a walk.  \"I will go with you a few minutes,\" said Mr. George, \"and then I must return to my room, and write up my journal.\"  \"Say half an hour,\" rejoined Rollo.  \"Well,\" replied "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22956"],["title","Rollo in Paris (#3)"],["body","Mr. George, \"we will say half an hour.\"  So they sallied forth upon the pier behind the hotel. Mr. George took a general survey of the harbor, and of the vessels that were lying in it, and also of the peaks and headlands which were seen at the mouth of it, toward the sea.  \"I should like to be on that hill,\" said Mr. George, \"to look off over the channel, and see if I could discern the coast of France from it.\"  \"Let's go there,\" said Rollo.  \"That would take more than half an hour,\" replied Mr. George.  \"Well, at any rate, let's go on board the steamer,\" said Rollo.  So, taking Mr. George by the hand, he led him along to the brink of the pier. Mr. George looked over, and saw the steamer lying at rest in its muddy bed below.  \"Is it possible?\" said Mr. George, in a tone of great astonishment.  \"Can it be possible?\" repeated Mr. George.  \"What?\" inquired Rollo. \"What is it that surprises you so much?\"  \"Why, to find such a steamer as this for the travel on one of the great thoroughfares between England and France. Let's go down on board.\"  So Mr. George led the way, and Rollo followed down the plank. The plank landed them on the top of the paddle box. From that place, a few steps led to the deck. They walked along the deck a short distance toward the stern, and there they found a door, and a small winding staircase leading down into the cabin. They descended these stairs, one before the other, for the space was not wide enough to allow of their going together; and when they reached the foot of them they found themselves in a small cabin, with one tier of berths around the sides. The cabin was not high enough for two. There were berths for about twenty or thirty passengers. The cabin was very neatly finished; and there was a row of cushioned seats around it, in front of the berths. In one corner, by the side of the door where Mr. George and Rollo had come in, was a small desk, with writing materials upon it. This Rollo supposed must be the \"captain's office.\"  While Mr. George sat surveying the scene, and mentally comparing this insignificant boat to the magnificent steamers on the Hudson River, in America, with their splendid and capacious cabins on three different decks, their promenade saloons, sometimes one hundred and fifty feet long, with ranges of elegant state rooms on either hand, and sofas, and couches, and _tête-à-têtes_ without number, in the middle, his perplexity increased.  \"I do not understand it at all,\" said he to Rollo. \"I thought that there would at least be as much travelling between London and Paris, the two greatest cities in the world, as between New York and Albany. And yet there are half a dozen steamers every day on the North River, carrying from five hundred to one thousand passengers; while here, on the most direct and cheapest route between London and Paris, is one single steamer, that could not possibly carry one hundred passengers, and she only goes once in two days.\"  Just then a young man, who seemed to be the clerk of the boat, came down the cabin stairs, and, seeing Mr. George and Rollo there, he asked them if they had taken their berths. They said that they had not; but they immediately proceeded to choose their berths, or rather their _places_, for there were no divisions separating the sleeping-places from each other except what was formed by the cushions. There was a long cushion for each sleeper, covered with crimson velvet or plush; and a round cushion, shaped like a bolster, and covered in the same way, for his head. On these cushions the passengers were expected to lie down without undressing, placing themselves in a row, head to head, and feet to feet. Mr. George chose two of these sleeping-places, one for himself, and the other for Rollo, and the clerk marked them with a ticket.  Our two travellers then went up on deck again, and from the deck they ascended the plank to the pier. It was now nearly sunset, and it was a very pleasant evening. They sauntered slowly along the pier, until they came to a place where some steps led down to the water. There were several small boats at the foot of the steps, and in one of them was a man doing something to the rudder. Rollo saw that on the other side of the water was another long staircase leading down from the bank there, so as to form a landing-place for small boats at all times of tide. He also looked up and down the harbor, but he could see no bridge, and so he supposed that this must be a sort of ferry for the people who wished to cross from one side to the other.  As soon as the man who was in the boat saw Mr. George and Rollo standing upon the pier, he rose up in his boat, and touching his hat at the same time, or rather making a sort of jerk with his hand, which was meant to represent a touch of the hat, he asked him if he would like to be rowed across to the other side.  \"Why, I don't know,\" said Mr. George. \"What's the ferriage?\"  \"That's just as the gentleman pleases,\" said the man, with another jerk at his hat.  \"And how much do they generally please?\" said Mr. George. \"What's the common custom?\"  \"O, gentlemen gives us what they likes,\" said the man. \"We always leaves it to them entirely.\"  Mr. George was silent. After a moment's pause, the boatman said again,--  \"Would you like to go, sir? Very nice boat.\"  \"Not on those terms,\" said Mr. George. \"If you will tell me what the usual ferriage is, I can then tell you whether we wish to go or not.\"  \"Well, sir,\" replied the man, \"gentlemen usually gives us about twopence apiece.\"  \"Twopence apiece. Very well, we will go.\"  Mr. George did not wait to ask Rollo whether he would like to go before he decided the question. He would have considered this a mere waste of time, for Rollo was always ready to go, no matter where.  So they got into the boat, and were rowed across the water. They ascended the stairs on the other side, and walked a little way in a smooth road which led along the bank. Rollo wished to go farther; but Mr. George said that his time had expired, and that he must go back. \"But you may stay,\" said he to Rollo, \"as long as you please, provided that you come back before dark.\"  Rollo was much pleased with this permission, as he wished to go to the top of the hill, at the outlet of the harbor, and look at the prospect. He promised to return before dark.  \"Have you any change,\" said Mr. George, \"to pay your ferriage back?\"  \"No,\" said Rollo, \"I have nothing but my five-franc pieces.\"  \"Then I will lend you twopence,\" said Mr. George. \"You can pay me the first change you get in France.\"  \"But I cannot get any pennies in France,\" said Rollo.  \"True,\" said Mr. George; \"you will get sous there. You must pay me four sous. A penny is equal to two sous.  \"I will pay your bill at the hotel, too,\" continued Mr. George, \"as I suppose they will make out yours and mine together, and you can pay me your share to-morrow, when we land. Here is your ticket, however. You must take charge of that.\"  \"But suppose I lose it?\" asked Rollo.  \"Then you will have to pay over again,\" said Mr. George; \"that is all. You will lose about twenty francs; unless, indeed,\" he continued, \"your father should call it a casualty.\"  So Mr. George went back to the boat, and Rollo continued his walk, thinking on the way of the question which his uncle had suggested, whether his father would consider the loss of his ticket a casualty or not. He determined, however, very resolutely, that he would not lose it; and so he put it away safely in his wallet, and then went on. The road was very smooth and pleasant to walk in, being bordered by green fields on the one hand, and the water of the harbor on the other. Rollo came at length to the hill. There were successive terraces, with houses built upon them, on the sides of the hill, and paths leading to the summit. Rollo had a fine view of the sea, and of the vessels and steamers which were passing slowly in the offing, on their way up and down the channel; but though he looked long and eagerly for the coast of France, it was not to be seen.  Rollo rambled about the hill for a considerable time; for at that season of the year the twilight continued very long, and it did not become dark till quite late. When, at length, the shadows of the evening began to shut in upon the landscape, he returned to the ferry, and the ferryman rowed him back again to the hotel.  It was now nearly nine o'clock, and, of course, three hours remained before the time of embarkation would arrive. Rollo was not sorry for this, as he thought that there would be enough to amuse and occupy him all this time on and around the pier. His first duty, however, was to go and report himself to Mr. George as having returned from his walk. This he did. He found his uncle very busy in his room, writing his journal.  \"Now, Rollo,\" said Mr. George, \"it is three hours before we are to leave. What are you going to do all that time?\"  \"O, I shall find plenty to amuse myself with,\" said Rollo.  \"Very well,\" said Mr. George. \"You may play about wherever you are sure it is safe. Don't go near the edge of the pier, unless there is somebody at hand to pull you out of the water with a boathook, if you fall in. Amuse yourself as long as you can; and when you are tired of taking care of yourself, come to me, and I will tell you what to do.\"  Rollo, having received these instructions, left his uncle to his work, and went away. He descended the stairs, and went out upon the pier again, and after amusing himself, by examining every thing there, he concluded to go on board the steamer. A train of cars had arrived from London while he and his uncle had been on the other side of the water, and there were now several new passengers in the cabin, who were choosing and marking their berths, or talking together about the voyage.  Rollo thought that, in order to make sure that his ticket was all right, he would climb up into his berth and see; and then, when he was there, it seemed to him a very funny place to sleep"]]]
