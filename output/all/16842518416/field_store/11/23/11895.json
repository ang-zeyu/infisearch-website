Kerrison and Company the next day cleaned up ten and a-half ounces from two rockers, which I saw myself weighed.  This bar is acknowledged to be one of the richest ever seen, and well it may be, for here is a product of fifteen and a-half ounces of gold, worth 247 and a half dollars, or 50 pounds sterling, from it in a day and a-half to the labour of two rockers.  Old Californian miners say they never saw such rich diggings.  The average result per day to the man was fully 20 dollars, some much more.  The gold is very fine; so much so, that it was impossible to save more than two-thirds of what went through the rockers.  This defect in the rocker must be remedied by the use of quicksilver to `amalgamate' the finer particles of gold.  This remedy is at hand, for California produces quicksilver sufficient for the consumption of the `whole' world in her mountains of Cinnabar.  Supplies are going on by every vessel.  At Sailor Diggings, above Fort Yale, they are doing very well, averaging from 8 to 25 dollars per day to the man.  I am told that the gold is much coarser on Thompson River than it is in Fraser River.  I saw yesterday about 250 dollars of coarse gold from Thompson River, in pieces averaging 5 dollars each.  Some of the pieces had quartz among them.  Hill, who was the first miner on the bar bearing his name, just above spoken of, with his partner, has made some 600 dollars on it in almost sixteen days' work.  Three men just arrived from Sailor Diggings have brought down 670 dollars in dust, the result of twelve days' work. Gold very fine.  Rising of the river driving the miners off for a time.\"  Correspondents from several places on the Sound, both on the British and American territories, men of various nationalities, have since written that the country on the Fraser River is rich in gold, and \"equal to any discoveries ever made in California.\"  The _Times'_ correspondent, writing from Vancouver's Island on 10th June, says, \"The gold exists from the mouth of Fraser River for at least 200 miles up, and most likely much further, but it has not been explored; hitherto any one working on its banks has been able to obtain gold in abundance and without extraordinary labour; the gold at present obtained has been within a foot of the surface, and is supposed to have averaged about ten dollars per diem to each man engaged in mining.  Of course, some obtain more, some less, but all get gold.  Thompson River is quite as rich in gold as Fraser River.  The land about Thompson River consists of extensive sandy prairies, which are loaded with gold also; in fact, the whole country about Fraser and Thompson Rivers are mere beds of gold, so abundant as to make it quite disgusting.  I have already seen pounds and pounds of it, and hope before long to feast my eyes upon tons of the precious metal.\"  And the same high authority writes on 17th June,--\"There is no longer room to doubt that all the country bordering on Fraser River is one continuous gold bed.  Miners abandoning the partially exhausted _placers_ of California, are thronging to this new _Dorado_, and the heretofore tranquil precincts of Victoria are now the scene of an excitement such as was witnessed at San Francisco in 1849, or since in Melbourne.  Land has run up to prices fabulously high; and patches that six months ago were, perhaps, grudgingly purchased at the colonial price of 20 shillings the acre, are re-selling daily at a hundred times that amount.  The small number of steam ships hitherto found sufficient for the commerce between San Francisco and these vicinities no longer suffices to convey a tithe of the eager applicants for passage.  An opening for the enterprise of British capitalists such as was not anticipated has thus suddenly arisen, and the opportunity will, of course, be seized with alacrity.  \"Lest I should appear too sanguine in my representations, I will cite one instance to illustrate the richness of these newly discovered diggings.  Three men returned for provisions lately, after an absence of seven days; they had during this interval extracted 179 ounces of gold. I state this fact on the authority of Governor Douglas, who has just returned from the mining regions, whither he went with the view of establishing certain regulations for the maintenance of order.  In short, all who have visited the mines are impressed with the conviction that their richness far excels that of California in its palmiest days.\"  And, again, the correspondent of the _New York Times_, in a letter dated 21st June, gives the following corroborative testimony:--\"The gold is found everywhere, and even during the extreme height of the river, parties are averaging from ten to twenty dollars per day, digging in the banks or on the upper edge of the bars, nearly all of which are overflowed.  Big strikes of from fifty to two hundred and fifty dollars are frequently reported.  Nearly all the work at present is carried on between Forts Langley and Yale, and for some twenty or thirty miles above the latter an entire distance along the river of about a hundred miles.  Some few are digging on Harrison River, and other tributaries, where the gold is found in larger particles.  Those who were engaged in mining on the forks of Thompson River shew still richer yields, but have been compelled to leave on account of the high stage of the water, the want of provisions, and the opposition of the Indians.  The gold where the most men are located (upon the bars of the river), is found in very minute particles, like sand.  No quicksilver has been used as, yet, but when that is attainable, their yield is sure to be greatly augmented. At Hill's Bar those at work had averaged fifty dollars per day the whole time they had been there.  The Indians all have gold, and are as much excited as the whites.  It is of no use to cite various reports of individual successes in this or that locality.  The impression of all who have gone is unanimous and conclusive as to the great facts of new gold fields now being explored equal to any ever yet developed in California or elsewhere.  No steamer has yet returned with more than twelve or fifteen passengers, and nearly every one of these had come down to obtain supplies for himself or his party left behind in the diggings.  They all say they are going back in a few weeks.\"  The following personal testimony may also be cited:--\"On Sunday,\" says the _San Francisco Globe_, \"we received a visit from Messrs. Edward Campbell and Joseph Blanch, both boatmen, well known in this city, who have just returned from the mines on Fraser River.  They mined for ten days on the bar, until compelled to desist from the rise in the river, in which time they took out 1340 dollars.  They used but one rocker, and have no doubt that they could have done much better with proper appliances.  There were from sixty to seventy white men at work on Hill's Bar, and from four to five hundred Indians, men, women, and children.  The Indians are divided in opinion with regard to Americans; the more numerous party, headed by Pollock, a chief, are disposed to receive them favourably, because they obtain more money, for their labour from the `Bostons' than from `King George's men', as they style the English.  They have learned the full value of their labour, and, instead of one dollar a-day, or an old shirt, for guiding and helping to work a boat up the river, they now charge from five to eight dollars per day.  Another portion of the Indians are in favour of driving off the `Bostons,' being fearful of having their country overrun by them.\"  The proprietor of the San Francisco _News Letter_ had determined to be at the centre of the present excitement in the El Dorado, and to judge for himself, or, rather to solve the problem of how much gold, how many Indians, and how much humbug, went on board the Pacific mail steam-ship _Cortes_, Captain Horner, and made the passage to Victoria, 840 miles, in five days.  Although nine hundred persons were on board, yet no actual inconvenience was felt by the high-pressure packing; the greatest good humour and accommodating spirit prevailing, controlled by the gentlemanly conduct of Captain J.B. Horner and his officers.  On the day of arrival, the operations of the Government Land Office at the fort in Victoria was 26,000 dollars.  The importance of the amount can best be realised by comparing it with the prices, viz. 100 dollars per lot, 60 by 100 feet, unsurveyed.  Some of these lots have been sold at 200 to 1000 dollars.  Lots at first sale, surveyed price, 50 dollars; lots, second and last sale, 100 dollars each, are now being sold from 500 to 1000 dollars each.  Six lots together in the principal street are valued at 10,000 dollars.  The figures at Esquimault Harbour and lots in that vicinity assume a bolder character as to value, from the fact that the harbour is a granite-bound basin, similar to Victoria, with an entrance now wide and deep enough to admit the Leviathan.  Victoria has a bar which must be dredged, dug, or blown away.  We noted at Victoria that the most valuable lot, with a flat granite level, with thirty feet of water, sufficient for any ship to unload without jetty, is now covered by a large building constructed of logs, belonging to Samuel Price and Company.  A ship was unloading lumber at this wharf at 35 dollars per M, which was the ruling price.  At Victoria, on the 21st June, a Frenchman landed from the steamer _Surprise_, who came on board at Fort Langley with twenty-seven pounds weight of gold on his person, which we saw and lifted.  Another passenger, whom we know, states that there are six hundred persons within eight miles of Fort Hope, who"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23389"],["title","Handbook to the new Gold-fields (#3)"],["body","averaging per man an ounce and a half of gold per day minimum to six and a half ounces per day maximum.  The largest sums seem to be taken out at Sailor's Bar, five miles above Fort Hope.  The lowest depth as yet reached by miners is fifteen inches; these mere surface scratches producing often 200 dollars per day.  At Fort Hope, potatoes were selling at 6 dollars per bag; bacon, 75 cents per pound; crackers, 30 cents.  From Fort Hope to Fort Thompson the road is good, with the exception of twenty miles.  For 20 dollars, the steamers will take miners from Victoria to the diggings at Fort Hope, and for three or four dollars more an Indian will accompany you to Fort Yale.  Bowen, steward of the _Surprise_, says that about a hundred Indians usually ran after him to obtain little sweet cakes, which he traded off four or five for 1 dollar in gold dust. Sugar at Fort Langley, 1 dollar 50 cents per pound; lumber, 1 dollar 50 cents per foot; tea and coffee, 1 dollar per pound; pierced iron for rockers, 8 dollars; plain sheets, 2 dollars each; five pounds of quicksilver sold for 40 dollars--10 dollars per pound was the ordinary price.  The actual ground prospected and ascertained to be highly auriferous extends to three hundred and fifty miles from the mouth of Fraser River.  One hundred miles of Thompson River has been prospected, and found to be rich, south-east of Fraser River.  The same will apply to all the tributaries of Thompson River.  A large extent of auriferous quartz has been discovered ten miles from Fort Hope.  Exceedingly rich quartz veins have been found on Harrison River.  The most astounding facts have yet to be divulged.  A river emptying into the Gulf of Georgia, not a hundred miles north of Fraser River hitherto supposed to contain no gold, has proved fabulously rich.  An Indian arrived at Victoria from this locality, having twenty-three pounds weight of pure gold, obtained solely by his own labour, in less than twenty days.  In confirmation of our figures, and being short of space, we append the following statistics, derived from an official and authentic source of the strictest reliability.  We deem the above facts sufficient to cause an exodus of a far more alarming character, and of higher proportions as to number, than any hitherto known in history. Suffice it to say, that the present _furore_ is well founded; that it holds out busy times, high prices, speculations, contracts, and employments of a thousand kinds.

The best means of judging what grounds there are for the belief in the existence of gold in large quantities on its banks, is by letters received from persons who are engaged in mining.  It is worthy of note that there is no discrepancy between the accounts given by different individuals, all their statements agreeing.  The mines are reported to be exceedingly rich, and yielding large returns to those engaged in digging.  The river is very high, and miners have been driven from several of the most lucrative bars until the water subsides.  Mr Hill, from whom Hill's Bar took its name, is mining some distance above that point.  He and six hands were making from an ounce to an ounce and a-half of gold dust a day to each man.  For three weeks prior to the freshet, Mr Hill and one man averaged one hundred to one hundred and fifty dollars a day.  The freshet, however drove him off for the time being.  Mr E.R. Collins, who has spent some time in the Fraser River gold region, and who brought down last week a quantity of dust, has communicated the following intelligence to the _Alta California_.  Mr Collins is a trustworthy gentleman.  He left San Francisco in March last, and was at Olympia when the excitement first broke out.  He then, in company with three others, proceeded to Point Roberts, from whence they proceeded up Fraser River to the mouth of Harrison River, about twenty-five miles above Fort Langley.  This portion of the journey they performed without guides or assistance from the natives.  The current was moderate, and occasionally beautiful islands were discovered with heavy timber, which presented a beautiful appearance.  From Fort Hope to Fort Yale, a distance of fifteen miles, the river runs narrow, and the current running about seven miles per hour, though, in some places, it might be set down at ten or twelve.  At Fort Yale, the first mining bar was reached.  It extended out from the left bank a distance of some thirty yards, and was about half a mile long.  Twenty or thirty squaws were at work with baskets and wooden trays, while, near by, large numbers of male Indians stood listlessly looking on.  Here some of Mr Collins' companions, who had now increased to twenty, proposed to stop and try their luck, but the majority resolved to go on, having informed themselves satisfactorily that further up the \"big chunks\" were in abundance.  After resting a while, therefore, the party went ahead.  Two miles from Fort Yale they entered upon the commencement of the real difficulties and dangers of navigation on Fraser River, the water for a distance of thirty-five or forty miles passing through deep gloomy canons, and over high masses of rock.  At this time the river had attained only a few feet above its usual height, so that by perseverance and the skill of the native boatman they were enabled to make slow progress.  Numerous portages were made--one of them, the last, being four miles long.  These portages could not be avoided, the cliffs rising perpendicularly on either side of the river, sometimes to a height of fifty or sixty feet, affording not the slightest footpath on which to tow.  At other places the whirls, and rocks partly submerged, rendered a water passage utterly impracticable.  At every bar and shallow spot prospected in these wild localities gold was obtained in paying quantities, all of very fine quality--rather difficult to save without the use of quicksilver.  From the head of the canons to the forks of Thompson's River, thirty-five miles more, the current and general appearance of the river seemed about the same as from Fort Hope to Fort Yale, gold also being found where there was an opportunity for a fair \"prospect\".  At the Forks the party were told by Travill, a French trader, whom they met by accident, that the richest and best diggings were up Thompson's; but that river being navigable but a few miles up, it was thought best to keep on up Fraser, which they did for a distance of forty miles, encountering no serious obstacles beyond a few rapids, and they were passed by towing.  Five miles above the Forks some twenty white men were at work, making with common rockers from ten to sixteen dollars per day.  Arriving at a bar about ten miles below, where white men were congregating in numbers considered sufficient for mutual protection, they took up a claim and commenced digging.  They worked here steady twenty-four days, averaging fifteen dollars per day to each man.  The greatest day's work of one man was thirty-one dollars.  These figures, it is thought, would apply to all the miners.  Our latest news from the new mines reach to the beginning of July.  At that time there were immense numbers of miners on the banks of Fraser River, waiting for the stream to fall and enable them to go to work on the bars, which are said to be fabulously rich.  Some dry diggings had also been discovered in the neighbourhood of the river; but owing to the presence of a large number of Indians, not of the most friendly disposition, the miners dared not then extend their researches far from the stream, where the bulk of the whites were congregated.  The town of Victoria, on Vancouver's Island, has sprung rapidly into importance. Great advances have been made on real estate there.  Lots, which a few months ago were sold by the Hudson's Bay Company at twelve pounds ten shillings, are now selling at over 250 pounds.  A newspaper, called the _Victoria Gazette_ has been started there; and an American steamer, _The Surprise_, is also running regularly between Victoria and Fort Hope, which is one hundred miles above the mouth of Fraser River.  In the last week of June the arrivals by steamers and vessels at the various ports of British Columbia reached the large daily average of one thousand, while those who have lately travelled through the mountains say that the principal roads in the interior present an appearance similar to the retreat of a routed army.  Stages, express waggons, and vehicles of every character, are called into requisition for"]]]
