They have been located where page    breaks occurred in the original book.  For its Index, a page    number has been placed only at the start of that section.     In the original volumes in this set, each even-numbered page    had a header consisting of the page number, the volume title,    and the chapter number.  The odd-numbered page header consisted    of the year with which the page deals, a subject phrase, and    the page number.  In this set of e-books, the odd-page year    and subject phrase have been converted to sidenotes, usually    positioned between the first two paragraphs of the even-odd    page pair.  If such positioning was not possible for a given    sidenote, it was positioned where it seemed most logical.     In the original book set, consisting of four volumes, the    master index was in Volume 4.

While this volume was passing through the press, _The English Historical Review_ published an interesting article by Prof. J. K. Laughton on the subject of Jenkins's Ear.  Professor Laughton, while lately making some researches in the Admiralty records, came on certain correspondence which appears to have escaped notice up to that time, and he regards it as incidentally confirming the story of Jenkins's Ear, \"which for certainly more than a hundred years has generally been believed to be a fable.\"  The correspondence, in my opinion, leaves the story exactly as it found it.  We only learn from it that Jenkins made a complaint about his ear to the English naval commander at Port Royal, who received the tale with a certain incredulity, but nevertheless sent formal report of it to the Admiralty, and addressed a remonstrance to the Spanish authorities.  But as Jenkins told his story to every one he met, it is not very surprising that he should have told it to the English admiral.  No one doubts that a part of one of Jenkins's ears was cut off; it will be seen in this volume that he actually at one time exhibited the severed part; but the question is, How did it come to be severed?  It might have been cut off in the ordinary course of a scuffle with the Spanish revenue-officers who tried to search his vessel.  The point of the story is that Jenkins said the ear was deliberately severed, and that the severed part was flung in his face, with the insulting injunction to take that home to his king.  Whether Jenkins told the simple truth or indulged in a little fable is a question which the recently published correspondence does not in any way help us to settle.  J. McC.

BOLINGBROKE ROUTED AGAIN.  While \"the King's friends\" and the Patriots, otherwise the Court party and the country party, were speech-making and pamphleteering, one of the greatest English pamphleteers, who was also one of the masters of English fiction, passed quietly out of existence.  On April 24, 1731, Daniel Defoe died.  It does not belong to the business of this history to narrate the life or describe the works of Defoe.  The book on which his fame will chiefly rest was published just twenty years before his death.  \"Robinson Crusoe\" first thrilled the world in 1719.  \"Robinson Crusoe\" has a place in literature as unassailable as \"Gulliver's Travels\" or as \"Don Quixote.\"  Rousseau in his \"Ã‰mile\" declares that \"Robinson Crusoe\" should for a long time be his pupil's sole library, and that it would ever after through life be to him one of his dearest intellectual companions.  At the present time, it is said, English school-boys do not read \"Robinson Crusoe.\"  There are laws of literary reaction in the tastes of school-boys as of older people.  There were days when the English public did not read Shakespeare; but it was certain that Shakespeare would come up again, and it is certain that \"Robinson Crusoe\" will come up again.  Defoe had been {2} a fierce fighter in the political literature of his time, and that was a trying time for the political gladiator.  He had, according to his own declaration, been thirteen times rich and thirteen times poor.  He had always written according to his convictions, and he had a spirit that no enemy could cow, and that no persecution could break.  He had had the most wonderful ups and downs of fortune.  He had been patronized by sovereigns and persecuted by statesmen.  He had been fined; he had been pensioned; he had been sent on political missions by one minister, and he had been clapped into Newgate by another.  He had been applauded in the streets and he had been hooted in the pillory.  Had he not written \"Robinson Crusoe\" he would still have held a high place in English literature, because of the other romances that came from his teeming brain, and because of the political tracts that made so deep and lasting an impression even in that age of famous political tracts.  But \"Robinson Crusoe\" is to his other works like Aaron's serpent, or the \"one master-passion in the breast,\" which the poet has compared with it--it \"swallows all the rest.\"  \"While all ages and descriptions of people,\" says Charles Lamb, \"hang delighted over the adventures of Robinson Crusoe, and will continue to do so, we trust, while the world lasts, how few comparatively will bear to be told that there exist other fictitious narratives by the same writer--four of them at least of no inferior interest, except what results from a less felicitous choice of situation.  'Roxana,' 'Singleton,' 'Moll Flanders,' 'Colonel Jack,' are all genuine offsprings of the same father.  They bear the veritable impress of Defoe.  Even an unpractised midwife would swear to the nose, lip, forehead, and eye of every one of them.  They are, in their way, as full of incident, and some of them every bit as romantic; only they want the uninhabited island, and the charm, that has bewitched the world, of the striking solitary situation.\"  Defoe died in poverty and solitude--\"alone with his glory.\"  It is perhaps not uncurious to note that in the same month of the same year, 1731, on {3} April 8th, \"Mrs. Elizabeth Cromwell, daughter of Richard Cromwell, the Protector, and granddaughter of Oliver Cromwell, died at her house in Bedford Row, in the eighty-second year of her age.\"  [Sidenote: 1733--Gay's request]  The death of Gay followed not long after that of Defoe.  The versatile author of \"The Beggars' Opera\" had been sinking for some years into a condition of almost unrelieved despondency.  He had had some disappointments, and he was sensitive, and took them too much to heart. He had had brilliant successes, and he had devoted friends, but a slight failure was more to him than a great success, and what he regarded as the falling-off of one friend was for the time of more account to him than the steady and faithful friendship of many men and women.  Shortly before his death he wrote: \"I desire, my dear Mr. Pope, whom I love as my own soul, if you survive me, as you certainly will, if a stone should mark the place of my grave, see these words put upon it:    \"'Life is a jest and all things show it:   I thought so once, but now I know it.'\"   Gay died in the house of his friends, the Duke and Duchess of Queensberry, on December 4, 1732.  He was buried near the tomb of Chaucer in Westminster Abbey, and a monument was set up to his memory, bearing on it Pope's famous epitaph which contains the line, \"In wit a man, simplicity a child.\"  Gay is but little known to the present generation.  Young people or old people do not read his fables any more--those fables which Rousseau thought worthy of special discussion in his great treatise on Education.  The gallant Captain Macheath swaggers and sings across the operatic stage no more, nor are tears shed now for pretty Polly Peachum's troubles.  Yet every day some one quotes from Gay, and does not know what he is quoting from.  Walpole was not magnanimous towards enemies who had still the power to do him harm.  When the enemy could hurt him no longer, Walpole felt anger no longer;"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23470"],["title","A History of the Four Georges, Volume II (#1)"],["body"," {4} but it was not his humor to spare any man who stood in his way and resisted him.  If he was not magnanimous, at least he did not affect magnanimity.  He did not pretend to regard with contempt or indifference men whom in his heart he believed to be formidable opponents.  It was a tribute to the capacity of a public man to be disliked by Walpole; a still higher tribute to be dreaded by him. One of the men whom the great minister was now beginning to hold in serious dislike and dread was Philip Dormer Stanhope, Earl of Chesterfield.  Born in 1694, Chesterfield was still what would be called in political life a young man; he was not quite forty.  He had led a varied and somewhat eccentric career.  His father, a morose man, had a coldness for him.  Young Stanhope, according to his own account, was an absolute pedant at the university.  \"When I talked my best I quoted Horace; when I aimed at being facetious I quoted Martial; and when I had a mind to be a fine gentleman I talked Ovid.  I was convinced that none but the ancients had common-sense; that the classics contained everything that was either necessary, useful, or ornamental to me; . . . and I was not even without thoughts of wearing the _toga virilis_ of the Romans, instead of the vulgar and illiberal dress of the moderns.\"  Later he had been a devotee of fashion and the gambling-table, was a man of fashion, and a gambler still.  He had travelled; had seen and studied life in many countries and cities and courts; had seen and studied many phases of life.  He professed to be dissipated and even licentious, but he had an ambitious and a daring spirit.  He well knew his own great gifts, and he knew also and frankly recognized the defects of character and temperament which were likely to neutralize their influence.  If he entered the House of Commons before the legal age, if for long he preferred pleasure to politics, he was determined to make a mark in the political world.  We shall see much of Chesterfield in the course of this history; we shall see how utterly unjust and absurd is the common censure which sets him down as a literary and political {5} fribble; we shall see that his speeches were so good that Horace Walpole declares that the finest speech he ever listened to was one of Chesterfield's; we shall see how bold he could be, and what an enlightened judgment he could bring to bear on the most difficult political questions; we shall see how near he went to genuine political greatness.  [Sidenote: 1733--Chesterfield's character]  It is not easy to form a secure opinion as to the real character of Chesterfield.  If one is to believe the accounts of some of the contemporaries who came closest to him and ought to have known him best, Chesterfield had scarcely one great or good quality of heart. His intellect no one disputed, but no one seems to have believed that he had any savor of truth or honor or virtue.  Hervey, who was fond of beating out fancies fine, is at much pains to compare and contrast Chesterfield with Scarborough and Carteret.  Thus, while Lord Scarborough was always searching after truth, loving it, and adhering to it, Chesterfield and Carteret were both of them most abominably given to fable, and both of them often, unnecessarily and consequently indiscreetly so; \"for whoever would lie usefully should lie seldom.\" Lord Scarborough had understanding, with judgment and without wit; Lord Chesterfield a speculative head, with wit and without judgment.  Lord Scarborough had honor and principle, while Chesterfield and Carteret treated all principles of honesty and integrity with such open contempt that they seemed to think the appearance of these qualities would be of as little use to them as the reality.  In short, Lord Scarborough was an honest, prudent man, capable of being a good friend, while Lord Chesterfield and Carteret were dishonest, imprudent creatures, whose principles practically told all their acquaintance, \"If you do not behave to me like knaves, I shall either distrust you as hypocrites or laugh at you as fools.\"  We have said already in this history that a reader, in getting at an estimate of the character of Lord Hervey, will have to strike a sort of balance for himself between {6} the extravagant censure flung at him by his enemies and the extravagant praise blown to him by his friends. But we find no such occasion or opportunity for striking a balance in the case of Lord Chesterfield.  All the testimony goes the one way. What do we hear of him?  That he was dwarfish; that he was hideously ugly; that he was all but deformed; that he was utterly unprincipled, vain, false, treacherous, and cruel; that he had not the slightest faith in the honor of men or the virtue of women; that he was silly enough to believe himself, with all his personal defects, actually irresistible to the most gifted and beautiful woman, and that he was mendacious enough to proclaim himself the successful lover of women who would not have given ear to his love-making for one moment.  Yet we cannot believe that Chesterfield was by any means the monster of ugliness and selfish levity whom his enemies, and some who called themselves his friends, have painted for posterity.  He was, says Hervey, short, disproportioned, thick, and clumsily made; had a broad, rough-featured, ugly face, with black teeth, and a head big enough for a Polyphemus.  \"One Ben Ashurst, who said few good things, though admired for many, told Lord Chesterfield once that he was like a stunted giant, which was a humorous idea and really apposite.\"  His portraits do not by any means bear out the common descriptions of his personal appearance.  Doubtless, Court painters then, as now, flattered or idealized, but one can scarcely believe that any painter coolly converted a hideous face into a rather handsome one and went wholly unreproved by public opinion of his time.  The truth probably is that Chesterfield's bitter, sarcastic, and unsparing tongue made him enemies, who came in the end to see nothing but deformity in his person and perfidy in his heart.  It is easy to say epigrammatically of such a man that his propensity to ridicule, in which he indulged himself with infinite humor and no distinction, and with inexhaustible spirits and no discretion, made him sought and feared, liked and not loved, by most of his acquaintance; it is easy to say that {7} no sex, no relation, no rank, no power, no profession, no friendship, no obligation, was a shield from those pointed, glittering weapons that seemed only to shine to a stander-by, but cut deep in those they touched.  But to say this is not to say all, or to paint a fair picture.  It is evident that he delighted in passing himself off on serious and heavy people as a mere trifler, paradox-maker, and cynic.  He invited them not to take him seriously, and they did take him seriously, but the wrong way.  They believed that he was serious when he professed to have no faith in anything; when he declared that he only lived for pleasure, and did not care by what means he got it; that politics were to him ridiculous, and ambition was the folly of a vulgar mind.  We now know that he had an almost boundless political ambition; and we know, too, that when put under the responsibilities that make or mar statesmen, he showed himself equal to a great task, and proved that he knew how to govern a nation which no English statesman before his time or since was able to rule from Dublin Castle.  If the policy of Chesterfield had been adopted with regard to Ireland, these countries would have been saved more than a century of trouble.  We cannot believe the statesman to have been only superficial and worthless who anticipated in his Irish policy the convictions of Burke and the ideas of Fox.  [Sidenote: 1733--Chesterfield's governing ability]  The time, however, of Chesterfield's Irish administration is yet to come.  At present he is still only a rising man; but every one admits his eloquence and his capacity.  It was he who moved in the House of Lords the \"address of condolence, congratulation, and thanks\" for the speech from the throne on the accession of George the Second.  Since then he had served the King in diplomacy.  He had been Minister to the Hague, and the Hague then was a very different place, in the diplomatist's sense, from what it is now or is ever likely to be again. He had been employed on special missions and had been concerned in the making of important treaties.  He was rewarded for his services with the Garter, and was made Lord Steward {8} of the Household.  He had distinguished himself highly as an orator in the House of Lords; had taken a place among the very foremost parliamentary orators of the day. But he chafed against Walpole's dictatorship, and soon began to show that he was determined not to endure too much of it.  He secretly did all he could to mar Walpole's excise scheme; he encouraged his three brothers to oppose the bill in the House of Commons.  He said witty and sarcastic things about the measure, which of course were duly reported to Walpole's ears.  Perhaps Chesterfield thought he stood too high to be in danger from Walpole's hand.  If he did think so he soon found out his mistake.  Walpole's hand struck him down in the most unsparing and humiliating way.  Public affront was added to political deprivation. Lord Chesterfield was actually going up the great stairs of St. James's Palace, on the day but one after the Excise Bill had been withdrawn, when he was stopped by an official and bidden to go home and bring back the white staff which was the emblem of his office, of all the chief offices of the Household, and surrender it.  Chesterfield took the demand thus ungraciously made with his usual composure and politeness. He wrote a letter to the King, which the King showed to Walpole, but did not think fit to answer.  The letter, Walpole afterwards told Lord Hervey, was \"extremely labored but not well done.\""]]]
