Then Galatea--is _she_ real too?\"  \"Tea's real enough,\" said the Professor. \"My niece, a senior at Northern, and likes dramatics. She helped me out with the thing. Why?

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence     that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed. Minor     spelling and typographical errors have been corrected without note.     THE POINT OF VIEW     \"I am too modest!\" snapped the great Haskel van Manderpootz, pacing irritably about the limited area of his private laboratory, glaring at me the while. \"That is the trouble. I undervalue my own achievements, and thereby permit petty imitators like Corveille to influence the committee and win the Morell prize.\"  \"But,\" I said soothingly, \"you've won the Morell physics award half a dozen times, professor. They can't very well give it to you every year.\"  \"Why not, since it is plain that I deserve it?\" bristled the professor. \"Understand, Dixon, that I do not regret my modesty, even though it permits conceited fools like Corveille, who have infinitely less reason than I for conceit, to win awards that mean nothing save prizes for successful bragging. Bah! To grant an award for research along such obvious lines that I neglected to mention them, thinking that even a Morell judge would appreciate their obviousness! Research on the psychon, eh! Who discovered the psychon? Who but van Manderpootz?\"  \"Wasn't that what you got last year's award for?\" I asked consolingly. \"And after all, isn't this modesty, this lack of jealousy on your part, a symbol of greatness of character?\"  \"True--true!\" said the great van Manderpootz, mollified. \"Had such an affront been committed against a lesser man than myself, he would doubtless have entered a bitter complaint against the judges. But not I. Anyway, I know from experience that it wouldn't do any good. And besides, despite his greatness, van Manderpootz is as modest and shrinking as a violet.\" At this point he paused, and his broad red face tried to look violet-like.  I suppressed a smile. I knew the eccentric genius of old, from the days when I had been Dixon Wells, undergraduate student of engineering, and had taken a course in Newer Physics (that is, in Relativity) under the famous professor. For some unguessable reason, he had taken a fancy to me, and as a result, I had been involved in several of his experiments since graduation. There was the affair of the subjunctivisor, for instance, and also that of the idealizator; in the first of these episodes I had suffered the indignity of falling in love with a girl two weeks after she was apparently dead, and in the second, the equal or greater indignity of falling in love with a girl who didn't exist, never had existed, and never would exist--in other words, with an ideal. Perhaps I'm a little susceptible to feminine charms, or rather, perhaps I used to be, for since the disaster of the idealizator, I have grimly relegated such follies to the past, much to the disgust of various 'vision entertainers, singers, dancers, and the like.  So of late I had been spending my days very seriously, trying wholeheartedly to get to the office on time just once, so that I could refer to it next time my father accused me of never getting anywhere on time. I hadn't succeeded yet, but fortunately the N. J. Wells Corporation was wealthy enough to survive even without the full-time services of Dixon Wells, or should I say even _with_ them? Anyway, I'm sure my father preferred to have me late in the morning after an evening with van Manderpootz than after one with Tips Alva or Whimsy White, or one of the numerous others of the ladies of the 'vision screen. Even in the twenty-first century, he retained a lot of old-fashioned ideas.  Van Manderpootz had ceased to remember that he was as modest and shrinking as a violet. \"It has just occurred to me,\" he announced impressively, \"that years have character much as humans have. This year, 2015, will be remembered in history as a very stupid year, in which the Morell prize was given to a nincompoop. Last year, on the other hand, was a very intelligent year, a jewel in the crown of civilization. Not only was the Morell prize given to van Manderpootz, but I announced my discrete field theory in that year, and the University unveiled Gogli's statue of me as well.\" He sighed. \"Yes, a very intelligent year! What do you think?\"  \"It depends on how you look at it,\" I responded glumly. \"I didn't enjoy it so much, what with Joanna Caldwell and Denise d'Agrion, and your infernal experiments. It's all in the point of view.\"  The professor snorted. \"Infernal experiments, eh! Point of view! Of course it's all in the point of view. Even Einstein's simple little synthesis was enough to prove that. If the whole world could adopt an intelligent and admirable point of view--that of van Manderpootz, for instance--all troubles would be over. If it were possible--\" He paused, and an expression of amazed wonder spread over his ruddy face.  \"What's the matter?\" I asked.  \"Matter? I am astonished! The astounding depths of genius awe me. I am overwhelmed with admiration at the incalculable mysteries of a great mind.\"  \"I don't get the drift.\"  \"Dixon,\" he said impressively, \"you have been privileged to look upon an example of the workings of a genius. More than that, you have planted the seed from which perhaps shall grow the towering tree of thought. Incredible as it seems, you, Dixon Wells, have given van Manderpootz an idea! It is thus that genius seizes upon the small, the unimportant, the negligible, and turns it to its own grand purposes. I stand awe-struck!\"  \"But what--?\"  \"Wait,\" said van Manderpootz, still in rapt admiration of the majesty of his own mind. \"When the tree bears fruit, you shall see it. Until then, be satisfied that you have played a part in its planting.\"         *       *       *       *       *  It was perhaps a month before I saw van Manderpootz again, but one bright spring evening his broad, rubicund face looked out of the phone-screen at me.  \"It's ready,\" he announced impressively.  \"What is?\"  The professor looked pained at the thought that I could have forgotten. \"The tree has borne fruit,\" he explained. \"If you wish to drop over to my quarters, we'll proceed to the laboratory and try it out. I do not set a time, so that it will be utterly impossible for you to be late.\"  I ignored that last dig, but had a time been set, I would doubtless have been even later than usual, for it was with some misgivings that I induced myself to go at all. I still remembered the unpleasantness of my last two experiences with the inventions of van Manderpootz. However, at last we were seated in the small laboratory, while out in the larger one the professor's technical assistant, Carter, puttered over some device, and in the far corner his secretary, the plain and unattractive Miss Fitch, transcribed lecture notes, for van Manderpootz abhorred the thought that his golden utterances might be lost to posterity. On the table between the professor and myself lay a curious device, something that looked like a cross between a pair of nose-glasses and a miner's lamp.  \"There it is,\" said van Manderpootz proudly. \"There lies my attitudinizor, which may well become an epoch-making device.\"  \"How? What does it do?\"  \"I will explain. The germ of the idea traces back to that remark of yours about everything depending on the point of view. A very obvious statement, of course, but genius seizes on the obvious and draws from it the obscure. Thus the thoughts of even the simplest mind can suggest to the man of genius his sublime conceptions, as is evident from the fact that I got this idea from you.\"  \"What idea?\"  \"Be patient. There is much you must understand first. You must realize just how true is the statement that everything depends on the point of view. Einstein proved that motion, space, and time depend on the particular point of view of the observer, or as he expressed it, on the scale of reference used. I go farther than that, infinitely farther. I propound the theory that the observer _is_ the point of view. I go even beyond that, I maintain that the world itself is merely the point of view!\"  \"Huh?\"  \"Look here,\" proceeded van Manderpootz. \"It is obvious that the world I see is entirely different from the one in which you live. It is equally obvious that a strictly religious man occupies a different world than that of a materialist. The fortunate man lives in a happy world; the unfortunate man sees a world of misery. One man is happy with little, another is miserable with much. Each sees the world from his own point of view, which is the same as saying that each lives in his own world. Therefore there are as many worlds as there are points of view.\"  \"But,\" I objected, \"that theory is to disregard reality. Out of all the different points of view, there must be one that is right, and all the rest are wrong.\"  \"One would think so,\" agreed the professor. \"One would think that between the point of view of you, for instance, as contrasted with that of, say van Manderpootz, there would be small doubt as to which was correct. However, early in the twentieth century, Heisenberg enunciated his Principle of Uncertainty, which proved beyond argument that a completely accurate scientific picture of the world is quite impossible, that the law of cause and effect is merely a phase of the law of chance, that no infallible predictions can ever be made, and that what science used to call natural laws are really only descriptions of the way in which the human mind perceives nature. In other words, the character of the world depends entirely on the mind observing it, or, to return to my earlier statement, the point of view.\"  \"But no one can ever really understand another person's point of view,\" I said. \"It isn't fair to undermine the whole basis of science because you can't be sure that the color we both call red wouldn't look green to you if you could see it through my eyes.\"  \"Ah!\" said van Manderpootz triumphantly. \"So"]]]
