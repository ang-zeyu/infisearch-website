The other side was left open to let the light in and the smoke out.  Furniture they had none.  A little grass on the floor served for chairs, tables, and beds.  The only articles of manufacture to be seen among the people were a few rude baskets, and a sort of sack in which they carried the shell-fish which formed part of their food.  They had also bows and arrows, which were rather neatly made--the arrows with flint heads cleverly fitted on.  The colour of those savages resembled iron-rust mixed with oil; their hair was long and black.  The men were large but clumsy fellows, varying from five feet eight to five feet ten.  The women were much smaller, few being above five feet.  Their costume consisted of skins of wild animals.  The women tied their fur cloaks about the waists with a thong of leather.  One would imagine that among people so poor and miserably off there was not temptation to vain show, nevertheless they were fond of making themselves \"look fine\"!  They painted their faces with various colours; white round the eyes, with stripes of red and black across the cheeks, but scarcely any two of them were painted alike.  Both men and women wore bracelets of beads made of shells and bones, and, of course, they were greatly delighted with the beads which their visitors presented to them.  Their language was harsh in sound; they seemed to have no form of government, and no sort of religion.  Altogether they appeared to be the most destitute, as well as the most stupid, of all human beings.    CHAPTER FOUR.  EXPLAINS HOW CORAL ISLANDS ARE MADE.  Soon after this adventurous visit to the land of Tierra del Fuego, the _Endeavour_ doubled Cape Horn--and entered the waters of the great Pacific Ocean; and now Cook began to traverse those unknown seas in which his fame as a discoverer was destined to be made.  He sailed over this ocean for several weeks, however, before discovering any land.  It was on Tuesday morning, the 10th of April, that he fell in with the first of the coral islands.  Mr Banks's servant, Peter Briscoe, was the first to see it, bearing south, at the distance of about ten or twelve miles, and the ship was immediately run in that direction.  It was found to be an island of an oval form, with a lake, or lagoon, in the middle of it.  In fact, it was like an irregularly-formed ring of land, with the ocean outside and a lake inside.  Coral islands vary a good deal in form and size, but the above description is true of many of them.  To this island the crew of the _Endeavour_ now drew near with looks of eager interest, as may well be believed, for an unknown land necessarily excites feelings of lively curiosity in the breasts of those who discover it.  It was found to be very narrow in some places, and very low, almost on a level with the sea.  Some parts were bare and rocky; others were covered with vegetation, while in several places there were clumps of trees-- chiefly cocoa-nut palms.  When the ship came within a mile of the breakers, the lead was hove, but no bottom was found with 130 fathoms of line!  This was an extraordinary depth so near shore, but they afterwards found that most of the coral islands have great depth of water round them, close outside the breakers.  They now observed that the island was inhabited, and with the glass counted four-and-twenty natives walking on the beach.  These all seemed to be quite naked.  They were of a brown colour, and had long black hair.  They carried spears of great length in their hands, also a smaller weapon, which appeared to be either a club or a paddle.  The huts of these people were under the shade of some palm-trees, and Captain Cook says that to him and his men, who had seen nothing but water and sky for many long months, except the dreary shores of Tierra del Fuego, these groves appeared like paradise.  They called this Lagoon Island.  As night came on soon after they reached it, however, they were compelled to sail away without attempting to land.  Not long afterwards another island was discovered.  This one was in the shape of a bow, with the calm lake, or lagoon, lying between the cord and the bow.  It was also inhabited, but Cook did not think it worth his while to land.  The natives here had canoes, and the voyagers waited to give them an opportunity of putting off to the ship, but they seemed afraid to do so.  Now, good reader, you must know that these coral islands of the Pacific are not composed of ordinary rocks, like most other islands of the world, but are literally manufactured or built by millions of extremely small insects which merit particular notice.  Let us examine this process of island-making which is carried on very extensively by the artisans of the great South-Sea Factory!  The coral insect is a small creature of the sea which has been gifted with the power of \"secreting\" or depositing a lime-like substance, with which it builds to itself a little cell or habitation.  It fastens this house to a rock at the bottom of the sea.  Like many other creatures the coral insect is sociable; it is fond of company, and is never found working except in connection with millions of its friends.  Of all the creatures of earth it shows perhaps the best example of what mighty works can be accomplished by _union_.  One man can do comparatively little, but hundreds of men, united in their work, can achieve wonders, as every one knows.  They can erect palaces and cathedrals towering to the skies; they can cover hundred of miles of ground with cities, and connect continents with telegraphs, but, with all their union, all their wisdom, and all their power, men cannot build islands--yet this is done by the coral insect; a thing without hand or brain, a creature with little more than a body and a stomach.  It is not much bigger than a pin-head, yet hundreds of the lovely, fertile islands of the Pacific Ocean are formed by this busy animalcule.  Many of those islands would never have been there but for the coral insect!  When corallines (as they are called) set about building an island, they lay the foundation on the top of a submarine mountain.  The ordinary islands of the sea are neither more nor less than the tops of those mountains which rise from the bottom of the sea and project above the surface.  Some of these sea-mountains rise high above the surface and form large islands; some only peep, so to speak, out of the waves, thus forming small islands; others again do not rise to the surface at all-- their highest peaks being several feet below the level of the ocean.  It is on these water-covered mountain-tops that the coral insects lay the foundations of their islands.  As few mountain-peaks are level, however, whether above or below water, the insect finds it more convenient to form a ring round the sides of the mountain-top than to build on the exact top itself.  Then they set to work with the busy industry of bees. Their talents are few; apparently they have received only one, but they turn that one to good account.  They fulfil the work for which they were created.  No creature can do more!  They begin to build, and the work advances rapidly, for they are active little masons.  The ring round the mountain-top soon begins to shoot upwards and extend outwards.  As the labourers continue their work their families increase.  It is a thriving and a united community.  There are neither wars nor disputes--no quarrelling, no mis-spent time, no misapplied talents.  There is unity of action and design, hence the work advances quickly, steadily, and well.  In process of time the coral ring becomes a solid wall, which gradually rises above the highest peak of the submarine mountain, and at length approaches the surface of the sea. When it reaches this point the work is done.  The coral insect can only work under water.  When its delicate head rises above the waves it ceases to build, and, having done its duty, it dies.  Those which reach the surface first, die first.  The others that are still below water work on, widening and strengthening the wall until they too reach the fatal surface, peep for one moment as it were on the upper world and then perish.  Thus the active builders go on adding to the width of the structure, and dying by successive relays; working with their little might during their brief existence, and knowing nothing of the great end which is to result from their modest busy lives.  With the death of the coral insects the foundation-stone of the island is laid, in the form of a ring just peeping out of the ocean. Thenceforth other creatures continue the work.  The waves lash and beat upon the uppermost coral cells and break them up into fine white sand. Currents of ocean throw upon this beach pieces of sea-weed and drifting marine substances of various kinds.  The winds convey the lighter seeds of land plants to it, and sea-birds that alight upon it to rest do the same thing.  Thus, little by little, things accumulate on the top of the coral ring until the summit rises above the reach and fury of the waves. No sooner is this accomplished than the genial sun of those regions calls the seeds into life.  A few blades of green shoot up.  These are the little tokens of life that give promise of the luxuriance yet to come.  Soon the island ring is clothed with rich and beautiful vegetation, cocoa-nut palms begin to sprout and sea-fowl to find shelter where, in former days, the waves of the salt sea alone were to be found. In process of time the roving South-Sea islanders discover this little gem of ocean, and take up their abode on it; and when such a man as Cook sails past it, he sees, perchance, the naked savage on the beach gazing in wonder at his \"big canoe,\" and the little children swimming like ducks in the calm waters of the lagoon or gambolling like porpoises among the huge breakers outside that roll like driven snow upon the strand.  During their formation, these islands are fraught with danger to ships, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23267"],["title","The Cannibal Islands: Captain Cook's Adventure in the South Seas (#4)"],["body","sometimes, in parts of the ocean where charts show deep water, the sailor finds an unexpected coral reef, and, before he is aware, the good ship runs on this living wall and becomes a wreck.  Many a noble vessel goes to sea well appointed and with a good brave crew, but never more returns;--who knows how many such have, when all on board thought themselves secure, been dashed to pieces suddenly, and lost upon the coral reefs of the Pacific?  These circular islets of coral never rise more than a few feet above the surface of the sea, but there are many other islands in the South Seas-- some of which have been thrown up by the action of volcanoes, and are wild, rugged, mountainous, and of every conceivable shape and size.  The busy corallines before mentioned are so numerous in the South Seas that they build their coral walls everywhere.  As they have an objection apparently to commence building in shallow water, they are obliged to keep off the shore a distance of a mile or more, so that when they reach the surface they enclose a belt of water of that width, which is guarded by the reef from the violence of the waves, and forms a splendid natural harbour.  Almost every South-Sea island has its coral reef round it, and its harbour of still water between the reef and the shore.  It would seem as if the beneficent Creator had purposely formed those harbours for man's convenience, because narrow openings are found in all the reefs, without which, of course, the sheltered waters within could not have been entered.  These openings are usually found to occur opposite valleys where the streams from the mountains enter the sea.  It is therefore supposed that fresh water kills the coral insects at these places, thus preventing the reef from forming an unbroken circle.  Low islets are usually formed on each side of the openings on which a few cocoa-nut trees grow; so that the mariner is thus furnished with a natural beacon by which to guide his vessel clear of the reef safely into the harbour.  One of the most interesting of the larger islands of the Pacific is Otaheite (now spelt and pronounced Tahiti), at which Captain Cook arrived on the 4th of April 1769.  It had been discovered, however, nearly two years before the date of his visit--as the next chapter will show.    CHAPTER FIVE.  DISCOVERY BY CAPTAIN WALLIS OF OTAHEITE OR TAHITI.  The beautiful island of Tahiti was discovered by Captain Wallis in the year 1767.  It was on a bright day in June when he first saw it from the deck, but when his vessel (the _Dolphin_) came close to it, a thick mist descended like a veil and shut it out from view of the impatient mariners, who were compelled to lie to until the mist should clear away.  At length it rolled off, and disclosed one of the most lovely and delightful scenes that could be imagined.  The _Dolphin_ being the first ship that ever touched at Tahiti, the natives, as we may well imagine, were filled with amazement at its vast size and curious shape.  No sooner did the ship draw near than she was surrounded by hundreds of canoes, containing altogether nearly a thousand naked savages.  At first the poor creatures were afraid to draw near.  They sat in their little barks gazing at the \"big canoe\" in silent wonder or talking to each other about her in low eager tones, but never for a moment taking their eyes off this great sight!  At last, after consulting together, they began to paddle slowly round the ship, and make signs of peace and friendship, which those on board were not slow to return, endeavouring to induce some of them to come on deck.  This they were naturally afraid to do, but at length one fellow took heart and began by making a speech, which lasted for full fifteen minutes.  As none of the sailors understood a word of it, they were not much enlightened; but the savage, who held a branch of the plantain-tree in his hand during his oration, concluded by casting this branch into the sea.  This was meant as a sign of friendship, for soon after, a number of similar branches were thrown on the ship's deck, and then a few of the islanders ventured on board.  There was \"much talk,\" however, on the part of the savages, before they began to feel at ease.  Trinkets of various kinds were now offered to them, and they gazed around them with great interest, gradually losing their fears under the kindness of Captain Wallis and his companions. This happy state of things, however, was suddenly interrupted by a goat belonging to the ship, which, not liking the appearance of the strangers, attacked one of them unceremoniously, and butted at him with its head.  Turning quickly round, the savage was filled with terror on beholding a creature, the like of which he had never seen before, reared on its hind legs, and preparing to repeat the blow.  Without a moment's hesitation he rushed in consternation to the ship's side, and plunged into the sea, whither he was followed by all his countrymen in the twinkling of an eye.  A storm of musket bullets could not have cleared the deck more quickly than did the attack of that pugnacious goat!  In a short time they recovered from their terrors, the ill-behaved goat was removed, and some of the natives were again induced to return on board, where they were treated with the utmost kindness, and presented with such trifling gifts as beads and nails, etcetera, much to their delight.  Notwithstanding this, however, the visit terminated inharmoniously in consequence of one of the natives snatching a gold-laced hat from an officer's head, and jumping with it into the sea!  After this Wallis stood in-shore, intending to anchor, and sent his boats still closer to the land to take soundings.  Here they were immediately surrounded by a great number of canoes, and the captain, suspecting the natives of hostile intentions, fired a nine-pounder over their heads.  They were much startled by the unknown and terrible sound, but, seeing that no result followed, they proceeded to attack the boats, sending showers of stones into them, and wounding some of the men.  It now became necessary to act in earnest, so a musket-shot was discharged at the savage who began the attack.  The ball pierced his shoulder, whereupon the whole host paddled to the shore in great terror and confusion.  Notwithstanding this, the islanders soon returned to the ship with their boughs of peace: a speech was made by one of them.  A few trinkets were given by the Europeans, and friendship was again restored; but next morning, when the boats were in-shore searching for fresh water, a second attack was made upon them.  Three large canoes ran against the ship's cutter, and stove in some of her upper planks.  The natives were about to leap on board when a volley was fired into them, and two of their number fell into the sea.  On seeing this they instantly retired, and the wounded men were dragged into the canoes.  Never having seen the effects of fire-arms before, the astonished savages apparently could not understand what was wrong with their comrades.  They set them on their feet, but finding they could not stand, they tried to make them sit upright.  One of them being only wounded, was able to remain in this position, but the other was dead, so they had to lay him in the bottom of their canoe.  Once again they made peaceful signs, and Wallis, who was most anxious to avoid bloodshed, met them more than half-way.  Traffic was speedily opened, and a considerable quantity of fruit, fowls, and hogs was obtained in exchange for scissors, knives, beads, and small trinkets of little value.  But this did not last long.  Warlike preparations were renewed by the natives, and many of their canoes were seen to be filled with large pebbles.  At last an attack was made on the ship itself, and a regular battle was fought.  This happened early in the morning when the sailors were engaged trafficking with the people in the canoes that contained provisions. Captain Wallis observed, with some anxiety, that, besides those provision canoes, many others of large size and filled with stones were gradually crowding round the ship; he therefore kept part of the crew armed, and loaded his guns.  More canoes were putting off from shore and crowding round until there were about three hundred of them, with upwards of two thousand men, some of whom sang a gruff sort of war-song, while others blew into a shell as if it were a trumpet, and some played on an instrument resembling a flute.  In the midst of these discordant noises one canoe, larger than the others, and with a canopy over it, pushed alongside, and a naked warrior handed up a bunch of red and yellow feathers.  This was, of course, supposed to be a sign of peace, but such was not the case.  Immediately afterwards the canoe pushed off and the leader threw into the air the branch of a cocoa-nut tree.  This was the signal.  A general shout burst from the savages; the canoes made for the ship, and showers of stones were thrown on board.  Many of these stones were fully two pounds weight, and as they were thrown with great force, some of the sailors were severely wounded.  The crew of the _Dolphin_ rushed to quarters.  The watch on deck instantly opened a fire of musketry on those nearest the ship, and two of the quarter-deck swivel guns, which happened to be loaded with small-shot, were also discharged.  This warm and vigorous reception checked the attack for a few minutes; but the courage of the savages was aroused.  They quickly renewed the assault, coming on in all directions, and receiving constant reinforcements from the shore.  But now the great guns of the ship were brought into play; the thunder of artillery echoed, for the first time, from the mountain-sides of Tahiti; and, as the heavy balls tore up the sea and crashed upon the shore, the terrified natives in the canoes nearest the ship took to flight.  Seeing this, the Captain at once ordered the fire to cease, being anxious to do as little"]]]
