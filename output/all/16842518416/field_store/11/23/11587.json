He went swimming, warm evenings, with the boys, and ran races, jumped and wrestled at noon-times, which was supposed to be given up to eating and resting. He was \"the life\" of the husking-bee and barn raising, and was always present, often as a judge because of his humor, fairness and tact, at horse races. He engaged heartily in every kind of \"manly sport\" which did not entail unnecessary suffering upon helpless animals.  Coon hunting, however, was an exception. The coon was a pest and a plague to the farmer, so it should be got rid of. He once told the following story:   THE LITTLE YELLOW \"COON DOG\"  \"My father had a little yellow house dog which invariably gave the alarm if we boys undertook to slip away unobserved after night had set in--as we sometimes did--to go coon hunting. One night my brother, John Johnston, and I, with the usual complement of boys required for a successful coon hunt, took the insignificant little cur with us.  \"We located the coveted coon, killed him, and then in a sporting vein, sewed the coon skin on the little dog.  \"It struggled vigorously during the operation of sewing on, and when released made a bee-line for home. Some larger dogs on the way, scenting coon, tracked the little animal home and apparently mistaking him for a real coon, speedily demolished him. The next morning, father found, lying in his yard, the lifeless remains of yellow 'Joe,' with strong circumstantial evidence, in the form of fragments of coon skin, against us.  \"Father was much incensed at his death, but as John and I, scantily protected from the morning wind, stood shivering in the doorway, we felt assured that little yellow Joe would never again be able to sound the alarm of another coon hunt.\"   THE \"CHIN FLY\" AS AN INCENTIVE TO WORK  While he was President, Mr. Lincoln told Henry J. Raymond, the founder of the New York _Times_, the following story of an experience he had about this time, while working with his stepbrother in a cornfield:  \"Raymond,\" said he, \"you were brought up on a farm, were you not? Then you know what a 'chin fly' is. My brother and I were plowing corn once, I driving the horse and he holding the plow. The horse was lazy, but on one occasion he rushed across the field so that I, with my long legs, could scarcely keep pace with him. On reaching the end of the furrow I found an enormous chin fly fastened upon the horse and I knocked it off. My brother asked me what I did that for. I told him I didn't want the old horse bitten in that way.  \"'Why,' said my brother,'that's all that made him go.'\"  \"Now if Mr. Chase (the Secretary of the Treasury) has a presidential 'chin fly' biting him, I'm not going to knock it off, if it will only make his department go.\"   \"OLD BLUE NOSE'S\" HIRED MAN  It seemed to be the \"irony of fate\" that Abe should have to work for \"Old Blue Nose\" as a farm hand. But the lad liked Mrs. Crawford, and Lincoln's sister Nancy lived there, at the same time, as maid-of-all-work. Another attraction, the Crawford family was rich, in Abe's eyes, in possessing several books, which he was glad of the chance to read.  Mrs. Crawford told many things about young Lincoln that might otherwise have been lost. She said \"Abe was very polite, in his awkward way, taking off his hat to me and bowing. He was a sensitive lad, never coming where he was not wanted. He was tender and kind--like his sister.  \"He liked to hang around and gossip and joke with the women. After he had wasted too much time this way, he would exclaim:  \"'Well, this won't buy the child a coat,' and the long-legged hired boy would stride away and catch up with the others.\"  One day when he was asked to kill a hog, Abe answered promptly that he had never done that, \"but if you'll risk the hog, I'll risk myself!\"  Mrs. Crawford told also about \"going to meeting\" in those primitive days:  \"At that time we thought it nothing to go eight or ten miles. The ladies did not stop for the want of a shawl or riding dress, or horses. In the winter time they would put on their husbands' old overcoats, wrap up their little ones, and take two or three of them on their beasts, while their husbands would walk.  \"In winter time they would hold church in some of the neighbors' houses. At such times they were always treated with the utmost kindness; a basket of apples, or turnips--apples were scarce in those days--was set out. Sometimes potatoes were used for a 'treat.' In old Mr. Linkhorn's (Lincoln's) house a plate of potatoes, washed and pared nicely, was handed around.\"   FEATS OF STRENGTH  Meanwhile the boy was growing to tall manhood, both in body and in mind. The neighbors, who failed to mark his mental growth, were greatly impressed with his physical strength. The Richardson family, with whom Abe seemed to have lived as hired man, used to tell marvelous tales of his prowess, some of which may have grown somewhat in the telling. Mr. Richardson declared that the young man could carry as heavy a load as \"three ordinary men.\" He saw Abe pick up and walk away with \"a chicken house, made up of poles pinned together, and covered, that weighed at least six hundred if not much more.\"  When the Richardsons were building their corn-crib, Abe saw three or four men getting ready to carry several huge posts or timbers on \"sticks\" between them. Watching his chance, he coolly stepped in, shouldered all the timbers at once and walked off alone with them, carrying them to the place desired. He performed these feats off-hand, smiling down in undisguised pleasure as the men around him expressed their amazement. It seemed to appeal to his sense of humor as well as his desire to help others out of their difficulties.  Another neighbor, \"old Mr. Wood,\" said of Abe: \"He could strike, with a maul, a heavier blow than any other man. He could sink an ax deeper into wood than any man I ever saw.\"  Dennis Hanks used to tell that if you heard Abe working in the woods alone, felling trees, you would think three men, at least, were at work there--the trees came crashing down so fast.  On one occasion after he had been threshing wheat for Mr. Turnham, the farmer-constable whose \"Revised Statutes of Indiana\" Abe had devoured, Lincoln was walking back, late at night from Gentryville, where he and a number of cronies had spent the evening. As the youths were picking their way along the frozen road, they saw a dark object on the ground by the roadside. They found it to be an old sot they knew too well lying there, dead drunk. Lincoln stopped, and the rest, knowing the tenderness of his heart, exclaimed:  \"Aw, let him alone, Abe. 'Twon't do him no good. He's made his bed, let him lay in it!\"  The rest laughed--for the \"bed\" was freezing mud. But Abe could see no humor in the situation. The man might be run over, or freeze to death. To abandon any human being in such a plight seemed too monstrous to him. The other young men hurried on in the cold, shrugging their shoulders and shaking their heads--\"Poor Abe!--he's a hopeless case,\" and left Lincoln to do the work of a Good Samaritan alone. He had no beast on which to carry the dead weight of the drunken man, whom he vainly tried, again and again, to arouse to a sense of the predicament he was in. At last the young man took up the apparently lifeless body of the mud-covered man in his strong arms, and carried him a quarter of a mile to a deserted cabin, where he made up a fire and warmed and nursed the old drunkard the rest of that night. Then Abe gave him \"a good talking to,\" and the unfortunate man is said to have been so deeply impressed by the young man's kindness that he heeded the temperance lecture and never again risked his life as he had done that night. When the old man told John Hanks of Abe's Herculean effort to save him, he added:  \"It was mighty clever in Abe Lincoln to tote me to a warm fire that cold night.\"   IN JONES' STORE  While Abe was working for the farmers round about his father's farm he spent many of his evenings in Jones' grocery \"talking politics\" and other things with the men, who also gathered there. Mr. Jones took a Louisville paper, which young Lincoln read eagerly. Slavery was a live political topic then, and Abe soon acquired quite a reputation as a stump orator.  As he read the \"Indiana Statutes\" he was supposed to \"know more law than the constable.\" In fact, his taste for the law was so pronounced at that early age that he went, sometimes, fifteen miles to Boonville, as a spectator in the county court. Once he heard a lawyer of ability, named Breckinridge, defend an accused murderer there. It was a great plea; the tall country boy knew it and, pushing through the crowd, reached out his long, coatless arm to congratulate the lawyer, who looked at the awkward youth in amazement and passed on without acknowledging Abe's compliment. The two men met again in Washington, more than thirty years later, under very different circumstances.  But there were things other than politics discussed at the country store, and Abe Lincoln often raised a laugh at the expense of some braggart or bully. There was \"Uncle Jimmy\" Larkins, who posed as the hero of his own stories. In acknowledgment of Abe's authority as a judge of horse flesh, \"Uncle Jimmy\" was boasting of his horse's superiority in a recent fox chase. But young Lincoln seemed to pay no heed. Larkins repeated:  \"Abe, I've got the best horse in the world; he won the race and never drew a long breath.\"  Young Lincoln still appeared not to be paying attention. \"Uncle Jimmy\" persisted. He was bound to make Abe hear. He reiterated:  \"I say, Abe, I have got the best horse in the world; after all that running he never drew a long breath.\"  \"Well, Larkins,\" drawled young Lincoln, \"why don't you tell us how many _short_ breaths he drew.\" The laugh was on the boastful and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22938"],["title","The Camp Fire Girls in the Outside World (#0)"],["body","Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustrations.

And although the hallway was in semi-darkness, the candles had not yet been lighted.  It was a cold November afternoon and the great house was chill and silent.  Entering the drawing room, she placed the candles upon the mantelpiece. Her breath was like a small gray cloud before her; and her dress, too, was the color of the mist and soft and clinging.  \"Work, health and love,\" she murmured quietly, striking a match and watching the candles flicker and flare until finally they burned with a steady glow.  \"If one has these three things in life as I have, what else is worth worrying over?\"  Then the sigh that came in answer to her own question almost extinguished the candle flames.  \"There are bills and boarders of course--too many of the first and at present none of the second,\" she added with a kind of whimsical smile. \"But, oh dear, what a trying Thanksgiving day this has been, when even the Camp Fire ideals won't comfort me!  Dick 'way off in Germany, Polly and Esther studying in New York and me face to face with my failure to save the old house.  It is not worth while pretending; the house must be sold and mother and I shall have to find some other place to live. In the morning I will go and tell Judge Maynard that I give up.\"  Sadly Betty Ashton glanced about the familiar room.  The portraits of her New England ancestors appeared to gaze coldly and reproachfully down upon her.  They had not been of the stuff of which failures are made.  Her grand piano was closed and dusty, the window blinds were partly pulled down, and although a fire was laid in the grate, it was not burning.  Dust, cold and an unaccustomed atmosphere of neglect enveloped everything.  With a lifting of her head and a tightening of her lips that gave her face a new expression, the girl suddenly pulled open a table drawer and began fiercely to polish the top of the piano while she talked.  \"There is no reason why I should allow this place to look so dismal just because things have gone wrong with my efforts to keep boarders and continue my work at school.  As no one is coming to see me I can't afford a fire, but I'll open the piano and place Esther's song, 'The Soul's Desire,' on the music rack, just as though she were at home to sing it for me.  Dick's dull old books shall lie here on the table where he used to leave them, near this red rose that John Everett brought me this morning.  Somehow the rose makes me think of Polly.  It is so radiant.  How curious that certain persons suggest certain colors!  Now Polly is often pale as a ghost, and yet red always makes me recall her.\"  A few moments afterwards and Betty moved toward the front window and stood there staring out into the street, too deep in thought to be actually conscious of what she was doing.  She had changed in the past six months of struggle with poverty and work beyond her strength.  There were shadows under her gray eyes and worried lines about the corners of her mouth.  Instead of being slim as formerly, she was undeniably so thin that even the folds of her delicate crepe dress could not wholly disguise it.  It was not that Mrs. Ashton and Betty had spent this lonely day in their old home, because their former friends had neglected them. Indeed, they had had invitations to Thanksgiving dinners from half a dozen sources.  But Mrs. Ashton had not been well in several months and was today too ill for her daughter to leave her.  The two women were now entirely alone in the house.  One by one their boarders had deserted them, and the previous week they had even felt compelled to give up the old cook, who had been in the service of the Ashton family for twenty years.  At first Betty saw nothing to attract her attention in the street outside--not a single passer-by.  It was odd how quiet and cold the world seemed with her mother asleep in one of the far-away rooms upstairs and other persons evidently too much interested in indoor amusements to care for wandering through the dull town.  In another instant, however, the girl's attention was caught by the appearance of a figure which seemed to spring up suddenly out of nowhere and to stand gazing intently toward the Ashton house.  It was almost dark, and yet Betty could distinguish a young man, roughly dressed, wearing no overcoat, with his coat collar turned up and a cap pulled down over his eyes.  Without being frightened, she was curious and interested.  Why should the man behave so queerly?  He now walked past the house and then turned and came back, not once but several times.  Evidently he had not observed the girl at the window.  At last however he gave up, and Betty believed that she saw him disappear behind the closed cottage of the O'Neills.  No longer entertained, she prepared to leave the drawing room.  It was too chilly to remain there any longer.  Moreover, studying the familiar objects she had loved so long only made the thought of their surrender more painful.  Betty once more faced her three candles.    \"Be strong as the fagots are sturdy;   Be pure in your deepest desire;   Be true to the truth that is in you;\"   \"And--follow the law of the fire,\" she repeated with a catch in her breath.  Then with greater strength and resolution in her face she blew out two of the candles, and picking up the third, started on her way upstairs.  The next moment there came a quick, muffled ring at the front door bell.  The girl hesitated; yet there was no one else in the house to answer the bell, and only a friend, she thought, could come at this hour. Shading her light from the wind with one hand she pulled open the door with the other, already smiling with pleasure at the idea of thus ending her loneliness.  Close against the door she discovered the young man whom she had seen only a few moments before in the street.  He did not speak nor move immediately.  \"What do you wish?\" Betty demanded a trifle impatiently.  The fellow had both fists rammed deep into his pockets and had not the courtesy to remove his hat.  With a slight sense of uneasiness, Betty thought of closing the door.  The unexpected visitor kept edging closer toward her and was apparently fumbling for something in his coat.  \"Please tell me what it is you want at once,\" the girl repeated almost angrily.  \"This is Mrs. Ashton's house if you are looking for it.  My mother and I are entirely alone.\"  Having made this speech Betty instantly recognized its stupidity and regretted it.  However the young man had at last succeeded in removing a small oblong package from his pocket, which he silently thrust toward her.  On the wrapper in big letters, such as a child might have written, the girl was able to decipher her own name.  But while she was puzzling over it, and before she could thank the messenger, he had hurried off.  Betty set her candle down on the lowest of the front steps and kneeling before it rapidly undid her parcel.  Inside the paper she discovered a crudely hand-carved wooden box, and opening the lid, a blank sheet of folded white paper.  She shook the paper.  Had some one sent her a Thanksgiving present or was she being made the victim of a joke?  But from between the blank sheets something slowly fluttered to her feet.  And picking it up with a little cry of surprise Betty saw a crisp new ten dollar bill.  Immediately her cheeks turned scarlet and her eyes filled with indignant tears.  Only by an effort of will could the tears be kept from falling.  Did any one of her friends consider her so poverty-stricken that it was necessary to send her money in this anonymous fashion?  Scarcely waiting to think, Betty rushed out of the house and down the old paved brick walk out into the street.  For there might be a bare chance that the messenger was not yet out of sight.  Sure enough, there he was still loitering on the corner about half a block away. Bareheaded, and in her thin dress, with the money in her hand, the girl ran forward.  And actually as she reached the young man, she caught him fast by the sleeve.  \"Please, you must tell me who sent me this money or else take it back at once and say that though I am very much obliged I cannot receive a gift delivered in this secret fashion.\"  The two young people were standing near an electric light so that they could now see each other plainly.  Betty observed a"]]]
