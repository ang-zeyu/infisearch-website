Of course, the shipments of merchandise from San Francisco and other ports are very large, to keep pace with this almost instantaneous emigration of thousands to a region totally unsupplied with the commodities necessary for their use and sustenance.  Up to the present no outbreak or disturbance has occurred, and a certain degree of order has already been established in the mining region, through the judicious measures adopted by the governor. Justices of the peace and other officials have been appointed, and a system protective of the territorial interests organised.  Licences, on the principle of those granted in Australia, are issued; the price, five dollars per month, to be exacted from every miner.  There was a good deal of talk, as to the right or propriety of levying this tax when it was first proposed, and some of the Francisco papers were load in their denunciations; others took a calmer view.  It is satisfactory to add that little difficulty has so far been experienced on this head.  As a body, the miners are reported to be a steady set of men, well conducted, and respectful of the law.    CHAPTER TWO.  CLIMATE, PRODUCTIONS, AND SOIL.  Next to the extent and richness of the gold mines, the most important inquiry is as to the character of the climate and soil.  And in this respect the Fraser River settlement does not lose any of its attractions, for, though seven hundred miles north of San Francisco, it is still one or two degrees south of the latitude of London, and apparently with a climate of a mildness equal to that of the southern shores of England, being free from all extremes, both of heat and cold. One hundred and fifty miles back from the Pacific, indeed, there lies a range of mountains reaching up to the regions of perpetual snow.  But between that and the coast the average temperature is fifty-four degrees for the year round.  Snow seldom lies more than three days.  Fruit trees blossom early in April, and salad goes to head by the middle of May on Vancouver's Island.  In parts of this region wheat yields twenty to thirty bushels to the acre.  Apples, pears, pease, and grains of all kinds do well.  The trees are of gigantic growth.  Iron and copper abound, as does also coal in Vancouver's Island, so that altogether it bids fair to realise in a short time the description applied to it by the colonial secretary (Sir E.B. Lytton), of \"a magnificent abode for the human race.\"  When introducing the \"Government of New Caledonia bill,\" on 9th July, the Colonial Secretary said in his place in the House of Commons:--\"The Thompson River district is described as one of the finest countries in the British dominions, with a climate far superior to that of countries in the same latitude on the other side of the mountains.  Mr Cooper, who gave valuable evidence before our committee on this district, with which he is thoroughly acquainted, recently addressed to me a letter, in which he states that `its fisheries are most valuable, its timber the finest in the world for marine purposes; it abounds with bituminous coal, well fitted for the generation of steam; from Thompson River and Colville districts to the Rocky Mountains, and from the 49th parallel some 350 miles north, a more beautiful country does not exist.  It is in every way suitable for colonisation.'  Therefore, apart from the gold fields, this country affords every promise of a flourishing and important colony.\"  The _Times_ special correspondent, in a letter from Vancouver's Island, published on 10th August, says, \"Productive fisheries, prolific whaling waters, extensive coalfields, a country well timbered in some parts, susceptible of every agricultural improvement in ethers, with rich gold fields on the very borders--these are some of the many advantages enjoyed by the colony of Vancouver's Island and its fortunate possessors.  When I add that the island boasts a climate of great salubrity, with a winter temperature resembling that of England, and a summer little inferior to that of Paris, I need say no more, lest my picture be suspected of sharing too deeply of _couleur de rose_.\"  Of the southern part of this district Lieutenant Wilkes, who commanded the late exploring expedition under the United States government, says, \"Few portions of the globe are so rich in soil, so diversified in surface, or so capable of being rendered the happy homes of an industrious and civilised community.  For beauty of scenery and salubrity of climate it cannot be surpassed.  It is peculiarly adapted for an agricultural and pastoral people, and no portion of the world beyond the tropics can be found that will yield so readily with moderate labour to the wants of man.\"  Perhaps the fullest account of the country yet given is that contained in \"The Narrative of a Residence of Six Years on the Western Slopes of the Rocky Mountains,\" by Ross Cox, one of the earliest explorers of British North America.  He says, \"The district of New Caledonia extends from 51 degrees 30 minutes north latitude to about 56 degrees.  Its extreme western boundary is 124 degrees 10 minutes.  Its principal trading post is called Alexandria, after the celebrated traveller Sir Alexander Mackenzie.  It is built on the banks of Fraser River, in about latitude 53 degrees north.  The country in its immediate vicinity presents a beautiful and picturesque appearance.  The banks of the river are rather low; but a little distance inland some rising grounds are visible, partially diversified by groves of fir and poplar.  This country is full of small lakes, rivers, and marshes.  It extends about ten days' march in a north and north-east direction.  To the south and south-east the Atnah, or Chin Indian country, extends about one hundred miles; on the east there is a chain of lakes, and the mountains bordering Thompson River; while to the westward and north-west lie the lands of the Naskotins and Clinches.  The lakes are numerous, and some of them tolerably large: one, two, and even three days are at times required to cross some of them.  They abound in a plentiful variety of fish, such as trout, sucker, etcetera; and the natives assert that white fish is sometimes taken.  These lakes are generally fed by mountain streams, and many of them spread out, and are lost in the surrounding marshes.  On the banks of the river, and in the interior, the trees consist of poplar, cypress, alder, cedar, birch, and different species of fir, spruce, and willow.  There is not the same variety of wild fruit as on the Columbia; and this year (1827) the berries generally failed. Service berries, choke-cherries, gooseberries, strawberries, and red whortleberries are gathered; but among the Indians the service-berry is the great favourite.  There are various kinds of roots, which the natives preserve and dry for periods of scarcity.  There is only one kind which we can eat.  It is called _Tza-chin_, has a bitter taste, but when eaten with salmon imparts an agreeable zest, and effectually destroys the disagreeable smell of that fish when smoke-dried.  Saint John's wort is very common, and has been successfully applied as a fomentation in topical inflammations.  A kind of weed, which the natives convert into a species of flax, is in general demand.  An evergreen, similar to that we found at the mouth of the Columbia, with small berries growing in clusters like grapes, also flourishes in this district.  Sarsaparilla and bear-root are found in abundance.  White earth abounds in the vicinity of the fort; and one description of it, mixed with oil and lime, might be converted into excellent soap.  Coal in considerable quantities has been discovered; and in many places we observed a species of red earth, much resembling lava, and which appeared to be of volcanic origin.  We also found in different parts of New Caledonia quartz, rock crystal, cobalt, talc, iron, marcasites of a gold colour, granite, fuller's earth, some beautiful specimens of black, marble, and limestone in small quantities, which appeared to have been forced down the beds of the rivers from the mountains.  The jumping-deer, or chevreuil, together with the rein and red-deer, frequent the vicinity of the mountains in considerable numbers, and in the summer season they oftentimes descend to the banks of the rivers and the adjacent flat country.  The marmot and wood-rat also abound: the flesh of the former is exquisite, and capital robes are made out of its skin; but the latter is a very destructive animal.  Their dogs are of diminutive size, and strongly resemble those of the Esquimaux, with the curled up tail, small ears, and pointed nose.  We purchased numbers of them for the kettle, their flesh constituting the chief article of food in our holiday feasts for Christmas and New Year.  The fur-bearing animals consist of beavers; bears, black, brown, and grizzly; otters, fishers, lynxes, martins; foxes, red, cross, and silver; minks, musquash, wolverines, and ermines.  Rabbits also are so numerous that the natives manage to subsist on them during the periods that salmon is scarce.  Under the head of ornithology we have the bustard, or Canadian _outarde_ (wild goose), swans, ducks of various descriptions, hawks, plovers, cranes, white-headed eagles, magpies, crows, vultures, wood-thrush, red-breasted thrush or robin, woodpeckers, gulls, pelicans, hawks, partridges, pheasants, and snow-birds.  The spring commences in April, when the wild flowers begin to bud, and from thence to the latter end of May the weather is delightful.  In June it rains incessantly, with strong southerly and easterly winds.  During the months of July and August the heat is intolerable; and in September the fogs are so dense that it is quite impossible to distinguish the opposite side of the river any morning before ten o'clock.  Colds and rheumatisms are prevalent among the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23389"],["title","Handbook to the new Gold-fields (#5)"],["body","during this period: nor are our people exempt from them.  In October the falling of the leaves and occasional frost announce the beginning of winter.  The lakes and parts of the rivers are frozen in November.  The snow seldoms exceeds twenty-four inches in depth.  The mercury in Fahrenheit's thermometer falls in January to 15 degrees below zero; but this does not continue many days. In general, I may say, the climate is neither unhealthy nor unpleasant; and if the natives used common prudence, they would undoubtedly live to an advanced age.  The salmon fishery commences about the middle of July, and ceases in October.  This is a busy period for the natives; for upon their industry in saving a sufficiency of salmon for the winter depends their chief support.  Jub, suckers, trout, and white-fish, are caught in the lakes; and in the month of October, towards the close of the salmon-fishery, we catch trout of a most exquisite flavour.  Large-sized sturgeon are occasionally taken in the _vorveaux_, but they are not relished by the natives.\"  Mr Dunn, in his valuable \"History of the Oregon Territory,\" thus describes the country and climate:--\"After the Columbia, the river next in importance is Fraser River.  It takes its rise in the Rocky Mountains, near the source of Canoe River, taking a north-west course of eighty miles.  It then turns to the southward, receiving Stuart's River, which rises in a chain of lakes in the northern boundary of the territory.  It then pursues a southerly course, and after receiving many tributaries, breaks through the cascade range of hills in a series of falls and rapids; and after a westerly course of seventy miles, empties itself into the Gulf of Georgia, in latitude 49 degrees 7 minutes north. This latter portion is navigable for vessels that can pass its bar drawing ten feet of water.  Its whole length is 350 miles.  There are numerous lakes scattered through the several sections.  The country is all well watered; and there are but four places where an abundance of water cannot be obtained, either from lakes, rivers, or springs.  \"The climate of the western division is mild throughout the year, neither the cold of winter, nor the heat of summer predominating.  The mean temperature is about 50 degrees Fahrenheit.  The prevailing winds, in summer, are from the northward and westward, and in winter, from the west, south, and south-east.  The winter lasts from about November till March, generally speaking.  During that time there are frequent falls of rain, but not heavy.  Snow seldoms lies longer than a week on the ground.  There are frosts so early as September, but they are not severe, and do not continue long.  The easterly winds are the coldest, as they come from across the mountains, but they are not frequent. Fruit trees blossom early in April in the neighbourhood of Nasqually and Vancouver; and in the middle of May pease are a foot high, and strawberries in full blossom; indeed, all fruits and vegetables are as early there as in England.  The hills, though of great declivity, have a sward to their tops.  Lieutenant Wilkes says, that out of 106 days, 67 were fair, 19 cloudy, and 11 rainy.  The middle section is subject to droughts.  During summer the atmosphere is drier and warmer, and in winter colder than in the western section; its extremes of heat and cold being greater and more frequent.  However, the air is fine and healthy; the atmosphere in summer being cooled by the breezes that blow from the Pacific.  \"The soil of the western section varies from a deep black vegetable loam to a light brown loamy earth.  The bills are generally basalt stone and slate.  The surface is generally undulating, well watered, well wooded, and well adapted for agriculture and pasturage.  The timber consists of pine, fir, spruce, oaks (white and red), ash, arbutus, cedar, arbor-vitae, poplar, maple, willow, cherry, tew, with underwoods of hazel and roses.  All kinds of grain, wheat, rice, barley, oats, and pease, can be procured there in abundance.  Various fruits, such as pears, apples, etcetera, succeed there admirably; and the different vegetables produced in England yield there most abundant crops.  \"The middle section, which is about 1000 feet above the level of the western, is not so well wooded or fertile; yet in the southern parts of it, where the missionaries have established settlements, they have raised excellent crops, and reared large stocks of cattle. Notwithstanding the occasional cold, their cattle are not housed, nor is provender laid in for them in any quantity, the country being sufficiently supplied with fodder in the natural hay, that is everywhere abundant in the prairies, which the cattle prefer.\"  Mr Wilkes says, \"In comparison with the United States, I would say, that the labour necessary in this territory to acquire wealth or subsistence is in the proportion of one to three; or in other words, a man must work throughout the year three times as much in the United States to gain the like competency.  The care of stock, which requires so much time with us, requires no attention there, and on the increase only, a man might find support.\"  He further says, \"There will be also a demand for the timber of this country at high prices, throughout the Pacific.  The oak is well adapted for ship timber, and abundance of ash, cedar, cypress, and arbor-vitae may be had for other purposes, building, fuel, fencing,\" etcetera.  He also adds, \"No part of the world affords finer inland sounds, or a greater number of harbours, than are found within the Straits of Juan de Fuca, capable of receiving the highest class of vessels, and without a danger in them which is not viable. From the rise and fall of the tides (eighteen feet) every facility is afforded for the erection of works for a great maritime nation.  The country also affords as many sites for maritime power as any other.\"  On the northern coast there are a number of islands which belong to the territory.  The largest are Vancouver's Island, and Queen Charlotte Island, both of which enjoy a mild and salubrious climate, with a soil well adapted to agriculture.  They have also an abundance of fine fish in their waters.  Coal of a very good quality is found there close by the surface, and they also contain numerous veins of valuable minerals.  All the rivers abound in salmon of the finest quality, which run twice a year, beginning in May and October, and appear inexhaustible.  In Fraser River, the salmon are very numerous.  The bays and inlets abound with several kinds of salmon, sturgeon, cod, carp, sole, flounders, perch, herring, and eels; also with shell-fish--crabs, oysters, etcetera. Whales and sea otters in numbers are found along the coast, and are frequently captured by Indians, in and at the mouth of the Straits of Juan de Fuca.  Game abounds in the western section, such as elk, deer, antelopes, bears, wolves, foxes, musk-rats, martins.  And in the spring and fall, the rivers are covered with geese, ducks, and other water-fowl.  Towards the Rocky Mountains buffaloes are found in great numbers.  From the advantages this country possesses, it bids fair to have an extensive commerce, on advantageous terms, with most parts of the Pacific.  It is well calculated to produce the following staple commodities,--furs, salted beef and pork, grain, flour, wool, hides, tallow, timber, and coals.  And in return for these--sugars, coffee, and other tropical productions may be obtained at the Sandwich Islands. Advantages that in time must become of immense importance.  Those districts of British America west of the lakes which by soil and climate are suitable for settlement, may be thus enumerated:--  Vancouver's Island 16,200 square miles.  Fraser and Thomson Rivers 60,000 ditto  Sources of the Upper Columbia 20,000 ditto  Athabasca District 50,000 ditto  Saskatchewan, Red River, Assineboin, etcetera. 360,000 ditto  506,200  Under these geographical divisions we propose to give the results of a parliamentary investigation (just published) into the affairs of the Hudson's Bay Company, so far as they are descriptive of the foregoing districts:--  VANCOUVER'S ISLAND.  This island is fertile, well timbered, finely diversified by intersecting mountain ranges, and small prairies, with extensive coal fields, compared by one witness to the West Riding of Yorkshire coal, and fortunate in its harbours.  Esquimault Harbour, on which Victoria is situated, is equal to San Francisco.  The salmon and other fisheries are excellent; but this advantage is shared by every stream and inlet of the adjacent coast.  The climate is frequently compared with England, except that it is even warmer.  The winter is stormy, with heavy rains in November and December; frosts occur in the lowlands in January, but seldom interrupt agriculture; vegetation starts in February, rapidly progressing in March and fostered by alternate warm showers and sunshine in April and May--while intense heat and drought are often experienced during June, July, and August.  As already remarked, the island has an area of 16,200 square miles.  FRASER AND THOMPSON RIVERS.  Northward of Vancouver's Island the coast range of mountains trends so near the Pacific as to obstruct intercourse with the interior, but \"inside,\" in the language of a witness, \"it is a fine open country.\" This is the valley of Fraser River.  Ascending this river, near Fort Langley, \"a large tract of land\" is represented as \"adapted to colonists;\" while of Thomson River, the same witness says that it is \"one of the most beautiful countries in the world\"--\"climate capable of producing all the crops of England, and much milder than Canada.\"  The sources of Fraser River, in latitude 55 degrees, are separated from those of Peace River (which flows through the Rocky Mountains, eastward, into the Athabasca) by the distance of only 317 yards.
