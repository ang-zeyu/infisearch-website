For an infant so keen   Might in future have been     A woman of awful renown,   Who carried on fights   For her feminine rights     As the Mare of an Arkansas town.   She might have continued the crime of her 'teens,   And come to write verse for the Big Magazines!    [Illustration]     _The Moral_: There's nothing much glummer     Than children whose talents appall:   One much prefers those who are dumber,     But as for the paragons small,   If a swallow cannot make a summer     It can bring on a summary fall!    [Illustration]       _How the Fatuous Wish of a Peasant Came True_     An excellent peasant,   Of character pleasant,     Once lived in a hut with his wife.   He was cheerful and docile,   But such an old fossil     You wouldn't meet twice in your life.   His notions were all without reason or rhyme,   Such dullness in any one else were a crime,     But the folly pig-headed   To which he was wedded   Was so deep imbedded,         it touched the sublime!    [Illustration]    He frequently stated   Such quite antiquated     And singular doctrines as these:   _\"Do good unto others!   All men are your brothers!\"_     (Of course he forgot the Chinese!)   He said that all men were made equal and free,   (That's true if they're born on _our_ side of the sea!)     That truth should be spoken,   And pledges unbroken:   (Now where, by that token,         would most of us be?)    [Illustration]    One day, as his pottage   He ate in his cottage,     A fairy stepped up to the door;   Upon it she hammered,   And meekly she stammered:     \"A morsel of food I implore.\"   He gave her sardines, and a biscuit or two,   And she said in reply, when her luncheon was through,     \"In return for these dishes   Of bread and of fishes   The first of your wishes         I'll make to come true!\"    That nincompoop peasant   Accepted the present,     (As most of us probably would,)   And, thinking her bounty   To turn to account, he     Said: \"_Now_ I'll do somebody good!   I won't ask a thing for myself or my wife,   But I'll make all my neighbors with happiness rife.     Whate'er their conditions,     Henceforward, physicians     And indispositions         they're rid of for life!\"    [Illustration]    These words energetic   The fairy's prophetic     Announcement brought instantly true:   With singular quickness   Each victim of sickness     Was made over, better than new,   And people who formerly thought they were doomed   With almost obstreperous healthiness bloomed,     And each had some platitude,     Teeming with gratitude,     For the new attitude         life had assumed.    [Illustration]    Our friend's satisfaction   Concerning his action     Was keen, but exceedingly brief.   The wrathful condition   Of every physician     In town was surpassing belief!   Professional nurses were plunged in despair,   And chemists shook passionate fists in the air:     They called at his dwelling,     With violence swelling,     His greeting repelling         with arrogant stare.    [Illustration]    They beat and they battered,   They slammed and they shattered,     And did him such serious harm,   That, after their labors,   His wife told the neighbors     They'd caused her excessive alarm!   They then set to work on his various ills,   And plied him with liniments, powders, and pills,     And charged him so dearly     That all of them nearly     Made double the yearly         amount of their bills.     _This Moral_ by the tale is taught:--   The wish is father to the thought.   (We'd oftentimes escape the worst   If but the thinking part came first!)       How Hop O' My Thumb Got Rid of an Onus     [Illustration]    A worthy couple, man and wife,   Dragged on a discontented life:     The reason, I should state,   That it was destitute of joys,   Was that they had a dozen boys     To feed and educate,   And nothing such patience demands   As having twelve boys on your hands!    [Illustration]    For twenty years they tried their best   To keep those urchins neatly dressed     And teach them to be good,   But so much labor it involved   That, in the end, they both resolved     To lose them in a wood,   Though nothing a parent annoys   Like heartlessly losing his boys!    So when their sons had gone to bed,   Though bitter tears the couple shed,     They laid their little plan.   \"_Faut b'en que ça s'fasse. Quand même_,\"   The woman said, \"_J'en suis tout' blème._\"     \"_Ça colle!_\" observed the man,   \"_Mais ça coute, que ces gosses fichus!   B'en, quoi! Faut qu'i's soient perdus!_\"    (I've quite omitted to explain   That they were natives of Touraine;     I see I must translate.)   \"Of course it must be done, and still,\"   The wife remarked, \"it makes me ill.\"     \"You bet!\" replied her mate:   \"But we've both of us counted the cost,   And the kids simply _have_ to be lost!\"    [Illustration]    But, while they plotted, every word   The youngest of the urchins heard,     And winked the other eye;   His height was only two feet three.   (I might remark, in passing, he     Was little, but O My!)   He added: \"I'd better keep mum.\"   (He was foxy, was Hop O' My Thumb!)    [Illustration]    They took the boys into the wood,   And lost them, as they said they should,     And came in silence back.   Alas for them! Hop O' My Thumb   At every step had dropped a crumb,     And so retraced the track.   While the parents sat mourning their fate   He led the boys in at the gate!    He placed his hand upon his heart,   And said: \"You think you're awful smart,     But I have foiled you thus!\"   His parents humbly bent the knee,   And meekly said: \"H. O. M. T.,     You're one too much for us!\"   And both of them solemnly swore   \"We won't never do so no more!\"    [Illustration]     _The Moral_ is: While I do not   Endeavor to condone the plot,     I still maintain that one   Should have no chance of being foiled,   And having one's arrangements spoiled     By one's ingenious son.   If you turn down your children, with pain,   Take care they don't turn up again!       How the Helpmate of Blue-Beard Made Free with a Door     [Illustration]    A maiden from the Bosphorus,   With eyes as bright as phosphorus,     Once wed the wealthy bailiff                     Of the caliph                           Of Kelat.   Though diligent and zealous, he   Became a slave to jealousy.     (Considering her beauty,                     'Twas his duty                           To be that!)    When business would necessitate   A journey, he would hesitate,     But, fearing to disgust her,                     He would trust her                           With his keys,   Remarking to her prayerfully:   \"I beg you'll use them carefully.     Don't look what I deposit                     In that closet,                           If you please.\"    It may be mentioned, casually,   That blue as lapis lazuli     He dyed his hair, his lashes,                     His mustaches,                           And his beard.   And, just because he did it, he   Aroused his wife's timidity:     Her terror she dissembled,                     But she trembled                           When he neared.    [Illustration: _This shows how grim Blue-Beard, when bound on a bat,                  Instructed his wife on the key of a flat!_]    This feeling insalubrious   Soon made her most lugubrious,     And bitterly she missed her                     Elder sister                           Marie Anne:   She asked if she might write her to   Come down and spend a night or two,     Her husband answered rightly                     And politely:                           \"Yes, you can!\"                            Blue-Beard, the Monday following,                           His jealous feeling swallowing,                             Packed all his clothes together                                            In a leather-                                                  Bound valise,                           And, feigning reprehensibly,                           He started out, ostensibly                             By traveling to learn a                                            Bit of Smyrna                                                  And of Greece.    His wife made but a cursory   Inspection of the nursery;     The kitchen and the airy                     Little dairy                           Were a bore,   As well as big or scanty rooms,   And billiard, bath, and ante-rooms,     But not that interdicted                     And restricted                           Little door!    [Illustration]    For, all her curiosity   Awakened by the closet he     So carefully had hidden,                     And forbidden                           Her to see,   This damsel disobedient   Did something inexpedient,     And in the keyhole tiny                     Turned the shiny                           Little key:    [Illustration]    Then started back impulsively,   And shrieked aloud convulsively--     Three heads of girls he'd wedded                     And beheaded                           Met her eye!   And turning round, much terrified,   Her darkest fears were verified,     For Blue-Beard stood behind her,                     Come to find her                           On the sly!    [Illustration]    Perceiving she was fated to   Be soon decapitated, too,     She telegraphed her brothers                     And some others                           What she feared.   And Sister Anne looked out for them,   In readiness to shout for them     Whenever in the distance                     With assistance                           They appeared.    But only from her battlement   She saw some dust that cattle meant.     The ordinary story                     Isn't gory,                           But a jest.   But here's the truth unqualified.

How Rumplestilz Held Out in Vain for a Bonus     In Germany there lived an earl     Who had a charming niece:   And never gave the timid girl     A single moment's peace!   Whatever low and menial task     His fancy flitted through,   He did not hesitate to ask     That shrinking child to do.   (I see with truly honest shame you   Are blushing, and I do not blame you.   A tale like this the feelings softens,   And brings the tears, as does \"Two Orphans.\")    [Illustration]    She had to wash the windows, and     She had to scrub the floors,   She had to lend a willing hand     To fifty other chores:   She gave the dog his exercise,     She read the earl the news,   She ironed all his evening ties,     And polished all his shoes,   She cleaned the tins that filled the dairy,   She cut the claws of the canary,   And then, at night, with manner winsome,   When coal was wanted, carried in some!    But though these tasks were quite enough,     He thought them all too few,   And so her uncle, rude and rough,     Invented something new.   He took her to a little room,     Her willingness to tax,   And pointed out a broken loom     And half a ton of flax,   Observing: \"Spin six pairs of trousers!\"   His haughty manner seemed to rouse hers.   She met his scornful glances proudly--    [Illustration]    But when the earl went down the stair     She yielded to her fears.   Gave way at last to grim despair,     And melted into tears:   When suddenly, from out the wall,     As if he felt at home,   There pounced a singularly small     And much distorted gnome.   He smiled a smile extremely vapid,   And set to work in fashion rapid;   No time for resting he deducted,   And soon the trousers were constructed.    [Illustration]    The girl observed: \"How very nice     To help me out this way!\"   The gnome replied: \"A certain price     Of course you'll have to pay.   I'll call to-morrow afternoon,     My due reward to claim,   And then you'll sing another tune     Unless you guess my name!\"   He indicated with a gesture   The pile of newly fashioned vesture:   His eyes on hers a moment centered,   And then he went, as he had entered.    [Illustration]    As by this tale you have been grieved     And heartily distressed,   Kind sir, you will be much relieved     To know his name she guessed:    But if I do not tell the same,     Pray count it not a crime:--   I've tried my best, and for that name     I can't find any rhyme!   Yet spare me from remarks injurious:   I will not leave you foiled and furious.   If something must proclaim the answer,   And I cannot, the title can, sir!     _The Moral_ is: All said and done,   There's nothing new beneath the sun,   And many times before, a title   Was incapacity's requital!       How Jack Made the Giants Uncommonly Sore     Of all the ill-fated   Boys ever created     Young Jack was the wretchedest lad:   An emphatic, erratic,   Dogmatic fanatic     Was foisted upon him as dad!   From the time he could walk,   And before he could talk,     His wearisome training began,   On a highly barbarian,   Disciplinarian,   Nearly Tartarean         Plan!    [Illustration]    He taught him some Raleigh,   And some of Macaulay,     Till all of \"Horatius\" he knew,   And the drastic, sarcastic,   Fantastic, scholastic     Philippics of \"Junius,\" too.   He made him learn lots   Of the poems of Watts,     And frequently said he ignored,   On principle, any son's   Title to benisons   Till he'd learned Tennyson's         \"Maud.\"    \"For these are the giants   Of thought and of science,\"     He said in his positive way:   \"So weigh them, obey them,   Display them, and lay them     To heart in your infancy's day!\"   Jack made no reply,   But he said on the sly     An eloquent word, that had come   From a quite indefensible,   Most reprehensible,   But indispensable         Chum.    By the time he was twenty   Jack had such a plenty     Of books and paternal advice,   Though seedy and needy,   Indeed he was greedy     For vengeance, whatever the price!   In the editor's seat   Of a critical sheet     He found the revenge that he sought;   And, with sterling appliance of   Mind, wrote defiance of   All of the giants of         Thought.    He'd thunder and grumble   At high and at humble     Until he became, in a while,   Mordacious, pugnacious,   Rapacious. Good gracious!     They called him the Yankee Carlyle!   But he never took rest   On his quarrelsome quest     Of the giants, both mighty and small.   He slated, distorted them,   Hanged them and quartered them,   Till he had slaughtered them         All.     And this is _The Moral_ that lies in the verse:   If you have a go farther, you're apt to fare worse.   (When you turn it around it is different rather:--   You're not apt to go worse if you have a fair father!)    [Illustration]       How Rudeness and Kindness Were Justly Rewarded     Once on a time, long years ago     (Just when I quite forget),   Two maidens lived beside the Po,     One blonde and one brunette.   The blonde one's character was mild,   From morning until night she smiled,   Whereas the one whose hair was brown   Did little else than pine and frown.     (_I_ think one ought to draw the line     At girls who always frown and pine!)    The blonde one learned to play the harp,     Like all accomplished dames,   And trained her voice to take _C_ sharp     As well as Emma Eames;   Made baskets out of scented grass,   And paper-weights of hammered brass,   And lots of other odds and ends   For gentleman and lady friends.     (_I_ think it takes a deal of sense     To manufacture gifts for gents!)    The dark one wore an air of gloom,     Proclaimed the world a bore,   And took her breakfast in her room     Three mornings out of four.   With crankiness she seemed imbued,   And everything she said was rude:   She sniffed, and sneered, and, what is more,   When very much provoked, she swore!     (_I_ think that I could never care     For any girl who'd learned to swear!)    One day the blonde was striding past     A forest, all alone,   When all at once her eyes she cast     Upon a wrinkled crone,   Who tottered near with shaking knees,   And said: \"A penny, if you please!\"   And you will learn with some surprise   This was a fairy in disguise!     (_I_ think it must be hard to know     A fairy who's incognito!)    The maiden filled her trembling palms     With coinage of the realm.   The fairy said: \"Take back your alms!     My heart they overwhelm.   Henceforth at every word shall slip   A pearl or ruby from your lip!\"   And, when the girl got home that night,--   She found the fairy's words were right!     (_I_ think there are not many girls     Whose words are worth their weight in pearls!)    [Illustration]    It happened that the cross brunette,     Ten minutes later, came   Along the self-same road, and met     That bent and wrinkled dame,   Who asked her humbly for a sou.   The girl replied: \"Get out with you!\"   The fairy cried: \"Each word you drop,   A toad from out your mouth shall hop!\"     (_I_ think that nothing incommodes     One's speech like uninvited toads!)    And so it was, the cheerful blonde     Lived on in joy and bliss,   And grew pecunious, beyond     The dreams of avarice!   And to a nice young man was wed,   And I have often heard it said   No other man who ever walked   Most loved his wife when most she talked!     (_I_ think this very fact, forsooth,     Goes far to prove I tell the truth!)    The cross brunette the fairy's joke     By hook or crook survived,   But still at every word she spoke     An ugly toad arrived,   Until at last she had to come   To feigning she was wholly dumb,   Whereat the suitors swarmed around,   And soon a wealthy mate she found.     (_I_ think nobody ever knew     The happier husband of the two!)     _The Moral_ of the tale is: Bah!   _Nous avons changé tout celà._   No clear idea I hope to strike   Of what _your_ nicest girl is like,   But she whose best young man _I_ am   Is not an oyster, nor a clam!    [Illustration: _This shows why each suitor, who rode up to spark,                  Would mark the toad maybe, but ne'er toed the mark._]       How Beauty Contrived to Get Square with the Beast     Miss Guinevere Platt   Was so beautiful that     She couldn't remember the day   When one of her swains   Hadn't taken the pains     To send her a mammoth bouquet.   And the postman had found,   On the whole of his round,     That no one received such a lot   Of bulky epistles   As, waiting his whistles,     The beautiful Guinevere got!    [Illustration]    A significant sign   That her charm was divine     Was seen in society, when   The chaperons sniffed   With their eyebrows alift:     \"Whatever's got into the men?\"   There was always a man   Who was holding her fan,     And twenty that danced in details,   And a couple of mourners,   Who brooded in corners,     And gnawed their mustaches and nails.    John Jeremy Platt   Wouldn't stay in the flat,     For his beautiful daughter he missed:   When he'd taken his tub,   He would hie to his club,     And dally with poker or whist.   At the end of a year   It was perfectly clear     That he'd never computed the cost,   For he hadn't a penny   To settle the many     Ten thousands of dollars he'd lost!    F. Ferdinand Fife   Was a student of life:     He was coarse, and excessively fat,   With a beard like a goat's,   But he held all the notes     Of ruined John Jeremy Platt!   With an adamant smile   That was brimming with guile,     He said: \"I am took with the face   Of your beautiful daughter,   And wed me she ought ter,     To save you from utter disgrace!\"    Miss Guinevere Platt   Didn't hesitate at     Her duty's imperative call.
