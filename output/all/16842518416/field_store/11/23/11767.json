In woe and weal       To be a helpmate swears the bride.     This is my place; by solemn oath       Wherever thou conductest him     I too must go, to keep my troth;       And if the eye at times should brim,     'Tis human weakness, give me strength       My work appointed to fulfil,     That I may gain the crown at length       The gods give those who do their will.      \"The power of goodness is so great       We pray to feel its influence     For ever on us. It is late,       And the strange landscape awes my sense;     But I would fain with thee go on,       And hear thy voice so true and kind;     The false lights that on objects shone       Have vanished, and no longer blind,     Thanks to thy simple presence. Now       I feel a fresher air around,     And see the glory of that brow       With flashing rubies fitly crowned.      \"Men call thee Yama--conqueror,       Because it is against their will     They follow thee,--and they abhor       The Truth which thou wouldst aye instil.     If they thy nature knew aright,       O god, all other gods above!     And that thou conquerest in the fight       By patience, kindness, mercy, love,     And not by devastating wrath,       They would not shrink in childlike fright     To see thy shadow on their path,       But hail thee as sick souls the light.\"      \"Thy words, Savitri, greet mine ear       As sweet as founts that murmur low     To one who in the deserts drear       With parchèd tongue moves faint and slow,     Because thy talk is heart-sincere,       Without hypocrisy or guile;     Demand another boon, my dear,       But not of those forbad erewhile,     And I shall grant it, ere we part:       Lo, the stars pale,--the way is long,     Receive thy boon, and homewards start,       For ah, poor child, thou art not strong.\"      \"Another boon! My sire the king       Beside myself hath children none,     Oh grant that from his stock may spring       A hundred boughs.\" \"It shall be done.     He shall be blest with many a son       Who his old palace shall rejoice.\"     \"Each heart-wish from thy goodness won,       If I am still allowed a choice,     I fain thy voice would ever hear,       Reluctant am I still to part,     The way seems short when thou art near       And Satyavan, my heart's dear heart.      \"Of all the pleasures given on earth       The company of the good is best,     For weariness has never birth       In such a commerce sweet and blest;     The sun runs on its wonted course,       The earth its plenteous treasure yields,     All for their sake, and by the force       Their prayer united ever wields.     Oh let me, let me ever dwell       Amidst the good, where'er it be,     Whether in lowly hermit-cell       Or in some spot beyond the sea.      \"The favours man accords to men       Are never fruitless, from them rise     A thousand acts beyond our ken       That float like incense to the skies;     For benefits can ne'er efface,       They multiply and widely spread,     And honour follows on their trace.       Sharp penances, and vigils dread,     Austerities, and wasting fasts,       Create an empire, and the blest     Long as this spiritual empire lasts       Become the saviours of the rest.\"      \"O thou endowed with every grace       And every virtue,--thou whose soul     Appears upon thy lovely face,       May the great gods who all control     Send thee their peace. I too would give       One favour more before I go;     Ask something for thyself, and live       Happy, and dear to all below,     Till summoned to the bliss above.       Savitri ask, and ask unblamed.\"--     She took the clue, felt Death was Love,       For no exceptions now he named,      And boldly said,--\"Thou knowest, Lord,       The inmost hearts and thoughts of all!     There is no need to utter word,       Upon thy mercy sole, I call.     If speech be needful to obtain       Thy grace,--oh hear a wife forlorn,     Let my Satyavan live again       And children unto us be born,     Wise, brave, and valiant.\" \"From thy stock       A hundred families shall spring     As lasting as the solid rock,       Each son of thine shall be a king.\"      As thus he spoke, he loosed the knot       The soul of Satyavan that bound,     And promised further that their lot       In pleasant places should be found     Thenceforth, and that they both should live       Four centuries, to which the name     Of fair Savitri, men would give,--       And then he vanished in a flame.     \"Adieu, great god!\" She took the soul,       No bigger than the human thumb,     And running swift, soon reached her goal,       Where lay the body stark and dumb.      She lifted it with eager hands       And as before, when he expired,     She placed the head upon the bands       That bound her breast which hope new-fired,     And which alternate rose and fell;       Then placed his soul upon his heart     Whence like a bee it found its cell,       And lo, he woke with sudden start!     His breath came low at first, then deep,       With an unquiet look he gazed,     As one awaking from a sleep       Wholly bewildered and amazed.   PART V.      As consciousness came slowly back       He recognised his loving wife--     \"Who was it, Love, through regions black       Where hardly seemed a sign of life     Carried me bound? Methinks I view       The dark face yet--a noble face,     He had a robe of scarlet hue,       And ruby crown; far, far through space     He bore me, on and on, but now,\"--       \"Thou hast been sleeping, but the man     With glory on his kingly brow,       Is gone, thou seest, Satyavan!      \"O my belovèd,--thou art free!       Sleep which had bound thee fast, hath left     Thine eyelids. Try thyself to be!       For late of every sense bereft     Thou seemedst in a rigid trance;       And if thou canst, my love, arise,     Regard the night, the dark expanse       Spread out before us, and the skies.\"     Supported by her, looked he long       Upon the landscape dim outspread,     And like some old remembered song       The past came back,--a tangled thread.      \"I had a pain, as if an asp       Gnawed in my brain, and there I lay     Silent, for oh! I could but gasp,       Till someone came that bore away     My spirit into lands unknown:       Thou, dear, who watchedst beside me,--say     Was it a dream from elfland blown,       Or very truth,--my doubts to stay.\"     \"O Love, look round,--how strange and dread       The shadows of the high trees fall,     Homeward our path now let us tread,       To-morrow I shall tell thee all.      \"Arise! Be strong! Gird up thy loins!       Think of our parents, dearest friend!     The solemn darkness haste enjoins,       Not likely is it soon to end.     Hark! Jackals still at distance howl,       The day, long, long will not appear,     Lo, wild fierce eyes through bushes scowl,       Summon thy courage, lest I fear.     Was that the tiger's sullen growl?       What means this rush of many feet?     Can creatures wild so near us prowl?       Rise up, and hasten homewards, sweet!\"      He rose, but could not find the track,       And then, too well, Savitri knew     His wonted force had not come back.       She made a fire, and from the dew     Essayed to shelter him. At last       He nearly was himself again,--     Then vividly rose all the past,       And with the past, new fear and pain.     \"What anguish must my parents feel       Who wait for me the livelong hours!     Their sore wound let us haste to heal       Before it festers, past our powers:      \"For broken-hearted, they may die!       Oh hasten dear,--now I am strong,     No more I suffer, let us fly,       Ah me! each minute seems so long.     They told me once, they could not live       Without me, in their feeble age,     Their food and water I must give       And help them in the last sad stage     Of earthly life, and that Beyond       In which a son can help by rites.     Oh what a love is theirs--how fond!       Whom now Despair, perhaps, benights.      \"Infirm herself, my mother dear       Now guides, methinks, the tottering feet     Of my blind father, for they hear       And hasten eagerly to meet     Our fancied steps. O faithful wife       Let us on wings fly back again,     Upon their safety hangs my life!\"       He tried his feelings to restrain,     But like some river swelling high       They swept their barriers weak and vain,     Sudden there burst a fearful cry,       Then followed tears,--like autumn rain.      Hush! Hark, a sweet voice rises clear!       A voice of earnestness intense,     \"If I have worshipped Thee in fear       And duly paid with reverence     The solemn sacrifices,--hear!       Send consolation, and thy peace     Eternal, to our parents dear,       That their anxieties may cease.     Oh, ever hath I loved Thy truth,       Therefore on Thee I dare to call,     Help us, this night, and them, for sooth       Without thy help, we perish all.\"      She took in hers Satyavan's hand,       She gently wiped his falling tears,     \"This weakness, Love, I understand!       Courage!\" She smiled away his fears.     \"Now we shall go, for thou art strong.\"       She helped him rise up by her side     And led him like a child along,       He, wistfully the basket eyed     Laden with fruit and flowers. \"Not now,       To-morrow we shall fetch it hence.\"     And so, she hung it on a bough,       \"I'll bear thy saw for our defence.\"      In one fair hand the saw she took,       The other with a charming grace     She twined around him, and her look       She turnèd upwards to his face.     Thus aiding him she felt anew       His bosom beat against her own--     More firm his step, more clear his view,       More self-possessed his words and tone     Became,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23245"],["title","Ancient Ballads and Legends of Hindustan (#6)"],["body"," as swift the minutes past,       And now the pathway he discerns,     And 'neath the trees, they hurry fast,       For Hope's fair light before them burns.      Under the faint beams of the stars       How beautiful appeared the flowers,     Light scarlet, flecked with golden bars       Of the palâsas,[1] in the bowers     That Nature there herself had made       Without the aid of man. At times     Trees on their path cast densest shade,       And nightingales sang mystic rhymes     Their fears and sorrows to assuage.       Where two paths met, the north they chose,     As leading to the hermitage,       And soon before them, dim it rose.      Here let us end. For all may guess       The blind old king received his sight,     And ruled again with gentleness       The country that was his by right;     And that Savitri's royal sire       Was blest with many sons,--a race     Whom poets praised for martial fire,       And every peaceful gift and grace.     As for Savitri, to this day       Her name is named, when couples wed,     And to the bride the parents say,       Be thou like her, in heart and head.   [1] _Butea frondosa._     II.  LAKSHMAN.       \"Hark! Lakshman! Hark, again that cry!       It is,--it is my husband's voice!     Oh hasten, to his succour fly,       No more hast thou, dear friend, a choice.     He calls on thee, perhaps his foes       Environ him on all sides round,     That wail,--it means death's final throes!       Why standest thou, as magic-bound?      \"Is this a time for thought,--oh gird       Thy bright sword on, and take thy bow!     He heeds not, hears not any word,       Evil hangs over us, I know!     Swift in decision, prompt in deed,       Brave unto rashness, can this be,     The man to whom all looked at need?       Is it my brother, that I see!      \"Ah no, and I must run alone,       For further here I cannot stay;     Art thou transformed to blind dumb stone!       Wherefore this impious, strange delay!     That cry,--that cry,--it seems to ring       Still in my ears,--I cannot bear     Suspense; if help we fail to bring       His death at least we both can share.\"      \"Oh calm thyself, Videhan Queen,       No cause is there for any fear,     Hast thou his prowess never seen?       Wipe off for shame that dastard tear!     What being of demonian birth       Could ever brave his mighty arm?     Is there a creature on the earth       That dares to work our hero harm?      \"The lion and the grisly bear       Cower when they see his royal look,     Sun-staring eagles of the air       His glance of anger cannot brook,     Pythons and cobras at his tread       To their most secret coverts glide,     Bowed to the dust each serpent head       Erect before in hooded pride.      \"Rakshases, Danavs, demons, ghosts,       Acknowledge in their hearts his might,     And slink to their remotest coasts,       In terror at his very sight.     Evil to him! Oh fear it not,       Whatever foes against him rise!     Banish for aye, the foolish thought,       And be thyself,--bold, great, and wise.      \"He call for help! Canst thou believe       He like a child would shriek for aid     Or pray for respite or reprieve--       Not of such metal is he made!     Delusive was that piercing cry,--       Some trick of magic by the foe;     He has a work,--he cannot die,       Beseech me not from hence to go.      \"For here beside thee, as a guard       'Twas he commanded me to stay,     And dangers with my life to ward       If they should come across thy way.     Send me not hence, for in this wood       Bands scattered of the giants lurk,     Who on their wrongs and vengeance brood,       And wait the hour their will to work.\"      \"Oh shame! And canst thou make my weal       A plea for lingering! Now I know     What thou art Lakshman! And I feel       Far better were an open foe.     Art thou a coward? I have seen       Thy bearing in the battle-fray     Where flew the death-fraught arrows keen,       Else had I judged thee so to-day.      \"But then thy leader stood beside!       Dazzles the cloud when shines the sun,     Reft of his radiance, see it glide       A shapeless mass of vapours dun;     So of thy courage,--or if not,       The matter is far darker dyed,     What makes thee loth to leave this spot?       Is there a motive thou wouldst hide?      \"He perishes--well, let him die!       His wife henceforth shall be mine own!     Can that thought deep imbedded lie       Within thy heart's most secret zone!     Search well and see! one brother takes       His kingdom,--one would take his wife!     A fair partition!--But it makes       Me shudder, and abhor my life.      \"Art thou in secret league with those       Who from his hope the kingdom rent?     A spy from his ignoble foes       To track him in his banishment?     And wouldst thou at his death rejoice?       I know thou wouldst, or sure ere now     When first thou heardst that well-known voice       Thou shouldst have run to aid, I trow.      \"Learn this,--whatever comes may come,       But I shall not survive my Love,--     Of all my thoughts here is the sum!       Witness it gods in heaven above.     If fire can burn, or water drown,       I follow him:--choose what thou wilt,     Truth with its everlasting crown,       Or falsehood, treachery, and guilt.      \"Remain here, with a vain pretence       Of shielding me from wrong and shame,     Or go and die in his defence       And leave behind a noble name.     Choose what thou wilt,--I urge no more,       My pathway lies before me clear,     I did not know thy mind before,       I know thee now,--and have no fear.\"      She said and proudly from him turned,--       Was this the gentle Sîta? No.     Flames from her eyes shot forth and burned,       The tears therein had ceased to flow.     \"Hear me, O Queen, ere I depart,       No longer can I bear thy words,     They lacerate my inmost heart       And torture me, like poisoned swords.      \"Have I deserved this at thine hand?       Of lifelong loyalty and truth     Is this the meed? I understand       Thy feelings, Sîta, and in sooth     I blame thee not,--but thou mightst be       Less rash in judgement. Look! I go,     Little I care what comes to me       Wert thou but safe,--God keep thee so!      \"In going hence I disregard       The plainest orders of my chief,     A deed for me,--a soldier,--hard       And deeply painful, but thy grief     And language, wild and wrong, allow       No other course. Mine be the crime,     And mine alone,--but oh, do thou       Think better of me from this time.      \"Here with an arrow, lo, I trace       A magic circle ere I leave,     No evil thing within this space       May come to harm thee or to grieve.     Step not, for aught, across the line,       Whatever thou mayst see or hear,     So shalt thou balk the bad design       Of every enemy I fear.      \"And now farewell! What thou hast said,       Though it has broken quite my heart,     So that I wish that I were dead--       I would before, O Queen, we part     Freely forgive, for well I know       That grief and fear have made thee wild,     We part as friends,--is it not so?\"       And speaking thus,--he sadly smiled.      \"And oh ye sylvan gods that dwell       Among these dim and sombre shades,     Whose voices in the breezes swell       And blend with noises of cascades,     Watch over Sîta, whom alone       I leave, and keep her safe from harm,     Till we return unto our own,       I and my brother, arm in arm.      \"For though ill omens round us rise       And frighten her dear heart, I feel     That he is safe. Beneath the skies       His equal is not,--and his heel     Shall tread all adversaries down,       Whoever they may chance to be.--     Farewell, O Sîta! Blessings crown       And Peace for ever rest with thee!\"      He said, and straight his weapons took       His bow and arrows pointed keen,     Kind,--nay, indulgent,--was his look,       No trace of anger there was seen,     Only a sorrow dark, that seemed       To deepen his resolve to dare     All dangers. Hoarse the vulture screamed,       As out he strode with dauntless air.     III.  JOGADHYA UMA.       \"Shell-bracelets ho! Shell-bracelets ho!       Fair maids and matrons come and buy!\"     Along the road, in morning's glow,       The pedlar raised his wonted cry.     The road ran straight, a red, red line,       To Khirogram, for cream renowned,     Through pasture-meadows where the kine,       In knee-deep grass, stood magic bound     And half awake, involved in mist,       That floated in dun coils profound,     Till by the sudden sunbeams kist       Rich rainbow hues broke all around.      \"Shell-bracelets ho! Shell-bracelets ho!\"       The roadside trees still dripped with dew,     And hung their blossoms like a show.       Who heard the cry? 'Twas but a few,     A ragged herd-boy, here and there,       With his long stick and naked feet;     A ploughman wending to his care,       The field from which he hopes the wheat;     An early traveller, hurrying fast       To the next town; an urchin slow     Bound for the school; these heard and past,       Unheeding all,--\"Shell-bracelets ho!\"      Pellucid spread a lake-like tank       Beside the road now lonelier still,     High on three sides arose the bank       Which fruit-trees shadowed at their will;     Upon the fourth side was the Ghat,       With its broad stairs of marble white,     And at the entrance-arch there sat,       Full face against the morning light,     A fair young woman with large eyes,       And dark hair falling to her zone,     She heard the pedlar's cry arise,       And eager seemed his ware to own.      \"Shell-bracelets ho! See, maiden see!       The rich enamel sunbeam-kist!     Happy, oh happy, shalt thou be,       Let them but clasp that slender wrist;     These bracelets are a mighty charm,       They keep a lover ever true,     And widowhood avert, and harm,       Buy them,"]]]
