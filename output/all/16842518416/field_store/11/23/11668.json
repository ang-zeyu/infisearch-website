At last she gasped out, \"Oh, father, what nothings we are!\"  \"That's what many a seaman feels, even on board a line-of-battle ship, when in a sea like this, though he doesn't say it,\" I remarked.  \"Yes, Mary, we are indeed nothing, but we are in the hands of God, and He it is with His wise laws governs the movement of every one of those vast mountain billows.  Let but one of them in our track go out of its course, and this little craft, ay, and the biggest afloat, would be utterly overwhelmed and driven down by the tremendous weight of water which would fall over her.\"  Mary stood gazing, lost in wonder, and not a little fear also, and unable to speak.  However, when I proposed her going below again, she was very unwilling to quit the deck.  \"I shall dream of this for many a night,\" she said.  While I was speaking, I caught sight of a sail to the eastward.  I looked for her again, as we rose to the top of the next sea, and pointed her out to Peter.  \"Yes, father, sure enough there is a sail, and a large craft too, though she has but little canvas set: we are nearing her, I fancy.\"  The stranger was, however, nearing us, and as we occasionally got a glimpse of her through our glasses, we saw that she had carried away her main-topmast and mizzenmast, and that she was labouring much, running before the wind with only a close-reefed fore-topsail set.  As far as we could judge she looked indeed in some distress.  On she came towards us. The wind now again increased, and the seas became more dangerous. Fearing that one might break over us, I sent Mary and Susan and the boys below again, and secured the hatches over them; which done, we passed life lines fore and aft, to give us a holdfast in case of accidents. The stranger drew nearer and nearer.  We now saw how deep she was in the water, and how terribly she was labouring.  I watched her with double anxiety, on her account as well as on our own.  In another ten minutes she would be down upon us, and from the course she was steering, it would be a miracle if we escaped destruction.  Just then a signal of distress was run up, but the flag was instantly blown away, and the next minute she gave a plunge forward, and before she rose her remaining mast went over the bows, where the spars hung seemingly engaged in battering them in.  Scarcely had this occurred than she broached to, and lay like a helpless log in the trough of the seas.  Still she was fearfully near, and I was far from satisfied that she would not drive down upon us, and if so, inevitably with one touch send us to the bottom.  Our only chance of escape was to make sail, but the alternative was a dangerous one.  I was preparing to do this when we saw those on board stretching out their hands towards us imploring help.  It was a piteous sight, for none could we afford, and all her own boats had, we saw, been washed away.  Now, as we mounted to the summit of a sea, she began, it seemed, to climb up another watery height, but a still vaster billow came rolling on, and thundering over her deck; down she went beneath it, and the next moment, when we looked, not a trace of her was to be seen except a few planks and spars, which rose to the surface out of the vortex she formed as she sank.  Yes, as we continued to gaze, between us and where she had been floated a grating, and to it clung a human form.  He was alive, for he turned his head towards us, as if beseeching us to save him.  It is strange that we felt more eager to do so than we had been to save all the poor beings who had just gone down before our eyes.  The reason was plain; in the first instance we knew that we could not help them; there seemed a possibility that we might rescue the person now floating so close to us.  He was being cast by the sea nearer and nearer to us.  We got ropes ready at either end of the vessel to heave to him.  Peter fastened one round his own waist.  \"Take care, Peter,\" said I.  \"He may not be able to seize a rope, father, as he drives by, and I may have a chance of getting hold of him,\" he answered.  I couldn't deny him, but I trembled for my son's safety; still, when a right thing is to be done, when life is to be saved, we must not be too nice about calculating the loss we may suffer.  Now we thought that the stranger would be driven away from us, now again he was washed towards the schooner; if our feelings of anxiety were intense, how much greater must his have been?  Now he appeared on the foaming summit of a sea far above us, then he went sinking down deep into the gulf below.  Truly there seemed to be a power above guiding him.  I can have no doubt there was.  Suddenly a sea drove him close to the schooner; I thought for a moment that it would have actually washed him on board.  \"Hold on,\" cried Peter, springing into the foaming water; and before the drowning man was carried away again he had grasped him by the shoulders, the man still holding to the raft.  Thus together they were towed alongside, and Peter holding on to the man with a strength which I scarcely supposed he possessed, they were hauled up on deck.  The stranger immediately fainted, and Peter was in a very little better condition for a short time; however, he soon recovered.  The stranger we took below, and by rubbing his body with hot flannels, putting bags of sand made hot to his feet and hands, and pouring a little weak brandy and water down his throat, he at length, to our great satisfaction, came round.  He remained in bed all that day and the next, and I wouldn't let him say anything, not even to tell us who he was, greatly to the disappointment of my wife and daughters, who were naturally curious to know.    CHAPTER FIVE.  CHARLEY WHITE.  One thought the stranger was a cabin passenger--another, an officer of the ship--another, a seaman; and Mary observed, that supposing he was a steerage passenger without a farthing in the world, it was equally our duty to take the best care we could of him.  \"I hope that he isn't quite a gentleman,\" said Susan, \"because, if he is, he'll be thinking himself above us.\"  \"Not if he has right feeling,\" remarked Mary.  \"I cannot see why we should fancy that people are always considering whether they are above or below each other, or better or worse than one another.  I know that the Bible tells us to consider each person better than ourselves, and, in another place, not to mind high things, but to condescend to men of low estate.  If people obeyed that rule, there wouldn't be the disputes and quarrels there are between neighbours.  I wonder if we shall find that sort of thing out in Australia.\"  \"I am afraid that a voyage half round the world won't change people's hearts,\" said I; \"the only difference is, that people have so much to do and think of, they have no time to attend to the private concerns of others; and so I hope that they keep on good terms at all events with their neighbours.\"  \"Do you think, father, that a voyage quite round the world, or twice round, would change a man's heart?\" asked John; \"I should think it ought.\"  \"No, John, I am very certain that it would not,\" remarked his mother, now first joining in the conversation; \"there is but one way by which a man's heart can change, and that is through God's Holy Spirit, to be obtained through His grace by earnest prayer.\"  My wife knew the truth, and showed that she did, not only by her words but by her life.  \"Well, sisters, to relieve your minds about the young stranger whom I hauled out of the water,\" said Peter; \"I'm pretty certain that he is a gentleman, judging by a few words he uttered as I caught hold of him. His first object seemed to be to thank me for the risk I was running to save him.  However, we shall see.\"  The young stranger recovered sufficiently to talk without risk before the gale was over, and he then told us that his name was Charles White, that he was fourth officer of the ship we had seen go down--a homeward bound Indiaman--that he was an orphan, with very few friends in England or anywhere else; \"Indeed,\" he added, \"had I shared the fate of my shipmates, there would have been but a small quantity of salt tears shed or crape worn for me; but I am wrong,--there is one who would have mourned for me; oh, if you knew her, such a good creature--Aunt Priscilla; she was my mother's aunt; she has never married; Miss Beamish she is called.  I believe that I am the only human male-being she cares for, except two tom cats and a dog, and one of them isn't a tom; at least, it had kittens, and they are not human either.  Whenever I go home, I always go and see Aunt Priscilla, and carry her all sorts of things, and feed the cats, and take the little dog out to walk; but when I went, I never intended to stay there long, because, you see, she and I are not much of companions to each other, and yet, somehow or other, what with telling her my adventures, and reading to her, and playing backgammon and such like things, we used to get on wonderfully well together.  Then my coming was always a signal for her to give a series of tea-parties; they were not very large ones, because her room wouldn't hold many people at a time, and then I used to have to tell my stories to each set of guests.  Aunt Priscilla was never tired of listening to them, and I found out by the way she corrected me if I made the slightest variation.  I had, therefore, to be very particular the first time I told a story, so that I might not afterwards be caught tripping. Yes; dear, good Aunt Priscilla, I am sure that she will be anxious when she finds that the old tea-chest hasn't arrived at the time expected. There's one comfort, I shall be able to give her notice of my safety before she hears positively of the fate of the ship.\"  Though Charley White did not talk of himself, I was able to form a very fair judgment of his character from the way he spoke of the old lady, and I found afterwards that I was correct.  We found him a very pleasant addition to our"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23050"],["title","Peter Biddulph: The Story of an Australian Settler (#6)"],["body","party on board, and I soon got to look on him like one of my own sons; he was, besides, of great assistance to us in navigating the little schooner.  The gale at length ceased, and we stood for Table Bay.  I was afraid of venturing the run across the Indian Ocean without landing at Cape Town, lest we might get short of water; a want, which besides exposing us to suffering, would have caused the destruction of all our sheep.  We remained but a few days at Cape Town. Charley White wrote home an account of the loss of the ship, and sent a letter to his Aunt Priscilla assuring her of his safety.  I expected, and thought of it with much regret, that he would here leave us.  I invited him, however, to cast in his fortunes with ours, and without hesitation, much to the satisfaction of all our party, he accepted my offer.  \"You know,\" he said, \"when we get settled, I can send home for Aunt Priscilla, or go and fetch her, and I think that she would like the life.  It would be much more satisfactory than her round of tea-parties, and give her something to think of besides her cats and dog, and I am sure that you would all like her.\"  We of course said that we had no doubt we should, though Susan remarked afterwards, that a real lady, as she supposed she was, from her giving tea-parties and having two cats and a poodle, would scarcely like to come out and live in the bush with such homely people as we were.  I will tell you by and by what came of it.  The people at the Cape, when they saw the size of the _May Flower_ and the way she was laden, were surprised at our having come so far in safety, and some chose to declare that we should never reach the end of our voyage.  I replied that they did not know the qualities of the little craft; that many a big ship had gone down when small ones had floated; that it was not so much the size of a vessel as the way she was put together, and the quality of her gear, which made her safe or unsafe, and moreover, that the same Providence which had protected us hitherto was not sleeping.  That was the feeling which kept me up from first to last throughout our undertaking.  We heard at the Cape some news which gave me more concern than anything else.  It was, that war was again about to break out between England and France, and that as many other nations were likely to be leagued with France in arms against our country, we should have no small number of enemies among whom to run the gauntlet.  My chief hope was that we should arrive at our destination before the news of the actual commencement of hostilities could reach the enemy's cruisers in the Eastern seas.  One thing, however, I remembered; it was, that bad news travels fast, and I have come to the conclusion that no news is worse than that which tells of two civilised nations going to war.  Earthquakes, fires, floods, disasters at sea, are very bad; but war means that thousands of the flowers of manhood are to be cut down in their prime, or maimed, or wounded; that numbers of children are to be made orphans; wives are to become widows; and fruitful lands laid desolate.  Such is war; ah! such is war.  I had made up my mind to go on to Australia, though I had many tempting offers to remain at the Cape.  I daresay that we should have found a happy home there, and it is a fine colony; but I have reason to be thankful that we persevered.  My children enjoyed their visit to the shore, and the fresh bread and butter, and the fruit and vegetables; but after all, they said that there was nothing like home (meaning the little schooner), and they were glad to get back to her, thus showing that they were not tired of the voyage.  Our old dog, Steadfast, made himself particularly happy, frisking and scampering about in every conceivable manner, till he looked, the children said, as if he would tumble to pieces in the exuberance of his spirits.  They tried to induce our cat, the Duchess, to accompany them, but she had learned to look on the schooner as her home and wouldn't go.  Whenever they tried to catch her, she ran up the rigging, though on other occasions she allowed them to handle her as much as they liked.  Curious as it may seem, the circumstance had a great effect on Bob Hunt and Dick Nailor, who were, like many seamen, very superstitious.  \"She knows it's all right aboard here, and that we shan't come to no harm,\" observed Bob to his mate.  \"Oh, course,\" answered Dick; \"I never knowed a cat stick to a ship, if she could get away, which was to go down.  They are wonderful wise creatures, and knows all sorts of things as is going to happen.  To be sure they can scratch a bit when they fancies.\"  Cats will certainly stick to vessels whether they are to be wrecked or not.  I remember falling in with an abandoned ship, the only living thing on board being a cat; we took her off, and the vessel soon afterwards went to pieces.  Once more we were at sea.  A westerly wind, which I was afraid we might lose if we stood to the southward, induced me to run along the coast closer in than I might otherwise have ventured.  The weather had hitherto been very fine, and I persuaded myself that there was no risk. I was wrong.  Suddenly, the wind shifted to the southwest of west, and blowing strong, and though we hauled up immediately, before we got a good offing it blew a strong gale from the southward directly on shore, and a heavy rolling sea came tumbling in.  We could not venture to heave to, and yet there was more sea and wind than the little craft could well bear.  All we could do was to keep sail on her, and to steer as close to the wind as she would lie.  I watched the coast with deep anxiety, and couldn't help feeling that the foaming, raging waters, which now dashed impetuously against it, might prove my grave and that of all dear to me.  Of course my son and Charley White and the two seamen saw our danger as clearly as I did, but we did not communicate our ideas to each other, and I was anxious not to alarm my dear wife and daughters.  The little craft looked up bravely however, and my hopes revived; again they sank, for the gale came down stronger than ever on us, and I saw that we were driving closer and closer towards the shore.  A large ship might possibly, by cutting away her masts have ridden out the gale at her anchors; we, had we made the attempt, should have foundered.  My wife and Mary and Susan had one after the other appeared at the companion hatch, and with pale faces, as they saw the state of things, had gone below again.  I hadn't the heart even to tell them my fears.  Bob Hunt and Dick Nailor took matters very coolly.  \"The Duchess don't think anything will come of it,\" observed Bob to Dick, pointing to the cat who was sitting on a coil of rope on the head of a water cask lashed to the weather bulwarks.  \"May be not, but she may be mistaken once in a way, Bob,\" answered Dick, who, seeing the imminent danger in which we were placed, lost his confidence in the fore-knowledge of the cat.  From what may sound ridiculous, but was not really so, I must turn to a more serious matter.  I suspected that my wife and daughters knew our danger, though I had not told them of it.  We had driven still nearer to the land, and wishing to ascertain exactly on what part of the coast we were, that I might, if possible, run the vessel on shore on some spot where we might have a chance of saving our lives I went below to examine the chart.    CHAPTER SIX.  IN SMOOTH WATER.  The cabin was very dark, from the skylight being covered over and battened down.  The schooner was however so tight and strong, that provided the hatches were on, I knew that she might almost roll over and over, and yet not fill.  This gave me great confidence as long as we kept to the open sea; but driven on rocks or quicksands, with such a gale as was then blowing, there could have been no hope for the stoutest ship that ever floated on the salt ocean.  As I was saying, I went into the cabin; although gloomy enough on deck, it was still darker below; for the gleam of light which came down the companion-hatch scarcely found its way beyond the foot of the ladder.  I looked about me, and at first thought that my wife and daughters had, in their terror, turned into their berths; but soon, amid the creaking of the bulkheads, and the rattling of the rigging, and the roaring of the storm, a gentle, sweet voice reached my ears.  It was that of my daughter Susan.  She had not heard me enter.  She was on her knees praying, so were her mother and sisters, all round the table in the cabin.  She was lifting up her voice to our loving, merciful Father in Heaven;--to the same God who stilled the raging of the storm on Gennesaret, and said to the sea, \"Peace, be still.\"  She was praying, dear girl, for me especially, that I might be preserved, even though the vessel were dashed to pieces; but, that if it was His will, that the schooner and all on board might be saved.  I cannot tell you how much confidence the prayer of that dear child gave me; I am sure--I was then sure--that God hears such prayers.  The rest of the family too had been praying; they were not prayers forced out by fear, but just such trusting, hopeful prayers as God loves to honour.  I stood for a few moments till Susan ceased, and when she did, I uttered a low \"Amen.\"  The dear ones heard me, and looked up, but did not rise from their knees; indeed, the vessel was tumbling about so much, that it was with difficulty they could hold on.  I told them what I was come down for, and striking a light, I took down my chart from the beckets in which it hung, and spread it out on the table.  I anxiously marked down the position in which, by my calculations, I believed the schooner then was.  A league or more to the eastward there was, I found, an island with a bay inside it, affording anchorage for small vessels.  For a large ship it would have been utterly useless.  Here, again, was an advantage which my humble little schooner"]]]
