It is the column of Trajan. I'll prove it to you.\"  So Rollo asked a gentleman, who was standing on the sidewalk with a Murray's Guide Book in his hand, and who Rollo knew, by that circumstance, was an English or American visitor, if that was not the column of Trajan.  \"No,\" said the gentleman; \"it is the column of Antonine.\"  Rollo looked somewhat abashed at receiving this answer, which turned his attempt to show off his learning to Charles into a ridiculous failure.  \"I thought it was called the column of Trajan,\" said he.  The gentleman, who, as it happened, was an Englishman, made no reply to this observation, but quietly took out an opera glass from a case, which was strapped over his shoulder, and began studying the sculptures on the column.  So Rollo and Charles walked away.  \"I believe the name of it is the column of Trajan,\" said Rollo, \"for I saw the name of it on the model at the hotel. That man has just come, and he don't know.\"  \"Are you sure it is the same column?\" suggested Charles.  \"Yes,\" said Rollo, \"for it was exactly of that shape, and it had the same spiral line of images going round and round it, and a statue on the top. See, how old and venerable it looks! It was built almost two thousand years ago.\"  \"What did they build it for?\" asked Charles.  \"Why, I don't know exactly,\" said Rollo, looking a little puzzled; \"for ornament, I suppose.\"  \"But I don't see much ornament,\" said Charles, \"in a big column standing all by itself, and with nothing for it to keep up.\"  \"But it _has_ something to keep up,\" rejoined Rollo. \"Don't you see, there is a statue on the top of it.\"  \"If that's what it is to keep up,\" said Charles, \"I don't see any sense in making the column so tall as to hold up the statue so high that we can't see it.\"  \"Nor I,\" said Rollo, \"but they often made tall columns, like these, in ancient times.\"  After rambling about a short time longer, the boys came to another open space, where there was a second column very similar in appearance to the first.  \"Ah!\" said Rollo, \"perhaps this is the column of Trajan.\"  Rollo was right this time. There are several large columns standing among the ruins of Rome, and among them are two with spiral lines of sculpture around them, which are extremely similar to each other, and it is not at all surprising that Rollo was at first deceived by the resemblance between them.  These columns were built in honor of the victories of great generals, and the spiral lines of sculptures were representations of their different exploits. The statue upon the top of the column was, originally, that of the man in whose honor the column was erected. But in the case of the Roman columns, these original statues have been taken down, and replaced by bronze images of saints, or of the Virgin Mary.  Near the column of Trajan was a large sunken space, in the middle of the square, with a railing around it. In the bottom of this sunken space was a pavement, which looked very old, and rising from it were rows of columns with the tops broken off. The old pavement was eight or ten feet below the level of the street.  \"This must be some old ruin or other,\" said Rollo; \"a temple perhaps.\"  \"Only I do not see,\" said Charles, \"why they built their temples down so low.\"  \"Nor do I,\" said Rollo.  \"But, Rollo,\" said Charles, \"I think it is time for us to begin to try to find our way home. I don't see how you are going to find the way at all.\"  \"If I only knew the name of the hotel, or even the name of the street,\" said Rollo, \"I should know at once what to do.\"     CHAPTER V.  GETTING LOST.   \"And now,\" said Rollo, \"the first thing is to find somebody that can speak French or English, for us to inquire of.\"  \"What good will that do?\" asked Charles, \"as long as we don't know what to ask them for?\"  \"True,\" said Rollo. \"That's a real difficulty. I wish we just knew the name of the hotel. At any rate, we will walk along until we find a carriage, and I will be thinking what we had better do.\"  The boys walked along together. Charles kept silence, so as not to interrupt Rollo in his thinking.  \"All I know,\" said Rollo, after a short pause, \"is, that the long, straight street that we came through, is the Corso. I have heard of that street before. If we could only find our way to the Corso, I believe that I could follow it along, and at last find the mosaic shop, and so get back to our hotel.\"  \"Very well,\" said Charles, \"let us try.\"  \"Or, we might get into a carriage,\" said Rollo, \"and direct the coachman which way to drive by pointing.\"  \"So we could,\" said Charles. \"And I should like that, for I am tired of walking so much.\"  \"Then we will get a carriage,\" said Rollo. \"We will take the first one that we see. You shall get inside, and I will mount upon the box with the coachman, and show him which way to go.\"  \"No,\" said Charles, \"we will both get inside, for we can stand up there and point.\"  \"So we can,\" said Rollo.  There are carriages to be found almost every where in the streets of Rome, especially in the neighborhood of the most interesting ruins. It was not long before Rollo and Charles came in sight of one. The coachman was looking toward them, and was cracking his whip to attract their attention.  Rollo and Charles walked directly towards the spot, and Rollo, taking out his watch, and showing the coachman what o'clock it was, said,--  \"_Per hora._\"  This was to notify the coachman that he took the carriage by the hour.  \"_Si, signore_,\" said the coachman; and then Rollo and Charles got in.  The carriage was entirely open,--the top being turned back,--so that it afforded an uninterrupted view in every direction; and also, by standing up and pointing forward, the boys could easily indicate to the coachman which way they wished him to drive. Rollo, however, in the first instance, directed him in words to drive to the Corso.  \"_Si, signore_,\" said the coachman; and so he drove on.  The boys sat in the carriage, or stood up to look back at the various objects of interest that attracted them as they passed. The scenes through which the driver took them seemed very strange. Every thing in Rome was strange to them, and their course now lay through a part of the city which they had not been in before. Their attention was continually attracted first upon this side of the carriage and then upon the other, as they rode along; and they pointed out to each other the remarkable objects they were passing.  The driver meanwhile upon his seat drove on, entirely indifferent to it all. The scenes that were so new to the boys, were perfectly familiar to him.  [Illustration: RIDING AMONG THE RUINS.]  He soon entered a region of dark, crooked, and winding alleys, where Rollo said that he and Charles could never have found their way, if they had undertaken it alone. They frequently passed portions of old ruins. In some places these ruins consisted of columns standing alone, or immense fragments of broken arches that had fallen down, and now lay neglected upon the ground. In other places, the remains of ancient temples stood built in with the houses of the street, with market women at their stalls below, forming a strange and incongruous spectacle of ancient magnificence and splendor, surrounded and overwhelmed with modern poverty and degradation. As the carriage drove through these places, Rollo and Charles stood up in it, supporting themselves by pressing their knees against the front seat, and holding on to each other. They stood up thus partly to be enabled to see better, and partly so as to be ready to point out the way as soon as they should enter the Corso.  It was not long before they came to the Corso. The coachman then looked round, as if to inquire of the boys what he was to do next.  \"Go right on,\" said Rollo; and so saying, he stood up in the carriage, and pointed forward. The coachman, of course, did not understand the words, but the gesture was significant enough, and so he drove on.  \"Now watch, Charley, sharp,\" said Rollo; \"and when you see the street that you think is the one where we came into the Corso, tell me.\"  So the boys drove on through the Corso, standing up all the time in the middle of the carriage, and looking about them in a very eager manner.  They went on in this way for some time, but they could not identify any of the branch streets as the one by which they had come into the Corso.  \"Never mind,\" said Rollo; \"we will turn off into any of these streets, and perhaps we shall come upon the hotel. We will take the streets that look most like it, and at any rate, we shall have a good ride, and see the city of Rome.\"  Rollo accordingly pointed to a side street when he wished the coachman to turn. The coachman said, \"_Si, signore_,\" and immediately went in that direction. As he advanced in the new street, the boys looked about on all sides to see if they could recognize any signs of their approach to their hotel.  After going on a little way, and seeing nothing that looked at all familiar, Rollo made signs to the coachman to turn down another street, which he thought looked promising. The coachman did as he was directed, wondering a little, however, at the strange demeanor of the boys; and feeling somewhat curious to know where they wanted to go. He, however, felt comparatively little interest in the question, after all; for, as he was paid by the hour, it was of no consequence to him where they directed him to drive.  Rollo now perceived that Charles began to be somewhat anxious in respect to the situation they were in, and so he tried in every way to encourage him, and to amuse his mind.  \"I'll tell you what we will do,\" said Rollo. \"This street that we are in now seems to be a good long one, and we will drive through the whole length of it, and you shall look down all the streets that open into it on the right hand, and I will on the left; and if we see any thing that looks like our "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23433"],["title","The Kitten's Garden of Verses (#0)"],["body","at http://www.pgdp.net (This file was produced from images generously made available by The Internet Archive/American Libraries.)

In Summer quite the other way,         I find it very hot all day,     But Human People do not care,         For they have nice thin clothes to wear.      And does it not seem hard to you,         When all the world is like a stew,     And I am much too warm to purr,         I have to wear my Winter Fur?     [Illustration]  Rain       The rain is raining everywhere,         Kittens to shelter fly--     But Human Folk wear overshoes,         To keep their hind paws dry.     [Illustration]  The Shadow Kitten       There's a funny little kitten that tries to look like me,         But though I'm round and fluffy, he's as flat as flat can be;     And when I try to mew to him he never makes a sound,         And when I jump into the air he never leaves the ground.      He has a way of growing, I don't understand at all.         Sometimes he's very little and sometimes he's very tall.     And once when in the garden when the sun came up at dawn         He grew so big I think he stretched half-way across the lawn.     [Illustration]  Education       When People think that Kittens play,        It's really quite the other way.     For when they chase the Ball or Bobbin        They learn to catch a Mouse or Robin.      The Kitten, deaf to Duty's call,        Who will not chase the bounding ball,     A hungry Cathood will enjoy,        The scorn of Mouse and Bird and Boy.     [Illustration]  A Thought       It's very nice to think of how     In every country lives a Cow     To furnish milk with all her might     For Kittens' comfort and delight.     [Illustration]  The Lion       The Lion does not move at all,         Winter or Summer, Spring or Fall,     He does not even stretch or yawn,         But lies in silence on the lawn.      He must be lazy it is plain,         For there is moss upon his mane,     And what is more, a pair of Daws         Have built a nest between his paws.      Oh, Lazy Lion, big and brown,         This is no time for lying down!     The Sun is shining, can't you see?         Oh, please wake up and play with me.     [Illustration]  The Milk Jug       The Gentle Milk Jug blue and white         I love with all my soul,     She pours herself with all her might         To fill my breakfast bowl.      All day she sits upon the shelf,         She does not jump or climb--     She only waits to pour herself         When 'tis my supper-time.      And when the Jug is empty quite,         I shall not mew in vain,     The Friendly Cow, all red and white,         Will fill her up again.     [Illustration]  Happy Thought       The world is so full of a number of Mice     I'm sure that we all should be happy and nice.     [Illustration]  Kitten's Night Thought       When Human Folk put out the light,        And think they've made it dark as night,     A Pussy Cat sees every bit        As well as when the lights are lit.      When Human Folk have gone upstairs,        And shed their skins and said their prayers,     And there is no one to annoy,        Then Pussy may her life enjoy.      No Human hands to pinch or slap,        Or rub her fur against the nap,     Or throw cold water from a pail,        Or make a handle of her tail.      And so you will not think it wrong        When she can play the whole night long,     With no one to disturb her play,        That Pussy goes to bed by day.     [Illustration]  The Puncture       When I was just a Kitten small,         They gave to me a Rubber Ball     To roll upon the floor.         One day I tapped it with my paw     And pierced the rubber with my claw;         Now it will roll no more.     [Illustration]  Good and Bad Kittens       Kittens, you are very little,         And your kitten bones are brittle,     If you'd grow to Cats respected,         See your play be not neglected.      Smite the Sudden Spool, and spring         Upon the Swift Elusive String,     Thus you learn to catch the wary         Mister Mouse or Miss Canary.      That is how in Foreign Places         Fluffy Cubs with Kitten faces,     Where the mango waves sedately,         Grow to Lions large and stately.      But the Kittencats who snatch         Rudely for their food, or scratch,     Grow to Tomcats gaunt and gory,--         Theirs is quite another story.      Cats like these are put away         By the dread S. P. C. A.,     Or to trusting Aunts and Sisters         Sold as Sable Muffs and Wristers.     [Illustration]     [Illustration]  Anticipation       When I grow up I mean to be     A Lion large and fierce to see.     I'll mew so loud that Cook in fright     Will give me all the cream in sight.     And anyone who dares to say     \"Poor Puss\" to me will rue the day.     Then having swallowed him I'll creep     Into the Guest Room Bed to sleep.     [Illustration]  Foreign Kittens       Kittens large and Kittens small,     Prowling on the Back Yard Wall,     Though your fur be rough and few,     I should like to play with you.     Though you roam the dangerous street,     And have curious things to eat,     Though you sleep in barn or loft,     With no cushions warm and soft,     Though you have to stay out-doors     When it's cold or when it pours,     Though your fur is all askew--     How I'd like to play with you!     [Illustration]  The Joy Ride       When Mistress Peggy moves around,         Her dresses make a mocking sound.     \"You can't catch me!\" they seem to say--         I often steal a ride that way.     [Illustration]  Facilis Ascensus       Up into the Cherry Tree,         Who should climb but little me,     With both my Paws I hold on tight,         And look upon a pleasant sight.      There are the Gardens far away,         Where little Foreign Kittens play,     And those queer specks of black and brown         Are naughty cats that live in Town.      And there among the tulips red,         Where I may never lay my head,     I see the Cruel Gardener hoe         The baby weeds that may not grow.      Now I climb down--\"Oh dear,\"--I mew,         \"Which end goes first--what shall I do?     Oh, good Kind Gardener, big and brown,         Please come and help this Kitten down.\"     [Illustration]  The Whole Duty of Kittens       When Human Folk at Table eat,        A Kitten must not mew for meat,     Or jump to grab it from the Dish,        (_Unless it happens to be fish_).     [Illustration]  The Outing       My Bed is like a little Bark,        The hatch is battened down,     And in the basket cabin dark        I sail away from Town.      Now, when they lift the lid, a scene        Of wonder meets my eyes,     Tall waving Feather-Dusters green,        That seem to touch the skies.      And over all the Ground is spread        A Rug of Emerald sweet,     Most deep enough to hide my head        And tickly to my feet.      And here's the Cow, calm-eyed stands she,        The Genie of the Jug,     Beneath the Feather-Duster Tree,        And eats the Emerald Rug.     [Illustration]  The Puppy       The Puppy cannot mew or talk,         He has a funny kind of walk,     His tail is difficult to wag         And that's what makes him walk zigzag.      He is the Kitten of a Dog,         From morn till night he's all agog--     Forever seeking something new         That's good but isn't meant to chew.      He romps about the Tulip bed,         And chews the Flowers white and red,     And when the Gardener comes to see         He's sure to blame mamma or me.      One game that cannot ever fail         To please him is to chase his tail--    "]]]
