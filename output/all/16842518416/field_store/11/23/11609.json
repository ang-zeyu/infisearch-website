Harry's hand trembled a trifle in spite of his effort at self-control.  His first effort was unsuccessful.  \"Careful, Harry,\" admonished Ned.  \"Better strike it on your shoe sole. That makes a better match scratcher than your trousers.\"  \"Correct!\" observed Jack.  \"And go easy,\" he added.  \"We have only two, you know.  If anything should happen, you understand--\"  \"Yes, I know,\" answered Harry.  \"That's why I'm trying to be extra careful.  I'm just as anxious for a light as you are.\"  \"The rats are coming closer,\" observed Jack, a slight quaver perceptible in his voice.  \"I don't want them to start anything.\"  \"All right now, Harry; lean on me a bit to balance yourself,\" urged Ned.  \"Make sure this time, and get it in your cupped hands.\"  \"Here goes!\" announced Harry, lifting one foot and striking the match upon the sole of his shoe.  \"Here comes the light!\"  But, contrary to expectations, the light did not come, although the lad tried again and again.  \"Try the other match, Harry; maybe this one got wet somehow and won't work,\" suggested Jack, stepping closer.  \"I have tried them both,\" declared Harry in a faint voice.  \"What's the matter, then?\" demanded Jack excitedly.  \"I guess they are those safety matches that will light only on the box,\" was Harry's explanation.  \"I haven't the box, either,\" he added in a voice scarcely above a whisper.  \"It's no go, boys!\"  \"Look through all your pockets,\" directed Ned, \"and see if there isn't a scrap of box left by oversight.  We must have a light!\"  Frantically the three boys searched their pockets, but could discover no shred or vestige of a box on which to strike the impregnated safety matches held by Harry.  At length they gave up the effort.  \"That's peculiar!\" declared Jack with emphasis.  \"Just think of all the matches used every day in the United States by thousands and thousands of people who never think of saving them.  We have used a whole lot of matches ourselves needlessly, and now we want just one as badly as we ever wanted anything.  It's fierce!\"  \"It surely is fierce,\" agreed Ned, \"but we'll have to make the best of it.  It seems peculiar, too,\" he went on, \"that the rats haven't begun anything.  They seem to be all about us.\"  \"Yes, but they are not moving about very fast,\" observed Harry.  \"Maybe they 're afraid of us yet.  Let's make a noise and scare them.\"  \"How shall we do it?\" asked Jack.  \"What will you make a noise with if you haven't anything to use?  Tell me that!\"  \"Stamp on the floor good and hard; that'll scare them.\"  \"All right; here goes!\" agreed Jack, suiting the action to the word.  All three boys were startled at the result of Jack's stamping.  A crackling sound was heard, followed by a tiny spurt of flame from the floor under his foot.  \"Easy there, easy!\" cried Harry, dropping to his knees.  \"That's just what we wanted.  Don't move now, but give me those shavings!\"  With trembling hands the lad took the shavings from Jack's hand. Carefully shielding the tiny flame from possible draughts of air, the boy held the point of one of the thin pieces of wood over the flare. In a moment it had caught fire.  Licking up the curl, the flame gradually leaped from one piece of wood to another until the entire handful was ablaze.  The dancing light played upon the three faces and sent a glow out into the surrounding blackness.  Harry deposited the burning shavings upon the floor, where the fire was soon transmitted to the larger piece of wood Jack had used in whittling.  As the boys saw that the matter of fire was assured, they glanced first at each other, then let their gaze wander about the apartment.  \"Goodness, the rats don't seem to be much afraid of fire!\" exclaimed Jack, pointing toward a horde of rodents swarming about the place.  \"What's that on them?\" asked Harry wonderingly.  \"I declare it's red!\" exclaimed Ned.  \"It looks like blood!\"  \"Where'd they get blood from, I'd like to know!\" protested Harry.  \"There's only one answer to that just now, with all the dead and wounded soldiers about,\" answered Ned, shaking his head.  \"It's awful!\"  \"Let's get out of here as quick as we can,\" urged Jack.  \"Come on.\"  With one accord the lads turned from the swarm of rats.  \"Where are you going?\" demanded a strange voice from the darkness.  \"Who are you?\" asked Ned, startled by the sudden question.  \"Maybe I'm a friend,\" was the answer.  \"Yes, I guess I am.\"     CHAPTER III  OUT OF THE FLAMES  When the soldier who had been holding his rifle at Jimmie's back lowered the weapon and the ceremony of administering the oath of allegiance to the Kaiser had been completed, the red-headed Boy Scout who had been masquerading under a Cossack uniform breathed a deep sigh of relief that but faintly expressed his sentiments.  In spite of the seriousness of the situation, Jimmie maintained a mental reservation that little less than contradicted his words so recently spoken.  He felt that it would be only policy to obey the orders of those in superior force, since he could see no advantage to be gained by a flat refusal.  His thoughts rapidly compassed the situation, and he recognized the fact that the invading horde of Germans were in no mood to consider dispassionately the matter of a boy more or less who was found under the circumstances in which they had discovered Jimmie.  Reluctantly, therefore, but because he thought it by far the better plan, the lad had submitted to the course insisted upon.  During all the time that he had been repeating the words after the officer the boy had been mentally conjecturing a means of escape whereby he might rejoin his chums and be fairly sure of the escape of the entire party from the hands of the army that had so recently captured Peremysl and who were now engaged in bringing order out of the apparent chaos that reigned.  Not until the searching party returned and reported to the Captain their unsuccessful quest after his three comrades did Jimmie realize that an effort was being made to apprehend them.  Then he began to believe that it was not the intention of the German Captain to allow the boys to leave the country.  The thought was a very disquieting one.  In entertaining it, Jimmie felt himself fully justified in taking any possible course of escape.  \"Well, my lad,\" began the Captain, addressing Jimmie in a not unkindly tone, the while his blue eyes regarded the lad with an amused glance, \"now that you are a full-fledged Uhlan and your comrades are on their way home, you will be fitted out with a new uniform by the proper department.  See that you select a good strong one, for we have plenty of rough work ahead of us.  Yes?\"  \"Very good, sir!\" replied Jimmie with outward politeness, although his heart was filled with rage at the thought of donning the German uniform.  \"I shall try to do well whatever I undertake.\"  \"Spoken like a man!\" declared the officer with a short laugh.  A brief order spoken in the German language to an orderly nearby resulted in that individual signing to Jimmie.  Obediently the lad followed his new guide.  Past groups of soldiers who were, by their fair hair, round cheeks, blue eyes and general stocky build, members of the German army, the boy and his conductor took their way.  Not far down the street they came upon several wagons in charge of a commissioned officer, before whom the guide stopped with a very formal salute.  After receiving a recognition of his salute the guide explained his errand.  A laughing response greeted his explanation of circumstances.  The officer called one of his aides, and the work of outfitting the erstwhile Cossack began.  Jimmie discovered that the wagons were veritable stores on wheels, and was greatly surprised at the neatness and order with which the large assortment of goods were disposed.  No difficulty was experienced in securing clothing of the proper dimensions, and Jimmie soon stood forth to all external appearances as loyal and brave a Uhlan as ever followed the banner of the Emperor or stuck a lance into a dummy at riding exercise.  He could not restrain a laugh at the peculiar round cap that was fitted to his head.  \"Now I'm hungry!\" he declared as he surveyed himself in his new regalia.  \"Where's the eats?\" he asked of the guide.  A stare from a pair of pale blue eyes was the only response.  \"I say,\" began Jimmie in a louder tone, \"I haven't had anything to eat for a long time.  I'm hungry!\" he finished in a shout.  Another stare and a nod of the head greeted this outburst.  \"Aw, come off!\" was Jimmied disgusted sally.  \"Where are your ears? Wake up!  It's six bells and the cook has struck.  Here--\"  Seizing the guide by the sleeve, Jimmie shook his finger under the other's nose for attention.  Then he repeated his old-time universal sign language denoting hunger.  The guide followed with great interest Jimmie's motion of pointing into his open mouth and gazed delightedly at the patting of the stomach. Apparently, however, he could discover nothing amiss with the belt buckle or any of the accoutrements that adorned the person of the new-found recruit.  He shook his head in a negative way.  \"Oh, you mutton-head!\" scorned Jimmie.  Then, recalling the few words of German he had learned in haphazard fashion, he began again, pausing between each word to give emphasis to his request.  \"Ach, Ich say, old scout,\" he stated, \"Ich would like some brodt haben, und sauer kraut, und wiener wurst, and kaffee, and pumpernickel, und kaffekuchen, und Kolbfleisch, und--oh, whatever you have handy.\"  A smile slowly spread over the face of the guide as he began to comprehend Jimmie's meaning.  He nodded vigorously.  \"And I say, dumbhead, Heute Ganse Braten!\" Jimmie added vigorously. \"There!\" he declared in an undertone, \"I know I saw that sign in Dick Stein's restaurant on the north side in Chicago one time when I was there, and I asked the man what it meant.  He said"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22991"],["title","Boy Scouts Mysterious Signal; Or, Perils of the Black Bear Patrol (#3)"],["body","was German for 'We have roast goose to-day,' and I'd like a little of that, too.\"  \"So-o,\" drawled the guide.  \"Und you haf been by Stein's restaurant? Yes?  Vell, I vas waiter dere for two, tree year.  It is a nice blace.\"  \"You rascal!\" shouted Jimmie.  \"You understood me all the time.  Why didn't you let me know you understood English at first?\"  \"Maype I didn't understand,\" the other stated simply.  \"Maybe you didn't, and again maybe you did,\" retorted the lad rather tartly.  \"If you keep on playing your monkey shines on me, you'll get me sore pretty soon, and I'll be tempted to cloud up and rain all over you.  And there'll be considerable dunder und blitzen along with the cyclonic disturbance in the atmosphere,\" he added.  \"All right,\" was the calm response.  \"You iss hungry.  Maybe you vant someding to eat.  Yes?  Or maybe not?\"  \"Great frozen hot boxes!\" cried Jimmie in a despairing tone.  \"I don't see how, with all the scarcity of ivory in the market, the billiard ball makers let you roam about at large so long.  Why,\" he added with rising indignation, \"you're giving the exact symptoms of a chap who is ossified from the shoulders to the sky!  Of course I want to eat, and I'd be de-lighted to perform that simple operation now.\"  \"But to eat before mess, it is verboten,\" declared the guide.  \"Say,\" retorted Jimmie, \"just let me have your name and the address of any relatives you want notified in case of accident.  Something is going to blow up pretty soon, and when the explosion is over they'll go around with a sponge to gather up the pieces of the innocent bystanders.  Among those present was a former waiter at Dick Stein's.\"  \"Ach, yes,\" slowly replied the other.  \"My name iss Otto von Freundlich.  In America I am called Friendly Otto.  It iss so in der telephone book.  Names iss backwards put down.\"  \"Well, if you'll just be good enough to get me one of those nice large German pancakes that we used to get at Stein's, with a couple of cups of coffee and a little 'T' bone steak well done, with some fried potatoes and a side order of cauliflower in cream, some cold slaw, a little lettuce, some lentils, and a small platter of sauer kraut, I'll try to worry along until mess time.  Can't we eat at all?\"  \"No, not all of dot,\" soberly responded Otto seriously, evidently believing that Jimmie intended to eat everything he had mentioned.  \"Then for pity's sake tell me what I can have.  I'm getting so hungry I could almost eat the wheels off this wagon.\"  \"Maybe a little soup und some rye bread?\" replied Otto inquiringly.  \"That listens good to your Uncle Dudley,\" was Jimmie's response in a somewhat mollified tone.  \"Lead me to it and I'll do the rest.\"  \"Come,\" directed Otto, starting away and beckoning the lad to follow. \"Come; der cook maybe has something good for hungry soldiers.\"  Jimmie followed with much interest, taking note of everything as he went along.  Here he saw a group of soldiers resting after some evidently heavy work.  There another group were arranging their accoutrements and polishing their weapons as they rested in the shade of a broken wall that had withstood the heavy hammering of the immense German guns during the days of bombardment of the city.  Wagons were drawn up along the side of the street, gasoline trucks were darting hither and thither on various errands, while small groups of horsemen were constantly passing to and fro about the town.  Everywhere was activity, indicating to Jimmie that not only were the Germans investing the city and preparing it for their occupation, but that other preparations were under way.  This could only mean to the lad that the commander of the invading forces was preparing to press the advantage he had gained by following the Russian army he had driven from Peremysl and attempt to administer a crushing blow.  \"What is all this bustle about, Otto?\" he asked presently.  \"Ach, I know not,\" was the reply.  \"Und if I should know, it is verboten that I should say.  You will discover in good time.\"  \"That's all right, but I'll bet my last year's hat that you know pretty well what's going on if you'd only talk a bit.\"  \"That is perhaps so and perhaps not so,\" replied Otto.  \"All right; I vote yes on the amendment,\" persisted Jimmie, feeling that by a little maneuvering he could learn something from his guide. \"From what the Captain said while we were in the house and you were on the street, I understand that your regiment will be one of the first to be tolled off to pursue the Russians.  Maybe he'll send me with them. I do hope so, for that will give me a chance to get a whack at them in payment for the hard treatment I received.\"  \"Ach, nein!\" protested Otto, evidently endeavoring to set Jimmie right. \"My regiment is to return.  We have done our work here.\"  \"I thought so all the time,\" muttered Jimmie.  \"You may have been in America a while, but you haven't got wise to the great game of 'bluff' the Americans pull off once in a while.  You're easy.\"  \"What is dot?\" inquired Otto.  \"I did not hear what you say.\"  \"I say,\" replied Jimmie in a louder tone, \"I'm hungry.  I want something to eat, and I'm curious to know what is in that bundle you are carrying so carefully.  Is it dynamite or something?\"  \"Nein; it is the Russian Cossack uniform you wore.  I shall burn it when we arrive at the kitchen you see ahead of us.\"  \"Oh, so you don't like Cossack uniforms any better than I do.\"  \"It is orders,\" was the German's simple statement.  \"Well, here we are at the cook's place,\" announced Jimmie as the two drew near a movable kitchen equipment in the street.  A few words addressed to the person in charge of the kitchen brought forth a smiling response.  In a moment Jimmie was supplied with a small dish of nourishing stew of cabbages and beans.  He devoured the contents of the dish with an appetite, and gladly accepted the cup of black unsweetened coffee that was tendered.  \"Thank you!  That was just like mother used to make!\" he said as he returned the empty dish and cup.  \"I'll see you again.\"  Jimmie stepped back a pace, preparing to follow Otto, presuming that he would lead the way to regimental headquarters.  As he glanced about in search of his guide he discovered the German stuffing the discarded Cossack uniform into the furnace underneath a huge kettle.  With a startled cry Jimmie grasped frantically at his breast.  Then he darted forward and snatched the clothing from the fire.     CHAPTER IV  BURIED ALIVE  \"Well, if you're a friend, step forward and let us see what you look like,\" challenged Ned, turning in the direction from whence the strange voice proceeded.  \"You needn't be afraid to show your face.\"  \"I'm not the one who is afraid,\" was the reply.  \"We're not afraid, if that's what you mean,\" retorted the lad.  A chuckle from the newcomer was the only response.  \"Are you coming forward?\" asked Ned in a rather impatient tone, for his experiences of the last few moments had been enough to cause him to be slightly irritable.  \"I'd like to see you.\"  As the lad spoke he peered eagerly toward the blackness surrounding himself and his chums.  Owing to the faintness of the flame from their small fire, the darkness lying about them like a dense pall was too great for his eyes to pierce.  Try as he might, he could not distinguish even the faintest outline of the stranger.  \"If you are afraid of the rats or the Germans you might step over this way and we'll go to a more convenient and pleasant place.  This isn't a cheerful spot,\" was the stranger's suggestion.  This invitation was received in silence by the three boys.  \"Of course,\" the other continued, \"if you prefer to remain here and talk it over with the rodents, I have no objections.\"  \"Perhaps we would rather take our own way out of here,\" Ned stated with little friendliness in his voice.  \"Perhaps,\" was the dry response from the utter darkness.  \"But,\" went on the stranger, \"you'd have a beautiful time doing it.  There's only one way out of this place except by the trap door through which you came.  Unless you're regular little derricks you can't move all that rubbish piled on top of the trap door, and you'd not be apt to discover the underground exit if you had the eyes of a hawk and an electric light plant besides.  Better come along.\"  Ned had not relaxed his clasp on the hands of his companions, and now drew them closer to him.  In a whisper he asked:  \"What do you think, boys?  Shall we do as he suggests?\"  \"Might as well,\" said Jack.  \"We can't be in much worse case than we are now, and those rats might get good and ugly when they get wise to our being here.  I move we follow him.\"  \"Second the motion, unless you've got a better suggestion,\" added Harry.  \"This place is getting on my nerves.  Let's go.\"  \"I rather feel as if we ought not to go with this fellow unless he's willing to show himself and let us get an idea who he is,\" Ned stated in a hesitating way.  \"Perhaps you boys are right, but I don't feel at all easy about it.  Maybe he's trying to get us into a trap.\"  \"That's so,\" agreed Harry.  \"At least if we remain where we are we'll be no worse off than we would have been without him.\"  \"You're right there,\" put in Jack, \"but on the other hand we're in a bad fix, and Jimmie's outside and needs us.  This fellow's coming may be just the chance for escape that we are wanting.  Suppose we follow him as he suggests and all the while remember our motto to 'Be Prepared.'  Wouldn't that be the proper course?\"  \"I guess you're right, Jack,\" Ned said with a sigh.  \"Perhaps I'm wrong about it.  I don't want to overlook a chance to help Jimmie and get back to America.  I'll withdraw my objections.\"  \"All right, then, let's get started.  Tell him so.\"  \"Are you there?\" Ned called out in a louder tone, addressing himself toward the place from which the stranger's voice had come.  \"I am for a minute,\" answered the other.  \"But I'm going now.  If you care to come with me I'll be glad to take you out of "]]]
