He had little respect for, and no fear of, his commander.  Indeed, to say truth, (for truth must be told, even though the character of our rugged friend should suffer,) Jo entertained a most profound belief in the immense advantage of muscular strength and vigour in general, and of his own prowess in particular.  Although not quite so gigantic a man as his captain, he was nearly so, and, being a bold self-reliant fellow, he felt persuaded in his own mind that he could thrash him, if need were.  In fact, Jo was convinced that there was no living creature under the sun, human or otherwise, that walked upon two legs, that he could not pommel to death with more or less ease by means of his fists alone.  And in this conviction he was not far wrong.  Yet it must not be supposed that Jo Bumpus was a boastful man or a bully. Far from it.  He was so thoroughly persuaded of his invincibility, that he felt there was no occasion to prove it.  He therefore followed the natural bent of his inclinations, which led him at all times to exhibit a mild, amiable, and gentle aspect--except, of course, when he was roused.  As occasion for being roused was not wanting in the South Seas in those days, Jo's amiability was frequently put to the test.  He sojourned, while there, in a condition of alternate calm and storm; but riotous joviality ran, like a rich vein, through all his chequered life, and lit up its most sombre phases like gleams of light on an April day.  \"You entered my service with your own consent,\" replied the captain to Jo's last remark, \"and you may leave it, with the same consent, whenever you choose; but you will please to remember that I did not engage you to serve on board the schooner.  Back there you do not go either with or without your consent, my fine fellow, and if you are bent on going to sea on your own account--you've got a pair of good arms and legs--you can swim!  Besides,\" continued the captain, dropping the tone of sarcasm in which this was said, and assuming a more careless and good-natured air, \"you were singing something not long since, if I mistake not, about `farewell to the rolling sea,' which leads me to think you will not object to a short cruise on shore for a change, especially on such a beautiful island as this is.\"  \"I'm your man, capting,\" cried the impulsive seaman, at the same time giving his oar a pull that well-nigh spun the boat round.  \"And, to say wots the plain truth, d'ye see, I'm not sorry to ha done with your schooner, for, although she is as tight a little craft as any man could wish for to go to sea in, I can't say much for the crew,--saving your presence, Dick\"--(he added, glancing over his shoulder at the surly-looking man who pulled the bow oar.) \"Of all the rascally set I ever clapped eyes on, they seems to me the worst.  If I didn't know you for a sandal-wood trader, I do believe I'd take ye for a pirate.\"  \"Don't speak ill of your messmates behind their backs, Jo,\" said the captain with a slight frown.  \"No good and true man ever does that.\"  \"No more I do,\" replied John Bumpus; while a deep red colour suffused his bronzed countenance.  \"No more I do; leastwise if they wos here I'd say it to their faces, for they're a set of as ill-tongued villains as I ever had the misfortune to--\"  \"Silence!\" exclaimed the captain, suddenly, in a voice of thunder.  Few men would have ventured to disobey the command given by such a man, but John Bumpus was one of those few.  He did indeed remain silent for two seconds, but it was the silence of astonishment.  \"Capting,\" said he, seriously, \"I don't mean no offence, but I'd have you to know that I engaged to work for you, not to hold my tongue at your bidding, d'ye see.  There aint the man living as'll make Jo Bumpus shut up w'en he's got a mind to--\"  The captain put an abrupt end to the remarks of his refractory seaman by starting up suddenly in fierce anger and seizing the tiller, apparently with the intent to fell him.  He checked himself, however, as suddenly, and, breaking into a loud laugh, cried--\"Come, Jo, you must admit that there is at least one living man who has made you `shut up' before you had finished what you'd got to say.\"  John Bumpus, who had thrown up his left arm to ward off the anticipated blow, and dropped his oar in order to clench his right fist, quietly resumed his oar, and shook his head gravely for nearly a minute, after which he made the following observation:--  \"Capting, I've seed, in my experience o' life, that there are some constitootions as don't agree with jokin'; an' yours is one on 'em. Now, if you'd take the advice of a plain man, you'd never try it on. You're a grave man by natur', and you're so bad at a joke that a feller can't quite tell w'en you're a-doin' of it.  See, now, I do declare I wos as near drivin' you right over the stern o' your own boat as could be, only by good luck I seed the twinkle in your eye in time.\"  \"Pull away, my lad,\" said the captain, in the softest tones of his deep voice, at the same time looking his reprover straight in the face.  There was something in the tone in which that simple command was given, and in the look by which it was accompanied; that effectually quelled John Bumpus in spite of himself.  Violence had no effect on John, because in most cases he was able to meet it with superior violence, and in all cases he was willing to try.  But to be put down in this mild way was perplexing.  The words were familiar, the look straightforward and common enough.  He could not understand it at all, and, being naturally of a philosophical turn of mind, he spent the next three minutes in a futile endeavour to analyse his own feelings.  Before he had come to any satisfactory conclusion on the subject, the boat's keel grated on the white sand of the shore.  Now, while all that we have been describing in the last and present chapters was going on, a very different series of events was taking place on the coral-island, for there, under the pleasant shade of the cocoa-nut palms, a tall, fair, and handsome youth was walking lightly down the green slopes towards the shore in anticipation of the arrival of the schooner, and a naked dark-skinned savage was dogging his steps, winding like a hideous snake among the bushes, and apparently seeking an opportunity to launch the short spear he carried in his hand at his unsuspecting victim.  As the youth and the savage descended the mountain-side together, the former frequently paused when an opening in the rich foliage peculiar to these beautiful isles enabled him to obtain a clear view of the magnificent bay and its fringing coral reef, on which the swell of the great Pacific--so calm and undulating out beyond--fell in tremendous breakers, with a long, low, solemn roar like distant thunder.  As yet no object broke the surface of the mirror-like bay within the reef.  Each time the youth paused the savage stopped also, and more than once he poised his deadly spear, while his glaring eyeballs shone amid the green foliage like those of a tiger.  Yet upon each occasion he exhibited signs of hesitation, and finally lowered the weapon, and crouched into the underwood.  To any one ignorant of the actors in this scene, the indecision, of the savage would have appeared unaccountable; for there could be no doubt of his desire to slay the fair youth--still less doubt of his ability to dart his formidable spear with precision.  Nevertheless, there was good reason for his hesitating, for young Henry Stuart was well known, alike by settlers and savages, as possessing the swiftest foot, the strongest arm, and the boldest heart in the island, and Keona was not celebrated for the possession of these qualities in any degree above the average of his fellows, although he did undoubtedly exceed them in revenge, hatred, and the like.  On one occasion young Stuart had, while defending his mother's house against an attack of the savages, felled Keona with a well-directed blow of his fist.  It was, doubtless, out of revenge for this that the latter now dogged the former through the lonely recesses of the mountain-pass by which he had crossed the island from the little settlement in which was his home, and gained the sequestered bay in which he expected to find the schooner.  Up to this point, however, the savage had not summoned courage to make the attack, although, with the exception of a hunting-knife, his enemy was altogether unarmed, for he knew that in the event of missing his mark the young man's speed of foot would enable him to outstrip him, while his strength of frame would quickly terminate a single combat.  As the youth gained the more open land near the beach, the possibility of making a successful cast of the spear became more and more doubtful. Finally the savage shrunk into the bushes and abandoned the pursuit.  \"Not here yet, Master Gascoyne,\" muttered Henry as he sat down on a rock to rest; for although the six miles of country he had crossed was a trifle, as regarded distance, to a lad of nineteen, the rugged mountain-path by which he had come would have tried the muscles of a Red Indian, and the nerve of a goat.  \"You were wont to keep to time better in days gone by.  Truly it seems to me a strange thing that I should thus be made a sort of walking post between my mother's house and this bay, all for the benefit of a man who seems to me no better than he should be, and whom I don't like, and yet whom I _do_ like in some unaccountable fashion that I don't understand.\"  Whatever the youth's thoughts were after giving vent to the foregoing soliloquy, he kept them to himself.  They did not at first appear to be of an agreeable nature, for he frowned once or twice, and struck his thigh with his clenched hand, but gradually a pleasant expression lit up his manly face as he gazed out upon the sleeping"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23384"],["title","Gascoyne, the Sandal-Wood Trader (#2)"],["body",", and watched the gorgeous clouds that soon began to rise and cluster round the sun.  After an hour or so spent in wandering on the beach picking up shells, and gazing wistfully out to sea, Henry Stuart appeared to grow tired of waiting, for he laid himself down on the shore, turned his back on the ocean, pillowed his head on a tuft of grass, and deliberately went to sleep.  Now was the time for the savage to wreak his vengeance on his enemy, but, fortunately, that villain, despite his subtlety and cunning, had not conceived the possibility of the youth indulging in such an unnatural recreation as a nap in the forenoon.  He had, therefore, retired to his native jungle, and during the hour in which Henry was buried in repose, and in which he might have accomplished his end without danger or uncertainty, he was seated in a dark cave moodily resolving in his mind future plans of villany, and indulging the hope that on the youth's returning homewards he would be more successful in finding a favourable opportunity to take his life.  During this same hour it was that our low-hulled little schooner hove in sight on the horizon, ran swiftly down before the breeze, cast anchor in the bay, and sent her boat ashore, as we have seen, with the captain, the surly man called Dick, and our friend John Bumpus.  It happened that, just as the boat ran under the shelter of a rocky point and touched the strand, Keona left his cave for the purpose of observing what young Stuart was about.  He knew that he could not have retraced his homeward way without passing within sight of his place of concealment.  A glance of surprise crossed his dark visage as he crept to the edge of the underwood and saw the schooner at anchor in the bay.  This was succeeded by a fiendish grin of exultation as his eye fell on the slumbering form of the youth.  He instantly took advantage of the opportunity; and so deeply was he engrossed with his murderous intention, that he did not observe the captain of the schooner as he turned a projecting rock, and suddenly appeared upon the scene.  The captain, however, saw the savage, and instantly drew back, signing, at the same time, to his two men to keep under cover.  A second glance shewed him the sleeping form of Henry, and, almost before he had time to suspect that foul play was going on, he saw the savage glide from the bushes to the side of the sleeper, raise his spear, and poise it for one moment, as if to make sure of sending it straight to the youth's heart.  There was not a moment to lose.  The captain carried a short carbine in his hand, with which he took aim at the savage--going down on one knee to make a surer shot, for the carbine of those days was not to be depended on at a distance much beyond a hundred yards; and as the actors in this scene were separated by even more than that distance, there was a considerable chance of missing the savage and hitting the young man.  This, however, was not a moment to calculate chances.  The captain pulled the trigger, and the crash of the shot was followed by a howl from the savage, as his uplifted arm dropt to his side, and the spear fell across the face of the sleeper.  Henry instantly awoke, and sprang up with the agility of a panther.  Before he could observe what had occurred, Keona leapt into the bushes and disappeared.  Henry at once bounded after him; and the captain, giving vent to a lusty cheer, rushed across the beach, and sprang into the forest, closely followed by surly Dick and John Bumpus, whose united cheers of excitement and shouts of defiance awoke the echoes of the place with clamorous discords.    CHAPTER THREE.  A ROUGH WALK ENLIVENED BY RAMBLING TALK--BUMPUS IS \"AGREEABLE.\"  It is said, in the proverbial philosophy of nautical men, that \"a stern chase is a long one.\"  The present instance was an exception to the general rule.  Keona was wounded.  Young Stuart was fleet as the antelope, and strong as a young lion.  In these circumstances it is not surprising that, after a run of less than a quarter of a mile, he succeeded in laying his hands on the neck of the savage and hurling him to the ground, where he lay panting and helpless, looking up in the face of his conqueror with an expression of hopeless despair--for savages and wicked men generally are wont to judge of others by themselves, and to expect to receive such treatment from their enemies as they themselves would in similar circumstances accord.  The fear of instant death was before his eyes, and the teeth of Keona chattered in his head, while his face grew more hideous than ever, by reason of its becoming livid.  His fears were groundless.  Henry Stuart was not a savage.  He was humane by nature; and, in addition to this, he had been trained under the influence of that Book which teaches us that the most philosophical, because the most effective, method of procedure in this world, is to \"overcome evil with good.\"  \"So, you scoundrel,\" said Henry, placing his knee on Keona's chest, and compressing his throat with his left hand, while, with his right, he drew forth a long glittering knife, and raised it in the air--\"So you are not satisfied with what I gave you the last time we met, but you must needs take the trouble to cross my path a second time, and get a taste of cold steel, must you?\"  Although Keona could speak no English, he understood it sufficiently to appreciate the drift of the youth's words, even though he had failed to comprehend the meaning of the angry frown and the glittering knife. But, however much he might have wished to reply to the question, Henry took care to render the attempt impossible, by compressing his windpipe until he became blue in the face, and then black.  At the same time, he let the sharp point of his knife touch the skin just over the region of the heart.  Having thus convinced his vanquished foe that death was at the door, he suddenly relaxed his iron gripe; arose, sheathed his knife, and bade the savage get up.  The miserable creature did so, with some difficulty, just as the captain and his men arrived on the scene.  \"Well met, Henry,\" cried the former, extending his hand to the youth, \"had I been a moment later, my lads I fear that your life's blood would have been on the sea shore.\"  \"Then it was you who fired the shot, Captain Gascoyne?  This is the second time I have to thank you for saving my life,\" said the young man, returning the grasp of the captain's hand.  \"Truly, it is but a small matter to have to thank me for.  Doubtless, if my stout man, John Bumpus, had carried the carbine, he would have done you as good service.  And methinks, Henry, that you would have preferred to owe your life to either of my men, rather than to me, if I may judge by your looks.\"  \"You should not judge by looks, captain,\" replied the youth quickly--\"especially the looks of a man who has just had a hand to hand tussle with a savage.  But, to tell the plain truth, Captain Gascoyne, I would indeed rather have had to thank your worthy man, John Bumpus, than yourself for coming to my aid, for although I owe you no grudge, and do not count you an enemy, I had rather see your back than your face--and you know the reason why.\"  \"You give me credit, boy, for more knowledge than I possess,\" replied Gascoyne, while an angry frown gathered for a moment on his brow; but passed away almost as quickly as it came; \"I know not the cause of your unreasonable dislike to one who has never done you an injury.\"  \"Never done me an injury!\" cried Henry, starting and turning with a look of passion on his companion; then, checking himself by a strong effort, he added in a milder tone--\"But a truce to such talk, and I ask your forgiveness for my sharp words just after your rendering me such good service in the hour of need.  You and I differ in our notions on one or two points--that is all; there is no need for quarrelling.  See, here is a note from my mother, who sent me to the bay to meet you.\"  During this colloquy, Dick and Bumpus had mounted guard over the wounded savage, just out of ear-shot of their captain.  Neither of the sailors ventured to hold their prisoner, because they deemed it an unmanly advantage to take of one who was so completely (as they imagined) in their power.  They kept a watchful eye on him, however; and while they affected an easy indifference of attitude, held themselves in readiness to pounce upon him if he should attempt to escape.  But nothing seemed farther from the mind of Keona than such an attempt.  He appeared to be thoroughly exhausted by his recent struggle and loss of blood, and his body was bent as if he were about to sink down to the ground.  There was, however, a peculiar glance in his dark eyes that induced John Bumpus to be more on his guard than appearances seemed to warrant.  While Gascoyne was reading the letter to which we have referred, Keona suddenly placed his left leg behind surly Dick, and, with his unwounded fist, hit that morose individual such a tremendous back-handed blow on the nose, that he instantly measured his length on the ground.  John Bumpus made a sudden plunge at the savage on seeing this, but the latter ducked his head, passed like an eel under the very arms of the sailor, and went off into the forest like a deer.  \"Hold!\" shouted Captain Gascoyne, as John turned in a state of mingled amazement and anger to pursue.  \"Hold on, Bumpus, let the miserable rascal go.\"  John stopped, looked over his shoulder, hesitated, and finally came back with a rolling air of nautical indifference, and his hands thrust into his breeches pockets.  \"You know best, capting,\" said he, \"but I think it a pity to let sich a dirty varmint go clear off, to dodge about in the bushes, and mayhap treat us to a pisoned arrow, or a spear-thrust on the sly. Howsomedever, it aint no consarn wotever to Jo Bumpus.  How's your beak, Dick, my boy?\"  \"None the better for your askin',\" replied the surly mariner, who was tenderly stroking the injured"]]]
