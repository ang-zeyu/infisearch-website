Yet, even in their low condition, there were good points about those islanders.  Cook says that they were as large as the largest-sized Europeans.  The men were tall, strong, well-limbed, and finely shaped. The tallest he saw, on a neighbouring island, was a man who measured six feet three inches and a half.  The women of the superior rank were above our middle stature, but those of the inferior class rather below it. Their complexion was a kind of clear olive or _brunette_, and the skin of the women was smooth and soft.  They had no colour in their cheeks, but their faces were comely; the cheekbones were not high, neither were the eyes hollow.  Their eyes were sparkling and full of expression, and their teeth good, but their noses being flat did not correspond with his ideas of beauty.  Their hair was black and coarse.  The men had beards, which they wore in many fashions, always, however, plucking out great part of them, and keeping the rest perfectly clean and neat.  In most countries it is the custom of the men to wear short and the women long hair.  Here, however, Cook found this custom reversed.  The women cut it short round the ears, and the men--except the fishermen, who were almost continually in the water--suffered it to flow in large waves over their shoulders, or tied it up in a bunch on the top of their heads.  They were in the habit of anointing it with cocoa-nut oil, which had the effect of rendering their heads very filthy; but in other respects the natives of Tahiti were remarkable for cleanliness.  Their clothing consisted of native-made cloth or matting, and was very scanty, but in many cases was tastefully put on and intermingled with flowers.  Some of the men wore a feather in their hair; others wore a wig made of the hair of men and dogs.  Both sexes wore ear-rings made of pieces of stones, shells, or berries, which were speedily exchanged, however, for the beads given them by the sailors, for, like all other savages, they delighted in gay ornaments.  The houses of these people were very simple.  They consisted of nothing more than a thatched roof mounted upon pillars.  They had no walls whatever, and were open to every wind of heaven, but in so warm a climate this was not considered a disadvantage.  There were no rooms or partitions of any kind in them, and they were usually large.  Some belonged to families, others were the public property of a district, and these last were sometimes two hundred feet long by thirty broad.  All the houses were built in the woods that lay between the sea and the mountains.  No more ground was cleared for each house than was just sufficient to prevent the droppings of the branches from falling on the roof; so that the inhabitant could step at once from his cottage into the shade of the forest, which was the most delightful and romantic that could be imagined.  It consisted of groves of bread-fruit and cocoa-nut trees without underwood, and paths led in all directions through it from one house to another.  Only those travellers who have experienced the intense overpowering heat of tropical countries can form a just conception of the enjoyableness of a ramble through the shady groves of Tahiti.  The food eaten by the natives was chiefly vegetable.  They had tame hogs, dogs, and poultry, but these were not plentiful, and the visit of Cook's ship soon diminished the numbers of animals very considerably. When a chief killed a hog it was divided almost equally amongst his dependants, and as these were numerous, the share of each individual at a feast was not large.  Dogs and fowls fell to the lot of the lower classes.  Cook says that he could not commend the flavour of their fowls, but he and his crew unanimously agreed that a South-Sea dog was little inferior to English lamb!  He conjectured that their excellence was owing to the fact that they were fed exclusively upon vegetables.  Like everything else in Tahiti, the art of cooking was somewhat peculiar.  The preparation of a dog for dinner is thus described:--  \"The dog, which was very fat, we consigned over to Tupia, who undertook to perform the double office of butcher and cook.  He killed him by holding his hands close over his mouth and nose, an operation which continued above a quarter of an hour.  While this was going on, a hole was made in the ground about a foot deep, in which a fire was kindled, and some small stones were placed in layers alternately with the wood to get heated.  The dog was then singed by holding him over the fire, and by scraping him with a shell the hair came off as clean as if he had been scalded in hot water.  He was then cut up with the same instrument, and his entrails being taken out, were sent to the sea, where, being carefully washed, they were put into cocoa-nut shells with what blood came from the body.  \"When the hole was sufficiently heated, the fire was removed, and some of the stones,--which were not so hot as to discolour anything that touched them,--being placed in the bottom, were covered with green leaves.  The dog and the entrails were then placed upon the leaves, other leaves were placed above them, the whole was covered up with the remainder of the hot stones, and the mouth of the hole was closed with mould.  In somewhat less than four hours it was again opened and the dog taken out excellently baked.  Nearly all the fish and flesh eaten by the inhabitants is dressed in this way.\"  The sea in those regions affords the natives great variety of fish; the smaller of which they usually eat raw.  They have also lobsters, crabs, and other shell-fish, all of which they are very fond of.  Indeed, nothing seems to come amiss to them.  They even eat what sailors call _blubbers_, though some of these are so tough that they have to allow them to become putrid before they can chew them.  Their chief vegetable, the bread-fruit, is so curious a plant that it merits particular notice.  It costs them no more trouble or labour to procure it than the climbing of a tree.  In regard to this tree Cook says that it does not indeed shoot up spontaneously, but if a man plants ten of them in his lifetime, which he may do in about an hour, he will sufficiently fulfil his duty to his own and to future generations. True, the bread-fruit is not always in season; but when its ready-made loaves are not to be had, the South-Sea islander has plenty of cocoa-nuts, bananas, plantains, and other fruits to supply its place.  The bread-fruit tree is large and beautiful.  Its trunk, which is light-coloured and rough, grows to a height of twelve or twenty feet, and is sometimes three feet in diameter.  Its leaves are broad, dark green, and a foot or eighteen inches long.  The fruit, about the size of a child's head, is round, covered with a rough rind, and is at first of a light pea-green hue; subsequently it changes to brown, and when fully ripe, assumes a rich yellow colour.  It hangs to the branches singly, or in clusters of two or three together.  One of these magnificent trees, clothed with its dark shining leaves and loaded with many hundreds of large light green or yellowish fruit, is one of the most beautiful objects to be met with among the islands of the south.  The pulp of the bread-fruit between the rind and the core is all eatable.  The core itself, which is about the size and shape of the handle of a knife, is uneatable.  The bread-fruit is never eaten raw. The usual mode of dressing it is to remove the rind and the core, divide the pulp into three or four pieces, and bake it in an oven similar to the one just described.  When taken out, in somewhat less than an hour, the outside of the fruit is nicely browned, and the inner part so strongly resembles the crumb of wheaten bread as to have suggested the name of the tree.  It is not, however, quite so pleasant to the taste, being rather insipid and slightly sweet.  Nevertheless it is extremely good for food, and is much prized by the natives, to whom it may almost be said to be the staff of life.  The tree on which this excellent fruit grows, besides producing two, and, in some cases, three crops in a year, furnishes a species of gum, or resin, which oozes from the bark when cut, and hardens when exposed to the sun.  It is used for pitching the seams of canoes.  The bark of the young branches is employed in making several varieties of native cloth.  The wood of the tree is also valuable for building houses and canoes.  There are nearly fifty varieties of the bread-fruit tree, for which the natives have distinct names, and as these varieties ripen at different times, there are few months in the year in which the fruit is not to be had.  Not less valuable to the natives of these islands is the cocoa-nut tree, the stem of which is three or four feet in diameter at the root, whence it tapers gradually without branch or leaf to the top, where it terminates in a beautiful tuft or plume of long green leaves which wave gracefully in every breeze.  One of the singular peculiarities of this tree is its power of flourishing in almost any soil.  It grows equally well on the mountain-side, in the rich valleys beside the streams, and on the barren sea-beach of the coral reefs, where its only soil is sand, and where its roots are watered by the waves of every rising tide.  Another peculiarity is, that fruit in every stage may be seen on the same tree at one time--from the first formation, after the falling of the blossom, to the ripe nut.  As the tree is slow in growth, the nuts do not probably come to perfection until twelve months after the blossoms have fallen.  The successive ripening of the nuts, therefore, seems to have been purposely arranged by our beneficent Creator, with a special view to the comfort of man.  Each nut is surrounded by a tough husk, or shell, nearly two inches thick, and "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23267"],["title","The Cannibal Islands: Captain Cook's Adventure in the South Seas (#8)"],["body","it has reached its full size it contains a pint, or a pint and a half, of the juice usually called cocoa-nut milk.  The kernels of the tough outer husks, above referred to, are the \"cocoa-nuts\" which we see exposed for sale in this country, but these nuts give no idea of the delightful fruit when plucked from the tree. They are old and dry, and the milk is comparatively rancid.  In the state in which we usually see cocoa-nuts they are never used by the natives except as seed, or for the extraction of oil.  Some varieties of this tree grow to a height of sixty or seventy feet. As all the nuts are at the top the gathering of them would be an extremely difficult matter were it not for an ingenious contrivance by which the natives manage to climb the trees; for it may be easily understood that to _shin_ up an exceedingly rough pole of seventy feet high, with bare legs, would try the mettle of most men--civilised as well as savage.  The plan is simple.  The native strips off a piece of tough bark from a branch, and therewith ties his feet together, leaving them, however, several inches apart, grasping the trunk with his arms he presses his feet against each side of the tree so that the piece of bark between them catches in the roughnesses of the stem; this gives him a purchase by which he is enabled to leap or vault up like a monkey.  The wood of the tree is excellent.  The natives make pillars for their houses and their best spears from it.  A species of what we may call natural cloth is found, ready-made, on its leaves, with which they make sacks, and shirts, and jackets.  Plaited leaflets form coverings for their floors.  Baskets are made from the leaves, matting and cordage of the fibrous husk, and oil is extracted from the nut.  Besides all this, the shells of the old nuts are used as water-bottles, and, when carved and highly polished, they form elegant drinking-cups.  The perfect adaptation of the bread-fruit and cocoa-nut trees to the varied wants of the South-sea islanders tells, more eloquently than could be told in words, of the wisdom and benevolence with which the Almighty cares for His creatures, even while those creatures are living in the habitual neglect of Himself, and in the violation of all His laws.    CHAPTER EIGHT.  TREATS OF SAVAGE WARFARE AND SOME OF ITS CONSEQUENCES.  It has been said that the natives of the innumerable islands of the South Seas are fond of war.  All travellers to those regions bear witness to this fact.  When Cook went there, the natives of all of them were absolute savages.  At the present time a great number of the islands have been blessed with the light of Christianity, but some of them are still lying in the state of degradation in which they were first found.  At this moment, reader, while you ponder these lines, there are men of the South Seas who wander about in a state of nudity and idleness; who practise every species of abomination, and kill, roast, and eat each other, just as they did a hundred years ago.  The eating of human beings, or, as it is called, cannibalism, is no idle tale invented by travellers.  Men of the highest character for truth, who have had ample opportunity for observation, from the time of Cook to the present day, have assured us that the natives of those lovely regions are cannibals: that they not only eat the bodies of enemies slain in war, but even kill and eat their own slaves.  Of this you shall hear more anon; meanwhile, let us turn aside to see how these savage warriors go forth to battle.  When it has been decided that they shall go to war, the natives of the South-Sea islands commence their preparations with human sacrifices to the god of war.  After many strange, bloody, and superstitious rites, the warriors arm themselves and prepare for the fight.  Their weapons, which they use with great dexterity, are slings for throwing heavy stones, pikes headed with the bones of sting-rays, and clubs about six or seven feet long, made of a very hard and heavy wood. In some instances these are richly carved.  The chief of each district leads his own subjects to the field, and reports the number of his men to the leading chief.  When all are assembled they sally forth.  If the fight is to take place on land, it is sometimes begun by the celebrated warriors of each army marching to the front of their respective lines, and sitting down on the ground.  Several of these then step forward, and boastfully challenge each other to combat.  The challenge is usually accepted at once, and after taunting each other for some time, they engage in furious battle.  When one falls, a man from his side rises and steps forward to fill his place and continue the fight.  If either party gives way, then the main body of the army to which it belongs rushes forward to its support.  The opposing army of course springs forward to meet them, and thus the fight becomes general.  The main bodies advance in ranks four deep.  In the first rank are the bravest men, armed with spears; in the second rank they are armed with clubs to defend the spearmen.  The third row consists of young men with slings, and the fourth is composed of women, who carry baskets of stones for the slingers, and clubs and spears for the other combatants.  There is no science displayed in their mode of fighting.  The opposing armies rush upon each other with terrible fury, dealing deadly blows and thrusts with their murderous weapons.  The din and clamour of the fray is increased by a class of men whose duty it is to animate the troops by voice and gesture.  These may be styled the orators of battle, and are usually men of commanding stature and well-tried courage.  They mingle in the thickest of the fight; hurry to and fro, cheering the men with the passionate recital of heroic deeds, and, in every possible way, rousing their courage and urging them on to deeds of valour.  Pressing through the host with flashing eyes and thundering voice, they shout such abrupt sentences as the following:--  \"Roll onward like the billows!  Break on them with the ocean's foam and roar when bursting on the reefs!  Hang on them as the forked lightning plays above the foaming surf!  Give out the vigilance; give out the anger--the anger of the devouring wild dog--till their line is broken; till they flow back like the receding tide!\"  Amid such cries, mingled with the shouts of maddened combatants, and the yells of stricken men, the fight goes on.  They use no shields. Believing that the gods direct their weapons, they make no attempt to guard, but lay about them with fury.  Blows do not often require to be repeated.  Skulls are cleft or battered in; and hearts are pierced with one blow or thrust, and, when noted warriors fall on either side, shouts of triumph echo along the line and strike a panic through the enemy's ranks.  The first wounded man who can be seized before being quite dead is offered in sacrifice by his foes.  He is not taken to their temple for that purpose, but his head is bound round with sacred cinet brought from the temple, and he is then laid alive on a number of spears and borne on men's shoulders along the ranks, the priest of the god of war walking alongside and watching the writhings of the dying man.  If a tear falls from his eye it is said he is weeping for his land.  If he should clench his fist it is supposed to be a sign that his party will resist to the last.  If a great chief falls, the party to which he belongs retires a short distance, collects some of the bravest men, and then rushes with incredible fury and yells of vengeance upon the foe to \"clear away the blood.\"  The shock is terrific when the contending parties meet, and numbers usually fall on both sides.  During the battle the armies sometimes separate a little distance for a time, leaving a space between them; then the slingers of stones advance. The most expert of these slingers are renowned warriors, and when they are recognised a shout arises from the opposite ranks, \"Beware! a powerful stone is such an one.\"  At short range the stones about the size of a hen's egg are thrown straight at the enemy with such force that it is almost impossible to avoid them, so that they do much execution.  But soon again the lines close and the fight is renewed hand to hand.  At length one of the lines begins to waver.  Seeing this, the others are encouraged to renewed efforts; their enemies at last break and fly, and then a scene of terrible carnage follows.  The vanquished rush to their canoes, or fly to the strongholds of the mountains.  The victors continue the pursuit, slaughtering men and women indiscriminately.  A fallen warrior perchance cries for mercy, \"Spare me! may I live?\" says he.  If the name of his conqueror's chief or king is invoked, the request is sometimes granted; if not, the only reply is a taunt, followed by a thrust or a deadly blow.  Thus the scene of murder and blood goes on until the fugitives have reached their strongholds, or until the shades of evening put an end to the pursuit.  Such were the scenes that took place in the days of Captain Cook, and such or similar scenes still occur frequently at the present time on the coral isles of the Pacific.  When their wars are conducted on the sea, the islanders embark in war-canoes, which are so large as to be able to carry from sixty to eighty and even a hundred men.  Captain Cook tells us that the ingenuity of these people appears in nothing more than in their canoes.  They are long and narrow.  One that he measured was sixty-eight and a half feet long, five feet broad, and three feet and a half deep.  The bottom was sharp, with straight sides like a wedge.  Each side consisted of one entire plank sixty-three feet long, ten or twelve inches broad, and an inch and a quarter thick.  The bottom part of the canoe was hollowed out, and these planks were lashed to it with strong plaiting.  A grotesque ornament projected six feet beyond the head, and it had a sort of"]]]
