You've got all your homes underground. Why not your factories?\"  \"Sh! Not enough room. And night missiles are scarier.\"  \"I know that building's been empty for a year,\" Daisy said uneasily, \"but how--?\"  \"Sh! Watch! _Now!_\"  The looming building seemed to blur or fuzz for a moment. Then it was as if the lake's bright ripples had invaded the old glass a hundred yards away. Wavelets chased themselves up and down the gleaming walls, became higher, higher ... and then suddenly the glass cracked all over to tiny fragments and fell away, to be followed quickly by fragmented concrete and plastic and plastic piping, until all that was left was the nude steel framework, vibrating so rapidly as to be almost invisible against the gleaming lake.         *       *       *       *       *  Daisy covered her ears, but there was no explosion, only a long-drawn-out low crash as the fragments hit twenty floors below and dust whooshed out sideways.  \"Spectacular!\" Fay summed up. \"Knew you'd enjoy it. That little trick was first conceived by the great Tesla during his last fruity years. Research discovered it in his biog--we just made the dream come true. A tiny resonance device you could carry in your belt-bag attunes itself to the natural harmonic of a structure and then increases amplitude by tiny pushes exactly in time. Just like soldiers marching in step can break down a bridge, only this is as if it were being done by one marching ant.\" He pointed at the naked framework appearing out of its own blur and said, \"We'll be able to hang the factory on that. If not, we'll whip a mega-current through it and vaporize it. No question the micro-resonator is the neatest sweetest wrecking device going. You can expect a lot more of this sort of efficiency now that mankind has the tickler to enable him to use his full potential. What's the matter, folks?\"  Daisy was staring around the violet-walled room with dumb mistrust. Her hands were trembling.  \"You don't have to worry,\" Fay assured her with an understanding laugh. \"This building's safe for a month more at least.\" Suddenly he grimaced and leaped a foot in the air. He raised a clawed hand to scratch his shoulder but managed to check the movement. \"Got to beat it, folks,\" he announced tersely. \"My tickler gave me the grand cootch.\"  \"Don't go yet,\" Gusterson called, rousing himself with a shudder which he immediately explained: \"I just had the illusion that if I shook myself all my flesh and guts would fall off my shimmying skeleton, Brr! Fay, before you and Micro go off half cocked, I want you to know there's one insuperable objection to the tickler as a mass-market item. The average man or woman won't go to the considerable time and trouble it must take to load a tickler. He simply hasn't got the compulsive orderliness and willingness to plan that it requires.\"  \"We thought of that weeks ago,\" Fay rapped, his hand on the door. \"Every tickler spool that goes to market is patterned like wallpaper with one of five designs of suitable subliminal supportive euphoric material. 'Ittier and ittier,' 'viriler and viriler'--you know. The buyer is robot-interviewed for an hour, his personalized daily routine laid out and thereafter templated on his weekly spool. He's strongly urged next to take his tickler to his doctor and psycher for further instruction-imposition. We've been working with the medical profession from the start. They love the tickler because it'll remind people to take their medicine on the dot ... and rest and eat and go to sleep just when and how doc says. This is a big operation, Gussy--a biiiiiiig operation! 'By!\"  Daisy hurried to the wall to watch him cross the park. Deep down she was a wee bit worried that he might linger to attach a micro-resonator to _this_ building and she wanted to time him. But Gusterson settled down to his typewriter and began to bat away.  \"I want to have another novel started,\" he explained to her, \"before the ant marches across this building in about four and a half weeks ... or a million sharp little gutsy guys come swarming out of the ground and heave it into Lake Erie.\"     IV   Early next morning windowless walls began to crawl up the stripped skyscraper between them and the lake. Daisy pulled the black-out curtains on that side. For a day or two longer their thoughts and conversations were haunted by Gusterson's vague sardonic visions of a horde of tickler-energized moles pouring up out of the tunnels to tear down the remaining trees, tank the atmosphere and perhaps somehow dismantle the stars--at least on this side of the world--but then they both settled back into their customary easy-going routines. Gusterson typed. Daisy made her daily shopping trip to a little topside daytime store and started painting a mural on the floor of the empty apartment next theirs but one.  \"We ought to lasso some neighbors,\" she suggested once. \"I need somebody to hold my brushes and admire. How about you making a trip below at the cocktail hours, Gusterson, and picking up a couple of girls for a starter? Flash the old viriler charm, cootch them up a bit, emphasize the delights of high living, but make sure they're compatible roommates. You could pick up that two-yard check from Micro at the same time.\"  \"You're an immoral money-ravenous wench,\" Gusterson said absently, trying to dream of an insanity beyond insanity that would make his next novel a real id-rousing best-vender.  \"If that's your vision of me, you shouldn't have chewed up the VV mask.\"  \"I'd really prefer you with green stripes,\" he told her. \"But stripes, spots, or sun-bathing, you're better than those cocktail moles.\"  Actually both of them acutely disliked going below. They much preferred to perch in their eyrie and watch the people of Cleveland Depths, as they privately called the local sub-suburb, rush up out of the shelters at dawn to work in the concrete fields and windowless factories, make their daytime jet trips and freeway jaunts, do their noon-hour and coffee-break guerrilla practice, and then go scurrying back at twilight to the atomic-proof, brightly lit, vastly exciting, claustrophobic caves.  Fay and his projects began once more to seem dreamlike, though Gusterson did run across a cryptic advertisement for ticklers in _The Manchester Guardian_, which he got daily by facsimile. Their three children reported similar ads, of no interest to young fry, on the TV and one afternoon they came home with the startling news that the monitors at their subsurface school had been issued ticklers. On sharp interrogation by Gusterson, however, it appeared that these last were not ticklers but merely two-way radios linked to the school police station transmitter.  [Illustration]  \"Which is bad enough,\" Gusterson commented later to Daisy. \"But it'd be even dirtier to think of those clock-watching superegos being strapped to kids' shoulders. Can you imagine Huck Finn with a tickler, tellin' him when to tie up the raft to a tow-head and when to take a swim?\"  \"I bet Fay could,\" Daisy countered. \"When's he going to bring you that check, anyhow? Iago wants a jetcycle and I promised Imogene a Vina Kit and then Claudius'll have to have something.\"  Gusterson scowled thoughtfully. \"You know, Daze,\" he said, \"I got a feeling Fay's in the hospital, all narcotized up and being fed intravenously. The way he was jumping around last time, that tickler was going to cootch him to pieces in a week.\"         *       *       *       *       *  As if to refute this intuition, Fay turned up that very evening. The lights were dim. Something had gone wrong with the building's old transformer and, pending repairs, the two remaining occupied apartments were making do with batteries, which turned bright globes to mysterious amber candles and made Gusterson's ancient typewriter operate sluggishly.  Fay's manner was subdued or at least closely controlled and for a moment Gusterson thought he'd shed his tickler. Then the little man came out of the shadows and Gusterson saw the large bulge on his right shoulder.  [Illustration]  \"Yes, we had to up it a bit sizewise,\" Fay explained in clipped tones. \"Additional super-features. While brilliantly successful on the whole, the subliminal euphorics were a shade too effective. Several hundred users went hoppity manic. We gentled the cootch and qualified the subliminals--you know, 'Day by day in every way I'm getting sharper _and more serene_'--but a stabilizing influence was still needed, so after a top-level conference we decided to combine Tickler with Moodmaster.\"  \"My God,\" Gusterson interjected, \"do they have a machine now that does that?\"  \"Of course. They've been using them on ex-mental patients for years.\"  \"I just don't keep up with progress,\" Gusterson said, shaking his head bleakly. \"I'm falling behind on all fronts.\"  \"You ought to have your tickler remind you to read Science Service releases,\" Fay told him. \"Or simply instruct it to scan the releases and--no, that's still in research.\" He looked at Gusterson's shoulder and his eyes widened. \"You're not wearing the new-model tickler I sent you,\" he said accusingly.  \"I never got it,\" Gusterson assured him. \"Postmen deliver topside mail and parcels by throwing them on the high-speed garbage boosts and hoping a tornado will blow them to the right addresses.\" Then he added helpfully, \"Maybe the Russians stole it while it was riding the whirlwinds.\"  \"That's not a suitable topic for jesting,\" Fay frowned. \"We're hoping that Tickler will mobilize the full potential of the Free World for the first time in history. Gusterson, you are going to have to wear a ticky-tick. It's becoming impossible for a man to get through modern life without one.\"  \"Maybe I will,\" Gusterson said appeasingly, \"but right now tell me about Moodmaster. I want to put it in my new insanity novel.\"  Fay"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23164"],["title","The Creature from Cleveland Depths (#4)"],["body","his head. \"Your readers will just think you're behind the times. If you use it, underplay it. But anyhow, Moodmaster is a simple physiotherapy engine that monitors bloodstream chemicals and body electricity. It ties directly into the bloodstream, keeping blood, sugar, et cetera, at optimum levels and injecting euphrin or depressin as necessary--and occasionally a touch of extra adrenaline, as during work emergencies.\"  \"Is it painful?\" Daisy called from the bedroom.  \"Excruciating,\" Gusterson called back. \"Excuse it, please,\" he grinned at Fay. \"Hey, didn't I suggest cocaine injections last time I saw you?\"  \"So you did,\" Fay agreed flatly. \"Oh by the way, Gussy, here's that check for a yard I promised you. Micro doesn't muzzle the ox.\"  \"Hooray!\" Daisy cheered faintly.         *       *       *       *       *  \"I thought you said it was going to be for two.\" Gusterson complained.  \"Budgeting always forces a last-minute compromise,\" Fay shrugged. \"You have to learn to accept those things.\"  \"I love accepting money and I'm glad any time for three feet,\" Daisy called agreeably. \"Six feet might make me wonder if I weren't an insect, but getting a yard just makes me feel like a gangster's moll.\"  \"Want to come out and gloat over the yard paper, Toots, and stuff it in your diamond-embroidered net stocking top?\" Gusterson called back.  \"No, I'm doing something to that portion of me just now. But hang onto the yard, Gusterson.\"  \"Aye-aye, Cap'n,\" he assured her. Then, turning back to Fay, \"So you've taken the Dr. Coué repeating out of the tickler?\"  \"Oh, no. Just balanced it off with depressin. The subliminals are still a prime sales-point. All the tickler features are cumulative, Gussy. You're still underestimating the scope of the device.\"  \"I guess I am. What's this 'work-emergencies' business? If you're using the tickler to inject drugs into workers to keep them going, that's really just my cocaine suggestion modernized and I'm putting in for another thou. Hundreds of years ago the South American Indians chewed coca leaves to kill fatigue sensations.\"  \"That so? Interesting--and it proves priority for the Indians, doesn't it? I'll make a try for you, Gussy, but don't expect anything.\" He cleared his throat, his eyes grew distant and, turning his head a little to the right, he enunciated sharply, \"Pooh-Bah. Time: Inst oh five. One oh five seven. Oh oh. Record: Gussy coca thou budget. Cut.\" He explained, \"We got a voice-cued setter now on the deluxe models. You can record a memo to yourself without taking off your shirt. Incidentally, I use the ends of the hours for trifle-memos. I've already used up the fifty-nines and eights for tomorrow and started on the fifty-sevens.\"  \"I understood most of your memo,\" Gusterson told him gruffly. \"The last 'Oh oh' was for seconds, wasn't it? Now I call that crude--why not microseconds too? But how do you remember where you've made a memo so you don't rerecord over it? After all, you're rerecording over the wallpaper all the time.\"  \"Tickler beeps and then hunts for the nearest information-free space.\"  \"I see. And what's the Pooh-Bah for?\"  Fay smiled. \"Cut. My password for activating the setter, so it won't respond to chance numerals it overhears.\"  \"But why Pooh-Bah?\"  Fay grinned. \"Cut. And you a writer. It's a literary reference, Gussy. Pooh-Bah (cut!) was Lord High Everything Else in _The Mikado_. He had a little list and nothing on it would ever be missed.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Oh, yeah,\" Gusterson remembered, glowering. \"As I recall it, all that went on that list was the names of people who were slated to have their heads chopped off by Ko-Ko. Better watch your step, Shorty. It may be a back-handed omen. Maybe all those workers you're puttin' ticklers on to pump them full of adrenaline so they'll overwork without noticin' it will revolt and come out some day choppin' for your head.\"  \"Spare me the Marxist mythology,\" Fay protested. \"Gussy, you've got a completely wrong slant on Tickler. It's true that most of our mass sales so far, bar government and army, have been to large companies purchasing for their employees--\"  \"Ah-ha!\"  \"--but that's because there's nothing like a tickler for teaching a new man his job. It tells him from instant to instant what he must do--while he's already on the job and without disturbing other workers. Magnetizing a wire with a job pattern is the easiest thing going. And you'd be astonished what the subliminals do for employee morale. It's this way, Gussy: most people are too improvident and unimaginative to see in advance the advantages of ticklers. They buy one because the company strongly suggests it and payment is on easy installments withheld from salary. They find a tickler makes the work day go easier. The little fellow perched on your shoulder is a friend exuding comfort and good advice. The first thing he's set to say is 'Take it easy, pal.'  \"Within a week they're wearing their tickler 24 hours a day--and buying a tickler for the wife, so she'll remember to comb her hair and smile real pretty and cook favorite dishes.\"  \"I get it, Fay,\" Gusterson cut in. \"The tickler is the newest fad for increasing worker efficiency. Once, I read somewheres, it was salt tablets. They had salt-tablet dispensers everywhere, even in air-conditioned offices where there wasn't a moist armpit twice a year and the gals sweat only champagne. A decade later people wondered what all those dusty white pills were for. Sometimes they were mistook for tranquilizers. It'll be the same way with ticklers. Somebody'll open a musty closet and see jumbled heaps of these gripping-hand silvery gadgets gathering dust curls and--\"  \"They will not!\" Fay protested vehemently. \"Ticklers are not a fad--they're history-changers, they're Free-World revolutionary! Why, before Micro Systems put a single one on the market, we'd made it a rule that every Micro employee had to wear one! If that's not having supreme confidence in a product--\"  \"Every employee except the top executives, of course,\" Gusterson interrupted jeeringly. \"And that's not demoting you, Fay. As the R & D chief most closely involved, you'd naturally have to show special enthusiasm.\"  \"But you're wrong there, Gussy,\" Fay crowed. \"Man for man, our top executives have been more enthusiastic about their personal ticklers than any other class of worker in the whole outfit.\"  Gusterson slumped and shook his head. \"If that's the case,\" he said darkly, \"maybe mankind deserves the tickler.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"I'll say it does!\" Fay agreed loudly without thinking. Then, \"Oh, can the carping, Gussy. Tickler's a great invention. Don't deprecate it just because you had something to do with its genesis. You're going to have to get in the swim and wear one.\"  \"Maybe I'd rather drown horribly.\"  \"Can the gloom-talk too! Gussy, I said it before and I say it again, you're just scared of this new thing. Why, you've even got the drapes pulled so you won't have to look at the tickler factory.\"  \"Yes, I am scared,\" Gusterson said. \"Really sca ... AWP!\"  Fay whirled around. Daisy was standing in the bedroom doorway, wearing the short silver sheath. This time there was no mask, but her bobbed hair was glitteringly silvered, while her legs, arms, hands, neck, face--every bit of her exposed skin--was painted with beautifully even vertical green stripes.  \"I did it as a surprise for Gusterson,\" she explained to Fay. \"He says he likes me this way. The green glop's supposed to be smudgeproof.\"  Gusterson did not comment. His face had a rapt expression. \"I'll tell you why your tickler's so popular, Fay,\" he said softly. \"It's not because it backstops the memory or because it boosts the ego with subliminals. It's because it takes the hook out of a guy, it takes over the job of withstanding the pressure of living. See, Fay, here are all these little guys in this subterranean rat race with atomic-death squares and chromium-plated reward squares and enough money if you pass Go almost to get to Go again--and a million million rules of the game to keep in mind. Well, here's this one little guy and every morning he wakes up there's all these things he's got to keep in mind to do or he'll lose his turn three times in a row and maybe a terrible black rook in iron armor'll loom up and bang him off the chessboard. But now, look, now he's got his tickler and he tells his sweet silver tickler all these things and the tickler's got to remember them. Of course he'll have to do them eventually but meanwhile the pressure's off him, the hook's out of his short hairs. He's shifted the responsibility....\"  \"Well, what's so bad about that?\" Fay broke in loudly. \"What's wrong with taking the pressure off little guys? Why shouldn't Tickler be a super-ego surrogate? Micro's Motivations chief noticed that positive feature straight off and scored it three pluses. Besides, it's nothing but a gaudy way of saying that Tickler backstops the memory. Seriously, Gussy, what's so bad about it?\"  \"I don't know,\" Gusterson said slowly, his eyes still far away. \"I just know it feels bad to me.\" He crinkled his big forehead. \"Well for one thing,\" he said, \"it means that a man's taking orders from something else. He's got a kind of master. He's sinking back into a slave psychology.\"  \"He's only taking orders from himself,\" Fay countered disgustedly. \"Tickler's just a mech reminder, a notebook, in essence no more than the back of an old envelope. It's no master.\"  \"Are you absolutely sure of that?\" Gusterson asked quietly.  \"Why, Gussy, you big oaf--\" Fay began heatedly. Suddenly his features quirked and he twitched. \"'Scuse me, folks,\" he said rapidly, heading for the door, \"but my tickler told me I gotta go.\"  \"Hey Fay, don't you mean you told your tickler to tell you when it was time to go?\" Gusterson called after him.  Fay looked back in the doorway. He wet his lips, his eyes moved from side to side. \"I'm not quite sure,\" "]]]
