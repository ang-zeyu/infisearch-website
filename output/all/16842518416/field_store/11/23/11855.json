Some time previous to this, the Earl of Selkirk--chiefly from philanthropic views, it is said--resolved to send a colony to Red River. At different times bands of Scotch, Swiss, Danes, and others, made their appearance in the Settlement.  They had been sent out by the agents of the Earl, but there was a great deal of mismanagement and misunderstanding, both as to the motives and intentions of the Earl. The result was that the half-breeds of Red River--influenced, it is said, by the Nor'-West Company--received the newcomers with suspicion and ill-will.  The Indians followed the lead of the half-breeds, to whom they were allied.  Not only was every sort of obstruction thrown in the way of the unfortunate immigrants, but more than once during those first years they were driven from the colony, and their homesteads were burned to the ground.  There must have been more than the usual spirit of indomitable resolution in those people, however, for notwithstanding all the opposition and hardship they had to endure, they returned again and again to their farms, rebuilt their dwellings, cultivated their fields, and, so to speak, compelled prosperity to smile on them--and that, too, although several times the powers of Nature, in the shape of grass hoppers and disastrous floods, seemed to league with men in seeking their destruction.  Perhaps the Scottish element among the immigrants had much to do with this resolute perseverance.  Possibly the religious element in the Scotch had more to do with it still.  The disastrous winter which we have slightly sketched was one of the many troubles with which not only the newcomers, but all parties in the colony, were at this time afflicted.    CHAPTER SEVEN.  VIXEN DELIVERED AND WOLVES DEFEATED.  With much labour and skill had the Davidsons and McKays erected two timber cottages side by side in the land of their adoption.  These two families were among the first band of settlers.  They were very different in character--one being Highland, the other Lowland Scotch, but they were more or less united by sympathy, intermarriage, and long residence beside each other on the slopes of the Grampian Hills, so that, on the voyage out, they made a compact that they should stick by each other, and strive, and work, and fight the battle of life together in the new land.  All the members of the Davidson family were sterling, sedate, hearty, and thorough-going.  Daniel and Peter were what men style \"dependable\" fellows, and bore strong resemblance to their father, who died almost immediately after their arrival in the new country.  Little Jessie was like her mother, a sort of bottomless well of sympathy, into which oceans of joy or sorrow might be poured without causing an overflow-- except, perchance, at the eyelids--and out of which the waters of consolation might be pumped for evermore without pumping dry.  The idea of self never suggested itself in the presence of these two.  The consequence was that everybody adored them.  It was rather a selfish adoration, we fear, nevertheless it was extremely delightful--to the adorers, we mean--and doubtless not unpleasant to the adored.  The love of God, in Christ, was the foundation of their characters.  Of the McKay family we cannot speak so confidently.  Elspie, indeed, was all that could be desired, and Fergus was in all respects a sterling man; but the head of the family was, as we have seen, open to improvement in many respects, and Duncan junior was of that heart-breaking character which is known as ne'er-do-weel.  Possibly, if differently treated by his father, he might have been a better man.  As it was, he was unprincipled and hasty of temper.  Little wonder that, when thrown together during a long voyage--to an almost unknown land--Elspie McKay and Daniel Davidson should fall into that condition which is common to all mankind, and less wonder that, being a daring youth with a resolute will, Daniel should manage to induce the pliant, loving Elspie, to plight her troth while they were gazing over the ship's side at the first iceberg they met.  We may as well hark back here a little, and very briefly sketch the incident.  It may serve as a guide to others.  The two were standing--according to the report of the bo's'n, who witnessed the whole affair--\"abaft the main shrouds squintin' over the weather gangway.\"  We are not quite sure of the exact words used by that discreditable bo's'n, but these are something like them.  It was moon-light and dead calm; therefore propitious, so far, to Daniel's design--for Daniel undoubtedly had a design that night, obvious to his own mind, and clearly defined like the great iceberg, though, like it too, somewhat hazy in detail.  \"What a glorious, magnificent object!\" exclaimed Elspie, gazing in wonder at the berg, the pinnacles of which rose considerably above the mast-head.  \"Yes, very glorious, very magnificent!\" said Daniel, gazing into the maiden's eyes, and utterly regardless of the berg.  \"I wonder how such a huge mass ever manages to melt,\" said Elspie--for the human mind, even in pretty girls, is discursive.  \"_I_ wonder it does not melt at once,\" said Dan, with pointed emphasis.  \"What do you mean?\" she asked, turning her eyes in considerable astonishment from the berg to the man.  \"I mean,\" said he, \"that under the influence of your eyes the iceberg ought to melt straight away.  They have melted my heart, Elspie, and _That_ has been an iceberg, I find, till now.\"  He seized her hand.  It had all come on so suddenly that poor Elspie was quite unprepared for it.  She turned as if to fly, but Daniel put his arm round her waist and detained her.  \"Elspie, dearest Elspie, it _must_ be settled now--or--.\"  He would not--could not--say \"never.\"  \"O Daniel, don't!\" entreated Elspie.  But Daniel _did_.  \"Bray-vo!\" exclaimed the bo's'n with enthusiasm, for he was a sympathetic man, though unprincipled in the matter of eavesdropping.  That cut it short.  They retired precipitately from the weather gangway abaft the main shrouds, and sought refuge in a sequestered nook near the companion-hatch, which was, in name as well as in every other way, much more suited to their circumstances.  The steersman had his eye on them there, but they fortunately did not know it.  Apologising for this reminiscence, we return to the thread of our story.  Mrs Davidson was seated at breakfast one morning, with all her family around her in Prairie Cottage.  She had named it thus because, from one of the windows, there was to be had a peep of the prairies lying beyond the bushes by which it was surrounded.  Old McKay had named his cottage Ben Nevis, either because the country around was as flat as a pancake, or out of sheer contradictiousness.  \"Have they found out anything more about the murder of that poor fellow Perrin?\" asked Mrs Davidson.  \"More than four months have passed since it happened.\"  \"Nothing more, mother,\" said Dan, who now filled his father's chair. \"As you say, four months have passed, and one would think that was time enough to discover the murderer, but, you see, it is nobody's business in particular, and we've no regular police, and everybody is far too busy just now to think about it.  In fact, not many people in these parts care much about a murder, I fear.\"  \"Ah if they went to see Perrin's old mother,\" said Jessie, \"it would oblige them to care a great deal, for he was her only son.\"  \"Ay, her only child!\" added Mrs Davidson.  While she was yet speaking, it so happened that Duncan McKay junior himself entered the room, with that over-done free-and-easiness which sometimes characterises a man who is ill at ease.  \"Whose only child are you speaking about, Mrs Davidson?\" he asked carelessly.  \"Mrs Perrin's,\" she replied, with a familiar nod to the visitor, who often dropped in on them casually in this way.  The reply was so unexpected and sudden, that McKay could not avoid a slight start and a peculiar expression, in spite of his usual self-command.  He glanced quickly at Dan and Peter, but they were busy with their food, and had apparently not noticed the guilty signs.  \"Ah, poor thing,\" returned the youth, in his cynical and somewhat nasal tone, \"it _iss_ hard on her.  By the way, Dan, hev ye heard that the wolves hev killed two or three of McDermid's horses that had strayed out on the plains, and Elspie's mare Vixen iss out too.  Some of us will be going to seek for her.  The day bein' warm an' the snow soft, we hev a good chance of killin' some o' the wolves.  I thought Peter might like to go too.\"  \"So Peter does,\" said the youth, rising and brushing the crumbs off his knees: \"there's nothing I like better than to hunt down these sneaking, murderous brutes that are so ready to spring suddenly unawares on friend or foe.\"  Again Duncan McKay cast a quick inquiring glance at Peter, but the lad was evidently innocent of any double meaning.  It was only a movement, within the man-slayer, of that conscience which \"makes cowards of us all.\"  \"Louise!\" shouted Dan, as he also rose from the table.  \"Oui, monsieur,\" came, in polite deferential tones, from the culinary department, and the little half-breed maiden appeared at the door.  \"Did you mend that shot-bag last night?\"  \"Oui, monsieur.\"  \"Fetch it here, then, please; and, Jessie, stir your stumps like a good girl, and get some food ready to take with us.\"  \"Will you tell me the precise way in which good girls stir their stumps?\" asked Jessie; \"for I'm not quite sure.\"  Dan answered with a laugh, and went out to saddle his horse, followed by his brother and Duncan McKay.  \"Rescuing seems to be the order of the day this year,\" remarked Peter, as they walked towards the stable behind the cottage.  \"We've had a good deal of rescuing men in the winter, and now we are goin' to rescue horses.\"  \"Rescuing is the grandest work that a fellow can undertake,\" said Dan, \"whether it be the body from death or the soul from sin.\"  \"What"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23372"],["title","The Buffalo Runners: A Tale of the Red River Plains (#8)"],["body"," you say iss true--whatever,\" remarked McKay, whose speech, although not so broad as that of his father, was tinged with similar characteristics.  \"It will be better to rescue than to kill.\"  This was so obvious a truism that his companions laughed, but Duncan had uttered it almost as a soliloquy, for he was thinking at the moment of poor Perrin, whose body had long since been brought to the Settlement and buried.  Indeed thoughts of the murdered man were seldom out of his mind.  Meanwhile, far out on the lonesome and still snow-covered prairie the steed which they were going to rescue stood on a low mound or undulation of the plain surrounded by wolves.  It was a pitiful sight to see the noble mare, almost worn-out with watching and defending herself, while the pack of those sneaking hounds of the wilderness sat or stood around her licking their chops and patiently biding their time.  They formed a lean, gaunt, savage-looking crew, as they sat there, calculating, apparently, how long their victim's strength would hold out, and when it would be safe to make a united and cowardly rush.  One wolf, more gaunt and rugged and grey than the others, with black lips and red tongue and bloodshot eyes, moved about the circle uneasily as if trying to screw up its craven spirit to the sticking point.  The others evidently regarded this one as their leader, for they hung back from him a little, and kept a watchful eye on his movements.  So did Vixen, the mare.  She kept her tail always turned towards him, looking savagely back at him with her great eyes glittering, her ears laid flat, and her heels ready.  Poor Vixen!  Elspie had given her the name when in a facetious frame of mind, as being descriptive of the very opposite of her character, for she was gentle as a lamb, tender in the mouth, playful in her moods, and sensitive to a degree both in body and spirit.  No curb was ever needed to restrain Vixen, nor spur to urge her on.  A chirp sent an electric thrill through her handsome frame; a \"Quiet, Vic!\" sufficed to calm her to absolute docility.  Any child could have reined her in, and she went with springy elasticity as though her limbs were made of vivified steel and indiarubber.  But she was getting old, and somehow the wolves seemed to be aware of that melancholy fact.  They would not have troubled her in the heyday of her youth!  An impatient howl from one of the pack seemed to insinuate that the grey old leader was a coward.  So he was, but evidently he did not relish being told so, for he uncovered his glittering fangs and made a sudden dash at the mare.  With a whisk of the tail worthy of her best days, she lashed out behind and planted both her pretty little feet on the ribs of the grey chief with such a portentous whack that he succumbed at once.  With a gasp, and a long-drawn wail, he sank dead upon the snow; whereupon his amiable friends--when quite sure of his demise--tore him limb from limb and devoured him.  This was a fortunate respite for Vixen, most of whose remaining strength and pluck had been thrown into that magnificent fling.  Old Duncan, had he seen it, would probably have styled it a \"goot Highland fling.\"  But the respite was not of long duration.  Their leader formed but a mouthful to each of the pack.  When done, they returned to encircle their victim again, lick their chops, and wait.  Evening was drawing on, and a sort of grey desolation seemed to be creeping over the plains.  A decided thaw had been operating all that day, rendering the snow soft. If the mare had only known the advantage thus given to her, a successful effort at escape might have been made.  When snow on the prairie is frozen with a hard crust on the surface, the light wolf can run easily on the top of it, while the heavy horse breaks through at every stride and is soon knocked up.  The case is reversed when a thaw softens the surface, for then the short-legged wolf flounders helplessly in its depths, while the long-limbed and powerful horse can gallop through it with comparative ease.  But the good mare, intelligent though she was, did not consider this fact, and the wolves, you may be sure, did not enlighten her.  Besides, by that time she was well-nigh worn-out, and could not have made a vigorous run for life even over a good course.  Gradually, a worthy lieutenant of the old grey chief began to show symptoms of impatience, and the hungry circle closed in.  Vixen looked up and whinnied slightly.  It seemed a pitiful appeal for help from the human friends who had cared for her so well and so long.  Perchance it was the last wail of despair--a final farewell to the green fields and the flowering plains of memory.  Whatever it was, an answer came in the form of several dark specks on the horizon.  Vixen saw them, and whinnied again in a decidedly different tone.  The wolves also saw them, and moved about uneasily.  On came the black specks, increasing in size as they drew near.  The wolves looked at each other inquiringly, moved still more uneasily, appeared to hold a consultation, and finally drew off to a neighbouring knoll, as if to await the result of this unlooked-for interruption, and return to business when it was past.  The intelligence of the lower animals is great--in some cases very great--but it does not amount to reason.  If it did, those wolves would not have sat there, in the pride of physical strength and personal freedom, calmly awaiting their doom, while Daniel and Peter Davidson, Duncan McKay junior, Okematan the Cree Indian, another Indian named Kateegoose, and Jacques Bourassin, a half-breed, came thundering down towards them like infuriated centaurs.  At last they seemed to realise the truth that \"discretion is the better part of valour,\" and began to retire from the scene--slowly at first.  Vixen, recognising friends, trotted off with reviving strength, and a high head and tail to meet them.  Seeing this, Dan, who led the party, drew rein so as to allow the steeds to recover breath before the final burst.  The wolves, with that presumption which is usually found to be the handmaid of ignorance, halted, and sat down again to watch the progress of events.  Fatal self-confidence!  They little knew the deep duplicity of man!  \"O you stupid brutes!\" murmured Dan to himself, advancing in a somewhat sidling manner as if he meant to pass them.  They evidently believed this to be his intention until they saw the six horsemen turn their steeds straight in their direction and charge them at full gallop with a yell that drove rapid conviction to their brains.  Then, with tails between legs and ears flat they fled.  But it was too late.  The horses scattered the soft snow with comparative ease.  The wolves plunged through it with difficulty.  First to overtake them was Peter Davidson.  He put the muzzle of his gun to the side of the grey lieutenant, and shot him through the heart.  His brother Dan, selecting another of the pack, pointed at the ear and blew out its brains. Okematan, partial to the weapons of his forefathers, sent an arrow through the ribs of a third, while Kateegoose transfixed a fourth. Duncan McKay shot a fifth, and Bourassin knocked over a sixth at comparatively long range, his horse being too poor or too tired to come fairly up with the pack.  There was no wasting of powder, shot, or shaft in this affair.  Each man was an expert with his weapon, and cool as the proverbial cucumber, though considerably excited.  Loading as they ran, they fitted and shot again, stretching six more of the enemy on the plain.  Then they pulled up and suffered the rest to escape, being afraid to leave Vixen out of sight behind them, for that happy creature, following and enjoying the sport as long as she could, found that her powers were too much exhausted to permit of her keeping up with the chase.  \"She's not fit to travel another mile,\" said Dan, stroking her glossy neck and allowing her to rub her nose affectionately on his shoulder.  \"That iss true, whatever,\" assented Duncan.  \"I think we could not do better than camp on the nearest bluff.\"  This was agreed to by all.  Provision for one meal, it will be remembered, had been prepared at Prairie Cottage in the morning.  A hunter's meal, when properly divided, makes two or three average meals, and a hunter's powers of endurance are proverbial.  Each man had his blanket strapped to his saddle.  Branches of various kinds of trees make a good mattress, and the air of the prairie is well-known to conduce to appetite and slumber.  With such environment it is scarcely necessary to add that the hunters enjoyed themselves, and that Vixen had a restful night, probably without even a dream about hungry wolves.    CHAPTER EIGHT.  STIRRING EVENTS DESCRIBED.  The proverbial slip 'twixt the cup and the lip, and the well-known uncertainty of all human affairs, received striking illustration in the person and prospects of our hero, Daniel Davidson, not long after the events narrated in the last chapter.  Up to this period the unfortunate colonists of the Red River Settlement had led a life chiefly of disappointment and disaster.  Although everything had been done for them by their patron the Earl of Selkirk with the best intentions, the carrying out of his plans had been frustrated by the feuds of the rival fur companies, the misunderstandings and the jealousies of Indians and half-breeds, and, to some extent, by the severity of the climate.  An open rupture took place between them and the North-westers.  Encounters between the contending parties occurred, in which several on both sides were killed, and at last the North-Westers, attacking the settlers in force, drove them from the colony and burnt their dwellings and homesteads.  Retreating to the north end of Lake Winnipeg, the colonists found refuge at Jack River--three hundred miles distant.  From this place they were ultimately recalled by the Hudson's Bay Company, which took them under its protection.  Returning to Red"]]]
