He seemed as if he had been clothed in a dark skin-tight dress.  But the most conspicuous part about him was the top of his head, on which there seemed to be a large turban, which, on closer inspection, turned out to be his own hair curled and fizzed out artificially. Altogether he was an imposing and gigantic fellow.  When about fifty yards from the shore, the savages checked the canoe's progress and stood up.  Now was the time for action, so, according to previous arrangement, the sailors laid their weapons down on the beach, and held up their hands, at the same time making such signs of friendship as they thought would be understood.  The savages, who were quick-witted fellows, at once ran the canoe ashore, leaped out, and hastened towards the white men.  As they did so, Captain Dall put his telescope to his eye for a moment, wishing to scan closely the features of the chief.  Instantly the whole band turned with a howl, and, making towards the canoe, jumped in and pushed off.  \"Ha!\" exclaimed the captain, with a smile, \"these fellows have been fired at by Europeans before now.  They evidently mistook my telescope for a musket.\"  The savages paused, and again faced about at a short distance from the beach, and the captain sought by every imaginable sign and gesticulation to remove the bad impression he had so innocently created.  He succeeded.  In a short time the natives again landed and advanced towards them.  On drawing near, the chief stopped and made a short speech--which, of course, none of the white men understood.  To this Captain Dall replied in a short speech--which, of course, none of the natives understood.  Both parties looked very amiably, however, at each other, and by degrees drew closer together, when the natives began to manifest much curiosity in reference to the costume of the sailors. Soon they became more familiar, and the truth of the proverb, that, \"familiarity breeds contempt,\" was quickly illustrated by one of the savages seizing hold of the musket which Larry O'Hale carried.  The hot blood of the Irishman instantly fired.  \"Let go, ye dirty bit o' mahogany,\" he cried, holding the musket tight with his left hand, and clenching his right in a threatening manner.  Captain Dall, foreseeing what would be the result of a blow, sought to create a diversion by raising his telescope to his eye.  The quick-sighted savage observed the motion, let go his hold of the musket and shrank behind his comrades, who, however, did not appear disposed to screen him, for they all began to dodge behind each other until the telescope was lowered.  The temporary distraction of attention which this incident caused emboldened another savage to pounce upon the other musket, which was carried by old Bob.  He wrenched it out of the sailor's hand and bounded away with a shout, swinging it over his head.  Unfortunately his fingers touched the trigger and the piece exploded, knocking down the man who held it, and sending the ball close past the chief's ear.  Instantly there followed a loud yell, clubs were brandished, cutlasses gleamed, and blood would certainly have been spilt had not Captain Dall suddenly seized the chief by the shoulders and rubbed noses with him. He knew this to be the mode of salutation among some of the South Sea tribes, and sought to make a last effort at conciliation.  The act was reciprocated by the chief, who signed to his men to forbear.  Captain Dall now felt convinced that any undecided course of action would only render their case more desperate, so he turned to his men with a look of authority and said sternly--  \"My lads, we have only one hope left to us, and that is, submission. Throw down your weapons, and put your trust in the Almighty.\"  The men obeyed--some with hesitation and others sullenly; they flung their cutlasses on the sand and crossed their arms on their breasts.  No sooner was this done than the savages rushed upon them in overwhelming numbers, and they were instantly overpowered.  Larry O'Hale and Will Osten, with some of the younger men, struggled fiercely, and knocked down several of their opponents before they were subdued, but against such overwhelming odds they had no chance.  It would have been better for them had they acted on the captain's advice.  Whatever is worth doing is worth doing well, and this truth is not less applicable to the act of submission than to that of resistance.  The only result of their ill-timed display of valour was the tighter fastening of the cords with which the savages bound them hand and foot, and somewhat rough handling when they, with their comrades, were tossed into the bottom of the canoe.  After the sailors were secured, the natives collected the provisions that had been brought by them to the island, and stowed these also in the canoe.  This occupied a considerable time, for they were so careful to avoid missing anything, that they ranged over the whole island, examining every part minutely, and leaving nothing behind that had the slightest appearance of value in their eyes.  During all this time the white men were left lying in the water which had leaked into the canoe. Indeed, the valiant Larry would certainly have been drowned, but for the aid extended to him by our hero, for he chanced to have been thrown into the canoe with his face downwards near the stern, and as the water gradually settled down there from the prow, which was raised on the sand, it covered his mouth.  Fortunately Will, who was near him, managed to assist the unfortunate man in his struggles so as to enable him to rest his head on the blade of a paddle!  When everything belonging to the crew of the _Foam_ had been collected, the savages returned to their canoe, re-launched her, paddled out to sea, and ere long left the little coral island out of sight behind them.    CHAPTER NINE.  CONTAINS AN ACCOUNT OF THE DESPERATE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE PRISONERS.  Five hours passed away, during which the savages continued to paddle almost without intermission, and our hero with his friends lay fast bound in the bottom of the canoe.  They suffered great pain from the swelling of their limbs and the tightening of the cords that bound them; but although Larry O'Hale, in the exasperation of his spirit, gave vent to one or two howls, accompanied by expressions that were the reverse of complimentary, no attention was paid to them until the island towards which they steered was reached.  The instant the canoe touched the sand the captives were lifted out-- their hands and feet were tied together in a bunch, and, each being slung on a stout pole as one might sling a bundle, they were carried up to a native village on the margin of a wood.  On the way, Wandering Will could see that the beach swarmed with natives--a fact, however, of which his ears had already assured him, for the air was filled with yells of delight as the captives were successively lifted out of the canoe.  He also observed that the island appeared to be a large one, for he got a glimpse of a huge mountain rising over the tree tops.  Neither he nor any of his comrades, however, had time to make many observations, for they were hurried up the beach and into the village, where they were thrown down under a rudely built hut which was covered with broad leaves.  Here the cords that fastened them were unloosed; but if this for a moment raised the hope that they were about to be set free, they were quickly undeceived by the savages, who rebound their hands behind them. Our hero, Captain Dall, Mr Cupples, Larry O'Hale, and Muggins, were then fastened with cords of cocoa-nut fibre to the several posts of the hut in such a manner that they could stand up or lie down at pleasure. George Goff, old Bob, and the others were led away.  Seeing that they were about to be separated, Captain Dall suddenly called out, \"Farewell, lads,\" in a tone so sad, that Goff looked back at him in surprise, but his captors forced him away before he could reply.  \"You think we won't see them again?\" said Osten, when they were left alone.  \"I think not.  From what I know of those savages, I fear they have taken our comrades away to be sacrificed, and that our own time will soon come.\"  Something between a groan and a growl escaped from O'Hale when this was said.  \"Cudn't we break thim ropes, and run amuck amongst the murtherin' blackguards,\" he exclaimed, seizing the rope that bound him with his teeth and endeavouring to tear it--an effort which it is needless to say was futile, and nearly cost him a tooth.  \"It's of no use, Larry,\" said the captain; \"we can't help ourselves.  If the Lord don't help us, we're dead men.\"  Although Will Osten was much depressed, not to say alarmed, by what he heard, he could not help wondering why the captain had so suddenly lost his buoyant spirit.  At the time when a slow death by starvation had stared him in the face, he had not only retained his own heartiness of spirit, but had kept up wonderfully the spirits of his companions.  Now, however--when, as Will thought, they had the chance of escaping by stratagem or by force from their captors, or, at the worst, of selling their lives dearly--his spirit seemed to have utterly forsaken him.  Yet the captain was only despondent--not despairing.  He had seen the deeds of savages in former years, and knew that with them there was seldom a long period between the resolve to kill and the accomplishment of the crime.  He feared for the lives of his shipmates, and would have given his right hand at that moment to have been free to aid them, but the attempts of himself and his comrades to break their bonds were fruitless, so, after making one or two desperate efforts, they sat down doggedly to await their fate.  It might have been a curious study to have noted the different spirit in which these unfortunate men submitted to their unavoidable doom on that occasion.

Ballantyne.  ________________________________________________________________________ In this book Ballantyne has brilliantly woven the story of a family that worked on the building of the Eddystone lighthouse, with the story of the actual building.  Three successive attempts were made to build a lighthouse on this dangerous rock which lies several miles off the south coast of Devon, and on which so many fine ships making their way up the English Channel to the North Sea ports of Europe had been wrecked.  The first attempt was made in the early years of the eighteenth century, but that lighthouse did not last long.  The second was made by Rudyerd, and was very well made and strong, but its upperworks were made of timber, and the whole thing was destroyed by fire, after having shown a light for over a third of a century.  There was an amusing episode during the construction of the Rudyerd lighthouse when a French warship took all the construction workers prisoner, and made off with them to France.  Luckily Louis, the King of France, heard of this and was quite incensed, ordering the British prisoners to be released and treated as hospitably as possible, while the captain of the warship was to be cast into the prison.  The final construction was by a mathematical instrument maker, of all people, called Smeaton.  His lighthouse was even more soundly founded than even Rudyerd's had been, and he used the fact that stone is heavier than timber to add weight to the building, thus rendering it more resistant to the forces of wind and water.  It was not only succesful as a lighthouse, but it has lasted to this day, well over two centuries, and has ever since it was completed been a highly-regarded example of the art of lighthouse building.  ________________________________________________________________________ THE STORY OF THE ROCK, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.    CHAPTER ONE.  WRECK OF WINSTANLEY'S LIGHTHOUSE.  \"At mischief again, of course: always at it.\"  Mrs Potter said this angrily, and with much emphasis, as she seized her son by the arm and dragged him out of a pool of dirty water, into which he had tumbled.  \"Always at mischief of one sort or another, he is,\" continued Mrs Potter, with increasing wrath, \"morning, noon, and night--he is; tumblin' about an' smashin' things for ever he does; he'll break my heart at last--he will.  There: take that!\"  \"That,\" which poor little Tommy was desired to take, was a sounding box on the ear, accompanied by a violent shake of the arm which would have drawn that limb out of its socket if the child's bones and muscles had not been very tightly strung together.  Mrs Potter was a woman of large body and small brain.  In respect of reasoning power, she was little better than the wooden cuckoo which came out periodically from the interior of the clock that stood over her own fireplace and announced the hours.  She entertained settled convictions on a few subjects, in regard to which she resembled a musical box.  If you set her going on any of these, she would harp away until she had played the tune out, and then begin over again; but she never varied. Reasons, however good, or facts, however weighty, were utterly powerless to penetrate her skull: her \"settled convictions\" were not to be unsettled by any such means.  Men might change their minds; philosophers might see fit to alter their opinions; weaklings of both sexes and all ages might trim their sails in accordance with the gales of advancing knowledge, but Mrs Potter--no: never! _her_ colours were nailed to the mast.  Like most people who unite a strong will with an empty head, she was \"wiser in her own conceit than eleven men that can render a reason:\" in brief, she was obstinate.  One of her settled convictions was that her little son Tommy was \"as full of mischief as a hegg is full of meat.\"  Another of these convictions was that children of all ages are tough; that it does them good to pull them about in a violent manner, at the risk even of dislocating their joints.  It mattered nothing to Mrs Potter that many of her female friends and acquaintances held a different opinion.  Some of these friends suggested to her that the hearts of the poor little things were tender, as well as their muscles and bones and sinews; that children were delicate flowers, or rather buds, which required careful tending and gentle nursing.  Mrs Potter's reply was invariably, \"Fiddlesticks!\" she knew better.  They were obstinate and self-willed little brats that required constant banging.  She knew how to train 'em up, she did; and it was of no manner of use, it wasn't, to talk to _her_ upon that point.  She was right.  It was of no use.  As well might one have talked to the wooden cuckoo, already referred to, in Mrs Potter's timepiece.  \"Come, Martha,\" said a tall, broad-shouldered, deep-voiced man at her elbow, \"don't wop the poor cheeld like that.  What has he been doin'--\"  Mrs Potter turned to her husband with a half angry, half ashamed glance.  \"Just look at 'im, John,\" she replied, pointing to the small culprit, who stood looking guilty and drenched with muddy water from hands to shoulders and toes to nose.  \"Look at 'im: see what mischief he's always gittin' into.\"  John, whose dress bespoke him an artisan, and whose grave earnest face betokened him a kind husband and a loving father, said:--  \"Tumblin' into dirty water ain't necessarily mischief.  Come, lad, speak up for yourself.  How did it happen--\"  \"I felled into the water when I wos layin' the foundations, faither,\" replied the boy; pointing to a small pool, in the centre of which lay a pile of bricks.  \"What sort o' foundations d'ye mean, boy?\"  \"The light'ouse on the Eddystun,\" replied the child, with sparkling eyes.  The man smiled, and looked at his son with interest.  \"That's a brave boy,\" he said, quietly patting the child's head.  \"Get 'ee into th'ouse, Tommy, an' I'll show 'ee the right way to lay the foundations o' the Eddystun after supper.  Come, Martha,\" he added, as he walked beside his wife to their dwelling near Plymouth Docks, \"don't be so hard on the cheeld; it's not mischief that ails him.  It's engineerin' that he's hankerin' after.  Depend upon it, that if he is spared to grow up he'll be a credit to us.\"  Mrs Potter, being \"of the same opinion still,\" felt inclined to say \"Fiddlesticks!\" but she was a good soul, although somewhat highly spiced in the temper, and respected her husband sufficiently to hold her tongue.  \"John;\" she said, after a short silence, \"you're late to-night.\"  \"Yes,\" answered John, with a sigh.  \"My work at the docks has come to an end, an' Mr Winstanley has got all the men he requires for the repair of the light'ouse.  I saw him just before he went off to the rock to-night, an' I offered to engage, but he said he didn't want me.\"  \"What?\" exclaimed Mrs Potter, with sudden indignation: \"didn't want you--you who has served 'im, off an' on, at that light'ouse for the last six year an' more while it wor a buildin'!  Ah, that's gratitood, that is; that's the way some folk shows wot their consciences is made of; treats you like a pair of old shoes, they does, an' casts you off w'en you're not wanted: hah!\"  Mrs Potter entered her dwelling as she spoke, and banged the door violently by way of giving emphasis to her remark.  \"Don't be cross, old girl,\" said John, patting her shoulder: \"I hope _you_ won't cast me off like a pair of old shoes when you're tired of me!  But, after all, I have no reason to complain.  You know I have laid by a good lump of money while I was at work on the Eddystone; besides, we can't expect men to engage us when they don't require us; and if I had got employed, it would not have bin for long, being only a matter of repairs.  Mr Winstanley made a strange speech, by the way, as the boat was shoving off with his men.  I was standin' close by when a friend o' his came up an' said he thowt the light'ouse was in a bad way an' couldn't last long.  Mr Winstanley, who is uncommon sure o' the strength of his work, he replies, says he--`I only wish to be there in the greatest storm that ever blew under the face of heaven, to see what the effect will be.'  Them's his very words, an'it did seem to me an awful wish--all the more that the sky looked at the time very like as if dirty weather was brewin' up somewhere.\"  \"I 'ope he may 'ave 'is wish,\" said Mrs Potter firmly, \"an' that the waves may--\"  \"Martha!\" said John, in a solemn voice, holding up his finger, \"think what you're sayin'.\"  \"Well, I don't mean no ill; but, but--fetch the kettle, Tommy, d'ye hear? an' let alone the cat's tail, you mischievous little--\"  \"That's a smart boy,\" exclaimed John rising and catching the kettle from his son's and, just as he was on the point of tumbling over a stool: \"there, now let's all have a jolly supper, and then, Tommy, I'll show you how the real foundation of the Eddystun was laid.\"  The building to which John Potter referred, and of which he gave a graphic account and made a careful drawing that night, for the benefit of his hopeful son, was the _first_ lighthouse that was built on the wild and almost submerged reef of rocks lying about fourteen miles to the south-west of Plymouth harbour.  The highest part of this reef, named the Eddystone, is only a few feet above water at high tide, and as it lies in deep water exposed to the full swell of the ocean, the raging of the sea over it in stormy weather is terrible beyond conception.  Lying as it does in the track of vessels coasting up and down the English Channel, it was, as we may easily believe, a source of terror, as well as of danger, to mariners, until a lighthouse was built upon it.  But a lighthouse was talked of long before any attempt was made to erect one.  Important though this object was to the navies of the world, the supposed impossibility of the feat, and the danger apprehended in the mere attempt, deterred any one from undertaking the task"]]]
