But Michael is hardly a personage in our story, and we do not purpose to enter into the diagnosis of his case. He has our sympathies on the merit of his sufferings alone, and quite as much for Nellie's sake; for it was tender, and gentle, and kind in her to feel so much for a poor Irish laborer. While she and Donald were talking about the case, Mr. Hasbrook came down stairs, and passed through the hall into the library, where he, also, had left his hat. In a few moments more the rattle of his wagon was heard, as he drove off, indignant and disgusted at the indifference of the nabob in refusing to take an interest in his brilliant enterprise. He was angry with himself for having paid his note before he had enlisted the payee in his cause.  \"How is he, father?\" asked Nellie, as Captain Patterdale entered the hall.  \"The doctor thinks he sees some favorable symptoms.\"  \"Will he die?\"  \"The doctor thinks he will get over it. But he wants some ice, and I must get it for him.\"  \"I suppose you will not go in the Sea Foam now?\" asked Donald.  \"No; it is impossible,\" replied the captain, as he passed into the dining-room to the refrigerator.  The father was like the daughter; and though he was a _millionnaire_, or a _demi-millionnaire_--we don't know which, for we were never allowed to look over his taxable valuation--though he was a nabob, he took right hold, and worked with his own hands for the comfort and the recovery of the sufferer. It was creditable to his heart that he did so, and we never grudge such a man his \"pile,\" especially when he has earned it by his own labor, or made it in honorable, legitimate business. The captain went up stairs again with a large dish of ice, to assist the doctor in the treatment of his patient.  Donald staid in the hall, talking with Miss Nellie, as long as he thought it proper to do so, though not as long as he desired, and then entered the library where he, also, had left his hat. Perhaps it was a singular coincidence that all three of the visitors had left their hats in that room; but then it was not proper for them to sit with their hats on in the presence of such a magnate as Captain Patterdale, and no decent man would stop for a hat when a person had fallen in a fit.  Captain Patterdale's hat was still there; and, unluckily, there was something else belonging to him which was not there.     CHAPTER II.  ABOUT THE TIN BOX.   Captain Patterdale worked with the doctor for a full hour upon poor Michael, who at the end of that time opened his eyes, and soon declared that he was \"betther entirely.\" He insisted upon getting up, for it was not \"the likes of himself that was to lay there and have his honor workin' over him.\" But the doctor and the nabob pacified him, and left him, much improved, in the care of his wife.  \"How is he, Dr. Wadman?\" asked the sympathizing Nellie, as they came down stairs together.  \"He is decidedly better,\" replied the physician.  \"Will he die?\"  \"O, no; I think not. His case looks very hopeful now.\"  \"I thought folks always died with sun-stroke,\" said Nellie, more cheerfully.  \"No; not unless their heads are very soft,\" laughed the doctor.  \"Well, I shouldn't think Laud Cavendish would dare to go out when the sun shines,\" added the fair girl, with a snap of her bright eyes.  \"It isn't quite safe for him to do so. Unfortunately, such people don't know their own heads. I will come in again after tea,\" said the doctor, as he went out of the house, at the front door; for he had not left his hat in the library.  \"I am so glad Michael is better!\" continued Nellie. \"When I saw him drop, I felt as cold as ice, and I was afraid I should drop too before I could get to the library.\"  \"Did you see him fall, Nellie?\" asked her father.  \"Yes; he gave a kind of groan, and then fell; he was--\"  \"Gracious!\" exclaimed Captain Patterdale, interrupting her all of a sudden.  He turned on his heel, and walked rapidly into the library. Nellie was startled, and was troubled with a suspicion that her father had a _coup de soleil_, or _coup de_ something-else; for he did not often do anything by fits and starts. She followed him into the library. It was a fact that the captain had left his hat there; but it was not for this article, so necessary in a hot day, that he hastened thus abruptly into the room. Nellie found him flying around the apartment in a high state of excitement for him. He was looking anxiously about, and seemed to be very much disturbed.  \"What in the world is the matter, father?\" asked Nellie.  \"Where is your mother?\"  \"She has gone over to Mrs. Rodman's.\"  \"Hasn't she been back?\"  \"No, certainly not; I was just going over to tell her what had happened to Michael, when you came down.\"  \"Who has been in here, Nellie?\"  \"I don't know that anybody has. I haven't seen any one. What's the matter, father? what in the world has happened?\"  \"I left my tin box here when I went out to see to Michael, and now it is gone,\" answered Captain Patterdale, anxiously. \"I didn't know but that your mother had come in and taken care of it.\"  \"The tin box gone?\" exclaimed Nellie. \"Why, what can have become of it?\"  \"That is just what I should like to know,\" added the captain, as he renewed his search in the room for the treasure chest.  It was not in the library, and then he looked in the great hall and in the little hall, in the drawing-room, the sitting-room, and the dining-room; but it was not in any of these. He knew he had left it on the chair near where he was sitting when he went out of the room. Then he examined the spring-lock on the door of the library which led into the side street. It was closed and securely fastened. The door shut itself with a patent invention, and when shut it locked itself, so that anybody could get out, but no one could get in unless admitted.  \"Where were you when I was up stairs, Nellie?\" asked Captain Patterdale, as he seated himself in his arm-chair, to take a cool view of the whole subject.  \"I was in the hall most of the time,\" she replied.  \"Who has been in the library?\"  \"Let me see; Laud Cavendish came down first, and went out through the library.\"  The captain rubbed his bald head, and seemed to be asking himself whether it was possible for Mr. Laud Cavendish to do so wicked a deed as stealing that tin box. He did not believe the young swell had the baseness or the daring to commit so great a crime. It might be, but he could not think so.  \"Who else has been in here?\" he inquired, when he had hastily considered all he knew about the moral character of Laud.  \"That other man who was with you--I don't know his name--the one that was here when I came in with Don John.\"  \"Mr. Hasbrook.\"  \"He went out through the library. I thought he looked real ugly too,\" added Nellie. \"He kept fidgeting about all the time I was here.\"  \"And all the time he was here himself. He went out through the library--did he?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  Captain Patterdale mentally overhauled the character of Mr. Hasbrook. It was unfortunate for his late debtor that his character was not first class, and between him and Laud Cavendish the probabilities were altogether against Hasbrook. He had evidently been vexed and angry because he failed to carry his point, and his cupidity might have been stimulated by revenge. But the captain was a fair and just man, and in a matter of this kind, involving the reputation of any person, he kept his suspicions to himself.  \"Who else has been in the library, Nellie?\" he asked.  \"No one but Don John,\" replied she. And whatever Laud or Hasbrook might have done in wickedness, Nellie had too much regard for her friend and schoolmate to admit for one instant the possibility of his doing anything wrong, much less his committing so gross a crime as the stealing of the tin box and its valuable contents.  Captain Patterdale was hardly less confident of the integrity of Donald. Certainly it was not necessary to suspect him when the possibilities of guilt included two such persons as Laud and Hasbrook. Donald was rather distinguished, in school and out, as a good boy, and he ought to have the full benefit of his reputation.  \"You don't think Don John took the box--do you, father?\" asked Nellie, as her father was meditating on the circumstances.  \"Certainly not, Nellie,\" protested the captain, warmly; \"I don't know that anybody has taken it.\"  \"I know Don John would not do such a thing.\"  \"I don't believe he would.\"  \"I know he would not.\"  Her father thought she was just a little more earnest in her uncalled-for defence of the young man than was necessary, and for the first time in his life it occurred to him that she was more interested in him than he wished her to be; for, as Donald was only the son of a poor boat-builder, such a strong friendship might be embarrassing in the future. However, this was only the shadow of a passing thought, which divided his attention only for a moment. The loss of the tin box was the question of the hour, and \"society\" topics were not just then in order.  \"I have no idea that Don John took the box,\" replied Captain Patterdale. \"I am more willing to believe either of the other two who were in the library took it than that he did. But he was the last of the three who went out through this room. He may be able to give me some information, and I will go down and see him. He and his father were going off in the new yacht--were they not?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"You need not say a word about the box to any one, Nellie, nor even that it is lost,\" added the captain. \"If I do not find it, I shall employ a skilful detective to look it up, and he may prefer to work in the dark.\"  \"I will not mention it, father,\" replied Nellie. \"What was in the box? Was it money?\"  \"I put thirteen hundred and fifty dollars into it, but I took out twenty to pay the bill that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23351"],["title","The Yacht Club; or, The Young Boat-Builder (#3)"],["body"," brought. It contains my deeds, leases, policies of insurance, and my notes, and these papers are really more valuable to me than the money. Luckily, my bonds and securities are in another box, in the vault of the bank.\"  \"Then you will lose over thirteen hundred dollars if you don't find the box?\"  \"More than that, I am afraid, for I shall hardly be able to collect all the money due on the notes if I lose them,\" replied the captain, as he left the house.  He walked down to the boat shop of Mr. Ramsay. It was on the shore, and near it was the house in which the boat-builder lived. Neither Don John nor his father was at the shop, but a sloop yacht, half a mile out in the bay, seemed to be the Sea Foam. She was headed towards the shore, however, and Captain Patterdale seated himself in the shade of the shop to await its arrival, though he hardly expected to obtain any information in regard to the box from Donald. While he was sitting there, Mr. Laud Cavendish appeared with a large basket in his hand. The counter-jumper started when he turned the corner of the shop, and saw the nabob seated there.  \"Going a-fishing?\" asked the captain.  \"Yes, sir; I'm going over to Turtle Head to camp out over Sunday,\" replied Laud. \"How is Michael, sir?\"  \"He is much better, and is doing very well.\"  \"I'm glad of it,\" added Laud, as he carried his basket down to a sail-boat which was partly aground, and deposited it in the forward cuddy.  Captain Patterdale wanted to talk with Laud, but he did not like to excite any suspicions on his part. If the young man had taken the box he would not be likely to go off on an island to stay over Sunday. Besides, it was evident from the position of the boat, and the fact that it contained several articles necessary for a fishing excursion, in addition to those in the basket, that Laud had made his arrangements for the trip before he visited the library of the elegant mansion. If he had taken the box, he would probably have changed his plans. It was not likely, therefore, that Laud was the guilty party.  \"Are you going alone?\" asked the captain, walking down the beach to the boat.  \"Yes, sir; I couldn't get any one to go with me. I tried Don John, but he won't go off to stay over Sunday,\" replied Laud, with a sickly grin.  \"I commend his example to you. I don't think it is a good way to spend Sunday.\"  \"It's the only time I can get to go. I've been trying to got off for a month.\"  \"Saturday must be a bad time for you to leave,\" suggested the captain.  \"It is rather bad,\" added Laud, as he shoved off the bow of the boat, for he seemed to be in haste to get away.  \"By the way, Laud, did you notice a tin box in my library when you were there this afternoon?\" asked the nabob, with as much indifference in his manner and tone as he could command.  \"A tin box?\" repeated Laud, busying himself with the jib of the sail-boat.  \"Yes; it was painted green.\"  \"I don't remember any box,\" answered Laud.  \"Didn't you see it? I opened it to take out the money I paid you.\"  \"I didn't mind. I was receipting the bill while you were getting the money ready. You know I sat down at your desk.\"  \"Yes; I know you did; but didn't you see the box?\"  \"No, sir; I don't remember seeing any box,\" said Laud, still fussing over the sail, which certainly did not need any attention.  \"You went out through the library when you came down from Michael's room--didn't you?\" continued the captain.  \"Yes, sir; I did. I left my hat in there.\"  \"Did you see the box then?\"  \"Of course I didn't. If I had, I should have remembered it,\" replied Laud, with a grin. \"I just grabbed my hat, and ran, for I had been in the house some time; and I got a blessing for being away so long when I went back to the store.\"  \"You didn't see the box, then?\"  \"If it was there, I suppose I saw it; but I didn't take any notice of it. Why? is the box lost?\"  \"I want to get another like it. Haven't you anything of the sort in the store?\"  \"We have some cake and spice boxes. They are tin, and painted on the outside.\"  \"Those will not answer the purpose. It's a very hot day,\" added the captain, as he wiped the perspiration from his face, and walked back to the shade of the shop.  Mr. Laud Cavendish stepped into the sail-boat, hoisted the sails, and shoved her off into deep water with an oar. Captain Patterdale thought, and then he did not know what to think. Was it possible Laud had not noticed that tin box, which had been on a chair out in the middle of the room? If he had not, why, then he had not; but if he had Laud had more cunning, more self-control, and more ingenuity than the captain had ever given him the credit, or the discredit, of possessing, for there was certainly no sign of guilt in his tone or his manner, except that he did not look the inquirer square in the face when he answered his questions, though some guilty people can even do this without wincing.  Captain Patterdale watched the departing and the approaching boats, still considering the possible relation of Laud Cavendish to the tin box. If the fellow had stolen it, he would not go off on an island to stay over Sunday, leaving the box behind to betray him; and this argument seemed to be conclusive in his favor. The captain had looked into the boat, and satisfied himself that the box was not there; unless it was in the basket, which appeared to contain so many other things that there was no room for it. On the whole, the captain was willing to acquit Mr. Laud Cavendish of the act, partly, perhaps, because this had been his first view of the matter. It was more probable that Hasbrook, angry and disappointed at his failure, had put the box into his wagon, and returned to the neighboring town, where, as before stated, his reputation was not first class, though, perhaps, not many people believed him capable of stealing outright, without the formality of getting up a mining company, or making a trade of some sort. But Donald had been the last of the trio of visitors who passed through the library, and the captain wanted to see him.  The Sea Foam, with snowy sails just from the loft, and glittering in her freshly-laid coat of white paint, ran up to a wharf just below the boat shop. Donald was at the helm, and he threw her up into the wind just before she came to the pier, so that when she forged ahead, with her sails shaking in the wind, her head came up within a few inches of the landing-place. Mr. Ramsay fended her off, and went ashore with a line in his hand, which he made fast to a ring. Captain Patterdale walked around to the wharf, as soon as he saw where she was to make a landing.  \"Well, how do you like her, Sam?\" said Donald to a young man of his own age in the standing-room with him.  \"First rate; and I hope your father will go to work on mine at once,\" replied the passenger.  \"You will lay down the keel on Monday--won't you, father?\"  \"What?\" asked Mr. Ramsay, who had seated himself on a log on the wharf.  \"You will lay down the keel of the boat for Mr. Rodman on Monday--won't you?\" repeated Donald.  \"Yes, if I am able; I don't feel very well to-day.\" And the boat-builder doubled himself up, as though he was in great pain.  The young man in the standing-room of the Sea Foam was Samuel Rodman, a schoolmate of Donald, whose father was a wealthy man, and had ordered another boat like the Skylark, which had been the model for the new yacht. He had come down to see the craft, and had been invited to take a sail in her; but an engagement had prevented him from going as far as Turtle Head, and the boat-builder and his son had returned to land him, intending still to make the trip. By this time Captain Patterdale had reached the end of the wharf. He went on board of the Sea Foam, and looked her over with a critical eye, and was entirely satisfied with her. He was invited to sail in her for as short a time as he chose, but he declined.  \"By the way, Donald, did you see the green tin box when you were in my library this afternoon?\" he asked, when all the topics relating to the yacht had been disposed of.  \"Yes, sir; I saw you take some money from it,\" replied Donald.  \"Then you remember the box?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Did you notice it when you came out--I mean, when you left the house?\"  \"I don't remember seeing it when I came out,\" answered Donald, wondering what these questions meant.  \"I want to get another box just like that one. Did you take particular notice of it?\"  \"No, sir; I can't say I did.\"  \"You didn't stay any time in the library after you came down from Michael's room, did you?\"  \"No, sir; I only went for my hat, and didn't stay there a minute.\"  \"And you didn't notice the tin box?\"  \"No, sir; I didn't see it at all when I came out.\"  \"Then of course you didn't see any marks upon it,\" added the captain, with a smile.  \"If I didn't see the box, I shouldn't have been likely to see the marks,\" laughed Donald. \"What marks were they, sir?\"  \"It's of no consequence, if you didn't see them. The box was in the library--wasn't it?--when you went out.\"  \"I don't know whether it was or not. I only know that I don't remember noticing it,\" said Donald, who thought the captain's question was a very queer one, after those he had just answered.  The nabob was no better satisfied with Donald's answers than he had been with those of Laud Cavendish, except that the former looked him full in the face when he spoke. He obtained no information, and went home to seek it at other sources.  \"I think I won't go out again, Donald,\" said Mr. Ramsay, when Captain Patterdale had left. \"I don't feel very well, and you may go alone.\"  \"Do you feel very sick, father?\" asked the son, in tones of sympathy.  \"No; but I think I will go into the house and take some medicine. You can run over to Turtle Head alone,\" added the boat-builder, as he walked towards the house.  \"Can't you go any how, Sam?\" said Donald, turning to his friend.  \"No, I must go home now. I have to drive over to Searsport after my sister,\" replied Sam, as"]]]
