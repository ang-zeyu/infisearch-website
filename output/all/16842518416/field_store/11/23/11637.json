She threw an arm round the neck of one, while she fed them in turn with carrots and apples which she had in her apron. She was a slightly-made girl, with dark hair and a sallow face. Her hair hung heavily about her shoulders. She might have been ten years old, but looked younger.  \"There's Nell,\" said the mother. \"I am sorry the colts are going, she has always made such pets of them. I never saw her take to any creatures before as she has done to those two, and they'll follow her anywhere like lambs. I'm sorry you've got to sell them, Guy.\"  \"Sorry!\" retorted the Squire, with a sort of snort. \"Didn't I tell you, Lucy, that Simmons has given me a cheque for three hundred and fifty pounds for the two. Of course, the creatures are thoroughbred, and may turn out worth a great deal more; still, in these days no one gives a fair price for anything, and three-fifty is not to be sneezed at when your rents are always behindhand and your balance at the bank is overdrawn.\"  The Squire left the room as he spoke, and Mrs. Lorrimer, with the faintest of little sighs, presently followed his example. Meanwhile, the girl in the paddock was having a thoroughly happy time. As soon as she had finished feeding her favourites, and they had done rubbing their noses against her face and shoulder, she looked eagerly round her, and saw with satisfaction that there was no one watching her from any of the many windows which blinked like eyes all over the old house. She now approached one of the colts cautiously, laid her hand on his neck, and with an adroit, quick movement sprang on his back. He was an untamed, unbroken-in creature. He would have submitted to no burden at all heavier or at all less dear than that of the slim child who had now mounted him.  \"Hey, Robin, dear,\" she said, bending forward, catching hold of a wisp of his mane and almost whispering into his ear, \"you'll take me round the paddock three times, won't you, as swift as the wind, and then it will be Joe's turn? As swift as you can fly you shall go, my bonny, bonny Robin. And afterwards you shall have your russet apple; it's in my pocket.\"  From the colt's attitude, he seemed perfectly to understand every word that was addressed to him. He pricked his ear; his eye glanced backward with loving intelligence. He pawed the ground impatiently--he would not be off until Nell gave the signal, but when it came there was no doubt that he would fly swiftly over the ground. Joe, the other colt, stood near expectantly. His turn was to come, he knew. For him, too, there would be the light weight of a loved little presence, followed by that delicious russet apple when the ride was over. Meanwhile, he would canter after Nelly and Robin, taking care not to go too near nor in any way to intrude himself mischievously.  \"Now,\" said Nell, sitting bolt upright, \"now, Robin--one, two, three, away!\"  Away they went truly, mane and hair alike flying in the breeze--Nell's short skirts puffed out by the wind, Nell's cheeks with red flames on them, and Nell's dark grey eyes blazing like subdued fires.  Once round the paddock they flew--twice they went--three times. The third round was the fastest and the most delirious of all. Nell was so sure of her seat, so confident in Robin's powers, that she no longer even clasped his arched neck. Up flew her hands in the air. The delirious excitement rendered her giddy.  \"Hurrah! hurrah!\" she shouted.  The gay words were interrupted by eager words from approaching spectators. The gate of the paddock was pushed open, and Kitty, aged nine, followed by Boris, who was only seven, rushed on the scene. The children were followed by a couple of grooms and a strange, horsey-looking man.  \"Oh, Nell, Nell!\" exclaimed Kitty.  \"They're sold, Nell,\" said Boris, in a gloomy voice. \"You'd better get down. That fellow there has come\"--waving his hand with immense dignity in the direction of the horsey man--\"that fellow has come to take them away; they're sold.\"  \"I don't believe it,\" said Nell.  Robin, who obeyed her slightest word, stood stock still when she told him. She dropped off his back with the lightness of a bird.  \"Who says they're sold?\" she asked. \"I don't believe it.\"  She pressed her hand to her heart as she spoke, a pang of keen pain had shot through it; she turned pale, and her eyes still blazed.  \"I don't believe it a bit,\" she said. \"I'll go and find father and ask him if its true; I know it isn't true.\"  \"There's father coming into the field,\" said Boris. \"Yes, it's true enough, but you can ask him.\"  \"Well, my man,\" said the Squire, who came upon the scene at this moment, \"your master has sent you for the colts, I suppose? Here they are, as----Why, what's the matter, Nell? How white you are, child, and--not so tight, Nell, not so tight, you're half strangling me! What is it, my love--what is it?\"  \"You haven't sold Robin and Joe, father?\"  \"Oh, now, my little girl\"--the Squire began to pat Nell's trembling hands soothingly. He looked hard into her quivering face, then, bending down, whispered something in her ear.  No one else heard the words.  Nell's frantic grasp relaxed; she let her hands fall to her sides and looked piteously round.  Robin and Joe had both followed her across the paddock. Robin expected his russet apple--Joe looked for his canter with Nell on his back.  \"There's a brave little girl,\" said her father. \"'Pon my word, I wouldn't do it if I could help it.\"  \"No, father dear; of course not.\"  \"You're a plucky young 'un,\" said her father admiringly. Boris and Kitty came close; the grooms and the horse-dealer also approached. There was a sort of ring round Nell and the colts.  \"Please, father, may I give Robin his apple?\" she asked. \"He has earned it. May he have it?\"  The Squire nodded.  \"Of course he may,\" he said; then he turned to the horse dealer.  \"My little girl is fond of these creatures,\" he said. \"I hope you will have patience for a moment or two.\"  The man touched his hat respectfully.  \"Certainly, sir,\" he answered, \"as long as the young lady likes; there's no manner of hurry, and perhaps little miss would like to have another canter. I never see'd no one sit so bird-like on a horse--never, in the whole of my born days.\"  \"Do you hear that, Nell?\" said her father. \"Would you like another canter? I didn't know you could ride bare-backed.\"  She smiled up at him, a perfectly brave smile; there were no tears in her eyes, although there were black shadows under them, and her face was as white as a little snowflake.  Robin munched his apple, and Joe came close to Nell and rubbed his head against her shoulder.  She fed him also, to his own great surprise, for he did not think that he had earned a morsel, and then, without a word, turned and walked out of the paddock.  Boris ran after her.  \"I say, Nell!\" he exclaimed, panting. \"Would you like a white rat? I have four, and I--I'll give you one if you'll promise not to forget to feed it.\"  Nell stood still when Boris made this offer, and looked down into his ruddy, brown, sunburnt face. Boris had bright eyes, as round as two moons. The giving up of one of his white rats meant a great deal to him. Nell carefully weighed the value of the offer.  \"No,\" she said at last in a deliberate tone. \"I might forget to feed the rat, and I don't think I ever could love it; but thank you all the same, Boris.\"  \"Don't mention it,\" said Boris, in his most polite tone; he was immensely relieved by Nell's declining his offer.  She walked slowly towards the house, and Boris turned to Kitty, who had followed him.  \"I offered her a rat,\" he said; \"but she wouldn't have it. Do you think she will be very bad for a bit?\"  \"Yes, I do,\" said Kitty. \"She'll creep up into one of the lofts and burrow in the hay all by herself, and if she can have a right good cry perhaps she'll be better, but if she hasn't a cry, she'll fret awfully, and perhaps she'll turn sulky; but never mind about her now. I'm ever so glad she didn't take the rat. Let's run and feed them before we go to lessons.\"  \"I wish there were no lessons,\" said Boris. \"I hate them. I can't think what use they are. What can it matter in a big world like this, crowded up with boys and girls and men and women, whether I can spell right or not? _I_ don't mind, and I don't see why anyone else should bother.\"  \"I like spelling,\" said Kitty, who had a very intelligent face. \"If I were a man or an embryo man, which you are, Boris, I'd have ambition, and I'd try to get on. I'd like to walk over the heads of the other boys, if I were you, and to take their prizes from them, and to have father and mother looking on, and a lot of grand ladies and gentlemen all dressed in their best praising and cheering and bowing and smiling. But boys are no good in these days. It's girls who do everything. Now, do be quick and let's feed the rats.\"  \"You talk such nonsense,\" said Boris. \"You don't suppose that ladies and gentlemen care whether boys and girls spell words right or not, and what rubbish you do say about best clothes and smiling and bowing.\"  \"I don't,\" said Kitty, crossly; \"it's you who talk rubbish. You have never been to school, so you can't possibly tell. You ask Nan Thornton, and she'll soon tell you what's done at school. Oh dear, oh dear, I wish I were at Lavender House instead of doing my lessons with stupid Jane Macalister!\"  \"You talk very dis'pectful,\" said Boris.  \"Do I? I don't care. Oh, I _am_ glad you didn't part with the white rat!\"     CHAPTER V.  NOT MISSED.   Jane Macalister was the governess. She was old--at least the Lorrimers considered her old--she wore spectacles, and her hair was slightly tinged with grey. She had a queer mixture of qualities. She was affectionate and narrow; she was devoted to her pupils, and thought she could best show her devotion by an unceasing round of discipline. Fortunately, both for her and the little Lorrimers, this discipline never extended beyond the hours devoted"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23022"],["title","Red Rose and Tiger Lily; Or, In a Wider World (#5)"],["body"," lessons. It never showed its stern visage in play hours, nor at meals, nor at night, nor on half holidays, nor on Sundays. During all these times, Jane was the intelligent and much belaboured companion. She was at everyone's beck and call. She was to be found here, there, and everywhere--darning the rent in Molly's frock, or helping Nora with her drawing, or trying to find a story-book for Nell which she had not already read at least six times, or healing the small squabbles with which Boris and Kitty helped to beguile the weary hours. Mrs. Lorrimer consulted her with regard to the cook and the servants generally. The Squire would shout to her to spare him a quarter of an hour in the study to see if he had totted up his accounts right. In short, Jane Macalister was as much part and parcel of the Lorrimer household as if she were really one of themselves. She was by no means educated up to the standard of the latter half of the nineteenth century, but what she did know, she knew thoroughly. She was methodical and helpful. The kind of person whom Mrs. Lorrimer was fond of quoting as invaluable. The children, one and all, loved her as a matter of course, but, in school hours, their love was certainly mingled with awe. In school hours, Jane allowed no relaxing of the iron rod.  Kitty and Boris, having just heard the dismal sound of the schoolroom bell, started from their fascinating occupation of feeding the white rats and ran as fast as their small feet could carry them in the direction of the house. They went in by a side entrance, and with panting breath and hot little steps began to mount the spiral staircase which led to the schoolroom in the tower. They were late already, and they knew that they could not possibly escape bad marks for unpunctuality. They pushed open the green baize door which admitted them to the sanctum of learning and came in. All the other children whom Miss Macalister taught were already in the room. Kitty and Boris were the sole delinquents--the only ones in disgrace; even Elinor was present. Their faces fell when they saw her. They had built great hopes on having at least Elinor's company in their disgrace. The swift thought had darted through both their minds that she would be safe to be extra naughty that morning, and in consequence would divert some of the storm of Jane Macalister's wrath from their devoted heads; but no, there she sat in her accustomed place, her hymn book open on her knee, marks of tears on her cheeks, it is true, but in all other respects she looked a provokingly model Elinor.  It was too bad; Kitty made a face at her across the schoolroom, and even Boris gave her a reproachful glance.  Jane Macalister fixed two awful spectacled eyes upon the culprits, and, scarlet blushes tingling in their cheeks, they took possession of their vacant chairs.  The children all sang their usual hymn, although Elinor's voice was a little husky and Boris held his book upside down.      \"_All things bright and beautiful,       All creatures great and small,     All things wise and wonderful,       The Lord God made them all._\"  \"I wonder if He really made that dreadful horsey man,\" thought Nell, as she looked out of the window.  Boris smothered a sigh as he reflected again over the problem which had often before puzzled his small head--Why God, when he made everything so beautiful, had forgotten to give Jane Macalister a beautiful temper in school hours?  The singing was followed by the Bible reading, and then lessons began. Molly and Nora acquitted themselves admirably, as was their wont--Nell's dark grey eyes grew full of interest as she read the fascinating story of the \"Field of the Cloth of Gold\" in her history book--Kitty worked at her sums with fierce persistence and tried to fancy herself at boarding-school, going up rapidly to the top of her class, while Boris made more mistakes than ever over his dictation, and inked his fingers unmercifully.  \"What was the use of fussing over such a stupid, useless thing as spelling?\" This was his thought of thoughts.  The day was a warm one. Jane Macalister was icily cold, however, as unapproachable as an iceberg. Boris watched her with anxiety. He knew well that there was no chance for him and Kitty; they would both be punished for being late for prayers.  Oh, dear, oh, dear; _why_ was Jane so unbeautiful, so unapproachable in school hours?  \"I know she'll keep Kitty and me in during the whole of the play hour,\" he muttered to himself. \"I'm certain of it, because the tip of her nose is getting red; that's a sign that she's worried, and when she's worried she's twice as bad as she is at any other time.\"  \"What noise is that? Oh!--I say--Miss Macalister----\"  Jane Macalister was always spoken to in this correct fashion during school hours.  \"I say, there's a visitor!\" burst from the eager lips of the little boy.  He started to his feet as he spoke, upsetting the ink-pot over his own copybook and also over Kitty's white-frilled pinafore.  \"Boris, you are incorrigible!\" exclaimed Jane. \"You lose all your conduct marks for the week, and must stay indoors for an hour and learn a piece of poetry after lessons.\"  Boris got very red and tried to smile. The blow had fallen, so he wasn't going to whimper over it. He would stand up to his punishment like a man. He meant to be a soldier some day, and felt exactly now as if he were facing the guns. He met Elinor's full, troubled grey eyes, and seated himself slowly once more in his chair.  The steps had come nearer, the schoolroom door was burst open, and Nan Thornton rushed in.  \"Here I am,\" she said. \"I have come to torment you, Miss Macalister, and to beg off lessons at once. How do you do, children? How are you, Kitty? How are you, Boris? How do you do, Nell? Molly and Nora, I'll kiss you when I can get breath. Oh, what a climb those stairs are! Why do you have lessons in the tower? All the same, it's lovely when you _are_ here. What a view! What a darling, darling, heavenly, scrumptious, _ripping_ view. Oh, dear! oh, dear! I am out of breath. Jane, aren't you glad to see me? Aren't you glad to know that all the children are to have a holiday immediately? Shut up your books, young 'uns, and let's be off. You don't mind, do you, Jane?\"  Certainly Jane Macalister did mind. The icy expression grew more marked on her face. Boris gave her a glance, felt that he was very close to the guns, and lowered his eyes. Nan began dancing about the room. Nan was in white--white hat, white frock. Her fluffy golden hair surrounded her like a cloud. Boris felt that she was something like a very naughty and very beautiful angel. Why was she tempting them all when Jane Macalister was like ice?  \"I think, Nan,\" said Miss Macalister--\"(how do you do, my dear? Of course I'm glad to see you)--I think I must ask you to leave the schoolroom for the present. Recess will be at half-past eleven, and then you can talk to all the children except Boris, who I grieve to say will have to undergo punishment. As to holidays, the summer holidays will begin in a fortnight, until then I cannot permit any such indulgence. Go away, Nan, for the present. Molly, I can attend to your German now. Bring your exercise book with the grammar and history.\"  Nan was not accustomed to being vanquished, but she was very near defeat then. The next moment she would have found herself ignominiously outside the baize door if other steps had not approached, and Hester, looking cool and sweet, Annie, all radiant and laughing, and Mrs. Lorrimer, with her usual gentle motherly expression, had not appeared on the scene.  \"Jane,\" said the mother, smiling round with her blue eyes at each of the children, \"Hester wants us to get up a hasty picnic to Friar's Wood. The day is perfect, and this is the first of Nan's holidays, so I hope you will not object, particularly if the children promise to work extra well to-morrow.\"  Jane began to close up all the books hastily. Nan's petition was not to be listened to for a moment. Mrs. Lorrimer's was law, and must be cheerfully obeyed.  \"Certainly,\" she said, in a pleasant tone, dropping her frozen manner as if by magic. \"It is a _perfect_ day for a picnic. Leave the schoolroom tidy, my loves, and then go and get ready. You'd like me to see the cook, wouldn't you, Mrs. Lorrimer? I can help her to cut sandwiches and to pack plates and dishes.\"  \"Jane, you're an angel,\" said Mrs. Lorrimer.  Jane Macalister kissed Hester, was introduced to Annie, and then rushed down the spiral stairs, intent on housekeeping cares.  The Lorrimer boys and girls surrounded Hester and Annie. Nan flitted in and out of the group, and was here, there, and everywhere. All was excitement and laughter. Presently the children left the schoolroom in a body.  No, there was one exception. Boris stayed behind. He looked wistfully after the others as they streamed away. Miss Macalister had not said a word about remitting his punishment, and he must be true to his colours. He found it very difficult to keep back his tears, but he would indeed think badly of himself if even one bright drop fell from his round blue eyes.  It would have comforted him if Kitty had noticed him. Kitty might have stayed if only to bestow a kiss of sympathy on him, but she was whirled on with the others. No one gave him a thought. He was only Boris, one of the younger children. He was alone in the schoolroom.  He looked at the clock; it pointed to half past eleven; he would not be free until half past twelve. Picnics at the Towers were hastily improvised affairs. Long before his hour of punishment was over the others would all be off and away. It was scarcely likely that any of them would even miss him. Kitty would be in such a frantic state of excitement at having Nan Thornton to talk to, that she would not have room in her heart to bestow a thought on him. He could not walk all the way to Friar's Wood, the day was too hot. How delicious it would be there in the shade. How"]]]
