Just try them on!\"--She stretched her hand,       \"Oh what a nice and lovely fit!     No fairer hand, in all the land,       And lo! the bracelet matches it.\"      Dazzled the pedlar on her gazed       Till came the shadow of a fear,     While she the bracelet arm upraised       Against the sun to view more clear.     Oh she was lovely, but her look       Had something of a high command     That filled with awe. Aside she shook       Intruding curls by breezes fanned     And blown across her brows and face,       And asked the price, which when she heard     She nodded, and with quiet grace       For payment to her home referred.      \"And where, O maiden, is thy house?       But no, that wrist-ring has a tongue,     No maiden art thou, but a spouse,       Happy, and rich, and fair, and young.\"     \"Far otherwise, my lord is poor,       And him at home thou shalt not find;     Ask for my father; at the door       Knock loudly; he is deaf, but kind.     Seest thou that lofty gilded spire       Above these tufts of foliage green?     That is our place; its point of fire       Will guide thee o'er the tract between.\"      \"That is the temple spire.\"--\"Yes, there       We live; my father is the priest,     The manse is near, a building fair       But lowly, to the temple's east.     When thou hast knocked, and seen him, say,       His daughter, at Dhamaser Ghat,     Shell-bracelets bought from thee to-day,       And he must pay so much for that.     Be sure, he will not let thee pass       Without the value, and a meal,     If he demur, or cry alas!       No money hath he,--then reveal,      \"Within the small box, marked with streaks       Of bright vermilion, by the shrine,     The key whereof has lain for weeks       Untouched, he'll find some coin,--'tis mine.     That will enable him to pay       The bracelet's price, now fare thee well!\"     She spoke, the pedlar went away,       Charmed with her voice, as by some spell;     While she left lonely there, prepared       To plunge into the water pure,     And like a rose her beauty bared,       From all observance quite secure.      Not weak she seemed, nor delicate,       Strong was each limb of flexile grace,     And full the bust; the mien elate,       Like hers, the goddess of the chase     On Latmos hill,--and oh, the face       Framed in its cloud of floating hair,     No painter's hand might hope to trace       The beauty and the glory there!     Well might the pedlar look with awe,       For though her eyes were soft, a ray     Lit them at times, which kings who saw       Would never dare to disobey.      Onwards through groves the pedlar sped       Till full in front the sunlit spire     Arose before him. Paths which led       To gardens trim in gay attire     Lay all around. And lo! the manse,       Humble but neat with open door!     He paused, and blest the lucky chance       That brought his bark to such a shore.     Huge straw ricks, log huts full of grain,       Sleek cattle, flowers, a tinkling bell,     Spoke in a language sweet and plain,       \"Here smiling Peace and Plenty dwell.\"      Unconsciously he raised his cry,       \"Shell-bracelets ho!\" And at his voice     Looked out the priest, with eager eye,       And made his heart at once rejoice.     \"Ho, _Sankha_ pedlar! Pass not by,       But step thou in, and share the food     Just offered on our altar high,       If thou art in a hungry mood.     Welcome are all to this repast!       The rich and poor, the high and low!     Come, wash thy feet, and break thy fast,       Then on thy journey strengthened go.\"      \"Oh thanks, good priest! Observance due       And greetings! May thy name be blest!     I came on business, but I knew,       Here might be had both food and rest     Without a charge; for all the poor       Ten miles around thy sacred shrine     Know that thou keepest open door,       And praise that generous hand of thine:     But let my errand first be told,       For bracelets sold to thine this day,     So much thou owest me in gold,       Hast thou the ready cash to pay?      \"The bracelets were enamelled,--so       The price is high.\"--\"How! Sold to mine?     Who bought them, I should like to know.\"       \"Thy daughter, with the large black eyne,     Now bathing at the marble ghat.\"       Loud laughed the priest at this reply,     \"I shall not put up, friend, with that;       No daughter in the world have I,     An only son is all my stay;       Some minx has played a trick, no doubt,     But cheer up, let thy heart be gay.       Be sure that I shall find her out.\"      \"Nay, nay, good father, such a face       Could not deceive, I must aver;     At all events, she knows thy place,       'And if my father should demur     To pay thee'--thus she said,--'or cry       He has no money, tell him straight     The box vermilion-streaked to try,       That's near the shrine.'\" \"Well, wait, friend, wait!\"     The priest said thoughtful, and he ran       And with the open box came back,     \"Here is the price exact, my man,       No surplus over, and no lack.      \"How strange! how strange! Oh blest art thou       To have beheld her, touched her hand,     Before whom Vishnu's self must bow,       And Brahma and his heavenly band!     Here have I worshipped her for years       And never seen the vision bright;     Vigils and fasts and secret tears       Have almost quenched my outward sight;     And yet that dazzling form and face       I have not seen, and thou, dear friend,     To thee, unsought for, comes the grace,       What may its purport be, and end?      \"How strange! How strange! Oh happy thou!       And couldst thou ask no other boon     Than thy poor bracelet's price? That brow       Resplendent as the autumn moon     Must have bewildered thee, I trow,       And made thee lose thy senses all.\"     A dim light on the pedlar now       Began to dawn; and he let fall     His bracelet basket in his haste,       And backward ran the way he came;     What meant the vision fair and chaste,       Whose eyes were they,--those eyes of flame?      Swift ran the pedlar as a hind,       The old priest followed on his trace,     They reached the Ghat but could not find       The lady of the noble face.     The birds were silent in the wood,       The lotus flowers exhaled a smell     Faint, over all the solitude,       A heron as a sentinel     Stood by the bank. They called,--in vain,       No answer came from hill or fell,     The landscape lay in slumber's chain,       E'en Echo slept within her cell.      Broad sunshine, yet a hush profound!       They turned with saddened hearts to go;     Then from afar there came a sound       Of silver bells;--the priest said low,     \"O Mother, Mother, deign to hear,       The worship-hour has rung; we wait     In meek humility and fear.       Must we return home desolate?     Oh come, as late thou cam'st unsought,       Or was it but an idle dream?     Give us some sign if it was not,       A word, a breath, or passing gleam.\"      Sudden from out the water sprung       A rounded arm, on which they saw     As high the lotus buds among       It rose, the bracelet white, with awe.     Then a wide ripple tost and swung       The blossoms on that liquid plain,     And lo! the arm so fair and young       Sank in the waters down again.     They bowed before the mystic Power,       And as they home returned in thought,     Each took from thence a lotus flower       In memory of the day and spot.      Years, centuries, have passed away,       And still before the temple shrine     Descendants of the pedlar pay       Shell bracelets of the old design     As annual tribute. Much they own       In lands and gold,--but they confess     From that eventful day alone       Dawned on their industry,--success.     Absurd may be the tale I tell,       Ill-suited to the marching times,     I loved the lips from which it fell,       So let it stand among my rhymes.     IV.  THE ROYAL ASCETIC AND THE HIND.  _From the Vishnu Purana. B. II. Chap. XIII._         MAITREYA. Of old thou gav'st a promise to relate     The deeds of Bharat, that great hermit-king:     Beloved Master, now the occasion suits,     And I am all attention.       PARASARA.             Brahman, hear.       With a mind fixed intently on his gods     Long reigned in Saligram of ancient fame,     The mighty monarch of the wide, wide world.     Chief of the virtuous, never in his life     Harmed he, or strove to harm, his fellow-man,     Or any creature sentient. But he left     His kingdom in the forest-shades to dwell,     And changed his sceptre for a hermit's staff,     And with ascetic rites, privations rude,     And constant prayers, endeavoured to attain     Perfect dominion on his soul. At morn,     Fuel, and flowers, and fruit, and holy grass,     He gathered for oblations; and he passed     In stern devotions all his other hours;     Of the world heedless, and its myriad cares,     And heedless too of wealth, and love, and fame.        Once on a time, while living thus, he went     To bathe where through the wood the river flows:     And his ablutions done, he sat him down     Upon the shelving bank to muse and pray.     Thither impelled by thirst a graceful hind,     Big with its young, came fearlessly to drink.     Sudden, while yet she drank, the lion's roar,     Feared by all creatures, like a thunder-clap     Burst in that solitude from a thicket nigh.     Startled, the hind leapt up, and from her womb     Her offspring tumbled in the rushing stream.     Whelmed by the hissing waves and carried far     By the strong current swoln by recent rain,     The tiny thing still struggled for its life,     While its poor mother, in her fright and pain,     Fell down upon the bank, and breathed her last.     Up rose the hermit-monarch at the sight     Full of keen anguish; with his pilgrim staff     He drew the new-born creature from the wave;     'Twas panting fast,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23245"],["title","Ancient Ballads and Legends of Hindustan (#8)"],["body"," but life was in it still.     Now, as he saw its luckless mother dead,     He would not leave it in the woods alone,     But with the tenderest pity brought it home.      There, in his leafy hut, he gave it food,     And daily nourished it with patient care,     Until it grew in stature and in strength,     And to the forest skirts could venture forth     In search of sustenance. At early morn     Thenceforth it used to leave the hermitage     And with the shades of evening come again,     And in the little courtyard of the hut     Lie down in peace, unless the tigers fierce,     Prowling about, compelled it to return     Earlier at noon. But whether near or far,     Wandering abroad, or resting in its home,     The monarch-hermit's heart was with it still,     Bound by affection's ties; nor could he think     Of anything besides this little hind,     His nursling. Though a kingdom he had left,     And children, and a host of loving friends,     Almost without a tear, the fount of love     Sprang out anew within his blighted heart,     To greet this dumb, weak, helpless foster-child,     And so, whene'er it lingered in the wilds,     Or at the 'customed hour could not return,     His thoughts went with it; \"And alas!\" he cried,     \"Who knows, perhaps some lion or some wolf,     Or ravenous tiger with relentless jaws     Already hath devoured it,--timid thing!     Lo, how the earth is dinted with its hoofs,     And variegated. Surely for my joy     It was created. When will it come back,     And rub its budding antlers on my arms     In token of its love and deep delight     To see my face? The shaven stalks of grass,     Kusha and kasha, by its new teeth clipped,     Remind me of it, as they stand in lines     Like pious boys who chant the Samga Veds     Shorn by their vows of all their wealth of hair.\"     Thus passed the monarch-hermit's time; in joy,     With smiles upon his lips, whenever near     His little favourite; in bitter grief     And fear, and trouble, when it wandered far.     And he who had abandoned ease and wealth,     And friends and dearest ties, and kingly power,     Found his devotions broken by the love     He had bestowed upon a little hind     Thrown in his way by chance. Years glided on....     And Death, who spareth none, approached at last     The hermit-king to summon him away;     The hind was at his side, with tearful eyes     Watching his last sad moments, like a child     Beside a father. He too, watched and watched     His favourite through a blinding film of tears,     And could not think of the Beyond at hand,     So keen he felt the parting, such deep grief     O'erwhelmed him for the creature he had reared.     To it devoted was his last, last thought,     Reckless of present and of future both!        Thus far the pious chronicle, writ of old     By Brahman sage; but we, who happier, live     Under the holiest dispensation, know     That God is Love, and not to be adored     By a devotion born of stoic pride,     Or with ascetic rites, or penance hard,     But with a love, in character akin     To His unselfish, all-including love.     And therefore little can we sympathize     With what the Brahman sage would fain imply     As the concluding moral of his tale,     That for the hermit-king it was a sin     To love his nursling. What! a sin to love!     A sin to pity! Rather should we deem     Whatever Brahmans wise, or monks may hold,     That he had sinned in _casting off_ all love     By his retirement to the forest-shades;     For that was to abandon duties high,     And, like a recreant soldier, leave the post     Where God had placed him as a sentinel.      This little hind brought strangely on his path,     This love engendered in his withered heart,     This hindrance to his rituals,--might these not     Have been ordained to teach him? Call him back     To ways marked out for him by Love divine?     And with a mind less self-willed to adore?      Not in seclusion, not apart from all,     Not in a place elected for its peace,     But in the heat and bustle of the world,     'Mid sorrow, sickness, suffering and sin,     Must he still labour with a loving soul     Who strives to enter through the narrow gate.     V.  THE LEGEND OF DHRUVA.  _Vishnu Purana. Book I. Chapter XI._       Sprung from great Brahma, Manu had two sons,     Heroic and devout, as I have said,     Pryavrata and Uttanapado,--names     Known in legends; and of these the last     Married two wives, Suruchee, his adored,     The mother of a handsome petted boy     Uttama; and Suneetee, less beloved,     The mother of another son whose name     Was Dhruva. Seated on his throne the king     Uttanapado, on his knee one day     Had placed Uttama; Dhruva, who beheld     His brother in that place of honour, longed     To clamber up and by his playmate sit;     Led on by Love he came, but found, alas!     Scant welcome and encouragement; the king     Saw fair Suruchee sweep into the hall     With stately step,--aye, every inch a queen,     And dared not smile upon her co-wife's son.     Observing him,--her rival's boy,--intent     To mount ambitious to his father's knee,     Where sat her own, thus fair Suruchee spake:     \"Why hast thou, child, formed such a vain design?     Why harboured such an aspiration proud,     Born from another's womb and not from mine?     Oh thoughtless! To desire the loftiest place,     The throne of thrones, a royal father's lap!     It is an honour to the destined given,     And not within thy reach. What though thou art     Born of the king; those sleek and tender limbs     Hold of my blood no portion; I am queen.     To be the equal of mine only son     Were in thee vain ambition. Know'st thou not,     Fair prattler, thou art sprung,--not, not from mine,     But from Suneetee's bowels? Learn thy place.\"      Repulsed in silence from his father's lap,     Indignant, furious, at the words that fell     From his step-mother's lips, poor Dhruva ran     To his own mother's chambers, where he stood     Beside her with his pale, thin, trembling lips,     (Trembling with an emotion ill-suppressed)     And hair in wild disorder, till she took     And raised him to her lap, and gently said:     \"Oh, child, what means this? What can be the cause     Of this great anger? Who hath given thee pain?     He that hath vexed thee, hath despised thy sire,     For in these veins thou hast the royal blood.\"      Thus conjured, Dhruva, with a swelling heart     Repeated to his mother every word     That proud Suruchee spake, from first to last,     Even in the very presence of the king.      His speech oft broken by his tears and sobs,     Helpless Suneetee, languid-eyed from care,     Heard sighing deeply, and then soft replied:     \"Oh son, to lowly fortune thou wert born,     And what my co-wife said to thee is truth;     No enemy to Heaven's favoured ones may say     Such words as thy step-mother said to thee.     Yet, son, it is not meet that thou shouldst grieve     Or vex thy soul. The deeds that thou hast done,     The evil, haply, in some former life,     Long, long ago, who may alas! annul,     Or who the good works not done, supplement!     The sins of previous lives must bear their fruit.     The ivory throne, the umbrella of gold,     The best steed, and the royal elephant     Rich caparisoned, must be his by right     Who has deserved them by his virtuous acts     In times long past. Oh think on this, my son,     And be content. For glorious actions done     Not in this life, but in some previous birth,     Suruchee by the monarch is beloved.     Women, unfortunate like myself, who bear     Only the name of wife without the powers,     But pine and suffer for our ancient sins.     Suruchee raised her virtues pile on pile,     Hence Uttama her son, the fortunate!     Suneetee heaped but evil,--hence her son     Dhruva the luckless! But for all this, child,     It is not meet that thou shouldst ever grieve     As I have said. That man is truly wise     Who is content with what he has, and seeks     Nothing beyond, but in whatever sphere,     Lowly or great, God placed him, works in faith;     My son, my son, though proud Suruchee spake     Harsh words indeed, and hurt thee to the quick,     Yet to thine eyes thy duty should be plain.     Collect a large sum of the virtues; thence     A goodly harvest must to thee arise.     Be meek, devout, and friendly, full of love,     Intent to do good to the human race     And to all creatures sentient made of God;     And oh, be humble, for on modest worth     Descends prosperity, even as water flows     Down to low grounds.\"                        She finished, and her son,     Who patiently had listened, thus replied:--      \"Mother, thy words of consolation find     Nor resting-place, nor echo in this heart     Broken by words severe, repulsing Love     That timidly approached to worship. Hear     My resolve unchangeable. I shall try     The highest good, the loftiest place to win,     Which the whole world deems priceless and desires.     There is a crown above my father's crown,     I shall obtain it, and at any cost     Of toil, or penance, or unceasing prayer.     Not born of proud Suruchee, whom the king     Favours and loves, but grown up from a germ     In thee, O mother, humble as thou art,     I yet shall show thee what is in my power.     Thou shalt behold my glory and rejoice.     Let Uttama my brother,--not thy son,--     Receive the throne and royal titles,--all     My father pleases to confer on him.     I grudge them not. Not with another's gifts     Desire I, dearest mother, to be rich,     But with my own work would acquire a name.     And I shall strive unceasing for a place     Such as my father hath not won,--a place     That would not know him even,--aye, a place     Far, far above the highest of this earth.\"      He said, and from his mother's chambers past,     And went into the wood where hermits live,     And never "]]]
