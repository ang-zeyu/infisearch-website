LTD.     FOREWORD   The story contained herein was written by Charles Dickens in 1867. It is the first of four stories entitled \"Holiday Romance\" and was published originally in a children's magazine in America. It purports to be written by a child aged eight. It was republished in England in \"All the Year Round\" in 1868. For this and four other Christmas pieces Dickens received Â£1,000.  \"Holiday Romance\" was published in book form by Messrs Chapman & Hall in 1874, with \"Edwin Drood\" and other stories.  For this reprint the text of the story as it appeared in \"All the Year Round\" has been followed.     THE TRIAL OF WILLIAM TINKLING   [Illustration]  This beginning-part is not made out of anybody's head, you know. It's real. You must believe this beginning-part more than what comes after, else you won't understand how what comes after came to be written. You must believe it all, but you must believe this most, please. I am the Editor of it. Bob Redforth (he's my cousin, and shaking the table on purpose) wanted to be the Editor of it, but I said he shouldn't because he couldn't. _He_ has no idea of being an editor.  [Illustration]  Nettie Ashford is my Bride. We were married in the right-hand closet in the corner of the dancing-school where first we met, with a ring (a green one) from Wilkingwater's toy-shop. _I_ owed for it out of my pocket-money. When the rapturous ceremony was over, we all four went up the lane and let off a cannon (brought loaded in Bob Redforth's waistcoat-pocket) to announce our nuptials. It flew right up when it went off, and turned over. Next day, Lieutenant-Colonel Robin Redforth was united, with similar ceremonies, to Alice Rainbird. This time the cannon bust with a most terrific explosion, and made a puppy bark.  My peerless Bride was, at the period of which we now treat, in captivity at Miss Grimmer's. Drowvey and Grimmer is the partnership, and opinion is divided which is the greatest Beast. The lovely bride of the Colonel was also immured in the Dungeons of the same establishment. A vow was entered into between the Colonel and myself that we would cut them out on the following Wednesday, when walking two and two.  Under the desperate circumstances of the case, the active brain of the Colonel, combining with his lawless pursuit (he is a Pirate), suggested an attack with fireworks. This however, from motives of humanity, was abandoned as too expensive.  Lightly armed with a paper-knife buttoned up under his jacket, and waving the dreaded black flag at the end of a cane, the Colonel took command of me at 2 P.M. on the eventful and appointed day. He had drawn out the plan of attack on a piece of paper which was rolled up round a hoop-stick. He showed it to me. My position and my full-length portrait (but my real ears don't stick out horizontal) was behind a corner-lamp-post, with written orders to remain there till I should see Miss Drowvey fall. The Drowvey who was to fall was the one in spectacles, not the one with the large lavender bonnet. At that signal I was to rush forth, seize my Bride, and fight my way to the lane. There, a junction would be effected between myself and the Colonel; and putting our Brides behind us, between ourselves and the palings, we were to conquer or die.  [Illustration]  [Illustration: Waving his black flag, the Colonel attacked.]  The enemy appeared--approached. Waving his black flag, the Colonel attacked. Confusion ensued. Anxiously I awaited my signal, but my signal came not. So far from falling, the hated Drowvey in spectacles appeared to me to have muffled the Colonel's head in his outlawed banner, and to be pitching into him with a parasol. The one in the lavender bonnet also performed prodigies of valour with her fists on his back. Seeing that all was for the moment lost, I fought my desperate way hand to hand to the lane. Through taking the back road, I was so fortunate as to meet nobody, and arrived there uninterrupted.  [Illustration]  It seemed an age, ere the Colonel joined me. He had been to the jobbing-tailor's to be sewn up in several places, and attributed our defeat to the refusal of the detested Drowvey to fall. Finding her so obstinate he had said to her in a loud voice, \"Die, recreant!\" but had found her no more open to reason on that point than the other.  My blooming Bride appeared, accompanied by the Colonel's Bride, at the Dancing-School next day. What? Was her face averted from me? Hah! Even so. With a look of scorn she put into my hand a bit of paper, and took another partner. On the paper was pencilled, \"Heavens! Can I write the word! Is my husband a Cow?\"  [Illustration: \"SEWN UP IN SEVERAL PLACES.\"]  In the first bewilderment of my heated brain I tried to think what slanderer could have traced my family to the ignoble animal mentioned above. Vain were my endeavours. At the end of that dance I whispered the Colonel to come into the cloak-room, and I showed him the note.  [Illustration]  \"There is a syllable wanting,\" said he, with a gloomy brow.  \"Hah! What syllable?\" was my inquiry.  \"She asks, Can she write the word? And no; you see she couldn't,\" said the Colonel, pointing out the passage.  \"And the word was?\" said I.  \"Cow--cow--coward,\" hissed the Pirate-Colonel in my ear, and gave me back the note.  Feeling that I must for ever tread the earth a branded boy--person I mean--or that I must clear up my honour, I demanded to be tried by a Court-Martial. The Colonel admitted my right to be tried. Some difficulty was found in composing the court, on account of the Emperor of France's aunt refusing to let him come out. He was to be the President. 'Ere yet we had appointed a substitute, he made his escape over the back wall, and stood among us, a free monarch.  [Illustration: The court was held on the grass by the pond.]  The court was held on the grass by the pond. I recognised in a certain Admiral among my judges my deadliest foe. A cocoa-nut had given rise to language that I could not brook. But confiding in my innocence, and also in the knowledge that the President of the United States (who sat next him) owed me a knife, I braced myself for the ordeal.  [Illustration: \"TWO EXECUTIONERS WITH PINAFORES REVERSED.\"]  It was a solemn spectacle, that court. Two executioners with pinafores reversed, led me in. Under the shade of an umbrella, I perceived my Bride, supported by the Bride of the Pirate-Colonel. The President (having reproved a little female ensign for tittering, on a matter of Life or Death) called upon me to plead, \"Coward or no Coward, Guilty or not Guilty?\" I pleaded in a firm tone, \"No Coward and Not Guilty.\" (The little female ensign being again reproved by the President for misconduct, mutinied, left the court, and threw stones.)  My implacable enemy, the Admiral, conducted the case against me. The Colonel's Bride was called to prove that I had remained behind the corner-lamp-post during the engagement. I might have been spared the anguish of my own Bride's being also made a witness to the same point, but the Admiral knew where to wound me. Be still my soul, no matter. The Colonel was then brought forward with his evidence.  It was for this point that I had saved myself up, as the turning-point of my case. Shaking myself free of my guards--who had no business to hold me, the stupids! unless I was found guilty--I asked the Colonel what he considered the first duty of a soldier? 'Ere he could reply, the President of the United States rose and informed the court that my foe the Admiral had suggested \"Bravery,\" and that prompting a witness wasn't fair. The President of the Court immediately ordered the Admiral's mouth to be filled with leaves, and tied up with string. I had the satisfaction of seeing the sentence carried into effect, before the proceedings went further.  I then took a paper from my trousers-pocket, and asked: \"What do you consider, Colonel Redforth, the first duty of a soldier? Is it obedience?\"  \"It is,\" said the Colonel.  \"Is that paper--please to look at it--in your hand?\"  \"It is,\" said the Colonel.  \"Is it a military sketch?\"  \"It is,\" said the Colonel.  \"Of an engagement?\"  \"Quite so,\" said the Colonel.  \"Of the late engagement?\"  \"Of the late engagement.\"  \"Please to describe it, and then hand it to the President of the Court.\"  From that triumphant moment my sufferings and my dangers were at an end. The court rose up and jumped, on discovering that I had strictly obeyed orders. My foe, the Admiral, who though muzzled was malignant yet, contrived to suggest that I was dishonoured by having quitted the field. But the Colonel himself had done as much, and gave his opinion, upon his word and honour as a Pirate, that when all was lost the field might be quitted without disgrace. I was going to be found \"No Coward and Not Guilty,\" and my blooming Bride was going to be publicly restored to my arms in a procession, when an unlooked-for event disturbed the general rejoicing. This was no other than the Emperor of France's aunt catching hold of his hair. The proceedings abruptly terminated, and the court tumultuously dissolved.  [Illustration: \"THE PIRATE-COLONEL WITH HIS BRIDE, AND YESTERDAY'S GALLANT PRISONER WITH HIS BRIDE.\"]  It was when the shades of the next evening but one were beginning to fall, 'ere yet the silver beams of Luna touched the earth, that four forms might have been descried slowly advancing towards the weeping willow on the borders of the pond, the now deserted scene of the day before yesterday's agonies and triumphs. On a nearer approach, and by a practised eye, these might have been identified as the forms of the Pirate-Colonel with his Bride, and of the day before yesterday's gallant prisoner with _his_ Bride."]]]
