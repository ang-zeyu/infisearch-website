Instantly, the sled shot skyward, heavy G’s pressing them down into the seats. The gun in Tanub’s hands was slammed into his lap. He struggled to raise it. To Orne, the weight was still only about twice that of his home planet of Chargon. He reached over, took the rifle, found safety belts, bound Tanub with them. Then he eased off the acceleration.  “We don’t need slaves,” said Orne. “We have machines to do our work. We’ll send experts in here, teach you people how to exploit your planet, how to build good transportation facilities, show you how to mine your minerals, how to—”  “And what do we do in return?” whispered Tanub.  “You could start by teaching us how you make superior glass,” said Orne. “I certainly hope you see things our way. We really don’t want to have to come down there and clean you out. It’d be a shame to have to blast that city into little pieces.”  Tanub wilted. Presently, he said: “Send me back. I will discuss this with ... our council.” He stared at Orne. “You I-A’s are too strong. We did not know.”         *       *       *       *       *  In the wardroom of Stetson’s scout cruiser, the lights were low, the leather chairs comfortable, the green beige table set with a decanter of Hochar brandy and two glasses.  Orne lifted his glass, sipped the liquor, smacked his lips. “For a while there, I thought I’d never be tasting anything like this again.”  Stetson took his own glass. “ComGO heard the whole thing over the general monitor net,” he said. “D’you know you’ve been breveted to senior field man?”  “Ah, they’ve already recognized my sterling worth,” said Orne.  The wolfish grin took over Stetson’s big features. “Senior field men last about half as long as the juniors,” he said. “Mortality’s terrific?”  “I might’ve known,” said Orne. He took another sip of the brandy.  Stetson flicked on the switch of a recorder beside him. “O.K. You can go ahead any time.”  “Where do you want me to start?”  “First, how’d you spot right away where they’d hidden the _Delphinus_?”  “Easy. Tanub’s word for his people was _Grazzi_. Most races call themselves something meaning _The People_. But in his tongue that’s _Ocheero_. _Grazzi_ wasn’t on the translated list. I started working on it. The most likely answer was that it had been adopted from another language, and meant _enemy_.”  “And _that_ told you where the _Delphinus_ was?”  “No. But it fitted my hunch about these Gienahns. I’d kind of felt from the first minute of meeting them that they had a culture like the Indians of ancient Terra.”  “Why?”  “They came in like a primitive raiding party. The leader dropped right onto the hood of my sled. An act of bravery, no less. Counting coup, you see?”  “I guess so.”  “Then he said he was High Path Chief. That wasn’t on the language list, either. But it was easy: _Raider Chief._ There’s a word in almost every language in history that means raider and derives from a word for road, path or highway.”  “Highwaymen,” said Stetson.  “Raid itself,” said Orne. “An ancient Terran language corruption of road.”  “Yeah, yeah. But where’d all this translation griff put—”  “Don’t be impatient. Glass-blowing culture meant they were just out of the primitive stage. That, we could control. Next, he said their moon was _Chiranachuruso_, translated as _The Limb of Victory_. After that it just fell into place.”  “How?”  “The vertical-slit pupils of their eyes. Doesn’t that mean anything to you?”  “Maybe. What’s it mean to you?”  “Night-hunting predator accustomed to dropping upon its victims from above. No other type of creature ever has had the vertical slit. And Tanub said himself that the _Delphinus_ was hidden in the best place in all of their history. History? That’d be a high place. Dark, likewise. Ergo: a high place on the darkside of their moon.”  “I’m a pie-eyed greepus,” whispered Stetson.  Orne grinned, said: “You probably are ... sir.”   THE END    Transcriber’s Notes: The table below lists all corrections applied to the original text.  p. 102: [normalized] ComGo -> ComGO p. 103: net of snakers -> sneakers p. 105: [removed extra quote] “Orne swallowed p. 111: [added closing quote] “A glass-blowing culture,”"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2323"],["title","Recollections and Letters of General Robert E.

I can remember some events of which he seemed a part, when we lived at Fort Hamilton, New York, about 1846, but they are more like dreams, very indistinct and disconnected--naturally so, for I was at that time about three years old. But the day of his return to Arlington, after an absence of more than two years, I have always remembered. I had a frock or blouse of some light wash material, probably cotton, a blue ground dotted over with white diamond figures. Of this I was very proud, and wanted to wear it on this important occasion. Eliza, my “mammy,” objecting, we had a contest and I won. Clothed in this, my very best, and with my hair freshly curled in long golden ringlets, I went down into the larger hall where the whole household was assembled, eagerly greeting my father, who had just arrived on horseback from Washington, having missed in some way the carriage which had been sent for him.  There was visiting us at this time Mrs. Lippitt, a friend of my mother’s, with her little boy, Armistead, about my age and size, also with long curls. Whether he wore as handsome a suit as mine I cannot remember, but he and I were left together in the background, feeling rather frightened and awed. After a moment’s greeting to those surrounding him, my father pushed through the crowd, exclaiming:  “Where is my little boy?”  He then took up in his arms and kissed--not me, his own child in his best frock with clean face and well-arranged curls--but my little playmate, Armistead! I remember nothing more of any circumstances connected with that time, save that I was shocked and humiliated. I have no doubt that he was at once informed of his mistake and made ample amends to me.  A letter from my father to his brother Captain S. S. Lee, United States Nave, dated “Arlington, June 30, 1848,” tells of his coming home:  “Here I am once again, my dear Smith, perfectly surrounded by Mary and her precious children, who seem to devote themselves to staring at the furrows in my face and the white hairs in my head. It is not surprising that I am hardly recognisable to some of the young eyes around me and perfectly unknown to the youngest. But some of the older ones gaze with astonishment "]]]
