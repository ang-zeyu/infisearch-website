He had been going to report to Webber when he had run into that golden field in the rooming-house hallway. And suddenly things had changed.  Harry felt a chill reaching to his fingers and toes. Yes, something had changed, all right. The attack on him had suddenly become butcherous, cruel, sneaking into his mind somehow to use his most dreaded nightmares against him. There was no telling what new horrors might be waiting for him. But he knew that he would lose his mind unless he could find an escape.  He was on his feet, his heart pounding. He had to get out of here, wherever he was. He had to get back to town, back to the city, back to where people were. If he could find a place to hide, a place where he could rest, he could try to think his way out of this ridiculous maze, or at least try to understand it.  He wrenched at the door to the passageway, started through, and smashed face-up against a solid brick wall.  He cried out and jumped back from the wall. Blood trickled from his nose. The door was _walled up_, the mortar dry and hard.  Frantically, he glanced around the room. There were no other doors, only the row of tiny windows around the ceiling of the room, pale, ghostly squares of light.  He pulled the chair over to the windows, peered out through the cobwebbed openings to the corridor beyond.  It was not the same hallway as before, but an old, dirty building corridor, incredibly aged, with bricks sagging away from the walls. At the end he could see stairs, and even the faintest hint of sunlight coming from above.  Wildly, he tore at the masonry of the window, chipping away at the soggy mortar with his fingers until he could squeeze through the opening. He fell to the floor of the corridor outside.  It was much colder and the silence was no longer so intense. He seemed to feel, rather than hear, the surging power, the rumble of many machines, the little, almost palpable vibrations from far above him.  He started in a dead run down the musty corridor to the stairs and began to climb them, almost stumbling over himself in his eagerness.  After several flights, the brick walls gave way to cleaner plastic, and suddenly a brightly lighted corridor stretched before him.  Panting from the climb, Harry ran down the corridor to the end, wrenched open a door, and looked out anxiously.  He was almost stunned by the bright light. At first he couldn't orient himself as he stared down at the metal ramp, the moving strips of glowing metal carrying the throngs of people, sliding along the thoroughfare before him, unaware of him watching, unaware of any change from the usual. The towering buildings before him rose to unbelievable heights, bathed in ever-changing rainbow colors, and he felt his pulse thumping in his temples as he gaped.  He was in the New City, of that there was no doubt. This was the part of the great metropolis which had been built again since the devastating war that had nearly wiped the city from the Earth a decade before. These were the moving streets, the beautiful residential apartments, following the modern neo-functional patterns and participational design which had completely altered the pattern of city living. The Old City still remained, of course--the slums, the tenements, the skid-rows of the metropolis--but this was the teeming heart of the city, a new home for men to live in.  And this was the stronghold where the not-men could be found, too. The thought cut through Harry's mind, sending a tremor up his spine. He had found them here; he had uncovered his first clues here, and discovered them; and even now his mind was filled with the horrible, paralyzing fear he had felt that first night when he had made the discovery. Yet he knew now that he dared not go back where he had come from.  At least he could understand why the not-men might have feared and persecuted him, but he could not understand the horrible assault that Dr. Webber had unleashed. And somehow he found Dr. Webber's attack infinitely more frightening.  He seemed to be safe here, though, at least for the moment.  Quickly he moved down onto the nearest moving sidewalk heading toward the living section of the New City. He knew where he could go there, where he could lock himself in, a place where he could think, possibly find a way to fight off Dr. Webber's attack of nightmares.  He settled back on a bench on the moving sidewalk, watching the city slide past him for several minutes before he noticed the curious shadow-form which seemed to whisk out of his field of vision every time he looked.  They were following him again! He looked around wildly as the sidewalk moved swiftly through the cool evening air. Far above, he could see the shimmering, iridescent screen that still stood to protect the New City from the devastating virus attacks which might again strike down from the skies without warning. Far ahead he could see the magnificent \"bridge\" formed by the sidewalk crossing over to the apartment area, where the thousands who worked in the New City were returning to their homes.  Someone was still following him.  Presently he heard the sound, so close to his ear he jumped, yet so small he could hardly identify it as a human voice. \"What was it you found, Harry? What did you discover? Better tell, better tell.\"  He saw the rift in the moving sidewalk coming, far ahead, a great, gaping rent in the metal fabric of the swiftly moving escalator, as if a huge blade were slicing it down the middle. Harry's hand went to his mouth, choking back a scream as the hole moved with incredible rapidity down the center of the strip, swallowing up whole rows of the seats, moving straight toward his own.  He glanced in fright over the side just as the sidewalk moved out onto the \"bridge,\" and he gasped as he saw the towering canyons of buildings fall far below, saw the seats tumble end over end, heard the sounds of screaming blend into the roar of air by his ears.  Then the rift screamed by him with a demoniac whine and he sank back onto his bench, gasping as the two cloven halves of the strip clanged back together again.  He stared at the people around him on the strip and they stared back at him, mildly, unperturbed, and returned to their evening papers as the strip passed through the first local station on the other side of the \"bridge.\"  Harry Scott sprang to his feet, moving swiftly across the slower strips for the exit channels. He noted the station stop vaguely, but his only thought now was speed, desperate speed, fear-driven speed to put into action the plan that had suddenly burst in his mind.  He knew that he had reached his limit. He had come to a point beyond which he couldn't fight alone.  Somehow, Webber had burrowed into his brain, laid his mind open to attacks of nightmare and madness that he could never hope to fight. Facing this alone, he would lose his mind. His only hope was to go for help to the ones he feared only slightly less, the ones who had minds capable of fighting back for him.  He crossed under the moveable sidewalks and boarded the one going back into the heart of the city. Somewhere there, he hoped, he would find the help he needed. Somewhere back in that city were men he had discovered who were men and something more.         *       *       *       *       *  Frank Manelli carefully took the blood pressure of the sleeping figure on the bed; then turned to the other man. \"He'll be dead soon,\" he snapped. \"Another few minutes now is all it'll take. Just a few more.\"  \"Absurd. There's nothing in these stimuli that can kill him.\" George Webber sat tense, his eyes fixed on the pale fluctuating screen near the head of the bed.  \"His own mind can kill him! He's on the run now; you've broken him loose from his nice safe paranoia. His mind is retreating, running back to some other delusions. It's escaping to the safety his fantasy people can afford him, these not-men he thinks about.\"  \"Yes, yes,\" agreed Dr. Webber, his eyes eager. \"Oh, he's on the run now.\"  \"But what will he do when he finds there aren't any 'not-men' to save him? What will he do then?\"  Webber looked up, frowning and grim. \"Then we'll know what he found behind the dark door that he opened, that's what.\"  \"No, you're wrong! He'll die. He'll find nothing and the shock will kill him. My God, Webber, you can't tamper with a man's mind like this and hope to save his life! You're obsessed; you've always been obsessed by this impossible search for something in our society, some undiscovered factor to account for the mental illness, the divergent minds, but you can't kill a man to trace it down!\"  \"It's too neat,\" said Webber. \"He comes back to tell us the truth, and we call him insane. We say he's paranoid, throw him in restraint, place him in an asylum; and we never _know_ what he found. The truth is too incredible; when we hear it, it must be insanity we're hearing.\"  The big doctor laughed, jabbing his thumb at the screen. \"This isn't insanity we're seeing. Oh, no, this is the answer we're following. I won't stop now. I've waited too long for this show.\"  \"Well, I say stop it while he's still alive.\"  Dr. Webber's eyes were deadly. \"Get out, Frank,\" he said softly. \"I'm not stopping now.\"  His eyes returned to the screen, to the bobbing figure that the psycho-integrator traced on the fluorescent background. Twenty years of search had led him here, and now he knew the end was at hand.     5   It was a wild, nightmarish journey. At every step, Harry's senses betrayed him: his wrist watch turned into a brilliant blue-green snake that snapped at his wrist; the air was full of snarling creatures that threatened him at every step. But he fought them off, knowing that they would harm him far less than panic would. He had no idea where to hunt, nor whom to try to reach, but he knew they were there in the New City, and somehow he knew they would help him, if only he could find them.  He got off the moving strip as soon as the lights of the center of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22869"],["title","The Dark Door (#4)"],["body"," city were clear below, and stepped into the self-operated lift that sped down to ground level. From the elevator, he moved on to one of the long, honeycombed concourses, filled with passing shoppers who stared at the colorful, enticing three-dimensional displays.  At one of the intersections ahead, he spotted a visiphone station, and dropped onto the little seat before the screen. There had been a number, if only he could recall it. But as he started to dial, the silvery screen shattered into a thousand sparkling glass chips, showering the floor with crystal and sparks.  Harry cursed, grabbed the hand instrument, and jangled frantically for the operator. Before she could answer, the instrument grew warm in his hand, then hot and soft, like wax. Slowly, it melted and ran down his arm.  He bolted out into the stream of people, trying desperately to draw some comfort from the crowd around him.  He felt utterly alone; he _had_ to contact the not-men who were in the city, warn them, before they spotted him, of the attack he carried with him. If he were leading his pursuer, he could expect no mercy from the ones whose help he sought. He knew the lengths to which they would go to remain undetected in the society around them. Yet he had to find them.  In the distance, he saw a figure waiting, back against one of the show windows. Harry stopped short, ducked into a doorway, and peered out fearfully. Their eyes locked for an instant; then the figure moved on. Harry felt a jolt of horror surge through him. Dr. Webber hunting him in person!  He ducked out of the doorway, turned and ran madly in the opposite direction, searching for an up escalator he could catch. Behind him he heard shots, heard the angry whine of bullets past his ear.  He breathed in great, gasping sobs as he found an almost empty escalator, and bounded up it four steps at a time. Below, he could see Webber coming too, his broad shoulders forcing their way relentlessly through the mill of people.  Panting, Harry reached the top, checked his location against a wall map, and started down the long ramp which led toward the building he had tried to call.  Another shot broke out behind him. The wall alongside powdered away, leaving a gaping hole. On impulse, he leaped into the hole, running through to the rear of the building as the weakened wall swayed and crumbled into a heap of rubble just as Webber reached the place Harry had entered.  Harry breathed a sigh of relief and raced up the stairs of the building to reach a ramp on another level. He turned his eyes toward the tall building at the end of the concourse. There he could hide and relax and try, somehow, to make a contact.  Someone fell into step beside him and took his arm gently but firmly. Harry jerked away, turning terrified eyes to the one who had joined him.  \"Quiet,\" said the man, steering him over toward the edge of the concourse. \"Not a sound. You'll be all right.\"  Harry felt a tremor pass through his mind, the barest touching of mental fingertips, a recognition that sent a surge of eager blood through his heart.  He stopped short, facing the man. \"I'm being followed,\" he gasped. \"You can't take me anywhere you don't want Webber to follow, or you'll be in terrible danger.\"  The stranger shrugged and smiled briefly. \"You're not here. You're in a psycho-integrator. It can hurt you, if you let it. But it can't hurt me.\" He stepped up his pace slightly, and in a moment they turned abruptly into a darkened cul-de-sac.  Suddenly, they were moving _through_ the wall of the building into the brilliantly lit lobby of the tall building. Harry gasped, but the stranger led him without a sound toward the elevator, stepped aboard with him, and sped upward, the silence broken only by the whish-whish-whish of the passing floors. Finally they stepped out into a quiet corridor and down through a small office door.  A man sat behind the desk in the office, his face quiet, his eyes very wide and dark. He hardly glanced at Harry, but turned his eyes to the other man.  \"Set?\" he asked.  \"Couldn't miss now.\"  The man nodded and looked at last at Harry. \"You're upset,\" he murmured. \"What's bothering you?\"  \"Webber,\" said Harry hoarsely. \"He's following me here. He'll spot you. I tried to warn you before I came, but I couldn't.\"  The man at the desk smiled. \"Webber again, eh? Our old friend Webber. That's all right. Webber's at the end of his tether. There's nothing he can do to stop us. He's trying to attack with force, and he fails to realize that time and thought are on our side. The time when force would have succeeded against us is long past. But now there are many of us, almost as many as not.\"  Harry stared shrewdly at the man behind the desk. \"Then why are you so afraid of Webber?\" he asked.  \"Afraid?\"  \"You know you are. Long ago you threatened me, if I reported to him. You watched me, played with me. Why are you afraid of him?\"  The man sighed. \"Webber is premature. We are stalling for time, that's all. We wait. We have grown from so very few, back in the 1940s and 50s, but the time for quiet usurpation of power has not quite arrived. But men like Webber force our hand, discover us, try to expose us.\"  Harry Scott's face was white, his hands shaking. \"And what do you do to them?\"  \"We--deal with them.\"  \"And those like me?\"  The man smiled lopsidedly. \"Those like Paulus and Wineberg and the rest--they're happy, really, like little children. But one like you is so much more useful.\" He pointed almost apologetically to the small screen on his desk.  Harry looked at it, realization dawning. He watched the huge, broad-shouldered figure moving down the hallway toward the door.  \"Webber was dangerous to you?\"  \"Unbelievably dangerous. So dangerous we would use any means to trap him.\"  Suddenly the door burst open and there stood Webber, a triumphant Webber, face flushed, eyes wide, as he stared at the man behind the desk.  The man smiled back and said, \"Come on in, George. We've been waiting for you.\"  Webber stepped through the door. \"Manelli, you fool!\"  There was a blinding flash as he crossed the threshold. A faint crackle of sound reached Harry's ears; then the world blacked out....         *       *       *       *       *  It might have been minutes, or hours, or days. The man who had been behind the desk was leaning over Harry, smiling down at him, gently bandaging the trephine wounds at his temples.  \"Gently,\" he said, as Harry tried to sit up. \"Don't try to move. You've been through a rough time.\"  Harry peered up at him. \"You're--not Dr. Webber.\"  \"No. I'm Dr. Manelli. Dr. Webber's been called away--an accident. He'll be some time recovering. I'll be taking care of you.\"  Vaguely, Harry was aware that something was peculiar, something not quite as it should be. The answer slowly dawned on him.  \"The statistical analysis!\" he exclaimed. \"I was supposed to get some data from Dr. Webber about an analysis, something about rising insanity rates.\"  Dr. Manelli looked blank. \"Insanity rates? You must be mistaken. You were brought here for an immunity examination, nothing more. But you can check with Dr. Webber, when he gets back.\"     6   George Webber sat in the little room, trembling, listening, his eyes wide in the thick, misty darkness. He knew it would be a matter of time now. He couldn't run much farther. He hadn't seen them, true. Oh, they had been very clever, but they thought they were dealing with a fool, and they weren't. He _knew_ they'd been following him; he'd known it for a long time now.  It was just as he had been telling the man downstairs the night before: they were everywhere--your neighbor upstairs, the butcher on the corner, your own son or daughter, maybe even the man you were talking to--_everywhere_!  And of course he had to warn as many people as he possibly could before _they_ caught him, throttled him off, as they had threatened to if he talked to anyone.  If only the people would _listen_ to him when he told them how cleverly it was all planned, how it would only be a matter of months, maybe only weeks or days before the change would happen, and the world would be quietly, silently taken over by the _other_ people, the different people who could walk through walls and think in impossibly complex channels. And no one would know the difference, because business would go on as usual.  He shivered, sinking down lower on the bed. If only people would listen to him--  It wouldn't be long now. He had heard the stealthy footsteps on the landing below his room some time ago. This was the night they had chosen to make good their threats, to choke off his dangerous voice once and for all. There were footsteps on the stairs now, growing louder.  Wildly he glanced around the room as the steps moved down the hall toward his door. He rushed to the window, threw up the sash and screamed hoarsely to the silent street below: \"Look out! They're here, all around us! They're planning to take over! Look out! Look out!\"  The door burst open and there were two men moving toward him, grim-faced, dressed in white; tall, strong men with sad faces and strong arms.  One was saying, \"Better come quietly, mister. No need to wake up the whole town.\""]]]
