And there is only one answer to such questions, a strong emphatic \"yes.\" It surely is the Christ-spirit that moves in all of this. This is a coming of Christ; and a blessed coming, too. There was nothing of this sort before the Christ-spirit began to sweeten the world's life. And there is none of it to-day except in those parts of the world where the Christ-spirit influences life.  But--there's a \"but\"--it proves a blessed but; this is only a crumb or two falling from a loaded table. And he who judges Christ by these crumbs only, wholesome and toothsome as they are, will have a very skimpy conception of Christ.  All of this sort of thing that has come has come very slowly. It has had to fight through and in, every step of the way that it has come. Its coming has been opposed stubbornly, maliciously, viciously every inch of the road, as only those know who are in the thick of the struggle for these reforms, panting for breath sometimes.  It is as though a few whiffs of wholesome life-giving air have breathed through the cracks and crevices of the breastworks and fortifications of evil in which all our common life seems entrenched. But the fortifications are still there. If the sweet, wholesome breathing in through cracks and crannies has been so blest, what would it be if the forces of evil were clean removed from the scene, and the Christ-spirit became the whole atmosphere breathed fully and freely without restraint, with no bad draughts, and no counter currents to guard and fight against?  It would seem like a strange sort of a kingdom if the present is even a gradual coming in of the Kingdom. We would seem to be having a new, strange sort of a Christ if the present is a sample of His sort of reigning. For it may well be thoughtfully doubted if ever there was such a condition of feverish unrest in all parts of the world as to-day.  It is most difficult to put your finger on a single spot of the world-map that is not being torn and uptorn by unrest in one shape or another. Either actual war, or constant studious preparation for war, actually never ceases. And it is difficult to say which is the worse of the two. The actual war reveals more terribly to our eyes and ears the awful cost in treasure and in precious human blood spilled without stint. The never-ceasing preparation for war seems actually to cost more. In the immense treasure involved, and in blood too, given out, not on an occasional battlefield, but in the continual battle of daily life to meet the terrible drain of taxation, it costs immensely more. There is less of the tragic for the news headings, but not a whit less, rather much more, in the slow suffering, the pinched lives, and the awful temptations to barter character for bread.  Then there is the continual seething unrest in the industrial world; the protests sometimes so strange and startling against social and political conditions; the feverish greed for gold, and land, and position; the intense pace of all our modern life; the abandonment of home and home ideals; the terrific attack against our young womanhood. The political pot which gathers into itself all these things, never quits boiling or boiling over, in some part of the world, now here, now there. And it seems like the greatest achievement of diplomacy when here and there it can be kept from boiling clean over, or at least made to boil over less.  It would seem indeed like a queer sort of kingdom if this is a sample. Some of us would have less heart in repeating one petition of the old daily prayer. And Christ would seem to have quite changed His spirit and character if this is a result of His coming.   The Greatness of Patience.  And the great simple truth is this, the truth that in the strange mix-up of life we easily lose sight of is this: _Christ has not yet taken possession of all of His domain_; a part of it still remains to be possessed. \"We see _not yet_ all things subjected to Him.\"[23] We are living in the \"not-yet\" interval between the crowning and the actual reigning. We are living on the \"not-yet\" possessed part of His domain.  And the question that comes hot and quick from our lips, even though with an attempt at subdued reverence, is this: \"Why does He not take possession, and untangle the snarl, and right the wrongs, and bring in the true rational order of things?\" And all the long waiting, the soreness of hearts over the part that touches one's own life most closely, the shortness of breath in the tensity of the struggle, underscore that word \"why?\"  And the answer to the impatient question reveals all afresh the greatness of the love of our Christ. His greatness is shown most in His _patience_. But patience is one of the things we men on this old earth don't know. It's one of the unknown quantities to us. It can be known only by knowing God. For patience is love at its best. Patience is God at His best. His is the patience that sees all, and feels all with the tender heart that broke once under the load, and yet waits, steadily waits, and then waits just a bit longer.  In this He runs the risk of being misunderstood. Men in their stupidity constantly mistake strong patience for weakness or indifference or lack of a gripping purpose. And God is misunderstood in this, even by His trusting children. But, even so, the object to be gained is so great, and so near Christ's heart that He waits, strongly waits with a patience beyond our comprehension; waits just a bit longer, always just a bit longer.  There are two parts to the answer. Jesus the Christ is giving man the fullest opportunity. He never interferes with man's right of free choice. Man is free to do as he chooses. Every possible means is used to influence him to choose right, but the choice itself is always left to the man. The present is man's opportunity. The initiative of action on the earth is altogether in man's hand. All of God's power is at man's disposal; but man must _reach out_ and _take_. This long stretched but waiting time is for man's sake, that he may have fullest opportunity. The longsuffering of God would woo men.[24]  When at length opportunity comes to its end it will be only because things have gotten into such desperate shape, into such an awful fix, that at length _for man's sake_ Christ will step into the direct action of the earth once again. He will take the leadership of earth into His own hands, even while still leaving each man free in his individual choice. This is the first part of the answer. The waiting is that man may have fullest opportunity.  Then Christ has a great hunger for _willing_ hearts. No words are strong enough to tell His longing for a free, glad, joyous surrender to His mastery. He could so easily end the present conflict, but He waits that men may bring to Him the allegiance of their lives, given of their own glad, gracious, voluntary accord. He was a volunteer Saviour. He longs for that love that is the bubbling out of a free, full heart.  The best love is only given freely without any compulsion of any sort, save only love's sweet compelling. He wants what He gives--the best. And so He waits, patiently waits just a bit longer. This is the second bit of the answer. The long delay spells out the hunger as well as the patience of God's heart. The divine Husbandman is patiently waiting, and sending warm sun and soft rains and fragrant dews while waiting.[25]   \"The Husbandman waiteth--    The _Husbandman_? Why?  For the heart of one servant    Who hears not His cry.   \"The Husbandman waiteth--    He _waiteth_? What for?  For the heart of one servant    To love Him yet more.   \"The Husbandman waiteth--    Long patience hath He--  But He waiteth in hunger--    Oh! Is it for thee?\"[26]   Taking with Your Life.  But--ah! listen, there's a wonderful \"but\" to put in here. But, while waiting _He puts all His limitless power at our disposal_. If that simple sentence could be put into letters of living flame, its tremendous meaning might burn into our hearts. When Paul piled up phrase on phrase in his eager attempt to have his Asiatic friends in and around Ephesus take in the limitless power of the ascended Christ, he added the significant words, \"to the Church.\"[27] All that power is for the use, and at the disposal, of the Church.  The Church was meant to be a unit in spirit in loyalty to her absent Lord, wholly under the dominating touch of the Holy Spirit, not only in her official actions, but in the lives of the individual members. If she were so, no human imagination could take in the startling, revolutionary power, softly, subtly, but with resistless sweep, flowing down from the crowned Christ, among grateful men.  Not being such a unit it is not possible that that power shall be as great in manifestation as was planned and meant. For no individual nor group can ever take the place in action of the whole unified body of believers, acting as a channel for the power of the crowned Christ. That power shall be realized on the earth only when the Church is so unified, and at work, under the reigning Christ, from the new headquarters up in the heavens.  But meanwhile all of that power is _at the disposal of any disciple of Christ_--the humblest--who will simply live in full-faced touch with Christ, and who will _take_ of that power as the need comes, and as the sovereign Holy Spirit leads.  It is of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23038"],["title","Quiet Talks on the Crowned Christ of Revelation (#3)"],["body","this, this _personal_ taking, that Paul is speaking when he piles up that intense sentence: \"able to do _exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think_ according to _the power that worketh in us_.\"[28] The great bother in Paul's day and ever since, and now, is to get people to _take_. The power is fairly a-tremble in the air at our very finger-tips. And we go limping, crutching along both bodily and mentally and in our spiritual leanness.  Those tremendous words of Jesus, \"because I go unto the Father,\" with the whole passage in which they occur,[29] must be read in _the light shining from the throne_. Only so can they be understood. But then, so read, they begin to grip us, and grip us hard, as we see what He really meant and means.  He who has the warm, child-like touch of heart with Jesus, that the word \"believeth\" stands for, shall--as the Holy Spirit has full control--do the same works as Jesus did, same in kind and in degree, and then shall do even greater than Jesus ever did. _Because_ it is now the glorified crowned Christ who is doing them through some child of His, simple-hearted enough to let Him have full control.  And the means through which He will do them is simple, child-like, trusting, humble prayer. The man using the power is on his knees. The lower down he gets the more and more freely the power flows down and out among men.  As one learns to keep in touch--learns it slowly, stumblingly, with many a stupid fall, and many a tremble and quiver--as he learns to keep in simple touch with the crowned Christ he will find _all_ the power of that Christ coming with a soft surging throb of life wherever needed. _We may have all we can take._ But _the taking must be with one's very life_. No mere earnest repeating of a creed in Church service will avail here. The repeating must be, syllable by syllable, with feet and will, with hands and life, in the daily tread where each step is stubbornly contested.  This is the bit of truth for the waiting time. This is the song to be singing in this present \"not-yet\" interval. And the song will help cut down the length of that \"not-yet,\" until the friction of our lived faith shall wear off the \"not\" and wipe out the \"yet,\" and we shall find the crowned Christ a reigning Christ.  For some day this patient waiting crowned Man will rise up from His seat at the Father's right hand. He will step directly into the action of earth once again. Man will have had his fullest opportunity lengthened out to the last notch of his possible use of it. Then we shall see the crowned Christ quietly stepping in, taking matters wholly into His own hands, and acting in all the affairs of earth as the Crowned One. Then He shall reign from sea to sea, and from the Euphrates out to where the ends of the earth become a common line on the other side. The Kingdom will have come, for the King will be reigning.  The night will be gone. The day has come. The shadows flee. He has come, whose presence puts the new day at dawn, with the East all aflame, and the fragrant dew glistening gladly on every tender green blade. This time of expectancy is over;[30] the time of making real has _come_. Then comes the restoration of the old original love plan to earth and beast and man.[31]   \"Thou art coming, O my Saviour!    Thou art coming, O my King!  In thy glory all-transcendent;  In thy beauty all resplendent;    Well may we rejoice and sing!  Coming! In the opening east,    Herald brightness slowly swells;  Coming, O my glorious Priest,    Hear we not thy golden bells?   \"Thou art coming, Thou art coming!    We shall meet Thee on Thy way,  We shall see Thee, we shall know Thee,  We shall bless Thee, we shall show Thee    All our hearts could never say!  What an anthem that will be,  Ringing out our love to Thee;  Pouring out our rapture sweet  At Thine own all-glorious feet!   \"Thou art coming! Rays of glory,    Through the veil Thy death has rent,  Touch the mountain and the river  With a golden glowing quiver,    Thrill of light and music blent.  Earth is brightened when this gleam  Falls on flower, rock, and stream;  Life is brightened when this ray  Falls upon its darkest day.   \"Not a cloud and not a shadow,    Not a mist and not a tear,  Not a sin and not a sorrow,  Not a dim and veiled to-morrow,    For that sunrise grand and clear!  Jesus, Saviour, once with Thee,    Nothing else seems worth a thought!  Oh, how marvellous will be    All the bliss Thy pain hath bought!   \"Thou art coming! At Thy table,    We are witnesses of this,  While remembering hearts Thou meetest,  In communion clearest, sweetest,    Earnest of our coming bliss.  Showing not Thy death alone,    And Thy love exceeding great,  But Thy coming and Thy throne,    All for which we long and wait.   \"Thou art coming! We are waiting    With a hope that cannot fail;  Asking not the day or hour,  Resting on Thy word of power    Anchored safe within the veil,  Time appointed may be long,    But the vision must be sure;  Certainty shall make us strong,    Joyful patience can endure!   \"O the joy to see Thee reigning,    Thee, my own beloved Lord!  Every tongue Thy name confessing,  Worship, honor, glory, blessing,    Brought to Thee with glad accord!  Thee, my Master and my Friend,    Vindicated and enthroned!  Unto earth's remotest end    Glorified, adored, and owned!\"[32]   Working by the Light of the Throne.  But we are still in the \"not-yet\" interval. We see not yet all things subject to Him. This is still the waiting time. It is the pleading time for Him. He pleads for the _personal crowning_ of Himself in our lives, that He may reign there and He alone. This is our great opportunity. We shall never see its like again, nor anywhere else than on this earth.  In the reigning time that's coming this peculiar opportunity of crowning Christ while He still is absent and despised, this will be gone. In the upper world they have no such opportunity. There is no opposition there. Now and here is the rarest opportunity to put this great waiting patient Man on the throne of heart and life, with possessions and ambitions and plans all in subjection under His feet.  Every woman knows the name of Brussels lace. The old capital of the low countries of Europe has long been famous for its lace. It is of great interest to note the conditions under which it is sometimes made. They are conditions studiously prepared after long experience. In one of the famous lace factories in Brussels there are a number of small rooms devoted to the making of some of the most delicate patterns.  Each room is just large enough for a single worker, and is quite dark except for one narrow window. The worker sits so that the stream of light falls from above directly upon the threads, while he himself sits in the darkness. The darkness aids the workman's eyes to see better, and to work more skilfully in the narrow line of clear light centred on the delicate task. He weaves in the upper light intensified by the surrounding gloom, and does exquisite work.  There is a clear line of light _from a throne_ shining down into the darkness in which we sit and move. It shines from the face of a crowned Man. In the light of that light we can see clearly to do a difficult bit of crowning work,--to crown the Christ in our lives and to keep Him crowned.  As our eyes follow that line of upper light we may catch glimpses of His wondrous Face up there in the glory. So we shall be steadied and cheered in the darkness as we stick to our glad crowning work. And so we shall move forward on the calendar the day when that thin line of light seen now only by watching eyes shall become a burst of glory light seen by all eyes.  And this is the thing the crowned Christ is asking of us during this waiting time, this \"not-yet\" interval. He is counting on each of us being faithful to Him, our absent Lord, in this.   \"He is counting on you.    He has need of your life    In the thick of the strife:    For that weak one may fall    If you fail at His call.  He is counting on you,  If you fail Him--      What then?   \"He is counting on you.    On your silver and gold,    On that treasure you hold;    On that treasure still kept,    Though the doubt o'er you swept    'Is this gold not _all_ mine?    (Lord, I knew it was _Thine_.')  He is counting on you,  If you fail Him--      What then?   \"He is counting on you.    On a love that will share    In His burden of prayer,    For the souls He has bought    With His life-blood; and sought    Through His sorrow and pain    To win 'Home' yet again.  He is counting on you,  If you fail Him--      What then?   \"He is counting on you.    On life, money, and prayer;    And 'the day shall declare'    If you let Him have _all_    In response to His call;    Or if He in that day    To your sorrow must say,  'I had counted on you,  But you failed me'--      What then?   \"He is counting on you.    Oh! the wonder and grace,    To look Christ in the face    And not be ashamed;    For you gave what He claimed,    And you laid down your all    For His sake--at His call.  He had counted on you,  And you failed not.      What then?\"[33]  Ah! Please God, by His grace, we shall not fail in _the ruling purpose_ of our lives. We may crown Him Lord of all. We _can_. He asks it. We surely _will_.   \"With all my powers Him I greet,    All subject to His call;  And bowing low at His pierced feet      _Now_ crown him Lord of all.\"    FOOTNOTES:  [1] Joseph Addison Richards.
