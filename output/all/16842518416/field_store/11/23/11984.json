Even in that time of loose spelling his spelling is remarkably loose.  He seems to spell without any particular principle in the matter, seldom rendering the same word a second time by the same combination of letters.  He was at one period of his life a libertine of the loosest order, so far as morals were {25} concerned, but of the shrewdest kind as regarded personal gain and advancement. He would have loved any Lady Bellaston who presented herself, and who could have rewarded him for his kindness.  He was not of the type of Byron's \"Don Juan,\" who declares that    The prisoned eagle will not pair, nor I   Serve a Sultana's sensual phantasy.  Marlborough would have served any phantasy for gain.  It has been said of him that the reason for his being so successful with women as a young man was that he took money of them.  Yet, as another striking instance of the paradoxical nature of his character, he was intensely devoted to his wife.  He was the true lover of Sarah Jennings, who afterwards became Duchess of Marlborough.  A man of the most undaunted courage in the presence of the enemy, he was his wife's obedient, patient, timid slave.  He lived more absolutely under her control than Belisarius under the government of his unscrupulous helpmate.  Sarah Jennings was, in her way, almost as remarkable as her husband.  She was a woman of great beauty.  Colley Gibber, in his \"Apology,\" pays devoted testimony to her charms.  He had by chance to attend on her in the capacity of a sort of amateur lackey at an entertainment in Nottingham, and he seems to have been completely dazzled by her loveliness.  \"If so clear an emanation of beauty, such a commanding grace of aspect, struck me into a regard that had something softer than the most profound respect in it, I cannot see why I may not without offence remember it, since beauty, like the sun, must sometimes lose its power to choose, and shine into equal warmth the peasant and the courtier.\"  He quaintly adds, \"However presumptuous or impertinent these thoughts may have appeared at my first entertaining them, why may I not hope that my having kept them decently a secret for full fifty years may be now a good round plea for their pardon?\"  The imperious spirit which could rule Churchill long dominated the feeble nature of Queen Anne.  But {26} when once this domination was overthrown, Sarah Jennings had no art to curb her temper into such show of respect and compliance as might have won back her lost honors.  She met her humiliation with the most childish bursts of passion; she did everything in her power to annoy and insult the Queen who had passed from her haughty control. She was always a keen hater; to the last day of her life she never forgot her resentment towards all who had, or who she thought had, injured her.  In long later years she got into unseemly lawsuits with her own near relations.  But if one side of her character was harsh and unlovely enough, it may be admitted that there was something not unheroic about her unyielding spirit--something noble in the respect to her husband's memory, which showed itself in the declaration that she would not marry \"the emperor of the world,\" after having been the wife of John, Duke of Marlborough.  [Sidenote: 1714--Bolingbroke]  Henry St. John, Viscount Bolingbroke, was in his way as great a man as the Duke of Marlborough.  At the time we are now describing he seemed to have passed through a long, a varied, and a brilliant career, and yet he had only arrived at the age when public men in England now begin to be regarded as responsible politicians.  He was in his thirty-sixth year.  The career that had prematurely begun was drawing to its premature close.  He had climbed to his highest position; he is Prime-minister of England, and has managed to get rid of his old colleague and rival, Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford.  Bolingbroke had almost every gift and grace that nature and fortune could give.  Three years before this Swift wrote to Stella, \"I think Mr. St. John the greatest young man I ever knew; wit, capacity, beauty, quickness of apprehension, good learning and an excellent taste; the greatest orator in the House of Commons, admirable conversation, good nature and good manners, generous, and a despiser of money.\"  Yet, as in the fairy story, the benign powers which had combined to endow him so richly had withheld the one gift which might have made all the rest of {27} surpassing value, and which being denied left them of little account. If Bolingbroke had had principle he would have been one of the greatest Englishmen of any time.  His utter want of morality in politics, as well as in private life, proved fatal to him; he only climbed high in order to fall the lower.  He was remarkable for profligacy even in that heedless and profligate time.  Voltaire, in one of his letters, tells a story of a famous London courtesan who exclaimed to some of her companion nymphs on hearing that Bolingbroke had been made Secretary of State, \"Seven thousand guineas a year, girls, and all for us!\"  Even if the story be not true it is interesting and significant as an evidence of the sort of impression which Bolingbroke had made upon his age.  It was his glory to be vicious; he was proud of his orgies.  He liked to be known as a man who could spend the whole night in a drunken revel, and the afternoon in preparing some despatch on which the fortunes of his country or the peace of the world might depend.  The sight of a beautiful woman could turn him away for the time from the gravest political purposes.  He was ready at such a moment to throw anything over for the sake of the sudden love-chase which had come in his way. He bragged of his amours, and boasted that he had never failed of success with any woman who seemed to him worth pursuing.  Like Faust, he loved to reel from desire to enjoyment, and from enjoyment back again into desire.  Bolingbroke was the first of a great line of parliamentary debaters who have made for themselves a distinct place in English history, and whose rivals are not to be found in the history of any other parliament.  It is difficult at this time to form any adequate idea of Bolingbroke's style as a speaker or his capacity for debate when compared with other great English parliamentary orators. But so far as one may judge, we should be inclined to think that he must have had Fox's readiness without Fox's redundancy and repetition; and that he must have had the stately diction and the commanding style of the younger Pitt, with a certain freshness and force which {28} the younger Pitt did not always exhibit.  Bolingbroke's English prose style is hardly surpassed by that of any other author, either before his time or since.  It is supple, strong, and luminous; not redundant, but not bare; ornamented where ornament is suitable and even useful, but nowhere decorated with the purple rags of unnecessary and artificial brilliancy.  Such a man, so gifted, must in any case have held a high place among his contemporaries, and probably if Bolingbroke had possessed the political and personal virtues of men like Burke and Pitt, or even the political virtues of a man like Charles Fox, he would have been remembered as the greatest of all English parliamentary statesmen.  But, as we have already said, the one defect filled him with faults.  The lack of principle gave him a lack of purpose, and wanting purpose he persevered in no consistent political path.  Swift has observed that Bolingbroke \"had a great respect for the characters of Alcibiades and Petronius, especially the latter, whom he would gladly be thought to resemble.\"  He came nearer at his worst to Petronius than at his best to Alcibiades.  Alcibiades, to do him justice, admired and understood virtue in others, however small the share of it he contrived to keep for himself.  It is impossible to read that wonderful compound of dramatic humor and philosophic thought, Plato's \"Banquet,\" without being moved by the generous and impassioned eulogy which Alcibiades, in the fulness of his heart and of his wine, pours out upon the austere virtue of Socrates.  Such as Alcibiades is there described we may suppose Alcibiades to have been, and no one who has followed the career of Bolingbroke can believe it possible that he ever could have felt any sincere admiration for virtue in man or woman, or could have thought of it otherwise than as a thing to be sneered at and despised.  The literary men, and more especially the poets of the days of Bolingbroke, seem to have had as little scruple in their compliments as a French _petit-ma√Ætre_ might have in sounding the praises of his mistress to his mistress's ears.  Pope talks of his villa, where, \"nobly {29} pensive, St. John sat and thought,\" and declared that such only might          Tread this sacred floor   Who dare to love their country and be poor.  [Sidenote: 1714--Pope's praises]  It is hard to think of Bolingbroke, even in his more advanced years, as \"nobly pensive,\" sitting and thinking, and certainly neither Bolingbroke nor any of Bolingbroke's closer political associates was exactly the sort of man who would have dared \"to love his country and be poor.\"  In Bolingbroke's latest years we hear of him as amusing himself by boasting to his second wife of his various successful amours, until at last the lady, weary of the repetition, somewhat contemptuously reminds him that however happy as a lover he may have been once, his days of love were now over, and the less he said about it the better.  Nor was Pope less extravagant in his praise to Harley than to St. John. He says:        If aught below the seats divine   Can touch immortals, 'tis a soul like thine;   A soul supreme, in each hard instance tried,   Above all pain, all passion, and all pride,   The rage of power, the blast of public breath,   The lust of lucre, and the dread of death.  These lines, it is"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23469"],["title","A History of the Four Georges, Volume I (#6)"],["body","to remember, were addressed to Harley, not in his power, but after his fall.  Even with that excuse for a friend's overcharged eulogy, they read like a satire on Harley rather than like his panegyric.  Caricature itself could not more broadly distort the features of a human being than his poetic admirer has altered the lineaments of Oxford.  Harley had been intriguing on both sides of the field.  He professed devoted loyalty to the Queen and to her appointed successor, and he was at the same time coquetting, to put it mildly, with the Stuart family in France.  Nothing surprises a reader more than the universal duplicity that seems to have prevailed in the days of Anne and of the early Georges.  Falsehood appears to have been a recognized diplomatic {30} and political art.  Statesmen, even of the highest rank and reputation, made no concealment of the fact that whenever occasion required they were ready to state the thing which was not, either in private conversation or in public debate.  Nothing could exceed or excuse the boundless duplicity of Marlborough, but it must be owned that even William the Third told almost as many falsehoods to Marlborough as Marlborough could have told to him.  At a time when William detested Marlborough, he yet occasionally paid him in public and in private the very highest compliments on his integrity and his virtue.  Men were not then supposed or expected to speak the truth.  A statesman might deceive a foreign minister or the Parliament of his own country with as little risk to his reputation as a lady would have undergone, in later days, who told a lie to the custom-house officer at the frontier to save the piece of smuggled lace in her trunk.  [Sidenote: 1714--Harley]  If a man like William of Nassau could stoop to deceit and falsehood for any political purpose, it is easy to understand that a man like Harley would make free use of the same arts, and for personal objects as well. Harley's political changes were so many and so rapid that they could not possibly be explained by any theory consistent with sincerity.  It was well said of him that \"his humor is never to deal clearly or openly, but always with reserve, if not dissimulation, and to love tricks when not necessary, but from an inward satisfaction in applauding his own cunning.\"  He entered Parliament in 1689, and in 1700 was chosen Speaker of the House of Commons.  At that time, and for long after, it was not an uncommon thing that a man who had been Speaker should afterwards become a Secretary of State, sitting in the same House.  This was Harley's case: in 1704 he was made principal Secretary of State.  In 1708 Harley resigned office, and immediately after took the leadership of the Tory party.  In about two years he overthrew the Whig administration, and became the head of a new government, with the place of Lord High Treasurer, and the title of Earl of Oxford.  {31} His craft seems only to have been that low kind of artifice which enables an unscrupulous man to cajole his followers and to stir up division among his enemies.  His word was not to be relied upon by friend or enemy, and when he most affected a tone of frankness or of candor he was least to be trusted.  As Lord Stanhope well says of him \"His slender and pliant intellect was well fitted to crawl up to the heights of power through all the crooked mazes and dirty by-paths of intrigue; but having once attained the pinnacle, its smallness and meanness were exposed to all the world.\"  Even his private life had not the virtues which one who reads some of the exalted panegyrics paid to him by contemporary poets and others would be apt to imagine.  He was fond of drink and fond of pleasure in a small and secret way; his vices were as unlike the daring and brilliant profligacy of his colleague and rival Bolingbroke as his intellect was inferior to Bolingbroke's surpassing genius.  For all Pope's poetic eulogy, the poet could say in prose of Lord Oxford that he was not a very capable minister, and had a good deal of negligence into the bargain.  \"He used to send trifling verses from court to the Scriblerus Club every day, and would come and talk idly with them almost every night, even when his all was at stake.\"  Pope adds that Oxford \"talked of business in so confused a manner that you did not know what he was about, and everything he went to tell you was in the epic way, for he always began in the middle.\"  Swift calls him \"the greatest procrastinator in the world.\"  It is of Lord Oxford that the story is originally told which has been told of so many statesmen here and in America since his time.  Lord Oxford, according to Pope, invited Rowe, the dramatic poet, to learn Spanish.  Rowe went to work, and studied Spanish under the impression that some appointment at the Spanish court would follow.  When he returned to Harley and told him he had accomplished the task, Harley said, \"Then, Mr. Rowe, I envy you the pleasure of reading 'Don Quixote' in the original.\"  Pope asks, \"Is not that cruel?\"  But {32} others have held that it was unintentional on Lord Oxford's part, and merely one of his unthinking oddities.  [Sidenote: 1714--Walpole]  Another man, fifteen years younger than Harley, a school-fellow at Eton of Bolingbroke, was rising slowly, surely, into prominence and power. All the great part of his career is yet to come; but even already, while men were talking of Marlborough and Bolingbroke, they found themselves compelled to give a place in their thoughts to Robert Walpole.  If Bolingbroke was the first, and perhaps the most brilliant, of the great line of parliamentary debaters who have made debate a moving power in English history, Walpole was the first of that line of statesmen who, sprung from the class of the \"Commoner,\" have become leaders of the English Parliament.  In position and in influence, although not in personal character or accomplishments, Walpole may be described as the direct predecessor of Peel and Gladstone.  Just two years before the death of William the Third, Walpole entered Parliament for the first time.  He married, entered Parliament, and succeeded to his father's estates in the same year, 1700.  Walpole was only twenty-four years of age when he took his seat in the House of Commons as member for Castle Rising in Norfolk.  He was a young country squire of considerable fortune, and a thorough supporter of the Whig party. Walpole came into Parliament at that happy time for men of his position when the change was already taking place which marked the representative assembly as the controlling power in the State.  The Government as a direct ruling power was beginning to grow less and less effective, and the House of Commons beginning to grow more and more strong.  This change had begun to set in during the Restoration, and by the time Walpole came to be known in Parliament it was becoming more and more evident that the Ministers of State were in the future only to be men intrusted with the duty of carrying out the will of the majority in the House of Commons.  Before that majority every other power in the State was ultimately to bend.  The man, therefore, {33} who could by eloquence, genuine statesmanship, and force of character, or even by mere tact, secure the adhesion of that majority, had become virtually the ruler of the State.  But as will easily be seen, his rule even then was something very different indeed from the rule of an arbitrary minister.  He would have to satisfy, to convince, to conciliate the majority.  A single false step, an hour's weakness of purpose, nay, even a failure for which he was not himself accountable in home or foreign policy, might deprive him of his influence over the majority, and might reduce him to comparative insignificance.  Therefore, the controlling power which a great minister acquired was held by virtue of the most constant watchfulness, the most unsparing labor, energy, and devotion, and also in a great measure by the favor of fortune and of opportunity.  Walpole was a man eminently qualified to obtain influence over the House of Commons, and to keep it up when he had once obtained it.  No man could have promised less in the beginning.  That was an acute observer who divined the genius of Cromwell under Cromwell's homely exterior when he first came up to Parliament.  Almost as much acuteness would have been needed to enable any one to see the future Prime-minister of England and master of the House of Commons in the plain, unpromising form, the homely, almost stolid countenance, the ungainly movements and gestures of Walpole.  Walpole was as much of a rustic as Lord Althorp in times nearer to our own acknowledged himself to be.  Althorp said he ought to have been a grazier, and that it was an odd chance which made him Prime-minister.  But the difference was great.  Walpole had the gifts which make a man prime-minister, despite his country gentleman or grazier-like qualities.  It was not chance, but Walpole himself which raised him to the position he came to hold. Walpole knew nothing and cared nothing about literature and art.  His great passion was for hunting; his next love was for wine, and his third for his dinner.  Without any natural gift of eloquence he became a great debater.  {34} Nature, which seemed to have lavished all her most luxurious gifts on Bolingbroke, appeared to have pinched and starved Walpole.  Where Bolingbroke was richest Walpole was poorest; Bolingbroke's genius required a frequent rein; Walpole's intellect needed the perpetual spur.  Yet Walpole, with his lack of imagination, of eloquence, of wit, of humor, and of culture, went farther and did more than the brilliant Bolingbroke.  It was the old fable of the hare and the tortoise over again; perhaps it should rather be called a new version of the old fable.  The farther the hare goes in the wrong way the more she goes astray, and thus many of Bolingbroke's most rapid movements only helped the tortoise to get "]]]
