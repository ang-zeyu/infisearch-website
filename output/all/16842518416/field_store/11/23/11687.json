Before the gap narrowed, he had a better opportunity to see the defenses of the cruiser in action.  A whitish cloud of gas was expelled from his target's hull, bearing a myriad of small objects which promptly acquired a life of their own. Both screens were filled with flashing, diverging trails of flame. Then--nothing.  \"They're heading at us!\" called Donna. \"Hang on!\"  Phillips had already pulled the switches to bring up a new pair of torpedoes. Hearing the urgency in Donna's tone, he leaped toward a rack of spacesuits and grabbed.         *       *       *       *       *  The next instant, he was pinned forcibly against the rack by acceleration, as Donna made the ship dodge aside. From one side, he heard a screech of grating metal. The fresh missiles must have jammed halfway out of the storage compartment.  It gave him a weird feeling of unreality; as he hung there helplessly, to see one of the screens on the bulkhead pick up something moving, gleaming, metallic.  \"Donna!\" he shouted hoarsely. \"Let up!\"  \"I don't dare,\" she gasped over the intercom. \"I lost them, but they were starting after us!\"  \"Let up!\" repeated Phillips. \"They're dead ahead of that wild shot of ours. Let me get to the controls!\"  He dropped abruptly to the deck as the acceleration vanished. One leap carried him to the radio controls.  The metallic gleam had swelled into a huge spaceship. The cruiser was angling slightly away from the point from which he seemed to be viewing it. How soon, he wondered, would they detect the presence of his torpedo? Or would they neglect this direction, being intent upon the destruction of those who were attempting to frustrate their mad dash for Mars?  Phillips stood before the screen, clenching his fists. There was, after all, nothing for him to do but watch. The gleaming hull expanded with a swelling rush. Details of construction, hitherto invisible, leaped out at him. A crack finally appeared as a section began to slide back.  This time, however, there was no blinding flare of small rockets. The blacking out of the screen coincided with Donna's scream. \"_It hit!_\"  In the silence that followed, he thought he heard a sob.  \"Oh, Phillips,\" she said, recovering, \"we did it. They're--\"  \"Hang on,\" said Phillips. \"I'll climb into a spacesuit and come forward.\"  He switched off the intercom and dragged a suit from the rack. It took him a good fifteen minutes to get the helmet screwed on properly and to check everything else. He realized that he was very tired.  He opened the exit hatch, seized the top of the ladder in his gauntlets as the air exploded out of the turret, and climbed back to the main deck.  Clumping forward through the airless corridor, he stopped to look into the compartment where he had left Brecken. He quickly slid the door shut again.  He found that Donna had sealed off the corridor just short of the control room by closing a double emergency door that must have been designed to form an airlock in just such a situation. He hammered upon it, and she slid it open from the control desk.  It closed again behind him, and he entered the control room through the usual door. The girl helped him to remove the suit and motioned him toward the screen.         *       *       *       *       *  Phillips regarded the scene without enthusiasm. The sight of the dead man had reminded him of what the compartments of that other vessel must look like by now. Its parts were beginning to scatter slowly.  He looked at Donna, and found her regarding him soberly. \"What will they do with us now?\" she asked.  She looked exhausted. He extended an arm, and she leaned against him. \"You heard what Varret said,\" he told her.  \"Yes, but will he keep his word? They might be ... ashamed of us, now that it's done. Even if they're not, I can't bear the thought of going back to Earth and having them stare at me!\"  Phillips nodded. He remembered the morbid curiosity during his own trial, the crowds who had watched him with a kind of shrinking horror--and he had actually been responsible for saving a spaceship and its crew, had they cared to look on that side of the affair.  But he had killed. That was no longer the action of a normal human being, according to popular thinking.  \"I guess you and I are the only ones who will understand one another from now on,\" he shrugged.  Donna smiled faintly, just as the signal sounded on the communication screen.  It was Varret, looking pale and strained. He listened to Phillips' account, including the deaths of Truesdale and Brecken, and apologized for his appearance. He had, he informed them, been unpleasantly ill when he had seen the explosion. \"It was a terrible thing,\" Varret continued sadly, \"but necessary. They were beyond reasoning with, and a deadly menace.\"  He pulled himself together and tried to hide his agitation by reminding them of his promise. He suggested that they consider their requests while his ship attempted to tow them in to Deimos.  Phillips glanced speculatively at Donna. They would be two outcasts, however much their deed might be respected abstractly, however much official expressions of gratitude were employed to gloss over the fact. He might as well take one chance more. \"We have already decided,\" he said boldly. \"I hear you are building a new space station on Deimos.\"  The old man nodded, surprised.  \"We will ask for a deed to that moon, and a contract to operate the beacon and radio relay station,\" Phillips stated flatly.  Varret blinked, then smiled slightly in a sort of understanding admiration.  \"Reasonable and astute,\" he murmured after a moment's hesitation. \"I think I appreciate the motive. Perhaps, if that ship can be repaired and remodeled, we can include it so that you may make short visits to Mars.\"  He warned them to watch for the emergency crew he would send to their aid, and switched off.  Phillips then dared finally to turn and look inquiringly at Donna. Her smile was relaxed for the first time since they had met. \"Nice bargaining,\" she said, and Phillips felt like the king of something larger than a tiny Martian satellite.

Of the ship's social quartet, Chafis One and Two were asleep at the moment, dreaming wistful dreams of conical Ciriimian cities spearing up to a soft and plum-colored sky. The Zid raged into their communal rest cell, smashed them down from their gimbaled sleeping perches and, with the ravening blood-hunger of its kind, devoured them before they could wake enough to teleport to safety.  Chafis Three and Four, on psi shift in the forward control cubicle, might have fallen as easily if the mental screamings of their fellows had not warned them in time. As it was, they had barely time to teleport themselves to the after hold, as far as possible from immediate danger, and to consider the issue while the Zid lunged about the ship in search of them with malignant cries and a great shrieking of claws on metal.  Their case was the more desperate because the Chafis were professional freighters with little experience of emergency. Hauling a Zid from Canthorian jungles to a Ciriimian zoo was a prosaic enough assignment so long as the cage held, but with the raging brute swiftly smelling them out, they were helpless to catch and restrain it.  When the Zid found them, they had no other course but to teleport back to the control cubicle and wait until the beast should snuff them down again. The Zid learned quickly, so quickly that it was soon clear that its physical strength would far outlast their considerable but limited telekinetic ability.  Still they possessed their share of owlish Ciriimian logic and hit soon enough upon the one practical course--to jettison the Zid on the nearest world demonstrably free of intelligent life.         *       *       *       *       *  They worked hurriedly, between jumps fore and aft. Chafi Three, while they were still in the control cubicle, threw the ship out of hyperdrive within scant miles of the neighboring sun's single planet. Chafi Four, on the next jump, scanned the ship's charts and identified the system through which they traveled.  Luck was with them. The system had been catalogued some four Ciriimian generations before and tagged: _Planet undeveloped. Tranquil marine intelligences only._  The discovery relieved them greatly for the reason that no Ciriimian, even to save his own feathered skin, would have set down such a monster as the Zid among rational but vulnerable entities.  The planet was a water world, bare of continents and only sparsely sprinkled with minor archipelagoes. The islands suited the Chafis' purpose admirably.  \"The Zid does not swim,\" Chafi Four radiated. \"Marooned, it can do no harm to marine intelligences.\"  \"Also,\" Chafi Three pointed out as they dodged to the control cubicle again just ahead of the slavering Zid, \"we may return later with a Canthorian hunting party and recover our investment.\"  Closing their perception against the Zid's distracting ragings, they set to work with perfect coordination.  Chafi Three set down the ship on an island that was only one of a freckling chain of similar islands. Chafi Four projected himself first to the opened port; then, when the Zid charged after him, to the herbivore-cropped sward of tropical setting outside.  The Zid lunged out. Chafi Four teleported inside again. Chafi Three closed the port. Together they relaxed their perception shields in relief--  Unaware in their consternation that they committed the barbarous lapse of vocalizing, they twittered aloud when they realized the extent of their error.  Above the far, murmurous whisper of expected marine cerebration there rose an uncoordinated mishmash of thought from at least two strong and relatively complex intelligences.  \"Gas-breathing!\" Chafi Four said unbelievingly. \"Warm-blooded, land-dwelling, mammalian!\"  \"A Class Five culture,\" Chafi agreed shakenly. His aura quivered with the shock of betrayal. \"The catalogue was _wrong_.\"  Ironically, their problem was more pressing now than before. Unless checked, the Zid would rapidly depopulate the island--and, to check it, they must break a prime rule of Galactic protocol in asking the help of a new and untested species.  But they had no choice. They teleported at once into the presence of the two nearby natives--and met with frustration beyond Ciriimian experience.         *       *       *       *       *  Jeff Aubray glimpsed the Ciriimian ship's landing because the morning was a Oneday, and on Onedays his mission to the island demanded that he be up and about at sunrise.  For two reasons: On Onedays, through some unfailing miracle of Calaxian seamanship, old Charlie Mack sailed down in his ancient _Island Queen_ from the township that represented colonial Terran civilization in Procynian Archipelago 147, bringing supplies and gossip to last Jeff through the following Tenday. The _Queen_ would dock at Jeff's little pier at dawn; she was never late.  Also on Onedays, necessarily before Charlie Mack's visit, Jeff must assemble his smuggled communicator--kept dismantled and hidden from suspicious local eyes--and report to Earth Interests Consulate his progress during the cycle just ended. The ungodly hour of transmission, naturally, was set to coincide with the closing of the Consul's field office halfway around the planet.  So the nacreous glory of Procyon's rising was just tinting the windows of Jeff's cottage when he aligned and activated his little communicator on his breakfast table. Its three-inch screen lighted to signal and a dour and disappointed Consul Satterfield looked at him. Behind Satterfield, foreshortened to gnomishness by the pickup, lurked Dr. Hermann, Earth Interests' resident zoologist.  \"No progress,\" Jeff reported, \"except that the few islanders I've met seem to be accepting me at last. A little more time and they might let me into the Township, where I can learn something. If Homeside--\"  \"You've had seven Tendays,\" Satterfield said. \"Homeside won't wait longer, Aubray. They need those calm-crystals too badly.\"  \"They'll use force?\" Jeff had considered the possibility, but its immediacy appalled him. \"Sir, these colonists had been autonomous for over two hundred years, ever since the Fourth War cut them off from us. Will Homeside deny their independence?\"  His sense of loss at Satterfield's grim nod stemmed from something deeper than sympathy for the islanders. It found roots in his daily rambles over the little island granted him by the Township for the painting he had begun as a blind to his assignment, and in the gossip of old Charlie Mack and the few others he had met. He had learned to appreciate the easy life of the islands well enough to be dismayed now by what must happen under EI pressure to old Charlie and his handful of sun-browned fisherfolk.         *       *       *       *       *  Unexpectedly, because Jeff had not considered that it might matter, he was disturbed by the realization that he wouldn't be seeing Jennifer, old Charlie Mack's red-haired niece, once occupation began. Jennifer, who sailed with her uncle and did a crewman's work as a matter of course, would despise the sight of him.  The Consul's pessimism jolted Jeff back to the moment at hand.  \"Homeside will deny their autonomy, Aubray. I've had a warp-beam message today ordering me to move in.\"  The situation was desperate enough at home, Jeff had to admit. Calaxian calm-crystals did what no refinement of Terran therapeutics had been able to manage. They erased the fears of the neurotic and calmed the quiverings of the hypertensive--both in alarming majority in the shattering aftermath of the Fourth War--with no adverse effects at all. Permanent benefit was slow but cumulative, offering for the first time a real step toward ultimate stability. The medical, psychiatric and political fields cried out for crystals and more crystals.  \"If the islanders would tell us their source and let us help develop it,\" Satterfield said peevishly, \"instead of doling out a handful of crystals every Tenday, there wouldn't be any need of action. Homeside feels they're just letting us have some of the surplus.\"  \"Not likely,\" Jeff said. \"They don't use the crystals themselves.\"  Old Dr. Hermann put his chin almost on the Consul's shoulder to present his wizened face to the scanner.  \"Of course they don't,\" he said. \"On an uncomplicated, even simple-minded world like this, who would need crystals? But maybe they fear glutting the market or the domination of outside capital coming in to develop the source. When people backslide, there's no telling what's on their minds and we have no time to waste negotiating or convincing them. In any case, how could they stop us from moving in?\" Abruptly he switched to his own interest. \"Aubray, have you learned anything new about the Scoops?\"  \"Nothing beyond the fact that the islanders don't talk about them,\" Jeff said. \"I've seen perhaps a dozen offshore during the seven cycles I've been here. One usually surfaces outside my harbor at about the time old Charlie Mack's supply boat comes in.\"  Thinking of Charlie Mack brought a forced end to his report. \"Charlie's due now. I'll call back later.\"  He cut the circuit, hurrying to have his communicator stowed away before old Charlie's arrival--not, he thought bitterly, that being found out now would make any great difference.         *       *       *       *       *  Stepping out into the brief Calaxian dawn, he caught his glimpse of the Ciriimian ship's landing before the island forest of palm-ferns cut it off from sight. Homeside hadn't been bluffing, he thought, assuming as a matter of course that this was the task force "]]]
