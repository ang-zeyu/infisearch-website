It conveyed them to a large ship, whose sails were hanging in the loose condition peculiar to a vessel ready to set sail.  An hour after that the anchor was raised, and wind and tide carried the ship gently down to the sea.  There seemed to Will something very solemn and mysterious in the quiet way in which, during these still and dark hours of the night, the great ship was slowly moved towards her ocean cradle.  At length she floated on the sea, and, soon after, the moon arose on the distant horizon, streaming across the rippling surface as if to kiss and welcome an old friend.  The wind increased; the ship became submissive to the breeze, obedient to the helm, and ere long moved on the waters like \"a thing of life,\" leaving Old England far behind her.  It was then that young Osten, leaning over the taffrail and looking wistfully back at the point where he had seen the last glimpse of the chalk cliffs, began to experience the first feelings of regret.  He tried to quiet his conscience by recalling the harsh and unjustifiable conduct of his father, but conscience would not be quieted thus, and faithful memory reminded him of the many acts of kindness he had experienced at his father's hands, while she pointed to his gentle mother, and bade him reflect what a tremendous blow this sudden departure would be to her.  Starting up and shaking off such thoughts, sternly he went below and threw himself into his narrow cot, where conscience assailed him still more powerfully and vividly in dreams.  Thus did Wandering Will leave his native land.  Commenting on his sudden departure, two days afterwards, Maryann said, in strict confidence, to her bosom friend \"Jemimar,\" that she \"know'd it would 'appen--or somethink simular, for, even w'en a hinfant, he had refused to larf at her most smudgin' blandishments; and that she knew somethink strange would come of it, though she would willingly have given her last shilling to have prevented it, but nothink was of any use tryin' of w'en one couldn't do it, as her 'usband, as was in the mutton-pie line, said to the doctor the night afore he died,--and that her 'art was quite broken about it, so it was.\"  Whereupon Jemima finished to the dregs her last cup of tea, and burst into a flood of tears.    CHAPTER THREE.  TELLS OF THE SEA, AND SOME OF THE MYSTERIES CONNECTED THEREWITH.  For many days and nights the good ship _Foam_ sailed the wide ocean without encountering anything more than the ordinary vicissitudes and experiences of sea-life.  Dolphins were seen and captured, sharks were fished for and caught, stiff breezes and calms succeeded each other, constellations in the far north began to disappear and new constellations arose in the southern skies.  In fact, during many weeks the voyage was prosperous, and young Will Osten began to experience those peculiar feelings with which all travellers are more or less acquainted--he felt that the ship was \"home\"; that his cabin with its furniture, which had appeared so small and confined at first, was quite a large and roomy place; that all the things about him were positive realities, and that the home of his childhood was a shadow of the past-- a sort of dream.  During all this time the young doctor led a busy life.  He was one of those active, intelligent, inquiring spirits which cannot rest.  To acquire information was with him not a duty, but a pleasure.  Before he had been many days at sea he knew the name and use of every rope, sail, block, tackle, and spar in the ship, and made himself quite a favourite with the men by the earnestness with which he questioned them in regard to nautical matters and their own personal experiences.  George Goff, the sail-maker, said he \"was a fust-rate feller;\" and Larry O'Hale, the cook, declared, \"he was a trump intirely, an' ought to have been born an Irishman.\"  Moreover, the affections of long Mr Cupples (as the first mate was styled by the men) were quite won by the way in which he laboured to understand the use of the sextant, and other matters connected with the mysteries of navigation; and stout Jonathan Dall, the captain, was overjoyed when he discovered that he was a good player on the violin, of which instrument he was passionately fond.  In short, Will Osten became a general favourite on board the _Foam_, and the regard of all, from the cabin-boy to the captain, deepened into respect when they found that, although only an advanced student and, \"not quite a doctor,\" he treated their few ailments with success, and acted his part with much self-possession, gentleness, and precision.  Larry O'Hale was particularly eloquent in his praises of him ever after the drawing of a tooth which had been the source of much annoyance to the worthy cook.  \"Why, messmates,\" he was wont to say, \"it bait everything the way he tuk it out.  `Open yer mouth,' says he, an' sure I opened it, an' before I cud wink, off wint my head--so I thought--but faix it wor only my tuth--a real grinder wi' three fangs no less--och! he's a cliver lad intirely.\"  But Will did not confine his inquiries to the objects contained within his wooden home.  The various phases and phenomena of the weather, the aspects of the sky, and the wonders of the deep, claimed his earnest attention.  To know the reason of everything was with him a species of mania, and in pursuit of this knowledge he stuck at nothing.  \"Never venture never win,\" became with him as favourite a motto as it had been with his father, and he acted on it more vigorously than his father had ever done.  One calm evening, as he was leaning over the side of the ship near the bow, gazing contemplatively down into the unfathomable sea, he overheard a conversation between the cook and one of the sailors named Muggins. They were smoking their pipes seated on the heel of the bowsprit.  \"Larry,\" said Muggins, \"I think we have got into the doldrums.\"  \"Ye're out there, boy,\" said Larry, \"for I heerd the capting say we wos past 'em a long way.\"  The men relapsed into silence for a time.  Then Muggins removed his pipe and said--  \"Wot ever caused the doldrums?\"  \"That's more nor I can tell,\" said Larry; \"all I know about them is, that it's aisy to git into them, but uncommon hard to git out again.  If my ould grandmother was here, she'd be able to tell us, I make no doubt, but she's in Erin, poor thing, 'mong the pigs and the taties.\"  \"Wot could _she_ tell about the doldrums?\" said Muggins, with a look of contempt.  \"More nor ye think, boy; sure there isn't nothin' in the univarse but she can spaik about, just like a book, an' though she niver was in the doldrums as far as I knows, she's been in the dumps often enough; maybe it's cousins they are.  Anyhow she's not here, an' so we must be contint with spekilation.\"  \"What's that you say, Larry?\" inquired the captain, who walked towards the bow at the moment.  The cook explained his difficulty.  \"Why, there's no mystery about the doldrums,\" said Captain Dall.  \"I've read a book by an officer in the United States navy which explains it all, and the Gulf Stream, and the currents, an' everything.  Come, I'll spin you a yarn about it.\"  Saying this, the captain filled and lighted his pipe, and seating himself on the shank of the anchor, said--  \"You know the cause of ocean currents, I dare say?\"  \"Niver a taste,\" said Larry.  \"It's meself is as innocent about 'em as the babe unborn; an' as for Muggins there, _he_ don't know more about 'em than my ould shoes--\"  \"Or your old grandmother,\" growled Muggins.  \"Don't be irriverent, ye spalpeen,\" said Larry.  \"I ax her reverence's pardon, but I didn't know she wos a priest,\" said Muggins.--\"Go on, Cap'n Dall.\"  \"Well,\" continued the captain, \"you know, at all events, that there's salt in the sea, and I may tell you that there is lime also, besides other things.  At the equator, the heat bein' great, water is evaporated faster than anywhere else, so that there the sea is salter and has more lime in it than elsewhere.  Besides that it is hotter.  Of course, that being the case, its weight is different from the waters of the cold polar seas, so it is bound to move away an' get itself freshened and cooled.  In like manner, the cold water round the poles feels obliged to flow to the equator to get itself salted and warmed.  This state of things, as a natural consequence, causes commotion in the sea.  The commotion is moreover increased by the millions of shell-fish that dwell there.  These creatures, not satisfied with their natural skins, must needs have shells on their backs, and they extract lime from the sea-water for the purpose of makin' these shells.  This process is called secretin' the lime; coral insects do the same, and, as many of the islands of the south seas are made by coral insects, you may guess that a considerable lot of lime is made away with.  The commotion or disturbance thus created produces two great currents--from the equator to the poles and from the poles to the equator.  But there are many little odds and ends about the world that affect and modify these currents, such as depth, and local heat and cold, and rivers and icebergs, but the chief modifiers are continents.  The currents flowin' north from the Indian Ocean and southern seas rush up between Africa and America.  The space bein' narrow--comparatively--they form one strong current, on doublin' the Cape of Good Hope, which flies right across to the Gulf of Mexico.  Here it is turned aside and flows in a nor'-easterly direction, across the Atlantic towards England and Norway, under the name of the Gulf Stream, but the Gulf of Mexico has no more to do with it than the man in the moon, 'xcept in the way of turnin' it out of its nat'ral course.  This Gulf Stream is a _river of warm water_ flowing through the cold waters of the Atlantic; it keeps separate, and wherever it flows the climate is softened.  It embraces Ireland, and makes the climate there so mild that there is, as you know, scarcely any frost"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23271"],["title","Sunk at Sea (#3)"],["body"," the year round--\"  \"Blissin's on it,\" broke in Larry, \"sure that accounts for the purty green face of Erin, which bates all other lands in the world.  Good luck to the Gulf Stream, say I!\"  \"You're right, Larry, and England, Scotland, and Norway have reason to bless it too, for the same latitudes with these places in America have a rigorous winter extendin' over more than half the year.  But what I was comin' to was this--there are, as you know, eddies and stagnant places in ornary rivers, where sticks, leaves, and other odds and ends collect and remain fixed.  So, in this great ocean river, there are eddies where seaweed collects and stagnates, and where the air above also stagnates (for the air currents are very much like those of the sea).  These eddies or stagnant parts are called sargasso seas.  There are several of them, of various sizes, all over the ocean, but there is one big one in the Atlantic, which is known by the name of the `Doldrums.'  It has bothered navigators in all ages.  Columbus got into it on his way to America, and hundreds of ships have been becalmed for weeks in it since the days of that great discoverer.  It is not very long since it was found out that, by keeping well out of their way, and sailing round 'em, navigators could escape the Doldrums altogether.\"  The captain paused at this point, and Larry O'Hale took the opportunity to break in.  \"D'ye know, sir,\" said he, \"that same Gulf Strame has rose a lot o' pecooliar spekilations in my mind, which, if I may make so bowld, I'll--\"  Here the mate's voice interrupted him gruffly with--  \"Shake out a reef in that top-gall'n s'l; look alive, lads!\"  Larry and his comrades sprang to obey.  When they returned to their former place in the bow, the captain had left it, so that the cook's \"pecooliar spekilations\" were not at that time made known.    CHAPTER FOUR.  A STORM AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.  In course of time the _Foam_, proceeding prosperously on her voyage, reached the region of Cape Horn--the cape of storms.  Here, in days of old, Magellan and the early voyagers were fiercely buffeted by winds and waves.  In later days Cook and others met with the same reception.  In fact, the Cape is infamous for its inhospitality, nevertheless it shone with bright smiles when the _Foam_ passed by, and a gentle fair-wind wafted her into the great Pacific Ocean.  Never, since that eventful day when the adventurous Castilian, Vasco Nunez de Balboa, discovered this mighty sea, did the Pacific look more peaceful than it did during the first week in which the _Foam_ floated on its calm breast.  But the calm was deceitful.  It resembled the quiet of the tiger while crouching to make a fatal spring.  Will Osten reclined against the top of the mainmast, to which he had ascended in order to enjoy, undisturbed, the quiet of a magnificent evening.  The sun was setting in a world of clouds, which took the form of mountains fringed with glittering gold and with shadows of pearly grey.  Oh what castles young Osten did build on these mountains, to be sure! Structures so magnificent that Eastern architects, had they seen them, would have hung their heads and confessed themselves outdone.  But you must not imagine, reader, that the magnificence of all of these depended on their magnitude or richness.  On the contrary, one of them was a mere cottage--but then, it was a pattern cottage.  It stood in a palm-wood, on a coral island near the sea-shore, with a stream trickling at its side, and a lake full of wild fowl behind, and the most gorgeous tropical plants clustering round its open windows and door, while inside, seated on a couch, was a beautiful girl of fifteen (whom Will had often imagined, but had not yet seen), whose auburn hair shone like gold in the sun, contrasting well with her lovely complexion, and enhancing the sweetness of a smile which conveyed to the beholder only one idea--love.  Many other castles were built in the clouds at that time by Will, but the cottage made the most lasting impression on his mind.  \"Sleepin'?\" inquired Cupples, the mate, thrusting his head through that orifice in the main-top which is technically called the \"lubber's hole.\"  \"No, meditating,\" answered Will; \"I've been thinking of the coral islands.\"  \"Humph,\" ejaculated the mate contemptuously, for Cupples, although a kind-hearted man, was somewhat cynical and had not a particle of sentiment in his soul.  Indeed he showed so little of this that Larry was wont to say he \"didn't belave he had a sowl at all, but was only a koorious specimen of an animated body.\"  \"It's my opinion, doctor, that you'd as well come down, for it's goin' to blow hard.\"  Will looked in the direction in which the mate pointed, and saw a bank of black clouds rising on the horizon.  At the same moment the captain's voice was heard below shouting--\"Stand by there to reef topsails!\"  This was followed by the command to close-reef.  Then, as the squall drew rapidly nearer, a hurried order was giving to take in all sail.  The squall was evidently a worse one than had at first been expected.  On it came, hissing and curling up the sea before it.  \"Mind your helm!--port a little, port!\"  \"Port it is, sir,\" answered the man at the wheel, in the deep quiet voice of a well-disciplined sailor, whose only concern is to do his duty.  \"Steady!\" cried the captain.  The words had barely left his lips, and the men who had been furling the sails had just gained the deck, when the squall struck them, and the _Foam_ was laid on her beam-ends, hurling all her crew into the scuppers.  At the same time terrible darkness overspread the sky like a pall.  When the men regained their footing, some of them stood bewildered, not knowing what to do; others, whose presence of mind never deserted them, sprang to where the axes were kept, in order to be ready to cut away the masts if necessary.  But the order was not given.  Captain Dall and Will, who had been standing near the binnacle, seized and clung to the wheel.  \"She will right herself,\" said the former, as he observed that the masts rose a little out of the sea.  Fortunately the good ship did so, and then, although there was scarcely a rag of canvas upon her, she sprang away before the hurricane like a sea-gull.  Terrible indeed is the situation of those who are compelled to \"scud under bare poles,\" when He who formed the great deep, puts forth His mighty power, causing them to \"stagger and be at their wits' end.\"  For hours the _Foam_ rushed wildly over the sea, now rising like a cork on the crest of the billows, anon sinking like lead into the valleys between.  She was exposed to double danger; that of being cast upon one of the numerous coral reefs with which the Pacific in some parts abounds, or being \"pooped\" and overwhelmed by the seas which followed her.  During this anxious period little was said or done except in reference to the working of the ship.  Men snatched sleep and food at intervals as they best might.  At length, after two days, the gale began to abate, and the sea to go down.  \"It was sharp while it lasted, captain, but it seems to have done us little harm,\" said Will Osten, on the evening of the second day.  \"True,\" said the captain heartily; \"we'll soon repair damages and make all snug.--Is there much water in the hold, Mr Cupples?\"  The mate answered gloomily that there was a good deal.  It must not be supposed that Mr Cupples' gloominess arose from anxiety. Not at all.  It was simply his nature to be gloomy.  If it had been his duty to have proclaimed the approach of his own marriage, he would have done it as sadly as if it had been the announcement of his death.  His thoughts were gloomy, and his tones were appropriate thereto.  Even his jokes were grave, and his countenance was lugubrious.  \"It is gaining on us, sir,\" added Mr Cupples.  \"Then get all the spare hands to work with buckets immediately,\" said the captain, \"and send the carpenter here; we must have the leak discovered.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" sighed Mr Cupples, as if he had given way to despair; nevertheless, he went off actively to obey the order.  \"A strange man that,\" said the captain, turning to Will; \"he is a capital seaman, and a kind-hearted, honest fellow, yet he is melancholy enough to throw a man into the blues.\"  \"He and I get on famously notwithstanding,\" said Will, with a laugh. \"See, he is running aft--with bad news I fear, for his face is longer if possible than--\"  \"Leak's increasing, sir,\" said the mate hurriedly; \"we must have started a plank.\"  This seemed to be too true.  All hands were now plying pumps and buckets vigorously, and every effort was being made to discover the leak, but in vain.  Hour by hour, inch by inch, the water gained on them, and it soon became apparent that the ship must sink.  It is difficult for those who have never been at sea to realise the feelings of men who are thus suddenly awakened to the awful fact that the vessel which has been their home for many weeks or months can no longer be counted on, and that, in a few hours, they shall be left in open boats, far from land, at the mercy of the wide and stormy sea.  So terrible was the thought to those on board the _Foam_, that every man, from the captain to the cabin-boy, toiled for hours at the pumps in silent desperation.  At last, when it was found that the water gained on them rapidly, and that there was no hope of saving the ship, the captain quietly left off working and put on his coat.  \"Avast pumping, my lads,\" said he, in a grave, earnest tone; the good ship is doomed, and now it behoves us to bow to the will of the Lord, and do the best we can to save our lives.  Stand by to hoist out the boats.  Get up bread and water, steward, and stow in them as much as you can with safety.  Mr Cupples, see my orders carried out, and have the provisions properly divided among the boats.  I want you, doctor, to come below, and help me to get up a few things that will be of use to us.  The prompt energy of the "]]]
