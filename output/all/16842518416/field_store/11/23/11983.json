There would undoubtedly have been dangers, obvious to even the bravest or the most reckless, in an attempt just then to alter the succession; but Anne saw those dangers \"in the most terrific form, and recoiled with horror from the sight.\" Moreover, she had a constitutional objection, as strong as that of Queen Elizabeth herself, to the presence of an intended successor near her throne.  \"She trembled,\" says Somerville, \"at the idea of the presence of a successor, whoever he might be; and the residence of her own brother in England was not less dreadful to her than that of the electoral prince.\"  But it is probable that had she lived longer she would have found herself constrained to put up with the presence either of one claimant or the other.  Her ministers, whoever they might be, would surely have seen the imperative necessity of bringing over to England the man whom the Queen and they had determined to present to the English people as the destined heir of the throne.  In such an event as that, and most assuredly if men like Bolingbroke had been in power, it may be taken for granted that the Queen would have preferred her own brother, a Stuart, to the Electoral Prince of Hanover.  \"What the consequence might have been, if the Queen had survived,\" says Somerville, \"is merely a matter of conjecture; but we may {15} pronounce, with some degree of assurance, that the Protestant interest would have been exposed to more certain and to more imminent dangers than ever had threatened it before at any period since the revolution.\" This seems a reasonable and just assertion.  If Anne had lived much longer, it is possible that England might have seen a James the Third.     {16}  CHAPTER II.  PARTIES AND LEADERS.  [Sidenote: 1714--Whig and Tory]  All the closing months of Queen Anne's reign were occupied by Whigs and Tories, and indeed by Anne herself as well, in the invention and conduct of intrigues about the succession.  The Queen herself, with the grave opening before her, kept her fading eyes turned, not to the world she was about to enter, but to the world she was about to leave.  She was thinking much more about the future of her throne than about her own soul and future state.  The Whigs were quite ready to maintain the Hanoverian succession by force.  They did not expect to be able to carry matters easily, and they were ready to encounter a civil war. Their belief seems to have been that they and not their opponents would have to strike the blow, and they had already summoned the Duke of Marlborough from his retirement in Flanders to take the lead in their movement.  Having Marlborough, they knew that they would have the army. On the other hand, if Bolingbroke and the Tories really had any actual hope of a restoration of the Stuarts, it is certain that up to the last moment they had made no substantial preparations to accomplish their object.  The Whigs and Tories divided between them whatever political force there was in English society at this time.  Outside both parties lay a considerable section of people who did not distinctly belong to the one faction or the other, but were ready to incline now to this and now to that, according as the conditions of the hour might inspire them. Outside these again, and far outnumbering these and all others combined, was the great mass of the English {17} people--hard-working, much-suffering, poor, patient, and almost absolutely indifferent to changes in governments and the humors and struggles of parties.  \"These wrangling jars of Whig and Tory,\" says Dean Swift, \"are stale and old as Troy-town story.\"  But if the principles were old, the titles of the parties were new.  Steele, in 1710, published in the _Tatler_ a letter from Pasquin of Rome to Isaac Bickerstaff, asking for \"an account of those two religious orders which have lately sprung up amongst you, the Whigs and the Tories.\"  Steele declared that you could not come even among women \"but you find them divided into Whig and Tory.\"  It was like the famous lawsuit in Abdera, alluded to by Lucian and amplified by Wieland, concerning the ownership of the ass's shadow, on which all the Abderites took sides, and every one was either a \"Shadow\" or an \"Ass.\"  Various explanations have been given of these titles Whig and Tory. Titus Oates applied the term \"Tory,\" which then signified an Irish robber, to those who would not believe in his Popish plot, and the name gradually became extended to all who were supposed to have sympathy with the Catholic Duke of York.  The word \"Whig\" first arose during the Cameronian rising, when it was applied to the Scotch Presbyterians, and is derived by some from the whey which they habitually drank, and by others from a word, \"whiggam,\" used by the western Scottish drovers.  The Whigs and the Tories represent in the main not only two political doctrines, but two different feelings in the human mind.  The natural tendency of some men is to regard political liberty as of more importance than political authority, and of other men to think that the maintenance of authority is the first object to be secured, and that only so much of individual liberty is to be conceded as will not interfere with authority's strictest exercise.  Roughly speaking, therefore, the Tories were for authority, and the Whigs for liberty. The Tories naturally held to the principle of the monarchy and of the State church; the Whigs {18} were inclined for the supremacy of Parliament, and for something like an approach to religious equality. [Sidenote: 1714--Political change] Up to this time at least the Tory party still accepted the theory of the Divine origin of the king's supremacy.  The Whigs were even then the advocates of a constitutional system, and held that the people at large were the source of monarchical power.  To the one set of men the sovereign was a divinely appointed ruler; to the other he was the hereditary chief of the realm, having the source of his authority in popular election.  The Tories, as the Church party, disliked the Dissenters even more than they disliked the Roman Catholics.  The Whigs were then even inclined to regard the Church as a branch of the Civil Service--to adopt a much more modern phrase--and they were in favor of extending freedom of worship to Dissenters, and in a certain sense to Roman Catholics.  According to Bishop Burnet, it was in the reign of Queen Anne that the distinction between High-Church and Low-Church first marked itself out, and we find almost as a natural necessity that the High-Churchmen were Tories, and the Low-Churchmen were Whigs.  Then as now the chief strength of the Tories was found in the country, and not in the large towns.  So far as town populations were concerned, the Tories were proportionately strongest where the borough was smallest.  The great bulk of the agricultural population, so far as it had definite political feelings, was distinctly Tory.  The strength of the Whigs lay in the manufacturing towns and the great ports.  London was at that time much stronger in its Liberal political sentiments than it has been more recently.  The moneyed interest, the bankers, the merchants, were attached to the Whig party.  Many peers and bishops were Whigs, but they were chiefly the peers and bishops who owed their appointments to William the Third.  The French envoy, D'Iberville, at this time describes the Whigs as having at their command the best purses, the best swords, the ablest heads, and the handsomest women.  The Tory party was strong at the University of Oxford; the Whig party was {19} in greater force at Cambridge.  Both Whigs and Tories, however, were in a somewhat subdued condition of mind about the time that Anne's reign was closing.  Neither party as a whole was inclined to push its political principles to anything like a logical extreme.  Whigs and Tories alike were practically satisfied with the form which the English governing system had put on after the Revolution of 1688.  Neither party was inclined for another revolution.  The civil war had carried the Whig principle a little too far for the Whigs.  The Restoration had brought a certain amount of scandal on sovereign authority and the principle of Divine right.  The minds of men were settling down into willingness for a compromise.  There were, of course, among the Tories the extreme party, so pledged to the restoration of the Stuarts that they would have moved heaven and earth, at all events they would have convulsed England, for the sake of bringing them back.  These men constituted what would now be called in the language of French politics the Extreme Right of the Tory party; they would become of importance at any hour when some actual movement was made from the outside to restore the Stuarts.  Such a movement would of course have carried with it and with them the great bulk of the new quiescent Tory party; but in the mean time, and until some such movement was made, the Jacobite section of the Tories was not in a condition to be active or influential, and was not a serious difficulty in the way of the Hanoverian succession.  The Whigs had great advantages on their side.  They had a clear principle to start with.  The constitutional errors and excesses of the Stuarts had forced on the mind of England a recognition of the two or three main principles of civil and religious liberty.  The Whigs knew what they wanted better than the Tories did, and the ends which the Whigs proposed to gain were attainable, while those which the Tories set out for themselves were to a great extent lost in dream-land.  The uncertainty and vagueness of many of the Tory aims made some of the {20} Tories themselves only half earnest in their purposes.  Many a Tory who talked as loudly as his brothers about the king having his own again, and who toasted \"the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23469"],["title","A History of the Four Georges, Volume I (#4)"],["body","over the water\" as freely as they, had in the bottom of his heart very little real anxiety to see a rebellion end in a Stuart restoration.  But, on the other hand, the Whigs could strive with all their might and main to carry out their principles in Church and in State without the responsibility of plunging the country into rebellion, and without any dread of seeing their projects melt away into visions and chimeras.  A great band of landed proprietors formed the leaders of the Whigs.  Times have changed since then, and the representatives of some of those great houses which then led the Whig party have passed or glided insensibly into the ranks of the Tories; but the main reason for this is because a Tory of our day represents fairly enough, in certain political aspects, the Whig of the days of Queen Anne.  What is called in American politics a new departure has taken place in England since that time; the Radical party has come into existence with political principles and watchwords quite different even from those of the early Whigs.  Some of the Whig houses, not many, have gone with the forward movement; some have remained behind, and so lapsed almost insensibly into the Tory quarter.  But at the close of Queen Anne's reign all the great leading Whigs stood well together.  They understood better than the Tories did the necessity of obtaining superior influence in the House of Commons.  They even contrived at that time to secure the majority of the county constituencies, while they had naturally the majority of the commercial class on their side.  Then, as in later days, the vast wealth of the Whig families was spent unstintingly, and it may be said unblushingly, in securing the possession of the small constituencies, the constituencies which were only to be had by liberal bribery.  Then, as afterwards, there was perceptible in the Whig party a strange combination of dignity and of meanness, of great principles and of somewhat degraded practices.  They had high {21} purposes; they recognized noble principles, and they held to them; they were for political liberty as they then understood it, and they were for religious equality--for such approach at least to religious equality as had then come to be sanctioned by responsible politicians in England. They were ready to make great sacrifices in defence of their political creed.  But the principles and purposes with which they started, and to which they kept, did not succeed in purifying and ennobling all their parliamentary strategy and political conduct.  They intrigued, they bribed, they bought, they cajoled, they paltered, they threatened, they made unsparing use of money and of power, they employed every art to carry out high and national purposes which the most unscrupulous cabal could have used to secure the attainment of selfish and ignoble ends. Their enemies had put one great advantage into their hands.  The conduct of Bolingbroke and of Oxford during recent years had left the Whigs the sole representatives of constitutional liberty.  [Sidenote: 1714--Anarchy or \"Perkin\"]  The two great political parties hated and denounced each other with a ferocity hardly known before, and hardly possible in our later times. The Whigs vituperated the Tories as rebels and traitors; the Tories cried out against the Whigs as the enemies of religion and the opponents of \"the true Church of England.\"  Many a ballad of that time described the Whigs as men whose object it was to destroy both mitre and crown, to introduce anarchy once again, as they had done in the days of Oliver Cromwell.  The Whig balladists retorted by describing the Tories as men who were engaged in trying to bring in \"Perkin\" from France, and prophesied the halter as a reward of their leading statesmen.  In truth, the bitterness of that hour was very earnest; most of the men on both sides meant what they said.  Either side, if it had been in complete preponderance, would probably have had very little scruple in disposing of its leading enemies by means of the halter or the prison.  It was for the time not so much a struggle of political parties as a {22} struggle of hostile armies.  The men were serious and savage, because the crisis was serious and portentous.  The chances of an hour might make a man a prime-minister or a prisoner.  Bolingbroke soon after was in exile, and Walpole at the head of the administration. The slightest chance, the merest accident, might have sent Walpole into exile, and put Bolingbroke at the head of the State.  [Sidenote: 1714--John Churchill]  The eyes of the English public were at this moment turned in especial to watch the movements of two men--the Duke of Marlborough and Lord Bolingbroke.  Marlborough was beyond question the greatest soldier of his time.  He had gone into exile when Queen Anne consented to degrade him and to persecute him, and now he was on his way home, at the urgent entreaty of the Whig leaders, in order to lend his powerful influence to the Hanoverian cause.  The character of the Duke of Marlborough is one which ought to be especially attractive to the authors of romance and the lovers of strong, bold portrait-painting.  One peculiar difficulty, however, a romancist would have in dealing with Marlborough--he could hardly venture to paint Marlborough as nature and fortune made him.  The romancist would find himself compelled to soften and to modify many of the distinctive traits of Marlborough's character, in order that he might not seem the mere inventor of a human paradox, in order that he might not appear to be indulging in the fantastic and the impossible. Pope has called Bacon \"the wisest, brightest, meanest of mankind,\" but Bacon was not greater in his own path than Marlborough in his, and Bacon's worst meannesses were nobility itself compared with some of Marlborough's political offences.  Marlborough started in life with almost every advantage that man could have--with genius, with boundless courage, with personal beauty, with favoring friends.  From his early youth he had been attached to James the Second and James the Second's court.  One of Marlborough's {23} biographers even suggests that the Duchess of York, James's first wife, was needlessly fond of young Churchill.  The beautiful Duchess of Cleveland--she of whom Pepys said \"that everything she did became her\"--was passionately in love with Marlborough, and, according to some writers, gave him his first start in life when she presented him with five thousand pounds, which Marlborough, prudent then as ever, invested in an annuity of five hundred a year.  Burnet said of him that \"he knew the arts of living in a court beyond any man in it; he caressed all people with a soft and obliging deportment, and was always ready to do good offices.\"  His only personal defect was in his voice, which was shrill and disagreeable.  He was, through all his life, avaricious to the last degree; he grasped at money wherever he could get it; he took money from women as well as from men.  A familiar story of the time represents another nobleman as having been mistaken for the Duke of Marlborough by a mob, at a time when Marlborough was unpopular, and extricating himself from the difficulty by telling the crowd he could not possibly be the Duke of Marlborough, first, because he had only two guineas in his pocket, and next, because he was perfectly ready to give them away.  Marlborough had received the highest favors from James the Second, but he quitted James in the hour of his misfortunes, only, however, it should be said, to return secretly to his service at a time when he was professing devotion to William the Third.  He betrayed each side to the other.  In the same year, and almost in the same month, he writes to the Elector at Hanover and to the Pretender in France, pouring forth to each alike his protestations of devotion.  \"I shall be always ready to hazard my fortune and my life for your service,\" he tells the Elector.  \"I had rather have my hands cut off than do anything prejudicial to King James's cause,\" he tells an agent of the Stuarts.  James appears to have believed in Marlborough, and William, while he made use of him, to have had no faith in him.  \"The Duke of Marlborough,\" William {24} said, \"has the best talents for a general of any man in England; but he is a vile man and I hate him, for though I can profit by treasons I cannot bear the traitor.\"  William's saying was strikingly like that one ascribed to Philip of Macedon.  Schomberg spoke of Marlborough as \"the first lieutenant-general whom I ever remember to have deserted his colors.\"  Lord Granard, who was in the camp of King James the Second on Salisbury Plain, told Dr. King, who has recorded the story, that Churchill and some other colonels invited Lord Granard to supper, and opened to him their design of deserting to the Prince of Orange.  Granard not merely refused to enter into the conspiracy, but went to the King and told him the whole story, advising him to seize Marlborough and the other conspirators.  Perhaps if this advice had been followed, King William would never have come to the throne of England.  James, however, gave no credit to the story, and took no trouble about it.  Next morning he found his mistake; but it was then too late.  The truth of this story is corroborated by other authorities, one of them being King James himself, who afterwards stated that he had received information of Lord Churchill's designs, and was recommended to seize his person, but that he unfortunately neglected to avail himself of the advice.  \"Speak of that no more,\" says Egmont, in Goethe's play; \"I _was_ warned.\"  [Sidenote: 1714--Marlborough]  Swift said of Marlborough that \"he is as covetous as hell, and ambitious as the prince of it.\"  Marlborough was as ignorant as he was avaricious.  Literary taste or instinct he must have had, because he read with so much eagerness the historical plays of Shakespeare, and indeed frankly owned that"]]]
