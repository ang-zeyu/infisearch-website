His words, his actions, his policy, his schemes, his faults, his vices, were thorough English.  It was as an Englishman, as an English citizen, more than as a statesman or an orator, that he bore down Bolingbroke in this memorable debate.  [Sidenote: 1734--Bolingbroke a hurtful ally]  Bolingbroke must have felt himself borne down.  He did not long carry on the struggle into which he had plunged with so much alacrity and energy, with such malice and such hope.  Pulteney advised him to go back for a while to France, and in the early part of 1734 he took the advice and went.  \"My part is over,\" he wrote to Wyndham, in words which have a certain pathetic dignity in them, \"and he who remains on the stage after his part is over deserves to be hissed off.\"  His departure--it might almost be called his second flight--to the Continent was probably hastened also by the knowledge that a pamphlet was about to be published by some of his enemies, containing a series of letters which had passed between him and James Stuart's secretary, after Bolingbroke's dismissal from the service of James in 1716.  The pamphlet was suppressed immediately on its appearance, but its contents have been republished, and they were certainly not of a character to render Bolingbroke any the less unpopular among Englishmen.  The correspondence consisted in a series of letters that passed between Bolingbroke, through his secretary, and Mr. James Murray, acting on behalf of James Stuart, from whom he afterwards received the title of Earl of Dunbar.  The letters are little more than mere recriminations.  Bolingbroke is accused of having brought about the failure of the insurrection of 1715 by weakness, folly, and {19} even downright treachery.  Bolingbroke flings back the charges at the head of James's friends, and even of James himself.  There was nothing brought out in 1734 and 1735 to affect the career and conduct of Bolingbroke which all England did not know pretty well already.  Still, the revival of these old stories must have seemed to Bolingbroke very inconvenient and dangerous at such a time.  The correspondence reminded England once more that Bolingbroke had been the agent of the exiled Stuarts in the work of stirring up a civil war for the overthrow of the House of Hanover.  No doubt the publication quickened Bolingbroke's desire to get out of England.  But he would have gone, in any case; he would have had to go.  The whole cabal with Pulteney had been a failure; Bolingbroke would thenceforward be a hinderance rather than a help to the Patriots.  His counsel was of no further avail, and he only brought odium on them; indeed, his advice had from first to last been misleading and ill-omened.  The Patriots were now only anxious to get rid of him; Pulteney gave Bolingbroke pretty clearly to understand that they wanted him to go, and he went.  Walpole's speech, and the whole of the debate of which it made so striking a feature, could not but have a powerful effect on the general elections.  Parliament was dissolved on April 10, 1734, after having nearly run the full course of seven years.  Seldom has a general election been contested with such a prodigality of partisan fury and public corruption.  Walpole scattered his purchase-money everywhere; he sowed with the sack and not with the hand, to adopt the famous saying applied by a Greek poetess to Pindar.  In supporting two candidates for Norfolk, who were both beaten, despite his support, he spent out of his private fortune at least 10,000 pounds; one contemporary says 60,000 pounds.  But the Opposition spent just as freely--more freely, perhaps. It must be remembered that even so pure-minded a man as Burke has contended that \"the charge of systematic corruption\" was less applicable, perhaps, to Walpole \"than to any other minister who ever {20} served the Crown for such a length of time.\"  The Opposition were decidedly more reckless in their incitements to violence than the friends of the Ministry.  The _Craftsman_ boasted that when Walpole came to give his vote as an honorary freeman at Norwich the people called aloud to have the bribery oath administered to him; called on him to swear that he had received no money for his vote.  All the efforts of the Patriots, or the representatives of the country interest, as they now preferred to call themselves, failed to bring about the end they aimed at.  They did, indeed, increase their parliamentary vote a little, but the increase was not enough to make any material difference in their position.  All the wit, the eloquence, the craft, the courage, the unscrupulous use of every weapon of political warfare that could be seized and handled, had been thrown away.  Walpole was, for the time, just as strong as ever.  [Sidenote: 1735--Swift's opinion of Arbuthnot]  We turn aside from the movement and rush of politics to lay a memorial spray on the grave of a good and a gifted man.  Dr. Arbuthnot died in February, 1735, only sixty years old.  \"Poor Arbuthnot,\" Pulteney writes to Swift, \"who grieved to see the wickedness of mankind, and was particularly esteemed of his own countrymen, is dead.  He lived the last six months in a bad state of health, and hoping every night would be his last; not that he endured any bodily pain, but as he was quite weary of the world, and tired with so much bad company.\"  Alderman Barber, in a letter to Swift a few days after, says much the same.  He is afraid, he tells Swift, that Arbuthnot did not take as much care of himself as he ought to have done.  \"Possibly he might think the play not worth the candle.  You may remember Dr. Garth said he was glad when he was dying, for he was weary of having his shoes pulled off and on.\" A letter from Arbuthnot himself to Swift, written a short time before his death, is not, however, filled with mere discontent, does not breathe only a morbid weariness of life, but rather testifies to a serene and noble resignation.  \"I am going,\" he tells Swift, \"out {21} of this troublesome world, and you, amongst the rest of my friends, shall have my last prayers and good wishes.  I am afraid, my dear friend, we shall never see one another more in this world.  I shall to the last moment preserve my love and esteem for you, being well assured you will never leave the paths of virtue and honor for all that is in the world.  This world is not worth the least deviation from that way.\" Thus the great physician, scientific scholar, and humorist awaited his death and died.  We have spoken already in this history of Arbuthnot's marvellous humor and satire.  Macaulay, in his essay on \"The Life and Writings of Addison,\" says \"there are passages in Arbuthnot's satirical works which we, at least, cannot distinguish from Swift's best writing.\"  Swift himself spoke of Arbuthnot in yet higher terms.  \"He has more wit than we all have,\" was Swift's declaration, \"and his humanity is equal to his wit.\"  There are not many satirists known to men during all literary history of whom quite so much could be said with any faintest color of a regard for truth.  Swift was too warm in his friendly panegyric on Arbuthnot's humor, but he did not too highly estimate Arbuthnot's humanity.  Humor is among man's highest gifts, and has done the world splendid service; but humor and humanity together make the mercy winged with brave actions, which, according to Massinger, befit \"a soul moulded for heaven\" and destined to be \"made a star there.\"     {22}  CHAPTER XXII.  THE \"FAMILY COMPACT.\"  [Sidenote: 1735--The Polish throne]  The new Parliament met on January 14, 1735.  The Royal intimation was given to the House of Commons by the Lord Chancellor that it was his Majesty's pleasure that they should return to their own House and choose a Speaker.  Arthur Onslow was unanimously elected, or rather re-elected, to the chair he had filled with so much distinction in the former Parliament.  The speech from the throne was not delivered until January 23.  The speech was almost all taken up with foreign affairs, with the war on the Continent, and the efforts of the King and his ministers, in combination with the States General of the United Provinces, to extinguish it.  \"I have the satisfaction to acquaint you,\" the King said, \"that things are now brought to so great a forwardness that I hope in a short time a plan will be offered to the consideration of all the parties engaged in the present war, as a basis for a general negotiation of peace, in which the honor and the interest of all parties have been consulted as far as the circumstances of time and the present posture of affairs would admit.\"  The Royal speech did not contain one single word which had to do with the internal condition of England, with the daily lives of the English people.  No legislation was promised, or even hinted at, which concerned the domestic interests of these islands.  The House of Lords set to work at once in the preparation of an address in reply to the speech from the throne; and they, too, debated only of foreign affairs, and took no more account of their own fellow-countrymen than of the dwellers in Jupiter or Saturn.  {23}  The war to which the Royal speech referred had been dragging along for some time.  No quarrel could have less direct interest for the English people than that about which the Emperor Charles the Sixth and the King of France, Louis the Fifteenth, were fighting.  On the death of Augustus the Second of Poland, in February, 1733, Louis thought it a good opportunity for putting his own father-in-law, Stanislaus Leszczynski, back on the throne of Poland, from which he had twice been driven.  Poland was a republic with an elective king, and a very peculiar form of constitution, by virtue of which any one of the estates or electoral colleges of the realm was in a position to stop the action of all the others at any crisis when decision was especially needed.  The result of this was that the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23470"],["title","A History of the Four Georges, Volume II (#5)"],["body","king was always a nominee of one or another of the great Continental Powers who took it on themselves to intervene in the affairs of Poland.  The election of a King of Poland was always a mere struggle between these Powers: the strongest at the moment carried its man.  Stanislaus, the father of Louis the Fifteenth's wife, had been a _protégé_ of Charles the Twelfth of Sweden.  He was a man of illustrious family and of great and varied abilities, a scholar and a writer.  Charles drove Augustus the Second, Augustus, Elector of Saxony, from the throne of Poland, and set up Stanislaus in his place.  Stanislaus, however, was driven out of the country by Augustus and his friends, who rallied and became strong in the temporary difficulties of Charles.  When Charles found time to turn his attention to Poland he soon overthrew Augustus and set up Stanislaus once again.  But \"hide, blushing glory, hide Pultowa's day\"; the fall of the great Charles came, and brought with it the fall of Stanislaus.  Augustus re-entered Poland at the head of a Saxon army, and Stanislaus was compelled to abdicate.  Now that Augustus was dead, Louis the Fifteenth determined to bring Stanislaus out from his retirement of many years and set him for the third time on the Polish throne.  On the other hand, the Emperor and Russia alike favored the son of {24} the late king, another Augustus, Elector of Saxony.  The French party carried Stanislaus, although at the time of his abdication, three or four and twenty years before, he had been declared incapable of ever again being elected King of Poland.  The Saxon party, secretly backed up by Russia, resisted Stanislaus, attacked his partisans, drove him once more from Warsaw, and proclaimed Augustus the Third.  Louis of France declared war, not on Russia, but on the Emperor, alleging that the Emperor had been the inspiration and support of the Saxon movement.  A French army under Marshal Berwick, son of James the Second of England, crossed the Rhine and took the fort of Kehl--the scene of a memorable crossing of the Rhine, to be recrossed very rapidly after, in days nearer to our own.  Spain and Sardinia were in alliance with Louis, and the Emperor's army, although led by the great Eugene, \"Der edle Ritter,\" was not able to make head against the French.  The Emperor sent frequent urgent and impassioned appeals to England for assistance.  George was anxious to lend him a helping hand, clamored to be allowed to take the field himself and win glory in battle; camps and battle-fields were what he loved most, he kept dinning into Walpole's unappreciative ear.  Even the Queen was not disinclined to draw the sword in defence of an imperilled and harassed ally.  [Sidenote: 1735--The Emperor's denunciation of Walpole]  Walpole stuck to his policy of masterly inactivity.  He would have wished to exclude Stanislaus from the Polish throne, but he was not willing to go to war with France.  He could not bring himself to believe that the interests of England were concerned in the struggle to such a degree as to warrant the waste of English money and the pouring out of English blood.  But he did not take his stand on such a broad and clear position; indeed at that time it would not have been a firm or a tenable position.  Walpole did not venture to say that the question whether this man or that was to sit on the throne of Poland was not worth the life of one British grenadier.  The time had not come when even a great minister might venture {25} to look at an international quarrel from such a point of view.  Walpole temporized, delayed, endeavored to bring about a reconciliation of claims; endeavored to get at something like a mediation; carried on prolonged negotiations with the Government of the Netherlands to induce the States General to join with England in an offer of mediation.  The Emperor was all the time sending despatches to England, in which he bitterly complained that he had been deceived and deserted.  He laid all the blame on Walpole's head.  Pages of denunciation of Walpole and all Walpole's family are to be found in these imperial despatches. Walpole remained firm to his purpose.  He would not go to war, but it did not suit him to proclaim his determination.  He kept up his appearance of active negotiation, and he trusted to time to settle the question one way or the other before King George should get too restive, and should insist on plunging into the war.  He had many an uneasy hour, but his policy succeeded in the end.  The controversy out of which the war began was complicated by other questions and made formidable by the rival pursuit of other ends than those to be acknowledged in public treaty.  It would be unjust and even absurd to suppose that Walpole's opponents believed England had a direct interest in the question of the Polish succession, or that they would have shed the blood of English grenadiers merely in order that this candidate and not that should be on the throne of Poland.  What the Opposition contended was that the alliance of France and Spain was in reality directed quite as much against England as against the Emperor.  In this they were perfectly right.  It was directed as much against England as against the Emperor.  Little more than forty years ago a collection of treaties and engagements entered into by the Spanish branch of the Bourbon family found its way to the light of day in Madrid.  The publication was the means of pouring a very flood of light on some events which perplexed and distracted the outer world in the days at {26} which, in the course of this history, we have now arrived.  We speak especially of the Polish war of succession and the policy pursued with regard to it by France and Spain.  The collection of documents contained a copy of a treaty or arrangement entered into between the King of France and the King of Spain in 1733.  This was, in fact, the first family compact, the first of a series of family compacts, entered into between the Bourbons in Versailles and the Bourbons in Madrid.  The engagement, which in modern European history is conventionally known as \"the family compact\" between the Bourbon Houses, the compact of 1761, the compact which Burke described as \"the most odious and formidable of all the conspiracies against the liberties of Europe that ever have been framed,\" was really only the third of a series.  The second compact was in 1743.  The object of these successive agreements was one and the same: to maintain and extend the possessions of the Bourbons in Europe and outside Europe, and to weaken and divide the supposed enemies of Bourbon supremacy. England was directly aimed at as one of the foremost of those enemies. In the compact of 1733 the King of France and the King of Spain pledged themselves to the interests of \"the most serene infant Don Carlos,\" afterwards for a time King of the Sicilies, and then finally King of Spain.  The compact defined the alliance as \"a mutual guarantee of all the possessions and the honor, interests, and glory\" of the two Houses. It was described as an alliance to protect Don Carlos, and the family generally, against the Emperor and against England.  France bound herself to aid Spain with all her forces by land or sea if Spain should see fit to suspend \"England's enjoyment of commerce,\" and England should retaliate by hostilities on the dominions of Spain, within or outside of Europe.  The French King also pledged himself to employ without interruption his most pressing instances to induce the King of Great Britain to restore Gibraltar to Spain; pledged himself even to use force for this purpose if necessary.  There were full and precise {27} stipulations about the disposition of armies and naval squadrons under various conditions.  One article in the treaty bluntly declared that the foreign policy of both States, France and Spain, was to be \"guided exclusively by the interests of the House.\"  The engagement was to be kept secret, and was to be regarded \"from that day as an eternal and irrevocable family compact.\"  No conspiracy ever could have been more flagrant, more selfish, and more cruel.  The deeper we get into the secrets of European history, the more we come to learn the truth that the crowned conspirators were always the worst.  [Sidenote: 1735--Compact between the Houses of Bourbon]  This first family compact is the key to all the subsequent history of European wars down to the days of the French Revolution.  The object of one set of men was to maintain and add to the advantages secured to them by the Treaty of Utrecht; the object of another set of men was to shake themselves free from the disadvantages and disqualifications which that treaty imposed on them.  The Bourbon family were possessed with the determination to maintain the position in Spain which the will of Charles the Second had bequeathed to them, and which after so many years of war and blood had been ratified by the Treaty of Utrecht. They wanted to maintain their position in Spain; but they wanted not that alone.  They wanted much more.  They wanted to plant a firm foot in Italy; they wanted to annex border provinces to France; they saw that their great enemy was England, and they wanted to weaken and to damage her.  No reasonable Englishman can find fault with the Kings of Spain for their desire to recover Gibraltar.  An English sovereign would have conspired with any foreign State for the recovery of Dover Castle and rock if these were held by a Spanish invader too strong to be driven out by England single-handed.  Many Englishmen were of opinion then, some are of opinion now, that it would be an act of wise and generous policy to give Gibraltar back to the Spanish people.  But no Englishman could possibly doubt that if England were determined to keep Gibraltar she must {28} hold it her duty to watch with the keenest attention every movement which indicated an alliance between France and Spain.
