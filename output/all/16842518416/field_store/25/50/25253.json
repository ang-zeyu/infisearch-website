Mike worked his way cautiously through these till he was out of sight, then tore for the regions at the back.  The moon had gone behind the clouds, and it was not easy to find a way through the bushes. Twice branches sprang out from nowhere, and hit Mike smartly over the shins, eliciting sharp howls of pain.  On the second of these occasions a low voice spoke from somewhere on his right.  “Who on earth’s that?” it said.  Mike stopped.  “Is that you, Wyatt? I say----”  “Jackson!”  The moon came out again, and Mike saw Wyatt clearly. His knees were covered with mould. He had evidently been crouching in the bushes on all fours.  “You young ass,” said Wyatt. “You promised me that you wouldn’t get out.”  “Yes, I know, but----”  “I heard you crashing through the shrubbery like a hundred elephants. If you _must_ get out at night and chance being sacked, you might at least have the sense to walk quietly.”  “Yes, but you don’t understand.”  And Mike rapidly explained the situation.  “But how the dickens did he hear you, if you were in the dining-room?” asked Wyatt. “It’s miles from his bedroom. You must tread like a policeman.”  “It wasn’t that. The thing was, you see, it was rather a rotten thing to do, I suppose, but I turned on the gramophone.”  “You--_what?_”  “The gramophone. It started playing ‘The Quaint Old Bird.’ Ripping it was, till Wain came along.”  Wyatt doubled up with noiseless laughter.  “You’re a genius,” he said. “I never saw such a man. Well, what’s the game now? What’s the idea?”  “I think you’d better nip back along the wall and in through the window, and I’ll go back to the dining-room. Then it’ll be all right if Wain comes and looks into the dorm. Or, if you like, you might come down too, as if you’d just woke up and thought you’d heard a row.”  “That’s not a bad idea. All right. You dash along then. I’ll get back.”  Mr. Wain was still in the dining-room, drinking in the beauties of the summer night through the open window. He gibbered slightly when Mike reappeared.  “Jackson! What do you mean by running about outside the house in this way! I shall punish you very heavily. I shall certainly report the matter to the headmaster. I will not have boys rushing about the garden in their pyjamas. You will catch an exceedingly bad cold. You will do me two hundred lines, Latin and English. Exceedingly so. I will not have it. Did you not hear me call to you?”  “Please, sir, so excited,” said Mike, standing outside with his hands on the sill.  “You have no business to be excited. I will not have it. It is exceedingly impertinent of you.”  “Please, sir, may I come in?”  “Come in! Of course, come in. Have you no sense, boy? You are laying the seeds of a bad cold. Come in at once.”  Mike clambered through the window.  “I couldn’t find him, sir. He must have got out of the garden.”  “Undoubtedly,” said Mr. Wain. “Undoubtedly so. It was very wrong of you to search for him. You have been seriously injured. Exceedingly so”  He was about to say more on the subject when Wyatt strolled into the room. Wyatt wore the rather dazed expression of one who has been aroused from deep sleep. He yawned before he spoke.  “I thought I heard a noise, sir,” he said.  He called Mr. Wain “father” in private, “sir” in public. The presence of Mike made this a public occasion.  “Has there been a burglary?”  “Yes,” said Mike, “only he has got away.”  “Shall I go out into the garden, and have a look round, sir?” asked Wyatt helpfully.  The question stung Mr. Wain into active eruption once more.  “Under no circumstances whatever,” he said excitedly. “Stay where you are, James. I will not have boys running about my garden at night. It is preposterous. Inordinately so. Both of you go to bed immediately. I shall not speak to you again on this subject. I must be obeyed instantly. You hear me, Jackson? James, you understand me? To bed at once. And, if I find you outside your dormitory again to-night, you will both be punished with extreme severity. I will not have this lax and reckless behaviour.”  “But the burglar, sir?” said Wyatt.  “We might catch him, sir,” said Mike.  Mr. Wain’s manner changed to a slow and stately sarcasm, in much the same way as a motor-car changes from the top speed to its first.  “I was under the impression,” he said, in the heavy way almost invariably affected by weak masters in their dealings with the obstreperous, “I was distinctly under the impression that I had ordered you to retire immediately to your dormitory. It is possible that you mistook my meaning. In that case I shall be happy to repeat what I said. It is also in my mind that I threatened to punish you with the utmost severity if you did not retire at once. In these circumstances, James--and you, Jackson--you will doubtless see the necessity of complying with my wishes.”  They made it so.     CHAPTER VII  IN WHICH MIKE IS DISCUSSED   Trevor and Clowes, of Donaldson’s, were sitting in their study a week after the gramophone incident, preparatory to going on the river. At least Trevor was in the study, getting tea ready. Clowes was on the window-sill, one leg in the room, the other outside, hanging over space. He loved to sit in this attitude, watching some one else work, and giving his views on life to whoever would listen to them. Clowes was tall, and looked sad, which he was not. Trevor was shorter, and very much in earnest over all that he did. On the present occasion he was measuring out tea with a concentration worthy of a general planning a campaign.  “One for the pot,” said Clowes.  “All right,” breathed Trevor. “Come and help, you slacker.”  “Too busy.”  “You aren’t doing a stroke.”  “My lad, I’m thinking of Life. That’s a thing you couldn’t do. I often say to people, ‘Good chap, Trevor, but can’t think of Life. Give him a tea-pot and half a pound of butter to mess about with,’ I say, ‘and he’s all right. But when it comes to deep thought, where is he? Among the also-rans.’ That’s what I say.”  “Silly ass,” said Trevor, slicing bread. “What particular rot were you thinking about just then? What fun it was sitting back and watching other fellows work, I should think.”  “My mind at the moment,” said Clowes, “was tensely occupied with the problem of brothers at school. Have you got any brothers, Trevor?”  “One. Couple of years younger than me. I say, we shall want some more jam to-morrow. Better order it to-day.”  “See it done, Tigellinus, as our old pal Nero used to remark. Where is he? Your brother, I mean.”  “Marlborough.”  “That shows your sense. I have always had a high opinion of your sense, Trevor. If you’d been a silly ass, you’d have let your people send him here.”  “Why not? Shouldn’t have minded.”  “I withdraw what I said about your sense. Consider it unsaid. I have a brother myself. Aged fifteen. Not a bad chap in his way. Like the heroes of the school stories. ‘Big blue eyes literally bubbling over with fun.’ At least, I suppose it’s fun to him. Cheek’s what I call it. My people wanted to send him here. I lodged a protest. I said, ‘One Clowes is ample for any public school.’”  “You were right there,” said Trevor.  “I said, ‘One Clowes is luxury, two excess.’ I pointed out that I was just on the verge of becoming rather a blood at Wrykyn, and that I didn’t want the work of years spoiled by a brother who would think it a rag to tell fellows who respected and admired me----”  “Such as who?”  “----Anecdotes of a chequered infancy. There are stories about me which only my brother knows. Did I want them spread about the school? No, laddie, I did not. Hence, we see my brother two terms ago, packing up his little box, and tooling off to Rugby. And here am I at Wrykyn, with an unstained reputation, loved by all who know me, revered by all who don’t; courted by boys, fawned upon by masters. People’s faces brighten when I throw them a nod. If I frown----”  “Oh, come on,” said Trevor.  Bread and jam and cake monopolised Clowes’s attention for the next quarter of an hour. At the end of that period, however, he returned to his subject.  “After the serious business of the meal was concluded, and a simple hymn had been sung by those present,” he said, “Mr. Clowes resumed his very interesting remarks. We were on the subject of brothers at school. Now, take the melancholy case of Jackson Brothers. My heart bleeds for Bob.”  “Jackson’s all right. What’s wrong with him? Besides, naturally, young Jackson came to Wrykyn when all his brothers had been here.”  “What a rotten argument. It’s just the one used by chaps’ people, too. They think how nice it will be for all the sons to have been at the same school. It may be all right after they’re left, but while they’re there, it’s the limit. You say Jackson’s all right. At present, perhaps, he is. But the term’s hardly started yet.”  “Well?”  “Look here, what’s at the bottom of this sending young brothers to the same school as elder brothers?”  “Elder brother can keep an eye on him, I suppose.”  “That’s just it. For once in your life you’ve touched the spot. In other words, Bob Jackson is practically responsible for the kid. That’s where the whole rotten trouble starts.”  “Why?”  “Well, what happens? He either lets the kid rip, in which case he may find himself any morning in the pleasant position of having to explain to his people exactly why it is that little Willie has just received the boot, and why he didn’t look after him better: or he spends all his spare time shadowing him to see that he doesn’t get into trouble. He feels that his reputation hangs on the kid’s conduct, so he broods over him like a policeman, which is pretty rotten for him and maddens the kid, who looks on him as no sportsman. Bob seems to be trying the first way, which is what I should do myself. It’s all right, so far, but, as I said, the term’s only just started.”  “Young Jackson seems all right. What’s wrong with him? He doesn’t stick on side any way,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7423"],["title","Mike (#7)"],["body","he might easily do, considering his cricket.”  “There’s nothing wrong with him in that way. I’ve talked to him several times at the nets, and he’s very decent. But his getting into trouble hasn’t anything to do with us. It’s the masters you’ve got to consider.”  “What’s up? Does he rag?”  “From what I gather from fellows in his form he’s got a genius for ragging. Thinks of things that don’t occur to anybody else, and does them, too.”  “He never seems to be in extra. One always sees him about on half-holidays.”  “That’s always the way with that sort of chap. He keeps on wriggling out of small rows till he thinks he can do anything he likes without being dropped on, and then all of a sudden he finds himself up to the eyebrows in a record smash. I don’t say young Jackson will land himself like that. All I say is that he’s just the sort who does. He’s asking for trouble. Besides, who do you see him about with all the time?”  “He’s generally with Wyatt when I meet him.”  “Yes. Well, then!”  “What’s wrong with Wyatt? He’s one of the decentest men in the school.”  “I know. But he’s working up for a tremendous row one of these days, unless he leaves before it comes off. The odds are, if Jackson’s so thick with him, that he’ll be roped into it too. Wyatt wouldn’t land him if he could help it, but he probably wouldn’t realise what he was letting the kid in for. For instance, I happen to know that Wyatt breaks out of his dorm. every other night. I don’t know if he takes Jackson with him. I shouldn’t think so. But there’s nothing to prevent Jackson following him on his own. And if you’re caught at that game, it’s the boot every time.”  Trevor looked disturbed.  “Somebody ought to speak to Bob.”  “What’s the good? Why worry him? Bob couldn’t do anything. You’d only make him do the policeman business, which he hasn’t time for, and which is bound to make rows between them. Better leave him alone.”  “I don’t know. It would be a beastly thing for Bob if the kid did get into a really bad row.”  “If you must tell anybody, tell the Gazeka. He’s head of Wain’s, and has got far more chance of keeping an eye on Jackson than Bob has.”  “The Gazeka is a fool.”  “All front teeth and side. Still, he’s on the spot. But what’s the good of worrying. It’s nothing to do with us, anyhow. Let’s stagger out, shall we?”         *       *       *       *       *  Trevor’s conscientious nature, however, made it impossible for him to drop the matter. It disturbed him all the time that he and Clowes were on the river; and, walking back to the house, he resolved to see Bob about it during preparation.  He found him in his study, oiling a bat.  “I say, Bob,” he said, “look here. Are you busy?”  “No. Why?”  “It’s this way. Clowes and I were talking----”  “If Clowes was there he was probably talking. Well?”  “About your brother.”  “Oh, by Jove,” said Bob, sitting up. “That reminds me. I forgot to get the evening paper. Did he get his century all right?”  “Who?” asked Trevor, bewildered.  “My brother, J. W. He’d made sixty-three not out against Kent in this morning’s paper. What happened?”  “I didn’t get a paper either. I didn’t mean that brother. I meant the one here.”  “Oh, Mike? What’s Mike been up to?”  “Nothing as yet, that I know of; but, I say, you know, he seems a great pal of Wyatt’s.”  “I know. I spoke to him about it.”  “Oh, you did? That’s all right, then.”  “Not that there’s anything wrong with Wyatt.”  “Not a bit. Only he is rather mucking about this term, I hear. It’s his last, so I suppose he wants to have a rag.”  “Don’t blame him.”  “Nor do I. Rather rot, though, if he lugged your brother into a row by accident.”  “I should get blamed. I think I’ll speak to him again.”  “I should, I think.”  “I hope he isn’t idiot enough to go out at night with Wyatt. If Wyatt likes to risk it, all right. That’s his look out. But it won’t do for Mike to go playing the goat too.”  “Clowes suggested putting Firby-Smith on to him. He’d have more chance, being in the same house, of seeing that he didn’t come a mucker than you would.”  “I’ve done that. Smith said he’d speak to him.”  “That’s all right then. Is that a new bat?”  “Got it to-day. Smashed my other yesterday--against the school house.”  Donaldson’s had played a friendly with the school house during the last two days, and had beaten them.  “I thought I heard it go. You were rather in form.”  “Better than at the beginning of the term, anyhow. I simply couldn’t do a thing then. But my last three innings have been 33 not out, 18, and 51.  “I should think you’re bound to get your first all right.”  “Hope so. I see Mike’s playing for the second against the O.W.s.”  “Yes. Pretty good for his first term. You have a pro. to coach you in the holidays, don’t you?”  “Yes. I didn’t go to him much this last time. I was away a lot. But Mike fairly lived inside the net.”  “Well, it’s not been chucked away. I suppose he’ll get his first next year. There’ll be a big clearing-out of colours at the end of this term. Nearly all the first are leaving. Henfrey’ll be captain, I expect.”  “Saunders, the pro. at home, always says that Mike’s going to be the star cricketer of the family. Better than J. W. even, he thinks. I asked him what he thought of me, and he said, ‘You’ll be making a lot of runs some day, Mr. Bob.’ There’s a subtle difference, isn’t there? I shall have Mike cutting me out before I leave school if I’m not careful.”  “Sort of infant prodigy,” said Trevor. “Don’t think he’s quite up to it yet, though.”  He went back to his study, and Bob, having finished his oiling and washed his hands, started on his Thucydides. And, in the stress of wrestling with the speech of an apparently delirious Athenian general, whose remarks seemed to contain nothing even remotely resembling sense and coherence, he allowed the question of Mike’s welfare to fade from his mind like a dissolving view.     CHAPTER VIII  A ROW WITH THE TOWN   The beginning of a big row, one of those rows which turn a school upside down like a volcanic eruption and provide old boys with something to talk about, when they meet, for years, is not unlike the beginning of a thunderstorm.  You are walking along one seemingly fine day, when suddenly there is a hush, and there falls on you from space one big drop. The next moment the thing has begun, and you are standing in a shower-bath. It is just the same with a row. Some trivial episode occurs, and in an instant the place is in a ferment. It was so with the great picnic at Wrykyn.  The bare outlines of the beginning of this affair are included in a letter which Mike wrote to his father on the Sunday following the Old Wrykynian matches.  This was the letter:     “DEAR FATHER,--Thanks awfully for your letter. I hope you are quite    well. I have been getting on all right at cricket lately. My scores    since I wrote last have been 0 in a scratch game (the sun got in my    eyes just as I played, and I got bowled); 15 for the third against an    eleven of masters (without G. B. Jones, the Surrey man, and Spence);    28 not out in the Under Sixteen game; and 30 in a form match. Rather    decent. Yesterday one of the men put down for the second against the    O.W.’s second couldn’t play because his father was very ill, so I    played. Wasn’t it luck? It’s the first time I’ve played for the    second. I didn’t do much, because I didn’t get an innings. They stop    the cricket on O.W. matches day because they have a lot of rotten    Greek plays and things which take up a frightful time, and half the    chaps are acting, so we stop from lunch to four. Rot I call it. So I    didn’t go in, because they won the toss and made 215, and by the time    we’d made 140 for 6 it was close of play. They’d stuck me in eighth    wicket. Rather rot. Still, I may get another shot. And I made rather a    decent catch at mid-on. Low down. I had to dive for it. Bob played for    the first, but didn’t do much. He was run out after he’d got ten. I    believe he’s rather sick about it.     “Rather a rummy thing happened after lock-up. I wasn’t in it, but a    fellow called Wyatt (awfully decent chap. He’s Wain’s step-son, only    they bar one another) told me about it. He was in it all right.    There’s a dinner after the matches on O.W. day, and some of the chaps    were going back to their houses after it when they got into a row with    a lot of brickies from the town, and there was rather a row. There was    a policeman mixed up in it somehow, only I don’t quite know where he    comes in. I’ll find out and tell you next time I write. Love to    everybody. Tell Marjory I’ll write to her in a day or two.     “Your loving son,                “MIKE.     “P.S.--I say, I suppose you couldn’t send me five bob, could you? I’m    rather broke.     “P.P.S.--Half-a-crown would do, only I’d rather it was five bob.”  And, on the back of the envelope, these words: “Or a bob would be better than nothing.”         *       *       *       *       *  The outline of the case was as Mike had stated. But there were certain details of some importance which had not come to his notice when he sent the letter. On the Monday they were public property.  The thing had happened after this fashion. At the conclusion of the day’s cricket, all those who had been playing in the four elevens which the school put into the field against the old boys, together with the school choir, were entertained by the headmaster to supper in the Great Hall. The banquet, lengthened by speeches, songs, and recitations which the reciters imagined to be songs, lasted, as a rule, till about ten o’clock, when the revellers were supposed to go back to their houses by the nearest route, and turn in. This was the official programme. The school usually performed it with certain modifications and improvements.  About midway between Wrykyn, the school, and Wrykyn, the town, there stands on an island in the centre of the road a solitary lamp-post. It was the custom, and had been the"]]]
