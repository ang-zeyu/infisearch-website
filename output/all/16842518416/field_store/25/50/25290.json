He who ignites the stars and the cells of flesh with mysterious life-effulgence can surely bring luster of vision into your eyes.'  \"The master touched Ramu's forehead at the point between the eyebrows. {FN4-7} \"'Keep your mind concentrated there, and frequently chant the name of the prophet Rama {FN4-8} for seven days. The splendor of the sun shall have a special dawn for you.'  \"Lo! in one week it was so. For the first time, Ramu beheld the fair face of nature. The Omniscient One had unerringly directed his disciple to repeat the name of Rama, adored by him above all other saints. Ramu's faith was the devotionally ploughed soil in which the guru's powerful seed of permanent healing sprouted.\" Kebalananda was silent for a moment, then paid a further tribute to his guru.  \"It was evident in all miracles performed by Lahiri Mahasaya that he never allowed the ego-principle {FN4-9} to consider itself a causative force. By perfection of resistless surrender, the master enabled the Prime Healing Power to flow freely through him.  \"The numerous bodies which were spectacularly healed through Lahiri Mahasaya eventually had to feed the flames of cremation. But the silent spiritual awakenings he effected, the Christlike disciples he fashioned, are his imperishable miracles.\"  I never became a Sanskrit scholar; Kebalananda taught me a diviner syntax.  {FN4-1} Literally, \"renunciate.\" From Sanskrit verb roots, \"to cast aside.\"  {FN4-2} Effects of past actions, in this or a former life; from Sanskrit KRI, \"to do.\"  {FN4-3} BHAGAVAD GITA, IX, 30-31. Krishna was the greatest prophet of India; Arjuna was his foremost disciple.  {FN4-4} I always addressed him as Ananta-da. DA is a respectful suffix which the eldest brother in an Indian family receives from junior brothers and sisters.  {FN4-5} At the time of our meeting, Kebalananda had not yet joined the Swami Order and was generally called \"Shastri Mahasaya.\" To avoid confusion with the name of Lahiri Mahasaya and of Master Mahasaya (../chapter 9), I am referring to my Sanskrit tutor only by his later monastic name of Swami Kebalananda. His biography has been recently published in Bengali. Born in the Khulna district of Bengal in 1863, Kebalananda gave up his body in Benares at the age of sixty-eight. His family name was Ashutosh Chatterji.  {FN4-6} The ancient four VEDAS comprise over 100 extant canonical books. Emerson paid the following tribute in his JOURNAL to Vedic thought: \"It is sublime as heat and night and a breathless ocean. It contains every religious sentiment, all the grand ethics which visit in turn each noble poetic mind. . . . It is of no use to put away the book; if I trust myself in the woods or in a boat upon the pond, Nature makes a BRAHMIN of me presently: eternal necessity, eternal compensation, unfathomable power, unbroken silence. . . . This is her creed. Peace, she saith to me, and purity and absolute abandonment--these panaceas expiate all sin and bring you to the beatitude of the Eight Gods.\"  {FN4-7} The seat of the \"single\" or spiritual eye. At death the consciousness of man is usually drawn to this holy spot, accounting for the upraised eyes found in the dead.  {FN4-8} The central sacred figure of the Sanskrit epic, RAMAYANA.  {FN4-9} Ahankara, egoism; literally, \"I do.\" The root cause of dualism or illusion of MAYA, whereby the subject (ego) appears as object; the creatures imagine themselves to be creators.    CHAPTER: 5  A \"PERFUME SAINT\" DISPLAYS HIS WONDERS  \"To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven.\"  I did not have this wisdom of Solomon to comfort me; I gazed searchingly about me, on any excursion from home, for the face of my destined guru. But my path did not cross his own until after the completion of my high school studies.  Two years elapsed between my flight with Amar toward the Himalayas, and the great day of Sri Yukteswar's arrival into my life. During that interim I met a number of sages-the \"Perfume Saint,\" the \"Tiger Swami,\" Nagendra Nath Bhaduri, Master Mahasaya, and the famous Bengali scientist, Jagadis Chandra Bose.  My encounter with the \"Perfume Saint\" had two preambles, one harmonious and the other humorous.  \"God is simple. Everything else is complex. Do not seek absolute values in the relative world of nature.\"  These philosophical finalities gently entered my ear as I stood silently before a temple image of Kali. Turning, I confronted a tall man whose garb, or lack of it, revealed him a wandering SADHU.  \"You have indeed penetrated the bewilderment of my thoughts!\" I smiled gratefully. \"The confusion of benign and terrible aspects in nature, as symbolized by Kali, {FN5-1} has puzzled wiser heads than mine!\"  \"Few there be who solve her mystery! Good and evil is the challenging riddle which life places sphinxlike before every intelligence. Attempting no solution, most men pay forfeit with their lives, penalty now even as in the days of Thebes. Here and there, a towering lonely figure never cries defeat. From the MAYA {FN5-2} of duality he plucks the cleaveless truth of unity.\"  \"You speak with conviction, sir.\"  \"I have long exercised an honest introspection, the exquisitely painful approach to wisdom. Self-scrutiny, relentless observance of one's thoughts, is a stark and shattering experience. It pulverizes the stoutest ego. But true self-analysis mathematically operates to produce seers. The way of 'self-expression,' individual acknowledgments, results in egotists, sure of the right to their private interpretations of God and the universe.\"  \"Truth humbly retires, no doubt, before such arrogant originality.\" I was enjoying the discussion.  \"Man can understand no eternal verity until he has freed himself from pretensions. The human mind, bared to a centuried slime, is teeming with repulsive life of countless world-delusions. Struggles of the battlefields pale into insignificance here, when man first contends with inward enemies! No mortal foes these, to be overcome by harrowing array of might! Omnipresent, unresting, pursuing man even in sleep, subtly equipped with a miasmic weapon, these soldiers of ignorant lusts seek to slay us all. Thoughtless is the man who buries his ideals, surrendering to the common fate. Can he seem other than impotent, wooden, ignominious?\"  \"Respected Sir, have you no sympathy for the bewildered masses?\"  The sage was silent for a moment, then answered obliquely.  \"To love both the invisible God, Repository of All Virtues, and visible man, apparently possessed of none, is often baffling! But ingenuity is equal to the maze. Inner research soon exposes a unity in all human minds-the stalwart kinship of selfish motive. In one sense at least, the brotherhood of man stands revealed. An aghast humility follows this leveling discovery. It ripens into compassion for one's fellows, blind to the healing potencies of the soul awaiting exploration.\"  \"The saints of every age, sir, have felt like yourself for the sorrows of the world.\"  \"Only the shallow man loses responsiveness to the woes of others' lives, as he sinks into narrow suffering of his own.\" The SADHU'S austere face was noticeably softened. \"The one who practices a scalpel self-dissection will know an expansion of universal pity. Release is given him from the deafening demands of his ego. The love of God flowers on such soil. The creature finally turns to his Creator, if for no other reason than to ask in anguish: 'Why, Lord, why?' By ignoble whips of pain, man is driven at last into the Infinite Presence, whose beauty alone should lure him.\"  The sage and I were present in Calcutta's Kalighat Temple, whither I had gone to view its famed magnificence. With a sweeping gesture, my chance companion dismissed the ornate dignity.  \"Bricks and mortar sing us no audible tune; the heart opens only to the human chant of being.\"  We strolled to the inviting sunshine at the entrance, where throngs of devotees were passing to and fro.  \"You are young.\" The sage surveyed me thoughtfully. \"India too is young. The ancient RISHIS {FN5-3} laid down ineradicable patterns of spiritual living. Their hoary dictums suffice for this day and land.  Not outmoded, not unsophisticated against the guiles of materialism, the disciplinary precepts mold India still. By millenniums-more than embarrassed scholars care to compute!-the skeptic Time has validated Vedic worth. Take it for your heritage.\"  As I was reverently bidding farewell to the eloquent SADHU, he revealed a clairvoyant perception:  \"After you leave here today, an unusual experience will come your way.\"  I quitted the temple precincts and wandered along aimlessly. Turning a corner, I ran into an old acquaintance-one of those long-winded fellows whose conversational powers ignore time and embrace eternity.  \"I will let you go in a very short while, if you will tell me all that has happened during the six years of our separation.\"  \"What a paradox! I must leave you now.\"  But he held me by the hand, forcing out tidbits of information. He was like a ravenous wolf, I thought in amusement; the longer I spoke, the more hungrily he sniffed for news. Inwardly I petitioned the Goddess Kali to devise a graceful means of escape.  My companion left me abruptly. I sighed with relief and doubled my pace, dreading any relapse into the garrulous fever. Hearing rapid footsteps behind me, I quickened my speed. I dared not look back. But with a bound, the youth rejoined me, jovially clasping my shoulder.  \"I forgot to tell you of Gandha Baba (Perfume Saint), who is gracing yonder house.\" He pointed to a dwelling a few yards distant. \"Do meet him; he is interesting. You may have an unusual experience. Good-by,\" and he actually left me.

JAS. JENNINGS.     PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.   In preparing this second edition of my relative's work, I have incorporated the results of observations made by me during several years' residence in Somersetshire, in the centre of the district. I have also availed myself by kind permission, of hints and suggestions in two papers, entitled \"Somersetshire Dialect,\" read by T. S. Baynes in 1856, and reprinted from the Taunton Courier, in London, in 1861.  During the forty years which have elapsed since the first edition, very much light has been thrown on the subject of Provincial Dialects, and after all much remains to be discovered. I consider with Mr. Baynes that there is more of the pure Anglo-Saxon in the west of England dialect, as this district was the seat of classical Anglo-Saxon, which first rose here to a national tongue, and lasted longer in a great measure owing to its distance from the Metropolis, from which cause also it was less subject to modern modification.  I shall be happy to receive any suggestions from Philological scholars, which may increase the light thrown on the subject, and by which a third edition may be improved.  _Hagbourn Vicarage, August,_ 1869.     PREFACE.   The usefulness of works like the present is too generally admitted to need any apology for their publication. There is, notwithstanding, in their very nature a dryness, which requires relief: the author trusts, therefore, that, in blending something imaginative with the details of philological precision, his work will afford amusement to the reader.  The Glossary contains the fruit of years of unwearied attention to the subject; and it is hoped that the book will be of some use in elucidating our old writers, in affording occasional help to the etymology of the Anglo-Saxon portion of our language, and in exhibiting a view of the present state of an important dialect of the western provinces of England.  A late excursion through the West has, however, induced the Author to believe that some valuable information may yet remain to be gathered from our Anglo-Saxon dialect--more especially from that part of it still used by the common people and the yeomanry. He therefore respectfully solicits communications from those who feel an interest in this department of our literature; by which a second edition may be materially improved.  To a _native_ of the west of England this volume will be found a vade-mecum of reference, and assist the reminiscence of well-known, and too often unnoted peculiarities and words, which are fast receding from, the polish of elegance, and the refinement of literature.  In regard to the _Poetical Pieces_, it may be mentioned that most of them are founded on _West Country Stories_, the incidents in which actually occurred. If some of the subjects should be thought trifling, it must not be forgotten that the primary object has been, to exemplify the Dialect, and that common subjects offered the best means of effectuating such an object. Of such Poems as _Good Bwye ta thee Cot_; _the Rookery_; and _Mary Ramsey's Crutch_, it may be observed, that had the Author _felt_ less he might, perhaps, have written better.  _Metropolitan Literary Institution, London, March 25, 1825._     CONTENTS   - Dedication  - Preface to the Second Edition  - Preface to the First Edition  - OBSERVATIONS on some of the Dialects of the West of England, particularly Somersetshire  - A GLOSSARY of Words commonly used in Somersetshire  - POEMS and OTHER PIECES, exemplifying the Dialect of the County of Somerset  - Good Bwye ta Thee Cot  - Fanny Fear  - Jerry Nutty  - Legend of Glastonbury  - Mr. Guy  - The Rookery  - Tom Gool  - Teddy Band--a Zong--Hunting for Sport  - The Churchwarden  - The Fisherman and the Players  - Mary Ramsey's Crutch  - Hannah Verrior  - Remembrance  - Doctor Cox  - The Farewell  - Farmer Bennet an Jan Lide, a Dialogue  - Thomas Came an Young Maester Jimmy, a Dialogue  - Mary Ramsay, a Monologue  - Soliloquy of Ben Bond  - Two Dissertations on Anglo-Saxon Pronouns  - Miss Ham on the Somerset Dialect  - Concluding Observations     OBSERVATIONS, &c.   The following Glossary includes the whole of Somerset, _East_ of the River Parret, as well as adjoining parts of Wiltshire and Gloucestershire. West of the Parret many of the words are pronounced very differently indeed, so as to mark strongly the people who use them. [This may be seen more fully developed in two papers, by T. Spencer Baynes, read before the Somersetshire Archaeological Society, entitled the Somersetshire Dialect, printed 1861, 18mo, to whom I here acknowledge my obligations for several hints and suggestions, of which I avail myself in this edition of my late relative's work].  The chief peculiarity West of the Parret, is the ending of the third person singular, present tense of verbs, in _th_ or _eth_: as, he _lov'th_, _zee'th_, &c., for he loves, sees, &c.  In the pronouns, they have _Ise_ for _I_, and _er_ for _he_. In fact the peculiarities and contractions of the Western District are puzzling to a stranger. Thus, _her_ is frequently used for _she_. \"_Har'th a doo'd it_,\" is, \"_she has done it_,\" (I shall occasionally in the Glossary note such words as distinguishingly characterise that district).  Two of the most remarkable peculiarities of the dialect of the West of England, and particularly of Somersetshire, are the sounds given to the vowels A and E. A, is almost always sounded open, as in _fäther_, _räther_, or somewhat like the usual sound of _a_ in _balloon_, _calico_, lengthened; it is so pronounced in bäll, cäll. I shall use for this sound the _circumflex over the a_, thus â_ or ä_. E, has commonly the same sound as the French gave it, which is, in fact, the slender of A, as heard in _pane fane_, _cane_, &c. The hard sound given in our polished dialect to the letters _th_, in the majority of words containing those letters [as in _through_, _three_, _thing_, think_], expressed by the Anglo-Saxon _đ_, is frequently changed in the Western districts into the sound given in England to the letter _d_:    as for _three_, we have _dree_    for _thread_, _dread_, or _dird_,    _through_, _droo_, _throng_, _drong_, or rather _drang_;  _thrush_, _dirsh_, &c. The consonant and vowel following _d_, changing places. The slender or soft sound given to _th_ in our polished dialect, is in the West, most commonly converted into the thick or obtuse sound of the same letters as heard in the words _this_, these &c., and this too, whether the letters be at the beginning or end of words. I am much disposed to believe that our Anglo-Saxon ancestors, used indiscriminately the letters Đ and đ for D only, and sounded them as such, as we find now frequently in the West; although our lexicographers usually have given the _two_ sounds of _th_ to Đ and đ respectively. The vowel O is used for _a_, as _hond, dorke, lorke, hort,_ in hand, dark, lark, heart, &c., and other syllables are lengthened, as _voote, bade, dade,_ for foot, bed, dead. The letter O in _no, gold,_ &c., is sounded like _aw_ in _awful_; I have therefore spelt it with this diphthong instead of _a_. Such word as _jay_ for _joy_, and a few others, I have not noted. Another remarkable fact is the disposition to invert the order of some consonants in some words; as the _r_ in _thrush, brush, rush, run,_ &c., pronouncing them dirsh, birsh, hirsh, hirn; also transposition of _p_ and _s_ in such words as clasp, hasp, asp, &c., sounded claps, haps, aps, &c. I have not inserted all these words in the Glossary, as these general remarks will enable the student to detect the words which are so inverted. It is by no means improbable that the order in which such sounds are now repeated in the West, is the original order in which they existed in our language, and that our more polished mode of expressing them is a new and perhaps a corrupt enunciation. Another peculiarity is that of joining the letter _y_ at the end of some verbs in the infinitive mood, as well as to parts of different conjugations, thus, \"I can't _sewy, nursy, reapy_, to _sawy_, to _sewy_, to _nursy_, &c. A further peculiarity is the _love of vowel_ sound, and opening out monosyllables of our polished dialect into two or more syllables, thus:    ay-er, for air;   boo-äth, for "]]]
