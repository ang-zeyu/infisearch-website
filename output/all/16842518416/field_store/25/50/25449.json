Already Harold was conscious that the politic motives for his mission had failed him; already he perceived, though he scarce knew why, that William the Norman was the last man to whom he could confide his ambition, or trust for aid.  One day, as, during a short truce with the defenders of the place they were besieging, the Normans were diverting their leisure with martial games, in which Taillefer shone pre-eminent: while Harold and William stood without their tent, watching the animated field, the Duke abruptly exclaimed to Mallet de Graville, \"Bring me my bow.  Now, Harold, let me see if thou canst bend it.\"  The bow was brought, and Saxon and Norman gathered round the spot.  \"Fasten thy glove to yonder tree, Mallet,\" said the Duke, taking that mighty bow in his hand, and bending its stubborn yew into the noose of the string with practised ease.  Then he drew the arc to his ear; and the tree itself seemed to shake at the shock, as the shaft, piercing the glove, lodged half-way in the trunk.  \"Such are not our weapons,\" said the Earl; \"and ill would it become me, unpractised, so to peril our English honour, as to strive against the arm that could bend that arc and wing that arrow.  But, that I may show these Norman knights, that at least we have some weapon wherewith we can parry shaft and smite assailer,--bring me forth, Godrith, my shield and my Danish axe.\"  Taking the shield and axe which the Saxon brought to him, Harold then stationed himself before the tree.  \"Now, fair Duke,\" said he, smiling, \"choose thou thy longest shaft--bid thy ten doughtiest archers take their bows; round this tree will I move, and let each shaft be aimed at whatever space in my mailless body I leave unguarded by my shield.\"  \"No!\" said William, hastily; \"that were murder.\"  \"It is but the common peril of war,\" said Harold, simply; and he walked to the tree.  The blood mounted to William's brow, and the lion's thirst of carnage parched his throat.  \"An he will have it so,\" said he, beckoning to his archers; \"let not Normandy be shamed.  Watch well, and let every shaft go home; avoid only the head and the heart; such orgulous vaunting is best cured by blood-letting.\"  The archers nodded, and took their post, each at a separate quarter; and deadly indeed seemed the danger of the Earl, for as he moved, though he kept his back guarded by the tree, some parts of his form the shield left exposed, and it would have been impossible, in his quick-shifting movements, for the archers so to aim as to wound, but to spare life; yet the Earl seemed to take no peculiar care to avoid the peril; lifting his bare head fearlessly above the shield, and including in one gaze of his steadfast eye, calmly bright even at the distance, all the shafts of the archers.  At one moment five of the arrows hissed through the air, and with such wonderful quickness had the shield turned to each, that three fell to the ground blunted against it, and two broke on its surface.  But William, waiting for the first discharge, and seeing full mark at Harold's shoulder as the buckler turned, now sent forth his terrible shaft.  The noble Taillefer with a poet's true sympathy cried, \"Saxon, beware!\" but the watchful Saxon needed not the warning.  As if in disdain, Harold met not the shaft with his shield, but swinging high the mighty axe, (which with most men required both arms to wield it,) he advanced a step, and clove the rushing arrow in twain.  Before William's loud oath of wrath and surprise left his lips, the five shafts of the remaining archers fell as vainly as their predecessors against the nimble shield.  Then advancing, Harold said, cheerfully: \"This is but defence, fair Duke--and little worth were the axe if it could not smite as well as ward.  Wherefore, I pray you, place upon yonder broken stone pillar, which seems some relic of Druid heathenesse, such helm and shirt of mail as thou deemest most proof against sword and pertuizan, and judge then if our English axe can guard well our English land.\"  \"If thy axe can cleave the helmet I wore at Bavent, when the Franks and their King fled before me,\" said the Duke, grimly, \"I shall hold Caesar in fault, not to have invented a weapon so dread.\"  And striding back into his pavilion, he came forth with the helm and shirt of mail, which was worn stronger and heavier by the Normans, as fighting usually on horseback, than by Dane and Saxon, who, mainly fighting on foot, could not have endured so cumbrous a burthen: and if strong and dour generally with the Norman, judge what solid weight that mighty Duke could endure!  With his own hand William placed the mail on the ruined Druid stone, and on the mail the helm.  Harold looked long and gravely at the edge of the axe; it was so richly gilt and damasquined, that the sharpness of its temper could not well have been divined under that holiday glitter.  But this axe had come to him from Canute the Great, who himself, unlike the Danes, small and slight [195], had supplied his deficiency of muscle by the finest dexterity and the most perfect weapons.  Famous had been that axe in the delicate hand of Canute--how much more tremendous in the ample grasp of Harold!  Swinging now in both hands this weapon, with a peculiar and rapid whirl, which gave it an inconceivable impetus, the Earl let fall the crushing blow: at the first stroke, cut right in the centre, rolled the helm; at the second, through all the woven mail (cleft asunder, as if the slightest filigree work of the goldsmith,) shore the blade, and a great fragment of the stone itself came tumbling on the sod.  The Normans stood aghast, and William's face was as pale as the shattered stone.  The great Duke felt even his matchless dissimulation fail him; nor, unused to the special practice and craft which the axe required, could he have pretended, despite a physical strength superior even to Harold's, to rival blows that seemed to him more than mortal.  \"Lives there any other man in the wide world whose arm could have wrought that feat?\" exclaimed Bruse, the ancestor of the famous Scot.  \"Nay,\" said Harold, simply, \"at least thirty thousand such men have I left at home!  But this was but the stroke of an idle vanity, and strength becomes tenfold in a good cause.\"  The Duke heard, and fearful lest he should betray his sense of the latent meaning couched under his guest's words, he hastily muttered forth reluctant compliment and praise; while Fitzosborne, De Bohun, and other chiefs more genuinely knightly, gave way to unrestrained admiration.  Then beckoning De Graville to follow him, the Duke strode off towards the tent of his brother of Bayeux, who, though, except on extraordinary occasions, he did not join in positive conflict, usually accompanied William in his military excursions, both to bless the host, and to advise (for his martial science was considerable) the council of war.  The bishop, who, despite the sanctimony of the Court, and his own stern nature, was (though secretly and decorously) a gallant of great success in other fields than those of Mars [196], sate alone in his pavilion, inditing an epistle to a certain fair dame in Rouen, whom he had unwillingly left to follow his brother.  At the entrance of William, whose morals in such matters were pure and rigid, he swept the letter into the chest of relics which always accompanied him, and rose, saying, indifferently:  \"A treatise on the authenticity of St. Thomas's little finger!  But what ails you? you are disturbed!\"  \"Odo, Odo, this man baffles me--this man fools me; I make no ground with him.  I have spent--heaven knows what I have spent,\" said the Duke, sighing with penitent parsimony, \"in banquets, and ceremonies, and processions; to say nothing of my bel maneir of Yonne, and the sum wrung from my coffers by that greedy Ponthevin.  All gone--all wasted --all melted like snow! and the Saxon is as Saxon as if he had seen neither Norman splendour, nor been released from the danger by Norman treasure.  But, by the splendour Divine, I were fool indeed if I suffered him to return home.  Would thou hadst seen the sorcerer cleave my helmet and mail just now, as easily as if they had been willow twigs.  Oh, Odo, Odo, my soul is troubled, and St. Michael forsakes me!\"  While William ran on thus distractedly, the prelate lifted his eyes inquiringly to De Graville, who now stood within the tent, and the knight briefly related the recent trial of strength.  \"I see nought in this to chafe thee,\" said Odo; \"the man once thine, the stronger the vassal, the more powerful the lord.\"  \"But he is not mine; I have sounded him as far as I dare go.  Matilda hath almost openly offered him my fairest child as his wife.  Nothing dazzles, nothing moves him.  Thinkest thou I care for his strong arm? Tut, no: I chafe at the proud heart that set the arm in motion; the proud meaning his words symbolled out, 'So will English strength guard English land from the Norman--so axe and shield will defy your mail and your shafts.'  But let him beware!\" growled the Duke, fiercely, \"or----\"  \"May I speak,\" interrupted De Graville, \"and suggest a counsel?\"  \"Speak out, in God's name!\" cried the Duke.  \"Then I should say, with submission, that the way to tame a lion is not by gorging him, but daunting.  Bold is the lion against open foes; but a lion in the toils loses his nature.  Just now, my lord said that Harold should not return to his native land----\"  \"Nor shall he, but as my sworn man!\" exclaimed the Duke.  \"And if you now put to him that choice, think you it will favour your views?  Will he not reject your proffers, and with hot scorn?\"  \"Scorn! darest thou that word to me?\" cried the Duke.  \"Scorn! have I no headsman"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7680"],["title","Harold : the Last of the Saxon Kings — Volume 09 (#4)"],["body","axe is as sharp as Harold's? and the neck of a captive is not sheathed in my Norman mail.\"  \"Pardon, pardon, my liege,\" said Mallet, with spirit; but to save my chief from a hasty action that might bring long remorse, I spoke thus boldly.  Give the Earl at least fair warning:--a prison, or fealty to thee, that is the choice before him!--let him know it; let him see that thy dungeons are dark, and thy walls impassable.  Threaten not his life--brave men care not for that!--threaten thyself nought, but let others work upon him with fear of his freedom.  I know well these Saxish men; I know well Harold; freedom is their passion, they are cowards when threatened with the doom of four walls.\" [197]  \"I conceive thee, wise son,\" exclaimed Odo.  \"Ha!\" said the Duke, slowly; \"and yet it was to prevent such suspicion that I took care, after the first meeting, to separate him from Haco and Wolnoth, for they must have learned much in Norman gossip, ill to repeat to the Saxon.\"  \"Wolnoth is almost wholly Norman,\" said the bishop, smiling; \"Wolnoth is bound par-amours, to a certain fair Norman dame; and, I trow well, prefers her charms here to the thought of his return.  But Haco, as thou knowest, is sullen and watchful.\"  \"So much the better companion for Harold now,\" said De Graville.  \"I am fated ever to plot and to scheme!\" said the Duke, groaning, as if he had been the simplest of men; \"but, nathless, I love the stout Earl, and I mean all for his own good,--that is, compatibly with my rights and claims to the heritage of Edward my cousin.\"  \"Of course,\" said the bishop.     CHAPTER IV.   The snares now spread for Harold were in pursuance of the policy thus resolved on.  The camp soon afterwards broke up, and the troops took their way to Bayeux.  William, without greatly altering his manner towards the Earl, evaded markedly (or as markedly replied not to) Harold's plain declarations, that his presence was required in England, and that he could no longer defer his departure; while, under pretence of being busied with affairs, he absented himself much from the Earl's company, or refrained from seeing him alone, and suffered Mallet de Graville, and Odo the bishop, to supply his place with Harold.  The Earl's suspicions now became thoroughly aroused, and these were fed both by the hints, kindly meant, of De Graville, and the less covert discourse of the prelate: while Mallet let drop, as in gossiping illustration of William's fierce and vindictive nature, many anecdotes of that cruelty which really stained the Norman's character, Odo, more bluntly, appeared to take it for granted that Harold's sojourn in the land would be long.  \"You will have time,\" said he, one day, as they rode together, \"to assist me, I trust, in learning the language of our forefathers. Danish is still spoken much at Bayeux, the sole place in Neustria [198] where the old tongue and customs still linger; and it would serve my pastoral ministry to receive your lessons; in a year or so I might hope so to profit by them as to discourse freely with the less Frankish part of my flock.\"  \"Surely, Lord Bishop, you jest,\" said Harold, seriously; \"you know well that within a week, at farthest, I must sail back for England with my young kinsmen.\"  The prelate laughed.  \"I advise you, dear count and son, to be cautious how you speak so plainly to William.  I perceive that you have already ruffled him by such indiscreet remarks; and you must have seen eno' of the Duke to know that, when his ire is up, his answers are short but his arms are long.\"  \"You most grievously wrong Duke William,\" cried Harold, indignantly, \"to suppose, merely in that playful humor, for which ye Normans are famous, that he could lay force on his confiding guest?\"  \"No, not a confiding guest,--a ransomed captive.  Surely my brother will deem that he has purchased of Count Guy his rights over his illustrious prisoner.  But courage!  The Norman Court is not the Ponthevin dungeon; and your chains, at least, are roses.\"  The reply of wrath and defiance that rose to Harold's lip, was checked by a sign from De Graville, who raised his finger to his lip with a face expressive of caution and alarm; and, some little time after, as they halted to water their horses, De Graville came up to him and said in a low voice, and in Saxon:  \"Beware how you speak too frankly to Odo.  What is said to him is said to William; and the Duke, at times, so acts on the spur of the moment that--But let me not wrong him, or needlessly alarm you.\"  \"Sire de Graville,\" said Harold, \"this is not the first time that the Prelate of Bayeux hath hinted at compulsion, nor that you (no doubt kindly) have warned me of purpose hostile or fraudful.  As plain man to plain man, I ask you, on your knightly honour, to tell me if you know aught to make you believe that William the Duke will, under any pretext, detain me here a captive?\"  Now, though Mallet de Graville had lent himself to the service of an ignoble craft, he justified it by a better reason than complaisance to his lords; for, knowing William well, his hasty ire, and his relentless ambition, he was really alarmed for Harold's safety.  And, as the reader may have noted, in suggesting that policy of intimidation, the knight had designed to give the Earl at least the benefit of forewarning.  So, thus adjured, De Graville replied sincerely:  \"Earl Harold, on my honour as your brother in knighthood I answer your plain question.  I have cause to believe and to know that William will not suffer you to depart, unless fully satisfied on certain points, which he himself will, doubtless, ere long make clear to you.\"  \"And if I insist on my departure, not so satisfying him?\"  \"Every castle on our road hath a dungeon as deep as Count Guy's; but where another William to deliver you from William?\"  \"Over yon seas, a prince mightier than William, and men as resolute, at least, as your Normans.\"  \"Cher et puissant, my Lord Earl,\" answered De Graville, \"these are brave words, but of no weight in the ear of a schemer so deep as the Duke.  Think you really, that King Edward--pardon my bluntness--would rouse himself from his apathy, to do more in your behalf than he has done in your kinsmen's--remonstrate and preach?--Are you even sure that on the representation of a man he hath so loved as William, he will not be content to rid his throne of so formidable a subject?  You speak of the English people; doubtless you are popular and beloved, but it is the habit of no people, least of all your own, to stir actively and in concert, without leaders.  The Duke knows the factions of England as well as you do.  Remember how closely he is connected with Tostig, your ambitious brother.  Have you no fear that Tostig himself, earl of the most warlike part of the kingdom, will not only do his best to check the popular feeling in your favour, but foment every intrigue to detain you here, and leave himself the first noble in the land?  As for other leaders, save Gurth (who is but your own vice earl), who is there that will not rejoice at the absence of Harold?  You have made foes of the only family that approaches the power of your own--the heirs of Leofric and Algar.--Your strong hand removed from the reins of the empire, tumults and dissensions ere long will break forth that will distract men's minds from an absent captive, and centre them on the safety of their own hearths, or the advancement of their own interests.  You see that I know something of the state of your native land; but deem not my own observation, though not idle, sufficed to bestow that knowledge.  I learn it more from William's discourses; William, who from Flanders, from Boulogne, from England itself, by a thousand channels, hears all that passes between the cliffs of Dover and the marches of Scotland.\"  Harold paused long before he replied, for his mind was now thoroughly awakened to his danger; and, while recognising the wisdom and intimate acquaintance of affairs with which De Graville spoke, he was also rapidly revolving the best course for himself to pursue in such extremes.  At length he said:  \"I pass by your remarks on the state of England, with but one comment. You underrate Gurth, my brother, when you speak of him but as the vice earl of Harold.  You underrate one, who needs but an object, to excel, in arms and in council, my father Godwin himself.--That object a brother's wrongs would create from a brother's love, and three hundred ships would sail up the Seine to demand your captive, manned by warriors as hardy as those who wrested Neustria from King Charles.\"  \"Granted,\" said De Graville.  \"But William, who could cut off the hands and feet of his own subjects for an idle jest on his birth, could as easily put out the eyes of a captive foe.  And of what worth are the ablest brain, and the stoutest arm, when the man is dependent on another for very sight!\"  Harold involuntarily shuddered, but recovering himself on the instant, he replied, with a smile:  \"Thou makest thy Duke a butcher more fell than his ancestor Rolfganger.  But thou saidst he needed but to be satisfied on certain points.  What are they?\"  \"Ah, that thou must divine, or he unfold.  But see, William himself approaches you.\"  And here the Duke, who had been till then in the rear, spurred up with courteous excuses to Harold for his long defection from his side; and, as they resumed their way, talked with all his former frankness and gaiety.  \"By the way, dear brother in arms,\" said he, \"I have provided thee this evening with comrades more welcome, I fear, than myself--Haco and Wolnoth.  That last is a youth whom I love dearly: the first is unsocial eno', and methinks would make a better hermit than soldier. But, by St. Valery, I forgot to tell thee that an envoy from Flanders to-day, amongst other news, brought me some, that may interest thee. There is a strong commotion in thy brother Tostig's Northumbrian earldom, and the rumour runs that his fierce vassals "]]]
