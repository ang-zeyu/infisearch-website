And by the blazing rafters, and the pale faces of the silent crowd, he rode on his way to battle and the throne!\"  Hilyard paused, and the anguish of his countenance was terrible to behold.  \"I returned to find a heap of ashes; I returned to find my wife a maniac; I returned to find my child--my boy--great God!--he had run to hide himself, in terror at the torches and the grim men; they had failed to discover him, till, too late, his shrieks, amidst the crashing walls, burst on his mother's ear,--and the scorched, mangled, lifeless corpse lay on that mother's bosom!\"  Adam rose; his figure was transformed.  Not the stooping student, but the knight-descended man, seemed to tower in the murky chamber; his hand felt at his side, as for a sword; he stifled a curse, and Hilyard, in that suppressed low voice which evinces a strong mind in deep emotion, continued his tale.  \"Blessed be the Divine Intercessor, the mother of the dead died too! Behold me, a lonely, ruined, wifeless, childless wretch!  I made all the world my foe!  The old love of liberty (alone left me) became a crime; I plunged into the gloom of the forest, a robber-chief, sparing--no, never-never--never one York captain, one spurred knight, one belted lord!  But the poor, my Saxon countrymen, they had suffered, and were safe!  \"One dark twilight--thou hast heard the tale, every village minstrel sets it to his viol--a majestic woman, a hunted fugitive, crossed my path; she led a boy in her hand, a year or so younger than my murdered child.  'Friend!' said the woman, fearlessly, 'save the son of your king; I am Margaret, Queen of England!' I saved them both.  From that hour the robber-chief, the Lollard's son, became a queen's friend. Here opened, at least, vengeance against the fell destroyer.  Now see you why I seek you, why tempt you into danger?  Pause, if you will, for my passion heats my blood,--and all the kings since Saul, it may be, are not worth one scholar's life!  And yet,\" continued Hilyard, regaining his ordinary calm tone, \"and yet, it seemeth to me, as I said at first, that all who labour have in this a common cause and interest with the poor.  This woman-king, though bloody man, with his wine-cups and his harlots, this usurping York--his very existence flaunts the life of the sons of toil.  In civil war and in broil, in strife that needs the arms of the people, the people shall get their own.\"  \"I will go,\" said Adam, and he advanced to the door.  Hilyard caught his arm.  \"Why, friend, thou hast not even the documents, and how wouldst thou get access to the prison?  Listen to me; or,\" added the conspirator, observing poor Adam's abstracted air, \"or let me rather speak a word to thy fair daughter; women have ready wit, and are the pioneers to the advance of men!  Adam, Adam! thou art dreaming!\"--He shook the philosopher's arm roughly.  \"I heed you,\" said Warner, meekly.  \"The first thing required,\" renewed Hilyard, \"is a permit to see King Henry.  This is obtained either from the Lord Worcester, governor of the Tower, a cruel man, who may deny it, or the Lord Hastings, Edward's chamberlain, a humane and gentle one, who will readily grant it.  Let not thy daughter know why thou wouldst visit Henry; let her suppose it is solely to make report of his health to Margaret; let her not know there is scheming or danger,--so, at least, her ignorance will secure her safety.  But let her go to the lord chamberlain, and obtain the order for a learned clerk to visit the learned prisoner-- to--ha! well thought of--this strange machine is, doubtless, the invention of which thy neighbours speak; this shall make thy excuse; thou wouldst divert the prisoner with thy mechanical--comprehendest thou, Adam?\"  \"Ah, King Henry will see the model, and when he is on the throne--\"  \"He will protect the scholar!\" interrupted Hilyard.  \"Good! good! Wait here; I will confer with thy daughter.\"  He gently pushed aside Adam, opened the door, and on descending the stairs, found Sibyll by the large casement where she had stood with Marmaduke, and heard the rude stave of the tymbesteres.  The anxiety the visit of Hilyard had occasioned her was at once allayed, when he informed her that he had been her father's schoolmate, and desired to become his friend.  And when he drew a moving picture of the exiled condition of Margaret and the young prince, and their natural desire to learn tidings of the health of the deposed king, her gentle heart, forgetting the haughty insolence with which her royal mistress had often wounded and chilled her childhood, felt all the generous and compassionate sympathy the conspirator desired to awaken.  \"The occasion,\" added Hilyard, \"for learning the poor captive's state now offers!  He hath heard of your father's labours; he desires to learn their nature from his own lips.  He is allowed to receive, by an order from King Edward's chamberlain, the visits of those scholars in whose converse he was ever wont to delight.  Wilt thou so far aid the charitable work as to seek the Lord Hastings, and crave the necessary license?  Thou seest that thy father has wayward and abstract moods; he might forget that Henry of Windsor is no longer king, and might give him that title in speaking to Lord Hastings,--a slip of the tongue which the law styles treason.\"  \"Certes,\" said Sibyll, quickly, \"if my father would seek the poor captive, I will be his messenger to my Lord Hastings.  But oh, sir, as thou hast known my father's boyhood, and as thou hopest for mercy in the last day, tempt to no danger one so guileless!\"  Hilyard winced as he interrupted her hastily,  \"There is no danger if thou wilt obtain the license.  I will say more,--a reward awaits him, that will not only banish his poverty but save his life.\"  \"His life!\"  \"Ay! seest thou not, fair mistress, that Adam Warner is dying, not of the body's hunger, but of the soul's?  He craveth gold, that his toils may reap their guerdon.  If that gold be denied, his toils will fret him to the grave!\"  \"Alas! alas! it is true.\"  \"That gold he shall honourably win!  Nor is this all.  Thou wilt see the Lord Hastings: he is less learned, perhaps, than Worcester, less dainty in accomplishments and gifts than Anthony Woodville, but his mind is profound and vast; all men praise him save the queen's kin. He loves scholars; he is mild to distress; he laughs at the superstitions of the vulgar.  Thou wilt see the Lord Hastings, and thou mayst interest him in thy father's genius and his fate!\"  \"There is frankness in thy voice, and I will trust thee,\" answered Sibyll.  \"When shall I seek this lord?\"  \"This day, if thou wilt.  He lodges at the Tower, and gives access, it is said, to all who need his offices, or seek succour from his power.\"  \"This day, then, be it!\" answered Sibyll, calmly.  Hilyard gazed at her countenance, rendered so noble in its youthful resignation, in its soft firmness of expression, and muttering, \"Heaven prosper thee, maiden; we shall meet tomorrow,\" descended the stairs, and quitted the house.  His heart smote him when he was in the street.  \"If evil should come to this meek scholar, to that poor child's father, it would be a sore sin to my soul.  But no; I will not think it.  The saints will not suffer this bloody Edward to triumph long; and in this vast chessboard of vengeance and great ends, we must move men to and fro, and harden our natures to the hazard of the game.\"  Sibyll sought her father; his mind had flown back to the model.  He was already living in the life that the promised gold would give to the dumb thought.  True that all the ingenious additions to the engine--additions that were to convince the reason and startle the fancy--were not yet complete (for want, of course, of the diamond bathed in moonbeams); but still there was enough in the inventions already achieved to excite curiosity and obtain encouragement.  So, with care and diligence and sanguine hope the philosopher prepared the grim model for exhibition to a man who had worn a crown, and might wear again.  But with that innocent and sad cunning which is so common with enthusiasts of one idea, the sublime dwellers of the narrow border between madness and inspiration, Adam, amidst his excitement, contrived to conceal from his daughter all glimpse of the danger he ran, of the correspondence of which he was to be the medium,--or rather, may we think that he had forgotten both!  Not the stout Warwick himself, in the roar of battle, thought so little of peril to life and limb as that gentle student, in the reveries of his lonely closet; and therefore, all unsuspicious, and seeing but diversion to Adam's recent gloom of despair, an opening to all his bright prospects, Sibyll attired herself in her holiday garments, drew her wimple closely round her face, and summoning Madge to attend her, bent her way to the Tower.  Near York House, within view of the Sanctuary and the Palace of Westminster, they took a boat, and arrived at the stairs of the Tower.     CHAPTER IV.  LORD HASTINGS.  William Lord Hastings was one of the most remarkable men of the age. Philip de Comines bears testimony to his high repute for wisdom and virtue.  Born the son of a knight of ancient lineage but scanty lands, he had risen, while yet in the prime of life, to a rank and an influence second, perhaps, only to the House of Nevile.  Like Lord Montagu, he united in happy combination the talents of a soldier and a courtier.  But as a statesman, a schemer, a thinker, Montagu, with all his craft, was inferior to Hastings.  In this, the latter had but two equals,--namely, George, the youngest of the Nevile brothers, Archbishop of York; and a boy, whose intellect was not yet fully developed, but in whom was already apparent to the observant the dawn of a restless, fearless, calculating, and subtle genius.  That"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7717"],["title","The Last of the Barons â€” Volume 03 (#4)"],["body","y, whom the philosophers of Utrecht had taught to reason, whom the lessons of Warwick had trained to arms, was Richard, Duke of Gloucester, famous even now for his skill in the tilt-yard and his ingenuity in the rhetoric of the schools.  The manners of Lord Hastings had contributed to his fortunes.  Despite the newness of his honours, even the haughtiest of the ancient nobles bore him no grudge, for his demeanour was at once modest and manly. He was peculiarly simple and unostentatious in his habits, and possessed that nameless charm which makes men popular with the lowly and welcome to the great.  [On Edward's accession so highly were the services of Hastings appreciated by the party, that not only the king, but many of the nobility, contributed to render his wealth equal to his new station, by grants of lands and moneys.  Several years afterwards, when he went with Edward into France, no less than two lords, nine knights, fifty-eight squires, and twenty gentlemen joined his train.--Dugdale: Baronage, p. 583.  Sharon Turner: History of England, vol. iii. p. 380.]  But in that day a certain mixture of vice was necessary to success; and Hastings wounded no self-love by the assumption of unfashionable purism.  He was regarded with small favour by the queen, who knew him as the companion of Edward in his pleasures, and at a later period accused him of enticing her faithless lord into unworthy affections.  And certain it is, that he was foremost amongst the courtiers in those adventures which we call the excesses of gayety and folly, though too often leading to Solomon's wisdom and his sadness.  But profligacy with Hastings had the excuse of ardent passions: he had loved deeply, and unhappily, in his earlier youth, and he gave in to the dissipation of the time with the restless eagerness common to strong and active natures when the heart is not at ease; and under all the light fascination of his converse; or the dissipation of his life, lurked the melancholic temperament of a man worthy of nobler things.  Nor was the courtly vice of the libertine the only drawback to the virtuous character assigned to Hastings by Comines.  His experience of men had taught him something of the disdain of the cynic, and he scrupled not at serving his pleasures or his ambition by means which his loftier nature could not excuse to his clear sense.  [See Comines, book vi., for a curious anecdote of what Mr. Sharon Turner happily calls \"the moral coquetry\" of Hastings,--an anecdote which reveals much of his character.]  Still, however, the world, which had deteriorated, could not harden him.  Few persons so able acted so frequently from impulse; the impulses were for the most part affectionate and generous, but then came the regrets of caution and experience; and Hastings summoned his intellect to correct the movement of his heart,--in other words, reflection sought to undo what impulse had suggested.  Though so successful a gallant, he had not acquired the ruthless egotism of the sensualist; and his conduct to women often evinced the weakness of giddy youth rather than the cold deliberation of profligate manhood.  Thus in his veriest vices there was a spurious amiability, a seductive charm; while in the graver affairs of life the intellectual susceptibility of his nature served but to quicken his penetration and stimulate his energies, and Hastings might have said, with one of his Italian contemporaries, \"That in subjection to the influences of women he had learned the government of men.\"  In a word, his powers to attract, and his capacities to command, may be guessed by this,--that Lord Hastings was the only man Richard III. seems to have loved, when Duke of Gloucester, [Sir Thomas More, \"Life of Edward V.,\" speaks of \"the great love\" Richard bore to Hastings.] and the only man he seems to have feared, when resolved to be King of England.  Hastings was alone in the apartments assigned to him in the Tower, when his page, with a peculiar smile, announced to him the visit of a young donzell, who would not impart her business to his attendants.  The accomplished chamberlain looked up somewhat impatiently from the beautiful manuscripts, enriched with the silver verse of Petrarch, which lay open on his table, and after muttering to himself, \"It is only Edward to whom the face of a woman never is unwelcome,\" bade the page admit the visitor.  The damsel entered, and the door closed upon her.  \"Be not alarmed, maiden,\" said Hastings, touched by the downcast bend of the hooded countenance, and the unmistakable and timid modesty of his visitor's bearing.  \"What hast thou to say to me?\"  At the sound of his voice, Sibyll Warner started, and uttered a faint exclamation.  The stranger of the pastime-ground was before her. Instinctively she drew the wimple yet more closely round her face, and laid her hand upon the bolt of the door as if in the impulse of retreat.  The nobleman's curiosity was roused.  He looked again and earnestly on the form that seemed to shrink from his gaze; then rising slowly, he advanced, and laid his band on her arm.  \"Donzell, I recognize thee,\" he said, in a voice that sounded cold and stern.  \"What service wouldst thou ask me to render thee?  Speak!  Nay!  I pray thee, speak.\"  \"Indeed, good my lord,\" said Sibyll, conquering her confusion; and, lifting her wimple, her dark blue eyes met those bent on her, with fearless truth and innocence, \"I knew not, and you will believe me,--I knew not till this moment that I had such cause for gratitude to the Lord Hastings.  I sought you but on the behalf of my father, Master Adam Warner, who would fain have the permission accorded to other scholars, to see the Lord Henry of Windsor, who was gracious to him in other days, and to while the duress of that princely captive with the show of a quaint instrument he has invented.\"  \"Doubtless,\" answered Hastings, who deserved his character (rare in that day) for humanity and mildness--\"doubt less it will pleasure me, nor offend his grace the king, to show all courtesy and indulgence to the unhappy gentleman and lord, whom the weal of England condemns us to hold incarcerate.  I have heard of thy father, maiden, an honest and simple man, in whom we need not fear a conspirator; and of thee, young mistress, I have heard also, since we parted.\"  \"Of me, noble sir?\"  \"Of thee,\" said Hastings, with a smile; and, placing a seat for her, he took from the table an illuminated manuscript.  \"I have to thank thy friend Master Alwyn for procuring me this treasure!\"  \"What, my lord!\" said Sibyll, and her eyes glistened, were you--you the--the--\"  \"The fortunate person whom Alwyn has enriched at so slight a cost? Yes.  Do not grudge me my good fortune in this.  Thou hast nobler treasures, methinks, to bestow on another!\"  \"My good lord!\"  \"Nay, I must not distress thee.  And the young gentleman has a fair face; may it bespeak a true heart!\"  These words gave Sibyll an emotion of strange delight.  They seemed spoken sadly, they seemed to betoken a jealous sorrow; they awoke the strange, wayward woman-feeling, which is pleased at the pain that betrays the woman's influence: the girl's rosy lips smiled maliciously.  Hastings watched her, and her face was so radiant with that rare gleam of secret happiness,--so fresh, so young, so pure, and withal so arch and captivating, that hackneyed and jaded as he was in the vulgar pursuit of pleasure, the sight moved better and tenderer feelings than those of the sensualist. \"Yes,\" he muttered to himself, \"there are some toys it were a sin to sport with and cast away amidst the broken rubbish of gone passions!\"  He turned to the table, and wrote the order of admission to Henry's prison, and as he gave it to Sibyll, he said, \"Thy young gallant, I see, is at the court now.  It is a perilous ordeal, and especially to one for whom the name of Nevile opens the road to advancement and honour.  Men learn betimes in courts to forsake Love for Plutus, and many a wealthy lord would give his heiress to the poorest gentleman who claims kindred to the Earl of Salisbury and Warwick.\"  \"May my father's guest so prosper,\" answered Sibyll, \"for he seems of loyal heart and gentle nature!\"  \"Thou art unselfish, sweet mistress,\" said Hastings; and, surprised by her careless tone, he paused a moment: \"or art thou, in truth, indifferent?  Saw I not thy hand in his, when even those loathly tymbesteres chanted warning to thee for loving, not above thy merits, but, alas, it may be, above thy fortunes?\"  Sibyll's delight increased.  Oh, then, he had not applied that hateful warning to himself!  He guessed not her secret.  She blushed, and the blush was so chaste and maidenly, while the smile that went with it was so ineffably animated and joyous, that Hastings exclaimed, with unaffected admiration, \"Surely, fair donzell, Petrarch dreamed of thee, when he spoke of the woman-blush and the angel-smile of Laura. Woe to the man who would injure thee!  Farewell!  I would not see thee too often, unless I saw thee ever.\"  He lifted her hand to his lips with a chivalrous respect as he spoke; opened the door, and called his page to attend her to the gates.  Sibyll was more flattered by the abrupt dismissal than if he had knelt to detain her.  How different seemed the world as her light step wended homeward!     CHAPTER V.  MASTER ADAM WARNER AND KING HENRY THE SIXTH.  The next morning Hilyard revisited Warner with the letters for Henry. The conspirator made Adam reveal to him the interior mechanism of the Eureka, to which Adam, who had toiled all night, had appended one of the most ingenious contrivances he had as yet been enabled (sans the diamond) to accomplish, for the better display of the agencies which the engine was designed to achieve.  This contrivance was full of strange cells and recesses, in one of which the documents were placed. And there they lay, so well concealed as to puzzle the minutest search, if not aided by the inventor, or one to"]]]
