Antiquity had given the custom a sort of sanctity, and the authorities, if they knew--which they must have done--never interfered.  But there were others.  Wrykyn, the town, was peculiarly rich in “gangs of youths.” Like the vast majority of the inhabitants of the place, they seemed to have no work of any kind whatsoever to occupy their time, which they used, accordingly, to spend prowling about and indulging in a mild, brainless, rural type of hooliganism. They seldom proceeded to practical rowdyism and never except with the school. As a rule, they amused themselves by shouting rude chaff. The school regarded them with a lofty contempt, much as an Oxford man regards the townee. The school was always anxious for a row, but it was the unwritten law that only in special circumstances should they proceed to active measures. A curious dislike for school-and-town rows and most misplaced severity in dealing with the offenders when they took place, were among the few flaws in the otherwise admirable character of the headmaster of Wrykyn. It was understood that one scragged bargees at one’s own risk, and, as a rule, it was not considered worth it.  But after an excellent supper and much singing and joviality, one’s views are apt to alter. Risks which before supper seemed great, show a tendency to dwindle.  When, therefore, the twenty or so Wrykynians who were dancing round the lamp-post were aware, in the midst of their festivities, that they were being observed and criticised by an equal number of townees, and that the criticisms were, as usual, essentially candid and personal, they found themselves forgetting the headmaster’s prejudices and feeling only that these outsiders must be put to the sword as speedily as possible, for the honour of the school.  Possibly, if the town brigade had stuck to a purely verbal form of attack, all might yet have been peace. Words can be overlooked.  But tomatoes cannot.  No man of spirit can bear to be pelted with over-ripe tomatoes for any length of time without feeling that if the thing goes on much longer he will be reluctantly compelled to take steps.  In the present crisis, the first tomato was enough to set matters moving.  As the two armies stood facing each other in silence under the dim and mysterious rays of the lamp, it suddenly whizzed out from the enemy’s ranks, and hit Wyatt on the right ear.  There was a moment of suspense. Wyatt took out his handkerchief and wiped his face, over which the succulent vegetable had spread itself.  “I don’t know how you fellows are going to pass the evening,” he said quietly. “My idea of a good after-dinner game is to try and find the chap who threw that. Anybody coming?”  For the first five minutes it was as even a fight as one could have wished to see. It raged up and down the road without a pause, now in a solid mass, now splitting up into little groups. The science was on the side of the school. Most Wrykynians knew how to box to a certain extent. But, at any rate at first, it was no time for science. To be scientific one must have an opponent who observes at least the more important rules of the ring. It is impossible to do the latest ducks and hooks taught you by the instructor if your antagonist butts you in the chest, and then kicks your shins, while some dear friend of his, of whose presence you had no idea, hits you at the same time on the back of the head. The greatest expert would lose his science in such circumstances.  Probably what gave the school the victory in the end was the righteousness of their cause. They were smarting under a sense of injury, and there is nothing that adds a force to one’s blows and a recklessness to one’s style of delivering them more than a sense of injury.  Wyatt, one side of his face still showing traces of the tomato, led the school with a vigour that could not be resisted. He very seldom lost his temper, but he did draw the line at bad tomatoes.  Presently the school noticed that the enemy were vanishing little by little into the darkness which concealed the town. Barely a dozen remained. And their lonely condition seemed to be borne in upon these by a simultaneous brain-wave, for they suddenly gave the fight up, and stampeded as one man.  The leaders were beyond recall, but two remained, tackled low by Wyatt and Clowes after the fashion of the football-field.         *       *       *       *       *  The school gathered round its prisoners, panting. The scene of the conflict had shifted little by little to a spot some fifty yards from where it had started. By the side of the road at this point was a green, depressed looking pond. Gloomy in the daytime, it looked unspeakable at night. It struck Wyatt, whose finer feelings had been entirely blotted out by tomato, as an ideal place in which to bestow the captives.  “Let’s chuck ’em in there,” he said.  The idea was welcomed gladly by all, except the prisoners. A move was made towards the pond, and the procession had halted on the brink, when a new voice made itself heard.  “Now then,” it said, “what’s all this?”  A stout figure in policeman’s uniform was standing surveying them with the aid of a small bull’s-eye lantern.  “What’s all this?”  “It’s all right,” said Wyatt.  “All right, is it? What’s on?”  One of the prisoners spoke.  “Make ’em leave hold of us, Mr. Butt. They’re a-going to chuck us in the pond.”  “Ho!” said the policeman, with a change in his voice. “Ho, are they? Come now, young gentleman, a lark’s a lark, but you ought to know where to stop.”  “It’s anything but a lark,” said Wyatt in the creamy voice he used when feeling particularly savage. “We’re the Strong Right Arm of Justice. That’s what we are. This isn’t a lark, it’s an execution.”  “I don’t want none of your lip, whoever you are,” said Mr. Butt, understanding but dimly, and suspecting impudence by instinct.  “This is quite a private matter,” said Wyatt. “You run along on your beat. You can’t do anything here.”  “Ho!”  “Shove ’em in, you chaps.”  “Stop!” From Mr. Butt.  “Oo-er!” From prisoner number one.  There was a sounding splash as willing hands urged the first of the captives into the depths. He ploughed his way to the bank, scrambled out, and vanished.  Wyatt turned to the other prisoner.  “You’ll have the worst of it, going in second. He’ll have churned up the mud a bit. Don’t swallow more than you can help, or you’ll go getting typhoid. I expect there are leeches and things there, but if you nip out quick they may not get on to you. Carry on, you chaps.”  It was here that the regrettable incident occurred. Just as the second prisoner was being launched, Constable Butt, determined to assert himself even at the eleventh hour, sprang forward, and seized the captive by the arm. A drowning man will clutch at a straw. A man about to be hurled into an excessively dirty pond will clutch at a stout policeman. The prisoner did.  Constable Butt represented his one link with dry land. As he came within reach he attached himself to his tunic with the vigour and concentration of a limpet.  At the same moment the executioners gave their man the final heave. The policeman realised his peril too late. A medley of noises made the peaceful night hideous. A howl from the townee, a yell from the policeman, a cheer from the launching party, a frightened squawk from some birds in a neighbouring tree, and a splash compared with which the first had been as nothing, and all was over.  The dark waters were lashed into a maelstrom; and then two streaming figures squelched up the further bank.  [Illustration: THE DARK WATERS WERE LASHED INTO A MAELSTROM]  The school stood in silent consternation. It was no occasion for light apologies.  “Do you know,” said Wyatt, as he watched the Law shaking the water from itself on the other side of the pond, “I’m not half sure that we hadn’t better be moving!”     CHAPTER IX  BEFORE THE STORM   Your real, devastating row has many points of resemblance with a prairie fire. A man on a prairie lights his pipe, and throws away the match. The flame catches a bunch of dry grass, and, before any one can realise what is happening, sheets of fire are racing over the country; and the interested neighbours are following their example. (I have already compared a row with a thunderstorm; but both comparisons may stand. In dealing with so vast a matter as a row there must be no stint.)  The tomato which hit Wyatt in the face was the thrown-away match. But for the unerring aim of the town marksman great events would never have happened. A tomato is a trivial thing (though it is possible that the man whom it hits may not think so), but in the present case, it was the direct cause of epoch-making trouble.  The tomato hit Wyatt. Wyatt, with others, went to look for the thrower. The remnants of the thrower’s friends were placed in the pond, and “with them,” as they say in the courts of law, Police Constable Alfred Butt.  Following the chain of events, we find Mr. Butt, having prudently changed his clothes, calling upon the headmaster.  The headmaster was grave and sympathetic; Mr. Butt fierce and revengeful.  The imagination of the force is proverbial. Nurtured on motor-cars and fed with stop-watches, it has become world-famous. Mr. Butt gave free rein to it.  “Threw me in, they did, sir. Yes, sir.”  “Threw you in!”  “Yes, sir. _Plop_!” said Mr. Butt, with a certain sad relish.  “Really, really!” said the headmaster. “Indeed! This is--dear me! I shall certainly--They threw you in!--Yes, I shall--certainly----”  Encouraged by this appreciative reception of his story, Mr. Butt started it again, right from the beginning.  “I was on my beat, sir, and I thought I heard a disturbance. I says to myself, ‘’Allo,’ I says, ‘a frakkus.

A CHRISTMAS DREAM, AND HOW IT CAME TRUE.   \"I'm so tired of Christmas I wish there never would be another one!\" exclaimed a discontented-looking little girl, as she sat idly watching her mother arrange a pile of gifts two days before they were to be given.  \"Why, Effie, what a dreadful thing to say! You are as bad as old Scrooge; and I'm afraid something will happen to you, as it did to him, if you don't care for dear Christmas,\" answered mamma, almost dropping the silver horn she was filling with delicious candies.  \"Who was Scrooge? What happened to him?\" asked Effie, with a glimmer of interest in her listless face, as she picked out the sourest lemon-drop she could find; for nothing sweet suited her just then.  \"He was one of Dickens's best people, and you can read the charming story some day. He hated Christmas until a strange dream showed him how dear and beautiful it was, and made a better man of him.\"  \"I shall read it; for I like dreams, and have a great many curious ones myself. But they don't keep me from being tired of Christmas,\" said Effie, poking discontentedly among the sweeties for something worth eating.  \"Why are you tired of what should be the happiest time of all the year?\" asked mamma, anxiously.  \"Perhaps I shouldn't be if I had something new. But it is always the same, and there isn't any more surprise about it. I always find heaps of goodies in my stocking. Don't like some of them, and soon get tired of those I do like. We always have a great dinner, and I eat too much, and feel ill next day. Then there is a Christmas tree somewhere, with a doll on top, or a stupid old Santa Claus, and children dancing and screaming over bonbons and toys that break, and shiny things that are of no use. Really, mamma, I've had so many Christmases all alike that I don't think I _can_ bear another one.\" And Effie laid herself flat on the sofa, as if the mere idea was too much for her.  Her mother laughed at her despair, but was sorry to see her little girl so discontented, when she had everything to make her happy, and had known but ten Christmas days.  \"Suppose we don't give you _any_ presents at all,--how would that suit you?\" asked mamma, anxious to please her spoiled child.  \"I should like one large and splendid one, and one dear little one, to remember some very nice person by,\" said Effie, who was a fanciful little body, full of odd whims and notions, which her friends loved to gratify, regardless of time, trouble, or money; for she was the last of three little girls, and very dear to all the family.  \"Well, my darling, I will see what I can do to please you, and not say a word until all is ready. If I could only get a new idea to start with!\" And mamma went on tying up her pretty bundles with a thoughtful face, while Effie strolled to the window to watch the rain that kept her in-doors and made her dismal.  \"Seems to me poor children have better times than rich ones. I can't go out, and there is a girl about my age splashing along, without any maid to fuss about rubbers and cloaks and umbrellas and colds. I wish I was a beggar-girl.\"  \"Would you like to be hungry, cold, and ragged, to beg all day, and sleep on an ash-heap at night?\" asked mamma, wondering what would come next.  \"Cinderella did, and had a nice time in the end. This girl out here has a basket of scraps on her arm, and a big old shawl all round her, and doesn't seem to care a bit, though the water runs out of the toes of her boots. She goes paddling along, laughing at the rain, and eating a cold potato as if it tasted nicer than the chicken and ice-cream I had for dinner. Yes, I do think poor children are happier than rich ones.\"  \"So do I, sometimes. At the Orphan Asylum today I saw two dozen merry little souls who have no parents, no home, and no hope of Christmas beyond a stick of candy or a cake. I wish you had been there to see how happy they were, playing with the old toys some richer children had sent them.\"  \"You may give them all mine; I'm so tired of them I never want to see them again,\" said Effie, turning from the window to the pretty baby-house full of everything a child's heart could desire.  \"I will, and let you begin again with something you will not tire of, if I can only find it.\" And mamma knit her brows trying to discover some grand surprise for this child who didn't care for Christmas.  Nothing more was said then; and wandering off to the library, Effie found \"A Christmas Carol,\" and curling herself up in the sofa corner, read it all before tea. Some of it she did not understand; but she laughed and cried over many parts of the charming story, and felt better without knowing why.  All the evening she thought of poor Tiny Tim, Mrs. Cratchit with the pudding, and the stout old gentleman who danced so gayly that \"his legs twinkled in the air.\" Presently bedtime arrived.  \"Come, now, and toast your feet,\" said Effie's nurse, \"while I do your pretty hair and tell stories.\"  \"I'll have a fairy tale to-night, a very interesting one,\" commanded Effie, as she put on her blue silk wrapper and little fur-lined slippers to sit before the fire and have her long curls brushed.  So Nursey told her best tales; and when at last the child lay down under her lace curtains, her head was full of a curious jumble of Christmas elves, poor children, snow-storms, sugarplums, and surprises. So it is no wonder that she dreamed all night; and this was the dream, which she never quite forgot.  She found herself sitting on a stone, in the middle of a great field, all alone. The snow was falling fast, a bitter wind whistled by, and night was coming on. She felt hungry, cold, and tired, and did not know where to go nor what to do.  \"I wanted to be a beggar-girl, and now I am one; but I don't like it, and wish somebody would come and take care of me. I don't know who I am, and I think I must be lost,\" thought Effie, with the curious interest one takes in one's self in dreams.  But the more she thought about it, the more bewildered she felt. Faster fell the snow, colder blew the wind, darker grew the night; and poor Effie made up her mind that she was quite forgotten and left to freeze alone. The tears were chilled on her cheeks, her feet felt like icicles, and her heart died within her, so hungry, frightened, and forlorn was she. Laying her head on her knees, she gave herself up for lost, and sat there with the great flakes fast turning her to a little white mound, when suddenly the sound of music reached her, and starting up, she looked and listened with all her eyes and ears.  Far away a dim light shone, and a voice was heard singing. She tried to run toward the welcome glimmer, but could not stir, and stood like a small statue of expectation while the light drew nearer, and the sweet words of the song grew clearer.      From our happy home     Through the world we roam   One week in all the year,     Making winter spring     With the joy we bring,   For Christmas-tide is here.      Now the eastern star     Shines from afar   To light the poorest home;     Hearts warmer grow,     Gifts freely flow,   For Christmas-tide has come.      Now gay trees rise     Before young eyes,   Abloom with tempting cheer;     Blithe voices sing,     And blithe bells ring,   For Christmas-tide is here.      Oh, happy chime,     Oh, blessed time,   That draws us all so near!     \"Welcome, dear day,\"     All creatures say,   For Christmas-tide is here.  A child's voice sang, a child's hand carried the little candle; and in the circle of soft light it shed, Effie saw a pretty child coming to her through the night and snow. A rosy, smiling creature, wrapped in white fur, with a wreath of green and scarlet holly on its shining hair, the magic candle in one hand, and the other outstretched as if to shower gifts and warmly press all other hands.  Effie forgot to speak as this bright vision came nearer, leaving no trace of footsteps in the snow, only lighting the way with its little candle, and filling the air with the music of its song.  \"Dear child, you are lost, and I have come to find you,\" said the stranger, taking Effie's cold hands in his, with a smile like sunshine, while every holly berry glowed like a little fire.  \"Do you know me?\" asked Effie, feeling no fear, but a great gladness, at his coming.  \"I know all children, and go to find them; for this is my holiday, and I gather them from all parts of the world to be merry with me once a year.\"  \"Are you an angel?\" asked Effie, looking for the wings.  \"No; I am a Christmas spirit, and live with my mates in a pleasant place, getting ready for our holiday, when we are let out to roam about the world, helping make this a happy time for all who will let us in. Will you come and see how we work?\"  \"I will go anywhere with you. Don't leave me again,\" cried Effie, gladly.  \"First I will make you comfortable. That is what we love to do. You are cold, and you shall be warm, hungry, and I will feed you; sorrowful, and I will make you gay.\"  With a wave of his candle all three miracles were wrought,--for the snow-flakes turned to a white fur cloak and hood on Effie's head and shoulders, a bowl of hot soup came sailing to her lips, and vanished when she had eagerly drunk the last drop; and suddenly the dismal field changed to a new world so full of wonders that all her troubles were forgotten in a minute.  Bells were ringing so merrily that it was hard to keep from dancing. Green garlands hung"]]]
