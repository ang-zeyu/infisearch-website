THE BATTLE OF HASTINGS   CHAPTER I.     In the heart of the forest land in which Hilda's abode was situated, a gloomy pool reflected upon its stagnant waters the still shadows of the autumnal foliage.  As is common in ancient forests in the neighbourhood of men's wants, the trees were dwarfed in height by repeated loppings, and the boughs sprang from the hollow, gnarled boles of pollard oaks and beeches; the trunks, vast in girth, and covered with mosses and whitening canker-stains, or wreaths of ivy, spoke of the most remote antiquity: but the boughs which their lingering and mutilated life put forth, were either thin and feeble with innumerable branchlets, or were centred on some solitary distorted limb which the woodman's axe had spared.  The trees thus assumed all manner of crooked, deformed, fantastic shapes--all betokening age, and all decay--all, in despite of the noiseless solitude around, proclaiming the waste and ravages of man.  The time was that of the first watches of night, when the autumnal moon was brightest and broadest.  You might see, on the opposite side of the pool, the antlers of the deer every now and then, moving restlessly above the fern in which they had made their couch; and, through the nearer glades, the hares and conies stealing forth to sport or to feed; or the bat wheeling low, in chase of the forest moth.  From the thickest part of the copse came a slow human foot, and Hilda, emerging, paused by the waters of the pool.  That serene and stony calm habitual to her features was gone; sorrow and passion had seized the soul of the Vala, in the midst of its fancied security from the troubles it presumed to foresee for others.  The lines of the face were deep and care-worn--age had come on with rapid strides--and the light of the eye was vague and unsettled, as if the lofty reason shook, terrified in its pride, at last.  \"Alone, alone!\" she murmured, half aloud: \"yea, evermore alone!  And the grandchild I had reared to be the mother of kings--whose fate, from the cradle, seemed linked with royalty and love--in whom, watching and hoping for, in whom, loving and heeding, methought I lived again the sweet human life--hath gone from my hearth--forsaken, broken-hearted--withering down to the grave under the shade of the barren cloister!  Is mine heart, then, all a lie?  Are the gods who led Odin from the Scythian East but the juggling fiends whom the craven Christian abhors?  Lo! the Wine Month has come; a few nights more, and the sun which all prophecy foretold should go down on the union of the icing and the maid, shall bring round the appointed day: yet Aldyth still lives, and Edith still withers; and War stands side by side with the Church, between the betrothed and the altar.  Verily, verily, my spirit hath lost its power, and leaves me bowed, in the awe of night, a feeble, aged, hopeless, childless woman!\"  Tears of human weakness rolled down the Vala's cheeks.  At that moment, a laugh came from a thing that had seemed like the fallen trunk of a tree, or a trough in which the herdsman waters his cattle, so still, and shapeless, and undefined it had lain amongst the rank weeds and night-shade and trailing creepers on the marge of the pool, The laugh was low yet fearful to hear.  Slowly, the thing moved, and rose, and took the outline of a human form; and the Prophetess beheld the witch whose sleep she had disturbed by the Saxon's grave.  \"Where is the banner?\" said the witch, laying her hand on Hilda's arm, and looking into her face with bleared and rheumy eyes, \"where is the banner thy handmaids were weaving for Harold the Earl?  Why didst thou lay aside that labour of love for Harold the King?  Hie thee home, and bid thy maidens ply all night at the work; make it potent with rune and with spell, and with gums of the seid.  Take the banner to Harold the King as a marriage-gift; for the day of his birth shall be still the day of his nuptials with Edith the Fair!\"  Hilda gazed on the hideous form before her; and so had her soul fallen from its arrogant pride of place, that instead of the scorn with which so foul a pretender to the Great Art had before inspired the King-born Prophetess, her veins tingled with credulous awe.  \"Art thou a mortal like myself,\" she said after a pause, \"or one of those beings often seen by the shepherd in mist and rain, driving before them their shadowy flocks? one of those of whom no man knoweth whether they are of earth or of Helheim? whether they have ever known the lot and conditions of flesh, or are but some dismal race between body and spirit, hateful alike to gods and to men?\"  The dreadful hag shook her head, as if refusing to answer the question, and said:  \"Sit we down, sit we down by the dead dull pool, and if thou wouldst be wise as I am, wake up all thy wrongs, fill thyself with hate, and let thy thoughts be curses.  Nothing is strong on earth but the Will; and hate to the will is as the iron in the hands of the war-man.\"  \"Ha!\" answered Hilda, \"then thou art indeed one of the loathsome brood whose magic is born, not of the aspiring soul, but the fiendlike heart.  And between us there is no union.  I am of the race of those whom priests and kings reverenced and honoured as the oracles of heaven; and rather let my lore be dimmed and weakened, in admitting the humanities of hope and love, than be lightened by the glare of the wrath that Lok and Rana bear the children of men.\"  \"What, art thou so base and so doting,\" said the hag, with fierce contempt, \"as to know that another has supplanted thine Edith, that all the schemes of thy life are undone, and yet feel no hate for the man who hath wronged her and thee?--the man who had never been king if thou hadst not breathed into him the ambition of rule?  Think, and curse!\"  \"My curse would wither the heart that is entwined within his,\" answered Hilda; \"and,\" she added abruptly, as if eager to escape from her own impulses, \"didst thou not tell me, even now, that the wrong would be redressed, and his betrothed yet be his bride on the appointed day?\"  \"Ha! home, then!--home! and weave the charmed woof of the banner, broider it with zimmes and with gold worthy the standard of a king; for I tell thee, that where that banner is planted, shall Edith clasp with bridal arms her adored.  And the hwata thou hast read by the bautastein, and in the temple of the Briton's revengeful gods, shall be fulfilled.\"  \"Dark daughter of Hela,\" said the Prophetess, \"whether demon or god hath inspired thee, I hear in my spirit a voice that tells me thou hast pierced to a truth that my lore could not reach.  Thou art houseless and poor; I will give wealth to thine age if thou wilt stand with me by the altar of Thor, and let thy galdra unriddle the secrets that have baffled mine own.  All foreshown to me hath ever come to pass, but in a sense other than that in which my soul read the rune and the dream, the leaf and the fount, the star and the Scin-laeca. My husband slain in his youth; my daughter maddened with woe; her lord murdered on his hearthstone; Sweyn, whom I loved as my child,\"--the Vala paused, contending against her own emotions,--\"I loved them all,\" she faltered, clasping her hands, \"for them I tasked the future.  The future promised fair; I lured them to their doom, and when the doom came, lo! the promise was kept! but how?--and now, Edith, the last of my race; Harold, the pride of my pride!--speak, thing of Horror and Night, canst thou disentangle the web in which my soul struggles, weak as the fly in the spider's mesh?\"  \"On the third night from this, will I stand with thee by the altar of Thor, and unriddle the rede of my masters, unknown and unguessed, whom thou hadst duteously served.  And ere the sun rise, the greatest mystery earth knows shall be bare to thy soul!\"  As the witch spoke, a cloud passed over the moon; and before the light broke forth again, the hag had vanished.  There was only seen in the dull pool, the water-rat swimming through the rank sedges; only in the forest, the grey wings of the owl, fluttering heavily across the glades; only in the grass, the red eyes of the bloated toad.  Then Hilda went slowly home, and the maids worked all night at the charmed banner.  All that night, too, the watch-dogs howled in the yard, through the ruined peristyle--howled in rage and in fear.  And under the lattice of the room in which the maids broidered the banner, and the Prophetess muttered her charm, there couched, muttering also, a dark, shapeless thing, at which those dogs howled in rage and in fear.     CHAPTER II.   All within the palace of Westminster showed the confusion and dismay of the awful time;--all, at least, save the council-chamber, in which Harold, who had arrived the night before, conferred with his thegns. It was evening: the courtyards and the halls were filled with armed men, and almost with every hour came rider and bode from the Sussex shores.  In the corridors the Churchmen grouped and whispered, as they had whispered and grouped in the day of King Edward's death.  Stigand passed among them, pale and thoughtful.  The serge gowns came rustling round the archprelate for counsel or courage.  \"Shall we go forth with the King's army?\" asked a young monk, bolder than the rest, \"to animate the host with prayer and hymn?\"  \"Fool!\" said the miserly prelate, \"fool! if we do so, and the Norman conquer, what become of our abbacies and convent lands?  The Duke wars against Harold, not England.  If he slay Harold----\"  \"What then?\"  \"The Atheling is left us yet.  Stay we here and guard the last prince of the House of Cerdic,\" whispered Stigand, and he swept on.  In the chamber in which Edward had breathed his last, his widowed Queen, with Aldyth, her successor, and Githa and some other ladies, waited the decision of the council.  By one of the windows stood, clasping each other by the hand, the fair young bride of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7683"],["title","Harold : the Last of the Saxon Kings — Volume 12 (#1)"],["body"," and the betrothed of the gay Leofwine.  Githa sate alone, bowing her face over her hands--desolate; mourning for the fate of her traitor son; and the wounds, that the recent and holier death of Thyra had inflicted, bled afresh.  And the holy lady of Edward attempted in vain, by pious adjurations, to comfort Aldyth, who, scarcely heeding her, started ever and anon with impatient terror, muttering to herself, \"Shall I lose this crown too?\"  In the council-hall debate waxed warm,--which was the wiser, to meet William at once in the battle-field, or to delay till all the forces Harold might expect (and which he had ordered to be levied, in his rapid march from York) could swell his host?  \"If we retire before the enemy,\" said Gurth, \"leaving him in a strange land, winter approaching, his forage will fail.  He will scarce dare to march upon London: if he does, we shall be better prepared to encounter him.  My voice is against resting all on a single battle.\"  \"Is that thy choice?\" said Vebba, indignantly.  \"Not so, I am sure, would have chosen thy father; not so think the Saxons of Kent.  The Norman is laying waste all the lands of thy subjects, Lord Harold; living on plunder, as a robber, in the realm of King Alfred.  Dost thou think that men will get better heart to fight for their country by hearing that their King shrinks from the danger?\"  \"Thou speakest well and wisely,\" said Haco; and all eyes turned to the young son of Sweyn, as to one who best knew the character of the hostile army and the skill of its chief.  \"We have now with us a force flushed with conquest over a foe hitherto deemed invincible.  Men who have conquered the Norwegian will not shrink from the Norman.  Victory depends upon ardour more than numbers.  Every hour of delay damps the ardour.  Are we sure that it will swell the numbers?  What I dread most is not the sword of the Norman Duke, it is his craft.  Rely upon it, that if we meet him not soon, he will march straight to London. He will proclaim by the way that he comes not to seize the throne, but to punish Harold, and abide by the Witan, or, perchance, by the word of the Roman pontiff.  The terror of his armament, unresisted, will spread like a panic through the land.  Many will be decoyed by his false pretexts, many awed by a force that the King dare not meet.  If he come in sight of the city, think you that merchants and cheapmen will not be daunted by the thought of pillage and sack?  They will be the first to capitulate at the first house which is fired.  The city is weak to guard against siege; its walls long neglected; and in sieges the Normans are famous.  Are we so united (the King's rule thus fresh) but what no cabals, no dissensions will break out amongst ourselves?  If the Duke come, as come he will, in the name of the Church, may not the Churchmen set up some new pretender to the crown-- perchance the child Edgar?  And, divided against ourselves, how ingloriously should we fall!  Besides, this land, though never before have the links between province and province been drawn so close, hath yet demarcations that make the people selfish.  The Northumbrians, I fear, will not stir to aid London, and Mercia will hold aloof from our peril.  Grant that William once seize London, all England is broken up and dispirited; each shire, nay, each town, looking only to itself. Talk of delay as wearing out the strength of the foe!  No, it would wear out our own.  Little eno', I fear, is yet left in our treasury. If William seize London, that treasury is his, with all the wealth of our burgesses.  How should we maintain an army, except by preying on the people, and thus discontenting them?  Where guard that army? Where are our forts? where our mountains?  The war of delay suits only a land of rock and defile, or of castle and breast-work.  Thegns and warriors, ye have no castles but your breasts of mail.  Abandon these, and you are lost.\"  A general murmur of applause closed this speech of Haco, which, while wise in arguments our historians have overlooked, came home to that noblest reason of brave men, which urges prompt resistance to foul invasion.  Up, then, rose King Harold.  \"I thank you, fellow-Englishmen, for that applause with which ye have greeted mine own thoughts on the lips of Haco.  Shall it be said that your King rushed to chase his own brother from the soil of outraged England, yet shrunk from the sword of the Norman stranger?  Well indeed might my brave subjects desert my banner if it floated idly over these palace walls while the armed invader pitched his camp in the heart of England.  By delay, William's force, whatever it might be, cannot grow less; his cause grows more strong in our craven fears. What his armament may be we rightly know not; the report varies with every messenger, swelling and lessening with the rumours of every hour.  Have we not around us now our most stalwart veterans--the flower of our armies--the most eager spirits--the vanquishers of Hardrada?  Thou sayest, Gurth, that all should not be perilled on a single battle.  True.  Harold should be perilled, but wherefore England?  Grant that we win the day; the quicker our despatch, the greater our fame, the more lasting that peace at home and abroad which rests ever its best foundation on the sense of the power which wrong cannot provoke unchastised.  Grant that we lose; a loss can be made gain by a king's brave death.  Why should not our example rouse and unite all who survive us?  Which the nobler example--the one best fitted to protect our country--the recreant backs of living chiefs, or the glorious dead with their fronts to the foe?  Come what may, life or death, at least we will thin the Norman numbers, and heap the barriers of our corpses on the Norman march.  At least, we can show to the rest of England how men should defend their native land!  And if, as I believe and pray, in every English breast beats a heart like Harold's, what matters though a king should fall?--Freedom is immortal.\"  He spoke; and forth from his baldric he drew his sword.  Every blade, at that signal, leapt from the sheath: and, in that council-hall at least, in every breast beat the heart of Harold.     CHAPTER III.   The chiefs dispersed to array their troops for the morrow's march; but Harold and his kinsmen entered the chamber where the women waited the decision of the council, for that, in truth, was to them the parting interview.  The King had resolved, after completing all his martial preparations, to pass the night in the Abbey of Waltham; and his brothers lodged, with the troops they commanded, in the city or its suburbs.  Haco alone remained with that portion of the army quartered in and around the palace.  They entered the chamber, and in a moment each heart had sought its mate; in the mixed assembly each only conscious of the other.  There, Gurth bowed his noble head over the weeping face of the young bride that for the last time nestled to his bosom.  There, with a smiling lip, but tremulous voice, the gay Leofwine soothed and chided in a breath the maiden he had wooed as the partner for a life that his mirthful spirit made one holiday; snatching kisses from a cheek no longer coy.  But cold was the kiss which Harold pressed on the brow of Aldyth; and with something of disdain, and of bitter remembrance of a nobler love, he comforted a terror which sprang from the thought of self.  \"Oh, Harold!\" sobbed Aldyth, \"be not rashly brave: guard thy life for my sake.  Without thee, what am I?  Is it even safe for me to rest here?  Were it not better to fly to York, or seek refuge with Malcolm the Scot?\"  \"Within three days at the farthest,\" answered Harold, \"thy brothers will be in London.  Abide by their counsel; act as they advise at the news of my victory or my fall.\"  He paused abruptly, for he heard close beside him the broken voice of Gurth's bride, in answer to her lord.  \"Think not of me, beloved; thy whole heart now be England's.  And if--if\"--her voice failed a moment, but resumed proudly, \"why even then thy wife is safe, for she survives not her lord and her land!\"  The King left his wife's side, and kissed his brother's bride.  \"Noble heart!\" he said; \"with women like thee for our wives and mothers, England could survive the slaughter of thousand kings.\"  He turned, and knelt to Githa.  She threw her arms over his broad breast, and wept bitterly.  \"Say--say, Harold, that I have not reproached thee for Tostig's death. I have obeyed the last commands of Godwin my lord.  I have deemed thee ever right and just; now let me not lose thee, too.  They go with thee, all my surviving sons, save the exile Wolnoth,--him whom now I shall never behold again.  Oh, Harold!--let not mine old age be childless!\"  \"Mother,--dear, dear mother, with these arms round my neck I take new life and new heart.  No! never hast thou reproached me for my brother's death--never for aught which man's first duty enjoined. Murmur not that that duty commands us still.  We are the sons, through thee, of royal heroes; through my father, of Saxon freemen.  Rejoice that thou hast three sons left, whose arms thou mayest pray God and his saints to prosper, and over whose graves, if they fall, thou shalt shed no tears of shame!\"  Then the widow of King Edward, who (the crucifix clasped in her hands) had listened to Harold with lips apart and marble cheeks, could keep down no longer her human woman's heart; she rushed to Harold as he still knelt to Githa--knelt by his side, and clasped him in her arms with despairing fondness:  \"O brother, brother, whom I have so dearly loved when all other love seemed forbidden me;--when he who gave me a throne refused me his heart; when, looking at thy fair promise, listening to thy tender comfort,--when, remembering the days of old, in which thou wert my docile pupil, and we dreamed bright dreams together of happiness and fame to come,--when, loving thee methought too well, too much as weak mothers may love a"]]]
