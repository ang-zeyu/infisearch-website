What shall I do!\" Polly turned. \"Phronsie dear, you mustn't come now.\" Joel had sunk down and covered his face with his hands, trying not to scream. \"Go right back to your chair, Polly says so. Be a good girl, Pet.\" She looked straight into the blue eyes wide with astonishment at being sent back.  \"Please let me, Polly,\" begged the little girl.  \"No,\" said Polly, firmly, \"Mamsie wouldn't like it. Go back, Phronsie, and shut the door.\"  Phronsie turned without a word and went slowly back, and as Polly seized Joel's hand and sped into the woodshed, they could hear the kitchen door shut, and knew that she had gone back to her chair.  When Polly and Joel reached little David, Joel was beyond words, and he fell down and flung his arms around the little figure. Davie stirred and moaned. \"Help me lift him up, Joe,\" cried Polly, hoarsely.  \"I couldn't get the nails,\" said David, \"and then they all spilled. I'm sorry, Polly,\" and he opened his eyes and looked up into her white face.  When Joel saw that David could speak, he gave a great gasp. \"It was my fault,\" he sobbed.  \"Never mind, Davie dear,\" said Polly, soothingly. \"We can pick the nails up.\"  \"I'll pick 'em up,\" cried Joel, delighted to find something to do, and he sprang up and went scrambling around and sweeping them into a pile with his fingers, while the big tears trailed down his round cheeks.  \"See, now,\" said Polly, trying to speak gayly, \"how the old nails have to hop into the box again.\"  \"So they do,\" said David, with a wan little smile. Then he shut his eyes.  \"Run as fast as you can, Joe,\" said Polly, \"and ask Grandma Bascom to come over.\" Then she lifted Davie and struggled with him to a pile of grain bags in the corner. \"I can't get him into the bedroom till Joel helps me, and besides, I must get Phronsie out of the kitchen first,\" she thought. \"Oh, God! _please_ don't let Davie die,\" she cried deep in her heart.  Joel flew on the wings of the wind, his heart beating like a trip-hammer, over down across the lane to Grandma Bascom's little cottage. Grandma, with a tin pan full of wet corn meal, was just going out to feed her hens, when he dashed up behind her. \"Please come!\" he shouted, his trembling mouth close to her cap-border. \"Polly wants you!\"  [Illustration: \"'PLEASE COME!' HE SHOUTED CLOSE TO HER CAP-BORDER\"]  \"Polly's here, now that's nice!\" said Grandma, well pleased. \"You just wait a minute, and I'll be ready to see her. Come, Biddy-Biddy,\" she called, and waddling off, she gathered up a handful of the wet corn meal.  \"Oh, come now!\" roared Joe, and seizing her hand, he pulled her back toward the kitchen. \"Dear Grandma Bascom, please come; Dave's killed, I guess,\" and before she knew it, she was halfway to the little brown house, and in a minute or two more there she was before Davie lying on the pile of grain bags, and Polly holding his hand, and fanning him with an old newspaper.  \"He's all right,\" said Grandma, with a practised eye; \"only just fainted a bit. Now 'tisn't anything to what my son John's Abram did one summer he spent with me. Used to tumble over most every day.\"  \"He fell,\" said Polly. She could say no more, but pointed up to the beam. Then she found her voice. \"The box of nails--I didn't know 'twas up there, see!\" and she pointed to them, where Joel had tried to gather them up.  \"He fell down from there?\" asked Grandma, looking up at the beam.  Polly nodded, not trusting herself to speak. Joel wrung his hands together, and stood quite still.  \"In that case,\" said Grandma, \"this boy must go for Dr. Fisher just as soon as he can.\"  \"Run, Joe, as hard as ever you can,\" gasped Polly.  No need to tell Joel that. Over the fields and across lots he ran like a deer, scaling stone walls in a flash, only to reach the doctor's house to be told that he was away twenty miles into the country. Then Joel sat down on the grass by the roadside, and burying his face in his hands, cried as if his heart would break.  He didn't mind that a pair of spirited black horses were coming down the road, the bright horses all a-jingle, and the carriage all a-bloom with gay colors, and merry with cheery voices.  \"What's the matter?\" called somebody to him, but he cried on as hard as he could.  Then his little shoulder in his homespun jacket was shaken smartly. \"See here, my boy, either you tell me what you're screaming for, or I'll pick you up and carry you off.\"  Joel looked up, the streams of tears making muddy paths along his face, where he had rubbed it with his grimy hands. \"Dave's killed,\" he burst out, \"and the--the doctor's gone away!\"  \"Come on.\" It was a kind face that was over him, and in a minute Joel felt himself lifted by a pair of strong arms that presently tossed him into the carriage, in amongst the occupants, while the owner of the arms jumped in beside him. \"Do you know the way home?\" he asked.  \"Of course,\" said Joel; \"it's the little brown house--\" then he began to cry again.  \"See here, my lad, look at me.\" Joel rolled his eyes up at the man, the rest of the people keeping quite still to listen. \"You are a brave boy, I know. Now I'm a doctor, and if you'll just take me to your house, I'll have a look at that Dave of yours. Which way?\"  Joel sat bolt upright as well as he could, being crammed in between a big fat man and his kind friend, and directed this way and that way, his tears all gone, and before any one could hardly think twice, the pair of black horses and the jingling harness and big carriage had stopped before the little brown house, and the doctor was springing over the stepping-stones in such a lively fashion that Joel had to run to keep up with him, until there they were, with Grandma Bascom waddling around in search of some herbs that were drying in the corner of the woodshed, and Polly still holding David's hand as he lay on the pile of grain bags. And in five minutes the new doctor had all the examination made, and Davie was sitting up, his head on Polly's shoulder; and no bones were broken, and all the trouble was the fright produced by the shock of the fall. And the color flew back into Polly's cheek, and Grandma Bascom kept saying, \"Praise the Lord--and who be ye, anyway?\" bobbing her cap-border at the new doctor. And he laughed and didn't tell her.  But he did tell some funny stories. And little Davie laughed; and when they saw that, they all laughed, and the people out in the carriage said, \"Just like Dr. Herman,\" and one tall girl, with her hat all covered with red roses, said, \"Uncle John is always doing such queer things. I do wish he would hurry and come. It is too bad to have our driving tour interrupted like that.\" And pretty soon down the stepping-stones he came, as light and quick as could be, Grandma Bascom lifting both hands and calling after him, \"Well, you're an angel of the Lord, anyway,\" and the new doctor was laughing. But he had stopped to look into Polly's brown eyes. \"Don't worry, little girl, he's all right,\" he said.  Joel squeezed past them through the doorway, and ran after him.  \"Please stop just a minute,\" he begged.  \"Hey?\" said the doctor, turning his foot on the step. The tall girl in the hat with big red roses looked impatient enough, and beat her foot on the carriage floor, but Joel kept on.  \"I like you,\" he burst out, \"ever'n ever so much.\"  The doctor put one hand on Joel's stubby black hair, and turned his grimy face up. \"You've got to be a man,\" he said; \"now look out for it while you're a boy. I guess you'll do.\" He jumped into the carriage and drove the black pair of horses off at a smart gait down the road, while Joel stood on the roadside grass to see him go.     IV  THE MUFFIN MAN AND THE TRAMP   So when the time came that was to bring Mamsie home that night, tired, but happy to fold her baby to her heart, for Phronsie always climbed into her lap to untie her bonnet-strings, there was David, running around brisk as a bee, his cheeks pink as a rose, and Joel, who had stuck to the old box of nails all day, despite Polly's pleadings to stop and rest, gave a shout that the last was done, and stretched his tired legs. Then he gave a hop and skip and jump around and around the grass before the little brown house.  \"Whickets! that feels good!\" he cried, stopping for a long breath by the old green door; then away again, kicking up his heels like a colt.  \"He's done 'em almost every one,\" said Davie, mournfully, standing on the doorstone to see him go; \"he wouldn't let me help only a teenty bit, and he's so tired, Polly.\"  \"Joel wanted to do 'em, Davie dear,\" said Polly, coming to the door, on hearing that, and giving him a loving little pat. \"I know all about it, why he wanted to do it\"--for Joel had told her the whole story--\"and Mamsie'll be glad he did it. How I wish she'd come!\" peering down the dusty road.  \"How I wish she'd come!\" echoed Phronsie, poking her head in between Polly's gown and the door jamb.  \"Dear me,\" cried Polly, whirling around, \"are you there, Pet? Well, Mamsie's coming pretty soon. I think I see--No, 'tisn't,\" as David started to scamper over the stepping-stones--\"it's a man turning the road. Anyway, she'll be here before we hardly know it, I guess. Now let's play something, and that'll make the time go faster.\"  \"Oh, hooray!\" cried little Davie, and, \"Hooray!\" piped Phronsie. \"_Joel--Joel!_\" screamed David; and Phronsie clapped her hands and screamed too, and Polly laughed and called as hard as she could, for Joel, imagining himself a gay trotting horse, was slapping his legs with a switch, and careering around the back of the little brown house in a great state of excitement. Now hearing the calls, he came whooping around, making all the noise he possibly could, so there was a perfectly dreadful din, and no wonder that the man Polly had seen turning the road came nearer without any one noticing him.  He thought it was so convenient for him that all the children in the house should be out in the front "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7434"],["title","The Adventures of Joel Pepper (#5)"],["body","yard, that perhaps he had better hop over the stone wall and go quietly in at the back door; for really he was very hungry, and there must be as much as a piece of bread, although the little brown house didn't look as if it held much meat and pie and cake. So over the wall he went, and slunk in through the tall grass, just as Polly was marshalling her forces on the greensward in front and saying, \"Now, children, what shall we play?\"  \"Tag--tag!\" screamed Joel, crowding up in front. \"Now begin, Polly, do, and let me be it.\"  \"I'd rather have the Muffin Man,\" said Davie, wistfully.  \"Muffin--Man--Muffin--Man,\" echoed Phronsie, beating her small hands. \"Oh, Polly, please do let us have the Muffin Man,\" she cried, her yellow hair flying over her flushed face as she hopped up and down. \"Please, Polly!\"  \"Pshaw!\" Joel exclaimed, contemptuously, \"that old Muffin Man, he's no fun. I say 'Tag.' Do begin, Polly,\" he pulled her sleeve impatiently.  \"The Muffin Man is so very nice,\" said Davie, reflectively, \"and we haven't played it in so long.\"  \"That old--\" began Joel, crossly. Then he caught Polly's eye. \"All right, Dave,\" he cried. \"Go on, Polly. And let Dave be the Muffin Man, do, Polly.\"  Polly shot him a beaming glance. \"Now that's nice,\" and she took Phronsie's hand, who was so overcome with delight she could not stand still, but was engaged in making a cheese, and tumbling over in a heap on the grass. \"Come on, Pet,\" and Polly pulled her up, \"don't you see the Muffin Man is waiting for us?\" for there was David standing off at the end of the grass-plot, as stiff as a stick, and most dignified, all ready to receive his visitors.  It was after the merry line was dancing back into place that Joel happened to glance up at the window of the kitchen. And as quick as a shot he dropped Polly's hand and skipped off on the tips of his toes over the grass and around the back of the house.  \"Dear me!\" cried Polly, \"whatever can have happened to Joel?\"  \"Do come on, Polly,\" begged Phronsie, pulling at her other hand, and lifting her flushed face pleadingly, \"and let us see the Muffin Man once more.\"  \"So we will, dear,\" said Polly. \"Now then!\" So they danced off gayly. \"We all know the Muffin Man--the Muffin Man--the Muffin Man. We all know the Muffin Man, that lives in Crumpet Lane.\"  Meantime, Joel rushed in over the back doorstep and into the kitchen before the man he had seen through the kitchen window could hear him and turn away from the old cupboard. When he did, he said something that wouldn't have sounded nice had Joel stopped to hear it. As it was, he bounded in. \"What are you doing in our house?\" he cried, doubling up his fists. \"Hey?\" said the man. He wasn't very nice to look at either, and he peered over and around Joel's sturdy figure, to see if more of the children were coming after. When he saw that Joel was alone, and could hear the gay voices out on the grass-plot, he looked perfectly wicked, and he laughed as he pointed a long and dirty hand at him.  \"You scream, or stir from your tracks, and I'll make mincemeat of you!\" he hissed.  \"I ain't a-goin' to scream,\" declared Joel, scornfully, \"an' I'm goin' to drive you out of our house.\" With that he dashed at the man with both small brown fists well doubled up, pommelling right and left, and butting his stubby black head into the stranger's waistcoat. And the next minute he was caught in the long hands and tossed with a thump to the old kitchen floor, and the wicked eyes were over him as he lay there panting.  \"What did I tell you!\" cried the man. \"Now I'm going to make mincemeat of you.\"  \"We all know the Muffin Man that lives in Crumpet Lane,\" sang Polly and Phronsie merrily, out on the grass-plot, as they danced away.  \"Where _is_ Joel?\" cried Polly, as they stopped to take breath.  \"Just once more,\" begged Phronsie, pulling her hand; \"please, Polly.\" So down to see the Muffin Man again they danced.  Meantime, Joel was tied up tight and fast with the clothes-line to the table leg, and in order that he should not use his tongue, Seraphina's clothes, where Phronsie had thrown her on the floor, were torn off and crammed into his mouth.  \"Now I guess you'll keep still,\" said the man, turning back to the cupboard with a grin; \"and as long as those youngsters are at their noise out there, I'm safe enough,\" and he pulled out Polly's bread she had just baked that day, done up in a clean old towel.  \"Humph!\" as he thrust his tousled head into the cupboard, and searched for butter, and ran his dirty hands all over the clean, bare shelves--\"well, this will keep me from starving.\" So he rolled the towel as tightly as he could over the bread, and slouched off, shaking his fist at Joel with a parting scowl.  \"Now, Phronsie, I can't play another single time,\" said Polly. \"I must see where Joel is.\" So she dropped the fat little hand and raced off, the other children after her.  \"Joel--Joel--\" they all cried, and just then Mamsie was coming down the road--oh! so tired, as she had had to stay later than usual, for the Conference was to meet at the minister's house next day, and besides the study carpet to be put down, there were ever and ever so many things to be done. But she had an extra quarter of a dollar in her pocket, and Polly was to run over after the Conference dinner and get a basket of the eatables. \"If they leave any,\" Miss Jerusha, the minister's sister, had said grimly, \"which isn't very likely. I've heard 'em preach often enough of starved souls. La! 'tisn't a circumstance to the starved bodies they bring along to Conference.\" So Mrs. Pepper was turning in at the dooryard of the little brown house in a happy frame of mind, when she heard a babel of voices, and Phronsie's little shrill voice above them all.  \"Goodness me, the house must be afire!\" she exclaimed, hurrying over the grass and in at the door. There was Joel, tied hand and foot, his black eyes blazing, while he was talking as fast as he could rattle, and Polly was untying the clothes-line, little Davie getting in the way, with trembling fingers, while Phronsie stood still and screamed.  \"He's got all our bread!\" shouted Joel. \"Oh, Mamsie!\" Phronsie turned and saw Mrs. Pepper, and ran to her with outstretched arms.  \"Whatever in all this world,\" exclaimed Mother Pepper, grasping her baby tightly. \"There--there--Phronsie, don't cry, Mammy's here.\"  \"Oh, Mamsie--Mamsie!\" mourned Polly, tugging at the knots in the clothes-line. Davie scuttled over to Mother Pepper and tried to get within her arms, too.  \"Our bread!\" screamed Joel, in a rage, and kicking at the knots. \"Let me up! I'm going after him. He's got it all out of the cupboard, I tell you!\"  \"Joel,\" said Mrs. Pepper, kneeling down by him, with Phronsie by her side, and putting both arms around his struggling figure, \"Mother doesn't care about the bread; she's got you safe.\"  Joel snuggled up close to her. \"I couldn't help his gettin' it,\" he sniffled, \"Mamsie, I couldn't.\" Then he broke out into a loud sob.  \"Mother knows you couldn't,\" said Mrs. Pepper, and she shivered as she thought of what might have been. \"You're my brave boy. But you mustn't go after him, nor out of the house.\"  \"Oh, Mammy!\" exclaimed Joel, lifting up his head, his tears all gone. \"I can catch him.\" He gave an impatient pull at the knots.  \"Take care, Joe,\" cried Polly, \"you're pulling 'em tighter. Oh, Mammy, let us all go after him,\" she begged with flashing eyes. \"We can catch the bad wicked man.\"  \"No,\" said Mrs. Pepper, firmly, \"not a single one of you must stir out of this house unless I tell you. And as for bread, why, we can do without it so long as Joel is safe.\"  \"Phooh!\" said Joel, \"he didn't hurt me any,\" just as Polly got the last knot out that tied his arms. Then he set to work to help her get his legs free. And in a trice he jumped to his feet and ran to the window.  \"Oh, Mamsie,\" he teased, craning his neck to look up and down the road, \"do let me go. I can get some sticks in the woodshed, and I guess I can scare him then.\"  \"All of us,\" pleaded Polly, hurrying to Mrs. Pepper; \"just think, Mamsie, with big sticks. Do let us.\"  But Mother Pepper shook her head. \"We'll all go over to Grandma Bascom's and see if he went there. Then Ben'll be home, and he can run over and tell Deacon Brown. He'll know how to catch the thief.\"  \"I'm goin' with Ben,\" announced Joel, decidedly, and coming into the middle of the kitchen with a bound. \"He's my thief. An' I'm goin' with Mr. Brown to catch him. So there!\"  Mrs. Pepper shivered again, but smiled at Phronsie, who clutched her tightly with her little arms around the neck. \"Well, I declare!\" she said with a cheery laugh, \"aren't you going to untie Mother's bonnet-strings, Baby?\"  \"Yes, Phronsie,\" said Polly, with another little laugh, \"so you ought to. I declare, we're all so excited we don't know what to do. I'm going to make your tea, Mamsie,\" and she spun off to the old stove.  Mrs. Pepper smiled at her approvingly. \"I won't wait for that now; we ought to get over and see how Grandma Bascom is. I don't believe he went there, but we'll see.\"  \"I forgot all about her,\" said Polly, in a shamefaced way. \"I'll run down the lane and see. You don't need to come, Mamsie. We three will go.\"  \"I'm goin'. I'm goin',\" screamed Joel, rushing for the door.  \"Joel,\" called his mother, \"come here.\" Joel slowly retraced his steps.  \"Remember one thing. You stay with Polly, and do just as she says. And now, children, hurry along. And if you see the man, you call me.\" And Mrs. Pepper went to the door, and, with Phronsie in her arms, watched them scramble down the lane, and up to Grandma's little cottage.  But Grandma Bascom hadn't seen anybody pass that way, and wasn't a bit afraid. There she sat, drinking her bowl of tea out under the lilac bushes.  \"Run in an' get some pep'mint drops out o' the cupboard,\" she said sociably, \"they're in the big green dish. Be careful of it, for it's cracked.\"  \"We can't,\" said Polly, \"Mamsie wants us"]]]
