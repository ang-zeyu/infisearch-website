'With sword and with mail will he come to punish the perjurer: and by the aid of St. Michael, archangel of war, he will conquer his own.'  Amen.\"  \"By sea and by land, with sword and with mail, will we meet the invader,\" answered the King, with a flashing eye.  \"Thou hast said:-- so depart.\"  The monk turned and withdrew.  \"Let the priest's insolence chafe thee not, sweet lord,\" said Aldyth. \"For the vow which thou mightest take as subject, what matters it now thou art king?\"  Harold made no answer to Aldyth, but turned to his Chamberlain, who stood behind his throne chair.  \"Are my brothers without?\"  \"They are: and my lord the King's chosen council.\"  \"Admit them: pardon, Aldyth; affairs fit only for men claim me now.\"  The Lady of England took the hint, and rose.  \"But the even-mete will summon thee soon,\" said she.  Harold, who had already descended from his chair of state, and was bending over a casket of papers on the table, replied:  \"There is food here till the morrow; wait me not.\"  Aldyth sighed, and withdrew at the one door, while the thegns most in Harold's confidence entered at the other.  But, once surrounded by her maidens, Aldyth forgot all, save that she was again a queen,--forgot all, even to the earlier and less gorgeous diadem which her lord's hand had shattered on the brows of the son of Pendragon.  Leofwine, still gay and blithe-hearted, entered first: Gurth followed, then Haco, then some half-score of the greater thegns.  They seated themselves at the table, and Gurth spoke first:  \"Tostig has been with Count William.\"  \"I know it,\" said Harold.  \"It is rumoured that he has passed to our uncle Sweyn.\"  \"I foresaw it,\" said the King.  \"And that Sweyn will aid him to reconquer England for the Dane.\"  \"My bode reached Sweyn, with letters from Githa, before Tostig; my bode has returned this day.  Sweyn has dismissed Tostig; Sweyn will send fifty ships, armed with picked men, to the aid of England.\"  \"Brother,\" cried Leofwine, admiringly, \"thou providest against danger ere we but surmise it.\"  \"Tostig,\" continued the King, unheeding the compliment, \"will be the first assailant: him we must meet.  His fast friend is Malcolm of Scotland: him we must secure.  Go thou, Leofwine, with these letters to Malcolm.--The next fear is from the Welch.  Go thou, Edwin of Mercia, to the princes of Wales.  On thy way, strengthen the forts and deepen the dykes of the marches.  These tablets hold thy instructions. The Norman, as doubtless ye know, my thegns, hath sent to demand our crown, and hath announced the coming of his war.  With the dawn I depart to our port at Sandwich [232], to muster our fleets.  Thou with me, Gurth.\"  \"These preparations need much treasure,\" said an old thegn, \"and thou hast lessened the taxes at the hour of need.\"  \"Not yet is it the hour of need.  When it comes, our people will the more readily meet it with their gold as with their iron.  There was great wealth in the House of Godwin; that wealth mans the ships of England.  What hast thou there, Haco?\"  \"Thy new-issued coin: it hath on its reverse the word PEACE.\" [233]  Who ever saw one of those coins of the Last Saxon King, the bold simple head on the one side, that single word \"Peace\" on the other, and did not feel awed and touched!  What pathos in that word compared with the fate which it failed to propitiate!  \"Peace,\" said Harold: \"to all that doth not render peace, slavery. Yea, may I live to leave peace to our children!  Now, peace only rests on our preparation for war.  You, Morcar, will return with all speed to York, and look well to the mouth of the Humber.\"  Then, turning to each of the thegns successively he gave to each his post and his duty; and that done, converse grew more general.  The many things needful that had been long rotting in neglect under the Monk-king, and now sprung up, craving instant reform, occupied them long and anxiously.  But cheered and inspirited by the vigour and foresight of Harold, whose earlier slowness of character seemed winged by the occasion into rapid decision (as is not uncommon with the Englishman), all difficulties seemed light, and hope and courage were in every breast.     CHAPTER VIII.   Back went Hugues Maigrot, the monk, to William, and told the reply of Harold to the Duke, in the presence of Lanfranc.  William himself heard it in gloomy silence, for Fitzosborne as yet had been wholly unsuccessful in stirring up the Norman barons to an expedition so hazardous, in a cause so doubtful; and though prepared for the defiance of Harold, the Duke was not prepared with the means to enforce his threats and make good his claim.  So great was his abstraction, that he suffered the Lombard to dismiss the monk without a word spoken by him; and he was first startled from his reverie by Lanfranc's pale hand on his vast shoulder, and Lanfranc's low voice in his dreamy ear:  \"Up! Hero of Europe: for thy cause is won!  Up! and write with thy bold characters, bold as if graved with the point of the sword, my credentials to Rome.  Let me depart ere the sun sets: and as I go, look on the sinking orb, and behold the sun of the Saxon that sets evermore on England!\"  Then briefly, that ablest statesman of the age, (and forgive him, despite our modern lights, we must; for, sincere son of the Church, he regarded the violated oath of Harold as entailing the legitimate forfeiture of his realm, and, ignorant of true political freedom, looked upon Church and Learning as the only civilisers of men,) then, briefly, Lanfranc detailed to the listening Norman the outline of the arguments by which he intended to move the Pontifical court to the Norman side; and enlarged upon the vast accession throughout all Europe which the solemn sanction of the Church would bring to his strength.  William's reawaking and ready intellect soon seized upon the importance of the object pressed upon him.  He interrupted the Lombard, drew pen and parchment towards him, and wrote rapidly. Horses were harnessed, horsemen equipped in haste, and with no unfitting retinue Lanfranc departed on the mission, the most important in its consequences that ever passed from potentate to pontiff. [234] Rebraced to its purpose by Lanfranc's cheering assurances, the resolute, indomitable soul of William now applied itself, night and day, to the difficult task of rousing his haughty vavasours.  Yet weeks passed before he could even meet a select council composed of his own kinsmen and most trusted lords.  These, however, privately won over, promised to serve him \"with body and goods.\"  But one and all they told him, he must gain the consent of the whole principality in a general council.  That council was convened: thither came not only lords and knights, but merchants and traders,--all the rising middle class of a thriving state.  The Duke bared his wrongs, his claims, and his schemes.  The assembly would not or did not discuss the matter in his presence, they would not be awed by its influence; and William retired from the hall. Various were the opinions, stormy the debate; and so great the disorder grew, that Fitzosborne, rising in the midst, exclaimed:  \"Why this dispute?--why this unduteous discord?  Is not William your lord?  Hath he not need of you?  Fail him now--and, you know him well --by G--- he will remember it!  Aid him--and you know him well--large are his rewards to service and love!\"  Up rose at once baron and merchant; and when at last their spokesman was chosen, that spokesman said: \"William is our lord; is it not enough to pay to our lord his dues?  No aid do we owe beyond the seas! Sore harassed and taxed are we already by his wars!  Let him fail in this strange and unparalleled hazard, and our land is undone!\"  Loud applause followed this speech; the majority of the council were against the Duke.  \"Then,\" said Fitzosborne, craftily, \"I, who know the means of each man present, will, with your leave, represent your necessities to your Count, and make such modest offer of assistance as may please ye, yet not chafe your liege.\"  Into the trap of this proposal the opponents fell; and Fitzosborne, at the head of the body, returned to William.  The Lord of Breteuil approached the dais, on which William sate alone, his great sword in his hand, and thus spoke:  \"My liege, I may well say that never prince has people more leal than yours, nor that have more proved their faith and love by the burdens they have borne and the monies they have granted.\"  An universal murmur of applause followed these words.  \"Good! good!\" almost shouted the merchants especially.  William's brows met, and he looked very terrible.  The Lord of Breteuil gracefully waved his hand, and resumed:  \"Yea, my liege, much have they borne for your glory and need; much more will they bear.\"  The faces of the audience fell.  \"Their service does not compel them to aid you beyond the seas.\"  The faces of the audience brightened.  \"But now they will aid you, in the land of the Saxon as in that of the Frank.\"  \"How?\" cried a stray voice or two.  \"Hush, O gentilz amys.  Forward, then, O my liege, and spare them in nought.  He who has hitherto supplied you with two good mounted soldiers, will now grant you four; and he who--\"  \"No, no, no!\" roared two-thirds of the assembly; \"we charged you with no such answer; we said not that, nor that shall it be!\"  Out stepped a baron.  \"Within this country, to defend it, we will serve our Count; but to aid him to conquer another man's country, no!\"  Out stepped a knight.  \"If once we rendered this double service, beyond seas as at home, it would be held a right and a custom hereafter; and we should be as mercenary soldiers, not free-born Normans.\"  Out stepped a merchant.  \"And we and our children would be burdened for ever to feed one man's ambition, whenever he saw a king to dethrone, or a realm to seize.\"  And then cried a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7682"],["title","Harold : the Last of the Saxon Kings â€” Volume 11 (#6)"],["body","chorus:  \"'t shall not be--it shall not!\"  The assembly broke at once into knots of tens, twenties, thirties, gesticulating and speaking aloud, like freemen in anger.  And ere William, with all his prompt dissimulation, could do more than smother his rage, and sit griping his sword hilt, and setting his teeth, the assembly dispersed.  Such were the free souls of the Normans under the greatest of their chiefs; and had those souls been less free, England had not been enslaved in one age, to become free again, God grant, to the end of time!     CHAPTER IX.   Through the blue skies over England there rushed the bright stranger-- a meteor, a comet, a fiery star!  \"such as no man before ever saw;\" it appeared on the 8th, before the kalends of May; seven nights did it shine [235], and the faces of sleepless men were pale under the angry glare.  The river of Thames rushed blood-red in the beam, the winds at play on the broad waves of the Humber, broke the surge of the billows into sparkles of fire.  With three streamers, sharp and long as the sting of a dragon, the foreboder of wrath rushed through the hosts of the stars.  On every ruinous fort, by sea-coast and march, the warder crossed his breast to behold it; on hill and in thoroughfare, crowds nightly assembled to gaze on the terrible star.  Muttering hymns, monks hudded together round the altars, as if to exorcise the land of a demon.  The gravestone of the Saxon father-chief was lit up, as with the coil of the lightning; and the Morthwyrtha looked from the mound, and saw in her visions of awe the Valkyrs in the train of the fiery star.  On the roof of his palace stood Harold the King, and with folded arms he looked on the Rider of Night.  And up the stairs of the turret came the soft steps of Haco, and stealing near to the King, he said:  \"Arm in haste, for the bodes have come breathless to tell thee that Tostig, thy brother, with pirate and war-ship, is wasting thy shores and slaughtering thy people!\"     CHAPTER X.   Tostig, with the ships he had gained both from Norman and Norwegian, recruited by Flemish adventurers, fled fast from the banners of Harold.  After plundering the Isle of Wight, and the Hampshire coasts, he sailed up the Humber, where his vain heart had counted on friends yet left him in his ancient earldom; but Harold's soul of vigour was everywhere.  Morcar, prepared by the King's bodes, encountered and chased the traitor, and, deserted by most of his ships, with but twelve small craft Tostig gained the shores of Scotland.  There, again forestalled by the Saxon King, he failed in succour from Malcolm, and retreating to the Orkneys, waited the fleets of Hardrada.  And now Harold, thus at freedom for defence against a foe more formidable and less unnatural, hastened to make secure both the sea and the coast against William the Norman.  \"So great a ship force, so great a land force, no king in the land had before.\"  All the summer, his fleets swept the channel; his forces \"lay everywhere by the sea.\"  But alas! now came the time when the improvident waste of Edward began to be felt.  Provisions and pay for the armaments failed [236].  On the defective resources at Harold's disposal, no modern historian hath sufficiently dwelt.  The last Saxon king, the chosen of the people, had not those levies, and could impose not those burdens which made his successors mighty in war; and men began now to think that, after all, there was no fear of this Norman invasion.  The summer was gone; the autumn was come; was it likely that William would dare to trust himself in an enemy's country as the winter drew near?  The Saxons-- unlike their fiercer kindred of Scandinavia, had no pleasure in war;-- they fought well in front of a foe, but they loathed the tedious preparations and costly sacrifices which prudence demanded for self- defence.  They now revolted from a strain upon their energies, of the necessity of which they were not convinced!  Joyous at the temporary defeat of Tostig, men said, \"Marry, a joke indeed, that the Norman will put his shaven head into the hornets' nest!  Let him come, if he dare!\"  Still, with desperate effort, and at much risk of popularity, Harold held together a force sufficient to repel any single invader.  From the time of his accession his sleepless vigilance had kept watch on the Norman, and his spies brought him news of all that passed.  And now what had passed in the councils of William?  The abrupt disappointment which the Grand Assembly had occasioned him did not last very long.  Made aware that he could not trust to the spirit of an assembly, William now artfully summoned merchant, and knight, and baron, one by one.  Submitted to the eloquence, the promises, the craft, of that master intellect, and to the awe of that imposing presence; unassisted by the courage which inferiors take from numbers, one by one yielded to the will of the Count, and subscribed his quota for monies, for ships, and for men.  And while this went on, Lanfranc was at work in the Vatican.  At that time the Archdeacon of the Roman Church was the famous Hildebrand.  This extraordinary man, fit fellow- spirit to Lanfranc, nursed one darling project, the success of which indeed founded the true temporal power of the Roman pontiffs.  It was no less than that of converting the mere religious ascendancy of the Holy See into the actual sovereignty over the states of Christendom. The most immediate agents of this gigantic scheme were the Normans, who had conquered Naples by the arm of the adventurer Robert Guiscard, and under the gonfanon of St. Peter.  Most of the new Norman countships and dukedoms thus created in Italy had declared themselves fiefs of the Church; and the successor of the Apostle might well hope, by aid of the Norman priest-knights, to extend his sovereignty over Italy, and then dictate to the kings beyond the Alps.  The aid of Hildebrand in behalf of William's claims was obtained at once by Lanfranc.  The profound Archdeacon of Rome saw at a glance the immense power that would accrue to the Church by the mere act of arrogating to itself the disposition of crowns, subjecting rival princes to abide by its decision, and fixing the men of its choice on the thrones of the North.  Despite all its slavish superstition, the Saxon Church was obnoxious to Rome.  Even the pious Edward had offended, by withholding the old levy of Peter Pence; and simony, a crime peculiarly reprobated by the pontiff, was notorious in England. Therefore there was much to aid Hildebrand in the Assembly of the Cardinals, when he brought before them the oath of Harold, the violation of the sacred relics, and demanded that the pious Normans, true friends to the Roman Church, should be permitted to Christianise the barbarous Saxons [237], and William he nominated as heir to a throne promised to him by Edward, and forfeited by the perjury of Harold.  Nevertheless, to the honour of that assembly, and of man, there was a holy opposition to this wholesale barter of human rights-- this sanction of an armed onslaught on a Christian people.  \"It is infamous,\" said the good, \"to authorise homicide.\"  But Hildebrand was all-powerful, and prevailed.  William was at high feast with his barons when Lanfranc dismounted at his gates and entered his hall.  \"Hail to thee, King of England!\" he said.  \"I bring the bull that excommunicates Harold and his adherents; I bring to thee the gift of the Roman Church, the land and royalty of England.  I bring to thee the gonfanon hallowed by the heir of the Apostle, and the very ring that contains the precious relic of the Apostle himself!  Now who will shrink from thy side?  Publish thy ban, not in Normandy alone, but in every region and realm where the Church is honoured.  This is the first war of the Cross.\"  Then indeed was it seen--that might of the Church!  Soon as were made known the sanction and gifts of the Pope, all the continent stirred as to the blast of the trump in the Crusade, of which that war was the herald.  From Maine and from Anjou, from Poitou and Bretagne, from France and from Flanders, from Aquitaine and Burgundy, flashed the spear, galloped the steed.  The robber-chiefs from the castles now grey on the Rhine; the hunters and bandits from the roots of the Alps; baron and knight, varlet and vagrant,--all came to the flag of the Church,--to the pillage of England.  For side by side with the Pope's holy bull was the martial ban:--\"Good pay and broad lands to every one who will serve Count William with spear, and with sword, and with cross-bow.\"  And the Duke said to Fitzosborne, as he parcelled out the fair fields of England into Norman fiefs:  \"Harold hath not the strength of mind to promise the least of those things that belong to me.  But I have the right to promise that which is mine, and also that which belongs to him.  He must be the victor who can give away both his own and what belongs to his foe.\" [238]  All on the continent of Europe regarded England's king as accursed-- William's enterprise as holy; and mothers who had turned pale when their sons went forth to the boar-chase, sent their darlings to enter their names, for the weal of their souls, in the swollen muster-roll of William the Norman.  Every port now in Neustria was busy with terrible life; in every wood was heard the axe felling logs for the ships; from every anvil flew the sparks from the hammer, as iron took shape into helmet and sword.  All things seemed to favour the Church's chosen one.  Conan, Count of Bretagne, sent to claim the Duchy of Normandy, as legitimate heir.  A few days afterwards, Conan died, poisoned (as had died his father before him) by the mouth of his horn and the web of his gloves.  And the new Count of Bretagne sent his sons to take part against Harold.  All the armament mustered at the roadstead of St. Valery, at the mouth of the Somme.  But the winds were long hostile, and the rains fell in torrents.     CHAPTER XI.   And now, while"]]]
