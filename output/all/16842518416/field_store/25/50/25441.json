But, looking more close, both he and Gurth were struck by the evident dismay on the King's face, while the collected light of Edward's cold eye showed that his mind was awake to the human world.  In truth, it is probable that Edward, at that moment, was recalling rash hints, if not promises, to his rapacious cousin of Normandy, made during his exile.  And, sensible of his own declining health, and the tender years of the young Edgar, he might be musing over the terrible pretender to the English throne, whose claims his earlier indiscretion might seem to sanction.  Whatever his thoughts, they were dark and sinister, as at length he said, slowly:  \"Is thine oath indeed given to thy mother, and doth she keep thee to it?\"  \"Both, O King,\" answered Harold, briefly.  \"Then I can gainsay thee not.  And thou, Harold, art a man of this living world; thou playest here the part of a centurion; thou sayst 'Come,' and men come--'Go,' and men move at thy will.  Therefore thou mayest well judge for thyself.  I gainsay thee not, nor interfere between man and his vow.  But think not,\" continued the King in a more solemn voice, and with increasing emotion, \"think not that I will charge my soul that I counselled or encouraged this errand.  Yea, I foresee that thy journey will lead but to great evil to England, and sore grief or dire loss to thee.\" [175]  \"How so, dear lord and King?\" said Harold, startled by Edward's unwonted earnestness, though deeming it but one of the visionary chimeras habitual to the saint.  \"How so?  William thy cousin hath ever borne the name of one fair to friend, though fierce to foe.  And foul indeed his dishonour, if he could meditate harm to a man trusting his faith, and sheltered by his own roof-tree.\"  \"Harold, Harold,\" said Edward, impatiently, \"I know William of old. Nor is he so simple of mind, that he will cede aught for thy pleasure, or even to my will, unless it bring some gain to himself [176].  I say no more.--Thou art cautioned, and I leave the rest to Heaven.\"  It is the misfortune of men little famous for worldly lore, that in those few occasions when, in that sagacity caused by their very freedom from the strife and passion of those around, they seem almost prophetically inspired,--it is their misfortune to lack the power of conveying to others their own convictions; they may divine, but they cannot reason: and Harold could detect nothing to deter his purpose, in a vague fear, based on no other argument than as vague a perception of the Duke's general character.  But Gurth, listening less to his reason than his devoted love for his brother, took alarm, and said, after a pause:  \"Thinkest thou, good my King, that the same danger were incurred if Gurth, instead of Harold, crossed the seas to demand the hostages?\"  \"No,\" said Edward, eagerly, \"and so would I counsel.  William would not have the same objects to gain in practising his worldly guile upon thee.  No; methinks that were the prudent course.\"  \"And the ignoble one for Harold,\" said the elder brother, almost indignantly.  \"Howbeit, I thank thee, gratefully, dear King, for thy affectionate heed and care.  And so the saints guard thee!\"  On leaving the King, a warm discussion between the brothers took place.  But Gurth's arguments were stronger than those of Harold, and the Earl was driven to rest his persistence on his own special pledge to Githa.  As soon, however, as they had gained their home, that plea was taken from him; for the moment Gurth related to his mother Edward's fears and cautions, she, ever mindful of Godwin's preference for the Earl, and his last commands to her, hastened to release Harold from his pledge; and to implore him at least to suffer Gurth to be his substitute to the Norman court.  \"Listen dispassionately,\" said Gurth; \"rely upon it that Edward has reasons for his fears, more rational than those he has given to us.  He knows William from his youth upward, and hath loved him too well to hint doubts of his good faith without just foundation.  Are there no reasons why danger from William should be special against thyself?  While the Normans abounded in the court, there were rumours that the Duke had some designs on England, which Edward's preference seemed to sanction: such designs now, in the altered state of England, were absurd--too frantic, for a prince of William's reputed wisdom to entertain.  Yet he may not unnaturally seek to regain the former Norman influence in these realms.  He knows that in you he receives the most powerful man in England; that your detention alone would convulse the country from one end of it to the other; and enable him, perhaps, to extort from Edward some measures dishonourable to us all.  But against me he can harbour no ill design --my detention would avail him nothing.  And, in truth, if Harold be safe in England, Gurth must be safe in Rouen?  Thy presence here at the head of our armies guarantees me from wrong.  But reverse the case, and with Gurth in England, is Harold safe in Rouen?  I, but a simple soldier, and homely lord, with slight influence over Edward, no command in the country, and little practised of speech in the stormy Witan,--I am just so great that William dare not harm me, but not so great that he should even wish to harm me.\"  \"He detains our kinsmen, why not thee!\" said Harold.  \"Because with our kinsmen he has at least the pretext that they were pledged as hostages: because I go simply as guest and envoy.  No, to me danger cannot come.  Be ruled, dear Harold.\"  \"Be ruled, O my son,\" cried Githa, clasping the Earl's knees, \"and do not let me dread in the depth of the night to see the shade of Godwin, and hear his voice say, 'Woman, where is Harold?'\"  It was impossible for the Earl's strong understanding to resist the arguments addressed to it; and, to say truth, he had been more disturbed that he liked to confess by Edward's sinister forewarnings. Yet, on the other hand, there were reasons against his acquiescence in Gurth's proposal.  The primary, and, to do him justice, the strongest, was in his native courage and his generous pride.  Should he for the first time in his life shrink from a peril in the discharge of his duty; a peril, too, so uncertain and vague?  Should he suffer Gurth to fulfil the pledge he himself had taken?  And granting even that Gurth were safe from whatever danger he individually might incur, did it become him to accept the proxy?  Would Gurth's voice, too, be as potent as his own in effecting the return of the hostages?  The next reasons that swayed him were those he could not avow.  In clearing his way to the English throne, it would be of no mean importance to secure the friendship of the Norman Duke, and the Norman acquiescence in his pretensions; it would be of infinite service to remove those prepossessions against his House, which were still rife with the Normans, who retained a bitter remembrance of their countrymen decimated [177], it was said, with the concurrence if not at the order of Godwin, when they accompanied the ill-fated Alfred to the English shore, and who were yet sore with their old expulsion from the English court at the return of his father and himself.  Though it could not enter into his head that William, possessing no party whatever in England, could himself aspire to the English crown, yet at Edward's death, there might be pretenders whom the Norman arms could find ready excuse to sanction.  There was the boy Atheling, on the one side, there was the valiant Norwegian King Hardrada on the other, who might revive the claims of his predecessor Magnus as heir to the rights of Canute.  So near and so formidable a neighbour as the Court of the Normans, every object of policy led him to propitiate; and Gurth, with his unbending hate of all that was Norman, was not, at least, the most politic envoy he could select for that end.  Add to this, that despite their present reconciliation, Harold could never long count upon amity with Tostig: and Tostig's connection with William, through their marriages into the House of Baldwin, was full of danger to a new throne, to which Tostig would probably be the most turbulent subject: the influence of this connection how desirable to counteract! [178]  Nor could Harold, who, as patriot and statesman, felt deeply the necessity of reform and regeneration in the decayed edifice of the English monarchy, willingly lose an occasion to witness all that William had done to raise so high in renown and civilisation, in martial fame and commercial prosperity, that petty duchy, which he had placed on a level with the kingdoms of the Teuton and the Frank. Lastly, the Normans were the special darlings of the Roman Church. William had obtained the dispensation to his own marriage with Matilda; and might not the Norman influence, duly conciliated, back the prayer which Harold trusted one day to address to the pontiff, and secure to him the hallowed blessing, without which ambition lost its charm, and even a throne its splendour?  All these considerations, therefore, urged the Earl to persist in his original purpose: but a warning voice in his heart, more powerful than all, sided with the prayer of Githa, and the arguments of Gurth.  In this state of irresolution, Gurth said seasonably:  \"Bethink thee, Harold, if menaced but with peril to thyself, thou wouldst have a brave man's right to resist us; but it was of 'great evil to England' that Edward spoke, and thy reflection must tell thee, that in this crisis of our country, danger to thee is evil to England --evil to England thou hast no right to incur.\"  \"Dear mother, and generous Gurth,\" said Harold, then joining the two in one embrace, \"ye have well nigh conquered.  Give me but two days to ponder well, and be assured that I will not decide from the rash promptings of an ill-considered"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7679"],["title","Harold : the Last of the Saxon Kings â€” Volume 08 (#3)"],["body","udgment.\"  Farther than this they could not then move the Earl; but Gurth was pleased shortly afterwards to see him depart to Edith, whose fears, from whatever source they sprang, would, he was certain, come in aid of his own pleadings.  But as the Earl rode alone towards the once stately home of the perished Roman, and entered at twilight the darkening forest-land, his thoughts were less on Edith than on the Vala, with whom his ambition had more and more connected his soul.  Perplexed by his doubts, and left dim in the waning lights of human reason, never more involuntarily did he fly to some guide to interpret the future, and decide his path.  As if fate itself responded to the cry of his heart, he suddenly came in sight of Hilda herself, gathering leaves from elm and ash amidst the woodland.  He sprang from his horse and approached her.  \"Hilda,\" said he, in a low but firm voice, \"thou hast often told me that the dead can advise the living.  Raise thou the Scin-laeca of the hero of old--raise the Ghost, which mine eye, or my fancy, beheld before, vast and dim by the silent bautastein, and I will stand by thy side.  Fain would I know if thou hast deceived me and thyself; or if, in truth, to man's guidance Heaven doth vouchsafe saga and rede from those who have passed into the secret shores of Eternity.\"  \"The dead,\" answered Hilda, \"will not reveal themselves to eyes uninitiate save at their own will, uncompelled by charm and rune.  To me their forms can appear distinct through the airy flame; to me, duly prepared by spells that purge the eye of the spirit, and loosen the walls of the flesh.  I cannot say that what I see in the trance and the travail of my soul, thou also wilt behold; or even when the vision hath passed from my sight, and the voice from my ear, only memories, confused and dim, of what I saw and heard, remain to guide the waking and common life.  But thou shalt stand by my side while I invoke the phantom, and hear and interpret the words which rush from my lips, and the runes that take meaning from the sparks of the charmed fire.  I knew ere thou camest, by the darkness and trouble of Edith's soul, that some shade from the Ash-tree of Life had fallen upon thine.\"  Then Harold related what had passed, and placed before Hilda the doubts that beset him.  The Prophetess listened with earnest attention; but her mind, when not under its more mystic influences, being strongly biassed by its natural courage and ambition, she saw at a glance all the advantages towards securing the throne predestined to Harold, which might be effected by his visit to the Norman court, and she held in too great disdain both the worldly sense and the mystic reveries of the monkish king (for the believer in Odin was naturally incredulous of the visitation of the Christian saints) to attach much weight to his dreary predictions.  The short reply she made was therefore not calculated to deter Harold from the expedition in dispute.  But she deferred till the following night, and to wisdom more dread than her own, the counsels that should sway his decision.  With a strange satisfaction at the thought that he should, at least, test personally the reality of those assumptions of preternatural power which had of late coloured his resolves and oppressed his heart, Harold then took leave of the Vala, who returned mechanically to her employment; and, leading his horse by the reins, lowly continued his musing way towards the green knoll and its heathen ruins.  But ere he gained the hillock, and while his thoughtful eyes were bent on the ground, he felt his arm seized tenderly--turned--and beheld Edith's face full of unutterable and anxious love.  With that love, indeed, there was blended so much wistfulness, so much fear, that Harold exclaimed:  \"Soul of my soul, what hath chanced? what affects thee thus?\"  \"Hath no danger befallen thee?\" asked Edith falteringly, and gazing on his face with wistful, searching eyes.  \"Danger! none, sweet trembler,\" answered the Earl, evasively.  Edith dropped her eager looks, and clinging to his arm, drew him on silently into the forest land.  She paused at last where the old fantastic trees shut out the view of the ancient ruins; and when, looking round, she saw not those grey gigantic shafts which mortal hand seemed never to have piled together, she breathed more freely.  \"Speak to me,\" then said Harold, bending his face to hers; \"why this silence?\"  \"Ah, Harold!\" answered his betrothed, \"thou knowest that ever since we have loved one another, my existence hath been but a shadow of thine; by some weird and strange mystery, which Hilda would explain by the stars or the fates, that have made me a part of thee, I know by the lightness or gloom of my own spirit when good or ill shall befall thee.  How often, in thine absence, hath a joy suddenly broke upon me; and I felt by that joy, as by the smile of a good angel, that thou hast passed safe through some peril, or triumphed over some foe!  And now thou askest me why I am so sad;--I can only answer thee by saying, that the sadness is cast upon me by some thunder gloom on thine own destiny.\"  Harold had sought Edith to speak of his meditated journey, but seeing her dejection he did not dare; so he drew her to his breast, and chid her soothingly for her vain apprehensions.  But Edith would not be comforted; there seemed something weighing on her mind and struggling to her lips, not accounted for merely by sympathetic forebodings; and at length, as he pressed her to tell all, she gathered courage and spoke:  \"Do not mock me,\" she said, \"but what secret, whether of vain folly or of meaning fate, should I hold from thee?  All this day I struggled in vain against the heaviness of my forebodings.  How I hailed the sight of Gurth thy brother!  I besought him to seek thee--thou hast seen him.\"  \"I have!\" said Harold.  \"But thou wert about to tell me of something more than this dejection.\"  \"Well,\" resumed Edith, \"after Gurth left me, my feet sought involuntarily the hill on which we have met so often.  I sate down near the old tomb, a strange weariness crept on my eyes, and a sleep that seemed not wholly sleep fell over me.  I struggled against it, as if conscious of some coming terror; and as I struggled, and ere I slept, Harold,--yes, ere I slept,--I saw distinctly a pale and glimmering figure rise from the Saxon's grave.  I saw--I see it still! Oh, that livid front, those glassy eyes!\"  \"The figure of a warrior?\" said Harold, startled.  \"Of a warrior, armed as in the ancient days, armed like the warrior that Hilda's maids are working for thy banner.  I saw it; and in one hand it held a spear, and in the other a crown.\"  \"A crown!--Say on, say on.\"  \"I saw no more; sleep, in spite of myself, fell on me, a sleep full of confused and painful--rapid and shapeless images, still at last this dream rose clear.  I beheld a bright and starry shape, that seemed as a spirit, yet wore thine aspect, standing on a rock; and an angry torrent rolled between the rock and the dry safe land.  The waves began to invade the rock, and the spirit unfurled its wings as to flee.  And then foul things climbed up from the slime of the rock, and descended from the mists of the troubled skies, and they coiled round the wings and clogged them.\"  \"Then a voice cried in my ear,--'Seest thou not on the perilous rock the Soul of Harold the Brave?--seest thou not that the waters engulf it, if the wings fail to flee?  Up, Truth, whose strength is in purity, whose image is woman, and aid the soul of the brave!'  I sought to spring to thy side; but I was powerless, and behold, close beside me, through my sleep as through a veil, appeared the shafts of the ruined temple in which I lay reclined.  And, methought, I saw Hilda sitting alone by the Saxon's grave, and pouring from a crystal vessel black drops into a human heart which she held in her hands: and out of that heart grew a child, and out of that child a youth, with dark mournful brow.  And the youth stood by thy side and whispered to thee: and from his lips there came a reeking smoke, and in that smoke as in a blight the wings withered up.  And I heard the Voice say, 'Hilda, it is thou that hast destroyed the good angel, and reared from the poisoned heart the loathsome tempter!'  And I cried aloud, but it was too late; the waves swept over thee, and above the waves there floated an iron helmet, and on the helmet was a golden crown--the crown I had seen in the hand of the spectre!\"  \"But this is no evil dream, my Edith,\" said Harold, gaily.  Edith, unheeding him, continued:  \"I started from my sleep.  The sun was still high--the air lulled and windless.  Then through the shafts and down the hill there glided in that clear waking daylight, a grisly shape like that which I have heard our maidens say the witch-hags, sometimes seen in the forest, assume; yet in truth, it seemed neither of man nor woman.  It turned its face once towards me, and on that hideous face were the glee and hate of a triumphant fiend.  Oh, Harold, what should all this portend?\"  \"Hast thou not asked thy kinswoman, the diviner of dreams?\"  \"I asked Hilda, and she, like thee, only murmured, 'The Saxon crown!' But if there be faith in those airy children of the night, surely, O adored one, the vision forebodes danger, not to life, but to soul; and the words I heard seemed to say that thy wings were thy valour, and the Fylgia thou hadst lost was,--no, that were impossible--\"  \"That my Fylgia was TRUTH, which losing, I were indeed lost to thee. Thou dost well,\" said Harold, loftily, \"to hold that among the lies of the fancy.  All else may, perchance, desert me, but never mine own free soul.  Self-reliant hath Hilda called me in mine earlier days, and wherever fate casts me,--in my truth, and my love, and my dauntless heart, I dare both man and the fiend.\"  Edith gazed a moment in devout admiration on the mien of her hero- lover, then she drew closer and closer to his breast,"]]]
