The tea was made, the cabbage and potatoes strained and placed in a billy near the fire. He found the fried bacon and steak between two plates in the camp-oven. He sat down to the table but he could not eat. He felt mean. The inexperience and hasty temper of his brother had caused the quarrel between them that morning; but then Jack admitted that, and apologized when he first tried to make it up.  Tom moved round uneasily and tried to smoke: he could not get Jack's last appeal out of his ears--“You ain't going to let the sun go down, Tom?”  Tom found himself glancing at the sun. It was less than two hours from sunset. He thought of the words of the old Hebrew--or Chinese--poet; he wasn't religious, and the authorship didn't matter. The old poet's words began to haunt him “Let not the sun go down upon your wrath--Let not the sun go down upon your wrath.”  The line contains good, sound advice; for quick-tempered men are often the most sensitive, and when they let the sun go down on the aforesaid wrath that quality is likely to get them down and worry them during the night.  Tom started to go to the claim, but checked himself, and sat down and tried to draw comfort from his pipe. He understood his brother thoroughly, but his brother never understood him--that was where the trouble was. Presently he got thinking how Jack would worry about the quarrel and have no heart for his work. Perhaps he was fretting over it now, all alone by himself, down at the end of the damp, dark drive. Tom had a lot of the old woman about him, in spite of his unsociable ways and brooding temper.  He had almost made up his mind to go below again, on some excuse, when his mate shouted from the top of the shaft:  “Tom! Tom! For Christ's sake come here!”  Tom's heart gave a great thump, and he ran like a kangaroo to the shaft. All the diggers within hearing were soon on the spot. They saw at a glance what had happened. It was madness to sink without timber in such treacherous ground. _The sides of the shaft were closing in_. Tom sprang forward and shouted through the crevice:  “To the face, Jack! To the face, for your life!”  “The old Workings!” he cried, turning to the diggers. “Bring a fan and tools. We'll dig him out.”  A few minutes later a fan was rigged over a deserted shaft close by, where fortunately the windlass had been left for bailing purposes, and men were down in the old drive. Tom knew that he and his mates had driven very close to the old workings.  He knelt in the damp clay before the face and worked like a madman; he refused to take turn about, and only dropped the pick to seize a shovel in his strong hands, and snatch back the loose clay from under his feet; he reckoned that he had six or, perhaps, eight feet to drive, and he knew that the air could not last long in the new drive--even if that had not already fallen in and crushed his brother. Great drops of perspiration stood out on Tom's forehead, and his breath began to come in choking sobs, but he still struck strong, savage blows into the clay before him, and the drive lengthened quickly. Once he paused a moment to listen, and then distinctly heard a sound as of a tool or stone being struck against the end of the new drive. Jack was safe!  Tom dug on until the clay suddenly fell away from his pick and left a hole, about the size of a plate, in the “face” before him. “Thank God!”  said a hoarse, strained voice at the other side.  “All right, Jack!”  “Yes, old man; you are just in time; I've hardly got room to stand in, and I'm nearly smothered.” He was crouching against the “face” of the new drive.  Tom dropped his pick and fell back against the man behind him.  “Oh, God! my back!” he cried.  Suddenly he struggled to his knees, and then fell forward on his hand and dragged himself close to the hole in the end of the drive.  “Jack!” he gasped, “Jack!”  “Right, old man; what's the matter?”  “I've hurt my heart, Jack!--Put your hand--quick!... The sun's going down.”  Jack's hand came out through the hole, Tom gripped it, and then fell with his face in the damp clay.  They half carried, half dragged him from the drive, for the roof was low and they were obliged to stoop. They took him to the shaft and sent him up, lashed to the rope.  A few blows of the pick, and Jack scrambled from his prison and went to the surface, and knelt on the grass by the body of his brother. The diggers gathered round and took off their hats. And the sun went down.    THE MAN WHO FORGOT   “Well, I dunno,” said Tom Marshall--known as “The Oracle”--“I've heerd o' sich cases before: they ain't commin, but--I've heerd o' sich cases before,” and he screwed up the left side of his face whilst he reflectively scraped his capacious right ear with the large blade of a pocket-knife.  They were sitting at the western end of the rouseabouts' hut, enjoying the breeze that came up when the sun went down, and smoking and yarning. The “case” in question was a wretchedly forlorn-looking specimen of the swag-carrying clan whom a boundary-rider had found wandering about the adjacent plain, and had brought into the station. He was a small, scraggy man, painfully fair, with a big, baby-like head, vacant watery eyes, long thin hairy hands, that felt like pieces of damp seaweed, and an apologetic cringe-and-look-up-at-you manner. He professed to have forgotten who he was and all about himself.  The Oracle was deeply interested in this case, as indeed he was in anything else that “looked curious.” He was a big, simple-minded shearer, with more heart than brains, more experience than sense, and more curiosity than either. It was a wonder that he had not profited, even indirectly, by the last characteristic. His heart was filled with a kind of reverential pity for anyone who was fortunate or unfortunate enough to possess an “affliction;” and amongst his mates had been counted a deaf man, a blind man, a poet, and a man who “had rats.” Tom had dropped across them individually, when they were down in the world, and had befriended them, and studied them with great interest--especially the poet; and they thought kindly of him, and were grateful--except the individual with the rats, who reckoned Tom had an axe to grind--that he, in fact, wanted to cut his (Rat's) liver out as a bait for Darling cod--and so renounced the mateship.  It was natural, then, for The Oracle to take the present case under his wing. He used his influence with the boss to get the Mystery on “picking up,” and studied him in spare time, and did his best to assist the poor hushed memory, which nothing the men could say or do seemed able to push further back than the day on which the stranger “kind o' woke up” on the plain, and found a swag beside him. The swag had been prospected and fossicked for a clue, but yielded none. The chaps were sceptical at first, and inclined to make fun of the Mystery; but Tom interfered, and intimated that if they were skunks enough to chyack or try on any of their “funny business” with a “pore afflicted chap,” he (Tom) would be obliged to “perform.” Most of the men there had witnessed Tom's performance, and no one seemed ambitious to take a leading part in it. They preferred to be in the audience.  “Yes,” reflected The Oracle, “it's a curious case, and I dare say some of them big doctors, like Morell Mackenzie, would be glad to give a thousand or two to get holt on a case like this.”  “Done,” cried Mitchell, the goat of the shed. “I'll go halves!--or stay, let's form a syndicate and work the Mystery.”  Some of the rouseabouts laughed, but the joke fell as flat with Tom as any other joke.  “The worst of it is,” said the Mystery himself, in the whine that was natural to him, and with a timid side look up at Tom--“the worst of it is I might be a lord or duke, and don't know anything about it. I might be a rich man, with a lot of houses and money. I might be a lord.”  The chaps guffawed.  “Wot'yer laughing at?” asked Mitchell. “I don't see anything unreasonable about it; he might be a lord as far as looks go. I've seen two.”  “Yes,” reflected Tom, ignoring Mitchell, “there's something in that; but then again, you see, you might be Jack the Ripper. Better let it slide, mate; let the dead past bury its dead. Start fresh with a clean sheet.”  “But I don't even know my name, or whether I'm married or not,” whined the outcast. “I might have a good wife and little ones.”  “Better keep on forgetting, mate,” Mitchell said, “and as for a name, that's nothing. I don't know mine, and I've had eight. There's plenty good names knocking round. I knew a man named Jim Smith that died. Take his name, it just suits you, and he ain't likely to call round for it; if he does, you can say you was born with it.”  So they called him Smith, and soon began to regard him as a harmless lunatic and to take no notice of his eccentricities. Great interest was taken in the case for a time, and even Mitchell put in his oar and tried all sorts of ways to assist the Mystery in his weak, helpless, and almost pitiful endeavours to recollect who he was. A similar case happened to appear in the papers at this time, and the thing caught on to such an extent that The Oracle was moved to impart some advice from his store of wisdom.  “I wouldn't think too much over it if I was you,” said he to Mitchell, “hundreds of sensible men went mad over that there Tichborne case who didn't have anything to do with it, but just through thinking on it; and you're ratty enough already, Jack. Let it alone and trust me to find out who's Smith just as soon as ever we cut out.”  Meanwhile Smith ate, worked, and slept, and borrowed tobacco and forgot to return it--which was made a note of. He talked freely about his case when asked, but if he addressed anyone, it was with the air of the timid but good young man, who is fully aware of the extent and power of this world's wickedness, and stands somewhat in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7144"],["title","While the Billy Boils (#5)"],["body","of it, but yet would beg you to favour a humble worker in the vineyard by kindly accepting a tract, and passing it on to friends after perusal.   One Saturday morning, about a fortnight before cut out, The Oracle came late to his stand, and apparently with something on his mind. Smith hadn't turned up, and the next rouseabout was doing his work, to the mutual dissatisfaction of all parties immediately concerned.  “Did you see anything of Smith?” asked Mitchell of The Oracle. “Seems to have forgot to get up this morning.”  Tom looked disheartened and disappointed. _“He's forgot again_,” said he, slowly and impressively.  “Forgot what? We know he's blessed well forgot to come to graft.”  “He's forgot again,” repeated Tom. “He woke up this morning and wanted to know who he was and where he was.” Comments.  “Better give him best, Oracle,” said Mitchell presently. “If he can't find out who he is and where he is, the boss'll soon find it out for him.”  “No,” said Tom, “when I take a thing in hand I see it through.”  This was also characteristic of the boss-over-the-board, though in another direction. He went down to the but and inquired for Smith.  “Why ain't you at work?”  “Who am I, sir? Where am I?” whined Smith. “Can you please tell me who I am and where I am?”  The boss drew a long breath and stared blankly at the Mystery; then he erupted.  “Now, look here!” he howled, “I don't know who the gory sheol you are, except that you're a gory lunatic, and what's more, I don't care a damn. But I'll soon show you where you are! You can call up at the store and get your cheque, and soon as you blessed well like; and then take a walk, and don't forget to take your lovely swag with you.”  The matter was discussed at the dinner-table. The Oracle swore that it was a cruel, mean way to treat a “pore afflicted chap,” and cursed the boss. Tom's admirers cursed in sympathy, and trouble seemed threatening, when the voice of Mitchell was heard to rise in slow, deliberate tones over the clatter of cutlery and tin plates.  “I wonder,” said the voice, “I wonder whether Smith forgot his cheque?”  It was ascertained that Smith hadn't.  There was some eating and thinking done. Soon Mitchell's voice was heard again, directed at The Oracle.  It said “Do you keep any vallabels about your bunk, Oracle?”  Tom looked hard at Mitchell. “Why?”  “Oh, nothin': only I think it wouldn't be a bad idea for you to look at your bunk and see whether Smith forgot.”  The chaps grew awfully interested. They fixed their eyes on Tom, and he looked with feeling from one face to another; then he pushed his plate back, and slowly extracted his long legs from between the stool and the table. He climbed to his bunk, and carefully reviewed the ingredients of his swag. Smith hadn't forgot.  When The Oracle's face came round again there was in it a strange expression which a close study would have revealed to be more of anger than of sorrow, but that was not all. It was an expression such as a man might wear who is undergoing a terrible operation, without chloroform, but is determined not to let a whimper escape him. Tom didn't swear, and by that token they guessed how mad he was. 'Twas a rough shed, with a free and lurid vocabulary, but had they all sworn in chorus, with One-eyed Bogan as lead, it would not have done justice to Tom's feelings--and they realized this.  The Oracle took down his bridle from its peg, and started for the door amid a respectful and sympathetic silence, which was only partly broken once by the voice of Mitchell, which asked in an awed whisper:  “Going ter ketch yer horse, Tom?” The Oracle nodded, and passed on; he spake no word--he was too full for words.  Five minutes passed, and then the voice of Mitchell was heard again, uninterrupted by the clatter of tinware. It said in impressive tones:  “It would not be a bad idea for some of you chaps that camp in the bunks along there, to have a look at your things. Scotty's bunk is next to Tom's.”  Scotty shot out of his place as if a snake had hold of his leg, starting a plank in the table and upsetting three soup plates. He reached for his bunk like a drowning man clutching at a plank, and tore out the bedding. Again, Smith hadn't forgot.  Then followed a general overhaul, and it was found in most cases that Smith had remembered. The pent-up reservoir of blasphemy burst forth.  The Oracle came up with Smith that night at the nearest shanty, and found that he had forgotten again, and in several instances, and was forgetting some more under the influence of rum and of the flattering interest taken in his case by a drunken Bachelor of Arts who happened to be at the pub. Tom came in quietly from the rear, and crooked his finger at the shanty-keeper. They went apart from the rest, and talked together a while very earnestly. Then they secretly examined Smith's swag, the core of which was composed of Tom's and his mate's valuables.  Then The Oracle stirred up Smith's recollections and departed.  Smith was about again in a couple of weeks. He was damaged somewhat physically, but his memory was no longer impaired.    HUNGERFORD   One of the hungriest cleared roads in New South Wales runs to within a couple of miles of Hungerford, and stops there; then you strike through the scrub to the town. There is no distant prospect of Hungerford--you don't see the town till you are quite close to it, and then two or three white-washed galvanized-iron roofs start out of the mulga.  They say that a past Ministry commenced to clear the road from Bourke, under the impression that Hungerford was an important place, and went on, with the blindness peculiar to governments, till they got to within two miles of the town. Then they ran short of rum and rations, and sent a man on to get them, and make inquiries. The member never came back, and two more were sent to find him--or Hungerford. Three days later the two returned in an exhausted condition, and submitted a motion of want-of-confidence, which was lost. Then the whole House went on and was lost also. Strange to relate, that Government was never missed.  However, we found Hungerford and camped there for a day. The town is right on the Queensland border, and an interprovincial rabbit-proof fence--with rabbits on both sides of it--runs across the main street.  This fence is a standing joke with Australian rabbits--about the only joke they have out there, except the memory of Pasteur and poison and inoculation. It is amusing to go a little way out of town, about sunset, and watch them crack Noah's Ark rabbit jokes about that fence, and burrow under and play leap-frog over it till they get tired. One old buck rabbit sat up and nearly laughed his ears off at a joke of his own about that fence. He laughed so much that he couldn't get away when I reached for him. I could hardly eat him for laughing. I never saw a rabbit laugh before; but I've seen a 'possum do it.  Hungerford consists of two houses and a humpy in New South Wales, and five houses in Queensland. Characteristically enough, both the pubs are in Queensland. We got a glass of sour yeast at one and paid sixpence for it--we had asked for English ale.  The post office is in New South Wales, and the police-barracks in Bananaland. The police cannot do anything if there's a row going on across the street in New South Wales, except to send to Brisbane and have an extradition warrant applied for; and they don't do much if there's a row in Queensland. Most of the rows are across the border, where the pubs are.  At least, I believe that's how it is, though the man who told me might have been a liar. Another man said he was a liar, but then _he_ might have been a liar himself--a third person said he was one. I heard that there was a fight over it, but the man who told me about the fight might not have been telling the truth.  One part of the town swears at Brisbane when things go wrong, and the other part curses Sydney.  The country looks as though a great ash-heap had been spread out there, and mulga scrub and firewood planted--and neglected. The country looks just as bad for a hundred miles round Hungerford, and beyond that it gets worse--a blasted, barren wilderness that doesn't even howl. If it howled it would be a relief.  I believe that Bourke and Wills found Hungerford, and it's a pity they did; but, if I ever stand by the graves of the men who first travelled through this country, when there were neither roads nor stations, nor tanks, nor bores, nor pubs, I'll--I'll take my hat off. There were brave men in the land in those days.  It is said that the explorers gave the district its name chiefly because of the hunger they found there, which has remained there ever since. I don't know where the “ford” comes in--there's nothing to ford, except in flood-time. Hungerthirst would have been better. The town is supposed to be situated on the banks of a river called the Paroo, but we saw no water there, except what passed for it in a tank. The goats and sheep and dogs and the rest of the population drink there. It is dangerous to take too much of that water in a raw state.  Except in flood-time you couldn't find the bed of the river without the aid of a spirit-level and a long straight-edge. There is a Custom-house against the fence on the northern side. A pound of tea often costs six shillings on that side, and you can get a common lead pencil for fourpence at the rival store across the street in the mother province. Also, a small loaf of sour bread sells for a shilling at the humpy aforementioned. Only about sixty per cent of the sugar will melt.  We saw one of the storekeepers give a dead-beat swagman five shillings' worth of rations to take him on into Queensland. The storekeepers often do this, and put it down on the loss side of their books. I hope the recording angel listens, and puts it down on the right side of his book.  We camped on the Queensland side of the fence, and after tea had a yarn with an old man who"]]]
