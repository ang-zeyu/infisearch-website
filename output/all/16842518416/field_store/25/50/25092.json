Believe me,                                    _Your well-wisher,                                    David Ossian Macrae._  The enclosure bore this inscription:         CHARLES FERMIN, ESQ.,        Offices of the _Orb_,        Strand,        London.  I had received the letter at breakfast. I took a cab, and drove straight to the _Orb_.  A painted hand, marked \"Editorial,\" indicated a flight of stairs. At the top of these I was confronted by a glass door, beyond which, entrenched behind a desk, sat a cynical-looking youth. A smaller boy in the background talked into a telephone. Both were giggling. On seeing me the slightly larger of the two advanced with a half-hearted attempt at solemnity, though unable to resist a Parthian shaft at his companion, who was seized on the instant with a paroxysm of suppressed hysteria.  My letter was taken down a mysterious stone passage. After some waiting the messenger returned with the request that I would come back at eleven, as Mr. Fermin would be very busy till then.  I went out into the Strand, and sought a neighbouring hostelry. It was essential that I should be brilliant at the coming interview, if only spirituously brilliant; and I wished to remove a sensation of stomachic emptiness, such as I had been wont to feel at school when approaching the headmaster's study.  At eleven I returned, and asked again for Mr. Fermin; and presently he appeared--a tall, thin man, who gave one the impression of being in a hurry. I knew him by reputation as a famous quarter-miler. He had been president of the O.U.A.C. some years back. He looked as if at any moment he might dash off in any direction at quarter-mile pace.  We shook hands, and I tried to look intelligent.  \"Sorry to have to keep you waiting,\" he said, as we walked to his club; \"but we are always rather busy between ten and eleven, putting the column through. Gresham and I do 'On Your Way,' you know. The last copy has to be down by half-past ten.\"  We arrived at the Club, and sat in a corner of the lower smoking-room.  \"Macrae says that you are going in for writing. Of course, I'll do anything I can, but it isn't easy to help a man. As it happens, though, I can put you in the way of something, if it's your style of work. Do you ever do verse?\"  I felt like a batsman who sees a slow full-toss sailing through the air.  \"It's the only thing I can get taken,\" I said. \"I've had quite a lot in the _Chronicle_ and occasional bits in other papers.\"  He seemed relieved.  \"Oh, that's all right, then,\" he said. \"You know 'On Your Way.' Perhaps you'd care to come in and do that for a bit? It's only holiday work, but it'll last five weeks. And if you do it all right I can get you the whole of the holiday work on the column. That comes to a good lot in the year. We're always taking odd days off. Can you come up at a moment's notice?\"  \"Easily,\" I said.  \"Then, you see, if you did that you would drop into the next vacancy on the column. There's no saying when one may occur. It's like the General Election. It may happen tomorrow, or not for years. Still, you'd be on the spot in case.\"  \"It's awfully good of you.\"  \"Not at all. As a matter of fact, I was rather in difficulties about getting a holiday man. I'm off to Scotland the day after tomorrow, and I had to find a sub. Well, then, will you come in on Monday?\"  \"All right.\"  \"You've had no experience of newspaper work, have you?\"  \"No.\"  \"Well, all the work at the _Orb's_ done between nine and eleven. You must be there at nine sharp. Literally sharp, I mean. Not half-past. And you'd better do some stuff overnight for the first week or so. You'll find working in the office difficult till you get used to it. Of course, though, you'll always have Gresham there, so there's no need to get worried. He can fill the column himself, if he's pushed. Four or five really good paragraphs a day and an occasional set of verses are all he'll want from you.\"  \"I see.\"  \"On Monday, then. Nine sharp. Good-bye.\"  I walked home along Piccadilly with almost a cake-walk stride. At last I was in the inner circle.  An _Orb_ cart passed me. I nodded cheerfully to the driver. He was one of _Us_.     Chapter 4  JULIAN EVERSLEIGH _(James Orlebar Cloyster's narrative continued)_   I determined to celebrate the occasion by dining out, going to a theatre, and having supper afterwards, none of which things were ordinarily within my means. I had not been to a theatre since I had arrived in town; and, except on Saturday nights, I always cooked my own dinner, a process which was cheap, and which appealed to the passion for Bohemianism which I had not wholly cast out of me.  The morning paper informed me that there were eleven musical comedies, three Shakespeare plays, a blank verse drama, and two comedies (\"last weeks\") for me to choose from. I bought a stall at the Briggs Theatre. Stanley Briggs, who afterwards came to bulk large in my small world, was playing there in a musical comedy which had had even more than the customary musical-comedy success.  London by night had always had an immense fascination for me. Coming out of the restaurant after supper, I felt no inclination to return to my lodgings, and end the greatest night of my life tamely with a book and a pipe. Here was I, a young man, fortified by an excellent supper, in the heart of Stevenson's London. Why should I have no New Arabian Night adventure? I would stroll about for half an hour, and give London a chance of living up to its reputation.  I walked slowly along Piccadilly, and turned up Rupert Street. A magic name. Prince Florizel of Bohemia had ended his days there in his tobacconist's divan. Mr. Gilbert's Policeman Forth had been discovered there by the men of London at the end of his long wanderings through Soho. Probably, if the truth were known, Rudolf Rassendyl had spent part of his time there. It could not be that Rupert Street would send me empty away.  My confidence was not abused. Turning into Rupert Court, a dark and suggestive passage some short distance up the street on the right, I found a curious little comedy being played.  A door gave on to the deserted passageway, and on each side of it stood a man--the lurcher type of man that is bred of London streets. The door opened inwards. Another man stepped out. The hands of one of the lurchers flew to the newcomer's mouth. The hands of the other lurcher flew to the newcomer's pockets.  At that moment I advanced.  The lurchers vanished noiselessly and instantaneously.  Their victim held out his hand.  \"Come in, won't you?\" he said, smiling sleepily at me.  I followed him in, murmuring something about \"caught in the act.\"  He repeated the phrase as we went upstairs.  \"'Caught in the act.' Yes, they are ingenious creatures. Let me introduce myself. My name is Julian Eversleigh. Sit down, won't you? Excuse me for a moment.\"  He crossed to a writing-table.  Julian Eversleigh inhabited a single room of irregular shape. It was small, and situated immediately under the roof. One side had a window which overlooked Rupert Court. The view from it was, however, restricted, because the window was inset, so that the walls projecting on either side prevented one seeing more than a yard or two of the court.  The room contained a hammock, a large tin bath, propped up against the wall, a big wardrobe, a couple of bookcases, a deal writing-table--at which the proprietor was now sitting with a pen in his mouth, gazing at the ceiling--and a divan-like formation of rugs and cube sugar boxes.  The owner of this mixed lot of furniture wore a very faded blue serge suit, the trousers baggy at the knees and the coat threadbare at the elbows. He had the odd expression which green eyes combined with red hair give a man.  \"Caught in the act,\" he was murmuring. \"Caught in the act.\"  The phrase seemed to fascinate him.  I had established myself on the divan, and was puffing at a cigar, which I had bought by way of setting the coping-stone on my night's extravagance, before he got up from his writing.  \"Those fellows,\" he said, producing a bottle of whisky and a syphon from one of the lower drawers of the wardrobe, \"did me a double service. They introduced me to you--say when--and they gave me----\"  \"When.\"  \"--an idea.\"  \"But how did it happen?\" I asked.  \"Quite simple,\" he answered. \"You see, my friends, when they call on me late at night, can't get in by knocking at the front door. It is a shop-door, and is locked early. Vancott, my landlord, is a baker, and, as he has to be up making muffins somewhere about five in the morning--we all have our troubles--he does not stop up late. So people who want me go into the court, and see whether my lamp is burning by the window. If it is, they stand below and shout, 'Julian,' till I open the door into the court. That's what happened tonight. I heard my name called, went down, and walked into the arms of the enterprising gentlemen whom you chanced to notice. They must have been very hungry, for even if they had carried the job through they could not have expected to make their fortunes. In point of fact, they would have cleared one-and-threepence. But when you're hungry you can see no further than the pit of your stomach. Do you know, I almost sympathise with the poor brutes. People sometimes say to me, 'What are you?' I have often half a mind to reply, 'I have been hungry.' My stars, be hungry once, and you're educated, if you don't die of it, for a lifetime.\"  This sort of talk from a stranger might have been the prelude to an appeal for financial assistance.  He dissipated that half-born thought.  \"Don't be uneasy,\" he said; \"you have not been lured up here by the ruse of a clever borrower. I can do a bit of touching when in the mood, mind you, but you're safe. You are here because I see that you are a pleasant fellow.\"  \"Thank you,\" I said.  \"Besides,\" he continued, \"I am not hungry"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7230"],["title","Not George Washington — an Autobiographical Novel (#7)"],["body"," present. In fact, I shall never be hungry again.\"  \"You're lucky,\" I remarked.  \"I am. I am the fortunate possessor of the knack of writing advertisements.\"  \"Indeed,\" I said, feeling awkward, for I saw that I ought to be impressed.  \"Ah!\" he said, laughing outright. \"You're not impressed in the least, really. But I'll ask you to consider what advertisements mean. First, they are the life-essence of every newspaper, every periodical, and every book.\"  \"Every book?\"  \"Practically, yes. Most books contain some latent support of a fashion in clothes or food or drink, or of some pleasant spot or phase of benevolence or vice, all of which form the interest of one or other of the sections of society, which sections require publicity at all costs for their respective interests.\"  I was about to probe searchingly into so optimistic a view of modern authorship, but he stalled me off by proceeding rapidly with his discourse.  \"Apart, however, from the less obvious modes of advertising, you'll agree that this is the age of all ages for the man who can write puffs. 'Good wine needs no bush' has become a trade paradox, 'Judge by appearances,' a commercial platitude. The man who is ambitious and industrious turns his trick of writing into purely literary channels, and becomes a novelist. The man who is not ambitious and not industrious, and who does not relish the prospect of becoming a loafer in Strand wine-shops, writes advertisements. The gold-bearing area is always growing. It's a Tom Tiddler's ground. It is simply a question of picking up the gold and silver. The industrious man picks up as much as he wants. Personally, I am easily content. An occasional nugget satisfies me. Here's tonight's nugget, for instance.\"  I took the paper he handed to me. It bore the words:     CAUGHT IN THE ACT     CAUGHT IN THE ACT of drinking Skeffington's Sloe Gin, a man will    always present a happy and smiling appearance. Skeffington's Sloe    Gin adds a crowning pleasure to prosperity, and is a consolation    in adversity. Of all Grocers.  \"Skeffington's,\" he said, \"pay me well. I'm worth money to them, and they know it. At present they are giving me a retainer to keep my work exclusively for them. The stuff they have put on the market is neither better nor worse than the average sloe gin. But my advertisements have given it a tremendous vogue. It is the only brand that grocers stock. Since I made the firm issue a weekly paper called _Skeffington's Poultry Farmer_, free to all country customers, the consumption of sloe gin has been enormous among agriculturists. My idea, too, of supplying suburban buyers gratis with a small drawing-book, skeleton illustrations, and four coloured chalks, has made the drink popular with children. You must have seen the poster I designed. There's a reduced copy behind you. The father of a family is unwrapping a bottle of Skeffington's Sloe Gin. His little ones crowd round him, laughing and clapping their hands. The man's wife is seen peeping roguishly in through the door. Beneath is the popular catch-phrase, \"Ain't mother going to 'ave none?\"  \"You're a genius,\" I cried.  \"Hardly that,\" he said. \"At least, I have no infinite capacity for taking pains. I am one of Nature's slackers. Despite my talent for drawing up advertisements, I am often in great straits owing to my natural inertia and a passionate love of sleep. I sleep on the slightest provocation or excuse. I will back myself to sleep against anyone in the world, no age, weight, or colour barred. You, I should say, are of a different temperament. More energetic. The Get On or Get Out sort of thing. The Young Hustler.\"  \"Rather,\" I replied briskly, \"I am in love.\"  \"So am I,\" said Julian Eversleigh. \"Hopelessly, however. Give us a match.\"  After that we confirmed our friendship by smoking a number of pipes together.     Chapter 5  THE COLUMN _(James Orlebar Cloyster's narrative continued)_   After the first week \"On Your Way,\" on the _Orb_, offered hardly any difficulty. The source of material was the morning papers, which were placed in a pile on our table at nine o'clock. The halfpenny papers were our principal support. Gresham and I each took one, and picked it clean. We attended first to the Subject of the Day. This was generally good for two or three paragraphs of verbal fooling. There was a sort of tradition that the first half-dozen paragraphs should be topical. The rest might be topical or not, as occasion served.  The column usually opened with a one-line pun--Gresham's invention.  Gresham was a man of unparalleled energy and ingenuity. He had created several of the typical characters who appeared from time to time in \"On Your Way,\" as, for instance, Mrs. Jenkinson, our Mrs. Malaprop, and Jones junior, our \"howler\" manufacturing schoolboy. He was also a stout apostle of a mode of expression which he called \"funny language.\" Thus, instead of writing boldly: \"There is a rumour that----,\" I was taught to say, \"It has got about that----.\" This sounds funnier in print, so Gresham said. I could never see it myself.  Gresham had a way of seizing on any bizarre incident reported in the morning papers, enfolding it in \"funny language,\" adding a pun, and thus making it his own. He had a cunning mastery of periphrasis, and a telling command of adverbs.  Here is an illustration. An account was given one morning by the Central news of the breaking into of a house at Johnsonville (Mich.) by a negro, who had stolen a quantity of greenbacks. The thief, escaping across some fields, was attacked by a cow, which, after severely injuring the negro, ate the greenbacks.  Gresham's unacknowledged version of the episode ran as follows:  \"The sleepy god had got the stranglehold on John Denville when Caesar Bones, a coloured gentleman, entered John's house at Johnsonville (Mich.) about midnight. Did the nocturnal caller disturb his slumbering host? No. Caesar Bones has the finer feelings. But as he was noiselessly retiring, what did he see? Why, a pile of greenbacks which John had thoughtlessly put away in a fire-proof safe.\"  To prevent the story being cut out by the editor, who revised all the proofs of the column, with the words \"too long\" scribbled against it, Gresham continued his tale in another paragraph.  \"'Dis am berry insecure,' murmured the visitor to himself, transplanting the notes in a neighbourly way into his pocket. Mark the sequel. The noble Caesar met, on his homeward path, an irritable cudster. The encounter was brief. Caesar went weak in the second round, and took the count in the third. Elated by her triumph, and hungry from her exertions, the horned quadruped nosed the wad of paper money and daringly devoured it. Caesar has told the court that if he is convicted of felony, he will arraign the owner of the ostrich-like bovine on a charge of receiving stolen goods. The owner merely ejaculates 'Black male!'\"  On his day Gresham could write the column and have a hundred lines over by ten o'clock. I, too, found plenty of copy as a rule, though I continued my practice of doing a few paragraphs overnight. But every now and then fearful days would come, when the papers were empty of material for our purposes, and when two out of every half-dozen paragraphs which we did succeed in hammering out were returned deleted on the editor's proof.  The tension at these times used to be acute. The head printer would send up a relay of small and grubby boys to remind us that \"On Your Way\" was fifty lines short. At ten o'clock he would come in person, and be plaintive.  Gresham, the old hand, applied to such occasions desperate remedies. He would manufacture out of even the most pointless item of news two paragraphs by adding to his first the words, \"This reminds us of Mr. Punch's famous story.\" He would then go through the bound volumes of _Punch_--we had about a dozen in the room--with lightning speed until he chanced upon a more or less appropriate tag.  Those were mornings when verses would be padded out from three stanzas to five, Gresham turning them out under fifteen minutes. He had a wonderful facility for verse.  As a last expedient one fell back upon a standing column, a moth-eaten collection of alleged jests which had been set up years ago to meet the worst emergencies. It was, however, considered a confession of weakness and a degradation to use this column.  We had also in our drawer a book of American witticisms, published in New York. To cut one out, preface it with \"A good American story comes to hand,\" and pin it on a slip was a pleasing variation of the usual mode of constructing a paragraph. Gresham and I each had our favourite method. Personally, I had always a partiality for dealing with \"buffers.\" \"The brakes refused to act, and the train struck the buffers at the end of the platform\" invariably suggested that if elderly gentlemen would abstain from loitering on railway platforms, they would not get hurt in this way.  Gresham had a similar liking for \"turns.\" \"The performance at the Frivoli Music Hall was in full swing when the scenery was noticed to be on fire. The audience got a turn. An extra turn.\"  Julian Eversleigh, to whom I told my experiences on the _Orb_, said he admired the spirit with which I entered into my duties. He said, moreover, that I had a future before me, not only as a journalist, but as a writer.  Nor, indeed, could I help seeing for myself that I was getting on. I was making a fair income now, and had every prospect of making a much better one. My market was not restricted. Verses, articles, and fiction from my pen were being accepted with moderate regularity by many of the minor periodicals. My scope was growing distinctly wider. I found, too, that my work seemed to meet with a good deal more success when I sent it in from the _Orb_, with a letter to the editor on _Orb_ notepaper.  Altogether, my five weeks on the _Orb_ were invaluable to me. I ought to have paid rather than have taken payment for working on the"]]]
