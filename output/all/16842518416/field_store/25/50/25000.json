Davis, Slidell, and Mallory, to carry out the objects of this meeting.\"   In giving this letter to the World--from its correspondent accompanying the expedition--the New York Times of March 15, 1862, made these forcible and clear-headed comments:  \"The telegraphic columns of the Times of January 7, 1861, contained the following Washington dispatch: 'The Southern Senators last night (January 5th) held a conference, and telegraphed to the Conventions of their respective States to advise immediate Secession.'  Now, the present letter is a report by Mr. Yulee, who was present at this 'consultation' as he calls it, of the resolutions adopted on this occasion, transmitted to the said Finegan, who by the way, was a member of the 'Sovereign Convention' of Florida, then sitting in the town of Tallahassee.  \"It will thus be seen that this remarkable letter, which breathes throughout the spirit of the Conspirator, in reality lets us into one of the most important of the numerous Secret Conclaves which the Plotters of Treason then held in the Capital.  It was then, as it appears, that they determined to strike the blow and precipitate their States into Secession.  But at the same time they resolved that it would be imprudent for them openly to withdraw, as in that case Congress might pass 'force, loan, and volunteer bills,' which would put Mr. Lincoln in immediate condition for hostilities.  No, no!  that would not do.  (So much patriotic virtue they half suspected, half feared, was left in the Country.)  On the contrary, 'by remaining in our places until the 4th of March it is thought we can keep the hands of Mr. Buchanan tied, and disable the Republicans from effecting any legislation which will strengthen the hands of the incoming Administration.'  Ah what a tragic back-ground, full of things unutterable, is there!  \"It appears, however, that events were faster than they, and instead of being able to retain their seats up to the 4th of March, they were able to remain but a very few weeks.  Mr. Davis withdrew on the 21st of January, just a fortnight after this 'consultation.'  But for the rest, mark how faithfully the programme here drawn up by this knot of Traitors in secret session was realized.  Each of the named States represented by this Cabal did, 'as soon as may be, Secede from the Union'--the Mississippi Convention passing its Ordinance on the heels of the receipt of these resolutions, on the 9th of January; Florida and Alabama on the 11th; Louisiana on the 26th, and Texas on the 1st of February; while the 'organization of the Confederate Government' took place at the very time appointed, Davis being inaugurated on the 18th of February.  \"And here is another Plot of the Traitors brought to light.  These very men, on withdrawing from the Senate, urged that they were doing so in obedience to the command of their respective States.  As Mr. Davis put it, in his parting speech, 'the Ordinance of Secession having passed the Convention of his State, he felt obliged to obey the summons, and retire from all official connection with the Federal Government.'  This letter of Mr. Yulee's clearly reveals that they had themselves pushed their State Conventions to the adoption of the very measure which they had the hardihood to put forward as an imperious 'summons' which they could not disobey.  It is thus that Treason did its Work.\"                                   CHAPTER XII.                    COPPERHEADISM  VS. UNION DEMOCRACY.  When we remember that it was on the night of the 5th of January, 1861, that the Rebel Conspirators in the United States Senate met and plotted their confederated Treason, as shown in the Yulee letter, given in the preceding Chapter of this work, and that on the very next day, January 6, 1861, Fernando Wood, then Mayor of the great city of New York, sent in to the Common Council of that metropolis, his recommendation that New York city should Secede from its own State, as well as the United States, and become \"a Free City,\" which, said he, \"may shed the only light and hope of a future reconstruction of our once blessed Confederacy,\" it is impossible to resist the conviction that this extraordinary movement of his, was inspired and prompted, if not absolutely directed, by the secret Rebel Conclave at Washington.  It bears within itself internal evidences of such prompting.  Thus, when Mayor Wood states the case in the following words, he seems to be almost quoting word for word an instruction received by him from these Rebel leaders--in connection with their plausible argument, upholding it.  Says he:  \"Much, no doubt, can be said in favor of the justice and policy of a separation.  It may be said that Secession or revolution in any of the United States would be subversive of all Federal authority, and, so far as the central Government is concerned, the resolving of the community into its original elements--that, if part of the States form new combinations and, Governments, other States may do the same.  Then it may be said, why should not New York city, instead of supporting by her contributions in revenue two-thirds of the expenses of the United States, become also equally independent?  As a Free City, with but nominal duty on imports, her local Government could be supported without taxation upon her people.  Thus we could live free from taxes, and have cheap goods nearly duty free.  In this she would have the whole and united support of the Southern States, as well as all the other States to whose interests and rights under the Constitution she has always been true.\"  That is the persuasive casuistry peculiar to the minds of the Southern Secession leaders.  It is naturally followed by a touch of that self-confident bluster, also at that time peculiar to Southern lips --as follows:  \"It is well for individuals or communities to look every danger square in the face, and to meet it calmly and bravely.  As dreadful as the severing of the bonds that have hitherto united the States has been in contemplation, it is now apparently a stern and inevitable fact.  We have now to meet it, with all the consequences, whatever they may be. If the Confederacy is broken up the Government is dissolved, and it behooves every distinct community, as well as every individual, to take care of themselves.  \"When Disunion has become a fixed and certain fact, why may not New York disrupt the bands which bind her to a venal and corrupt master--to a people and a Party that have plundered her revenues, attempted to ruin her commerce, taken away the power of self-government, and destroyed the Confederacy of which she was the proud Empire City? * * *\"  After thus restating, as it were, the views and \"arguments\" of the Rebel Junta, as we may presume them to have been pressed on him, he becomes suddenly startled at the Conclave's idea of meeting \"all the consequences, whatever they may be,\" and, turning completely around, with blanching pen, concludes:  \"But I am not prepared to recommend the violence implied in these views. In stating this argument in favor of freedom, 'peaceably if we can, forcibly if we must,' let me not be misunderstood.  The redress can be found only in appeals to the magnanimity of the people of the whole State.\" * * *  If \"these views\" were his own, and not those of the Rebel Conclave, he would either have been \"prepared to recommend the violence implied in them,\" or else he would have suppressed them altogether.  But his utterance is that of one who has certain views for the first time placed before him, and shrinks from the consequences of their advocacy--shrinks from \"the violence implied\" in them--although for some reason he dares not refuse to place those views before the people.  And, in carrying out his promise to do so--\"In stating this argument,\" presumably of the Rebel Conclave, \"in favor of freedom, 'peaceably if we can, forcibly if we must'\"--the language used is an admission that the argument is not his own.  Were it his own, would he not have said in \"making\" it, instead of in \"stating\" it?  Furthermore, had he been \"making\" it of his own accord, he would hardly have involved himself in such singular contradictions and explanations as are here apparent.  He was plainly \"stating\" the Rebel Conclave's argument, not making one himself.  He was obeying orders, under the protest of his fears.  And those fears forced his trembling pen to write the saving-clause which \"qualifies\" the Conclave's second-hand bluster preceding it.  That the Rebels hoped for Northern assistance in case of Secession, is very clear from many speeches made prior to and soon after the election of Mr. Lincoln to the Presidency--and from other sources of information. Thus we find in a speech made by Representative L. M. Keitt, of South Carolina, in Charleston, November, 1860, the following language, reported by the Mercury:  \"But we have been threatened.  Mr. Amos Kendall wrote a letter, in which he said to Colonel Orr, that if the State went out, three hundred thousand volunteers were ready to march against her.  I know little about Kendall--and the less the better.  He was under General Jackson; but for him the Federal treasury seemed to have a magnetic attraction.  \"Jackson was a pure man, but he had too many around him who made fortunes far transcending their salaries.  [Applause.]  And this Amos Kendall had the same good fortune under Van Buren.  He (Kendall) threatened us on the one side, and John Hickman on the other.  John Hickman said, defiantly, that if we went out of the Union, eighteen millions of Northern men would bring us back.  \"Let me tell you, there are a million"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7136"],["title","The Great Conspiracy, Volume 4 (#0)"],["body","GREAT CONSPIRACY                           Its Origin and History                                   Part 4                                     BY                                 JOHN LOGAN                                  CHAPTER XIV.                          THE COLORED CONTRABAND.  When the first gun was fired at Fort Sumter, its sullen echoes sounded the funeral knell of Slavery.  Years before, it had been foretold, and now it was to happen. Years before, it had been declared, by competent authority, that among the implications of the Constitution was that of the power of the General Government to Emancipate the Slaves, as a War measure.  Hence, in thus commencing the War of the Rebellion, the South marched with open eyes upon this, as among other of the legitimate and logical results of such a War.  Patrick Henry, in opposing the ratification by Virginia of the Federal Constitution, had declared to the Slaveholders of that State that \"Among ten thousand implied powers\" which Congress may assume, \"they may, if we be engaged in War, liberate every one of your Slaves, if they please, * * * Have they not power to provide for the General Defense and Welfare? May they not think that these call for the abolition of Slavery?  May they not pronounce all Slaves Free? and will they not be warranted by that power?  * * *  They have the power, in clear, unequivocal terms, and will clearly and certainly exercise it.\"  So, too, in his great speech of May 25, 1836, in the House of Representatives, John Quincy Adams had declared that in \"the last great conflict which must be fought between Slavery and Emancipation,\" Congress \"must and will interfere\" with Slavery, \"and they will not only possess the Constitutional power so to interfere, but they will be bound in duty to do it, by the express provisions of the Constitution itself.\" And he followed this declaration with the equally emphatic words: \"From the instant that your Slave-holding States become the theatre of War --civil, servile, or foreign--from that instant, the War powers of Congress extend to interference with the Institution of Slavery in every Way by which it can be interfered with.\"  The position thus announced by these expounders of the Constitution--the one from Virginia, the other from Massachusetts--was not to be shaken even by the unanimous adoption, February 11, 1861, by the House of Representatives on roll call, of the resolution of Mr. Sherman, of Ohio, in these words:  \"Resolved, That neither the Congress of the United States nor the people or governments of the non-Slaveholding States have the Constitutional right to legislate upon or interfere with Slavery in any of the Slaveholding States in the Union.\"  Ex-President J. Q. Adams's cogent exposition of the Constitution, twenty-five years before, in that same House, demonstrating not only that Congress had the right but the Constitutional power to so interfere--and his further demonstration April 15, 1842, of his statement that under the laws of War, \"when a Country is invaded, and two hostile armies are set in martial array, the Commanders of both Armies have power to Emancipate all the Slaves in the invaded territory\"--as not to be overcome by a mere vote of one House, however unanimous.  For the time being, however, it contributed, with other circumstances, to confuse the public mind and conscience.  Indeed as early as May of 1861, the attitude of our Government and its troops toward Negro Slaves owned or used by Rebels in rebellious States, began to perturb the public, bother the Administration, and worry the Military officers.  For instance, in Major-General McClellan's proclamation to the Union men of West Virginia, issued May 26, 1861, he said:  \"The General Government cannot close its ears to the demand you have made for assistance.  I have ordered troops to cross the river.  They come as your friends and brothers--as enemies only to armed Rebels, who are preying upon you; your homes, your families, and your property are safe under our protection.  All your rights shall be religiously respected, notwithstanding all that has been said by the Traitors to induce you to believe our advent among you will be signalized by an interference with your Slaves.  Understand one thing clearly: not only will we abstain from all such interference, but we will, on the contrary, with an iron hand crush any attempt at insurrection on their part.\"  On the other hand, the very next day, May 27, 1861, Major-General Butler, in command of the \"Department of  A Virginia,\" wrote to Lieutenant-General Scott as follows:  \"Since I wrote my last dispatch the question in regard to Slave property is becoming one of very serious magnitude.  The inhabitants of Virginia are using their Negroes in the batteries, and are preparing to send the women and children South.  The escapes from them are very numerous, and a squad has come in this morning to my pickets bringing their women and children.  Of course these cannot be dealt with upon the theory on which I designed to treat the services of able-bodied men and women who might come within my lines, and of which I gave you a detailed account in my last dispatch.  I am in the utmost doubt what to do with this species of Property.  \"Up to this time I have had come within my lines men and women with their children, entire families, each family belonging to the same owner.  I have, therefore, determined to employ, as I can do very profitably, the able-bodied persons in the party, issuing proper food for the support of all, and charging against their services the expense of care and sustenance of the non-laborers, keeping a strict and accurate account as well of the services as of the expenditure, having the worth of the services, and the cost of the expenditure, determined by a Board of Survey, to be hereafter detailed.  I know of no other manner in which to dispose of this subject and the questions connected therewith.  \"As a matter of Property to the Insurgents, it will be of very great moment, the number that I now have amounting, as I am informed, to what, in good times, would be of the value of sixty thousand dollars.  Twelve of these Negroes, I am informed, have escaped from the batteries on Sewall's Point, which, this morning, fired upon my expedition as it passed by out of range.  As a means of offense, therefore, in the Enemy's hands, these Negroes, when able-bodied, are of the last importance.  Without them the batteries could not have been erected, at least for many weeks.  \"As a Military question it would seem to be a measure of necessity to deprive their masters of their services.  How can this be done?  As a political question and a question of humanity, can I receive the services of a father and mother, and not take the children?  Of the humanitarian aspect I have no doubt.  Of the political one I have no right to judge.  I therefore submit all this to your better judgment, and as the questions have a political aspect, I have ventured, and I trust I am not wrong in so doing, to duplicate the parts of my dispatch relating to this subject, and forward them to the Secretary of War.\"  In reply to the duplicate copy of this letter received by him, Secretary Cameron thus answered:                           \"WASHINGTON, May 30, 1861.  \"SIR: Your action in respect to the Negroes who came within your lines from the service of the Rebels is approved.  The Department is sensible of the embarrassments which must surround officers conducting Military operations in a State by the laws of which Slavery is sanctioned.  \"The Government cannot recognize the rejection by any State of the Federal obligations, nor can it refuse the performance of the Federal obligations resting upon itself.  Among these Federal obligations, however, none can be more important than that of suppressing and dispersing armed combinations formed for the purpose of overthrowing its whole Constitutional authority.  \"While, therefore, you will permit no interference by the persons under your command, with the relations of Persons held to Service under the laws of any State, you will, on the other hand, so long as any State, within which your Military operations are conducted, is under the control of such armed combinations, refrain from surrendering to alleged masters any Person who may come within your lines.  \"You will employ such Persons in the services to which they may be best adapted, keeping an account of the labor by them performed, of the value of it, and the expenses of their maintenance.  The question of their final disposition will be reserved for future determination.                                \"SIMON CAMERON,                               \"Secretary of War.  \"To Major General BUTLER.\"   Great tenderness, however, was exhibited by many of the Union Generals for the doomed Institution.  On June 3, 1861, from Chambersburg, Pa., a proclamation signed \"By order of Major General Patterson, F. J. Porter, Asst.  Adj. General,\" was issued from \"Headquarters Department of Pennsylvania,\" \"To the United States troops of this Department,\" in which they are admonished \"that, in the coming campaign in Virginia, while it is your duty to punish Sedition, you must protect the Loyal, and, should the occasion offer, at once suppress Servile Insurrection.\"   \"General Orders No. 33,\" issued from \"Headquarters Department of Washington,\" July 17, 1861, \"By command of Brigadier General Mansfield, Theo. Talbot, Assistant Adjutant General,\" were to this effect: \"Fugitive Slaves will under no pretext whatever, be permitted to reside, or be in any way harbored, in the quarters or camps of the troops serving in this Department.  Neither will such Slaves be allowed to accompany troops on the march.  Commanders of troops will be held responsible for a strict observance of this order.\"  And early in August a Military order was issued at Washington \"that no Negroes, without sufficient evidence of their being Free or of"]]]
