Think you it is a favourable opportunity for our conversation?\"  \"Why not?\" said Glendower; \"what have the thunders and wrath of Heaven to do with us?\"  \"H-e-m! h-e-m!  God sees all things,\" rejoined Crauford, \"and avenges Himself on the guilty by His storms!\"  \"Ay; but those are the storms of the heart!  I tell you that even the innocent may have that within to which the loudest tempests without are peace!  But guilt, you say; what have we to do with guilt?\"  Crauford hesitated, and, avoiding any reply to this question, drew Glendower's arm within his own, and in a low half-whispered tone said,--  \"Glendower, survey mankind; look with a passionless and unprejudiced eye upon the scene which moves around us: what do you see anywhere but the same re-acted and eternal law of Nature,--all, all preying upon each other?  Or if there be a solitary individual who refrains, he is as a man without a common badge, without a marriage garment, and the rest trample him under foot!  Glendower, you are such a man!  Now hearken, I will deceive you not; I honour you too much to beguile you, even to your own good.  I own to you, fairly and at once, that in the scheme I shall unfold to you, there may be something repugnant, to the factitious and theoretical principles of education,--something hostile to the prejudices, though not to the reasonings, of the mind; but--\"  \"Hold!\" said Glendower, abruptly, pausing and fixing his bold and searching eye upon the tempter; \"hold! there will be no need of argument or refinement in this case: tell me at once your scheme, and at once I will accept or reject it!\"  \"Gently,\" said Crauford; \"to all deeds of contract there is a preamble.  Listen to me yet further: when I have ceased, I will listen to you.  It is in vain that you place man in cities; it is in vain that you fetter him with laws; it is in vain that you pour into his mind the light of an imperfect morality, of a glimmering wisdom, of an ineffectual religion: in all places he is the same,--the same savage and crafty being, who makes the passions which rule himself the tools of his conquest over others!  There is in all creation but one evident law,--self-preservation!  Split it as you like into hairbreadths and atoms, it is still fundamentally and essentially unaltered. Glendower, that self-preservation is our bond now.  Of myself I do not at present speak; I refer only to you: self-preservation commands you to place implicit confidence in me; it impels you to abjure indigence, by accepting the proposal I am about to make to you.\"  \"You, as yet, speak enigmas,\" said Glendower; \"but they are sufficiently clear to tell me their sense is not such as I have heard you utter.\"  \"You are right.  Truth is not always safe,--safe either to others, or to ourselves!  But I dare open to you now my real heart: look in it; I dare to say that you will behold charity, benevolence, piety to God, love and friendship at this moment to yourself; but I own, also, that you will behold there a determination--which to me seems courage--not to be the only idle being in the world, where all are busy; or, worse still, to be the only one engaged in a perilous and uncertain game, and yet shunning to employ all the arts of which he is master.  I will own to you that, long since, had I been foolishly inert, I should have been, at this moment, more penniless and destitute than yourself.  I live happy, respected, wealthy!  I enjoy in their widest range the blessings of life.  I dispense those blessings to others.  Look round the world: whose name stands fairer than mine? whose hand relieves more of human distresses? whose tongue preaches purer doctrines? None, Glendower, none.  I offer to you means not dissimilar to those I have chosen, fortunes not unequal to those I possess.  Nothing but the most unjustifiable fastidiousness will make you hesitate to accept my offer.\"  \"You cannot expect that I have met you this night with a resolution to be unjustifiably fastidious,\" said Glendower, with a hollow and cold smile.  Crauford did not immediately answer, for he was considering whether it was yet the time for disclosing the important secret.  While he was deliberating, the sullen clouds began to break from their suspense.  A double darkness gathered around, and a few large drops fell on the ground in token of a more general discharge about to follow from the floodgates of heaven.  The two men moved onward, and took shelter under an old arch.  Crauford first broke silence.  \"Hist!\" said he, hist! do you hear anything?\"  \"Yes!  I heard the winds and the rain, and the shaking houses, and the plashing pavements, and the reeking housetops,--nothing more.\"  Looking long and anxiously around to certify himself that none was indeed the witness of their conference, Crauford approached close to Glendower and laid his hand heavily upon his arm.  At that moment a vivid and lengthened flash of lightning shot through the ruined arch, and gave to Crauford's countenance a lustre which Glendower almost started to behold.  The face, usually so smooth, calm, bright in complexion, and almost inexpressive from its extreme composure, now agitated by the excitement of the moment, and tinged by the ghastly light of the skies, became literally fearful.  The cold blue eye glared out from its socket; the lips blanched, and, parting in act to speak, showed the white glistening teeth; and the corners of the mouth, drawn down in a half sneer, gave to the cheeks, rendered green and livid by the lightning, a lean and hollow appearance contrary to their natural shape.  \"It is,\" said Crauford, in a whispered but distinct tone, \"a perilous secret that I am about to disclose to you.  I indeed have no concern in it, but my lords the judges have, and you will not therefore be surprised if I forestall the ceremonies of their court and require an oath.\"  Then, his manner and voice suddenly changing into an earnest and deep solemnity, as excitement gave him an eloquence more impressive, because unnatural to his ordinary moments, he continued: \"By those lightnings and commotions above; by the heavens in which they revel in their terrible sports; by the earth, whose towers they crumble, and herbs they blight, and creatures they blast into cinders at their will; by Him whom, whatever be the name He bears, all men in the living world worship and tremble before; by whatever is sacred in this great and mysterious universe, and at the peril of whatever can wither and destroy and curse,--swear to preserve inviolable and forever the secret I shall whisper in your ear!\"  The profound darkness which now, in the pause of the lightning, wrapped the scene, hid from Crauford all sight of the effect he had produced, and even the very outline of Glendower's figure; but the gloom made more distinct the voice which thrilled through it upon Crauford's ear.  \"Promise me that there is not dishonour, nor crime, which is dishonour, in this confidence, and I swear.\"  Crauford ground his teeth.  He was about to reply impetuously, but he checked himself.  \"I am not going,\" thought he, \"to communicate my own share of this plot, but merely to state that a plot does exist, and then to point out in what manner he can profit by it; so far, therefore, there is no guilt in his concealment, and, consequently, no excuse for him to break his vow.\"  Rapidly running over this self-argument, he said aloud, \"I promise!\"  \"And,\" rejoined Glendower, \"I swear!\"  At the close of this sentence another flash of lightning again made darkness visible, and Glendower, beholding the countenance of his companion, again recoiled: for its mingled haggardness and triumph seemed to his excited imagination the very expression of a fiend! \"Now,\" said Crauford, relapsing into his usual careless tone, somewhat enlivened by his sneer, \"now, then, you must not interrupt me in my disclosure by those starts and exclamations which break from your philosophy like sparks from flint.  Hear me throughout.\"  And, bending down, till his mouth reached Glendower's ear, he commenced his recital.  Artfully hiding his own agency, the master- spring of the gigantic machinery of fraud, which, too mighty for a single hand, required an assistant,--throwing into obscurity the sin, while, knowing the undaunted courage and desperate fortunes of the man, he did not affect to conceal the danger; expatiating upon the advantages, the immense and almost inexhaustible resources of wealth which his scheme suddenly opened upon one in the deepest abyss of poverty, and slightly sketching, as if to excite vanity, the ingenuity and genius by which the scheme originated, and could only be sustained,--Crauford's detail of temptation, in its knowledge of human nature, in its adaptation of act to principles, in its web-like craft of self-concealment, and the speciousness of its lure, was indeed a splendid masterpiece of villanous invention.  But while Glendower listened, and his silence flattered Crauford's belief of victory, not for one single moment did a weak or yielding desire creep around his heart.  Subtly as the scheme was varnished, and scarce a tithe of its comprehensive enormity unfolded, the strong and acute mind of one long accustomed to unravel sophistry and gaze on the loveliness of truth, saw at once that the scheme proposed was of the most unmingled treachery and baseness.  Sick, chilled, withering at heart, Glendower leaned against the damp wall; as every word which the tempter fondly imagined was irresistibly confirming his purpose, tore away the last prop to which, in the credulity of hope, the student had clung, and mocked while it crushed the fondness of his belief.  Crauford ceased, and stretched forth his hand to grasp Glendower's. He felt it not.  \"You do not speak, my friend,\" said he; \"do you deliberate, or have you not decided?\"  Still no answer came. Surprised, and half alarmed, he turned round, and perceived by a momentary "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/765"],["title","The Moon Pool (#0)"],["body","Moon Pool  A. MERRITT     Foreword  The publication of the following narrative of Dr. Walter T. Goodwin has been authorized by the Executive Council of the International Association of Science.  First:  To end officially what is beginning to be called the Throckmartin Mystery and to kill the innuendo and scandalous suspicions which have threatened to stain the reputations of Dr. David Throckmartin, his youthful wife, and equally youthful associate Dr. Charles Stanton ever since a tardy despatch from Melbourne, Australia, reported the disappearance of the first from a ship sailing to that port, and the subsequent reports of the disappearance of his wife and associate from the camp of their expedition in the Caroline Islands.  Second:  Because the Executive Council have concluded that Dr. Goodwin's experiences in his wholly heroic effort to save the three, and the lessons and warnings within those experiences, are too important to humanity as a whole to be hidden away in scientific papers understandable only to the technically educated; or to be presented through the newspaper press in the abridged and fragmentary form which the space limitations of that vehicle make necessary.  For these reasons the Executive Council commissioned Mr. A. Merritt to transcribe into form to be readily understood by the layman the stenographic notes of Dr. Goodwin's own report to the Council, supplemented by further oral reminiscences and comments by Dr. Goodwin; this transcription, edited and censored by the Executive Council of the Association, forms the contents of this book.  Himself a member of the Council, Dr. Walter T. Goodwin, Ph.D., F.R.G.S. etc., is without cavil the foremost of American botanists, an observer of international reputation and the author of several epochal treaties upon his chosen branch of science. His story, amazing in the best sense of that word as it may be, is fully supported by proofs brought forward by him and accepted by the organization of which I have the honor to be president. What matter has been elided from this popular presentation--because of the excessively menacing potentialities it contains, which unrestricted dissemination might develop--will be dealt with in purely scientific pamphlets of carefully guarded circulation.

The day before I had reached Port Moresby and had seen my specimens safely stored on board the Southern Queen. As I sat on the upper deck I thought, with homesick mind, of the long leagues between me and Melbourne, and the longer ones between Melbourne and New York.  It was one of Papua's yellow mornings when she shows herself in her sombrest, most baleful mood. The sky was smouldering ochre. Over the island brooded a spirit sullen, alien, implacable, filled with the threat of latent, malefic forces waiting to be unleashed. It seemed an emanation out of the untamed, sinister heart of Papua herself--sinister even when she smiles. And now and then, on the wind, came a breath from virgin jungles, laden with unfamiliar odours, mysterious and menacing.  It is on such mornings that Papua whispers to you of her immemorial ancientness and of her power. And, as every white man must, I fought against her spell. While I struggled I saw a tall figure striding down the pier; a Kapa-Kapa boy followed swinging a new valise. There was something familiar about the tall man. As he reached the gangplank he looked up straight into my eyes, stared for a moment, then waved his hand.  And now I knew him.  It was Dr. David Throckmartin--\"Throck\" he was to me always, one of my oldest friends and, as well, a mind of the first water whose power and achievements were for me a constant inspiration as they were, I know, for scores other.  Coincidentally with my recognition came a shock of surprise, definitely--unpleasant. It was Throckmartin--but about him was something disturbingly unlike the man I had known long so well and to whom and to whose little party I had bidden farewell less than a month before I myself had sailed for these seas. He had married only a few weeks before, Edith, the daughter of Professor William Frazier, younger by at least a decade than he but at one with him in his ideals and as much in love, if it were possible, as Throckmartin. By virtue of her father's training a wonderful assistant, by virtue of her own sweet, sound heart a--I use the word in its olden sense--lover. With his equally youthful associate Dr. Charles Stanton and a Swedish woman, Thora Halversen, who had been Edith Throckmartin's nurse from babyhood, they had set forth for the Nan-Matal, that extraordinary group of island ruins clustered along the eastern shore of Ponape in the Carolines.  I knew that he had planned to spend at least a year among these ruins, not only of Ponape but of Lele--twin centres of a colossal riddle of humanity, a weird flower of civilization that blossomed ages before the seeds of Egypt were sown; of whose arts we know little enough and of whose science nothing. He had carried with him unusually complete equipment for the work he had expected to do and which, he hoped, would be his monument.  What then had brought Throckmartin to Port Moresby, and what was that change I had sensed in him?  Hurrying down to the lower deck I found him with the purser.  As I spoke he turned, thrust out to me an eager hand--and then I saw what was that difference that had so moved me. He knew, of course by my silence and involuntary shrinking the shock my closer look had given me. His eyes filled; he turned brusquely from the purser, hesitated--then hurried off to his stateroom.  \"'E looks rather queer--eh?\" said the purser.  \"Know 'im well, sir? Seems to 'ave given you quite a start.\"  I made some reply and went slowly up to my chair.  There I sat, composed my mind and tried to define what it was that had shaken me so. Now it came to me. The old Throckmartin was on the eve of his venture just turned forty, lithe, erect, muscular; his controlling expression one of enthusiasm, of intellectual keenness, of--what shall I say--expectant search. His always questioning brain had stamped its vigor upon his face.  But the Throckmartin I had seen below was one who had borne some scaring shock of mingled rapture and horror; some soul cataclysm that in its climax had remoulded, deep from within, his face, setting on it seal of wedded ecstasy and despair; as though indeed these two had come to him hand in hand, taken possession of him and departing left behind, ineradicably, their linked shadows!  Yes--it was that which appalled.  For how could rapture and horror, Heaven and Hell mix, clasp hands--kiss?  Yet these were what in closest embrace lay on Throckmartin's face!  Deep in thought, subconsciously with relief, I watched the shore line sink behind; welcomed the touch of the wind of the free seas. I had hoped, and within the hope was an inexplicable shrinking that I would meet Throckmartin at lunch. He did not come down, and I was sensible of deliverance within my disappointment. All that afternoon I lounged about uneasily but still he kept to his cabin--and within me was no strength to summon him. Nor did he appear at dinner.  Dusk and night fell swiftly.  I was warm and went back to my deck-chair. The Southern Queen was rolling to a disquieting swell and I had the place to myself.  Over the heavens was a canopy of cloud, glowing faintly and testifying to the moon riding behind it. There was much phosphorescence. Fitfully before the ship and at her sides arose those stranger little swirls of mist that swirl up from the Southern Ocean like breath of sea monsters, whirl for an instant and disappear.  Suddenly the deck door opened and through it came Throckmartin.  He paused uncertainly, looked up at the sky with a curiously eager, intent gaze, hesitated, then closed the door behind him.  \"Throck,\" I called.  \"Come!  It's Goodwin.\"  He made his way to me.  \"Throck,\" I said, wasting no time in preliminaries. \"What's wrong? Can I help you?\"  I felt his body grow tense.  \"I'm going to Melbourne, Goodwin,\" he answered.  \"I need a few things--need them urgently. And more men--white men--\"  He stopped abruptly; rose from his chair, gazed intently toward the north. I followed his gaze. Far, far away the moon had broken through the clouds. Almost on the horizon, you could see the faint luminescence of it upon the smooth sea. The distant patch of light quivered and shook. The clouds thickened again and it was gone. The ship raced on southward, swiftly.  Throckmartin dropped into his chair.  He "]]]
