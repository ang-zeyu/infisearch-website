This looks grave, for my dear cousin Edward's health is failing fast. May the saints spare him long from their rest!\"  \"These are indeed ill tidings,\" said the Earl; \"and I trust that they suffice to plead at once my excuse for urging any immediate departure. Grateful I am for thy most gracious hostship, and thy just and generous intercession with thy liegeman\" (Harold dwelt emphatically on the last word), \"for my release from a capture disgraceful to all Christendom.  The ransom so nobly paid for me I will not insult thee, dear my lord, by affecting to repay; but such gifts as our cheapmen hold most rare, perchance thy lady and thy fair children will deign to receive at my hands.  Of these hereafter.  Now may I ask but a vessel from thy nearest port.\"  \"We will talk of this, dear guest and brother knight, on some later occasion.  Lo, yon castle--ye have no such in England.  See its vawmures and fosses!\"  \"A noble pile,\" answered Harold.  \"But pardon me that I press for--\"  \"Ye have no such strongholds, I say, in England?\" interrupted the Duke petulantly.  \"Nay,\" replied the Englishman, \"we have two strongholds far larger than that--Salisbury Plain and Newmarket Heath! [199]--strongholds that will contain fifty thousand men who need no walls but their shields.  Count William, England's ramparts are her men, and her strongest castles are her widest plains.\"  \"Ah!\" said the Duke, biting his lip, \"ah, so be it--but to return:--in that castle, mark it well, the Dukes of Normandy hold their prisoners of state;\" and then he added with a laugh; \"but we hold you, noble captive, in a prison more strong--our love and our heart.\"  As he spoke, he turned his eye full upon Harold, and the gaze of the two encountered: that of the Duke was brilliant, but stern and sinister; that of Harold, steadfast and reproachful.  As if by a spell, the eye of each rested long on that of the other--as the eyes of two lords of the forest, ere the rush and the spring.  William was the first to withdraw his gaze, and as he did so, his lip quivered and his brow knit.  Then waving his hand for some of the lords behind to join him and the Earl, he spurred his steed, and all further private conversation was suspended.  The train pulled not bridle before they reached a monastery, at which they rested for the night.     CHAPTER V.   On entering the chamber set apart for him in the convent, Harold found Haco and Wolnoth already awaiting him; and a wound he had received in the last skirmish against the Bretons, having broken out afresh on the road, allowed him an excuse to spend the rest of the evening alone with his kinsmen.  On conversing with them--now at length, and unrestrainedly--Harold saw everything to increase his alarm; for even Wolnoth, when closely pressed, could not but give evidence of the unscrupulous astuteness with which, despite all the boasted honour of chivalry, the Duke's character was stained.  For, indeed in his excuse, it must be said, that from the age of eight, exposed to the snares of his own kinsmen, and more often saved by craft than by strength, William had been taught betimes to justify dissimulation, and confound wisdom with guile.  Harold now bitterly recalled the parting words of Edward, and recognised their justice, though as yet he did not see all that they portended.  Fevered and disquieted yet more by the news from England, and conscious that not only the power of his House and the foundations of his aspiring hopes, but the very weal and safety of the land, were daily imperilled by his continued absence, a vague and unspeakable terror for the first time in his life preyed on his bold heart--a terror like that of superstition, for, like superstition, it was of the Unknown; there was everything to shun, yet no substance to grapple with.  He who could have smiled at the brief pangs of death, shrunk from the thought of the perpetual prison; he, whose spirit rose elastic to every storm of life, and exulted in the air of action, stood appalled at the fear of blindness;--blindness in the midst of a career so grand;--blindness in the midst of his pathway to a throne;-- blindness, that curse which palsies the strong and enslaves the free, and leaves the whole man defenceless;--defenceless in an Age of Iron.  What, too, were those mysterious points on which he was to satisfy the Duke?  He sounded his young kinsmen; but Wolnoth evidently knew nothing; Haco's eye showed intelligence, but by his looks and gestures he seemed to signify that what he knew he would only disclose to Harold.  Fatigued, not more with his emotions than with that exertion to conceal them so peculiar to the English character (proud virtue of manhood so little appreciated, and so rarely understood!) he at length kissed Wolnoth, and dismissed him, yawning, to his rest. Haco, lingering, closed the door, and looked long and mournfully at the Earl.  \"Noble kinsman,\" said the young son of Sweyn, \"I foresaw from the first, that as our fate will be thine;--only round thee will be wall and fosse; unless, indeed, thou wilt lay aside thine own nature--it will give thee no armour here--and assume that which----\"  \"Ho!\" interrupted the Earl, shaking with repressed passion, \"I see already all the foul fraud and treason to guest and noble that surround me!  But if the Duke dare such shame he shall do so in the eyes of day.  I will hail the first boat I see on his river, or his sea-coast; and woe to those who lay hand on this arm to detain me!\"  Haco lifted his ominous eyes to Harold's; and there was something in their cold and unimpassioned expression which seemed to repel all enthusiasm, and to deaden all courage.  \"Harold,\" said he, \"if but for one such moment thou obeyest the impulses of thy manly pride, or thy just resentment, thou art lost for ever; one show of violence, one word of affront, and thou givest the Duke the excuse he thirsts for.  Escape!  It is impossible.  For the last five years, I have pondered night and day the means of flight; for I deem that my hostageship, by right, is long since over; and no means have I seen or found.  Spies dog my every step, as spies, no doubt, dog thine.\"  \"Ha! it is true,\" said Harold; \"never once have I wandered three paces from the camp or the troop, but, under some pretext, I have been followed by knight or courtier.  God and our Lady help me, if but for England's sake!  But what counsellest thou?  Boy, teach me; thou hast been reared in this air of wile--to me it is strange, and I am as a wild beast encompassed by a circle of fire.\"  \"Then,\" answered Haco, \"meet craft by craft, smile by smile.  Feel that thou art under compulsion, and act,--as the Church itself pardons men for acting, so compelled.\"  Harold started, and the blush spread red over his cheeks.  Haco continued.  \"Once in prison, and thou art lost evermore to the sight of men. William would not then dare to release thee--unless, indeed, he first rendered thee powerless to avenge.  Though I will not malign him, and say that he himself is capable of secret murder, yet he has ever those about him who are.  He drops in his wrath some hasty word; it is seized by ready and ruthless tools.  The great Count of Bretagne was in his way; William feared him as he fears thee; and in his own court, and amongst his own men, the great Count of Bretagne died by poison. For thy doom, open or secret, William, however, could find ample excuse.\"  \"How, boy?  What charge can the Norman bring against a free Englishman?\"  \"His kinsman Alfred,\" answered Haco, \"was blinded, tortured, and murdered.  And in the court of Rouen, they say these deeds were done by Godwin, thy father.  The Normans who escorted Alfred were decimated in cold blood; again, they say Godwin thy father slaughtered them.\"  \"It is hell's own lie!\" cried Harold,  \"and so have I proved already to the Duke.\"  \"Proved?  No!  The lamb does not prove the cause which is prejudged by the wolf.  Often and often have I heard the Normans speak of those deeds, and cry that vengeance yet shall await them.  It is but to renew the old accusation, to say Godwin's sudden death was God's proof of his crime, and even Edward himself would forgive the Duke for thy bloody death.  But grant the best; grant that the more lenient doom were but the prison; grant that Edward and the English invaded Normandy to enforce thy freedom; knowest thou what William hath ere now done with hostages?  He hath put them in the van of his army, and seared out their eyes in the sight of both hosts.  Deemest thou he would be more gentle to us and to thee?  Such are thy dangers.  Be bold and frank,--and thou canst not escape them; be wary and wise, promise and feign,--and they are baffled: cover thy lion heart with the fox's hide until thou art free from the toils.\"  \"Leave me, leave me,\" said Harold, hastily.  \"Yet, hold.  Thou didst seem to understand me when I hinted of--in a word, what is the object William would gain from me?\"  Haco looked around; again went to the door--again opened and closed it--approached, and whispered, \"The crown of England!\"  The Earl bounded as if shot to the heart; then, again he cried: \"Leave me.  I must be alone--alone now.  Go! go!\"     CHAPTER VI.   Only in solitude could that strong man give way to his emotions; and at first they rushed forth so confused and stormy, so hurtling one the other, that hours elapsed before he could serenely face the terrible crisis of his position.  The great historian of Italy has said, that whenever the simple and truthful German came amongst the plotting and artful Italians and experienced their duplicity and craft, he straightway became more false and subtle than the Italians themselves: to his own countrymen, indeed, he continued to retain his characteristic sincerity and good faith; but, once duped and tricked by the southern schemers, as if with a fierce scorn, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7680"],["title","Harold : the Last of the Saxon Kings — Volume 09 (#6)"],["body","rejected troth with the truthless; he exulted in mastering them in their own wily statesmanship; and if reproached for insincerity, retorted with naive wonder, \"Ye Italians, and complain of insincerity!  How otherwise can one deal with you--how be safe amongst you?\"  Somewhat of this revolution of all the natural elements of his character took place in Harold's mind that stormy and solitary night. In the transport of his indignation, he resolved not doltishly to be thus outwitted to his ruin.  The perfidious host had deprived himself of that privilege of Truth,--the large and heavenly security of man;-- it was but a struggle of wit against wit, snare against snare.  The state and law of warfare had started up in the lap of fraudful peace; and ambush must be met by ambush, plot by plot.  Such was the nature of the self-excuses by which the Saxon defended his resolves, and they appeared to him more sanctioned by the stake which depended on success--a stake which his undying patriotism allowed to be far more vast than his individual ambition.  Nothing was more clear than that if he were detained in a Norman prison, at the time of King Edward's death, the sole obstacle to William's design on the English throne would be removed.  In the interim, the Duke's intrigues would again surround the infirm King with Norman influences; and in the absence both of any legitimate heir to the throne capable of commanding the trust of the people, and of his own preponderating ascendancy both in the Witan and the armed militia of the nation, what could arrest the designs of the grasping Duke?  Thus his own liberty was indissolubly connected with that of his country; and for that great end, the safety of England, all means grew holy.  When the next morning he joined the cavalcade, it was only by his extreme paleness that the struggle and agony of the past night could be traced, and he answered with correspondent cheerfulness William's cordial greetings.  As they rode together--still accompanied by several knights, and the discourse was thus general, the features of the country suggested the theme of the talk.  For, now in the heart of Normandy, but in rural districts remote from the great towns, nothing could be more waste and neglected than the face of the land.  Miserable and sordid to the last degree were the huts of the serfs; and when these last met them on their way, half naked and hunger-worn, there was a wild gleam of hate and discontent in their eyes, as they louted low to the Norman riders, and heard the bitter and scornful taunts with which they were addressed; for the Norman and the Frank had more than indifference for the peasants of their land; they literally both despised and abhorred them, as of different race from the conquerors.  The Norman settlement especially was so recent in the land, that none of that amalgamation between class and class which centuries had created in England, existed there; though in England the theowe was wholly a slave, and the ceorl in a political servitude to his lord, yet public opinion, more mild than law, preserved the thraldom from wanton aggravation; and slavery was felt to be wrong and unchristian.  The Saxon Church-- not the less, perhaps, for its very ignorance--sympathised more with the subject population and was more associated with it, than the comparatively learned and haughty ecclesiastics of the continent, who held aloof from the unpolished vulgar.  The Saxon Church invariably set the example of freeing the theowe and emancipating the ceorl, and taught that such acts were to the salvation of the soul.  The rude and homely manner in which the greater part of the Saxon thegns lived-- dependent solely for their subsistence on their herds and agricultural produce, and therefore on the labour of their peasants--not only made the distinctions of rank less harsh and visible, but rendered it the interest of the lords to feed and clothe well their dependents.  All our records of the customs of the Saxons prove the ample sustenance given to the poor, and a general care of their lives and rights, which, compared with the Frank laws, may be called enlightened and humane.  And above all, the lowest serf ever had the great hope both of freedom and of promotion; but the beast of the field was holier in the eyes of the Norman, than the wretched villein [200].  We have likened the Norman to the Spartan, and, most of all, he was like him in his scorn of the helot.  Thus embruted and degraded, deriving little from religion itself, except its terrors, the general habits of the peasants on the continent of France were against the very basis of Christianity-- marriage.  They lived together for the most part without that tie, and hence the common name, with which they were called by their masters, lay and clerical, was the coarsest word contempt can apply to the sons of women.  \"The hounds glare at us,\" said Odo, as a drove of these miserable serfs passed along.  \"They need ever the lash to teach them to know the master.  Are they thus mutinous and surly in England, Lord Harold?\"  \"No: but there our meanest theowes are not seen so clad, nor housed in such hovels,\" said the Earl.  \"And is it really true that a villein with you can rise to be a noble?\"  \"Of at least yearly occurrence.  Perhaps the forefathers of one-fourth of our Anglo-Saxon thegns held the plough, or followed some craft mechanical.\"  Duke William politicly checked Odo's answer, and said mildly:  \"Every land its own laws: and by them alone should it be governed by a virtuous and wise ruler.  But, noble Harold, I grieve that you should thus note the sore point in my realm.  I grant that the condition of the peasants and the culture of the land need reform.  But in my childhood, there was a fierce outbreak of rebellion among the villeins, needing bloody example to check, and the memories of wrath between lord and villein must sleep before we can do justice between them, as please St. Peter, and by Lanfranc's aid, we hope to do. Meanwhile, one great portion of our villeinage in our larger towns we have much mitigated.  For trade and commerce are the strength of rising states; and if our fields are barren our streets are prosperous.\"  Harold bowed, and rode musingly on.  That civilisation he had so much admired bounded itself to the noble class, and, at farthest, to the circle of the Duke's commercial policy.  Beyond it, on the outskirts of humanity, lay the mass of the people.  And here, no comparison in favour of the latter could be found between English and Norman civilisation.  The towers of Bayeux rose dim in the distance, when William proposed a halt in a pleasant spot by the side of a small stream, overshadowed by oak and beech.  A tent for himself and Harold was pitched in haste, and after an abstemious refreshment, the Duke, taking Harold's arm, led him away from the train along the margin of the murmuring stream.  They were soon in a remote, pastoral, primitive spot, a spot like those which the old menestrels loved to describe, and in which some pious hermit might, pleased, have fixed his solitary home.  Halting where a mossy bank jutted over the water, William motioned to his companion to seat himself, and reclining at his side, abstractedly took the pebbles from the margin and dropped them into the stream. They fell to the botton with a hollow sound; the circle they made on the surface widened, and was lost; and the wave rushed and murmured on, disdainful.  \"Harold,\" said the Duke at last, \"thou hast thought, I fear, that I have trifled with thy impatience to return.  But there is on my mind a matter of great moment to thee and to me, and it must out, before thou canst depart.  On this very spot where we now sit, sate in early youth, Edward thy King, and William thy host.  Soothed by the loneliness of the place, and the music of the bell from the church tower, rising pale through yonder glade, Edward spoke of his desire for the monastic life, and of his content with his exile in the Norman land.  Few then were the hopes that he should ever attain the throne of Alfred.  I, more martial, and ardent for him as myself, combated the thought of the convent, and promised, that, if ever occasion meet arrived, and he needed the Norman help, I would, with arm and heart, do a chief's best to win him his lawful crown.  Heedest thou me, dear Harold?\"  \"Ay, my host, with heart as with ear.\"  \"And Edward then, pressing my hand as I now press thine, while answering gratefully, promised, that if he did, contrary to all human foresight, gain his heritage, he, in case I survived him, would bequeath that heritage to me.  Thy hand withdraws itself from mine.\"  \"But from surprise:  Duke William, proceed.\"  \"Now,\" resumed William, \"when thy kinsmen were sent to me as hostages for the most powerful House in England--the only one that could thwart the desire of my cousin--I naturally deemed this a corroboration of his promise, and an earnest of his continued designs; and in this I was reassured by the prelate, Robert, Archbishop of Canterbury, who knew the most secret conscience of your King.  Wherefore my pertinacity in retaining those hostages; wherefore my disregard to Edward's mere remonstrances, which I not unnaturally conceived to be but his meek confessions to the urgent demands of thyself and House. Since then, Fortune or Providence hath favoured the promise of the King, and my just expectations founded thereon.  For one moment, it seemed indeed, that Edward regretted or reconsidered the pledge of our youth.  He sent for his kinsman, the Atheling, natural heir to the throne.  But the poor prince died.  The son, a mere child, if I am rightly informed, the laws of thy land will set aside, should Edward die ere the child grown a man; and, moreover, I am assured, that the young Edgar hath no power of mind or intellect to wield so weighty a sceptre as that of England.  Your King, also, even since your absence, hath had severe visitings of"]]]
