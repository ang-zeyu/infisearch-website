FREEDOM AT LAST ASSURED.  As to the Military situation, a few words are, at this time, necessary: Hood had now marched Northward, with some 50,000 men, toward Nashville, Tenn., while Sherman, leaving Thomas and some 35,000 men behind, to thwart him, had abandoned his base, and was marching Southward from Atlanta, through Georgia, toward the Sea.  On the 30th of November, 1864, General Schofield, in command of the 4th and 23rd Corps of Thomas's Army, decided to make a stand against Hood's Army, at Franklin, in the angle of the Harpeth river, in order to give time for the Union supply-trains to cross the river.  Here, with less than 20,000 Union troops, behind some hastily constructed works, he had received the impetuous and overwhelming assault of the Enemy--at first so successful as to threaten a bloody and disastrous rout to the Union troops--and, by a brilliant counter-charge, and subsequent obstinate defensive-fighting, had repulsed the Rebel forces, with nearly three times the Union losses, and withdrew the next day in safety to the defenses of Nashville.  A few days later, Hood, with his diminished Rebel Army, sat down before the lines of Thomas's somewhat augmented Army, which stretched from bank to bank of the bight of the Cumberland river upon which Nashville is situated.  And now a season of intense cold set in, lasting a week or ten days. During this period of apparent inaction on both sides--which aroused public apprehension in the North, and greatly disturbed General Grant--I was ordered to City Point, by the General-in-Chief, with a view to his detailing me to Thomas's Command, at Nashville.  On the way, I called on President Lincoln, at the White House.  I found him not very well, and with his feet considerably swollen.  He was sitting on a chair, with his feet resting on a table, while a barber was shaving him.  Shaking him by the hand, and asking after his health, he answered, with a humorous twinkle of the eye, that he would illustrate his condition by telling me a story.  Said he: \"Two of my neighbors, on a certain occasion, swapped horses.  One of these horses was large, but quite thin.  A few days after, on inquiry being made of the man who had the big boney horse, how the animal was getting along?--whether improving or not?--the owner said he was doing finely; that he had fattened almost up to the knees already!\"  Afterward--when, the process of shaving had been completed, we passed to another room--our conversation naturally turned upon the War; and his ideas upon all subjects connected with it were as clear as those of any other person with whom I ever talked.  He had an absolute conviction as to the ultimate outcome of the War--the final triumph of the Union Arms; and I well remember, with what an air of complete relief and perfect satisfaction he said to me, referring to Grant--\"We have now at the head of the Armies, a man in whom all the People can have confidence.\"  But to return to Military operations: On December 10th? Sherman reached the sea-board and commenced the siege of Savannah, Georgia; on the 13th, Fort McAllister was stormed and Sherman's communications opened with the Sea; on the 15th and 16th, the great Battle of Nashville was fought, between the Armies of Thomas and Hood, and a glorious victory gained by the Union Arms--Hood's Rebel forces being routed, pursued for days, and practically dispersed; and, before the year ended, Savannah surrendered, and was presented to the Nation, as \"a Christmas gift,\" by Sherman.  And now the last Session of the Thirty-eighth Congress having commenced, the Thirteenth Amendment might at any time come up again in the House. In his fourth and last Annual Message, just sent in to that Body, President Lincoln had said:  \"At the last Session of Congress a proposed Amendment of the Constitution abolishing Slavery throughout the United States, passed the Senate, but failed for lack of the requisite two-thirds vote in the House of Representatives.  Although the present is the same Congress, and nearly the same members, and without questioning the wisdom or patriotism of those who stood in opposition, I venture to recommend the reconsideration and passage of the measure at the present Session.  Of course the abstract question is not changed; but an intervening election shows, almost certainly, that the next Congress will pass the measure if this does not.  Hence there is only a question of time as to when the proposed Amendment will go to, the States for their action.  And as it is to so go, at all, events, may we not agree that the sooner the better?  It is not claimed that the election has imposed a duty on members to change their views or their votes, any farther than, as an additional element to be considered, their judgment may be affected by it.  It is the voice of the People now, for the first time, heard upon the question.  In a great National crisis like ours, unanimity of action among those seeking a common end is very desirable--almost indispensable.  And yet no approach to such unanimity is attainable unless some deference shall be paid to the will of the majority simply because it is the will of the majority.  In this case the common end is the maintenance of the Union; and, among the means to secure that end, such will, through the election, is most clearly declared in favor of such Constitutional Amendment.\"  After affirming that, on the subject of the preservation of the Union, the recent elections had shown the existence of \"no diversity among the People;\" that \"we have more men now than we had when the War began;\" that \"we are gaining strength\" in all ways; and that, after the evidences given by Jefferson Davis of his unchangeable opposition to accept anything short of severance from the Union, \"no attempt at negotiation with the Insurgent leader could result in any good,\" he appealed to the other Insurgents to come back to the fold--the door of amnesty and pardon, being still \"open to all.\"  But, he continued:  \"In presenting the abandonment of armed resistance to the National Authority, on the part of the Insurgents, as the only indispensable condition to ending the War, on the part of the Government, I retract nothing heretofore said as to Slavery.  I repeat the declaration made a year ago, that 'while I remain in my present position I shall not attempt to retract or modify the Emancipation Proclamation, nor shall I return to Slavery any Person who is Free by the terms of that Proclamation, or by any of the Acts of Congress.'  If the People should, by whatever mode or means, make it an Executive duty to Reenslave such Persons, another, and not I, must be their instrument to perform it.  In stating a single condition of Peace I mean simply to say that the War will cease on the part of the Government, whenever it shall have ceased on the part of those who began it.\"  On the 22d of December, 1864, in accordance with the terms of a Concurrent Resolution that had passed both Houses, Congress adjourned until January 5, 1865.  During the Congressional Recess, however, Mr. Lincoln, anxious for the fate of the Thirteenth Amendment, exerted himself, as it afterward appeared, to some purpose, in its behalf, by inviting private conferences with him, at the White House, of such of the Border-State and other War-Democratic Representatives as had before voted against the measure, but whose general character gave him ground for hoping that they might not be altogether deaf to the voice of reason and patriotism.       [Among those for whom he sent was Mr. Rollins, of      Missouri, who afterward gave the following interesting account of      the interview:       \"The President had several times in my presence expressed his deep      anxiety in favor of the passage of this great measure.  He and      others had repeatedly counted votes in order to ascertain, as far      as they could, the strength of the measure upon a second trial in      the House.  He was doubtful about its passage, and some ten days or      two weeks before it came up for consideration in the House, I      received a note from him, written in pencil on a card, while      sitting at my desk in the House, stating that he wished to see me,      and asking that I call on him at the White House.  I responded that      I would be there the next morning at nine o'clock.       \"I was prompt in calling upon him and found him alone in his      office.  He received me in the most cordial manner, and said in his      usual familiar way: 'Rollins, I have been wanting to talk to you      for some time about the Thirteenth Amendment proposed to the      Constitution of the United States, which will have to be voted on      now, before a great while.'       \"I said: 'Well, I am here, and ready to talk upon that subject.       \"He said: 'You and I were old Whigs, both of us followers of that      great statesman, Henry Clay, and I tell you I never had an opinion      upon the subject of Slavery in my life that I did not get from him.      I am very anxious that the War should be brought to a close at the      earliest possible date, and I don't believe this can be      accomplished as long as those fellows down South can rely upon      the Border-States to help them; but if the Members from the      Border-States would unite, at least enough of them to pass the      Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, they would soon see that      they could not expect much help from that quarter, and be willing      to give up their opposition and quit their War upon the Government;      that is my chief hope and main reliance to bring the War to a      speedy close, and I have sent for you as an old Whig friend to come      and see me, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7139"],["title","The Great Conspiracy, Volume 7 (#1)"],["body","I might make an appeal to you to vote for this      Amendment.  It is going to be very close; a few votes one way or      the other will decide it.'       \"To this, I responded: 'Mr. President, so far as I am concerned,      you need not have sent for me to ascertain my views on this      subject, for although I represent perhaps the strongest      Slave-district in Missouri, and have the misfortune to be one of the      largest Slave-owners in the country where I reside, I had already      determined to vote for the Amendment.       \"He arose from his chair, and grasping me by the hand, gave it a      hearty shake, and said: 'I am most delighted to hear that.'       \"He asked me how many more of the Missouri delegates in the House      would vote for it.       \"I said I could not tell; the Republicans of course would; General      Loan, Mr. Blow, Mr. Boyd, and Colonel McClurg.       \"He said, 'Won't General Price vote for it?  He is a good Union      man.' I said I could not answer.       \"'Well, what about General King?'       \"I told him I did not know.       \"He then asked about Judges Hall and Norton.       \"I said they would both vote against it, I thought.       \"'Well,' he said, 'are you on good terms with Price and King?'       \"I responded in the affirmative, and that I was on easy terms with      the entire delegation.       \"He then asked me if I would not talk with those who might be      persuaded to vote for the amendment, and report to him as soon as I      could find out what the prospect was.'       \"I answered that I would do so with pleasure, and remarked at the      same time, that when I was a young man, in 1848, I was the Whig      competitor of King for Governor of Missouri, and, as he beat me      very badly, I thought now he should pay me back by voting as I      desired him on this important question.       \"I promised the President I would talk to this gentleman upon the      subject.       \"He said: 'I would like you to talk to all the Border-State men      whom you can approach properly, and tell them of my anxiety to have      the measure pass; and let me know the prospect of the Border-State      vote,' which I promised to do.       \"He again said: 'The passage of this Amendment will clinch the      whole subject; it will bring the War, I have no doubt, rapidly to a      close.'\"--Arnold's Life of Lincoln, pp. 358-359,]  On the 5th of January, 1865, the Christmas Recess having expired, Congress re-assembled.  The motion to reconsider the vote-by which the Joint Resolution, to amend the Constitution by the abolition of Slavery, had been defeated--was not called up, on that day, as its friends had not all returned; but the time was mainly consumed in able speeches, by Mr. Creswell of Maryland, and Stevens of Pennsylvania, in which the former declared that \"whether we would or not, we must establish Freedom if we would exterminate Treason.  Events have left us no choice.  The People have learned their duty and have instructed us accordingly.\"  And Mr. Thaddeus Stevens solemnly said: \"We are about to ascertain the National will, by another vote to amend the Constitution.  If gentlemen opposite will yield to the voice of God and Humanity, and vote for it, I verily believe the sword of the Destroying Angel will be stayed, and this People be reunited.  If we still harden our hearts, and blood must still flow, may the ghosts of the slaughtered victims sit heavily upon the souls of those who cause it!\"  On the 6th of January, Mr. Ashley called up his motion to reconsider the vote defeating the Thirteenth Amendment, and opened the debate with a lengthy and able speech in favor of that measure, in concluding which he said:  \"The genius of history, with iron pen, is waiting to record our verdict where it will remain forever for all the coming generations of men to approve or condemn.  God grant that this verdict may be one over which the friends of Liberty, impartial and universal, in this Country and Europe, and in every Land beneath the sun, may rejoice; a verdict which shall declare that America is Free; a verdict which shall add another day of jubilee, and the brightest of all, to our National calendar.\"  The debate was participated in by nearly all the prominent men, on both sides of the House--the speeches of Messrs. Cox, Brooks, Voorhees, Mallory, Holman, Woods and Pendleton being the most notable, in opposition to, and those of Scofield, Rollins, Garfield and Stevens, in favor of, the Amendment.  That of Scofield probably stirred up \"the adversary\" more thoroughly than any other; that of Rollins was more calculated to conciliate and capture the votes of hesitating, or Border-State men; that of Garfield was perhaps the most scholarly and eloquent; while that of Stevens was remarkable for its sledge-hammer pungency and characteristic brevity.  Mr. Pendleton, toward the end of his speech, had said of Mr. Stevens: \"Let him be careful, lest when the passions of these times be passed away, and the historian shall go back to discover where was the original infraction of the Constitution, he may find that sin lies at the door of others than the people now in arms.\"  And it was this that brought the sterling old Patriot again to his feet, in vindication of the acts of his liberty-inspired life, and in defense of the power to amend the Constitution, which had been assailed.  The personal antithesis with which he concluded his remarks was in itself most dramatically effective, Said he:  \"So far as the appeals of the learned gentleman (Mr. Pendleton) are concerned, in his pathetic winding up, I will be willing to take my chance, when we all moulder in the dust.  He may have his epitaph written, if it be truly written, 'Here rests the ablest and most pertinacious defender of Slavery, and opponent of Liberty;' and I will be satisfied if my epitaph shall be written thus: 'Here lies one who never rose to any eminence, and who only courted the low ambition to have it said that he had striven to ameliorate the condition of the poor, the lowly, the downtrodden, of every race, and language, and color.\"  As he said these words, the crowded floors and galleries broke out into involuntary applause for the grand \"Old Commoner\"--who only awaited its cessation, to caustically add: \"I shall be content, with such a eulogy on his lofty tomb and such an inscription on my humble grave, to trust our memories to the judgment of after ages.\"  The debate, frequently interrupted by Appropriation Bills, and other important and importunate measures, lasted until the 31st of January, when Mr. Ashley called the previous question on his motion to reconsider.  Mr. Stiles at once moved to table the motion to reconsider.  Mr. Stiles's motion was lost by 57 yeas to 111 nays.  This was in the nature of a test-vote, and the result, when announced, was listened to, with breathless attention, by the crowded House and galleries.  It was too close for either side to be satisfied; but it showed a gain to the friends of the Amendment; that was something.  How the final vote would be, none could tell.  Meanwhile it was known, from the announcements on the floor, that Rogers was absent through his own illness and Voorhees through illness in his family.  The previous question being seconded and the main question ordered, the yeas and nays were called on the motion to reconsider--and the intense silence succeeding the monotonous calling of the names was broken by the voice of the Speaker declaring the motion to reconsider, carried, by 112 yeas to 57 nays.  This vote created a slight sensation.  There was a gain of one, (English), at any rate, from among those not voting on the previous motion.  Now, if there should be but the change of a single vote, from the nays to the yeas, the Amendment would be carried!  The most intensely anxious solicitude was on nearly every face, as Mr. Mallory, at this critical moment, made the point of order that \"a vote to reconsider the vote by which the subject now before the House was disposed of, in June last, requires two-thirds of this Body,\" and emphatically added: \"that two-thirds vote has not been obtained.\"  A sigh of relief swept across the galleries, as the Speaker overruled the point of order.  Other attempted interruptions being resolutely met and defeated by Mr. Ashley, in charge of the Resolution, the \"previous question\" was demanded, seconded, and the main question ordered--which was on the passage of the Resolution.  And now, amid the hush of a breathless and intent anxiety--so absolute that the scratch of the recording pencil could be heard--the Clerk commenced to call the roll!  So consuming was the solicitude, on all sides, for the fate of this portentous measure, that fully one-half the Representatives kept tally at their desks as the vote proceeded, while the heads of the gathered thousands of both sexes, in the galleries, craned forward, as though fearing to lose the startlingly clear responses, while the roll-call progressed.  When it reached the name of English--Governor English, a Connecticut Democrat, who had not voted on the first motion, to table the motion to reconsider, but had voted \"yea\" on the motion to reconsider,--and he responded with a clear-cut \"aye\" on the passage of the Resolution--it looked as though light were coming at last, and applause involuntarily broke forth from the Republican side of the floor, spreading instantly to the galleries, despite the efforts of the Speaker to preserve order.  So, when Ganson of New York, and other Democrats, voted \"aye,\" the applause was renewed again and again, and still louder again, when, with smiling face--which corroborated the thrilling, fast-spreading, whisper, that \"the Amendment is safe!\"--Speaker Colfax directed the Clerk to call his name, as a member of the House, and, in response to that call, voted \"aye!\"  Then came dead silence, as the Clerk passed the result to the Speaker --during which a pin might have been"]]]
