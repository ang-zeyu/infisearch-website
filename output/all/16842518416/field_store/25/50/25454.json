So long, at least, as the fair and the pure one keeps watch in the still House of Life, the dark and the troubled one cannot wholly prevail.  For Edith is given to Harold as the Fylgia, that noiselessly blesses and saves: and thou--\" Hilda checked herself, and lowered her hood over her face, so that it suddenly became invisible.  \"And I?\" asked Haco, moving near to her side.  \"Away, son of Sweyn; thy feet trample the grave of the mighty dead!\"  Then Hilda lingered no longer, but took her way towards the house. Haco's eye followed her in silence.  The cattle, grazing in the great space of the crumbling peristyle, looked up as she passed; the watch- dogs, wandering through the star-lit columns, came snorting round their mistress.  And when she had vanished within the house, Haco turned to his steed:  \"What matters,\" he murmured, \"the answer which the Vala cannot or dare not give?  To me is not destined the love of woman, nor the ambition of life.  All I know of human affection binds me to Harold; all I know of human ambition is to share in his fate.  This love is strong as hate, and terrible as doom,--it is jealous, it admits no rival.  As the shell and the sea-weed interlaced together, we are dashed on the rushing surge; whither? oh, whither?\"     CHAPTER IV.   \"I tell thee, Hilda,\" said the Earl, impatiently, \"I tell thee that I renounce henceforth all faith save in Him whose ways are concealed from our eyes.  Thy seid and thy galdra have not guarded me against peril, nor armed me against sin.  Nay, perchance--but peace: I will no more tempt the dark art, I will no more seek to disentangle the awful truth from the juggling lie.  All so foretold me I will seek to forget,--hope from no prophecy, fear from no warning.  Let the soul go to the future under the shadow of God!\"  \"Pass on thy way as thou wilt, its goal is the same, whether seen or unmarked.  Peradventure thou art wise,\" said the Vala, gloomily.  \"For my country's sake, heaven be my witness, not my own,\" resumed the Earl, \"I have blotted my conscience and sullied my truth.  My country alone can redeem me, by taking my life as a thing hallowed evermore to her service.  Selfish ambition do I lay aside, selfish power shall tempt me no more; lost is the charm that I beheld in a throne, and, save for Edith--\"  \"No! not even for Edith,\" cried the betrothed, advancing, \"not even for Edith shalt thou listen to other voice than that of thy country and thy soul.\"  The Earl turned round abruptly, and his eyes were moist.  \"O Hilda,\" he cried, \"see henceforth my only Vala; let that noble heart alone interpret to us the oracles of the future.\"  The next day Harold returned with Haco and a numerous train of his house-carles to the city.  Their ride was as silent as that of the day before; but on reaching Southwark, Harold turned away from the bridge towards the left, gained the river-side, and dismounted at the house of one of his lithsmen (a franklin, or freed ceorl).  Leaving there his horse, he summoned a boat, and, with Haco, was rowed over towards the fortified palace which then rose towards the west of London, jutting into the Thames, and which seems to have formed the outwork of the old Roman city.  The palace, of remotest antiquity, and blending all work and architecture, Roman, Saxon, and Danish, had been repaired by Canute; and from a high window in the upper story, where were the royal apartments, the body of the traitor Edric Streone (the founder of the house of Godwin) had been thrown into the river.  \"Whither go we, Harold?\" asked the son of Sweyn.  \"We go to visit the young Atheling, the natural heir to the Saxon throne,\" replied Harold in a firm voice.  \"He lodges in the old palace of our kings.\"  \"They say in Normandy that the boy is imbecile.\"  \"That is not true,\" returned Harold.  \"I will present thee to him,-- judge.\"  Haco mused a moment and said:  \"Methinks I divine thy purpose; is it not formed on the sudden, Harold?\"  \"It was the counsel of Edith,\" answered Harold, with evident emotion. \"And yet, if that counsel prevail, I may lose the power to soften the Church and to call her mine.\"  \"So thou wouldest sacrifice even Edith for thy country.\"  \"Since I have sinned, methinks I could,\" said the proud man humbly.  The boat shot into a little creek, or rather canal, which then ran inland, beside the black and rotting walls of the fort.  The two Earl- born leapt ashore, passed under a Roman arch, entered a court the interior of which was rudely filled up by early Saxon habitations of rough timber work, already, since the time of Canute, falling into decay, (as all things did which came under the care of Edward,) and mounting a stair that ran along the outside of the house, gained a low narrow door, which stood open.  In the passage within were one or two of the King's house-carles who had been assigned to the young Atheling, with liveries of blue and Danish axes, and some four or five German servitors, who had attended his father from the Emperor's court.  One of these last ushered the noble Saxons into a low, forlorn ante-hall; and there, to Harold's surprise they found Alred the Archbishop of York, and three thegns of high rank, and of lineage ancient and purely Saxon.  Alred approached Harold with a faint smile on his benign face:  \"Methinks, and may I think aright!--thou comest hither with the same purpose as myself, and you noble thegns.\"  \"And that purpose?\"  \"Is to see and to judge calmly, if, despite his years, we may find in the descendant of the Ironsides such a prince as we may commend to our decaying King as his heir, and to the Witan as a chief fit to defend the land.\"  \"Thou speakest the cause of my own coming.  With your ears will I hear, with your eyes will I see; as ye judge, will judge I,\" said Harold, drawing the prelate towards the thegns, so that they might hear his answer.  The chiefs, who belonged to a party that had often opposed Godwin's House, had exchanged looks of fear and trouble when Harold entered; but at his words their frank faces showed equal surprise and pleasure.  Harold presented to them his nephew, with whose grave dignity of bearing beyond his years they were favourably impressed, though the good bishop sighed when he saw in his face the sombre beauty of the guilty sire.  The group then conversed anxiously on the declining health of the King, the disturbed state of the realm, and the expediency, if possible, of uniting all suffrages in favour of the fittest successor.  And in Harold's voice and manner, as in Harold's heart, there was nought that seemed conscious of his own mighty stake and just hopes in that election.  But as time wore, the faces of the thegns grew overcast; proud men and great satraps [210] were they, and they liked it ill that the boy-prince kept them so long in the dismal ante-room.  At length the German officer, who had gone to announce their coming, returned; and in words, intelligible indeed from the affinity between Saxon and German, but still disagreeably foreign to English ears, requested them to follow him into the presence of the Atheling.  In a room yet retaining the rude splendour with which it had been invested by Canute, a handsome boy, about the age of thirteen or fourteen, but seeming much younger, was engaged in the construction of a stuffed bird, a lure for a young hawk that stood blindfold on its perch.  The employment made so habitual a part of the serious education of youth, that the thegns smoothed their brows at the sight, and deemed the boy worthily occupied.  At another end of the room, a grave Norman priest was seated at a table on which were books and writing implements; he was the tutor commissioned by Edward to teach Norman tongue and saintly lore to the Atheling.  A profusion of toys strewed the floor, and some children of Edgar's own age were playing with them.  His little sister Margaret [211] was seated seriously, apart from all the other children, and employed in needlework.  When Alred approached the Atheling, with a blending of reverent obeisance and paternal cordiality, the boy carelessly cried, in a barbarous jargon, half German, half Norman-French:  \"There, come not too near, you scare my hawk.  What are you doing? You trample my toys, which the good Norman bishop William sent me as a gift from the Duke.  Art thou blind, man?\"  \"My son,\" said the prelate kindly, \"these are the things of childhood --childhood ends sooner with princes than with common men.  Leave thy lure and thy toys, and welcome these noble thegns, and address them, so please you, in our own Saxon tongue.\"  \"Saxon tongue!--language of villeins! not I.  Little do I know of it, save to scold a ceorl or a nurse.  King Edward did not tell me to learn Saxon, but Norman! and Godfroi yonder says, that if I know Norman well, Duke William will make me his knight.  But I don't desire to learn anything more to-day.\"  And the child turned peevishly from thegn and prelate.  The three Saxon lords interchanged looks of profound displeasure and proud disgust. But Harold, with an effort over himself, approached, and said winningly:  \"Edgar the Atheling, thou art not so young but thou knowest already that the great live for others.  Wilt thou not be proud to live for this fair country, and these noble men, and to speak the language of Alfred the Great?\"  \"Alfred the Great! they always weary me with Alfred the Great,\" said the boy, pouting.  \"Alfred the Great, he is the plague of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7681"],["title","Harold : the Last of the Saxon Kings — Volume 10 (#5)"],["body"," life! if I am Atheling, men are to live for me, not I for them; and if you tease me any more, I will run away to Duke William in Rouen; Godfroi says I shall never be teased there!\"  So saying, already tired of hawk and lure, the child threw himself on the floor with the other children, and snatched the toys from their hands.  The serious Margaret then rose quietly, and went to her brother, and said, in good Saxon:  \"Fie! if you behave thus, I shall call you NIDDERING!\"  At the threat of that word, the vilest in the language--that word which the lowest ceorl would forfeit life rather than endure--a threat applied to the Atheling of England, the descendant of Saxon heroes--the three thegns drew close, and watched the boy, hoping to see that he would start to his feet with wrath and in shame.  \"Call me what you will, silly sister,\" said the child, indifferently, \"I am not so Saxon as to care for your ceorlish Saxon names.\"  \"Enow,\" cried the proudest and greatest of the thegns, his very moustache curling with ire.  \"He who can be called niddering shall never be crowned king!\"  \"I don't want to be crowned king, rude man, with your laidly moustache: I want to be made knight, and have banderol and baldric.-- Go away!\"  \"We go, son,\" said Alred, mournfully.  And with slow and tottering step he moved to the door; there he halted, turned back,--and the child was pointing at him in mimicry, while Godfroi, the Norman tutor, smiled as in pleasure.  The prelate shook his head, and the group gained again the ante-hall.  \"Fit leader of bearded men! fit king for the Saxon land!\" cried a thegn.  \"No more of your Atheling, Alred my father!\"  \"No more of him, indeed!\" said the prelate, mournfully.  \"It is but the fault of his nurture and rearing,--a neglected childhood, a Norman tutor, German hirelings.  We may remould yet the pliant clay,\" said Harold.  \"Nay,\" returned Alred, \"no leisure for such hopes, no time to undo what is done by circumstance, and, I fear, by nature.  Ere the year is out the throne will stand empty in our halls.\"  \"Who then,\" said Haco, abruptly, \"who then,--(pardon the ignorance of youth wasted in captivity abroad!) who then, failing the Atheling, will save this realm from the Norman Duke, who, I know well, counts on it as the reaper on the harvest ripening to his sickle?\"  \"Alas, who then?\" murmured Alred.  \"Who then?\" cried the three thegns, with one voice, \"why the worthiest, the wisest, the bravest!  Stand forth, Harold the Earl, Thou art the man!\"  And without awaiting his answer, they strode from the hall.     CHAPTER V.   Around Northampton lay the forces of Morcar, the choice of the Anglo- Dane men of Northumbria.  Suddenly there was a shout as to arms from the encampment; and Morcar, the young Earl, clad in his link mail, save his helmet, came forth, and cried:  \"My men are fools to look that way for a foe; yonder lies Mercia, behind it the hills of Wales.  The troops that come hitherward are those which Edwin my brother brings to our aid.\"  Morcar's words were carried into the host by his captains and warbodes, and the shout changed from alarm into joy.  As the cloud of dust through which gleamed the spears of the coming force rolled away, and lay lagging behind the march of the host, there rode forth from the van two riders.  Fast and far from the rest they rode, and behind them, fast as they could, spurred two others, who bore on high, one the pennon of Mercia, one the red lion of North Wales.  Right to the embankment and palisade which begirt Mortar's camp rode the riders; and the head of the foremost was bare, and the guards knew the face of Edwin the Comely, Mortar's brother.  Morcar stepped down from the mound on which he stood, and the brothers embraced amidst the halloos of the forces.  \"And welcome, I pray thee,\" said Morcar, \"our kinsman Caradoc, son of Gryffyth [212] the bold.\"  So Morcar reached his hand to Caradoc, stepson to his sister Aldyth, and kissed him on the brow, as was the wont of our fathers.  The young and crownless prince was scarce out of boyhood, but already his name was sung by the bards, and circled in the halls of Gwynedd with the Hirlas horn; for he had harried the Saxon borders, and given to fire and sword even the fortress of Harold himself.  But while these three interchanged salutations, and ere yet the mixed Mercians and Welch had gained the encampment, from a curve in the opposite road, towards Towcester and Dunstable, broke the flash of mail like a river of light, trumpets and fifes were heard in the distance; and all in Morcar's host stood hushed but stern, gazing anxious and afar, as the coming armament swept on.  And from the midst were seen the Martlets and Cross of England's king, and the Tiger heads of Harold; banners which, seen together, had planted victory on every tower, on every field, towards which they had rushed on the winds.  Retiring, then, to the central mound, the chiefs of the insurgent force held their brief council.  The two young Earls, whatever their ancestral renown, being yet new themselves to fame and to power, were submissive to the Anglo-Dane chiefs, by whom Morcar had been elected.  And these, on recognising the standard of Harold, were unanimous in advice to send a peaceful deputation, setting forth their wrongs under Tostig, and the justice of their cause.  \"For the Earl,\" said Gamel Beorn (the head and front of that revolution,)  is a just man, and one who would shed his own blood rather than that of any other freeborn dweller in England; and he will do us right.\"  \"What, against his own brother?\" cried Edwin.  \"Against his own brother, if we convince but his reason,\" returned the Anglo-Dane.  And the other chiefs nodded assent.  Caradoc's fierce eyes flashed fire; but he played with his torque, and spoke not.  Meanwhile, the vanguard of the King's force had defiled under the very walls of Northampton, between the town and the insurgents; and some of the light-armed scouts who went forth from Morcar's camp to gaze on the procession, with that singular fearlessness which characterised, at that period, the rival parties in civil war, returned to say that they had seen Harold himself in the foremost line, and that he was not in mail.  This circumstance the insurgent thegns received as a good omen; and, having already agreed on the deputation, about a score of the principal thegns of the north went sedately towards the hostile lines.  By the side of Harold,--armed in mail, with his face concealed by the strange Sicilian nose-piece used then by most of the Northern nations,--had ridden Tostig, who had joined the Earl on his march, with a scanty band of some fifty or sixty of his Danish house-carles. All the men throughout broad England that he could command or bribe to his cause, were those fifty or sixty hireling Danes.  And it seemed that already there was dispute between the brothers, for Harold's face was flushed, and his voice stern, as he said, \"Rate me as thou wilt, brother, but I cannot advance at once to the destruction of my fellow Englishmen without summons and attempt at treaty,--as has ever been the custom of our ancient heroes and our own House.\"  \"By all the fiends of the North?\" exclaimed Tostig, \"it is foul shame to talk of treaty and summons to robbers and rebels.  For what art thou here but for chastisement and revenge?\"  \"For justice and right, Tostig.\"  \"Ha! thou comest not, then, to aid thy brother?\"  \"Yes, if justice and right are, as I trust, with him.\"  Before Tostig could reply, a line was suddenly cleared through the armed men, and, with bare heads, and a monk lifting the rood on high, amidst the procession advanced the Northumbrian Danes.  \"By the red sword of St. Olave!\" cried Tostig, \"yonder come the traitors, Gamel Beorn and Gloneion!  You will not hear them?  If so, I will not stay to listen.  I have but my axe for my answer to such knaves.\"  \"Brother, brother, those men are the most valiant and famous chiefs in thine earldom.  Go, Tostig, thou art not now in the mood to hear reason.  Retire into the city; summon its gates to open to the King's flag.  I will hear the men.\"  \"Beware how thou judge, save in thy brother's favour!\" growled the fierce warrior; and, tossing his arm on high with a contemptuous gesture, he spurred away towards the gates.  Then Harold, dismounting, stood on the ground, under the standard of his King, and round him came several of the Saxon chiefs, who had kept aloof during the conference with Tostig.  The Northumbrians approached, and saluted the Earl with grave courtesy.  Then Gamel Beorn began.  But much as Harold had feared and foreboded as to the causes of complaint which Tostig had given to the Northumbrians, all fear, all foreboding, fell short of the horrors now deliberately unfolded; not only extortion of tribute the most rapacious and illegal, but murder the fiercest and most foul.  Thegns of high birth, without offence or suspicion, but who had either excited Tostig's jealousy, or resisted his exactions, had been snared under peaceful pretexts into his castle [213], and butchered in cold blood by his house-carles.  The cruelties of the old heathen Danes seemed revived in the bloody and barbarous tale.  \"And now,\" said the thegn, in conclusion, \"canst thou condemn us that we rose?--no partial rising;--rose all Northumbria!  At first but two hundred thegns; strong in our course, we swelled into the might of a people.  Our wrongs found sympathy beyond our province, for liberty spreads over human hearts as fire over a heath.  Wherever we march, friends gather round us.  Thou warrest not on a handful of rebels,-- half England is with us!\"  \"And ye,--thegns,\" answered Harold, \"ye have ceased to war against Tostig, your Earl.  Ye war now against the King and the Law.  Come with your complaints to your Prince and your Witan, and, if they are just, ye are stronger than in yonder palisades and streets of steel.\"  \"And so,\" said Gamel Beorn, with marked emphasis, \"now thou "]]]
