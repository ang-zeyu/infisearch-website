Praise be to the saints,” said Countess Alice, “your little maid—”  “Aye, that’s what they said as to the poor good Duke Humfrey,” returned the irate lady; “but that you, madam, the good-sister of the noble York, should stand up for the enemies of him, and the friends of France, is more than a plain North Country woman like me can understand.  And there—there, turning round upon the steep steps, there is my Lord Earl hand and glove with that minion fellow of Somerset, who was no doubt at the bottom of the plot!  None would believe it at Raby.”  “None at Raby would believe that my lord could be lacking in courtesy to a guest,” returned Lady Salisbury with dignity, “nor that a North Country dame could expect it of him.  Those who are under his roof must respect it by fitting demeanour towards one another.”  The Lady of Whitburn was quenched for the time, and the Countess asked whether she did not wish to see her daughter, leading the way to a chamber hung with tapestry, and with a great curtained bed nearly filling it up, for the patient had been installed in one of the best guest-chambers of the Castle.  Lady Whitburn was surprised, but was too proud to show herself gratified by what she thought was the due of the dignity of the Dacres.  An old woman in a hood sat by the bed, where there was a heap of clothes, and a dark-haired little girl stood by the window, whence she had been describing the arrivals in the Castle court.  “Here is your mother, my poor child,” began the Lady of Salisbury, but there was no token of joy.  Grisell gave a little gasp, and tried to say “Lady Mother, pardon—” but the Lady of Whitburn, at sight of the reddened half of the face which alone was as yet visible, gave a cry, “She will be a fright!  You evil little baggage, thus to get yourself scarred and made hideous!  Running where you ought not, I warrant!” and she put out her hand as if to shake the patient, but the Countess interposed, and her niece Margaret gave a little cry.  “Grisell is still very weak and feeble!  She cannot bear much; we have only just by Heaven’s grace brought her round.”  “As well she were dead as like this,” cried this untender parent.  “Who is to find her a husband now? and as to a nunnery, where is one to take her without a dower such as is hard to find, with two sons to be fitly provided?  I looked that in a household like this, better rule should be kept.”  “None can mourn it more than myself and the Earl,” said the gentle Countess; “but young folks can scarce be watched hour by hour.”  “The rod is all that is good for them, and I trusted to you to give it them, madam,” said Lady Whitburn.  “Now, the least that can be done is to force yonder malapert lad and his father into keeping his contract to her, since he has spoilt the market for any other.”  “Is he contracted to her?” asked the Countess.  “Not fully; but as you know yourself, lady, your lord, and the King, and all the rest, thought to heal the breach between the houses by planning a contract between their son and my daughter.  He shall keep it now, at his peril.”  Grisell was cowering among her pillows, and no one knew how much she heard or understood.  The Countess was glad to get Lady Whitburn out of the room, but both she and her Earl had a very trying evening, in trying to keep the peace between the two parents.  Sir William Copeland was devoted to the Somerset family, of whom he held his manor; and had had a furious quarrel with the Baron of Whitburn, when both were serving in France.  The gentle King had tried to bring about a reconciliation, and had induced the two fathers to consent to a contract for the future marriage of Leonard, Copeland’s second son, to Grisell Dacre, then the only child of the Lord of Whitburn.  He had also obtained that the two children should be bred up in the household of the Earl of Salisbury, by way of letting them grow up together.  On the same principle the Lady of Whitburn had been made one of the attendants of Queen Margaret—but neither arrangement had been more successful than most of those of poor King Henry.  Grisell indeed considered Leonard as a sort of property of hers, but she beset him in the manner that boys are apt to resent from younger girls, and when he was thirteen, and she ten years old, there was very little affection on his side.  Moreover, the birth of two brothers had rendered Grisell’s hand a far less desirable prize in the eyes of the Copelands.  To attend on the Court was penance to the North Country dame, used to a hardy rough life in her sea-side tower, with absolute rule, and no hand over her save her husband’s; while the young and outspoken Queen, bred up in the graceful, poetical Court of Aix or Nancy, looked on her as no better than a barbarian, and if she did not show this openly, reporters were not wanting to tell her that the Queen called her the great northern hag, or that her rugged unwilling curtsey was said to look as if she were stooping to draw water at a well.  Her husband had kept her in some restraint, but when be had gone to Ireland with the Duke of York, offences seemed to multiply upon her.  The last had been that when she had tripped on her train, dropped the salver wherewith she was serving the Queen, and broken out with a loud “Lawk a daisy!” all the ladies, and Margaret herself, had gone into fits of uncontrollable laughter, and the Queen had begged her to render her exclamation into good French for her benefit.  “Madam,” she had exclaimed, “if a plain woman’s plain English be not good enough for you, she can have no call here!”  And without further ceremony she had flown out of the royal presence.  Margaret of Anjou, naturally offended, and never politic, had sent her a message, that her attendance was no longer required.  So here she was going out of her way to make a casual inquiry, from the Court at Winchester, whether that very unimportant article, her only daughter, were dead or alive.  The Earl absolutely prohibited all conversation on affairs in debate during the supper which was spread in the hall, with quite as much state as, and even greater profusion and splendour, than was to be found at Windsor, Winchester, or Westminster.  All the high born sat on the dais, raised on two steps with gorgeous tapestry behind, and a canopy overhead; the Earl and Countess on chairs in the centre of the long narrow table. Lady Whitburn sat beside the Earl, Sir William Copeland by the Countess, watching with pleasure how deftly his son ran about among the pages, carrying the trenchers of food, and the cups.  He entered on a conversation with the Countess, telling her of the King’s interest and delight in his beautiful freshly-founded Colleges at Eton and Cambridge, how the King rode down whenever he could to see the boys, listen to them at their tasks in the cloisters, watch them at their sports in the playing fields, and join in their devotions in the Chapel—a most holy example for them.  “Ay, for such as seek to be monks and shavelings,” broke in the North Country voice sarcastically.  “There are others—sons of gentlemen and esquires—lodged in houses around,” said Sir William, “who are not meant for cowl or for mass-priests.”  “Yea, forsooth,” called Lady Whitburn across the Earl and the Countess, “what for but to make them as feckless as the priests, unfit to handle lance or sword!”  “So, lady, you think that the same hand cannot wield pen and lance,” said the Earl.  “I should like to see one of your clerks on a Border foray,” laughed the Dame of Dacre.  “’Tis all a device of the Frenchwoman!”  “Verily?” said the Earl, in an interrogative tone.  “Ay, to take away the strength and might of Englishmen with this clerkly lore, so that her folk may have the better of them in France; and the poor, witless King gives in to her.  And so while the Beauforts rule the roast—”  Salisbury caught her up.  “Ay, the roast.  Will you partake of these roast partridges, madam?”  They were brought round skewered on a long spit, held by a page for the guest to help herself.  Whether by her awkwardness or that of the boy, it so chanced that the bird made a sudden leap from the impalement, and deposited itself in the lap of Lady Whitburn’s scarlet kirtle!  The fact was proclaimed by her loud rude cry, “A murrain on thee, thou ne’er-do-weel lad,” together with a sounding box on the ear.  “’Tis thine own greed, who dost not—”  “Leonard, be still—know thy manners,” cried both at once the Earl and Sir William, for, unfortunately, the offender was no other than Leonard Copeland, and, contrary to all the laws of pagedom, he was too angry not to argue the point.  “’Twas no doing of mine!  She knew not how to cut the bird.”  Answering again was a far greater fault than the first, and his father only treated it as his just desert when he was ordered off under the squire in charge to be soundly scourged, all the more sharply for his continuing to mutter, “It was her fault.”  And sore and furrowed as was his back, he continued to exclaim, when his friend Edmund of York came to condole with him as usual in all his scrapes, “’Tis she that should have been scourged for clumsiness!  A foul, uncouth Border dame!  Well, one blessing at least is that now I shall never be wedded to her daughter—let the wench live or die as she lists!”  That was not by any means the opinion of the Lady of Whitburn, and no sooner was the meal ended than, in the midst of the hall, the debate began, the Lady declaring that in all honour Sir William Copeland was bound to affiance his son instantly to her poor daughter, all the more since the injuries he had inflicted to her face could never be done away with.  On the other hand, Sir William Copeland was naturally far less likely to accept such a daughter-in-law, since"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7387"],["title","Grisly Grisell; Or, The Laidly Lady of Whitburn: A Tale of the Wars of the Roses (#3)"],["body","chances of being an heiress had ceased, and he contended that he had never absolutely accepted the contract, and that there had been no betrothal of the children.  The Earl of Salisbury could not but think that a strictly honourable man would have felt poor Grisell’s disaster inflicted by his son’s hands all the more reason for holding to the former understanding; but the loud clamours and rude language of Lady Whitburn were enough to set any one in opposition to her, and moreover, the words he said in favour of her side of the question appeared to Copeland merely spoken out of the general enmity of the Nevils to the Beauforts and all their following.  Thus, all the evening Lady Whitburn raged, and appealed to the Earl, whose support she thought cool and unfriendly, while Copeland stood sullen and silent, but determined.  “My lord,” she said, “were you a true friend to York and Raby, you would deal with this scowling fellow as we should on the Border.”  “We are not on the Border, madam,” quietly said Salisbury.  “But you are in your own Castle, and can force him to keep faith.  No contract, forsooth!  I hate your mincing South Country forms of law.” Then perhaps irritated by a little ironical smile which Salisbury could not suppress.  “Is this your castle, or is it not?  Then bring him and his lad to my poor wench’s side, and see their troth plighted, or lay him by the heels in the lowest cell in your dungeon.  Then will you do good service to the King and the Duke of York, whom you talk of loving in your shilly-shally fashion.”  “Madam,” said the Earl, his grave tones coming in contrast to the shrill notes of the angry woman, “I counsel you, in the south at least, to have some respect to these same forms of law.  I bid you a fair good-night. The chamberlain will marshal you.”     CHAPTER III THE MIRROR       “Of all the maids, the foulest maid        From Teviot unto Dee.     Ah!” sighing said that lady then,        “Can ne’er young Harden’s be.”                                              SCOTT, _The Reiver’s Wedding_.  “THEY are gone,” said Margaret of York, standing half dressed at the deep-set window of the chamber where Grisell lay in state in her big bed.  “Who are gone?” asked Grisell, turning as well as she could under the great heraldically-embroidered covering.  “Leonard Copeland and his father.  Did’st not hear the horses’ tramp in the court?”  “I thought it was only my lord’s horses going to the water.”  “It was the Copelands going off without breaking their fast or taking a stirrup cup, like discourteous rogues as they be,” said Margaret, in no measured language.  “And are they gone?  And wherefore?” asked Grisell.  “Wherefore? but for fear my noble uncle of Salisbury should hold them to their contract.  Sir William sat as surly as a bear just about to be baited, while thy mother rated and raved at him like a very sleuth-hound on the chase.  And Leonard—what think’st thou he saith?  “That he would as soon wed the loathly lady as thee,” the cruel Somerset villain as he is; and yet my brother Edmund is fain to love him.  So off they are gone, like recreant curs as they are, lest my uncle should make them hear reason.”  “But Lady Madge, dear Lady Madge, am I so very loathly?” asked poor Grisell.  “Mine aunt of Salisbury bade that none should tell thee,” responded Margaret, in some confusion.  “Ah me!  I must know sooner or later!  My mother, she shrieked at sight of me!”  “I would not have your mother,” said the outspoken daughter of “proud Cis.”  “My Lady Duchess mother is stern enough if we do not bridle our heads, and if we make ourselves too friendly with the meiné, but she never frets nor rates us, and does not heed so long as we do not demean ourselves unlike our royal blood.  She is no termagant like yours.”  It was not polite, but Grisell had not seen enough of her mother to be very sensitive on her account.  In fact, she was chiefly occupied with what she had heard about her own appearance—a matter which had not occurred to her before in all her suffering.  She returned again to entreat Margaret to tell her whether she was so foully ill-favoured that no one could look at her, and the damsel of York, adhering to the letter rather young than the spirit of the cautions which she had received, pursed up her lips and reiterated that she had been commanded not to mention the subject.  “Then,” entreated Grisell, “do—do, dear Madge—only bring me the little hand mirror out of my Lady Countess’s chamber.”  “I know not that I can or may.”  “Only for the space of one Ave,” reiterated Grisell.  “My lady aunt would never—”  “There—hark—there’s the bell for mass.  Thou canst run into her chamber when she and the tirewomen are gone down.”  “But I must be there.”  “Thou canst catch them up after.  They will only think thee a slug-a-bed. Madge, dear Madge, prithee, I cannot rest without.  Weeping will be worse for me.”  She was crying, and caressing Margaret so vehemently that she gained her point.  Indeed the other girl was afraid of her sobs being heard, and inquired into, and therefore promised to make the attempt, keeping a watch out of sight till she had seen the Lady of Salisbury in her padded head-gear of gold net, and long purple train, sweep down the stair, followed by her tirewomen and maidens of every degree.  Then darting into the chamber, she bore away from a stage where lay the articles of the toilette, a little silver-backed and handled Venetian mirror, with beautiful tracery in silvered glass diminishing the very small oval left for personal reflection and inspection.  That, however, was quite enough and too much for poor Grisell when Lady Margaret had thrown it to her on her bed, and rushed down the stair so as to come in the rear of the household just in time.  A glance at the mirror disclosed, not the fair rosy face, set in light yellow curls, that Grisell had now and then peeped at in a bucket of water or a polished breast-plate, but a piteous sight.  One half, as she expected, was hidden by bandages, but the other was fiery red, except that from the corner of the eye to the ear there was a purple scar; the upper lip was distorted, the hair, eyebrows, and lashes were all gone! The poor child was found in an agony of sobbing when, after the service, the old woman who acted as her nurse came stumping up in her wooden clogs to set the chamber and bed in order for Lady Whitburn’s visit.  The dame was in hot haste to get home.  Rumours were rife as to Scottish invasions, and her tower was not too far south not to need to be on its guard.  Her plan was to pack Grisell on a small litter slung to a sumpter mule, and she snorted a kind of defiant contempt when the Countess, backed by the household barber-surgeon, declared the proceeding barbarous and impossible.  Indeed she had probably forgotten that Grisell was far too tall to be made up into the bundle she intended; but she then declared that the wench might ride pillion behind old Diccon, and she would not be convinced till she was taken up to the sick chamber.  There the first sound that greeted them was a choking agony of sobs and moans, while the tirewoman stood over the bed, exclaiming, “Aye, no wonder; it serves thee right, thou evil wench, filching my Lady Countess’s mirror from her very chamber, when it might have been broken for all thanks to thee.  The Venice glass that the merchant gave her!  Thou art not so fair a sight, I trow, as to be in haste to see thyself.  At the bottom of all the scathe in the Castle!  We shall be well rid of thee.”  So loud was the objurgation of the tirewoman that she did not hear the approach of her mistress, nor indeed the first words of the Countess, “Hush, Maudlin, the poor child is not to be thus rated!  Silence!”  “See, my lady, what she has done to your ladyship’s Venice glass, which she never should have touched.  She must have run to your chamber while you were at mass.  All false her feigning to be so sick and feeble.”  “Ay,” replied Lady Whitburn, “she must up—don her clothes, and away with me.”  “Hush, I pray you, madam.  How, how, Grisell, my poor child.  Call Master Miles, Maudlin!  Give me that water.”  The Countess was raising the poor child in her arms, and against her bosom, for the shock of that glance in the mirror, followed by the maid’s harsh reproaches, and fright at the arrival of the two ladies, had brought on a choking, hysterical sort of convulsive fit, and the poor girl writhed and gasped on Lady Salisbury’s breast, while her mother exclaimed, “Heed her not, Lady; it is all put on to hinder me from taking her home.  If she could go stealing to your room—”  “No, no,” broke out a weeping, frightened voice.  “It was I, Lady Aunt. You bade me never tell her how her poor face looked, and when she begged and prayed me, I did not say, but I fetched the mirror.  Oh! oh!  It has not been the death of her.”  “Nay, nay, by God’s blessing!  Take away the glass, Margaret.  Go and tell thy beads, child; thou hast done much scathe unwittingly!  Ah, Master Miles, come to the poor maid’s aid.  Canst do aught for her?”  “These humours must be drawn off, my lady,” said the barber-surgeon, who advanced to the bed, and felt the pulse of the poor little patient.  “I must let her blood.”  Maudlin, whose charge she was, came to his help, and Countess Alice still held her up, while, after the practice of those days, he bled the already almost unconscious child, till she fainted and was laid down again on her pillows, under the keeping of Maudlin, while the clanging of the great bell called the family down to the meal which broke fast, whether to be called breakfast or dinner.  It was plain that Grisell was in no state to be taken on a journey, and her mother went grumbling down the stair at the unchancy bairn always doing scathe.  Lord Salisbury, beside whom she sat, courteously, though perhaps hardly willingly, invited her to remain till her daughter was ready to move.  “Nay, my Lord, I am"]]]
