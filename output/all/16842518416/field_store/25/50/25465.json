All the horsemen were in complete link or net mail [263], armed with spears and strong swords, and long, pear-shaped shields, with the device either of a cross or a dragon [264].  The archers, on whom William greatly relied, were numerous in all three of the corps [265], were armed more lightly--helms on their heads, but with leather or quilted breastplates, and \"panels,\" or gaiters, for the lower limbs.  But before the chiefs and captains rode to their several posts they assembled round William, whom Fitzosborne had called betimes, and who had not yet endued his heavy mail, that all men might see suspended from his throat certain relics chosen out of those on which Harold had pledged his fatal oath.  Standing on an eminence in front of all his lines, the consecrated banner behind him, and Bayard, his Spanish destrier, held by his squires at his side, the Duke conversed cheerily with his barons, often pointing to the relics.  Then, in sight of all, he put on his mail, and, by the haste of his squires, the back-piece was presented to him first.  The superstitious Normans recoiled as at an evil omen.  \"Tut!\" said the ready chief; \"not in omens and divinations, but in God, trust I!  Yet, good omen indeed is this, and one that may give heart to the most doubtful; for it betokens that the last shall be first--the dukedom a kingdom--the count a king!  Ho there, Rou de Terni, as Hereditary Standard-bearer take thy right, and hold fast to yon holy gonfanon.\"  \"Grant merci,\" said De Terni, \"not to-day shall a standard be borne by me, for I shall have need of my right arm for my sword, and my left for my charger's rein and my trusty shield.\"  \"Thou sayest right, and we can ill spare such a warrior.  Gautier Giffart, Sire de Longueville, to thee is the gonfanon.\"  \"Beau Sire,\" answered Gautier; \"par Dex, Merci.  But my head is grey and my arm weak; and the little strength left me I would spend in smiting the English at the head of my men.\"  \"Per la resplendar De,\" cried William, frowning;--\"do ye think, my proud vavasours, to fail me in this great need?\"  \"Nay,\" said Gautier; \"but I have a great host of chevaliers and paid soldiers, and without the old man at their head will they fight as well?\"  \"Then, approach thou, Tonstain le Blanc, son of Rou,\" said William; \"and be thine the charge of a standard that shall wave ere nightfall over the brows of thy--King!\"  A young knight, tall and strong as his Danish ancestor, stept forth, and laid gripe on the banner.  Then William, now completely armed, save his helmet, sprang at one bound on his steed.  A shout of admiration rang from the Quens and knights.  \"Saw ye ever such beau rei?\" [266] said the Vicomte de Thouars.  The shout was caught by the lines, and echoed afar, wide, and deep through the armament, as in all his singular majesty of brow and mien, William rode forth: lifting his hand, the shout hushed, and thus he spoke \"loud as a trumpet with a silver sound.\"  \"Normans and soldiers, long renowned in the lips of men, and now hallowed by the blessing of the Church!--I have not brought you over the wide seas for my cause alone; what I gain, ye gain.  If I take the land, you will share it.  Fight your best, and spare not; no retreat, and no quarter!  I am not come here for my cause alone, but to avenge our whole nation for the felonies of yonder English.  They butchered our kinsmen the Danes, on the night of St. Brice; they murdered Alfred, the brother of their last King, and decimated the Normans who were with him.  Yonder they stand,--malefactors that await their doom! and ye the doomsmen!  Never, even in a good cause, were yon English illustrious for warlike temper and martial glory [267].  Remember how easily the Danes subdued them!  Are ye less than Danes, or I than Canute?  By victory ye obtain vengeance, glory, honours, lands, spoil,--aye, spoil beyond your wildest dreams.  By defeat,--yea, even but by loss of ground, ye are given up to the sword!  Escape there is not, for the ships are useless.  Before you the foe, behind you the ocean.  Normans, remember the feats of your countrymen in Sicily! Behold a Sicily more rich!  Lordships and lands to the living,--glory and salvation to those who die under the gonfanon of the Church!  On, to the cry of the Norman warrior; the cry before which have fled so often the prowest Paladins of Burgundy and France--'Notre Dame et Dex aide!'\" [268]  Meanwhile, no less vigilant, and in his own strategy no less skilful, Harold had marshalled his men.  He formed two divisions; those in front of the entrenchments; those within it.  At the first, the men of Kent, as from time immemorial, claimed the honour of the van, under \"the Pale Charger,\"--famous banner of Hengist.  This force was drawn up in the form of the Anglo-Danish wedge; the foremost lines in the triangle all in heavy mail, armed with their great axes, and covered by their immense shields.  Behind these lines, in the interior of the wedge, were the archers, protected by the front rows of the heavy armed; while the few horsemen--few indeed compared with the Norman cavalry--were artfully disposed where they could best harass and distract the formidable chivalry with which they were instructed to skirmish, and not peril actual encounter.  Other bodies of the light armed; slingers, javelin throwers, and archers, were planted in spots carefully selected, according as they were protected by trees, bushwood, and dykes.  The Northumbrians (that is, all the warlike population, north the Humber, including Yorkshire, Westmoreland, Cumberland, etc.), were, for their present shame and future ruin, absent from that field, save, indeed, a few who had joined Harold in his march to London.  But there were the mixed races of Hertfordshire and Essex, with the pure Saxons of Sussex and Surrey, and a large body of the sturdy Anglo-Danes from Lincolnshire, Ely and Norfolk.  Men, too, there were, half of old British blood, from Dorset, Somerset, and Gloucester.  And all were marshalled according to those touching and pathetic tactics which speak of a nation more accustomed to defend than to aggrieve.  To that field the head of each family led his sons and kinsfolk; every ten families (or tything) were united under their own chosen captain.  Every ten of these tythings had, again, some loftier chief, dear to the populace in peace; and so on the holy circle spread from household, hamlet, town,--till, all combined, as one county under one Earl, the warriors fought under the eyes of their own kinsfolk, friends, neighbours, chosen chiefs!  What wonder that they were brave?  The second division comprised Harold's house-carles, or bodyguard,-- the veterans especially attached to his family,--the companions of his successful wars,--a select band of the martial East-Anglians,--the soldiers supplied by London and Middlesex, and who, both in arms, discipline, martial temper and athletic habits, ranked high among the most stalwart of the troops, mixed, as their descent was, from the warlike Dane and the sturdy Saxon.  In this division, too, was comprised the reserve.  And it was all encompassed by the palisades and breastworks, to which were but three sorties, whence the defenders might sally, or through which at need the vanguard might secure a retreat.  All the heavy armed had mail and shields similar to the Normans, though somewhat less heavy; the light armed had, some tunics of quilted linen, some of hide; helmets of the last material, spears, javelins, swords, and clubs.  But the main arm of the host was in the great shield, and the great axe wielded by men larger in stature and stronger of muscle than the majority of the Normans, whose physical race had deteriorated partly by inter-marriage with the more delicate Frank, partly by the haughty disdain of foot exercise.  Mounting a swift and light steed, intended not for encounter (for it was the custom of English kings to fight on foot, in token that where they fought there was no retreat), but to bear the rider rapidly from line to line [269], King Harold rode to the front of the vanguard;-- his brothers by his side.  His head, like his great foe's, was bare, nor could there be a more striking contrast than that of the broad unwrinkled brow of the Saxon, with his fair locks, the sign of royalty and freedom, parted and falling over the collar of mail, the clear and steadfast eye of blue, the cheek somewhat hollowed by kingly cares, but flushed now with manly pride--the form stalwart and erect, but spare in its graceful symmetry, and void of all that theatric pomp of bearing which was assumed by William--no greater contrast could there be than that which the simple earnest Hero-king presented, to the brow furrowed with harsh ire and politic wile, the shaven hair of monastic affectation, the dark, sparkling tiger eye, and the vast proportions that awed the gaze in the port and form of the imperious Norman.  Deep and loud and hearty as the shout with which his armaments had welcomed William, was that which now greeted the King of the English host: and clear and full, and practised in the storm of popular assemblies, went his voice down the listening lines.  \"This day, O friends and Englishmen, sons of our common land--this day ye fight for liberty.  The Count of the Normans hath, I know, a mighty army; I disguise not its strength.  That army he hath collected together, by promising to each man a share in the spoils of England. Already, in his court and his camp, he hath parcelled out the lands of this kingdom; and fierce are the robbers who fight for the hope of plunder!  But he cannot offer to his greatest chief boons nobler than those I offer to my meanest freeman--liberty, and right, and law, in the soil of his fathers!

C. T. D’EYNCOURT, M.P.  I dedicate to you, my dear friend, a work, principally composed under your hospitable roof; and to the materials of which your library, rich in the authorities I most needed, largely contributed.  The idea of founding an historical romance on an event so important and so national as the Norman Invasion, I had long entertained, and the chronicles of that time had long been familiar to me.  But it is an old habit of mine, to linger over the plan and subject of a work, for years, perhaps, before the work has, in truth, advanced a sentence; “busying myself,” as old Burton saith, “with this playing labour--otiosaque diligentia ut vitarem torporen feriendi.”  The main consideration which long withheld me from the task, was in my sense of the unfamiliarity of the ordinary reader with the characters, events, and, so to speak, with the very physiognomy of a period ante Agamemnona; before the brilliant age of matured chivalry, which has given to song and romance the deeds of the later knighthood, and the glorious frenzy of the Crusades.  The Norman Conquest was our Trojan War; an epoch beyond which our learning seldom induces our imagination to ascend.  In venturing on ground so new to fiction, I saw before me the option of apparent pedantry, in the obtrusion of such research as might carry the reader along with the Author, fairly and truly into the real records of the time; or of throwing aside pretensions to accuracy altogether;--and so rest contented to turn history into flagrant romance, rather than pursue my own conception of extracting its natural romance from the actual history.  Finally, not without some encouragement from you, (whereof take your due share of blame!) I decided to hazard the attempt, and to adopt that mode of treatment which, if making larger demand on the attention of the reader, seemed the more complimentary to his judgment.  The age itself, once duly examined, is full of those elements which should awaken interest, and appeal to the imagination.  Not untruly has Sismondi said, that the “Eleventh Century has a right to be considered a great age.  It was a period of life and of creation; all that there was of noble, heroic, and vigorous in the Middle Ages commenced at that epoch.” [1]  But to us Englishmen in especial, besides the more animated interest in that spirit of adventure, enterprise, and improvement, of which the Norman chivalry was the noblest type, there is an interest more touching and deep in those last glimpses of the old Saxon monarchy, which open upon us in the mournful pages of our chroniclers.  I have sought in this work, less to portray mere manners, which modern researches have rendered familiar to ordinary students in our history, than to bring forward the great characters, so carelessly dismissed in the long and loose record of centuries; to show more clearly the motives and policy of the agents in an event the most memorable in Europe; and to convey a definite, if general, notion of the human beings, whose brains schemed, and whose hearts beat, in that realm of shadows which lies behind the Norman Conquest;      “Spes hominum caecos, morbos, votumque, labores,      Et passim toto volitantes aethere curas.” [2]  I have thus been faithful to the leading historical incidents in the grand tragedy of Harold, and as careful as contradictory evidences will permit, both as to accuracy in the delineation of character, and correctness in that chronological chain of dates without which there can be no historical philosophy; that is, no tangible link between the cause and the effect.  The fictitious part of my narrative is, as in “Rienzi,”  and the “Last of the Barons,” confined chiefly to the private life, with its domain of incident and passion, which is the legitimate appanage of novelist or poet.  The love story of Harold and Edith is told differently from the well-known legend, which implies a less pure connection.  But the whole legend respecting the Edeva faira (Edith the fair) whose name meets us in the “Domesday” roll, rests upon very slight authority considering its popular acceptance [3]; and the reasons for my alterations will be sufficiently obvious in a work intended not only for general perusal, but which on many accounts, I hope, may be entrusted fearlessly to the young; while those alterations are in strict accordance with the spirit of the time, and tend to illustrate one of its most marked peculiarities.  More apology is perhaps due for the liberal use to which I have applied the superstitions of the age.  But with the age itself those superstitions are so interwoven--they meet us so constantly, whether in the pages of our own chroniclers, or the records of the kindred Scandinavians--they are so intruded into the very laws, so blended with the very life, of our Saxon forefathers, that without employing them, in somewhat of the same credulous spirit with which they were originally conceived, no vivid impression of the People they influenced can be conveyed.  Not without truth has an Italian writer remarked, “that he who would depict philosophically an unphilosophical age, should remember that, to be familiar with children, one must sometimes think and feel as a child.”  Yet it has not been my main endeavour to make these ghostly agencies conducive to the ordinary poetical purposes of terror, and if that effect be at all created by them, it will be, I apprehend, rather subsidiary to the more historical sources of interest than, in itself, a leading or popular characteristic of the work.  My object, indeed, in the introduction of the Danish Vala especially, has been perhaps as much addressed to the reason as to the fancy, in showing what large, if dim, remains of the ancient “heathenesse” still kept their ground on the Saxon soil, contending with and contrasting the monkish superstitions, by which they were ultimately replaced.  Hilda is not in history; but without the romantic impersonation of that which Hilda represents, the history of the time would be imperfectly understood.  In the character of Harold--while I have carefully examined and weighed the scanty evidences of its distinguishing attributes which are yet preserved to us--and, in spite of no unnatural partiality, have not concealed what appear to me its deficiencies, and still less the great error of the life it illustrates,--I have attempted, somewhat and slightly, to shadow out the ideal of the pure Saxon character, such as it was then, with its large qualities undeveloped, but marked already by patient endurance, love of justice, and freedom--the manly sense of duty rather than the chivalric sentiment of honour--and that indestructible element of practical purpose and courageous will, which, defying all conquest, and steadfast in all peril, was ordained to achieve so vast an influence over the destinies of the world.  To the Norman Duke, I believe, I have been as lenient as justice will permit, though it is as impossible to deny his craft as to dispute his genius; and so far as the scope of my work would allow, I trust that I have indicated fairly the grand characteristics of his countrymen, more truly chivalric than their lord.  It has happened, unfortunately for that illustrious race of men, that they have seemed to us, in England, represented by the Anglo-Norman kings.  The fierce and plotting William, the vain and worthless Rufus, the cold-blooded and relentless Henry, are no adequate representatives of the far nobler Norman vavasours, whom even the English Chronicler admits to have been “kind masters,” and to whom, in spite of their kings, the after liberties of England were so largely indebted.  But this work closes on the Field of Hastings; and in that noble struggle for national independence, the sympathies of every true son of the land, even if tracing his lineage back to the Norman victor, must be on the side of the patriot Harold.  In the notes, which I have thought necessary aids to the better comprehension of these volumes, my only wish has been to convey to the general reader such illustrative information as may familiarise him more easily with the subject-matter of the book, or refresh his memory on incidental details not without a national interest. In the mere references to authorities I do not pretend to arrogate to a fiction the proper character of a history; the references are chiefly used either where wishing pointedly to distinguish from invention what was borrowed from a chronicle, or when differing from some popular historian to whom the reader might be likely to refer, it seemed well to state the authority upon which the difference was founded. [4]  In fact, my main object has been one that compelled me to admit graver matter than is common in romance, but which I would fain hope may be saved from the charge of dulness by some national sympathy between author and reader; my object is attained, and attained only, if, in closing the last page of this work, the reader shall find that, in spite of the fictitious materials admitted, he has formed a clearer and more intimate acquaintance with a time, heroic though remote, and characters which ought to have a household interest to Englishmen, than the succinct accounts of the mere historian could possibly afford him.  Thus, my dear D’Eyncourt, under cover of an address to yourself, have I made to the Public those explanations which authors in general (and I not the least so) are often overanxious to render.  This task done, my thoughts naturally fly back to the associations I connected with your name when I placed it at the head of this epistle. Again I seem to find myself under your friendly roof; again to greet my provident host entering that gothic chamber in which I had been permitted to establish my unsocial study, heralding the advent of majestic folios, and heaping libraries round the unworthy work. Again, pausing from my labour, I "]]]
