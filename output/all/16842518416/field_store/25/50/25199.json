It was not as pleasant as he could have wished when he did get it.  A devil of a thud it came upon his nose, a fair blow with Harkaway's fist, and being delivered straight from the shoulder, it seemed to the Italian like the kick of a donkey.  Toro shook all over.  His eyes flashed fireworks, and he was half stunned for the moment.  Harkaway's triumph was but temporary.  One of the Greeks, who was watching the conflict between these giants of the combat in great interest, had by now crept up behind Jack, and seizing him suddenly round the middle, hurled him to the ground.  \"Ha, ha!\" yelled Toro.  And bounding forward, he fell upon Harkaway, knife in hand.  \"At last, at last, your life is in my hands,\" he cried in fiend-like joy.  The knife gleamed in the air.  A piercing shriek from little Emily was heard.  A cry of fear from Paquita, and suddenly the latter, disengaging herself from her captors, bounded forward and seized Toro by the hair.  She dragged him back with all her strength, and little as it was, it saved the life of Jack Harkaway.  Jack put forth all his strength at this most critical juncture, and succeeded in grappling once more with his herculean opponent.  Toro lost his balance.  A moment more and he was rolling upon the ground in deadly battle with brave Jack Harkaway.  So fierce a strife could not last long.  In the heat of the combat cries were heard encouraging Harkaway and Harvey to fresh exertions, and up dashed the bold Monday, closely followed by Jefferson and several gentlemen from the contessa's fête.  The Greeks now began to lose heart.  The odds were veering round to the wrong side.  Greeks can fight moderately well when they are three or four to one Englishman, but when the numbers are equal, they do not care to provoke hostilities.  And so they blew upon their whistles for assistance, and soon the answering calls came in every direction, causing the gravest fears to the Harkaway faction.  \"Hah!\" ejaculated Jefferson; \"they are coming to help you. But at least I'll make sure of you, Master Toro.\"  The Italian did not shirk the encounter.  Toro, to do him justice, was, with all his faults, no coward.  He had felt the weight of Jefferson's arm, and he had reason to remember it.  Yet he met his old adversary boldly.  Jefferson fell upon the huge Italian with tiger-like fury, and in spite of his prodigious size and weight, he lifted him in his arms, swung him round, and hurled him to the ground.  The Greeks now, seeing their leaders in such dire peril, thought of avenging themselves by the most dastardly o| expedients.  \"Kill the girls!\" cried one of them.  The hint was caught up with avidity.  A savage yell responded to the bloodthirsty suggestion, and the lives of the two innocent girls were in real peril.  \"Look to the girls!\" shouted Dick Harvey, who was fully occupied with two of the Greek brigands who were pressing him closely.  There was a cheer in response to this appeal, and over went two of the Greeks.  Jefferson too lent a hand at this juncture.  Finding himself free from Toro's attentions, for the huge Italian had received such a desperate shaking with his fall that he was not fit for much now, he rushed into the _mêlée_, and dealt out such slogging blows that there were at least a dozen bleeding noses and black eyes distributed amongst the bandits in rather less time than it takes to note the fact.  The Greeks were thoroughly discouraged.  This unpleasant British mode of attack was not at all to their liking.  They could do pretty well with knives or swords, or even with firearms, but they could only regard men who used their fists in the lights of savages.  Gradually they retreated before the fierce onslaught of the Britishers and their gallant Yankee ally.  This was no small triumph.  The brigands mustered at least twenty men.  Their enemies were five.  The five were Harkaway, Harvey, Jefferson, and the two negroes Sunday and Monday.  The chicken-hearted Greeks, however, did not altogether turn tail, for ere they could get fairly off this hardly-contested field, they received considerable reinforcements.  About ten more Greeks put in an appearance.  A ragged, ruffianly crew, and ill armed.  The Harkaway party were not armed at all.  The Greeks fell back and made attempts to re-form in something like good order.  But Jefferson saw the danger, and he followed them up closely.  Jack and Dick Harvey were at his heels.  Neither of our old friends were inferior to the bold Jefferson in courage; but they did not possess his great advantages of size and strength.  Jefferson's right arm went out like a battering ram, and each time he struck out, down dropped his man.  At all events, the brigands did not give any particular signs of coming up for a repetition dose.  The huge American dashed into the thick of the enemy.  The assassination of poor little Magog Brand had fired his fury, and his charge was something terrific.  He dashed into the midst of the half cowed bandits, and swinging his arms around him like the sails of a windmill, he \"grassed\" a man at every stroke.  But this could not last for long.  As the Greeks grew stronger in numbers, they stood upon the defensive.  They were reassured.  They had seven-and-twenty men against the five.  The five, too, large-hearted though they were, had the two girls to look after.  Amongst the latest comers upon the bandits' side was one man who was a petty officer of the brigands, and he gave a few hurried commands, which had the effect of putting Harkaway and his friends into a very awkward predicament.  \"Load and fire,\" said the brigand, \"Shoot them all down.\"  If they could but succeed in getting a shot or two at the bold Jefferson, or at any of the party, it would speedily be all over with them.  But now, when individual bravery could no longer avail them, they had a rare slice of luck.  Suddenly a rattling volley of musketry was heard, and three of the Greeks bit the dust, while a number of cries told that several were hit.  And then a detachment of gendarmes dashed up into the open at a swinging trot.  And who headed this very welcome party?  Who but two youths that have been heard of before in these pages?  Who indeed but young Jack Harkaway and his friend Harry Girdwood?     CHAPTER VI.  SUNDAY RUBS OFF AN OLD SCORE--THE BRIGANDS--WHAT HAPPENED AT THE PORTER'S LODGE--A STRANGE BLIND BEGGAR.   \"Hurrah!\"  \"Give them another.\"  \"Load again.\"  \"Another volley.\"  A rapid, irregular discharge followed, and the Greeks, with cries of fear and rage, dropped their arms and fled precipitately, panic-stricken.  The gendarmes followed them up, and several were knocked over and secured; and behind them the brigands had left no less than seven of their number who had not been able to get off.  Amongst those seven were two men that it was no small gratification to the Harkaway party to see once more in their power.  These two men were Hunston and Toro the Italian.  Sunday stood over the latter, leathering into his half insensible carcase in a way that threatened to cover it with bruises; and at every blow he had something fresh to say.  \"Take dat!\" he exclaimed, punching into Toro's ribs, \"you dam nigger.\"  Toro, dazed with what he had suffered in his shaking, could offer no resistance.  \"And dere's another, you ugly tief!\" said the virtuous Sunday. \"I'll gib you what for; you shall hab what Paddy gib the drum, you 'fernal black skunk; I show yar what John up the orchard is, you--you Italian organ-grinding sweep--You chestnut-munching beast!\"  Sunday had never forgotten his first acquaintance with Toro.  The reader will doubtless bear it in mind, since with it is connected one of the most startling episodes of Jack Harkaway's history, in his voyage round the world with young Jack.  It was at the hotel in New York that the Harkaways first met with Sunday, too, for here they were the means of rescuing him from the brutal violence of the ruffian Toro.  It was, in fact, this which led up to that scene of terror--the firing of the hotel by Hunston and Toro.  Sunday had suffered at Toro's hands, but had never had his whack back.  But now the darkey showed the half insensible Italian the full signification of \"John up de orchard,\" and likewise of \"what for,\" and \"what Paddy gave the drum.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Hunston and Toro were thrown into prison, with the few brigands captured and their discomfited chieftain Mathias.  Such was the end of their exploit.  When once they were in prison, however, it required some exertion on the part of the authorities to keep them there.  The gang were unceasing in their endeavours to release them.  Artifices of every kind were tried to accomplish it, but the Harkaways had foreseen that no stone would be left unturned by the murderous friends of the captured robbers; and they knew the good old-fashioned saying--\"forewarned, forearmed.'\"  The prison in which they we re confined was situated at the waterside, and it was approachable by boat, where the entrance was beneath a low, vaulted archway.  The day after the capture of the notorious robbers, a poor cripple hobbled up to the porter's lodge, dragging himself painfully along by the aid of a stick in one hand and a crutch under his other arm.  \"Move off,\" said the porter gruffly; \"we have nothing to give away here.\"  \"I don't ask your charity,\" replied the cripple humbly; \"accept this, good sir, as a peace offering.\"  And then, to the porter's surprise, he dropped a coin into his hand.  The porter looked hard at the coin in his hand, and then at the cripple.  He was a man of no sentiment, this porter, and so he asked the generous donor bluntly what he wanted for the money.  \"I only want you to show some consideration and kindness, if possible, to some of the unfortunate inmates of this place,\" was the reply.  \"Prisoners?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"If you expect that,\" said the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7335"],["title","Jack Harkaway and His Son's Escape from the Brigands of Greece (#7)"],["body","\"you had better take back your money, for I have nothing to do with the prisoners.\"  The cripple looked grave, and he muttered to himself--  \"This fool is beastly conscientious. If he had only proved a bit of a rogue, there was a chance--the ass!\"  But he did not mean to yield the point yet.  \"You are a very good man,\" he said to the porter, \"a worthy honest fellow, and you will know that I don't mean to offer you any thing like a bribe.\"  The porter started.  \"A bribe!\" he said, with an expletive. \"You had better not.\"  \"Ahem!\" coughed the cripple. \"My friend, I have confined in this prison my son, a poor misguided boy--\"  \"They are mostly that,\" said the porter shortly.  \"But he is innocent.\"  \"They are all innocent,\" said the porter.  \"All?\"  \"According to their own showing.\"  \"But my boy is.\"  \"No doubt\"  \"And I only want to beg you to do what you can to soften his lot--a hard lot it is, too.\"  \"I can do nothing, I tell you,\" said the porter; \"I never see the prisoners.\"  \"I thought--\"  \"At least, when I say never, I mean only when they are allowed to walk in the prison yard.\"  \"That is here?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"When is that?\"  \"Once a day; sometimes more than that, if the doctor orders it.\"  \"The doctor must order it, then?\" said the cripple to himself.  \"What is your son in for?\" asked the porter.  \"For an unfortunate resemblance he bears to a notorious brigand.\"  \"Bah!\" exclaimed the porter. \"They don't imprison a man for being like another.\"  \"Yes, they do; my unlucky son has been taken for Mathias the brigand.\"  \"What,\" ejaculated the doorkeeper, \"do you mean that Mathias is not Mathias?\"  \"I mean that my son has been taken for Mathias, to whom, indeed, he is so like that nothing but the capture of the real culprit can save my son.\"  The doorkeeper eyed the cripple sharply.  But the latter stood it coolly enough.  \"Well,\" said the door porter, \"if that is the case, it is certainly a very hard job for your son. What do you want me to do for him? I can't let him out.\"  \"My friend,\" exclaimed the cripple, \"think you I would suggest such a thing? No, all I would ask of you is to soothe him with a kind word.\"  \"I'll tell him when next he comes out.\"  \"At what time did you say?\" asked the cripple, looking on the ground as though he only put the question casually.  \"At twelve.\"  The cripple's eyes glistened as he heard this.  \"Well, well,\" he said, pressing some more money into the door porter's hand, \"I'll call again, and perhaps you may have seen my boy, and comforted him with the assurance that I'll save him, in spite of all the ill these accursed English people can work by the aid of their money.\"  \"Oh, that's it, is it?\" said the porter. \"The English are at work in it, eh?\"  \"Yes. They owe him some spite, and money, you know, can buy any thing--any thing.\" And blessing the gatekeeper, he hobbled off.         *       *       *       *       *  Near the prison he overtook a blind man begging by the roadside, and while stopping to drop a coin in his hat, the cripple contrived to whisper a few hurried words to this effect--  \"I have made a step--almost made a breach in the fortress.\"  \"You have!\"  And the blind man turned his head to the right and to the left, almost as though looking out to see if they were unwatched.  \"Yes; the prison yard is only the other side of the gate. Now that gate is kept by a porter who is already in our interest.\"  \"Good, good, Tomaso!\" quoth the blind man.  \"Now, listen.\"  \"Go on,\" returned the blind man, in an eager tone.  \"At noon the prisoners are in the yard. If we could but get that gate open for an instant, and have our men ready hereabouts for a rush--\"  \"Yes, yes.\"  \"Who can tell what may happen?\"  \"Good again--good again! ha, ha, ha! that's brave, that is. Why, the mob of idle sightseers who crowd about the prison gates at noon to watch the prisoners might all be poor blind wretches or helpless cripples like you and I.\"  \"Of course.\"  \"And if the gate is left open but one instant--a single inch, no more--why, worlds might be done.\"  \"A horse ready saddled near at hand might be worth thinking of.\"  \"True.\"  \"And a small keg of gunpowder blown up under the archway by the waterside entrance would divert attention.\"  \"Tomaso,\" ejaculated the blind man, \"you're born to be a captain of brigands some day!\"     CHAPTER VII.  HOW TOMASO HELPED HIS FRIENDS IN TROUBLE--THE SKIRMISH IN THE PRISON--MATHIAS THE BRIGAND.   Tomaso, before the day was over, changed his garments and abandoned crutch and stick, and when he turned out with flaxen-dyed hair and spectacles, and presented himself at the other great entrance of the prison, as a German traveller who desired to go over the place, no one could possibly have imagined it to be the old cripple whose paternal lamentation had so touched the doorkeeper's heart.  \"You have got here a notorious brigand, as I have heard tell,\" said the visitor.  \"We have, sir,\" was the governor's reply; \"a very remarkable man he is, too.\"  \"Ah, so I have heard,\" said the visitor. \"He is called Demetrius, I believe?\"  \"Nay; his name is Mathias.\"  The visitor looked surprised at this information.  \"Mathias--Mathias!\" he repeated to himself. \"I was misinformed, then. I certainly thought that his name was Demetrius.\"  The governor smiled.  \"You may be right, all the same,\" said he.  \"How so?\"  \"Why, Mathias is but his avowed name; he may be known by a dozen different _aliases_.\"  \"Is it possible?\" ejaculated the sham German traveller.  \"Indeed it is. These robbers are mostly adepts at disguise. Would you like to see this Mathias?\" demanded the governor, courteously.  \"Vastly.\"  \"Well, sir, I'll only warn you of one thing.\"  \"Indeed! What is it?\"  \"A disappointment awaits you in this.\"  \"How so?\"  \"Instead of seeing a ferocious fellow, such as you might expect, Mathias is really a very pleasant and innocent-looking man.\"  The governor of the prison then led the visitors through the long stone corridors of the place where Mathias was confined.  They stopped before a door of great thickness, heavily barred, and studded with iron bolts and nails.  The governor tapped at a small grated trap in the door, and it was pulled aside.  At the grating a broad-shouldered fellow appeared, who touched his cap at the visitors.  \"So that is Mathias,\" said the German gentleman.  \"No, no,\" said the governor; \"that is the gaoler who is shut up with him.\"  \"What for?\"  \"So that he might be watched night and day; the authorities have doomed him to--\"  \"To what?\"  \"To death,\" replied the governor, in a low but impressive voice.  \"He is young.\"  \"In years, yes,\" answered the governor, \"but old in crime. This man has been guilty of nearly every crime under the sun--brigandage is one of his least offences. His last exploit, however, is the worst.\"  \"What is that?\"  \"Murder.\"  \"Murder!\"  And the German traveller looked inexpressibly shocked.  \"Murder is a capital crime in every land.\"  \"And rightly too,\" said the visitor, \"rightly, too. But, sir, excuse my curiosity--\"  \"Ask all you will,\" returned the governor.  \"This man had, I was told, a bold, dashing fellow to second him in all his exploits.\"  \"An Italian?\"  \"No.\"  \"An Englishman?\"  \"No, no, sir, you mistake; I mean a Greek--a handsome, dashing fellow--a great favourite with the ladies--brave and daring.\"  \"And how is this Apollo called?\"  \"Tomaso.\"  The governor burst into a loud fit of laughter at this,  \"You are altogether mistaken about that brigand--that Tomaso. He is a scrubby and ill-favoured scamp--a sneaking, crawling rascal, capable of all the villany of his master, but not possessed of his courage.\"  Had the governor been looking at the visitor's face just then, he might have had his suspicions aroused.  The sham German philanthropist glared ferociously as this description was given.  The prisoner, who was seated at a rough deal table at the further end of the cell, here arose at the gaoler's order, and came to the window.  A single glance sufficed to show that a very noticeable change had taken place in the appearance of Mathias.  His face was pale and haggard, and the whole of one side of it, the eye, cheek bone, and forehead were bruised.  This was the mark that Jefferson had set upon him.  This was the bold American's only vengeance for the deathblow which the brigand had dealt upon his faithful friend and companion Magog Brand.  Jefferson's right arm came down like a steam hammer, and any man who had felt its full force as the scoundrel Mathias had did not forget it very readily.  Such a desperate shaking had it given Mathias that he had not yet recovered.  The bold, defiant bearing of the man was gone, and he looked ten years older than when Tomaso and he had last met.  It struck the visitor at once.  \"Dear, dear me,\" exclaimed the latter, \"is it possible that this can be the redoubtable Mathias?\"  \"It is he,\" said the governor, \"yet scarcely so gay as is his wont, eh, Mathias?\"  The prisoner shrugged his shoulders and sighed.  \"Laugh on, your excellency,\" he said, rather bitterly, \"it is your turn now.\"  \"Now!\"  \"Aye, now. It may not always be.\"  \"Why, surely you never think of getting out of this?\"  \"Indeed, I think of nothing else morning, noon, and night.\"  The governor gave a sharp glance about.  He looked toward the gaoler.  Now the gaoler was a huge fellow, over six feet high and broad in proportion, one who could have tackled Toro himself, as far as weight and sheer brute strength went.  \"Your excellency,\" replied Mathias, \"when I leave this place, my exit will be due to no violence. Bad as I am, I am not altogether what they would make out.\"  \"Poor Mathias!\" said the governor ironically, \"one would almost think that murder was not his line of business.\"  \"Your excellency,\" said the prison, drawing near to the grated window, \"I repent sincerely of that poor little gentleman's death; it was no assassin's stab in the dark, but a most unfortunate blow in a fight, remember.\"  \"Bravo! Mathias! bravo!\" ejaculated the "]]]
