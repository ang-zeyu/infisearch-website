Yes, it was too loud.  Once I could have enjoyed it and seen nothing out of the way about it, but now its note was discordant.  It was good Arkansas journalism, but this was not Arkansas.  Moreover, the next to the last line was calculated to give offense to the hermits, and perhaps lose us their advertising. Indeed, there was too lightsome a tone of flippancy all through the paper.  It was plain I had undergone a considerable change without noticing it.  I found myself unpleasantly affected by pert little irreverencies which would have seemed but proper and airy graces of speech at an earlier period of my life.  There was an abundance of the following breed of items, and they discomforted me:     LOCAL SMOKE AND CINDERS.     Sir Launcelot met up with old King    Agrivance of Ireland unexpectedly last    weok over on the moor south of Sir    Balmoral le Merveilleuse's hog dasture.    The widow has been notified.

The readers of the Hosannah will re-    gret to learn that the hadndsome and    popular Sir Charolais of Gaul, who dur-    ing his four weeks' stay at the Bull and    Halibut, this city, has won every heart    by his polished manners and elegant    cPnversation, will pUll out to-day for    home. Give us another call, Charley!     The bdsiness end of the funeral of    the late Sir Dalliance the duke's son of    Cornwall, killed in an encounter with    the Giant of the Knotted Bludgeon last    Tuesday on the borders of the Plain of    Enchantment was in the hands of the    ever affable and efficient Mumble,    prince of un3ertakers, then whom there    exists none by whom it were a more    satisfying pleasure to have the last sad    offices performed. Give him a trial.

When this  administration wants to    chalk up a desirable name for early    promotion, the Hosannah would like a    chance to sudgest.

Of course it was good enough journalism for a beginning; I knew that quite well, and yet it was somehow disappointing.  The \"Court Circular\" pleased me better; indeed, its simple and dignified respectfulness was a distinct refreshment to me after all those disgraceful familiarities.  But even it could have been improved. Do what one may, there is no getting an air of variety into a court circular, I acknowledge that.  There is a profound monotonousness about its facts that baffles and defeats one's sincerest efforts to make them sparkle and enthuse.  The best way to manage--in fact, the only sensible way--is to disguise repetitiousness of fact under variety of form: skin your fact each time and lay on a new cuticle of words.  It deceives the eye; you think it is a new fact; it gives you the idea that the court is carrying on like everything; this excites you, and you drain the whole column, with a good appetite, and perhaps never notice that it's a barrel of soup made out of a single bean.  Clarence's way was good, it was simple, it was dignified, it was direct and business-like; all I say is, it was not the best way:               COURT CIRCULAR.     On Monday, the king rode in the park.    \"  Tuesday,      \"      \"        \"    \"  Wendesday     \"      \"        \"    \"  Thursday      \"      \"        \"    \"  Friday,       \"      \"        \"    \"  Saturday      \"      \"        \"    \"  Sunday,       \"      \"        \"   However, take the paper by and large, I was vastly pleased with it. Little crudities of a mechanical sort were observable here and there, but there were not enough of them to amount to anything, and it was good enough Arkansas proof-reading, anyhow, and better than was needed in Arthur's day and realm.  As a rule, the grammar was leaky and the construction more or less lame; but I did not much mind these things.  They are common defects of my own, and one mustn't criticise other people on grounds where he can't stand perpendicular himself.  I was hungry enough for literature to want to take down the whole paper at this one meal, but I got only a few bites, and then had to postpone, because the monks around me besieged me so with eager questions: What is this curious thing?  What is it for?  Is it a handkerchief?--saddle blanket?--part of a shirt?  What is it made of? How thin it is, and how dainty and frail; and how it rattles. Will it wear, do you think, and won't the rain injure it?  Is it writing that appears on it, or is it only ornamentation?  They suspected it was writing, because those among them who knew how to read Latin and had a smattering of Greek, recognized some of the letters, but they could make nothing out of the result as a whole.  I put my information in the simplest form I could:  \"It is a public journal; I will explain what that is, another time. It is not cloth, it is made of paper; some time I will explain what paper is.  The lines on it are reading matter; and not written by hand, but printed; by and by I will explain what printing is. A thousand of these sheets have been made, all exactly like this, in every minute detail--they can't be told apart.\"  Then they all broke out with exclamations of surprise and admiration:  \"A thousand!  Verily a mighty work--a year's work for many men.\"  \"No--merely a day's work for a man and a boy.\"  They crossed themselves, and whiffed out a protective prayer or two.  \"Ah-h--a miracle, a wonder!  Dark work of enchantment.\"  I let it go at that.  Then I read in a low voice, to as many as could crowd their shaven heads within hearing distance, part of the account of the miracle of the restoration of the well, and was accompanied by astonished and reverent ejaculations all through: \"Ah-h-h!\"  \"How true!\"  \"Amazing, amazing!\"  \"These be the very haps as they happened, in marvelous exactness!\"  And might they take this strange thing in their hands, and feel of it and examine it?--they would be very careful.  Yes.  So they took it, handling it as cautiously and devoutly as if it had been some holy thing come from some supernatural region; and gently felt of its texture, caressed its pleasant smooth surface with lingering touch, and scanned the mysterious characters with fascinated eyes.  These grouped bent heads, these charmed faces, these speaking eyes --how beautiful to me!  For was not this my darling, and was not all this mute wonder and interest and homage a most eloquent tribute and unforced compliment to it?  I knew, then, how a mother feels when women, whether strangers or friends, take her new baby, and close themselves about it with one eager impulse, and bend their heads over it in a tranced adoration that makes all the rest of the universe vanish out of their consciousness and be as if it were not, for that time.  I knew how she feels, and that there is no other satisfied ambition, whether of king, conqueror, or poet, that ever reaches half-way to that serene far summit or yields half so divine a contentment.  During all the rest of the seance my paper traveled from group to group all up and down and about that huge hall, and my happy eye was upon it always, and I sat motionless, steeped in satisfaction, drunk with enjoyment.  Yes, this was heaven; I was tasting it once, if I might never taste it more."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7247"],["title","A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Part 6.

Clemens)                             Part 6.    CHAPTER XXVII  THE YANKEE AND THE KING TRAVEL INCOGNITO  About bedtime I took the king to my private quarters to cut his hair and help him get the hang of the lowly raiment he was to wear. The high classes wore their hair banged across the forehead but hanging to the shoulders the rest of the way around, whereas the lowest ranks of commoners were banged fore and aft both; the slaves were bangless, and allowed their hair free growth.  So I inverted a bowl over his head and cut away all the locks that hung below it. I also trimmed his whiskers and mustache until they were only about a half-inch long; and tried to do it inartistically, and succeeded.  It was a villainous disfigurement.  When he got his lubberly sandals on, and his long robe of coarse brown linen cloth, which hung straight from his neck to his ankle-bones, he was no longer the comeliest man in his kingdom, but one of the unhandsomest and most commonplace and unattractive.  We were dressed and barbered alike, and could pass for small farmers, or farm bailiffs, or shepherds, or carters; yes, or for village artisans, if we chose, our costume being in effect universal among the poor, because of its strength and cheapness.  I don't mean that it was really cheap to a very poor person, but I do mean that it was the cheapest material there was for male attire--manufactured material, you understand.  We slipped away an hour before dawn, and by broad sun-up had made eight or ten miles, and were in the midst of a sparsely settled country.  I had a pretty heavy knapsack; it was laden with provisions--provisions for the king to taper down on, till he could take to the coarse fare of the country without damage.  I found a comfortable seat for the king by the roadside, and then gave him a morsel or two to stay his stomach with.  Then I said I would find some water for him, and strolled away.  Part of my project was to get out of sight and sit down and rest a little myself.  It had always been my custom to stand when in his presence; even at the council board, except upon those rare occasions when the sitting was a very long one, extending over hours; then I had a trifling little backless thing which was like a reversed culvert and was as comfortable as the toothache.  I didn't want to break him in suddenly, but do it by degrees.  We should have to sit together now when in company, or people would notice; but it would not be good politics for me to be playing equality with him when there was no necessity for it.  I found the water some three hundred yards away, and had been resting about twenty minutes, when I heard voices.  That is all right, I thought--peasants going to work; nobody else likely to be stirring this early.  But the next moment these comers jingled into sight around a turn of the road--smartly clad people of quality, with luggage-mules and servants in their train!  I was off like a shot, through the bushes, by the shortest cut.  For a while it did seem that these people would pass the king before I could get to him; but desperation gives you wings, you know, and I canted my body forward, inflated my breast, and held my breath and flew. I arrived.  And in plenty good enough time, too.  \"Pardon, my king, but it's no time for ceremony--jump!  Jump to your feet--some quality are coming!\"  \"Is that a marvel?  Let them come.\"  \"But my liege!  You must not be seen sitting.  Rise!--and stand in humble posture while they pass.  You are a peasant, you know.\"  \"True--I had forgot it, so lost was I in planning of a huge war with Gaul\"--he was up by this time, but a farm could have got up quicker, if there was any kind of a boom in real estate--\"and right-so a thought came randoming overthwart this majestic dream the which--\"  \"A humbler attitude, my lord the king--and quick!  Duck your head! --more!--still more!--droop it!\"  He did his honest best, but lord, it was no great things.  He looked as humble as the leaning tower at Pisa.  It is the most you could say of it.  Indeed, it was such a thundering poor success that it raised wondering scowls all along the line, and a gorgeous flunkey at the tail end of it raised his whip; but I jumped in time and was under it when it fell; and under cover of the volley of coarse laughter which followed, I spoke up sharply and warned the king to take no notice.  He mastered himself for the moment, but it was a sore tax; he wanted to eat up the procession.  I said:  \"It would end our adventures at the very start; and we, being without weapons, could do nothing with that armed gang.  If we are going to succeed in our emprise, we must not only look the peasant but act the peasant.\"  \"It is wisdom; none can gainsay it.  Let us go on, Sir Boss. I will take note and learn, and do the best I may.\"  He kept his word.  He did the best he could, but I've seen better. If you have ever seen an active, heedless, enterprising child going diligently out of one mischief and into another all day long, and an anxious mother at its heels all the while, and just saving it by a hair from drowning itself or breaking its neck with each new experiment, you've seen the king and me.  If I could have foreseen what the thing was going to be like, I should have said, No, if anybody wants to make his living exhibiting a king as a peasant, let him take the layout; I can do better with a menagerie, and last longer.  And yet, during the first three days I never allowed him to enter a hut or other dwelling.  If he could pass muster anywhere during his early novitiate it would be in small inns and on the road; so to these places we confined ourselves.  Yes, he certainly did the best he could, but what of that?  He didn't improve a bit that I could see.  He was always frightening me, always breaking out with fresh astonishers, in new and unexpected places.  Toward evening on the second day, what does he do but blandly fetch out a dirk from inside his robe!  \"Great guns, my liege, where did you get that?\"  \"From a smuggler at the inn, yester eve.\"  \"What in the world possessed you to buy it?\"  \"We have escaped divers dangers by wit--thy wit--but I have bethought me that it were but prudence if I bore a weapon, too. Thine might fail thee in some pinch.\"  \"But people of our condition are not allowed to carry arms.  What would a lord say--yes, or any other person of whatever condition --if he caught an upstart peasant with a dagger on his person?\"  It was a lucky thing for us that nobody came along just then. I persuaded him to throw the dirk away; and it was as easy as persuading a child to give up some bright fresh new way of killing itself.  We walked along, silent and thinking.  Finally the king said:  \"When ye know that I meditate a thing inconvenient, or that hath a peril in it, why do you not warn me to cease from that project?\"  It was a startling question, and a puzzler.  I didn't quite know how to take hold of it, or what to say, and so, of course, I ended by saying the natural thing:  \"But, sire, how can I know what your thoughts are?\"  The king stopped dead in his tracks, and stared at me.  \"I believed thou wert greater than Merlin; and truly in magic thou art.  But prophecy is greater than magic.  Merlin is a prophet.\"  I saw I had made a blunder.  I must get back my lost ground. After a deep reflection and careful planning, I said:  \"Sire, I have been misunderstood.  I will explain.  There are two kinds of prophecy.  One is the gift to foretell things that are but a little way off, the other is the gift to foretell things that are whole ages and centuries away.  Which is the mightier gift, do you think?\"  \"Oh, the last, most surely!\"  \"True.  Does Merlin possess it?\"  \"Partly, yes.  He foretold mysteries about my birth and future kingship that were twenty years away.\"  \"Has he ever gone beyond that?\"  \"He would not claim more, I think.\"  \"It is probably his limit.  All prophets have their limit.  The limit of some of the great prophets has been a hundred years.\"  \"These are few, I ween.\"  \"There have been two still greater ones, whose limit was four hundred and six hundred years, and one whose limit compassed even seven hundred and twenty.\"  \"Gramercy, it is marvelous!\"  \"But what are these in comparison with me?  They are nothing.\"  \"What?  Canst thou truly look beyond even so vast a stretch of time as--\"  \"Seven hundred years?  My liege, as clear as the vision of an eagle does my prophetic eye penetrate and lay bare the future of this world for nearly thirteen centuries and a half!\"  My land, you should have seen the king's eyes spread slowly open, and lift the earth's entire atmosphere as much as an inch!  That settled Brer Merlin.  One never had any occasion to prove his facts, with these people; all he had to do was to state them.  It never occurred to anybody to doubt the statement.  \"Now, then,\" I continued, \"I _could_ work both kinds of prophecy --the long and the short--if I chose to take the trouble to keep in practice; but I seldom exercise any but the long kind, because the other is beneath my dignity.  It is properer to Merlin's sort --stump-tail prophets, as we call them in the profession.  Of course, I whet up now and then and flirt out a minor prophecy, but not often--hardly ever, in fact.  You will remember that there was great talk, when you reached the Valley of Holiness, about my having prophesied your coming and the very hour of your arrival, two or three days beforehand.\"  \"Indeed, yes, I mind it now.\"  \"Well, I could have done it as much as forty times easier, and piled on a thousand times more detail into the bargain, if it had been five hundred years away instead of two or three days.\"  \"How amazing that it should be so!\"  \"Yes, a genuine expert can always foretell a thing that is five hundred years away easier than he can a thing"]]]
