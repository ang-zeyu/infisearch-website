It would have been a final decision alike against humanity, justice, the rights and dignity of the Government, and against sound and wise National policy.  \"The decision of the President to strike at the root of the Rebellion will lend new vigor to efforts, and new life and hope to the hearts of the People.  Cordially tendering to the President our respectful assurances of personal and official confidence, we trust and believe that the policy now inaugurated will be crowned with success, will give speedy and triumphant victories over our enemies, and secure to this Nation and this People the blessing and favor of Almighty God.  \"We believe that the blood of the heroes who have already fallen, and those who may yet give their lives to their Country, will not have been shed in vain.  \"The splendid valor of our soldiers, their patient endurance, their manly patriotism, and their devotion to duty, demand from us and from all their countrymen the homage of the sincerest gratitude and the pledge of our constant reinforcement and support.  A just regard for these brave men, whom we have contributed to place in the field, and for the importance of the duties which may lawfully pertain to us hereafter, has called us into friendly conference.  \"And now, presenting to our National Chief Magistrate this conclusion of our deliberations, we devote ourselves to our Country's service, and we will surround the President with our constant support, trusting that the fidelity and zeal of the Loyal States and People will always assure him that he will be constantly maintained in pursuing, with the utmost vigor, this War for the preservation of the National life and hope of humanity.  \"A. G. CURTIN, \"JOHN A. ANDREW, \"RICHARD YATES, \"ISRAEL WASHBURNE, Jr., \"EDWARD SOLOMON, \"SAMUEL J. KIRKWOOD, \"O. P. MORTON,--By D.  G.  ROSE, his Representative, \"WM. SPRAGUE, \"F. H. PEIRPOINT, \"DAVID TOD, \"N. S. BERRY, \"AUSTIN BLAIR.\"   Some two months after the issue of his great Proclamation of Liberty, President Lincoln (in his Second Annual Message to Congress, December 1, 1862), took occasion again to refer to compensated Emancipation, and, indeed, to the entire matter of Slavery and Freedom, in most instructive and convincing manner, as follows:  \"On the 22d day of September last, a Proclamation was issued by the Executive, a copy of which is herewith  submitted.  \"In accordance with the purpose in the second paragraph of that paper, I now respectfully recall your attention to what may be called 'compensated Emancipation.'  \"A Nation may be said to consist of its territory, its people, and its laws.  The territory is the only part which is of certain durability. 'One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh, but the Earth abideth forever.'  It is of the first importance to duly consider and estimate this ever-enduring part.  \"That portion of the Earth's surface which is owned and inhabited by the People of the United States, is well adapted to be the home of one National family; and it is not well adapted for two, or more.  Its vast extent, and its variety of climate and productions, are of advantage, in this age, for one People, whatever they might have been in former ages. Steam, telegraphs, and intelligence, have brought these to be an advantageous combination for one united People.  \"In the Inaugural Address I briefly pointed out the total inadequacy of Disunion, as a remedy for the differences between the people of the two Sections.  I did so in language which I cannot improve, and which, therefore, I beg to repeat:  \"'One Section of our Country believes Slavery is right, and ought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrong, and ought not to be extended.  This is the only substantial dispute.  The Fugitive Slave clause of the Constitution, and the law for the suppression of the foreign Slave Trade, are each as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the People imperfectly supports the law itself.  \"The great body of the People abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases, and a few break over in each.  This, I think, cannot be perfectly cured; and it would be worse in both cases after the separation of the Sections, than before.  The foreign Slave Trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately revived without restriction in one Section; while Fugitive Slaves, now only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered at all by the other.  \"Physically speaking, we cannot separate.  We cannot remove our respective Sections from each other, nor build an impassable wall between them.  A husband and wife may be divorced, and each go out of the presence and beyond the reach of the other; but the different parts of our Country cannot do this.  They cannot but remain face to face; and intercourse, either amicable or hostile, must continue between them.  \"'Is it possible, then, to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before?  Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws?  Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends? suppose you go to War, you cannot fight always; and when, after much loss on both sides, and no gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical old questions as to terms of intercourse are again upon you.'  \"There is no line, straight or crooked, suitable for a National boundary upon which to divide.  Trace through, from East to West, upon the line between the Free and Slave Country, and we shall find a little more than one third of its length are rivers, easy to be crossed, and populated, or soon to be populated, thickly upon both sides; while nearly all its remaining length are merely surveyors' lines, over which people may walk back and forth without any consciousness of their presence.  \"No part of this line can be made any more difficult to pass, by writing it down on paper or parchment as a National boundary.  The fact of separation, if it comes, gives up, on the part of the seceding Section, the Fugitive Slave clause, along with all other Constitutional obligations upon the Section seceded from, while I should expect no treaty stipulations would ever be made to take its place.  \"But there is another difficulty.  The great interior region, bounded East by the Alleghanies, North by the British dominions, West by the Rocky Mountains, and South by the line along which the culture of corn and cotton meets, and which includes part of Virginia, part of Tennessee, all of Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Minnesota, and the Territories of Dakota, Nebraska, and part of Colorado, already has above ten million people, and will have fifty millions within fifty years, if not prevented by any political folly or mistake.  \"It contains more than one-third of the country owned by the United States-certainly more than one million square miles.  Once half as populous as Massachusetts already is, it would have more than seventy-five million people.  A glance at the map shows that, territorially speaking, it is the great body of the Republic.  The other parts are but marginal borders to it, the magnificent region sloping West, from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific, being the deepest and also the richest in undeveloped resources.  In the production of provisions, grains, grasses, and all which proceed from them, this great interior region is naturally one of the most important in the World.  \"Ascertain from the statistics the small proportion of the region which has, as yet, been brought into cultivation, and also the large and rapidly increasing amount of its products, and we shall be overwhelmed with the magnitude of the prospect presented.  And yet this region has no sea coast, touches no ocean anywhere.  As part of one Nation, its people now find, and may forever find, their way to Europe by New York, to South America and Africa by New Orleans, and to Asia by San Francisco.  \"But separate our common Country into two nations, as designed by the present Rebellion, and every man of this great interior region is thereby cut off from some one or more of these outlets, not, perhaps, by a physical barrier, but by embarrassing and onerous trade regulations.  \"And this is true, wherever a dividing or boundary line may be fixed. Place it between the now Free and Slave country, or place it South of Kentucky, or North of Ohio, and still the truth remains, that none South of it can trade to any port or place North of it, and none North of it can trade to any port or place South of it except upon terms dictated by a Government foreign to them.  \"These outlets, East, West, and South, are indispensable to the well-being of the people inhabiting, and to inhabit, this vast interior region.  Which of the three may be the best, is no proper question. All, are better than either; and all, of right belong to that People, and to their successors forever.  True to themselves, they will not ask where a line of separation shall be, but will vow rather that there shall be no such line.  \"Nor are the marginal regions less interested in these communications to and through them, to the great outside World.  They too, and each of them, must have access to this Egypt of the West without paying toll at the crossing of any National boundary.  \"Our National strife springs not from our permanent part; not from the Land we inhabit; not from our National"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7137"],["title","The Great Conspiracy, Volume 5 (#5)"],["body","ead.  There is no possible severing of this, but would multiply, and not mitigate, evils among us. In all its adaptations and aptitudes it demands Union, and abhors separation.  In fact it would, ere long, force reunion, however much of blood and treasure the separation might have cost.  \"Our strife pertains to ourselves--to the passing generations of men; and it can, without convulsion, be hushed forever--with the passing of one generation.  \"In this view I recommend the adoption of the following Resolution and Articles Amendatory of the Constitution of the United States.  \"'Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled, (two-thirds of both Houses concurring).  That the following Articles be proposed to the Legislatures (or Conventions) of the several States, as Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, all or any of which Articles when ratified by three-fourths of the said Legislatures (or Conventions) to be valid as part or parts of the said Constitution, namely:  \"'ARTICLE--Every State wherein Slavery now exists, which shall abolish the same therein, at any time, or times, before the first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred, shall receive compensation from the United States, as follows, to wit;  \"'The President of the United States shall deliver to every such State, bonds of the United States, bearing interest at the rate of per cent. per annum, to an amount equal to the aggregate sum of for each Slave shown to have been therein by the eighth census of the United States, said bonds to be delivered to such States by installments, or in one parcel, at the completion of the abolishment, accordingly as the same shall have been gradual, or at one time, within such State; and interest shall begin to run upon any such bond only from the proper time of its delivery as aforesaid.  Any State having received bonds as aforesaid, and afterward reintroducing or tolerating Slavery therein, shall refund to the United States the bonds so received, or the value thereof, and all interest paid thereon.  \"'ARTICLE--All Slaves who shall have enjoyed actual freedom by the chances of the War at any time before the end of the Rebellion, shall be forever Free; but all owners of such, who shall not have been disloyal, shall be compensated for them, at the same rates as is provided for States adopting abolishment of Slavery, but in such way that no Slave shall be twice accounted for.  \"'ARTICLE--Congress may appropriate money, and otherwise provide for colonizing Free Colored Persons, with their own consent, at any place or places within the United States.'   \"I beg indulgence to discuss these proposed Articles at some length. Without Slavery the Rebellion could never have existed; without Slavery it could not continue.  \"Among the friends of the Union there is great diversity of sentiment and of policy in regard to Slavery, and the African race among us.  Some would perpetuate Slavery; some would abolish it suddenly, without compensation; some would abolish it gradually, and with compensation; some would remove the Freed people from us; and some would retain them with us; and there are yet other minor diversities.  Because of these diversities, we waste much strength in struggles among ourselves.  \"By mutual Concession we should harmonize and act together.  This would be Compromise; but it would be Compromise among the friends, and not with the enemies of the Union.  These Articles are intended to embody a plan of such mutual concessions.  If the plan shall be adopted, it is assumed that Emancipation will follow, at least, in several of the States.  \"As to the first Article, the main points are: first, the Emancipation; secondly, the length of time for consummating it--thirty-seven years; and, thirdly, the compensation.  \"The Emancipation will be unsatisfactory to the advocates of perpetual Slavery; but the length of time should greatly mitigate their dissatisfaction.  The time spares both races from the evils of sudden derangement--in fact from the necessity of any derangement--while most of those whose habitual course of thought will be disturbed by the measure will have passed away before its consummation.  They will never see it.  \"Another class will hail the prospect of Emancipation, but will deprecate the length of time.  They will feel that it gives too little to the now living Slaves.  But it really gives them much.  It saves them from the vagrant destitution which must largely attend immediate Emancipation in localities where their numbers are very great; and it gives the inspiring assurance that their posterity shall be Free forever.  \"The plan leaves to each State, choosing to act under it, to abolish Slavery now, or at the end of the century, or at any intermediate time, or by degrees, extending over the whole or any part of the period; and it obliges no two States to proceed alike.  It also provides for compensation,--and generally, the mode of making it.  This, it would seem, must further mitigate the dissatisfaction of those who favor perpetual Slavery, and especially of those who are to receive the compensation.  Doubtless some of those who are to pay, and not to receive, will object.  Yet the measure is both just and economical.  \"In a certain sense, the liberation of Slaves is the destruction of Property--Property acquired by descent, or by purchase, the same as any other property.  It is no less true for having been often said, that the people of the South are not more responsible for the original introduction of this Property than are the people of the North; and when it is remembered how unhesitatingly we all use cotton and sugar, and share the profits of dealing in them, it may not be quite safe to say that the South has been more responsible than the North for its continuance.  \"If, then, for a common object, this Property is to be sacrificed, is it not just that it be done at a common charge?  \"And if, with less money, or money more easily paid, we can preserve the benefits of the Union by this means than we can by the War alone, is it not also economical to do it?  Let us consider it then.  Let us ascertain the sum we have expended in the War since compensated Emancipation was proposed last March, and consider whether, if that measure had been promptly accepted, by even some of the Slave States, the same sum would not have done more to close the War than has been otherwise done.  If so, the measure would save money, and, in that view, would be a prudent and economical measure.  \"Certainly it is not so easy to pay something as it is to pay nothing; but it is easier to pay a large sum than it is to pay a larger one.  And it is easier to pay any sum when we are able, than it is to pay it before we are able.  The War requires large sums, and requires them at once.  \"The aggregate sum necessary for compensated Emancipation of course would be large.  But it would require no ready cash, nor the bonds, even, any faster than the Emancipation progresses.  This might not, and probably would not, close before the end of the thirty-seven years.  At that time we shall probably have a hundred million people to share the burden, instead of thirty-one millions, as now.  And not only so, but the increase of our population may be expected to continue, for a long time after that period, as rapidly as before; because our territory will not have become full.  \"I do not state this inconsiderately.  At the same ratio of increase which we have maintained, on an average, from our first National census in 1790, until that of 1860, we should, in 1900, have a population of 103,208,415.  And why may we not continue that ratio far beyond that period?  \"Our abundant room--our broad National homestead--is our ample resource. Were our territory as limited as are the British Isles, very certainly our population could not expand as stated.  Instead of receiving the foreign born, as now, we should be compelled to send part of the Native-born away.  \"But such is not our condition.  We have two million nine hundred and sixty-three thousand square miles.  Europe has three million and eight hundred thousand, with a population averaging seventy-three and one-third persons to the square mile.  Why may not our Country at some time, average as many?  Is it less fertile?  Has it more waste surface by mountains, rivers, lakes, deserts, or other causes?  Is it inferior to Europe in any natural advantage?  \"If, then, we are at some time to be as populous as Europe, how soon? As to when this may be, we can judge by the past and the present; as to when it will be, if ever, depends much on whether we maintain the Union.  \"Several of our States are already above the average of Europe --seventy-three and a third to the square mile.  Massachusetts has 157; Rhode Island, 133; Connecticut, 99; New York and New Jersey, each, 80. Also two other great States, Pennsylvania and Ohio, are not far below, the former having 63, and the latter 59.  The States already above the European average, except New York, have increased in as rapid a ratio, since passing that point, as ever before; while no one of them is equal to some other parts of our Country in natural capacity for sustaining a dense population.  \"Taking the Nation in the aggregate, and we find its population and ratio of increase, for the several decennial periods, to be as follows:  YEAR.  POPULATION. RATIO OF INCREASE  1790   3,929,827  1800   5,305,937   35.02 Per Cent.  1810   7,239,814   36.45  1820   9,638,131   33.13  1830  12,866,020   33.49  1840  17,069,453   32.67  1850  23,191,876   35.87  1860  31,443,790   35.58  \"This shows an average Decennial Increase of 34.69 per cent. in population through the seventy years from our first to our last census yet taken.  It is seen that the ratio of increase, at no one of these seven periods, is either two per cent. below or two per cent. above the average;"]]]
