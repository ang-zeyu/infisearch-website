Githa was already prepared for his news; for Haco had of his own accord gone to break the first shock of disappointment.  There was in this youth a noiseless sagacity that seemed ever provident for Harold. With his sombre, smileless cheek, and gloom of beauty, bowed as if beneath the weight of some invisible doom, he had already become linked indissolubly with the Earl's fate, as its angel,--but as its angel of darkness!  To Harold's intense relief, Githa stretched forth her hands as he entered, and said, \"Thou hast failed me, but against thy will! grieve not; I am content!\"  \"Now our Lady be blessed, mother--\"  \"I have told her,\" said Haco, who was standing, with arms folded, by the fire, the blaze of which reddened fitfully his hueless countenance with its raven hair; \"I have told thy mother that Wolnoth loves his captivity, and enjoys the cage.  And the lady hath had comfort in my words.\"  \"Not in thine only, son of Sweyn, but in those of fate; for before thy coming I prayed against the long blind yearning of my heart, prayed that Wolnoth might not cross the sea with his kinsmen.\"  \"How!\" exclaimed the Earl, astonished.  Githa took his arm, and led him to the farther end of the ample chamber, as if out of the hearing of Haco, who turned his face towards the fire, and gazed into the fierce blaze with musing, unwinking eyes.  \"Couldst thou think, Harold, that in thy journey, that on the errand of so great fear and hope, I could sit brooding in my chair, and count the stitches on the tremulous hangings?  No; day by day have I sought the lore of Hilda, and at night I have watched with her by the fount, and the elm, and the tomb; and I know that thou hast gone through dire peril; the prison, the war, and the snare; and I know also, that his Fylgia hath saved the life of my Wolnoth; for had he returned to his native land, he had returned but to a bloody grave!\"  \"Says Hilda this?\" said the Earl, thoughtfully.  \"So say the Vala, the rune, and the Scin-laeca! and such is the doom that now darkens the brow of Haco!  Seest thou not that the hand of death is in the hush of the smileless lip, and the glance of the unjoyous eye?\"  \"Nay, it is but the thought born to captive youth, and nurtured in solitary dreams.  Thou hast seen Hilda?--and Edith, my mother?  Edith is--\"  \"Well,\" said Githa, kindly, for she sympathised with that love which Godwin would have condemned, \"though she grieved deeply after thy departure, and would sit for hours gazing into space, and moaning. But even ere Hilda divined thy safe return, Edith knew it; I was beside her at the time; she started up, and cried, 'Harold is in England!'--'How?--Why thinkest thou so?' said I.  And Edith answered, 'I feel it by the touch of the earth, by the breath of the air.'  This is more than love, Harold.  I knew two twins who had the same instinct of each other's comings and goings, and were present each to each even when absent: Edith is twin to my soul.  Thou goest to her now, Harold: thou wilt find there thy sister Thyra.  The child hath drooped of late, and I besought Hilda to revive her, with herb and charm.  Thou wilt come back, ere thou departest to aid Tostig, thy brother, and tell me how Hilda hath prospered with my ailing child?\"  \"I will, my mother.  Be cheered!--Hilda is a skilful nurse.  And now bless thee, that thou hast not reproached me that my mission failed to fulfil my promise.  Welcome even our kinswoman's sayings, sith they comfort thee for the loss of thy darling!\"  Then Harold left the room, mounted his steed, and rode through the town towards the bridge.  He was compelled to ride slowly through the streets, for he was recognised; and cheapman and mechanic rushed from house and from stall to hail the Man of the Land and the Time.  \"All is safe now in England, for Harold is come back!\"  They seemed joyous as the children of the mariner, when, with wet garments, he struggles to shore through the storm.  And kind and loving were Harold's looks and brief words, as he rode with vailed bonnet through the swarming streets.  At length he cleared the town and the bridge; and the yellowing boughs of the orchards drooped over the road towards the Roman home, when, as he spurred his steed, he heard behind him hoofs as in pursuit, looked back, and beheld Haco.  He drew rein,--\"What wantest thou, my nephew?\"  \"Thee!\" answered Haco, briefly, as he gained his side.  \"Thy companionship.\"  \"Thanks, Haco; but I pray thee to stay in my mother's house, for I would fain ride alone.\"  \"Spurn me not from thee, Harold!  This England is to me the land of the stranger; in thy mother's house I feel but the more the orphan. Henceforth I have devoted to thee my life!  And my life my dead and dread father hath left to thee, as a doom or a blessing; wherefore cleave I to thy side;--cleave we in life and in death to each other!\"  An undefined and cheerless thrill shot through the Earl's heart as the youth spoke thus; and the remembrance that Haco's counsel had first induced him to abandon his natural hardy and gallant manhood, meet wile by wile, and thus suddenly entangle him in his own meshes, had already mingled an inexpressible bitterness with his pity and affection for his brother's son.  But, struggling against that uneasy sentiment, as unjust towards one to whose counsel--however sinister, and now repented--he probably owed, at least, his safety and deliverance, he replied gently:  \"I accept thy trust and thy love, Haco!  Ride with me, then; but pardon a dull comrade, for when the soul communes with itself the lip is silent.\"  \"True,\" said Haco, \"and I am no babbler.  Three things are ever silent: Thought, Destiny, and the Grave.\"  Each then, pursuing his own fancies, rode on fast, and side by side; the long shadows of declining day struggling with a sky of unusual brightness, and thrown from the dim forest trees and the distant hillocks.  Alternately through shade and through light rode they on; the bulls gazing on them from holt and glade, and the boom of the bittern sounding in its peculiar mournfulness of toile as it rose from the dank pools that glistened in the western sun.  It was always by the rear of the house, where stood the ruined temple, so associated with the romance of his life, that Harold approached the home of the Vala; and as now the hillock, with its melancholy diadem of stones, came in view, Haco for the first time broke the silence.  \"Again--as in a dream!\" he said, abruptly.  \"Hill, ruin, grave-mound-- but where the tall image of the mighty one?\"  \"Hast thou then seen this spot before?\" asked the Earl.  \"Yea, as an infant here was I led by my father Sweyn; here too, from thy house yonder, dim seen through the fading leaves, on the eve before I left this land for the Norman, here did I wander alone; and there, by that altar, did the great Vala of the North chaunt her runes for my future.\"  \"Alas! thou too!\" murmured Harold; and then he asked aloud, \"What said she?\"  \"That thy life and mine crossed each other in the skein; that I should save thee from a great peril, and share with thee a greater.\"  \"Ah, youth,\" answered Harold, bitterly, \"these vain prophecies of human wit guard the soul from no anger.  They mislead us by riddles which our hot hearts interpret according to their own desires.  Keep thou fast to youth's simple wisdom, and trust only to the pure spirit and the watchful God.\"  He suppressed a groan as he spoke, and springing from his steed, which he left loose, advanced up the hill.  When he had gained the height, he halted, and made sign to Haco, who had also dismounted, to do the same.  Half way down the side of the slope which faced the ruined peristyle, Haco beheld a maiden, still young, and of beauty surpassing all that the court of Normandy boasted of female loveliness.  She was seated on the sward;--while a girl younger, and scarcely indeed grown into womanhood, reclined at her feet, and leaning her cheek upon her hand, seemed hushed in listening attention.  In the face of the younger girl Haco recognised Thyra, the last-born of Githa, though he had but once seen her before--the day ere he left England for the Norman court--for the face of the girl was but little changed, save that the eye was more mournful, and the cheek was paler.  And Harold's betrothed was singing, in the still autumn air, to Harold's sister.  The song chosen was on that subject the most popular with the Saxon poets, the mystic life, death, and resurrection of the fabled Phoenix, and this rhymeless song, in its old native flow, may yet find some grace in the modern ear.      THE LAY OF THE PHOENIX. [206]      \"Shineth far hence--so        Sing the wise elders      Far to the fire-east        The fairest of lands.       Daintily dight is that        Dearest of joy fields;      Breezes all balmy-filled        Glide through its groves.       There to the blest, ope        The high doors of heaven,      Sweetly sweep earthward        Their wavelets of song.       Frost robes the sward not,        Rusheth no hail-steel;      Wind-cloud ne'er wanders,        Ne'er falleth the rain.       Warding the woodholt,        Girt with gay wonder,      Sheen with the plumy shine,        Phoenix abides.       Lord of the Lleod, [207]        Whose home is the air,      Winters a thousand        Abideth the bird.       Hapless and heavy then        Waxeth the hazy wing;      Year-worn and old in the        Whirl of the earth.       Then the high holt-top,        Mounting, the bird soars;      There, where the winds sleep,        He buildeth a nest;--       Gums the most precious, and        Balms of the sweetest,      Spices and odours, he        Weaves in the nest.       There, in that sun-ark, lo,        Waiteth he wistful;      Summer comes smiling, lo,        Rays smite the pile!       Burden'd with eld-years, and        Weary with slow time,      Slow in his odour-nest        Burneth the bird.

Weaving bliss-meshes        Around and around it,      Silent and blissful, the        Worm worketh on.       Lo, from the airy web,        Blooming and brightsome,      Young and exulting, the        Phoenix breaks forth.       Round him the birds troop,        Singing and hailing;      Wings of all glories        Engarland the king.       Hymning and hailing,        Through forest and sun-air,      Hymning and hailing,        And speaking him 'King.'       High flies the phoenix,        Escaped from the worm-web      He soars in the sunlight,        He bathes in the dew.       He visits his old haunts,        The holt and the sun-hill;      The founts of his youth, and        The fields of his love.       The stars in the welkin,        The blooms on the earth,      Are glad in his gladness,        Are young in his youth.       While round him the birds troop,        the Hosts of the Himmel, [208]      Blisses of music, and        Glories of wings;       Hymning and hailing,        And filling the sun-air      With music, and glory        And praise of the King.\"  As the lay ceased, Thyra said:  \"Ah, Edith, who would not brave the funeral pyre to live again like the phoenix!\"  \"Sweet sister mine,\" answered Edith, \"the singer doth mean to image out in the phoenix the rising of our Lord, in whom we all live again.\"  And Thyra said, mournfully:  \"But the phoenix sees once more the haunts of his youth--the things and places dear to him in his life before.  Shall we do the same, O Edith?\"  \"It is the persons we love that make beautiful the haunts we have known,\" answered the betrothed.  \"Those persons at least we shall behold again, and whenever they are--there is heaven.\"  Harold could restrain himself no longer.  With one bound he was at Edith's side, and with one wild cry of joy he clasped her to his heart.  \"I knew that thou wouldst come to-night--I knew it, Harold,\" murmured the betrothed.     CHAPTER III.   While, full of themselves, Harold and Edith wandered, hand in hand, through the neighbouring glades--while into that breast which had forestalled, at least, in this pure and sublime union, the wife's privilege to soothe and console, the troubled man poured out the tale of the sole trial from which he had passed with defeat and shame,-- Haco drew near to Thyra, and sate down by her side.  Each was strangely attracted towards the other; there was something congenial in the gloom which they shared in common; though in the girl the sadness was soft and resigned, in the youth it was stern and solemn. They conversed in whispers, and their talk was strange for companions so young; for, whether suggested by Edith's song, or the neighbourhood of the Saxon grave-stone, which gleamed on their eyes, grey and wan through the crommell, the theme they selected was of death.  As if fascinated, as children often are, by the terrors of the Dark King, they dwelt on those images with which the northern fancy has associated the eternal rest, on--the shroud and the worm, and the mouldering bones--on the gibbering ghost, and the sorcerer's spell that could call the spectre from the grave.  They talked of the pain of the parting soul, parting while earth was yet fair, youth fresh, and joy not yet ripened from the blossom--of the wistful lingering look which glazing eyes would give to the latest sunlight it should behold on earth; and then he pictured the shivering and naked soul, forced from the reluctant clay, wandering through cheerless space to the intermediate tortures, which the Church taught that none were so pure as not for a whole to undergo; and hearing, as it wandered, the knell of the muffled bells and the burst of unavailing prayer.  At length Haco paused abruptly and said:  \"But thou, cousin, hast before thee love and sweet life, and these discourses are not for thee.\"  Thyra shook her head mournfully:  \"Not so, Haco; for when Hilda consulted the runes, while, last night, she mingled the herbs for my pain, which rests ever hot and sharp here,\" and the girl laid her hand on her breast, \"I saw that her face grew dark and overcast; and I felt, as I looked, that my doom was set. And when thou didst come so noiselessly to my side, with thy sad, cold eyes, O Haco, methought I saw the Messenger of Death.  But thou art strong, Haco, and life will be long for thee; let us talk of life.\"  Haco stooped down and pressed his lips upon the girl's pale forehead.  \"Kiss me too, Thyra.\"  The child kissed him, and they sate silent and close by each other, while the sun set.  And as the stars rose, Harold and Edith joined them.  Harold's face was serene in the starlight, for the pure soul of his betrothed had breathed peace into his own; and, in his willing superstition, he felt as if, now restored to his guardian angel, the dead men's bones had released their unhallowed hold.  But suddenly Edith's hand trembled in his, and her form shuddered.-- Her eyes were fixed upon those of Haco.  \"Forgive me, young kinsman, that I forget thee so long,\" said the Earl.  \"This is my brother's son, Edith; thou hast not, that I remember, seen him before?\"  \"Yes, yes;\" said Edith, falteringly.  \"When, and where?\"  Edith's soul answered the question, \"In a dream;\" but her lips were silent.  And Haco, rising, took her by the hand, while the Earl turned to his sister--that sister whom he was pledged to send to the Norman court; and Thyra said, plaintively:  \"Take me in thine arms, Harold, and wrap thy mantle round me, for the air is cold.\"  The Earl lifted the child to his breast, and gazed on her cheek long and wistfully; then questioning her tenderly, he took her within the house; and Edith followed with Haco.  \"Is Hilda within?\" asked the son of Sweyn.  \"Nay, she hath been in the forest since noon,\" answered Edith with an effort, for she could not recover her awe of his presence.  \"Then,\" said Haco, halting at the threshold, \"I will go across the woodland to your house, Harold, and prepare your ceorls for your coming.\"  \"I shall tarry here till Hilda returns,\" answered Harold, and it may be late in the night ere I reach home; but Sexwolf already hath my orders.  At sunrise we return to London, and thence we march on the insurgents.\"  \"All shall be ready.  Farewell, noble Edith; and thou, Thyra my cousin, one kiss more to our meeting again.\"  The child fondly held out her arms to him, and as she kissed his cheek whispered:  \"In the grave, Haco!\"  The young man drew his mantle around him, and moved away.  But he did not mount his steed, which still grazed by the road; while Harold's, more familiar with the place, had found its way to the stall; nor did he take his path through the glades to the house of his kinsman. Entering the Druid temple, he stood musing by the Teuton tomb.  The night grew deeper and deeper, the stars more luminous and the air more hushed, when a voice close at his side, said, clear and abrupt:  \"What does Youth the restless, by Death the still?\"  It was the peculiarity of Haco, that nothing ever seemed to startle or surprise him.  In that brooding boyhood, the solemn, quiet, and sad experience all fore-armed, of age, had something in it terrible and preternatural; so without lifting his eyes from the stone, he answered:  \"How sayest thou, O Hilda, that the dead are still?\"  Hilda placed her hand on his shoulder, and stooped to look into his face.  \"Thy rebuke is just, son of Sweyn.  In Time, and in the Universe, there is no stillness!  Through all eternity the state impossible to the soul is repose!--So again thou art in thy native land?\"  \"And for what end, Prophetess?  I remember, when but an infant, who till then had enjoyed the common air and the daily sun, thou didst rob me evermore of childhood and youth.  For thou didst say to my father, that 'dark was the woof of my fate, and that its most glorious hour should be its last!'\"  \"But thou wert surely too childlike, (see thee now as thou wert then, stretched on the grass, and playing with thy father's falcon!)--too childlike to heed my words.\"  \"Does the new ground reject the germs of the sower, or the young heart the first lessons of wonder and awe?  Since then, Prophetess, Night hath been my comrade, and Death my familiar.  Rememberest thou again the hour when, stealing, a boy, from Harold's house in his absence-- the night ere I left my land--I stood on this mound by thy side?  Then did I tell thee that the sole soft thought that relieved the bitterness of my soul, when all the rest of my kinsfolk seemed to behold in me but the heir of Sweyn, the outlaw and homicide, was the love that I bore to Harold; but that that love itself was mournful and bodeful as the hwata [209] of distant sorrow.  And thou didst take me, O Prophetess, to thy bosom, and thy cold kiss touched my lips and my brow; and there, beside this altar and grave-mound, by leaf and by water, by staff and by song, thou didst bid me take comfort; for that as the mouse gnawed the toils of the lion, so the exile obscure should deliver from peril the pride and the prince of my House--that, from that hour with the skein of his fate should mine be entwined; and his fate was that of kings and of kingdoms.  And then, when the joy flushed my cheek, and methought youth came back in warmth to the night of my soul--then, Hilda, I asked thee if my life would be spared till I had redeemed the name of my father.  Thy seidstaff passed over the leaves that, burning with fire-sparks, symbolled the life of the man, and from the third leaf the flame leaped up and died; and again a voice from thy breast, hollow, as if borne from a hill-top afar, made answer, 'At thine entrance to manhood life bursts into blaze, and shrivels up into ashes.'  So I knew that the doom of the infant still weighed unannealed on the years of the man; and I come here to my native land as to glory and the grave.  But,\" said the young man, with a wild"]]]
