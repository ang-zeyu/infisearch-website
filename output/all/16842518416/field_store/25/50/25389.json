'To tell you the truth, St. Simon,' said the Regent, laughing, 'I only consent to have him banished, from a firm conviction that if I do not Dubois will take some opportunity of having him beheaded.'\"  \"Pray,\" said I, smiling with a tolerably good grace, \"pray give my most grateful and humble thanks to his Highness, for his very considerate and kind foresight.  I could not have chosen better for myself than his Highness has chosen for me: my only regret on quitting France is at leaving a prince so affable as Philip and a courtier so virtuous as St. Simon.\"  Though the good Duc went every year to the Abbey de la Trappe for the purpose of mortifying his sins and preserving his religion in so impious an atmosphere as the Palais Royal, he was not above flattery; and he expressed himself towards me with particular kindness after my speech.  At court, one becomes a sort of human ant-bear, and learns to catch one's prey by one's tongue.  After we had eased ourselves a little by abusing Dubois, the Duc took his leave in order to allow me time to prepare for my \"journey,\" as he politely called it.  Before he left, he, however, asked me whither my course would be bent?  I told him that I should take my chance with the Czar Peter, and see if his czarship thought the same esteem was due to the disgraced courtier as to the favoured diplomatist.  That night I received a letter from St. Simon, enclosing one addressed with all due form to the Czar.  \"You will consider the enclosed,\" wrote St. Simon, \"a fresh proof of the Regent's kindness to you; it is a most flattering testimonial in your favour, and cannot fail to make the Czar anxious to secure your services.\"  I was not a little touched by a kindness so unusual in princes to their discarded courtiers, and this entirely reconciled me to a change of scene which, indeed, under any other circumstances, my somewhat morbid love for action and variety would have induced me rather to relish than dislike.  Within thirty-six hours from the time of dismissal, I had turned my back upon the French capital.    CHAPTER VI.  A LONG INTERVAL OF YEARS.--A CHANGE OF MIND AND ITS CAUSES.  THE last accounts received of the Czar reported him to be at Dantzic. He had, however, quitted that place when I arrived there.  I lost no time in following him, and presented myself to his Majesty one day after his dinner, when he was sitting with one leg in the Czarina's lap and a bottle of the best /eau de vie/ before him.  I had chosen my time well; he received me most graciously, read my letter from the Regent--about which, remembering the fate of Bellerophon, I had had certain apprehensions, but which proved to be in the highest degree complimentary--and then declared himself extremely happy to see me again.  However parsimonious Peter generally was towards foreigners, I never had ground for personal complaint on that score.  The very next day I was appointed to a post of honour and profit about the royal person; from this I was transferred to a military station, in which I rose with great rapidity; and I was only occasionally called from my warlike duties to be intrusted with diplomatic missions of the highest confidence and importance.  It is this portion of my life--a portion of nine years to the time of the Czar's death--that I shall, in this history, the most concentrate and condense.  In truth, were I to dwell upon it at length, I should make little more than a mere record of political events; differing, in some respects, it is true, from the received histories of the time, but containing nothing to compensate in utility for the want of interest. That this was the exact age for adventurers, Alberoni and Dubois are sufficient proofs.  Never was there a more stirring, active, restless period; never one in which the genius of intrigue was so pervadingly at work.  I was not less fortunate than my brethren.  Although scarcely four and twenty when I entered the Czar's service, my habits of intimacy with men much older; my customary gravity, reserve, and thought; my freedom, since Isora's death, from youthful levity or excess; my early entrance into the world; and a countenance prematurely marked with the lines of reflection and sobered by its hue,--made me appear considerably older than I was.  I kept my own counsel, and affected to be so: youth is a great enemy to one's success; and more esteem is often bestowed upon a wrinkled brow than a plodding brain.  All the private intelligence which during this space of time I had received from England was far from voluminous.  My mother still enjoyed the quiet of her religious retreat.  A fire, arising from the negligence of a servant, had consumed nearly the whole of Devereux Court (the fine old house! till /that/ went, I thought even England held one friend). Upon this accident, Gerald had gone to London; and, though there was now no doubt of his having been concerned in the Rebellion of 1715, he had been favourably received at court, and was already renowned throughout London for his pleasures, his excesses, and his munificent profusion.  Montreuil, whose lot seemed to be always to lose by intrigue what he gained by the real solidity of his genius, had embarked very largely in the rash but gigantic schemes of Gortz and Alberoni; schemes which, had they succeeded, would not only have placed a new king upon the English throne, but wrought an utter change over the whole face of Europe.  With Alberoni and with Gortz fell Montreuil.  He was banished France and Spain; the penalty of death awaited him in Britain; and he was supposed to have thrown himself into some convent in Italy, where his name and his character were unknown.  In this brief intelligence was condensed all my information of the actors in my first scenes of life.  I return to that scene on which I had now entered.  At the age of thirty-three I had acquired a reputation sufficient to content my ambition; my fortune was larger than my wants; I was a favourite in courts; I had been successful in camps; I had already obtained all that would have rewarded the whole lives of many men superior to myself in merit, more ardent than myself in desires.  I was still young; my appearance, though greatly altered, manhood had rather improved than impaired.  I had not forestalled my constitution by excesses, nor worn dry the sources of pleasure by too large a demand upon their capacities; why was it then, at that golden age, in the very prime and glory of manhood, in the very zenith and summer of success, that a deep, dark, pervading melancholy fell upon me? a melancholy so gloomy that it seemed to me as a thick and impenetrable curtain drawn gradually between myself and the blessed light of human enjoyment.  A torpor crept upon me; an indolent, heavy, clinging languor gathered over my whole frame, the physical and the mental: I sat for hours without book, paper, object, thought, gazing on vacancy, stirring not, feeling not,--yes, feeling, but feeling only one sensation, a sick, sad, drooping despondency, a sinking in of the heart, a sort of gnawing within as if something living were twisted round my vitals, and, finding no other food, preyed, though with a sickly and dull maw, upon /them/. This disease came upon me slowly: it was not till the beginning of the second year, from its obvious and palpable commencement, that it grew to the height that I have described.  It began with a distaste to all that I had been accustomed to enjoy or to pursue.  Music, which I had always passionately loved, though from some defect in the organs of hearing, I was incapable of attaining the smallest knowledge of the science, music lost all its diviner spells, all its properties of creating a new existence, a life of dreaming and vain luxuries, within the mind: it became only a monotonous sound, less grateful to the languor of my faculties than an utter and dead stillness.  I had never been what is generally termed a boon companion; but I had had the social vanities, if not the social tastes; I had insensibly loved the board which echoed with applause at my sallies, and the comrades who, while they deprecated my satire, had been complaisant enough to hail it as wit.  One of my weaknesses is a love of show, and I had gratified a feeling not the less cherished because it arose from a petty source, in obtaining for my equipages, my mansion, my banquets, the celebrity which is given no less to magnificence than to fame: now I grew indifferent alike to the signs of pomp, and to the baubles of taste; praise fell upon a listless ear, and (rare pitch of satiety!) the pleasures that are the offspring of our foibles delighted me no more.  I had early learned from Bolingbroke a love for the converse of men, eminent, whether for wisdom or for wit: the graceful /badinage,/ or the keen critique; the sparkling flight of the winged words which circled and rebounded from lip to lip, or the deep speculation upon the mysterious and unravelled wonders of man, of Nature, and the world; the light maxim upon manners, or the sage inquiry into the mines of learning, all and each had possessed a link to bind my temper and my tastes to the graces and fascination of social life.  Now a new spirit entered within me: the smile faded from my lip, and the jest departed from my tongue; memory seemed no less treacherous than fancy, and deserted me the instant I attempted to enter into those contests of knowledge in which I had been not undistinguished before.  I grew confused and embarrassed in speech; my words expressed a sense utterly different to that which I had intended to convey; and at last, as my apathy increased, I sat at my own board, silent and lifeless, freezing into ice the very powers and streams of converse which I had once been the foremost to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7628"],["title","Devereux — Volume 05 (#8)"],["body"," and to warm.  At the time I refer to, I was Minister at one of the small Continental courts, where life is a round of unmeaning etiquette and wearisome ceremonials, a daily labour of trifles, a ceaseless pageantry of nothings.  I had been sent there upon one important event; the business resulting from it had soon ceased, and all the duties that remained for me to discharge were of a negative and passive nature.  Nothing that could arouse, nothing that could occupy faculties that had for years been so perpetually wound up to a restless excitement, was left for me in this terrible reservoir of /ennui/.  I had come thither at once from the skirmishing and wild warfare of a Tartar foe; a war in which, though the glory was obscure, the action was perpetual and exciting.  I had come thither, and the change was as if I had passed from a mountain stream to a stagnant pool.  Society at this court reminded me of a state funeral: everything was pompous and lugubrious, even to the drapery--even to the feathers--which, in other scenes, would have been consecrated to associations of levity or of grace; the hourly pageant swept on slow, tedious, mournful, and the object of the attendants was only to entomb the Pleasure which they affected  celebrate.  What a change for the wild, the strange, the novel, the intriguing, the varying life, which, whether in courts or camps, I had hitherto led!  The internal change that came over myself is scarcely to be wondered at; the winds stood still, and the straw they had blown from quarter to quarter, whether in anger or in sport, began to moulder upon the spot where they had left it.  From this cessation of the aims, hopes, and thoughts of life I was awakened by the spreading, as it were, of another disease: the dead, dull, aching pain at my heart was succeeded by one acute and intense; the absence of thought gave way to one thought more terrible, more dark, more despairing than any which had haunted me since the first year of Isora's death; and from a numbness and pause, as it were, of existence, existence became too keen and intolerable a sense.  I will enter into an explanation.  At the court of ------, there was an Italian, not uncelebrated for his wisdom, nor unbeloved for an innocence and integrity of life rarely indeed to be met with among his countrymen.  The acquaintance of this man, who was about fifty years of age, and who was devoted almost exclusively to the pursuit of philosophical science, I had sedulously cultivated.  His conversation pleased me; his wisdom improved; and his benevolence, which reminded me of the traits of La Fontaine, it was so infantine, made me incline to love him.  Upon the growth of the fearful malady of mind which seized me, I had discontinued my visits and my invitations to the Italian; and Bezoni (so was he called) felt a little offended by my neglect.  As soon, however, as he discovered my state of mind, the good man's resentment left him.  He forced himself upon my solitude, and would sit by me whole evenings,--sometimes without exchanging a word, sometimes with vain attempts to interest, to arouse, or to amuse me.  At last, one evening--it was the era of a fearful suffering to me--our conversation turned upon those subjects which are at once the most important and the most rarely discussed.  We spoke of /religion/.  We first talked upon the theology of revealed religion.  As Bezoni warmed into candour, I perceived that his doctrines differed from my own, and that he inly disbelieved that divine creed which Christians profess to adore.  From a dispute on the ground of faith, we came to one upon the more debatable ground of reason.  We turned from the subject of revealed to that of natural religion; and we entered long and earnestly into that grandest of all earthly speculations,--the metaphysical proofs of the immortality of the soul.  Again the sentiments of Bezoni were opposed to mine.  He was a believer in the dark doctrine which teaches that man is dust and that all things are forgotten in the grave.  He expressed his opinions with a clearness and precision the more impressive because totally devoid of cavil and of rhetoric.  I listened in silence, but with a deep and most chilling dismay.  Even now I think I see the man as he sat before me, the light of the lamp falling on his high forehead and dark features; even now I think I hear his calm, low voice--the silver voice of his country--stealing to my heart, and withering the only pure and unsullied hope which I yet cherished there.  Bezoni left me, unconscious of the anguish he bequeathed me, to think over all he had said.  I did not sleep nor even retire to bed.  I laid my head upon my hands, and surrendered myself to turbulent yet intense reflection.  Every man who has lived much in the world, and conversed with its various tribes, has, I fear, met with many who, on this momentous subject, profess the same tenets as Bezoni.  But he was the first person I had met of that sect who had evidently thought long and deeply upon the creed he had embraced.  He was not a voluptuary nor a boaster nor a wit.  He had not been misled by the delusions either of vanity or of the senses.  He was a man pure, innocent, modest, full of all tender charities and meek dispositions towards mankind: it was evidently his interest to believe in a future state; he could have had nothing to fear from it.  Not a single passion did he cherish which the laws of another world would have condemned.  Add to this, what I have observed before, that he was not a man fond of the display of intellect, nor one that brought to the discussions of wisdom the artillery of wit. He was grave, humble, and self-diffident, beyond all beings.  I would have given a kingdom to have found something in the advocate by which I could have condemned the cause: I could not, and I was wretched.  I spent the whole of the next week among my books.  I ransacked whatever in my scanty library the theologians had written or the philosophers had bequeathed upon that mighty secret.  I arranged their arguments in my mind.  I armed myself with their weapons.  I felt my heart spring joyously within me as I felt the strength I had acquired, and I sent to the philosopher to visit me, that I might conquer and confute him.  He came; but he spoke with pain and reluctance.  He saw that I had taken the matter far more deeply to heart than he could have supposed it possible in a courtier and a man of fortune and the world.  Little did he know of me or my secret soul.  I broke down his reserve at last.  I unrolled my arguments.  I answered his, and we spent the whole night in controversy.  He left me, and I was more bewildered than ever.  To speak truth, he had devoted years to the subject: I had devoted only a week.  He had come to his conclusions step by step; he had reached the great ultimatum with slowness, with care, and, he confessed, with anguish and with reluctance.  What a match was I, who brought a hasty temper, and a limited reflection on that subject to a reasoner like this?  His candour staggered and chilled me even more than his logic. Arguments that occurred not to me, upon my side of the question, /he/ stated at length and with force; I heard, and, till he replied to them, I deemed they were unanswerable: the reply came, and I had no counter-word.  A meeting of this nature was often repeated; and when he left me, tears crept into my wild eyes, my heart melted within me, and I wept!  I must now enter more precisely than I have yet done into my state of mind upon religious matters at the time this dispute with the Italian occurred.  To speak candidly, I had been far less shocked with his opposition to me upon matters of doctrinal faith than with that upon matters of abstract reasoning.  Bred a Roman Catholic, though pride, consistency, custom, made me externally adhere to the Papal Church, I inly perceived its errors and smiled at its superstitions.  And in the busy world, where so little but present objects or /human/ anticipations of the future engross the attention, I had never given the subject that consideration which would have enabled me (as it has since) to separate the dogmas of the priest from the precepts of the Saviour, and thus confirmed my belief as the Christian by the very means which would have loosened it as the Sectarian.  So that at the time Bezoni knew me a certain indifference to--perhaps arising from an ignorance of--doctrinal points, rendered me little hurt by arguments against opinions which I embraced indeed, but with a lukewarm and imperfect affection.  But it was far otherwise upon abstract points of reasoning, far otherwise, when the hope of surviving this frail and most unhallowed being was to be destroyed:  I might have been indifferent to cavil upon /what/ was the word of God, but never to question of the justice of God Himself.  In the whole world there was not a more ardent believer in our imperishable nature, nor one more deeply interested in the belief.  Do not let it be supposed that because I have not often recurred to Isora's death (or because I have continued my history in a jesting and light tone) that that event ever passed from the memory which it had turned to bitterness and gall.  Never in the masses of intrigue, in the festivals of pleasure, in the tumults of ambition, in the blaze of a licentious court, or by the rude tents of a barbarous host,--never, my buried love, had I forgotten thee!  That remembrance, had no other cause existed, would have led me to God.  Every night, in whatever toils or whatever objects, whatever failures or triumphs, the day had been consumed; every night before I laid my head upon my widowed and lonely pillow,--I had knelt down and lifted my heart to Heaven, blending the hopes of that Heaven with the memory and the vision of Isora.  Prayer had seemed to me a commune not only with the living God, but with the dead by whom His dwelling is surrounded.  Pleasant and soft was it to "]]]
