Because, as thou knowest well, Algar and I have ever been opposed, both in camp and in council; and I am not the man who can sell my love, though I may stifle my anger.  Earl Harold needs no bride to bring spearmen to his back at his need; and his lordships he will guard with the shield of a man, not the spindle of a woman.\"  \"Said in spite and in error,\" replied the old Earl, coolly.  \"Small pain had it given thee to forgive Algar old quarrels, and clasp his hand as a father-in-law--if thou hadst had for his daughter what the great are forbidden to regard save as a folly.\"  \"Is love a folly, my father?\"  \"Surely, yes,\" said the Earl, with some sadness--\"surely, yes, for those who know that life is made up of business and care, spun out in long years, nor counted by the joys of an hour.  Surely, yes; thinkest thou that I loved my first wife, the proud sister of Canute, or that Edith, thy sister, loved Edward, when he placed the crown on her head?\"  \"My father, in Edith, my sister, our House has sacrificed enow to selfish power.\"  \"I grant it, to selfish power,\" answered the eloquent old man, \"but not enow for England's safety.  Look to it, Harold; thy years, and thy fame, and thy state, place thee free from my control as a father, but not till thou sleepest in thy cerements art thou free from that father--thy land!  Ponder it in thine own wise mind--wiser already than that which speaks to it under the hood of grey hairs.  Ponder it, and ask thyself if thy power, when I am dead, is not necessary to the weal of England? and if aught that thy schemes can suggest would so strengthen that power, as to find in the heart of the kingdom a host of friends like the Mercians;--or if there could be a trouble and a bar to thy greatness, a wall in thy path, or a thorn in thy side, like the hate or the jealousy of Algar, the son of Leofric?\"  Thus addressed, Harold's face, before serene and calm, grew overcast; and he felt the force of his father's words when appealing to his reason--not to his affections.  The old man saw the advantage he had gained, and prudently forbore to press it.  Rising, he drew round him his sweeping gonna lined with furs, and only when he reached the door, he added:  \"The old see afar; they stand on the height of experience, as a warder on the crown of a tower; and I tell thee, Harold, that if thou let slip this golden occasion, years hence--long and many--thou wilt rue the loss of the hour.  And that, unless Mercia, as the centre of the kingdom, be reconciled to thy power, thou wilt stand high indeed--but on the shelf of a precipice.  And if, as I suspect, thou lovest some other who now clouds thy perception, and will then check thy ambition, thou wilt break her heart with thy desertion, or gnaw thine own with regret.  For love dies in possession--ambition has no fruition, and so lives forever.\"  \"That ambition is not mine, my father,\" exclaimed Harold, earnestly; \"I have not thy love of power, glorious in thee, even in its extremes. I have not thy----\"  \"Seventy years!\" interrupted the old man, concluding the sentence. \"At seventy all men who have been great will speak as I do; yet all will have known love.  Thou not ambitious, Harold?  Thou knowest not thyself, nor knowest thou yet what ambition is.  That which I see far before me as thy natural prize, I dare not, or I will not say.  When time sets that prize within reach of thy spear's point, say then, 'I am not ambitious!'  Ponder and decide.\"  And Harold pondered long, and decided not as Godwin could have wished. For he had not the seventy years of his father, and the prize lay yet in the womb of the mountains; though the dwarf and the gnome were already fashioning the ore to the shape of a crown.     CHAPTER VI.   While Harold mused over his father's words, Edith, seated on a low stool beside the Lady of England, listened with earnest but mournful reverence to her royal namesake.  The Queen's [113] closet opened like the King's on one hand to an oratory, on the other to a spacious ante-room; the lower part of the walls was covered with arras, leaving space for a niche that contained an image of the Virgin.  Near the doorway to the oratory, was the stoupe or aspersorium for holy-water; and in various cysts and crypts, in either room, were caskets containing the relics of saints.  The purple light from the stained glass of a high narrow window, shaped in the Saxon arch, streamed rich and full over the Queen's bended head like a glory, and tinged her pale cheek, as with a maiden blush; and she might have furnished a sweet model for early artist, in his dreams of St. Mary the Mother, not when, young and blest, she held the divine infant in her arms, but when sorrow had reached even the immaculate bosom, and the stone had been rolled over the Holy Sepulchre.  For beautiful the face still was, and mild beyond all words; but, beyond all words also, sad in its tender resignation.  And thus said the Queen to her godchild:  \"Why dost thou hesitate and turn away?  Thinkest thou, poor child, in thine ignorance of life, that the world ever can give thee a bliss greater than the calm of the cloister?  Pause, and ask thyself, young as thou art, if all the true happiness thou hast known, is not bounded to hope.  As long as thou hopest, thou art happy.\"  Edith sighed deeply, and moved her young head in involuntary acquiescence.  \"And what is life to the nun, but hope.  In that hope, she knows not the present, she lives in the future; she hears ever singing the chorus of the angels, as St. Dunstan heard them sing at the birth of Edgar [114].  That hope unfolds to her the heiligthum of the future. On earth her body, in heaven her soul!\"  \"And her heart, O Lady of England?\" cried Edith, with a sharp pang.  The Queen paused a moment, and laid her pale hand kindly on Edith's bosom.  \"Not beating, child, as thine does now, with vain thoughts, and worldly desires; but calm, calm as mine.  It is in our power,\" resumed the Queen, after a second pause, \"it is in our power to make the life within us all soul; so that the heart is not, or is felt not; so that grief and joy have no power over us; so that we look tranquil on the stormy earth, as yon image of the Virgin, whom we make our example, looks from the silent niche.  Listen, my godchild and darling.\"  \"I have known human state, and human debasement.  In these halls I woke Lady of England, and, ere sunset, my lord banished me, without one mark of honour, without one word of comfort, to the convent of Wherwell;--my father, my mother, my kin, all in exile; and my tears falling fast for them, but not on a husband's bosom.\"  \"Ah then, noble Edith,\" said the girl, colouring with anger at the remembered wrong for her Queen, \"ah then, surely, at least, thy heart made itself heard.\"  \"Heard, yea verily,\" said the Queen, looking up, and pressing her hands; \"heard, but the soul rebuked it.  And the soul said, 'Blessed are they that mourn;' and I rejoiced at the new trial which brought me nearer to Him who chastens those He loves.\"  \"But thy banished kin--the valiant, the wise; they who placed thy lord on the throne?\"  \"Was it no comfort,\" answered the Queen simply, \"to think that in the House of God my prayers for them would be more accepted than in the halls of kings?  Yes, my child, I have known the world's honour, and the world's disgrace, and I have schooled my heart to be calm in both.\"  \"Ah, thou art above human strength, Queen and Saint,\" exclaimed Edith; \"and I have heard it said of thee, that as thou art now, thou wert from thine earliest years [115]; ever the sweet, the calm, the holy-- ever less on earth than in heaven.\"  Something there was in the Queen's eyes, as she raised them towards Edith at this burst of enthusiasm, that gave for a moment, to a face otherwise so dissimilar, the likeness to her father; something, in that large pupil, of the impenetrable unrevealing depth of a nature close and secret in self-control.  And a more acute observer than Edith might long have been perplexed and haunted with that look, wondering if, indeed, under the divine and spiritual composure, lurked the mystery of human passion.  \"My child,\" said the Queen, with the faintest smile upon her lips, and drawing Edith towards her, \"there are moments when all that breathe the breath of life feel, or have felt, alike.  In my vain youth I read, I mused, I pondered, but over worldly lore.  And what men called the sanctity of virtue, was perhaps but the silence of thought.  Now I have put aside those early and childish dreams and shadows, remembering them not, save (here the smile grew more pronounced) to puzzle some poor schoolboy with the knots and riddles of the sharp grammarian [116].  But not to speak of my self have I sent for thee. Edith, again and again, solemnly and sincerely, I pray thee to obey the wish of my lord the King.  And now, while yet in all the bloom of thought, as of youth, while thou hast no memory save the child's, enter on the Realm of Peace.\"  \"I cannot, I dare not, I cannot--ah, ask me not,\" said poor Edith, covering her face with her hands.  Those hands the Queen gently withdrew; and looking steadfastly in the changeful and half-averted face, she said mournfully, \"Is it so, my godchild? and is thy heart set on the hopes of earth--thy dreams on the love of man?\"  \"Nay,\" answered Edith, equivocating; \"but I have promised not to take the veil.\"  \"Promised to Hilda?\"  \"Hilda,\" exclaimed Edith readily, \"would never consent to it.  Thou knowest her strong nature, her distaste to--to----\"  \"The laws of our holy Church--I do; and for that reason it is, mainly, that I join with the King in seeking to abstract thee from her influence.  But it is not Hilda that thou hast promised?\"  Edith hung her head.  \"Is it to woman or to man?\"  Before Edith could answer the door from the ante-room opened gently, but without the usual ceremony, and Harold"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7675"],["title","Harold : the Last of the Saxon Kings — Volume 04 (#6)"],["body","ntered.  His quick quiet eye embraced both forms, and curbed Edith's young impulse, which made her start from her seat, and advance joyously towards him as a protector.  \"Fair day to thee, my sister,\" said the Earl, advancing; and pardon, if I break thus rudely on thy leisure; for few are the moments when beggar and Benedictine leave thee free to receive thy brother.\"  \"Dost thou reproach me, Harold?\"  \"No, Heaven forfend!\" replied the Earl, cordially, and with a look at once of pity and admiration; \"for thou art one of the few, in this court of simulators, sincere and true; and it pleases thee to serve the Divine Power in thy way, as it pleases me to serve Him in mine.\"  \"Thine, Harold?\" said the Queen, shaking her head, but with a look of some human pride and fondness in her fair face.  \"Mine; as I learned it from thee when I was thy pupil, Edith; when to those studies in which thou didst precede me, thou first didst lure me from sport and pastime; and from thee I learned to glow over the deeds of Greek and Roman, and say, 'They lived and died as men; like them may I live and die!'\"  \"Oh, true--too true!\" said the Queen, with a sigh; \"and I am to blame grievously that I did so pervert to earth a mind that might otherwise have learned holier examples;--nay, smile not with that haughty lip, my brother; for believe me--yea, believe me--there is more true valour in the life of one patient martyr than in the victories of Caesar, or even the defeat of Brutus.\"  \"It may be so,\" replied the Earl, \"but out of the same oak we carve the spear and the cross; and those not worthy to hold the one, may yet not guiltily wield the other.  Each to his path of life--and mine is chosen.\"  Then, changing his voice, with some abruptness, he said, \"But what hast thou been saying to thy fair godchild, that her cheek is pale, and her eyelids seem so heavy?  Edith, Edith, my sister, beware how thou shapest the lot of the martyr without the peace of the saint.  Had Algive the nun been wedded to Sweyn our brother, Sweyn were not wending, barefooted and forlorn, to lay the wrecks of desolated life at the Holy Tomb.\"  \"Harold, Harold!\" faltered the Queen, much struck with his words.  \"But,\" the Earl continued--and something of the pathos which belongs to deep emotion vibrated in the eloquent voice, accustomed to command and persuade--\"we strip not the green leaves for our yulehearths--we gather them up when dry and sere.  Leave youth on the bough--let the bird sing to it--let it play free in the airs of heaven.  Smoke comes from the branch which, cut in the sap, is cast upon the fire, and regret from the heart which is severed from the world while the world is in its May.\"  The Queen paced slowly, but in evident agitation, to and fro the room, and her hands clasped convulsively the rosary round her neck; then, after a pause of thought, she motioned to Edith and, pointing to the oratory, said with forced composure, \"Enter there, and there kneel; commune with thyself, and be still.  Ask for a sign from above--pray for the grace within.  Go; I would speak alone with Harold.\"  Edith crossed her arms on her bosom meekly, and passed into the oratory.  The Queen watched her for a few moments tenderly, as the slight, child-like form bent before the sacred symbol.  Then she closed the door gently, and coming with a quick step to Harold, said, in a low but clear voice, \"Dost thou love the maiden?\"  \"Sister,\" answered the Earl sadly, \"I love her as a man should love woman--more than my life, but less than the ends life lives for.\"  \"Oh, world, world, world!\" cried the Queen, passionately, \"not even to thine own objects art thou true.  O world! O world! thou desirest happiness below, and at every turn, with every vanity, thou tramplest happiness under foot!  Yes, yes; they said to me, 'For the sake of our greatness, thou shalt wed King Edward.'  And I live in the eyes that loathe me--and--and----\"  The Queen, as if conscience-stricken, paused aghast, kissed devoutly the relic suspended to her rosary, and continued, with such calmness that it seemed as if two women were blent in one, so startling was the contrast. \"And I have had my reward, but not from the world!  Even so, Harold the Earl, and Earl's son, thou lovest yon fair child, and she thee; and ye might be happy, if happiness were earth's end; but, though high-born, and of fair temporal possessions, she brings thee not lands broad enough for her dowry, nor troops of kindred to swell thy lithsmen, and she is not a markstone in thy march to ambition; and so thou lovest her as man loves woman--'less than the ends life lives for!'\"  \"Sister,\" said Harold, \"thou speakest as I love to hear thee speak--as my bright-eyed, rose-lipped sister spoke in the days of old; thou speakest as a woman with warm heart, and not as the mummy in the stiff cerements of priestly form; and if thou art with me, and thou wilt give me countenance, I will marry thy godchild, and save her alike from the dire superstitions of Hilda, and the grave of the abhorrent convent.\"  \"But my father--my father!\" cried the Queen, \"who ever bended that soul of steel?\"  \"It is not my father I fear; it is thee and thy monks.  Forgettest thou that Edith and I are within the six banned degrees of the Church?\"  \"True, most true,\" said the Queen, with a look of great terror; \"I had forgotten.  Avaunt, the very thought!  Pray--fast--banish it--my poor, poor brother!\" and she kissed his brow.  \"So, there fades the woman, and the mummy speaks again!\" said Harold, bitterly.  \"Be it so: I bow to my doom.  Well, there may be a time when Nature on the throne of England shall prevail over Priestcraft; and, in guerdon for all my services, I will then ask a King who hath blood in his veins to win me the Pope's pardon and benison.  Leave me that hope, my sister, and leave thy godchild on the shores of the living world.\"  The Queen made no answer, and Harold, auguring ill from her silence, moved on and opened the door of the oratory.  But the image that there met him, that figure still kneeling, those eyes, so earnest in the tears that streamed from them fast and unheeded, fixed on the holy rood--awed his step and checked his voice.  Nor till the girl had risen, did he break silence; then he said, gently, \"My sister will press thee no more, Edith----\"  \"I say not that!\" exclaimed the Queen.  \"Or if she doth, remember thy plighted promise under the wide cope of blue heaven, the old nor least holy temple of our common Father.\"  With these words he left the room.     CHAPTER VII.   Harold passed into the Queen's ante-chamber.  Here the attendance was small and select compared with the crowds which we shall see presently in the ante-room to the King's closet; for here came chiefly the more learned ecclesiastics, attracted instinctively by the Queen's own mental culture, and few indeed were they at that day (perhaps the most illiterate known in England since the death of Alfred [117]); and here came not the tribe of impostors, and the relic-venders, whom the infantine simplicity and lavish waste of the Confessor attracted. Some four or five priests and monks, some lonely widow, some orphan child, humble worth, or protected sorrow, made the noiseless levee of the sweet, sad Queen.  The groups turned, with patient eyes, towards the Earl as he emerged from that chamber, which it was rare indeed to quit unconsoled, and marvelled at the flush in his cheek; and the disquiet on his brow; but Harold was dear to the clients of his sister; for, despite his supposed indifference to the mere priestly virtues (if virtues we call them) of the decrepit time, his intellect was respected by yon learned ecclesiastics; and his character, as the foe of all injustice, and the fosterer of all that were desolate, was known to yon pale-eyed widow and yon trembling orphan.  In the atmosphere of that quiet assembly, the Earl seemed to recover his kindly temperament, and he paused to address a friendly or a soothing word to each; so that when he vanished, the hearts there felt more light; and the silence hushed before his entrance, was broken by many whispers in praise of the good Earl.  Descending a staircase without the walls--as even in royal halls the principal staircases were then--Harold gained a wide court, in which loitered several house-carles [118] and attendants, whether of the King or the visitors; and, reaching the entrance of the palace, took his way towards the King's rooms, which lay near, and round, what is now called \"The Painted Chamber,\" then used as a bedroom by Edward on state occasions.  And now he entered the ante-chamber of his royal brother-in-law. Crowded it was, but rather seemed it the hall of a convent than the ante-room of a king.  Monks, pilgrims, priests, met his eye in every nook; and not there did the Earl pause to practise the arts of popular favour.  Passing erect through the midst, he beckoned forth the officer, in attendance at the extreme end, who, after an interchange of whispers, ushered him into the royal presence.  The monks and the priests, gazing towards the door which had closed on his stately form, said to each other:  \"The King's Norman favourites at least honoured the Church.\"  \"That is true,\" said an abbot; \"and an it were not for two things, I should love the Norman better than the Saxon.\"  \"What are they, my father?\" asked an aspiring young monk.  \"Inprinis,\" quoth the abbot, proud of the one Latin word he thought he knew, but, that, as we see, was an error; \"they cannot speak so as to be understood, and I fear me much they incline to mere carnal learning.\"  Here there was a sanctified groan:  \"Count William himself spoke to me in Latin!\" continued the abbot, raising his eyebrows.  \"Did he?--Wonderful!\" exclaimed several voices.  \"And what did you answer, holy father?\"  \"Marry,\" said the abbot solemnly, \"I replied, Inprinis.\"  \"Good!\" said the young monk, with a look of profound admiration.  \"Whereat the good Count looked puzzled--as"]]]
