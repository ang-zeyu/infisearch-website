At first he could see little, because the hole had unfortunately been made a little too high, so that the eye of the detective could only see the Prodigal Son in a shiny frame on the opposite wall. But Oswald held on to the window-frame and stood on tiptoe and then he _saw_.  There was no furnace, and no base metal, no bearded men in leathern aprons with tongs and things, but just a table with a table-cloth on it for supper, and a tin of salmon and a lettuce and some bottled beer. And there on a chair was the cloak and the hat of the mysterious stranger, and the two people sitting at the table were the two youngest grown-up daughters of the lady next door, and one of them was saying--  ‘So I got the salmon three-halfpence cheaper, and the lettuces are only six a penny in the Broadway, just fancy! We must save as much as ever we can on our housekeeping money if we want to go away decent next year.’  And the other said, ‘I wish we could _all_ go _every_ year, or else--Really, I almost wish--’  And all the time Oswald was looking Dicky was pulling at his jacket to make him get down and let Dicky have a squint. And just as she said ‘I almost,’ Dicky pulled too hard and Oswald felt himself toppling on the giddy verge of the big flower-pots. Putting forth all his strength our hero strove to recover his equi-what’s-its-name, but it was now lost beyond recall.  ‘You’ve done it this time!’ he said, then he fell heavily among the flower-pots piled below. He heard them crash and rattle and crack, and then his head struck against an iron pillar used for holding up the next-door veranda. His eyes closed and he knew no more.  Now you will perhaps expect that at this moment Alice would have cried ‘Murder!’ If you think so you little know what girls are. Directly she was left alone in that tree she made a bolt to tell Albert’s uncle all about it and bring him to our rescue in case the coiner’s gang was a very desperate one. And just when I fell, Albert’s uncle was getting over the wall. Alice never screamed at all when Oswald fell, but Dicky thinks he heard Albert’s uncle say, ‘Confound those kids!’ which would not have been kind or polite, so I hope he did not say it.  The people next door did not come out to see what the row was. Albert’s uncle did not wait for them to come out. He picked up Oswald and carried the insensible body of the gallant young detective to the wall, laid it on the top, and then climbed over and bore his lifeless burden into our house and put it on the sofa in Father’s study. Father was out, so we needn’t have _crept_ so when we were getting into the garden. Then Oswald was restored to consciousness, and his head tied up, and sent to bed, and next day there was a lump on his young brow as big as a turkey’s egg, and very uncomfortable.  Albert’s uncle came in next day and talked to each of us separately. To Oswald he said many unpleasant things about ungentlemanly to spy on ladies, and about minding your own business; and when I began to tell him what I had heard he told me to shut up, and altogether he made me more uncomfortable than the bump did.  Oswald did not say anything to any one, but next day, as the shadows of eve were falling, he crept away, and wrote on a piece of paper, ‘I want to speak to you,’ and shoved it through the hole like a heart in the top of the next-door shutters. And the youngest young lady put an eye to the heart-shaped hole, and then opened the shutter and said ‘Well?’ very crossly. Then Oswald said--  ‘I am very sorry, and I beg your pardon. We wanted to be detectives, and we thought a gang of coiners infested your house, so we looked through your window last night. I saw the lettuce, and I heard what you said about the salmon being three-halfpence cheaper, and I know it is very dishonourable to pry into other people’s secrets, especially ladies’, and I never will again if you will forgive me this once.’  Then the lady frowned and then she laughed, and then she said--  ‘So it was you tumbling into the flower-pots last night? We thought it was burglars. It frightened us horribly. Why, what a bump on your poor head!’  And then she talked to me a bit, and presently she said she and her sister had not wished people to know they were at home, because--And then she stopped short and grew very red, and I said, ‘I thought you were all at Scarborough; your servant told Eliza so. Why didn’t you want people to know you were at home?’  The lady got redder still, and then she laughed and said--  ‘Never mind the reason why. I hope your head doesn’t hurt much. Thank you for your nice, manly little speech. _You’ve_ nothing to be ashamed of, at any rate.’ Then she kissed me, and I did not mind. And then she said, ‘Run away now, dear. I’m going to--I’m going to pull up the blinds and open the shutters, and I want to do it at _once_, before it gets dark, so that every one can see we’re at home, and not at Scarborough.’    CHAPTER 4. GOOD HUNTING  When we had got that four shillings by digging for treasure we ought, by rights, to have tried Dicky’s idea of answering the advertisement about ladies and gentlemen and spare time and two pounds a week, but there were several things we rather wanted.  Dora wanted a new pair of scissors, and she said she was going to get them with her eight-pence. But Alice said--  ‘You ought to get her those, Oswald, because you know you broke the points off hers getting the marble out of the brass thimble.’  It was quite true, though I had almost forgotten it, but then it was H. O. who jammed the marble into the thimble first of all. So I said--  ‘It’s H. O.’s fault as much as mine, anyhow. Why shouldn’t he pay?’  Oswald didn’t so much mind paying for the beastly scissors, but he hates injustice of every kind.  ‘He’s such a little kid,’ said Dicky, and of course H. O. said he wasn’t a little kid, and it very nearly came to being a row between them. But Oswald knows when to be generous; so he said--  ‘Look here! I’ll pay sixpence of the scissors, and H. O. shall pay the rest, to teach him to be careful.’  H. O. agreed: he is not at all a mean kid, but I found out afterwards that Alice paid his share out of her own money.  Then we wanted some new paints, and Noel wanted a pencil and a halfpenny account-book to write poetry with, and it does seem hard never to have any apples. So, somehow or other nearly all the money got spent, and we agreed that we must let the advertisement run loose a little longer.  ‘I only hope,’ Alice said, ‘that they won’t have got all the ladies and gentlemen they want before we have got the money to write for the sample and instructions.’  And I was a little afraid myself, because it seemed such a splendid chance; but we looked in the paper every day, and the advertisement was always there, so we thought it was all right.  Then we had the detective try-on--and it proved no go; and then, when all the money was gone, except a halfpenny of mine and twopence of Noel’s and three-pence of Dicky’s and a few pennies that the girls had left, we held another council.  Dora was sewing the buttons on H. O.’s Sunday things. He got himself a knife with his money, and he cut every single one of his best buttons off. You’ve no idea how many buttons there are on a suit. Dora counted them. There are twenty-four, counting the little ones on the sleeves that don’t undo.  Alice was trying to teach Pincher to beg; but he has too much sense when he knows you’ve got nothing in your hands, and the rest of us were roasting potatoes under the fire. We had made a fire on purpose, though it was rather warm. They are very good if you cut away the burnt parts--but you ought to wash them first, or you are a dirty boy.  ‘Well, what can we do?’ said Dicky. ‘You are so fond of saying “Let’s do something!” and never saying what.’  ‘We can’t try the advertisement yet. Shall we try rescuing some one?’ said Oswald. It was his own idea, but he didn’t insist on doing it, though he is next to the eldest, for he knows it is bad manners to make people do what you want, when they would rather not.  ‘What was Noel’s plan?’ Alice asked.  ‘A Princess or a poetry book,’ said Noel sleepily. He was lying on his back on the sofa, kicking his legs. ‘Only I shall look for the Princess all by myself. But I’ll let you see her when we’re married.’  ‘Have you got enough poetry to make a book?’ Dicky asked that, and it was rather sensible of him, because when Noel came to look there were only seven of his poems that any of us could understand. There was the ‘Wreck of the Malabar’, and the poem he wrote when Eliza took us to hear the Reviving Preacher, and everybody cried, and Father said it must have been the Preacher’s Eloquence. So Noel wrote:      O Eloquence and what art thou?     Ay what art thou? because we cried     And everybody cried inside     When they came out their eyes were red--     And it was your doing Father said.  But Noel told Alice he got the first line and a half from a book a boy at school was going to write when he had time. Besides this there were the ‘Lines on a Dead Black Beetle that was poisoned’--      O Beetle how I weep to see        Thee lying on thy poor back!     It is so very sad indeed.        You were so shiny and black.     I wish you were alive again     But Eliza says wishing it is nonsense and a shame.  It was very good beetle poison, and there were hundreds of them lying dead--but Noel only wrote a piece of poetry for one of them. He said he hadn’t time to do them all, and the worst of it was he didn’t know which one he’d written it to--so Alice couldn’t bury the beetle and put the lines on its grave, though she wanted to very much.  Well, it was quite plain that there wasn’t enough poetry for a book.  ‘We might wait a year or two,’ said Noel. ‘I shall be sure to make some more some time. I thought of a piece about a fly this morning that knew condensed milk was sticky.’  ‘But we want the money _now_,’ said Dicky, ‘and you can go on"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/770"],["title","The Story of the Treasure Seekers (#5)"],["body","just the same. It will come in some time or other.’  ‘There’s poetry in newspapers,’ said Alice. ‘Down, Pincher! you’ll never be a clever dog, so it’s no good trying.’  ‘Do they pay for it?’ Dicky thought of that; he often thinks of things that are really important, even if they are a little dull.  ‘I don’t know. But I shouldn’t think any one would let them print their poetry without. I wouldn’t I know.’ That was Dora; but Noel said he wouldn’t mind if he didn’t get paid, so long as he saw his poetry printed and his name at the end.  ‘We might try, anyway,’ said Oswald. He is always willing to give other people’s ideas a fair trial.  So we copied out ‘The Wreck of the Malabar’ and the other six poems on drawing-paper--Dora did it, she writes best--and Oswald drew a picture of the Malabar going down with all hands. It was a full-rigged schooner, and all the ropes and sails were correct; because my cousin is in the Navy, and he showed me.  We thought a long time whether we’d write a letter and send it by post with the poetry--and Dora thought it would be best. But Noel said he couldn’t bear not to know at once if the paper would print the poetry, So we decided to take it.  I went with Noel, because I am the eldest, and he is not old enough to go to London by himself. Dicky said poetry was rot--and he was glad he hadn’t got to make a fool of himself. That was because there was not enough money for him to go with us. H. O. couldn’t come either, but he came to the station to see us off, and waved his cap and called out ‘Good hunting!’ as the train started.  There was a lady in spectacles in the corner. She was writing with a pencil on the edges of long strips of paper that had print all down them. When the train started she asked--  ‘What was that he said?’  So Oswald answered--  ‘It was “Good hunting”--it’s out of the Jungle Book!’ ‘That’s very pleasant to hear,’ the lady said; ‘I am very pleased to meet people who know their Jungle Book. And where are you off to--the Zoological Gardens to look for Bagheera?’  We were pleased, too, to meet some one who knew the Jungle Book.  So Oswald said--  ‘We are going to restore the fallen fortunes of the House of Bastable--and we have all thought of different ways--and we’re going to try them all. Noel’s way is poetry. I suppose great poets get paid?’  The lady laughed--she was awfully jolly--and said she was a sort of poet, too, and the long strips of paper were the proofs of her new book of stories. Because before a book is made into a real book with pages and a cover, they sometimes print it all on strips of paper, and the writer make marks on it with a pencil to show the printers what idiots they are not to understand what a writer means to have printed.  We told her all about digging for treasure, and what we meant to do. Then she asked to see Noel’s poetry--and he said he didn’t like--so she said, ‘Look here--if you’ll show me yours I’ll show you some of mine.’ So he agreed.  The jolly lady read Noel’s poetry, and she said she liked it very much. And she thought a great deal of the picture of the Malabar. And then she said, ‘I write serious poetry like yours myself; too, but I have a piece here that I think you will like because it’s about a boy.’ She gave it to us--and so I can copy it down, and I will, for it shows that some grown-up ladies are not so silly as others. I like it better than Noel’s poetry, though I told him I did not, because he looked as if he was going to cry. This was very wrong, for you should always speak the truth, however unhappy it makes people. And I generally do. But I did not want him crying in the railway carriage. The lady’s piece of poetry:      Oh when I wake up in my bed     And see the sun all fat and red,     I’m glad to have another day     For all my different kinds of play.      There are so many things to do--     The things that make a man of you,     If grown-ups did not get so vexed     And wonder what you will do next.      I often wonder whether they     Ever made up our kinds of play--     If they were always good as gold     And only did what they were told.      They like you best to play with tops     And toys in boxes, bought in shops;     They do not even know the names     Of really interesting games.      They will not let you play with fire     Or trip your sister up with wire,     They grudge the tea-tray for a drum,     Or booby-traps when callers come.      They don’t like fishing, and it’s true     You sometimes soak a suit or two:     They look on fireworks, though they’re dry,     With quite a disapproving eye.      They do not understand the way     To get the most out of your day:     They do not know how hunger feels     Nor what you need between your meals.      And when you’re sent to bed at night,     They’re happy, but they’re not polite.     For through the door you hear them say:     ‘_He’s_ done _his_ mischief for the day!’  She told us a lot of other pieces but I cannot remember them, and she talked to us all the way up, and when we got nearly to Cannon Street she said--  ‘I’ve got two new shillings here! Do you think they would help to smooth the path to Fame?’  Noel said, ‘Thank you,’ and was going to take the shilling. But Oswald, who always remembers what he is told, said--  ‘Thank you very much, but Father told us we ought never to take anything from strangers.’  ‘That’s a nasty one,’ said the lady--she didn’t talk a bit like a real lady, but more like a jolly sort of grown-up boy in a dress and hat--‘a very nasty one! But don’t you think as Noel and I are both poets I might be considered a sort of relation? You’ve heard of brother poets, haven’t you? Don’t you think Noel and I are aunt and nephew poets, or some relationship of that kind?’  I didn’t know what to say, and she went on--  ‘It’s awfully straight of you to stick to what your Father tells you, but look here, you take the shillings, and here’s my card. When you get home tell your Father all about it, and if he says No, you can just bring the shillings back to me.’  So we took the shillings, and she shook hands with us and said, ‘Good-bye, and good hunting!’  We did tell Father about it, and he said it was all right, and when he looked at the card he told us we were highly honoured, for the lady wrote better poetry than any other lady alive now. We had never heard of her, and she seemed much too jolly for a poet. Good old Kipling! We owe him those two shillings, as well as the Jungle books!    CHAPTER 5. THE POET AND THE EDITOR  It was not bad sport--being in London entirely on our own hook. We asked the way to Fleet Street, where Father says all the newspaper offices are. They said straight on down Ludgate Hill--but it turned out to be quite another way. At least _we_ didn’t go straight on.  We got to St Paul’s. Noel _would_ go in, and we saw where Gordon was buried--at least the monument. It is very flat, considering what a man he was.  When we came out we walked a long way, and when we asked a policeman he said we’d better go back through Smithfield. So we did. They don’t burn people any more there now, so it was rather dull, besides being a long way, and Noel got very tired. He’s a peaky little chap; it comes of being a poet, I think. We had a bun or two at different shops--out of the shillings--and it was quite late in the afternoon when we got to Fleet Street. The gas was lighted and the electric lights. There is a jolly Bovril sign that comes off and on in different coloured lamps. We went to the Daily Recorder office, and asked to see the Editor. It is a big office, very bright, with brass and mahogany and electric lights.  They told us the Editor wasn’t there, but at another office. So we went down a dirty street, to a very dull-looking place. There was a man there inside, in a glass case, as if he was a museum, and he told us to write down our names and our business. So Oswald wrote--             OSWALD BASTABLE             NOEL BASTABLE       BUSINESS VERY PRIVATE INDEED  Then we waited on the stone stairs; it was very draughty. And the man in the glass case looked at us as if we were the museum instead of him. We waited a long time, and then a boy came down and said--  ‘The Editor can’t see you. Will you please write your business?’ And he laughed. I wanted to punch his head.  But Noel said, ‘Yes, I’ll write it if you’ll give me a pen and ink, and a sheet of paper and an envelope.’  The boy said he’d better write by post. But Noel is a bit pig-headed; it’s his worst fault. So he said--‘No, I’ll write it _now_.’ So I backed him up by saying--  ‘Look at the price penny stamps are since the coal strike!’  So the boy grinned, and the man in the glass case gave us pen and paper, and Noel wrote. Oswald writes better than he does; but Noel would do it; and it took a very long time, and then it was inky.      DEAR MR EDITOR, I want you to print my poetry and pay for it,     and I am a friend of Mrs Leslie’s; she is a poet too.      Your affectionate friend,      NOEL BASTABLE.  He licked the envelope a good deal, so that that boy shouldn’t read it going upstairs; and he wrote ‘Very private’ outside, and gave the letter to the boy. I thought it wasn’t any good; but in a minute the grinning boy came back, and he was quite respectful, and said--‘The Editor says, please will you step up?’  We stepped up. There were a lot of stairs and passages, and a queer sort of humming, hammering sound and a very funny smell. The boy was now very polite, and said it was the ink we smelt, and the noise was the printing machines.  After going through a lot of cold passages we came to a door; the boy opened it, and let us go in. There was a large room, with a big, soft, blue-and-red carpet, and a roaring fire, though it was only October; and a large table with drawers, and littered with papers, just like the one in Father’s study. A gentleman was sitting at one side of the table; he had a light moustache and light eyes, and he looked very young "]]]
