But when thou wert absent from the land, justice seemed to abandon it to force and the battle-axe.\"  \"I would thank you for your trust,\" answered Harold, deeply moved. \"But justice in England rests not on the presence and life of a single man.  And your speech I must not accept as a grace, for it wrongs both my King and his Council.  These charges ye have made, but ye have not proved them.  Armed men are not proofs; and granting that hot blood and mortal infirmity of judgment have caused Tostig to err against you and the right, think still of his qualities to reign over men whose lands, and whose rivers, lie ever exposed to the dread Northern sea- kings.  Where will ye find a chief with arm as strong, and heart as dauntless?  By his mother's side he is allied to your own lineage. And for the rest, if ye receive him back to his earldom, not only do I, Harold in whom you profess to trust, pledge full oblivion of the past, but I will undertake, in his name, that he shall rule you well for the future, according to the laws of King Canute.\"  \"That will we not hear,\" cried the thegns, with one voice; while the tones of Gamel Beorn, rough with the rattling Danish burr, rose above all, \"for we were born free.  A proud and bad chief is by us not to be endured; we have learned from our ancestors to live free or die!\"  A murmur, not of condemnation, at these words, was heard amongst the Saxon chiefs round Harold: and beloved and revered as he was, he felt that, had he the heart, he had scarce the power, to have coerced those warriors to march at once on their countrymen in such a cause.  But foreseeing great evil in the surrender of his brother's interests, whether by lowering the King's dignity to the demands of armed force, or sending abroad in all his fierce passions a man so highly connected with Norman and Dane, so vindictive and so grasping, as Tostig, the Earl shunned further parley at that time and place.  He appointed a meeting in the town with the chiefs; and requested them, meanwhile, to reconsider their demands, and at least shape them so as that they could be transmitted to the King, who was then on his way to Oxford.  It is in vain to describe the rage of Tostig, when his brother gravely repeated to him the accusations against him, and asked for his justification.  Justification he could give not.  His idea of law was but force, and by force alone he demanded now to be defended.  Harold, then, wishing not alone to be judge in his brother's cause, referred further discussion to the chiefs of the various towns and shires, whose troops had swelled the War-Fyrd; and to them he bade Tostig plead his cause.  Vain as a woman, while fierce as a tiger, Tostig assented, and in that assembly he rose, his gonna all blazing with crimson and gold, his hair all curled and perfumed as for a banquet; and such, in a half- barbarous day, the effect of person, especially when backed by warlike renown, that the Proceres were half disposed to forget, in admiration of the earl's surpassing beauty of form, the dark tales of his hideous guilt.  But his passions hurrying him away ere he had gained the middle of his discourse, so did his own relation condemn himself, so clear became his own tyrannous misdeeds, that the Englishmen murmured aloud their disgust, and their impatience would not suffer him to close.  \"Enough,\" cried Vebba, the blunt thegn from Saxon Kent; \"it is plain that neither King nor Witan can replace thee in thine earldom.  Tell us not farther of these atrocities; or by're Lady, if the Northumbrians had chased thee not, we would.\"  \"Take treasure and ship, and go to Baldwin in Flanders,\" said Thorold, a great Anglo-Dane from Lincolnshire, \"for even Harold's name can scarce save thee from outlawry.\"  Tostig glared round on the assembly, and met but one common expression in the face of all.  \"These are thy henchmen, Harold!\" he said through his gnashing teeth, without vouchsafing farther word, strode from the council-hall.  That evening he left the town and hurried to tell to Edward the tale that had so miscarried with the chiefs.  The next day, the Northumbrian delegates were heard; and they made the customary proposition in those cases of civil differences, to refer all matters to the King and the Witan; each party remaining under arms meanwhile.  This was finally acceded to.  Harold repaired to Oxford, where the King (persuaded to the journey by Alred, foreseeing what would come to pass) had just arrived.     CHAPTER VI.   The Witan was summoned in haste.  Thither came the young earls Morcar and Edwin, but Caradoc, chafing at the thought of peace, retired into Wales with his wild band.  Now, all the great chiefs, spiritual and temporal, assembled in Oxford for the decree of that Witan on which depended the peace of England. The imminence of the time made the concourse of members entitled to vote in the assembly even larger than that which had met for the inlawry of Godwin.  There was but one thought uppermost in the minds of men, to which the adjustment of an earldom, however mighty, was comparatively insignificant--viz., the succession of the kingdom. That thought turned instinctively and irresistibly to Harold.  The evident and rapid decay of the King; the utter failure of all male heir in the House of Cerdic, save only the boy Edgar; whose character (which throughout life remained puerile and frivolous) made the minority which excluded him from the throne seem cause rather for rejoicing than grief: and whose rights, even by birth, were not acknowledged by the general tenor of the Saxon laws, which did not recognize as heir to the crown the son of a father who had not himself been crowned [214];--forebodings of coming evil and danger, originating in Edward's perturbed visions; revivals of obscure and till then forgotten prophecies, ancient as the days of Merlin; rumours, industriously fomented into certainty by Haco, whose whole soul seemed devoted to Harold's cause, of the intended claim of the Norman Count to the throne;--all concurred to make the election of a man matured in camp and council, doubly necessary to the safety of the realm.  Warm favourers, naturally, of Harold, were the genuine Saxon population, and a large part of the Anglo-Danish--all the thegns in his vast earldom of Wessex, reaching to the southern and western coasts, from Sandwich and the mouth of the Thames to the Land's End in Cornwall; and including the free men of Kent, whose inhabitants even from the days of Caesar had been considered in advance of the rest of the British population, and from the days of Hengist had exercised an influence that nothing save the warlike might of the Anglo-Danes counterbalanced.  With Harold, too, were many of the thegns from his earlier earldom of East Anglia, comprising the county of Essex, great part of Hertfordshire, and so reaching into Cambridge, Huntingdon, Norfolk, and Ely.  With him, were all the wealth, intelligence, and power of London, and most of the trading towns; with him all the veterans of the armies he had led; with him too, generally throughout the empire, was the force, less distinctly demarked, of public and national feeling.  Even the priests, save those immediately about the court, forgot, in the exigency of the time, their ancient and deep-rooted dislike to Godwin's House; they remembered, at least, that Harold had never, in foray or feud, plundered a single convent; or in peace, and through plot, appropriated to himself a single hide of Church land; and that was more than could have been said of any other earl of the age--even of Leofric the Holy.  They caught, as a Church must do, when so intimately, even in its illiterate errors, allied with the people as the old Saxon Church was, the popular enthusiasm.  Abbot combined with thegn in zeal for Earl Harold.  The only party that stood aloof was the one that espoused the claims of the young sons of Algar.  But this party was indeed most formidable; it united all.  the old friends of the virtuous Leofric, of the famous Siward; it had a numerous party even in East Anglia (in which earldom Algar had succeeded Harold); it comprised nearly all the thegns in Mercia (the heart of the country) and the population of Northumbria; and it involved in its wide range the terrible Welch on the one hand, and the Scottish domain of the sub-king Malcolm, himself a Cumbrian, on the other, despite Malcolm's personal predilections for Tostig, to whom he was strongly attached.  But then the chiefs of this party, while at present they stood aloof, were all, with the exception perhaps of the young earls themselves, disposed, on the slightest encouragement, to blend their suffrage with the friends of Harold; and his praise was as loud on their lips as on those of the Saxons from Kent, or the burghers from London.  All factions, in short, were willing, in this momentous crisis, to lay aside old dissensions; it depended upon the conciliation of the Northumbrians, upon a fusion between the friends of Harold and the supporters of the young sons of Algar, to form such a concurrence of interests as must inevitably bear Harold to the throne of the empire.  Meanwhile, the Earl himself wisely and patriotically deemed it right to remain neuter in the approaching decision between Tostig and the young earls.  He could not be so unjust and so mad as to urge to the utmost (and risk in the urging) his party influence on the side of oppression and injustice, solely for the sake of his brother; nor, on the other, was it decorous or natural to take part himself against Tostig; nor could he, as a statesman, contemplate without anxiety and alarm the transfer of so large a portion of the realm to the vice- kingship of the sons of his old foe--rivals to his power, at the very time when, even for the sake of England alone, that power should be the most solid and compact.  But the final greatness of a fortunate man is"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7681"],["title","Harold : the Last of the Saxon Kings — Volume 10 (#7)"],["body","made by any violent effort of his own.  He has sown the seeds in the time foregone, and the ripe time brings up the harvest.  His fate seems taken out of his own control: greatness seems thrust upon him.  He has made himself, as it were, a want to the nation, a thing necessary to it; he has identified himself with his age, and in the wreath or the crown on his brow, the age itself seems to put forth its flower.  Tostig, lodging apart from Harold in a fort near the gate of Oxford, took slight pains to conciliate foes or make friends; trusting rather to his representations to Edward, (who was wroth with the rebellious House of Algar,) of the danger of compromising the royal dignity by concessions to armed insurgents.  It was but three days before that for which the Witan was summoned; most of its members had already assembled in the city; and Harold, from the window of the monastery in which he lodged, was gazing thoughtfully into the streets below, where, with the gay dresses of the thegns and cnehts, blended the grave robes of ecclesiastic and youthful scholar;--for to that illustrious university (pillaged the persecuted by the sons of Canute), Edward had, to his honour, restored the schools,--when Haco entered, and announced to him that a numerous body of thegns and prelates, headed by Alred, Archbishop of York, craved an audience.  \"Knowest thou the cause, Haco?\"  The youth's cheek was yet more pale than usual, as he answered slowly:  \"Hilda's prophecies are ripening into truths.\"  The Earl started, and his old ambition reviving, flushed on his brow, and sparkled from his eye--he checked the joyous emotion, and bade Haco briefly admit the visitors.  They came in, two by two,--a body so numerous that they filled the ample chamber; and Harold, as he greeted each, beheld the most powerful lords of the land--the highest dignitaries of the Church-- and, oft and frequent, came old foe by the side or trusty friend. They all paused at the foot of the narrow dais on which Harold stood, and Alred repelled by a gesture his invitation to the foremost to mount the platform.  Then Alred began an harangue, simple and earnest.  He described briefly the condition of the country; touched with grief and with feeling on the health of the King, and the failure of Cerdic's line. He stated honestly his own strong wish, if possible, to have concentrated the popular suffrages on the young Atheling; and under the emergence of the case, to have waived the objection to his immature years.  But as distinctly and emphatically he stated, that that hope and intent he had now formally abandoned, and that there was but one sentiment on the subject with all the chiefs and dignitaries of the realm.  \"Wherefore,\" continued he, \"after anxious consultations with each other, those whom you see around have come to you: yea, to you, Earl Harold, we offer our hands and hearts to do our best to prepare for you the throne on the demise of Edward, and to seat you thereon as firmly as ever sate King of England and son of Cerdic;--knowing that in you, and in you alone, we find the man who reigns already in the English heart; to whose strong arm we can trust the defence of our land; to whose just thoughts, our laws.--As I speak, so think we all!\"  With downcast eyes, Harold heard; and but by a slight heaving of his breast under his crimson robe, could his emotion be seen.  But as soon as the approving murmur that succeeded the prelate's speech, had closed, he lifted his head, and answered:  \"Holy father, and you, Right Worthy my fellow-thegns, if ye could read my heart at this moment, believe that you would not find there the vain joy of aspiring man, when the greatest of earthly prizes is placed within his reach.  There, you would see, with deep and wordless gratitude for your trust and your love, grave and solemn solicitude, earnest desire to divest my decision of all mean thought of self, and judge only whether indeed, as king or as subject, I can best guard the weal of England.  Pardon me, then, if I answer you not as ambition alone would answer; neither deem me insensible to the glorious lot of presiding, under heaven, and by the light of our laws, over the destinies of the English realm,--if I pause to weigh well the responsibilities incurred, and the obstacles to be surmounted.  There is that on my mind that I would fain unbosom, not of a nature to discuss in an assembly so numerous, but which I would rather submit to a chosen few whom you yourselves may select to hear me, in whose cool wisdom, apart from personal love to me, ye may best confide;--your most veteran thegns, your most honoured prelates: To them will I speak, to them make clean my bosom; and to their answer, their counsels, will I in all things defer: whether with loyal heart to serve another, whom, hearing me, they may decide to choose; or to fit my soul to bear, not unworthily, the weight of a kingly crown.\"  Alred lifted his mild eyes to Harold, and there were both pity and approval in his gaze, for he divined the Earl.  \"Thou hast chosen the right course, my son; and we will retire at once, and elect those with whom thou mayest freely confer, and by whose judgment thou mayest righteously abide.\"  The prelate turned, and with him went the conclave.  Left alone with Haco, the last said, abruptly:  \"Thou wilt not be so indiscreet, O Harold, as to confess thy compelled oath to the fraudful Norman?\"  \"That is my design,\" replied Harold, coldly.  The son of Sweyn began to remonstrate, but the Earl cut him short.  \"If the Norman say that he has been deceived in Harold, never so shall say the men of England.  Leave me.  I know not why, Haco, but in thy presence, at times, there is a glamour as strong as in the spells of Hilda.  Go, dear boy; the fault is not in thee, but in the superstitious infirmities of a man who hath once lowered, or, it may be, too highly strained, his reason to the things of a haggard fancy. Go! and send to me my brother Gurth.  I would have him alone of my House present at this solemn crisis of its fate.\"  Haco bowed his head, and went.  In a few moments more, Gurth came in.  To this pure and spotless spirit Harold had already related the events of his unhappy visit to the Norman; and he felt, as the young chief pressed his hand, and looked on him with his clear and loving eyes, as if Honour made palpable stood by his side.  Six of the ecclesiastics, most eminent for Church learning,--small as was that which they could boast, compared with the scholars of Normandy and the Papal States, but at least more intelligent and more free from mere formal monasticism than most of their Saxon contemporaries,--and six of the chiefs most renowned for experience in war or council, selected under the sagacious promptings of Alred, accompanied that prelate to the presence of the Earl.  \"Close, thou! close! close! Gurth,\" whispered Harold \"for this is a confession against man's pride, and sorely doth it shame;--so that I would have thy bold sinless heart beating near to mine.\"  Then, leaning his arm upon his brother's shoulder, and in a voice, the first tones of which, as betraying earnest emotion, irresistibly chained and affected his noble audience, Harold began his tale.  Various were the emotions, though all more akin to terror than repugnance, with which the listeners heard the Earl's plain and candid recital.  Among the lay-chiefs the impression made by the compelled oath was comparatively slight: for it was the worst vice of the Saxon laws, to entangle all charges, from the smallest to the greatest, in a reckless multiplicity of oaths [215], to the grievous loosening of the bonds of truth: and oaths then had become almost as much mere matter of legal form, as certain oaths--bad relic of those times!--still existing in our parliamentary and collegiate proceedings, are deemed by men, not otherwise dishonourable, even now.  And to no kind of oath was more latitude given than to such as related to fealty to a chief: for these, in the constant rebellions which happened year after year, were openly violated, and without reproach.  Not a sub-king in Wales who harried the border, not an earl who raised banner against the Basileus of Britain, but infringed his oath to be good man and true to the lord paramount; and even William the Norman himself never found his oath of fealty stand in the way, whenever he deemed it right and expedient to take arms against his suzerain of France.  On the churchmen the impression was stronger and more serious: not that made by the oath itself, but by the relics on which the hand had been laid.  They looked at each other, doubtful and appalled, when the Earl ceased his tale; while only among the laymen circled a murmur of mingled wrath at William's bold design on their native land, and of scorn at the thought that an oath, surprised and compelled, should be made the instrument of treason to a whole people.  \"Thus,\" said Harold, after a pause, \"thus have I made clear to you my conscience, and revealed to you the only obstacle between your offers and my choice.  From the keeping of an oath so extorted, and so deadly to England, this venerable prelate and mine own soul have freed me. Whether as king or as subject, I shall alike revere the living and their long posterity more than the dead men's bones, and, with sword and with battle-axe, hew out against the invader my best atonement for the lip's weakness and the heart's desertion.  But whether, knowing what hath passed, ye may not deem it safer for the land to elect another king,--this it is which, free and fore-thoughtful of every chance, ye should now decide.\"  With these words he stepped from the dais, and retired into the oratory that adjoined the chamber, followed by Gurth.  The eyes of the priests then turned to Alred, and to them the prelate spoke as he had done before to Harold;--he distinguished between the oath and its fulfilment--between the lesser sin and the greater--the one which the"]]]
