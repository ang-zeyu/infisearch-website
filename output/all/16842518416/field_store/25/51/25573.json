Well, what then?\"  \"In my self-conceit I supposed that you might have heard how much I admired Mademoiselle Cicogna--how, having not long since met her at the house of Duplessis (who by the way writes me word that I shall meet you _chez lui_ tomorrow), I have since sought her society wherever there was a chance to find it.  You may have heard, at our club, or elsewhere, how I adore her genius--how, I say, that nothing so _Breton_--that is, so pure and so lofty--has appeared and won readers since the days of Chateaubriand,--and--you, knowing that _les absents ont toujours tort_, come to me and ask Monsieur de Rochebriant, Are we rivals?  I expected a challenge--you relieve my mind--you abandon the field to me?\"  At the first I warned the reader how improved from his old _mauvaise honte_ a year or so of Paris life would make our beau Marquis.  How a year or two of London life with its horsey slang and its fast girls of the period would have vulgarised an English Rochebriant!  Graham gnawed his lips and replied quietly, \"I do not challenge!  Am I to congratulate you?\"  \"No, that brilliant victory is not for me.  I thought that was made clear in the conversation I have referred to.  But if you have done me the honour to be jealous I am exceedingly flattered.  Speaking, seriously, if I admired Mademoiselle Cicogna when you and I last met, the admiration is increased by the respect with which I regard a character so simply noble. How many women older than she would have been spoiled by the adulation that has followed her literary success!--how few women so young, placed in a position so critical, having the courage to lead a life so independent, would have maintained the dignity of their character free from a single indiscretion!  I speak not from my own knowledge, but from the report of all, who would be pleased enough to censure if they could find a cause.  Good society is the paradise of _mauvaises langues_.\"  Graham caught Alain's hand and pressed it, but made no answer.  The young Marquis continued:  \"You will pardon me for speaking thus freely in the way that I would wish any friend to speak of the demoiselle who might become my wife.  I owe you much, not only for the loyalty with which you address me in reference to this young lady, but for words affecting my own position in France, which sank deep into my mind--saved me from deeming myself a _proscrit_ in my own land--filled me with a manly ambition, not stifled amidst the thick of many effeminate follies--and, in fact, led me to the career which is about to open before me, and in which my ancestors have left me no undistinguished examples.  Let us speak, then, _a coeur ouvert_, as one friend to another.  Has there been any misunderstanding between you and Mademoiselle Cicogna which has delayed your return to Paris?  If so, is it over now?\"  \"There has been no such misunderstanding.\"  \"Do you doubt whether the sentiments you expressed in regard to her when we met last year, are returned?\"  \"I have no right to conjecture her sentiments.  You mistake altogether.\"  \"I do not believe that I am dunce enough to mistake your feelings towards Mademoiselle--they may be read in your face at this moment.  Of course I do not presume to hazard a conjecture as to those of Mademoiselle towards yourself.  But when I met her not long since at the house of Duplessis, with whose daughter she is intimate, I chanced to speak to her of you; and if I may judge, by looks and manner, I chose no displeasing theme. You turn away--I offend you?\"  \"Offend!--no, indeed; but on this subject I am not prepared to converse. I came to Paris on matters of business much complicated and which ought to absorb my attention.  I cannot longer trespass on your evening.  The day after to-morrow, then, I will be with you at one o'clock.\"  \"Yes, I hope then to have the letters you wish to consult; and, meanwhile, we meet to-morrow at the Hotel Duplessis.\"     CHAPTER VI.  Graham had scarcely quitted Alain, and the young Marquis was about to saunter forth to his club, when Duplessis was announced.  These two men had naturally seen much of each other since Duplessis had returned from Bretagne and delivered Alain from the gripe of Louvier. Scarcely a day had passed but what Alain had been summoned to enter into the financier's plans for the aggrandisement of the Rochebriant estates, and delicately made to feel that he had become a partner in speculations, which, thanks to the capital and the abilities Duplessis brought to bear, seemed likely to result in the ultimate freedom of his property from all burdens, and the restoration of his inheritance to a splendour correspondent with the dignity of his rank.  On the plea that his mornings were chiefly devoted to professional business, Duplessis arranged that these consultations should take place in the evenings.  From those consultations Valerie was not banished; Duplessis took her into the council as a matter of course.  \"Valerie,\" said the financier to Alain, \"though so young, has a very clear head for business, and she is so interested in all that interests myself, that even where I do not take her opinion, I at least feel my own made livelier and brighter by her sympathy.\"  So the girl was in the habit of taking her work or her book into the _cabinet de travail_, and never obtruding a suggestion unasked, still, when appealed to, speaking with a modest good sense which justified her father's confidence and praise; and _a propos_ of her book, she had taken Chateaubriand into peculiar favour.  Alain had respectfully presented to her beautifully bound copies of Atala and Ls Genie du Christianisme; it is astonishing, indeed, how he had already contrived to regulate her tastes in literature.  The charms of those quiet family evenings had stolen into the young Breton's heart.  He yearned for none of the gayer reunions in which he had before sought for a pleasure that his nature had not found; for, amidst the amusements of Paris, Alain remained intensely Breton--viz., formed eminently for the simple joys of domestic life, associating the sacred hearthstone with the antique religion of his fathers; gathering round it all the images of pure and noble affections which the romance of a poetic temperament had evoked from the solitude which had surrounded a melancholy boyhood-an uncontaminated youth.  Duplessis entered abruptly, and with a countenance much disturbed from its wonted saturnine composure.  \"Marquis, what is this I have just heard from the Duchesse de Tarascon? Can it be?  You ask military service in this ill-omened war?--you?\"  \"My dear and best friend,\" said Alain, very much startled, \"I should have thought that you, of all men in the world, would have most approved of my request--you, so devoted an Imperialist--you, indignant that the representative of one of these families, which the First Napoleon so eagerly and so vainly courted, should ask for the grade of sous- lieutenant in the armies of Napoleon the Third--you, who of all men know how ruined are the fortunes of a Rochebriant--you, feel surprised that he clings to the noblest heritage his ancestors have left to him--their sword!  I do not understand you.\"  \"Marquis,\" said Duplessis, seating himself, and regarding Alain with a look in which were blended the sort of admiration and the sort of contempt with which a practical man of the world, who, having himself gone through certain credulous follies, has learned to despise the follies, but retains a reminiscence of sympathy with the fools they bewitch, \"Marquis, pardon me; you talk finely, but you do not talk common sense.  I should be extremely pleased if your Legitimist scruples had allowed you to solicit, or rather to accept, a civil appointment not unsuited to your rank, under the ablest sovereign, as a civilian, to whom France can look for rational liberty combined with established order. Such openings to a suitable career you have rejected; but who on earth could expect you, never trained to military service, to draw a sword hitherto sacred to the Bourbons, on behalf of a cause which the madness, I do not say of France but of Paris, has enforced on a sovereign against whom you would fight to-morrow if you had a chance of placing the descendant of Henry IV. on his throne.\"  \"I am not about to fight for any sovereign, but for my country against the foreigner.\"  \"An excellent answer if the foreigner had invaded your country; but it seems that your country is going to invade the foreigner--a very different thing.  _Chut_! all this discussion is most painful to me.  I feel for the Emperor a personal loyalty, and for the hazards he is about to encounter a prophetic dread, as an ancestor of yours might have felt for Francis I. could he have foreseen Pavia.  Let us talk of ourselves and the effect the war should have upon our individual action.  You are aware, of course, that, though M. Louvier has had notice of our intention to pay off his mortgage, that intention cannot be carried into effect for six months; if the money be not then forthcoming his hold on Rochebriant remains unshaken--the sum is large.\"  \"Alas! yes.\"  \"The war must greatly disturb the money-market, affect many speculative adventures and operations when at the very moment credit may be most needed.  It is absolutely necessary that I should be daily at my post on the Bourse, and hourly watch the ebb and flow of events.  Under these circumstances I had counted, permit me to count still, on your presence in Bretagne.  We have already begun negotiations on a somewhat extensive scale, whether as regards the improvement of forests and orchards, or the plans for building allotments, as soon as the lands are free for disposal--for all these the eye of a master is required.  I entreat you, then, to take up your residence at Rochebriant.\"  \"My dear friend, this is but a kindly and delicate mode of relieving me from the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7746"],["title","The Parisians — Volume 10 (#6)"],["body","of war.  I have, as you must be conscious, no practical knowledge of business.  Hebert can be implicitly trusted, and will carry out your views with a zeal equal to mine, and with infinitely more ability.\"  \"Marquis, pray neither to Hercules nor to Hebert; if you wish to get your own cart out of the ruts, put your own shoulder to the wheel.\"  Alain coloured high, unaccustomed to be so bluntly addressed, but he replied with a kind of dignified meekness: \"I shall ever remain grateful for what you have done, and wish to do for me.  But, assuming that you suppose rightly, the estates of Rochebriant would, in your hands, become a profitable investment, and more than redeem the mortgage, and the sum you have paid Louvier on my account, let it pass to you irrespectively of me.  I shall console myself in the knowledge that the old place will be restored, and those who honoured its old owners prosper in hands so strong, guided by a heart so generous.\"  Duplessis was deeply affected by these simple words; they seized him on the tenderest side of his character--for his heart was generous, and no one, except his lost wife and his loving child, had ever before discovered it to be so.  Has it ever happened to you, reader, to be appreciated on the one point of the good or the great that is in you--on which secretly you value yourself most--but for which nobody, not admitted into your heart of hearts, has given you credit?  If that has happened to you, judge what Duplessis felt when the fittest representative of that divine chivalry which, if sometimes deficient in head, owes all that exalts it to riches of heart, spoke thus to the professional moneymaker, whose qualities of head were so acknowledged that a compliment to them would be a hollow impertinence, and whose qualities of heart had never yet received a compliment!  Duplessis started from his seat and embraced Alain, murmuring, \"Listen to me, I love you--I never had a son--be mine--Rochebriant shall be my daughter's dot.\"  Alain returned the embrace, and then recoiling, said: \"Father, your first desire must be honour for your son.  You have guessed my secret--I have learned to love Valerie.  Seeing her out in the world, she seemed like other girls, fair and commonplace--seeing her--at your house, I have said to myself, 'There is the one girl fairer than all others in my eyes, and the one individual to whom all other girls are commonplace.'\"  \"Is that true?--is it?\"  \"True! does a _gentilhomme_ ever lie?  And out of that love for her has grown this immovable desire to be something worthy of her--something that may lift me from the vulgar platform of men who owe all to ancestors, nothing to themselves.  Do you suppose for one moment that I, saved from ruin and penury by Valerie's father, could be base enough to say to her, 'In return be Madame la Marquise de Rochebriant'?  Do you suppose that I, whom you would love and respect as son, could come to you and say: 'I am oppressed by your favours--I am crippled with debts--give me your millions and we are quits.'  No, Duplessis!  You, so well descended yourself--so superior as man amongst men that you would have won name and position had you been born the son of a shoeblack,--you would eternally despise the noble who, in days when all that we Bretons deem holy in noblesse are subjected to ridicule and contempt, should so vilely forget the only motto which the scutcheons of all _gentilhommes_ have in common, 'Noblesse oblige.'  War, with all its perils and all its grandeur,--war lifts on high the banners of France,--war, in which every ancestor of mine whom I care to recall aggrandised the name that descends to me.  Let me then do as those before me have done; let me prove that I am worth something in myself, and then you and I are equals; and I can say with no humbled crest, 'Your benefits are accepted:' the man who has fought not ignobly for France may aspire to the hand of her daughter.  Give me Valerie; as to her dot,--be it so, Rochebriant,--it will pass to her children.\"  \"Alain!  Alain! my friend! my son!--but if you fall.\"  \"Valerie will give you a nobler son.\"  Duplessis moved away, sighing heavily; but he said no more in deprecation of Alain's martial resolves.  A Frenchman, however practical, however worldly, however philosophical he may be, who does not sympathise with the follies of honour--who does not concede indulgence to the hot blood of youth when he says, \"My country is insulted and her banner is unfurled,\" may certainly be a man of excellent common sense; but if such men had been in the majority, Gaul would never have been France--Gaul would have been a province of Germany.  And as Duplessis walked homeward--he the calmest and most far-seeing of all authorities on the Bourse--the man who, excepting only De Mauleon, most decidedly deemed the cause of the war a blunder, and most forebodingly anticipated its issues, caught the prevalent enthusiasm. Everywhere he was stopped by cordial hands, everywhere met by congratulating smiles.  \"How right you have been, Duplessis, when you have laughed at those who have said, 'The Emperor is ill, decrepit, done up.'\"  \"Vive l'Empereur! at least we shall be face to face with those insolent Prussians!\"  Before he arrived at his home, passing along the Boulevards, greeted by all the groups enjoying the cool night air before the cafes, Duplessis had caught the war epidemic.  Entering his hotel, he went at once to Valerie's chamber.  \"Sleep well to-night, child; Alain has told me that he adores thee, and if he will go to the war, it is that he may lay his laurels at thy feet.  Bless thee, my child, thou couldst not have made a nobler choice.\"  Whether, after these words, Valerie slept well or not 'tis not for me to say; but if she did sleep, I venture to guess that her dreams were rose- coloured.     CHAPTER VII.  All the earlier part of that next day, Graham Vane remained in-doors--a lovely day at Paris that 8th of July, and with that summer day all hearts at Paris were in unison.  Discontent was charmed into enthusiasm-- Belleville and Montmartre forgot the visions of Communism and Socialism and other \"isms\" not to be realised except in some undiscovered Atlantis!  The Emperor was the idol of the day--the names of Jules Favre and Gambetta were by-words of scorn.  Even Armand Monnier, still out of work, beginning to feel the pinch of want, and fierce for any revolution that might turn topsy-turvy the conditions of labour,--even Armand Monnier was found among groups that were laying immortelles at the foot of the column in the Place Vendome, and heard to say to a fellow malcontent, with eyes uplifted to the statue of the First Napoleon, \"Do you not feel at this moment that no Frenchman can be long angry with the Little Corporal?  He denied La Liberte, but he gave La Gloire.\"  Heeding not the stir of the world without, Graham was compelling into one resolve the doubts and scruples which had so long warred against the heart which they ravaged, but could not wholly subdue.  The conversations with Mrs. Morley and Rochebriant had placed in a light in which he had not before regarded it, the image of Isaura.  He had reasoned from the starting-point of his love for her, and had sought to convince himself that against that love it was his duty to strive.  But now a new question was addressed to his conscience as well as to his heart.  What though he had never formally declared to her his affection-- never, in open words, wooed her as his own--never even hinted to her the hopes of a union which at one time he had fondly entertained,--still was it true that his love had been too transparent not to be detected by her, and not to have led her on to return it?  Certainly he had, as we know, divined that he was not indifferent to her: at Enghien, a year ago, that he had gained her esteem, and perhaps interested her fancy.  We know also how he had tried to persuade himself that the artistic temperament, especially when developed in women, is too elastic to suffer the things of real life to have lasting influence over happiness or sorrow,--that in the pursuits in which her thought and imagination found employ, in the excitement they sustained, and the fame to which they conduced, Isaura would be readily consoled for a momentary pang of disappointed affection.  And that a man so alien as himself, both by nature and by habit, from the artistic world, was the very last person who could maintain deep and permanent impression on her actual life or her ideal dreams.  But what if, as he gathered from the words of the fair American--what if, in all these assumptions, she was wholly mistaken? What if, in previously revealing his own heart, he had decoyed hers--what if, by a desertion she had no right to anticipate, he had blighted her future?  What if this brilliant child of genius could love as warmly, as deeply, as enduringly as any simple village girl to whom there is no poetry except love?  If this were so--what became the first claim on his honour, his conscience, his duty?  The force which but a few days ago his reasonings had given to the arguments that forbade him to think of Isaura, became weaker and weaker, as now in an altered mood of reflection he resummoned and reweighed them.  All those prejudices--which had seemed to him such rational common-sense truths, when translated from his own mind into the words of Lady Janet's letter,--was not Mrs. Morley right in denouncing them as the crotchets of an insolent egotism?  Was it not rather to the favour than to the disparagement of Isaura, regarded even in the man's narrow-minded view of woman's dignity, that this orphan girl could, with character so unscathed, pass through the trying ordeal of the public babble, the public gaze-command alike the esteem of a woman so pure as Mrs. Morley, the reverence of a man so chivalrously sensitive to honour as Alain de Rochebriant?  Musing thus, Graham's countenance at last brightened--a glorious"]]]
