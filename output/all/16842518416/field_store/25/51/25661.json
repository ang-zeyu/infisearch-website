Not only did it continue to live upon its vast store of spiritual energy, but day by day it increased the store. In the second \"lackland\" half, it is the instructive history of a scattered people, organically one, in spite of dispersion, by reason of its unshaken ideal traditions; a people accepting misery and hardship with stoic calm, combining the characteristics of the thinker with those of the sufferer, and eking out existence under conditions which no other nation has found adequate, or, indeed, can ever find adequate. The account of the people as teacher of religion--this is the content of the first half of Jewish history; the account of the people as thinker, stoic, and sufferer--this is the content of the second half of Jewish history.  A summing up of all that has been said in this and the previous chapter proves true the statement with which we began, that Jewish history, in respect to its quantitative dimensions as well as its qualitative structure, is to the last degree distinctive and presents a phenomenon of undeniable uniqueness.     III  THE SIGNIFICANCE OF JEWISH HISTORY   We turn now to the question of the significance to be attached to Jewish history. In view of its peculiar qualities, what has it to offer to the present generation and to future generations as a subject of study and research?  The significance of Jewish history is twofold. It is at once national and universal. At present the fulcrum of Jewish national being lies in the historical consciousness. In the days of antiquity, the Jews were welded into a single united nation by the triple agencies of state, race, and religion, the complete array of material and spiritual forces directed to one point. Later, in the period of homelessness and dispersion, it was chiefly religious consciousness that cemented Jewry into a whole, and replaced the severed political bond as well as the dulled racial instinct, which is bound to go on losing in keenness in proportion to the degree of removal from primitive conditions and native soil. In our days, when the liberal movements leavening the whole of mankind, if they have not completely shattered the religious consciousness, have at least, in an important section of Jewry, effected a change in its form; when abrupt differences of opinion with regard to questions of faith and cult are asserting their presence; and traditional Judaism developed in historical sequence is proving powerless to hold together the diverse factors of the national organism,--in these days the keystone of national unity seems to be the historical consciousness. Composed alike of physical, intellectual, and moral elements, of habits and views, of emotions and impressions nursed into being and perfection by the hereditary instinct active for thousands of years, this historical consciousness is a remarkably puzzling and complex psychic phenomenon. By our common memory of a great, stirring past and heroic deeds on the battle-fields of the spirit, by the exalted historical mission allotted to us, by our thorn-strewn pilgrim's path, our martyrdom assumed for the sake of our principles, by such moral ties, we Jews, whether consciously or unconsciously, are bound fast to one another. As Renan well says: \"Common sorrow unites men more closely than common joy.\" A long chain of historical traditions is cast about us all like a strong ring. Our wonderful, unparalleled past attracts us with magnetic power. In the course of centuries, as generation followed generation, similarity of historical fortunes produced a mass of similar impressions which have crystallized, and have thrown off the deposit that may be called \"the Jewish national soul.\" This is the soil in which, deep down, lies imbedded, as an unconscious element, the Jewish national _feeling_, and as a conscious element, the Jewish national _idea_.  It follows that the Jewish national idea and the national feeling connected with it have their origin primarily in the historical consciousness, in a certain complex of ideas and psychic predispositions. These ideas and predispositions, the deposit left by the aggregate of historical impressions, are of necessity the common property of the whole nation, and they can be developed and quickened to a considerable degree by a renewal of the impressions through the study of history. Upon the knowledge of history, then, depends the strength of the national consciousness.[5]    [5] A different aspect of the same thought is presented with     logical clearness in another publication by our author. \"The     national _idea_, and the national _feeling_,\" says     Mr. Dubnow, \"must be kept strictly apart. Unfortunately the     difference between them is usually obliterated. National     feeling is spontaneous. To a greater or less degree it is     inborn in all the members of the nation as a feeling of     kinship. It has its flood-tide and its ebbtide in     correspondence to external conditions, either forcing the     nation to defend its nationality, or relieving it of the     necessity for self-defense. As this feeling is not merely a     blind impulse, but a complicated psychic phenomenon, it can be     subjected to a psychologic analysis. From the given historical     facts or the ideas that have become the common treasure of a     nation, thinking men, living life consciously, can, in one way     or another, derive the origin, development, and vital force of     its national feeling. The results of such an analysis,     arranged in some sort of system, form the content of the     national idea. The task of the national idea it is to clarify     the national feeling, and give it logical sanction for the     benefit of those who cannot rest satisfied with an unconscious     feeling.     \"In what, to be specific, does the essence of our Jewish national     idea consist? Or, putting the question in another form, what     is the cement that unites us into a single compact organism?     Territory and government, the external ties usually binding a     nation together, we have long ago lost. Their place is filled     by abstract principles, by religion and race. Undeniably these     are factors of first importance, and yet we ask the question,     do they alone and exclusively maintain the national cohesion     of Jewry? No, we reply, for if we admitted this proposition,     we should by consequence have to accept the inference, that     the laxity of religious principle prevailing among     free-thinking Jews, and the obliteration of race peculiarities     in the 'civilized' strata of our people, bring in their train     a corresponding weakening, or, indeed, a complete breaking up,     of our national foundations--which in point of fact is not the     case. On the contrary, it is noticeable that the     latitudinarians, the _libres penseurs_, and the     indifferent on the subject of religion, stand in the forefront     of all our national movements. Seeing that to belong to it is     in most cases heroism, and in many martyrdom, what is it that     attracts these Jews so forcibly to their people? There must be     something common to us all, so comprehensive that in the face     of multifarious views and degrees of culture it acts as a     consolidating force. This 'something,' I am convinced, is the     community of historical fortunes of all the scattered parts of     the Jewish nation. We are welded together by our glorious     past. We are encircled by a mighty chain of similar historical     impressions suffered by our ancestors, century after century     pressing in upon the Jewish soul, and leaving behind a     substantial deposit. In short, the Jewish national idea is     based chiefly upon the historical consciousness.\" [Note of the     German trl.]  But over and above its national significance, Jewish history, we repeat, possesses universal significance. Let us, in the first place, examine its value for science and philosophy. Inasmuch as it is pre-eminently a chronicle of ideas and spiritual movements, Jewish history affords the philosopher or psychologist material for observation of the most important and useful kind. The study of other, mostly dull chapters of universal history has led to the fixing of psychologic or sociologic theses, to the working out of comprehensive philosophic systems, to the determination of general laws. Surely it follows without far-fetched proof, that in some respects the chapter dealing with Jewish history must supply material of the most original character for such theses and philosophies. If it is true, as the last chapter set out to demonstrate, that Jewish history is distinguished by sharply marked and peculiar features, and refuses to accommodate itself to conventional forms, then its content must have an original contribution to make to philosophy. It does not admit of a doubt that the study of Jewish history would yield new propositions appertaining to the philosophy of history and the psychology of nations, hitherto overlooked by inquirers occupied with the other divisions of universal history. Inductive logic lays down a rule for ascertaining the law of a phenomenon produced by two or more contributory causes. By means of what might be called a laboratory experiment, the several causes must be disengaged from one another, and the effect of each observed by itself. Thus it becomes possible to arrive with mathematical precision at the share of each cause in the result achieved by several co-operating causes. This method of difference, as it is called, is available, however, only for a limited number of phenomena, only for phenomena in the department of the natural sciences. It is in the nature of the case that mental and spiritual phenomena, though they may be observed, cannot be artificially reproduced. Now, in one respect, Jewish history"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7836"],["title","Jewish History : An Essay in the Philosophy of History (#4)"],["body","the advantages of an arranged experiment. The historical life of ordinary nations, such nations as are endowed with territory and are organized into a state, is a complete intermingling of the political with the spiritual element. Totally ignorant as we are of the development either would have assumed, had it been dissevered from the other, the laws governing each of the elements singly can be discovered only approximately. Jewish history, in which the two elements have for many centuries been completely disentangled from each other, presents a natural experiment, with the advantage of artificial exclusions, rendering possible the determination of the laws of spiritual phenomena with far greater scientific exactitude than the laws of phenomena that result from several similar causes.  Besides this high value for the purposes of science, this fruitful suggestiveness for philosophic thought, Jewish history, as compared with the history of other nations, enjoys another distinction in its capacity to exercise an ennobling influence upon the heart. Nothing so exalts and refines human nature as the contemplation of moral steadfastness, the history of the trials of a martyr who has fought and suffered for his convictions. At bottom, the second half of Jewish history is nothing but this. The effective educational worth of the Biblical part of Jewish history is disputed by none. It is called \"sacred\" history, and he who acquires a knowledge of it is thought to advance the salvation of his soul. Only a very few, however, recognize the profound, moral content of the second half of Jewish history, the history of the diaspora. Yet, by reason of its exceptional qualities and intensely tragic circumstances, it is beyond all others calculated to yield edification to a notable degree. The Jewish people is deserving of attention not only in the time when it displayed its power and enjoyed its independence, but as well in the period of its weakness and oppression, during which it was compelled to purchase spiritual development by constant sacrifice of self. A thinker crowned with thorns demands no less veneration than a thinker with the laurel wreath upon his brow. The flame issuing from the funeral pile on which martyrs die an heroic death for their ideas is, in its way, as awe-inspiring as the flame from Sinai's height. With equal force, though by different methods, both touch the heart, and arouse the moral sentiment. Biblical Israel the celebrated--medieval Judah the despised--it is one and the same people, judged variously in the various phases of its historical life. If Israel bestowed upon mankind a religious theory of life, Judah gave it a thrilling example of tenacious vitality and power of resistance for the sake of conviction. This uninterrupted life of the spirit, this untiring aspiration for the higher and the better in the domain of religious thought, philosophy, and science, this moral intrepidity in night and storm and in despite of all the blows of fortune--is it not an imposing, soul-stirring spectacle? The inexpressible tragedy of the Jewish historical life is unfailing in its effect upon a susceptible heart.[6] The wonderful exhibition of spirit triumphant, subduing the pangs of the flesh, must move every heart, and exercise uplifting influence upon the non-Jew no less than upon the Jew.    [6] \"If there are ranks in suffering, Israel takes precedence of     all the nations--if the duration of sorrows and the patience     with which they are borne ennoble, the Jews are among the     aristocracy of every land--if a literature is called rich in     the possession of a few classic tragedies, what shall we say     to a National Tragedy lasting for fifteen hundred years, in     which the poets and the actors were also the heroes?\" (Zunz,     _Die synagogale Poesie_. Translation by George Eliot in     \"Daniel Deronda.\")  For non-Jews a knowledge of Jewish history may, under certain conditions, come to have another, an humanitarian significance. It is inconceivable that the Jewish people should be held in execration by those acquainted with the course of its history, with its tragic and heroic past.[7] Indeed, so far as Jew-haters by profession are concerned, it is running a risk to recommend the study of Jewish history to them, without adding a word of caution. Its effect upon them might be disastrous. They might find themselves cured of their modern disease, and in the possession of ideas that would render worthless their whole stock in trade. Verily, he must have fallen to the zero-point of anti-Semitic callousness who is not thrilled through and through by the lofty fortitude, the saint-like humility, the trustful resignation to the will of God, the stoic firmness, laid bare by the study of Jewish history. The tribute of respect cannot be readily withheld from him to whom the words of the poet[8] are applicable:   \"To die was not his hope; he fain   Would live to think and suffer pain.\"    [7] As examples and a proof of the strong humanitarian influence     Jewish history exercises upon Christians, I would point to the     relation established between the Jews and two celebrities of     the nineteenth century, Schleiden and George Eliot. In his old     age, the great scientist and thinker accidentally, in the     course of his study of sources for the history of botany,     became acquainted with medieval Jewish history. It filled him     with ardent enthusiasm for the Jews, for their intellectual     strength, their patience under martyrdom. Dominated by this     feeling, he wrote the two admirable sketches: _Die Bedeutung     der Juden für Erhaltung und Wiederbelebung der Wissenschaften     im Mittelalter_ (1876) and _Die Romantik des Martyriums     bei den Juden im Mittelalter_ (1878). According to his own     confession, the impulse to write them was \"the wish to take at     least the first step toward making partial amends for the     unspeakable wrong inflicted by Christians upon Jews.\" As for     George Eliot, it may not be generally known that it was her     reading of histories of the Jews that inspired her with the     profound veneration for the Jewish people to which she gave     glowing utterance in \"Daniel Deronda.\" (She cites Zunz, was     personally acquainted with Emanuel Deutsch, and carried on a     correspondence with Professor Dr. David Kaufmann. See     _George Eliot's Life as related in her Letters and     Journals_. Arranged and edited by her husband, J. W. Cross,     Vol. iii, ed. Harper and Brothers.) Her enthusiasm prompted     her, in 1879, to indite her passionate apology for the Jews,     under the title, \"The Modern Hep! Hep! Hep!\"    [8] Pushkin.  When, in days to come, the curtain rises upon the touching tragedy of Jewish history, revealing it to the astonished eye of a modern generation, then, perhaps, hearts will be attuned to tenderness, and on the ruins of national hostility will be enthroned mutual love, growing out of mutual understanding and mutual esteem. And who can tell--perhaps Jewish history will have a not inconsiderable share in the spiritual change that is to annihilate national intolerance, the modern substitute for the religious bigotry of the middle ages. In this case, the future task of Jewish history will prove as sublime as was the mission of the Jewish people in the past. The latter consisted in the spread of the dogma of the unity of creation; the former will contribute indirectly to the realization of the not yet accepted dogma of the unity of the human race.     IV  THE HISTORICAL SYNTHESIS   To define the scope of Jewish history, its content and its significance, or its place among scientific pursuits, disposes only of the formal part of the task we have set ourselves. The central problem is to unfold the meaning of Jewish history, to discover the principle toward which its diversified phenomena converge, to state the universal laws and philosophic inferences deducible from the peculiar course of its events. If we liken history to an organic being, then the skeleton of facts is its body, and the soul is the spiritual bond that unites the facts into a whole, that conveys the meaning, the psychologic essence, of the facts. It becomes our duty, then, to unbare the soul of Jewish history, or, in scientific parlance, to construct, on the basis of the facts, the synthesis of the whole of Jewish national life. To this end, we must pass in review, by periods and epochs, one after another, the most important groups of historical events, the most noteworthy currents in life and thought that tell of the stages in the development of Jewry and of Judaism. Exhaustive treatment of the philosophical synthesis of a history extending over three thousand years is possible only in a voluminous work. In an essay like the present it can merely be sketched in large outline, or painted in miniature. We cannot expect to do more than state a series of general principles substantiated by the most fundamental arguments. Complete demonstration of each of the principles must be sought in the annals that recount the events of Jewish history in detail.  The historical synthesis reduces itself, then, to uncovering the psychologic processes of national development. The object before us to be studied is the national spirit undergoing continuous evolution during thousands of years. Our task is to arrive at the laws underlying this growth. We shall reach our goal by imitating the procedure of the geologist, who divides the mass of the earth into its several strata or formations. In Jewish history there may be distinguished three chief stratifications answering to its first three periods, the Biblical period, the period of the Second Temple, and the Talmudic period. The later periods are nothing more than these same formations combined in various ways, with now and then the addition of new strata. Of the composite periods there are four, which arrange themselves either according to"]]]
