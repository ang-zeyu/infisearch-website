In the intervals of silence from the clamour, her voice, though low, clear, well-tuned, and impressive, forcibly arrested the attention of young Nevile; for at that day, even more than this (sufficiently apparent as it now is), there was a marked distinction in the intonation, the accent, the modulation of voice, between the better bred and better educated and the inferior classes. But this difference, so ill according with her dress and position, only served to heighten more the bold insolence of the musical Bacchantes, who, indeed, in the eyes of the sober, formed the most immoral nuisance attendant on the sports of the time, and whose hardy license and peculiar sisterhood might tempt the antiquary to search for their origin amongst the relics of ancient Paganism. And now, to increase the girl’s distress, some half-score of dissolute apprentices and journeymen suddenly broke into the ring of the Maenads, and were accosting her with yet more alarming insults, when Marmaduke, pushing them aside, strode to her assistance. “How now, ye lewd varlets! ye make me blush for my countrymen in the face of day! Are these the sports of merry England,--these your manly contests,--to strive which can best affront a poor maid? Out on ye, cullions and bezonians! Cling to me, gentle donzel, and fear not. Whither shall I lead thee?” The apprentices were not, however, so easily daunted. Two of them approached to the rescue, flourishing their bludgeons about their heads with formidable gestures. “Ho, ho!” cried one, “what right hast thou to step between the hunters and the doe? The young quean is too much honoured by a kiss from a bold ‘prentice of London.”  Marmaduke stepped back, and drew the small dagger which then formed the only habitual weapon of a gentleman. [Swords were not worn, in peace, at that period.] This movement, discomposing his mantle, brought the silver arrow he had won (which was placed in his girdle) in full view of the assailants. At the same time they caught sight of the badge on his hat. These intimidated their ardour more than the drawn poniard.  “A Nevile!” said one, retreating. “And the jolly marksman who beat Nick Alwyn,” said the other, lowering his bludgeon, and doffing his cap. “Gentle sir, forgive us, we knew not your quality. But as for the girl--your gallantry misleads you.”  “The Wizard’s daughter! ha, ha! the Imp of Darkness!” screeched the timbrel-girls, tossing up their instruments, and catching them again on the points of their fingers. “She has enchanted him with her glamour. Foul is fair! Foul fair thee, young springal, if thou go to the nets. Shadow and goblin to goblin and shadow! Flesh and blood to blood and flesh!”--and dancing round him, with wanton looks and bare arms, and gossamer robes that brushed him as they circled, they chanted,--      “Come, kiss me, my darling,        Warm kisses I trade for;      Wine, music, and kisses        What else was life made for?”  With some difficulty, and with a disgust which was not altogether without a superstitious fear of the strange words and the outlandish appearance of these loathsome Delilahs, Marmaduke broke from the ring with his new charge; and in a few moments the Nevile and the maiden found themselves, unmolested and unpursued, in a deserted quarter of the ground; but still the scream of the timbrel-girls, as they hurried, wheeling and dancing, into the distance, was borne ominously to the young man’s ear. “Ha, ha! the witch and her lover! Foul is fair! foul is fair! Shadow to goblin, goblin to shadow,--and the devil will have his own!”  “And what mischance, my poor girl,” asked the Nevile, soothingly, “brought thee into such evil company?”  “I know not, fair sir,” said the girl, slowly recovering her self; “but my father is poor, and I had heard that on these holiday occasions one who had some slight skill on the gittern might win a few groats from the courtesy of the bystanders. So I stole out with my serving-woman, and had already got more than I dared hope, when those wicked timbrel-players came round me, and accused me of taking the money from them. And then they called an officer of the ground, who asked me my name and holding; so when I answered, they called my father a wizard, and the man broke my poor gittern,--see!”--and she held it up, with innocent sorrow in her eyes, yet a half-smile on her lips,--“and they soon drove poor old Madge from my side, and I knew no more till you, worshipful sir, took pity on me.”  “But why,” asked the Nevile, “did they give to your father so unholy a name?”  “Alas, sir! he is a great scholar, who has spent his means in studying what he says will one day be of good to the people.”  “Humph!” said Marmaduke, who had all the superstitions of his time, who looked upon a scholar, unless in the Church, with mingled awe and abhorrence, and who, therefore, was but ill-satisfied with the girl’s artless answer,  “Humph! your father--but--” checking what he was about, perhaps harshly, to say, as he caught the bright eyes and arch, intelligent face lifted to his own--“but it is hard to punish the child for the father’s errors.”  “Errors, sir!” repeated the damsel, proudly, and with a slight disdain in her face and voice. “But yes, wisdom is ever, perhaps, the saddest error!”  This remark was of an order superior in intellect to those which had preceded it: it contrasted with the sternness of experience the simplicity of the child; and of such contrasts, indeed, was that character made up. For with a sweet, an infantine change of tone and countenance, she added, after a short pause, “They took the money! The gittern--see, they left that, when they had made it useless.”  “I cannot mend the gittern, but I can refill the gipsire,” said Marmaduke.  The girl coloured deeply. “Nay, sir, to earn is not to beg.” Marmaduke did not heed this answer; for as they were now passing by the stunted trees, under which sat several revellers, who looked up at him from their cups and tankards, some with sneering, some with grave looks, he began, more seriously than in his kindly impulse he had hitherto done, to consider the appearance it must have to be thus seen walking in public with a girl of inferior degree, and perhaps doubtful repute. Even in our own day such an exhibition would be, to say the least, suspicious; and in that day, when ranks and classes were divided with iron demarcations, a young gallant, whose dress bespoke him of gentle quality, with one of opposite sex, and belonging to the humbler orders, in broad day too, was far more open to censure. The blood mounted to his brow, and halting abruptly, he said, in a dry and altered voice: “My good damsel, you are now, I think, out of danger; it would ill beseem you, so young and so comely, to go farther with one not old enough to be your protector; so, in God’s name, depart quickly, and remember me when you buy your new gittern, poor child!” So saying, he attempted to place a piece of money in her hand. She put it back, and the coin fell on the ground. “Nay, this is foolish,” said he.  “Alas, sir!” said the girl, gravely, “I see well that you are ashamed of your goodness. But my father begs not. And once--but that matters not.”  “Once what?” persisted Marmaduke, interested in her manner, in spite of himself.  “Once,” said the girl, drawing herself up, and with an expression that altered the whole character of her face--“the beggar ate at my father’s gate. He is a born gentleman and a knight’s son.”  “And what reduced him thus?”  “I have said,” answered the girl, simply, yet with the same half-scorn on her lip that it had before betrayed; “he is a scholar, and thought more of others than himself.”  “I never saw any good come to a gentleman from those accursed books,”  said the Nevile,--“fit only for monks and shavelings. But still, for your father’s sake, though I am ashamed of the poorness of the gift--”  “No; God be with you, sir, and reward you.” She stopped short, drew her wimple round her face, and was gone. Nevile felt an uncomfortable sensation of remorse and disapproval at having suffered her to quit him while there was yet any chance of molestation or annoyance, and his eye followed her till a group of trees veiled her from his view.  The young maiden slackened her pace as she found herself alone under the leafless boughs of the dreary pollards,--a desolate spot, made melancholy by dull swamps, half overgrown with rank verdure, through which forced its clogged way the shallow brook that now gives its name (though its waves are seen no more) to one of the main streets in the most polished quarters of the metropolis. Upon a mound formed by the gnarled roots of the dwarfed and gnome-like oak, she sat down and wept. In our earlier years, most of us may remember that there was one day which made an epoch in life,--that day that separated Childhood from Youth; for that day seems not to come gradually, but to be a sudden crisis, an abrupt revelation. The buds of the heart open to close no more. Such a day was this in that girl’s fate. But the day was not yet gone! That morning, when she dressed for her enterprise of filial love, perhaps for the first time Sibyll Warner felt that she was fair--who shall say whether some innocent, natural vanity had not blended with the deep, devoted earnestness, which saw no shame in the act by which the child could aid the father? Perhaps she might have smiled to listen to old Madge’s praises of her winsome face, old Madge’s predictions that the face and the gittern would not lack admirers on the gay ground; perhaps some indistinct, vague forethoughts of the Future to which the sex will deem itself to be born might have caused the cheek--no, not to blush, but to take a rosier hue, and the pulse to beat quicker, she knew not why. At all events, to that ground went the young Sibyll, cheerful, and almost happy, in her inexperience of actual"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7737"],["title","The Parisians — Volume 01 (#0)"],["body","PARISIANS                           By Edward Bulwer-Lytton   PREFATORY NOTE.  (BY THE AUTHOR'S SON.)  \"The Parisians\" and \"Kenelm Chillingly\" were begun about the same time, and had their common origin in the same central idea.  That idea first found fantastic expression in \"The Coming Race;\" and the three books, taken together, constitute a special group, distinctly apart from all the other works of their author.  The satire of his earlier novels is a protest against false social respectabilities; the humour of his later ones is a protest against the disrespect of social realities.  By the first he sought to promote social sincerity and the free play of personal character; by the last, to encourage mutual charity and sympathy amongst all classes, on whose interrelation depends the character of society itself.  But in these three books, his latest fictions, the moral purpose is more definite and exclusive.  Each of them is an expostulation against what seemed to him the perilous popularity of certain social and political theories, or a warning against the influence of certain intellectual tendencies upon individual character and national life.  This purpose, however, though common to the three fictions, is worked out in each of them by a different method.  \"The Coming Race\" is a work of pure fancy, and the satire of it is vague and sportive.  The outlines of a definite purpose are more distinctly drawn in \"Chillingly,\"--a romance which has the source of its effect in a highly wrought imagination.  The humour and pathos of \"Chillingly\" are of a kind incompatible with the design of \"The Parisians,\" which is a work of dramatized observation.  \"Chillingly\" is a romance; \"The Parisians\" is a novel.  The subject of \"Chillingly\" is psychological; that of \"The  Parisians\"  is social.  The author's  object in  \"Chillingly\"  being to illustrate the effects of \"modern ideas\" upon an individual character, he has confined his narrative to the biography of that one character; hence the simplicity of plot and small number of dramatis personae, whereby the work gains in height and depth what it loses in breadth of surface.  \"The Parisians,\" on the contrary, is designed to illustrate the effect of \"modern ideas\" upon a whole community.  This novel is therefore panoramic in the profusion and variety of figures presented by it to the reader's imagination.  No exclusive prominence is vouchsafed to any of these figures.  All of them are drawn and coloured with an equal care, but by means of the bold, broad touches necessary for their effective presentation on a canvas so large and so crowded.  Such figures are, indeed, but the component features of one great form, and their actions only so many modes of one collective impersonal character,--that of the Parisian Society of Imperial and Democratic France; a character everywhere present and busy throughout the story, of which it is the real hero or heroine.  This society was doubtless selected for characteristic illustration as being the most advanced in the progress of \"modern ideas.\"  Thus, for a complete perception of its writer's fundamental purpose, \"The Parisians\" should be read in connection with \"Chillingly,\" and these two books in connection with \"The Coming Race.\"  It will then be perceived that through the medium of alternate fancy, sentiment, and observation, assisted by humour and passion, these three books (in all other respects so different from each other) complete the presentation of the same purpose under different aspects, and thereby constitute a group of fictions which claims a separate place of its own in any thoughtful classification of their author's works.  One last word to those who will miss from these pages the connecting and completing touches of the master's hand.  It may be hoped that such a disadvantage, though irreparable, is somewhat mitigated by the essential character of the work itself.  The aesthetic merit of this kind of novel is in the vivacity of a general effect produced by large, swift strokes of character; and in such strokes, if they be by a great artist, force and freedom of style must still be apparent, even when they are left rough and unfinished.  Nor can any lack of final verbal correction much diminish the intellectual value which many of the more thoughtful passages of the present work derive from a long, keen, and practical study of political phenomena, guided by personal experience of public life, and enlightened by a large, instinctive knowledge of the human heart.  Such a belief is, at least, encouraged by the private communications spontaneously made to him who expresses it, by persons of political experience and social position in France, who have acknowledged the general accuracy of the author's descriptions, and noticed the suggestive sagacity and penetration of his occasional comments on the circumstances and sentiments he describes.     INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER.  They who chance to have read the \"Coming Race\" may perhaps remember that I, the adventurous discoverer of the land without a sun, concluded the sketch of my adventures by a brief reference to the malady which, though giving no perceptible notice of its encroachments, might, in the opinion of my medical attendant, prove suddenly fatal.  I had brought my little book to this somewhat melancholy close a few years before the date of its publication, and in the meanwhile I was induced to transfer my residence to Paris, in order to place myself under the care of an English physician, renowned for his successful treatment of complaints analogous to my own.  I was the more readily persuaded to undertake this journey,--partly because I enjoyed a familiar acquaintance with the eminent physician referred to, who had commenced his career and founded his reputation in the United States; partly because I had become a solitary man, the ties of home broken, and dear friends of mine were domiciled in Paris, with whom I should be sure of tender sympathy and cheerful companionship.  I had reason to be thankful for this change of residence: the skill of Dr. C_____ soon restored me to health.  Brought much into contact with various circles of Parisian society, I became acquainted with the persons and a witness of the events that form the substance of the tale I am about to submit to the public, which has treated my former book with so generous an indulgence.  Sensitively tenacious of that character for strict and unalloyed veracity which, I flatter myself, my account of the abodes and manners of the Vril-ya has established, I could have wished to preserve the following narrative no less jealously guarded than its predecessor from the vagaries of fancy.  But Truth undisguised, never welcome in any civilized community above ground, is exposed at this time to especial dangers in Paris; and my life would not be worth an hour's purchase if I exhibited her 'in puris naturalibus' to the eyes of a people wholly unfamiliarized to a spectacle so indecorous.  That care for one's personal safety which is the first duty of thoughtful man compels me therefore to reconcile the appearance of 'la Verite' to the 'bienseances' of the polished society in which 'la Liberte' admits no opinion not dressed after the last fashion.  Attired as fiction, Truth may be peacefully received; and, despite the necessity thus imposed by prudence, I indulge the modest hope that I do not in these pages unfaithfully represent certain prominent types of the brilliant population which has invented so many varieties of Koom-Posh;       [Koom-Posh, Glek-Nas.  For the derivation of these terms and their      metaphorical signification, I must refer the reader to the \"Coming      Race,\" chapter xii., on the language of the Vril-ya.  To those who      have not read or have forgotten that historical composition, it may      be convenient to state briefly that Koom-Posh with the Vril-ya is      the name for the government of the many, or the ascendency of the      most ignorant or hollow, and may be loosely rendered Hollow-Bosh.      When Koom-Posh degenerates from popular ignorance into the popular      ferocity which precedes its decease, the name for that state of      things is Glek-Nas; namely, the universal strife-rot.]  and even when it appears hopelessly lost in the slough of a Glek-Nas, re-emerges fresh and lively as if from an invigorating plunge into the Fountain of Youth.  O Paris, 'foyer des idees, et oeil du monde!'-- animated contrast to the serene tranquillity of the Vril-ya, which, nevertheless, thy noisiest philosophers ever pretend to make the goal of their desires: of all communities on which shines the sun and descend the rains of heaven, fertilizing alike wisdom and folly, virtue and vice; in every city men have yet built on this earth,--mayest thou, O Paris, be the last to brave the wands of the Coming Race and be reduced into cinders for the sake of the common good!                                                        TISH.  PARIS, August 28, 1872.                                   THE PARISIANS.                           By Edward Bulwer-Lytton                                    BOOK I.   CHAPTER I.  It was a bright day in the early spring of 1869.  All Paris seemed to have turned out to enjoy itself.  The Tuileries, the Champs Elysees, the Bois de Boulogne, swarmed with idlers.  A stranger might have wondered where Toil was at work, and in what nook Poverty lurked concealed. A millionaire from the London Exchange, as he looked round on the magasins, the equipages, the dresses of the women; as he inquired the prices in the shops and the rent of apartments,--might have asked himself, in envious wonder, How on earth do those gay Parisians live? What is their fortune?  Where does it come from?  As the day declined, many of the scattered loungers crowded into the Boulevards; the cafes and restaurants began to light up.  About this time a young man, who might be some five or six and twenty, was walking"]]]
