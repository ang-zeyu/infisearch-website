But Woodville's account of the queen's grief and horror at the afflictions of her House, and of Jacquetta's indignation at the foul language which the report of her practices put into the popular mouth, served to endear to the king's mind the family that he considered unduly persecuted.  Even in the coldest breasts affection is fanned by opposition, and the more the queen's kindred were assailed, the more obstinately Edward clung to them.  By suiting his humour, by winking at his gallantries, by a submissive sweetness of temper, which soothed his own hasty moods, and contrasted with the rough pride of Warwick and the peevish fickleness of Clarence, Elizabeth had completely wound herself into the king's heart.  And the charming graces, the elegant accomplishments, of Anthony Woodville were too harmonious with the character of Edward, who in all--except truth and honour--was the perfect model of the gay gentilhomme of the time, not to have become almost a necessary companionship.  Indolent natures may be easily ruled, but they grow stubborn when their comforts and habits are interfered with.  And the whole current of Edward's merry, easy life seemed to him to lose flow and sparkle if the faces he loved best were banished, or even clouded.  He was yet conversing with Woodville, and yet assuring him that, however he might temporize, he would never abandon the interests of his queen's kindred, when a gentleman entered aghast, to report that the Lords St. John and de Fulke, on hearing that Sir Anthony Woodville was in command of the forces, had, without even dismounting, left the camp, and carried with them their retainers, amounting to more than half of the little troop that rode from Olney.  \"Let them go,\" said Edward, frowning; \"a day shall dawn upon their headless trunks!\"  \"Oh, my king,\" said Anthony, now Earl of Rivers,--who, by far the least selfish of his House, was struck with remorse at the penalty Edward paid for his love marriage,--\"now that your Highness can relieve me of my command, let me retire from the camp.  I would fain go a pilgrim to the shrine of Compostella to pray for my father's sins and my sovereign's weal.\"  \"Let us first see what forces arrive from London,\" answered the king. \"Richard ere long will be on the march from the frontiers, and whatever Warwick resolves, Montagu, whose heart I hold in my hand, will bring his army to my side.  Let us wait.\"  But the next day brought no reinforcements, nor the next; and the king retired betimes to his tent, in much irritation and perplexity; when at the dead of the night he was startled from slumber by the tramp of horses, the sound of horns, the challenge of the sentinels, and, as he sprang from his couch, and hurried on his armour in alarm, the Earl of Warwick abruptly entered.  The earl's face was stern, but calm and sad; and Edward's brave heart beat loud as he gazed on his formidable subject.  \"King Edward,\" said Warwick, slowly and mournfully, \"you have deceived me!  I promised to the commons the banishment of the Woodvilles, and to a Woodville you have flown.\"  \"Your promise was given to rebels, with whom no faith can be held; and I passed from a den of mutiny to the camp of a loyal soldier.\"  \"We will not now waste words, king,\" answered Warwick.  \"Please you to mount and ride northward.  The Scotch have gained great advantages on the marches.  The Duke of Gloucester is driven backwards.  All the Lancastrians in the North have risen.  Margaret of Anjou is on the coast of Normandy, [at this time Margaret was at Harfleur--Will. Wyre] ready to set sail at the first decisive victory of her adherents.\"  \"I am with you,\" answered Edward; \"and I rejoice to think that at last I may meet a foe.  Hitherto it seems as if I had been chased by shadows.  Now may I hope to grasp the form and substance of danger and of battle.\"  \"A steed prepared for your Grace awaits you.\"  \"Whither ride we first?\"  \"To my castle of Warwick, hard by.  At noon to-morrow all will be ready for our northward march.\"  Edward, by this time having armed himself, strode from the tent into the open air.  The scene was striking: the moon was extremely bright and the sky serene, but around the tent stood a troop of torch- bearers, and the red glare shone luridly upon the steel of the serried horsemen and the banners of the earl, in which the grim white bear was wrought upon an ebon ground, quartered with the dun bull, and crested in gold with the eagle of the Monthermers.  Far as the king's eye could reach, he saw but the spears of Warwick; while a confused hum in his own encampment told that the troops Anthony Woodville had collected were not yet marshalled into order.  Edward drew back.  \"And the Lord Anthony of Scales and Rivers?\" said he, hesitatingly.  \"Choose, king, between the Lord Anthony of Scales and Rivers and Richard Nevile!\" answered Warwick, in a stern whisper.  Edward paused, and at that moment Anthony himself emerged from his tent (which adjoined the king's) in company with the Archbishop of York, who had rode thither in Warwick's train.  \"My liege,\" said that gallant knight, putting his knee to the ground, \"I have heard from the archbishop the new perils that await your Highness, and I grieve sorely that, in this strait, your councillors deem it meet to forbid me the glory of fighting or falling by your side!  I know too well the unhappy odium attached to my House and name in the northern parts, to dispute the policy which ordains my absence from your armies.  Till these feuds are over, I crave your royal leave to quit England, and perform my pilgrimage to the sainted shrine of Compostella.\"  A burning flush passed over the king's face as he raised his brother- in-law, and clasped him to his bosom.  \"Go or stay, as you will, Anthony!\" said he; \"but let these proud men know that neither time nor absence can tear you from your king's heart.  But envy must have its hour Lord Warwick, I attend you; but it seems rather as your prisoner than your liege.\"  Warwick made no answer: the king mounted, and waved his hand to Anthony.  The torches tossed to and fro, the horns sounded, and in a silence moody and resentful on either part Edward and his terrible subject rode on to the towers of Warwick.  The next day the king beheld with astonishment the immense force that, in a time so brief, the earl had collected round his standard.  From his casement, which commanded that lovely slope on which so many a tourist now gazes with an eye that seeks to call back the stormy and chivalric past, Edward beheld the earl on his renowned black charger, reviewing the thousands that, file on file and rank on rank, lifted pike and lance in the cloudless sun.  \"After all,\" muttered the king, \"I can never make a new noble a great baron!  And if in peace a great baron overshadows the throne, in time of war a great baron is a throne's bulwark!  Gramercy, I had been mad to cast away such an army,--an army fit for a king to lead!  They serve Warwick now; but Warwick is less skilful in the martial art than I, and soldiers, like hounds, love best the most dexterous huntsman!\"     CHAPTER VII.  HOW KING EDWARD ARRIVES AT THE CASTLE OF MIDDLEHAM.  On the ramparts of feudal Middleham, in the same place where Anne had confessed to Isabel the romance of her childish love, again the sisters stood, awaiting the coming of their father and the king.  They had only, with their mother, reached Middleham two days before, and the preceding night an advanced guard had arrived at the castle to announce the approach of the earl with his royal comrade and visitor. From the heights, already they beheld the long array winding in glorious order towards the mighty pile.  \"Look!\" exclaimed Isabel, \"look! already methinks I see the white steed of Clarence.  Yes! it is he! it is my George, my husband!  The banner borne before shows his device.\"  \"Ah, happy Isabel!\" said Anne, sighing; \"what rapture to await the coming of him one loves!\"  \"My sweet Anne,\" returned Isabel, passing her arm tenderly round her sister's slender waist, \"when thou hast conquered the vain folly of thy childhood, thou wilt find a Clarence of thine own.  And yet,\" added the young duchess, smiling, \"it must be the opposite of a Clarence to be to thy heart what a Clarence is to mine.  I love George's gay humour,--thou lovest a melancholy brow.  I love that charming weakness which supples to my woman will,--thou lovest a proud nature that may command thine own.  I do not respect George less, because I know my mind stronger than his own; but thou (like my gentle mother) wouldst have thy mate lord and chief in all things, and live from his life as the shadow from the sun.  But where left you our mother?\"  \"In the oratory, at prayer.\"  \"She has been sad of late.\"  \"The dark times darken her; and she ever fears the king's falseness or caprice will stir the earl up to some rash emprise.  My father's letter, brought last night to her, contains something that made her couch sleepless.\"  \"Ha!\" exclaimed the duchess, eagerly, \"my mother confides in thee more than me.  Saw you the letter?\"  \"No.\"  \"Edward will make himself unfit to reign,\" said Isabel, abruptly. \"The barons will call on him to resign; and then--and then, Anne-- sister Anne,--Warwick's daughters cannot be born to be simple subjects!\"  \"Isabel, God temper your ambition!  Oh, curb it, crush it down!  Abuse not your influence with Clarence.  Let not the brother aspire to the brother's crown.\"  \"Sister, a king's diadem covers all the sins schemed in the head that wins it!\"  As the duchess spoke, her eyes flashed and her form dilated.  Her beauty seemed almost terrible.  The gentle Anne gazed and shuddered; but ere she found words to rebuke, the lovely shape of the countess-mother was seen moving slowly towards them.  She was dressed in her robes of state to receive her kingly guest; the vest fitting high to the throat, where it joined the ermine tippet, and thickly "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7722"],["title","The Last of the Barons â€” Volume 08 (#0)"],["body","eBook was produced by Tapio Riikonen and David Widger      BOOK VIII.  IN WHICH THE LAST LINK BETWEEN KING-MAKER AND KING SNAPS ASUNDER.     CHAPTER I.  THE LADY ANNE VISITS THE COURT.  It was some weeks after the date of the events last recorded.  The storm that hung over the destinies of King Edward was dispersed for the hour, though the scattered clouds still darkened the horizon: the Earl of Warwick had defeated the Lancastrians on the frontier, [Croyl. 552] and their leader had perished on the scaffold; but Edward's mighty sword had not shone in the battle.  Chained by an attraction yet more powerful than slaughter, he had lingered at Middleham, while Warwick led his army to York; and when the earl arrived at the capital of Edward's ancestral duchy, he found that the able and active Hastings--having heard, even before he reached the Duke of Gloucester's camp, of Edward's apparent seizure by the earl and the march to Middleham--had deemed it best to halt at York, and to summon in all haste a council of such of the knights and barons as either love to the king or envy to Warwick could collect.  The report was general that Edward was retained against his will at Middleham; and this rumour Hastings gravely demanded Warwick, on the arrival of the latter at York, to disprove.  The earl, to clear himself from a suspicion that impeded all his military movements, despatched Lord Montagu to Middleham, who returned not only with the king, but the countess and her daughters, whom Edward, under pretence of proving the complete amity that existed between Warwick and himself, carried in his train.  The king's appearance at York reconciled all differences; but he suffered Warwick to march alone against the enemy, and not till after the decisive victory, which left his reign for a while without an open foe, did he return to London.  Thither the earl, by the advice of his friends, also repaired, and in a council of peers, summoned for the purpose, deigned to refute the rumours still commonly circulated by his foes, and not disbelieved by the vulgar, whether of his connivance at the popular rising or his forcible detention of the king at Middleham.  To this, agreeably to the counsel of the archbishop, succeeded a solemn interview of the heads of the Houses of York and Warwick, in which the once fair Rose of Raby (the king's mother) acted as mediator and arbiter.  The earl's word to the commons at Olney was ratified.  Edward consented to the temporary retirement of the Woodvilles, though the gallant Anthony yet delayed his pilgrimage to Compostella.  The vanity of Clarence was contented by the government of Ireland, but, under various pretences, Edward deferred his brother's departure to that important post. A general amnesty was proclaimed, a parliament summoned for the redress of popular grievances, and the betrothal of the king's daughter to Montagu's heir was proclaimed: the latter received the title of Duke of Bedford; and the whole land rejoiced in the recovered peace of the realm, the retirement of the Woodvilles, and the reconciliation of the young king with his all-beloved subject.  Never had the power of the Neviles seemed so secure; never did the throne of Edward appear so stable.  It was at this time that the king prevailed upon the earl and his countess to permit the Lady Anne to accompany the Duchess of Clarence in a visit to the palace of the Tower.  The queen had submitted so graciously to the humiliation of her family, that even the haughty Warwick was touched and softened; and the visit of his daughter at such a time became a homage to Elizabeth which it suited his chivalry to render.  The public saw in this visit, which was made with great state and ceremony, the probability of a new and popular alliance.  The archbishop had suffered the rumour of Gloucester's attachment to the Lady Anne to get abroad, and the young prince's return from the North was anxiously expected by the gossips of the day.  It was on this occasion that Warwick showed his gratitude for Marmaduke Nevile's devotion.  \"My dear and gallant kinsman,\" he said, \"I forget not that when thou didst leave the king and the court for the discredited minister and his gloomy hall,--I forget not that thou didst tell me of love to some fair maiden, which had not prospered according to thy merits.  At least it shall not be from lack of lands, or of the gold spur, which allows the wearer to ride by the side of king or kaisar, that thou canst not choose thy bride as the heart bids thee.  I pray thee, sweet cousin, to attend my child Anne to the court, where the king will show thee no ungracious countenance; but it is just to recompense thee for the loss of thy post in his highness's chamber.  I hold the king's commission to make knights of such as can pay the fee, and thy lands shall suffice for the dignity.  Kneel down and rise up, Sir Marmaduke Nevile, lord of the Manor of Borrodaile, with its woodlands and its farms, and may God and our Lady render thee puissant in battle and prosperous in love!\"  Accordingly, in his new rank, and entitled to ruffle it with the bravest, Sir Marmaduke Nevile accompanied the earl and the Lady Anne to the palace of the Tower.  As Warwick, leaving his daughter amidst the brilliant circle that surrounded Elizabeth, turned to address the king, he said, with simple and unaffected nobleness,--  \"Ah, my liege, if you needed a hostage of my faith, think that my heart is here, for verily its best blood were less dear to me than that slight girl,--the likeness of her mother, when her lips first felt the touch of mine!\"  Edward's bold brow fell, and he blushed as he answered, \"My Elizabeth will hold her as a sister.  But, cousin, part you not now for the North?\"  \"By your leave I go first to Warwick.\"  \"Ah, you do not wish to approve of my seeming preparations against France?\"  \"Nay, your Highness is not in earnest. I promised the commons that you would need no supplies for so thriftless a war.\"  \"Thou knowest I mean to fulfil all thy pledges.  But the country so swarms with disbanded soldiers, that it is politic to hold out to them a hope of service, and so let the clouds gradually pass away.\"  \"Alack, my liege,\" said Warwick, gravely, \"I suppose that a crown teaches the brow to scheme; but hearty peace or open war seems ever the best to me.\"  Edward smiled, and turned aside.  Warwick glanced at his daughter, whom Elizabeth flatteringly caressed, stifled a sigh, and the air seemed lighter to the insects of the court as his proud crest bowed beneath the doorway, and, with the pomp of his long retinue, he vanished from the scene.  \"And choose, fair Anne,\" said the queen, \"choose from my ladies whom you will have for your special train.  We would not that your attendance should be less than royal.\"  The gentle Anne in vain sought to excuse herself from an honour at once arrogant and invidious, though too innocent to perceive the cunning so characteristic of the queen; for, under the guise of a special compliment, Anne had received the royal request to have her female attendants chosen from the court, and Elizabeth now desired to force upon her a selection which could not fail to mortify those not preferred.  But glancing timidly round the circle, the noble damsel's eye rested on one fair face, and in that face there was so much that awoke her own interest, and stirred up a fond and sad remembrance, that she passed involuntarily to the stranger's side, and artlessly took her hand.  The high-born maidens, grouped around, glanced at each other with a sneer, and slunk back.  Even the queen looked surprised; but recovering herself, inclined her head graciously, and said, \"Do we read your meaning aright, Lady Anne, and would you this gentlewoman, Mistress Sibyll Warner, as one of your chamber?\"  \"Sibyll, ah, I knew that my memory failed me not,\" murmured Anne; and, after bowing assent to the queen, she said, \"Do you not also recall, fair demoiselle, our meeting, when children long years ago?\"  \"Well, noble dame,\" [The title of dame was at that time applied indiscriminately to ladies whether married or single, if of high birth.] answered Sibyll.  And as Anne turned, with her air of modest gentleness, yet of lofty birth and breeding, to explain to the queen that she had met Sibyll in earlier years, the king approached to monopolize his guest's voice and ear.  It seemed natural to all present that Edward should devote peculiar attention to the daughter of Warwick and the sister of the Duchess of Clarence; and even Elizabeth suspected no guiltier gallantry in the subdued voice, the caressing manner, which her handsome lord adopted throughout that day, even to the close of the nightly revel, towards a demoiselle too high (it might well appear) for licentious homage.  But Anne herself, though too guileless to suspect the nature of Edward's courtesy, yet shrank from it in vague terror.  All his beauty, all his fascination, could not root from her mind the remembrance of the exiled prince; nay, the brilliancy of his qualities made her the more averse to him.  It darkened the prospects of Edward of Lancaster that Edward of York should wear so gracious and so popular a form.  She hailed with delight the hour when she was conducted to her chamber, and dismissing gently the pompous retinue allotted to her, found herself alone with the young maiden whom she had elected to her special service.  \"And you remember me, too, fair Sibyll?\" said Anne, with her dulcet and endearing voice.  \"Truly, who would not? for as you, then, noble lady, glided apart from the other children, hand in hand with the young prince, in whom all dreamed to see their future king, I heard the universal murmur of--a false prophecy!\"  \"Ah! and of what?\" asked Anne.  \"That in the hand the prince clasped with his small rosy fingers--the hand of great Warwick's daughter--lay the best defence of his father's throne.\"  Anne's breast heaved, and her small foot began to mark strange "]]]
