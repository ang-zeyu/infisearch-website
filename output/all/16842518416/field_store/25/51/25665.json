And there he saw a man darkening the wood of a chair with dye and beating it with chains and making imitation wormholes in it.  And when Time saw another doing his work he stood by him awhile and looked on critically.  And at last he said: \"That is not how I work,\" and he turned the man's hair white and bent his back and put some furrows in his little cunning face; then turned and strode away, for a mighty city that was weary and sick and too long had troubled the fields was sore in need of him.     THE LITTLE CITY   I was in the pre-destined 11.8 from Goraghwood to Drogheda, when I suddenly saw the city. It was a little city in a valley, and only seemed to have a little smoke, and the sun caught the smoke and turned it golden, so that it looked like an old Italian picture where angels walk in the foreground and the rest is a blaze of gold. And beyond, as one could tell by the lie of land although one could not see through the golden smoke, I knew that there lay the paths of the roving ships.  All round there lay a patchwork of small fields all over the slopes of the hills, and the snow had come upon them tentatively, but already the birds of the waste had moved to the sheltered places for every omen boded more to fall. Far away some little hills blazed like an aureate bulwark broken off by age and fallen from the earthward rampart of Paradise. And aloof and dark the mountains stared unconcernedly seawards.  And when I saw those grey and watchful mountains sitting where they sat while the cities of the civilization of Araby and Asia arose like crocuses, and like crocuses fell, I wondered for how long there would be smoke in the valley and little fields on the hills.     THE UNPASTURABLE FIELDS   Thus spake the mountains: \"Behold us, even us; the old ones, the grey ones, that wear the feet of Time. Time on our rocks shall break his staff and stumble: and still we shall sit majestic, even as now, hearing the sound of the sea, our old coeval sister, who nurses the bones of her children and weeps for the things she has done.  \"Far, far, we stand above all things; befriending the little cities until they grow old and leave us to go among the myths.  \"We are the most imperishable mountains.\"  And softly the clouds foregathered from far places, and crag on crag and mountain upon mountain in the likeness of Caucasus upon Himalaya came riding past the sunlight upon the backs of storms and looked down idly from their golden heights upon the crests of the mountains.  \"Ye pass away,\" said the mountains.  And the clouds answered, as I dreamed or fancied,  \"We pass away, indeed we pass away, but upon our unpasturable fields Pegasus prances. Here Pegasus gallops and browses upon song which the larks bring to him every morning from far terrestrial fields. His hoof-beats ring upon our slopes at sunrise as though our fields were of silver. And breathing the dawn-wind in dilated nostrils, with head tossed upwards and with quivering wings, he stands and stares from our tremendous heights, and snorts and sees far-future wonderful wars rage in the creases and the folds of the togas that cover the knees of the gods.\"     THE WORM AND THE ANGEL   As he crawled from the tombs of the fallen a worm met with an angel.  And together they looked upon the kings and kingdoms, and youths and maidens and the cities of men. They saw the old men heavy in their chairs and heard the children singing in the fields. They saw far wars and warriors and walled towns, wisdom and wickedness, and the pomp of kings, and the people of all the lands that the sunlight knew.  And the worm spake to the angel saying: \"Behold my food.\"  \"Be dakeon para Thina poluphloisboio Thalassaes,\" murmured the angel, for they walked by the sea, \"and can you destroy that too?\"  And the worm paled in his anger to a greyness ill to behold, for for three thousand years he had tried to destroy that line and still its melody was ringing in his head.     THE SONGLESS COUNTRY   The poet came unto a great country in which there were no songs. And he lamented gently for the nation that had not any little foolish songs to sing to itself at evening.  And at last he said: \"I will make for them myself some little foolish songs so that they may be merry in the lanes and happy by the fireside.\" And for some days he made for them aimless songs such as maidens sing on the hills in the older happier countries.  Then he went to some of that nation as they sat weary with the work of the day and said to them: \"I have made you some aimless songs out of the small unreasonable legends, that are somewhat akin to the wind in the vales of my childhood; and you may care to sing them in your disconsolate evenings.\"  And they said to him:  \"If you think we have time for that sort of nonsense nowadays you cannot know much of the progress of modern commerce.\"  And then the poet wept for he said: \"Alas! They are damned.\"     THE LATEST THING   I saw an unclean-feeder by the banks of the river of Time. He crouched by orchards numerous with apples in a happy land of flowers; colossal barns stood near which the ancients had stored with grain, and the sun was golden on serene far hills behind the level lands. But his back was to all these things. He crouched and watched the river. And whatever the river chanced to send him down the unclean-feeder clutched at greedily with his arms, wading out into the water.  Now there were in those days, and indeed still are, certain uncleanly cities upon the river of Time; and from them fearfully nameless things came floating shapelessly by. And whenever the odor of these came down the river before them the unclean-feeder plunged into the dirty water and stood far out, expectant. And if he opened his mouth one saw these things on his lips.  Indeed from the upper reaches there came down sometimes the fallen rhododendron's petal, sometimes a rose; but they were useless to the unclean-feeder, and when he saw them he growled.  A poet walked beside the river's bank; his head was lifted and his look was afar; I think he saw the sea, and the hills of Fate from which the river ran. I saw the unclean-feeder standing voracious, up to his waist in that evil-smelling river.  \"Look,\" I said to the poet.  \"The current will sweep him away,\" the poet said.  \"But those cities that poison the river,\" I said to him.  He answered: \"Whenever the centuries melt on the hills of Fate the river terribly floods.\"     THE DEMAGOGUE AND THE DEMI-MONDE   A demagogue and a demi-mondaine chanced to arrive together at the gate of Paradise. And the Saint looked sorrowfully at them both.  \"Why were you a demagogue?\" he said to the first.  \"Because,\" said the demagogue, \"I stood for those principles that have made us what we are and have endeared our Party to the great heart of the people. In a word I stood unflinchingly on the plank of popular representation.\"  \"And you?\" said the Saint to her of the demi-monde.  \"I wanted money,\" said the demi-mondaine.  And after some moments' thought the Saint said: \"Well, come in; though you don't deserve to.\"  But to the demagogue he said: \"We genuinely regret that the limited space at our disposal and our unfortunate lack of interest in those Questions that you have gone so far to inculate and have so ably upheld in the past, prevent us from giving you the support for which you seek.\"  And he shut the golden door.     THE GIANT POPPY   I dreamt that I went back to the hills I knew, whence on a clear day you can see the walls of Ilion and the plains of Roncesvalles. There used to be woods along the tops of those hills with clearings in them where the moonlight fell, and there when no one watched the fairies danced.  But there were no woods when I went back, no fairies nor distant glimpse of Ilion or plains of Roncesvalles, only one giant poppy waved in the wind, and as it waved it hummed \"Remember not.\" And by its oak-like stem a poet sat, dressed like a shepherd and playing an ancient tune softly upon a pipe. I asked him if the fairies had passed that way or anything olden.  He said: \"The poppy has grown apace and is killing gods and fairies. Its fumes are suffocating the world, and its roots drain it of its beautiful strength.\" And I asked him why he sat on the hills I knew, playing an olden tune.  And he answered: \"Because the tune is bad for the poppy, which would otherwise grow more swiftly; and because if the brotherhood of which I am one were to cease to pipe on the hills men would stray over the world and be lost or come to terrible ends. We think we have saved Agamemnon.\"  Then he fell to piping again that olden tune, while the wind among the poppy's sleepy petals murmured \"Remember not. Remember not.\"     ROSES   I know a roadside where the wild rose blooms with a strange abundance. There is a beauty in the blossoms too of an almost exotic kind, a taint of deeper pink that shocks the Puritan flowers. Two hundred generations ago (generations, I mean, of roses) this was a village street; there was a floral decadence when they left their simple life and the roses came from the wilderness to clamber round houses of men.  Of all the memories of that little village, of all the cottages that stood there, of all the men and women whose homes they were, nothing remains but a more beautiful blush on the faces of the roses.  I hope that when London is clean passed away and the defeated fields come back again, like an exiled people returning after a war, they may find some beautiful thing to remind them of it all; because we have loved a little that swart old city.     THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN EAR-RINGS   It may be that I dreamed this. So much at least is certain--that I turned one day from the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7838"],["title","Fifty-One Tales (#3)"],["body","of a city, and came to its docks and saw its slimy wharves going down green and steep into the water, and saw the huge grey river slipping by and the lost things that went with it turning over and over, and I thought of the nations and unpitying Time, and saw and marvelled at the queenly ships come newly from the sea.  It was then, if I mistake not, that I saw leaning against a wall, with his face to the ships, a man with golden ear-rings. His skin had the dark tint of the southern men: the deep black hairs of his moustache were whitened a little with salt; he wore a dark blue jacket such as sailors wear, and the long boots of seafarers, but the look in his eyes was further afield than the ships, he seemed to be beholding the farthest things.  Even when I spoke to him he did not call home that look, but answered me dreamily with that same fixed stare as though his thoughts were heaving on far and lonely seas. I asked him what ship he had come by, for there were many there. The sailing ships were there with their sails all furled and their masts straight and still like a wintry forest; the steamers were there, and great liners, puffing up idle smoke into the twilight. He answered he had come by none of them. I asked him what line he worked on, for he was clearly a sailor; I mentioned well-known lines, but he did not know them. Then I asked him where he worked and what he was. And he said: \"I work in the Sargasso Sea, and I am the last of the pirates, the last left alive.\" And I shook him by the hand I do not know how many times. I said: \"We feared you were dead. We feared you were dead.\" And he answered sadly: \"No. No. I have sinned too deeply on the Spanish seas: I am not allowed to die.\"     THE DREAM OF KING KARNA-VOOTRA   King Karna-Vootra sitting on his throne commanding all things said: \"I very clearly saw last night the queenly Vava-Nyria. Though partly she was hidden by great clouds that swept continually by her, rolling over and over, yet her face was unhidden and shone, being full of moonlight.  \"I said to her:  \"'Walk with me by the great pools in many-gardened, beautiful Istrakhan where the lilies float that give delectable dreams; or, drawing aside the curtain of hanging orchids, pass with me thence from the pools by a secret path through the else impassable jungle that fills the only way between the mountains that shut in Istrakhan. They shut it in and look on it with joy at morning and at evening when the pools are strange with light, till in their gladness sometimes there melts the deadly snow that kills upon lonely heights the mountaineer. They have valleys among them older than the wrinkles in the moon.  \"'Come with me thence or linger with me there and either we shall come to romantic lands which the men of the caravans only speak of in song; or else we shall listlessly walk in a land so lovely that even the butterflies that float about it when they see their images flash in the sacred pools are terrified by their beauty, and each night we shall hear the myriad nightingales all in one chorus sing the stars to death. Do this and I will send heralds far from here with tidings of thy beauty; and they shall run and come to Séndara and men shall know it there who herd brown sheep; and from Séndara the rumour shall spread on, down either bank of the holy river of Zoth, till the people that make wattles in the plains shall hear of it and sing; but the heralds shall go northward along the hills until they come to Sooma. And in that golden city they shall tell the kings, that sit in their lofty alabaster house, of thy strange and sudden smiles. And often in distant markets shall thy story be told by merchants out from Sooma as they sit telling careless tales to lure men to their wares.  \"'And the heralds passing thence shall come even to Ingra, to Ingra where they dance. And there they shall tell of thee, so that thy name long hence shall be sung in that joyous city. And there they shall borrow camels and pass over the sands and go by desert ways to distant Nirid to tell of thee to the lonely men in the mountain monasteries.  \"'Come with me even now for it is Spring.'\"  \"And as I said this she faintly yet perceptibly shook her head. And it was only then I remembered my youth was gone, and she dead forty years.\"     THE STORM   They saw a little ship that was far at sea and that went by the name of the _Petite Espérance_. And because of its uncouth rig and its lonely air and the look that it had of coming from strangers' lands they said: \"It is neither a ship to greet nor desire, nor yet to succor when in the hands of the sea.\"  And the sea rose up as is the wont of the sea and the little ship from afar was in his hands, and frailer than ever seemed its feeble masts with their sails of fantastic cut and their alien flags. And the sea made a great and very triumphing voice, as the sea doth. And then there arose a wave that was very strong, even the ninth-born son of the hurricane and the tide, and hid the little ship and hid the whole of the far parts of the sea. Thereat said those who stood on the good dry land:  \"'Twas but a little, worthless alien ship and it is sunk at sea, and it is good and right that the storm have spoil.\" And they turned and watched the course of the merchant-men, laden with silver and appeasing spice; year after year they cheered them into port and praised their goods and their familiar sails. And many years went by.  And at last with decks and bulwarks covered with cloth of gold; with age-old parrots that had known the troubadours, singing illustrious songs and preening their feathers of gold; with a hold full of emeralds and rubies; all silken with Indian loot; furling as it came in its way-worn alien sails, a galleon glided into port, shutting the sunlight from the merchantmen: and lo! it loomed the equal of the cliffs.  \"Who are you?\" they asked, \"far-travelled wonderful ship?\"  And they said: \"The _Petite Espérance_.\"  \"O,\" said the people on shore. \"We thought you were sunk at sea.\"  \"Sunk at sea?\" sang the sailors. \"We could not be sunk at sea--we had the gods on board.\"     A MISTAKEN IDENTITY   Fame as she walked at evening in a city saw the painted face of Notoriety flaunting beneath a gas-lamp, and many kneeled unto her in the dirt of the road.  \"Who are you?\" Fame said to her.  \"I am Fame,\" said Notoriety.  Then Fame stole softly away so that no one knew she had gone.  And Notoriety presently went forth and all her worshippers rose and followed after, and she led them, as was most meet, to her native Pit.     THE TRUE HISTORY OF THE HARE AND THE TORTOISE   For a long time there was doubt with acrimony among the beasts as to whether the Hare or the Tortoise could run the swifter. Some said the Hare was the swifter of the two because he had such long ears, and others said the Tortoise was the swifter because anyone whose shell was so hard as that should be able to run hard too. And lo, the forces of estrangement and disorder perpetually postponed a decisive contest.  But when there was nearly war among the beasts, at last an arrangement was come to and it was decided that the Hare and the Tortoise should run a race of five hundred yards so that all should see who was right.  \"Ridiculous nonsense!\" said the Hare, and it was all his backers could do to get him to run.  \"The contest is most welcome to me,\" said the Tortoise, \"I shall not shirk it.\"  O, how his backers cheered.  Feeling ran high on the day of the race; the goose rushed at the fox and nearly pecked him. Both sides spoke loudly of the approaching victory up to the very moment of the race.  \"I am absolutely confident of success,\" said the Tortoise. But the Hare said nothing, he looked bored and cross. Some of his supporters deserted him then and went to the other side, who were loudly cheering the Tortoise's inspiriting words. But many remained with the Hare. \"We shall not be disappointed in him,\" they said. \"A beast with such long ears is bound to win.\"  \"Run hard,\" said the supporters of the Tortoise.  And \"run hard\" became a kind of catch-phrase which everybody repeated to one another. \"Hard shell and hard living. That's what the country wants. Run hard,\" they said. And these words were never uttered but multitudes cheered from their hearts.  Then they were off, and suddenly there was a hush.  The Hare dashed off for about a hundred yards, then he looked round to see where his rival was.  \"It is rather absurd,\" he said, \"to race with a Tortoise.\" And he sat down and scratched himself. \"Run hard! Run hard!\" shouted some.  \"Let him rest,\" shouted others. And \"let him rest\" became a catch-phrase too.  And after a while his rival drew near to him.  \"There comes that damned Tortoise,\" said the Hare, and he got up and ran as hard as could be so that he should not let the Tortoise beat him.  \"Those ears will win,\" said his friends. \"Those ears will win; and establish upon an incontestable footing the truth of what we have said.\" And some of them turned to the backers of the Tortoise and said: \"What about your beast now?\"  \"Run hard,\" they replied. \"Run hard.\"  The Hare ran on for nearly three hundred yards, nearly in fact as far as the winning-post, when it suddenly struck him what a fool he looked running races with a Tortoise who was nowhere in sight, and he sat down again and scratched.  \"Run hard. Run hard,\" said the crowd, and \"Let him rest.\"  \"Whatever is the use of it?\" said the Hare, and this time he stopped for good. Some say he slept.  There was desperate excitement for an hour or two, and then the Tortoise won.  \"Run hard. Run hard,\" shouted his backers. \"Hard shell and hard living: that's what has done it.\" And then they asked the Tortoise what his achievement signified, and he went and asked the Turtle. And the Turtle said, \"It is a glorious victory for the forces of swiftness.\" And then the Tortoise repeated it to his friends. And all the beasts said nothing else for years. And even to this "]]]
