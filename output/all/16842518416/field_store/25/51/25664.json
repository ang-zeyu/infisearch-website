And still the poet made for her little chaplets of song, to deck her forehead in the courts of Time: and still she wore instead the worthless garlands, that boisterous citizens flung to her in the ways, made out of perishable things.  And after a while whenever these garlands died the poet came to her with his chaplets of song; and still she laughed at him and wore the worthless wreaths, though they always died at evening.  And one day in his bitterness the poet rebuked her, and said to her: \"Lovely Fame, even in the highways and the byways you have not foreborne to laugh and shout and jest with worthless men, and I have toiled for you and dreamed of you and you mock me and pass me by.\"  And Fame turned her back on him and walked away, but in departing she looked over her shoulder and smiled at him as she had not smiled before, and, almost speaking in a whisper, said:  \"I will meet you in the graveyard at the back of the Workhouse in a hundred years.\"     CHARON   Charon leaned forward and rowed. All things were one with his weariness.  It was not with him a matter of years or of centuries, but of wide floods of time, and an old heaviness and a pain in the arms that had become for him part of the scheme that the gods had made and was of a piece with Eternity.  If the gods had even sent him a contrary wind it would have divided all time in his memory into two equal slabs.  So grey were all things always where he was that if any radiance lingered a moment among the dead, on the face of such a queen perhaps as Cleopatra, his eyes could not have perceived it.  It was strange that the dead nowadays were coming in such numbers. They were coming in thousands where they used to come in fifties. It was neither Charon's duty nor his wont to ponder in his grey soul why these things might be. Charon leaned forward and rowed.  Then no one came for a while. It was not usual for the gods to send no one down from Earth for such a space. But the gods knew best.  Then one man came alone. And the little shade sat shivering on a lonely bench and the great boat pushed off. Only one passenger: the gods knew best. And great and weary Charon rowed on and on beside the little, silent, shivering ghost.  And the sound of the river was like a mighty sigh that Grief in the beginning had sighed among her sisters, and that could not die like the echoes of human sorrow failing on earthly hills, but was as old as time and the pain in Charon's arms.  Then the boat from the slow, grey river loomed up to the coast of Dis and the little, silent shade still shivering stepped ashore, and Charon turned the boat to go wearily back to the world. Then the little shadow spoke, that had been a man.  \"I am the last,\" he said.  No one had ever made Charon smile before, no one before had ever made him weep.     THE DEATH OF PAN   When the travellers from London entered Arcady they lamented one to another the death of Pan.  And anon they saw him lying stiff and still.  Horned Pan was still and the dew was on his fur; he had not the look of a live animal. And then they said, \"It is true that Pan is dead.\"  And, standing melancholy by that huge prone body, they looked for long at memorable Pan.  And evening came and a small star appeared.  And presently from a hamlet of some Arcadian valley, with a sound of idle song, Arcadian maidens came.  And, when they saw there, suddenly in the twilight, that old recumbent god, they stopped in their running and whispered among themselves. \"How silly he looks,\" they said, and thereat they laughed a little.  And at the sound of their laughter Pan leaped up and the gravel flew from his hooves.  And, for as long as the travellers stood and listened, the crags and the hill-tops of Arcady rang with the sounds of pursuit.     THE SPHINX AT GIZEH   I saw the other day the Sphinx's painted face.  She had painted her face in order to ogle Time.  And he has spared no other painted face in all the world but hers.  Delilah was younger than she, and Delilah is dust. Time hath loved nothing but this worthless painted face.  I do not care that she is ugly, nor that she has painted her face, so that she only lure his secret from Time.  Time dallies like a fool at her feet when he should be smiting cities.  Time never wearies of her silly smile.  There are temples all about her that he has forgotten to spoil.  I saw an old man go by, and Time never touched him.  Time that has carried away the seven gates of Thebes!  She has tried to bind him with ropes of eternal sand, she had hoped to oppress him with the Pyramids.  He lies there in the sand with his foolish hair all spread about her paws.  If she ever finds his secret we will put out his eyes, so that he shall find no more our beautiful things--there are lovely gates in Florence that I fear he will carry away.  We have tried to bind him with song and with old customs, but they only held him for a little while, and he has always smitten us and mocked us.  When he is blind he shall dance to us and make sport.  Great clumsy time shall stumble and dance, who liked to kill little children, and can hurt even the daisies no longer.  Then shall our children laugh at him who slew Babylon's winged bulls, and smote great numbers of the gods and fairies--when he is shorn of his hours and his years.  We will shut him up in the Pyramid of Cheops, in the great chamber where the sarcophagus is. Thence we will lead him out when we give our feasts. He shall ripen our corn for us and do menial work.  We will kiss they painted face, O Sphinx, if thou wilt betray to us Time.  And yet I fear that in his ultimate anguish he may take hold blindly of the world and the moon, and slowly pull down upon him the House of Man.     THE HEN   All along the farmyard gables the swallows sat a-row, twittering uneasily to one another, telling of many things, but thinking only of Summer and the South, for Autumn was afoot and the North wind waiting.  And suddenly one day they were all quite gone. And everyone spoke of the swallows and the South.  \"I think I shall go South myself next year,\" said a hen.  And the year wore on and the swallows came again, and the year wore on and they sat again on the gables, and all the poultry discussed the departure of the hen.  And very early one morning, the wind being from the North, the swallows all soared suddenly and felt the wind in their wings; and a strength came upon them and a strange old knowledge and a more than human faith, and flying high they left the smoke of our cities and small remembered eaves, and saw at last the huge and homeless sea, and steering by grey sea-currents went southward with the wind. And going South they went by glittering fog-banks and saw old islands lifting their heads above them; they saw the slow quests of the wandering ships, and divers seeking pearls, and lands at war, till there came in view the mountains that they sought and the sight of the peaks they knew; and they descended into an austral valley, and saw Summer sometimes sleeping and sometimes singing song.  \"I think the wind is about right,\" said the hen; and she spread her wings and ran out of the poultry-yard. And she ran fluttering out on to the road and some way down it until she came to a garden.  At evening she came back panting.  And in the poultry-yard she told the poultry how she had gone South as far as the high road, and saw the great world's traffic going by, and came to lands where the potato grew, and saw the stubble upon which men live, and at the end of the road had found a garden, and there were roses in it--beautiful roses!--and the gardener himself was there with his braces on.  \"How extremely interesting,\" the poultry said, \"and what a really beautiful description!\"  And the Winter wore away, and the bitter months went by, and the Spring of the year appeared, and the swallows came again.  \"We have been to the South,\" they said, \"and the valleys beyond the sea.\"  But the poultry would not agree that there was a sea in the South: \"You should hear our hen,\" they said.     WIND AND FOG   \"Way for us,\" said the North Wind as he came down the sea on an errand of old Winter.  And he saw before him the grey silent fog that lay along the tides.  \"Way for us,\" said the North Wind, \"O ineffectual fog, for I am Winter's leader in his age-old war with the ships. I overwhelm them suddenly in my strength, or drive upon them the huge seafaring bergs. I cross an ocean while you move a mile. There is mourning in inland places when I have met the ships. I drive them upon the rocks and feed the sea. Wherever I appear they bow to our lord the Winter.\"  And to his arrogant boasting nothing said the fog. Only he rose up slowly and trailed away from the sea and,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7838"],["title","Fifty-One Tales (#1)"],["body","up long valleys, took refuge among the hills; and night came down and everything was still, and the fog began to mumble in the stillness. And I heard him telling infamously to himself the tale of his horrible spoils. \"A hundred and fifteen galleons of old Spain, a certain argosy that went from Tyre, eight fisher-fleets and ninety ships of the line, twelve warships under sail, with their carronades, three hundred and eighty-seven river-craft, forty-two merchantmen that carried spice, four quinquiremes, ten triremes, thirty yachts, twenty-one battleships of the modern time, nine thousand admirals....\" he mumbled and chuckled on, till I suddenly arose and fled from his fearful contamination.     THE RAFT-BUILDERS   All we who write put me in mind of sailors hastily making rafts upon doomed ships.  When we break up under the heavy years and go down into eternity with all that is ours our thoughts like small lost rafts float on awhile upon Oblivion's sea. They will not carry much over those tides, our names and a phrase or two and little else.  They that write as a trade to please the whim of the day, they are like sailors that work at the rafts only to warm their hands and to distract their thoughts from their certain doom; their rafts go all to pieces before the ship breaks up.  See now Oblivion shimmering all around us, its very tranquility deadlier than tempest. How little all our keels have troubled it. Time in its deeps swims like a monstrous whale; and, like a whale, feeds on the littlest things--small tunes and little unskilled songs of the olden, golden evenings--and anon turneth whale-like to overthrow whole ships.  See now the wreckage of Babylon floating idly, and something there that once was Nineveh; already their kings and queens are in the deeps among the weedy masses of old centuries that hide the sodden bulk of sunken Tyre and make a darkness round Persepolis.  For the rest I dimly see the forms of foundered ships on the sea-floor strewn with crowns.  Our ships were all unseaworthy from the first.  There goes the raft that Homer made for Helen.     THE WORKMAN   I saw a workman fall with his scaffolding right from the summit of some vast hotel. And as he came down I saw him holding a knife and trying to cut his name on the scaffolding. He had time to try and do this for he must have had nearly three hundred feet to fall. And I could think of nothing but his folly in doing this futile thing, for not only would the man be unrecognizably dead in three seconds, but the very pole on which he tried to scratch whatever of his name he had time for was certain to be burnt in a few weeks for firewood.  Then I went home for I had work to do. And all that evening I thought of the man's folly, till the thought hindered me from serious work.  And late that night while I was still at work, the ghost of the workman floated through my wall and stood before me laughing.  I heard no sound until after I spoke to it; but I could see the grey diaphanous form standing before me shuddering with laughter.  I spoke at last and asked what it was laughing at, and then the ghost spoke. It said: \"I'm a laughin' at you sittin' and workin' there.\"  \"And why,\" I asked, \"do you laugh at serious work?\"  \"Why, yer bloomin' life 'ull go by like a wind,\" he said, \"and yer 'ole silly civilization 'ull be tidied up in a few centuries.\"  Then he fell to laughing again and this time audibly; and, laughing still, faded back through the wall again and into the eternity from which he had come.     THE GUEST   A young man came into an ornate restaurant at eight o'clock in London.  He was alone, but two places had been laid at the table which was reserved for him. He had chosen the dinner very carefully, by letter a week before.  A waiter asked him about the other guest.  \"You probably won't see him till the coffee comes,\" the young man told him; so he was served alone.  Those at adjacent tables might have noticed the young man continually addressing the empty chair and carrying on a monologue with it throughout his elaborate dinner.  \"I think you knew my father,\" he said to it over the soup.  \"I sent for you this evening,\" he continued, \"because I want you to do me a good turn; in fact I must insist on it.\"  There was nothing eccentric about the man except for this habit of addressing an empty chair, certainly he was eating as good a dinner as any sane man could wish for.  After the Burgundy had been served he became more voluble in his monologue, not that he spoiled his wine by drinking excessively.  \"We have several acquaintances in common,\" he said. \"I met King Seti a year ago in Thebes. I think he has altered very little since you knew him. I thought his forehead a little low for a king's. Cheops has left the house that he built for your reception, he must have prepared for you for years and years. I suppose you have seldom been entertained like that. I ordered this dinner over a week ago. I thought then that a lady might have come with me, but as she wouldn't I've asked you. She may not after all be as lovely as Helen of Troy. Was Helen very lovely? Not when you knew her, perhaps. You were lucky in Cleopatra, you must have known her when she was in her prime.  \"You never knew the mermaids nor the fairies nor the lovely goddesses of long ago, that's where we have the best of you.\"  He was silent when the waiters came to his table, but rambled merrily on as soon as they left, still turned to the empty chair.  \"You know I saw you here in London only the other day. You were on a motor bus going down Ludgate Hill. It was going much too fast. London is a good place. But I shall be glad enough to leave it. It was in London that I met the lady I that was speaking about. If it hadn't been for London I probably shouldn't have met her, and if it hadn't been for London she probably wouldn't have had so much besides me to amuse her. It cuts both ways.\"  He paused once to order coffee, gazing earnestly at the waiter and putting a sovereign in his hand. \"Don't let it be chicory,\" said he.  The waiter brought the coffee, and the young man dropped a tabloid of some sort into his cup.  \"I don't suppose you come here very often,\" he went on. \"Well, you probably want to be going. I haven't taken you much out of your way, there is plenty for you to do in London.\"  Then having drunk his coffee he fell on to the floor by a foot of the empty chair, and a doctor who was dining in the room bent over him and announced to the anxious manager the visible presence of the young man's guest.     DEATH AND ODYSSEUS   In the Olympian courts Love laughed at Death, because he was unsightly, and because She couldn't help it, and because he never did anything worth doing, and because She would.  And Death hated being laughed at, and used to brood apart thinking only of his wrongs and of what he could do to end this intolerable treatment.  But one day Death appeared in the courts with an air and They all noticed it. \"What are you up to now?\" said Love. And Death with some solemnity said to Her: \"I am going to frighten Odysseus\"; and drawing about him his grey traveller's cloak went out through the windy door with his jowl turned earthwards.  And he came soon to Ithaca and the hall that Athene knew, and opened the door and saw there famous Odysseus, with his white locks bending close over the fire, trying to warm his hands.  And the wind through the open door blew bitterly on Odysseus.  And Death came up behind him, and suddenly shouted.  And Odysseus went on warming his pale hands.  Then Death came close and began to mouth at him. And after a while Odysseus turned and spoke. And \"Well, old servant,\" he said, \"have your masters been kind to you since I made you work for me round Ilion?\"  And Death for some while stood mute, for he thought of the laughter of Love.  Then \"Come now,\" said Odysseus, \"lend me your shoulder,\" and he leaning heavily on that bony joint, they went together through the open door.     DEATH AND THE ORANGE   Two dark young men in a foreign southern land sat at a restaurant table with one woman.  And on the woman's plate was a small orange which had an evil laughter in its heart.  And both of the men would be looking at the woman all the time, and they ate little and they drank much.  And the woman was smiling equally at each.  Then the small orange that had the laughter in its heart rolled slowly off the plate on to the floor. And the dark young men both sought for it at once, and they met suddenly beneath the table, and soon they were speaking swift words to one another, and a horror and an impotence came over the Reason of each as she sat helpless at the back of the mind, and the heart of the orange laughed and the woman went on smiling; and Death, who was sitting at another table, tête-à-tête with an old man, rose and came over to listen to the quarrel.     THE PRAYER OF THE FLOWERS   It was the voice of the flowers on the West wind, the lovable, the old, the lazy West wind, blowing ceaselessly, blowing sleepily, going Greecewards.  \"The woods have gone away, they have fallen and left us; men love us no longer, we are lonely by moonlight. Great engines rush over the beautiful fields, their ways lie hard and terrible up and down the land.  \"The cancrous cities spread over the grass, they clatter in their lairs continually, they glitter about us blemishing the night.  \"The woods are gone, O Pan, the woods, the woods. And thou art far, O Pan, and far away.\"  I was standing by night between two railway embankments on the edge of a Midland city. On one of them I saw the trains go by, once in every two minutes, and on the other, the trains went by twice in every five.  Quite close were the glaring factories, and the sky above them wore the fearful look that it wears in dreams of fever.  The flowers were right in the stride of that advancing city, and thence I heard them sending up their cry. And then I heard, beating musically up wind, the voice of "]]]
