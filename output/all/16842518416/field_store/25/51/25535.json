CHAPTER I.  It is several weeks after the date of the last chapter; the lime-trees in the Tuileries are clothed in green.  In a somewhat spacious apartment on the ground-floor in the quiet locality of the Rue d'Anjou, a man was seated, very still and evidently absorbed in deep thought, before a writing-table placed close to the window.  Seen thus, there was an expression of great power both of intellect and of character in a face which, in ordinary social commune, might rather be noticeable for an aspect of hardy frankness, suiting well with the clear- cut, handsome profile, and the rich dark auburn hair, waving carelessly over one of those broad open foreheads, which, according to an old writer, seem the \"frontispiece of a temple dedicated to Honour.\"  The forehead, indeed, was the man's most remarkable feature.  It could not but prepossess the beholder.  When, in private theatricals, he had need to alter the character of his countenance, he did it effectually, merely by forcing down his hair till it reached his eyebrows.  He no longer then looked like the same man.  The person I describe has been already introduced to the reader as Graham Vane.  But perhaps this is the fit occasion to enter into some such details as to his parentage and position as may make the introduction more satisfactory and complete.  His father, the representative of a very ancient family, came into possession, after a long minority, of what may be called a fair squire's estate, and about half a million in moneyed investments, inherited on the female side.  Both land and money were absolutely at his disposal, unencumbered by entail or settlement.  He was a man of a brilliant, irregular genius, of princely generosity, of splendid taste, of a gorgeous kind of pride closely allied to a masculine kind of vanity.  As soon as he was of age he began to build, converting his squire's hall into a ducal palace.  He then stood for the county; and in days before the first Reform Bill, when a county election was to the estate of a candidate what a long war is to the debt of a nation.  He won the election; he obtained early successes in Parliament.  It was said by good authorities in political circles that, if he chose, he might aspire to lead his party, and ultimately to hold the first rank in the government of his country.  That may or may not be true; but certainly he did not choose to take the trouble necessary for such an ambition.  He was too fond of pleasure, of luxury, of pomp.  He kept a famous stud of racers and hunters.  He was a munificent patron of art.  His establishments, his entertainments, were on a par with those of the great noble who represented the loftiest (Mr. Vane would not own it to be the eldest) branch of his genealogical tree.  He became indifferent to political contests, indolent in his attendance at the House, speaking seldom, not at great length nor with much preparation, but with power and fire, originality and genius; so that he was not only effective as an orator, but combining with eloquence advantages of birth, person, station, the reputation of patriotic independence, and genial attributes of character, he was an authority of weight in the scales of party.  This gentleman, at the age of forty, married the dowerless daughter of a poor but distinguished naval officer, of noble family, first cousin to the Duke of Alton.  He settled on her a suitable jointure, but declined to tie up any portion of his property for the benefit of children by the marriage.  He declared that so much of his fortune was invested either in mines, the produce of which was extremely fluctuating, or in various funds, over rapid transfers in which it was his amusement and his interest to have control, unchecked by reference to trustees, that entails and settlements on children were an inconvenience he declined to incur.  Besides, he held notions of his own as to the wisdom of keeping children dependent on their father.  \"What numbers of young men,\" said he, \"are ruined in character and in fortune by knowing that when their father dies they are certain of the same provision, no matter how they displease him; and in the meanwhile forestalling that provision by recourse to usurers.\" These arguments might not have prevailed over the bride's father a year or two later, when, by the death of intervening kinsmen, he became Duke of Alton; but in his then circumstances the marriage itself was so much beyond the expectations which the portionless daughter of a sea-captain has the right to form that Mr. Vane had it all his own way, and he remained absolute master of his whole fortune, save of that part of his landed estate on which his wife's jointure was settled; and even from this incumbrance he was very soon freed.  His wife died in the second year of marriage, leaving an only son,--Graham.  He grieved for her loss with all the passion of an impressionable, ardent, and powerful nature. Then for a while he sought distraction to his sorrow by throwing himself into public life with a devoted energy lie had not previously displayed.  His speeches served to bring his party into power, and he yielded, though reluctantly, to the unanimous demand of that party that he should accept one of the highest offices in the new Cabinet.  He acquitted himself well as an administrator, but declared, no doubt honestly, that he felt like Sinbad released from the old man on his back, when, a year or two afterwards, he went out of office with his party.  No persuasions could induce him to come in again; nor did he ever again take a very active part in debate.  \"No,\" said he, \"I was born to the freedom of a private gentleman: intolerable to me is the thraldom of a public servant.  But I will bring up my son so that he may acquit the debt which I decline to pay to my country.\"  There he kept his word.  Graham had been carefully educated for public life, the ambition for it dinned into his ear from childhood.  In his school vacations his father made him learn and declaim chosen specimens of masculine oratory; engaged an eminent actor to give him lessons in elocution; bade him frequent theatres, and study there the effect which words derive from looks and gesture; encouraged him to take part himself in private theatricals.  To all this the boy lent his mind with delight.  He had the orator's inborn temperament; quick, yet imaginative, and loving the sport of rivalry and contest.  Being also, in his boyish years, good-humoured and joyous, he was not more a favourite with the masters in the schoolroom than with the boys in the play-ground. Leaving Eton at seventeen, he then entered at Cambridge, and became, in his first term, the most popular speaker at the Union.  But his father cut short his academical career, and decided, for reasons of his own, to place him at once in diplomacy.  He was attached to the Embassy at Paris, and partook of the pleasures and dissipations of that metropolis too keenly to retain much of the sterner ambition to which he had before devoted himself.  Becoming one of the spoiled darlings of fashion, there was great danger that his character would relax into the easy grace of the Epicurean, when all such loiterings in the Rose Garden were brought to abrupt close by a rude and terrible change in his fortunes.  His father was killed by a fall from his horse in hunting; and when his affairs were investigated, they were found to be hopelessly involved: apparently the assets would not suffice for the debts.  The elder Vane himself was probably not aware of the extent of his liabilities.  He had never wanted ready money to the last.  He could always obtain that from a money-lender, or from the sale of his funded investments.  But it became obvious, on examining his papers, that he knew at least how impaired would be the heritage he should bequeath to a son whom he idolized.  For that reason he had given Graham a profession in diplomacy, and for that reason he had privately applied to the Ministry for the Viceroyalty of India, in the event of its speedy vacancy.  He was eminent enough not to anticipate refusal, and with economy in that lucrative post much of his pecuniary difficulties might have been redeemed, and at least an independent provision secured for his son.  Graham, like Alain de Rochebriant, allowed no reproach on his father's memory; indeed, with more reason than Alain, for the elder Vane's fortune had at least gone on no mean and frivolous dissipation.  It had lavished itself on encouragement to art, on great objects of public beneficence, on public-spirited aid of political objects; and even in more selfish enjoyments there was a certain grandeur in his princely hospitalities, in his munificent generosity, in a warm-hearted carelessness for money.  No indulgence in petty follies or degrading vices aggravated the offence of the magnificent squanderer.  \"Let me look on my loss of fortune as a gain to myself,\" said Graham, manfully.  \"Had I been a rich man, my experience of Paris tells me that I should most likely have been a very idle one.  Now that I have no gold, I must dig in myself for iron.\"  The man to whom he said this was an uncle-in-law,--if I may use that phrase,--the Right Hon.  Richard King, popularly styled \"the blameless King.\"  This gentleman had married the sister of Graham's mother, whose loss in his infancy and boyhood she had tenderly and anxiously sought to supply. It is impossible to conceive a woman more fitted to invite love and reverence than was Lady Janet King, her manners were so sweet and gentle, her whole nature so elevated and pure.  Her father had succeeded to the dukedom when she married Mr. King, and the alliance was not deemed quite suitable.  Still it was not one to which the Duke would have been fairly justified in refusing his assent.  Mr. King could not indeed boast of noble ancestry, nor was even a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7738"],["title","The Parisians â€” Volume 02 (#1)"],["body","proprietor; but he was a not-undistinguished member of Parliament, of irreproachable character, and ample fortune inherited from a distant kinsman, who had enriched himself as a merchant.  It was on both sides a marriage of love.  It is popularly said that a man uplifts a wife to his own rank: it as often happens that a woman uplifts her husband to the dignity of her own character.  Richard King rose greatly in public estimation after his marriage with Lady Janet.  She united to a sincere piety a very active and a very enlightened benevolence.  She guided his ambition aside from mere party politics into subjects of social and religious interest, and in devoting himself to these he achieved a position more popular and more respected than he could ever have won in the strife of party.  When the Government of which the elder Vane became a leading Minister was formed, it was considered a great object to secure a name as high in the religious world, so beloved by the working classes, as that of Richard King; and he accepted one of those places which, though not in the cabinet, confers the rank of Privy Councillor.  When that brief-lived Administration ceased, he felt the same sensation of relief that Vane had felt, and came to the same resolution never again to accept office, but from different reasons, all of which need not now be detailed.  Amongst them, however, certainly this: he was exceedingly sensitive to opinion, thin-skinned as to abuse, and very tenacious of the respect due to his peculiar character of sanctity and philanthropy.  He writhed under every newspaper article that had made \"the blameless King\" responsible for the iniquities of the Government to which he belonged. In the loss of office he seemed to recover his former throne.  Mr. King heard Graham's resolution with a grave approving smile, and his interest in the young man became greatly increased.  He devoted himself strenuously to the object of saving to Graham some wrecks of his paternal fortunes, and having a clear head and great experience in the transaction of business, he succeeded beyond the most sanguine expectations formed by the family solicitor.  A rich manufacturer was found to purchase at a fancy price the bulk of the estate with the palatial mansion, which the estate alone could never have sufficed to maintain with suitable establishments.  So that when all debts were paid, Graham found himself in possession of a clear income of about L500 a year, invested in a mortgage secured on a part of the hereditary lands, on which was seated an old hunting-lodge bought by a brewer.  With this portion of the property Graham parted very reluctantly.  It was situated amid the most picturesque scenery on the estate, and the lodge itself was a remnant of the original residence of his ancestors before it had been abandoned for that which, built in the reign of Elizabeth, had been expanded into a Trenthain-like palace by the last owner.  But Mr. King's argument reconciled him to the sacrifice.  \"I can manage,\" said the prudent adviser, \"if you insist on it, to retain that remnant of the hereditary estate which you are so loath to part with.  But how?  by mortgaging it to an extent that will scarcely leave you L50. a year net from the rents.  This is not all.  Your mind will then be distracted from the large object of a career to the small object of retaining a few family acres; you will be constantly hampered by private anxieties and fears; you could do nothing for the benefit of those around you,--could not repair a farmhouse for a better class of tenant, could not rebuild a labourer's dilapidated cottage.  Give up an idea that might be very well for a man whose sole ambition was to remain a squire, however beggarly. Launch yourself into the larger world of metropolitan life with energies wholly unshackled, a mind wholly undisturbed, and secure of an income which, however modest, is equal to that of most young men who enter that world as your equals.\"  Graham was convinced, and yielded, though with a bitter pang.  It is hard for a man whose fathers have lived on the soil to give up all trace of their whereabouts.  But none saw in him any morbid consciousness of change of fortune, when, a year after his father's death, he reassumed his place in society.  If before courted for his expectations, he was still courted for himself; by many of the great who had loved his father, perhaps even courted more.  He resigned the diplomatic career, not merely because the rise in that profession is slow, and in the intermediate steps the chances of distinction are slight and few, but more because he desired to cast his lot in the home country, and regarded the courts of other lands as exile.  It was not true, however, as Lemercier had stated on report, that he lived on his pen.  Curbing all his old extravagant tastes, L500 a year amply supplied his wants.  But he had by his pen gained distinction, and created great belief in his abilities for a public career.  He had written critical articles, read with much praise, in periodicals of authority, and had published one or two essays on political questions which had created yet more sensation.  It was only the graver literature, connected more or less with his ultimate object of a public career, in which he had thus evinced his talents of composition.  Such writings were not of a nature to bring him much money, but they gave him a definite and solid station.  In the old time, before the first Reform Bill, his reputation would have secured him at once a seat in Parliament; but the ancient nurseries of statesmen are gone, and their place is not supplied.  He had been invited, however, to stand for more than one large and populous borough, with very fair prospects of success; and, whatever the expense, Mr. King had offered to defray it.  But Graham would not have incurred the latter obligation; and when he learned the pledges which his supporters would have exacted, he would not have stood if success had been certain and the cost nothing.  \"I cannot,\" he said to his friends, \"go into the consideration of what is best for the country with my thoughts manacled; and I cannot be both representative and slave of the greatest ignorance of the greatest number.  I bide my time, and meanwhile I prefer to write as I please, rather than vote as I don't please.\"  Three years went by, passed chiefly in England, partly in travel; and at the age of thirty, Graham Vane was still one of those of whom admirers say, \"He will be a great man some day;\" and detractors reply, \"Some day seems a long way off.\"  The same fastidiousness which had operated against that entrance into Parliament, to which his ambition not the less steadily adapted itself, had kept him free from the perils of wedlock.  In his heart he yearned for love and domestic life, but he had hitherto met with no one who realized the ideal he had formed.  With his person, his accomplishments, his connections, and his repute, he might have made many an advantageous marriage.  But somehow or other the charm vanished from a fair face, if the shadow of a money-bag fell on it; on the other hand, his ambition occupied so large a share in his thoughts that he would have fled in time from the temptation of a marriage that would have overweighted him beyond the chance of rising.  Added to all, he desired in a wife an intellect that, if not equal to his own, could become so by sympathy,--a union of high culture and noble aspiration, and yet of loving womanly sweetness which a man seldom finds out of books; and when he does find it, perhaps it does not wear the sort of face that he fancies.  Be that as it may, Graham was still unmarried and heart-whole.  And now a new change in his life befell him.  Lady Janet died of a fever contracted in her habitual rounds of charity among the houses of the poor.  She had been to him as the most tender mother, and a lovelier soul than hers never alighted on the earth.  His grief was intense; but what was her husband's?--one of those griefs that kill.  To the side of Richard King his Janet had been as the guardian angel. His love for her was almost worship: with her, every object in a life hitherto so active and useful seemed gone.  He evinced no noisy passion of sorrow.  He shut himself up, and refused to see even Graham.  But after some weeks had passed, he admitted the clergyman in whom on spiritual matters he habitually confided, and seemed consoled by the visits; then he sent for his lawyer and made his will; after which he allowed Graham to call on him daily, on the condition that there should be no reference to his loss.  He spoke to the young man on other subjects, rather drawing him out about himself, sounding his opinion on various grave matters, watching his face while he questioned, as if seeking to dive into his heart, and sometimes pathetically sinking into silence, broken but by sighs.  So it went on for a few more weeks; then he took the advice of his physician to seek change of air and scene. He went away alone, without even a servant, not leaving word where he had gone.  After a little while he returned, more ailing, more broken than before.  One morning he was found insensible,--stricken by paralysis. He regained consciousness, and even for some days rallied strength. He might have recovered, but he seemed as if he tacitly refused to live. He expired at last, peacefully, in Graham's arms.  At the opening of his will it was found that he had left Graham his sole heir and executor.  Deducting government duties, legacies to servants, and donations to public charities, the sum thus bequeathed to his lost wife's nephew was two hundred and twenty thousand pounds.  With such a fortune, opening indeed was made for an ambition so long obstructed.  But Graham affected no change in his mode of life; he still retained his modest bachelor's apartments, engaged no servants, bought no horses, in no way exceeded the income he had posesssed"]]]
