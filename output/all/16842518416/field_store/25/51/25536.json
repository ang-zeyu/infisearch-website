He seemed, indeed, depressed rather than elated by the succession to a wealth which he had never anticipated.  Two children had been born from the marriage of Richard King: they had died young, it is true, but Lady Janet at the time of her own decease was not too advanced in years for the reasonable expectation of other offspring; and even after Richard King became a widower, he had given to Graham no hint of his testamentary dispositions.  The young man was no blood-relation to him, and naturally supposed that such relations would become the heirs.  But in truth the deceased seemed to have no blood- relations: none had ever been known to visit him; none raised a voice to question the justice of his will.  Lady Janet had been buried at Kensal Green; her husband's remains were placed in the same vault.  For days and days Graham went his way lonelily to the cemetery.  He might be seen standing motionless by that tomb, with tears rolling down his cheeks; yet his was not a weak nature,--not one of those that love indulgence of irremediable grief.  On the contrary, people who did not know him well said \"that he had more head than heart,\" and the character of his pursuits, as of his writings, was certainly not that of a sentimentalist.  He had not thus visited the tomb till Richard King had been placed within it.  Yet his love for his aunt was unspeakably greater than that which he could have felt for her husband.  Was it, then, the husband that he so much more acutely mourned; or was there something that, since the husband's death, had deepened his reverence for the memory of her whom he had not only loved as a mother, but honoured as a saint?  These visits to the cemetery did not cease till Graham was confined to his bed by a very grave illness,--the only one he had ever known.  His physician said it was nervous fever, and occasioned by moral shock or excitement; it was attended with delirium.  His recovery was slow, and when it was sufficiently completed he quitted England; and we find him now, with his mind composed, his strength restored, and his spirits braced, in that gay city of Paris; hiding, perhaps, some earnest purpose amid his participation in its holiday enjoyments.  He is now, as I have said, seated before his writing-table in deep thought.  He takes up a letter which he had already glanced over hastily, and reperuses it with more care.  The letter is from his cousin, the Duke of Alton, who had succeeded a few years since to the family honours,--an able man, with no small degree of information, an ardent politician, but of very rational and temperate opinions; too much occupied by the cares of a princely estate to covet office for himself; too sincere a patriot not to desire office for those to whose hands he thought the country might be most safely entrusted; an intimate friend of Graham's.  The contents of the letter are these:--       MY DEAR GRAHAM,--I trust that you will welcome the brilliant opening      into public life which these lines are intended to announce to you.      Vavasour has just been with me to say that he intends to resign his      seat for the county when Parliament meets, and agreeing with me that      there is no one so fit to succeed him as yourself, he suggests the      keeping his intention secret until you have arranged your committee      and are prepared to take the field.  You cannot hope to escape a      contest; but I have examined the Register, and the party has gained      rather than lost since the last election, when Vavasour was so      triumphantly returned.  The expenses for this county, where there      are so many outvoters to bring up, and so many agents to retain, are      always large in comparison with some other counties; but that      consideration is all in your favour, for it deters Squire Hunston,      the only man who could beat you, from starting; and to your      resources a thousand pounds more or less are a trifle not worth      discussing.  You know how difficult it is nowadays to find a seat      for a man of moderate opinions like yours and mine.  Our county      would exactly suit you.  The constituency is so evenly divided      between the urban and rural populations, that its representative      must fairly consult the interests of both.  He can be neither an      ultra-Tory nor a violent Radical.  He is left to the enviable      freedom, to which you say you aspire, of considering what is best      for the country as a whole.       Do not lose so rare an opportunity.  There is but one drawback to      your triumphant candidature.  It will be said that you have no      longer an acre in the county in which the Vanes have been settled so      long.  That drawback can be removed.  It is true that you can never      hope to buy back the estates which you were compelled to sell at      your father's death: the old manufacturer gripes them too firmly to      loosen his hold; and after all, even were your income double what it      is, you would be overhoused in the vast pile in which your father      buried so large a share of his fortune.  But that beautiful old      hunting-lodge, the Stamm Schloss of your family, with the adjacent      farms, can be now repurchased very reasonably.  The brewer who      bought them is afflicted with an extravagant son, whom he placed in      the--Hussars, and will gladly sell the property for L5,000 more than      he gave: well worth the difference, as he has improved the farm-      buildings and raised the rental.  I think, in addition to the sum      you have on mortgage, L3,000 will be accepted, and as a mere      investment pay you nearly three per cent.  But to you it is worth      more than double the money; it once more identifies your ancient      name with the county.  You would be a greater personage with that      moderate holding in the district in which your race took root, and      on which your father's genius threw such a lustre, than you would be      if you invested all your wealth in a county in which every squire      and farmer would call you \"the new man.\"  Pray think over this most      seriously, and instruct your solicitor to open negotiations with the      brewer at once.  But rather put yourself into the train, and come      back to England straight to me.  I will ask Vavasour to meet you.      What news from Paris?  Is the Emperor as ill as the papers      insinuate?  And is the revolutionary party gaining ground?       Your affectionate cousin,                                     ALTON.  As he put down this letter, Graham heaved a short impatient sigh.  \"The old Stamm Schloss,\" he muttered,--\"a foot on the old soil once more! and an entrance into the great arena with hands unfettered.  Is it possible!--is it?--is it?\"  At this moment the door-bell of the apartment rang, and a servant whom Graham had hired at Paris as a _laquais de place_ announced \"Ce Monsieur.\"  Graham hurried the letter into his portfolio, and said, \"You mean the person to whom I am always at home?\"  \"The same, Monsieur.\"  \"Admit him, of course.\"  There entered a wonderfully thin man, middle-aged, clothed in black, his face cleanly shaven, his hair cut very short, with one of those faces which, to use a French expression, say \"nothing.\"  It was absolutely without expression: it had not even, despite its thinness, one salient feature.  If you had found yourself anywhere seated next to that man, your eye would have passed him over as too insignificant to notice; if at a cafe, you would have gone on talking to your friend without lowering your voice.  What mattered it whether a _bete_ like that overheard or not?  Had you been asked to guess his calling and station, you might have said, minutely observing the freshness of his clothes and the undeniable respectability of his _tout ensemble_, \"He must be well off, and with no care for customers on his mind,--a ci-devant chandler who has retired on a legacy.\"  Graham rose at the entrance of his visitor, motioned him courteously to a seat beside him, and waiting till the _laquais_ had vanished, then asked, \"What news?\"  \"None, I fear, that will satisfy Monsieur.  I have certainly hunted out, since I had last the honour to see you, no less than four ladies of the name of Duval, but only one of them took that name from her parents, and was also christened Louise.\"  \"Ah--Louise!\"  \"Yes, the daughter of a perfumer, aged twenty-eight.  She, therefore, is not the Louise you seek.  Permit me to refer to your instructions.\"  Here M. Renard took out a note-book, turned over the leaves, and resumed, \"Wanted, Louise Duval, daughter of Auguste Duval, a French drawing- master, who lived for many years at Tours, removed to Paris in 1845, lived at No. 12, Rue de S---- at Paris for some years, but afterwards moved to a different guartier of the town, and died 1848, in Rue I----, No. 39.  Shortly after his death, his daughter Louise left that lodging, and could not be traced.  In 1849 official documents reporting her death were forwarded from Munich to a person (a friend of yours, Monsieur). Death, of course, taken for granted; but nearly five years afterwards, this very person encountered the said Louise Duval at Aix-la-Chapelle, and never heard nor saw more of her.  Demande submitted, to find out said Louise Duval or any children of hers born in 1848-9; supposed in 1852-3 to have one child, a girl, between four and five years old.  Is that right, Monsieur?\"  \"Quite right.\"  \"And this is the whole information given to me.  Monsieur on giving it asked me if I thought it desirable that he should commence inquiries at Aix-la-Chapelle, where Louise Duval was last seen by the person interested to discover her.  I reply, No; pains thrown away.  Aix-la- Chapelle is not a place where any Frenchwoman not settled there by marriage would remain.  Nor does it seem probable that the said Duval would venture to select for her residence Munich, a city in which she had contrived to obtain"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7738"],["title","The Parisians — Volume 02 (#3)"],["body","of her death.  A Frenchwoman who has once known Paris always wants to get back to it; especially, Monsieur, if she has the beauty which you assign to this lady.  I therefore suggested that our inquiries should commence in this capital.  Monsieur agreed with me, and I did not grudge the time necessary for investigation.\"  \"You were most obliging.  Still I am beginning to be impatient if time is to be thrown away.\"  \"Naturally.  Permit me to return to my notes.  Monsieur informs me that twenty-one years ago, in 1848, the Parisian police were instructed to find out this lady and failed, but gave hopes of discovering her through her relations.  He asks me to refer to our archives; I tell him that is no use.  However, in order to oblige him, I do so.  No trace of such inquiry: it must have been, as Monsieur led me to suppose, a strictly private one, unconnected with crime or with politics; and as I have the honour to tell Monsieur, no record of such investigations is preserved in our office.  Great scandal would there be, and injury to the peace of families, if we preserved the results of private inquiries intrusted to us--by absurdly jealous husbands, for instance.  Honour,--Monsieur, honour forbids it.  Next I suggest to Monsieur that his simplest plan would be an advertisement in the French journals, stating, if I understand him right, that it is for the pecuniary interest of Madame or Mademoiselle Duval, daughter of Auguste Duval, _artiste en dessin_, to come forward.  Monsieur objects to that.\"  \"I object to it extremely; as I have told you, this is a strictly confidential inquiry; and an advertisement which in all likelihood would be practically useless (it proved to be so in a former inquiry) would not be resorted to unless all else failed, and even then with reluctance.\"  \"Quite so.  Accordingly, Monsieur delegates to me, who have been recommended to him as the best person he can employ in that department of our police which is not connected with crime or political surveillance, a task the most difficult.  I have, through strictly private investigations, to discover the address and prove the identity of a lady bearing a name among the most common in France, and of whom nothing has been heard for fifteen years, and then at so migratory an _endroit_ as Aix-la-Chapelle.  You will not or cannot inform me if since that time the lady has changed her name by marriage.\"  \"I have no reason to think that she has; and there are reasons against the supposition that she married after 1849.\"  \"Permit me to observe that the more details of information Monsieur can give me, the easier my task of research will be.\"  \"I have given you all the details I can, and, aware of the difficulty of tracing a person with a name so much the reverse of singular, I adopted your advice in our first interview, of asking some Parisian friend of mine, with a large acquaintance in the miscellaneous societies of your capital, to inform me of any ladies of that name whom he might chance to encounter; and he, like you, has lighted upon one or two, who alas! resemble the right one in name and nothing more.\"  \"You will do wisely to keep him on the watch as well as myself.  If it were but a murderess or a political incendiary, then you might trust exclusively to the enlightenment of our corps, but this seems an affair of sentiment, Monsieur.  Sentiment is not in our way.  Seek the trace of that in the haunts of pleasure.\"  M. Renard, having thus poetically delivered himself of that philosophical dogma, rose to depart.  Graham slipped into his hand a bank-note of sufficient value to justify the profound bow he received in return.  When M. Renard had gone, Graham heaved another impatient sigh, and said to himself, \"No, it is not possible,--at least not yet.\"  Then, compressing his lips as a man who forces himself to something he dislikes, he dipped his pen into the inkstand, and wrote rapidly thus to his kinsman:       MY DEAR COUSIN,--I lose not a post in replying to your kind and      considerate letter.  It is not in my power at present to return to      England.  I need not say how fondly I cherish the hope of      representing the dear old county some day.  If Vavasour could be      induced to defer his resignation of the seat for another session, or      at least for six or seven months, why then I might be free to avail      myself of the opening; at present I am not.  Meanwhile I am sorely      tempted to buy back the old Lodge; probably the brewer would allow      me to leave on mortgage the sum I myself have on the property, and a      few additional thousands.  I have reasons for not wishing to      transfer at present much of the money now invested in the Funds.  I      will consider this point, which probably does not press.       I reserve all Paris news till my next; and begging you to forgive so      curt and unsatisfactory a reply to a letter so important that it      excites me more than I like to own, believe me your affectionate      friend and cousin,                                GRAHAM.     CHAPTER II.  AT about the same hour on the same day in which the Englishman held the conference with the Parisian detective just related, the Marquis de Rochebriant found himself by appointment in the _cabinet d'affaires_ of his _avoue_ M. Gandrin that gentleman had hitherto not found time to give him a definite opinion as to the case submitted to his judgment.  The _avoue_ received Alain with a kind of forced civility, in which the natural intelligence of the Marquis, despite his inexperience of life, discovered embarrassment.  \"Monsieur le Marquis,\" said Gandrin, fidgeting among the papers on his bureau, \"this is a very complicated business.  I have given not only my best attention to it, but to your general interests.  To be plain, your estate, though a fine one, is fearfully encumbered--fearfully-- frightfully.\"  \"Sir,\" said the Marquis, haughtily, \"that is a fact which was never disguised from you.\"  \"I do not say that it was, Marquis; but I scarcely realized the amount of the liabilities nor the nature of the property.  It will be difficult-- nay, I fear, impossible--to find any capitalist to advance a sum that will cover the mortgages at an interest less than you now pay.  As for a Company to take the whole trouble off your hands, clear off the mortgages, manage the forests, develop the fisheries, guarantee you an adequate income, and at the end of twenty-one years or so render up to you or your heirs the free enjoyment of an estate thus improved, we must dismiss that prospect as a wild dream of my good friend M. Hebert. People in the provinces do dream; in Paris everybody is wide awake.\"  \"Monsieur,\" said the Marquis, with that inborn imperturbable loftiness of _sang froid_ which has always in adverse circumstances characterized the French noblesse, \"be kind enough to restore my papers.  I see that you are not the man for me.  Allow me only to thank you, and inquire the amount of my debt for the trouble I have given.\"  \"Perhaps you are quite justified in thinking I am not the man for you, Monsieur le Marquis; and your papers shall, if you decide on dismissing me, be returned to you this evening.  But as to my accepting remuneration where I have rendered no service, I request M. le Marquis to put that out of the question.  Considering myself, then, no longer your _avoue_, do not think I take too great a liberty in volunteering my counsel as a friend,--or a friend at least to M. Hebert, if you do not vouchsafe my right so to address yourself.\"  M. Gandrin spoke with a certain dignity of voice and manner which touched and softened his listener.  \"You make me your debtor far more than I pretend to repay,\" replied Alain.  \"Heaven knows I want a friend, and I will heed with gratitude and respect all your counsels in that character.\"  \"Plainly and briefly, my advice is this: M. Louvier is the principal mortgagee.  He is among the six richest capitalists of Paris.  He does not, therefore, want money, but, like most self-made men, he is very accessible to social vanities.  He would be proud to think he had rendered a service to a Rochebriant.  Approach him, either through me, or, far better, at once introduce yourself, and propose to consolidate all your other liabilities in one mortgage to him, at a rate of interest lower than that which is now paid to some of the small mortgagees.  This would add considerably to your income and would carry out M. Hebert's advice.\"  \"But does it not strike you, dear M. Gandrin, that such going cap-in-hand to one who has power over my fate, while I have none over his, would scarcely be consistent with my self-respect, not as Rochebriant only, but as Frenchman?\"  \"It does not strike me so in the least; at all events, I could make the proposal on your behalf, without compromising yourself, though I should be far more sanguine of success if you addressed M. Louvier in person.\"  \"I should nevertheless prefer leaving it in your hands; but even for that I must take a few days to consider.  Of all the mortgagees M. Louvier has been hitherto the severest and most menacing, the one whom Hebert dreads the most; and should he become sole mortgagee, my whole estate would pass to him if, through any succession of bad seasons and failing tenants, the interest was not punctually paid.\"  \"It could so pass to him now.\"  \"No; for there have been years in which the other mortgagees, who are Bretons and would be loath to ruin a Rochebriant, have been lenient and patient.\"  \"If Louvier has not been equally so, it is only because he knew nothing of you, and your father no doubt had often sorely tasked his endurance. Come, suppose we manage to break the ice easily.  Do me the honour to dine here to meet him; you will find that he is not an unpleasant man.\"  The Marquis hesitated, but the thought of the sharp and seemingly hopeless struggle for the retention of his ancestral home to which he would be doomed if he returned"]]]
