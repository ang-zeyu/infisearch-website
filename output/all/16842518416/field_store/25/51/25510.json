Unconscious of the formidable dispositions of their neighbours, Sibyll and Warner were inhaling the sweet air of the early spring in their little garden.  His disgrace had affected the philosopher less than might be supposed.  True, that the loss of the king's favour was the deferring indefinitely--perhaps for life--any practical application of his adored theory; and yet, somehow or other, the theory itself consoled him.  At the worst, he should find some disciple, some ingenious student, more fortunate than himself, to whom he could bequeath the secret, and who, when Adam was in his grave, would teach the world to revere his name.  Meanwhile, his time was his own; he was lord of a home, though ruined and desolate; he was free, with his free thoughts; and therefore, as he paced the narrow garden, his step was lighter, his mind less absent than when parched with feverish fear and hope for the immediate practical success of a principle which was to be tried before the hazardous tribunal of prejudice and ignorance.  \"My child,\" said the sage, \"I feel, for the first time for years, the distinction of the seasons.  I feel that we are walking in the pleasant spring.  Young days come back to me like dreams; and I could almost think thy mother were once more by my side!\"  Sibyll pressed her father's hand, and a soft but melancholy sigh stirred her rosy lips.  She, too, felt the balm of the young year; yet her father's words broke upon sad and anxious musings.  Not to youth as to age, not to loving fancy as to baffled wisdom, has seclusion charms that compensate for the passionate and active world!  On coming back to the old house, on glancing round its mildewed walls, comfortless and bare, the neglected, weed-grown garden, Sibyll had shuddered in dismay.  Had her ambition fallen again into its old abject state?  Were all her hopes to restore her ancestral fortunes, to vindicate her dear father's fame, shrunk into this slough of actual poverty,--the butterfly's wings folded back into the chrysalis shroud of torpor?  The vast disparity between herself and Hastings had not struck her so forcibly at the court; here, at home, the very walls proclaimed it.  When Edward had dismissed the unwelcome witnesses of his attempted crime, he had given orders that they should be conducted to their house through the most private ways.  He naturally desired to create no curious comment upon their departure.  Unperceived by their neighbours, Sibyll and her father had gained access by the garden gate.  Old Madge received them in dismay; for she had been in the habit of visiting Sibyll weekly at the palace, and had gained, in the old familiarity subsisting, then, between maiden and nurse, some insight into her heart.  She had cherished the fondest hopes for the fate of her young mistress; and now, to labour and to penury had the fate returned!  The guard who accompanied them, according to Edward's orders, left some pieces of gold, which Adam rejected, but Madge secretly received and judiciously expended.  And this was all their wealth.  But not of toil nor of penury in themselves thought Sibyll; she thought but of Hastings,--wildly, passionately, trustfully, unceasingly, of the absent Hastings.  Oh, he would seek her, he would come, her reverse would but the more endear her to him!  Hastings came not.  She soon learned the wherefore.  War threatened the land,--he was at his post, at the head of armies.  Oh, with what panoply of prayer she sought to shield that beloved breast!  And now the old man spoke of the blessed spring, the holiday time of lovers and of love, and the young girl, sighing, said to her mournful heart, \"The world hath its sun,--where is mine?\"  The peacock strutted up to his poor protectors, and spread his plumes to the gilding beams.  And then Sibyll recalled the day when she had walked in that spot with Marmaduke, and he had talked of his youth, ambition, and lusty hopes, while, silent and absorbed, she had thought within herself, \"Could the world be open to me as to him,--I too have ambition, and it should find its goal.\"  Now what contrast between the two,--the man enriched and honoured, if to-day in peril or in exile, to-morrow free to march forward still on his career, the world the country to him whose heart was bold and whose name was stainless! and she, the woman, brought back to the prison-home, scorn around her, impotent to avenge, and forbidden to fly!  Wherefore?--Sibyll felt her superiority of mind, of thought, of nature,--wherefore the contrast? The success was that of man, the discomfiture that of woman.  Woe to the man who precedes his age; but never yet has an age been in which genius and ambition are safe to woman!  The father and the child turned into their house.  The day was declining.  Adam mounted to his studious chamber, Sibyll sought the solitary servant.  \"What tidings, oh, what tidings?  The war, you say, is over; the great earl, his sweet daughter, safe upon the seas, but Hastings--ob, Hastings! what of him?\"  \"My bonnibell, my lady-bird, I have none but good tales to tell thee. I saw and spoke with a soldier who served under Lord Hastings himself; he is unscathed, he is in London.  But they say that one of his bands is quartered in the suburb, and that there is a report of a rising in Hertfordshire.\"  \"When will peace come to England and to me!\" sighed Sibyll.     CHAPTER IV.  THE WORLD'S JUSTICE, AND THE WISDOM OF OUR ANCESTORS.  The night had now commenced, and Sibyll was still listening--or, perhaps, listening not--to the soothing babble of the venerable servant.  They were both seated in the little room that adjoined the hall, and their only light came through the door opening on the garden,--a gray, indistinct twilight, relieved by the few earliest stars.  The peacock, his head under his wing, roosted on the balustrade, and the song of the nightingale, from amidst one of the neighbouring copses, which studded the ground towards the chase of Marybone, came soft and distant on the serene air.  The balm and freshness of spring were felt in the dews, in the skies, in the sweet breath of young herb and leaf; through the calm of ever-watchful nature, it seemed as if you might mark, distinct and visible, minute after minute, the blessed growth of April into May.  Suddenly Madge uttered a cry of alarm, and pointed towards the opposite wall.  Sibyll, startled from her revery, looked up, and saw something dusk and dwarf-like perched upon the crumbling eminence. Presently this apparition leaped lightly into the garden, and the alarm of the women was lessened on seeing a young boy creep stealthily over the grass and approach the open door.  \"Hey, child!\" said Madge, rising.  \"What wantest thou?\"  \"Hist, gammer, hist!  Ah, the young mistress?  That's well.  Hist!  I say again.\"  The boy entered the room.  \"I'm in time to save you.  In half an hour your house will be broken into, perhaps burned.  The boys are clapping their hands now at the thoughts of the bonfire.  Father and all the neighbours are getting ready.  Hark! hark!  No, it is only the wind!  The tymbesteres are to give note.  When you hear their bells tinkle, the mob will meet.  Run for your lives, you and the old man, and don't ever say it was poor Tim who told you this, for Father would beat me to death.  Ye can still get through the garden into the fields.  Quick!\"  \"I will go to the master,\" exclaimed Madge, hurrying from the room.  The child caught Sibyll's cold hand through the dark.  \"And I say, mistress, if his worship is a wizard, don't let him punish Father and Mother, or poor Tim, or his little sister; though Tim was once naughty, and hooted Master Warner.  Many, many, many a time and oft have I seen that kind, mild face in my sleep, just as when it bent over me, while I kicked and screamed, and the poor gentleman said, 'Thinkest thou I would harm thee?'  But he'll forgive me now, will he not?  And when I turned the seething water over myself, and they said it was all along of the wizard, my heart pained more than the arm. But they whip me, and groan out that the devil is in me, if I don't say that the kettle upset of itself!  Oh, those tymbesteres! Mistress, did you ever see them?  They fright me.  If you could hear how they set on all the neighbours!  And their laugh--it makes the hair stand on end!  But you will get away, and thank Tim too?  Oh, I shall laugh then, when they find the old house empty!\"  \"May our dear Lord bless thee--bless thee, child,\" sobbed Sibyll, clasping the boy in her arms, and kissing him, while her tears bathed his cheeks.  A light gleamed on the threshold; Madge, holding a candle, appeared with Warner, his hat and cloak thrown on in haste.  \"What is this?\" said the poor scholar.  \"Can it be true?  Is mankind so cruel?  What have I done, woe is me! what have I done to deserve this?\"  \"Come, dear father, quick,\" said Sibyll, drying her tears, and wakened by the presence of the old man into energy and courage.  \"But put thy hand on this boy's head, and bless him; for it is he who has, haply, saved us.\"  The boy trembled a moment as the long-bearded face turned towards him, but when he caught and recognized those meek, sweet eyes, his superstition vanished, and it was but a holy and grateful awe that thrilled his young blood, as the old man placed both withered hands over his yellow hair, and murmured,--  \"God shield thy youth!  God make thy manhood worthy!  God give thee children in thine old age with hearts like thine!\"  Scarcely had the prayer ceased when the clash of timbrels, with their jingling bells, was heard in the street.  Once, twice, again, and a fierce yell closed in chorus,--caught up and echoed from corner to corner, from house to house.  \"Run! run!\" cried the boy, turning white with terror.  \"But the Eureka--my hope--my mind's child!\" exclaimed Adam, suddenly, and halting at the door.  \"Eh, eh!\" said Madge, pushing him forward.  \"It is"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7723"],["title","The Last of the Barons â€” Volume 09 (#5)"],["body"," heavy to move; thou couldst not lift it.  Think of thine own flesh and blood, of thy daughter, of her dead mother!  Save her life, if thou carest not for thine own!\"  \"Go, Sibyll, go, and thou, Madge; I will stay.  What matters my life, --it is but the servant of a thought!  Perish master, perish slave!\"  \"Father, unless you come with me, I stir not.  Fly or perish, your fate is mine!  Another minute--Oh, Heaven of mercy, that roar again! We are both lost!\"  \"Go, sir, go; they care not for your iron,--iron cannot feel.  They will not touch that!  Have not your daughter's life upon your soul!\"  \"Sibyll, Sibyll, forgive me!  Come!\" said Warner, conscience-stricken at the appeal.  Madge and the boy ran forwards; the old woman unbarred the garden- gate; Sibyll and her father went forth; the fields stretched before them calm and solitary; the boy leaped up, kissed Sibyll's pale cheek, and then bounded across the grass, and vanished.  \"Loiter not, Madge.  Come!\" cried Sibyll.  \"Nay,\" said the old woman, shrinking back, \"they bear no grudge to me; I am too old to do aught but burthen ye.  I will stay, and perchance save the house and the chattels, and poor master's deft contrivance. Whist! thou knowest his heart would break if none were by to guard it.\"  With that the faithful servant thrust the broad pieces that yet remained of the king's gift into the gipsire Sibyll wore at her girdle, and then closed and rebarred the door before they could detain her.  \"It is base to leave her,\" said the scholar-gentleman.  The noble Sibyll could not refute her father.  Afar they heard the tramping of feet; suddenly, a dark red light shot up into the blue air, a light from the flame of many torches.  \"The wizard, the wizard!  Death to the wizard, who would starve the poor!\" yelled forth, and was echoed by a stern hurrah.  Adam stood motionless, Sibyll by his side.  \"The wizard and his daughter!\" shrieked a sharp single voice, the voice of Graul the tymbestere.  Adam turned.  \"Fly, my child,--they now threaten thee.  Come, come, come!\" and, taking her by the hand, he hurried her across the fields, skirting the hedge, their shadows dodging, irregular and quaint, on the starlit sward.  The father had lost all thought, all care but for the daughter's life.  They paused at last, out of breath and exhausted: the sounds at the distance were lulled and hushed.  They looked towards the direction of the home they had abandoned, expecting to see the flames destined to consume it reddening the sky; but all was dark,--or, rather, no light save the holy stars and the rising moon offended the majestic heaven.  \"They cannot harm the poor old woman; she hath no lore.  On her gray hairs has fallen not the curse of men's hate!\" said Warner.  \"Right, Father! when they found us flown, doubtless the cruel ones dispersed.  But they may search yet for thee.  Lean on me, I am strong and young.  Another effort, and we gain the safe coverts of the Chase.\"  While yet the last word hung on her lips, they saw, on the path they had left, the burst of torch-light, and heard the mob hounding on their track.  But the thick copses, with their pale green just budding into life, were at hand.  On they fled.  The deer started from amidst the entangled fern, but stood and gazed at them without fear; the playful hares in the green alleys ceased not their nightly sports at the harmless footsteps; and when at last, in the dense thicket, they sunk down on the mossy roots of a giant oak, the nightingales overhead chanted as if in melancholy welcome.  They were saved!  But in their home, fierce fires glared amidst the tossing torch-light; the crowd, baffled by the strength of the door, scaled the wall, broke through the lattice-work of the hall window, and streaming through room after room, roared forth, \"Death to the wizard!\"  Amidst the sordid dresses of the men, the soiled and faded tinsel of the tymbesteres gleamed and sparkled.  It was a scene the she-fiends revelled in,--dear are outrage and malice, and the excitement of turbulent passions, and the savage voices of frantic men, and the thirst of blood to those everlasting furies of a mob, under whatever name we know them, in whatever time they taint with their presence,-- women in whom womanhood is blasted!  Door after door was burst open with cries of disappointed rage; at last they ascended the turret-stairs, they found a small door barred and locked.  Tim's father, a huge axe in his brawny arm, shivered the panels; the crowd rushed in, and there, seated amongst a strange and motley litter, they found the devoted Madge.  The poor old woman had collected into this place, as the stronghold of the mansion, whatever portable articles seemed to her most precious, either from value or association.  Sibyll's gittern (Marmaduke's gift) lay amidst a lumber of tools and implements; a faded robe of her dead mother's, treasured by Madge and Sibyll both, as a relic of holy love; a few platters and cups of pewter, the pride of old Madge's heart to keep bright and clean; odds and ends of old hangings; a battered silver brooch (a love-gift to Madge herself when she was young),--these, and suchlike scraps of finery, hoards inestimable to the household memory and affection, lay confusedly heaped around the huge grim model, before which, mute and tranquil, sat the brave old woman.  The crowd halted, and stared round in superstitious terror and dumb marvel.  The leader of the tymbesteres sprang forward.  \"Where is thy master, old hag, and where the bonny maid who glamours lords, and despises us bold lasses?\"  \"Alack! master and the damsel have gone hours ago!  I am alone in the house; what's your will?\"  \"The crone looks parlous witchlike!\" said Tim's father; crossing himself, and somewhat retreating from her gray, unquiet eyes.  And, indeed, poor Madge, with her wrinkled face, bony form, and high cap, corresponded far more with the vulgar notions of a dabbler in the black art than did Adam Warner, with his comely countenance and noble mien.  \"So she doth, indeed, and verily,\" said a hump-backed tinker; \"if we were to try a dip in the horsepool yonder it could do no harm.\"  \"Away with her, away!\" cried several voices at that humane suggestion.  \"Nay, nay,\" quoth the baker, \"she is a douce creature after all, and hath dealt with me many years.  I don't care what becomes of the wizard,--every one knows,\" he added with pride, \"that I was one of the first to set fire to his house when Robin gainsayed it! but right's right--burn the master, not the drudge!\"  This intercession might have prevailed, but unhappily, at that moment Graul Skellet, who had secured two stout fellows to accomplish the object so desired by Friar Bungey, laid hands on the model, and, at her shrill command, the men advanced and dislodged it from its place. At the same tine the other tymbesteres, caught by the sight of things pleasing to their wonted tastes, threw themselves, one upon the faded robe Sibyll's mother had worn in her chaste and happy youth; another, upon poor Madge's silver brooch; a third, upon the gittern.  These various attacks roused up all the spirit and wrath of the old woman: her cries of distress as she darted from one to the other, striking to the right and left with her feeble arms, her form trembling with passion, were at once ludicrous and piteous; and these were responded to by the shrill exclamations of the fierce tymbesteres, as they retorted scratch for scratch, and blow for blow. The spectators grew animated by the sight of actual outrage and resistance; the humpbacked tinker, whose unwholesome fancy one of the aggrieved tymbesteres had mightily warmed, hastened to the relief of his virago; and rendered furious by finding ten nails fastened suddenly on his face, he struck down the poor creature by a blow that stunned her, seized her in his arms,--for deformed and weakly as the tinker was, the old woman, now sense and spirit were gone, was as light as skin and bone could be,--and followed by half a score of his comrades, whooping and laughing, bore her down the stairs.  Tim's father, who, whether from parental affection, or, as is more probable, from the jealous hatred and prejudice of ignorant industry, was bent upon Adam's destruction, hallooed on some of his fierce fellows into the garden, tracked the footsteps of the fugitives by the trampled grass, and bounded over the wall in fruitless chase.  But on went the more giddy of the mob, rather in sport than in cruelty, with a chorus of drunken apprentices and riotous boys, to the spot where the humpbacked tinker had dragged his passive burden.  The foul green pond near Master Sancroft's hostel reflected the glare of torches; six of the tymbesteres, leaping and wheeling, with doggerel song and discordant music, gave the signal for the ordeal of the witch,--      \"Lake or river, dyke or ditch,      Water never drowns the witch.      Witch or wizard would ye know?      Sink or swim, is ay or no.      Lift her, swing her, once and twice,        Lift her, swing her o'er the brim,--      Lille--lera--twice and thrice        Ha! ha! mother, sink or swim!\"  And while the last line was chanted, amidst the full jollity of laughter and clamour and clattering timbrels, there was a splash in the sullen water; the green slough on the surface parted with an oozing gurgle, and then came a dead silence.  \"A murrain on the hag! she does not even struggle!\" said, at last, the hump-backed tinker.  \"No,--no! she cares not for water.  Try fire!  Out with her! out!\" cried Red Grisell.  \"Aroint her! she is sullen!\" said the tinker, as his lean fingers clutched up the dead body, and let it fall upon the margin.  \"Dead!\" said the baker, shuddering; \"we have done wrong,--I told ye so!  She dealt with me many a year.  Poor Madge!  Right's right.  She was no witch!\"  \"But that was the only way to try it,\" said the humpbacked tinker; \"and if she was not a witch, why did she look like one?  I cannot abide ugly folks!\" "]]]
