Thinkest thou that but for this I could--\" She stopped, but Hastings divined her thought, and guessed that, if spoken, it had run thus: \"That I could, even now, have received the homage of one who departs to meet, with banner and clarion, my brother as his foe?\"  The lovely sweetness of the late expression had gone from Katherine's face, and its aspect showed that her high and ancestral spirit had yielded but to one passion.  She pursued,--  \"While this strife lasts, it becomes my widowhood and kindred position with the earl to retire to the convent my mother founded.  To-morrow I depart.\"  \"Alas!\" said Hastings, \"thou speakest of the strife as if but a single field.  But Warwick returns not to these shores, nor bows himself to league with Lancaster, for a chance hazardous and desperate, as Edward too rashly deems it.  It is in vain to deny that the earl is prepared for a grave and lengthened war, and much I doubt whether Edward can resist his power; for the idolatry of the very land will swell the ranks of so dread a rebel.  What if he succeed; what if we be driven into exile, as Henry's friends before us; what if the king-maker be the king-dethroner?  Then, Katherine, then once more thou wilt be at the best of thy hostile kindred, and once more, dowered as thou art, and thy womanhood still in its richest bloom, thy hand will be lost to Hastings.\"  \"Nay, if that be all thy fear, take with thee this pledge,--that Warwick's treason to the House for which my father fell dissolves his power over one driven to disown him as a brother,--knowing Earl Salisbury, had he foreseen such disgrace, had disowned him as a son. And if there be defeat and flight and exile, wherever thou wanderest, Hastings, shall Katherine be found beside thee.  Fare thee well, and Our Lady shield thee! may thy lance be victorious against all foes,-- save one.  Thou wilt forbear my--that is, the earl!\"  And Katherine, softened at that thought, sobbed aloud.  \"And come triumph or defeat, I have thy pledge?\" said Hastings, soothing her.  \"See,\" said Katherine, taking the broken ring from the casket; \"now, for the first time since I bore the name of Bonville, I lay this relic on my heart; art thou answered?\"     CHAPTER VI.  HASTINGS LEARNS WHAT HAS BEFALLEN SIBYLL, REPAIRS TO THE KING, AND ENCOUNTERS AN OLD RIVAL.  \"It is destiny,\" said Hastings to himself, when early the next morning he was on his road to the farm--\"it is destiny,--and who can resist his fate?\"  \"It is destiny!\"--phrase of the weak human heart!  \"It is destiny!\" dark apology for every error!  The strong and the virtuous admit no destiny!  On earth guides conscience, in heaven watches God.  And destiny is but the phantom we invoke to silence the one, to dethrone the other!  Hastings spared not his good steed.  With great difficulty had he snatched a brief respite from imperious business, to accomplish the last poor duty now left to him to fulfil,--to confront the maid whose heart he had seduced in vain, and say at length, honestly and firmly, \"I cannot wed thee.  Forget me, and farewell.\"  Doubtless his learned and ingenious mind conjured up softer words than these, and more purfled periods wherein to dress the iron truth.  But in these two sentences the truth lay.  He arrived at the farm, he entered the house; he felt it as a reprieve that he met not the bounding step of the welcoming Sibyll.  He sat down in the humble chamber, and waited a while in patience,--no voice was heard.  The silence at length surprised and alarmed him.  He proceeded farther. He was met by the widowed owner of the house, who was weeping; and her first greeting prepared him for what had chanced.  \"Oh, my lord, you have come to tell me they are safe, they have not fallen into the hands of their enemies,--the good gentleman, so meek, the poor lady, so fair!\"  Hastings stood aghast; a few sentences more explained all that he already guessed.  A strange man had arrived the evening before at the house, praying Adam and his daughter to accompany him to the Lord Hastings, who had been thrown from his horse, and was now in a cottage in the neighbouring lane,--not hurt dangerously, but unable to be removed, and who had urgent matters to communicate.  Not questioning the truth of this story, Adam and Sibyll had hurried forth, and returned no more.  Alarmed by their long absence, the widow, who at first received the message from the stranger, went herself to the cottage, and found that the story was a fable.  Every search had since been made for Adam and his daughter, but in vain.  The widow, confirmed in her previous belief that her lodgers had been attainted Lancastrians, could but suppose that they had been thus betrayed to their enemies.  Hastings heard this with a dismay and remorse impossible to express.  His only conjecture was that the king had discovered their retreat, and taken this measure to break off the intercourse he had so sternly denounced.  Full of these ideas, he hastily remounted, and stopped not till once more at the gates of the Tower.  Hastening to Edward's closet, the moment he saw the king, he exclaimed, in great emotion, \"My liege, my liege, do not at this hour, when I have need of my whole energy to serve thee, do not madden my brain, and palsy my arm.  This old man--the poor maid--Sibyll-- Warner,--speak, my liege--only tell me they are safe; promise me they shall go free, and I swear to obey thee in all else!  I will thank thee in the battlefield!\"  \"Thou art mad, Hastings!\" said the king, in great astonishment. \"Hush!\" and he glanced significantly at a person who stood before several heaps of gold, ranged upon a table in the recess of the room. \"See,\" he whispered, \"yonder is the goldsmith, who hath brought me a loan from himself and his fellows!  Pretty tales for the city thy folly will send abroad!\"  But before Hastings could vent his impatient answer, this person, to Edward's still greater surprise, had advanced from his place, and forgetting all ceremony, had seized Hastings by the hem of his surcoat, exclaiming,--  \"My lord, my lord, what new horror is this?  Sibyll!--methought she was worthless, and had fled to thee!\"  \"Ten thousand devils!\" shouted the king, \"am I ever to be tormented by that damnable wizard and his witch child?  And is it, Sir Peer and Sir Goldsmith, in your king's closet that ye come, the very eve before he marches to battle, to speer and glower at each other like two madmen as ye are?\"  Neither peer nor goldsmith gave way, till the courtier, naturally recovering himself the first, fell on his knee; and said, with firm though profound respect: \"Sire, if poor William Hastings has ever merited from the king one kindly thought, one generous word, forgive now whatever may displease thee in his passion or his suit, and tell him what prison contains those whom it would forever dishonour his knighthood to know punished and endangered but for his offence.\"  \"My lord,\" answered the king, softened but still surprised, \"think you seriously that I, who but reluctantly in this lovely month leave my green lawns of Shene to save a crown, could have been vexing my brain by stratagems to seize a lass, whom I swear by Saint George I do not envy thee in the least?  If that does not suffice, incredulous dullard, why then take my kingly word, never before passed for so slight an occasion, that I know nothing whatsoever of thy damsel's whereabout nor her pestilent father's,--where they abode of late, where they now be; and, what is more, if any man has usurped his king's right to imprison the king's subjects, find him out, and name his punishment.  Art thou convinced?\"  \"I am, my liege,\" said Hastings.  \"But--\" began the goldsmith.  \"Holloa, you, too, sir!  This is too much!  We have condescended to answer the man who arms three thousand retainers--\"  \"And I, please your Highness, bring you the gold to pay them,\" said the trader, bluntly.  The king bit his lip, and then burst into his usual merry laugh.  \"Thou art in the right, Master Alwyn.  Finish counting the pieces, and then go and consult with my chamberlain,--he must off with the cock- crow; but, since ye seem to understand each other, he shall make thee his lieutenant of search, and I will sign any order he pleases for the recovery of the lost wisdom and the stolen beauty.  Go and calm thyself, Hastings.\"  \"I will attend you presently, my lord,\" said Alwyn, aside, \"in your own apartment.\"  \"Do so,\" said Hastings; and, grateful for the king's consideration, he sought his rooms.  There, indeed, Alwyn soon joined him, and learned from the nobleman what filled him at once with joy and terror. Knowing that Warner and Sibyll had left the Tower, he had surmised that the girl's virtue had at last succumbed; and it delighted him to hear from Lord Hastings, whose word to men was never questionable, the solemn assurance of her unstained chastity.  But he trembled at this mysterious disappearance, and knew not to whom to impute the snare, till the penetration of Hastings suddenly alighted near, at least, to the clew.  \"The Duchess of Bedford,\" said he, \"ever increasing in superstition as danger increases, may have desired to refind so great a scholar and reputed an astrologer and magician; if so, all is safe. On the other hand, her favourite, the friar, ever bore a jealous grudge to poor Adam, and may have sought to abstract him from her grace's search; here there may be molestation to Adam, but surely no danger to Sibyll.  Hark ye, Alwyn, thou lovest the maid more worthily, and--\"  Hastings stopped short; for such is infirm human nature, that, though he had mentally resigned Sibyll forever, he could not yet calmly face the thought of resigning her to a rival.  \"Thou lovest her,\" he renewed, more coldly, \"and to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7724"],["title","The Last of the Barons â€” Volume 10 (#6)"],["body","e, therefore, I may safely trust the search which time and circumstance and a soldier's duty forbid to me.  And believe--oh, believe that I say not this from a passion which may move thy jealousy, but rather with a brother's holy love.  If thou canst but see her safe, and lodged where no danger nor wrong can find her, thou hast no friend in the wide world whose service through life thou mayst command like mine.\"  \"My lord,\" said Alwyn, dryly, \"I want no friends!  Young as I am, I have lived long enough to see that friends follow fortune, but never make it!  I will find this poor maid and her honoured father, if I spend my last groat on the search.  Get me but such an order from the king as may place the law at my control, and awe even her grace of Bedford,--and I promise the rest!\"  Hastings, much relieved, deigned to press the goldsmith's reluctant hand; and, leaving him alone for a few minutes, returned with a warrant from the king, which seemed to Alwyn sufficiently precise and authoritative.  The goldsmith then departed, and first he sought the friar, but found him not at home.  Bungey had taken with him, as was his wont, the keys of his mysterious apartment.  Alwyn then hastened elsewhere, to secure those experienced in such a search, and to head it in person.  At the Tower, the evening was passed in bustle and excitement,--the last preparations for departure.  The queen, who was then far advanced towards her confinement, was, as we before said, to remain at the Tower, which was now strongly manned.  Roused from her wonted apathy by the imminent dangers that awaited Edward, the night was passed by her in tears and prayers, by him in the sound sleep of confident valour.  The next morning departed for the North the several leaders,--Gloucester, Rivers, Hastings, and the king.     CHAPTER VII.  THE LANDING OF LORD WARWICK, AND THE EVENTS THAT ENSUE THEREON.  And Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, \"prepared such a greate navie as lightly hath not been seene before gathered in manner of all nations, which armie laie at the mouth of the Seyne ready to fight with the Earl of Warwick, when he should set out of his harborowe.\" [Hall, p. 282, ed. 1809.]  But the winds fought for the Avenger.  In the night came \"a terrible tempest,\" which scattered the duke's ships \"one from another, so that two of them were not in compagnie together in one place;\" and when the tempest had done its work, it passed away; and the gales were fair, and the heaven was clear, when, the next day, the earl \"halsed up the sayles,\" and came in sight of Dartmouth.  It was not with an army of foreign hirelings that Lord Warwick set forth on his mighty enterprise.  Scanty indeed were the troops he brought from France,--for he had learned from England that \"men so much daily and hourely desired and wished so sore his arrival and return, that almost all men were in harness, looking for his landyng.\" [The popular feeling in favour of the earl is described by Hall, with somewhat more eloquence and vigour than are common with that homely chronicler: \"The absence of the Earle of Warwick made the common people daily more and more to long and bee desirous to have the sight of him, and presently to behold his personage.  For they judged that the sunne was clerely taken from the world when hee was absent.  In such high estimation amongst the people was his name, that neither no one manne they had in so much honour, neither no one persone they so much praised, or to the clouds so highly extolled.  What shall I say? His only name sounded in every song, in the mouth of the common people, and his persone [effigies] was represented with great reverence when publique plaies or open triumphes should bee skewed or set furthe abrode in the stretes,\" etc.  This lively passage, if not too highly coloured, serves to show us the rude saturnalian kind of liberty that existed, even under a king so vindictive as Edward IV. Though an individual might be banged for the jest that he would make his son heir to the crown (namely, the grocer's shop, which bore that sign), yet no tyranny could deal with the sentiment of the masses.  In our own day it would be less safe than in that to make public exhibition \"in plaies and triumphes\" of sympathy with a man attainted as a traitor, and in open rebellion to the crown.]  As his ships neared the coast, and the banner of the Ragged Staff, worked in gold, shone in the sun, the shores swarmed with armed crowds, not to resist but to welcome.  From cliff to cliff, wide and far, blazed rejoicing bonfires; and from cliff to cliff, wide and far, burst the shout, when, first of all his men, bareheaded, but, save the burgonet, in complete mail, the popular hero leaped to shore.  \"When the earl had taken land, he made a proclamation, in the name of King Henry VI., upon high paynes commanding and charging all men apt or able to bear armour, to prepare themselves to fight against Edward, Duke of York, who had untruly usurped the croune and dignity of this realm.\"  [Hall, p. 82.]  And where was Edward?  Afar, following the forces of Fitzhugh and Robin of Redesdale, who by artful retreat drew him farther and farther northward, and left all the other quarters of the kingdom free to send their thousands to the banners of Lancaster and Warwick.  And even as the news of the earl's landing reached the king, it spread also through all the towns of the North; and all the towns of the North were in \"a great rore, and made fires, and sang songs, crying, 'King Henry! King Henry! a Warwicke! a Warwicke!'\"  But his warlike and presumptuous spirit forsook not the chief of that bloody and fatal race,--the line of the English Pelops,--\"bespattered with kindred gore.\"  [Aeschylus: Agamemnon]  A messenger from Burgundy was in his tent when the news reached him.  \"Back to the duke!\" cried Edward; \"tell him to recollect his navy, guard the sea, scour the streams, that the earl shall not escape, nor return to France; for the doings in England, let me alone!  I have ability and puissance to overcome all enemies and rebels in mine own realm.\"  [Hall, p. 283.]  And therewith he raised his camp, abandoned the pursuit of Fitzhugh, summoned Montagu to join him (it being now safer to hold the marquis near him, and near the axe, if his loyalty became suspected), and marched on to meet the earl.  Nor did the earl tarry from the encounter.  His army, swelling as he passed, and as men read his proclamations to reform all grievances and right all wrongs, he pressed on to meet the king, while fast and fast upon Edward's rear came the troops of Fitzhugh and Hilyard, no longer flying but pursuing.  The king was the more anxious to come up to Warwick, inasmuch as he relied greatly upon the treachery of Clarence, either secretly to betray or openly to desert the earl.  And he knew that if he did the latter on the eve of a battle, it could not fail morally to weaken Warwick, and dishearten his army by fear that desertion should prove, as it ever does, the most contagious disease that can afflict a camp.  It is probable, however, that the enthusiasm which had surrounded the earl with volunteers so numerous had far exceeded the anticipations of the inexperienced Clarence, and would have forbid him that opportunity of betraying the earl.  However this be, the rival armies drew nearer and nearer.  The king halted in his rapid march at a small village, and took up his quarters in a fortified house, to which there was no access but by a single bridge.  [Sharon Turner, Comines.]  Edward himself retired for a short time to his couch, for he had need of all his strength in the battle he foresaw; but scarce had he closed his eyes, when Alexander Carlile [Hearne: Fragment], the serjeant of the royal minstrels, followed by Hastings and Rivers (their jealousy laid at rest for a time in the sense of their king's danger), rushed into his room.  \"Arm, sire, arm!--Lord Montagu has thrown off the mask, and rides through thy troops, shouting 'Long live King Henry!'\"  \"Ah, traitor!\" cried the king, leaping from his bed.  \"From Warwick hate was my due, but not from Montagu!  Rivers, help to buckle on my mail.  Hastings, post my body-guard at the bridge.  We will sell our lives dear.\"  Hastings vanished.  Edward had scarcely hurried on his helm, cuirass, and greaves, when Gloucester entered, calm in the midst of peril.  \"Your enemies are marching to seize you, brother.  Hark! behind you rings the cry, 'A Fitzhugh! a Robin! death to the tyrant!'  Hark! in front, 'A Montagu! a Warwick!  Long live King Henry!'  I come to redeem my word,--to share your exile or your death.  Choose either while there is yet time.  Thy choice is mine!\"  And while he spoke, behind, before, came the various cries nearer and nearer.  The lion of March was in the toils.  \"Now, my two-handed sword!\" said Edward.  \"Gloucester, in this weapon learn my choice!\"  But now all the principal barons and captains, still true to the king whose crown was already lost, flocked in a body to the chamber.  They fell on their knees, and with tears implored him to save himself for a happier day.  \"There is yet time to escape,\" said D'Eyncourt, \"to pass the bridge, to gain the seaport!  Think not that a soldier's death will be left thee.  Numbers will suffice to encumber thine arm, to seize thy person.  Live not to be Warwick's prisoner,--shown as a wild beast in its cage to the hooting crowd!\"  \"If not on thyself,\" exclaimed Rivers, \"have pity on these loyal gentlemen, and for the sake of their lives preserve thine own.  What is flight?  Warwick fled!\"  \"True,--and returned!\" added Gloucester.  \"You are right, my lords. Come, sire, we must fly.  Our rights fly not with us, but shall fight for us in absence!\"  The calm WILL of this strange and terrible boy had its effect upon Edward.  He suffered his brother to lead him from the chamber, grinding his teeth in impotent rage.  He mounted his horse, while Rivers held the stirrup, and with some six or"]]]
