Run your finger along the rock here. Do you perceive a seam? Two days ago, after seeing what you have just witnessed in the Syx tunnel, I carefully cut out a section of the wall, making an aperture large enough to crawl through, and, when I knew the workmen were asleep, I crept in there and examined both tunnels from end to end. But in solving one mystery I have run myself into another infinitely more perplexing.\"  \"How is that?\"  \"Why does Dr. Syx take such elaborate pains to deceive his visitors, and also the government officers? It is now plain that he conducts no mining operations whatever. This mine of his is a gigantic blind. Whenever inspectors or scientific curiosity seekers visit his mill his mute workmen assume the air of being very busy, the cars laden with his so-called 'ore' rumble out of the tunnel, and their contents are ostentatiously poured into the furnace, or appear to be poured into it, really dropping into a receptacle beneath, to be carried back into the mine again. And then the doctor leads his gulled visitors around to the other side of the furnace and shows them the molten metal coming out in streams. Now what does it all mean? That's what I'd like to find out. What's his game? For, mark you, if he doesn't get artemisium from this pretended ore, he gets it from some other source, and right on this spot, too. There is no doubt about that. The whole world is supplied by Syx's furnace, and Syx feeds his furnace with something that comes from his ten acres of Grand Teton rock. What is that something? How does he get it, and where does he hide it? These are the things I should like to find out.\"  \"Well,\" I replied, \"I fear I can't help you.\"  \"But the difference between you and me,\" he retorted, \"is that you can go to sleep over it, while I shall never get another good night's rest so long as this black mystery remains unsolved.\"  \"What will you do?\"  \"I don't know exactly what. But I've got a dim idea which may take shape after a while.\"  Hall was silent for some time; then he suddenly asked:  \"Did you ever hear of that queer magic-lantern show with which Dr. Syx entertained Mr. Boon and the members of the financial commission in the early days of the artemisium business?\"  \"Yes, I've heard the story, but I don't think it was ever made public. The newspapers never got hold of it.\"  \"No, I believe not. Odd thing, wasn't it?\"  \"Why, yes, very odd, but just like the doctor's eccentric ways, though. He's always doing something to astonish somebody, without any apparent earthly reason. But what put you in mind of that?\"  \"Free artemisium put me in mind of it,\" replied Hall, quizzically.  \"I don't see the connection.\"  \"I'm not sure that I do either, but when you are dealing with Dr. Syx nothing is too improbable to be thought of.\"  Hall thereupon fell to musing again, while we returned to the entrance of the tunnel. After he had made everything secure, and slipped the key into his pocket, my companion remarked:  \"Don't you think it would be best to keep this latest discovery to ourselves?\"  \"Certainly.\"  \"Because,\" he continued, \"nobody would be benefited just now by knowing what we know, and to expose the worthlessness of the 'ore' might cause a panic. The public is a queer animal, and never gets scared at just the thing you expect will alarm it, but always at something else.\"  We had shaken hands and were separating when Hall stopped me.  \"Do you believe in alchemy?\" he asked.  \"That's an odd question from you,\" I replied. \"I thought alchemy was exploded long ago.\"  \"Well,\" he said, slowly, \"I suppose it has been exploded, but then, you know, an explosion may sometimes be a kind of instantaneous education, breaking up old things but revealing new ones.\"    VIII  MORE OF DR. SYX'S MAGIC  Important business called me East soon after the meeting with Hall described in the foregoing chapter, and before I again saw the Grand Teton very stirring events had taken place.  As the reader is aware, Dr. Syx's agreement with the various governments limited the output of his mine. An international commission, continually in session in New York, adjusted the differences arising among the nations concerning financial affairs, and allotted to each the proper amount of artemisium for coinage. Of course, this amount varied from time to time, but a fair average could easily be maintained. The gradual increase of wealth, in houses, machinery, manufactured and artistic products called for a corresponding increase in the circulating medium; but this, too, was easily provided for. An equally painstaking supervision was exercised over the amount of the precious metal which Dr. Syx was permitted to supply to the markets for use in the arts. On this side, also, the demand gradually increased; but the wonderful Teton mine seemed equal to all calls upon its resources.  After the failure of the mining operations there was a moderate revival of the efforts to reduce the Teton ore, but no success cheered the experimenters. Prospectors also wandered all over the earth looking for pure artemisium, but in vain. The general public, knowing nothing of what Hall had discovered, and still believing Syx's story that he also had found pure artemisium in his mine, accounted for the failure of the tunnelling operations on the supposition that the metal, in a free state, was excessively rare, and that Dr. Syx had had the luck to strike the only vein of it that the Grand Teton contained. As if to give countenance to this opinion, Dr. Syx now announced, in the most public manner, that he had been deceived again, and that the vein of free metal he had struck being exhausted, no other had appeared. Accordingly, he said, he must henceforth rely exclusively, as in the beginning, upon reduction of the ore.  Artemisium had proved itself an immense boon to mankind, and the new era of commercial prosperity which it had ushered in already exceeded everything that the world had known in the past. School-children learned that human civilization had taken five great strides, known respectively, beginning at the bottom, as the \"age of stone,\" the \"age of bronze,\" the \"age of iron,\" the \"age of gold,\" and the \"age of artemisium.\"  Nevertheless, sources of dissatisfaction finally began to appear, and, after the nature of such things, they developed with marvellous rapidity. People began to grumble about \"contraction of the currency.\" In every country there arose a party which demanded \"free money.\" Demagogues pointed to the brief reign of paper money after the demonetization of gold as a happy period, when the people had enjoyed their rights, and the \"money barons\"--borrowing a term from nineteenth-century history--were kept at bay.  Then came denunciations of the international commission for restricting the coinage. Dr. Syx was described as \"a devil-fish sucking the veins of the planet and holding it helpless in the grasp of his tentacular billions.\" In the United States meetings of agitators passed furious resolutions, denouncing the government, assailing the rich, cursing Dr. Syx, and calling upon \"the oppressed\" to rise and \"take their own.\" The final outcome was, of course, violence. Mobs had to be suppressed by military force. But the most dramatic scene in the tragedy occurred at the Grand Teton. Excited by inflammatory speeches and printed documents, several thousand armed men assembled in the neighborhood of Jenny's Lake and prepared to attack the Syx mine. For some reason the military guard had been depleted, and the mob, under the leadership of a man named Bings, who showed no little talent as a commander and strategist, surprised the small force of soldiers and locked them up in their own guard-house.  Telegraphic communication having been cut off by the astute Bings, a fierce attack was made on the mine. The assailants swarmed up the sides of the canyon, and attempted to break in through the foundation of the buildings. But the masonry was stronger than they had anticipated, and the attack failed. Sharp-shooters then climbed the neighboring heights, and kept up an incessant peppering of the walls with conical bullets driven at four thousand feet per second.  No reply came from the gloomy structure. The huge column of black smoke rose uninterruptedly into the sky, and the noise of the great engine never ceased for an instant. The mob gathered closer on all sides and redoubled the fire of the rifles, to which was now added the belching of several machine-guns. Ragged holes began to appear in the walls, and at the sight of these the assailants yelled with delight. It was evident that, the mill could not long withstand so destructive a bombardment. If the besiegers had possessed artillery they would have knocked the buildings into splinters within twenty minutes. As it was, they would need a whole day to win their victory.  Suddenly it became evident that the besieged were about to take a hand in the fight. Thus far they had not shown themselves or fired a shot, but now a movement was perceived on the roof, and the projecting arms of some kind of machinery became visible. Many marksmen concentrated their fire upon the mysterious objects, but apparently with little effect. Bings, mounted on a rock, so as to command a clear view of the field, was on the point, of ordering a party to rush forward with axes and beat down the formidable doors, when there came a blinding flash from the roof, something swished through the air, and a gust of heat met the assailants in the face. Bings dropped dead from his perch, and then, as if the scythe of the Destroyer had swung downward, and to right and left in quick succession, the close-packed mob was levelled, rank after rank, until the few survivors crept behind rocks for refuge.  Instantly the atmospheric broom swept up and down the canyon and across the mountain's flanks,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8199"],["title","The Moon Metal (#7)"],["body"," the marksmen fell in bunches like shaken grapes. Nine-tenths of the besiegers were destroyed within ten minutes after the first movement had been noticed on the roof. Those who survived owed their escape to the rocks which concealed them, and they lost no time in crawling off into neighboring chasms, and, as soon as they were beyond eye-shot from the mill, they fled with panic speed.  Then the towering form of Dr. Syx appeared at the door. Emerging without sign of fear or excitement, he picked his way among his fallen enemies, and, approaching the military guard-house, undid the fastening and set the imprisoned soldiers free.  \"I think I am paying rather dear for my whistle,\" he said, with a characteristic sneer, to Captain Carter, the commander of the troop. \"It seems that I must not only defend my own people and property when attacked by mob force, but must also come to the rescue of the soldiers whose pay-rolls are met from my pocket.\"  The captain made no reply, and Dr. Syx strode back to the works. When the released soldiers saw what had occurred their amazement had no bounds. It was necessary at once to dispose of the dead, and this was no easy undertaking for their small force. However, they accomplished it, and at the beginning of their work made a most surprising discovery.  \"How's this, Jim?\" said one of the men to his comrade, as they stooped to lift the nearest victim of Dr. Syx's withering fire. \"What's this fellow got all over him?\"  \"Artemisium! 'pon my soul!\" responded \"Jim,\" staring at the body. \"He's all coated over with it.\"  Immediately from all sides came similar exclamations. Every man who had fallen was covered with a film of the precious metal, as if he had been dipped into an electrolytic bath. Clothing seemed to have been charred, and the metallic atoms had penetrated the flesh of the victims. The rocks all round the battle-field were similarly veneered. \"It looks to me,\" said Captain Carter, \"as if old Syx had turned one of his spouts of artemisium into a hose-pipe and soaked 'em with it.\"  \"That's it,\" chimed in a lieutenant, \"that's exactly what he's done.\"  \"Well,\" returned the captain, \"if he can do that, I don't see what use he's got for us here.\"  \"Probably he don't want to waste the stuff,\" said the lieutenant. \"What do you suppose it cost him to plate this crowd?\"  \"I guess a month's pay for the whole troop wouldn't cover the expense. It's costly, but then--gracious! Wouldn't I have given something for the doctor's hose when I was a youngster campaigning in the Philippines in '99?\"  The story of the marvellous way in which Dr. Syx defended his mill became the sensation of the world for many days. The hose-pipe theory, struck off on the spot by Captain Carter, seized the popular fancy, and was generally accepted without further question. There was an element of the ludicrous which robbed the tragedy of some of its horror. Moreover, no one could deny that Dr. Syx was well within his rights in defending himself by any means when so savagely attacked, and his triumphant success, no less than the ingenuity which was supposed to underlie it, placed him in an heroic light which he had not hitherto enjoyed.  As to the demagogues who were responsible for the outbreak and its terrible consequences, they slunk out of the public eye, and the result of the battle at the mine seemed to have been a clearing up of the atmosphere, such as a thunderstorm effects at the close of a season of foul weather.  But now, little as men guessed it, the beginning of the end was close at hand.    IX  THE DETECTIVE OF SCIENCE  The morning of my arrival at Grand Teton station, on my return from the East, Andrew Hall met me with a warm greeting.  \"I have been anxiously expecting you,\" he said, \"for I have made some progress towards solving the great mystery. I have not yet reached a conclusion, but I hope soon to let you into the entire secret. In the meantime you can aid me with your companionship, if in no other way, for, since the defeat of the mob, this place has been mighty lonesome. The Grand Teton is a spot that people who have no particular business out here carefully avoid. I am on speaking terms with Dr. Syx, and occasionally, when there is a party to be shown around, I visit his works, and make the best possible use of my eyes. Captain Carter of the military is a capital fellow, and I like to hear his stories of the war in Luzon forty years ago, but I want somebody to whom I can occasionally confide things, and so you are as welcome as moonlight in harvest-time.\"  \"Tell me something about that wonderful fight with the mob. Did you see it?\"  \"I did. I had got wind of what Bings intended to do while I was down at Pocotello, and I hurried up here to warn the soldiers, but unfortunately I came too late. Finding the military cooped up in the guard-house and the mob masters of the situation, I kept out of sight on the side of the Teton, and watched the siege with my binocular. I think there was very little of the spectacle that I missed.\"  \"What of the mysterious force that the doctor employed to sweep off the assailants?\"  \"Of course, Captain Carter's suggestion that Syx turned molten artemisium from his furnace into a hose-pipe and sprayed the enemy with it is ridiculous. But it is much easier to dismiss Carter's theory than to substitute a better one. I saw the doctor on the roof with a gang of black workmen, and I noticed the flash of polished metal turned rapidly this way and that, but there was some intervening obstacle which prevented me from getting a good view of the mechanism employed. It certainly bore no resemblance to a hose-pipe, or anything of that kind. No emanation was visible from the machine, but it was stupefying to see the mob melt down.\"  \"How about the coating of the bodies with artemisium?\"  \"There you are back on the hose-pipe again,\" laughed Hall. \"But, to tell you the truth, I'd rather be excused from expressing an opinion on that operation in wholesale electro-plating just at present. I've the ghost of an idea what it means, but let me test my theory a little before I formulate it. In the meanwhile, won't you take a stroll with me?\"  \"Certainly; nothing could please me better,\" I replied. \"Which way shall we go?\"  \"To the top of the Grand Teton.\"  \"What! are you seized with the mountain-climbing fever?\"  \"Not exactly, but I have a particular reason for wishing to take a look from that pinnacle.\"  \"I suppose you know the real apex of the peak has never been trodden by man?\"  \"I do know it, but it is just that apex that I am determined to have under my feet for ten minutes. The failure of others is no argument for us.\"  \"Just as you say,\" I rejoined. \"But I suppose there is no indiscretion in asking whether this little climb has any relation to the mystery?\"  \"If it didn't have an important relation to the clearing up of that dark thing I wouldn't risk my neck in such an undertaking,\" was the reply.  Accordingly, the next morning we set out for the peak. All previous climbers, as we were aware, had attacked it from the west. That seemed the obvious thing to do, because the westward slopes of the mountain, while very steep, are less abrupt than those which face the rising sun. In fact, the eastern side of the Grand Teton appears to be absolutely unclimbable. But both Hall and I had had experience with rock climbing in the Alps and the Dolomites, and we knew that what looked like the hardest places sometimes turn out to be next to the easiest. Accordingly we decided--the more particularly because it would save time, but also because we yielded to the common desire to outdo our predecessors--to try to scale the giant right up his face.  We carried a very light but exceedingly strong rope, about five hundred feet long, wore nail-shod shoes, and had each a metal-pointed staff and a small hatchet in lieu of the regular mountaineer's axe. Advancing at first along the broken ridge between two gorges we gradually approached the steeper part of the Teton, where the cliffs looked so sheer and smooth that it seemed no wonder that nobody had ever tried to scale them. The air was deliciously clear and the sky wonderfully blue above the mountains, and the moon, a few days past its last quarter, was visible in the southwest, its pale crescent face slightly blued by the atmosphere, as it always appears when seen in daylight.    \"Slow westering, a phantom sail--    The lonely soul of yesterday.\"  Behind us, somewhat north of east, lay the Syx works, with their black smoke rising almost vertically in the still air. Suddenly, as we stumbled along on the rough surface, something whizzed past my face and fell on the rock at my feet. I looked at the strange missile, that had come like a meteor out of open space, with astonishment.  It was a bird, a beautiful specimen of the scarlet tanagers, which I remembered the early explorers had found inhabiting the Teton canyons, their brilliant plumage borrowing splendor from contrast with the gloomy surroundings. It lay motionless, its outstretched wings having a curious shrivelled aspect, while the flaming color of the breast was half obliterated with smutty patches. Stooping to pick it up, I noticed a slight bronzing, which instantly recalled to my mind the peculiar appearance of the victims of the attack on the mine.  \"Look here!\" I called to Hall, who was several yards in advance. He turned, and I held up the bird by a wing.  \"Where did you get that?\" he asked.  \"It fell at my feet a moment ago.\"  Hall glanced in a startled manner at the sky, and then down the slope of the mountain.  \"Did you notice in what direction it was flying?\" he asked.  \"No, it dropped so close that it almost grazed my nose. I saw nothing of it until it made me blink.\"  \"I have been heedless,\" muttered Hall under his breath. At the time I did not notice the singularity of his remark, my attention being absorbed in contemplating the unfortunate tanager.  \"Look how its feathers"]]]
