The grown-ups talked or read aloud or played the piano, and we either listened to them or had some jolly game of our own, and in anxious fear awaited the moment when the English grandfather-clock on the landing would give a click and a buzz, and slowly and clearly ring out ten.  Perhaps mama would not notice? She was in the sitting-room, making a copy.  \"Come, children, bedtime! Say good night,\" she would call.  \"In a minute, Mama; just five minutes.\"  \"Run along; it's high time; or there will be no getting you up in the morning to do your lessons.\"  We would say a lingering good night, on the lookout for any chance for delay, and at last would go down-stairs through the arches, annoyed at the thought that we were children still and had to go to bed while the grown-ups could stay up as long as ever they liked.     A JOURNEY TO THE STEPPES  WHEN I was still a child and had not yet read \"War and Peace,\" I was told that NATASHA ROSTOF was Aunt Tanya. When my father was asked whether that was true, and whether DMITRY ROSTOF was such and such a person and LEVIN such and such another, he never gave a definite answer, and one could not but feel that he disliked such questions and was rather offended by them.  In those remote days about which I am talking, my father was very keen about the management of his estate, and devoted a lot of energy to it. I can remember his planting the huge apple orchard at Yasnaya and several hundred acres of birch and pine forest, and at the beginning of the seventies, for a number of years, he was interested in buying up land cheap in the province of Samara, and breeding droves of steppe horses and flocks of sheep.  I still have pretty clear, though rather fragmentary and inconsequent, recollections of our three summer excursions to the steppes of Samara.  My father had already been there before his marriage in 1862, and afterward by the advice of Dr. Zakharyin, who attended him. He took the kumiss-cure in 1871 and 1872, and at last, in 1873, the whole family went there.  At that time my father had bought several hundred acres of cheap Bashkir lands in the district of Buzuluk, and we went to stay on our new property at a khutor, or farm.  In Samara we lived on the farm in a tumble-down wooden house, and beside us, in the steppe, were erected two felt kibitkas, or Tatar frame tents, in which our Bashkir, Muhammed Shah Romanytch, lived with his wives.  Morning and evening they used to tie the mares up outside the kibitkas, where they were milked by veiled women, who then hid themselves from the sight of the men behind a brilliant chintz curtain, and made the kumiss.  The kumiss was bitter and very nasty, but my father and my uncle Stephen Behrs were very fond of it, and drank it in large quantities.  When we boys began to get big, we had at first a German tutor for two or three years, Fyodor Fyodorovitch Kaufmann.  I cannot say that we were particularly fond of him. He was rather rough, and even we children were struck by his German stupidity. His redeeming feature was that he was a devoted sportsman. Every morning he used to jerk the blankets off us and shout, \"Auf, Kinder! auf!\" and during the daytime plagued us with German calligraphy.     OUTDOOR SPORTS  THE chief passion of my childhood was riding. I well remember the time when my father used to put me in the saddle in front of him and we would ride out to bathe in the Voronka. I have several interesting recollections connected with these rides.  One day as we were going to bathe, papa turned round and said to me:  \"Do you know, Ilyusha, I am very pleased with myself to-day. I have been bothered with her for three whole days, and could not manage to make her go into the house; try as I would, it was impossible. It never would come right. But to-day I remembered that there is a mirror in every hall, and that every lady wears a bonnet.  \"As soon as I remembered that, she went where I wanted her to, and did everything she had to. You would think a bonnet is a small affair, but everything depended on that bonnet.\"  As I recall this conversation, I feel sure that my father was talking about that scene in \"Anna Karenina\" where ANNA went to see her son.  Although in the final form of the novel nothing is said in this scene either about a bonnet or a mirror,--nothing is mentioned but a thick black veil,--still, I imagine that in its original form, when he was working on the passage, my father may have brought Anna up to the mirror, and made her straighten her bonnet or take it off.  I can remember the interest with which he told me this, and it now seems strange that he should have talked about such subtle artistic experiences to a boy of seven who was hardly capable of understanding him at the time. However, that was often the case with him.  I once heard from him a very interesting description of what a writer needs for his work:  \"You cannot imagine how important one's mood is,\" he said. \"Sometimes you get up in the morning, fresh and vigorous, with your head clear, and you begin to write. Everything is sensible and consistent. You read it over next day, and have to throw the whole thing away, because, good as it is, it misses the main thing. There is no imagination in it, no subtlety, none of the necessary something, none of that only just without which all your cleverness is worth nothing. Another day you get up after a bad night, with your nerves all on edge, and you think, 'To-day I shall write well, at any rate.' And as a matter of fact, what you write is beautiful, picturesque, with any amount of imagination. You look it through again; it is no good, because it is written stupidly. There is plenty of color, but not enough intelligence.  \"One's writing is good only when the intelligence and the imagination are in equilibrium. As soon as one of them overbalances the other, it's all up; you may as well throw it away and begin afresh.\"  As a matter of fact, there was no end to the rewriting in my father's works. His industry in this particular was truly marvelous.  We were always devoted to sport from our earliest childhood. I can remember as well as I remember myself my father's favorite dog in those days, an Irish setter called Dora. They would bring round the cart, with a very quiet horse between the shafts, and we would drive out to the marsh, to Degatna or to Malakhov. My father and sometimes my mother or a coachman sat on the seat, while I and Dora lay on the floor.  When we got to the marsh, my father used to get out, stand his gun on the ground, and, holding it with his left hand, load it.  Dora meanwhile fidgeted about, whining impatiently and wagging her thick tail.  While my father splashed through the marsh, we drove round the bank somewhat behind him, and eagerly followed the ranging of the dog, the getting up of the snipe, and the shooting. My father sometimes shot fairly well, though he often lost his head, and missed frantically.  But our favorite sport was coursing with greyhounds. What a pleasure it was when the footman Sergei Petrovitch came in and woke us up before dawn, with a candle in his hand!  We jumped up full of energy and happiness, trembling all over in the morning cold; threw on our clothes as quickly as we could, and ran out into the zala, where the samovar was boiling and papa was waiting for us.  Sometimes mama came in in her dressing-gown, and made us put on all sorts of extra woolen stockings, and sweaters and gloves.  \"What are you going to wear, Lyovotchka?\" she would say to papa. \"It's very cold to-day, and there is a wind. Only the Kuzminsky overcoat again today? You must put on something underneath, if only for my sake.\"  Papa would make a face, but give in at last, and buckle on his short gray overcoat under the other and sally forth. It would then be growing light. Our horses were brought round, we got on, and rode first to \"the other house,\" or to the kennels to get the dogs.  Agafya Mikhailovna would be anxiously waiting us on the steps. Despite the coldness of the morning, she would be bareheaded and lightly clad, with her black jacket open, showing her withered, old bosom. She carried the dog-collars in her lean, knotted hands.  \"Have you gone and fed them again?\" asks my father, severely, looking at the dogs' bulging stomachs.  \"Fed them? Not a bit; only just a crust of bread apiece.\"  \"Then what are they licking their chops for?\"  \"There was a bit of yesterday's oatmeal left over.\"  \"I thought as much! All the hares will get away again. It really is too bad! Do you do it to spite me?\"  \"You can't have the dogs running all day on empty stomachs, Lyoff Nikolaievich,\" she grunted, going angrily to put on the dogs' collars.  At last the dogs were got together, some of them on leashes, others running free; and we would ride out at a brisk trot past Bitter Wells and the grove into the open country.  My father would give the word of command, \"Line out!\" and point out the direction in which we were to go, and we spread out over the stubble fields and meadows, whistling and winding about along the lee side of the steep balks, [8] beating all the bushes with our hunting-crops, and gazing keenly at every spot or mark on the earth.  Something white would appear ahead. We stared hard at it, gathered up the reins, examined the leash, scarcely believing the good luck of having come on a hare at last. Then riding up closer and closer, with our eyes on the white thing, it would turn out to be not a hare at all, but a horse's skull. How annoying!  We would look at papa and Seryozha, thinking, \"I wonder if they saw that I took that skull for a hare.\" But papa would be sitting keen and alert on his English saddle, with the wooden stirrups, smoking a cigarette, while Seryozha would perhaps have got his leash entangled and could not get it straight.  \"Thank heaven!\" "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/813"],["title","Reminiscences of Tolstoy, (#3)"],["body","would exclaim, \"nobody saw me! What a fool I should have felt!\" So we would ride on.  The horse's even pace would begin to rock us to sleep, feeling rather bored at nothing getting up; when all of a sudden, just at the moment we least expected it, right in front of us, twenty paces away, would jump up a gray hare as if from the bowels of the earth.  The dogs had seen it before we had, and had started forward already in full pursuit. We began to bawl, \"Tally-ho! tally-ho!\" like madmen, flogging our horses with all our might, and flying after them.  The dogs would come up with the hare, turn it, then turn it again, the young and fiery Sultan and Darling running over it, catching up again, and running over again; and at last the old and experienced Winger, who had been galloping on one side all the time, would seize her opportunity, and spring in. The hare would give a helpless cry like a baby, and the dogs, burying their fangs in it, in a star-shaped group, would begin to tug in different directions.  \"Let go! Let go!\"  We would come galloping up, finish off the hare, and give the dogs the tracks, [9] tearing them off toe by toe, and throwing them to our favorites, who would catch them in the air. Then papa would teach us how to strap the hare on the back of the saddle.  After the run we would all be in better spirits, and get to better places near Yasenki and Retinka. Gray hares would get up oftener. Each of us would have his spoils in the saddle-straps now, and we would begin to hope for a fox.  Not many foxes would turn up. If they did, it was generally Tumashka, who was old and staid, who distinguished himself. He was sick of hares, and made no great effort to run after them; but with a fox he would gallop at full speed, and it was almost always he who killed.  It would be late, often dark, when we got back home.     \"ANNA KARENINA\"  I REMEMBER my father writing his alphabet and reading-book in 1871 and 1872, but I cannot at all remember his beginning \"Anna Karenina.\" I probably knew nothing about it at the time. What did it matter to a boy of seven what his father was writing? It was only later, when one kept hearing the name again and again, and bundles of proofs kept arriving, and were sent off almost every day, that I understood that \"Anna Karenina\" was the name of the novel on which my father and mother were both at work.  My mother's work seemed much harder than my father's, because we actually saw her at it, and she worked much longer hours than he did. She used to sit in the sitting-room off the zala, at her little writing-table, and spend all her free time writing.  Leaning over the manuscript and trying to decipher my father's scrawl with her short-sighted eyes, she used to spend whole evenings over it, and often sat up late at night after everybody else had gone to bed. Sometimes, when anything was written quite illegibly, she would go to my father's study and ask him what it meant. But this was very rare, because my mother did not like to disturb him.  When it happened, my father used to take the manuscript in his hand, and ask with some annoyance, \"What on earth is the difficulty?\" and would begin to read it out aloud. When he came to the difficult place he would mumble and hesitate, and sometimes had the greatest difficulty in making out, or, rather, in guessing, what he had written. He had a very bad handwriting, and a terrible habit of writing in whole sentences between the lines, or in the corners of the page, or sometimes right across it.  My mother often discovered gross grammatical errors, and pointed them out to my father, and corrected them.  When \"Anna Karenina\" began to come out in the \"Russky Vyestnik,\" [10] long galley-proofs were posted to my father, and he looked them through and corrected them.  At first the margins would be marked with the ordinary typographical signs, letters omitted, marks of punctuation, etc.; then individual words would be changed, and then whole sentences, till in the end the proof-sheet would be reduced to a mass of patches quite black in places, and it was quite impossible to send it back as it stood, because no one but my mother could make head or tail of the tangle of conventional signs, transpositions, and erasures.  My mother would sit up all night copying the whole thing out afresh.  In the morning there would lie the pages on her table, neatly piled together, covered all over with her fine, clear handwriting, and everything ready so that when \"Lyovotchka\" got up he could send the proof-sheets off by post.   My father carried them off to his study to have \"just one last look,\" and by the evening it would be just as bad again, the whole thing having been rewritten and messed up.  \"Sonya my dear, I am very sorry, but I've spoiled all your work again; I promise I won't do it any more,\" he would say, showing her the passages he had inked over with a guilty air. \"We'll send them off to-morrow without fail.\" But this to-morrow was often put off day by day for weeks or months together.  \"There's just one bit I want to look through again,\" my father would say; but he would get carried away and recast the whole thing afresh.  There were even occasions when, after posting the proofs, he would remember some particular words next day, and correct them by telegraph. Several times, in consequence of these rewritings, the printing of the novel in the \"Russky Vyestnik\" was interrupted, and sometimes it did not come out for months together.  In the last part of \"Anna Karenina\" my father, in describing the end of VRONSKY'S career, showed his disapproval of the volunteer movement and the Panslavonic committees, and this led to a quarrel with Katkof.  I can remember how angry my father was when Katkof refused to print those chapters as they stood, and asked him either to leave out part of them or to soften them down, and finally returned the manuscript, and printed a short note in his paper to say that after the death of the heroine the novel was strictly speaking at an end; but that the author had added an epilogue of two printed sheets, in which he related such and such facts, and he would very likely \"develop these chapters for the separate edition of his novel.\"  In concluding, I wish to say a few words about my father's own opinion of \"Anna Karenina.\"  In 1875 he wrote to N. N. Strakhof:  \"I must confess that I was delighted by the success of the last piece of 'Anna Karenina.' I had by no means expected it, and to tell you the truth, I am surprised that people are so pleased with such ordinary and EMPTY stuff.\"  The same year he wrote to Fet:  \"It is two months since I have defiled my hands with ink or my heart with thoughts. But now I am setting to work again on my TEDIOUS, VULGAR 'ANNA KARENINA,' with only one wish, to clear it out of the way as soon as possible and give myself leisure for other occupations, but not schoolmastering, which I am fond of, but wish to give up; it takes up too much time.\"  In 1878, when the novel was nearing its end, he wrote again to Strakhof:  \"I am frightened by the feeling that I am getting into my summer mood again. I LOATHE what I have written. The proof-sheets for the April number [of \"Anna Karenina\" in the \"Russky Vyestnik\"] now lie on my table, and I am afraid that I have not the heart to correct them. EVERYTHING in them is BEASTLY, and the whole thing ought to be rewritten,--all that has been printed, too,--scrapped and melted down, thrown away, renounced. I ought to say, 'I am sorry; I will not do it any more,' and try to write something fresh instead of all this incoherent, neither-fish-nor-flesh-nor-fowlish stuff.\"  That was how my father felt toward his novel while he was writing it. Afterward I often heard him say much harsher things about it.  \"What difficulty is there in writing about how an officer fell in love with a married woman?\" he used to say. \"There's no difficulty in it, and above all no good in it.\"  I am quite convinced that if my father could have done so, he long ago would have destroyed this novel, which he never liked and always wanted to disown.                      (To be continued)     REMINISCENCES OF TOLSTOY (Part II.)  BY HIS SON, COUNT ILYA TOLSTOY  TRANSLATED BY GEORGE CALDERON  IN the summer, when both families were together at Yasnaya, our own and the Kuzminsky's, when both the house and the annex were full of the family and their guests, we used our letter-box.  It originated long before, when I was still small and had only just learned to write, and it continued with intervals till the middle of the eighties.  It hung on the landing at the top of the stairs beside the grandfather's clock; and every one dropped his compositions into it, the verses, articles, or stories that he had written on topical subjects in the course of the week.  On Sundays we would all collect at the round table in the zala, the box would be solemnly opened, and one of the grown-ups, often my father himself, would read the contents aloud.  All the papers were unsigned, and it was a point of honor not to peep at the handwriting; but, despite this, we almost always guessed the author, either by the style, by his self-consciousness, or else by the strained indifference of his expression.  When I was a boy, and for the first time wrote a set of French verses for the letter-box, I was so shy when they were read that I hid under the table, and sat there the whole evening until I was pulled out by force.  For a long time after, I wrote no more, and was always fonder of hearing other people's compositions read than my own.  All the events of our life at Yasnaya Polyana found their echo in one way or another in the letter-box, and no one was spared, not even the grown-ups.  All our secrets, all our love-affairs, all the incidents of our complicated life were revealed in the letter-box, and both household and visitors were good-humoredly made fun of.  Unfortunately, much of the correspondence has been lost, but bits of it"]]]
