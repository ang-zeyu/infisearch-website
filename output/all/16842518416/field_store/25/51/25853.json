Nay, an this be hell, I'll willingly be damn'd:      What! sleeping, eating, walking, and disputing!      But, leaving this, let me have a wife,      The fairest maid in Germany;      For I am wanton and lascivious,      And cannot live without a wife.       MEPHIST. Well, Faustus, thou shalt have a wife.            [MEPHISTOPHILIS fetches in a WOMAN-DEVIL.]       FAUSTUS. What sight is this?       MEPHIST. Now, Faustus, wilt thou have a wife?       FAUSTUS. Here's a hot whore, indeed:  no, I'll no wife.       MEPHIST. Marriage is but a ceremonial toy,      And, if thou lov'st me, think no more of it.      I'll cull thee out the fairest courtezans,      And bring them every morning to thy bed:      She whom thine [65] eye shall like, thy [66] heart shall have,      Were she as chaste as was [67] Penelope,      As wise as Saba, or as beautiful      As was bright Lucifer before his fall.      Here, take this book, peruse it well:      The iterating of these lines brings gold;      The framing of this circle on the ground      Brings thunder, whirlwinds, storm, and lightning;      Pronounce this thrice devoutly to thyself,      And men in harness [68] shall appear to thee,      Ready to execute what thou command'st.       FAUSTUS. Thanks, Mephistophilis, for this sweet book:      This will I keep as chary as my life.           [Exeunt.]            Enter FAUSTUS, in his study, and MEPHISTOPHILIS.       FAUSTUS. When I behold the heavens, [69] then I repent,      And curse thee, wicked Mephistophilis,      Because thou hast depriv'd me of those joys.       MEPHIST. 'Twas thine [70] own seeking, Faustus; thank thyself.      But, think'st thou heaven is [71] such a glorious thing?      I tell thee, Faustus, it is not half so fair      As thou, or any man that breathes [72] on earth.       FAUSTUS. How prov'st thou that?       MEPHIST. 'Twas made for man; then he's more excellent.       FAUSTUS. If heaven was made for man, 'twas made for me:      I will renounce this magic and repent.            Enter GOOD ANGEL and EVIL ANGEL.       GOOD ANGEL. Faustus, repent; yet God will pity thee.       EVIL ANGEL. Thou art a spirit; God cannot pity thee.       FAUSTUS. Who buzzeth in mine ears [73] I am a spirit?      Be I a devil, yet God may pity me;      Yea, God will pity me, if I repent.       EVIL ANGEL. Ay, but Faustus never shall repent.           [Exeunt ANGELS.]       FAUSTUS. My heart is harden'd, I cannot repent;      Scarce can I name salvation, faith, or heaven:      Swords, poisons, halters, and envenom'd steel      Are laid before me to despatch myself;      And long ere this I [74] should have done the deed,      Had not sweet pleasure conquer'd deep despair.      Have not I made blind Homer sing to me      Of Alexander's love and Oenon's death?      And hath not he, that built the walls of Thebes      With ravishing sound of his melodious harp,      Made music with my Mephistophilis?      Why should I die, then, or basely despair?      I am resolv'd; Faustus shall not repent.--      Come, Mephistophilis, let us dispute again,      And reason of divine astrology.      Speak, are there many spheres above the moon?      Are all celestial bodies but one globe,      As is the substance of this centric earth?       MEPHIST. As are the elements, such are the heavens,      Even from the moon unto th' empyreal orb,      Mutually folded in each other's spheres,      And jointly move upon one axletree,      Whose termine [75] is term'd the world's wide pole;      Nor are the names of Saturn, Mars, or Jupiter      Feign'd, but are erring [76] stars.       FAUSTUS. But have they all one motion, both situ et tempore?       MEPHIST. All move from east to west in four-and-twenty      hours upon the poles of the world; but differ in their motions      upon the poles of the zodiac.       FAUSTUS. These slender questions Wagner can decide:      Hath Mephistophilis no greater skill?      Who knows not the double motion [77] of the planets?      That the first is finish'd in a natural day;      The second thus; Saturn in thirty years; Jupiter in twelve;      Mars in four; the Sun, Venus, and Mercury in a year; the Moon      in twenty-eight days.  These are freshmen's questions.  But      tell me, hath every sphere a dominion or intelligentia?       MEPHIST. Ay.       FAUSTUS. How many heavens or spheres are there?       MEPHIST. Nine; the seven planets, the firmament, and the empyreal      heaven.       FAUSTUS. But is there not coelum igneum et crystallinum?       MEPHIST. No, Faustus, they be but fables.       FAUSTUS. Resolve me, then, in this one question; why are not      conjunctions, oppositions, aspects, eclipses, all at one time,      but in some years we have more, in some less?       MEPHIST. Per inoequalem motum respectu totius.       FAUSTUS. Well, I am answered.  Now tell me who made the world?       MEPHIST. I will not.       FAUSTUS. Sweet Mephistophilis, tell me.       MEPHIST. Move me not, Faustus.       FAUSTUS. Villain, have I not bound thee to tell me any thing?       MEPHIST. Ay, [78] that is not against our kingdom; this is.      Thou art damned; think thou of hell.       FAUSTUS. Think, Faustus, upon God that made the world.       MEPHIST. Remember this.           [Exit.]       FAUSTUS. Ay, go, accursed spirit, to ugly hell!      'Tis thou hast damn'd distressed Faustus' soul.      Is't not too late?            Re-enter GOOD ANGEL and EVIL ANGEL.       EVIL ANGEL. Too late.       GOOD ANGEL. Never too late, if Faustus will repent.       EVIL ANGEL. If thou repent, devils will tear thee in pieces.       GOOD ANGEL. Repent, and they shall never raze thy skin.           [Exeunt ANGELS.]       FAUSTUS. O Christ, my Saviour, my Saviour      Help to save distressed Faustus' soul!            Enter LUCIFER, BELZEBUB, and MEPHISTOPHILIS.       LUCIFER. Christ cannot save thy soul, for he is just:      There's none but I have interest in the same.       FAUSTUS. O, what art thou that look'st so terribly?       LUCIFER. I am Lucifer,      And this is my companion-prince in hell.       FAUSTUS. O Faustus, they are come to fetch thy soul!       BELZEBUB. We are come to tell thee thou dost injure us.       LUCIFER. Thou call'st of Christ, contrary to thy promise.       BELZEBUB. Thou shouldst not think on God.       LUCIFER. Think of the devil.       BELZEBUB. And his dam too.       FAUSTUS. Nor will Faustus henceforth:  pardon him for this,      And Faustus vows never to look to heaven.       LUCIFER. So shalt thou shew thyself an obedient servant,      And we will highly gratify thee for it.       BELZEBUB. Faustus, we are come from hell in person to shew thee      some pastime:  sit down, and thou shalt behold the Seven Deadly      Sins appear to thee in their own proper shapes and likeness.       FAUSTUS. That sight will be as pleasant unto me,      As Paradise was to Adam the first day      Of his creation.       LUCIFER. Talk not of Paradise or creation; but mark the show.--      Go, Mephistophilis, and [79] fetch them in.            MEPHISTOPHILIS brings in the SEVEN DEADLY SINS.       BELZEBUB. Now, Faustus, question them of their names and      dispositions.       FAUSTUS. That shall I soon.--What art thou, the [80] first?       PRIDE. I am Pride.  I disdain to have any parents.  I am like to      Ovid's flea; I can creep into every corner of a wench; sometimes,      like a perriwig, I sit upon her brow; next, like a necklace, I hang      about her neck; then, like a fan of feathers, I kiss her lips; [81]      and then, turning myself to a wrought smock, do what I list.      But, fie, what a smell is here!  I'll not speak a word more for      a king's ransom, unless the ground be perfumed, and covered with      cloth of arras.       FAUSTUS. Thou art a proud knave, indeed.--What art thou, the second?       COVETOUSNESS. I am Covetousness, begotten of an old churl, in a      leather bag:  and, might I now obtain my wish, this house, you,      and all, should turn to gold, that I might lock you safe into      my chest:  O my sweet gold!       FAUSTUS. And what art thou, the third?       ENVY. I am Envy, begotten of a chimney-sweeper and an oyster-wife.      I cannot read, and therefore wish all books burned.  I am lean      with seeing others eat.  O, that there would come a famine over      all the world, that all might die, and I live alone! then thou      shouldst see how fat I'd be.  But must thou sit, and I stand?      come down, with a vengeance!       FAUSTUS. Out, envious wretch!--But what art thou, the fourth?       WRATH. I am Wrath.  I had neither father nor mother:  I leapt      out of a lion's mouth when I was scarce an hour old; and ever      since have run [82] up and down the world with this [83] case of      rapiers, wounding myself when I could get none to fight withal.      I was born in hell; and look to it, for some of you shall be my      father.       FAUSTUS. And what art thou, the fifth?       GLUTTONY. I am Gluttony.  My parents are all dead, and the devil      a penny they have left me, but a small pension, and that buys me      thirty meals a-day and ten bevers,--a small trifle to suffice      nature.  I come [84] of a royal pedigree:  my father was a Gammon      of Bacon, my mother was a Hogshead of Claret-wine; my godfathers      were these, Peter Pickled-herring and Martin Martlemas-beef; but      my godmother, O, she was an ancient gentlewoman; her name was      Margery March-beer.  Now, Faustus, thou hast heard all my progeny;      wilt thou bid me to supper?       FAUSTUS. Not I.       GLUTTONY. Then the devil choke thee!       FAUSTUS. Choke thyself, glutton!--What art thou, the sixth?       SLOTH. Heigho!  I am Sloth.  I was begotten on a sunny bank.      Heigho!  I'll not speak a word more for a king's ransom.       FAUSTUS. And what are you, Mistress Minx, the seventh and last?       LECHERY."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/811"],["title","The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus (#4)"],["body"," Who, I, [85] sir?

On, piper!           [Exeunt the SINS.]       FAUSTUS. O, how this sight doth delight my soul!       LUCIFER. Tut, [87] Faustus, in hell is all manner of delight.       FAUSTUS. O, might I see hell, and return again safe,      How happy were I then!       LUCIFER. Faustus, thou shalt; at midnight I will send for thee.

[Exeunt.]            Enter ROBIN, [88] with a book.       ROBIN. What, Dick! look to the horses there, till I come again.      I have gotten one of Doctor Faustus' conjuring-books; and now      we'll have such knavery as't passes.            Enter DICK.       DICK. What, Robin! you must come away and walk the horses.       ROBIN. I walk the horses!  I scorn't, faith: [89]  I have other      matters in hand:  let the horses walk themselves, an they will.--           [Reads.]      A per se, a; t, h, e, the; o per se, o; Demy orgon gorgon.--      Keep further from me, O thou illiterate and unlearned hostler!

That thou shalt see presently:  keep out of the circle,      I say, lest I send you into the ostry with a vengeance.       DICK.

I'll tell thee what; an my master      come here, I'll clap as fair a [91] pair of horns on's head as      e'er thou sawest in thy life.       DICK. Thou need'st [92] not do that, for my mistress hath done it.       ROBIN. Ay, there be of us here that have waded as deep into      matters as other men, if they were disposed to talk.       DICK. A plague take you!  I thought you did not sneak up and down      after her for nothing.  But, I prithee, tell me in good sadness,      Robin, is that a conjuring-book?       ROBIN. Do but speak what thou'lt have me to do, and I'll do't:      if thou'lt dance naked, put off thy clothes, and I'll conjure      thee about presently; or, if thou'lt go but to the tavern with      me, I'll give thee white wine, red wine, claret-wine, sack,      muscadine, malmsey, and whippincrust, hold, belly, hold; [93] and      we'll not pay one penny for it.       DICK. O, brave!  Prithee, [94] let's to it presently, for I am as      dry as a dog.       ROBIN. Come, then, let's away.           [Exeunt.]            Enter CHORUS.       CHORUS. Learned Faustus,      To find the secrets of astronomy      Graven in the book of Jove's high firmament,      Did mount him [95] up to scale Olympus' top;      Where, sitting in a chariot burning bright,      Drawn by the strength of yoked dragons' necks,      He views [96] the clouds, the planets, and the stars,      The tropic zones, and quarters of the sky,      From the bright circle of the horned moon      Even to the height of Primum Mobile;      And, whirling round with this [97] circumference,      Within the concave compass of the pole,      From east to west his dragons swiftly glide,      And in eight days did bring him home again.      Not long he stay'd within his quiet house,      To rest his bones after his weary toil;      But new exploits do hale him out again:      And, mounted then upon a dragon's back,      That with his wings did part the subtle air,      He now is gone to prove cosmography,      That measures coasts and kingdoms of the earth;      And, as I guess, will first arrive at Rome,      To see the Pope and manner of his court,      And take some part of holy Peter's feast,      The which this day is highly solemniz'd.           [Exit.]            Enter FAUSTUS and MEPHISTOPHILIS.       FAUSTUS. Having now, my good Mephistophilis,      Pass'd with delight the stately town of Trier,      Environ'd round [98] with airy mountain-tops,      With walls of flint, and deep-entrenched lakes,      Not to be won by any conquering prince;      From Paris next, coasting the realm of France,      We saw the river Maine fall into Rhine, [99]      Whose banks are set with groves of fruitful vines;      Then up to [100] Naples, rich Campania,      Whose buildings fair and gorgeous to the eye,      The streets straight forth, and pav'd with finest brick,      Quarter the town in four equivalents: [101]      There saw we learned Maro's golden tomb;      The way he cut, an English mile in length,      Thorough [102] a rock of stone, in one night's space;      From thence to Venice, Padua, and the rest, [103]      In one of which a sumptuous temple stands,      That threats the stars with her aspiring top,      Whose frame is pav'd with sundry-colour'd stones,      And roof'd aloft with curious work in gold.      Thus hitherto hath Faustus spent his time:      But tell me [104] now, what resting-place is this?      Hast thou, as erst I did command,      Conducted me within the walls of Rome?       MEPHIST. I have, my Faustus; and, for proof thereof,      This is the goodly palace of the Pope;      And, 'cause we are no common guests,      I choose his privy-chamber for our use.       FAUSTUS. I hope his Holiness will bid us [105] welcome.       MEPHIST. All's one, for we'll be bold with his venison.      But now, my Faustus, that thou mayst perceive      What Rome contains for to delight thine eyes,      Know that this city stands upon seven hills      That underprop the groundwork of the same:      Just through [106] the midst runs flowing Tiber's stream,      With winding banks that cut it in two parts;      Over the which two stately bridges lean,      That make safe passage to each part of Rome:      Upon the bridge call'd Ponte [107] Angelo      Erected is a castle passing strong,      Where thou shalt see such store of ordnance,      As that the double cannons, forg'd of brass,      Do match [108] the number of the days contain'd      Within the compass of one complete year;      Beside the gates, and high pyramides,      That Julius Caesar brought from Africa.       FAUSTUS. Now, by the kingdoms of infernal rule,      Of Styx, of Acheron, and the fiery lake      Of ever-burning Phlegethon, I swear      That I do long to see the [109] monuments      And situation of bright-splendent Rome:      Come, therefore, let's away.       MEPHIST. Nay, stay, my Faustus:  I know you'd see the Pope,      And take some part of holy Peter's feast,      The which, in state and [110] high solemnity,      This day, is held through Rome and Italy,      In honour of the Pope's triumphant victory.       FAUSTUS. Sweet Mephistophilis, thou pleasest me.      Whilst I am here on earth, let me be cloy'd      With all things that delight the heart of man:      My four-and-twenty years of liberty      I'll spend in pleasure and in dalliance,      That Faustus' name, whilst [111] this bright frame doth stand,      May be admir'd thorough [112] the furthest land.       MEPHIST. 'Tis well said, Faustus.  Come, then, stand by me,      And thou shalt see them come immediately.       FAUSTUS. Nay, stay, my gentle Mephistophilis,      And grant me my [113] request, and then I go.      Thou know'st, within the compass of eight days      We view'd the face of heaven, of earth, and hell;      So high our dragons soar'd into the air,      That, looking down, the earth appear'd to me      No bigger than my hand in quantity;      There did we view the kingdoms of the world,      And what might please mine eye I there beheld.      Then in this show let me an actor be,      That this proud Pope may Faustus' cunning [114] see.       MEPHIST. Let it be so, my Faustus.  But, first, stay,      And view their triumphs as they pass this way;      And then devise what best contents thy mind,      By cunning in thine art to cross the Pope,      Or dash the pride of this [115] solemnity;      To make his monks and abbots stand like apes,      And point like antics at [116] his triple crown;      To beat the beads about the friars' pates,      Or clap huge horns upon the Cardinals' heads;      Or any villany thou canst devise;      And I'll perform it, [117] Faustus.  Hark! they come:      This day shall make thee be admir'd in Rome.            Enter the CARDINALS and BISHOPS, some bearing crosiers, some           the pillars; MONKS and FRIARS, singing their procession;           then the POPE, RAYMOND king of Hungary, the ARCHBISHOP           OF RHEIMS, BRUNO led in chains, and ATTENDANTS.       POPE. Cast down our footstool.       RAYMOND. Saxon Bruno, stoop,      Whilst on thy back his Holiness ascends      Saint Peter's chair and state pontifical.       BRUNO. Proud Lucifer, that state belongs to me;      But thus I fall to Peter, not to thee.       POPE. To me and Peter shalt thou grovelling lie,      And crouch before the Papal dignity.--      Sound trumpets, then; for thus Saint Peter's heir,      From Bruno's back, ascends Saint Peter's chair.           [A flourish while he ascends.]      Thus, as the gods creep on with feet of wool,      Long ere with iron hands they punish men,      So shall our sleeping vengeance now arise,      And smite with death thy hated enterprise. [118]--      Lord Cardinals of France and Padua,      Go forthwith to our [119] holy consistory,      And read, amongst the statutes decretal,      What, by the holy council held at Trent,      The sacred synod hath decreed for him      That doth assume the Papal government      Without election and a true consent:      Away, and bring us word with speed."]]]
