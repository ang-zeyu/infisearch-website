Y., 1895 to date, quarterly, $4.00 a year). This journal, the organ of the American Historical Association, contains articles by scholars, critical reviews of all important works, and notes and news. The _History Teacher's Magazine_ is edited under the supervision of a committee of the American Historical Association (Philadelphia,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7960"],["title","Early European History (#3)"],["body","to date, monthly, $2.00 a year). Every well-equipped school library should contain the files of the _National Geographic Magazine_ (Washington, 1890 to date, monthly, $2.00 a year) and of _Art and Archeology_ (Washington, 1914 to date, monthly, $3.00 a year). These two periodicals make a special feature of illustrations.  WORKS ON THE STUDY AND TEACHING OF HISTORY  Useful books for the teacher's library include H. E. Bourne, _The Teaching of History and Civics in the Elementary and the Secondary School_ (N. Y., 1902, Longmans, Green, and Co., $1.50), Henry Johnson, _The Teaching of History_ (N. Y., 1915, Macmillan, $1.40), H. B. George, _Historical Evidence_ (N.Y., 1909, Oxford University Press, American Branch, 75 cents), Frederic Harrison, _The Meaning of History and Other Historical Pieces_ (New ed., N.Y., 1900, Macmillan, $1.75), J. H. Robinson, _The New History_ (N. Y., 1912, Macmillan, $1.50), and H. B. George, _The Relations of History and Geography_ (4th ed., N. Y., 1910, Oxford University Press, American Branch, $1.10). The following reports are indispensable:  _The Study of History in Schools_. Report to the American Historical Association by the Committee of Seven (N. Y., 1899, Macmillan, 50 cents).  _The Study of History in Secondary Schools_. Report to the American Historical Association by a Committee of Five (N. Y., 1911, Macmillan, 25 cents).  _Historical Sources in Schools._ Report to the New England History Teachers' Association by a Select Committee (N. Y., 1902, Macmillan, out of print).  _A History Syllabus for Secondary Schools_. Report by a Special Committee of the New England History Teachers' Association (N. Y., 1904, Heath, $1.32).  _A Bibliography of History for Schools and Libraries._ Published under the auspices of the Association of History Teachers of the Middle States and Maryland (2d ed., N. Y., 1915, Longmans, Green, and Co., 60 cents).  DICTIONARIES AND ENCYCLOPEDIAS  The most useful dictionaries of classical antiquities are H. B. Walters, _A Classical Dictionary_ (N. Y., 1916, Putnam, $6.50) and H. T. Peck, _Harper's Dictionary of Classical Literature and Antiquities_ (N. Y., 1897, American Book Co., $6.00). Cambridge University, England, has published _A Companion to Greek Studies_, edited by L. Whibley (2d ed., N. Y., 1906, Putnam, $6.00), and _A Companion to Latin Studies_, edited by J. E. Sandys (N. Y., 1911, Putnam, $6.00). These two volumes treat every phase of ancient life in separate essays by distinguished scholars. For chronology, genealogies, lists of sovereigns, and other data the most valuable works are Arthur Hassall, _European History, 476-1910_ (new ed., N. Y., 1910, Macmillan, $2.25), G. P. Putnam, _Tabular Views of Universal History_ (new ed., N. Y., 1915, Putnam, $2.50), and Karl J. Ploetz, _A Handbook of Universal History_, translated by W. H. Tillinghast (Boston, 1915, Houghton Mifflin Co., $3.00).   SYLLABI  The _Illustrated Topics for Ancient History_, arranged by D. C. Knowlton (Philadelphia, McKinley Publishing Co., 65 cents), contain much valuable material in the shape of a syllabus, source quotations, outline maps, pictures, and other aids. The following syllabi have been prepared for collegiate instruction:  Botsford, G. W. _A Syllabus of Roman History_ (N. Y., 1915, Macmillan, 50 cents).  Munro, D. C., and SELLERY, G. C. _A Syllabus of Medieval History, 395- 1500_ (N. Y., 1913, Longmans, Green, and Co., $1.00).  Richardson, O. H. _Syllabus of Continental European History from the Fall of Rome to 1870_ (Boston, 1904, Ginn, boards, 75 cents).  Stephenson, Andrew. _Syllabus of Lectures on European History_ (Terre Haute, Ind., 1897, Inland Publishing Co., $1.50).  Thompson, J. W. _Reference Studies in Medieval History_ (2d ed., Chicago, 1914, University of Chicago Press, $1.25). A rich collection of classified references.  ATLASES  An admirable collection of maps for school use is W. R. Shepherd, _Historical Atlas_ (N. Y., 1911, Holt, $2.50), with about two hundred and fifty maps covering the historical field. The latest and one of the best of the classical atlases is _Murray's Small Classical Atlas_, edited by G. B. Grundy (N. Y., 1904, Oxford University Press, American Branch, $1.35). A special feature of this work is the adoption of the system of colored contours to indicate configuration. The _Atlas of Ancient and Classical Geography_ in \"Everyman's Library\" (N. Y., 1910, Dutton, 35 cents) might well be purchased by every student. Other valuable works are E. W. Dow, _Atlas of European History_ (N. Y., 1907, Holt, $1.50) and Ramsay Muir, _A New School Atlas of Modern History_ (N. Y., 1911, Holt, $1.25). Much use can be made of the inexpensive and handy _Literary and Historical Atlas of Europe_ by J. G. Bartholomew in \"Everyman's Library\" (N. Y., 1910, Dutton, 35 cents).  WALL MAPS AND CHARTS  Kiepert's _New Wall Maps of Ancient History_ (Chicago, Rand, McNally, and Co.) and Johnston's _Classical Series_ (Chicago, A. J. Nystrom and Co.) may be obtained singly, mounted on common rollers, or by sets in a case with spring rollers. The text is in Latin. The Spruner-Bretschneider _Historical Maps_ are ten in number, size 62 x 52 inches, and cover the period from A.D. 350 to 1815. The text is in German (Chicago, Nystrom, each $6.00; Rand, McNally, and Co., each $6.50). Johnston's _Maps of English and European History_ are sixteen in number, size 40 x 30 inches, and include four maps of ancient history (Chicago, Nystrom, each $2.50). A new series of _European History Maps_, thirty-nine in number, size 44 x 32 inches, has been prepared for the study of ancient history by Professors J. H. Breasted and C. F. Huth, and for medieval and modern history by Professor S. B. Harding (Chicago, Denoyer-Geppert Co., complete set with tripod stand, $52.00; in two spring roller cases, $73.00). These maps may also be had separately. The maps in this admirable series omit all irrelevant detail, present place names in the modern English form, and in choice of subject matter emphasize the American viewpoint. The school should also possess good physical wall maps such as the Sydow-Habenicht or the Kiepert series, both to be obtained from Rand, McNally, and Co. The text is in German. Phillips's _Model Test Maps_ and Johnston's _New Series of Physical Wall Maps_ are obtainable from A. J. Nystrom and Co. The only large charts available are those prepared by MacCoun for his _Historical Geography Charts of Europe_. The two sections, \"Ancient and Classical\" and \"Medieval and Modern,\" are sold separately (N. Y., Silver, Burdett, and Co., $15.00). A helpful series of _Blackboard Outline Maps_ is issued by J. L. Engle, Beaver, Penn. These are wall maps, printed with paint on blackboard cloth, for use with an ordinary crayon. Such maps are also sold by the Denoyer-Geppert Co., Chicago.  OUTLINE MAPS  The \"Studies\" following each chapter of this book include various exercises for which small outline maps are required. Such maps are sold by D. C. Heath and Co., Boston, New York, Chicago. Useful atlases of outline maps are also to be had of the McKinley Publishing Co., Philadelphia, Atkinson, Mentzer and Grover, Chicago, W. B. Harison, New York City, and of other publishers.  ILLUSTRATIONS  The best photographs of ancient works of art must usually be obtained from the foreign publishers in Naples, Florence, Rome, Munich, Paris, Athens, and London, or from their American agents. Such photographs, in the usual size, 8 x 10 inches, sell, unmounted, at from 6 to 8 francs a dozen. All dealers in lantern slides issue descriptive catalogues of a great variety of archaeological subjects. In addition to photographs and lantern slides, a collection of stereoscopic views is very helpful in giving vividness and interest to instruction in ancient history. An admirable series of photographs for the stereoscope, including Egypt, Palestine, Greece, and Italy, is issued by Underwood and Underwood, New York City. The same firm supplies convenient maps and handbooks for use in this connection. The Keystone stereographs, prepared by the Keystone View Company, Meadville, Penn., may also be cordially recommended. The architecture, costumes, amusements, and occupations of the Middle Ages in England are shown in _Longmans' Historical Illustrations_ (six portfolios, each containing twelve plates in black-and-white, Longmans, Green, and Co., 90 cents, each portfolio). The same firm issues _Longmans' Historical Wall Pictures_, consisting of twelve colored pictures from original paintings illustrating English history (each picture, separately, 80 cents; in a portfolio, $10.50). Other notable collections are Lehmann's _Geographical Pictures, Historical Pictures_, and _Types of Nations_, and Cybulski's _Historical Pictures_ (Chicago, Denoyer-Geppert Co.; each picture separately mounted on rollers, $1.35 to $2.25). The New England History Teachers' Association publishes a series of _Authentic Pictures for Class Room Use_, size 5 x 8 inches, price 3 cents each. The _Catalogue of the Collection of Historical Material at Simmons College_, prepared by the New England History Teachers' Association (2d ed., Boston, 1912, Houghton Mifflin Co., 25 cents), contains an extensive list of pictures, slides, models, and other aids to history teaching. Among the more useful collections in book form of photographic reproductions and drawings are the following:  Fechneimer, Hedwig. _Die Plastik der Ägypter_ (2d. ed., Berlin, 1914, B. Cassirer, 12 marks). 156 plates of Egyptian sculpture.  Fougčres, Gustvae. _La vie publique et privée des Grecs et des Romains_ (2d ed., Paris, 1900, Hachette, 15 francs). An album of 85 pictures.  Furtwängler, Adolf. _Masterpieces of Greek Sculpture_ (N. Y., Scribner, $15.00).  Hekler, Anton. _Greek and Roman Portraits_ (N. Y., 1913, Putnam, $7.50). 311 plates, with comment and bibliography.
