It must be remembered that the foregoing data are only applicable to the locality they relate to, although after obtaining the necessary information similar diagrams can be made and used for other places; but enough has been said to show that when it is necessary to utilise the full effect of the currents the sewage should be discharged at a varying time before high or low water, as the case may be, according to the height of the tide.     CHAPTER V.  VOLUME OF SEWAGE.   The total quantity of sewage to be dealt with per day can be ascertained by gauging the flow in those cases where the sewers are already constructed, but where the scheme is an entirely new one the quantity must be estimated. If there is a water supply system the amount of water consumed per day, after making due allowance for the quantity used for trade purposes and street watering, will be a useful guide. The average amount of water used per head per day for domestic purposes only may be taken as follows:--   DAILY WATER SUPPLY (Gallons per head per day.)  Dietetic purposes (cooking, drinking, &c.)    1 Cleansing purposes (washing house utensils, clothes, &c.)                                 6  If water-closets are in general use, add      3  If baths are in general use, add              5  Total                                        15  It therefore follows that the quantity of domestic sewage to be expected will vary from 7 to 15 gallons per head per day, according to the extent of the sanitary conveniences installed in the town; but with the advent of an up-to-date sewage scheme, probably accompanied by a proper water supply, a very large increase in the number of water-closets and baths may confidently be anticipated, and it will rarely be advisable to provide for a less quantity of domestic sewage than 15 gallons per head per day for each of the resident inhabitants. The problem is complicated in sea coast towns by the large influx of visitors during certain short periods of the year, for whom the sewerage system must be sufficient, and yet it must not be so large compared with the requirements of the residential population that it cannot be kept in an efficient state during that part of the year when the visitors are absent. The visitors are of two types--the daily trippers and those who spend several days or weeks in the town. The daily tripper may not directly contribute much sewage to the sewers, but he does indirectly through those who cater for his wants. The resident visitor will spend most of the day out of doors, and therefore cause less than the average quantity of water to be used for house-cleansing purposes, in addition to which the bulk of the soiled linen will not be washed in the town. An allowance of 10 gallons per head per day for the resident visitor and 5 gallons per head per day for the trippers will usually be found a sufficient provision.  It is, of course, well known that the flow of sewage varies from day to day as well as from hour to hour, and while there is no necessity to consider the daily variation--calculations being based on the flow of the maximum day--the hourly variation plays a most important part where storage of the sewage for any length of time is an integral part of the scheme. There are many important factors governing this variation, and even if the most elaborate calculations are made they are liable to be upset at any time by the unexpected discharge of large quantities of trade wastes. With a small population the hourly fluctuation in the quantity of sewage flowing into the sewers is very great, but it reduces as the population increases, owing to the diversity of the occupations and habits of the inhabitants. In all cases where the residential portions of the district are straggling, and the outfall works are situated at a long distance from the centre of the town, the flow becomes steadier, and the inequalities are not so prominently marked at the outlet end of the sewer. The rate of flow increases more or less gradually to the maximum about midday, and falls off in the afternoon in the same gradual manner. The following table, based on numerous gaugings, represents approximately the hourly variations in the dry weather flow of the sewage proper from populations numbering from 1,000 to 10,000, and is prepared after deducting all water which may be present in the sewers resulting from the infiltration of subsoil water through leaky joints in the pipes, and from defective water supply fittings as ascertained from the night gaugings. Larger towns have not been included in the table because the hourly rates of flow are generally complicated by the discharge of the trade wastes previously referred to, which must be the subject of special investigation in each case.

This table and diagram relate only to the flow of sewage--that is, water which is intentionally fouled; but unfortunately it is almost invariably found that the flow in the sewers is greater than is thus indicated, and due allowance must be made accordingly. The greater the amount of extra liquid flowing in the sewers as a permanent constant stream, the less marked will be the hourly variations; and in one set of gaugings which came under the writer's notice the quantity of extraneous liquid in the sewers was so greatly in excess of the ordinary sewage flow that, taken as a percentage of the total daily flow, the hourly variation was almost imperceptible.  [Illustration: Fig 12 Hourly Variation in Flow of Sewage.]  Provision must be made in the scheme for the leakage from the water fittings, and for the subsoil water, which will inevitably find its way into the sewers. The quantity will vary very considerably, and is difficult of estimation. If the water is cheap, and the supply plentiful, the water authority may not seriously attempt to curtail the leakage; but in other cases it will be reduced to a minimum by frequent house to house inspection; some authorities going so far as to gratuitously fix new washers to taps when they are required. Theoretically, there should be no"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7980"],["title","The Sewerage of Sea Coast Towns (#8)"],["body","of subsoil water, as in nearly all modern sewerage schemes the pipes are tested and proved to be watertight before the trenches are filled in; but in practice this happy state is not obtainable. The pipes may not all be bedded as solidly as they should be, and when the pressure of the earth comes upon them settlement takes place and the joints are broken. Joints may also be broken by careless filling of trenches, or by men walking upon the pipes before they are sufficiently covered. Some engineers specify that all sewers shall be tested and proved to be absolutely water-tight before they are \"passed\" and covered in, but make a proviso that if, after the completion of the works, the leakage into any section exceeds 1/2 cubic foot per minute per mile of sewer, that length shall be taken up and relaid. Even if the greatest vigilance is exercised to obtain water-tight sewers, the numerous house connections are each potential sources of leakage, and when the scheme is complete there may be a large quantity of infiltration water to be dealt with. Where there are existing systems of old sewers the quantity of infiltration water can be ascertained by gauging the night flow; and if it is proved to be excessive, a careful examination of the course of the sewers should be made with a view to locating the places where the greater part of the leakage occurs, and then to take such steps as may be practicable to reduce the quantity.     CHAPTER VI.  GAUGING FLOW IN SEWERS.   A method frequently adopted to gauge the flow of the sewage is to fix a weir board with a single rectangular notch across the sewer in a convenient manhole, which will pond up the sewage; and then to ascertain the depth of water passing over the notch by measurements from the surface of the water to a peg fixed level with the bottom of the notch and at a distance of two or three feet away on the upstream side. The extreme variation in the flow of the sewage is so great, however, that if the notch is of a convenient width to take the maximum flow, the hourly variation at the time of minimum flow will affect the depth of the sewage on the notch to such a small extent that difficulty may be experienced in taking the readings with sufficient accuracy to show such variations in the flow, and there will be great probability of incorrect results being obtained by reason of solid sewage matter lodging on the notch. When the depth on a l2 in notch is about 6 in, a variation of only 1-16th inch in the vertical measurement will represent a difference in the rate of the flow of approximately 405 gallons per hour, or about 9,700 gallons per day. When the flow is about lin deep the same variation of 1-16th in will represent about 162 gallons per hour, or 3,900 gallons per day. Greater accuracy will be obtained if a properly-formed gauging pond is constructed independently of the manhole and a double rectangular notch, similar to Fig. 13, or a triangular or V- shaped notch, as shown in Fig. 14, used in lieu of the simpler form.  In calculating the discharge of weirs there are several formulć to choose from, all of which will give different results, though comparative accuracy has been claimed for each. Taking first a single rectangular notch and reducing the formulae to the common form:                                            ____ Discharge per foot in width of weir = C \\/ H^3  where H = depth from the surface of still water above the weir to the level of the bottom of the notch, the value of C will be as set out in the following table:--    TABLE No. 5.

If a cubic foot is taken as being equal to 6-1/4 gallons instead of 6.235 gallons, then, cubic feet per minute multiplied by 9,000 equals gallons per day. This table can be applied to ascertain the flow through the notch shown in Fig. 13 in the following way. Suppose it is required to find the discharge in cubic feet per minute when the depth of water measured in the middle of the notch is 4 in Using Santo Crimp's formula the result will be  C\\/H^3 = 4.69 \\/4^3 = 4.69 x 8 = 37.52  cubic feet per foot in width of weir, but as the weir is only 6 in wide, we must divide this figure by 2, then  37.52/2 = 18.76 cubic feet, which is the discharge per minute.      +------+                    +------+   |      |       FIG. 13      |      |   |      |                    |      |   |      |                    |      |   |      +------+      +------+      |   |             |      |             |   |             |      |             |   |             |      |             |   |             +------+             |   |                                  |   |                                  |   |                                  |   |                                  |   +----------------------------------+  Fig. 13.-ELEVATION OF DOUBLE RECTANGULAR NOTCHED GAUGING WEIR.     +------+                    +------+   |       \\      FIG. 13     /       |   |        \\                /        |   |         \\              /         |   |          \\            /          |   |           \\          /           |   |            \\        /            |   |             \\      /             |   |              \\    /              |   |               \\  /               |   |                \\/                |   |                                  |   |                                  |   |                                  |   |                                  |   |                                  |   +----------------------------------+  FIG. 14.-ELEVATION OF TRIANGULAR NOTCHED GAUGING WEIR.

In addition to the circumstances already enumerated which affect the accuracy of gaugings taken by means of a weir fixed in a sewer there is also the fact that the sewage approaches the weir with a velocity which varies considerably from time to time. In order to make allowance for this, the head calculated to produce the velocity must be added to the actual head. This can be embodied in the formula, as, for example, Santo Crimp's formula for discharge in cubic feet per minute, with H measured in feet, is written         __________________   195\\/(11^3 + .035V - H^2  instead of the usual form of        ____   195\\/ H^3, which is used  when there is no velocity to take into account. The V represents the velocity in feet per second.  Triangular or V notches are usually formed so that the angle between the two sides is 90°, when the breadth at any point will always be twice the vertical height measured at the centre. The discharge in this case varies as the square root of the fifth power of the height instead of the third power as with the rectangular notch. The reason for the alteration of the power is that _approximately_ the discharge over a notch with any given head varies as the cross-sectional area of the body of water passing over it. The area of the 90° notch is half that of a circumscribing rectangular notch, so that the discharge of a V notch is approximately equal to that of a rectangular notch having a width equal to half the width of the V notch at water level, and as the total width is equal to double the depth of water passing over the notch the half width is equal to the full depth and the discharge is equal to that of a rectangular notch having a width equal to the depth of water flowing over the V notch from time to time, both being measured in the same unit, therefore       ____                   ____                  ____   C \\/ H^3 becomes C x H x \\/ H^3 which equals C \\/ H^5.  The constant C will, however, vary from that for the rectangular notch to give an accurate result.     TABLE No. 6.    TRIANGULAR OR V NOTCHES.                     ____   Discharge = C x \\/ H^5.
