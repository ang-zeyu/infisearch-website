ALL.                You can spy, sir!                       Shut your eye, sir!                  You may use it by and by, sir!                       You can see, sir!                       Don't tell me, sir!                  That will do—now let it be, sir!    CHORUS OF GIRLS.    My papa he keeps three horses,                            Black, and white, and dapple grey, sir;                       Turn three times, then take your courses,                            Catch whichever girl you may, sir!    CHORUS OF MEN.      My papa, etc.    (Marco and Giuseppe turn round, as directed, and try to catch the   girls.  Business of blind-man's buff.  Eventually Marco catches   Gianetta, and Giuseppe catches Tessa.  The two girls try to   escape, but in vain.  The two men pass their hands over the   girls' faces to discover their identity.)    GIU.           I've at length achieved a capture!     (Guessing.)  This is Tessa!  (removes bandage).  Rapture,   rapture!    CHORUS.        Rapture, rapture!    MAR. (guessing).    To me Gianetta fate has granted!                            (removes bandage).                       Just the very girl I wanted!    CHORUS.        Just the very girl he wanted!    GIU. (politely to Mar.). If you'd rather change—    TESS.                                   My goodness!                  This indeed is simple rudeness.    MAR. (politely to Giu.). I've no preference whatever—    GIA.           Listen to him!  Well, I never!                  (Each man kisses each girl.)    GIA.           Thank you, gallant gondolieri!                       In a set and formal measure                  It is scarcely necessary                       To express our pleasure.                       Each of us to prove a treasure,                  Conjugal and monetary,                       Gladly will devote our leisure,                  Gay and gallant gondolieri.

Gay and gallant gondolieri,                       Take us both and hold us tightly,                  You have luck extraordinary;                       We might both have been unsightly!                       If we judge your conduct rightly,                  'Twas a choice involuntary;                       Still we thank you most politely,                  Gay and gallant gondolieri!                       Tra, la, la, la, la, la, etc.    CHORUS OF      Thank you, gallant gondolieri;   GIRLS.              In a set and formal measure,                  It is scarcely necessary                       To express our pleasure.                       Each of us to prove a treasure                       Gladly will devote our leisure,                  Gay and gallant gondolieri!                       Tra, la, la, la, la, la, etc.    ALL.           Fate in this has put his finger—                       Let us bow to Fate's decree,                  Then no longer let us linger,                       To the altar hurry we!    (They all dance off two and two—Gianetta with Marco, Tessa with   Giuseppe.)    (Flourish.  A gondola arrives at the Piazzetta steps, from which   enter the Duke of Plaza-toro, the Duchess, their daughter   Casilda, and their attendant Luiz, who carries a drum.  All are   dressed in pompous but old and faded clothes.)    (Entrance of Duke, Duchess, Casilda, and Luiz.)    DUKE.     From the sunny Spanish shore,             The Duke of Plaza-Tor!—    DUCH.     And His Grace's Duchess true—    CAS.      And His Grace's daughter, too—    LUIZ.     And His Grace's private drum             To Venetia's shores have come:    ALL.           If ever, ever, ever                       They get back to Spain,                  They will never, never, never                       Cross the sea again—    DUKE.     Neither that Grandee from the Spanish shore,             The noble Duke of Plaza-Tor'—    DUCH.     Nor His Grace's Duchess, staunch and true—    CAS.      You may add, His Grace's daughter, too—    LUIZ.     Nor His Grace's own particular drum             To Venetia's shores will come:    ALL.      If ever, ever, ever                  They get back to Spain,             They will never, never, never                  Cross the sea again!         DUKE.  At last we have arrived at our destination.  This is   the Ducal Palace, and it is here that the Grand Inquisitor   resides.  As a Castilian hidalgo of ninety-five quarterings, I   regret that I am unable to pay my state visit on a horse.  As a   Castilian hidalgo of that description, I should have preferred to   ride through the streets of Venice; but owing, I presume, to an   unusually wet season, the streets are in such a condition that   equestrian exercise is impracticable.  No matter.  Where is our   suite?        LUIZ (coming forward).  Your Grace, I am here.        DUCH.  Why do you not do yourself the honour to kneel when   you address His Grace?        DUKE.  My love, it is so small a matter!  (To Luiz.)  Still,   you may as well do it.  (Luiz kneels.)        CAS.  The young man seems to entertain but an imperfect   appreciation of the respect due from a menial to a Castilian   hidalgo.        DUKE.  My child, you are hard upon our suite.        CAS.  Papa, I've no patience with the presumption of persons   in his plebeian position.  If he does not appreciate that   position, let him be whipped until he does.        DUKE.  Let us hope the omission was not intended as a   slight.  I should be much hurt if I thought it was.  So would he.   (To Luiz.)  Where are the halberdiers who were to have had the   honour of meeting us here, that our visit to the Grand Inquisitor   might be made in becoming state?        LUIZ.  Your Grace, the halberdiers are mercenary people who   stipulated for a trifle on account.        DUKE.  How tiresome!  Well, let us hope the Grand Inquisitor   is a blind gentleman.  And the band who were to have had the   honour of escorting us?  I see no band!        LUIZ.  Your Grace, the band are sordid persons who required   to be paid in advance.        DUCH.  That's so like a band!        DUKE (annoyed).  Insuperable difficulties meet me at every   turn!        DUCH.  But surely they know His Grace?        LUIZ.  Exactly—they know His Grace.        DUKE.  Well, let us hope that the Grand Inquisitor is a deaf   gentleman.  A cornet-a-piston would be something.  You do not   happen to possess the accomplishment of tootling like a   cornet-a-piston?        LUIZ.  Alas, no, Your Grace!  But I can imitate a farmyard.        DUKE (doubtfully).  I don't see how that would help us.  I   don't see how we could bring it in.        CAS.  It would not help us in the least.  We are not a   parcel of graziers come to market, dolt!                                                               (Luiz   rises.)        DUKE.  My love, our suite's feelings!  (To Luiz.)  Be so   good as to ring the bell and inform the Grand Inquisitor that his   Grace the Duke of Plaza-Toro, Count Matadoro, Baron Picadoro—        DUCH.  And suite—        DUKE.  And suite—have arrived at Venice, and seek—        CAS.  Desire—        DUCH.  Demand!        DUKE.  And demand an audience.        LUIZ.  Your Grace has but to command.        DUKE (much moved).  I felt sure of it—I felt sure of it!   (Exit Luiz into Ducal Palace.)  And now, my love—(aside to   Duchess)  Shall we tell her?  I think so—(aloud to Casilda)  And   now, my love, prepare for a magnificent surprise.  It is my   agreeable duty to reveal to you a secret which should make you   the happiest young lady in Venice!        CAS.  A secret?        DUCH.  A secret which, for State reasons, it has been   necessary to preserve for twenty years.        DUKE.  When you were a prattling babe of six months old you   were married by proxy to no less a personage than the infant son   and heir of His Majesty the immeasurably wealthy King of   Barataria!        CAS.  Married to the infant son of the King of Barataria?   Was I consulted?  (Duke shakes his head.)  Then it was a most   unpardonable liberty!        DUKE.  Consider his extreme youth and forgive him.  Shortly   after the ceremony that misguided monarch abandoned the creed of   his forefathers, and became a Wesleyan Methodist of the most   bigoted and persecuting type.  The Grand Inquisitor, determined   that the innovation should not be perpetuated in Barataria,   caused your smiling and unconscious husband to be stolen and   conveyed to Venice.  A fortnight since the Methodist Monarch and   all his Wesleyan Court were killed in an insurrection, and we are   here to ascertain the whereabouts of your husband, and to hail   you, our daughter, as Her Majesty, the reigning Queen of   Barataria!  (Kneels.)    (During this speech Luiz re-enters.)         DUCH.  Your Majesty!  (Kneels.) (Drum roll.)        DUKE.  It is at such moments as these that one feels how   necessary it is to travel with a full band.        CAS.  I, the Queen of Barataria!  But I've nothing to wear!   We are practically penniless!        DUKE.  That point has not escaped me.  Although I am   unhappily in straitened circumstances at present, my social   influence is something enormous; and a Company, to be called the   Duke of Plaza-Toro, Limited, is in course of formation to work   me.  An influential directorate has been secured, and I shall   myself join the Board after allotment.        CAS.  Am I to understand that the Queen of Barataria may be   called upon at any time to witness her honoured sire in process   of liquidation?        DUCH.  The speculation is not exempt from that drawback.  If   your father should stop, it will, of course, be necessary to wind   him up.        CAS.  But it's so undignified—it's so degrading!  A Grandee   of Spain turned into a public company!  Such a thing was never   heard of!        DUKE.  My child, the Duke of Plaza-Toro does not follow   fashions—he leads"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/808"],["title","The Complete Plays of Gilbert and Sullivan (#2)"],["body","hem.  He always leads everybody.  When he was   in the army he led his regiment.  He occasionally led them into   action.  He invariably led them out of it.                        SONG—DUKE OF PLAZA-TORO.                   In enterprise of martial kind,                       When there was any fighting,                  He led his regiment from behind—                       He found it less exciting.                  But when away his regiment ran,                       His place was at the fore, O—                            That celebrated,                            Cultivated,                            Underrated                                 Nobleman,                       The Duke of Plaza-Toro!

When, to evade Destruction's hand,                       To hide they all proceeded,                  No soldier in that gallant band                       Hid half as well as he did.                  He lay concealed throughout the war,                       And so preserved his gore, O!                            That unaffected,                            Undetected,                            Well-connected                                 Warrior,                       The Duke of Plaza-Toro!

When told that they would all be shot                       Unless they left the service,                  That hero hesitated not,                       So marvellous his nerve is.                  He sent his resignation in,                       The first of all his corps, O!                            That very knowing,                            Overflowing,                            Easy-going                                 Paladin,                       The Duke of Plaza-Toro!

O rapture, when alone together                  Two loving hearts and those that bear them             May join in temporary tether,                  Though Fate apart should rudely tear them.    CAS.      Necessity, Invention's mother,                  Compelled me to a course of feigning—             But, left alone with one another,                  I will atone for my disdaining!                                   AIR    CAS.                     Ah, well-beloved,                            Mine angry frown                            Is but a gown                            That serves to dress                            My gentleness!    LUIZ.                    Ah, well-beloved,                            Thy cold disdain,                            It gives no pain—                            'Tis mercy, played                            In masquerade!    BOTH.                    Ah, well-beloved, etc.         CAS.  O Luiz, Luiz—what have you said?  What have I done?   What have I allowed you to do?        LUIZ.  Nothing, I trust, that you will ever have reason to   repent.  (Offering to embrace her.)        CAS. (withdrawing from him).  Nay, Luiz, it may not be.  I   have embraced you for the last time.        LUIZ (amazed).  Casilda!        CAS.  I have just learnt, to my surprise and indignation,   that I was wed in babyhood to the infant son of the King of   Barataria!        LUIZ.  The son of the King of Barataria?  The child who was   stolen in infancy by the Inquisition?        CAS.  The same.  But, of course, you know his story.        LUIZ.  Know his story?  Why, I have often told you that my   mother was the nurse to whose charge he was entrusted!        CAS.  True.  I had forgotten.  Well, he has been discovered,   and my father has brought me here to claim his hand.        LUIZ.  But you will not recognize this marriage?  It took   place when you were too young to understand its import.        CAS.  Nay, Luiz, respect my principles and cease to torture   me with vain entreaties.  Henceforth my life is another's.        LUIZ.  But stay—the present and the future—they are   another's; but the past—that at least is ours, and none can take   it from us.  As we may revel in naught else, let us revel in   that!        CAS.  I don't think I grasp your meaning.        LUIZ.  Yet it is logical enough.  You say you cease to love   me?        CAS. (demurely).  I say I may not love you.        LUIZ.  Ah, but you do not say you did not love me?        CAS.  I loved you with a frenzy that words are powerless to   express—and that but ten brief minutes since!        LUIZ.  Exactly.  My own—that is, until ten minutes since,   my own—my lately loved, my recently adored—tell me that until,   say a quarter of an hour ago, I was all in all to thee!   (Embracing her.)        CAS.  I see your idea.  It's ingenious, but don't do that.   (Releasing herself.)        LUIZ.  There can be no harm in revelling in the past.        CAS.  None whatever, but an embrace cannot be taken to act   retrospectively.        LUIZ.  Perhaps not!        CAS.  We may recollect an embrace—I recollect many—but we   must not repeat them.        LUIZ.  Then let us recollect a few!  (A moment's pause, as   they recollect, then both heave a deep sigh.)        LUIZ.  Ah, Casilda, you were to me as the sun is to the   earth!        CAS.  A quarter of an hour ago?        LUIZ.  About that.        CAS.  And to think that, but for this miserable discovery,   you would have been my own for life!        LUIZ.  Through life to death—a quarter of an hour ago!        CAS.  How greedily my thirsty ears would have drunk the   golden melody of those sweet words a quarter—well, it's now   about twenty minutes since.  (Looking at her watch.)        LUIZ.  About that.  In such a matter one cannot be too   precise.        CAS.  And now our love, so full of life, is but a silent,   solemn memory!        LUIZ.  Must it be so, Casilda?        CAS.  Luiz, it must be so!                         DUET—CASILDA and LUIZ.    LUIZ.          There was a time—                       A time for ever gone—ah, woe is me!                  It was no crime                       To love but thee alone—ah, woe is me!                  One heart, one life, one soul,                       One aim, one goal—                  Each in the other's thrall,                       Each all in all, ah, woe is me!    BOTH.     Oh, bury, bury—let the grave close o'er             The days that were—that never will be more!             Oh, bury, bury love that all condemn,             And let the whirlwind mourn its requiem!    CAS.           Dead as the last year's leaves—                       As gathered flowers—ah, woe is me!                  Dead as the garnered sheaves,                       That love of ours—ah, woe is me!                  Born but to fade and die                       When hope was high,                  Dead and as far away                       As yesterday!—ah, woe is me!    BOTH.     Oh, bury, bury—let the grave close o'er, etc.    (Re-enter from the Ducal Palace the Duke and Duchess, followed by   Don Alhambra del Bolero, the Grand Inquisitor.)         DUKE.

It was   His Distinction who so thoughtfully abstracted your infant   husband and brought him to Venice.        DON AL.  So this is the little lady who is so unexpectedly   called upon to assume the functions of Royalty!  And a very nice   little lady, too!        DUKE.  Jimp, isn't she?        DON AL.  Distinctly jimp.  Allow me!  (Offers his hand.  She   turns away scornfully.)  Naughty temper!        DUKE.  You must make some allowance.  Her Majesty's head is   a little turned by her access of dignity.        DON AL.  I could have wished that Her Majesty's access of   dignity had turned it in this direction.        DUCH.  Unfortunately, if I am not mistaken, there appears to   be some little doubt as to His Majesty's whereabouts.        CAS. (aside).  A doubt as to his whereabouts?  Then we may   yet be saved!        DON AL.  A doubt?  Oh dear, no—no doubt at all!  He is   here, in Venice, plying the modest but picturesque calling of a   gondolier.  I can give you his address—I see him every day!  In   the entire annals of our history there is absolutely no   circumstance so entirely free from all manner of doubt of any   kind whatever!  Listen, and I'll tell you all about it.                           SONG—DON ALHAMBRA               (with DUKE, DUCHESS, CASILDA, and LUIZ).         I stole the Prince, and I brought him here,             And left him gaily prattling        With a highly respectable gondolier,        Who promised the Royal babe to rear,        And teach him the trade of a timoneer             With his own beloved bratling.                   Both of the babes were strong and stout,                       And, considering all things, clever.                  Of that there is no manner of doubt—                  No probable, possible shadow of doubt—"]]]
