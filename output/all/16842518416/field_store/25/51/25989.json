Why doth not Skarl forsake his drumming, and MANA cease to rest?\" and the echo of seven deserts answered: \"Who knows? Who knows?\"  But out in the waste, beyond the seven deserts where Ranorada looms enormous in the dusk, at evening his prayer was heard; and from the rim of the waste whither had gone his prayer, came three flamingoes flying, and their voices said: \"Going South, Going South\" at every stroke of their wings.  But as they passed by the prophet they seemed so cool and free and the desert so blinding and hot that he stretched up his arms towards them. Then it seemed happy to fly and pleasant to follow behind great white wings, and he was with the three flamingoes up in the cool above the desert, and their voices cried before him: \"Going South, Going South,\" and the desert below him mumbled: \"Who knows? Who knows?\"  Sometimes the earth stretched up towards them with peaks of mountains, sometimes it fell away in steep ravines, blue rivers sang to them as they passed above them, or very faintly came the song of breezes in lone orchards, and far away the sea sang mighty dirges of old forsaken isles. But it seemed that in all the world there was nothing only to be going South.  It seemed that somewhere the South was calling to her own, and that they were going South.  But when the prophet saw that they had passed above the edge of Earth, and that far away to the North of them lay the Moon, he perceived that he was following no mortal birds but some strange messengers of Hoodrazai whose nest had lain in one of Pegana's vales below the mountains whereon sit the gods.  Still they went South, passing by all the Worlds and leaving them to the North, till only Araxes, Zadres, and Hyraglion lay still to the South of them, where great Ingazi seemed only a point of light, and Yo and Mindo could be seen no more.  Still they went South till they passed below the South and came to the Rim of the Worlds.  There there is neither South nor East nor West, but only North and Beyond; there is only North of it where lie the Worlds, and Beyond it where lies the Silence, and the Rim is a mass of rocks that were never used by the gods when They made the Worlds, and on it sat Trogool. Trogool is the Thing that is neither god nor beast, who neither howls nor breathes, only _It_ turns over the leaves of a great book, black and white, black and white for ever until THE END.  And all that is to be is written in the book is also all that was.  When _It_ turneth a black page it is night, and when _It_ turneth a white page it is day.  Because it is written that there are gods--there are the gods.  Also there is writing about thee and me until the page where our names no more are written.  Then as the prophet watched _It_, Trogool turned a page--a black one, and night was over, and day shone on the Worlds.  Trogool is the Thing that men in many countries have called by many names, _It_ is the Thing that sits behind the gods, whose book is the Scheme of Things.  But when Yadin saw that old remembered days were hidden away with the part that _It_ had turned, and knew that upon one whose name is writ no more the last page had turned for ever a thousand pages back. Then did he utter his prayer in the fact of Trogool who only turns the pages and never answers prayer. He prayed in the face of Trogool: \"Only turn back thy pages to the name of one which is writ no more, and far away upon a place named Earth shall rise the prayers of a little people that acclaim the name of Trogool, for there is indeed far off a place called Earth where men shall pray to Trogool.\"  Then spake Trogool who turns the pages and never answers prayer, and his voice was like the murmurs of the waste at night when echoes have been lost: \"Though the whirlwind of the South should tug with his claws at a page that hath been turned yet shall he not be able to ever turn it back.\"  Then because of words in the book that said that it should be so, Yadin found himself lying in the desert where one gave him water, and afterwards carried him on a camel into Bodrahan.  There some said that he had but dreamed when thirst seized him while he wandered among the rocks in the desert. But certain aged men of Bodrahan say that indeed there sitteth somewhere a Thing that is called Trogool, that is neither god nor beast, that turneth the leaves of a book, black and white, black and white, until he come to the words: _Mai Doon Izahn_, which means The End For Ever, and book and gods and worlds shall be no more.    YONATH THE PROPHET   Yonath was the first among prophets who uttered unto men.  These are the words of Yonath, the first among all prophets:  There be gods upon Pegana.  Upon a night I slept. And in my sleep Pegana came very near. And Pegana was full of gods.  I saw the gods beside me as one might see wonted things.  Only I saw not MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI.  And in that hour, in the hour of my sleep, I knew.  And the end and the beginning of my knowing, and all of my knowing that there was, was this--that Man Knoweth Not.  Seek thou to find at night the utter edge of the darkness, or seek to find the birthplace of the rainbow where he leapeth upward from the hills, only seek not concerning the wherefore of the making of the gods.  The gods have set a brightness upon the farther side of the Things to Come that they may appear more felititous to men than the Things that Are.  To the gods the Things to Come are but as the Things that Are, and nothing altereth in Pegana.  The gods, although not merciful, are not ferocious gods. They are the destroyers of the Days that Were, but they set a glory about the Days to Be.  Man must endure the Days that Are, but the gods have left him his ignorance as a solace.  Seek not to know. Thy seeking will weary thee, and thou wilt return much worn, to rest at last about the place from whence thou settest out upon thy seeking.  Seek not to know. Even I, Yonath, the oldest prophet, burdened with the wisdom of great years, and worn with seeking, know only that man knoweth not.  Once I set out seeking to know all things. Now I know one thing only, and soon the Years will carry me away.  The path of my seeking, that leadeth to seeking again, must be trodden by very many more, when Yonath is no longer even Yonath.  Set not thy foot upon that path.  Seek not to know.  These be the Words of Yonath.    YUG THE PROPHET   When the Years had carries away Yonath, and Yonath was dead, there was no longer a prophet among men.  And still men sought to know.  Therefore they said unto Yug: \"Be thou our prophet, and know all things, and tell us concerning the wherefore of It All.\"  And Yug said: \"I know all things.\" And men were pleased.  And Yug said of the Beginning that it was in Yug's own garden, and of the End that it was in the sight of Yug.  And men forgot Yug.  One day Yug saw Mung behind the hills making the sign of Mung. And Yug was Yug no more.    ALHIRETH-HOTEP THE PROPHET   When Yug was Yug no more men said unto Alhireth-Hotep: \"Be thou our prophet, and be as wise as Yug.\"  And Alhireth-Hotep said: \"I am as wise as Yug.\" And men were very glad.  And Alhireth-Hotep said of Life and Death: \"These be the affairs of Alhireth-Hotep.\" And men brought gifts to him.  One day Alhireth-Hotep wrote in a book: \"Alhireth-Hotep knoweth All Things, for he hath spoken with Mung.\"  And Mung stepped from behind him, making the sign of Mung, saying: \"Knowest thou All Things, then, Alhireth-Hotep?\" And Alhireth-Hotep became among the Things that Were.    KABOK THE PROPHET  When Alhireth-Hotep was among the Things that Were, and still men sought to know, they said unto Kabok: \"Be thou as wise as was Alhireth-Hotep.\"  And Kabok grew wise in his own sight and in the sight of men.  And Kabok said: \"Mung maketh his signs against men or withholdeth it by the advice of Kabok.\"  And he said unto one: \"Thou hast sinned against Kabok, therefore will Mung make the sign of Mung against thee.\" And to another: \"Thou has brought Kabok gifts, therefore shall Mung forbear to make against thee the sign of Mung.\"  One night as Kabok fattened upon the gifts that men had brought him he heard the tread of Mung treading in the garden of Kabok about his house at night.  And because the night was very still it seemed most evil to Kabok that Mung should be treading in his garden, without the advice of Kabok, about his house at night.  And Kabok, who knew All Things, grew afraid, for the treading was very loud and the night still, and he knew not what lay behind the back of Mung, which none had ever seen.  But when the morning grew to brightness, and there was light upon the Worlds, and Mung trod no longer in the garden, Kabok forgot his fears, and said: \"Perhaps it was but a herd of cattle that stampeded in the garden of Kabok.\"  And Kabok went about his business, which was that of knowing All Things, and telling All Things unto men, and making light of Mung.  But that night Mung trod again in the garden of Kabok, about his house at night, and stood before the window of the house like a shadow standing erect, so that Kabok knew indeed that it was Mung.  And a great fear fell upon the throat of Kabok, so that his speech was hoarse; and he cried out: \"Thou art Mung!\"  And Mung slightly inclined his head, and went on to tread in the garden of Kabok, about his house at night.  And Kabok lay and listened with horror at his heart.  But when the second morning grew to brightness, and there was light upon the Worlds, Mung went from treading in the garden of Kabok; and for a little while Kabok hoped, but looked with great dread for the coming of the third night.  And when the third night was come, and the bat had gone to his home, and the wind had sank, the night was very still.  And Kabok lay and listened, to whom the wings of the night flew very slow.  But, ere night met the morning upon the highway between Pegana and the Worlds,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8395"],["title","The Gods of Pegana (#5)"],["body"," there came the tread of Mung in the garden of Kabok towards Kabok's door.  And Kabok fled out of his house as flees a hunted beast and flung himself before Mung.  And Mung made the sign of Mung, pointing towards THE END.  And the fears of Kabok had rest from troubling Kabok any more, for they and he were among accomplished things.    OF THE CALAMITY THAT BEFEL YUN-ILARA BY THE SEA, AND OF THE BUILDING OF THE TOWER OF THE ENDING OF DAYS   When Kabok and his fears had rest the people sought a prophet who should have no fear of Mung, whose hand was against the prophets.  And at last they found Yun-Ilara, who tended sheep and had no fear of Mung, and the people brought him to the town that he might be their prophet.  And Yun-Ilara builded a tower towards the sea that looked upon the setting of the Sun. And he called it the Tower of the Ending of Days.  And about the ending of the day would Yun-Ilara go up to his tower's top and look towards the setting of the Sun to cry his curses against Mung, crying: \"O Mung! whose hand is against the Sun, whom men abhor but worship because they fear thee, here stands and speaks a man who fears thee not. Assassin lord of murder and dark things, abhorrent, merciless, make thou the sign of Mung against me when thou wilt, but until silence settles upon my lips, because of the sign of Mung, I will curse Mung to his face.\" And the people in the street below would gaze up with wonder towards Yun-Ilara, who had no fear of Mung, and brought him gifts; only in their homes after the falling of the night would they pray again with reverence to Mung. But Mung said: \"Shall a man curse a god?\"  And still Mung came not nigh to Yun-Ilara as he cried his curses against Mung from his tower towards the sea.  And Sish throughout the Worlds hurled Time away, and slew the Hours that had served him well, and called up more out of the timeless waste that lieth beyond the Worlds, and drave them forth to assail all things. And Sish cast a whiteness over the hairs of Yun-Ilara, and ivy about his tower, and weariness over his limbs, for Mung passed by him still.  And when Sish became a god less durable to Yun-Ilara than ever Mung hath been he ceased at last to cry from his tower's top his curses against Mung whenever the sun went down, till there came the day when weariness of the gift of Kib fell heavily upon Yun-Ilara.  Then from the tower of the Ending of Days did Yun-Ilara cry out thus to Mung, crying: \"O Mung! O loveliest of the gods! O Mung, most dearly to be desired! thy gift of Death is the heritage of Man, with ease and rest and silence and returning to the Earth. Kib giveth but toil and trouble; and Sish, he sendeth regrets with each of his hours wherewith he assails the World. Yoharneth-Lahai cometh nigh no more. I can no longer be glad with Limpang-Tung. When the other gods forsake him a man hath only Mung.\"  But Mung said: \"Shall a man curse a god?\"  And every day and all night long did Yun-Ilara cry aloud: \"Ah, now for the hour of the mourning of many, and the pleasant garlands of flowers and the tears, and the moist, dark earth. Ah, for repose down underneath the grass, where the firm feet of the trees grip hold upon the world, where never shall come the wind that now blows through my bones, and the rain shall come warm and trickling, not driven by storm, where is the easeful falling asunder of bone from bone in the dark.\" Thus prayed Yun-Ilara, who had cursed in his folly and youth, while never heeded Mung.  Still from a heap of bones that are Yun-Ilara still, lying about the ruined base of the tower that once he builded, goes up a shrill voice with the wind crying out for the mercy of Mung, if any such there be.    OF HOW THE GODS WHELMED SIDITH   There was dole in the valley of Sidith. For three years there had been pestilence, and in the last of the three a famine; moreover, there was imminence of war.  Throughout all Sidith men died night and day, and night and day within the Temple of All the gods save One (for none may pray to MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI) did the priests of the gods pray hard.  For they said: \"For a long while a man may hear the droning of little insects and yet not be aware that he hath heard them, so may the gods not hear our prayers at first until they have been very oft repeated. But when your praying has troubled the silence long it may be that some god as he strolls in Pegana's glades may come on one of our lost prayers, that flutters like a butterfly tossed in storm when all its wings are broken; then if the gods be merciful they may ease our fears in Sidith, or else they may crush us, being petulant gods, and so we shall see trouble in Sidith no longer, with its pestilence and dearth and fears of war.\"  But in the fourth year of the pestilence and in the second year of the famine, and while still there was imminence of war, came all the people of Sidith to the door of the Temple of All the gods save One, where none may enter but the priests--but only leave gifts and go.  And there the people cried out: \"O High Prophet of All the gods save One, Priest of Kib, Priest of Sish, and Priest of Mung, Teller of the mysteries of Dorozhand, Receiver of the gifts of the People, and Lord of Prayer, what doest thou within the Temple of All the gods save One?\"  And Arb-Rin-Hadith, who was the High Prophet, answered: \"I pray for all the People.\"  But the people answered: \"O High Prophet of All the gods save One, Priest of Kib, Priest of Sish, and Priest of Mung, Teller of the mysteries of Dorozhand, Receiver of the gifts of the People, and Lord of Prayer, for four long years hast thou prayed with the priests of all thine order, while we brought ye gifts and died. Now, therefore, since They have not heard thee in four grim years, thou must go and carry to Their faces the prayer of the people of Sidith when They go to drive the thunder to his pasture upon the mountain Aghrinaun, or else there shall no longer be gifts upon thy temple door, whenever falls the dew, that thou and thine order may fatten.  \"Then thou shalt say before Their faces: 'O All the gods save One, Lords of the Worlds, whose child is the eclipse, take back thy pestilence from Sidith, for ye have played the game of the gods too long with the people of Sidith, who would fain have done with the gods'.\"  Then in great fear answered the High Prophet, saying: \"What if the gods be angry and whelm Sidith?\" And the people answered: \"Then are we sooner done with pestilence and famine and the imminence of war.\"  That night the thunder howled upon Aghrinaun, which stood a peak above all others in the land of Sidith. And the people took Arb-Rin-Hadith from his Temple and drave him to Aghrinaun, for they said: \"There walk to-night upon the mountain All the gods save One.\"  And Arb-Rin-Hadith went trembling to the gods.  Next morning, white and frightened from Aghrinaun, came Arb-Rin-Hadith back into the valley, and there spake to the people, saying: \"The faces of the gods are iron and their mouths set hard. There is no hope from the gods.\"  Then said the people: \"Thou shalt go to MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI, to whom no man may pray: seek him upon Aghrinaun where it lifts clear into the stillness before morning, and on its summit, where all things seem to rest surely there rests also MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI. Go to him, and say: 'Thou hast made evil gods, and They smite Sidith.' Perchance he hath forgotten all his gods, or hath not heard of Sidith. Thou hast escaped the thunder of the gods, surely thou shalt also escape the stillness of MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI.\"  Upon a morning when the sky and lakes were clear and the world still, and Aghrinaun was stiller than the world, Arb-Rin-Hadith crept in fear towards the slopes of Aghrinaun because the people were urgent.  All that day men saw him climbing. At night he rested near the top. But ere the morning of the day that followed, such as rose early saw him in the silence, a speck against the blue, stretch up his arms upon the summit to MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI. Then instantly they saw him not, nor was he ever seen of men again who had dared to trouble the stillness of MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI.  Such as now speak of Sidith tell of a fierce and potent tribe that smote away a people in a valley enfeebled by pestilence, where stood a temple to \"All the gods save One\" in which was no high priest.    OF HOW IMBAUN BECAME HIGH PROPHET IN ARADEC OF ALL THE GODS SAVE ONE   Imbaun was to be made High Prophet in Aradec, of All the Gods save One.  From Ardra, Rhoodra, and the lands beyond came all High Prophets of the Earth to the Temple in Aradec of All the gods save One.  And then they told Imbaun how The Secret of Things was upon the summit of the dome of the Hall of Night, but faintly writ, and in an unknown tongue.  Midway in the night, between the setting and the rising sun, they led Imbaun into the Hall of Night, and said to him, chaunting altogether: \"Imbaun, Imbaun, Imbaun, look up to the roof, where is writ The Secret of Things, but faintly, and in an unknown tongue.\"  And Imbaun looked up, but darkness was so deep within the Hall of Night that Imbaun saw not even the High Prophets who came from Ardra, Rhoodra, and the lands beyond, nor saw he aught in the Hall of Night at all.  Then called the High Prophets: \"What seest thou, Imbaun?\"  And Imbaun said: \"I see naught.\"  Then called the High Prophets: \"What knowest thou Imbaun?\"  And Imbaun said: \"I know naught.\"  Then spake the High Prophet of Eld of All the gods save One, who is first on Earth of prophets: \"O Imbaun! we have all looked upwards in the Hall of Night towards the secret of Things, and ever it was dark, and the Secret faint and in an unknown tongue. And now thou knowest what all High Prophets know.\"  And Imbaun answered: \"I know.\"  So Imbaun became High Prophet in Aradec of All the gods save One, and prayed for all the people, who knew not that there was darkness in the Hall of Night or that the secret was writ faint and in an unknown tongue.
