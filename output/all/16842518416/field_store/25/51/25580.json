He was an enlightened Frenchman, and worth fifty of such aristos as you; and he knew better than his officers that he was to be led to an idle slaughter.  Idle--I say idle.  What was France the better, how was Paris the safer, for the senseless butchery of that day? You mutinied against a wiser general than Saint Trochu when you murdered that mutineer.\"  \"Armand Monnier, you are not quite sober to-night, or I would argue with you that question.  But you no doubt are brave: how and why do you take the part of a runaway?\"  \"How and why?  He was my brother, and you own you murdered him: my brother--the sagest head in Paris.  If I had listened to him, I should not be,--bah!--no matter now what I am.\"  \"I could not know he was your brother; but if he had been mine I would have done the same.\"  Here Victor's lip quivered, for Monnier griped him by the arm, and looked him in the face with wild stony eyes.  \"I recollect that voice!  Yet-- yet--you say you are a noble, a Vicomte--Victor de Mauleon, and you shot my brother!\"  Here he passed his left hand rapidly over his forehead.  The fumes of wine still clouded his mind, but rays of intelligence broke through the cloud.  Suddenly he said in a loud, and calm, and natural voice:  \"Mons. le Vicomte, you accost me as Armand Monnier--pray how do you know my name?\"  \"How should I not know it?  I have looked into the meetings of the 'Clubs rouges.'  I have heard you speak, and naturally asked your name.  _Bon soir_ M. Monnier!  When you reflect in cooler moments, you will see that if patriots excuse Brutus for first dishonouring and then executing his own son, an officer charged to defend his country may be surely pardoned for slaying a runaway to whom he was no relation, when in slaying he saved the man's name and kindred from dishonour--unless, indeed, you insist on telling the world why he was slain.\"  \"I know your voice--I know it.  Every sound becomes clearer to my ear. And if--\"  But while Monnier thus spoke, De Mauleon had hastened on.  Monnier looked round, saw him gone, but did not pursue.  He was just intoxicated enough to know that his footsteps were not steady, and he turned back to the wine-shop and asked surlily for more wine.  Could you have seen him then as he leant swinging himself to and fro against the wall,--had you known the man two years ago, you would have been a brute if you felt disgust. You could only have felt that profound compassion with which we gaze on a great royalty fallen.  For the grandest of all royalties is that which takes its crown from Nature, needing no accident of birth.  And Nature made the mind of Armand Monnier king-like; endowed it with lofty scorn of meanness and falsehood and dishonour, with warmth and tenderness of heart which had glow enough to spare from ties of kindred and hearth and home, to extend to those distant circles of humanity over which royal natures would fain extend the shadow of their sceptre.  How had the royalty of the man's nature fallen thus?  Royalty rarely falls from its own constitutional faults.  It falls when, ceasing to be royal, it becomes subservient to bad advisers.  And what bad advisers, always appealing to his better qualities and so enlisting his worser, had discrowned this mechanic?  \"A little knowledge is a dangerous thing,\" says the old-fashioned poet.  \"Not so,\" says the modern philosopher; \"a little knowledge; is safer than no knowledge.\"  Possibly, as all individuals and all communities must go through the stage of a little knowledge before they can arrive at that of much knowledge, the philosopher's assertion may be right in the long-run, and applied to humankind in general.  But there is a period, as there is a class, in which a little knowledge tends to terrible demoralisation. And Armand Monnier lived in that period and was one of that class.  The little knowledge that his mind, impulsive and ardent, had picked up out of books that warred with the great foundations of existing society, had originated in ill advices.  A man stored with much knowledge would never have let Madame de Grantmesnil's denunciations of marriage rites, or Louis Blane's vindication of Robespierre as the representative of the working against the middle class, influence his practical life.  He would have assessed such opinions at their real worth; and whatever that worth might seem to him, would not to such opinions have committed the conduct of his life.  Opinion is not fateful: conduct is.  A little knowledge crazes an earnest, warm-blooded, powerful creature like Armand Monnier into a fanatic.  He takes an opinion which pleases him as a revelation from the gods; that opinion shapes his conduct; that conduct is his fate. Woe to the philosopher who serenely flings before the little knowledge of the artisan dogmas as harmless as the Atlantis of Plato if only to be discussed by philosophers, and deadly as the torches of Ate if seized as articles of a creed by fanatics!  But thrice woe to the artisan who makes himself the zealot of the Dogma!  Poor Armand acts on the opinions he adopts; proves his contempt for the marriage state by living with the wife of another; resents, as natures so inherently manly must do, the Society that visits on her his defiance of its laws; throws himself, head foremost, against that society altogether; necessarily joins all who have other reasons for hostility to Society; he himself having every inducement not to join indiscriminate strikes--high wages, a liberal employer, ample savings, the certainty of soon becoming employer himself.  No; that is not enough to the fanatic: he persists on being dupe and victim.  He, this great king of labour, crowned by Nature, and cursed with that degree of little knowledge which does not comprehend how much more is required before a schoolboy would admit it to be knowledge at all,--he rushes into the maddest of all speculations--that of the artisan with little knowledge and enormous faith--that which intrusts the safety and repose and dignity of life to some ambitious adventurer, who uses his warm heart for the adventurer's frigid purpose, much as the lawyer-government of September used the Communists,--much as, in every revolution of France, a Bertrand has used a Raton--much as, till the sound of the last trumpet, men very much worse than Victor de Mauleon will use men very much better than Armand Monnier, if the Armand Monniers disdain the modesty of an Isaac Newton on hearing that a theorem to which he had given all the strength of his patient intellect was disputed: \"It may be so;\" meaning, I suppose, that it requires a large amount of experience ascertained before a man of much knowledge becomes that which a man of little knowledge is at a jump-the fanatic of an experiment untried.     CHAPTER II.  Scarcely had De Mauleon quitted Lemercier before the latter was joined by two loungers scarcely less famished than himself--Savarin and De Breze. Like himself, too, both had been sufferers from illness, though not of a nature to be consigned to an hospital.  All manner of diseases then had combined to form the pestilence which filled the streets with unregarded hearses--bronchitis, pneumonia, smallpox, a strange sort of spurious dysentery much more speedily fatal than the genuine.  The three men, a year before so sleek, looked like ghosts under the withering sky; yet all three retained embers of the native Parisian humour, which their very breath on meeting sufficed to kindle up into jubilant sparks or rapid flashes.  \"There are two consolations,\" said Savarin, as the friends strolled or rather crawled towards the Boulevards--\"two consolations for the gourmet and for the proprietor in these days of trial for the gourmand, because the price of truffles is come down.\"  \"Truffles!\" gasped De Breze, with watering mouth; \"impossible!  They are gone with the age of gold.\"  \"Not so.  I speak on the best authority--my laundress; for she attends the _succursale_ in the Rue de Chateaudun; and if the poor woman, being, luckily for me, a childless widow, gets a morsel she can spare, she sells it to me.\"  \"Sells it!\" feebly exclaimed Lemercier.  \"Croesus!  you have money then, and can buy?\"  \"Sells it--on credit!  I am to pension her for life if I live to have money again.  Don't interrupt me.  This honest woman goes this morning to the _succursale_.  I promise myself a delicious _bifteck_ of horse.  She gains the _succursale_, and the employee informs her that there is nothing left in his store except--truffles.  A glut of those in the market allows him to offer her a bargain-seven francs _la boite_.  Send me seven francs, De Breze, and you shall share the banquet.\"  De Breze shook his head expressively.  \"But,\" resumed Savarin, \"though credit exists no more except with my laundress, upon terms of which the usury is necessarily proportioned to the risk, yet, as I had the honour before to observe, there is comfort for the proprietor.  The instinct of property is imperishable.\"  \"Not in the house where I lodge,\" said Lemercier.  \"Two soldiers were billeted there; and during my stay in the ambulance they enter my rooms, and cart away all of the little furniture left there, except a bed and a table.  Brought before a court-martial, they defend themselves by saying, 'The rooms were abandoned.'  The excuse was held valid.  They were let off with a reprimand and a promise to restore what was not already disposed of.  They have restored me another table and four chairs.\" \"Nevertheless, they had the instinct of property, though erroneously developed, otherwise"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7748"],["title","The Parisians — Volume 12 (#3)"],["body"," would not have deemed any excuse for their act necessary.  Now for my instance of the inherent tenacity of that instinct.  A worthy citizen in want of fuel sees a door in a garden wall, and naturally carries off the door.  He is apprehended by a gendarme who sees the act.  'Voleur,' he cries to the gendarme, 'do you want to rob me of my property?'  'That door your property?  I saw you take it away.' 'You confess,' cries the citizen, triumphantly--'you confess that it is my property; for you saw me appropriate it.'  Thus you see how imperishable is the instinct of property.  No sooner does it disappear as yours than it reappears as mine.\"  \"I would laugh if I could,\" said Lemercier, \"but such a convulsion would be fatal. _Dieu des dieux_, how empty I am!\"  He reeled as he spoke, and clung to De Breze for support.  De Breze had the reputation of being the most selfish of men.  But at that moment, when a generous man might be excused for being selfish enough to desire to keep the little that he had for his own reprieve from starvation, this egotist became superb. \"Friends,\" he cried, with enthusiasm, \"I have something yet in my pocket; we will dine, all three of us.\"  \"Dine!\" faltered Lemercier.  \"Dine! I have not dined since I left the hospital.  I breakfasted yesterday--on two mice upon toast.  Dainty, but not nutritious.  And I shared them with Fox.\"  \"Fox! Fox lives still, then?\" cried De Breze, startled.  \"In a sort of way he does.  But one mouse since yesterday morning is not much; and he can't expect that every day.\"  \"Why don't you take him out?\" asked Savarin.  \"Give him a chance of picking up a bone somewhere.\"  \"I dare not; he would be picked up himself.  Dogs are getting very valuable: they sell for 50 francs apiece.  Come, De Breze, where are we to dine?\"  \"I and Savarin can dine at the London Tavern upon rat pate or jugged cat. But it would be impertinence to invite a satrap like yourself who has a whole dog in his larder--a dish of 50 francs--a dish for a king.  Adieu, my dear Frederic.  Allons, Savarin.\"  \"I feasted you on better meats than dog when I could afford it,\" said Frederic, plaintively; \"and the first time you invite me you retract the invitation.  Be it so. _Bon appetit_.\"  \"_Bah_!\"  said De Breze, catching Frederic's arm as he turned to depart. \"Of course I was but jesting.  Only another day, when my pockets will be empty, do think what an excellent thing a roasted dog is, and make up your mind while Fox has still some little flesh on his bones.\"  \"Flesh!\" said Savarin, detaining them.  \"Look!  See how right Voltaire was in saying, 'Amusement is the first necessity of civilised man.'  Paris can do without bread Paris still retains Polichinello.\"  He pointed to the puppet-show, round which a crowd, not of children alone, but of men-middle-aged and old-were collected; while sous were dropped into the tin handed round by a squalid boy.  \"And, _mon ami_,\" whispered De Breze to Lemercier, with the voice of a tempting fiend, \"observe how Punch is without his dog.\"  It was true.  The dog was gone,--its place supplied by a melancholy emaciated cat.  Frederic crawled towards the squalid boy.  \"What has become of Punch's dog?\"  \"We ate him last Sunday.  Next Sunday we shall have the cat in a pie,\" said the urchin, with a sensual smack of the lips.  \"O Fox! Fox!\" murmured Frederic, as the three men went slowly down through the darkening streets--the roar of the Prussian guns heard afar, while distinct and near rang the laugh of the idlers round the Punch without a dog.     CHAPTER III.  While De Breze and his friends were feasting at the cafe Anglais, and faring better than the host had promised--for the bill of fare comprised such luxuries as ass, mule, peas, fried potatoes, and champagne (champagne in some mysterious way was inexhaustible during the time of famine)--a very different group had assembled in the rooms of Isaura Cicogna.  She and the Venosta had hitherto escaped the extreme destitution to which many richer persons had been reduced.  It is true that Isaura's fortune placed in the hands of the absent Louvier, and invested in the new street that was to have been, brought no return.  It was true that in that street the Venosta, dreaming of cent. per cent., had invested all her savings.  But the Venosta, at the first announcement of war, had insisted on retaining in hand a small sum from the amount Isaura had received from her \"_roman_,\" that might suffice for current expenses, and with yet more acute foresight had laid in stores of provisions and fuel immediately after the probability of a siege became apparent.  But even the provident mind of the Venosta had never foreseen that the siege would endure so long, or that the prices of all articles of necessity would rise so high.  And meanwhile all resources--money, fuel, provisions--had been largely drawn upon by the charity and benevolence of Isaura, without much remonstrance on the part of the Venosta, whose nature was very accessible to pity.  Unfortunately, too, of late money and provisions had failed to Monsieur and Madame Rameau, their income consisting partly of rents no longer paid, and the profits of a sleeping partnership in the old shop, from which custom had departed; so that they came to share the fireside and meals at the rooms of their son's fiancee with little scruple, because utterly unaware that the money retained and the provisions stored by the Venosta were now nearly exhausted.  The patriotic ardour which had first induced the elder Rameau to volunteer his services as a National Guard had been ere this cooled if not suppressed, first by the hardships of the duty, and then by the disorderly conduct of his associates, and their ribald talk and obscene songs.  He was much beyond the age at which he could be registered.  His son was, however, compelled to become his substitute, though from his sickly health and delicate frame attached to that portion of the National Guard which took no part in actual engagements, and was supposed to do work on the ramparts and maintain order in the city.  In that duty, so opposed to his tastes and habits, Gustave signalised himself as one of the loudest declaimers against the imbecility of the Government, and in the demand for immediate and energetic action, no matter at what loss of life, on the part of all--except the heroic force to which he himself was attached.  Still, despite his military labours, Gustave found leisure to contribute to Red journals, and his contributions paid him tolerably well.  To do him justice, his parents concealed from him the extent of their destitution; they, on their part, not aware that he was so able to assist them, rather fearing that he himself had nothing else for support but his scanty pay as a National Guard.  In fact, of late the parents and son had seen little of each other.  M. Rameau, though a Liberal politician, was Liberal as a tradesman, not as a Red Republican or a Socialist.  And, though little heeding his son's theories while the Empire secured him from the practical effect of them, he was now as sincerely frightened at the chance of the Communists becoming rampant as most of the Parisian tradesmen were.  Madame Rameau, on her side, though she had the dislike to aristocrats which was prevalent with her class, was a stanch Roman Catholic; and seeing in the disasters that had befallen her country the punishment justly incurred by its sins, could not but be shocked by the opinions of Gustave, though she little knew that he was the author of certain articles in certain journals, in which these opinions were proclaimed with a vehemence far exceeding that which they assumed in his conversation.  She had spoken to him with warm anger, mixed with passionate tears, on his irreligious principles; and from that moment Gustave shunned to give her another opportunity of insulting his pride and depreciating his wisdom.  Partly to avoid meeting his parents, partly because he recoiled almost as much from the ennui of meeting the other visitors at her apartments--the Paris ladies associated with her in the ambulance, Raoul de Vandeniar, whom he especially hated, and the Abbe Vertpre, who had recently come into intimate friendship with both the Italian ladies--his visits to Isaura had become exceedingly rare.  He made his incessant military duties the pretext for absenting himself; and now, on this evening, there were gathered round Isaura's hearth--on which burned almost the last of the hoarded fuel--the Venosta, the two Rameaus, the Abbe Vertpre, who was attached as confessor to the society of which Isaura was so zealous a member.  The old priest and the young poetess had become dear friends. There is in the nature of a woman (and especially of a woman at once so gifted and so childlike as Isaura, combining an innate tendency towards faith with a restless inquisitiveness of intellect, which is always suggesting query or doubt) a craving for something afar from the sphere of her sorrow, which can only be obtained through that \"bridal of the earth and sky\" which we call religion.  And hence, to natures like Isaura's, that link between the woman and the priest, which the philosophy of France has never been able to dissever.  \"It is growing late,\" said Madame Rameau; \"I am beginning to feel uneasy. Our dear Isaura is not yet returned.\"  \"You need be under no apprehension,\" said the Abby.  The ladies attached to the ambulance of which she is so tender and zealous a sister incur no risk.  There are always brave men related to the sick and wounded who see to the safe return of the women.  My poor Raoul visits that ambulance daily.  His kinsman, M. de Rochebriant, is there among the wounded.\"  \"Not seriously hurt, I hope,\" said the Venosta; \"not disfigured?  He was so handsome; it is only the ugly warrior whom a scar on the face improves.\"  \"Don't be alarmed, Signora; the Prussian guns spared his face.  His wounds in themselves were not dangerous, but he lost"]]]
