That is the true reason why he consents to our glove-shop.  Raoul belongs, with some other young men of the Faubourg, to a society enrolled under the name of Saint Francois de Sales, for the relief of the poor.  He visits their houses, and is at home by their sickbeds as at their stinted boards.  Nor does he confine his visitations to the limits of our Faubourg; he extends his travels to Montmartre and Belleville.  As to our upper world, he does not concern himself much with its changes.  He says that we have destroyed too much ever to rebuild solidly; and that whatever we do build could be upset any day by a Paris mob, which he declares to be the only institution we have left.  A wonderful fellow is Raoul,--full of mind, though he does little with it; full of heart, which he devotes to suffering humanity, and to a poetic, knightly reverence (not to be confounded with earthly love, and not to be degraded into that sickly sentiment called Platonic affection) for the Comtesse di Rimini, who is six years older than himself, and who is very faithfully attached to her husband, Raoul's intimate friend, whose honour he would guard as his own. It is an episode in the drama of Parisian life, and one not so uncommon as the malignant may suppose.  Di Rimini knows and approves of his veneration; my mother, the best of women, sanctions it, and deems truly that it preserves Raoul safe from all the temptations to which ignobler youth is exposed.  I mention this lest you should imagine there was anything in Raoul's worship of his star less pure than it is.  For the rest, Raoul, to the grief and amazement of that disciple of Voltaire, my respected father, is one of the very few men I know in our circles who is sincerely religious,--an orthodox Catholic,--and the only man I know who practises the religion he professes; charitable, chaste, benevolent; and no bigot, no intolerant ascetic.  His only weakness is his entire submission to the worldly common-sense of his good-for-nothing, covetous, ambitious brother Enguerrand.  I cannot say how I love him for that.  If he had not such a weakness, his excellence would gall me, and I believe I should hate him.\"  Alain bowed his head at this eulogium.  Such had been the character that a few months ago he would have sought as example and model.  He seemed to gaze upon a flattered portrait of himself as he had been.  \"But,\" said Enguerrand, \"I have not come here to indulge in the overflow of brotherly affection.  I come to take you to your relation, the Duchesse of Tarascon.  I have pledged myself to her to bring you, and she is at home on purpose to receive you.\"  \"In that case I cannot be such a churl as to refuse.  And, indeed, I no longer feel quite the same prejudices against her and the Imperialists as I brought from Bretagne.  Shall I order my carriage?\"  \"No; mine is at the door.  Yours can meet you where you will, later. _Allons_.\"     CHAPTER III.  The Duchesse de Tarascon occupied a vast apartment in the Rue Royale, close to the Tuileries.  She held a high post among the ladies who graced the brilliant court of the Empress.  She had survived her second husband the duke, who left no issue, and the title died with him.  Alain and Enguerrand were ushered up the grand staircase, lined with tiers of costly exotics as if for a fete; but in that and in all kinds of female luxury, the Duchesse lived in a state of _fete perpetuelle_.  The doors on the landing-place were screened by heavy portieres of Genoa velvet, richly embroidered in gold with the ducal crown and cipher.  The two salons through which the visitors passed to the private cabinet or boudoir were decorated with Gobelin tapestries, fresh, with a mixture of roseate hues, and depicting incidents in the career of the first emperor; while the effigies of the late duke's father--the gallant founder of a short-lived race figured modestly in the background.  On a table of Russian malachite within the recess of the central window lay, preserved in glass cases, the baton and the sword, the epaulettes and the decorations of the brave Marshal.  On the consoles and the mantelpieces stood clocks and vases of Sevres that could scarcely be eclipsed by those in the Imperial palaces.  Entering the cabinet, they found the Duchesse seated at her writing-table, with a small Skye terrier, hideous in the beauty of the purest breed, nestled at her feet.  This room was an exquisite combination of costliness and comfort,--Luxury at home.  The hangings were of geranium-coloured silk, with double curtains of white satin; near to the writing-table a conservatory, with a white marble fountain at play in the centre, and a trellised aviary at the back.  The walls were covered with small pictures,--chiefly portraits and miniatures of the members of the imperial family, of the late Duc, of his father the Marshal and Madame la Marechale, of the present Duchesse herself, and of some of the principal ladies of the court.  The Duchesse was still in the prime of life.  She had passed her fortieth year, but was so well \"conserved\" that you might have guessed her to be ten years younger.  She was tall; not large, but with rounded figure inclined to _en bon point_; with dark hair and eyes, but fair complexion, injured in effect rather than improved by pearl-powder, and that atrocious barbarism of a dark stain on the eyelids which has of late years been a baneful fashion; dressed,--I am a man, and cannot describe her dress; all I know is that she had the acknowledged fame of the best- dressed subject of France.  As she rose from her seat there was in her look and air the unmistakable evidence of grande dame,--a family likeness in feature to Alain himself, a stronger likeness to the picture of her first cousin (his mother) which was preserved at Rochebriant.  Her descent was indeed from ancient and noble houses.  But to the distinction of race she added that of fashion, crowning both with a tranquil consciousness of lofty position and unblemished reputation.  \"Unnatural cousin!\" she said to Alain, offering her hand to him, with a gracious smile,--\"all this age in Paris, and I see you for the first time.  But there is joy on earth as in heaven over sinners who truly repent.  You repent truly--n'est ce pas?\"  It is impossible to describe the caressing charm which the Duchesse threw into her words, voice, and look.  Alain was fascinated and subdued.  \"Ah, Madame la Duchesse,\" said he, bowing over the fait hand he lightly held, \"it was not sin, unless modesty be a sin, which made a rustic hesitate long before he dared to offer his homage to the queen of the graces.\"  \"Not badly said for a rustic,\" cried Enguerrand; \"eh, Madame?\"  \"My cousin, you are pardoned,\" said the Duchesse.  \"Compliment is the perfume of _gentilhommerie_; and if you brought enough of that perfume from the flowers of Rochebriant to distribute among the ladies at court, you will be terribly the mode there.  Seducer!\"--here she gave the Marquis a playful tap on the cheek, not in a coquettish but in a mother- like familiarity, and looking at him attentively, said: \"Why, you are even handsomer than your father.  I shall be proud to present to their Imperial Majesties so becoming a cousin.  But seat yourselves here, Messieurs, close to my arm-chair, _caussons_.\"  The Duchesse then took up the ball of the conversation.  She talked without any apparent artifice, but with admirable tact; put just the questions about Rochebriant most calculated to please Alain, shunning all that might have pained him; asking him for descriptions of the surrounding scenery, the Breton legends; hoping that the old castle would never be spoiled by modernizing restorations; inquiring tenderly after his aunt, whom she had in her childhood once seen, and still remembered with her sweet, grave face; paused little for replies; then turned to Enguerrand with sprightly small-talk on the topics of the day, and every now and then bringing Alain into the pale of the talk, leading on insensibly until she got Enguerrand himself to introduce the subject of the emperor, and the political troubles which were darkening a reign heretofore so prosperous and splendid.  Her countenance then changed; it became serious, and even grave in its expression.  \"It is true,\" she said, \"that the times grow menacing, menacing not only to the throne, but to order and property and France.  One by one they are removing all the breakwaters which the empire had constructed between the executive and the most fickle and impulsive population that ever shouted 'long live' one day to the man whom they would send to the guillotine the next.  They are denouncing what they call personal government.  Grant that it has its evils; but what would they substitute,--a constitutional monarchy like the English?  That is impossible with universal suffrage and without an hereditary chamber.  The nearest approach to it was the monarchy of Louis Philippe,--we know how sick they became of that.  A republic?--mon Dieu!  composed of Republicans terrified out of their wits at each other.  The moderate men, mimics of the Girondins, with the Reds and the Socialists and the Communists, ready to tear them to pieces.  And then--What then?--the commercialists, the agriculturists, the middle class combining to elect some dictator who will cannonade the mob and become a mimic Napoleon, grafted on a mimic Necker or a mimic Danton. Oh, Messieurs, I am French to the core.  You inheritors of such names must be as French as I am; and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7741"],["title","The Parisians — Volume 05 (#6)"],["body"," you men insist on remaining more useless to France in the midst of her need than I am,--I, a woman who can but talk and weep.\"  The Duchesse spoke with a warmth of emotion which startled and profoundly affected Alain.  He remained silent, leaving it to Enguerrand to answer.  \"Dear Madame,\" said the latter, \"I do not see how either myself or our kinsman can merit your reproach.  We are not legislators.  I doubt if there is a single department in France that would elect us, if we offered ourselves.  It is not our fault if the various floods of revolution leave men of our birth and opinions stranded wrecks of a perished world.  The emperor chooses his own advisers, and if they are bad ones, his Majesty certainly will not ask Alain and me to replace them.\"  \"You do not answer--you evade me,\" said the Duchesse; with a mournful smile.  \"You are too skilled a man of the world, Monsieur Enguerrand, not to know that it is not only legislators and ministers that are necessary to the support of a throne, and the safeguard of a nation.  Do you not see how great a help it is to both throne and nation when that section of public opinion which is represented by names illustrious in history, identified with records of chivalrous deeds and loyal devotion, rallies round the order established?  Let that section of public opinion stand aloof, soured and discontented, excluded from active life, lending no counter-balance to the perilous oscillations of democratic passion, and tell me if it is not an enemy to itself as well as a traitor to the principles it embodies?\"  \"The principles it embodies, Madame,\" said Alain, \"are those of fidelity to a race of kings unjustly set aside, less for the vices than the virtues of ancestors.  Louis XV. was the worst of the Bourbons,--he was the _bien aime_: he escapes.  Louis XVI. was in moral attributes the best of the Bourbons,--he dies the death of a felon.  Louis XVIII., against whom much may be said, restored to the throne by foreign bayonets, reigning as a disciple of Voltaire might reign, secretly scoffing alike at the royalty and the religion which were crowned in his person, dies peacefully in his bed.  Charles X., redeeming the errors of his youth by a reign untarnished by a vice, by a religion earnest and sincere, is sent into exile for defending established order from the very inroads which you lament.  He leaves an heir against whom calumny cannot invent a tale, and that heir remains an outlaw simply because he descends from Henry IV., and has a right to reign.  Madame, you appeal to us as among the representatives of the chivalrous deeds and loyal devotion which characterized the old nobility of France.  Should we deserve that character if we forsook the unfortunate, and gained wealth and honour in forsaking?\"  \"Your words endear you to me.  I am proud to call you cousin,\" said the Duchesse.  \"But do you, or does any man in his senses believe that if you upset the Empire you could get back the Bourbons; that you would not be in imminent danger of a Government infinitely more opposed to the theories on which rests the creed of Legitimists than that of Louis Napoleon?  After all, what is there in the loyalty of you Bourbonites that has in it the solid worth of an argument which can appeal to the comprehension of mankind, except it be the principle of a hereditary monarchy?  Nobody nowadays can maintain the right divine of a single regal family to impose itself upon a nation.  That dogma has ceased to be a living principle; it is only a dead reminiscence.  But the institution of monarchy is a principle strong and vital, and appealing to the practical interests of vast sections of society.  Would you sacrifice the principle which concerns the welfare of millions, because you cannot embody it in the person of an individual utterly insignificant in himself?  In a word, if you prefer monarchy to the hazard of republicanism for such a country as France, accept the monarchy you find, since it is quite clear you cannot rebuild the monarchy you would prefer. Does it not embrace all the great objects for which you call yourself Legitimist?  Under it religion is honoured, a national Church secured, in reality if not in name; under it you have united the votes of millions to the establishment of the throne; under it all the material interests of the country, commercial, agricultural, have advanced with an unequalled rapidity of progress; under it Paris has become the wonder of the world for riches, for splendour, for grace and beauty; under it the old traditional enemies of France have been humbled and rendered impotent. The policy of Richelieu has been achieved in the abasement of Austria; the policy of Napoleon I. has been consummated in the salvation of Europe from the semi-barbarous ambition of Russia.  England no longer casts her trident in the opposition scale of the balance of European power. Satisfied with the honour of our alliance, she has lost every other ally; and her forces neglected, her spirit enervated, her statesmen dreaming believers in the safety of their island, provided they withdraw from the affairs of Europe, may sometimes scold us, but will certainly not dare to fight.  With France she is but an inferior satellite; without France she is--nothing.  Add to all this a court more brilliant than that of Louis XIV., a sovereign not indeed without faults and errors, but singularly mild in his nature, warm-hearted to friends, forgiving to foes, whom personally no one could familiarly know and not be charmed with a _bonte_ of character, lovable as that of Henri IV.,--and tell me what more than all this could you expect from the reign of a Bourbon?\"  \"With such results,\" said Alain, \"from the monarchy you so eloquently praise, I fail to discover what the emperor's throne could possibly gain by a few powerless converts from an unpopular, and you say, no doubt truly, from a hopeless cause.\"  \"I say monarchy gains much by the loyal adhesion of any man of courage, ability, and honour.  Every new monarchy gains much by conversions from the ranks by which the older monarchies were strengthened and adorned. But I do not here invoke your aid merely to this monarchy, my cousin; I demand your devotion to the interests of France; I demand that you should not rest an outlaw from her service.  Ah, you think that France is in no danger, that you may desert or oppose the Empire as you list, and that society will remain safe!  You are mistaken.  Ask Enguerrand.\"  \"Madame,\" said Enguerrand, \"you overrate my political knowledge in that appeal; but, honestly speaking, I subscribe to your reasonings.  I agree with you that the empire sorely needs the support of men of honour; it has one cause of rot which now undermines it,--dishonest jobbery in its administrative departments; even in that of the army, which apparently is so heeded and cared for.  I agree with you that France is in danger, and may need the swords of all her better sons, whether against the foreigner or against her worst enemies,--the mobs of her great towns.  I myself received a military education, and but for my reluctance to separate myself from my father and Raoul, I should be a candidate for employments more congenial to me than those of the Bourse and my trade in the glove- shop.  But Alain is happily free from all family ties, and Alain knows that my advice to him is not hostile to your exhortations.\"  \"I am glad to think he is under so salutary an influence,\" said the Duchesse; and seeing that Alain remained silent and thoughtful, she wisely changed the subject, and shortly afterwards the two friends took leave.     CHAPTER IV.  Three days elapsed before Graham again saw M. Lebeau.  The letter-writer did not show himself at the cafe, and was not to be found at his office, the ordinary business of which was transacted by his clerk, saying that his master was much engaged on important matters that took him from home.  Graham naturally thought that these matters concerned the discovery of Louise Duval, and was reconciled to suspense.  At the cafe, awaiting Lebeau, he had slid into some acquaintance with the ouvrier Armand Monnier, whose face and talk had before excited his interest.  Indeed, the acquaintance had been commenced by the _ouvrier_, who seated himself at a table near to Graham's, and, after looking at him earnestly for some minutes, said, \"You are waiting for your antagonist at dominos, M. Lebeau,--a very remarkable man.\"  \"So he seems.  I know, however, but little of him.  You, perhaps, have known him longer?\"  \"Several months.  Many of your countrymen frequent this cafe, but you do not seem to care to associate with the blouses.\"  \"It is not that; but we islanders are shy, and don't make acquaintance with each other readily.  By the way, since you so courteously accost me, I may take the liberty of saying that I overheard you defend the other night, against one of my countrymen, who seemed to me to talk great nonsense, the existence of le bon Dieu.  You had much the best of it. I rather gathered from your argument that you went somewhat further, and were not too enlightened to admit of Christianity.\"  Armand Monnier looked pleased.  He liked praise; and he liked to hear himself talk, and he plunged at once into a very complicated sort of Christianity,--partly Arian, partly Saint Simonian, with a little of Rousseau and a great deal of Armand Monnier.  Into this we need not follow him; but, in sum, it was a sort of Christianity, the main heads of which consisted in the removal of your neighbour's landmarks, in the right of the poor to appropriate the property of the rich, in the right of love to dispense with marriage, and the duty of the State to provide for any children that might result from such union,--the parents being incapacitated to do so, as whatever they might leave was due to the treasury in common.  Graham listened to these doctrines with melancholy not unmixed with contempt.  \"Are these opinions of"]]]
