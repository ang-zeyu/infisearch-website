CHAPTER I.  The last book closed with the success of the Parisian sortie on the 30th of November, to be followed by the terrible engagements no less honourable to French valour, on the 2nd of December.  There was the sanguine belief that deliverance was at hand; that Trochu would break through the circle of iron, and effect that junction with the army of Aurelles de Paladine which would compel the Germans to raise the investment;--belief rudely shaken by Ducrot's proclamation of the 4th, to explain the recrossing of the Marne, and the abandonment of the positions conquered, but not altogether dispelled till von Moltke's letter to Trochu on the 5th announcing the defeat of the army of the Loire and the recapture of Orleans.  Even then the Parisians did not lose hope of succour; and even after the desperate and fruitless sortie against Le Bourget on the 21st, it was not without witticisms on defeat and predictions of triumph, that Winter and Famine settled sullenly on the city.  Our narrative reopens with the last period of the siege.  It was during these dreadful days, that if the vilest and the most hideous aspects of the Parisian population showed themselves at the worst, so all its loveliest, its noblest, its holiest characteristics-- unnoticed by ordinary observers in the prosperous days of the capital-- became conspicuously prominent.  The higher classes, including the remnant of the old noblesse, had, during the whole siege, exhibited qualities in notable contrast to those assigned them by the enemies of aristocracy.  Their sons had been foremost among those soldiers who never calumniated a leader, never fled before a foe; their women had been among the most zealous and the most tender nurses of the ambulances they had founded and served; their houses had been freely opened, whether to the families exiled from the suburbs, or in supplement to the hospitals.  The amount of relief they afforded unostentatiously, out of means that shared the general failure of accustomed resource, when the famine commenced, would be scarcely credible if stated.  Admirable, too, were the fortitude and resignation of the genuine Parisian bourgeoisie,--the thrifty tradesfolk and small rentiers,--that class in which, to judge of its timidity when opposed to a mob, courage is not the most conspicuous virtue.  Courage became so now--courage to bear hourly increasing privation, and to suppress every murmur of suffering that would discredit their patriotism, and invoke \"peace at any price.\"  It was on this class that the calamities of the siege now pressed the most heavily.  The stagnation of trade, and the stoppage of the rents, in which they had invested their savings, reduced many of them to actual want.  Those only of their number who obtained the pay of one-and-a-half franc a day as National Guards, could be sure to escape from starvation.  But this pay had already begun to demoralise the receivers.  Scanty for supply of food, it was ample for supply of drink.  And drunkenness, hitherto rare in that rank of the Parisians, became a prevalent vice, aggravated in the case of a National Guard, when it wholly unfitted him for the duties he undertook, especially such National Guards as were raised from the most turbulent democracy of the working class.  But of all that population; there were two sections in which the most beautiful elements of our human nature were most touchingly manifest-- the women and the priesthood, including in the latter denomination all the various brotherhoods and societies which religion formed and inspired.  It was on the 27th of December that Frederic Lemercier stood gazing wistfully on a military report affixed to a blank wall, which stated that \"the enemy, worn out by a resistance of over one hundred days,\" had commenced the bombardment.  Poor Frederic was sadly altered; he had escaped the Prussian's guns, but not the Parisian winter--the severest known for twenty years.  He was one of the many frozen at their posts-- brought back to the ambulance with Fox in his bosom trying to keep him warm.  He had only lately been sent forth as convalescent,--ambulances were too crowded to retain a patient longer than absolutely needful,--and had been hunger-pinched and frost-pinched ever since.  The luxurious Frederic had still, somewhere or other, a capital yielding above three thousand a year, and of which he could not now realise a franc, the title-deeds to various investments being in the hands of Duplessis, the most trustworthy of friends, the most upright of men, but who was in Bretagne, and could not be got at.  And the time had come at Paris when you could not get trust for a pound of horse-flesh, or a daily supply of fuel.  And Frederic Lemercier, who had long since spent the 2000 francs borrowed from Alain (not ignobly, but somewhat ostentatiously, in feasting any acquaintance who wanted a feast), and who had sold to any one who could afford to speculate on such dainty luxuries,--clocks, bronzes, amber-mounted pipes,--all that had made the envied garniture of his bachelor's apartment--Frederic Lemercier was, so far as the task of keeping body and soul together, worse off than any English pauper who can apply to the Union.  Of course he might have claimed his half-pay of thirty sous as a National Guard.  But he little knows the true Parisian who imagines a seigneur of the Chaussee d'Antin, the oracle of those with whom he lived, and one who knew life so well that he had preached prudence to a seigneur of the Faubourg like Alain de Rochebriant, stooping to apply for the wages of thirty sons.  Rations were only obtained by the wonderful patience of women, who had children to whom they were both saints and martyrs.  The hours, the weary hours, one had to wait before one could get one's place on the line for the distribution of that atrocious black bread, defeated men,--defeated most wives if only for husbands, were defied only by mothers and daughters.  Literally speaking, Lemercier was starving.  Alain had been badly wounded in the sortie of the 21st, and was laid up in an ambulance.  Even if he could have been got at, he had probably nothing left to bestow upon Lemercier.  Lemercier gazed on the announcement of the bombardment, and the Parisian gaiety, which some French historian of the siege calls _douce philosophie_, lingering on him still, he said, audibly, turning round to any stranger who heard: \"Happiest of mortals that we are!  Under the present Government we are never warned of anything disagreeable that can happen; we are only told of it when it has happened, and then as rather pleasant than otherwise.  I get up.  I meet a civil gendarme.  'What is that firing?  which of our provincial armies is taking Prussia in the rear?  'Monsieur,' says the gendarme, 'it is the Prussian Krupp guns.' I look at the proclamation, and my fears varuish,--my heart is relieved. I read that the bombardment is a sure sign that the enemy is worn out.\"  Some of the men grouped round Frederic ducked their heads in terror; others, who knew that the thunderbolt launched from the plateau of Avron would not fall on the pavements of Paris, laughed and joked.  But in front, with no sign of terror, no sound of laughter, stretched, moving inch by inch, the female procession towards the bakery in which the morsel of bread for their infants was doled out.  \"_Hist, mon ami_,\" said a deep voice beside Lemercier.  \"Look at those women, and do not wound their ears by a jest.\"  Lemercier, offended by that rebuke, though too susceptible to good emotions not to recognise its justice, tried with feeble fingers to turn up his moustache, and to turn a defiant crest upon the rebuker.  He was rather startled to see the tall martial form at his side, and to recognise Victor de Mauleon.  \"Don't you think, M. Lemercier,\" resumed the Vicomte, half sadly, \"that these women are worthy of better husbands and sons than are commonly found among the soldiers whose uniform we wear?\"  \"The National Guard!  You ought not to sneer at them, Vicomte,--you whose troop covered itself with glory on the great days of Villiers and Champigny,--you in whose praise even the grumblers of Paris became eloquent, and in whom a future Marshal of France is foretold.\"  \"But, alas! more than half of my poor troop was left on the battle-field, or is now wrestling for mangled remains of life in the ambulances.  And the new recruits with which I took the field on the 21st are not likely to cover themselves with glory, or to insure their commander the baton of a marshal.\"  \"Ay, I heard when I was in the hospital that you had publicly shamed some of these recruits, and declared that you would rather resign than lead them again to battle.\"  \"True; and at this moment, for so doing, I am the man most hated by the rabble who supplied those recruits.\"  The men, while thus conversing, had moved slowly on, and were now in front of a large cafe, from the interior of which came the sound of loud bravos and clappings of hands. Lemercier's curiosity was excited.  \"For what can be that applause?\" he said; \"let us look in and see.\"  The room was thronged.  In the distance, on a small raised platform, stood a girl dressed in faded theatrical finery, making her obeisance to the crowd.  \"Heavens!\" exclaimed Frederic--\"can I trust my eyes?  Surely that is the once superb Julie: has she been dancing here?\"  One of the loungers, evidently belonging to the same world as Lemercier, overheard the question and answered politely: \"No, Monsieur: she has been reciting verses, and really declaims very well, considering it is not her vocation.  She has given us extracts from Victor Hugo and De Musset: and crowned all with a patriotic hymn by Gustave Rameau,--her old lover, if gossip be true.\"  Meanwhile De Mauleon, who at first had glanced over the scene with his usual air of calm and cold"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7748"],["title","The Parisians â€” Volume 12 (#1)"],["body","ce, became suddenly struck by the girl's beautiful face, and gazed on it with a look of startled surprise.  \"Who and what did you say that poor fair creature is, M. Lemercier?\"  \"She is a Mademoiselle Julie Caumartin, and was a very popular _coryphee_.  She has hereditary right to be a good dancer, as the daughter of a once more famous ornament of the ballet, _la belle_ Leonie --whom you must have seen in your young days.\"  \"Of course.  Leonie--she married a M. Surville, a silly _bourgeois gentilhomme_, who earned the hatred of Paris by taking her off the stage. So that is her daughter  I see no likeness to her mother--much handsomer. Why does she call herself Caumartin?\"  \"Oh,\" said Frederic, \"a melancholy but trite story.\"  \"Leonie was left a widow, and died in want.  What could the poor young daughter do?  She found a rich protector, who had influence to get her an appointment in the ballet: and there she did as most girls so circumstanced do--appeared under an assumed name, which she has since kept.\"  \"I understand,\" said Victor, compassionately.  \"Poor thing! she has quitted the platform, and is coming this way, evidently to speak to you. I saw her eyes brighten as she caught sight of your face.\"  Lemercier attempted a languid air of modest self-complacency as the girl now approached him.  \"_Bonjour_, M. Frederic!  Ah, mon Dieu! how thin you have grown!  You have been ill?\"  \"The hardships of a military life, Mademoiselle.  Ah, for the _beaux fours_ and the peace we insisted on destroying under the Empire which we destroyed for listening to us!  But you thrive well, I trust.  I have seen you better dressed, but never in greater beauty.\"  The girl blushed as she replied, \"Do you really think as you speak?\"  \"I could not speak more sincerely if I lived in the legendary House of Glass.\"  The girl clutched his arm, and said in suppressed tones, \"Where is Gustave?\"  \"Gustave Rameau?  I have no idea.  Do you never see him now?\"  \"Never,--perhaps I never shall see him again; but when you do meet him, say that Julie owes to him her livelihood.  An honest livelihood, Monsieur.  He taught her to love verses--told her how to recite them. I am engaged at this cafe--you will find me here the same hour every day, in case--in case--You are good and kind, and will come and tell me that Gustave is well and happy even if he forgets me. _Au revoir_!  Stop, you do look, my poor Frederic, as if--as if--pardon me, Monsieur Lemercier, is there anything I can do?  Will you condescend to borrow from me?  I am in funds.\"  Lemercier at that offer was nearly moved to tears.  Famished though he was, he could not, however, have touched that girl's earnings.  \"You are an angel of goodness, Mademoiselle!  Ah, how I envy Gustave Rameau!  No, I don't want aid.  I am always a--_rentier_.\"  \"_Bien_!  and if you see Gustave, you will not forget.\"  \"Rely on me.  Come away,\" he said to De Mauleon; \"I don't want to hear that girl repeat the sort of bombast the poets indite nowadays.  It is fustian; and that girl may have a brain of feather, but she has a heart of gold.\"  \"True,\" said Victor, as they regained the street.  \"I overheard what she said to you.  What an incomprehensible thing is a woman! how more incomprehensible still is a woman's love!  Ah, pardon me; I must leave you.  I see in the procession a poor woman known to me in better days.\"  De Mauleon walked towards the woman he spoke of--one of the long procession to the bakery--a child clinging to her robe.  A pale grief- worn woman, still young, but with the weariness of age on her face, and the shadow of death on her child's.  \"I think I see Madame Monnier,\" said De Mauleon, softly.  She turned and looked at him drearily.  A year ago, she would have blushed if addressed by a stranger in a name not lawfully hers.  \"Well,\" she said, in hollow accents broken by cough; \"I don't know you, Monsieur.\"  \"Poor woman!\" he resumed, walking beside her as she moved slowly on, while the eyes of other women in the procession stared at him hungrily. \"And your child looks ill too.  It is your youngest?\"  \"My only one!  The others are in Pere la  Chaise.  There are but few children alive in my street now.  God has been very merciful, and taken them to Himself.\"  De Mauleon recalled the scene of a neat comfortable apartment, and the healthful happy children at play on the floor.  The mortality among the little ones, especially in the quartier occupied by the working classes, had of late been terrible.  The want of food, of fuel, the intense severity of the weather, had swept them off as by a pestilence.  \"And Monnier--what of him?  No doubt he is a National Guard, and has his pay?\"  The woman made no answer, but hung down her head.  She was stifling a sob.  Till then her eyes seemed to have exhausted the last source of tears.  \"He lives still?\" continued Victor, pityingly: \"he is not wounded?\"  \"No: he is well--in health; thank you kindly, Monsieur.\"  \"But his pay is not enough to help you, and of course he can get no work. Excuse me if I stopped you.  It is because I owed Armand Monnier a little debt for work, and I am ashamed to say that it quite escaped my memory in these terrible events.  Allow me, Madame, to pay it to you,\" and he thrust his purse into her hand.  \"I think this contains about the sum I owed; if more or less, we will settle the difference later.  Take care of yourself.\"  He was turning away when the woman caught hold of him.  \"Stay, Monsieur.  May Heaven bless you!--but--but tell me what name I am to give to Armand.  I can't think of any one who owed him money.  It must have been before that dreadful strike, the beginning of all our woes. Ah, if it were allowed to curse any one, I fear my last breath would not be a prayer.\"  \"You would curse the strike, or the master who did not forgive Armand's share in it?\"  \"No, no,--the cruel man who talked him into it--into all that has changed the best workman, the kindest heart--the--the--\" again her voice died in sobs.  \"And who was that man?\" asked De Mauleon, falteringly.  \"His name was Lebeau.  If you were a poor man, I should say 'Shun him.'\"  \"I have heard of the name you mention; but if we mean the same person, Monnier cannot have met him lately.  He has not been in Paris since the siege.\"  \"I suppose not, the coward!  He ruined us--us who were so happy before; and then, as Armand says, cast us away as instruments he had done with. But--but if you do know him, and do see him again, tell him--tell him not to complete his wrong--not to bring murder on Armand's soul.  For Armand isn't what he was--and has become, oh, so violent!  I dare not take this money without saying who gave it.  He would not take money as alms from an aristocrat.  Hush! he beat me for taking money from the good Monsieur Raoul de Vandemar--my poor Armand beat me!\"  De Mauleon shuddered.  \"Say that it is from a customer whose rooms he decorated in his spare hours on his own account before the strike,-- Monsieur --------;\" here he uttered indistinctly some unpronounceable name and hurried off, soon lost as the streets grew darker.  Amid groups of a higher order of men-military men, nobles, _ci-devant_ deputies-- among such ones his name stood very high.  Not only his bravery in the recent sorties had been signal, but a strong belief in his military talents had become prevalent; and conjoined with the name he had before established as a political writer, and the remembrance of the vigour and sagacity with which he had opposed the war, he seemed certain, when peace and order became established, of a brilliant position and career in a future administration: not less because he had steadfastly kept aloof from the existing Government, which it was rumoured, rightly or erroneously, that he had been solicited to join; and from every combination of the various democratic or discontented factions.  Quitting these more distinguished associates, he took his way alone towards the ramparts.  The day was closing; the thunders of the cannon were dying down.  He passed by a wine-shop round which were gathered many of the worse specimens of the _Moblots_ and National Guards, mostly drunk, and loudly talking in vehement abuse of generals and officers and commissariat.  By one of the men, as he came under the glare of a petroleum lamp (there was gas no longer in the dismal city), he was recognised as the commander who had dared to insist on discipline, and disgrace honest patriots who claimed to themselves the sole option between fight and flight.  The man was one of those patriots--one of the new recruits whom Victor had shamed and dismissed for mutiny and cowardice.  He made a drunken plunge at his former chief, shouting, \"A bas Pai-isto!  Comrades, this is the coquin De Mauleon who is paid by the Prussians for getting us killed: a la lanterne!\" \"A la lanterne!\" stammered and hiccupped others of the group; but they did not stir to execute their threat.  Dimly seen as the stern face and sinewy form of the threatened man was by their drowsied eyes, the name of De Mauleon, the man without fear of a foe, and without ruth for a mutineer, sufficed to protect him from outrage; and with a slight movement of his arm that sent his denouncer reeling against the lamp-post, De Mauleon passed on:--when another man, in the uniform of a National Guard, bounded from the door of the tavern, crying with a loud voice, \"Who said De Mauleon?--let me look on him:\" and Victor, who had strode on with slow lion-like steps, cleaving the crowd, turned, and saw before him in the gleaming light a face, in which the bold frank, intelligent aspect of former days was lost in a wild, reckless, savage expression--the face of Armand Monnier.  \"Ha! are you really Victor de Mauleon?\" asked Monnier, not fiercely, but under his breath,--in that sort of stage whisper which is the natural utterance of excited men under the mingled influence of potent drink and hoarded rage.  \"Certainly; I am Victor de Mauleon.\"  \"And you"]]]
