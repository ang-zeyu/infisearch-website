Two gentlemen were awaiting us in the       station—the one a tall, fair man with lion-like hair and beard       and curiously penetrating light blue eyes; the other a small,       alert person, very neat and dapper, in a frock-coat and gaiters,       with trim little side-whiskers and an eye-glass. The latter was       Colonel Ross, the well-known sportsman; the other, Inspector       Gregory, a man who was rapidly making his name in the English       detective service.        “I am delighted that you have come down, Mr. Holmes,” said the       Colonel. “The Inspector here has done all that could possibly be       suggested, but I wish to leave no stone unturned in trying to       avenge poor Straker and in recovering my horse.”        “Have there been any fresh developments?” asked Holmes.        “I am sorry to say that we have made very little progress,” said       the Inspector. “We have an open carriage outside, and as you       would no doubt like to see the place before the light fails, we       might talk it over as we drive.”        A minute later we were all seated in a comfortable landau, and       were rattling through the quaint old Devonshire city. Inspector       Gregory was full of his case, and poured out a stream of remarks,       while Holmes threw in an occasional question or interjection.       Colonel Ross leaned back with his arms folded and his hat tilted       over his eyes, while I listened with interest to the dialogue of       the two detectives. Gregory was formulating his theory, which was       almost exactly what Holmes had foretold in the train.        “The net is drawn pretty close round Fitzroy Simpson,” he       remarked, “and I believe myself that he is our man. At the same       time I recognise that the evidence is purely circumstantial, and       that some new development may upset it.”        “How about Straker’s knife?”        “We have quite come to the conclusion that he wounded himself in       his fall.”        “My friend Dr. Watson made that suggestion to me as we came down.       If so, it would tell against this man Simpson.”        “Undoubtedly. He has neither a knife nor any sign of a wound. The       evidence against him is certainly very strong. He had a great       interest in the disappearance of the favourite. He lies under       suspicion of having poisoned the stable-boy, he was undoubtedly       out in the storm, he was armed with a heavy stick, and his cravat       was found in the dead man’s hand. I really think we have enough       to go before a jury.”        Holmes shook his head. “A clever counsel would tear it all to       rags,” said he. “Why should he take the horse out of the stable?       If he wished to injure it why could he not do it there? Has a       duplicate key been found in his possession? What chemist sold him       the powdered opium? Above all, where could he, a stranger to the       district, hide a horse, and such a horse as this? What is his own       explanation as to the paper which he wished the maid to give to       the stable-boy?”        “He says that it was a ten-pound note. One was found in his       purse. But your other difficulties are not so formidable as they       seem. He is not a stranger to the district. He has twice lodged       at Tavistock in the summer. The opium was probably brought from       London. The key, having served its purpose, would be hurled away.       The horse may be at the bottom of one of the pits or old mines       upon the moor.”        “What does he say about the cravat?”        “He acknowledges that it is his, and declares that he had lost       it. But a new element has been introduced into the case which may       account for his leading the horse from the stable.”        Holmes pricked up his ears.        “We have found traces which show that a party of gypsies encamped       on Monday night within a mile of the spot where the murder took       place. On Tuesday they were gone. Now, presuming that there was       some understanding between Simpson and these gypsies, might he       not have been leading the horse to them when he was overtaken,       and may they not have him now?”        “It is certainly possible.”        “The moor is being scoured for these gypsies. I have also       examined every stable and out-house in Tavistock, and for a       radius of ten miles.”        “There is another training-stable quite close, I understand?”        “Yes, and that is a factor which we must certainly not neglect.       As Desborough, their horse, was second in the betting, they had       an interest in the disappearance of the favourite. Silas Brown,       the trainer, is known to have had large bets upon the event, and       he was no friend to poor Straker. We have, however, examined the       stables, and there is nothing to connect him with the affair.”        “And nothing to connect this man Simpson with the interests of       the Mapleton stables?”        “Nothing at all.”        Holmes leaned back in the carriage, and the conversation ceased.       A few minutes later our driver pulled up at a neat little       red-brick villa with overhanging eaves which stood by the road.       Some distance off, across a paddock, lay a long grey-tiled       out-building. In every other direction the low curves of the       moor, bronze-coloured from the fading ferns, stretched away to       the sky-line, broken only by the steeples of Tavistock, and by a       cluster of houses away to the westward which marked the Mapleton       stables. We all sprang out with the exception of Holmes, who       continued to lean back with his eyes fixed upon the sky in front       of him, entirely absorbed in his own thoughts. It was only when I       touched his arm that he roused himself with a violent start and       stepped out of the carriage.        “Excuse me,” said he, turning to Colonel Ross, who had looked at       him in some surprise. “I was day-dreaming.” There was a gleam in       his eyes and a suppressed excitement in his manner which       convinced me, used as I was to his ways, that his hand was upon a       clue, though I could not imagine where he had found it.        “Perhaps you would prefer at once to go on to the scene of the       crime, Mr. Holmes?” said Gregory.        “I think that I should prefer to stay here a little and go into       one or two questions of detail. Straker was brought back here, I       presume?”        “Yes; he lies upstairs. The inquest is to-morrow.”        “He has been in your service some years, Colonel Ross?”        “I have always found him an excellent servant.”        “I presume that you made an inventory of what he had in his       pockets at the time of his death, Inspector?”        “I have the things themselves in the sitting-room, if you would       care to see them.”        “I should be very glad.” We all filed into the front room and sat       round the central table while the Inspector unlocked a square tin       box and laid a small heap of things before us. There was a box of       vestas, two inches of tallow candle, an A.D.P. briar-root pipe, a       pouch of seal-skin with half an ounce of long-cut Cavendish, a       silver watch with a gold chain, five sovereigns in gold, an       aluminium pencil-case, a few papers, and an ivory-handled knife       with a very delicate, inflexible blade marked Weiss & Co.,       London.        “This is a very singular knife,” said Holmes, lifting it up and       examining it minutely. “I presume, as I see blood-stains upon it,       that it is the one which was found in the dead man’s grasp.       Watson, this knife is surely in your line?”        “It is what we call a cataract knife,” said I.        “I thought so. A very delicate blade devised for very delicate       work. A strange thing for a man to carry with him upon a rough       expedition, especially as it would not shut in his pocket.”        “The tip was guarded by a disk of cork which we found beside his       body,” said the Inspector. “His wife tells us that the knife had       lain upon the dressing-table, and that he had picked it up as he       left the room. It was a poor weapon, but perhaps the best that he       could lay his hands on at the moment.”        “Very possible. How about these papers?”        “Three of them are receipted hay-dealers’ accounts. One of them       is a letter of instructions from Colonel Ross. This other is a       milliner’s account for thirty-seven pounds fifteen made out by       Madame Lesurier, of Bond Street, to William Derbyshire. Mrs.       Straker tells us that Derbyshire was a friend of her husband’s       and that occasionally his letters were addressed here.”        “Madam Derbyshire had somewhat expensive tastes,” remarked       Holmes, glancing down the account. “Twenty-two guineas is rather       heavy for a single costume. However there appears to be nothing       more to learn, and we may now go down to the scene of the crime.”        As we emerged from the sitting-room a woman, who had been waiting       in the passage, took a step forward and laid her hand upon the       Inspector’s sleeve. Her face was haggard and thin and eager,       stamped with the print of a recent horror.        “Have you got them? Have you found them?” she panted.        “No, Mrs. Straker. But Mr. Holmes here has come from London to       help us, and we shall do all that is possible.”        “Surely I met you in Plymouth at a garden-party some little time       ago, Mrs. Straker?” said Holmes.        “No, sir; you are mistaken.”        “Dear me! Why, I could have sworn to it. You wore a costume of       dove-coloured silk with ostrich-feather trimming.”        “I never had such a dress, sir,” answered the lady.        “Ah, that quite settles it,” said Holmes. And with an apology he       followed the Inspector outside. A short walk across the moor took       us to the hollow in which the body had been found."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/834"],["title","The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (#3)"],["body"," At the brink       of it was the furze-bush upon which the coat had been hung.        “There was no wind that night, I understand,” said Holmes.        “None; but very heavy rain.”        “In that case the overcoat was not blown against the furze-bush,       but placed there.”        “Yes, it was laid across the bush.”        “You fill me with interest, I perceive that the ground has been       trampled up a good deal. No doubt many feet have been here since       Monday night.”        “A piece of matting has been laid here at the side, and we have       all stood upon that.”        “Excellent.”        “In this bag I have one of the boots which Straker wore, one of       Fitzroy Simpson’s shoes, and a cast horseshoe of Silver Blaze.”        “My dear Inspector, you surpass yourself!” Holmes took the bag,       and, descending into the hollow, he pushed the matting into a       more central position. Then stretching himself upon his face and       leaning his chin upon his hands, he made a careful study of the       trampled mud in front of him. “Hullo!” said he, suddenly. “What’s       this?” It was a wax vesta half burned, which was so coated with       mud that it looked at first like a little chip of wood.        “I cannot think how I came to overlook it,” said the Inspector,       with an expression of annoyance.        “It was invisible, buried in the mud. I only saw it because I was       looking for it.”        “What! You expected to find it?”        “I thought it not unlikely.”        He took the boots from the bag, and compared the impressions of       each of them with marks upon the ground. Then he clambered up to       the rim of the hollow, and crawled about among the ferns and       bushes.        “I am afraid that there are no more tracks,” said the Inspector.       “I have examined the ground very carefully for a hundred yards in       each direction.”        “Indeed!” said Holmes, rising. “I should not have the       impertinence to do it again after what you say. But I should like       to take a little walk over the moor before it grows dark, that I       may know my ground to-morrow, and I think that I shall put this       horseshoe into my pocket for luck.”        Colonel Ross, who had shown some signs of impatience at my       companion’s quiet and systematic method of work, glanced at his       watch. “I wish you would come back with me, Inspector,” said he.       “There are several points on which I should like your advice, and       especially as to whether we do not owe it to the public to remove       our horse’s name from the entries for the Cup.”        “Certainly not,” cried Holmes, with decision. “I should let the       name stand.”        The Colonel bowed. “I am very glad to have had your opinion,       sir,” said he. “You will find us at poor Straker’s house when you       have finished your walk, and we can drive together into       Tavistock.”        He turned back with the Inspector, while Holmes and I walked       slowly across the moor. The sun was beginning to sink behind the       stables of Mapleton, and the long, sloping plain in front of us       was tinged with gold, deepening into rich, ruddy browns where the       faded ferns and brambles caught the evening light. But the       glories of the landscape were all wasted upon my companion, who       was sunk in the deepest thought.        “It’s this way, Watson,” said he at last. “We may leave the       question of who killed John Straker for the instant, and confine       ourselves to finding out what has become of the horse. Now,       supposing that he broke away during or after the tragedy, where       could he have gone to? The horse is a very gregarious creature.       If left to himself his instincts would have been either to return       to King’s Pyland or go over to Mapleton. Why should he run wild       upon the moor? He would surely have been seen by now. And why       should gypsies kidnap him? These people always clear out when       they hear of trouble, for they do not wish to be pestered by the       police. They could not hope to sell such a horse. They would run       a great risk and gain nothing by taking him. Surely that is       clear.”        “Where is he, then?”        “I have already said that he must have gone to King’s Pyland or       to Mapleton. He is not at King’s Pyland. Therefore he is at       Mapleton. Let us take that as a working hypothesis and see what       it leads us to. This part of the moor, as the Inspector remarked,       is very hard and dry. But it falls away towards Mapleton, and you       can see from here that there is a long hollow over yonder, which       must have been very wet on Monday night. If our supposition is       correct, then the horse must have crossed that, and there is the       point where we should look for his tracks.”        We had been walking briskly during this conversation, and a few       more minutes brought us to the hollow in question. At Holmes’       request I walked down the bank to the right, and he to the left,       but I had not taken fifty paces before I heard him give a shout,       and saw him waving his hand to me. The track of a horse was       plainly outlined in the soft earth in front of him, and the shoe       which he took from his pocket exactly fitted the impression.        “See the value of imagination,” said Holmes. “It is the one       quality which Gregory lacks. We imagined what might have       happened, acted upon the supposition, and find ourselves       justified. Let us proceed.”        We crossed the marshy bottom and passed over a quarter of a mile       of dry, hard turf. Again the ground sloped, and again we came on       the tracks. Then we lost them for half a mile, but only to pick       them up once more quite close to Mapleton. It was Holmes who saw       them first, and he stood pointing with a look of triumph upon his       face. A man’s track was visible beside the horse’s.        “The horse was alone before,” I cried.        “Quite so. It was alone before. Hullo, what is this?”        The double track turned sharp off and took the direction of       King’s Pyland. Holmes whistled, and we both followed along after       it. His eyes were on the trail, but I happened to look a little       to one side, and saw to my surprise the same tracks coming back       again in the opposite direction.        “One for you, Watson,” said Holmes, when I pointed it out. “You       have saved us a long walk, which would have brought us back on       our own traces. Let us follow the return track.”        We had not to go far. It ended at the paving of asphalt which led       up to the gates of the Mapleton stables. As we approached, a       groom ran out from them.        “We don’t want any loiterers about here,” said he.        “I only wished to ask a question,” said Holmes, with his finger       and thumb in his waistcoat pocket. “Should I be too early to see       your master, Mr. Silas Brown, if I were to call at five o’clock       to-morrow morning?”        “Bless you, sir, if any one is about he will be, for he is always       the first stirring. But here he is, sir, to answer your questions       for himself. No, sir, no; it is as much as my place is worth to       let him see me touch your money. Afterwards, if you like.”        As Sherlock Holmes replaced the half-crown which he had drawn       from his pocket, a fierce-looking elderly man strode out from the       gate with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand.        “What’s this, Dawson!” he cried. “No gossiping! Go about your       business! And you, what the devil do you want here?”        “Ten minutes’ talk with you, my good sir,” said Holmes in the       sweetest of voices.        “I’ve no time to talk to every gadabout. We want no strangers       here. Be off, or you may find a dog at your heels.”        Holmes leaned forward and whispered something in the trainer’s       ear. He started violently and flushed to the temples.        “It’s a lie!” he shouted, “an infernal lie!”        “Very good. Shall we argue about it here in public or talk it       over in your parlour?”        “Oh, come in if you wish to.”        Holmes smiled. “I shall not keep you more than a few minutes,       Watson,” said he. “Now, Mr. Brown, I am quite at your disposal.”        It was twenty minutes, and the reds had all faded into greys       before Holmes and the trainer reappeared. Never have I seen such       a change as had been brought about in Silas Brown in that short       time. His face was ashy pale, beads of perspiration shone upon       his brow, and his hands shook until the hunting-crop wagged like       a branch in the wind. His bullying, overbearing manner was all       gone too, and he cringed along at my companion’s side like a dog       with its master.        “Your instructions will be done. It shall all be done,” said he.        “There must be no mistake,” said Holmes, looking round at him.       The other winced as he read the menace in his eyes.        “Oh no, there shall be no mistake. It shall be there. Should I       change it first or not?”        Holmes thought a little and then burst out laughing. “No, don’t,”       said he; “I shall write to you about it. No tricks, now, or—”        “Oh, you can trust me, you can trust me!”        “Yes, I think I can. Well, you shall hear from me to-morrow.” He       turned upon his heel, disregarding the trembling hand which the       other held out to him, and we set off for King’s Pyland.        “A more perfect compound of the bully, coward, and sneak than       Master Silas Brown I have seldom met with,” remarked Holmes as we       trudged along together.        “He has the horse, then?”        “He tried to bluster out of it, but I described to him so exactly       what his actions had been upon that morning that he is convinced       that I was watching him. Of course you observed the peculiarly"]]]
