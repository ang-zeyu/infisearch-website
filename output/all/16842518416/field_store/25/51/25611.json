Oho, oho, staves-acre! why, then, belike, if I were your      man, I should be full of vermin.[70]       WAGNER. So thou shalt, whether thou beest with me or no.  But,      sirrah, leave your jesting, and bind yourself presently unto me      for seven years, or I'll turn all the lice about thee into      familiars,[71] and they shall tear thee in pieces.       CLOWN. Do you hear, sir? you may save that labour; they are too      familiar with me already:  swowns, they are as bold with my flesh      as if they had paid for their[72] meat and drink.       WAGNER. Well, do you hear, sirrah? hold, take these guilders.           [Gives money.]       CLOWN. Gridirons! what be they?       WAGNER. Why, French crowns.       CLOWN. Mass, but for the name of French crowns, a man were as good      have as many English counters.  And what should I do with these?       WAGNER. Why, now, sirrah, thou art at an hour's warning, whensoever      or wheresoever the devil shall fetch thee.       CLOWN. No, no; here, take your gridirons again.       WAGNER. Truly, I'll none of them.       CLOWN. Truly, but you shall.       WAGNER. Bear witness I gave them him.       CLOWN. Bear witness I give them you again.       WAGNER. Well, I will cause two devils presently to fetch thee      away.--Baliol and Belcher!       CLOWN. Let your Baliol and your Belcher come here, and I'll      knock them, they were never so knocked since they were devils:      say I should kill one of them, what would folks say?  \"Do ye see      yonder tall fellow in the round slop?[73] he has killed the devil.\"      So I should be called Kill-devil all the parish over.            Enter two DEVILS; and the CLOWN runs up and down crying.       WAGNER. Baliol and Belcher,--spirits, away!           [Exeunt DEVILS.]       CLOWN. What, are they gone? a vengeance on them! they have vile[74]      long nails.  There was a he-devil and a she-devil:  I'll tell you      how you shall know them; all he-devils has horns, and all      she-devils has clifts and cloven feet.       WAGNER. Well, sirrah, follow me.       CLOWN. But, do you hear? if I should serve you, would you teach      me to raise up Banios and Belcheos?       WAGNER. I will teach thee to turn thyself to any thing, to a dog,      or a cat, or a mouse, or a rat, or any thing.       CLOWN. How! a Christian fellow to a dog, or a cat, a mouse,      or a rat! no, no, sir; if you turn me into any thing, let it be      in the likeness of a little pretty frisking flea, that I may be      here and there and every where:  O, I'll tickle the pretty wenches'      plackets!  I'll be amongst them, i'faith.       WAGNER. Well, sirrah, come.       CLOWN. But, do you hear, Wagner?       WAGNER. How!--Baliol and Belcher!       CLOWN. O Lord!  I pray, sir, let Banio and Belcher go sleep.       WAGNER. Villain, call me Master Wagner, and let thy left eye be      diametarily fixed upon my right heel, with quasi vestigiis      nostris[75] insistere.           [Exit.]       CLOWN. God forgive me, he speaks Dutch fustian.  Well, I'll follow      him; I'll serve him, that's flat.           [Exit.]            FAUSTUS discovered in his study.       FAUSTUS. Now, Faustus, must      Thou needs be damn'd, and canst thou not be sav'd:      What boots it, then, to think of God or heaven?      Away with such vain fancies, and despair;      Despair in God, and trust in Belzebub:      Now go not backward; no, Faustus, be resolute:      Why waver'st thou?  O, something soundeth in mine ears,      \"Abjure this magic, turn to God again!\"      Ay, and Faustus will turn to God again.      To God? he loves thee not;      The god thou serv'st is thine own appetite,      Wherein is fix'd the love of Belzebub:      To him I'll build an altar and a church,      And offer lukewarm blood of new-born babes.            Enter GOOD ANGEL and EVIL ANGEL.       GOOD ANGEL. Sweet Faustus, leave that execrable art.       FAUSTUS. Contrition, prayer, repentance--what of them?       GOOD ANGEL. O, they are means to bring thee unto heaven!       EVIL ANGEL. Rather illusions, fruits of lunacy,      That make men foolish that do trust them most.       GOOD ANGEL. Sweet Faustus, think of heaven and heavenly things.       EVIL ANGEL. No, Faustus; think of honour and of[76] wealth.           [Exeunt ANGELS.]       FAUSTUS. Of wealth!      Why, the signiory of Embden shall be mine.      When Mephistophilis shall stand by me,      What god can hurt thee, Faustus? thou art safe      Cast no more doubts.--Come, Mephistophilis,      And bring glad tidings from great Lucifer;--      Is't not midnight?--come, Mephistophilis,      Veni, veni, Mephistophile!            Enter MEPHISTOPHILIS.       Now tell me[77] what says Lucifer, thy lord?       MEPHIST. That I shall wait on Faustus whilst he lives,[78]      So he will buy my service with his soul.       FAUSTUS. Already Faustus hath hazarded that for thee.       MEPHIST. But, Faustus, thou must bequeath it solemnly,      And write a deed of gift with thine own blood;      For that security craves great Lucifer.      If thou deny it, I will back to hell.       FAUSTUS. Stay, Mephistophilis, and tell me, what good will my soul      do thy lord?       MEPHIST. Enlarge his kingdom.       FAUSTUS. Is that the reason why[79] he tempts us thus?       MEPHIST. Solamen miseris socios habuisse doloris.[80]       FAUSTUS. Why,[81] have you any pain that torture[82] others!       MEPHIST. As great as have the human souls of men.      But, tell me, Faustus, shall I have thy soul?      And I will be thy slave, and wait on thee,      And give thee more than thou hast wit to ask.       FAUSTUS. Ay, Mephistophilis, I give it thee.       MEPHIST. Then, Faustus,[83] stab thine arm courageously,      And bind thy soul, that at some certain day      Great Lucifer may claim it as his own;      And then be thou as great as Lucifer.       FAUSTUS. [Stabbing his arm] Lo, Mephistophilis, for love of thee,      I cut mine arm, and with my proper blood      Assure my soul to be great Lucifer's,      Chief lord and regent of perpetual night!      View here the blood that trickles from mine arm,      And let it be propitious for my wish.       MEPHIST. But, Faustus, thou must      Write it in manner of a deed of gift.       FAUSTUS. Ay, so I will [Writes].  But, Mephistophilis,      My blood congeals, and I can write no more.       MEPHIST. I'll fetch thee fire to dissolve it straight.           [Exit.]       FAUSTUS. What might the staying of my blood portend?      Is it unwilling I should write this bill?[84]      Why streams it not, that I may write afresh?      FAUSTUS GIVES TO THEE HIS SOUL:  ah, there it stay'd!      Why shouldst thou not? is not thy soul shine own?      Then write again, FAUSTUS GIVES TO THEE HIS SOUL.            Re-enter MEPHISTOPHILIS with a chafer of coals.       MEPHIST. Here's fire; come, Faustus, set it on.[85]       FAUSTUS. So, now the blood begins to clear again;      Now will I make an end immediately.           [Writes.]       MEPHIST. O, what will not I do to obtain his soul?           [Aside.]       FAUSTUS. Consummatum est; this bill is ended,      And Faustus hath bequeath'd his soul to Lucifer.      But what is this inscription[86] on mine arm?      Homo, fuge:  whither should I fly?      If unto God, he'll throw me[87] down to hell.      My senses are deceiv'd; here's nothing writ:--      I see it plain; here in this place is writ,      Homo, fuge:  yet shall not Faustus fly.       MEPHIST. I'll fetch him somewhat to delight his mind.           [Aside, and then exit.]            Re-enter MEPHISTOPHILIS with DEVILS, who give crowns           and rich apparel to FAUSTUS, dance, and then depart.       FAUSTUS. Speak, Mephistophilis, what means this show?       MEPHIST. Nothing, Faustus, but to delight thy mind withal,      And to shew thee what magic can perform.       FAUSTUS. But may I raise up spirits when I please?       MEPHIST. Ay, Faustus, and do greater things than these.       FAUSTUS. Then there's enough for a thousand souls.      Here, Mephistophilis, receive this scroll,      A deed of gift of body and of soul:      But yet conditionally that thou perform      All articles prescrib'd between us both.       MEPHIST. Faustus, I swear by hell and Lucifer      To effect all promises between us made!       FAUSTUS. Then hear me read them.  [Reads] ON THESE CONDITIONS      FOLLOWING.  FIRST, THAT FAUSTUS MAY BE A SPIRIT IN FORM AND      SUBSTANCE.  SECONDLY, THAT MEPHISTOPHILIS SHALL BE HIS SERVANT,      AND AT HIS COMMAND.  THIRDLY, THAT MEPHISTOPHILIS SHALL DO FOR HIM,      AND BRING HIM WHATSOEVER HE DESIRES.[88]  FOURTHLY, THAT HE SHALL      BE IN HIS CHAMBER OR HOUSE INVISIBLE.  LASTLY, THAT HE SHALL APPEAR      TO THE SAID JOHN FAUSTUS, AT ALL TIMES, IN WHAT FORM OR SHAPE      SOEVER HE PLEASE.  I, JOHN FAUSTUS, OF WERTENBERG, DOCTOR, BY      THESE PRESENTS, DO GIVE BOTH BODY AND SOUL TO LUCIFER PRINCE OF      THE EAST, AND HIS MINISTER MEPHISTOPHILIS; AND FURTHERMORE GRANT      UNTO THEM, THAT,[89] TWENTY-FOUR YEARS BEING EXPIRED, THE ARTICLES      ABOVE-WRITTEN INVIOLATE, FULL POWER TO FETCH OR CARRY THE SAID      JOHN FAUSTUS, BODY AND SOUL, FLESH, BLOOD, OR GOODS, INTO THEIR      HABITATION WHERESOEVER.  BY ME, JOHN FAUSTUS.       MEPHIST. Speak, Faustus, do you deliver this as your deed?       FAUSTUS. Ay, take it, and the devil give thee good on't!       MEPHIST. Now, Faustus, ask what thou wilt.       FAUSTUS. First will I question with thee about hell.      Tell me, where is the place that men call hell?       MEPHIST. Under the heavens.       FAUSTUS. Ay, but whereabout?       MEPHIST. Within the bowels of these[90] elements,      Where we are tortur'd and remain for ever:      Hell hath no limits, nor is circumscrib'd      In one self place; for where we are is hell,      And where hell is, there[91] must we ever be:      And, to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/779"],["title","The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus (#3)"],["body","nclude, when all the world dissolves,      And every creature shall be purified,      All places shall be hell that are[92] not heaven.       FAUSTUS. Come, I think hell's a fable.       MEPHIST. Ay, think so still, till experience change thy mind.       FAUSTUS. Why, think'st thou, then, that Faustus shall be damn'd?       MEPHIST. Ay, of necessity, for here's the scroll      Wherein thou hast given thy soul to Lucifer.       FAUSTUS. Ay, and body too:  but what of that?      Think'st thou that Faustus is so fond[93] to imagine      That, after this life, there is any pain?      Tush, these are trifles and mere old wives' tales.       MEPHIST. But, Faustus, I am an instance to prove the contrary,      For I am damn'd, and am now in hell.       FAUSTUS. How! now in hell!      Nay, an this be hell, I'll willingly be damn'd here:      What! walking, disputing, &c.[94]      But, leaving off this, let me have a wife,[95]      The fairest maid in Germany;      For I am wanton and lascivious,      And cannot live without a wife.       MEPHIST. How! a wife!      I prithee, Faustus, talk not of a wife.       FAUSTUS. Nay, sweet Mephistophilis, fetch me one, for I will have      one.       MEPHIST. Well, thou wilt have one?  Sit there till I come:  I'll      fetch thee a wife in the devil's name.           [Exit.]            Re-enter MEPHISTOPHILIS with a DEVIL drest like a WOMAN,           with fire-works.       MEPHIST. Tell me,[96] Faustus, how dost thou like thy wife?       FAUSTUS. A plague on her for a hot whore!       MEPHIST. Tut, Faustus,      Marriage is but a ceremonial toy;      If thou lovest me, think no[97] more of it.      I'll cull thee out the fairest courtezans,      And bring them every morning to thy bed:      She whom thine eye shall like, thy heart shall have,      Be she as chaste as was Penelope,      As wise as Saba,[98] or as beautiful      As was bright Lucifer before his fall.      Hold, take this book, peruse it thoroughly:           [Gives book.]       The iterating[99] of these lines brings gold;      The framing of this circle on the ground      Brings whirlwinds, tempests, thunder, and lightning;      Pronounce this thrice devoutly to thyself,      And men in armour shall appear to thee,      Ready to execute what thou desir'st.       FAUSTUS. Thanks, Mephistophilis:  yet fain would I have a book      wherein I might behold all spells and incantations, that I      might raise up spirits when I please.       MEPHIST. Here they are in this book.           [Turns to them.]       FAUSTUS. Now would I have a book where I might see all characters      and planets of the heavens, that I might know their motions and      dispositions.       MEPHIST. Here they are too.           [Turns to them.]       FAUSTUS. Nay, let me have one book more,--and then I have done,--      wherein I might see all plants, herbs, and trees, that grow upon      the earth.       MEPHIST. Here they be.       FAUSTUS. O, thou art deceived.       MEPHIST. Tut, I warrant thee.           [Turns to them.]       FAUSTUS. When I behold the heavens, then I repent,      And curse thee, wicked Mephistophilis,      Because thou hast depriv'd me of those joys.       MEPHIST. Why, Faustus,      Thinkest thou heaven is such a glorious thing?      I tell thee, 'tis not half so fair as thou,      Or any man that breathes on earth.       FAUSTUS. How prov'st thou that?       MEPHIST. 'Twas made for man, therefore is man more excellent.       FAUSTUS. If it were made for man, 'twas made for me:      I will renounce this magic and repent.            Enter GOOD ANGEL and EVIL ANGEL.       GOOD ANGEL. Faustus, repent; yet God will pity thee.       EVIL ANGEL. Thou art a spirit; God cannot pity thee.       FAUSTUS. Who buzzeth in mine ears I am a spirit?      Be I a devil, yet God may pity me;      Ay, God will pity me, if I repent.       EVIL ANGEL. Ay, but Faustus never shall repent.           [Exeunt ANGELS.]       FAUSTUS. My heart's so harden'd, I cannot repent:      Scarce can I name salvation, faith, or heaven,      But fearful echoes thunder in mine ears,      \"Faustus, thou art damn'd!\" then swords, and knives,      Poison, guns, halters, and envenom'd steel      Are laid before me to despatch myself;      And long ere this I should have slain myself,      Had not sweet pleasure conquer'd deep despair.      Have not I made blind Homer sing to me      Of Alexander's love and Oenon's death?      And hath not he, that built the walls of Thebes      With ravishing sound of his melodious harp,      Made music with my Mephistophilis?      Why should I die, then, or basely despair?      I am resolv'd; Faustus shall ne'er repent.--      Come, Mephistophilis, let us dispute again,      And argue of divine astrology.[100]      Tell me, are there many heavens above the moon      Are all celestial bodies but one globe,      As is the substance of this centric earth?       MEPHIST. As are the elements, such are the spheres,      Mutually folded in each other's orb,      And, Faustus,      All jointly move upon one axletree,      Whose terminine is term'd the world's wide pole;      Nor are the names of Saturn, Mars, or Jupiter      Feign'd, but are erring[101] stars.       FAUSTUS. But, tell me, have they all one motion, both situ et      tempore?       MEPHIST. All jointly move from east to west in twenty-four hours      upon the poles of the world; but differ in their motion upon      the poles of the zodiac.       FAUSTUS. Tush,      These slender trifles Wagner can decide:      Hath Mephistophilis no greater skill?      Who knows not the double motion of the planets?      The first is finish'd in a natural day;      The second thus; as Saturn in thirty years; Jupiter in twelve;      Mars in four; the Sun, Venus, and Mercury in a year; the Moon in      twenty-eight days.  Tush, these are freshmen's[102] suppositions.      But, tell me, hath every sphere a dominion or intelligentia?       MEPHIST. Ay.       FAUSTUS. How many heavens or spheres are there?       MEPHIST. Nine; the seven planets, the firmament, and the empyreal      heaven.       FAUSTUS. Well, resolve[103] me in this question; why have we not      conjunctions, oppositions, aspects, eclipses, all at one time,      but in some years we have more, in some less?       MEPHIST. Per inoequalem motum respectu totius.       FAUSTUS. Well, I am answered.  Tell me who made the world?       MEPHIST. I will not.       FAUSTUS. Sweet Mephistophilis, tell me.       MEPHIST. Move me not, for I will not tell thee.       FAUSTUS. Villain, have I not bound thee to tell me any thing?       MEPHIST. Ay, that is not against our kingdom; but this is.  Think      thou on hell, Faustus, for thou art damned.       FAUSTUS. Think, Faustus, upon God that made the world.       MEPHIST. Remember this.           [Exit.]       FAUSTUS. Ay, go, accursed spirit, to ugly hell!      'Tis thou hast damn'd distressed Faustus' soul.      Is't not too late?            Re-enter GOOD ANGEL and EVIL ANGEL.       EVIL ANGEL. Too late.       GOOD ANGEL. Never too late, if Faustus can repent.       EVIL ANGEL. If thou repent, devils shall tear thee in pieces.       GOOD ANGEL. Repent, and they shall never raze thy skin.           [Exeunt ANGELS.]       FAUSTUS. Ah, Christ, my Saviour,      Seek to save[104] distressed Faustus' soul!            Enter LUCIFER, BELZEBUB, and MEPHISTOPHILIS.       LUCIFER. Christ cannot save thy soul, for he is just:      There's none but I have interest in the same.       FAUSTUS. O, who art thou that look'st so terrible?       LUCIFER. I am Lucifer,      And this is my companion-prince in hell.       FAUSTUS. O, Faustus, they are come to fetch away thy soul!       LUCIFER. We come to tell thee thou dost injure us;      Thou talk'st of Christ, contrary to thy promise:      Thou shouldst not think of God:  think of the devil,      And of his dam too.       FAUSTUS. Nor will I henceforth:  pardon me in this,      And Faustus vows never to look to heaven,      Never to name God, or to pray to him,      To burn his Scriptures, slay his ministers,      And make my spirits pull his churches down.       LUCIFER. Do so, and we will highly gratify thee.  Faustus, we are      come from hell to shew thee some pastime:  sit down, and thou      shalt see all the Seven Deadly Sins appear in their proper shapes.       FAUSTUS. That sight will be as pleasing unto me,      As Paradise was to Adam, the first day      Of his creation.       LUCIFER. Talk not of Paradise nor creation; but mark this show:      talk of the devil, and nothing else.--Come away!            Enter the SEVEN DEADLY SINS.[105]       Now, Faustus, examine them of their several names and dispositions.       FAUSTUS. What art thou, the first?       PRIDE. I am Pride.  I disdain to have any parents.  I am like to      Ovid's flea; I can creep into every corner of a wench; sometimes,      like a perriwig, I sit upon her brow; or, like a fan of feathers,      I kiss her lips; indeed, I do--what do I not?  But, fie, what a      scent is here!  I'll not speak another word, except the ground      were perfumed, and covered with cloth of arras.       FAUSTUS. What art thou, the second?       COVETOUSNESS. I am Covetousness, begotten of an old churl, in an      old leathern bag:  and, might I have my wish, I would desire that      this house and all the people in it were turned to gold, that I      might lock you up in my good chest:  O, my sweet gold!       FAUSTUS. What art thou, the third?       WRATH. I am Wrath.  I had neither father nor mother:  I leapt out      of a lion's mouth when I was scarce half-an-hour old; and ever      since I have run up and down the world with this case[106]      of rapiers, wounding myself when I had nobody to fight withal.      I was born in hell; and look to it, for some of you shall be      my father.       FAUSTUS. What art thou, the fourth?       ENVY. I am Envy, begotten of a chimney-sweeper and an"]]]
