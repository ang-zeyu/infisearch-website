Oh, we shall find hours to talk of the past days.  But how, if your childhood was spent in Margaret's court, does your youth find a welcome in Elizabeth's?\"  \"Avarice and power had need of my father's science.  He is a scholar of good birth, but fallen fortunes, even now, and ever while night lasts, he is at work.  I belonged to the train of her grace of Bedford; but when the duchess quitted the court, and the king retained my father in his own royal service, her highness the queen was pleased to receive me among her maidens.  Happy that my father's home is mine!--who else could tend him?\"  \"Thou art his only child?--he must--love thee dearly?\"  \"Yet not as I love him; he lives in a life apart from all else that live.  But after all, peradventure it is sweeter to love than to be loved.\"  Anne, whose nature was singularly tender and woman-like, was greatly affected by this answer.  She drew nearer to Sibyll; she twined her arm round her slight form, and kissed her forehead.  \"Shall I love thee, Sibyll?\" she said, with a girl's candid simplicity, \"and wilt thou love me?\"  \"Ah, lady! there are so many to love thee,--father, mother, sister,-- all the world; the very sun shines more kindly upon the great!\"  \"Nay!\" said Anne, with that jealousy of a claim to suffering to which the gentler natures are prone, \"I may have sorrows from which thou art free.  I confess to thee, Sibyll, that something I know not how to explain draws me strangely towards thy sweet face.  Marriage has lost me my only sister, for since Isabel is wed she is changed to me--would that her place were supplied by thee!  Shall I steal thee from the queen when I depart?  Ah, my mother--at least thou wilt love her! for verily, to love my mother you have but to breathe the same air.  Kiss me, Sibyll.\"  Kindness, of late, had been strange to Sibyll, especially from her own sex, one of her own age; it came like morning upon the folded blossom. She threw her arms round the new friend that seemed sent to her from heaven; she kissed Anne's face and hands with grateful tears.  \"Ah!\" she said at last, when she could command a voice still broken with emotion--\"if I could ever serve--ever repay thee--though those gracious words were the last thy lips should ever deign to address to me!\"  Anne was delighted; she had never yet found one to protect; she had never yet found one in whom thoroughly to confide.  Gentle as her mother was, the distinction between child and parent was, even in the fond family she belonged to, so great in that day, that she could never have betrayed to the countess the wild weakness of her young heart.  The wish to communicate, to reveal, is so natural to extreme youth, and in Anne that disposition was so increased by a nature at once open and inclined to lean on others, that she had, as we have seen, sought a confidante in Isabel; but with her, even at the first, she found but the half-contemptuous pity of a strong and hard mind; and lately, since Edward's visit to Middleham, the Duchess of Clarence had been so rapt in her own imperious egotism and discontented ambition, that the timid Anne had not even dared to touch, with her, upon those secrets which it flushed her own bashful cheek to recall.  And this visit to the court, this new, unfamiliar scene, this estrangement from all the old accustomed affections, had produced in her that sense of loneliness which is so irksome, till grave experience of real life accustoms us to the common lot.  So with the exaggerated and somewhat morbid sensibility that belonged to her, she turned at once, and by impulse, to this sudden, yet graceful friendship.  Here was one of her own age, one who had known sorrow, one whose voice and eyes charmed her, one who would not chide even folly, one, above all, who had seen her beloved prince, one associated with her fondest memories, one who might have a thousand tales to tell of the day when the outlaw boy was a monarch's heir.  In the childishness of her soft years, she almost wept at another channel for so much natural tenderness.  It was half the woman gaining a woman-friend, half the child clinging to a new playmate.  \"Ah, Sibyll,\" she whispered, \"do not leave me to-night; this strange place daunts me, and the figures on the arras seem so tall and spectre-like, and they say the old tower is haunted.  Stay, dear Sibyll!\"  And Sibyll stayed.     CHAPTER II.  THE SLEEPING INNOCENCE--THE WAKEFUL CRIME.  While these charming girls thus innocently conferred; while, Anne's sweet voice running on in her artless fancies, they helped each other to undress; while hand in hand they knelt in prayer by the crucifix in the dim recess; while timidly they extinguished the light, and stole to rest; while, conversing in whispers, growing gradually more faint and low, they sank into guileless sleep,--the unholy king paced his solitary chamber, parched with the fever of the sudden and frantic passion that swept away from a heart in which every impulse was a giant all the memories of honour, gratitude, and law.  The mechanism of this strong man's nature was that almost unknown to the modern time; it belonged to those earlier days which furnish to Greece the terrible legends Ovid has clothed in gloomy fire, which a similar civilization produced no less in the Middle Ages, whether of Italy or the North,--that period when crime took a grandeur from its excess; when power was so great and absolute that its girth burst the ligaments of conscience; when a despot was but the incarnation of WILL; when honour was indeed a religion, but its faith was valour, and it wrote its decalogue with the point of a fearless sword.  The youth of Edward IV. was as the youth of an ancient Titan, of an Italian Borgia; through its veins the hasty blood rolled as a devouring flame.  This impetuous and fiery temperament was rendered yet more fearful by the indulgence of every intemperance; it fed on wine and lust; its very virtues strengthened its vices,--its courage stifled every whisper of prudence; its intellect, uninured to all discipline, taught it to disdain every obstacle to its desires. Edward could, indeed, as we have seen, be false and crafty, a temporizer, a dissimulator; but it was only as the tiger creeps,--the better to spring, undetected, on its prey.  If detected, the cunning ceased, the daring rose, and the mighty savage had fronted ten thousand foes, secure in its fangs and talons, its bold heart and its deadly spring.  Hence, with all Edward's abilities, the astonishing levities and indiscretions of his younger years.  It almost seemed, as we have seen him play fast and loose with the might of Warwick, and with that power, whether of barons or of people, which any other prince of half his talents would have trembled to arouse against an unrooted throne,--it almost seemed as if he loved to provoke a danger for the pleasure it gave the brain to baffle or the hand to crush it. His whole nature coveting excitement, nothing was left to the beautiful, the luxurious Edward, already wearied with pomp and pleasure, but what was unholy and forbidden.  In his court were a hundred ladies, perhaps not less fair than Anne, at least of a beauty more commanding the common homage, but these he had only to smile on with ease to win.  No awful danger, no inexpiable guilt, attended those vulgar frailties, and therefore they ceased to tempt.  But here the virgin guest, the daughter of his mightiest subject, the beloved treasure of the man whose hand had built a throne, whose word had dispersed an army--here, the more the reason warned, the conscience started, the more the hell-born passion was aroused.  Like men of his peculiar constitution, Edward was wholly incapable of pure and steady love.  His affection for his queen the most resembled that diviner affection; but when analyzed, it was composed of feelings widely distinct.  From a sudden passion, not otherwise to be gratified, he had made the rashest sacrifices for an unequal marriage. His vanity, and something of original magnanimity, despite his vices, urged him to protect what he himself had raised,--to secure the honour of the subject who was honoured by the king.  In common with most rude and powerful natures, he was strongly alive to the affections of a father, and the faces of his children helped to maintain the influence of the mother.  But in all this, we need scarcely say that that true love, which is at once a passion and a devotion, existed not.  Love with him cared not for the person loved, but solely for its own gratification; it was desire for possession,--nothing more.  But that desire was the will of a king who never knew fear or scruple; and, pampered by eternal indulgence, it was to the feeble lusts of common men what the storm is to the west wind.  Yet still, as in the solitude of night he paced his chamber, the shadow of the great crime advancing upon his soul appalled even that dauntless conscience.  He gasped for breath; his cheeks flushed crimson, and the next moment grew deadly pale.  He heard the loud beating of his heart.  He stopped still.  He flung himself on a seat, and hid his face with his hands; then starting up, he exclaimed, \"No, no!  I cannot shut out that sweet face, those blue eyes from my gaze.  They haunt me to my destruction and her own.  Yet why say destruction?  If she love me, who shall know the deed?  If she love me not, will she dare to reveal her shame? Shame!--nay, a king's embrace never dishonours.  A king's bastard is a House's pride.  All is still,--the very moon vanishes from heaven. The noiseless rushes in the gallery give no echo to the footstep.  Fie on me!  Can a Plantagenet know fear?\"  He allowed himself no further time to pause; he opened the door gently and stole along the gallery. He knew well the chamber, for it was appointed by his command, and, besides the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7722"],["title","The Last of the Barons — Volume 08 (#2)"],["body","door from the corridor, a small closet conducted to a secret panel behind the arras.  It was the apartment occupied, in her visits to the court, by the queen's rival, the Lady Elizabeth Lucy.  He passed into the closet; he lifted the arras; he stood in that chamber, which gratitude and chivalry and hospitable faith should have made sacred as a shrine.  And suddenly, as he entered, the moon, before hid beneath a melancholy cloud, broke forth in awful splendour, and her light rushed through the casement opposite his eye, and bathed the room with the beams of a ghostlier day.  The abruptness of the solemn and mournful glory scared him as the rebuking face of a living thing; a presence as if not of earth seemed to interpose between the victim and the guilt.  It was, however, but for a moment that his step halted.  He advanced: he drew aside the folds of the curtain heavy with tissue of gold, and the sleeping face of Anne lay hushed before him.  It looked pale in the moonlight, but ineffably serene, and the smile on its lips seemed still sweeter than that which it wore awake.  So fixed was his gaze, so ardently did his whole heart and being feed through his eyes upon that exquisite picture of innocence and youth, that he did not see for some moments that the sleeper was not alone.  Suddenly an exclamation rose to his lips.  He clenched his hand in jealous agony; he approached; he bent over; he heard the regular breathing which the dreams of guilt never know; and then, when he saw that pure and interlaced embrace,--the serene yet somewhat melancholy face of Sibyll, which seemed hueless as marble in the moonlight, bending partially over that of Anne, as if even in sleep watchful; both charming forms so linked and woven that the two seemed as one life, the very breath in each rising and ebbing with the other; the dark ringlets of Sibyll mingling with the auburn gold of Anne's luxuriant hair, and the darkness and the gold, tress within tress, falling impartially over either neck, that gleamed like ivory beneath that common veil,--when he saw this twofold loveliness, the sentiment, the conviction of that mysterious defence which exists in purity, thrilled like ice through his burning veins.  In all his might of monarch and of man, he felt the awe of that unlooked-for protection,--maidenhood sheltering maidenhood, innocence guarding innocence.  The double virtue appalled and baffled him; and that slight arm which encircled the neck he would have perilled his realm to clasp, shielded his victim more effectually than the bucklers of all the warriors that ever gathered round the banner of the lofty Warwick.  Night and the occasion befriended him; but in vain.  While Sibyll was there, Anne was saved.  He ground his teeth, and muttered to himself.  At that moment Anne turned restlessly.  This movement disturbed the light sleep of her companion.  She spoke half inaudibly, but the sound was as the hoot of shame in the ear of the guilty king. He let fall the curtain, and was gone.  And if one who lived afterwards to hear and to credit the murderous doom which, unless history lies, closed the male line of Edward, had beheld the king stealing, felon-like, from the chamber,--his step reeling to and fro the gallery floors, his face distorted by stormy passion, his lips white and murmuring, his beauty and his glory dimmed and humbled,--the spectator might have half believed that while Edward gazed upon those harmless sleepers, A VISION OF THE TRAGEDY TO COME had stricken down his thought of guilt, and filled up its place with horror,--a vision of a sleep as pure, of two forms wrapped in an embrace as fond, of intruders meditating a crime scarce fouler than his own; and the sins of the father starting into grim corporeal shapes, to become the deathsmen of the sons!     CHAPTER III.  NEW DANGERS TO THE HOUSE OF YORK--AND THE KING'S HEART ALLIES ITSELF WITH REBELLION AGAINST THE KING'S THRONE.  Oh, beautiful is the love of youth to youth, and touching the tenderness of womanhood to woman; and fair in the eyes of the happy sun is the waking of holy sleep, and the virgin kiss upon virgin lips smiling and murmuring the sweet \"Good-morrow!\"  Anne was the first to wake; and as the bright winter morn, robust with frosty sunbeams shone cheerily upon Sibyll's face, she was struck with a beauty she had not sufficiently observed the day before; for in the sleep of the young the traces of thought and care vanish, the aching heart is lulled in the body's rest, the hard lines relax into flexile ease, a softer, warmer bloom steals over the cheek, and, relieved from the stiff restraints of dress, the rounded limbs repose in a more alluring grace!  Youth seems younger in its slumber, and beauty more beautiful, and purity more pure.  Long and dark, the fringe of the eyelash rested upon the white lids, and the freshness of the parting pouted lips invited the sister kiss that wakened up the sleeper.  \"Ah, lady,\" said Sibyll, parting her tresses from her dark blue eyes, \"you are here, you are safe!--blessed be the saints and our Lady! for I had a dream in the night that startled and appalled me.\"  \"And my dreams were all blithe and golden,\" said Anne.  \"What was thine?\"  \"Methought you were asleep and in this chamber, and I not by your side, but watching you at a little distance; and lo! a horrible serpent glided from yon recess, and, crawling to your pillow, I heard its hiss, and strove to come to your aid, but in vain; a spell seemed to chain my limbs.  At last I found voice, I cried aloud, I woke; and mock me not, but I surely heard a parting footstep, and the low grating of some sliding door.\"  \"It was the dream's influence, enduring beyond the dream.  I have often felt it so,--nay, even last night; for I, too, dreamed of another, dreamed that I stood by the altar with one far away, and when I woke--for I woke also--it was long before I could believe it was thy hand I held, and thine arm that embraced me.\"  The young friends rose, and their toilet was scarcely ended, when again appeared in the chamber all the stateliness of retinue allotted to the Lady Anne.  Sibyll turned to depart.  \"And whither go you?\" asked Anne.  \"To visit my father; it is my first task on rising,\" returned Sibyll, in a whisper.  \"You must let me visit him, too, at a later hour.  Find me here an hour before noon, Sibyll.\"  The early morning was passed by Anne in the queen's company.  The refection, the embroidery frame, the closheys, filled up the hours. The Duchess of Clarence had left the palace with her lord to visit the king's mother at Baynard's Castle; and Anne's timid spirits were saddened by the strangeness of the faces round her, and Elizabeth's habitual silence.  There was something in the weak and ill-fated queen that ever failed to conciliate friends.  Though perpetually striving to form and create a party, she never succeeded in gaining confidence or respect.  And no one raised so high was ever left so friendless as Elizabeth, when, in her awful widowhood, her dowry home became the sanctuary.  All her power was but the shadow of her husband's royal sun, and vanished when the orb prematurely set; yet she had all gifts of person in her favour, and a sleek smoothness of manner that seemed to the superficial formed to win; but the voice was artificial, and the eye cold and stealthy.  About her formal precision there was an eternal consciousness of self, a breathing egotism.  Her laugh was displeasing,--cynical, not mirthful; she had none of that forgetfulness of self, that warmth when gay, that earnestness when sad, which create sympathy.  Her beauty was without loveliness, her character without charm; every proportion in her form might allure the sensualist; but there stopped the fascination.  The mind was trivial, though cunning and dissimulating; and the very evenness of her temper seemed but the clockwork of a heart insensible to its own movements. Vain in prosperity, what wonder that she was so abject in misfortune? What wonder that even while, in later and gloomier years, [Grafton, 806] accusing Richard III. of the murder of her royal sons, and knowing him, at least, the executioner of her brother and her child by the bridegroom of her youth, [Anthony Lord Rivers, and Lord Richard Gray.  Not the least instance of the frivolity of Elizabeth's mind is to be found in her willingness, after all the woes of her second widowhood, and when she was not very far short of sixty years old, to take a third husband, James III., of Scotland,--a marriage prevented only by the death of the Scotch king.] she consented to send her daughters to his custody, though subjected to the stain of illegitimacy, and herself only recognized as the harlot?  The king, meanwhile, had ridden out betimes alone, and no other of the male sex presumed in his absence to invade the female circle.  It was with all a girl's fresh delight that Anne escaped at last to her own chamber, where she found Sibyll; and, with her guidance, she threaded the gloomy mazes of the Tower.  \"Let me see,\" she whispered, \"before we visit your father, let me see the turret in which the unhappy Henry is confined.\"  And Sibyll led her through the arch of that tower, now called \"The Bloody,\" and showed her the narrow casement deep sunk in the mighty wall, without which hung the starling in the cage, basking its plumes in the wintry sun.  Anne gazed with that deep interest and tender reverence which the parent of the man she loves naturally excites in a woman; and while thus standing sorrowful and silent, the casement was unbarred, and she saw the mild face of the human captive; he seemed to talk to the bird, which, in shrill tones and with clapping wings, answered his address.  At that time a horn sounded at a little distance off; a clangour of arms, as the sentries saluted, was heard; the demoiselles retreated through the arch, and mounted the stair conducting to the very room, then unoccupied, in which tradition records"]]]
