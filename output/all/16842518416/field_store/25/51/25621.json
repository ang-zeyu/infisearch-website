Then, as he started to walk on he gave a shout of dismay.  \"Hold onto me, Bob,\" he cried. \"I can't move. While I've been standing here listening to your words of wisdom I've been sinking deeper and deeper into your old yellow mud until now I can't stir. I can't--upon my word. My feet are in perfectly solid. You can laugh if you want to, but you've just got to pull me out, that's all. Help! Help! To the rescue. I shall disappear in another minute. David will never see his rubber boots again.\"  \"Of course you can get your feet out,\" was Bob's scornful retort.  \"Cross my heart I can't. Honest, Bobbie,\" protested Van. \"I've got into a quicksand or a quagmire or something. Look at me. I'm up to my knees now, and if you don't hurry you'll see nothing of me but my collar. I saved your life yesterday; you might do the same for me to-day.\"  But Bob was too convulsed with amusement to offer aid; instead he stood on a large rock at the roadside and laughed immoderately.  \"Pull! Pull!\" he cried to Van. \"Why don't you pull?\"  \"I am pulling,\" Van answered. \"But it does no good. I can't budge my feet. I never saw such mud in all my life. It must be yards deep. It sucks my boots right off. You'll have to help me.\"  \"Not I! I know too well what would happen. It would be like Kipling's story of the Elephant's Child. Don't you remember, when the crocodile let go the nose of the little elephant how he suddenly sat down _plop_. I've no notion of being pulled into this mud hole when your rubber boots come to the surface. You'll have to get yourself out.\"  \"You old heathen! It is not a straight game to fit me out with a pair of hip rubber boots miles too large for me and then sit and howl when you see me losing my life in them. Well, you needn't come into the mire if you don't want to, but you can at least be gentleman enough to pass me the end of that pole that is lying beside you,\" said Van.  \"I'll do that.\"  Bob picked up a long branch from the ground.  \"Here!\" he cried. \"Catch hold of this and pull.\"  The two boys tugged at opposite ends of the stick.  Then suddenly and quite without warning something happened.  The dead wood parted and Bob hurtled backward off the rock where he had been standing and landed in a snow-drift; while Van, much to his astonishment, sat down with abruptness in the wettest of the mud.  Two more chagrined boys could nowhere have been found.  Bob was the first to get to his feet. Shaking the snow out of his hair and collar he called:  \"Get up, you--unless you want to be swallowed up for life. My eye, but you're a sight! If your mother could only see you now. Well, your feet are out, if you did have to get in all over to do it. Now step lively if you don't want to get stuck again. You are a peach, I must say!\"  Van took the banter good-naturedly.  \"That's what one might call being buried alive,\" he answered. \"Lucky it wasn't you! I'm tall and could keep my head out; but the mire would long since have closed over an abbreviated person like yourself and you would have been seen no more.\"  Bob winced. He was sensitive about his height.  Clambering up on the rock beside his chum Van scooped up a handful of clean snow and with it washed his hands and face.  \"There!\" he said at length. \"I'm just as tidy as if it had not happened.\"  \"I can't exactly agree with you,\" replied Bob, \"but I guess you'll have to do. Come on now. Goodness only knows where David and the sledge have got to by this time.\"  They hurried up the hill.  \"There's David!\" Van said, as they reached the crest of the rise.  It was David sure enough; and standing beside him in his customary motionless attitude was the Admiral harnessed into a great sledge surmounted by a barrel into which David was pouring the sap as fast as he gathered it. At the moment the man was busy detaching one of the sap buckets from the trunk of a giant maple.  The boys joined him.  \"What are you doing, Dave?\" asked Van curiously.  \"Doing! Ain't you got eyes, young man? I certainly ain't writing a book or taking a wireless message,\" he answered without turning his head.  \"But straight, I mean it. What are you doing? You know this business is new to me,\" explained Van.  \"Haven't you ever seen maple-sugar made?\" David's tone was full of surprise.  \"Never.\"  \"Well, bless my soul! Where was you raised?\"  \"In Colorado.\"  \"Humph! That accounts for it. If you'd been brought up in the East you'd have known.\"  \"But I was raised in the East, David, and I've never seen maple-sugar made,\" piped Bob, instantly overthrowing the old farmer's philosophy.  \"You ain't never--you ain't seen maple-syrup or maple-sugar made, Mr. Bob?\" queried David aghast.  \"No.\"  \"Well, what are we coming to?\"  The farmhand surveyed the boys disdainfully.  \"What you been doing with yourself all your days?\" he gasped at last.  \"I've been going to school.\"  \"And they ain't taught you to make maple-sugar?  That's about all schooling is worth nowadays,\" he affirmed. \"Now I warn't never inside a schoolhouse in my life, but I've known from the time I was knee-high to a grasshopper how to make maple-sugar. I made pounds of it before I was half the age of you two. The boys of this generation don't know nothin'!\"  He sniffed contemptuously.  \"Well, you may as well learn before you're a minute older,\" he continued. \"Listen, now. Do you see the little hole in this maple?\" He pointed up at the gray trunk above his head. \"We make a little hole like that in every tree as soon as the sap begins to run in the early spring. Then we drive into the hole this small piece of hollow wood--it is like a trough, you see; and the sap runs through it into the buckets we hang beneath. All day and all night it drips in and each morning we go round and empty every pail into the cask we carry on the sledge. The sap, as you see, is thin, because only part of it is sugar; the rest is water. What we have to do is to boil down the liquid until the part that is water goes off in vapor and only the syrup is left. If we're after maple-syrup we let it cool when it gets thick and later bottle it; but if we want sugar we must boil the syrup still more until little crystals form in it.\"  \"How can you tell when it has been boiled enough?\" questioned Van.  \"Oh, we've made it enough times to know,\" David replied. \"Some folks stick a thermometer into it and figger how hot it will have to be; they say that's the best way. Others try the syrup in cold water or on snow like you would candy. Generally speaking, I can tell by the feel of it, and by the way it drips from the spoon. Sometimes, though, when I'm in doubt I try it on snow myself. If it gets kinder soft and waxy you can be sure it is getting done. If I was you instead of tracking round emptying buckets I'd go in the sugar-house and see 'em boiling the syrup. They started yesterday, and as I calculate it the mess ought to be pretty well along by now.\"  \"Bully idea, David! What do you say, Van?\" asked Bob. \"Shall we trail David or shall we go in and see the sugar made?\"  \"Sugar! Sugar! Me for the sugar!\" Van cried.  \"Sugar it is then!\"  Into the sugar-house they went.  The small room was hot and steamy, and in the middle of it in a zinc-lined tank the foaming sap was boiling furiously. Beside it stood McMasters, Mr. Carlton's foreman, a thermometer in his hand.  \"Good-morning, Mr. Bob,\" he said. \"So you are coming to cast an eye on the maple-sugar! Last week we made syrup and bottled it. Not a bad day's work, eh?\"  With no little pride he pointed to a row of neat bottles symmetrically arranged on a shelf. \"We'll seal them to-morrow or next day and get the labels on, and then they will be ready to sell. But to-day it's sugar, so we have to keep the sap at a higher temperature.\"  As he spoke he paused to test the bubbling liquid in the kettle.  \"If you lads want a treat take one of those wooden plates over there and fill it with snow; I'll spoon some of this hot sap over it, and you will have a feast for a king.\"  The boys needed no urging. They took the plates, hurried out, and soon returned with them; over the heap of snow the foreman poured several heaping spoonfuls of hot syrup which, to their surprise, cooled in an incredibly short time and stiffened into a sticky mass that looked like candy.  \"Now get one of those wooden skewers from the shelf and use it as a fork,\" McMasters said.  The boys caught the idea at once.  They gathered the candied syrup up on the end of the sticks and thrust it into their mouths.  \"Why, it is just like toffy!\" Van exclaimed.  \"It is a sight fresher than anything you could buy at the store,\" observed the foreman.  \"I believe I've got to have some more, Mac,\" Bob said. \"Somehow it melts away before you know you're eating it.\"  He refilled his plate with fresh snow and held it out for a second helping of syrup.  McMasters filled it good-naturedly.  But when the plates were extended the fourth and fifth time the Scotchman demurred.  \"It is no stuff to make a meal of, Mr. Bob,\" protested he. \"And at ten o'clock in the morning, too. I'll give you no more. It is too sweet. Next you know the two of you will be spending your vacation in bed and wondering what's the matter with you. Why, we'd have no sugar at all if you should stay here eating at this rate. If it's candy you're wantin', ask the cook to boil some maple-syrup until it is thick like molasses candy; then turn it out of the pan and when it is almost cool pull it until it turns white. You'll find it better than any candy you can buy. Try it.\"  \"We certainly will, Mac, and thanks for the suggestion,\" Bob replied.  \"And while you're at it you might hunt up some butternuts and stir them in; I'll recommend the result and will wager you'll think it as good as anything you ever ate.\"  Once more he took the temperature of the steaming sap.  \"We're going to put some of the sugar in those tin pails and sell it,\" he continued. \"Each pail holds ten pounds. And some we shall pour into those small tin"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7803"],["title","The Story of Sugar (#5)"],["body","and make little scalloped cakes for our own use. I reckon you can have some of them to take back to college when you go. We'll certainly have a plenty to spare you some, for your father will make a handsome thing out of his sugar this year. I wouldn't wonder but you're being educated on maple-sugar money. You better make your bow of thanks to the trees as you go through the orchard,\" he added whimsically.     CHAPTER IV  THE REFINERY   Vacation with its country sports came to an end only too quickly, and leaving the New Hampshire hills behind the Carlton family, together with Van Blake, set out for New York where the boys were to make a weekend visit before returning to Colversham.  \"I wish while we're in New York we could go through your refinery, Dad,\" Bob remarked to his father.  Mr. Carlton glanced at him in surprise.  \"What set you thinking of that, Bob?\" he asked. \"You never were interested in sugar making before.\"  \"I know it, Father.\" Bob flushed guiltily. \"I ought to have been. But since we have seen maple-sugar made Van and I thought it would be fun to see the process that white sugar has to go through before it is ready for the market.\"  \"Van thought so, did he?\" queried Mr. Carlton.  \"Why, yes, he thought so. I believe, though, it was I who suggested it.\"  \"Humph!\" murmured Mr. Carlton. He mused a moment. \"I suppose it would do no harm,\" he said at last, half to himself.  \"Harm!\"  \"No, no! Of course not,\" interrupted Mr. Carlton hurriedly. \"The process is an open secret anyway, except perhaps--Oh, I guess it would be all right.\"  Bob regarded his father with a puzzled stare.  \"I will arrange for you and Van to go through the works right away,\" continued Mr. Carlton. \"It simply will be necessary for me to telephone the superintendent and tell him you are coming so he will have some one on hand to explain things to you. This was your scheme, you say?\"  \"Yes, sir. Why?\"  \"Nothing, nothing,\" was Mr. Carlton's enigmatic reply.  He was as good as his word, for despite his peculiar reluctance in the matter he lost no time in perfecting the plan, and the next morning after the party reached New York he informed the boys that the motor-car would be at the door at nine o'clock to take them to the refinery.  Bob and Van, to whom New York was more or less of an old story, hailed this announcement with pleasure and promptly stowed themselves away in the big limousine which was to whirl them to Long Island where the works were located. All the way out Van was singularly silent, and appeared to be turning something over in his mind; once he started to speak, but checked himself abruptly.  Bob watched him uneasily.  \"I believe you've lost your enthusiasm about sugar,\" said he at last, \"and did not really want to come.\"  \"What a notion! Of course I wanted to come.\"  \"But you seem so glum, old man.\"  \"Glum! Nonsense! I never was in better spirits in my life.\"  With a sudden shifting of the subject Van pointed to a stack of chimneys cleaving the sky and observed:  \"I wonder if those belong to your father's plant?\"  \"I fancy they do,\" was Bob's quick answer. \"Dad said we'd see a bunch of tall chimneys, and that the refinery was of yellow brick.\"  \"Then this is the place,\" Van declared, drumming on the window glass with forced gaiety.  He did not, however, leap from the car with the spring of anticipation that Bob did, and noticing his spiritless step his friend once more remarked upon it.  \"You seem bored to death to have to drag yourself through here, Van,\" said he. \"What's the matter? You know if you do not want to come you don't have to.\"  \"I do want to.\"  \"But somehow you seem so-so--\"  \"So _what?_\"  \"Why, you seem to hang back as if you could hardly put one foot before the other,\" answered Bob. \"Don't you feel well?\"  \"Prime! There's nothing the matter with me. What put that idea into your head?\"  \"Chiefly you yourself.\"  \"Well, cut it out. I don't see what you're fussing about me for. I'm just as anxious to see how sugar is made as you are.\"  Still Bob was unconvinced. He could not have explained why, but he felt certain that Van's enthusiasm was feigned. For a second he paused undecidedly on the pavement before the door of the great factory; then shrugging his shoulders he entered, followed closely by his chum.  It was evident that they were expected, for a clerk rose from his desk and came forward to greet them.  \"Mr. Hennessey, the superintendent, said I was to bring you to his office when you arrived,\" he said.  \"Thank you.\"  \"You are Mr. Carlton's son, aren't you?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"I thought you must be. Mr. Hennessey himself is going to take you through the works.\"  The clerk led the way to the door of a private office, where he knocked.  \"Mr. Carlton and his friend are here,\" he announced to the boy who opened the door. \"Tell Mr. Hennessey right away.\"  The boys had not a moment to wait before a large man with a genial face and outstretched hand came forward.  \"I'm glad to see you, Mr. Carlton,\" he said. \"I'm Hennessey, the superintendent. Possibly you may have heard your father speak of me; I have been helping him make sugar for twenty years.\"  Bob smiled up into the eyes of the big man looking down at him.  \"Indeed Dad has spoken of you, Mr. Hennessey,\" he said, returning the hearty hand-shake. \"He depends on you a lot. He says he always feels sure that when you're on the job everything will be all right.\"  Mr. Hennessey flushed with pleasure.  \"I merely try to run your father's place as if it were my own,\" was the modest rejoinder.  \"That's just it--that's why Father feels he can go to the North Pole if he wants to and not worry while he's gone,\" nodded Bob. \"I think it is mighty good of you to bother with my chum and me. Can't you send some one to take us through the refinery? There is not the slightest need for you to go with us yourself.\"  \"Oh, I wouldn't think of turning you over to some one else. You see I am interested in your sugar education; I can't allow the boss's son to get a wrong start in the business,\" laughed Mr. Hennessey.  \"I'm afraid I'm not starting in the business,\" protested Bob, shaking his head deprecatingly. \"I'm only trying to learn a little something about Dad's job, so I can be a bit more intelligent about it.\"  \"You're going to investigate the way your father earns his money, eh?\" chuckled the superintendent. \"Well, I'll tell you right now you need do no blushing for your father's business methods; he makes his fortune as cleanly and honestly as any man could make it.\"  \"I'll take a chance on Dad,\" was the laconic response.  \"You can do so with safety.\"  There was a pause and turning Bob introduced Van Blake.  Then after the two boys had been provided with duck coats so that none of the sticky liquid that sometimes dripped from the machinery should spot their clothing the three set out for the basement of the factory, where the incoming cargoes of sugar were unloaded. Here great bags or casks of raw sugar were being opened, and their contents emptied into wooden troughs preparatory to cleansing and refining.  Both lads regarded with surprise the material that was being tipped out into the bins.  \"Why, it looks like nothing but coarse, muddy snow!\" ejaculated Van. \"Do you really mean to tell us that you can make that brown stuff white, Mr. Hennessey?\"  \"That's what we're here for,\" answered Mr. Hennessey, obviously enjoying his amazement. \"All raw sugar comes to us this way. You see, it is about the color of maple or brown sugar, but it is not nearly so pure, for it has a great deal of dirt mixed with it when we first get it.\"  \"Where does it come from?\" inquired Bob.  \"Largely from the plantations of Cuba and Porto Rico. Toward the end of the year we also get raw sugar from Java, and by the time this is refined and ready for the market the new crop from the West Indies comes along. In addition to this we get consignments from the Philippine Islands, the Hawaiian Islands, South America, Formosa, and Egypt. I suppose it is quite unnecessary to tell you young men anything of how the cane is grown; of course you know all that.\"  \"I don't believe we do, except in a general way,\" Bob admitted honestly. \"I am ashamed to be so green about a thing at which Dad has been working for years. I don't know why I never asked about it before. I guess I never was interested. I simply took it for granted.\"  \"That's the way with most of us,\" was the superintendent's kindly answer. \"We accept many things in the world without actually knowing much about them, and it is not until something brings our ignorance before us that we take the pains to focus our attention and learn about them. So do not be ashamed that you do not know about sugar raising; I didn't when I was your age. Suppose, then, I give you a little idea of what happens before this raw sugar can come to us.\"  \"I wish you would,\" exclaimed both boys in a breath.  \"Probably in your school geographies you have seen pictures of sugar-cane and know that it is a tall perennial not unlike our Indian corn in appearance; it has broad, flat leaves that sometimes measure as many as three feet in length, and often the stalk itself is twenty feet high. This stalk is jointed like a bamboo pole, the joints being about three inches apart near the roots and increasing in distance the higher one gets from the ground.\"  \"How do they plant it?\" Bob asked.  \"It can be planted from seed, but this method takes much time and patience; the usual way is to plant it from cuttings, or slips. The first growth from these cuttings is called plant cane; after these are taken off the roots send out ratoons or shoots from which the crop of one or two years, and sometimes longer, is taken. If the soil is not rich and moist replanting is more frequently necessary and in places like Louisiana, where there is annual frost, planting must be done each year. When the cane is ripe it is cut and brought from the field to a central sugar mill, where heavy iron rollers crush"]]]
