Again, of course no subordinate would have       dared to do such a thing. I described to him how, when according       to his custom he was the first down, he perceived a strange horse       wandering over the moor. How he went out to it, and his       astonishment at recognising, from the white forehead which has       given the favourite its name, that chance had put in his power       the only horse which could beat the one upon which he had put his       money. Then I described how his first impulse had been to lead       him back to King’s Pyland, and how the devil had shown him how he       could hide the horse until the race was over, and how he had led       it back and concealed it at Mapleton. When I told him every       detail he gave it up and thought only of saving his own skin.”        “But his stables had been searched?”        “Oh, an old horse-faker like him has many a dodge.”        “But are you not afraid to leave the horse in his power now,       since he has every interest in injuring it?”        “My dear fellow, he will guard it as the apple of his eye. He       knows that his only hope of mercy is to produce it safe.”        “Colonel Ross did not impress me as a man who would be likely to       show much mercy in any case.”        “The matter does not rest with Colonel Ross. I follow my own       methods, and tell as much or as little as I choose. That is the       advantage of being unofficial. I don’t know whether you observed       it, Watson, but the Colonel’s manner has been just a trifle       cavalier to me. I am inclined now to have a little amusement at       his expense. Say nothing to him about the horse.”        “Certainly not without your permission.”        “And of course this is all quite a minor point compared to the       question of who killed John Straker.”        “And you will devote yourself to that?”        “On the contrary, we both go back to London by the night train.”        I was thunderstruck by my friend’s words. We had only been a few       hours in Devonshire, and that he should give up an investigation       which he had begun so brilliantly was quite incomprehensible to       me. Not a word more could I draw from him until we were back at       the trainer’s house. The Colonel and the Inspector were awaiting       us in the parlour.        “My friend and I return to town by the night-express,” said       Holmes. “We have had a charming little breath of your beautiful       Dartmoor air.”        The Inspector opened his eyes, and the Colonel’s lip curled in a       sneer.        “So you despair of arresting the murderer of poor Straker,” said       he.        Holmes shrugged his shoulders. “There are certainly grave       difficulties in the way,” said he. “I have every hope, however,       that your horse will start upon Tuesday, and I beg that you will       have your jockey in readiness. Might I ask for a photograph of       Mr. John Straker?”        The Inspector took one from an envelope and handed it to him.        “My dear Gregory, you anticipate all my wants. If I might ask you       to wait here for an instant, I have a question which I should       like to put to the maid.”        “I must say that I am rather disappointed in our London       consultant,” said Colonel Ross, bluntly, as my friend left the       room. “I do not see that we are any further than when he came.”        “At least you have his assurance that your horse will run,” said       I.        “Yes, I have his assurance,” said the Colonel, with a shrug of       his shoulders. “I should prefer to have the horse.”        I was about to make some reply in defence of my friend when he       entered the room again.        “Now, gentlemen,” said he, “I am quite ready for Tavistock.”        As we stepped into the carriage one of the stable-lads held the       door open for us. A sudden idea seemed to occur to Holmes, for he       leaned forward and touched the lad upon the sleeve.        “You have a few sheep in the paddock,” he said. “Who attends to       them?”        “I do, sir.”        “Have you noticed anything amiss with them of late?”        “Well, sir, not of much account; but three of them have gone       lame, sir.”        I could see that Holmes was extremely pleased, for he chuckled       and rubbed his hands together.        “A long shot, Watson; a very long shot,” said he, pinching my       arm. “Gregory, let me recommend to your attention this singular       epidemic among the sheep. Drive on, coachman!”        Colonel Ross still wore an expression which showed the poor       opinion which he had formed of my companion’s ability, but I saw       by the Inspector’s face that his attention had been keenly       aroused.        “You consider that to be important?” he asked.        “Exceedingly so.”        “Is there any point to which you would wish to draw my       attention?”        “To the curious incident of the dog in the night-time.”        “The dog did nothing in the night-time.”        “That was the curious incident,” remarked Sherlock Holmes.        Four days later Holmes and I were again in the train, bound for       Winchester to see the race for the Wessex Cup. Colonel Ross met       us by appointment outside the station, and we drove in his drag       to the course beyond the town. His face was grave, and his manner       was cold in the extreme.        “I have seen nothing of my horse,” said he.        “I suppose that you would know him when you saw him?” asked       Holmes.        The Colonel was very angry. “I have been on the turf for twenty       years, and never was asked such a question as that before,” said       he. “A child would know Silver Blaze, with his white forehead and       his mottled off-foreleg.”        “How is the betting?”        “Well, that is the curious part of it. You could have got fifteen       to one yesterday, but the price has become shorter and shorter,       until you can hardly get three to one now.”        “Hum!” said Holmes. “Somebody knows something, that is clear.”        As the drag drew up in the enclosure near the grand stand I       glanced at the card to see the entries. It ran:—        Wessex Plate. 50 sovs each h ft with 1000 sovs added for four and       five year olds. Second, £300. Third, £200. New course (one mile       and five furlongs).       1. Mr. Heath Newton’s The Negro (red cap, cinnamon jacket).       2. Colonel Wardlaw’s Pugilist (pink cap, blue and black jacket).       3. Lord Backwater’s Desborough (yellow cap and sleeves).       4. Colonel Ross’s Silver Blaze (black cap, red jacket).       5. Duke of Balmoral’s Iris (yellow and black stripes).       6. Lord Singleford’s Rasper (purple cap, black sleeves).        “We scratched our other one, and put all hopes on your word,”       said the Colonel. “Why, what is that? Silver Blaze favourite?”        “Five to four against Silver Blaze!” roared the ring. “Five to       four against Silver Blaze! Five to fifteen against Desborough!       Five to four on the field!”        “There are the numbers up,” I cried. “They are all six there.”        “All six there? Then my horse is running,” cried the Colonel in       great agitation. “But I don’t see him. My colours have not       passed.”        “Only five have passed. This must be he.”        As I spoke a powerful bay horse swept out from the weighing       enclosure and cantered past us, bearing on its back the       well-known black and red of the Colonel.        “That’s not my horse,” cried the owner. “That beast has not a       white hair upon its body. What is this that you have done, Mr.       Holmes?”        “Well, well, let us see how he gets on,” said my friend,       imperturbably. For a few minutes he gazed through my field-glass.       “Capital! An excellent start!” he cried suddenly. “There they       are, coming round the curve!”        From our drag we had a superb view as they came up the straight.       The six horses were so close together that a carpet could have       covered them, but half way up the yellow of the Mapleton stable       showed to the front. Before they reached us, however,       Desborough’s bolt was shot, and the Colonel’s horse, coming away       with a rush, passed the post a good six lengths before its rival,       the Duke of Balmoral’s Iris making a bad third.        “It’s my race, anyhow,” gasped the Colonel, passing his hand over       his eyes. “I confess that I can make neither head nor tail of it.       Don’t you think that you have kept up your mystery long enough,       Mr. Holmes?”        “Certainly, Colonel, you shall know everything. Let us all go       round and have a look at the horse together. Here he is,” he       continued, as we made our way into the weighing enclosure, where       only owners and their friends find admittance. “You have only to       wash his face and his leg in spirits of wine, and you will find       that he is the same old Silver Blaze as ever.”        “You take my breath away!”        “I found him in the hands of a faker, and took the liberty of       running him just as he was sent over.”        “My dear sir, you have done wonders. The horse looks very fit and       well. It never went better in its life. I owe you a thousand       apologies for having doubted your ability. You have done me a       great service by recovering my horse. You would do me a greater       still if you could lay your hands on the murderer of John       Straker.”        “I have done so,” said Holmes quietly.        The Colonel and I stared at him in amazement. “You have got him!       Where is he, then?”        “He is here.”        “Here! Where?”        “In my company at the present moment.”        The Colonel flushed angrily. “I quite recognise that I am under       obligations to you, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “but I must regard what       you have just said as either a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/834"],["title","The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (#5)"],["body","bad joke or an insult.”        Sherlock Holmes laughed. “I assure you that I have not associated       you with the crime, Colonel,” said he. “The real murderer is       standing immediately behind you.” He stepped past and laid his       hand upon the glossy neck of the thoroughbred.        “The horse!” cried both the Colonel and myself.        “Yes, the horse. And it may lessen his guilt if I say that it was       done in self-defence, and that John Straker was a man who was       entirely unworthy of your confidence. But there goes the bell,       and as I stand to win a little on this next race, I shall defer a       lengthy explanation until a more fitting time.”        We had the corner of a Pullman car to ourselves that evening as       we whirled back to London, and I fancy that the journey was a       short one to Colonel Ross as well as to myself, as we listened to       our companion’s narrative of the events which had occurred at the       Dartmoor training-stables upon the Monday night, and the means by       which he had unravelled them.        “I confess,” said he, “that any theories which I had formed from       the newspaper reports were entirely erroneous. And yet there were       indications there, had they not been overlaid by other details       which concealed their true import. I went to Devonshire with the       conviction that Fitzroy Simpson was the true culprit, although,       of course, I saw that the evidence against him was by no means       complete. It was while I was in the carriage, just as we reached       the trainer’s house, that the immense significance of the curried       mutton occurred to me. You may remember that I was distrait, and       remained sitting after you had all alighted. I was marvelling in       my own mind how I could possibly have overlooked so obvious a       clue.”        “I confess,” said the Colonel, “that even now I cannot see how it       helps us.”        “It was the first link in my chain of reasoning. Powdered opium       is by no means tasteless. The flavour is not disagreeable, but it       is perceptible. Were it mixed with any ordinary dish the eater       would undoubtedly detect it, and would probably eat no more. A       curry was exactly the medium which would disguise this taste. By       no possible supposition could this stranger, Fitzroy Simpson,       have caused curry to be served in the trainer’s family that       night, and it is surely too monstrous a coincidence to suppose       that he happened to come along with powdered opium upon the very       night when a dish happened to be served which would disguise the       flavour. That is unthinkable. Therefore Simpson becomes       eliminated from the case, and our attention centres upon Straker       and his wife, the only two people who could have chosen curried       mutton for supper that night. The opium was added after the dish       was set aside for the stable-boy, for the others had the same for       supper with no ill effects. Which of them, then, had access to       that dish without the maid seeing them?        “Before deciding that question I had grasped the significance of       the silence of the dog, for one true inference invariably       suggests others. The Simpson incident had shown me that a dog was       kept in the stables, and yet, though some one had been in and had       fetched out a horse, he had not barked enough to arouse the two       lads in the loft. Obviously the midnight visitor was some one       whom the dog knew well.        “I was already convinced, or almost convinced, that John Straker       went down to the stables in the dead of the night and took out       Silver Blaze. For what purpose? For a dishonest one, obviously,       or why should he drug his own stable-boy? And yet I was at a loss       to know why. There have been cases before now where trainers have       made sure of great sums of money by laying against their own       horses, through agents, and then preventing them from winning by       fraud. Sometimes it is a pulling jockey. Sometimes it is some       surer and subtler means. What was it here? I hoped that the       contents of his pockets might help me to form a conclusion.        “And they did so. You cannot have forgotten the singular knife       which was found in the dead man’s hand, a knife which certainly       no sane man would choose for a weapon. It was, as Dr. Watson told       us, a form of knife which is used for the most delicate       operations known in surgery. And it was to be used for a delicate       operation that night. You must know, with your wide experience of       turf matters, Colonel Ross, that it is possible to make a slight       nick upon the tendons of a horse’s ham, and to do it       subcutaneously, so as to leave absolutely no trace. A horse so       treated would develop a slight lameness, which would be put down       to a strain in exercise or a touch of rheumatism, but never to       foul play.”        “Villain! Scoundrel!” cried the Colonel.        “We have here the explanation of why John Straker wished to take       the horse out on to the moor. So spirited a creature would have       certainly roused the soundest of sleepers when it felt the prick       of the knife. It was absolutely necessary to do it in the open       air.”        “I have been blind!” cried the Colonel. “Of course that was why       he needed the candle, and struck the match.”        “Undoubtedly. But in examining his belongings I was fortunate       enough to discover not only the method of the crime, but even its       motives. As a man of the world, Colonel, you know that men do not       carry other people’s bills about in their pockets. We have most       of us quite enough to do to settle our own. I at once concluded       that Straker was leading a double life, and keeping a second       establishment. The nature of the bill showed that there was a       lady in the case, and one who had expensive tastes. Liberal as       you are with your servants, one can hardly expect that they can       buy twenty-guinea walking dresses for their ladies. I questioned       Mrs. Straker as to the dress without her knowing it, and having       satisfied myself that it had never reached her, I made a note of       the milliner’s address, and felt that by calling there with       Straker’s photograph I could easily dispose of the mythical       Derbyshire.        “From that time on all was plain. Straker had led out the horse       to a hollow where his light would be invisible. Simpson in his       flight had dropped his cravat, and Straker had picked it up—with       some idea, perhaps, that he might use it in securing the horse’s       leg. Once in the hollow, he had got behind the horse and had       struck a light; but the creature frightened at the sudden glare,       and with the strange instinct of animals feeling that some       mischief was intended, had lashed out, and the steel shoe had       struck Straker full on the forehead. He had already, in spite of       the rain, taken off his overcoat in order to do his delicate       task, and so, as he fell, his knife gashed his thigh. Do I make       it clear?”        “Wonderful!” cried the Colonel. “Wonderful! You might have been       there!”        “My final shot was, I confess a very long one. It struck me that       so astute a man as Straker would not undertake this delicate       tendon-nicking without a little practice. What could he practice       on? My eyes fell upon the sheep, and I asked a question which,       rather to my surprise, showed that my surmise was correct.        “When I returned to London I called upon the milliner, who had       recognised Straker as an excellent customer of the name of       Derbyshire, who had a very dashing wife, with a strong partiality       for expensive dresses. I have no doubt that this woman had       plunged him over head and ears in debt, and so led him into this       miserable plot.”        “You have explained all but one thing,” cried the Colonel. “Where       was the horse?”        “Ah, it bolted, and was cared for by one of your neighbours. We       must have an amnesty in that direction, I think. This is Clapham       Junction, if I am not mistaken, and we shall be in Victoria in       less than ten minutes. If you care to smoke a cigar in our rooms,       Colonel, I shall be happy to give you any other details which       might interest you.”     II. The Adventure of the Cardboard Box         In choosing a few typical cases which illustrate the remarkable       mental qualities of my friend, Sherlock Holmes, I have       endeavoured, as far as possible, to select those which presented       the minimum of sensationalism, while offering a fair field for       his talents. It is, however, unfortunately impossible entirely to       separate the sensational from the criminal, and a chronicler is       left in the dilemma that he must either sacrifice details which       are essential to his statement and so give a false impression of       the problem, or he must use matter which chance, and not choice,       has provided him with. With this short preface I shall turn to my       notes of what proved to be a strange, though a peculiarly       terrible, chain of events.        It was a blazing hot day in August. Baker Street was like an       oven, and the glare of the sunlight upon the yellow brickwork of       the house across the road was painful to the eye. It was hard to       believe that these were the same walls which loomed so gloomily       through the fogs of winter. Our blinds were half-drawn, and       Holmes lay curled upon the sofa, reading and re-reading a letter       which he had received by the morning post. For myself, my term of       service in India had trained me to stand heat better than cold,       and a thermometer at ninety was no hardship. But the morning       paper "]]]
