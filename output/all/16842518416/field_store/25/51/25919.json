But as he left the house he set his teeth, exclaiming low to himself, \"Yes, tomorrow there shall be an end of this! We must risk everything and abide the consequences now. I'll have no more torment for any of us.\"     Chapter VII  THE SECRET KEY   \"Is Lady Trevlyn at home, Bedford?\" asked Paul, as he presented himself at an early hour next day, wearing the keen, stern expression which made him look ten years older than he was.  \"No, sir, my lady and Miss Lillian went down to the Hall last night.\"  \"No ill news, I hope?\" And the young man's eye kindled as if he felt a crisis at hand.  \"Not that I heard, sir. Miss Lillian took one of her sudden whims and would have gone alone, if my lady hadn't given in much against her will, this being a time when she is better away from the place.\"  \"Did they leave no message for me?\"  \"Yes, sir. Will you step in and read the note at your ease. We are in sad confusion, but this room is in order.\"  Leading the way to Lillian's boudoir, the man presented the note and retired. A few hasty lines from my lady, regretting the necessity of this abrupt departure, yet giving no reason for it, hoping they might meet next season, but making no allusion to seeing him at the Hall, desiring Lillian's thanks and regards, but closing with no hint of Helen, except compliments. Paul smiled as he threw it into the fire, saying to himself, \"Poor lady, she thinks she has escaped the danger by flying, and Lillian tries to hide her trouble from me. Tender little heart! I'll comfort it without delay.\"  He sat looking about the dainty room still full of tokens of her presence. The piano stood open with a song he liked upon the rack; a bit of embroidery, whose progress he had often watched, lay in her basket with the little thimble near it; there was a strew of papers on the writing table, torn notes, scraps of drawing, and ball cards; a pearl-colored glove lay on the floor; and in the grate the faded flowers he had brought two days before. As his eye roved to and fro, he seemed to enjoy some happy dream, broken too soon by the sound of servants shutting up the house. He arose but lingered near the table, as if longing to search for some forgotten hint of himself.  \"No, there has been enough lock picking and stealthy work; I'll do no more for her sake. This theft will harm no one and tell no tales.\" And snatching up the glove, Paul departed.  \"Helen, the time has come. Are you ready?\" he asked, entering her room an hour later.  \"I am ready.\" And rising, she stretched her hand to him with a proud expression, contrasting painfully with her helpless gesture.  \"They have gone to the Hall, and we must follow. It is useless to wait longer; we gain nothing by it, and the claim must stand on such proof as we have, or fall for want of that one link. I am tired of disguise. I want to be myself and enjoy what I have won, unless I lose it all.\"  \"Paul, whatever happens, remember we cling together and share good or evil fortune as we always have done. I am a burden, but I cannot live without you, for you are my world. Do not desert me.\"  She groped her way to him and clung to his strong arm as if it was her only stay. Paul drew her close, saying wistfully, as he caressed the beautiful sightless face leaning on his shoulder, \"_Mia cara_, would it break your heart, if at the last hour I gave up all and let the word remain unspoken? My courage fails me, and in spite of the hard past I would gladly leave them in peace.\"  \"No, no, you shall not give it up!\" cried Helen almost fiercely, while the slumbering fire of her southern nature flashed into her face. \"You have waited so long, worked so hard, suffered so much, you must not lose your reward. You promised, and you must keep the promise.\"  \"But it is so beautiful, so noble to forgive, and return a blessing for a curse. Let us bury the old feud, and right the old wrong in a new way. Those two are so blameless, it is cruel to visit the sins of the dead on their innocent heads. My lady has suffered enough already, and Lillian is so young, so happy, so unfit to meet a storm like this. Oh, Helen, mercy is more divine than justice.\"  Something moved Paul deeply, and Helen seemed about to yield, when the name of Lillian wrought a subtle change in her. The color died out of her face, her black eyes burned with a gloomy fire, and her voice was relentless as she answered, while her frail hands held him fast, \"I will not let you give it up. We are as innocent as they; we have suffered more; and we deserve our rights, for we have no sin to expiate. Go on, Paul, and forget the sentimental folly that unmans you.\"  Something in her words seemed to sting or wound him. His face darkened, and he put her away, saying briefly, \"Let it be so then. In an hour we must go.\"  On the evening of the same day, Lady Trevlyn and her daughter sat together in the octagon room at the Hall. Twilight was falling and candles were not yet brought, but a cheery fire blazed in the wide chimney, filling the apartment with a ruddy glow, turning Lillian's bright hair to gold and lending a tinge of color to my lady's pallid cheeks. The girl sat on a low lounging chair before the fire, her head on her hand, her eyes on the red embers, her thoughts--where? My lady lay on her couch, a little in the shadow, regarding her daughter with an anxious air, for over the young face a somber change had passed which filled her with disquiet.  \"You are out of spirits, love,\" she said at last, breaking the long silence, as Lillian gave an unconscious sigh and leaned wearily into the depths of her chair.  \"Yes, Mamma, a little.\"  \"What is it? Are you ill?\"  \"No, Mamma; I think London gaiety is rather too much for me. I'm too young for it, as you often say, and I've found it out.\"  \"Then it is only weariness that makes you so pale and grave, and so bent on coming back here?\"  Lillian was the soul of truth, and with a moment's hesitation answered slowly, \"Not that alone, Mamma. I'm worried about other things. Don't ask me what, please.\"  \"But I must ask. Tell me, child, what things? Have you seen any one? Had letters, or been annoyed in any way about--anything?\"  My lady spoke with sudden energy and rose on her arm, eyeing the girl with unmistakable suspicion and excitement.  \"No, Mamma, it's only a foolish trouble of my own,\" answered Lillian, with a glance of surprise and a shamefaced look as the words reluctantly left her lips.  \"Ah, a love trouble, nothing more? Thank God for that!\" And my lady sank back as if a load was off her mind. \"Tell me all, my darling; there is no confidante like a mother.\"  \"You are very kind, and perhaps you can cure my folly if I tell it, and yet I am ashamed,\" murmured the girl. Then yielding to an irresistible impulse to ask help and sympathy, she added, in an almost inaudible tone, \"I came away to escape from Paul.\"  \"Because he loves you, Lillian?\" asked my lady, with a frown and a half smile.  \"Because he does _not_ love me, Mamma.\" And the poor girl hid her burning cheeks in her hands, as if overwhelmed with maidenly shame at the implied confession of her own affection.  \"My child, how is this? I cannot but be glad that he does _not_ love you; yet it fills me with grief to see that this pains you. He is not a mate for you, Lillian. Remember this, and forget the transient regard that has sprung up from that early intimacy of yours.\"  \"He is wellborn, and now my equal in fortune, and oh, so much my superior in all gifts of mind and heart,\" sighed the girl, still with hidden face, for tears were dropping through her slender fingers.  \"It may be, but there is a mystery about him; and I have a vague dislike to him in spite of all that has passed. But, darling, are you sure he does not care for you? I fancied I read a different story in his face, and when you begged to leave town so suddenly, I believed that you had seen this also, and kindly wished to spare him any pain.\"  \"It was to spare myself. Oh, Mamma, he loves Helen, and will marry her although she is blind. He told me this, with a look I could not doubt, and so I came away to hide my sorrow,\" sobbed poor Lillian in despair.  Lady Trevlyn went to her and, laying the bright head on her motherly bosom, said soothingly as she caressed it, \"My little girl, it is too soon for you to know these troubles, and I am punished for yielding to your entreaties for a peep at the gay world. It is now too late to spare you this; you have had your wish and must pay its price, dear. But, Lillian, call pride to aid you, and conquer this fruitless love. It cannot be very deep as yet, for you have known Paul, the man, too short a time to be hopelessly enamored. Remember, there are others, better, braver, more worthy of you; that life is long, and full of pleasure yet untried.\"  \"Have no fears for me, Mamma. I'll not disgrace you or myself by any sentimental folly. I do love Paul, but I can conquer it, and I will. Give me a little time, and you shall see me quite myself again.\"  Lillian lifted her head with an air of proud resolve that satisfied her mother, and with a grateful kiss stole away to ease her full heart alone. As she disappeared Lady Trevlyn drew a long breath and, clasping her hands with a gesture of thanksgiving, murmured to herself in an accent of relief, \"Only a love sorrow! I feared it was some new terror like the old one. Seventeen years of silence, seventeen years of secret dread and remorse for me,\" she said, pacing the room with tightly locked hands and eyes full of unspeakable anguish. \"Oh, Richard, Richard! I forgave you long ago, and surely I have expiated my innocent offense by these years of suffering! For her sake I did it, and for her sake I still keep dumb. God knows I ask nothing for myself but rest and oblivion by your side.\"  Half an hour later, Paul stood at the hall door. It was ajar, for the family had returned unexpectedly, as was evident from the open doors and empty halls. Entering unseen, he ascended to the room "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8190"],["title","A Wodehouse Miscellany: Articles & Stories (#0)"],["body","WODEHOUSE MISCELLANY  Articles & Stories    By P.

Of the first class, the keen and regular player, little need be said. A keen player is a gem of purest rays serene, and when to his keenness he adds regularity and punctuality, life ceases to become the mere hollow blank that it would otherwise become, and joy reigns supreme.  The absolute slacker (to take the worst at once, and have done with it) needs the pen of a Swift before adequate justice can be done to his enormities. He is a blot, an excrescence. All those moments which are not spent in avoiding games (by means of that leave which is unanimously considered the peculiar property of the French nation) he uses in concocting ingenious excuses. Armed with these, he faces with calmness the disgusting curiosity of the Game-Captain, who officiously desires to know the reason of his non-appearance on the preceding day. These excuses are of the \"had-to-go-and-see-a-man-about-a-dog\" type, and rarely meet with that success for which their author hopes. In the end he discovers that his chest is weak, or his heart is subject to palpitations, and he forthwith produces a document to this effect, signed by a doctor. This has the desirable result of muzzling the tyrannical Game-Captain, whose sole solace is a look of intense and withering scorn. But this is seldom fatal, and generally, we rejoice to say, ineffectual.  The next type is the partial slacker. He differs from the absolute slacker in that at rare intervals he actually turns up, changed withal into the garb of the game, and thirsting for the fray. At this point begins the time of trouble for the Game-Captain. To begin with, he is forced by stress of ignorance to ask the newcomer his name. This is, of course, an insult of the worst kind. \"A being who does not know my name,\" argues the partial slacker, \"must be something not far from a criminal lunatic.\" The name is, however, extracted, and the partial slacker strides to the arena. Now arises insult No. 2. He is wearing his cap. A hint as to the advisability of removing this pièce de résistance not being taken, he is ordered to assume a capless state, and by these means a coolness springs up between him and the G. C. Of this the Game-Captain is made aware when the game commences. The partial slacker, scorning to insert his head in the scrum, assumes a commanding position outside and from this point criticises the Game-Captain's decisions with severity and pith. The last end of the partial slacker is generally a sad one. Stung by some pungent home-thrust, the Game-Captain is fain to try chastisement, and by these means silences the enemy's battery.  Sometimes the classes overlap. As for instance, a keen and regular player may, by some more than usually gross bit of bungling on the part of the G.-C., be moved to a fervour and eloquence worthy of Juvenal. Or, again, even the absolute slacker may for a time emulate the keen player, provided an opponent plant a shrewd kick on a tender spot. But, broadly speaking, there are only three classes.     AN UNFINISHED COLLECTION   A silence had fallen upon the smoking room. The warrior just back from the front had enquired after George Vanderpoop, and we, who knew that George's gentle spirit had, to use a metaphor after his own heart, long since been withdrawn from circulation, were feeling uncomfortable and wondering how to break the news.  Smithson is our specialist in tact, and we looked to him to be spokesman.  \"George,\" said Smithson at last, \"the late George Vanderpoop----\"  \"Late!\" exclaimed the warrior; \"is he dead?\"  \"As a doornail,\" replied Smithson sadly. \"Perhaps you would care to hear the story. It is sad, but interesting. You may recollect that, when you sailed, he was starting his journalistic career. For a young writer he had done remarkably well. The _Daily Telephone_ had printed two of his contributions to their correspondence column, and a bright pen picture of his, describing how Lee's Lozenges for the Liver had snatched him from almost certain death, had quite a vogue. Lee, I believe, actually commissioned him to do a series on the subject.\"  \"Well?\" said the warrior.  \"Well, he was, as I say, prospering very fairly, when in an unlucky moment he began to make a collection of editorial rejection forms. He had always been a somewhat easy prey to scourges of that description. But when he had passed safely through a sharp attack of Philatelism and a rather nasty bout of Autographomania, everyone hoped and believed that he had turned the corner. The progress of his last illness was very rapid. Within a year he wanted but one specimen to make the complete set. This was the one published from the offices of the _Scrutinizer_. All the rest he had obtained with the greatest ease. I remember his telling me that a single short story of his, called 'The Vengeance of Vera Dalrymple,' had been instrumental in securing no less than thirty perfect specimens. Poor George! I was with him when he made his first attempt on the _Scrutinizer_. He had baited his hook with an essay on Evolution. He read me one or two passages from it. I stopped him at the third paragraph, and congratulated him in advance, little thinking that it was sympathy rather than congratulations that he needed. When I saw him a week afterwards he was looking haggard. I questioned him, and by slow degrees drew out the story. The article on Evolution had been printed.  \"'Never say die, George,' I said. 'Send them \"Vera Dalrymple.\" No paper can take that.'  \"He sent it. The _Scrutinizer_, which had been running for nearly a century without publishing a line of fiction, took it and asked for more. It was as if there were an editorial conspiracy against him.\"  \"Well?\" said the man of war.  \"Then,\" said Smithson, \"George pulled himself together. He wrote a parody of 'The Minstrel Boy.' I have seen a good many parodies, but never such a parody as that. By return of post came a long envelope bearing the crest of the _Scrutinizer_. 'At last,' he said, as he tore it open.  \"'George, old man,' I said, 'your hand.'  \"He looked at me a full minute. Then with a horrible, mirthless laugh he fell to the ground, and expired almost instantly. You will readily guess what killed him. The poem had been returned, _but without a rejection form!_\"     THE NEW ADVERTISING   \"In Denmark,\" said the man of ideas, coming into the smoking room, \"I see that they have original ideas on the subject of advertising. According to the usually well-informed Daily Lyre, all 'bombastic' advertising is punished with a fine. The advertiser is expected to describe his wares in restrained, modest language. In case this idea should be introduced into England, I have drawn up a few specimen advertisements which, in my opinion, combine attractiveness with a shrinking modesty at which no censor could cavil.\"  And in spite of our protests, he began to read us his first effort, descriptive of a patent medicine.  \"It runs like this,\" he said:       Timson's Tonic for Distracted Deadbeats      Has been known to cure      We Hate to Seem to Boast,      but      Many Who have Tried It Are Still      Alive         *       *       *       *       *       Take a Dose or Two in Your Spare Time      It's Not Bad Stuff         *       *       *       *       *       Read what an outside stockbroker says:      \"Sir--After three months' steady absorption of your Tonic      I was no worse.\"         *       *       *       *       *       We do not wish to thrust ourselves forward in any way. If      you prefer other medicines, by all means take them. Only we      just thought we'd mention it--casually, as it were--that TIMSON'S      is PRETTY GOOD.  \"How's that?\" inquired the man of ideas. \"Attractive, I fancy, without being bombastic. Now, one about a new novel. Ready?\"         MR.

We told him.     THE SECRET PLEASURES OF REGINALD   I found Reggie in the club one Saturday afternoon. He was reclining in a long chair, motionless, his eyes fixed glassily on the ceiling. He frowned a little when I spoke. \"You don't seem to be doing anything,\" I said.  \"It's not what I'm doing, it's what I am _not_ doing that matters.\"  It sounded like an epigram, but epigrams are so little associated with Reggie that I ventured to ask what he meant.  He sighed. \"Ah well,\" he said. \"I suppose"]]]
