But in that small assembly there were two who did not attract the notice of Duplessis or of the lady of the Imperial Court.  While the Prince ---- and the placid Looker-on were engaged at a contest of ecarte, with the lively Venosta, for the gallery, interposing criticisms and admonitions, Isaura was listlessly turning over a collection of photographs, strewed on a table that stood near to an open window in the remoter angle of the room, communicating with a long and wide balcony filled partially with flowers and overlooking the Champs Elysees, softly lit up by the innumerable summer stars.  Suddenly a whisper, the command of which she could not resist, thrilled through her ear, and sent the blood rushing back to her heart.  \"Do you remember that evening at Enghien?  how I said that our imagination could not carry us beyond the question whether we two should be gazing together that night twelve months on that star which each of us had singled out from the hosts of heaven?  That was the 8th of July.  It is the 8th of July once more.  Come and seek for our chosen star--come. I have something to say, which say I must.  Come.\"  Mechanically, as it were,--mechanically, as they tell us the Somnambulist obeys the Mesmeriser,--Isaura obeyed that summons.  In a kind of dreamy submission she followed his steps, and found herself on the balcony, flowers around her and stars above, by the side of the man who had been to her that being ever surrounded by flowers and lighted by stars,--the ideal of Romance to the heart of virgin Woman.  \"Isaura,\" said the Englishman, softly.  At the sound of her own name for the first time heard from those lips, every nerve in her frame quivered. \"Isaura, I have tried to live without you.  I cannot.  You are all in all to me: without you it seems to me as if earth had no flowers, and even heaven had withdrawn its stars.  Are there differences between us, differences of taste, of sentiments, of habits, of thought?  Only let me hope that you can love me a tenth part so much as I love you, and such differences cease to be discord.  Love harmonises all sounds, blends all colours into its own divine oneness of heart and soul.  Look up! is not the star which this time last year invited our gaze above, is it not still there?  Does it not still invite our gaze?  Isaura, speak!\"  \"Hush, hush, hush,\"--the girl could say no more, but she recoiled from his side.  The recoil did not wound him: there was no hate in it.  He advanced, he caught her hand, and continued, in one of those voices which become so musical in summer nights under starry skies:  \"Isaura, there is one name which I can never utter without a reverence due to the religion which binds earth to heaven--a name which to man should be the symbol of life cheered and beautified, exalted, hallowed. That name is 'wife.'  Will you take that name from me?\"  And still Isaura made no reply.  She stood mute, and cold, and rigid as a statue of marble.  At length, as if consciousness had been arrested and was struggling back, she sighed heavily, and passed her hands slowly over her forehead.  \"Mockery, mockery,\" she said then, with a smile half bitter, half plaintive, on her colourless lips.  \"Did you wait to ask me that question till you knew what my answer must be?  I have pledged the name of wife to another.\"  \"No, no; you say that to rebuke, to punish me!  Unsay it! unsay it!\"  Isaura beheld the anguish of his face with bewildered eyes.  \"How can my words pain you?\" she said, drearily.  \"Did you not write that I had unfitted myself to be wife to you?\"  \"I?\"  \"That I had left behind me the peaceful immunities of private life?  I felt you were so right!  Yes!  I am affianced to one who thinks that in spite of that misfortune--\"  \"Stop, I command you--stop!  You saw my letter to Mrs. Morley.  I have not had one moment free from torture and remorse since I wrote it.  But whatever in that letter you might justly resent--\"  \"I did not resent--\"  Graham heard not the interruption, but hurried on.  \"You would forgive could you read my heart.  No matter.  Every sentiment in that letter, except those which conveyed admiration, I retract.  Be mine, and instead of presuming to check in you the irresistible impulse of genius to the first place in the head or the heart of the world, I teach myself to encourage, to share, to exult in it.  Do you know what a difference there is between the absent one and the present one--between the distant image against whom our doubts, our fears, our suspicions, raise up hosts of imaginary giants, barriers of visionary walls, and the beloved face before the sight of which the hosts are fled, the walls are vanished? Isaura, we meet again.  You know now from my own lips that I love you.  I think your lips will not deny that you love me.  You say that you are affianced to another.  Tell the man frankly, honestly, that you mistook your heart.  It is not yours to give.  Save yourself, save him, from a union in which there can be no happiness.\"  \"It is too late,\" said Isaura, with hollow tones, but with no trace of vacillating weakness on her brow and lips.  \"Did I say now to that other one, 'I break the faith that I pledged to you,' I should kill him, body and soul.  Slight thing though I be, to him I am all in all; to you, Mr. Vane, to you a memory--the memory of one whom a year, perhaps a month, hence, you will rejoice to think you have escaped.\"  She passed from him--passed away from the flowers and the starlight; and when Graham,--recovering from the stun of her crushing words, and with the haughty mien and stop of the man who goes forth from the ruin of his hopes, leaning for support upon his pride,--when Graham re-entered the room, all the guests had departed save only Alain, who was still exchanging whispered words with Valerie.     CHAPTER IV.  The next day, at the hour appointed, Graham entered Alain's apartment. \"I am glad to tell you,\" said the Marquis, gaily, \"that the box has arrived, and we will very soon examine its contents.  Breakfast claims precedence.\"  During the meal Alain was in gay spirits, and did not at first notice the gloomy countenance and abstracted mood of his guest.  At length, surprised at the dull response to his lively sallies on the part of a man generally so pleasant in the frankness of his speech, and the cordial ring of his sympathetic laugh, it occurred to him that the change in Graham must be ascribed to something that had gone wrong in the meeting with Isaura the evening before; and remembering the curtness with which Graham had implied disinclination to converse about the fair Italian, he felt perplexed how to reconcile the impulse of his good nature with the discretion imposed on his good-breeding.  At all events, a compliment to the lady whom Graham had so admired could do no harm.  \"How well Mademoiselle Cicogna looked last night!\"  \"Did she?  It seemed to me that, in health at least, she did not look very well.  Have you heard what day M. Thiers will speak on the war?\"  \"Thiers?  No.  Who cares about Thiers?  Thank heaven his day is past! I don't know any unmarried woman in Paris, not even Valerie--I mean Mademoiselle Duplessis--who has so exquisite a taste in dress as Mademoiselle Cicogna.  Generally speaking, the taste of a female author is atrocious.\"  \"Really--I did not observe her dress.  I am no critic on subjects so dainty as the dress of ladies, or the tastes of female authors.\"  \"Pardon me,\" said the beau Marquis, gravely.  \"As to dress, I think that so essential a thing in the mind of woman, that no man who cares about women ought to disdain critical study of it.  In woman, refinement of character is never found in vulgarity of dress.  I have only observed that truth since I came up from Bretagne.\"  \"I presume, my dear Marquis, that you may have read in Bretagne books which very few not being professed scholars have ever read at Paris; and possibly you may remember that Horace ascribes the most exquisite refinement in dress, denoted by the untranslatable words, 'simplex munditiis,' to a lady who was not less distinguished by the ease and rapidity with which she could change her affection.  Of course that allusion does not apply to Mademoiselle Cicogna, but there are many other exquisitely dressed ladies at Paris of whom an ill-fated admirer                                   'fidem                     Mutatosque deos flebit.'  \"Now, with your permission, we will adjourn to the box of letters.\"  The box being produced and unlocked, Alain looked with conscientious care at its contents before he passed over to Graham's inspection a few epistles, in which the Englishman immediately detected the same handwriting as that of the letter from Louise which Richard King had bequeathed to him.  They were arranged and numbered chronologically.        LETTER I.       DEAR M. LE MARQUIS,--How can I thank you sufficiently for obtaining      and remitting to me those certificates?  You are too aware of the      unhappy episode in my life not to know how inestimable is the      service you render me.  I am saved all further molestation from the      man who had indeed no right over my freedom, but whose persecution      might compel me to the scandal and disgrace of an appeal to the law      for protection, and the avowal of the illegal marriage into which I      was duped.  I would rather be torn limb from limb by wild horses,      like the Queen in the history books, than dishonour myself and the      ancestry which I may at least claim on the mother's side, by      proclaiming that I had lived with that low Englishman as his wife,      when I was only--O heavens, I cannot conclude the sentence!       \"No, Mons. le Marquis, I am in no want of the pecuniary aid you so      generously wish to press on me.

At all events, I will write to you again soon, and I      entreat you to let me know all you can learn about my uncle.  I feel      so grateful to you for your just disbelief of the horrible calumny      which must be so intolerably galling to a man so proud, and,      whatever his errors, so incapable of a baseness.       \"Direct to me Poste restante, Augsburg.       \"Yours with all consideration,   LETTER II.  (Seven months after the date of Letter 1.)       \"AUGSBURG.       \"DEAR M. LE MARQUIS,--I thank you for your kind little note      informing me of the pains you have taken, as yet with no result, to      ascertain what has become of my unfortunate uncle.  My life since I      last wrote has been a very quiet one.  I have been teaching among a      few families here; and among my pupils are two little girls of very      high birth.  They have taken so great a fancy to me that their      mother has just asked me to come and reside at their house as      governess.  What wonderfully kind hearts those Germans have,--so      simple, so truthful!  They raise no troublesome questions,--accept      my own story implicitly.\"  Here follow a few commonplace sentences      about the German character, and a postscript.  \"I go into my new      home next week.  When you hear more of my uncle, direct to me at the      Countess von Rudesheim, Schloss  --  ------, near Berlin.\"   \"Rudesheim!\"  Could this be the relation, possibly the wife, of the Count von Rudesheim with whom Graham had formed acquaintance last year?   LETTER III.  (Between three and four years after the date of the last.)       \"You startle me indeed, dear M. le Marquis.  My uncle said to have      been recognised in Algeria under another name, a soldier in the      Algerian army?  My dear, proud, luxurious uncle!  Ah, I cannot      believe it, any more than you do: but I long eagerly for such      further news as you can learn of him.  For myself, I shall perhaps      surprise you when I say I am about to be married.  Nothing can      exceed the amiable kindness I have received from the Rudesheims      since I have been in their house.  For the last year especially I      have been treated on equal terms as one of the family.  Among the      habitual visitors at the house is a gentleman of noble birth, but      not of rank too high, nor of fortune too great, to make a marriage      with the French widowed governess a misalliance.  I am sure that he      loves me sincerely; and he is the only man I ever met whose love I      have cared to win.  We are to be married in the course of the year.      Of course he is ignorant of my painful history, and will never learn      it.  And after all, Louise D---- is dead.  In the home to which I am      about to remove, there is no probability that the wretched      Englishman can ever cross my path.  My secret is as safe with you as      in the grave that holds her whom in the name of Louise D---- you      once loved.  Henceforth I shall trouble you no more with my letters;      but if you hear anything decisively authentic of my uncle's fate,      write me a line at any time, directed as before to Madame  ----,      enclosed to the Countess von Rudesheim.       \"And accept, for all the kindness you have ever shown me, as to one      whom you did not disdain to call a kinswoman, the assurance of my      undying gratitude.  In the alliance she now makes, your kinswoman      does not discredit the name through which she is connected with the      yet loftier line of Rochebriant.\"   To this letter the late Marquis had appended in pencil.  \"Of course Rochebriant never denies the claim of a kinswoman, even though a drawing- master's daughter.  Beautiful creature, Louise, but a termagant.  I could not love Venus if she were a termagant.  L.'s head turned by the unlucky discovery that her mother was noble.  In one form or other, every woman has the same disease--vanity.  Name of her intended not mentioned--easily found out.\"  The next letter was dated May 7, 1859, on black-edged paper, and contained but these lines: \"I was much comforted by your kind visit yesterday, dear Marquis.  My affliction has been heavy: but for the last two years my poor husband's conduct has rendered my life unhappy, and I am recovering the shock of his sudden death.  It is true that I and the children are left very ill provided for; but I cannot accept your generous offer of aid.  Have no fear as to my future fate.  Adieu, my dear Marquis!  This will reach you just before you start for Naples. _Bon voyage_.\"  There was no address on this note-no postmark on the envelope- evidently sent by hand.  The last note, dated 1861, March 20, was briefer than its predecessor. \"I have taken your advice, dear Marquis; and, overcoming all scruples, I have accepted his kind offer, on the condition that I am never to be taken to England.  I had no option in this marriage.  I can now own to you that my poverty had become urgent.--Yours, with inalienable gratitude.  This last note, too, was without postmark, and was evidently sent by hand.  \"There are no other letters, then, from this writer?\" asked Graham; \"and no further clue as to her existence?\"  \"None that I have discovered; and I see now why I preserved these letters.  There is nothing in their contents not creditable to my poor father.  They show how capable he was of good-natured disinterested kindness towards even a distant relation of whom he could certainly not have been proud, judging not only by his own pencilled note, or by the writer's condition as a governess, but by her loose sentiments as to the marriage tie.  I have not the slightest idea who she could be.  I never at least heard of one connected, however distantly, with my family, whom I could identify with the writer of these letters.\"  \"I may hold them a short time in my possession?\"  \"Pardon me a preliminary question.  If I may venture to form a conjecture, the object of your search must be connected with your countryman, whom the lady politely calls the 'wretched Englishman;' but I own I should not like to lend, through these letters, a pretence to any steps that may lead to a scandal in which my father's name or that of any member of my family could be mixed up.\"  \"Marquis, it is to prevent the possibility of all scandal that I ask you to trust these letters to my discretion.\"  \"_Foi de gentilhomme_?\"  \"_Foi de gentilhomme_!\"  \"Take them.  When and where shall we meet again?\"  \"Soon, I trust; but I must leave Paris this evening.  I am bound to Berlin in quest of this Countess von Rudesheim: and I fear that in a very few days intercourse between France and the German frontier will be closed upon travellers.\"  After a few more words not worth recording, the two young men shook hands and parted.     CHAPTER V.  It was with an interest languid and listless indeed, compared with that which he would have felt a day before, that Graham mused over the remarkable advances towards the discovery of Louise Duval which were made in the letters he had perused.  She had married, then, first a foreigner, whom she spoke of as noble, and whose name and residence could be easily found through the Countess von Rudesheim.  The marriage did not seem to have been a happy one.  Left a widow in reduced circumstances, she had married again, evidently without affection.  She was living so late as 1861, and she had children living is 1859: was the child referred to by Richard King one of them?  The tone and style of the letters served to throw some light on the character of the writer: they evinced pride, stubborn self-will, and unamiable hardness of nature; but her rejection of all pecuniary aid from a man like the late Marquis de Rochebriant betokened a certain dignity of sentiment.  She was evidently, whatever her strange ideas about her first marriage with Richard King, no vulgar woman of gallantry; and there must have been some sort of charm about her to have excited a friendly interest in a kinsman so remote, and a man of pleasure so selfish, as her high-born correspondent.  But what now, so far as concerned his own happiness, was the hope, the probable certainty, of a speedy fulfilment of the trust bequeathed to him?  Whether the result, in the death of the mother, and more especially of the child, left him rich, or, if the last survived, reduced his fortune to a modest independence, Isaura was equally lost to him, and fortune became valueless.  But his first emotions on recovering from the shock of hearing from Isaura's lips that she was irrevocably affianced to another, were not those of self-reproach.  They were those of intense bitterness against her who, if really so much attached to him as he had been led to hope, could within so brief a time reconcile her heart to marriage with another.  This bitterness was no doubt unjust; but I believe it to be natural to men of a nature so proud and of affections so intense as Graham's, under similar defeats of hope.  Resentment is the first impulse in a man loving with the whole ardour of his soul, rejected, no matter why or wherefore, by the woman by whom he had cause to believe he himself was beloved; and though Graham's standard of honour was certainly the reverse of low, yet man does not view honour in the same light as woman does, when involved in analogous difficulties of position.  Graham conscientiously thought that if Isaura so loved him as to render distasteful an engagement to another which could only very recently have been contracted, it would be more honourable frankly so to"]]]
