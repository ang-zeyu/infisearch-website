Don't be frightened; we don't want to hurt you, you know.\"  \"Hurt _me_!\" it said. \"_Me_ frightened? Upon my word! Why, you talk as if I were nobody in particular.\" All its fur stood out like a cat's when it is going to fight.  \"Well,\" said Anthea, still kindly, \"perhaps if we knew who you are in particular we could think of something to say that wouldn't make you angry. Everything we've said so far seems to have done so. Who are you? And don't get angry! Because really we don't know.\"  \"You don't know?\" it said. \"Well, I knew the world had changed--but--well, really--Do you mean to tell me seriously you don't know a Psammead when you see one?\"  \"A Sammyadd? That's Greek to me.\"  \"So it is to everyone,\" said the creature sharply. \"Well, in plain English, then, a _Sand-fairy_. Don't you know a Sand-fairy when you see one?\"  It looked so grieved and hurt that Jane hastened to say, \"Of course I see you are, _now_. It's quite plain now one comes to look at you.\"  \"You came to look at me, several sentences ago,\" it said crossly, beginning to curl up again in the sand.  \"Oh--don't go away again! Do talk some more,\" Robert cried. \"I didn't know you were a Sand-fairy, but I knew directly I saw you that you were much the wonderfullest thing I'd ever seen.\"  The Sand-fairy seemed a shade less disagreeable after this.  \"It isn't talking I mind,\" it said, \"as long as you're reasonably civil. But I'm not going to make polite conversation for you. If you talk nicely to me, perhaps I'll answer you, and perhaps I won't. Now say something.\"  Of course no one could think of anything to say, but at last Robert thought of \"How long have you lived here?\" and he said it at once.  \"Oh, ages--several thousand years,\" replied the Psammead.  \"Tell us about it. Do.\"  \"It's all in books.\"  \"_You_ aren't!\" Jane said. \"Oh, tell us everything you can about yourself! We don't know anything about you, and you _are_ so nice.\"  The Sand-fairy smoothed his long rat-like whiskers and smiled between them.  \"Do please tell!\" said the children all together.  It is wonderful how quickly you get used to things, even the most astonishing. Five minutes before, the children had had no more idea than you had that there was such a thing as a Sand-fairy in the world, and now they were talking to it as though they had known it all their lives.  It drew its eyes in and said--  \"How very sunny it is--quite like old times! Where do you get your Megatheriums from now?\"  \"What?\" said the children all at once. It is very difficult always to remember that \"what\" is not polite, especially in moments of surprise or agitation.  \"Are Pterodactyls plentiful now?\" the Sand-fairy went on.  The children were unable to reply.  \"What do you have for breakfast?\" the Fairy said impatiently, \"and who gives it to you?\"  \"Eggs and bacon, and bread and milk, and porridge and things. Mother gives it to us. What are Mega-what's-its-names and Ptero-what-do-you-call-thems? And does anyone have them for breakfast?\"  \"Why, almost everyone had Pterodactyl for breakfast in my time! Pterodactyls were something like crocodiles and something like birds--I believe they were very good grilled. You see, it was like this: of course there were heaps of Sand-fairies then, and in the morning early you went out and hunted for them, and when you'd found one it gave you your wish. People used to send their little boys down to the seashore in the morning before breakfast to get the day's wishes, and very often the eldest boy in the family would be told to wish for a Megatherium, ready jointed for cooking. It was as big as an elephant, you see, so there was a good deal of meat on it. And if they wanted fish, the Ichthyosaurus was asked for,--he was twenty to forty feet long, so there was plenty of him. And for poultry there was the Plesiosaurus; there were nice pickings on that too. Then the other children could wish for other things. But when people had dinner-parties it was nearly always Megatheriums; and Ichthyosaurus, because his fins were a great delicacy and his tail made soup.\"  \"There must have been heaps and heaps of cold meat left over,\" said Anthea, who meant to be a good housekeeper some day.  \"Oh no,\" said the Psammead, \"that would never have done. Why, of course at sunset what was left over turned into stone. You find the stone bones of the Megatherium and things all over the place even now, they tell me.\"  \"Who tell you?\" asked Cyril; but the Sand-fairy frowned and began to dig very fast with its furry hands.  \"Oh, don't go!\" they all cried; \"tell us more about when it was Megatheriums for breakfast! Was the world like this then?\"  It stopped digging.  \"Not a bit,\" it said; \"it was nearly all sand where I lived, and coal grew on trees, and the periwinkles were as big as tea-trays--you find them now; they're turned into stone. We Sand-fairies used to live on the seashore, and the children used to come with their little flint-spades and flint-pails and make castles for us to live in. That's thousands of years ago, but I hear that children still build castles on the sand. It's difficult to break yourself of a habit.\"  \"But why did you stop living in the castles?\" asked Robert.  \"It's a sad story,\" said the Psammead gloomily. \"It was because they _would_ build moats to the castles, and the nasty wet bubbling sea used to come in, and of course as soon as a Sand-fairy got wet it caught cold, and generally died. And so there got to be fewer and fewer, and, whenever you found a fairy and had a wish, you used to wish for a Megatherium, and eat twice as much as you wanted, because it might be weeks before you got another wish.\"  \"And did _you_ get wet?\" Robert inquired.  The Sand-fairy shuddered. \"Only once,\" it said; \"the end of the twelfth hair of my top left whisker--I feel the place still in damp weather. It was only once, but it was quite enough for me. I went away as soon as the sun had dried my poor dear whisker. I scurried away to the back of the beach, and dug myself a house deep in warm dry sand, and there I've been ever since. And the sea changed its lodgings afterwards. And now I'm not going to tell you another thing.\"  \"Just one more, please,\" said the children. \"Can you give wishes now?\"  \"Of course,\" said it; \"didn't I give you yours a few minutes ago? You said, 'I wish you'd come out,' and I did.\"  \"Oh, please, mayn't we have another?\"  \"Yes, but be quick about it. I'm tired of you.\"  I daresay you have often thought what you would do if you had three wishes given you, and have despised the old man and his wife in the black-pudding story, and felt certain that if you had the chance you could think of three really useful wishes without a moment's hesitation. These children had often talked this matter over, but, now the chance had suddenly come to them, they could not make up their minds.  \"Quick,\" said the Sand-fairy crossly. No one could think of anything, only Anthea did manage to remember a private wish of her own and Jane's which they had never told the boys. She knew the boys would not care about it--but still it was better than nothing.  \"I wish we were all as beautiful as the day,\" she said in a great hurry.  The children looked at each other, but each could see that the others were not any better-looking than usual. The Psammead pushed out his long eyes, and seemed to be holding its breath and swelling itself out till it was twice as fat and furry as before. Suddenly it let its breath go in a long sigh.  \"I'm really afraid I can't manage it,\" it said apologetically; \"I must be out of practice.\"  The children were horribly disappointed.  \"Oh, _do_ try again!\" they said.  \"Well,\" said the Sand-fairy, \"the fact is, I was keeping back a little strength to give the rest of you your wishes with. If you'll be contented with one wish a day among the lot of you I daresay I can screw myself up to it. Do you agree to that?\"  \"Yes, oh yes!\" said Jane and Anthea. The boys nodded. They did not believe the Sand-fairy could do it. You can always make girls believe things much easier than you can boys.  It stretched out its eyes farther than ever, and swelled and swelled and swelled.  \"I do hope it won't hurt itself,\" said Anthea.  \"Or crack its skin,\" Robert said anxiously.  Everyone was very much relieved when the Sand-fairy, after getting so big that it almost filled up the hole in the sand, suddenly let out its breath and went back to its proper size.  \"That's all right,\" it said, panting heavily. \"It'll come easier to-morrow.\"  \"Did it hurt much?\" said Anthea.  \"Only my poor whisker, thank you,\" said he, \"but you're a kind and thoughtful child. Good day.\"  It scratched suddenly and fiercely with its hands and feet, and disappeared in the sand.  Then the children looked at each other, and each child suddenly found itself alone with three perfect strangers, all radiantly beautiful.  They stood for some moments in silence. Each thought that its brothers and sisters had wandered off, and that these strange children had stolen up unnoticed while it was watching the swelling form of the Sand-fairy. Anthea spoke first--  \"Excuse me,\" she said very politely to Jane, who now had enormous blue eyes and a cloud of russet hair, \"but have you seen two little boys and a little girl anywhere about?\"  \"I was just going to ask you that,\" said Jane. And then Cyril cried--  \"Why, it's _you_! I know the hole in your pinafore! You _are_ Jane, aren't you? And you're the Panther; I can see your dirty handkerchief that you forgot to change after you'd cut your thumb! The wish _has_ come off, after all. I say, am I as handsome as you are?\"  \"If you're Cyril, I liked you much better as you were before,\" said Anthea decidedly. \"You look like the picture of the young chorister, with your golden hair; you'll die young, I shouldn't wonder. And if that's Robert, he's like an Italian organ-grinder. His hair's all black.\"  \"You two girls are like Christmas cards, then--that's all--silly Christmas cards,\" said"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17314"],["title","Five Children and It (#3)"],["body","angrily. \"And Jane's hair is simply carrots.\"  It was indeed of that Venetian tint so much admired by artists.  \"Well, it's no use finding fault with each other,\" said Anthea; \"let's get the Lamb and lug it home to dinner. The servants will admire us most awfully, you'll see.\"  Baby was just waking up when they got to him, and not one of the children but was relieved to find that he at least was not as beautiful as the day, but just the same as usual.  \"I suppose he's too young to have wishes naturally,\" said Jane. \"We shall have to mention him specially next time.\"  Anthea ran forward and held out her arms.  \"Come, then,\" she said.  The Baby looked at her disapprovingly, and put a sandy pink thumb in his mouth. Anthea was his favourite sister.  \"Come, then,\" she said.  \"G'way 'long!\" said the Baby.  \"Come to own Pussy,\" said Jane.  \"Wants my Panty,\" said the Lamb dismally, and his lip trembled.  \"Here, come on, Veteran,\" said Robert, \"come and have a yidey on Yobby's back.\"  \"Yah, narky narky boy,\" howled the Baby, giving way altogether. Then the children knew the worst. _The Baby did not know them!_  [Illustration: The baby did not know them!]  They looked at each other in despair, and it was terrible to each, in this dire emergency, to meet only the beautiful eyes of perfect strangers, instead of the merry, friendly, commonplace, twinkling, jolly little eyes of its own brothers and sisters.  \"This is most truly awful,\" said Cyril when he had tried to lift up the Lamb, and the Lamb had scratched like a cat and bellowed like a bull! \"We've got to _make friends_ with him! I can't carry him home screaming like that. Fancy having to make friends with our own baby!--it's too silly.\"  That, however, was exactly what they had to do. It took over an hour, and the task was not rendered any easier by the fact that the Lamb was by this time as hungry as a lion and as thirsty as a desert.  At last he consented to allow these strangers to carry him home by turns, but as he refused to hold on to such new acquaintances he was a dead weight, and most exhausting.  \"Thank goodness, we're home!\" said Jane, staggering through the iron gate to where Martha, the nursemaid, stood at the front door shading her eyes with her hand and looking out anxiously. \"Here! Do take Baby!\"  Martha snatched the Baby from her arms.  \"Thanks be, _he's_ safe back,\" she said. \"Where are the others, and whoever to goodness gracious are all of you?\"  \"We're _us_, of course,\" said Robert.  \"And who's Us, when you're at home?\" asked Martha scornfully.  \"I tell you it's _us_, only we're beautiful as the day,\" said Cyril. \"I'm Cyril, and these are the others, and we're jolly hungry. Let us in, and don't be a silly idiot.\"  Martha merely dratted Cyril's impudence and tried to shut the door in his face.  \"I know we _look_ different, but I'm Anthea, and we're so tired, and it's long past dinner-time.\"  \"Then go home to your dinners, whoever you are; and if our children put you up to this play-acting you can tell them from me they'll catch it, so they know what to expect!\" With that she did bang the door. Cyril rang the bell violently. No answer. Presently cook put her head out of a bedroom window and said--  \"If you don't take yourselves off, and that precious sharp, I'll go and fetch the police.\" And she slammed down the window.  \"It's no good,\" said Anthea. \"Oh, do, do come away before we get sent to prison!\"  The boys said it was nonsense, and the law of England couldn't put you in prison for just being as beautiful as the day, but all the same they followed the others out into the lane.  \"We shall be our proper selves after sunset, I suppose,\" said Jane.  \"I don't know,\" Cyril said sadly; \"it mayn't be like that now--things have changed a good deal since Megatherium times.\"  \"Oh,\" cried Anthea suddenly, \"perhaps we shall turn into stone at sunset, like the Megatheriums did, so that there mayn't be any of us left over for the next day.\"  She began to cry, so did Jane. Even the boys turned pale. No one had the heart to say anything.  It was a horrible afternoon. There was no house near where the children could beg a crust of bread or even a glass of water. They were afraid to go to the village, because they had seen Martha go down there with a basket, and there was a local constable. True, they were all as beautiful as the day, but that is a poor comfort when you are as hungry as a hunter and as thirsty as a sponge.  Three times they tried in vain to get the servants in the White House to let them in and listen to their tale. And then Robert went alone, hoping to be able to climb in at one of the back windows and so open the door to the others. But all the windows were out of reach, and Martha emptied a toilet-jug of cold water over him from a top window, and said--  \"Go along with you, you nasty little Eye-talian monkey.\"  It came at last to their sitting down in a row under the hedge, with their feet in a dry ditch, waiting for sunset, and wondering whether, when the sun _did_ set, they would turn into stone, or only into their own old natural selves; and each of them still felt lonely and among strangers, and tried not to look at the others, for, though their voices were their own, their faces were so radiantly beautiful as to be quite irritating to look at.  \"I don't believe we _shall_ turn to stone,\" said Robert, breaking a long miserable silence, \"because the Sand-fairy said he'd give us another wish to-morrow, and he couldn't if we were stone, could he?\"  The others said \"No,\" but they weren't at all comforted.  Another silence, longer and more miserable, was broken by Cyril's suddenly saying, \"I don't want to frighten you girls, but I believe it's beginning with me already. My foot's quite dead. I'm turning to stone, I know I am, and so will you in a minute.\"  \"Never mind,\" said Robert kindly, \"perhaps you'll be the only stone one, and the rest of us will be all right, and we'll cherish your statue and hang garlands on it.\"  But when it turned out that Cyril's foot had only gone to sleep through his sitting too long with it under him, and when it came to life in an agony of pins and needles, the others were quite cross.  \"Giving us such a fright for nothing!\" said Anthea.  [Illustration: Martha emptied a toilet-jug of cold water over him]  The third and miserablest silence of all was broken by Jane. She said--  \"If we _do_ come out of this all right, we'll ask the Sammyadd to make it so that the servants don't notice anything different, no matter what wishes we have.\"  The others only grunted. They were too wretched even to make good resolutions.  At last hunger and fright and crossness and tiredness--four very nasty things--all joined together to bring one nice thing, and that was sleep. The children lay asleep in a row, with their beautiful eyes shut and their beautiful mouths open. Anthea woke first. The sun had set, and the twilight was coming on.  Anthea pinched herself very hard, to make sure, and when she found she could still feel pinching she decided that she was not stone, and then she pinched the others. They, also, were soft.  \"Wake up,\" she said, almost in tears for joy; \"it's all right, we're not stone. And oh, Cyril, how nice and ugly you do look, with your old freckles and your brown hair and your little eyes. And so do you all!\" she added, so that they might not feel jealous.  When they got home they were very much scolded by Martha, who told them about the strange children.  \"A good-looking lot, I must say, but that impudent.\"  \"I know,\" said Robert, who knew by experience how hopeless it would be to try to explain things to Martha.  \"And where on earth have you been all this time, you naughty little things, you?\"  \"In the lane.\"  \"Why didn't you come home hours ago?\"  \"We couldn't because of _them_,\" said Anthea.  \"Who?\"  \"The children who were as beautiful as the day. They kept us there till after sunset. We couldn't come back till they'd gone. You don't know how we hated them! Oh, do, do give us some supper--we are so hungry.\"  \"Hungry! I should think so,\" said Martha angrily; \"out all day like this. Well, I hope it'll be a lesson to you not to go picking up with strange children--down here after measles, as likely as not! Now mind, if you see them again, don't you speak to them--not one word nor so much as a look--but come straight away and tell me. I'll spoil their beauty for them!\"  \"If ever we _do_ see them again we'll tell you,\" Anthea said; and Robert, fixing his eyes fondly on the cold beef that was being brought in on a tray by cook, added in heartfelt undertones--  \"And we'll take jolly good care we never _do_ see them again.\"  And they never have.     CHAPTER II  GOLDEN GUINEAS   Anthea woke in the morning from a very real sort of dream, in which she was walking in the Zoological Gardens on a pouring wet day without an umbrella. The animals seemed desperately unhappy because of the rain, and were all growling gloomily. When she awoke, both the growling and the rain went on just the same. The growling was the heavy regular breathing of her sister Jane, who had a slight cold and was still asleep. The rain fell in slow drops on to Anthea's face from the wet corner of a bath-towel out of which her brother Robert was gently squeezing the water, to wake her up, as he now explained.  \"Oh, drop it!\" she said rather crossly; so he did, for he was not a brutal brother, though very ingenious in apple-pie beds, booby-traps, original methods of awakening sleeping relatives, and the other little accomplishments which make home happy.  [Illustration: The rain fell in slow drops on to Anthea's face]  \"I had such a funny dream,\" Anthea began.  \"So did I,\" said Jane, wakening suddenly and without warning. \"I dreamed we found a Sand-fairy in the gravel-pits, and it said it was a Sammyadd, and we might have a new wish every day, and\"----  \"But that's what _I_ dreamed,\" said Robert; \"I was just going to tell you,--and we had the"]]]
