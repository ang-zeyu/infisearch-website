(860-825)--The kingdom of Urartu and its conquering princes: Menuas and Argistis._   Assyria was the first to reappear on the scene of action. Less hampered by an ancient past than Egypt and Chaldæa, she was the sooner able to recover her strength after any disastrous crisis, and to assume again the offensive along the whole of her frontier line.       Image Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a bas-relief at Koyunjik      of the time of Sennacherib. The initial cut, which is also      by Faucher-Gudin, represents the broken obelisk of Assur-      nazir-pal, the bas-reliefs of which are as yet unpublished.  During the years immediately following the ephemeral victories and reverses of Assurirba, both the country and its rulers are plunged in the obscurity of oblivion. Two figures at length, though at what date is uncertain, emerge from the darkness--a certain Irbarammân and an Assur-nadinakhê II., whom we find engaged in building palaces and making a necropolis. They were followed towards 950 by a Tiglath-pileser II., of whom nothing is known but his name.* He in his turn was succeeded about the year 935 by one Assurdân II., who appears to have concentrated his energies upon public works, for we hear of him digging a canal to supply his capital with water, restoring the temples and fortifying towns. Kammân-nirâri III., who followed him in 912, stands out more distinctly from the mists which envelop the history of this period; he repaired the gate of the Tigris and the adjoining wall at Assur, he enlarged its principal sanctuary, reduced several rebellious provinces to obedience, and waged a successful warfare against the neighbouring inhabitants of Karduniash. Since the extinction of the race of Nebuchadrezzar I., Babylon had been a prey to civil discord and foreign invasion. The Aramaean tribes mingled with, or contiguous to the remnants of the Cossoans bordering on the Persian gulf, constituted possibly, even at this period, the powerful nation of the Kaldâ.**       * Our only knowledge of Tiglath-pileser II. is from a brick,      on which he is mentioned as being the grandfather of Rammân-      nirâri II.       ** The names Chaldæa and Chaldæans being ordinarily used to      designate the territory and people of Babylon, I shall      employ the term Kaldu or Kaldâ in treating of the Aramæan      tribes who constituted the actual Chaldæan nation.  It has been supposed, not without probability, that a certain Simashshikhu, Prince of the Country of the Sea, who immediately followed the last scion of the line of Pashê,* was one of their chiefs. He endeavoured to establish order in the city, and rebuilt the temple of the Sun destroyed by the nomads at Sippar, but at the end of eighteen years he was assassinated. His son Eâmukinshurnu remained at the head of affairs some three to six months; Kashshu-nadinakhê ruled three or six years, at the expiration of which a man of the house of Bâzi, Eulbar-shakinshumi by name, seized upon the crown.** His dynasty consisted of three members, himself included, and it was overthrown after a duration of twenty years by an Elamite, who held authority for another seven.***       * The name of this prince has been read Simbarshiku by      Peiser, a reading adopted by Rost; Simbarshiku would have      been shortened into Sibir, and we should have to identify it      with that of the Sibir mentioned by Assur-nazir-pal in his      Annals, col. ii. 1. 84, as a king of Karduniash who lived      before his (Assur-nazir-pals) time (see p. 38 of the      present volume).       ** The name of this king may be read Edubarshakîn-shumi. The      house of Bâzi takes its name from an ancestor who must have      founded it at some unknown date, but who never reigned in      Chaldæa. Winckler has with reason conjectured that the name      subsequently lost its meaning to the Babylonians, and that      they confused the Chaldæan house of Bâzi with the Arab      country of Bâzu: this may explain why in his dynasties      Berosos attributes an Arab origin to that one which      comprises the short-lived line of Bît-Bâzi.       *** Our knowledge of these events is derived solely from the      texts of the Babylonian Canon published and translated by G.      Smith, by Pinches, and by Sayce. The inscription of      Nabubaliddin informs us that Kashu-nadînakhê and Eulbar-      shâkinshumu continued the works begun by Simashshiku in the      temple of the Sun at Sippar.  It was a period of calamity and distress, during which the Arabs or the Aramæans ravaged the country, and pillaged without compunction not only the property of the inhabitants, but also that of the gods. The Elamite usurper having died about the year 1030, a Babylonian of noble extraction expelled the intruders, and succeeded in bringing the larger part of the kingdom under his rule.*   * The names of the first kings of this dynasty are destroyed in the copies of the Royal Canon which have come down to us. The three preceding dynasties are restored as follows:--  [Illustration: 006.jpg TABLE OF KINGS]  Five or six of his descendants had passed away, and a certain Shamash-mudammiq was feebly holding the reins of government, when the expeditions of Rammân-nirâri III. provoked war afresh between Assyria and Babylon. The two armies encountered each other once again on their former battlefield between the Lower Zab and the Turnat. Shamash-mudammiq, after being totally routed near the Yalmân mountains, did not long survive, and Naboshumishkun, who succeeded him, showed neither more ability nor energy than his predecessor. The Assyrians wrested from him the fortresses of Bambala and Bagdad, dislodged him from the positions where he had entrenched himself, and at length took him prisoner while in flight, and condemned him to perpetual captivity.*       * Shamash-mudammiq appears to have died about 900.      Naboshumishkun probably reigned only one or two years, from      900 to 899 or to 898. The name of his successor is destroyed      in the _Synchronous History_; it might be Nabubaliddin, who      seems to have had a long life, but it is wiser, until fresh      light is thrown on the subject, to admit that it is some      prince other than Nabubaliddin, whose name is as yet unknown      to us.  His successor abandoned to the Assyrians most of the districts situated on the left bank of the Lower Zab between the Zagros mountains and the Tigris, and peace,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17327"],["title","History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 7 (of 12) (#1)"],["body","was speedily secured by a double marriage, remained unbroken for nearly half a century. Tukulti-ninip II. was fond of fighting; he overthrew his adversaries and exposed their heads upon stakes, but, unlike his predecessor, he directed his efforts against Naîri and the northern and western tribes. We possess no details of his campaigns; we can only surmise that in six years, from 890 to 885,* he brought into subjection the valley of the Upper Tigris and the mountain provinces which separate it from the Assyrian plain. Having reached the source of the river, he carved, beside the image of Tiglath-pileser I., the following inscription, which may still be read upon the rock. With the help of Assur, Shamash, and Rammân, the gods of his religion, he reached this spot. The lofty mountains he subjugated from the sun-rising to its down-setting; victorious, irresistible, he came hither, and like unto the lightning he crossed the raging rivers. **       * The parts preserved of the Eponym canon begin their record      in 893, about the end of the reign of Rammân-nirâri IL The      line which distinguishes the two reigns from one another is      drawn between the name of the personage who corresponds to      the year 890, and that of Tukulti-ninip who corresponds to      the year 889: Tukulti-ninip II., therefore, begins his reign      in 890, and his death is six years later, in 885.       ** This inscription and its accompanying bas-relief are      mentioned in the _Annals of Assur-nazir-pal_.  He did not live long to enjoy his triumphs, but his death made no impression on the impulse given to the fortunes of his country. The kingdom which he left to Assur-nazir-pal, the eldest of his sons, embraced scarcely any of the countries which had paid tribute to former sovereigns. Besides Assyria proper, it comprised merely those districts of Naîri which had been annexed within his own generation; the remainder had gradually regained their liberty: first the outlying dependencies--Cilicia, Melitene, Northern Syria, and then the provinces nearer the capital, the valleys of the Masios and the Zagros, the steppes of the Khabur, and even some districts such as Lubdi and Shupria, which had been allotted to Assyrian colonists at various times after successful campaigns. Nearly the whole empire had to be reconquered under much the same conditions as in the first instance. Assyria itself, it is true, had recovered the vitality and elasticity of its earlier days. The people were a robust and energetic race, devoted to their rulers, and ready to follow them blindly and trustingly wherever they might lead. The army, while composed chiefly of the same classes of troops as in the time of Tiglath-pileser I.,--spearmen, archers, sappers, and slingers,--now possessed a new element, whose appearance on the field of battle was to revolutionize the whole method of warfare; this was the cavalry, properly so called, introduced as an adjunct to the chariotry. The number of horsemen forming this contingent was as yet small; like the infantry, they wore casques and cuirasses, but were clothed with a tight-fitting loin-cloth in place of the long kilt, the folds of which would have embarrassed their movements. One-half of the men carried sword and lance, the other half sword and bow, the latter of a smaller kind than that used by the infantry. Their horses were bridled, and bore trappings on the forehead, but had no saddles; their riders rode bareback without stirrups; they sat far back with the chest thrown forward, their knees drawn up to grip the shoulder of the animal.  [Illustration: 009.jpg AN ASSYRIAN HORSEMAN ARMED WITH THE SWORD]       Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a bas-relief in bronze on the      gate of Balawât. The Assyrian artist has shown the head and      legs of the second horse in profile behind the first, but he      has forgotten to represent the rest of its body, and also      the man riding it.  Each horseman was attended by a groom, who rode abreast of him, and held his reins during an action, so that he might be free to make use of his weapons. This body of cavalry, having little confidence in its own powers, kept in close contact with the main body of the army, and was not used in independent manouvres; it was associated with and formed an escort to the chariotry in expeditions where speed was essential, and where the ordinary foot soldier would have hampered the movements of the charioteers.*       * Isolated horsemen must no doubt have existed in the      Assyrian just as in the Egyptian army, but we never find any      mention of a _body_ of cavalry in inscriptions prior to the      time of Assur-nazir-pal; the introduction of this new corps      must consequently have taken place between the reigns of      Tiglath-pileser and Assur-nazir-pal, probably nearer the      time of the latter. Assur-nazir-pal himself seldom speaks of      his cavalry, but he constantly makes mention of the horsemen      of the Aramaean and Syrian principalities, whom he      incorporated into his own army.  [Illustration: 010.jpg A MOUNTED ASSYRIAN ARCHER WITH ATTENDANT]       Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from one of the bronze bas-reliefs      of the gate of Balawât.  The army thus reinforced was at all events more efficient, if not actually more powerful, than formerly; the discipline maintained was as severe, the military spirit as keen, the equipment as perfect, and the tactics as skilful as in former times. A knowledge of engineering had improved upon the former methods of taking towns by sapping and scaling, and though the number of military engines was as yet limited, the besiegers were well able, when occasion demanded, to improvise and make use of machines capable of demolishing even the strongest walls.*       * The battering-ram had already reached such a degree of      perfection under Assur-nazir-pal, that it must have been      invented some time before the execution of the first bas-      reliefs on which we see it portrayed. Its points of      resemblance to the Greek battering-ram furnished Hoofer with      one of his mam arguments for placing the monuments of      Khorsabad and Koyunjik as late as the Persian or Parthian      period.  The Assyrians were familiar with all the different kinds of battering-ram; the hand variety, which was merely a beam tipped with iron, worked by some score of men; the fixed ram, in which the beam was suspended from a scaffold and moved by means of ropes; and lastly, the movable ram, running on four or six wheels, which enabled it to be advanced or withdrawn at will. The military engineers of the day allowed full rein to their fancy in the many curious shapes they gave to this latter engine; for example, they gave to the mass of bronze at its point the form of the head of an animal, and the whole engine took at times the form of a sow ready to root up with its snout the foundations of the enemys defences. The scaffolding of the machine was usually protected by a carapace of green leather or some coarse woollen material stretched over it, which broke the force of blows from projectiles: at times it had an additional arrangement in the shape of a cupola or turret in which archers were stationed to sweep the face of the wall opposite to the point of attack.  [Illustration: 012.jpg THE MOVABLE SOW MAKING A BREACH IN THE WALL OF A FORTRESS]       Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from one of the bronze bas-reliefs      of the gate of Balawât.  The battering-rams were set up and placed in line at a short distance from the ramparts of the besieged town; the ground in front of them was then levelled and a regular causeway constructed, which was paved with bricks wherever the soil appeared to be lacking in firmness. These preliminaries accomplished, the engines were pushed forward by relays of troops till they reached the required range. The effort needed to set the ram in motion severely taxed the strength of those engaged in the work; for the size of the beam was enormous, and its iron point, or the square mass of metal at the end, was of no light weight. The besieged did their best to cripple or, if possible, destroy the engine as it approached them.  [Illustration: 013.jpg THE TURRETED BATTERING-RAM ATTACKING THE WALLS OF A TOWN]       Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a bas-relief brought from      Nimroud, now in the British Museum.  Torches, lighted tow, burning pitch, and stink-pots were hurled down upon its roofing: attempts were made to seize the head of the ram by means of chains or hooks, so as to prevent it from moving, or in order to drag it on to the battlements; in some cases the garrison succeeded in crushing the machinery with a mass of rock. The Assyrians, however, did not allow themselves to be discouraged by such trifling accidents; they would at once extinguish the fire, release, by sheer force of muscle, the beams which the enemy had secured, and if, notwithstanding all their efforts, one of the machines became injured, they had others ready to take its place, and the ram would be again at work after only a few minutes delay. Walls, even when of burnt brick or faced with small stones, stood no chance against such an attack.  [Illustration: 014.jpg THE BESIEGED ENDEAVOURING TO CRIPPLE OR DESTROY THE BATTERING-RAM]       Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a bas-relief from Nimroud, now      in the British Museum.  The first blow of the ram sufficed to shake them, and an opening was rapidly made, so that in a few days, often in a few hours, they became a heap of ruins; the foot soldiers could then enter by the breach which the pioneers had effected.  It must, however, be remembered that the strength and discipline which the Assyrian troops possessed in such a high degree, were common to the military forces of all the great states--Elam, Damascus, Naîri, the Hittites, and Chaldæa. It was owing to this, and also to the fact that the armies of all these Powers were, as a rule, both in strength and numbers,"]]]
