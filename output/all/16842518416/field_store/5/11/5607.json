He sighed and finished the cake. \"It's the new Minister. He won't give me my pension unless I tell him my secret identity.\"  \"So?\" his mother said. \"You're so ashamed of your parents, you'd rather starve than tell the world that their bigshot hero is Hershie Abromowicz? I, for one wouldn't mind -- finally, I could speak up when my girlfriends are going on about their sons the lawyers.\"  \"Mom!\" he said, feeling all of eight years old. \"I'm not ashamed and you know it. But if the world knew who I was, well, who knows what kind of danger you'd be in? I've made some powerful enemies, Mama.\"  \"Enemies, shmenemies,\" she said, waving her hands. \"Don't worry yourself on my account. Don't make me the reason that you end up in the cold. I'm not helpless you know. I have Mace.\"  Hershie thought of the battles he'd fought: the soldiers, the mercenaries, the terrorists, the crooks and the super-crooks with their insane plots and impractical apparati. His mother was as formidable as an elderly Jewish woman with no grandchildren could be, but she was no match for automatic weapons. \"I can't do it, Mama. It wouldn't be responsible. Can we drop it?\"  \"Fine, we won't talk about it anymore. But a mother _worries_. You're sure you don't need any money?\"  He cast about desperately for a way to placate her. \"I'm fine. I've got a speaking engagement lined up.\"  #  There was a message waiting on his comm when he powered it back up. A message from a relentlessly cheerful woman with a chirpy Texas accent, who identified herself as the programming coordinator for DefenseFest 33. She hoped he would return her call that night.  Hershie hovered in a dark cloud over the lake, the wind blowing his coat straight back, holding the comm in his hand. He squinted through the clouds and distance until he saw his apartment building, a row of windows lit up like teeth, his darkened window a gap in the smile. He didn't mind the cold, it was much colder in his fortress of solitude, but his apartment was more than warmth. It was his own shabby, homey corner of the hideously expensive city. On the flight from his mother's, he'd found an old-style fifty-dollar bill, folded neatly and stuck in the breast pocket of his overcoat.  He returned the phone call.  #  The super wasn't happy about being roused from his sitcoms, but he grudgingly allowed Hershie to squirt the rent money at his comm. He wanted to come up and take the padlock, but Hershie talked him into turning over the key, promising to return it in the morning.  His apartment was a little one-bedroom with a constant symphony of groaning radiators. Every stick of furniture in it had been rescued from kerbsides while Hershie flew his night patrols, saving chairs, sofas and even a scarred walnut armoire from the trashman.  Hershie sat at the round formica table and commed Thomas.  \"It's me,\" he said.  \"What's up?\"  He didn't want to beat around the bush. \"I'm speaking at DefenseFest. Then I'm going on tour, six months, speaking at military shows. It pays well. Very well.\" Very, very well -- well enough that he wouldn't have to worry about his pension. The US-based promoters had sorted his tax status out with the IRS, who would happily exempt him, totally freeing him from entanglements with Revenue Canada. The cheerful Texan had been _glad_ to do it.  He waited for Thomas's trademark stream of vitriol. It didn't come. Very quietly, Thomas said, \"I see.\"  \"Thomas,\" he said, a note of pleading in his voice. \"It's not my choice. If I don't do this, I'll have to give Woolley my secret identity -- he won't give me my pension without my Social Insurance Number.\"  \"Or you could get a job,\" Thomas said, the familiar invective snarl creeping back.  \"I just told you, I can't give out my SIN!\"  \"So have your secret identity get a job. Wash dishes!\"  \"If I took a job,\" Hershie said, palms sweating, \"I'd have to give up flying patrols -- I'd have to stop fighting crime.\"  \"_Fighting crime_?\" Thomas's voice was remorseless. \"What _crime_? The bugouts are taking care of crime -- they're making plans to shut down the _police_! Supe, you've been obsoleted.\"  \"I know,\" Hershie said, self-pitying. \"I know. That's why I got involved with you in the first place -- I need to have a _purpose_. I'm the Super Man!\"  \"So your purpose is speaking to military shows? Telling the world that it still needs its arsenals, even if the bugouts have made war obsolete? Great purpose, Supe. Very noble.\"  He choked on a hopeless sob. \"So what can I do, Thomas? I don't want to sell out, but I've got to _eat_.\"  \"Squeeze coal into diamonds?\" he said. It was teasing, but not nasty teasing. Hershie felt his tension slip: Thomas didn't hate him.  \"Do you have any idea how big a piece of coal you have to start with to get even a one-carat stone? Trust me -- someone would notice if entire coalfaces started disappearing.\"  \"Look, Supe, this is surmountable. You don't have to sell out. You said it yourself, you're the Super Man -- you have responsibilities. You have duties. You can't just sell out. Let's sleep on it, huh?\"  Hershie was so very, very tired. It was always hardest on him when the Earth's yellow sun was hidden; the moon was a paltry substitute for its rejuvenating rays. \"Let's do that,\" he said. \"Thanks, Thomas.\"  #  DefenseFest 33 opened its doors on one of those incredibly bright March days when the snow on the ground throws back lumens sufficient to shrink your pupils to microdots. Despite the day's brightness, a bitterly cold wind scoured Front Street and the Metro Convention Centre.  From a distance, Hershie watched demonstration muster out front of the Eaton Centre, a few kilometers north, and march down to Front Street, along their permit-proscribed route. The turnout was good, especially given the weather: about 5,000 showed up with wooly scarves and placards that the wind kept threatening to tear loose from their grasp.  The veterans marched out front, under a banner, in full uniform. Next came the Quakers, who were of the same vintage as the veterans, but dressed like elderly English professors. Next came three different Communist factions, who circulated back and forth, trying to sell each other magazines. Finally, there came the rabble: Thomas's group of harlequin-dressed anarchists; high-school students with packsacks who industriously commed their browbeaten classmates who'd elected to stay at their desks; \"civilians\" who'd seen a notice and come out, and tried gamely to keep up with the chanting.  The chanting got louder as they neared the security cordon around the Convention Centre. The different groups all mingled as they massed on the opposite side of the barricades. The Quakers and the vets sang \"Give Peace a Chance,\" while Thomas and his cohort prowled around, distributing materiel to various trusted individuals.  The students hollered abuse at the attendees who were trickling into the Convention Centre in expensive overcoats, florid with expense-account breakfasts and immaculately groomed.  Hershie's appearance silenced the crowd. He screamed in over the lake, banked vertically up the side of the CN Tower, and plummeted downward. The demonstrators set up a loud cheer as he skimmed the crowd, then fell silent and aghast as he touched down on the _opposite_ side of the barricade, with the convention-goers. A cop in riot-gear held the door for him and he stepped inside. A groan went up from the protestors, and swelled into a wordless, furious howl.  #  Hershie avoided the show's floor and headed for the green room. En route, he was stopped by a Somali general who'd been acquitted by a War Crimes tribunal, but only barely. The man greeted him like an old comrade and got his aide to snap a photo of the two of them shaking hands.  The green room was crowded with coffee-slurping presenters who pecked furiously at their comms, revising their slides. Hershie drew curious stares when he entered, but by the time he'd gotten his Danish and coffee, everyone around him was once again bent over their work, a field of balding cabbages anointed with high-tech hair-care products.  Hershie's palms were slick, his alien hearts throbbing in counterpoint. His cowlick wilted in the aggressive heat shimmering out of the vent behind his sofa. He tried to keep himself calm, but by the time a gofer commed him and squirted directions to the main ballroom, he was a wreck.  #  Hershie commed into the feed from the demonstration in time to see the Quakers sit, en masse, along the barricade, hands intertwined, asses soaking in the slush at the kerbside. The cops watched them impassively, and while they were distracted, Thomas gave a signal to his crew, who hastily unreeled a stories-high smartscreen, the gossamer fabric snapping taut in the wind as it unfurled over the Convention Centre's facade.  The cops were suddenly alert, moving, but Thomas was careful to keep the screen on his side of the barricade. Tina led a team of high-school students who spread out a solar collector the size and consistency of a parachute. It glinted in the harsh sun.  Szandor hastily cabled a projector/loudhailer apparatus to the collector. Szandor's dog nipped at his heels as he steadied and focused the apparatus on the screen, and Szandor plugged his comm into it and powered it up.  There was a staticky pop as the speakers came to life, loud enough to be heard over the street noise. The powerful projector beamed its image onto the screen, bright even in the midday glare.  There were hoots from the crowd as they recognised the feed: a live broadcast of the keynote addresses in the Centre. The Patron Ik'Spir Pat's hoverchair prominent. The camera lingered on the Patron's eyes, the only part of him visible from within the chair's masking infrastructure. They were startling, silvery orbs, heavy-lidded and expressionless.

Hershie hastily closed his comm and cleared his throat, adjusted his mic, and addressed the crowd.  #  \"Uh. . .\" he said. His guts somersaulted. Time to go big or go home.  \"Hi.\" That was better. \"Thanks. I'm the Super Man. For years, I worked alongside UN Peacekeeping forces around the world. I hoped I was doing good work. Most of the time, I suppose I may have been.\"  He caught the eye of Brenda, the cheerful Texan who'd booked him in. She looked uneasy.  \"There's one thing I'm certain of, though: it's that the preparation for war has never led to anything _but_ war. With this show, you ladies and gentlemen are participating in a giant conspiracy to commit murder. Individually, you may not be evil, but collectively, you're the most amoral supervillain I've ever faced.\"  Brenda was talking frantically into her comm. His mic died. He simply expanded his mighty diaphragm and kept on speaking, his voice filling the ballroom.  \"I urge you to put this behind you. We've entered into a new era in human history. The good Patron here offers the entire Universe; you scurry around, arranging the deaths of people you've never met.  \"It's a terribly, stupid, mindless pursuit. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.\"  With that, Hershie stepped away from the podium and walked out of the ballroom.  #  The camera tracked him as he made his way back through the Convention Centre, out the doors. He leapt the barricade and settled in front of the screen. The demonstrators gave him a standing ovation, and Thomas gravely shook his hand. The handshake was repeated on the giant screen behind them, courtesy of the cameraman, who had gamely vaulted the barricade as well.  The crowd danced, hugged each other, laughed. Szandor's dog bit him on the ass, and he nearly dropped the projector.  He recovered in time to nearly drop it again, as the Patron Ik'Spir Pat's hoverchair glided out the Centre's doors and made a beeline for Hershie.  Hershie watched the car approach with nauseous dread. The Patron stopped a few centimetres from him, so they were almost eyeball-to-eyeball. The hoverchair's PA popped to life, and the Patron spoke, in the bugouts' thrilling contralto.  \"Thank you for your contribution,\" the bugout said. \"It was refreshing to have another perspective presented.\"  Hershie tried for a heroic nod. \"I'm glad you weren't offended.\"  \"On the contrary, it was stimulating. I shall have to speak with the conference's organisers; this format seems a good one for future engagements.\"  Hershie felt his expression slipping, sliding towards slack-jawed incredulity. He struggled to hold it, then lost it entirely when one of the Patron's silvery eyes drooped closed in an unmistakable wink.  #  \"Hi, Mama.\"  \"Hershie, I just saw it on the television.\"  He cringed back from his comm as he shrank deeper into the corner of the Belquees that he'd moved to when his comm rang.  \"Mama, it's all right. They've signed me for the full six months. I'll be fine --\"  \"Of course you'll be fine, bubbie. But would it kill you to brush your hair before you go on television in front of the whole world? Do you want everyone to think your mother raised a slob?\"  Hershie smiled. \"I will, Mama.\"  \"I know you will, bubbie. You're a very good-looking man, you know. But no one wants to marry a man with messy hair.\"  \"I know, Mama.\"  \"Well, I won't keep you. Do you think you could come for dinner on Friday? I know you're busy, but your old mother won't be here forever.\"  He sighed his father's sigh. \"I'll be there, Mama.\"  --  <!--  <rdf:RDF xmlns=\"http://web.resource.org/cc/\" xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:rdf=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\"> <Work rdf:about=\"http://craphound.com/place/Cory_Doctorow_-_Shadow_of_the_Mothaship. txt\"> <dc:title>The Super Man and the Bugout</dc:title> <dc:date>2001-9-1</dc:date> <dc:description>A science&#45;fiction short story by Cory Doctorow about a familiar superhero who is returned to his roots as a nebbish from Toronto, from the short story collection \"A Place So Foreign and Eight More,\" published by Four Walls Eight Windows press in September, 2003 (ISBN: 1568582862)</dc:description> <dc:creator><Agent> <dc:title>Cory Doctorow</dc:title> </Agent></dc:creator> <dc:rights><Agent> <dc:title>Cory Doctorow</dc:title> </Agent></dc:rights> <dc:type rdf:resource=\"http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text\" /> <license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd-nc/1.0/\" /> </Work>  <License rdf:about=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd-nc/1.0/\"> <permits rdf:resource=\"http://web.resource.org/cc/Reproduction\" /> <permits rdf:resource=\"http://web.resource.org/cc/Distribution\" /> <requires rdf:resource=\"http://web.resource.org/cc/Notice\" /> <requires rdf:resource=\"http://web.resource.org/cc/Attribution\" /> <prohibits rdf:resource=\"http://web.resource.org/cc/CommercialUse\" /> </License>  </rdf:RDF>  -->"]]]
