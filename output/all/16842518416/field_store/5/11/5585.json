On suspecting the water as the cause, I had all I used boiled, and this was effectual, but I was greatly reduced in flesh, and so were many of our party.  We proceeded nearly due north, through wilderness and many villages and running rills; the paths are often left to be choked up by the overbearing vegetation, and then the course of the rill is adopted as the only clear passage; it has also this advantage, it prevents footmarks being followed by enemies: in fact the object is always to make approaches to human dwellings as difficult as possible, even the hedges around villages sprout out and grow a living fence, and this is covered by a great mass of a species of calabash with its broad leaves, so that nothing appears of the fence outside.  _11th January, 1870._--The people are civil, but uproarious from the excitement of having never seen strangers before; all visitors from a distance came with their large wooden shields; many of the men are handsome and tall but the women are plainer than at Bambarré.  _12th January, 1870._--Cross the Lolindé, 35 yards and knee deep, flowing to join Luamo far down: dark water. (_13th._) Through the hills Chimunémuné; we see many albinos and partial lepers and syphilis is prevalent. It is too trying to travel during the rains.  _14th January, 1870._--The Muabé palm had taken possession of a broad valley, and the leaf-stalks, as thick as a strong man's arm and 20 feet long, had fallen off and blocked up all passage except by one path made and mixed up by the feet of buffaloes and elephants. In places like this the leg goes into elephants' holes up to the thigh and it is grievous; three hours of this slough tired the strongest: a brown stream ran through the centre, waist deep, and washed off a little of the adhesive mud. Our path now lay through a river covered with tikatika, a living vegetable bridge made by a species of glossy leafed grass which felts itself into a mat capable of bearing a man's weight, but it bends in a foot or fifteen inches every step; a stick six feet long could not reach the bottom in certain holes we passed. The lotus, or sacred lily, which grows in nearly all the shallow waters of this country, sometimes spreads its broad leaves over the bridge so as to lead careless observers to think that it is the bridge builder, but the grass mentioned is the real agent. Here it is called Kintéfwétéfwé; on Victoria Nyanza Titatika.  _15th January, 1870._--Choleraic purging again came on till all the water used was boiled, but I was laid up by sheer weakness near the hill Chanza.  _20th and 21st January. 1870._--Weakness and illness goes on because we get wet so often; the whole party suffers, and they say that they will never come here again. The Manyango Rivulet has fine sweet water, but the whole country is smothered with luxuriant vegetation.  _27th, 29th, and 30th January, 1870._--Rest from sickness in camp. The country is indescribable from rank jungle of grass, but the rounded hills are still pretty; an elephant alone can pass through it--these are his head-quarters. The stalks are from half an inch to an inch and a half in diameter, reeds clog the feet, and the leaves rub sorely on the face and eyes: the view is generally shut in by this megatherium grass, except when we come to a slope down to a valley or the bed of a rill.  We came to a village among fine gardens of maize, bananas, ground-nuts, and cassava, but the villagers said, \"Go on to next village;\" and this meant, \"We don't want you here.\" The main body of Mohamad's people was about three miles before us, but I was so weak I sat down in the next hamlet and asked for a hut to rest in. A woman with leprous hands gave me hers, a nice clean one, and very heavy rain came on: of her own accord she prepared dumplings of green maize, pounded and boiled; which are sweet, for she said that she saw I was hungry. It was excessive weakness from purging, and seeing that I did not eat for fear of the leprosy, she kindly pressed me: \"Eat, you are weak only from hunger; this will strengthen you.\" I put it out of her sight, and blessed her motherly heart.  I had ere this come to the conclusion that I ought not to risk myself further in the rains in my present weakness, for it may result in something worse, as in Marungu and Liemba.  The horde mentioned as having passed Bambarré was now somewhere in our vicinity, and it was impossible to ascertain from the Manyuema where the Lualaba lay.  In going north on 1st February we came to some of this horde belonging to Katomba or Moene-mokaia, who stated that the leader was anxious for advice as to crossing Lualaba and future movements. He supposed that this river was seven days in front of him, and twelve days in front of us. It is a puzzle from its north-westing and low level: it is possibly Petherick's Bahr Ghazal. Could get no latitude.  _2nd February, 1870._--I propose to cross it, and buy an exploring canoe, because I am recovering my strength; but we now climb over the bold hills Bininango, and turn south-west towards Katomba to take counsel: he knows more than anyone else about the country, and his people being now scattered everywhere seeking ivory, I do not relish their company.  _3rd February, 1870._--Caught in a drenching rain, which made me fain to sit, exhausted as I was, under an umbrella for an hour trying to keep the trunk dry. As I sat in the rain a little tree-frog, about half an inch long, leaped on to a grassy leaf, and began a tune as loud as that of many birds, and very sweet; it was surprising to hear so much music out of so small a musician. I drank some rain-water as I felt faint--in the paths it is now calf deep. I crossed a hundred yards of slush waist deep in mid channel, and full of holes made by elephants' feet, the path hedged in by reedy grass, often intertwined and very tripping. I stripped off my clothes on reaching my hut in a village, and a fire during night nearly dried them. At the same time I rubbed my legs with palm oil, and in the morning had a delicious breakfast of sour goat's milk and porridge.  _5th February, 1870._--The drenching told on me sorely, and it was repeated after we had crossed the good-sized rivulets Mulunkula and many villages, and I lay on an enormous boulder under a Muabé palm, and slept during the worst of the pelting. I was seven days southing to Mamohela, Katomba's camp, and quite knocked up and exhausted. I went into winter quarters on 7th February, 1870.  _7th February, 1870._--This was the camp of the headman of the ivory horde now away for ivory. Katomba, as Moene-mokaia is called, was now all kindness. We were away from his Ujijian associates, and he seemed to follow his natural bent without fear of the other slave-traders, who all hate to see me as a spy on their proceedings. Rest, shelter, and boiling all the water I used, and above all the new species of potato called Nyumbo, much famed among the natives as restorative, soon put me all to rights. Katomba supplied me liberally with nyumbo; and, but for a slightly medicinal taste, which is got rid of by boiling in two waters, this vegetable would be equal to English potatoes.  _11th February, 1870._--First of all it was proposed to go off to the Lualaba in the north-west, in order to procure _Holcus sorghum_ or dura flour, that being, in Arab opinion, nearly equal to wheat, or as they say \"heating,\" while the maize flour we were obliged to use was cold or cooling.  _13th February, 1870._--I was too ill to go through mud waist deep, so I allowed Mohamad (who was suffering much) to go away alone in search of ivory. As stated above, shelter and nyumbo proved beneficial.  _22nd February, 1870._--Falls between Vira and Baker's Water seen by Wanyamwezi. This confirms my conjecture on finding Lualaba at a lower level than Tanganyika. Bin Habib went to fight the Batusi, but they were too strong, and he turned.  _1st March, 1870._--Visited my Arab friends in their camp for the first time to-day. This is Kasessa's country, and the camp is situated between two strong rivulets, while Mamohela is the native name, Mount Bombola stands two miles from it north, and Mount Bolunkela is north-east the same distance. Wood, water, and grass, the requisites of a camp abound, and the Manyuema bring large supplies of food every day; forty large baskets of maize for a goat; fowls and bananas and nyumbo very cheap.  _25th March, 1870._--Iron bracelets are the common medium of exchange, and coarse beads and cowries: for a copper bracelet three large fowls are given, and three and a half baskets of maize; one basket three feet high is a woman's load, and they are very strong.  The Wachiogoné are a scattered tribe among the Maarabo or Suaheli, but they retain their distinct identity as a people.  The Mamba fish has breasts with milk, and utters a cry; its flesh is very white, it is not the crocodile which goes by the same name, but is probably the Dugong or Peixe Mulher of the Portuguese(?). Full-grown leeches come on the surface in this wet country.  Some of Katomba's men returned with forty-three tusks. An animal with short horns and of a reddish colour is in the north; it is not known to the Arabs(?).  Joseph, an Arab from Oman, says that the Simoom is worse in Sham (Yemen?) than in Oman: it blows for three or four hours. Butter eaten largely is the remedy against its ill effects, and this is also smeared on the body: in Oman a wetted cloth is put over the head, body, and legs, while this wind blows.  _1st May, 1870._--An elephant was killed which had three tusks; all of good size.[7]  Rains continued; and mud and mire from the clayey soil of Manyuema were too awful to be attempted.  _24th May, 1870._--I sent to Bambarré for the cloth and beads I left"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17026"],["title","Craphound (#0)"],["body","(C) 1998 by Cory Doctorow     Craphound  Cory Doctorow  From \"A Place So Foreign and Eight More,\" a short story collection published in September, 2003 by Four Walls Eight Windows Press (ISBN 1568582862).

Lafferty or Terry Bisson than to Bradbury).\"   - Gardner Dozois    Editor, Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine  --  Blurbs and quotes:  * Cory Doctorow straps on his miner's helmet and takes you deep into the   caverns and underground rivers of Pop Culture, here filtered through SF-coloured   glasses. Enjoy.   - Neil Gaiman    Author of American Gods and Sandman   * Few writers boggle my sense of reality as much as Cory Doctorow.  His vision   is so far out there, you'll need your GPS to find your way back.   - David Marusek    Winner of the Theodore Sturgeon Award, Nebula Award nominee  * Cory Doctorow is one of our best new writers: smart, daring, savvy,   entertaining, ambitious, plugged-in, and as good a guide to the wired world of   the twenty-first century that stretches out before us as you're going to find.   - Gardner Dozois    Editor, Asimov's SF  * He sparkles!  He fizzes!  He does backflips and breaks the furniture! Science   fiction needs Cory Doctorow!   - Bruce Sterling    Author of The Hacker Crackdown and Distraction  * Cory Doctorow strafes the senses with a geekspeedfreak explosion of gomi kings   with heart, weirdass shapeshifters from Pleasure Island and jumping automotive   jazz joints.  If this is Canadian science fiction, give me more.   - Nalo Hopkinson    Author of Midnight Robber and Brown Girl in the Ring  * Cory Doctorow is the future of science fiction.  An nth-generation hybrid of   the best of Greg Bear, Rudy Rucker, Bruce Sterling and Groucho Marx, Doctorow   composes stories that are as BPM-stuffed as techno music, as idea-rich as the   latest issue of NEW SCIENTIST, and as funny as humanity's efforts to improve   itself.  Utopian, insightful, somehow simultaneously ironic and heartfelt, these   nine tales will upgrade your basal metabolism, overwrite your cortex with new   and efficient subroutines and generally improve your life to the point where   you'll wonder how you ever got along with them.  Really, you should need a   prescription to ingest this book.  Out of all the glittering crap life and our   society hands us, craphound supreme Doctorow has managed to fashion some   industrial-grade art.\"   - Paul Di Filippo    Author of The Steampunk Trilogy  * As scary as the future, and twice as funny. In this eclectic and electric   collection Doctorow strikes sparks off today to illuminate tomorrow, which is   what SF is supposed to do. And nobody does it better.   - Terry Bisson    Author of Bears Discover Fire  --  A note about this story  This story is from my collection, \"A Place So Foreign and Eight More,\" published by Four Walls Eight Windows Press in September, 2003, ISBN 1568582862. I've released this story, along with five others, under the terms of a Creative Commons license that gives you, the reader, a bunch of rights that copyright normally reserves for me, the creator.  I recently did the same thing with the entire text of my novel, \"Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom\" (http://craphound.com/down), and it was an unmitigated success. Hundreds of thousands of people downloaded the book -- good news -- and thousands of people bought the book -- also good news. It turns out that, as near as anyone can tell, distributing free electronic versions of books is a great way to sell more of the paper editions, while simultaneously getting the book into the hands of readers who would otherwise not be exposed to my work.  I still don't know how it is artists will earn a living in the age of the Internet, but I remain convinced that the way to find out is to do basic science: that is, to do stuff and observe the outcome. That's what I'm doing here. The thing to remember is that the very *worst* thing you can do to me as an artist is to not read my work -- to let it languish in obscurity and disappear from posterity. Most of the fiction I grew up on is out-of-print, and this is doubly true for the short stories. Losing a couple bucks to people who would have bought the book save for the availability of the free electronic text is no big deal, at least when compared to the horror that is being irrelevant and unread. And luckily for me, it appears that giving away the text for free gets me more paying customers than it loses me.
