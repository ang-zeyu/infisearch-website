And then that little, black Thing nearly burst with laughing. \"If that is all, it's easy mended!\" it says. \"I'll come to your window every morning, take the flax, and bring it back spun into five skeins at night. Come! shall it be a bargain?\"  Now she, for all she was so gatless and thoughtless, said, cautious like:  \"But what is your pay?\"  Then That twirled its tail so fast you couldn't see it, and stuck out its beautiful toes, and smirked and looked out of the corners of its eyes. \"I will give you three guesses every night to guess my name, and if you haven't guessed it before the month is up, why\"--and That twirled its tail faster and stuck out its toes further, and smirked and sniggered more than ever--\"you shall be mine, my beauty.\"  Three guesses every night for a whole month! She felt sure she would be able for so much; and there was no other way out of the business, so she just said, \"Yes! I agree!\"  And lor! how That twirled its tail, and bowed, and smirked, and stuck out its beautiful toes.  Well, the very next day her husband led her to the strange room again, and there was the day's food, and a spinning-wheel and a great bundle of flax.  \"There you are, my dear,\" says he as polite as polite. \"And remember! if there are not five whole skeins to-night, I fear your head will come off!\"  At that she began to tremble, and after he had gone away and locked the door, she was just thinking of a good cry, when she heard a queer knocking at the window. She upped at once and opened it, and sure enough there was the small, little, black Thing sitting on the window-ledge, dangling its beautiful toes and twirling its tail so that you could scarcely see it.  \"Good-morning, my beauty,\" says That. \"Come! hand over the flax, sharp, there's a good girl.\"  So she gave That the flax and shut the window and, you may be sure, ate her victuals, for, as you know, she had a good appetite, and the King, her husband, had promised to give her everything she liked to eat. So she ate to her heart's content, and when evening came and she heard that queer knocking at the window again, she upped and opened it, and there was the small, little, black Thing with five spun skeins on his arm!  And it twirled its tail faster than ever, and stuck out its beautiful toes, and bowed and smirked and gave her the five skeins.  Then That said, \"And now, my beauty, what is That's name?\"  And she answered quite easy like:  \"That is Bill.\"  \"No, it ain't,\" says That, and twirled its tail.  \"Then That is Ned,\" says she.  \"No, it ain't,\" says That, and twirled its tail faster.  \"Well,\" says she a bit more thoughtful, \"That is Mark.\"  \"No, it ain't,\" says That, and laughs and laughs and laughs, and twirls its tail so as you couldn't see it, as away it flew.  Well, when the King, her husband, came in, he was fine and pleased to see the five skeins all ready for him, for he was fond of his pretty wife.  \"I shall not have to order your head off, my dear,\" says he. \"And I hope all the other days will pass as happily.\" Then he said good-night and locked the door and left her.  But next morning they brought her fresh flax and even more delicious foods. And the small, little, black Thing came knocking at the window and stuck out its beautiful toes and twirled its tail faster and faster, and took away the bundle of flax and brought it back all spun into five skeins by evening.  Then That made her guess three times what That's name was; but she could not guess right, and That laughed and laughed and laughed as it flew away.  Now every morning and evening the same thing happened, and every evening she had her three guesses; but she never guessed right. And every day the small, little, black Thing laughed louder and louder and smirked more and more, and looked at her quite maliceful out of the corners of its eyes until she began to get frightened, and instead of eating all the fine foods left for her, spent the day in trying to think of names to say. But she never hit upon the right one.  So it came to the last day of the month but one, and when the small, little, black Thing arrived in the evening with the five skeins of flax all ready spun, it could hardly say for smirking:  \"Ain't you got That's name yet?\"  So says she--for she had been reading her Bible:  \"Is That Nicodemus?\"  \"No, it ain't,\" says That, and twirled its tail faster than you could see.  \"Is That Samuel?\" says she all of a flutter.  \"No, it ain't, my beauty,\" chuckles That, looking maliceful.  \"Well--is That Methuselah?\" says she, inclined to cry.  Then That just fixes her with eyes like a coal a-fire, and says, \"No, it ain't that neither, so there is only to-morrow night and then you'll be mine, my beauty.\"  And away the small, little, black Thing flew, its tail twirling and whisking so fast that you couldn't see it.  Well, she felt so bad she couldn't even cry; but she heard the King, her husband, coming to the door, so she made bold to be cheerful, and tried to smile when he said, \"Well done, wife! Five skeins again! I shall not have to order your head off after all, my dear, of that I'm quite sure, so let us enjoy ourselves.\" Then he bade the servants bring supper, and a stool for him to sit beside his Queen, and down they sat, lover-like, side by side.  But the poor Queen could eat nothing; she could not forget the small, little, black Thing. And the King hadn't eaten but a mouthful or two when he began to laugh, and he laughed so long and so loud that at last the poor Queen, all lackadaisical as she was, said:  \"Why do you laugh so?\"  \"At something I saw to-day, my love,\" says the King. \"I was out a-hunting, and by chance I came to a place I'd never been in before. It was in a wood, and there was an old chalk-pit there, and out of the chalk-pit there came a queer kind of a sort of a humming, humming noise. So I got off my hobby to see what made it, and went quite quiet to the edge of the pit and looked down. And what do you think I saw? The funniest, queerest, smallest, little, black Thing you ever set eyes upon. And it had a little spinning-wheel and it was spinning away for dear life, but the wheel didn't go so fast as its tail, and that span round and round--_ho-ho-ha-ha!_--you never saw the like. And its little feet had buckled shoes and bows on them, and they went up and down in a desperate hurry. And all the time that small, little, black Thing kept bumming and booming away at these words:    \"Name me, name me not,    Who'll guess it's Tom-Tit-Tot.\"  Well, when she heard these words the Queen nearly jumped out of her skin for joy; but she managed to say nothing, but ate her supper quite comfortably.  And she said no word when next morning the small, little, black Thing came for the flax, though it looked so gleeful and maliceful that she could hardly help laughing, knowing she had got the better of it. And when night came and she heard that knocking against the window-panes, she put on a wry face, and opened the window slowly as if she was afraid. But that Thing was as bold as brass and came right inside, grinning from ear to ear. And oh, my goodness! how That's tail was twirling and whisking!  \"Well, my beauty,\" says That, giving her the five skeins all ready spun, \"what's my name?\"  Then she put down her lip, and says, tearful like, \"Is--is--That--Solomon?\"  \"No, it ain't,\" laughs That, smirking out of the corner of That's eye. And the small, little, black Thing came further into the room.  So she tried again--and this time she seemed hardly able to speak for fright.  \"Well--is That--Zebedee?\" she says.  \"No, it ain't,\" cried the impet, full of glee. And it came quite close and stretched out its little black hands to her, and O-oh, ITS TAIL...!!!  \"Take time, my beauty,\" says That, sort of jeering like, and its small, little, black eyes seemed to eat her up. \"Take time! Remember! next guess and you're mine!\" Well, she backed just a wee bit from it, for it was just horrible to look at; but then she laughed out and pointed her finger at it and said, says she:            \"Name me, name me not,           _Your_ name is                _Tom_                 TIT                _TOT_.\"  And you never heard such a shriek as that small, little, black Thing gave out. Its tail dropped down straight, its feet all crumpled up, and away That flew into the dark, and she never saw it no more.  And she lived happy ever after with her husband, the King.  [Illustration: Away That flew into the dark, and she never saw it no more]     THE GOLDEN SNUFF-BOX   Once upon a time, and a very good time too, though it was not in my time, nor your time, nor for the matter of that in any one's time, there lived a man and a woman who had one son called Jack, and he was just terribly fond of reading books. He read, and he read, and then, because his parents lived in a lonely house in a lonely forest and he never saw any other folk but his father and his mother, he became quite crazy to go out into the world and see charming princesses and the like.  So one day he told his mother he must be off, and she called him an air-brained addle-pate, but added that, as he was no use at home, he had better go seek his fortune. Then she asked him if he would rather take a small cake with her blessing to eat on his journey, or a large cake with her curse? Now Jack was a very hungry lad, so he just up and said:  \"A big cake, if you please, 'm.\"  So his mother made a great big cake, and when he started she just off to the top of the house and cast malisons on him, till he got out of sight. You see she had to do it, but after that she sate down and cried.  Well, Jack hadn't gone far till he came to a field where his father was ploughing. Now the goodman was dreadfully "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17034"],["title","English Fairy Tales (#5)"],["body","out when he found his son was going away, and still more so when he heard he had chosen his mother's malison. So he cast about what to do to put things straight, and at last he drew out of his pocket a little golden snuff-box, and gave it to the lad, saying:  \"If ever you are in danger of sudden death you may open the box; but not till then. It has been in our family for years and years; but, as we have lived, father and son, quietly in the forest, none of us have ever been in need of help--perhaps you may.\"  So Jack pocketed the golden snuff-box and went on his way.  Now, after a time, he grew very tired, and very hungry, for he had eaten his big cake first thing, and night closed in on him so that he could scarce see his way.  But at last he came to a large house and begged board and lodging at the back door. Now Jack was a good-looking young fellow, so the maid-servant at once called him in to the fireside and gave him plenty good meat and bread and beer. And it so happened that while he was eating his supper the master's gay young daughter came into the kitchen and saw him. So she went to her father and said that there was the prettiest young fellow she had ever seen in the back kitchen, and that if her father loved her he would give the young man some employment. Now the gentleman of the house was exceedingly fond of his gay young daughter, and did not want to vex her; so he went into the back kitchen and questioned Jack as to what he could do.  \"Anything,\" said Jack gaily, meaning, of course, that he could do any foolish bit of work about a house.  But the gentleman saw a way of pleasing his gay young daughter and getting rid of the trouble of employing Jack; so he laughs and says, \"If you can do anything, my good lad,\" says he, \"you had better do this. By eight o'clock to-morrow morning you must have dug a lake four miles round in front of my mansion, and on it there must be floating a whole fleet of vessels. And they must range up in front of my mansion and fire a salute of guns. And the very last shot must break the leg of the four-post bed on which my daughter sleeps, for she is always late of a morning!\"  Well! Jack was terribly flabbergasted, but he faltered out:  \"And if I don't do it?\"  \"Then,\" said the master of the house quite calmly, \"your life will be the forfeit.\"  So he bade the servants take Jack to a turret-room and lock the door on him.  Well! Jack sate on the side of his bed and tried to think things out, but he felt as if he didn't know _b_ from a battledore, so he decided to think no more, and after saying his prayers he lay down and went to sleep. And he did sleep! When he woke it was close on eight o'clock, and he had only time to fly to the window and look out, when the great clock on the tower began to whirr before it struck the hour. And there was the lawn in front of the house all set with beds of roses and stocks and marigolds! Well! all of a sudden he remembered the little golden snuff-box.  \"I'm near enough to death,\" quoth he to himself, as he drew it out and opened it.  And no sooner had he opened it than out hopped three funny little red men in red night-caps, rubbing their eyes and yawning; for, see you, they had been locked up in the box for years, and years, and years.  \"What do you want, Master?\" they said between their yawns. But Jack heard that clock a-whirring and knew he hadn't a moment to lose, so he just gabbled off his orders. Then the clock began to strike, and the little men flew out of the window, and suddenly                Bang! bang! bang! bang! bang! bang!  went the guns, and the last one must have broken the leg of the four-post bed, for there at the window was the gay young daughter in her nightcap, gazing with astonishment at the lake four miles round, with the fleet of vessels floating on it!  And so did Jack! He had never seen such a sight in his life, and he was quite sorry when the three little red men disturbed him by flying in at the window and scrambling into the golden snuff-box.  \"Give us a little more time when you want us next, Master,\" they said sulkily. Then they shut down the lid, and Jack could hear them yawning inside as they settled down to sleep.  As you may imagine, the master of the house was fair astonished, while as for the gay young daughter, she declared at once that she would never marry any one else but the young man who could do such wonderful things; the truth being that she and Jack had fallen in love with each other at first sight.  But her father was cautious. \"It is true, my dear,\" says he, \"that the young fellow seems a bully boy; but for aught we know it may be chance, not skill, and he may have a broken feather in his wing. So we must try him again.\"  Then he said to Jack, \"My daughter must have a fine house to live in. Therefore by to-morrow morning at eight o'clock there must be a magnificent castle standing on twelve golden pillars in the middle of the lake, and there must be a church beside it. And all things must be ready for the bride, and at eight o'clock precisely a peal of bells from the church must ring out for the wedding. If not you will have to forfeit your life.\"  This time Jack intended to give the three little red men more time for their task; but what with having enjoyed himself so much all day, and having eaten so much good food, he overslept himself, so that the big clock on the tower was whirring before it struck eight when he woke, leapt out of bed, and rushed to the golden snuff-box. But he had forgotten where he had put it, and so the clock had _really_ begun to strike before he found it under his pillow, opened it, and gabbled out his orders. And then you never saw how the three little red men tumbled over each other and yawned and stretched and made haste all at one time, so that Jack thought his life would surely be forfeit. But just as the clock struck its last chime, out rang a peal of merry bells, and there was the Castle standing on twelve golden pillars and a church beside it in the middle of the lake. And the Castle was all decorated for the wedding, and there were crowds and crowds of servants and retainers, all dressed in their Sunday best.  Never had Jack seen such a sight before; neither had the gay young daughter who, of course, was looking out of the next window in her nightcap. And she looked so pretty and so gay that Jack felt quite cross when he had to step back to let the three little red men fly to their golden snuff-box. But they were far crosser than he was, and mumbled and grumbled at the hustle, so that Jack was quite glad when they shut the box down and began to snore.  Well, of course, Jack and the gay young daughter were married, and were as happy as the day is long; and Jack had fine clothes to wear, fine food to eat, fine servants to wait on him, and as many fine friends as he liked.  So he was in luck; but he had yet to learn that a mother's malison is sure to bring misfortune some time or another.  Thus it happened that one day when he was going a-hunting with all the ladies and gentlemen, Jack forgot to change the golden snuff-box (which he always carried about with him for fear of accidents) from his waistcoat pocket to that of his scarlet hunting-coat; so he left it behind him. And what should happen but that the servant let it fall on the ground when he was folding up the clothes, and the snuff-box flew open and out popped the three little red men yawning and stretching.  Well! when they found out that they hadn't really been summoned, and that there was no fear of death, they were in a towering temper and said they had a great mind to fly away with the Castle, golden pillars and all.  On hearing this the servant pricked up his ears.  \"Could you do that?\" he asked.  \"Could we?\" they said, and they laughed loud. \"Why, we can do anything.\"  Then the servant said ever so sharp, \"Then move me this Castle and all it contains right away over the sea where the master can't disturb us.\"  Now the little red men need not really have obeyed the order, but they were so cross with Jack that hardly had the servant said the words before the task was done; so when the hunting-party came back, lo and behold! the Castle, and the church, and the golden pillars had all disappeared!  At first all the rest set upon Jack for being a knave and a cheat; and, in particular, his wife's father threatened to have at him for deceiving the gay young daughter; but at last he agreed to let Jack have twelve months and a day to find the Castle and bring it back.  So off Jack starts on a good horse with some money in his pocket.  And he travelled far and he travelled fast, and he travelled east and west, north and south, over hills, and dales, and valleys, and mountains, and woods, and sheepwalks, but never a sign of the missing castle did he see. Now at last he came to the palace of the King of all the Mice in the Wide World. And there was a little mousie in a fine hauberk and a steel cap doing sentry at the front gate, and he was not for letting Jack in until he had told his errand. And when Jack had told it, he passed him on to the next mouse sentry at the inner gate; so by degrees he reached the King's chamber, where he sate surrounded by mice courtiers.  Now the King of the Mice received Jack very graciously, and said that he himself knew nothing of the missing Castle, but, as he was King of all the Mice in the whole world, it was possible that some of his subjects might know more than he. So he ordered his chamberlain to command a Grand Assembly for the next morning, and in the meantime he entertained Jack right royally.  But the next morning, though there were brown mice, and black mice, and grey mice, and white mice, and piebald mice, from all parts of the world, they all answered with one breath:  \"If it please your Majesty, we have not seen the missing Castle.\"  Then the King said, \"You must go and ask my elder brother the King of all the Frogs. He may be able to tell you. Leave"]]]
