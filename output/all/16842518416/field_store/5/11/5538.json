Since we find one of the    Taurobolian inscriptions, with so recent a date as the time of the    Emperor Valentinian the third. The silence of the Heathen writers    on this head is very wonderful; for the only one who makes any    mention of them is Julius Firmicus Maternus, in his dissertation on    the errors of the Pagan religion; as Dalenius, in his elaborate    account of the Taurobolium, has remarked.     The ceremony of the consecration of the High Priest of Cybele,    which many learned men have mistaken for the consecration of the    Roman Pontifex Maximus; which dignity, from the very earliest    infancy of the Roman Empire, was always annexed to that of the    Emperor himself.     The Priests who had the direction of the Taurobola, wore the same    vestments without washing out the bloody stains, as long as they    would hold together.     By these rites and baptisms by blood, they thought themselves, as    it were re-born to a life eternal. Sextilius Agefilaus Ædesius    says, that he was born a-new, to life eternal, by means of the    Taurobolium and Criobolium.     Nor were the priests alone initiated in this manner, but also    others, who were not of that order; in particular cases the    regenerations were only promised for twenty years.     Besides the Taurobolia and Criobolia, which were erected at the    expence of whole cities and provinces, there were others also,    which were founded by the bounty of private people. We often meet    with the names of magistrates and priests of other Gods, who were    admitted into these mysteries, and who erected Taurobolia as    offerings for the safety of the Emperor, or their own. The rites of    the Taurobolia lasted sometimes many days.     The inscription, on the Taurobolium, which is on the same side with    the head of the bull, we have endeavoured to explain by filling up    the abbreviations which are met with in the Roman character.          TAUROBOLIO MATRIS DEUM MAGNÆ IDÆÆ            QUOD FACTUM EST EX IMPERIO                 MATRIS IDÆÆ DEUM          PRO SALUTE IMPERATORIS CÆSARIS                   TITI ÆLII     ADRIANI ANTONINI AUGUSTI PII PATRIS PATRIÆ                LIBERORUMQUE EJUS          ET STATUS COLONIÆ LUGDUNENSIS         LUCIUS ÆMILIUS CARPUS SEXTUMVIR          AUGUSTALIS ITEM DENDROPHORUS           VIRES EXCEPIT ET A VATICANO          TRANSTULIT ARAM ET BUCRANIUM            SUO IMPENDIO CONSECRAVIT                    SACERDOTE      QUINTO SAMMIO SECUNDO AB QUINDECEMVIRIS            OCCABO ET CORONA EXORNATO        CUI SANCTISSIMUS ORDO LUGDUNENSIS        PERPETUITATEM SACERDOTIS DECREVIT          APPIO ANNIA ATILO BRADUA TITO          CLODIO VIBIO VARO CONSULIBUS         LOCUS DATUS DICRETO DECURIONUM.     [D] _The Model is now in the possession of the ingenious_ Dr.    HARRINGTON _at Bath_.  The _Taurobolium_ was one of the great mysteries, you know, of the Roman religion, in the observance of which, I think, they dug a large hole in the earth, and covered it with planks, laid at certain distances, so as to give light into the subterranean temple. The person who was to receive the _Taurobolio_ then descended into the theatre, and received on his head and whole body, the smoaking hot blood of the bull, which was there sacrificed for that purpose. If a single bull was only sacrificed, I think they call it a simple _Taurabolio_, if a ram was added to it, as was sometimes done, it was then called a _Torobolia_, and _Criobolio_; sometimes too, I believe a goat was also slain.  After all the blood of the victim animals was discharged, the Priests and Cybils retired beneath the theatre, and he who had received the bloody sacrifice, came forth and exposed himself, besmeared with blood, to the people, who all prostrated themselves before him, with reverential awe, as one who was thereby particularly sanctified, and whose person ought to be regarded with the highest veneration, and looked upon with holy horror; nor did this sanctification, I think, end with the ceremony, but rendered the person of the sanctified holy for twenty years. An inscription cited by _Gruter_, seems to confirm this matter, who, after speaking of one _Nepius Egnatius Faventinus_, who lived in the year of Christ 176, says,  _\"Percepto Taurobolio Criobolioque feliciter,_\"  Concludes with these words,      _\"Vota Faventinus bis deni suscipit orbis,     Ut mactet repetens aurata fronte bicornes._\"  The _bis denus orbis_ seems to imply, the space of twice ten years.  And here I cannot help making a little comparison between the honours paid by the Roman citizens to their Emperors, and those of the present times to the Princes of the Blood Royal. You must know that the present King's brother, came to _Lyons_ in the year 1775, and thus it is recorded in letters of gold upon their quay:            LOUIS XVI. REGNANT.     EN MEMOIRE DE L'HEUREUX JOUR CINQ.         SEPTEMBRE M,DCC,LXXV.                  OU         MONSIEUR FRERE DU ROI               ET MADAME      SONT ARRIVES EN CETTE VILLE                CE QUAI        DE L'AGREMENT DU PRINCE      ET PAR ORDONNANCE DU CONSULAT         DU DOUZE DU MEME MOIS        A ETE NOMME A PERPETUITE             QUAI MONSIEUR.  If the _Bourgeoise_ of _Lyons_, however, are not men of genius, they are ingenious men, and they have a most delightful country to dwell in. I think I may say, that from the high hills which hang about this city, and taking in the rivers, fertile vales, rude rocks, vine-yards, and country seats, far and near, that _Lyons_ and its environs, afford a greater variety of natural and artificial beauties, than any spot in Europe. It is, however, by no means a place for the winter residence of a stranger. Most of the natives advanced in years, were carried off last winter. The surly winds which come down the Rhone, with impetuous blasts, are very disagreeable and dangerous. I found the cold intolerable in the beginning of May, out of the sunshine, and the sun intolerable in it. In England I never wore but one under waistcoat; in Spain, and in the south of France, I found two necessary. The Spaniards wear long cloaks, and we laugh at them; but the laugh would come more properly from them. There is in those climates a _vifness_ in the air that penetrates through and through; and I am sure that such who travel to the southward for the recovery of their health, ought to be ten times more upon their guard, to be well secured against the keen blasts the south of France, than even against an easterly wind in England.  The disorder which carried off so many last winter at _Lyons_, was called the Gripe. In a large hotel only one person escaped it, an English Lady. They called it the _Gripe_, from the fast hold it took of the person it seized; nor did it let them go till April.  On my way here, I found it sometimes extremely hot; it is now the first of May, and I am shaking by the side of a good fire, and have had one constantly every day for this fortnight.     LETTER XLIII.  LYONS.   The _Lyonoise_ think their town was particularly honoured by the _Taurobolium_; but it was a common practice to offer that sacrifice not only for the Emperor's health, but for the preservation of a city. There are two of these altars in the town of _Letoure_; one consecrated for the preservation of the Emperor _Gordian_, on which is the following inscription:         PRO SALVTE IMP. ANTONINI GORDIANO PII FEL.      AVG. TOTIVSQVE DOMVS DIVINÆ PROQVE STATV CIVIT.     LACTOR TOROPOLIVM FECIT ORDO LACTOR D.N. GORDIANO        II ET POMPLIANO COS VI ID DEC CVRANTIS M             EROTIO ET FESTO CANINIS SACERD.  And in a little village near _Marseilles_, called _Pennes_, there is a stone, on which is engraven,      MATRI DEVM MAGNÆ IDEÆ  And on another, in the same town,      MATRI DEVM TAVROPOLIVM.  I must not omit to give you a copy of a singular inscription on the tomb of a mint-master which was found in _Lyons_, and is preserved entire:      NOBILIS TIB. CÆSARIUS AVG. SER ÆQ. MONET HIC       AD QVI LOCIT JVLIA ADEPTA CONJUNX ET              PERPETUA FILIA D.S.D.  The most ancient money which has been found in and about this city, is the little coin of _Mark Antony_; on one side of which is represented the Triumvirate; on the other, a Lion, with the word _Lugudani_ under it; on each side of the Lion are the letters A and XL. The antiquarians here think those letters marked the value of the piece, and that it was about forty _sous_; but is it not more probable, that this was only the mint-master's touch?  Nothing can be a stronger proof of the importance of this city in the time of the Romans, than the immense expence they were at in erecting such a number of grand aquæducts, one of which was eighteen leagues in length; many parts of them are still visible; and it appears that they spent for the reparation of them at _one_ time, near one thousand talents; and here it was that the four grand Roman highways divided; one of which went directly to the sea, and another to the _Pyrenees_.  _Agrippa_, who was the constructor of most of these noble monuments of Roman grandeur, would not permit the _Lyonoise_ to erect any monument among them to his memory; and yet, his memory is, in a very particular manner, preserved to this day in the very heart of the city, for in the front of a house on the quay _de Villeroy_, is a medallion of baked earth, which, I think, perfectly resembles him; sure I am it is an unquestionable antique; it is a little disfigured indeed, and disgraced by his name being written upon it in modern characters. But there is another monument of _Agrippa_ here; it is part of the epitaph of an officer or soldier of the third cohort, whose duty it was to take an account of the expence of each day for the subsistence of the troops employed to work on the high-ways, and this officer was called _A. Rationibus Agrippæ_."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16994"],["title","A Year's Journey through France and Part of Spain, Volume 2 (1777) (#8)"],["body","  There are an infinite number of Roman inscriptions preserved at _Lyons_, among which is the following singular one:      DIIS INIQVIS QUI ANIMVLAM          TVAM RAPVERVNT.  I have already told you of a modern monument erected by the _Lyonoise_, and now, with grief and concern, I must tell you of an ancient one which they have demolished! it was a most beautiful structure, called the tomb of the Two Lovers; that, however, was a mistake; it was the tomb of a brother and sister named _Amandas_, or _Amans_, for near where it stood was lately found the following monumental inscription:                    D  M      ET MEMORIAE ÆTERNÆ OLIÆ TRIBVTÆ        FEMINÆ SANCTISSIME ARVESCIVS       AMANDVS FRATER SORORI KARISSMÆ        SIBIQVE AMANTISSIMÆ P.C. ET             SVB OSCIA DEDICAVIT.  I have seen a beautiful drawing of this fine monument, which stood near the high road, a little without the town; the barbarian _Bourgeoises_ threw it down about seventy years ago, to search for treasure.  But enough of antiquities; and therefore I will tell you truly my sentiments with respect to the south of France, which is, that _Lyons_ is quite southward enough for an Englishman, who will, if he goes farther, have many wants which cannot be supplied. After quitting _Lyons_, he will find neither good butter, milk, or cream. At _Lyons_, every thing, which man can wish for, is in perfection; it is indeed a rich, noble, and plentiful town, abounding with every thing that is good, and more _finery_ than even in _Paris_ itself. They have a good theatre, and some tolerable actors; among whom is the handsomest Frenchman I ever beheld, and, a little stiffness excepted, a good actor.  Any young gentleman traveller, particularly _of the English nation_, who is desirous of _replenishing his purse_, cannot, even in _Paris_, find more convenient occasions to throw himself in _fortune's way_, than at the city of _Lyons_.  An English Lady, and two or three gentlemen, have lately been so _fortunate there_, as to find lodgings _at a great Hotel_, gratis; and I desire you will particularly _recommend a long stay at_ Lyons _to my Oxonian friend_; where he may _see the world_ without looking out at a window.     LETTER XLIV.   I find I omitted to give you before I left _Nismes_, some account of Monsieur _Seguier_'s cabinet, a gentleman whose name I have before mentioned, and whose conversation and company were so very agreeable to me. Among an infinite number of natural and artificial curiosities, are many ancient Roman inscriptions, one of which is that of _T. Julius Festus_, which _Spon_ mentions in his _Melanges D'Antiquite_. There are also a great number of Roman utensils of bronze, glass, and earthen-ware. The Romans were well acquainted with the dangerous consequences of using copper vessels[E] in their kitchens, as may be seen in this collection, where there are a great many for that purpose; but all strongly gilt, not only within, but without, to prevent a possibility of _verdigris_ arising. There is also a bronze head of a Colossal statue, found not many years since near the fountain of _Nismes_, which merits particular attention, as well as a great number of Roman and Greek medals and medallions, well preserved, and some which are very rare. The natural curiosities are chiefly composed of fossils and petrifications; among the latter, are an infinite number of petrified fish _embalmed_ in solid stones; and where one sees the finest membranes of the fins, and every part of the fish, delineated by the pencil of nature, in the most exquisite manner; the greater part of these petrifications were collected by the hands of the possessor, some from _Mount Bola_, others from _Mount Liban_, _Switzerland_, _&c._     [E] See Dr. FALCONER, of _Bath_, his Treatise on this subject.  Mr. _Seguier_'s _Herbary_ consists of more than ten thousand plants; but above all, Mr. _Seguier_ himself, is the first, and most valuable part of his cabinet, having spent a long life in rational amusements; and though turned of four-score, he has all the chearfulness of youth, without any of the garrulity of old age. When he honoured me with a visit, at my country lodgings, he came on foot, and as the waters were out, I asked him how he _got at me_, so dry footed? He had walked upon the wall, he said; a wall not above nine inches thick, and of a considerable length!  And here let me observe that a Frenchman eats his _soup_ and _bouille_ at twelve o'clock, drinks only _with_, not _after_ his dinner, and then mixes water with his _genuine_ wine; he lives in a fine climate, where there is not as with us, for six weeks together, easterly winds, which stop the pores, and obstruct perspiration. A Frenchman eats a great deal, it is true, but it is not all _hard meat_, and they never sit and drink after dinner or supper is over.--An Englishman, on the contrary, drinks much stronger, and a variety of fermented liquors, and often much worse, and sits _at it_ many hours after dinner, and always after supper. How then can he expect such health, such spirits, and to enjoy a long life, free from pain, as most Frenchmen do; When the negro servants in the West-Indies find their masters call _after_ dinner for a bowl of punch extraordinary they whisper them, (if company are present) and ask, \"_whether they drink for drunk_, or _drink for dry_?\" A Frenchman never drinks for _drunk_.--While the Englishman is earning disease and misery at his bottle, the Frenchman is embroidering a gown, or knitting a handkerchief for his mistress. I have seen a Lady's sacque finely _tamboured_ by a Captain of horse, and a Lady's white bosom shewn through mashes netted by the man who made the snare, in which he was himself entangled; though he made it he did not perhaps know the powers of it till she _set it_.     LETTER XLV.   I write to you just as things come into my head, having taken very few notes, and those, as you must perceive, often without much regard to _unison_ or _time_. It has this minute occurred to me, that I omitted to tell you on my journey onwards, that I visited a little town in _Picardie_, called _Ham_, where there is so strong a castle, that it may be called a _petit Bastile_, and which was then and still is, full of state prisoners and debtors. To this castle there is a monstrous tower, the walls of which are thirty six feet thick, and the height and circumference are proportionable thereto; it was built by the _Conetable de St. Paul_, in order to shut up his master, _Charles_ the VIth, King of France, and contemporary, I think, with our _Henry_ the Vth; but such are the extraordinary turns of all human affairs, that _Mons. le Conetable_ was shut up in it himself many years, and ended his days there.--The fate of this constable brings to my mind a circumstance that happened under my _administration_, at _Land-Guard Fort_, when the King was pleased to trust me with the command of it. I had not been twenty-four hours in possession of what I thought a small sovereignty, before I received a letter in the following terms:  \"SIR, Having observed horses grazing on the covered way, that _hath_ done apparent damage, and may do more, I think it my duty to inform you, that his Majesty does not permit horses to feed thereon, &c. &c. (Signed)    \"ANTHONY GOODE,   Overseer of the Works.\"  I never was more surprized, than to find my wings were to be thus clipt, by a civil officer of the board of ordnance; however wrong I or my horses had acted, I could not let Mr. GOODE _graze_ so closely upon my authority, without a reprimand; I therefore wrote him an answer in terms as follow: \"that having seen a fat impudent-looking strutting fellow about the garrison, it was my order that when his duty led him to communicate any thing to me relative to the works thereof, that he came himself, instead of writing impertinent letters.\" Mr. _Goode_ sent a copy of his letter and mine to Sir _Charles Frederick_; and the post following, he received from the Office of Ordnance, several printed papers in the King's name, forbidding horses grazing on the WORKS, and _ordering Mr. Goode_ to nail those orders up in different parts of the garrison! but as I had not then learnt that either he, or his _red ribband master_, had any authority to give out, even the King's orders, in a garrison I commanded, but through my hands, I took the liberty, while Mr. _Goode_ and his assistant-son were nailing one up _opposite to my parlour window_, to send for a file of men and put them both into the Black-hold, an apartment Mr. _Goode_ had himself built, being a Master-Mason. By the time he had been ten minutes _grazing_ under this _covered way_, he sent me a message, that he was _asthmatic_, that the place was too close, and that if he died within a _year and a day_, I must be deemed accessary to his death. But as I thought Mr. _Goode_ should have considered, that some of the poor invalids too might now and then be as subject to the asthma as he, it was a proper punishment, and I kept him there till he knew the duty of a soldier, as well as that of a mason; and as I would _his betters_, had they come down and ventured to have given out orders in a garrison under my command; but instead of getting me punished as a _certain gentleman_ aimed at, that able General _Lord Ligonier_ approved my conduct, and removed the man to another garrison, and would have dismissed him the ordnance service, had I not become a petitioner in his favour; for he was too fat and old to work, too proud and arrogant to beg, and he and _his advisers_ too contemptible to be angry with.--But I must return to the castle of _Ham_, to tell you what a dreadful black-hold there is in that tower; it is a trap called by the French _des Obliettes_, of so horrible a contrivance, that when the prisoners are to suffer in it, the mechanical powers are so constructed, as to render it impossible to be again opened, nor would it signify, but to see the body _molue_, i.e. ground to"]]]
