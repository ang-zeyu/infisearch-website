Courtesy of the Management, as a reward for very _special_ customers like you.\" This was scripted, but the trick was to sell the line like it was fresh.  The boys took the cones from him timidly, but ate ravenously. George gave them some logoed serviettes to wipe up with and ground the fudge into his wrists and forearms with one of his own. He looked at his watch and consulted the laminated timetable taped to the counter. 1300h, which meant that the bulk of the Guests would be migrating towards Actionland and the dinosaur rides, and it was time to push the slightly down-at-the-heels FreakZone, to balance the crowds. \"You boys like rollercoasters?\" he said.  The youngest -- they were similar enough in appearance and distant enough in ages to be brothers -- spoke up. \"Yeah!\" The middle elbowed him, and the youngest flipped the middle the bird.  \"Well, if you follow the midway around this curve to the right, and go through the big clown-mouth, you'll be in the FreakZone. We've got a fifteen-storey coaster called _The Obliterator_ that loops fifty times in five minutes -- running over _ninety-five miles per hour_! If you hurry, you can beat the line!\" He looked the youngest in the eye at the start of the speech, then switched to the middle when he talked about the line.  The youngest started vibrating with excitement, and the middle looked pensive, and then to the eldest said, \"Sounds good, huh, Tom?\"  The eldest said, \"We haven't even found out where we're sleeping yet -- maybe we can do the ride afterwards.\"  George winked at the youngest, then said, \"Don't worry about it, kids. I'll get that sorted out for you right now.\" He picked up the white house phone and asked the operator to connect him with Guest Services. \"Hi there! This is George on the midway! I need reservations for three young men for tonight -- a suite, I think, with in-room Nintendo and a big-screen TV. They look like they'd enjoy the Sportaseum. OK, I'll hold,\" he covered the mouthpiece and said to the boys, \"You'll love the Sportaseum -- the chairs are shaped like giant catcher's mitts, and the beds are giant Air Jordans, and the suite comes with a regulation half-court. What name should I put the reservation under?\"  The eldest said, \"Tom Mitchell.\"  George made the reservation. \"You're all set,\" he said. \"The monorails run right into the hotel lobby, every ten minutes. Anyone with a name tag can show you to the nearest stop. Here's a tip -- try the football panzerotto: it's a fried pizza turnover as big as a football, with beef-jerky laces. It's _my_ favorite!\"  \"I want a football!\" the youngest said.  \"We'll have it for dinner,\" the eldest said, looking off at the skyline of coaster-skeletons in the distance. \"Let's go on some rides first.\"  George beamed his idiot's grin at them as they left, then his face went slack and he went back to wiping down the surfaces. A moment later, a hand reached across the counter and plucked the cloth from his grip. He looked up, startled, into Joe's grinning face. Unlike his brothers', Joe's face was all sharp angles and small teeth. Nobody knew what a child of a tongue was supposed to look like, but George had always suspected that Joe wasn't right, even for a third son.  \"Big guy!\" Joe shouted. \"Workin' hard?\"  George said, \"Yes.\" He stood, patiently, waiting for Joe to give him the cloth back.  Joe held it over his head like a standard, dancing back out of reach, even though George hadn't made a grab for it. George waited. Joe walked back to his counter and gave it back.  \"We're dozing the FreakZone,\" Joe said, in a conspiratorial whisper. He put a spin on _We're_, making sure that George knew he was including himself with the Island's management.  \"Really,\" George said, neutrally.  \"Yeah! We're gonna flatten that sucker, start fresh, and build us a new theme land. I'm a Strategic Project Consultant! By the time it's over, I'll be an Imagineer!\"  George knew that the lands on Pleasure Island were flattened and rebuilt on a regular basis, as management worked to stay ahead of the lightspeed boredom-threshold of the mainland. Still, he said, \"Well, Joe, that's marvelous. I'm sure you'll do a fabulous job.\"  Joe sneered at him. \"Oh, I know I will. We all do just _fabulous_ jobs, brother. Just some of us _have_ fabulous jobs to do.\"  George refused to rise to the bait. He could always outwait Joe.  Joe said, \"We're thinking of giving it a monster theme -- monsters are testing very high with eleven-to-fourteens this year. Dragons, ogres, cyborgs, you know. We may even do a walk-through -- there hasn't been one of those here since the sixties!\"  George didn't know what Joe wanted him to say. He said, \"That sounds very nice.\"  Joe gave him a pitying look, and then his chest started ringing. He extracted a slim phone from his shirt-pocket and turned away. A moment later, he turned back. \"Gotta go!\" he said. \"Meeting with Woodrow and Orville, down at Ops!\"  Alarm-bells went off in George's head. \"Shouldn't Bill go along if you're meeting with Orville?\"  Joe sneered at him, then took off at a fast clip down the midway. George watched him until he disappeared through one of the access doors.  #  Bill was clearly upset about it. George couldn't help but feel responsible. He should have called Bill as soon as Joe told him he was meeting with Orville, but he'd waited until he got home.  He'd been home for hours, and Joe still wasn't back. Bill picked absently at the dinner he'd made and fretted.  \"He didn't say how Orville found out?\" Bill asked.  George shook his head mutely.  \"Why didn't he invite me?\" Bill asked. \"I always handle negotiations for us.\"  George couldn't eat. The more Bill fretted, the more he couldn't eat. It was long dark outside, hours and hours after Joe should've been home. Bill fretted, George stared out the window, and Joe didn't come home.  Then, an electric cart's headlights swept up the trail to their cabin. The lights dazzled George, so he couldn't see who was driving. Bill joined him at the window and squinted. \"It's Joe and Orville!\" he said. George squinted too, but couldn't make anything out. He took Bill's word for it and joined him outside.  It was indeed Orville and Joe. Orville was driving, and Joe was lolling drunkenly beside him. Orville shook hands with Bill and nodded to George, who lifted Joe out of the cart and carried him inside.  When he got back, Orville and Bill were staring calmly into each other's eyes, each waiting for the other to say something. Orville was dressed in his working clothes: a natty white suit with a sport-shirt underneath. His bald head gleamed in the moonlight. His fleshy, unreadable face was ruddy in the glow from the cabin's door. George bit his tongue to keep from speaking.  \"He's drunk,\" Orville said, at last. Orville didn't beat around the bush.  \"I can see that,\" Bill said. \"Did you get him drunk?\"  \"Yes, I did. We were celebrating.\"  Bill's eyes narrowed. \"So you know.\"  Orville smiled. \"Of course I know. I set it up. I thought you'd approve: Joe clearly needed something to keep him out of trouble.\"  Bill said, \"This will keep him out of trouble?\"  Orville leaned against the cart's bumper, pulled out a pipe, stuffed it and lit it. He puffed at it, and watched the smoke wisp away in the swamp breezes. \"I think that Joe's going to really like life with the Imagineers. They're Management's precious darlings who can do no wrong. Anything they ask for, they get. There won't be any more discipline problems.\"  Bill said, \"Why not?\"  Orville grinned without showing his teeth. \"Where there's no discipline, there're no discipline problems. He can work whatever hours he wants. He'll have access to anything he needs: budget, staff, an office, whatever. It's his dream job.\"  Bill said, \"I don't like this.\"  George wondered why not. It sounded pretty good to him.  Orville puffed at his pipe. \"Like it or not, I think you'll have a hard time convincing Joe not to do it. He's sold.\"  Bill went back into the cabin and closed the door.  \"He took that well, don't you think?\" Orville asked.  George said, \"I suppose so.\"  Orville said, \"Is everything working out all right for you? Shifts OK? Co-workers?\"  George said, \"Everything's fine. Thank you.\"  Orville tapped his pipe out on the bumper, then got back into the cart. \"All right then. Good night, George.\"  #  George started cooking dinner for two. More and more, Joe spent the night in a suite at one of the hotels, \"working late.\" George didn't know what sort of work he was doing, but he sure seemed to enjoy it. He hardly came back to the cabin at all. The first time he'd stayed out all night, Bill had gone back to the Island and gotten Orville out of bed to help him search. After that, Joe started sending out a runner, usually some poor Ops trainee, to tell them he wasn't coming back for dinner. Eventually, he stopped bothering, and Bill stopped worrying.  One night, a month after Orville had come out to the cabin, George slathered a muskrat's carcass with mayonnaise and lemon and dragonfly eggs and set it out for him and Joe.  Bill hardly ate, which was usually a signal that he was thinking. George left him half of the dinner and waited for him to speak. Bill picked his way through the rest, then pushed his plate away. George cleared it and brought them both mason jars full of muddy water from the swamp out back. Bill took his jar out front of the cabin and leaned against the wall and stared out into the night, sipping. George joined him.  \"We're getting old,\" Bill said, at last.  \"Every night, the inside of my uniform is black,\" George said.  \"Mine, too. We're getting very old. I think that you're at least thirty, and I'm pretty sure that I'm twenty-five. That's old. Our father told me that he thought he was fifty, the year he died. And he was very old for one of us.\"  George thought of their father on his deathbed, eating the food they chewed "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17027"],["title","Return to Pleasure Island (#4)"],["body","him, eyes nearly blind, skin crazed with cracks. \"He was very old,\" George said.  Bill held his two whole hands up against the stars. \"When father was my age, he had two sons. Can you remember how proud he was of us? How proud he was of himself? He'd done well enough that he could lose both his thumbs, and still know that his sons would take care of him.\"  George shifted and sighed. He'd been thinking about sons, too.  \"I've wanted a son since we came to the Island,\" Bill said. \"I never did anything about it because I couldn't take care of Joe and a son.\" Bill turned to look at George. \"I think Joe's finally taking care of himself.\"  George didn't know what to say. If Bill had a son, then he couldn't. They couldn't both stop working to raise their sons. But Bill always made the decisions for them. George didn't know what to say, so he said nothing.  \"I'm going to have a son,\" Bill said.  #  Bill did it the next night. He told Orville that he'd need a month off, and after eating the dinner George made for them, he made a nest of earth and blankets on the floor of their cabin.  George sat in the corner and watched Bill as he stared at his thumbs. It was the most important decision one of their kind ever made: a clever son of the left hand, or a strong son of the right. George knew that his son would come from the left hand. In the world his father had put them into, cleverness was far more important than strength. After all, Bill was having the first son.  Bill put his clever left thumb in his mouth and slowly, slowly, bit down. George felt muddy tears pricking at his eyes. Bill's hand coursed with silty blood. He ignored it, and used his strong right hand to take the severed thumb from his mouth and bed it down with infinite care in the nest he'd built.  George cautiously moved forward to peer at the thumb, which was already moving blindly in its nest, twisting like a grub. Bill looked on, his eyes shining.  \"It's perfect,\" George breathed.  George felt an uncharacteristic welling up inside him, and he put his arm around Bill's shoulders. Bill leaned into him, and said, \"Thank you, George. This family wouldn't exist without you.\"  They both slept curled around the nest that night.  By morning, the thumb had sprouted tiny arm- and leg-buds, and it inched itself blindly around the nest. George marveled at it before going to work.  Joe stopped by his stand that day. His belly was bigger than ever, and his skin was cracking like their father's had. \"Big guy!\" he shouted, vaulting the counter into George's stand. \"Where's Bill today? He wasn't at his post.\"  George said, \"Bill had a son last night. From his left hand.\"  Joe rolled his eyes, which had gone the murky yellow of swamp water. \"Wonderful, right? Ugh. There are better ways to achieve immortality, bro. I'm designing a crawl-through for HorrorZone: you're an earthworm crawling underneath a graveyard. It's gonna be huge: maggots as big as horses, chasing the Guests through the tunnels; huge ghost hands grabbing at them. We're building a giant tombstone as the weenie, you'll be able to see it from anywhere on the Island. We'll build out over the midway for HorrorZone -- it's the biggest rehab we've done since they brought in electric power.\"  As usual, George didn't know what to say to Joe. \"That sounds very nice,\" he said.  Joe rolled his eyes again and started to say something, but stopped when three Guests came up to George's booth. George hardly recognised the Mitchell brothers. The youngest was already three-quarters donkey, so dangerously close that it was a miracle he hadn't been picked up already. He was hunched over, and his hands were fused into fists. His hair had grown down over his shoulders in a coarse mane, and his lips bulged around his elongated jaws.  The middle and eldest were well on their ways, too. The points of their ears poked out from under their hair, and they carried themselves painfully, forcing their legs and hips upright.  George flipped over his phone and punched 911, but left it out of sight below the counter. Loudly, he said, \"Come on over, boys! You look like you could use one of George's triple-dips, the best on the midway!\"  From the phone, he heard the security operator say, \"Thank you, George, we'll be along in a moment.\" Surreptitiously, he racked the receiver and smiled at the boys.  \"How are you enjoying your stay, boys?\" he said.  \"It'th aw-thome!\" the youngest said around his clumsy teeth.  George handed him a cone piled high with floss, then started building two more for his brothers. Joe smirked at them. George hoped he wouldn't say anything before security got there.  The eldest said, \"I don't think my brother's feeling too good. Is there a doctor here I can take him to?\"  The youngest, face sticky with confection, kicked his brother. \"I'm fine!\" he said. \"I wanna go on more rideth!\"  His brother said, \"We'll go on more rides after we see a doctor.\"  The youngest dropped to his knees and cried. \"No!\" he said, hammering his fists on the ground. \"No no no no!\" George watched in alarm as the boy went all the way over to donkey. His cries turned to brays, and his shorts split around his haunches and tail. His shirt went next, and George smoothly vaulted the counter and stood in front of the donkey, blocking him from passers-by. The other two made a run for it. George snagged the middle by his collar, but the boy tore free and took off down the midway. George looked about wildly for security, but they still hadn't arrived.  Then Joe tore past him, moving faster than George had ever seen him go. He caught the boys and stuffed one under each arm, kicking and squirming. He grinned ferociously as he pinned them beneath his knees at George's feet. He clamped his hands over their mouths. \"Got 'em!\" he said to George.  A security team emerged from the utilidor beside George's booth, wearing clown makeup and baggy pants. Two of them tranquilised the boys and the third fitted the donkey out with a halter and bit. The clown slapped the donkey's haunch appreciatively. \"He's a healthy one.\"  The security team disappeared down the utilidor with the Mitchell brothers: two boys and a donkey. Joe smacked George on the back. \"Did you see me catch them? Like greased lightning! Bounty, here I come!\"  George didn't mind sharing his bounty with Joe, so he just smiled and nodded and went back around to his booth.  #  Bill named his son Tom. Names weren't very important to their people, but the soft ones' world demanded them. Within a week, Tom was eagerly toddling through their cabin, tasting everything, exploring everything. His eyes shone with curious brilliance. The clever son of a clever son.  George loved Bill's son. He loved to watch Tom as he gnawed at their bedding, as he dug at the floor in search of grubs. Tom was clearly delighted with his surroundings, and George basked in Tom's delight. Bill could barely restrain himself from picking Tom up and hugging him every moment. The only time he left George alone with Tom was a few precious moments after each evening's meal, when he would duck into the woods to find some new toy for Tom: a crippled chipmunk; a handful of pretty rocks; a discarded beer can. The son built bizarre towers out of them, then knocked them down in a fit of giggles. Tom ate all day long, and spoke a steady stream of adorable nonsense.  Bill hardly spoke to George. Their evening meals were given over to watching the son eat. George didn't mind. Talking to the Guests all day wore him out.  When Tom was two months old, Joe came by George's booth.  \"Well, it's final. Tomorrow, we shut down the midway. Too old-fashioned -- it's only stood this long because some of the older Imagineers had an emotional attachment to it. I told 'em: 'That's _your_ demographic, not the _target_ demographic.' So we're knocking it down. HorrorZone's gonna be _huge_.\" He skipped off before George could say anything. His ears were long and pointed. It wasn't the first time George noticed it, but now, he could see that Joe's hunched-over gait wasn't just because of his belly.  George built a dozen cones for the Guests, but his heart wasn't in it. Besides, most of the Guests already had their hands full of gummi spiders and snakes, from the Actionland Jungle Treats buffet. His thoughts were full of Joe, and he turned them over in his slow, cautious manner. Joe was turning into a donkey. He didn't think that one of their kind could turn into a donkey, but this was Pleasure Island. Indulging your vices was a dangerous pastime here. He should tell Bill, but there was no phone at the cabin. He couldn't send a runner for him, because this was family business. His shift wouldn't end for hours yet, and this was too important to wait.  Finally, he called his Lead. \"I have to get offstage. I'm having a bad day.\"  Technically, this was allowed. Management didn't want anyone onstage who wasn't 100 percent. But it was something that none of the brothers, not even Joe, had ever done. The Lead was surprised, but he sent over a soft one to relieve George.  #  Orville and Bill were sitting out front of the cabin, watching Tom, when George got back. He wrung his hands as he approached them, not sure of what to say, and whether he should talk in front of Orville at all. He held his left thumb in his right hand, and it comforted him, a little.  Bill and Orville were so engrossed in Tom's antics that they didn't even notice George until he cleared his throat. Orville raised his eyebrows and looked significantly at Bill.  \"I just saw Joe,\" George said. \"On the midway. His ears are pointed, and he's walking all hunched over. I give him a few days at the most before he's all the way gone.\" George held his breath, waiting for Bill's reaction.  \"Too bad,\" Bill said. \"It was inevitable, I suppose. A child of the tongue! What was father thinking?\"  Orville smiled and puffed at his pipe. \"Don't you worry about it, George. Joe's going to be much, much happier."]]]
