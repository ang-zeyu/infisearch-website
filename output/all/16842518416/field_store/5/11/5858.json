When I received, in 1886, the American papers with accounts of the great strike of 12,000 Pennsylvanian coal-miners in the Connellsville district, I seemed but to read my own description of the North of England colliers' strike of 1844.  The same cheating of the workpeople by false measure; the same truck-system; the same attempt to break the miners' resistance by the capitalists' last, but crushing, resource,--the eviction of the men out of their dwellings, the cottages owned by the companies.  I have not attempted, in this translation, to bring the book up to date, or to point out in detail all the changes that have taken place since 1844.  And for two reasons: Firstly, to do this properly, the size of the book must be about doubled; and, secondly, the first volume of \"Das Kapital,\" by Karl Marx, an English translation of which is before the public, contains a very ample description of the state of the British working-class, as it was about 1865, that is to say, at the time when British industrial prosperity reached its culminating point.  I should, then, have been obliged again to go over the ground already covered by Marx's celebrated work.  It will be hardly necessary to point out that the general theoretical standpoint of this book--philosophical, economical, political--does not exactly coincide with my standpoint of to-day.  Modern international Socialism, since fully developed as a science, chiefly and almost exclusively through the efforts of Marx, did not as yet exist in 1844.  My book represents one of the phases of its embryonic development; and as the human embryo, in its early stages, still reproduces the gill-arches of our fish-ancestors, so this book exhibits everywhere the traces of the descent of modern Socialism from one of its ancestors,--German philosophy.  Thus great stress is laid on the dictum that Communism is not a mere party doctrine of the working-class, but a theory compassing the emancipation of society at large, including the capitalist class, from its present narrow conditions.  This is true enough in the abstract, but absolutely useless, and sometimes worse, in practice.  So long as the wealthy classes not only do not feel the want of any emancipation, but strenuously oppose the self-emancipation of the working-class, so long the social revolution will have to be prepared and fought out by the working-class alone.  The French bourgeois of 1789, too, declared the emancipation of the bourgeoisie to be the emancipation of the whole human race; but the nobility and clergy would not see it; the proposition--though for the time being, with respect to feudalism, an abstract historical truth--soon became a mere sentimentalism, and disappeared from view altogether in the fire of the revolutionary struggle.  And to-day, the very people who, from the \"impartiality\" of their superior standpoint, preach to the workers a Socialism soaring high above their class interests and class struggles, and tending to reconcile in a higher humanity the interests of both the contending classes--these people are either neophytes, who have still to learn a great deal, or they are the worst enemies of the workers,--wolves in sheeps' clothing.  The recurring period of the great industrial crisis is stated in the text as five years.  This was the period apparently indicated by the course of events from 1825 to 1842.  But the industrial history from 1842 to 1868 has shown that the real period is one of ten years; that the intermediate revulsions were secondary, and tended more and more to disappear.  Since 1868 the state of things has changed again, of which more anon.  I have taken care not to strike out of the text the many prophecies, amongst others that of an imminent social revolution in England, which my youthful ardour induced me to venture upon.  The wonder is, not that a good many of them proved wrong, but that so many of them have proved right, and that the critical state of English trade, to be brought on by Continental and especially American competition, which I then foresaw--though in too short a period--has now actually come to pass.  In this respect I can, and am bound to, bring the book up to date, by placing here an article which I published in the _London Commonweal_ of March 1, 1885, under the heading: \"England in 1845 and in 1885.\"  It gives at the same time a short outline of the history of the English working-class during these forty years, and is as follows:     \"Forty years ago England stood face to face with a crisis, solvable to    all appearances by force only.  The immense and rapid development of    manufactures had outstripped the extension of foreign markets and the    increase of demand.  Every ten years the march of industry was    violently interrupted by a general commercial crash, followed, after a    long period of chronic depression, by a few short years of prosperity,    and always ending in feverish over-production and consequent renewed    collapse.  The capitalist class clamoured for Free Trade in corn, and    threatened to enforce it by sending the starving population of the    towns back to the country districts whence they came, to invade them,    as John Bright said, not as paupers begging for bread, but as an army    quartered upon the enemy.  The working masses of the towns demanded    their share of political power--the People's Charter; they were    supported by the majority of the small trading class, and the only    difference between the two was whether the Charter should be carried    by physical or by moral force.  Then came the commercial crash of 1847    and the Irish famine, and with both the prospect of revolution     \"The French Revolution of 1848 saved the English middle-class.  The    Socialistic pronunciamentos of the victorious French workmen    frightened the small middle-class of England and disorganised the    narrower, but more matter-of-fact movement of the English    working-class.  At the very moment when Chartism was bound to assert    itself in its full strength, it collapsed internally, before even it    collapsed externally on the 10th of April, 1848.  The action of the    working-class was thrust into the background.  The capitalist class    triumphed along the whole line.     \"The Reform Bill of 1831 had been the victory of the whole capitalist    class over the landed aristocracy.  The repeal of the Corn Laws was    the victory of the manufacturing capitalist not only over the landed    aristocracy, but over those sections of capitalists, too, whose    interests were more or less bound up with the landed    interest,--bankers, stock-jobbers, fund-holders, etc.  Free Trade    meant the re-adjustment of the whole home and foreign, commercial and    financial policy of England in accordance with the interests of the    manufacturing capitalists--the class which now represented the nation.    And they set about this task with a will.  Every obstacle to    industrial production was mercilessly removed.  The tariff and the    whole system of taxation were revolutionised.  Everything was made    subordinate to one end, but that end of the utmost importance to the    manufacturing capitalist: the cheapening of all raw produce, and    especially of the means of living of the working-class; the reduction    of the cost of raw material, and the keeping down--if not as yet the    _bringing down_--of wages.  England was to become the 'workshop of the    world;' all other countries were to become for England what Ireland    already was,--markets for her manufactured goods, supplying her in    return with raw materials and food.  England the great manufacturing    centre of an agricultural world, with an ever-increasing number of    corn and cotton-growing Irelands revolving around her, the industrial    sun.  What a glorious prospect!     \"The manufacturing capitalists set about the realisation of this their    great object with that strong common sense and that contempt for    traditional principles which has ever distinguished them from their    more narrow-minded compeers on the Continent.  Chartism was dying out.    The revival of commercial prosperity, natural after the revulsion of    1847 had spent itself, was put down altogether to the credit of Free    Trade.  Both these circumstances had turned the English working-class,    politically, into the tail of the 'great Liberal party,' the party led    by the manufacturers.  This advantage, once gained, had to be    perpetuated.  And the manufacturing capitalists, from the Chartist    opposition, not to Free Trade, but to the transformation of Free Trade    into the one vital national question, had learnt, and were learning    more and more, that the middle-class can never obtain full social and    political power over the nation except by the help of the    working-class.  Thus a gradual change came over the relations between    both classes.  The Factory Acts, once the bugbear of all    manufacturers, were not only willingly submitted to, but their    expansion into acts regulating almost all trades, was tolerated.    Trades' Unions, hitherto considered inventions of the devil himself,    were now petted and patronised as perfectly legitimate institutions,    and as useful means of spreading sound economical doctrines amongst    the workers.  Even strikes, than which nothing had been more nefarious    up to 1848, were now gradually found out to be occasionally very    useful, especially when provoked by the masters themselves, at their    own time.  Of the legal enactments, placing the workman at a lower    level or at a disadvantage with regard to the master, at least the    most revolting were repealed.  And, practically, that horrid 'People's    Charter' actually became the political programme of the very    manufacturers who had opposed it to the last.  'The Abolition of the    Property Qualification' and 'Vote by Ballot' are now the law of the    land.  The Reform Acts "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17306"],["title","The Condition of the Working-Class in England in 1844 (#2)"],["body","1867 and 1884 make a near approach to    'universal suffrage,' at least such as it now exists in Germany; the    Redistribution Bill now before Parliament creates 'equal electoral    districts'--on the whole not more unequal than those of Germany;    'payment of members,' and shorter, if not actually 'annual    Parliaments,' are visibly looming in the distance--and yet there are    people who say that Chartism is dead.     \"The Revolution of 1848, not less than many of its predecessors, has    had strange bedfellows and successors.  The very people who put it    down have become, as Karl Marx used to say, its testamentary    executors.  Louis Napoleon had to create an independent and united    Italy, Bismarck had to revolutionise Germany and to restore Hungarian    independence, and the English manufacturers had to enact the People's    Charter.     \"For England, the effects of this domination of the manufacturing    capitalists were at first startling.  Trade revived and extended to a    degree unheard of even in this cradle of modern industry; the previous    astounding creations of steam and machinery dwindled into nothing    compared with the immense mass of productions of the twenty years from    1850 to 1870, with the overwhelming figures of exports and imports, of    wealth accumulated in the hands of capitalists and of human working    power concentrated in the large towns.  The progress was indeed    interrupted, as before, by a crisis every ten years, in 1857 as well    as in 1866; but these revulsions were now considered as natural,    inevitable events, which must be fatalistically submitted to, and    which always set themselves right in the end.     \"And the condition of the working-class during this period?  There was    temporary improvement even for the great mass.  But this improvement    always was reduced to the old level by the influx of the great body of    the unemployed reserve, by the constant superseding of bands by new    machinery, by the immigration of the agricultural population, now,    too, more and more superseded by machines.     \"A permanent improvement can be recognised for two 'protected'    sections only of the working-class.  Firstly, the factory hands.  The    fixing by Act of Parliament of their working-day within relatively    rational limits has restored their physical constitution and endowed    them with a moral superiority, enhanced by their local concentration.    They are undoubtedly better off than before 1848.  The best proof is    that, out of ten strikes they make, nine are provoked by the    manufacturers in their own interests, as the only means of securing a    reduced production.  You can never get the masters to agree to work    'short time,' let manufactured goods be ever so unsaleable; but get    the workpeople to strike, and the masters shut their factories to a    man.     \"Secondly, the great Trades' Unions.  They are the organisations of    those trades in which the labour of _grown-up men_ predominates, or is    alone applicable.  Here the competition neither of women and children    nor of machinery has so far weakened their organised strength.  The    engineers, the carpenters, and joiners, the bricklayers, are each of    them a power, to that extent that, as in the case of the bricklayers    and bricklayers' labourers, they can even successfully resist the    introduction of machinery.  That their condition has remarkably    improved since 1848 there can be no doubt, and the best proof of this    is in the fact, that for more than fifteen years not only have their    employers been with them, but they with their employers, upon    exceedingly good terms.  They form an aristocracy among the working-    class; they have succeeded in enforcing for themselves a relatively    comfortable position, and they accept it as final.  They are the model    working-men of Messrs. Leone Levi & Giffen, and they are very nice    people indeed nowadays to deal with, for any sensible capitalist in    particular and for the whole capitalist class in general.     \"But as to the great mass of working-people, the state of misery and    insecurity in which they live now is as low as ever, if not lower.  The    East End of London is an everspreading pool of stagnant misery and    desolation, of starvation when out of work, and degradation, physical    and moral, when in work.  And so in all other large towns--abstraction    made of the privileged minority of the workers; and so in the smaller    towns and in the agricultural districts.  The law which reduces the    _value_ of labour-power to the value of the necessary means of    subsistence, and the other law which reduces its _average price_, as a    rule, to the minimum of those means of subsistence, these laws act    upon them with the irresistible force of an automatic engine, which    crushes them between its wheels.     \"This, then, was the position created by the Free Trade policy of    1847, and by twenty years of the rule of the manufacturing    capitalists.  But, then, a change came.  The crash of 1866 was,    indeed, followed by a slight and short revival about 1873; but that    did not last.  We did not, indeed, pass through the full crisis at the    time it was due, in 1877 or 1878; but we have had, ever since 1876, a    chronic state of stagnation in all dominant branches of industry.    Neither will the full crash come; nor will the period of longed-for    prosperity to which we used to be entitled before and after it.  A    dull depression, a chronic glut of all markets for all trades, that is    what we have been living in for nearly ten years.  How is this?     \"The Free Trade theory was based upon one assumption: that England was    to be the one great manufacturing centre of an agricultural world.  And    the actual fact is that this assumption has turned out to be a pure    delusion.  The conditions of modern industry, steam-power and    machinery, can be established wherever there is fuel, especially    coals.  And other countries beside England,--France, Belgium, Germany,    America, even Russia,--have coals.  And the people over there did not    see the advantage of being turned into Irish pauper farmers merely for    the greater wealth and glory of English capitalists.  They set    resolutely about manufacturing, not only for themselves, but for the    rest of the world; and the consequence is, that the manufacturing    monopoly enjoyed by England for nearly a century is irretrievably    broken up.     \"But the manufacturing monopoly of England is the pivot of the present    social system of England.  Even while that monopoly lasted, the    markets could not keep pace with the increasing productivity of    English manufacturers; the decennial crises were the consequence.  And    new markets are getting scarcer every day, so much so that even the    negroes of the Congo are now to be forced into the civilisation    attendant upon Manchester calicos, Staffordshire pottery, and    Birmingham hardware.  How will it be when Continental, and especially    American, goods flow in in ever-increasing quantities--when the    predominating share, still held by British manufacturers, will become    reduced from year to year?  Answer, Free Trade, thou universal    panacea.     \"I am not the first to point this out.  Already, in 1883, at the    Southport meeting of the British Association, Mr. Inglis Palgrave, the    President of the Economic section, stated plainly that 'the days of    great trade profits in England were over, and there was a pause in the    progress of several great branches of industrial labour.  _The country    might almost be said to be entering the non-progressive state_.'     \"But what is to be the consequence?  Capitalist production _cannot_    stop.  It must go on increasing and expanding, or it must die.  Even    now, the mere reduction of England's lion's share in the supply of the    world's markets means stagnation, distress, excess of capital here,    excess of unemployed workpeople there.  What will it be when the    increase of yearly production is brought to a complete stop?     \"Here is the vulnerable place, the heel of Achilles, for capitalistic    production.  Its very basis is the necessity of constant expansion,    and this constant expansion now becomes impossible.  It ends in a    deadlock.  Every year England is brought nearer face to face with the    question: either the country must go to pieces, or capitalist    production must.  Which is it to be?     \"And the working-class?  If even under the unparalleled commercial and    industrial expansion, from 1848 to 1866, they have had to undergo such    misery; if even then the great bulk of them experienced at best but a    temporary improvement of their condition, while only a small,    privileged, 'protected' minority was permanently benefited, what will    it be when this dazzling period is brought finally to a close; when    the present dreary stagnation shall not only become intensified, but    this, its intensified condition, shall become the permanent and normal    state of English trade?     \"The truth is this: during the period of England's industrial monopoly    the English working-class have, to a certain extent, shared in the    benefits of the monopoly.  These benefits were very unequally    parcelled out amongst them; the privileged minority pocketed most, but    even the great mass had, at least, a temporary share now and then.  And    that is the reason why, since the dying-out of Owenism, there has been    no Socialism in England.  With the breakdown of that monopoly, the    English working-class will lose that privileged position; it will find    itself generally--the privileged and leading minority not excepted--on    a level with its fellow-workers abroad.  And that is the reason why    there will be Socialism again in England.\"  To this statement of the case, as that case appeared to me in"]]]
