But if we were to call _A_ the point 2, _B_ the point 6, 1, _C_ the point 5, and _D_ the point 4, 3, then the intersection _P_ of the tangents at _B_ and _D_ are also on this same line _u_. Thus _L_, _M_, _N_, and _P_ are four points on a straight line. The consequences of this theorem are so numerous and important that we shall devote a separate chapter to them.     *77. Inscribed triangle.*  Finally, three of the vertices of the hexagon may coalesce, giving a triangle inscribed in a conic. Pascal’s theorem then reads as follows (Fig. 17) for this case:  _The three tangents at the vertices of a triangle inscribed in a conic meet the opposite sides in three points on a straight line._                                 [Figure 18]                                   FIG. 18     *78. Degenerate conic.*  If we apply Pascal’s theorem to a degenerate conic made up of a pair of straight lines, we get the following theorem (Fig. 18):  _If three points, __A__, __B__, __C__, are chosen on one line, and three points, __A’__, __B’__, __C’__, are chosen on another, then the three points __L = AB’-A’B__, __M = BC’-B’C__, __N = CA’-C’A__ are all on a straight line._     PROBLEMS   1. In Fig. 12, select different lines _u_ and trace the locus of the center of perspectivity _M_ of the lines _u_ and _u’_.  2. Given four points, _A_, _B_, _C_, _D_, in the plane, construct a fifth point _P_ such that the lines _PA_, _PB_, _PC_, _PD_ shall be four harmonic lines.  _Suggestion._ Draw a line _a_ through the point _A_ such that the four lines _a_, _AB_, _AC_, _AD_ are harmonic. Construct now a conic through _A_, _B_, _C_, and _D_ having _a_ for a tangent at _A_.  3. Where are all the points _P_, as determined in the preceding question, to be found?  4. Select any five points in the plane and draw the tangent to the conic through them at each of the five points.  5. Given four points on the conic, and the tangent at one of them, to construct the conic. (\"To construct the conic\" means here to construct as many other points as may be desired.)  6.  Given three points on the conic, and the tangent at two of them, to construct the conic.  7.  Given five points, two of which are at infinity in different directions, to construct the conic. (In this, and in the following examples, the student is supposed to be able to draw a line parallel to a given line.)  8.  Given four points on a conic (two of which are at infinity and two in the finite part of the plane), together with the tangent at one of the finite points, to construct the conic.  9.  The tangents to a curve at its infinitely distant points are called its _asymptotes_ if they pass through a finite part of the plane. Given the asymptotes and a finite point of a conic, to construct the conic.  10.  Given an asymptote and three finite points on the conic, to determine the conic.  11.  Given four points, one of which is at infinity, and given also that the line at infinity is a tangent line, to construct the conic.      CHAPTER V - PENCILS OF RAYS OF THE SECOND ORDER     *79. Pencil of rays of the second order defined.*  If the corresponding points of two projective point-rows be joined by straight lines, a system of lines is obtained which is called a pencil of rays of the second order. This name arises from the fact, easily shown (§ 57), that at most two lines of the system may pass through any arbitrary point in the plane. For if through any point there should pass three lines of the system, then this point might be taken as the center of two projective pencils, one projecting one point-row and the other projecting the other. Since, now, these pencils have three rays of one coincident with the corresponding rays of the other, the two are identical and the two point-rows are in perspective position, which was not supposed.                                 [Figure 19]                                   FIG. 19     *80. Tangents to a circle.*  To get a clear notion of this system of lines, we may first show that the tangents to a circle form a system of this kind. For take any two tangents, _u_ and _u’_, to a circle, and let _A_ and _B_ be the points of contact (Fig. 19). Let now _t_ be any third tangent with point of contact at _C_ and meeting _u_ and _u’_ in _P_ and _P’_ respectively. Join _A_, _B_, _P_, _P’_, and _C_ to _O_, the center of the circle. Tangents from any point to a circle are equal, and therefore the triangles _POA_ and _POC_ are equal, as also are the triangles _P’OB_ and _P’OC_. Therefore the angle _POP’_ is constant, being equal to half the constant angle _AOC + COB_. This being true, if we take any four harmonic points, _P__1_, _P__2_, _P__3_, _P__4_, on the line _u_, they will project to _O_ in four harmonic lines, and the tangents to the circle from these four points will meet _u’_ in four harmonic points, _P’__1_, _P’__2_, _P’__3_, _P’__4_, because the lines from these points to _O_ inclose the same angles as the lines from the points _P__1_, _P__2_, _P__3_, _P__4_ on _u_. The point-row on _u_ is therefore projective to the point-row on _u’_. Thus the tangents to a circle are seen to join corresponding points on two projective point-rows, and so, according to the definition, form a pencil of rays of the second order.     *81. Tangents to a conic.*  If now this figure be projected to a point outside the plane of the circle, and any section of the resulting cone be made by a plane, we can easily see that the system of rays tangent to any conic section is a pencil of rays of the second order. The converse is also true, as we shall see later, and a pencil of rays of the second order is also a set of lines tangent to a conic section.     *82.*  The point-rows _u_ and _u’_ are, themselves, lines of the system, for to the common point of the two point-rows, considered as a point of _u_, must correspond some point of _u’_, and the line joining these two corresponding points is clearly _u’_ itself. Similarly for the line _u_.     *83. Determination of the pencil.*  We now show that _it is possible to assign arbitrarily three lines, __a__, __b__, and __c__, of __ the system (besides the lines __u__ and __u’__); but if these three lines are chosen, the system is completely determined._  This statement is equivalent to the following:  _Given three pairs of corresponding points in two projective point-rows, it is possible to find a point in one which corresponds to any point of the other._  We proceed, then, to the solution of the fundamental  PROBLEM. _Given three pairs of points, __AA’__, __BB’__, and __CC’__, of two projective point-rows __u__ and __u’__, to find the point __D’__ of __u’__ which corresponds to any given point __D__ of __u__._                                 [Figure 20]                                   FIG. 20   On the line _a_, joining _A_ and _A’_, take two points, _S_ and _S’_, as centers of pencils perspective to _u_ and _u’_ respectively (Fig. 20). The figure will be much simplified if we take _S_ on _BB’_ and _S’_ on _CC’_. _SA_ and _S’A’_ are corresponding rays of _S_ and _S’_, and the two pencils are therefore in perspective position. It is not difficult to see that the axis of perspectivity _m_ is the line joining _B’_ and _C_. Given any point _D_ on _u_, to find the corresponding point _D’_ on _u’_ we proceed as follows: Join _D_ to _S_ and note where the joining line meets _m_. Join this point to _S’_. This last line meets _u’_ in the desired point _D’_.  We have now in this figure six lines of the system, _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, _u_, and _u’_. Fix now the position of _u_, _u’_, _b_, _c_, and _d_, and take four lines of the system, _a__1_, _a__2_, _a__3_, _a__4_, which meet _b_ in four harmonic points. These points project to _D_, giving four harmonic points on _m_. These again project to _D’_, giving four harmonic points on _c_. It is thus clear that the rays _a__1_, _a__2_, _a__3_, _a__4_ cut out two projective point-rows on any two lines of the system. Thus _u_ and _u’_ are not special rays, and any two rays of the system will serve as the point-rows to generate the system of lines.     *84. Brianchon’s theorem.*  From the figure also appears a fundamental theorem due to Brianchon:  _If __1__, __2__, __3__, __4__, __5__, __6__ are any six rays of a pencil of the second order, then the lines __l = (12, 45)__, __m = (23, 56)__, __n = (34, 61)__ all pass through a point._                                 [Figure 21]                                   FIG. 21     *85.*  To make the notation fit the figure (Fig. 21), make _a=1_, _b = 2_, _u’ = 3_, _d = 4_, _u = 5_, _c = 6_; or, interchanging two of the lines, _a = 1_, _c = 2_, _u = 3_, _d = 4_, _u’ = 5_, _b = 6_. Thus, by different namings of the lines, it appears that not more than 60 different _Brianchon points_ are possible. If we call 12 and 45 opposite vertices of a circumscribed hexagon, then Brianchon’s theorem may be stated as follows:  _The three lines joining the three pairs of opposite vertices of a hexagon circumscribed about a conic meet in a point._     *86. Construction of the pencil by Brianchon’s theorem.* Brianchon’s theorem furnishes a ready method of determining a sixth line of the pencil of rays of the second order when five are given. Thus, select a point in line 1 and suppose that line 6 is to pass through it. Then _l = (12, 45)_, _n = (34, 61)_, and the line _m = (23, 56)_ must pass through _(l, n)_. Then _(23, ln)_ meets 5 in a point of the required sixth line.                                 [Figure 22]                                   FIG. 22     *87. Point of contact of a tangent to a conic.* If the line 2 approach as a limiting position the line 1, then the intersection _(1, 2)_ approaches as a limiting position the point of contact of 1 with the conic. This suggests an easy way to construct the point of contact of any tangent with the conic. Thus (Fig. 22), given the lines 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to construct the point of contact of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17002"],["title","History and Ecclesiastical Relations of the Churches of the Presbyterial Order (#0)"],["body","AND  ECCLESIASTICAL RELATIONS  OF THE  CHURCHES OF THE PRESBYTERIAL ORDER,  AT  AMOY, CHINA.  BY  REV. J.V.N. TALMAGE,  MISSIONARY OF THE PROT. REF. DUTCH CHURCH.  New York: WYNKOOP, HALLENBECK & THOMAS, PRINTERS, 113 FULTON ST. 1863.     PREFACE.   _To the Ministers, Elders, and Members of the Reformed Dutch Church_:  It is proper that I give some reasons for the publication of this paper. The importance of the subject of the ecclesiastical organization of the churches gathered in heathen lands, I conceive to be a sufficient reason. Those who may differ in regard to the views set forth in this paper, will not dispute the importance of the subject. Instead of the questions involved having been settled by any of the Presbyterian Denominations of this country (the Dutch Church included among them), by experiments in India or any other heathen land, very few of the churches gathered from the heathen, by these various Denominations, have yet arrived at a stage of development sufficient for practical application of the experiment. (See foot-note, page 160.) There are, however, a few mission churches, where the subject is now becoming one of vast practical importance. The Church at Amoy stands out prominent among these. With the continuance of the divine blessing there will soon be many such. Hence the importance of the discussion, and its importance _now_.  Many experiments have been made in reference to the best way of conducting the work of missions. The Church has improved by them, and has been compelled to _unlearn_ many things. We are continually returning towards the simple plan laid down in God's Word. As the Church by experiment and by discussion has thus been led to retrace some of her steps in the preliminary work of missions, should she not be ready to take advantage of experiment and discussion, in reference to the ecclesiastical organization of the mission churches, and stand ready to retrace some of her steps in this second stage of the work of missions, if need be, in order to conform more fully to the doctrines of our Presbyterial church polity? I would use the phrase _Scriptural church polity_, but I suppose it is the universal belief of our Church, that Presbyterial polity is scriptural. At any rate, it is the duty of the Church to examine the subject carefully. She has nothing to fear from such examination. She should fear to neglect it.  In addition to the importance of the subject in itself considered, I have other reasons for discussing it at the present time. There are mistaken impressions abroad in the Church, concerning the views and course of your missionaries at Amoy, which must be injurious to the cause of missions in our Church. It would seem to be a plain duty to correct these impressions. I will quote an extract from a letter, I recently received, from an honored missionary of a sister Church:  \"I have heard much, and seen some notices in the papers of the battle you fought on the floor of Synod, and would like to hear your side of the subject from your own mouth, as the question has also been a practical one with us. * * * * * We have our own Presbytery, and manage our own business, and insist on not having too much of what they call the new science of Missionary management; a science which, I believe, has been cultivated far too assiduously. It was this, more than anything else, which kept me from going out under the A.B.C.F.M., and to Amoy. * * * * * I hear, however, from some, that what you and the brethren there had formed, was some sort of loose Congregational association. If so, I must judge against you, for I believe in the _jure divino_ of Presbytery (or Classis if you choose so to call it), and I think you and they should have been allowed to form a Presbytery there, and manage all your own affairs, and that your Boards at home should be content to consider themselves a committee to raise and send on the funds. But it is hard for the D. D's and big folk at home to come to that. They think they must manage everything, or all will go wrong; while how little it is that they can be brought to know or realize of the real nature of the work abroad; and then it is the old battle of patronage over again. Those who give the money must _govern_, and those who receive it must give up their liberty, and be no longer Christ's freemen.\"  This is only a specimen, one of many, of the mistaken impressions abroad in the Church concerning the views and doings of your Missionaries. May we not, _must_ we not, correct them? The letter also illustrates the evils resulting from allowing mistaken impressions to remain in the Church uncorrected. There has long been an impression in our Church that the A.B.C.F.M. interfered with the ecclesiastical affairs of our missions. We have been informed that several of our young men, before our Church separated from that Board, were deterred thereby from devoting themselves to the foreign Missionary work. The writer of the above letter, probably having more of the Missionary spirit, was not willing, on that account, to give up the work, but was led to offer himself to the Board of a sister Church. The Mission at Amoy, and our Church, have thus been deprived of the benefit of his labors by means of an erroneous impression. When we learned the fact of such an impression existing in this country, we endeavored to correct it. In our letter of 1856, to General Synod, we called particular attention to the subject. Here is a part of one sentence: \"It seems to us a duty, and we take this opportunity to bear testimony, that neither Dr. Anderson, nor the Prudential Committee have ever, in any communication which we have received from them, in any way, either by dictation, or by the expression of opinions, interfered in the least with our ecclesiastical relations.\" We failed to get that letter published, and I find the erroneous impression still prevalent, working its mischief in the churches.  But to return to the subject of the mistaken impressions concerning the views of your Missionaries at Amoy. These impressions would have been partly corrected in the Church, if the report of the proceedings of Synod, in \"The Christian Intelligencer,\" had been more correct on this subject. That paper states, that, on Friday evening, \"Rev. Mr. Talmage then took the floor, and addressed the Synod for nearly two hours,\" but does not give a single word or idea uttered by him. It is careful to report the only _unkind words_ against the Missionaries uttered during that whole discussion, which, with this single exception, was conducted in a spirit of the utmost Christian kindness; but does not give a word of the remarks made on the Friday evening previous, on that very subject, in justification of their course.  It seems to be a duty, though painful, to speak particularly on this subject. Look at the following language: \"I know that we are told that the _hybrid organization_ [i.e. the Classis, _a court of the Church of Christ_, at Amoy] which now exists is every way sufficient and satisfactory; that it is the fruit of Christian love, and that to disturb it would be rending the body of Christ. Here one might ask, how it came to exist at all, seeing that this Synod spoke so plainly, and unambiguously, in 1857; and _I, for one, cordially concur in the remark of the elder, Schieffelin, that the brethren there 'deserve censure_.' We do not censure them, nor do we propose to do so; _but that they deserve it is undeniable_. But the point is, how can our disapproval of _the mongrel Classis_ mar the peace of the Amoy brethren?\" This language was used by the President of Synod, after asking whether the Synod was ready for the question, \"the question being about to be put,\" when an attempt to answer it seemed altogether out of place. In all the circumstances it seemed almost like the charge of a judge to a jury. I do not say that there is any improper spirit manifested, or opprobrious expressions employed in this language, or that the President did wrong in waiting until the discussion was over before he uttered it, or that the missionaries are not deserving of such severe censure--of all these things let the Church judge--but I do say that the spreading of such language and such charges broadcast, before the Church and before the world, demands that the missionaries be heard in self-defense, or, which is all they ask, that they be allowed to state the facts and views which guided them in their action.  Doubtless it was an oversight that such a one-sided report on this subject appeared in The Christian Intelligencer. At least it was not at all designed that injustice be done to the Missionaries, but, unless they be allowed to speak for themselves, is not injustice done them? It seemed to me that a very mistaken impression concerning the views expressed by me, near the close of the session of Synod, was also conveyed by the Report. This I attempted to correct by a note to the editor, but even the right of correcting my own sentiments and language was refused, my note garbled, and, as I thought, my views again misrepresented. More than this, the _implied_ charge is published to the world that I am seeking to excite \"dissension among the churches,\" and \"opposition to the constituted authority of Synod.\"[1] It would therefore be great dereliction of duty to return to my field of labor, allowing my own views, and the views of my co-laborers, to be thus mistaken in the Church, and such serious charges against our course unanswered. I am not aware that any censorship of the press has been authorized by General Synod. Surely if others are allowed to be heard for us we should be allowed the right to be heard for ourselves. We were unable by writing from Amoy to get our views before the Church. I must, therefore, while in this land, endeavor to make them known.
