We proceed to show that _A_ and _C_ are also harmonic conjugates with respect to _B_ and _D_—that is, that it is possible to find a quadrangle of which two opposite sides shall pass through _B_, two through _D_, and of the remaining pair, one through _A_ and the other through _C_.                                  [Figure 5]                                    FIG. 5   Let _O_ be the intersection of _KM_ and _LN_ (Fig. 5). Join _O_ to _A_ and _C_. The joining lines cut out on the sides of the quadrangle four points, _P_, _Q_, _R_, _S_. Consider the quadrangle _P_, _K_, _Q_, _O_. One pair of opposite sides passes through _A_, one through _C_, and one remaining side through _D_; therefore the other remaining side must pass through _B_. Similarly, _RS_ passes through _B_ and _PS_ and _QR_ pass through _D_. The quadrangle _P_, _Q_, _R_, _S_ therefore has two opposite sides through _B_, two through _D_, and the remaining pair through _A_ and _C_. _A_ and _C_ are thus harmonic conjugates with respect to _B_ and _D_. We may sum up the discussion, therefore, as follows:     *30.*  If _A_ and _C_ are harmonic conjugates with respect to _B_ and _D_, then _B_ and _D_ are harmonic conjugates with respect to _A_ and _C_.     *31. Importance of the notion.*  The importance of the notion of four harmonic points lies in the fact that it is a relation which is carried over from four points in a point-row _u_ to the four points that correspond to them in any point-row _u’_ perspective to _u_.  To prove this statement we construct a quadrangle _K_, _L_, _M_, _N_ such that _KL_ and _MN_ pass through _A_, _KN_ and _LM_ through _C_, _LN_ through _B_, and _KM_ through _D_. Take now any point _S_ not in the plane of the quadrangle and construct the planes determined by _S_ and all the seven lines of the figure. Cut across this set of planes by another plane not passing through _S_. This plane cuts out on the set of seven planes another quadrangle which determines four new harmonic points, _A’_, _B’_, _C’_, _D’_, on the lines joining _S_ to _A_, _B_, _C_, _D_. But _S_ may be taken as any point, since the original quadrangle may be taken in any plane through _A_, _B_, _C_, _D_; and, further, the points _A’_, _B’_, _C’_, _D’_ are the intersection of _SA_, _SB_, _SC_, _SD_ by any line. We have, then, the remarkable theorem:     *32.*  _If any point is joined to four harmonic points, and the four lines thus obtained are cut by any fifth, the four points of intersection are again harmonic._     *33. Four harmonic lines.*  We are now able to extend the notion of harmonic elements to pencils of rays, and indeed to axial pencils. For if we define _four harmonic rays_ as four rays which pass through a point and which pass one through each of four harmonic points, we have the theorem  _Four harmonic lines are cut by any transversal in four harmonic points._     *34. Four harmonic planes.*  We also define _four harmonic planes_ as four planes through a line which pass one through each of four harmonic points, and we may show that  _Four harmonic planes are cut by any plane not passing through their common line in four harmonic lines, and also by any line in four harmonic points._  For let the planes α, β, γ, δ, which all pass through the line _g_, pass also through the four harmonic points _A_, _B_, _C_, _D_, so that α passes through _A_, etc. Then it is clear that any plane π through _A_, _B_, _C_, _D_ will cut out four harmonic lines from the four planes, for they are lines through the intersection _P_ of _g_ with the plane π, and they pass through the given harmonic points _A_, _B_, _C_, _D_. Any other plane σ cuts _g_ in a point _S_ and cuts α, β, γ, δ in four lines that meet π in four points _A’_, _B’_, _C’_, _D’_ lying on _PA_, _PB_, _PC_, and _PD_ respectively, and are thus four harmonic hues. Further, any ray cuts α, β, γ, δ in four harmonic points, since any plane through the ray gives four harmonic lines of intersection.     *35.*  These results may be put together as follows:  _Given any two assemblages of points, rays, or planes, perspectively related to each other, four harmonic elements of one must correspond to four elements of the other which are likewise harmonic._  If, now, two forms are perspectively related to a third, any four harmonic elements of one must correspond to four harmonic elements in the other. We take this as our definition of projective correspondence, and say:     *36. Definition of projectivity.*  _Two fundamental forms are protectively related to each other when a one-to-one correspondence exists between the elements of the two and when four harmonic elements of one correspond to four harmonic elements of the other._                                  [Figure 6]                                    FIG. 6     *37. Correspondence between harmonic conjugates.*  Given four harmonic points, _A_, _B_, _C_, _D_; if we fix _A_ and _C_, then _B_ and _D_ vary together in a way that should be thoroughly understood. To get a clear conception of their relative motion we may fix the points _L_ and _M_ of the quadrangle _K_, _L_, _M_, _N_ (Fig. 6). Then, as _B_ describes the point-row _AC_, the point _N_ describes the point-row _AM_ perspective to it. Projecting _N_ again from _C_, we get a point-row _K_ on _AL_ perspective to the point-row _N_ and thus projective to the point-row _B_. Project the point-row _K_ from _M_ and we get a point-row _D_ on _AC_ again, which is projective to the point-row _B_. For every point _B_ we have thus one and only one point _D_, and conversely. In other words, we have set up a one-to-one correspondence between the points of a single point-row, which is also a projective correspondence because four harmonic points _B_ correspond to four harmonic points _D_. We may note also that the correspondence is here characterized by a feature which does not always appear in projective correspondences: namely, the same process that carries one from _B_ to _D_ will carry one back from _D_ to _B_ again. This special property will receive further study in the chapter on Involution.     *38.*  It is seen that as _B_ approaches _A_, _D_ also approaches _A_. As _B_ moves from _A_ toward _C_, _D_ moves from _A_ in the opposite direction, passing through the point at infinity on the line _AC_, and returns on the other side to meet _B_ at _C_ again. In other words, as _B_ traverses _AC_, _D_ traverses the rest of the line from _A_ to _C_ through infinity. In all positions of _B_, except at _A_ or _C_, _B_ and _D_ are separated from each other by _A_ and _C_.     *39. Harmonic conjugate of the point at infinity.*  It is natural to inquire what position of _B_ corresponds to the infinitely distant position of _D_. We have proved (§ 27) that the particular quadrangle _K_, _L_, _M_, _N_ employed is of no consequence. We shall therefore avail ourselves of one that lends itself most readily to the solution of the problem. We choose the point _L_ so that the triangle _ALC_ is isosceles (Fig. 7). Since _D_ is supposed to be at infinity, the line _KM_ is parallel to _AC_. Therefore the triangles _KAC_ and _MAC_ are equal, and the triangle _ANC_ is also isosceles. The triangles _CNL_ and _ANL_ are therefore equal, and the line _LB_ bisects the angle _ALC_. _B_ is therefore the middle point of _AC_, and we have the theorem  _The harmonic conjugate of the middle point of __AC__ is at infinity._                                  [Figure 7]                                    FIG. 7     *40. Projective theorems and metrical theorems. Linear construction.* This theorem is the connecting link between the general protective theorems which we have been considering so far and the metrical theorems of ordinary geometry. Up to this point we have said nothing about measurements, either of line segments or of angles. Desargues’s theorem and the theory of harmonic elements which depends on it have nothing to do with magnitudes at all. Not until the notion of an infinitely distant point is brought in is any mention made of distances or directions. We have been able to make all of our constructions up to this point by means of the straightedge, or ungraduated ruler. A construction made with such an instrument we shall call a _linear_ construction. It requires merely that we be able to draw the line joining two points or find the point of intersection of two lines.     *41. Parallels and mid-points.*  It might be thought that drawing a line through a given point parallel to a given line was only a special case of drawing a line joining two points. Indeed, it consists only in drawing a line through the given point and through the \"infinitely distant point\" on the given line. It must be remembered, however, that the expression \"infinitely distant point\" must not be taken literally. When we say that two parallel lines meet \"at infinity,\" we really mean that they do not meet at all, and the only reason for using the expression is to avoid tedious statement of exceptions and restrictions to our theorems. We ought therefore to consider the drawing of a line parallel to a given line as a different accomplishment from the drawing of the line joining two given points. It is a remarkable consequence of the last theorem that a parallel to a given line and the mid-point of a given segment are equivalent data. For the construction is reversible, and if we are given the middle point of a given segment, we can construct _linearly_  a line parallel to that segment. Thus, given that _B_ is the middle point of _AC_, we may draw any two lines through _A_, and any line through _B_ cutting them in points _N_ and _L_. Join _N_ and _L_ to _C_ and get the points _K_ and _M_ on the two lines through _A_. Then _KM_ is parallel to _AC_. _The bisection of a given segment and the drawing of a line parallel to the segment are equivalent data when linear construction is used._     *42.*  It is not difficult to give a linear construction for the problem to divide a given"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17001"],["title","An Elementary Course in Synthetic Projective Geometry (#5)"],["body","into _n_ equal parts, given only a parallel to the segment. This is simple enough when _n_ is a power of _2_. For any other number, such as _29_, divide any segment on the line parallel to _AC_ into _32_ equal parts, by a repetition of the process just described. Take _29_ of these, and join the first to _A_ and the last to _C_. Let these joining lines meet in _S_. Join _S_ to all the other points. Other problems, of a similar sort, are given at the end of the chapter.     *43. Numerical relations.*  Since three points, given in order, are sufficient to determine a fourth, as explained above, it ought to be possible to reproduce the process numerically in view of the one-to-one correspondence which exists between points on a line and numbers; a correspondence which, to be sure, we have not established here, but which is discussed in any treatise on the theory of point sets. We proceed to discover what relation between four numbers corresponds to the harmonic relation between four points.                                  [Figure 8]                                    FIG. 8     *44.*  Let _A_, _B_, _C_, _D_ be four harmonic points (Fig. 8), and let _SA_, _SB_, _SC_, _SD_ be four harmonic lines. Assume a line drawn through _B_ parallel to _SD_, meeting _SA_ in _A’_ and _SC_ in _C’_. Then _A’_, _B’_, _C’_, and the infinitely distant point on _A’C’_ are four harmonic points, and therefore _B_ is the middle point of the segment _A’C’_. Then, since the triangle _DAS_ is similar to the triangle _BAA’_, we may write the proportion                            _AB : AD = BA’ : SD._  Also, from the similar triangles _DSC_ and _BCC’_, we have                            _CD : CB = SD : B’C._  From these two proportions we have, remembering that _BA’ = BC’_,                                  [formula]  the minus sign being given to the ratio on account of the fact that _A_ and _C_ are always separated from _B_ and _D_, so that one or three of the segments _AB_, _CD_, _AD_, _CB_ must be negative.     *45.*  Writing the last equation in the form                            _CB : AB = -CD : AD,_  and using the fundamental relation connecting three points on a line,                               _PR + RQ = PQ,_  which holds for all positions of the three points if account be taken of the sign of the segments, the last proportion may be written                     _(CB - BA) : AB = -(CA - DA) : AD,_  or                      _(AB - AC) : AB = (AC - AD) : AD;_  so that _AB_, _AC_, and _AD_ are three quantities in hamonic progression, since the difference between the first and second is to the first as the difference between the second and third is to the third. Also, from this last proportion comes the familiar relation                                  [formula]  which is convenient for the computation of the distance _AD_ when _AB_ and _AC_ are given numerically.     *46. Anharmonic ratio.*  The corresponding relations between the trigonometric functions of the angles determined by four harmonic lines are not difficult to obtain, but as we shall not need them in building up the theory of projective geometry, we will not discuss them here. Students who have a slight acquaintance with trigonometry may read in a later chapter (§ 161) a development of the theory of a more general relation, called the _anharmonic ratio_, or _cross ratio_, which connects any four points on a line.     PROBLEMS   *1*. Draw through a given point a line which shall pass through the inaccessible point of intersection of two given lines. The following construction may be made to depend upon Desargues’s theorem: Through the given point _P_ draw any two rays cutting the two lines in the points _AB’_ and _A’B_, _A_, _B_, lying on one of the given lines and _A’_, _B’_, on the other. Join _AA’_ and _BB’_, and find their point of intersection _S_. Through _S_ draw any other ray, cutting the given lines in _CC’_. Join _BC’_ and _B’C_, and obtain their point of intersection _Q_. _PQ_ is the desired line. Justify this construction.  *2.*  To draw through a given point _P_ a line which shall meet two given lines in points _A_ and _B_, equally distant from _P_. Justify the following construction: Join _P_ to the point _S_ of intersection of the two given lines. Construct the fourth harmonic of _PS_ with respect to the two given lines. Draw through _P_ a line parallel to this line. This is the required line.  *3.*  Given a parallelogram in the same plane with a given segment _AC_, to construct linearly the middle point of _AC_.  *4.*  Given four harmonic lines, of which one pair are at right angles to each other, show that the other pair make equal angles with them. This is a theorem of which frequent use will be made.  *5.*  Given the middle point of a line segment, to draw a line parallel to the segment and passing through a given point.  *6.*  A line is drawn cutting the sides of a triangle _ABC_ in the points _A’_, _B’_, _C’_ the point _A’_ lying on the side _BC_, etc. The harmonic conjugate of _A’_ with respect to _B_ and _C_ is then constructed and called _A\"_. Similarly, _B\"_ and _C\"_ are constructed. Show that _A\"B\"C\"_ lie on a straight line. Find other sets of three points on a line in the figure. Find also sets of three lines through a point.      CHAPTER III - COMBINATION OF TWO PROJECTIVELY RELATED FUNDAMENTAL FORMS                                     [Figure 9]                                    FIG. 9   *47. Superposed fundamental forms. Self-corresponding elements.* We have seen (§ 37) that two projective point-rows may be superposed upon the same straight line. This happens, for example, when two pencils which are projective to each other are cut across by a straight line. It is also possible for two projective pencils to have the same center. This happens, for example, when two projective point-rows are projected to the same point. Similarly, two projective axial pencils may have the same axis. We examine now the possibility of two forms related in this way, having an element or elements that correspond to themselves. We have seen, indeed, that if _B_ and _D_ are harmonic conjugates with respect to _A_ and _C_, then the point-row described by _B_ is projective to the point-row described by _D_, and that _A_ and _C_ are self-corresponding points. Consider more generally the case of two pencils perspective to each other with axis of perspectivity _u’_ (Fig. 9). Cut across them by a line _u_. We get thus two projective point-rows superposed on the same line _u_, and a moment’s reflection serves to show that the point _N_ of intersection _u_ and _u’_ corresponds to itself in the two point-rows. Also, the point _M_, where _u_ intersects the line joining the centers of the two pencils, is seen to correspond to itself. It is thus possible for two projective point-rows, superposed upon the same line, to have two self-corresponding points. Clearly _M_ and _N_ may fall together if the line joining the centers of the pencils happens to pass through the point of intersection of the lines _u_ and _u’_.                                 [Figure 10]                                   FIG. 10     *48.*  We may also give an illustration of a case where two superposed projective point-rows have no self-corresponding points at all. Thus we may take two lines revolving about a fixed point _S_ and always making the same angle a with each other (Fig. 10). They will cut out on any line _u_ in the plane two point-rows which are easily seen to be projective. For, given any four rays _SP_ which are harmonic, the four corresponding rays _SP’_ must also be harmonic, since they make the same angles with each other. Four harmonic points _P_ correspond, therefore, to four harmonic points _P’_. It is clear, however, that no point _P_ can coincide with its corresponding point _P’_, for in that case the lines _PS_ and _P’S_ would coincide, which is impossible if the angle between them is to be constant.     *49. Fundamental theorem. Postulate of continuity.* We have thus shown that two projective point-rows, superposed one on the other, may have two points, one point, or no point at all corresponding to themselves. We proceed to show that  _If two projective point-rows, superposed upon the same straight line, have more than two self-corresponding points, they must have an infinite number, and every point corresponds to itself; that is, the two point-rows are not essentially distinct._  If three points, _A_, _B_, and _C_, are self-corresponding, then the harmonic conjugate _D_ of _B_ with respect to _A_ and _C_ must also correspond to itself. For four harmonic points must always correspond to four harmonic points. In the same way the harmonic conjugate of _D_ with respect to _B_ and _C_ must correspond to itself. Combining new points with old in this way, we may obtain as many self-corresponding points as we wish. We show further that every point on the line is the limiting point of a finite or infinite sequence of self-corresponding points. Thus, let a point _P_ lie between _A_ and _B_. Construct now _D_, the fourth harmonic of _C_ with respect to _A_ and _B_. _D_ may coincide with _P_, in which case the sequence is closed; otherwise _P_ lies in the stretch _AD_ or in the stretch _DB_. If it lies in the stretch _DB_, construct the fourth harmonic of _C_ with respect to _D_ and _B_. This point _D’_ may coincide with _P_, in which case, as before, the sequence is closed. If _P_ lies in the stretch _DD’_, we construct the fourth harmonic of _C_ with respect to _DD’_, etc. In each step the region in which _P_ lies is diminished, and the process may be continued until two self-corresponding points are obtained on either side of _P_, and at distances from it arbitrarily small.  We now assume, explicitly, the fundamental postulate that the correspondence is _continuous_, that is, that _the distance between two points in one point-row may be made arbitrarily small by sufficiently diminishing "]]]
