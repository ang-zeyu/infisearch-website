Returning from the council chamber of the celestial glance through the paths of the surrounding gardens, came two sons of God. Apparently, the late events had affected them greatly. The assembly had dispersed, and, save now and then a fleeting figure, they were alone. They were engaged in earnest conversation.  \"But, Brother Sardus,\" said one, \"how can you look at it in that light? Lucifer was surely in the wrong. And then, how haughty and overbearing he was.\"  \"I cannot agree with you, Homan. We have a right to think and to act as we please, and I consider Lucifer in the right. Think of this magnificent offer, to bring back in glory to Father's presence, every one of His children, and that, too, without condition on their part.\"  \"There! He, and you with him, talk about your rights to think and act as you please. Have you not that right? Have you not used it freely in refusing to listen to Father's counsel? Do not I exercise it in that I listen and agree with Him? But let me tell you, brother, what your reasoning will lead to.\"  \"I know it--but go on.\"  \"No, you do not; you do not seem to understand.\"  \"Perhaps you will explain,\" said the other haughtily.  \"Brother, be not angry. It is because of my love for you that I speak thus. It is evident that we, in that future world of experience and trial, will retain our agencies to choose between the opposites that will be presented to us. Without that privilege, we should cease to be intelligences, and become as inanimate things. How could we be proved without this power? How could we make any progress without it?\"  \"I grant it all.\"  \"Then, what would Lucifer do? He would save you from the dangers of the world, whether you would or not. He would take away any need of volition or choice on our part. Do what we would, sink as deep into sin as we could, he would save us notwithstanding, without a trial, without a purging process, with all our sins upon us; and in this condition we are expected to go on to perfection, and become kings and priests unto God our Father, exercising power and dominion over our fellow creatures. Think of it! Evil would reign triumphant. Celestial order would be changed to chaos.\"  The other said not a word. He could not answer his brother's array of arguments.  \"Dear brother,\" continued Homan, \"never before have I received such sorrow as when I saw you follow that rebellious Son of Morning. Henceforth quit his company. I fear for him and his followers.\"  \"But he has such power over me, Homan. His eloquence seems to hold me, and his arguments certainly convince me. But I must go--and brother, come with me to the assembly which we are to hold. Many will be there from far and near. Will you come?\"  \"I cannot promise you, Sardus. Perhaps I may call and see what is said and done.\"  Then they parted.  Homan went to the gathering of which Sardus had spoken, and as had been intimated, he met many strange faces. Everywhere in the conversation, serious topics seemed to be uppermost. The singing was not as usual. The music, though always sweet, was sadder than ever before, and a discord seemed to have crept into the even flow of life's sweet strain. Homan had no desire to talk. He wandered from group to group with a smile for all. Sardus was in a heated discussion with some kindred spirits; but Homan did not join them. Under the beautiful spread of the trees and by the fountains, sat and walked companies of sons and daughters of God. Ah, they were fair to look upon, and Homan wondered at the creations of the Father. No two were alike, yet all bore an impress of the Creator, and each had an individual beauty of his own.  Strolling into an arbor of vines, Homan, did not observe the fair daughter seated there until he turned to leave; and then he saw her. She seemed absorbed in thought, and her eyes rested on the shiftings throngs.  \"A sweet face, and a strange one,\" thought he, as he went up to her and spoke:  \"Sister, what are you thinking about?\"  She turned and looked at him, and then a pleased smile overspread her face.  \"Shall I tell you?\"  \"Do, I beg of you. May I sit here?\" He seated himself opposite.  \"Yes, brother, sit. My thoughts had such a strange ending that I will tell you what they were. I have been sitting here looking at these many faces, both new and old, and studying their varied beauties; but none seems to me to answer for my ideal. So I have been taking a little from each face, putting all together to form another. I had just completed the composition, and was looking admiringly at the new form when you came and--and--\"  \"Drove away your picture. That I should not have done.\"  \"No; it was not exactly that. It is so odd.\" She hesitated and turned away her head. Then she looked up into his face again and said: \"My dream face seemed to blend with yours.\"  They looked at each other strangely.  \"Do you often make dream pictures?\" asked he.  \"Yes, of late; but I sometimes think I should not.\"  \"Why?\"  \"Because of them any great events that are taking place around us daily which need our careful thought and consideration. I have been trying to comprehend this great plan of our Father's in regards to us. I have asked Mother many questions, and she has explained, but I cannot fully understand--only, it all seems so wonderful, and our Father is so good and great and wise;--but how could He be otherwise, having Himself come up through the school of the eternities?\"  Her words were music to Homan's ear. Her voice was soft and sweet.  \"Yet it is very strange. To think that we shall forget all we know, and that our memories will fail to recall this world at all.\"  \"Yes, it is all strange to us, but it cannot be otherwise. You see, if we knew all about what we really are and what our past has been, mortal experiences would not be the test or the school that Father intends it to be.\"  \"That is true; but think of being shut out, even in our thoughts, from this world. And then, I hear that down on earth there will be much sin and misery, and a power to tempt and lead astray. O, if we can but resist it, dear brother. What will this power be, do you know?\"  \"I have only my thoughts about it. I know nothing for a certainty; but fear not, something will prompt us to the right, and we have this hope that Father's Spirit will not forsake us. And above all, our Elder Brother has been accepted as an offering for all the sins we may do. He will come to us in purity, and with power to loose the bands of death. He will bring to us Father's law whereby we may overcome the world and its sin.\"  \"You said the bands of death. What is death?\"  \"Death is simply the losing of our earthly tabernacles for a time. We shall be separated from them, but the promise is that our Elder Brother will be given power to raise them up again. With them again united, we shall become even as our parents are now, eternal, perfected, celestialized beings.\"  As they conversed, both faces shone with a soft, beautiful light. The joy within was traced on their countenances, and for some time it was too deep for words. Homan was drawn to this beautiful sister. All were pleasing to his eye, but he was unusually attracted to one who took such pleasure in talking about matters nearest his heart.  \"I must be going,\" said she.  \"May I go with you?\"  \"Come.\"  They wandered silently among the people, then out through the surrounding gardens, listening to the music. Instinctively, they clung to each other, nor bestowed more than a smile or a word on passing brother or sister.  \"What do you think of Lucifer and his plan?\" asked she.  \"The talented Son of the Morning is in danger of being cast out if he persists in his course. As to his plan, it is this: 'If I cannot rule, I will ruin.'\"  \"And if he rule, it will still be ruin, it seems to me.\"  \"True; and he is gaining power over many.\"  \"Yes; he has talked with me. He is a bewitching person; but his fascination has something strange about it which I do not like.\"  \"I am glad of that.\"  She looked quickly at him, and then they gazed again into each other's eyes.  \"By what name may I call you?\" he asked.  \"My name is Delsa.\"  \"Will you tell me where you live? May I come and talk with you again? It will give me much pleasure.\"  \"Which pleasure will be mutual,\" said she.  They parted at the junction of two paths.     II.    \"How art thou fallen from heaven, O, Lucifer, son of the   morning.\"--_Isaiah 14:12._   Never before in the experiences of the intelligences of heaven, had such dire events been foreshadowed. A crisis was certainly at hand. Lucifer was fast gaining influence among the spirits--and they had their agency to follow whom they would. The revolting spirit had skill in argument; and the light-minded, the discontented, and the rebellious were won over.  To be assured eternal glory and power without an effort on their part, appealed to them as something to be desired. To be untrammeled with laws, to be free to act at pleasure, without jeopardizing their future welfare, certainly was an attractive proposition. The pleasures in the body would be of a nature hitherto unknown. Why not be free to enjoy them? Why this curb on the passions and desires? \"Hail to Lucifer and his plan! We will follow him. He is in the right.\"  Many of the mighty and noble children of God arrayed themselves on the side of Christ, their Elder Brother, and waged war against Lucifer's pernicious doctrine. One of the foremost among them was Michael. He was unceasing in his efforts to bring all under the authority of the Father. The plan which had been proposed, and which had been accepted by the majority, had been evolved from the wisdom of past eternities. It had exalted worlds before. It had been proved wise and just. It was founded on correct principles. By it only could the spiritual creation go on in its evolution to greater and to higher things. It was the will of the Father, to whom they all owed their existence as progressive, spiritual"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17249"],["title","Added Upon (#2)"],["body",". To bow to Him was no humiliation. To honor and obey Him was their duty. To follow the First Born, Him whom the Father had chosen as mediator, was no more than a Father should request. Any other plan would lead to confusion. Thus reasoned the followers of Christ.  Then there were others, not valiant in either cause, who stood on neutral ground. Without strength of character to come out boldly, they aided neither the right nor the wrong. Weak-minded as they were, they could not be trusted, nor could Lucifer win them over.  Meanwhile, the earth, rolling in space, evolved from its chaotic state, and in time became a fit abode for the higher creations of God.  Then the crisis came. The edict went forth that for many of the sons and daughters of God the first estate was about to end, and that the second would be ushered in. Lucifer had now won over many of the hosts of heaven. These had failed to keep their first estate. Now there would be a separation.  A council was convened, and the leading spirits were summoned. All waited for the outcome in silent awe.  Then came the decision, spoken with heavenly authority:  \"Ye valiant and loyal sons and daughters of God, blessed are ye for your righteousness and your faithfulness to God and His cause. Your reward is that ye shall be permitted to dwell on the new earth, and in tabernacles of flesh continue in the eternal course of progress, as has been marked out and explained to you.\"  Then, to the still defiant forms of Lucifer and his adherents this was said:  \"Lucifer, son of the morning, thou hast withdrawn from the Father many of the children of heaven. They have their agency, and have chosen to believe thy lies. They have fallen with thee from before the face of God. Thus hast thou used the power given thee. Thou hast said in thy heart, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God.... I will be like the Most High! Thou hast sought to usurp power, to take a kingdom that does not belong to thee. God holds you all as in the hollow of His hand; yet He has not restrained thine agency. He has been patient and longsuffering with you. Rebellious children of heaven, the Father's bosom heaves with sorrow for you; but justice claims its own--your punishment is that you be cast out of heaven. Bodies of flesh and bones ye shall not have; but ye shall wander without tabernacles over the face of the earth. Ye shall be 'reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.'\"  Thus went forth the decree of the Almighty, and with it the force of His power. Lucifer and many of the hosts of heaven were cast down. The whole realm was thrilled with the power of God. The celestial elements were stirred to their depths. Heaven wept over the fallen spirits, and the cry went out, \"Lo, lo, he is fallen, even the Son of the Morning.\"     III.    \"For thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.\"--_John   17:24._   There was a calm in heaven like unto that of a summer morning after a night of storm.  Throughout the whole strife, the dark clouds of evil had been gathering. In the fierce struggle, the spirits of heaven had been storm-tossed as on two contending waves; but when Lucifer and his forces were cast out, the atmosphere became purged of its uncleanness, and a sweet peace brooded over all. Save for sorrow for the lost ones, nothing marred the perfect joy of heaven. All now looked forward to the consummation of that plan whereby they would become inhabitants of another world, fitted for their school of experience in the flesh. All prepared themselves with this end in view.  None was more grateful to his Father than Homan. In the midst of the strife, he had done what he could for what he thought was right. All his influence had been used with the wavering ones, and many were those who owed him a debt of gratitude. But his greatest reward was in the peace which dwelt within him and the joy with which he was greeted by all who knew him.  Through it all, Homan's thoughts had often been with the fair sister Delsa; and often he had sought her and talked with her. It pleased him greatly to see the earnestness and energy with which she defended the cause of the Father. He was drawn to her more than to the many others who were equally valiant. As he thought of it, its strangeness occurred to him. Why should it be so? He did not know. Delsa was fair; so were all the daughters of God. She had attained to great intelligence; so had thousands of others. Then wherein lay the secret of the power which drew him to her?  The vastness of the spiritual world held enough for study, research, and for occupation. None needed to be idle, for there were duties to be performed, as much here as in any other sphere of action. In the Father's house are many mansions.  In the one where Delsa lived, she and Homan sat in earnest conversation. Through the opening leading to the garden appeared the stately form of Sardus. Homan sprang to meet him and greeted him joyously:  \"Welcome, Brother Sardus, welcome!\"  Delsa arose.  \"This is Brother Sardus,\" said Homan, \"and this is Sister Delsa.\"  \"Welcome, brother,\" said she. \"Come and sit with us.\"  \"Sardus,\" continued Homan, \"I thought you lost. I have not met you for a long time. You remember our last conversation? Sardus, what joy to know that you are on the safe side, that you did not fall with Lucifer--\"  \"S--h, that name. Dear brother, he tempted me sorely, but I overcame him.\"  \"But we are shortly to meet him on new ground,\" continued Homan. \"As seducing spirits, he and his followers will still fight against the anointed Son. They will not yield. Not obtaining bodies themselves, they will seek to operate through those of others.\"  \"Now we know how temptation and sin will come into the world,\" said Delsa. \"God grant that we may overcome these dangers again, as we once have done.\"  They conversed for some time; then Sardus departed to perform some duty.  \"I, too, must go,\" said Delsa. \"A company of sisters is soon to leave for earth, and I am going to say farewell to them.\"  \"Delsa, you do not go with them? You are not leaving me?\"  \"No, Homan, my time is not yet.\"  \"May we not go together?--but there--that is as Father wills. He will ordain for the best. There are nations yet to go to the earth, and we shall have our allotted time and place.\"         *       *       *       *       *  A group of persons was engaged in earnest conversation, when a messenger approached. He raised his hand for silence, and then announced:  \"I come from the Father on an errand to you.\"  The company gave him close attention, and he continued: \"It is pertaining to some of our brothers and sisters who have gone before us into earth-life. I shall have to tell you about them so that you may understand. A certain family of earth-children has fallen into evil ways. Not being very strong for the truth before they left us, their experiences in the other world have not made them stronger. This family, it seems, has become rooted in false doctrine and wrong living, so that those who come to them from us partake also of their error and unbelief of the truth. As you know, kinship and environment are powerful agencies in forming character, and it appears that none of the Father's children have so far been able to withstand the tendency to wrong which is exerted on all who come to this family.\"  The messenger paused and looked around on the listening group. Then he continued: \"The Father bids me ask if any of you are willing to go in earth-life to this family, become kin to those weak-hearted ones--for their salvation.\"  There was a long pause as if all were considering the proposition. The messenger waited.  \"Brother,\" asked one, \"is there not danger that he who goes on this mission might himself come under the influence you speak of to such an extent that he also would be lost to the good, and thus make a failure of his mission?\"  \"In the earth-life, as here,\" replied the messenger, \"all have their agency. It is, therefore, possible that those who take upon themselves this mission--for there must be two, male and female--to give way to the power of evil, and thus fail in their errand. But, consider this: the Father has sent me to you. He knows you, your hearts, your faithfulness, your strength. He knows whom He is asking to go into danger for the sake of saving souls. Yes, friends, the Father knows, and this ought to be enough for you.\"  The listeners bowed their heads as if ashamed of the doubting, fearful thought. Then in the stillness, one spoke as if to herself: \"To be a savior,--to share in the work of our Elder Brother! O, think of it!\" Then the speaker raised her head quickly. \"May I go, may I?\" she questioned eagerly.  \"And I,\" \"and I,\" came from others.  \"Sister, you will do for one,\" said the messenger to her who had first spoken. \"And now, we need a brother--yes, you, brother, will do.\" This to one who was pressing forward, asking to be chosen.  \"Yes, yes,\" continued the messenger, as he smiled his pleasure on the company, \"I see that the Father knows you all.\"  \"But,\" faltered the sister who had been chosen, \"what are we to do? May we not know?\"  \"Not wholly,\" was the reply. \"Do you not remember what you have been taught, that a veil is drawn over the eyes of all who enter mortality, and the memory of this world is taken away; but this I may tell you, that by the power of your spiritual insight and moral strength you will be able to exert a correcting influence over your brothers and sisters in the flesh, and especially over those of your kin. Then again, when you hear the gospel of our Elder Brother preached, it will have a familiar sound to you and you will receive it gladly. Then you will become teachers to your households and a light unto your families. Again, not only to those in the flesh will you minister. Many will have passed from earth-life in ignorance of the gospel of salvation when you come. These must have the saving ordinances of the gospel"]]]
