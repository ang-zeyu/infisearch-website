Well, anyone. You just one day decide that you need to clean out the basement, you put an ad in the _Star_, tape up a few signs, and voila, yard sale. Sometimes, a school or a church will get donations of old junk and sell it all at one time, as a fundraiser.\"  \"And how do you locate these?\" he asked, bobbing up and down slightly with excitement.  \"Well, there're amateurs who just read the ads in the weekend papers, or just pick a neighbourhood and wander around, but that's no way to go about it. What I do is, I get in a truck, and I sniff the air, catch the scent of crap and _vroom!_, I'm off like a bloodhound on a trail. You learn things over time: like stay away from Yuppie yard sales, they never have anything worth buying, just the same crap you can buy in any mall.\"  \"Do you think I might accompany you some day?\"  \"Hell, sure. Next Saturday? We'll head over to Cabbagetown -- those old coach houses, you'd be amazed what people get rid of. It's practically criminal.\"  \"I would like to go with you on next Saturday very much Mr Jerry Abington.\" He used to talk like that, without commas or question marks. Later, he got better, but then, it was all one big sentence.  \"Call me Jerry. It's a date, then. Tell you what, though: there's a Code you got to learn before we go out. The Craphound's Code.\"  \"What is a craphound?\"  \"You're lookin' at one. You're one, too, unless I miss my guess. You'll get to know some of the local craphounds, you hang around with me long enough. They're the competition, but they're also your buddies, and there're certain rules we have.\"  And then I explained to him all about how you never bid against a craphound at a yard-sale, how you get to know the other fellows' tastes, and when you see something they might like, you haul it out for them, and they'll do the same for you, and how you never buy something that another craphound might be looking for, if all you're buying it for is to sell it back to him. Just good form and common sense, really, but you'd be surprised how many amateurs just fail to make the jump to pro because they can't grasp it.  #  There was a bunch of other stuff at the auction, other craphounds' weekend treasures. This was high season, when the sun comes out and people start to clean out the cottage, the basement, the garage. There were some collectors in the crowd, and a whole whack of antique and junk dealers, and a few pickers, and me, and Craphound. I watched the bidding listlessly, waiting for my things to come up and sneaking out for smokes between lots. Craphound never once looked at me or acknowledged my presence, and I became perversely obsessed with catching his eye, so I coughed and shifted and walked past him several times, until the auctioneer glared at me, and one of the attendants asked if I needed a throat lozenge.  My lot came up. The bowling glasses went for five bucks to one of the Queen Street junk dealers; the elephant-foot fetched $350 after a spirited bidding war between an antique dealer and a collector -- the collector won; the dealer took the top-hat for $100. The rest of it came up and sold, or didn't, and at end of the lot, I'd made over $800, which was rent for the month plus beer for the weekend plus gas for the truck.  Craphound bid on and bought more cowboy things -- a box of super-eight cowboy movies, the boxes mouldy, the stock itself running to slime; a Navajo blanket; a plastic donkey that dispensed cigarettes out of its ass; a big neon armadillo sign.  One of the other nice things about that place over Sotheby's, there was none of this waiting thirty days to get a cheque. I queued up with the other pickers after the bidding was through, collected a wad of bills, and headed for my truck.  I spotted Craphound loading his haul into a minivan with handicapped plates. It looked like some kind of fungus was growing over the hood and side-panels. On closer inspection, I saw that the body had been covered in closely glued Lego.  Craphound popped the hatchback and threw his gear in, then opened the driver's side door, and I saw that his van had been fitted out for a legless driver, with brake and accelerator levers. A paraplegic I knew drove one just like it. Craphound's exoskeleton levered him into the seat, and I watched the eerily precise way it executed the macro that started the car, pulled the shoulder-belt, put it into drive and switched on the stereo. I heard tape-hiss, then, loud as a b-boy cruising Yonge Street, an old-timey cowboy voice: \"Howdy pardners! Saddle up, we're ridin'!\" Then the van backed up and sped out of the lot.  I get into the truck and drove home. Truth be told, I missed the little bastard.  #  Some people said that we should have run Craphound and his kin off the planet, out of the Solar System. They said that it wasn't fair for the aliens to keep us in the dark about their technologies. They say that we should have captured a ship and reverse-engineered it, built our own and kicked ass.  Some people!  First of all, nobody with human DNA could survive a trip in one of those ships. They're part of Craphound's people's bodies, as I understand it, and we just don't have the right parts. Second of all, they _were_ sharing their tech with us -- they just weren't giving it away. Fair trades every time.  It's not as if space was off-limits to us. We can any one of us visit their homeworld, just as soon as we figure out how. Only they wouldn't hold our hands along the way.  #  I spent the week haunting the \"Secret Boutique,\" AKA the Goodwill As-Is Centre on Jarvis. It's all there is to do between yard sales, and sometimes it makes for good finds. Part of my theory of yard-sale karma holds that if I miss one day at the thrift shops, that'll be the day they put out the big score. So I hit the stores diligently and came up with crapola. I had offended the fates, I knew, and wouldn't make another score until I placated them. It was lonely work, still and all, and I missed Craphound's good eye and obsessive delight.  I was at the cash-register with a few items at the Goodwill when a guy in a suit behind me tapped me on the shoulder.  \"Sorry to bother you,\" he said. His suit looked expensive, as did his manicure and his haircut and his wire-rimmed glasses. \"I was just wondering where you found that.\" He gestured at a rhinestone-studded ukelele, with a cowboy hat wood-burned into the body. I had picked it up with a guilty little thrill, thinking that Craphound might buy it at the next auction.  \"Second floor, in the toy section.\"  \"There wasn't anything else like it, was there?\"  \"'Fraid not,\" I said, and the cashier picked it up and started wrapping it in newspaper.  \"Ah,\" he said, and he looked like a little kid who'd just been told that he couldn't have a puppy. \"I don't suppose you'd want to sell it, would you?\"  I held up a hand and waited while the cashier bagged it with the rest of my stuff, a few old clothbound novels I thought I could sell at a used book-store, and a Grease belt-buckle with Olivia Newton John on it. I led him out the door by the elbow of his expensive suit.  \"How much?\" I had paid a dollar.  \"Ten bucks?\"  I nearly said, \"Sold!\" but I caught myself. \"Twenty.\"  \"Twenty dollars?\"  \"That's what they'd charge at a boutique on Queen Street.\"  He took out a slim leather wallet and produced a twenty. I handed him the uke. His face lit up like a lightbulb.  #  It's not that my adulthood is particularly unhappy. Likewise, it's not that my childhood was particularly happy.  There are memories I have, though, that are like a cool drink of water. My grandfather's place near Milton, an old Victorian farmhouse, where the cat drank out of a milk-glass bowl; and where we sat around a rough pine table as big as my whole apartment; and where my playroom was the draughty barn with hay-filled lofts bulging with farm junk and Tarzan-ropes.  There was Grampa's friend Fyodor, and we spent every evening at his wrecking-yard, he and Grampa talking and smoking while I scampered in the twilight, scaling mountains of auto-junk. The glove-boxes yielded treasures: crumpled photos of college boys mugging in front of signs, roadmaps of far-away places. I found a guidebook from the 1964 New York World's Fair once, and a lipstick like a chrome bullet, and a pair of white leather ladies' gloves.  Fyodor dealt in scrap, too, and once, he had half of a carny carousel, a few horses and part of the canopy, paint flaking and sharp torn edges protruding; next to it, a Korean-war tank minus its turret and treads, and inside the tank were peeling old pinup girls and a rotation schedule and a crude Kilroy. The control-room in the middle of the carousel had a stack of paperback sci-fi novels, Ace Doubles that had two books bound back-to-back, and when you finished the first, you turned it over and read the other. Fyodor let me keep them, and there was a pawn-ticket in one from Macon, Georgia, for a transistor radio.  My parents started leaving me alone when I was fourteen and I couldn't keep from sneaking into their room and snooping. Mom's jewelry box had books of matches from their honeymoon in Acapulco, printed with bad palm-trees. My Dad kept an old photo in his sock drawer, of himself on muscle-beach, shirtless, flexing his biceps.  My grandmother saved every scrap of my mother's life in her basement, in dusty Army trunks. I entertained myself by pulling it out and taking it in: her Mouse Ears from the big family train-trip to Disneyland in '57, and her records, and the glittery pasteboard sign from her sweet sixteen. There were well-chewed stuffed animals, and school exercise books in which she'd practiced variations on her signature for page after page.  It all told a story. The penciled Kilroy in the tank made me see one of those Canadian soldiers in Korea, unshaven and crew-cut like an extra on M*A*S*H, sitting for bored"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17026"],["title","Craphound (#4)"],["body"," after hour, staring at the pinup girls, fiddling with a crossword, finally laying it down and sketching his Kilroy quickly, before anyone saw.  The photo of my Dad posing sent me whirling through time to Toronto's Muscle Beach in the east end, and hearing the tinny AM radios playing weird psychedelic rock while teenagers lounged on their Mustangs and the girls sunbathed in bikinis that made their tits into torpedoes.  It all made poems. The old pulp novels and the pawn ticket, when I spread them out in front of the TV, and arranged them just so, they made up a poem that took my breath away.  #  After the cowboy trunk episode, I didn't run into Craphound again until the annual Rotary Club charity rummage sale at the Upper Canada Brewing Company. He was wearing the cowboy hat, sixguns and the silver star from the cowboy trunk. It should have looked ridiculous, but the net effect was naive and somehow charming, like he was a little boy whose hair you wanted to muss.  I found a box of nice old melamine dishes, in various shades of green -- four square plates, bowls, salad-plates, and a serving tray. I threw them in the duffel-bag I'd brought and kept browsing, ignoring Craphound as he charmed a salty old Rotarian while fondling a box of leather-bound books.  I browsed a stack of old Ministry of Labour licenses -- barber, chiropodist, bartender, watchmaker. They all had pretty seals and were framed in stark green institutional metal. They all had different names, but all from one family, and I made up a little story to entertain myself, about the proud mother saving her sons' accreditations and framing hanging them in the spare room with their diplomas. \"Oh, George Junior's just opened his own barbershop, and little Jimmy's still fixing watches. . .\"  I bought them.  In a box of crappy plastic Little Ponies and Barbies and Care Bears, I found a leather Indian headdress, a wooden bow-and-arrow set, and a fringed buckskin vest. Craphound was still buttering up the leather books' owner. I bought them quick, for five bucks.  \"Those are beautiful,\" a voice said at my elbow. I turned around and smiled at the snappy dresser who'd bought the uke at the Secret Boutique. He'd gone casual for the weekend, in an expensive, L.L. Bean button-down way.  \"Aren't they, though.\"  \"You sell them on Queen Street? Your finds, I mean?\"  \"Sometimes. Sometimes at auction. How's the uke?\"  \"Oh, I got it all tuned up,\" he said, and smiled the same smile he'd given me when he'd taken hold of it at Goodwill. \"I can play 'Don't Fence Me In' on it.\" He looked at his feet. \"Silly, huh?\"  \"Not at all. You're into cowboy things, huh?\" As I said it, I was overcome with the knowledge that this was \"Billy the Kid,\" the original owner of the cowboy trunk. I don't know why I felt that way, but I did, with utter certainty.  \"Just trying to re-live a piece of my childhood, I guess. I'm Scott,\" he said, extending his hand.  _Scott?_ I thought wildly. _Maybe it's his middle name?_ \"I'm Jerry.\"  The Upper Canada Brewery sale has many things going for it, including a beer garden where you can sample their wares and get a good BBQ burger. We gently gravitated to it, looking over the tables as we went.  \"You're a pro, right?\" he asked after we had plastic cups of beer.  \"You could say that.\"  \"I'm an amateur. A rank amateur. Any words of wisdom?\"  I laughed and drank some beer, lit a cigarette. \"There's no secret to it, I think. Just diligence: you've got to go out every chance you get, or you'll miss the big score.\"  He chuckled. \"I hear that. Sometimes, I'll be sitting in my office, and I'll just _know_ that they're putting out a piece of pure gold at the Goodwill and that someone else will get to it before my lunch. I get so wound up, I'm no good until I go down there and hunt for it. I guess I'm hooked, eh?\"  \"Cheaper than some other kinds of addictions.\"  \"I guess so. About that Indian stuff -- what do you figure you'd get for it at a Queen Street boutique?\"  I looked him in the eye. He may have been something high-powered and cool and collected in his natural environment, but just then, he was as eager and nervous as a kitchen-table poker-player at a high-stakes game.  \"Maybe fifty bucks,\" I said.  \"Fifty, huh?\" he asked.  \"About that,\" I said.  \"Once it sold,\" he said.  \"There is that,\" I said.  \"Might take a month, might take a year,\" he said.  \"Might take a day,\" I said.  \"It might, it might.\" He finished his beer. \"I don't suppose you'd take forty?\"  I'd paid five for it, not ten minutes before. It looked like it would fit Craphound, who, after all, was wearing Scott/Billy's own boyhood treasures as we spoke. You don't make a living by feeling guilty over eight hundred percent markups. Still, I'd angered the fates, and needed to redeem myself.  \"Make it five,\" I said.  He started to say something, then closed his mouth and gave me a look of thanks. He took a five out of his wallet and handed it to me. I pulled the vest and bow and headdress out my duffel.  He walked back to a shiny black Jeep with gold detail work, parked next to Craphound's van. Craphound was building onto the Lego body, and the hood had a miniature Lego town attached to it.  Craphound looked around as he passed, and leaned forward with undisguised interest at the booty. I grimaced and finished my beer.  #  I met Scott/Billy three times more at the Secret Boutique that week.  He was a lawyer, who specialised in alien-technology patents. He had a practice on Bay Street, with two partners, and despite his youth, he was the senior man.  I didn't let on that I knew about Billy the Kid and his mother in the East Muskoka Volunteer Fire Department Ladies' Auxiliary. But I felt a bond with him, as though we shared an unspoken secret. I pulled any cowboy finds for him, and he developed a pretty good eye for what I was after and returned the favour.  The fates were with me again, and no two ways about it. I took home a ratty old Oriental rug that on closer inspection was a 19th century hand-knotted Persian; an upholstered Turkish footstool; a collection of hand-painted silk Hawaiiana pillows and a carved Meerschaum pipe. Scott/Billy found the last for me, and it cost me two dollars. I knew a collector who would pay thirty in an eye-blink, and from then on, as far as I was concerned, Scott/Billy was a fellow craphound.  \"You going to the auction tomorrow night?\" I asked him at the checkout line.  \"Wouldn't miss it,\" he said. He'd barely been able to contain his excitement when I told him about the Thursday night auctions and the bargains to be had there. He sure had the bug.  \"Want to get together for dinner beforehand? The Rotterdam's got a good patio.\"  He did, and we did, and I had a glass of framboise that packed a hell of a kick and tasted like fizzy raspberry lemonade; and doorstopper fries and a club sandwich.  I had my nose in my glass when he kicked my ankle under the table. \"Look at that!\"  It was Craphound in his van, cruising for a parking spot. The Lego village had been joined by a whole postmodern spaceport on the roof, with a red-and-blue castle, a football-sized flying saucer, and a clown's head with blinking eyes.  I went back to my drink and tried to get my appetite back.  \"Was that an extee driving?\"  \"Yeah. Used to be a friend of mine.\"  \"He's a picker?\"  \"Uh-huh.\" I turned back to my fries and tried to kill the subject.  \"Do you know how he made his stake?\"  \"The chlorophyll thing, in Saudi Arabia.\"  \"Sweet!\" he said. \"Very sweet. I've got a client who's got some secondary patents from that one. What's he go after?\"  \"Oh, pretty much everything,\" I said, resigning myself to discussing the topic after all. \"But lately, the same as you -- cowboys and Injuns.\"  He laughed and smacked his knee. \"Well, what do you know? What could he possibly want with the stuff?\"  \"What do they want with any of it? He got started one day when we were cruising the Muskokas,\" I said carefully, watching his face. \"Found a trunk of old cowboy things at a rummage sale. East Muskoka Volunteer Fire Department Ladies' Auxiliary.\" I waited for him to shout or startle. He didn't.  \"Yeah? A good find, I guess. Wish I'd made it.\"  I didn't know what to say to that, so I took a bite of my sandwich.  Scott continued. \"I think about what they get out of it a lot. There's nothing we have here that they couldn't make for themselves. I mean, if they picked up and left today, we'd still be making sense of everything they gave us in a hundred years. You know, I just closed a deal for a biochemical computer that's no-shit 10,000 times faster than anything we've built out of silicon. You know what the extee took in trade? Title to a defunct fairground outside of Calgary -- they shut it down ten years ago because the midway was too unsafe to ride. Doesn't that beat all? This thing is worth a billion dollars right out of the gate, I mean, within twenty-four hours of the deal closing, the seller can turn it into the GDP of Bolivia. For a crummy real-estate dog that you couldn't get five grand for!\"  It always shocked me when Billy/Scott talked about his job -- it was easy to forget that he was a high-powered lawyer when we were jawing and fooling around like old craphounds. I wondered if maybe he _wasn't_ Billy the Kid; I couldn't think of any reason for him to be playing it all so close to his chest.  \"What the hell is some extee going to do with a fairground?\"  #  Craphound got a free Coke from Lisa at the check-in when he made his appearance. He bid high, but shrewdly, and never pulled ten-thousand-dollar stunts. The bidders were wandering the floor, previewing that week's stock, and making notes to themselves.  I rooted through a box-lot full of old tins, and found one with a buckaroo at the Calgary Stampede, riding a bucking bronc. I picked it up and stood to inspect it. Craphound was behind me.  \"Nice piece, huh?\" I said to him.  \"I like it very much,\" Craphound said, and I felt my cheeks flush.  \"You're"]]]
