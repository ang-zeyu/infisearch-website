Here is our first practical thought for this Lent.  Watch yourself and your life, especially in those particulars in which you know that you have been getting out of hand. The prayers omitted, curtailed, said carelessly, said or attempted in bed, instead of on your knees: what a grievous failure, isn't it?  The carelessness about preparation before and thanksgiving after Communion, the irregularity of your attendances; the habit of Self-Examination, or of Confession, dropped--why? The Bible neglected.  Then the self-indulgences in the matter of sleep, food, drink, and purely wasted hours.  All these things are sapping the manhood and dignity of the will. Sometimes even more dangerously and insidiously than open sins, because with regard to these conscience does speak; but when we are merely drifting down the stream of time, the pleasant lapping of the ripples on the side of the bark lulls conscience into fatal sleep.  Look at your life, ask yourself the question, boldly and honestly, what is the principle upon which it is being lived, God or self? When the answer comes you will see clearly the first steps to take in the disciplining of the will.  Glorious examples of what can be done abound around you. Think you there has been no struggle on the part of those tens of thousands who have given up comforts, home, prospects, harmless pleasures, in exchange for the ghastly miseries of the trenches, the appalling risks by land, on or beneath the sea, in the air, all at the call of a stern, compelling duty, which told them that the life really worth living was the one spent, laid down if need be, for King and country?  Think too of the heroism of the wives, the mothers, the sweethearts, on whose lips there must have trembled over and again, \"I will not, I cannot let you go.\" Yet the will was disciplined, the words remained unspoken, the tears were shed in secret, and these brave hearts, even in breaking, shall find their reward.  It was at Waterloo one afternoon, a young officer was being seen off for the front by father, brother, and _fiancée_. The two former bravely and cheerily said their good-bye, and withdrew a little to leave the young couple for their farewell; a kiss, a close embrace, outward smiles, but tears very near the eyes; and then as the officer got into the carriage just this one remark: \"It's precious hard upon the women.\" What a world of meaning there was in that.  Above all, as your pattern and your power, look to Him Who said, \"I came down from Heaven not to do mine own will but the will of Him that sent Me.\"  _For suggested meditations during the week, see Appendix._     II  =The Discipline of the Body=  FIRST SUNDAY IN LENT  1 Cor. ix. 27    \"I buffet my body, and bring it into bondage.\"   On Ash Wednesday we were considering some purely subjective realities, such as principles, motives, will--things we could not see. To-day we think about a very objective substance, ever present to our senses--our body. A man may deny point blank the existence of his soul--using the word in its ordinary acceptation--he cannot say, \"I have not got a body.\" Even if he should conceive of that body as a mere bundle of ideas, an accumulation of sensations, yet there it is, making itself felt in countless ways.  So intimately bound up is it with every part of our life, apparently so infinitely the most real part of us, that we often think of it as being our true self. Yet every cell and fibre of it changes in the course of seven years. Therefore in itself it cannot maintain our identity. Have you ever pinched your nail, right down at its base, and watched the dark mass of congealed blood making its way to the tip of the finger, and then dispersing? This gives you some idea of the pace at which the body is being burned up and renewed.  All the while the personal \"I\" remains, deep-seated in the self-conscious intellect, memory, will.  Of course the body plays an immensely important part in the complex story of our existence. It is the machine by which the personal self acts, speaks, loves, hates, chooses, refuses; therefore we can neither ignore it nor despise it.  The popular notion concerning religion is that it is meant only for the salvation of the soul. If this were so, then the coming of the Holy Ghost would have sufficed for all needs.  One manifest purpose of the Incarnation was to give to the body the possibility of holiness here, resurrection hereafter.  Very marvellous is the dignity conferred upon the body by the fact the \"Word was made flesh.\" From that flows forth the high position of the Christian, whose body is a \"temple of the Holy Ghost.\"  It is through the body that we receive the Sacraments, which are means of grace to the soul.  Did time permit, it would be deeply interesting to trace out the use of the word body in this connection--the natural body of our Lord, His spiritual body after the Resurrection, His mystical body, the Church, in which sense He Himself is called \"the Saviour of the body\" (Eph. v. 23), His Sacramental Body, of which He says, \"This is my body.\"  The discipline of the body.  The thought is prominently before us at the present moment, and first let us look at it from its purely material side. Thousands of youths who a few months ago were slouching, narrow-chested, feeble specimens of underbred humanity, have now-expanded into well set up, hardened men. The body has been disciplined by drill, exercises, route-marching, and the like. Those who return from the war uninjured will, we may hope, be in such improved condition as may somewhat compensate for the terrible loss of vigorous life which is taking place.  Had there been universal military training of the youth of our land for the past few generations, either the present war would never have taken place; or the results of the first three weeks of it would have been vastly different from what they were.  Now take another significant fact: letter after letter from the front says, \"We are all very fit.\" The average \"fitness\" in the trenches is, broadly speaking, higher than that of training camps at home, especially of those where little or no supervision is exercised as to strong drink. How plainly this shows that hardness, even of an extreme character, braces up the body; softness and self-indulgence enfeeble it.  S. Paul affords a wonderful illustration of this; obviously a man of very delicate health, frequently ill (probably this was the thorn in the flesh), yet accomplishing vast labours, and, in addition, buffeting his own flesh lest it should get the upper hand.  Here, then, we reach the first great principle in the discipline of the body. It must not have its own way, or it will infallibly assert its sway over the man's real self.  That is what happens in the case of the habitual drunkard or the slave of lust. That which at first is a temptation, perfectly capable of being resisted, becomes at last what the doctors call a \"physical\" craving that, humanly speaking, cannot be overcome. By constant yielding the will has been weakened to such an extent that the personal \"I\" no longer reigns; the usurping body has taken its place and rules supreme.  Let us take the main thought of self-control, which is the true rendering of the word temperance, the state in which, as S. James says, the man is \"able to bridle the whole body\" (S. James iii. 2), and test ourselves by it this Lent. Am I retaining my dominion over my body, or is it gradually pushing itself into my place?  Self-examination, honestly performed, will reveal this at once, for conscience, unless blunted by neglect, will speak infallibly.  For instance, when you find some indulgence of the flesh concerning which you say \"I can't help it,\" there your body has vanquished you. It is absorbing your personality, robbing you of your divine birthright, in which you say, \"I will,\" \"I will not.\"  And now to go a step further--the disciplining of the body, care in regard to eating, drinking, amusements, and the like; strictness as to luxuries and things which, though lawful, may not be expedient, not only tend to bodily strength and mere physical well-being, but brace up the will power, because they entail the constant exercise of it.  Here is where the practical wisdom of the Church comes in as regards fasting. One day in every week is set apart, beside other days and seasons, as a reminder of the fact that fasting is a duty of the Christian life, just as much as almsgiving and prayer--a duty sanctified by the example enjoined by the precept of our Lord Himself.  True, no hard and fast rules are laid down, but a little sanctified common sense will dictate to us how to make fast-days a reality, by some simple acts of self-denial.  Our last thought is one of intense practical importance--our attitude at the present moment towards strong drink.  Lord Kitchener and the Archbishop of Canterbury have both on several occasions called the attention of the nation to the terrible evils arising from the unhappy custom of treating soldiers to strong drink.  _Punch_, always on the side of morality and rightness, has dealt with it in the following trenchant fashion:--   TO A FALSE PATRIOT     He came obedient to the Call;     He might have shirked, like half his mates   Who, while their comrades fight and fall,     Still go to swell the football gates.    And you, a patriot in your prime,     You waved a flag above his head,   And hoped he'd have a high old time,     And slapped him on the back, and said:    \"You'll show 'em what we British are!     Give us your hand, old pal, to shake\";   And took him round from bar to bar     And made him drunk--for England's sake.    That's how you helped him. Yesterday     Clear-eyed and earnest, keen and hard,   He held himself the soldier's way--     And now they've got him under guard.    That doesn't hurt you; you're all right;     Your easy conscience"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16979"],["title","The Discipline of War (#2)"],["body","no blame;   But he, poor boy, with morning's light,     He eats his heart out, sick with shame.    What's that to you? You understand     Nothing of all his bitter pain;   You have no regiment to brand;     You have no uniform to stain;    No vow of service to abuse;     No pledge to King and country due;   But he has something dear to lose,     And he has lost it--thanks to you.[1]   [Footnote 1: O.S. in _Punch_, November 4th, 1914. By kind permission of the Proprietors.]  A man who had so distinguished himself at the front as to be mentioned in a despatch came home slightly wounded. In less than twenty-four hours he was in a cell at a police station, and the next day fined forty shillings. Oh! the pathetic pity of it. That man got into trouble through the exhibition of one of the purest and best features of our human nature, the desire to show kindness. In their well-intentioned ignorance this man's friends--yes, they were real friends--knew of only one way of displaying friendliness--they gave him liquor.  I am not going to blame them, nor him entirely; I am going to lay some of the fault upon ourselves.  Since the beginning of the last century the habits of the upper classes, to use a generic though unpleasant term, have improved immeasurably. Then excess was more or less the rule among men of good position, was to a certain extent expected and provided for; witness _The School for Scandal_, or the leading novels of the period. Now, the man who disgraces himself at a dinner-table is never invited again.  And even as we go down in the social scale much improvement is apparent. Those who remember Bank Holidays on their first introduction will recollect that the excess of the working classes was quite open and shameless; but to-day some effort is generally made by the victims, or their friends, to hide the disgrace, because Public Opinion is improving. That is where we come in.  Many causes of intemperance in strong drink are matters for legislative or municipal action; for example, overcrowding, insanitary dwellings or surroundings, sweating, excessive hours of labour, adulteration of liquors. But there are two factors upon which we can exercise direct influence, because they are connected with that great corporate entity called Public Opinion.  First let us take the one upon which we have already touched--the notion that friendliness and good fellowship are essentially connected with strong drink. This is at the bottom of those terrible scenes when troops are leaving our great London railway stations. Scenes so inexpressibly sad to all thinking people.  Everyone who abstains entirely, or who takes the khaki button--a pledge not to treat nor be treated to strong drink during the continuance of the war--is helping to knock a nail into the coffin of one of the silliest and most fatal delusions that has ever wrought havoc to body, soul, and spirit.  And then there is that other weird notion that you cannot be really strong and healthy without stimulant. For you the glass of beer or wine may be a mere harmless luxury, in the way in which you take it. I purposely exclude spirits, which I am fanatic enough to think should only be used medicinally. But every individual total abstainer helps to swell the testimony not only to the non-necessity of alcohol, but to the fact that, according to the view of a large part of the medical profession, the human frame is better without it.  You may say, \"What good will my abstinence do to people with whom I never come in contact?\" Tell me what influence really is; how it spreads, by what unseen modes it ramifies and extends.  Tell me the real significance, the true spiritual value, of the fact that \"if one member suffer, all the members suffer with it: if one member rejoice, all the members rejoice with it.\"  Then perhaps you can explain in some way, how your abstinence shall spread to desolated homes, to stricken lives, in crowded slums or quiet villages, in fire-raked trenches or storm-tossed ships.  No act of self-sacrifice for His sake, Who though He was rich yet for our sakes became poor, ever went without its rich reward.  No tiny wave of influence ever yet sped forth from a Christian heart, but what reached its mark and wrought its work of beneficent power.  _For suggested meditations during the week, see Appendix._     III  =The Discipline of the Soul=  SECOND SUNDAY IN LENT  St. John vi. 38    \"For I am come down from Heaven, not to do Mine own will, but   the will of Him that sent Me.\"   To-day we are going to speak of the soul not in its popular sense, as set over against the body, but in the scriptural meaning of the word as the broad equivalent of life.  To enter upon a philosophical discussion might prove interesting from a merely academic point of view, but would be eminently unpractical. Suffice it to say that when S. Paul speaks of the \"body, soul and spirit\" (1 Thess. v. 23), he takes the two latter as different faculties of the invisible part of man.  Soul ([Greek: psychê]) is the lower attribute which man has in common with the animals; spirit ([Greek: pneuma]) the higher one which they do not possess, and which makes man capable of religion.  In this sense, then, the soul would mean the life the man or woman is leading, in the home, the business, the pleasures, the relaxations, as distinct from the definite exercise of devotion or worship.  Of course it is absolutely impossible to draw a hard and fast line between sacred and secular. All secular affairs, rightly conducted, have their sacred side; and conversely all sacred matters have their secular side, for they form part of the life the man is living \"in the age.\"  It is the neglect of this truth which is responsible for much of the moral and religious failure of the day.  Business is secular, prayer is sacred, and so they have no practical connection each with other.  Amusement is secular (often vastly too much so, in the very lowest sense of the word); Holy Communion is sacred; therefore there is no link between them. Whereas the prayer and the Communion should be the ennobling and sanctifying power alike of work and play.  Bearing this caution in mind, we shall to-day look at certain features of the so-called secular life of the day in which discipline needs to be strongly exercised.  No doubt about it, the soul of the nation has been growing sick, sick \"nigh unto death.\"  Luxury has been increasing with giant strides; the mad race for pleasure has helped to empty our Churches, to rob our Charities, to diminish the number of our Candidates for Holy Orders, to make countless ears deaf to the call which the country, through that magnificent Christian soldier, Lord Roberts, and many others, has been making to manhood of the land. Week-ending, meals in restaurants, turning night into day, have robbed home-life of its grace and power, and produced a generation of young folk _blasé_ and discontented before they are out of girlhood and boyhood.  With this has come, inevitably, the loss of sense of responsibility. So long as I can enjoy myself and get my own way, why should I vex myself with the outworn question, \"Am I my brother's keeper?\" No! That has gone into the limbo of effete superstition.  And further, loss of the sense of proportion. There are some to whom it causes no moral shock to wear a dress costing a hundred guineas, while a vast number of seamstresses, shirtmakers, artificial flower makers, boot-closers, and the like, are working seventy hours for 5s. to 8s. a week. One mantle-presser, in Dalston, receives 1/2_d._ per mantle; she is most respectable, has four children, and earns from 5_s._ 6_d._ to 7_s._ a week!  We do not grumble at the hundred guineas being spent upon the dress, or a thousand guineas even, if the money went in due proportion all round to supply the _full living wage to each one engaged in its production_: and if the wearer interested herself keenly in social problems, and used her means wisely and well to afford relief where it was needed. This, alas! does not happen when the sense of proportion is lacking.  Take another case--alas! a fearfully common one. Men and women will gamble recklessly at Bridge, lose heavily, pay up, at whatever cost, because it is _a debt of honour_. All the while a hard-pressed tailor, a famished dressmaker and her children are kept out of their money, because it is only _a debt of commerce_. Could there be a more ghastly parody on the word honour?  Yet once more--the lack of seriousness. By seriousness we do not mean gloominess, nor withdrawal from society, or anything of the kind. We mean the flippant attitude towards life, the lack of serious, sustained interest in literature, in music, in art, in the legitimate drama; witness the theatres being turned into cinema shows, and the terrible paucity of sound, strong plays. Everything must be scrappy, light, and if a little (or more than a little) risky, so much the better.  We do not for a moment say that these evils are universal, God forbid, but none can deny that they have eaten deep into a large part of society, using the word in its broadest, not in its technical sense.  The soul of the nation needed discipline, and it has come suddenly, sharply, but, who shall dare to say, not mercifully?  And even in its very coming it brought a tremendous opportunity, for we were not compelled to make war, notice that!  We had an option. The temptation was subtle. You have no concern with Servia, throw over Belgium, let France take care of itself.  For a time, probably a very short time, we should have avoided war and its horrors. The bait was held out by some peddling politicians that we should have stood in a magnificent position to obtain trade, to control markets, to dictate prices to the rest of the world. Magnificent prospect! We went to war, and, by a strange paradox, secured peace with honour: peace of the national conscience. Had we forsaken Belgium we could never again have held up our heads"]]]
