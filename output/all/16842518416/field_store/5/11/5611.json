It knows the way and will carry you safe.\"  So Jack set off on the King's horse, and as he passed the outer gate he saw the little mouse sentry coming away, for its guard was up. Now Jack was a kind-hearted lad, and he had saved some crumbs from his dinner in order to recompense the little sentry for his kindness. So he put his hand in his pocket and pulled out the crumbs.  \"Here you are, mousekin,\" he said. \"That's for your trouble!\"  Then the mouse thanked him kindly and asked if he would take him along to the King of the Frogs.  \"Not I,\" says Jack. \"I should get into trouble with your King.\"  But the mousekin insisted. \"I may be of some use to you,\" it said. So it ran up the horse's hind leg and up by its tail and hid in Jack's pocket. And the horse set off at a hard gallop, for it didn't half like the mouse running over it.  So at last Jack came to the palace of the King of all the Frogs, and there at the front gate was a frog doing sentry in a fine coat of mail and a brass helmet. And the frog sentry was for not letting Jack in; but the mouse called out that they came from the King of all the Mice and must be let in without delay. So they were taken to the King's chamber, where he sate surrounded by frog courtiers in fine clothes; but alas! he had heard nothing of the Castle on golden pillars, and though he summoned all the frogs of all the world to a Grand Assembly next morning, they all answered his question with:    \"_Kro kro, Kro kro_\"  which every one knows stands for \"No\" in frog language.  So the King said to Jack, \"There remains but one thing. You must go and ask my eldest brother, the King of all the Birds. His subjects are always on the wing, so mayhap they have seen something. Leave the horse you are riding here, and take one of mine. It knows the way, and will carry you safe.\"  So Jack set off, and being a kind-hearted lad he gave the frog sentry, whom he met coming away from his guard, some crumbs he had saved from his dinner. And the frog asked leave to go with him, and when Jack refused to take him he just gave one hop on to the stirrup, and a second hop on to the crupper, and the next hop he was in Jack's other pocket.  Then the horse galloped away like lightning, for it didn't like the slimy frog coming down \"plop\" on its back.  Well, after a time, Jack came to the palace of the King of all the Birds, and there at the front gate were a sparrow and a crow marching up and down with matchlocks on their shoulders. Now at this Jack laughed fit to split, and the mouse and the frog from his pockets called out:  \"We come from the King! Sirrahs! Let us pass.\"  So that the sentries were right mazed, and let them pass in without more ado.  But when they came to the King's chamber, where he sate surrounded by all manner of birds, tomtits, wrens, cormorants, turtle-doves, and the like, the King said he was sorry, but he had no news of the missing Castle. And though he summoned all the birds of all the world to a Grand Assembly next morning, not one of them had seen or heard tell of it.  So Jack was quite disconsolate till the King said, \"But where is the eagle? I don't see my eagle.\"  Then the Chamberlain--he was a tomtit--stepped forward with a bow and said:  \"May it please your Majesty he is late.\"  \"Late?\" says the King in a fume. \"Summon him at once.\"  So two larks flew up into the sky till they couldn't be seen and sang ever so loud, till at last the eagle appeared all in a perspiration from having flown so fast.  Then the King said, \"Sirrah! Have you seen a missing Castle that stands upon twelve pillars of gold?\"  And the eagle blinked its eyes and said, \"May it please your Majesty that is where I've been.\"  Then everybody rejoiced exceedingly, and when the eagle had eaten a whole calf so as to be strong enough for the journey, he spread his wide wings, on which Jack stood, with the mouse in one pocket and the frog in the other, and started to obey the King's order to take the owner back to his missing Castle as quickly as possible.  And they flew over land and they flew over sea, until at last in the far distance they saw the Castle standing on its twelve golden pillars. But all the doors and windows were fast shut and barred, for, see you, the servant-master who had run away with it had gone out for the day a-hunting, and he always bolted doors and windows while he was absent lest some one else should run away with it.  Then Jack was puzzled to think how he should get hold of the golden snuff-box, until the little mouse said:  \"Let me fetch it. There is always a mouse-hole in every castle, so I am sure I shall be able to get in.\"  So it went off, and Jack waited on the eagle's wings in a fume; till at last mousekin appeared.  \"Have you got it?\" shouted Jack, and the little mousie cried:                               \"Yes!\"  So every one rejoiced exceedingly, and they set off back to the palace of the King of all the Birds, where Jack had left his horse; for now that he had the golden snuff-box safe he knew he could get the Castle back whenever he chose to send the three little red men to fetch it. But on the way over the sea, while Jack, who was dead tired with standing so long, lay down between the eagle's wings and fell asleep, the mouse and the eagle fell to quarrelling as to which of them had helped Jack the most, and they quarrelled so much that at last they laid the case before the frog. Then the frog, who made a very wise judge, said he must see the whole affair from the very beginning; so the mouse brought out the golden snuff-box from Jack's pocket, and began to relate where it had been found and all about it. Now, at that very moment Jack awoke, kicked out his leg, and plump went the golden snuff-box down to the very bottom of the sea!  \"I thought my turn would come,\" said the frog, and went plump in after it.  Well, they waited, and waited, and waited for three whole days and three whole nights; but froggie never came up again, and they had just given him up in despair when his nose showed above the water.  \"Have you got it?\" they shouted.  \"No!\" says he, with a great gasp.  \"Then what do you want?\" they cried in a rage.  \"My breath,\" says froggie, and with that he sinks down again.  Well, they waited two days and two nights more, and at last up comes the little frog with the golden snuff-box in its mouth.  Then they all rejoiced exceedingly, and the eagle flew ever so fast to the palace of the King of the Birds.  But alas and alack-a-day! Jack's troubles were not ended; his mother's malison was still bringing him ill-luck, for the King of the Birds flew into a fearsome rage because Jack had not brought the Castle of the golden pillars back with him. And he said that unless he saw it by eight o'clock next morning Jack's head should come off as a cheat and a liar.  Then Jack being close to death opened the golden snuff-box, and out tumbled the three little red men in their three little red caps. They had recovered their tempers and were quite glad to be back with a master who knew that they would only, as a rule, work under fear of death; for, see you, the servant-master had been for ever disturbing their sleep with opening the box to no purpose.  So before the clock struck eight next morning, there was the Castle on its twelve golden pillars, and the King of the Birds was fine and pleased, and let Jack take his horse and ride to the palace of the King of the Frogs. But there exactly the same thing happened, and poor Jack had to open the snuff-box again and order the Castle to come to the palace of the King of the Frogs. At this the little red men were a wee bit cross; but they said they supposed it could not be helped; so, though they yawned, they brought the Castle all right, and Jack was allowed to take his horse and go to the palace of the King of all the Mice in the World. But here the same thing happened, and the little red men tumbled out of the golden snuff-box in a real rage, and said fellows might as well have no sleep at all! However, they did as they were bidden; they brought the Castle of the golden pillars from the palace of the King of the Frogs to the palace of the King of the Birds, and Jack was allowed to take his own horse and ride home.  [Illustration: They brought the Castle of the golden pillars]  But the year and a day which he had been allowed was almost gone, and even his gay young wife, after almost weeping her eyes out after her handsome young husband, had given up Jack for lost; so every one was astounded to see him, and not over-pleased either to see him come without his Castle. Indeed his father-in-law swore with many oaths that if it were not in its proper place by eight o'clock next morning Jack's life should be forfeit.  Now this, of course, was exactly what Jack had wanted and intended from the beginning; because when death was nigh he could open the golden snuff-box and order about the little red men. But he had opened it so often of late and they had become so cross that he was in a stew what to do; whether to give them time to show their temper, or to hustle them out of it. At last he decided to do half and half. So just as the hands of the clock were at five minutes to eight he opened the box, and stopped his ears!  Well! you never heard such a yawning, and scolding, and threatening, and blustering. What did he mean by it? Why should he take four bites at one cherry? If he was always in fear of death why didn't he die and have done with it?  In the midst of all this the tower clock began to whirr--  \"Gentlemen!\" says Jack--he was really quaking with fear--\"do as you are told.\"  \"For the last time,\" they shrieked. \"We won't stay and serve a master who thinks he is going to die every day.\"  And with that they flew out of the window.                      _AND THEY NEVER CAME BACK._  The golden snuff-box remained empty for evermore.  But when Jack looked out of window there was the Castle in the middle of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17034"],["title","English Fairy Tales (#7)"],["body"," on its twelve golden pillars, and there was his young wife ever so pretty and gay in her nightcap looking out of the window too.  So they lived happily ever after.     TATTERCOATS   In a great Palace by the sea there once dwelt a very rich old lord, who had neither wife nor children living, only one little granddaughter, whose face he had never seen in all her life. He hated her bitterly, because at her birth his favourite daughter died; and when the old nurse brought him the baby he swore that it might live or die as it liked, but he would never look on its face as long as it lived.  So he turned his back, and sat by his window looking out over the sea, and weeping great tears for his lost daughter, till his white hair and beard grew down over his shoulders and twined round his chair and crept into the chinks of the floor, and his tears, dropping on to the window-ledge, wore a channel through the stone, and ran away in a little river to the great sea. Meanwhile, his granddaughter grew up with no one to care for her, or clothe her; only the old nurse, when no one was by, would sometimes give her a dish of scraps from the kitchen, or a torn petticoat from the rag-bag; while the other servants of the palace would drive her from the house with blows and mocking words, calling her \"Tattercoats,\" and pointing to her bare feet and shoulders, till she ran away, crying, to hide among the bushes.  So she grew up, with little to eat or to wear, spending her days out of doors, her only companion a crippled gooseherd, who fed his flock of geese on the common. And this gooseherd was a queer, merry little chap, and when she was hungry, or cold, or tired, he would play to her so gaily on his little pipe, that she forgot all her troubles, and would fall to dancing with his flock of noisy geese for partners.  Now one day people told each other that the King was travelling through the land, and was to give a great ball to all the lords and ladies of the country in the town near by, and that the Prince, his only son, was to choose a wife from amongst the maidens in the company. In due time one of the royal invitations to the ball was brought to the Palace by the sea, and the servants carried it up to the old lord, who still sat by his window, wrapped in his long white hair and weeping into the little river that was fed by his tears.  But when he heard the King's command, he dried his eyes and bade them bring shears to cut him loose, for his hair had bound him a fast prisoner, and he could not move. And then he sent them for rich clothes, and jewels, which he put on; and he ordered them to saddle the white horse, with gold and silk, that he might ride to meet the King; but he quite forgot he had a granddaughter to take to the ball.  Meanwhile Tattercoats sat by the kitchen-door weeping, because she could not go to see the grand doings. And when the old nurse heard her crying she went to the Lord of the Palace, and begged him to take his granddaughter with him to the King's ball.  But he only frowned and told her to be silent; while the servants laughed and said, \"Tattercoats is happy in her rags, playing with the gooseherd! Let her be--it is all she is fit for.\"  A second, and then a third time, the old nurse begged him to let the girl go with him, but she was answered only by black looks and fierce words, till she was driven from the room by the jeering servants, with blows and mocking words.  Weeping over her ill-success, the old nurse went to look for Tattercoats; but the girl had been turned from the door by the cook, and had run away to tell her friend the gooseherd how unhappy she was because she could not go to the King's ball.  Now when the gooseherd had listened to her story, he bade her cheer up, and proposed that they should go together into the town to see the King, and all the fine things; and when she looked sorrowfully down at her rags and bare feet he played a note or two upon his pipe, so gay and merry, that she forgot all about her tears and her troubles, and before she well knew, the gooseherd had taken her by the hand, and she and he, and the geese before them, were dancing down the road towards the town.  \"Even cripples can dance when they choose,\" said the gooseherd.  Before they had gone very far a handsome young man, splendidly dressed, riding up, stopped to ask the way to the castle where the King was staying, and when he found that they too were going thither, he got off his horse and walked beside them along the road.  \"You seem merry folk,\" he said, \"and will be good company.\"  \"Good company, indeed,\" said the gooseherd, and played a new tune that was not a dance.  It was a curious tune, and it made the strange young man stare and stare and stare at Tattercoats till he couldn't see her rags--till he couldn't, to tell the truth, see anything but her beautiful face.  Then he said, \"You are the most beautiful maiden in the world. Will you marry me?\"  Then the gooseherd smiled to himself, and played sweeter than ever.  But Tattercoats laughed. \"Not I,\" said she; \"you would be finely put to shame, and so would I be, if you took a goose-girl for your wife! Go and ask one of the great ladies you will see to-night at the King's ball, and do not flout poor Tattercoats.\"  But the more she refused him the sweeter the pipe played, and the deeper the young man fell in love; till at last he begged her to come that night at twelve to the King's ball, just as she was, with the gooseherd and his geese, in her torn petticoat and bare feet, and see if he wouldn't dance with her before the King and the lords and ladies, and present her to them all, as his dear and honoured bride.  [Illustration: Tattercoats dancing while the gooseherd pipes]  Now at first Tattercoats said she would not; but the gooseherd said, \"Take fortune when it comes, little one.\"  So when night came, and the hall in the castle was full of light and music, and the lords and ladies were dancing before the King, just as the clock struck twelve, Tattercoats and the gooseherd, followed by his flock of noisy geese, hissing and swaying their heads, entered at the great doors, and walked straight up the ball-room, while on either side the ladies whispered, the lords laughed, and the King seated at the far end stared in amazement.  But as they came in front of the throne Tattercoats' lover rose from beside the King, and came to meet her. Taking her by the hand, he kissed her thrice before them all, and turned to the King.  \"Father!\" he said--for it was the Prince himself--\"I have made my choice, and here is my bride, the loveliest girl in all the land, and the sweetest as well!\"  Before he had finished speaking, the gooseherd had put his pipe to his lips and played a few notes that sounded like a bird singing far off in the woods; and as he played Tattercoats' rags were changed to shining robes sewn with glittering jewels, a golden crown lay upon her golden hair, and the flock of geese behind her became a crowd of dainty pages, bearing her long train.  And as the King rose to greet her as his daughter the trumpets sounded loudly in honour of the new Princess, and the people outside in the street said to each other:  \"Ah! now the Prince has chosen for his wife the loveliest girl in all the land!\"  But the gooseherd was never seen again, and no one knew what became of him; while the old lord went home once more to his Palace by the sea, for he could not stay at Court, when he had sworn never to look on his granddaughter's face.  So there he still sits by his window,--if you could only see him, as you may some day--weeping more bitterly than ever. And his white hair has bound him to the stones, and the river of his tears runs away to the great sea.     THE THREE FEATHERS   Once upon a time there lived a girl who was wooed and married by a man she never saw; for he came a-courting her after nightfall, and when they were married he never came home till it was dark, and always left before dawn.  Still he was good and kind to her, giving her everything her heart could desire, so she was well content for a while. But, after a bit, some of her friends, doubtless full of envy for her good luck, began to whisper that the unseen husband must have something dreadful the matter with him which made him averse to being seen.  Now from the very beginning the girl had wondered why her lover did not come a-courting her as other girls' lovers came, openly and by day, and though, at first, she paid no heed to her neighbours' nods and winks, she began at last to think there might be something in what they said. So she determined to see for herself, and one night when she heard her husband come into her room, she lit her candle suddenly and saw him.  And, lo and behold! he was handsome as handsome; beautiful enough to make every woman in the world fall in love with him on the spot. But even as she got her glimpse of him, he changed into a big brown bird which looked at her with eyes full of anger and blame.  \"Because you have done this faithless thing,\" it said, \"you will see me no more, unless for seven long years and a day you serve for me faithfully.\"  And she cried with tears and sobs, \"I will serve seven times seven years and a day if you will only come back. Tell me what I am to do.\"  Then the bird-husband said, \"I will place you in service, and there you must remain and do good work for seven years and a day, and you must listen to no man who may seek to beguile you to leave that service. If you do I will never return.\"  To this the girl agreed, and the bird, spreading its broad brown wings, carried her to a big mansion.  \"Here they need a laundry-maid,\" said the bird-husband. \"Go in, ask to see the mistress, and say you will do the work; but remember you must do it for seven years and a day.\"  \"But I cannot do it for seven days,\" answered the girl. \"I cannot wash or iron.\"  \"That matters nothing,\" replied the bird. \"All you have to do is to pluck three feathers from"]]]
