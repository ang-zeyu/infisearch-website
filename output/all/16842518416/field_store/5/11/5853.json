I felt that, despite my resolution, I was going mad.  Another fiery drop--and another!  I touched a rotting wooden post and slimy timbers.  I had reached one bound of my watery prison.  More fire fell from above, and the scream of hysteria quivered, unuttered, in my throat.  Keeping myself afloat with increasing difficulty in my heavy garments, I threw my head back and raised my eyes.  No more drops fell, and no more drops would fall; but it was merely a question of time for the floor to collapse.  For it was beginning to emit a dull, red glow.  The room above me was in flames!  It was drops of burning oil from the lamp, finding passage through the cracks in the crazy flooring, which had fallen about me--for the death trap had reclosed, I suppose, mechanically.  My saturated garments were dragging me down, and now I could hear the flames hungrily eating into the ancient rottenness overhead.  Shortly that cauldron would be loosed upon my head.  The glow of the flames grew brighter . . . and showed me the half-rotten piles upholding the building, showed me the tidal mark upon the slime-coated walls--showed me that there was no escape!  By some subterranean duct the foul place was fed from the Thames.  By that duct, with the outgoing tide, my body would pass, in the wake of Mason, Cadby, and many another victim!  Rusty iron rungs were affixed to one of the walls communicating with a trap--but the bottom three were missing!  Brighter and brighter grew the awesome light the light of what should be my funeral pyre--reddening the oily water and adding a new dread to the whispering, clammy horror of the pit.  But something it showed me . . . a projecting beam a few feet above the water . . . and directly below the iron ladder!  \"Merciful Heaven!\" I breathed.  \"Have I the strength?\"  A desire for laughter claimed me with sudden, all but irresistible force.  I knew what it portended and fought it down--grimly, sternly.  My garments weighed upon me like a suit of mail; with my chest aching dully, my veins throbbing to bursting, I forced tired muscles to work, and, every stroke an agony, approached the beam.  Nearer I swam . . . nearer.  Its shadow fell black upon the water, which now had all the seeming of a pool of blood.  Confused sounds--a remote uproar--came to my ears.  I was nearly spent . . . I was in the shadow of the beam!  If I could throw up one arm. . .  A shrill scream sounded far above me!  \"Petrie!  Petrie!\"  (That voice must be Smith's!)  \"Don't touch the beam!  For God's sake DON'T TOUCH THE BEAM!  Keep afloat another few seconds and I can get to you!\"  Another few seconds!  Was that possible?  I managed to turn, to raise my throbbing head; and I saw the strangest sight which that night yet had offered.  Nayland Smith stood upon the lowest iron rung . . . supported by the hideous, crook-backed Chinaman, who stood upon the rung above!  \"I can't reach him!\"  It was as Smith hissed the words despairingly that I looked up--and saw the Chinaman snatch at his coiled pigtail and pull it off!  With it came the wig to which it was attached; and the ghastly yellow mask, deprived of its fastenings, fell from position!  \"Here!  Here!  Be quick!  Oh!  be quick!  You can lower this to him!  Be quick!  Be quick!\"  A cloud of hair came falling about the slim shoulders as the speaker bent to pass this strange lifeline to Smith; and I think it was my wonder at knowing her for the girl whom that day I had surprised in Cadby's rooms which saved my life.  For I not only kept afloat, but kept my gaze upturned to that beautiful, flushed face, and my eyes fixed upon hers--which were wild with fear . . . for me!  Smith, by some contortion, got the false queue into my grasp, and I, with the strength of desperation, by that means seized hold upon the lowest rung.  With my friend's arm round me I realized that exhaustion was even nearer than I had supposed.  My last distinct memory is of the bursting of the floor above and the big burning joist hissing into the pool beneath us.  Its fiery passage, striated with light, disclosed two sword blades, riveted, edges up along the top of the beam which I had striven to reach.  \"The severed fingers--\" I said; and swooned.  How Smith got me through the trap I do not know--nor how we made our way through the smoke and flames of the narrow passage it opened upon. My next recollection is of sitting up, with my friend's arm supporting me and Inspector Ryman holding a glass to my lips.  A bright glare dazzled my eyes.  A crowd surged about us, and a clangor and shouting drew momentarily nearer.  \"It's the engines coming,\" explained Smith, seeing my bewilderment. \"Shen-Yan's is in flames.  It was your shot, as you fell through the trap, broke the oil-lamp.\"  \"Is everybody out?\"  \"So far as we know.\"  \"Fu-Manchu?\"  Smith shrugged his shoulders.  \"No one has seen him.  There was some door at the back--\"  \"Do you think he may--\"  \"No,\" he said tensely.  \"Not until I see him lying dead before me shall I believe it.\"  Then memory resumed its sway.  I struggled to my feet.  \"Smith, where is she?\" I cried.  \"Where is she?\"  \"I don't know,\" he answered.  \"She's given us the slip, Doctor,\" said Inspector Weymouth, as a fire-engine came swinging round the corner of the narrow lane.  \"So has Mr. Singapore Charlie--and, I'm afraid, somebody else.  We've got six or eight all-sorts, some awake and some asleep, but I suppose we shall have to let 'em go again.  Mr. Smith tells me that the girl was disguised as a Chinaman.  I expect that's why she managed to slip away.\"  I recalled how I had been dragged from the pit by the false queue, how the strange discovery which had brought death to poor Cadby had brought life to me, and I seemed to remember, too, that Smith had dropped it as he threw his arm about me on the ladder.  Her mask the girl might have retained, but her wig, I felt certain, had been dropped into the water.  It was later that night, when the brigade still were playing upon the blackened shell of what had been Shen-Yan's opium-shop, and Smith and I were speeding away in a cab from the scene of God knows how many crimes, that I had an idea.  \"Smith,\" I said, \"did you bring the pigtail with you that was found on Cadby?\"  \"Yes.  I had hoped to meet the owner.\"  \"Have you got it now?\"  \"No. I met the owner.\"  I thrust my hands deep into the pockets of the big pea-jacket lent to me by Inspector Ryman, leaning back in my corner.  \"We shall never really excel at this business,\" continued Nayland Smith.  \"We are far too sentimental.  I knew what it meant to us, Petrie, what it meant to the world, but I hadn't the heart.  I owed her your life--I had to square the account.\"    CHAPTER VII   NIGHT fell on Redmoat.  I glanced from the window at the nocturne in silver and green which lay beneath me.  To the west of the shrubbery, with its broken canopy of elms and beyond the copper beech which marked the center of its mazes, a gap offered a glimpse of the Waverney where it swept into a broad.  Faint bird-calls floated over the water. These, with the whisper of leaves, alone claimed the ear.  Ideal rural peace, and the music of an English summer evening; but to my eyes, every shadow holding fantastic terrors; to my ears, every sound a signal of dread.  For the deathful hand of Fu-Manchu was stretched over Redmoat, at any hour to loose strange, Oriental horrors upon its inmates.  \"Well,\" said Nayland Smith, joining me at the window, \"we had dared to hope him dead, but we know now that he lives!\"  The Rev. J. D. Eltham coughed nervously, and I turned, leaning my elbow upon the table, and studied the play of expression upon the refined, sensitive face of the clergyman.  \"You think I acted rightly in sending for you, Mr. Smith?\"  Nayland Smith smoked furiously.  \"Mr. Eltham,\" he replied, \"you see in me a man groping in the dark.  I am to-day no nearer to the conclusion of my mission than upon the day when I left Mandalay.  You offer me a clew; I am here.  Your affair, I believe, stands thus: A series of attempted burglaries, or something of the kind, has alarmed your household.  Yesterday, returning from London with your daughter, you were both drugged in some way and, occupying a compartment to yourselves, you both slept.  Your daughter awoke, and saw someone else in the carriage--a yellow-faced man who held a case of instruments in his hands.\"  \"Yes; I was, of course, unable to enter into particulars over the telephone.  The man was standing by one of the windows.  Directly he observed that my daughter was awake, he stepped towards her.\"  \"What did he do with the case in his hands?\"  \"She did not notice--or did not mention having noticed.  In fact, as was natural, she was so frightened that she recalls nothing more, beyond the fact that she strove to arouse me, without succeeding, felt hands grasp her shoulders--and swooned.\"  \"But someone used the emergency cord, and stopped the train.\"  \"Greba has no recollection of having done so.\"  \"Hm!  Of course, no yellow-faced man was on the train.  When did you awake?\"  \"I was aroused by the guard, but only when he had repeatedly shaken me.\"  \"Upon reaching Great Yarmouth you immediately called up Scotland Yard? You acted very wisely, sir.  How long were you in China?\"  Mr. Eltham's start of surprise was almost comical.  \"It is perhaps not strange that you should be aware of my residence in China, Mr. Smith,\" he said; \"but my not having mentioned it may seem so.  The fact is\"--his sensitive face flushed in palpable embarrassment--\"I left China under what I may term an episcopal cloud. I have lived in retirement ever since.  Unwittingly--I solemnly declare to you, Mr. Smith, unwittingly--I stirred up certain deep-seated prejudices in my endeavors to do my duty--my duty.  I think you asked me how long I was in China?  I was there from 1896 until 1900--four years.\"  \"I recall the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17302"],["title","Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers, vol.

THE TERMINAL STATION-WEST.[A]  BY B.F. CRESSON, JR., M. AM. SOC. C.E.     _Location of Work._--The area covered by the work of the Terminal Station-West is bounded as follows: By the east line of Ninth Avenue; by the south side of 31st Street to a point about 200 ft. west of Ninth Avenue; by a line running parallel to Ninth Avenue and about 200 ft. therefrom, from the south side of 31st Street to the boundary line between the 31st and 32d Street properties; by this line to the east line of Tenth Avenue; by the east line of Tenth Avenue to the boundary line between the 32d and 33d Street properties; by this line to the east line of Ninth Avenue. The area is approximately 6.3 acres.  _House-Wrecking._--The property between Ninth and Tenth Avenues was covered with buildings, 94 in number, used as dwelling and apartment houses and church properties, and it was necessary to remove these before starting the construction. Most of the property was bought outright by the Railroad Company, but in some cases condemnation proceedings had to be instituted in order to acquire possession. In the case of the property of the Church of St. Michael, fronting on Ninth Avenue, 31st and 32d Streets, the Railroad Company agreed to purchase a plot of land on the south side of 34th Street, west of Ninth Avenue, and to erect thereon a church, rectory, convent, and school, to the satisfaction of the Church of St. Michael, to hand over these buildings in a completed condition, and to pay the cost of moving from the old to the new buildings, before the old properties would be turned over to the Railroad Company.  The house-wrecking was done by well-known companies under contract with the Railroad Company. These companies took down the buildings and removed all the materials as far as to the level of the adjacent sidewalks. The building materials became the property of the contractors, who usually paid the Railroad Company for the privilege of doing the house-wrecking. The work was done between April and August, 1906, but the buildings of the Church of St. Michael were torn down between June and August, 1907.  The bricks were cleaned and sold directly from the site, as were practically all the fixtures in the buildings. The stone fronts were broken up and left on the premises. Some of the beams were sold on the premises, but most of them were sent to the storage yards. Some of the lath and smaller timber was sold for firewood, but most of it was given away or burned on the premises.  _Contracts and Agreements._--The main contract, awarded to the New York Contracting Company-Pennsylvania Terminal on April 28th, 1906, included about 502,000 cu. yd. of excavation (about 90% being rock), 17,820 cu. yd. of concrete walls, 1,320,000 lb. of structural steel, 638,000 ft., B.M., of framed timber, etc., etc.  This contract was divided into two parts: \"Work In and Under Ninth Avenue\" and \"Work Between Ninth and Tenth Avenues,\" and unit prices were quoted for the various classes of work in each of these divisions. The prices quoted for excavation included placing the material on scows supplied by the Railroad Company at the pier at the foot of West 32d Street, on the North River; there was a clause in the contract, however, by which the contractor could be required to make complete disposal of all excavated material at an additional unit price, and this clause was enforced on January 1st, 1909, when about 94% of the excavation had been done.  For the purpose of disposing of the excavated material in the easterly portion of the Terminal, the New York Contracting Company-Pennsylvania Terminal had excavated under Ninth Avenue a cut which came to the grade of 32d Street about midway between Ninth and Tenth Avenues, and a trestle was constructed from this point over Tenth Avenue and thence to the disposal pier at the foot of West 32d Street.  On May 11th, 1906, the work of excavation was commenced on the east side of Ninth Avenue, and on July 9th, 1906, on the south side of 31st Street, between Ninth and Tenth Avenues. From the beginning, the excavation was carried on by day and night shifts, except on Sundays and holidays, until January, 1909, except that during the period from November, 1907, to October, 1908, the night shift was discontinued.  _Geology._--The rock encountered may be classed as \"gneiss\"; its character varied from granite to mica schist. It was made up of quartz, feldspar, and mica, and there were also some isolated specimens of pyrites, hornblend, tourmaline, and serpentine. On the south side of the work, just west of Ninth Avenue, there were excellent examples of \"contortions\" of veins of quartz in the darker rock. On the east side of Ninth Avenue, near the north end of the work, glacial marks were found on the rock surface. The general direction of the stratification was north 5° west, and the general incline about 60° with the horizontal. As a rule, the rock broke sharply along the line of stratification. On the south side it broke better than on the north side, where it was usually softer and more likely to slide; and this, together with the fact that in winter it was subject to alternate freezing and thawing and in summer to the direct rays of the sun, made it rather difficult to get a good foundation for the retaining walls.   WORK IN AND UNDER NINTH AVENUE.  _General Description._--The work involved the excavation of about 375 ft. of the full width of Ninth Avenue to an average depth of about 58 ft., and the construction over this area of a steel viaduct, the deck of which was about 24 ft. below the surface, for the ultimate support of the Ninth Avenue structures.  The following estimated quantities appear in the contract: Excavation of rock, 72,600 cu. yd.; excavation of all materials except rock, 9,300 cu. yd.; concrete (1:3:6) in abutments, etc., 1,680 cu. yd.; timber, 504,000 ft., B.M.; structural steel, 1,320,000 lb., etc.  While this excavation was being done it was necessary to support and maintain the three-track elevated railway structure of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, of which 18 columns, or a length of about 340 ft., were affected, the two-track surface railway structure of the New York City Railway Company, and various pipes, sewers, and conduits, and to maintain all surface vehicular and pedestrian traffic. All structures were left in place with the exception of the pipes, most of which were temporarily cut out. The 48-in. brick sewer in the center of Ninth Avenue was broken, and the sewage was pumped across the excavation through a smaller pipe.  The general method adopted was as follows: The east and west sides of the avenue were closed, vehicular traffic was turned into the center, and a trestle for pedestrians was constructed west of the westerly elevated railway columns. All structures were then supported on transverse girders, running across the avenue, below the surface, and these rested on concrete piers on the central rock core. The sides of the avenue were then excavated to sub-grade, and the permanent steel viaduct was erected on both sides of the avenue as close as possible to the central rock core. The weight of all structures was then transferred to the permanent steel viaduct, erected on the sides of the avenue, by timber bents under the transverse girders resting on the permanent steel viaduct, and all weight was thus taken off the central rock core. This core was then excavated to sub-grade, the permanent viaduct was completed, and all structures were placed on its deck, using concrete piers and timber bents.  The design and erection of the permanent steel viaduct and the permanent foundations on its deck were done under another contract, apart from the North River Division work, and are not described in this paper.  _Elevated Railway Structure of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company._--The Ninth Avenue Elevated Railway was built between 1877 and 1880 as a two-track structure, the design being such as to permit a third or central track to be added later, and this was built in 1894. It is supported on columns under the outside tracks, about 43 ft. from center to center longitudinally and 22 ft. 3 in. from center to center transversely, the central track being carried by transverse girders between the columns.  The columns carrying the structure are of fan top design, with the points of bearing near the extremities at the top; each of the outside tracks is supported on two longitudinal latticed girders and the central track on two plate girders; between the columns, transverse girders are spliced to the outside track cross-frames, and carry the central track system. It was not thought desirable to put brackets on the columns near the street level to support the structure temporarily, and, as there is an expansion joint at each column, and as the transverse girders carrying the central track system are not rigidly attached to the longitudinal girders carrying the outside tracks, the central track could not be supported by supporting the outside tracks; therefore, independent supports for each track, in the form of overhead girders, had to be provided. The columns rest on brick piers, each having four 2-in. anchor-bolts. The brick foundations on the west side are wide in order to allow a 24-in. water main to pass directly beneath the columns. The foundations are usually on rock.  [Illustration: PLATE XLVII, FIG. 1.--TW 4, P.N.Y. & L.I.R.R. Terminal Station West.
