I dedicate this book to the memory of my friend J.J.M. who generously gave time, labor and valuable suggestions toward the preparation of the first edition for the press  Preface  Most of the materials for this book were gathered by the writer during several years' residence in England.  The attempt is here made to present them in a manner that shall illustrate the law of national growth, in the light thrown upon it by the foremost English historians.  The present edition has been carefully revised throughout, and, to a considerable extent, rewritten.  The authorities for the different periods will be found in the Classified List of Books in the Appendix; but the author desires to particularly acknowledge his indebtedness to the works of Bright, Brewer, Gardiner, Guest, Green, Lingard, Oman, and Traill; to the source books of Lee and of Kendall; and to the constitutional histories of Stubbs, Hallam, May, and Taswell-Langmead.  The author's hearty thanks are due to the late Professor W. F. Allen, of The University of Wisconsin; Professor Philip Van Ness Myers, of College Hill, Ohio; Professor George W. Knight, of Ohio State University; and to a number of teachers and friends for many valuable suggestions which they have kindly made.  David H. Montgomery  Contents  Leading Dates  xviii Period I.

He believes that every teacher will naturally pursue a system of his own, and that by so doing he will get better results than if he attempt to follow a rigid mechanical course which makes no allowance for individual judgment and gives no scope to originality of method.  The author would simply suggest that where time is limited it might be well to omit the General Reference Summaries (see, for instance, p. 43) and to read the text as a continuous narrative.  Then the important points in each day's lesson might be talked over at the end of the recitation or on the following day.  On the other hand, where time permits a thorough course of study, all of the topics might be taken up and carefully examined, and the General Reference Summaries may be consulted by way of review and for additional information.  The pupil can also be referred to one or more books (see the Classified List of Books in the Appendix) on the subjects under consideration.  Instead of the teacher's asking a prescribed set of routine questions, the pupil may be encouraged to ask his on.  Thus in undertaking the examination of a given topic--say, the Battle of Hastings (SS69-75), the issue of the Great Charter (SS195-202), or \"The Industrial Revolution\" and Watt's invention of an improved Steam Engine (S563)--there are five inquiries which naturally arise and which practically cover the whole ground.  These are: 1. When did the event occur?  2. Where did it occur? 3. How did it occur?  4. What caused it?  5. What came of it?  It will soon be seen that these five questions call attention first to the chronology of he event, secondly to its geography, thirdly to the narrative describing it, fourthly to its relations to preceding events, and fifthly to its relations to subsequent events.  The pupil will find that while in some instances he can readily obtain answers for all of these inquiries,--for example, in the case of the Great Charter,--in other instances he will have to content himself with the answer to only a part of the questions, perhaps, in fact, to only a single one; nevertheless the search will always prove instructive and stimulating.  Such a method of study, or one akin to it, will teach the pupil to think and to examine for himself.  It will lead him to see the inevitable limitations and the apparent contradictions of history.  It will make him realize, as pehaps nothing else can, that the testimony of different writers must be taken like that of witnesses in a court of justice.  He will see that while authorities seldem entirely agree respecting details, they will generally agree in regard to the main features of important events. Last of all, and best as well as last, these five questions will be found to open up new and broader fields of inquiry, and they may perhaps encourage the pupil to continue his work on some subject in which he becomes interested, beyond the limits of the textbook and the classroom.  Pursued in this way, the study of history will cease to be a dry delving for dead facts in the dust of a dead past.  It will rouse thought, it will quicken the pulse of an intellectual life, and it will end by making the pupil feel the full force of the great truth: that the present is an outgrowth of the past, and that it is only when we know what men have done, that we can hope to understnad what they are now doing.

The Earliest Inhabitants of England.  England was inhabited for many centuries before its written history began.  The earliest races that possessed the country were stunted, brutal savages.  They used pieces of rough flint for tools and weapons.  From flint too they produced fire.  They lived by hunting and fishing, and often had no homes but caves and rock shelters.  Following the Cave-Men came a race that had learned how to grind and polish the stone of which they made their hatchets, knives, and spears.  This race cleared and cultivated the soil to some extent, and kept cattle and other domestic animals.  [1] Reference Books on this Period will be found in the Classified List of Books in the Appendix.  The pronunciation of names will be found in the Index.  The Leading Dates stand unenclosed; all others are in parentheses.  2. The Britons  Finally, a large-limbed, fair-haired, fierce-eyed people invaded and conquered the island.  They came from the west of Europe.  They made their axes, swords, and spears of bronze,--a metal obtained by melting and mingling copper and tin.  These implements were far superior to any made of stone.  The new people were good farmers; they exported grain, cattle, and hides to Gaul (France), and mined and sold tin ore to merchants who came by sea from the eastern shore of the Mediterranean.  This strong and energetic race, known as Celts, eventually called themselves Britons.  By the time they had adopted that name they had made a great step forward, for they had learned how to mine and manufacture iron,--the most useful metal known to man; from it they forged scythes, swords, and spears.  Such were the people Caesar met when he invaded Britain, fifty-five years before the beginning of the Christian era.  The great Roman general called the Britons \"barbarians\"; but they compelled him to respect them, for they were a race of hard fighters, who fearlessly faced even his veteran troops.  3. The Religion of the Britons; the Druids.  The Britons held some dim faith in an overruling Power and in a life beyond the grave.  They offered human sacrifices to that Power, and when they buried one of their warriors, they buried his spear with him so that he might fight as good a battle in the next world as he had fought in this one.  Furthermore, the Britons had a class of priests called Druids, who seem to have worshiped the heavenly bodies.  These priests also acted as prophets, judges, and teachers.  Caesar tells us that the Druids instructed the youth about the stars and their motions, about the magnitude of the earth, the nature of things, and \"the might and power of the immortal gods.\"  More than this, the Druids probably erected the massive stone columns of that strange stucture, open to the sky, whose ruins may still be seen on the lonely expanse of Salisbury Plain.  There, on one of the fallen blocks, Carlyle and Emerson sat, when they made their pilgrimage to Stonehenge[1] many years ago, and discussed the life after death, with other questions of Druid philosophy.  [1] Stonehenge: This remarkable structure is believed to be the remains of a pre-historic monument to the dead, which was, perhaps, used also as a place of worship.  It stands on Salisbury Plain about nine miles northeast of the city of Salisbury.  (See map facing p. 38.)  It consists of a broken circle of huge upright stones, some of which are still connected at the top by blocks of flat stones. Within this circle, which is about one hundred feet in circumference, is a circle of smaller stones.  The structure has no roof.  The recent discover of stains of bronze or copper on one of the great stones, seven feet below the surface, strengthens the theory that Stonehenge was constructed by the race who used bronze implements and who were later known as Britons (S2).  Consult Professor C. Oman's \"England before the Norman Conquest\"; see also R. W. Emerson's \"English Traits,\" and O. W. Holmes's fine poem on the \"Broken Circle,\" suggested by a visit to Stonehenge.  4. What we owe to Prehistoric Man.  We have seen that the Romans called the Britons \"barbarians\" (S2). But we should bear in mind that all the progress which civilization has since made is built on the foundations which those primitive races slowly and painfully laid during unnumbered centuries of toil and strife.  To them we owe man's wonderful discovery of the power to produce fire.  To them we are indebted for the invention of the first tools, the first weapons, and the first attempts at architecture and pictorial art.  They too tamed the dog, the horse, and our other domestic animals.  They also discovered how to till the soil and how to mine and manufacture metals.  In fact those \"barbarians\" who lived in \"the childhood of the world,\" and who never wrote a line of history, did some things equal to any which history records, for out of wild plants and trees they developed the grains and fruits which now form an indispensable part of \"our daily bread.\"  Finally, through their incessant struggles with nature, and incessant wars among themselves, those rude tribes learned to establish forms of self-government for towns or larger districts.  Many of their salutary customs--their unwritten laws--still make themselves felt in the world.[1] They help bind the English nation together.  They do even more than that, for their influence can be traced in the history of newer nations, which, like the American republic, have descended from the great mother-countries of Europe.  [1] For example, parts of the \"Common Law\" can be traced back, through English \"dooms\" (decisions or laws), to prehistoric times.  See E. A. Freeman in the Encyclopaedia Britannica (10th edition, VIII, 276).  The New England \"Town Meeting\" can be likewise traced back to the German ancestors of the Anglo-Saxons.  [Figures: Carved bone, flint dagger, and bronze spearhead]   SECOND PERIOD[1]  \"Father Neptune one day to Dame Freedom did say, `If ever I lived upon dry land, The spot I should hit on would be little Britain.' Says Freedom, `Why that's my own island.' O, 't is a snug little island, A right little, tight little island! Search the world round, none can be found So happy as this little island.\"                                         T. Dibdin  THE GEOGRAPHY OF ENGLAND IN RELATION TO ITS HISTORY[2]  5. Geographical Names given by the Britons and the Romans  The steps of English history may be traced to a considerable extent by geographical names.  Thus the names of most of the prominent natural features, the hills, and especially the streams, originated with the Britons.  They carry us back to the Bronze Age (S2) and perhaps earlier.  Familiar examples of this are found in the name Malvern Hills, and in the word Avon (\"the water\"), which occurs in Stratford-on-Avon, and is repeated many times in England and Wales.  The Roman occupation of Britain is shown by the names ending in \"cester\" or \"chester\" (a corrupton of castra, a military camp).  Thus Leicester, Worcester, Dorchester, Colchester, Chester, indicate that these places were walled towns and military stations.  [1] Reference Books on this Period will be found in the Classified List of Books in the Appendix.  The pronunciation of names will be found in the Index. [2] As this Period necessarily contains references to certain events which occurred in later history, it may be advantageously reviewed by the pupil after he has reached an advanced stage in his course of study.  6. Saxon and Danish Names.  On the other hand, the names of many of the great political divisions, especially in the south and east of England, mark the Saxon settlements, such as Essex (the East Saxons), Sussex (the South Saxons), Middlesex (the Middle or Central Saxons).  In the same way the settlement of the two divisions of the Angles on the coast is indicated by the names Norfolk (the North folk) and Suffolk (the South folk).  (See map facing p. 24.)  The conquests and settlements of the Danes are readily traced by the Danish termination \"by\" (an abode or town), as in Derby, Rugby, Grimsby.  They occur with scarcely an exception north of London.  They date back to the time when King Alfred made the Treaty of Wedmore (S56), A.D. 878, by which the Danes agreed to confine themselves to the northern half of the country.  (See map facing p. 32.)  7. Norman Names.  The conquest of England by the Normans created but few new names. These, as in the case of Richmond and Beaumont, generally show where the invading race built a castle or an abbey, or where, as in Montgomeryshire, they conquered and held a district in Wales.
