After this St. George of Merrie England travelled far and travelled fast, with many adventures by the way, to Egypt where he had left his beloved Princess S창bia. But, learning to his great grief and horror from the same hermit he had met on first landing, that, despite her denials, her father, King Ptolemy, had consented to Almidor the black King of Morocco carrying her off as one of his many wives, he turned his steps towards Tripoli, the capital of Morocco; for he was determined at all costs to gain a sight of the dear Princess from whom he had been so cruelly rent.  To this end he borrowed an old cloak of the hermit, and, disguised as a beggar, gained admittance to the gate of the Women's Palace, where were gathered together on their knees many others, poor, frail, infirm.  And when he asked them wherefore they knelt, they answered:  \"Because good Queen S창bia succours us that we may pray for the safety of St. George of England, to whom she gave her heart.\"  Now when St. George heard this his own heart was like to break for very joy, and he could scarce keep on his knees when, lovely as ever, but with her face pale and sad and wan from long distress, the Princess S창bia appeared clothed in deep mourning.  In silence she handed an alms to each beggar in turn; but when she came to St. George she started and laid her hand on her heart. Then she said softly:  \"Rise up, Sir Beggar! Thou art too like one who rescued me from death, for it to be meet for thee to kneel before me!\"  Then St. George rising, and bowing low, said quietly: \"Peerless lady! Lo! I am that very knight to whom thou did'st condescend to give this.\"  And with this he slipped the diamond ring she had given him on her finger. But she looked not at it, but at him, with love in her eyes.  Then he told her of her father's base treachery and Almidor's part in it, so that her anger grew hot and she cried:  \"Waste no more time in talk. I remain no longer in this detested place. Ere Almidor returns from hunting we shall have escaped.\"  [Illustration: When she came to St. George she started and laid her hand on her heart]  So she led St. George to the armoury, where he found his trusty sword Ascalon, and to the stable, where his swift steed Bayard stood ready caparisoned.  Then, when her brave Knight had mounted, and she, putting her foot on his, had leapt like a bird behind him, St. George touched the proud beast lightly with his spurs, and, like an arrow from a bow, Bayard carried them together over city and plain, through woods and forests, across rivers, and mountains, and valleys, until they reached the Land of Greece.  And here they found the whole country in festivity over the marriage of the King. Now amongst other entertainments was a grand tournament, the news of which had spread through the world. And to it had come all the other Six Champions of Christendom; so St. George arriving made the Seventh. And many of the champions had with them the fair lady they had rescued. St. Denys of France brought beautiful Eglantine, St. James of Spain sweet Celestine, while noble Rosalind accompanied St. Anthony of Italy. St. David of Wales, after his seven years' sleep, came full of eager desire for adventure. St. Patrick of Ireland, ever courteous, brought all the six Swan-princesses who, in gratitude, had been seeking their deliverer St. Andrew of Scotland; since he, leaving all worldly things, had chosen to fight for the faith.  So all these brave knights and fair ladies joined in the joyful jousting, and each of the Seven Champions was in turn Chief Challenger for a day.  Now in the midst of all the merriment appeared a hundred heralds from a hundred different parts of the Paynim world, declaring war to the death against all Christians.  Whereupon the Seven Champions agreed that each should return to his native land to place his dearest lady in safety, and gather together an army, and that six months later they should meet, and, joining as one legion, go forth to fight for Christendom.  And this was done. So, having chosen St. George as Chief General, they marched on Tripoli with the cry:    \"For Christendom we fight,    For Christendom we die.\"  Here the wicked Almidor fell in single combat with St. George, to the great delight of his subjects, who begged the Champion to be King in his stead. To this he consented, and, after he was crowned, the Christian host went on towards Egypt where King Ptolemy, in despair of vanquishing such stalwart knights, threw himself down from the battlements of the palace and was killed. Whereupon, in recognition of the chivalry and courtesy of the Christian Champions, the nobles offered the Crown to one of their number, and they with acclaim chose St. George of Merrie England.  Thence the Christian host journeyed to Persia, where a fearsome battle raged for seven days, during which two hundred thousand pagans were slain, beside many who were drowned in attempting to escape. Thus they were compelled to yield, the Emperor himself happening into the hands of St. George, and six other viceroys into the hands of the six other Champions.  And these were most mercifully and honourably entreated after they had promised to govern Persia after Christian rules. Now the Emperor, having a heart fraught with despite and tyranny, conspired against them, and engaged a wicked wizard named Osmond to so beguile six of the Champions that they gave up fighting, and lived an easy slothful life. But St. George would not be beguiled; neither would he consent to the enchantment of his brothers; and he so roused them that they never sheathed their swords nor unlocked their armour till the wicked Emperor and his viceroys were thrown into that very dungeon in which St. George had languished for seven long years.  Whereupon St. George took upon himself the government of Persia, and gave the six other Champions the six viceroyalties.  So, attired in a beautiful green robe, richly embroidered, over which was flung a scarlet mantle bordered with white fur and decorated with ornaments of pure gold, he took his seat on the throne which was supported by elephants of translucent alabaster. And the Heralds at arms, amid the shouting of the people, cried:  \"Long live St. George of Merrie England, Emperor of Morocco, King of Egypt, and Sultan of Persia!\"  Now, after that he had established good and just laws to such effect that innumerable companies of pagans flocked to become Christians, St. George, leaving the Government in the hands of his trusted counsellors, took truce with the world and returned to England, where, at Coventry, he lived for many years with the Egyptian Princess S창bia, who bore him three stalwart sons. So here endeth the tale of St. George of Merrie England, first and greatest of the Seven Champions.     THE STORY OF THE THREE BEARS   Once upon a time there were three Bears, who lived together in a house of their own, in a wood. One of them was a Little Wee Bear, and one was a Middle-sized Bear, and the other was a Great Big Bear. They had each a bowl for their porridge; a little bowl for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bowl for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bowl for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a chair to sit in; a little chair for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized chair for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great chair for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a bed to sleep in; a little bed for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bed for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bed for the Great Big Bear.  One day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast, and poured it into their porridge-bowls, they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths by beginning too soon, for they were polite, well-brought-up Bears. And while they were away a little girl called Goldilocks, who lived at the other side of the wood and had been sent on an errand by her mother, passed by the house, and looked in at the window. And then she peeped in at the keyhole, for she was not at all a well-brought-up little girl. Then seeing nobody in the house she lifted the latch. The door was not fastened, because the Bears were good Bears, who did nobody any harm, and never suspected that anybody would harm them. So Goldilocks opened the door and went in; and well pleased was she when she saw the porridge on the table. If she had been a well-brought-up little girl she would have waited till the Bears came home, and then, perhaps, they would have asked her to breakfast; for they were good Bears--a little rough or so, as the manner of Bears is, but for all that very good-natured and hospitable. But she was an impudent, rude little girl, and so she set about helping herself.  First she tasted the porridge of the Great Big Bear, and that was too hot for her. Next she tasted the porridge of the Middle-sized Bear, but that was too cold for her. And then she went to the porridge of the Little Wee Bear, and tasted it, and that was neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and she liked it so well that she ate it all up, every bit!  Then Goldilocks, who was tired, for she had been catching butterflies instead of running on her errand, sate down in the chair of the Great Big Bear, but that was too hard for her. And then she sate down in the chair of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too soft for her. But when she sat down in the chair of the Little Wee Bear, that was neither too hard nor too soft, but just right. So she seated herself in it, and there she sate till the bottom of the chair came out, and down"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17034"],["title","English Fairy Tales (#3)"],["body","came, plump upon the ground; and that made her very cross, for she was a bad-tempered little girl.  Now, being determined to rest, Goldilocks went upstairs into the bedchamber in which the Three Bears slept. And first she lay down upon the bed of the Great Big Bear, but that was too high at the head for her. And next she lay down upon the bed of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too high at the foot for her. And then she lay down upon the bed of the Little Wee Bear, and that was neither too high at the head nor at the foot, but just right. So she covered herself up comfortably, and lay there till she fell fast asleep.  By this time the Three Bears thought their porridge would be cool enough for them to eat it properly; so they came home to breakfast. Now careless Goldilocks had left the spoon of the Great Big Bear standing in his porridge.                  \"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\"  said the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.  Then the Middle-sized Bear looked at his porridge and saw the spoon was standing in it too.                  \"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\"  said the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.  Then the Little Wee Bear looked at his, and there was the spoon in the porridge-bowl, but the porridge was all gone!        \"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE, AND HAS EATEN IT ALL UP!\"  said the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.  Upon this the Three Bears, seeing that some one had entered their house, and eaten up the Little Wee Bear's breakfast, began to look about them. Now the careless Goldilocks had not put the hard cushion straight when she rose from the chair of the Great Big Bear.                  \"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\"  said the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.  And the careless Goldilocks had squatted down the soft cushion of the Middle-sized Bear.                  \"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\"  said the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.        \"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR, AND HAS SATE THE BOTTOM        THROUGH!\"  said the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.  Then the Three Bears thought they had better make further search in case it was a burglar, so they went upstairs into their bedchamber. Now Goldilocks had pulled the pillow of the Great Big Bear out of its place.                  \"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\"  said the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.  And Goldilocks had pulled the bolster of the Middle-sized Bear out of its place.                  \"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\"  said the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.  But when the Little Wee Bear came to look at his bed, there was the bolster in its place!  And the pillow was in its place upon the bolster!  And upon the pillow----?  There was Goldilocks's yellow head--which was not in its place, for she had no business there.        \"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED,--AND HERE SHE IS STILL!\"  said the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.  [Illustration: \"Somebody has been lying in my bed,--and here she is!\"]  Now Goldilocks had heard in her sleep the great, rough, gruff voice of the Great Big Bear; but she was so fast asleep that it was no more to her than the roaring of wind, or the rumbling of thunder. And she had heard the middle-sized voice of the Middle-sized Bear, but it was only as if she had heard some one speaking in a dream. But when she heard the little wee voice of the Little Wee Bear, it was so sharp, and so shrill, that it awakened her at once. Up she started, and when she saw the Three Bears on one side of the bed, she tumbled herself out at the other, and ran to the window. Now the window was open, because the Bears, like good, tidy Bears, as they were, always opened their bedchamber window when they got up in the morning. So naughty, frightened little Goldilocks jumped; and whether she broke her neck in the fall, or ran into the wood and was lost there, or found her way out of the wood and got whipped for being a bad girl and playing truant, no one can say. But the Three Bears never saw anything more of her.  [Illustration: \"Somebody has been at my porridge, and has eaten it all up!\"]     TOM-TIT-TOT   Once upon a time there was a woman and she baked five pies. But when they came out of the oven they were over-baked, and the crust was far too hard to eat. So she said to her daughter:  \"Daughter,\" says she, \"put them pies on to the shelf and leave 'em there awhile. Surely they'll come again in time.\"  By that, you know, she meant that they would become softer; but her daughter said to herself, \"If Mother says the pies will come again, why shouldn't I eat these now?\" So, having good, young teeth, she set to work and ate the lot, first and last.  Now when supper-time came the woman said to her daughter, \"Go you and get one of the pies. They are sure to have come again by now.\"  Then the girl went and looked, but of course there was nothing but the empty dishes.  So back she came and said, \"No, Mother, they ain't come again.\"  \"Not one o' them?\" asked the mother, taken aback like.  \"Not one o' them,\" says the daughter, quite confident.  \"Well,\" says the mother, \"come again, or not come again, I will have one of them pies for my supper.\"  \"But you can't,\" says the daughter. \"How can you if they ain't come? And they ain't, as sure's sure.\"  \"But I can,\" says the mother, getting angry. \"Go you at once, child, and bring me the best on them. My teeth must just tackle it.\"  \"Best or worst is all one,\" answered the daughter, quite sulky, \"for I've ate the lot, so you can't have one till it comes again--so there!\"  Well, the mother she bounced up to see; but half an eye told her there was nothing save the empty dishes; so she was dished up herself and done for.  So, having no supper, she sate her down on the doorstep, and, bringing out her distaff, began to spin. And as she span she sang:    \"My daughter ha' ate five pies to-day,    My daughter ha' ate five pies to-day,    My daughter ha' ate five pies to-day,\"  for, see you, she was quite flabbergasted and fair astonished.  Now the King of that country happened to be coming down the street, and he heard the song going on and on, but could not quite make out the words. So he stopped his horse, and asked:  \"What is that you are singing, my good woman?\"  [Illustration: \"What is that you are singing, my good woman?\"]  Now the mother, though horrified at her daughter's appetite, did not want other folk, leastwise the King, to know about it, so she sang instead:    \"My daughter ha' spun five skeins to-day,    My daughter ha' spun five skeins to-day,    My daughter ha' spun five skeins to-day.\"  \"Five skeins!\" cried the King. \"By my garter and my crown, I never heard tell of any one who could do that! Look you here, I have been searching for a maiden to wife, and your daughter who can spin five skeins a day is the very one for me. Only, mind you, though for eleven months of the year she shall be Queen indeed, and have all she likes to eat, all the gowns she likes to get, all the company she likes to keep, and everything her heart desires, in the twelfth month she must set to work and spin five skeins a day, and if she does not she must die. Come! is it a bargain?\"  So the mother agreed. She thought what a grand marriage it was for her daughter. And as for the five skeins? Time enough to bother about them when the year came round. There was many a slip between cup and lip, and, likely as not, the King would have forgotten all about it by then.  Anyhow, her daughter would be Queen for eleven months. So they were married, and for eleven months the bride was happy as happy could be. She had everything she liked to eat, and all the gowns she liked to get, all the company she cared to keep, and everything her heart desired. And her husband the King was kind as kind could be. But in the tenth month she began to think of those five skeins and wonder if the King remembered. And in the eleventh month she began to dream about them as well. But ne'er a word did the King, her husband, say about them; so she hoped he had forgotten.  But on the very last day of the eleventh month, the King, her husband, led her into a room she had never set eyes on before. It had one window, and there was nothing in it but a stool and a spinning-wheel.  \"Now, my dear,\" he said quite kind like, \"you will be shut in here to-morrow morning with some victuals and some flax, and if by evening you have not spun five skeins, your head will come off.\"  Well she was fair frightened, for she had always been such a gatless thoughtless girl that she had never learnt to spin at all. So what she was to do on the morrow she could not tell; for, see you, she had no one to help her; for, of course, now she was Queen, her mother didn't live nigh her. So she just locked the door of her room, sat down on a stool, and cried and cried and cried until her pretty eyes were all red.  Now as she sate sobbing and crying she heard a queer little noise at the bottom of the door. At first she thought it was a mouse. Then she thought it must be something knocking.  So she upped and opened the door and what did she see? Why! a small, little, black Thing with a long tail that whisked round and round ever so fast.  \"What are you crying for?\" said that Thing, making a bow, and twirling its tail so fast that she could scarcely see it.  \"What's that to you?\" said she, shrinking a bit, for that Thing was very queer like.  \"Don't look at my tail if you're frightened,\" says That, smirking. \"Look at my toes. Ain't they beautiful?\"  And sure enough That had on buckled shoes with high heels and big bows, ever so smart.  [Illustration: A small, little, black Thing with a long tail]  So she kind of forgot about the tail, and wasn't so frightened, and when That asked her again why she was crying, she upped and said, \"It won't do no good if I do.\"  \"You don't know that,\" says That, twirling its tail "]]]
