Upon the noise of      this strange incident, the cruel bailiff returned command      that the poor infant must be cast again into the flames,      which was accordingly performed; and so that pretty babe was      born a martyr, and added to the number of the holy      innocents.  Parsons, the English Jesuit, has asserted that the women were felons and were executed for theft, while other apologists have described them as prostitutes and generally infamous in character. The original sentences, however, which still exist at the Guernsey _Greffe_, and which I have examined, conclusively settle the question. Both the ecclesiastical sentence, which is in Latin, and the civil sentence, which is in French, distinctly describe the charge as one of _heresy_, and make no mention whatever of any other crime as having aught to do with the condemnation.  It has been questioned too whether a child could be born alive under such circumstances. Mr. F.B. Tupper, in his _History of Guernsey_ (page 151), says: \"We are assured by competent surgical authority that the case is very possible\"; and he further mentions that in a volume entitled _Three Visits to Madagascar_, by the Rev. Wm. Ellis, published in London, in 1858, a precisely similar case is stated to have occurred in that island. A native woman was burnt for becoming a convert to Christianity, and her infant, born in the flames, was thrust into them again, and burnt also.  Lord Tennyson refers to this Guernsey martyrdom in his historical drama of _Queen Mary_ (Act v. Scene iv.). It is night-time in London; a light is burning in the Royal Palace; and he makes two \"Voices of the Night\" say:--  _First_:--There's the Queen's light. I hear she cannot live.  _Second_:--God curse her and her Legate! Gardiner burns Already; but to pay them full in kind, The hottest hold in all the devil's den Were but a sort of winter; Sir, in Guernsey, I watch'd a woman burn; and in her agony The mother came upon her--a child was born-- And, Sir, they hurl'd it back into the fire, That, being thus baptised in fire, the babe Might be in fire for ever. Ah, good neighbour, There should be something fierier than fire To yield them their deserts.  With regard to Witchcraft in Jersey, I have not had an opportunity of personally examining the official records there. I find, however, some information on the subject, given by M. De La Croix, in his _Ville de St. Hélier_, and _Les Etats de Jersey_, upon which I have drawn. In the way of legislation, the Guernsey Court does not appear to have promulgated any penal statutes on the subject, being content to treat the crime as one against the common law of the Island. In Jersey on the contrary, Witchcraft was specially legislated against at least on one occasion, for we find that on December 23rd, 1591, the Royal Court of that island passed an Ordinance, of which the following is the purport:--       Forasmuch as many persons have hitherto committed and      perpetrated great and grievous faults, as well against the      honour and express commandment of God as to the great      scandal of the Christian faith, and of those who are charged      with the administration of justice, by seeking assistance      from Witches and Diviners in their ills and afflictions; and      seeing that ignorance is no excuse for sin, and that no one      can tell what vice and danger may ensue from such practices:      This Act declares that for the time to come everyone shall      turn away from such iniquitous and diabolical practices,      against which the law of God decrees the same punishments as      against Witches and Enchanters themselves; and also in      order that the Divine Vengeance may be averted, which on      account of the impunity with which these crimes have been      committed, now threatens those who have the repression of      them in their hands. It is, therefore, strictly forbidden to      all the inhabitants of this island to receive any counsel or      assistance in their adversities from any Witches or      Diviners, or anyone suspected of practicing Sorcery, under      pain of one month's imprisonment in the Castle, on bread and      water; and on their liberation they shall declare to the      Court the cause of such presumption, and according as this      shall appear reasonable, shall be dealt with as the law of      God directs.  In 1562 two women were executed in Jersey for witchcraft. One of them named _Anne_, a native of St. Brelade's, was burnt at St. Helier's; and the other, _Michelle La Blanche_, expiated her crime at the gibbet of the Hurets, in the parish of St. Ouen, because criminals dwelling on the Fief Haubert de St. Ouen, were, in accordance with custom, required to be executed within the boundaries of the said Fief--seeing that it possessed a gallows-right--and their goods and lands became forfeited to the Seigneur.  In 1583 a rather curious point of law was raised in connection with a pending witch-trial at St. Helier's. On the 15th of February in that year, a suspected witch named _Marion Corbel_, who had been imprisoned in the Castle awaiting her trial, suddenly died. Whereupon her relatives came forward and claimed to be heirs to her goods and chattles, seeing that she had not been convicted of the imputed crime, and urging that her death put an end to further criminal proceedings. The Queen's Procureur, however--it was in the reign of Elizabeth--contended that death was no bar to the completion of the indictment, although it had effectually removed the criminal from the jurisdiction of the Court, as far as punishment was concerned. The very reasonable claim of the deceased woman's relatives was therefore set aside, and the defunct of course being found guilty, her possessions reverted to the crown.  Again, forty years later, in 1623, an old woman of sixty, named _Marie Filleul_, daughter of _Thomas Filleul_, of the parish of St. Clement's, was tried before a jury of twenty-four of her countrymen, and found guilty of the diabolical crime of Sorcery. She was therefore hanged and burnt as a witch, and her goods were confiscated to the King [James I.], and to the Seigneurs to whom they belonged.  It may be interesting to note here the opinion of Mr. Philippe Le Geyt, the famous commentator on the constitution and laws of Jersey, and one of the most enlightened men of his time, who for many years was Lieutenant-Bailiff of that island. He was born in 1635 and died in 1715, in his eighty-first year. In Vol. I., page 42, of his works, there occurs a passage of which the following is a translation:--       As Holy Scripture forbids us to allow witches to live, many      persons have made it a matter of conscience and of religion      to be severe in respect to such a crime. This principle has      without doubt made many persons credulous. How often have      purely accidental associations been taken as convincing      proofs? How many innocent people have perished in the flames      on the asserted testimony of supernatural circumstances? I      will not say that there are no witches; but ever since the      difficulty of convicting them has been recognized in the      island, they all seem to have disappeared, as though the      evidence of the times gone by had been but an illusion. This      shows the instability of all things here below.  Coming down now to within a century ago, we find an article in the _Gazette de Jersey_, of Saturday, March 10th, 1787, complaining of the great increase of wizards and witches in the island, as well as of their supposed victims. The writer says that the scenes then taking place were truly ridiculous, and he details a case that had just occurred at St. Brelade's as corroborative of his assertion. It appears that a worthy householder there, had dreamed that a certain wizard appeared to him and ordered him to poison himself at a date which was specified, enjoining him above all things not to mention the incident to anyone. The poor silly fellow was dreadfully distressed, for he felt convinced that he would have to carry out the disagreeable command. At the same time he was quite unable to keep so momentous a secret to himself, and so he divulged the approaching tragedy to his wife. The good woman's despair was fully equal to his own, and after much anxious domestic counsel they determined to seek the good offices of a White Witch (_une Quéraude_), with the hope that her incantations might overcome the evil spells of the Black Witch who was causing all the mischief. This White Witch prescribed lengthened fasting and other preparations for the great ordeal, and on a given night she and the bewitched householder, together with his wife and four or five trusty friends with drawn swords, shut themselves up in a room, and commenced their mysterious ceremonial. There was the boiling of occult herbs; the roasting of a beeve's heart stuck full of nails and pins; the reading of certain passages from the family Bible; a mighty gesticulating with the swords, which were first thrust up the chimney to prevent the Black Witch from coming down, and anon were pointed earthward to hinder him from rising up; and so the ridiculous game went on. The only person who benefited was of course the imposter, who was paid for her services; while we may perhaps charitably hope that her dupes also were afterwards easier in their minds. The writer adds that many other persons besides this man at St. Brelade's, had latterly believed themselves bewitched, and had consulted wizards, who were thus driving a profitable trade.         *       *       *       *       *  Among the indications and symptoms of a witch, are reckoned various bodily marks and spots, said to be insensible to pain (page 20), inability to shed tears, &c. The pricking of witches was at one time a lucrative profession both in England and Scotland, one of the most noted prickers being a wretched imposter named Matthew Hopkins "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17203"],["title","Witchcraft and Devil Lore in the Channel Islands (#2)"],["body","was sent for to all parts of the country to exercise his vile art. Ralph Gardner, in his _England's Grievance Discovered_ (1655), speaks also of two prickers, Thomas Shovel and Cuthbert Nicholson, who, in 1649 and 1650, were sent by the magistrates of Newcastle-on-Tyne, into Scotland, there to confer with another very able man in that line and bring him back to Newcastle. They were to have twenty shillings, but the Scotchman three pounds, per head _of all they could convict_, and a free passage there and back. When these wretches got to any town--for they tried all the chief market-towns in the district--the crier used to go round with his bell, desiring \"all people that would bring in any complaint against any woman for a witch, they should be sent for and tried by the person appointed.\" As many as thirty women were brought at once into the Newcastle town-hall, stripped and pricked, and twenty-seven set aside as guilty. Gardner continues:--       The said witch-finder acquainted Lieutenant-Colonel Hobson      that he knew women whether they were witches or no by their      looks; and when the said person was searching of a      personable and good-like woman, the said colonel replied and      said, 'Surely this woman is none, and need not be tried;'      but the Scotchman said she was, for the town said she was,      and therefore he would try her; and presently, in sight of      all the people, laid her body naked to the waist, with her      clothes over her head, by which fright and shame all her      blood contracted into one part of her body, and then he ran      a pin into her thigh, and then suddenly let her coats fall,      and then demanded whether she had nothing of his in her      body, but did not bleed? But she, being amazed, replied      little. Then he put his hands up her coats and pulled out      the pin, and set her aside as a guilty person and child of      the devil, and fell to try others, whom he made guilty.      Lieutenant-Colonel Hobson, perceiving the alteration of the      aforesaid woman by her blood settling in her right parts,      caused that woman to be brought again, and her clothes      pulled up to her thigh, and required the Scot to run the pin      into the same place, and then it gushed out of blood, and      the said Scot cleared her, and said she was not a child of      the devil.  If this precious wretch had not been stopped he would have declared half the women in the north country to be witches. But the magistrates and the people got tired of him at last, and his imposture being discovered, he was hanged in Scotland. At the gallows he confessed that he had been the death of 220 men and women in England and Scotland, simply for the sake of the twenty shillings which he generally received as blood-money.         *       *       *       *       *  The belief in _Sorcerots_, or witches' spells of a peculiar kind, mentioned in the _Depositions_ (pages 22, 23, &c.) receives curious modern confirmation by a kindred superstition still current among the emancipated negroes of the United States. It was described in a letter on \"Voudouism in Virginia\" which appeared in the _New York Tribune_, dated Richmond, September 17, 1875. Mr. Moncure D. Conway, in quoting this and commenting on it in his _Demonology and Devil-Lore_ (Vol. I. pages 68-69), says that it belongs to a class of superstitions generally kept close from the whites, as he believes, because of their purely African origin. Mr. Conway is, however, probably mistaken about the origin, seeing that the same belief prevailed in Guernsey three centuries ago. The extract from the letter is as follows:--       If an ignorant negro is smitten with a disease which he      cannot comprehend, he often imagines himself the victim of      witchcraft, and having no faith in \"white folks' physic\" for      such ailments, must apply to one of these quacks. A      physician residing near the city [Richmond] was invited by      such a one to witness his mode of procedure with a dropsical      patient for whom the physician in question had occasionally      charitably prescribed. Curiosity led him to attend the      seance, having previously informed the quack that since the      case was in such hands he relinquished all connection with      it. On the coverlet of the bed on which the sick man lay,      was spread a quantity of bones, feathers, and other trash.      The charlatan went through with a series of so-called      conjurations, burned feathers, hair, and tiny fragments of      wood in a charcoal furnace, and mumbled gibberish past the      physician's comprehension. He then proceeded to rip open the      pillows and bolsters, and took from them some queer      conglomerations of feathers. These he said had caused all      the trouble. Sprinkling a whitish powder over them, he burnt      them in his furnace. A black offensive smoke was produced,      and he announced triumphantly that the evil influence was      destroyed, and that the patient would surely get well. He      died not many days later, believing, in common with his      friends and relatives, that the conjurations of the \"trick      doctor\" had failed to save him only because resorted to too      late.  From the above it is evident that the natural tendency of wool and feathers to felt and clog together, has been distorted, by widely different peoples, into an outward and visible sign that occult and malignant influences were at work.         *       *       *       *       *  As to the manner in which wizards and witches were put to the question in Guernsey--that is tortured until they confessed whatever was required of them--Mr. Warburton, a herald and celebrated antiquary who wrote in the reign of Charles II., has given a circumstancial account, the correctness of which may be relied on. His _Treatise on the History, Laws and Customs of the Island of Guernsey_, bears the date of 1682, and at page 126 he says:--       By the law approved (_Terrien_, Lib. xii. cap. 37), torture      is to be used, though not upon slight presumption, yet where      the presumptive proof is strong, and much more when the      proof is positive, and there wants only the confession of      the party accused. Yet this practice of torturing does not      appear to have been used in the island for some ages, except      in the case of witches, when it was too frequently applied,      near a century since. The custom then was, when any person      was supposed guilty of sorcery or witchcraft, they carried      them to a place in the town called _La Tour Beauregard_, and      there, tying their hands behind them by the two thumbs, drew      them to a certain height with an engine made for that      purpose, by which means sometimes their shoulders were      turned round; and sometimes their thumbs torn off; but this      fancy of witches has for some years been laid aside.  It will be noticed in the subsequent _Confessions_ of witches (page 11, &c.), that a number of colons (:) are inserted in the text where they would not be required as ordinary marks of punctuation. These correspond, however, to similar pauses in the original records, and evidently indicate the successive stages by which the story was wrung from the wretched victims. They are thus endowed with a sad and ghastly significance, which must be borne in mind when the confessions are read. It must also be remembered that these confessions were not usually made in the connected form in which they stand recorded, but were rather the result of leading questions put by the inquisitors, such as: How old were you when the Devil first appeared to you? What form did he assume? What parish were you in? What were you doing? &c., &c.  Melancholy and revolting as all this is, yet the tortures made use of in Guernsey were far from possessing those refinements of cruelty and that intensity of brutality which characterised the methods practiced in some other countries. Let us take as a proof of this, the notable case of Dr. Fian and his associates, who were tried at Edinburgh, in the year 1591. The evidence was of the usual ridiculous kind, and a confession--afterwards withdrawn--was extorted by the following blood-curdling barbarities, as is quoted by Mr. C.K. Sharpe, in his _Historical Account of the Belief in Witchcraft in Scotland_:--       The said Doctor was taken and imprisoned, and used with the      accustomed paine provided for those offences inflicted upon      the rest, as is aforesaid. First, by thrawing of his head      with a rope, whereat he would confesse nothing. Secondly, he      was perswaded by faire meanes to confesse his follies; but      that would prevaile as little. Lastly, hee was put to the      most severe and cruell paine in the world, called the      bootes, who, after he had received three strokes, being      inquired if he would confesse his damnable actes and wicked      life, his toong would not serve him to speak; in respect      whereof, the rest of the witches willed to search his toong,      under which was founde two pinnes thrust up into the heade,      whereupon the witches did say, now is the charme stinted,      and shewed that these charmed pins were the cause he could      not confesse any thing; then was he immediately released of      the bootes, brought before the King, his confession was      taken, and his own hand willingly set thereunto.... But this      Doctor, notwithstanding that his owne confession appeareth      remaining in recorde under his owne hande-writing, and the      same thereunto fixed in the presence of the King's majestie,      and sundrie of his councell, yet did he utterly denie the      same. Whereupon the Kinges majestie, perceiving his      stubbourne wilfulnesse, conceived and imagined that in the      time of his absence hee had entered into newe conference and      league with the devill, his master, and that hee had beene      agayne newly marked, for the"]]]
