The cop's eyes widened so that Hershie could see the whites around his pupils  Hershie stared. \"What do you think you're doing?\" he said, after a measured silence.  The cop took a step back and slipped a little on the ice before catching himself on his cruiser.  \"Since when do you kick unarmed civilians in the back?\"  \"He -- he ran away. I had to catch him. I wanted to teach him not to run.\"  \"By inspiring his trust in the evenhandedness of Toronto's Finest?\" Hershie could see the cooling tracks of the cruiser, skidding and weaving through the projects. The kid had put up a good chase. Behind him, he heard the kid regain his feet and start running. The cop started forward, but Hershie stopped him with one finger, dead centre in the flak jacket.  \"You can't let him get away!\"  \"I can catch him. Trust me. But first, we're going to wait for your backup to arrive, and I'm going to file a report.\"  A _Sun_ reporter arrived before the backup unit. Hershie maintained stony silence in the face of his questions, but he couldn't stop the man from listening in on his conversation with the old constable who showed up a few minutes later, as he filed his report. He found the kid a few blocks away, huddled in an alley, hand pressed to the small of his back. He took him to Mount Sinai's emerg and turned him over to a uniformed cop.  #  The hysterical _Sun_ headlines that vilified Hershie for interfering with the cop sparked a round of recriminating voicemails from his mother, filled with promises to give him such a _zetz_ in the head when she next saw him. He folded his tights and cape and stuffed them in the back of his closet and spent a lot of time in the park for the next few weeks. He liked to watch the kids playing, a United Nations in miniature, parents looking on amiably, stymied by the language barrier that their kids hurdled with ease.  On March first, he took his tights out of the overstuffed hall closet and flew to Ottawa to collect his pension.  He touched down on the Parliament Hill and was instantly surrounded by high-booted RCMP constables, looking slightly panicky. He held his hands up, startled. \"What gives, guys?\"  \"Sorry, sir,\" one said. \"High security today. One of Them is speaking in Parliament.\"  \"Them?\"  \"The bugouts. Came down to have a chat about neighbourly relations. Authorised personnel only today.\"  \"Well, that's me,\" Hershie said, and started past him.  The constable, looking extremely unhappy, moved to block him. \"I'm sorry sir, but that's not you. Only people on the list. My orders, I'm afraid.\"  Hershie looked into the man's face and thought about hurtling skywards and flying straight into the building. The man was only doing his job, though. \"Look, it's payday. I have to go see the Minister of Defense. I've been doing it every month for _years_.\"  \"I know that sir, but today is a special day. Perhaps you could return tomorrow?\"  \"Tomorrow? My rent is due _today_, Sergeant. Look, what if I comm his office?\"  \"Please, sir, that would be fine.\" The Sergeant looked relieved.  Hershie hit a speed dial and waited. A recorded voice told him that the office was closed, the Minister at a special session.  \"He's in session. Look, it's probably on his desk -- I've been coming here for years; really, this is ridiculous.\"  \"I'm sorry. I have my orders.\"  \"I don't think you could stop me, Sergeant.\"  The Sergeant and his troops shuffled their feet. \"You're probably right, sir. But orders are orders.\"  \"You know, Sergeant, I retired a full colonel from the Armed Forces. I _could_ order you to let me past.\"  \"Sorry sir, no. Different chain of command.\"  Hershie controlled his frustration with an effort of will. \"Fine then. I'll be back tomorrow.\"  #  The building super wasn't pleased about the late rent. He threatened Hershie with eviction, told him he was in violation of the lease, quoted the relevant sections of the Tenant Protection Act from memory, then grudgingly gave in to Hershie's pleas. Hershie had half a mind to put his costume on and let the man see what a _real_ super was like.  But his secret identity was sacrosanct. Even in the era of Pax Aliena, the Super Man had lots of enemies, all of whom had figured out, long before, that even the invulnerable have weaknesses: their friends and families. It terrified him to think of what a bitter, obsolete, grudge-bearing terrorist might do to his mother, to Thomas, or even his old high-school girlfriends.  For his part, Thomas refused to acknowledge the risk; he'd was more worried about the Powers That Be than mythical terrorists.  The papers the next day were full of the overnight cabinet shuffle in Ottawa. More than half the cabinet had been relegated to the back-benches, and many of their portfolios had been eliminated or amalgamated into the new \"superportfolios:\" Domestic Affairs, Trade, and Extraterrestrial Affairs.  The old Minister of Defense, who'd once had Hershie over for Thanksgiving dinner, was banished to the lowest hell of the back-bench. His portfolio had been subsumed into Extraterrestrial Affairs, and the new Minister, a young up-and-comer named Woolley, wasn't taking Hershie's calls. Hershie called Thomas to see if he could loan him rent money.  Thomas laughed. \"Chickens coming home to roost, huh?\" he said.  \"What's that supposed to mean?\" Hershie said, hotly.  \"Well, there's only so much shit-disturbing you can do before someone sits up and takes notice. The Belquees is probably bugged, or maybe one of the commies is an informer. Either way, you're screwed. Especially with Woolley.\"  \"Why, what's wrong with Woolley?\" Hershie had met him in passing at Prime Minister's Office affairs, a well-dressed twenty-nine-year-old. He'd seemed like a nice enough guy.  \"What's _wrong_ with him?\" Thomas nearly screamed. \"He's the fricken _antichrist_! He was the one that came up with the idea of selling advertising on squeegee kids' t-shirts! He's heavily supported by private security outfits -- he makes Darth Vader look like a swell guy. That slicked-down, blow-dried asshole --\"  Hershie cut him off. \"OK, OK, I get the idea.\"  \"No you don't, Supe! You don't get the half of it. This guy isn't your average Liberal -- those guys usually basic opportunists. He's a _zealot_! He'd like to beat us with _truncheons_! I went to one of his debates, and he showed up with a _baseball bat_! He tried to _hit me_ with it!\"  \"What were you doing at the time?\"  \"What does it matter? Violence is never an acceptable response. I've thrown pies at better men than him --\"  Hershie grinned. Thomas hadn't invented pieing, but his contributions to the art were seminal. \"Thomas, the man is a federal Minister, with obligations. He can't just write me off -- he'll have to pay me.\"  \"Sure, sure,\" Thomas crooned. \"Of _course_ he will -- who ever heard of a politician abusing his office to advance his agenda? I don't know what I was thinking. I apologise.\"  #  Hershie touched down on Parliament Hill, heart racing. Thomas's warning echoed in his head. His memories of Woolley were already morphing, so that the slick, neat kid became feral, predatory. The Hill was marshy and cold and gray, and as he squelched up to the main security desk, he felt a cold ooze of mud infiltrate its way into his super-bootie. There was a new RCMP constable on duty, a turbanned Sikh. Normally, he felt awkward around the Sikhs in the Mounties. He imagined that their lack of cultural context made his tights and emblem seem absurd, that they evoked grins beneath the Sikhs' fierce moustaches. But today, he was glad the man was a Sikh, another foreigner with an uneasy berth in the Canadian military-industrial complex. The Sikh was expressionless as Hershie squirted his clearances from his comm to the security desk's transceiver. Imperturbably, the Sikh squirted back directions to Woolley's new office, just a short jaunt from the exalted heights of the Prime Minister's Office.  The Minister's office was guarded by: a dignified antique door that had the rich finish of wood that has been buffed daily for two centuries; an RCMP constable in plainclothes; a young, handsome receptionist in a silk navy power-suit; a slightly older office manager whose heart-stopping beauty was only barely restrained by her chaste blouse and skirt; and, finally, a pair of boardroom doors with spotless brass handles and a retinal scanner.  Each obstacle took more time to weather than the last, so it was nearly an hour before the office manager stared fixedly into the scanner until the locks opened with a soft clack. Hershie squelched in, leaving a slushy dribble on the muted industrial-grade brown carpet.  Woolley knelt on the stool of an ergonomic work-cart, enveloped in an articulated nest of displays, comms, keyboards, datagloves, immersive headsets, stylii, sticky notes and cup-holders. His posture, hair and expression rivaled one-another for flawlessness.  \"Hello, hello,\" he said, giving Hershie's hand a dry, firm pump. He smelled of expensive talc and leather car interiors.  He led Hershie to a pair of stark Scandinavian chairs whose polished lead undersides bristled with user-interface knobs. The old Minister's tastes had run to imposing oak desks and horsehair club-chairs, and Hershie felt a moment's disorientation as he sank into the brilliantly functional sitting-machine. It chittered like a roulette wheel and shifted to firmly support him.  \"Thanks for seeing me,\" Hershie said. He caught his reflection in the bulletproof glass windows that faced out over the Rideau Canal, and felt a flush of embarrassment when he saw how clownish his costume looked in the practical environs.  Woolley favoured him with half a smile and stared sincerely with eyes that were widely spaced, clever and hazel, surrounded by smile lines. The man fairly oozed charisma. \"I should be thanking you. I was just about to call you to set up a meeting.\"  _Then why haven't you been taking my calls_? Hershie thought."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17030"],["title","Super Man and the Bug Out (#4)"],["body","amely, he said, \"You were?\"  \"I was. I wanted to touch base with you, clarify the way that we were going to operate from now on.\"  Hershie felt his gorge rise. \"From now on?\"  \"I phrased that badly. What I mean to say is, this is a new Cabinet, a new Ministry. It has its own modus operandi.\"  \"How can it have its own modus operandi when it was only created last night?\" Hershie said, hating the petulance in his voice.  \"Oh, I like to keep lots of contingency plans on hand -- the time to plan for major changes is far in advance. Otherwise, you end up running around trying to get office furniture and telephones installed when you need to be seizing opportunity.\"  It struck Hershie how _finished_ the office was -- the staff, the systems, the security. He imagined Woolley hearing the news of his appointment and calling up files containing schematics, purchase orders, staff requisitions. It wasn't exactly devious, but it certainly teetered on the meridian separating _planning_ and _plotting_.  \"Well, you certainly seem to have everything in order.\"  \"I've been giving some thought to your payment arrangement. Did you know that there's a whole body of policy relating to your pension?\"  Hershie nodded, not liking where this was going.  \"Well, that's just not sensible,\" Woolley said, sensibly. \"The Canadian government already has its own pension apparatus: we make millions of direct-deposits every day, for welfare, pensions, employment insurance, mothers' allowance. We're up to our armpits in payment infrastructure. And having you fly up to Ottawa every month, well, it's ridiculous. This is the twenty-first century -- we have better ways of moving money around.  \"I've been giving it some thought, and I've come up with a solution that should make everything easier for everyone. I'm going to transfer your pension to the Canada Pension Plan offices; they'll make a monthly deposit directly to your account. I've got the paperwork all filled out here; all you need to do is fill in your banking information and your Social Insurance Number.\"  \"But I don't have a Social Insurance Number or a bank account,\" Hershie said. Of course, Hershie Abromowicz had both, but the Super Man didn't.  \"How do you pay taxes, then?\" Woolley had a dangerous smile.  \"Well, I --\" Hershie stammered. \"I don't! I'm tax-exempt! I've never had to pay taxes or get a bank account -- I just take my cheques to the Canadian Union of Public Employees' Credit Union and they cash them for me. It's the _arrangement_.\"  Woolley shook his head. \"Who told you you were tax-exempt?\" he asked, wonderingly. \"_No one_ is tax-exempt, except Status Indians. As to not having a bank account, well, you can open an account at the CUPE Credit Union and we'll make the deposits there. But not until this tax status matter is cleared up. You'll have to talk to Revenue Canada about getting a SIN, and get that information to Canada Pensions.\"  \"I _pay taxes_! Through my secret identity.\"  \"But does this. . .\" he made quote marks with his fingers, \"_secret identity_ declare your pension income?\"  \"Of course I don't! I have to keep my secret identity a _secret_!\" His voice was shrill in his own ears. \"It's a _secret identity_. I served in the Forces as the Super Man, so I get paid as the Super Man. Tax exempt, no bank accounts, no SIN. Just a cheque, every month.\"  Woolley leaned back and clasped his hands in his lap. \"I know that's how it used to be, but what I'm trying to tell you today is that arrangement, however longstanding, however well-intentioned, wasn't proper -- or even _legal_. It had to end some time. You're retired now -- you don't need your _secret identity,_\" again with the finger-quotes. \"If you already have a SIN, you can just give it to me, along with your secret identity's bank information, and we can have your pension processed in a week or two.\"  \"_A week or two_?\" Hershie bellowed. \"I need to pay my _rent_! That's not how it works!\"  Woolley stood, abruptly. \"No sir, that _is_ how it works. I'm trying to be reasonable. I'm trying to expedite things for you during this time of transition. But you need to meet me halfway. If you could give me your SIN and account information right now, I could speed things up considerably, I'm sure. I'm willing to make that effort, even though things are very busy here.\"  Hershie toyed with the idea of demolishing the man's office, turning his lovely furniture into molten nacho topping, and finishing up by leaving the man dangling by his suit from the CN Tower's needle. But his mother would kill him. \"I can't give you my secret identity,\" Hershie said, pleadingly. \"It's a matter of national security. I just need enough to pay my rent.\"  Woolley stared at the ceiling for a long, long time. \"There is one thing,\" he said.  \"Yes?\" Hershie said, hating himself for the note of hope in his voice.  \"The people at DefenseFest 33 called my office yesterday, to see if I'd appear as a guest speaker with the Patron Ik'Spir Pat. I had to turn them down, of course -- I'm far too busy right now. But I'm sure they'd be happy to have a veteran of your reputation in that slot, and it carries a substantial honorarium. I could call them for you and give them your comm. . .?\"  Hershie thought of Thomas, and of the rent, and of his mother, and of all the people at the Belquees who'd stared mistrustfully at him. \"Have them call me,\" he sighed. \"I'll talk to them.\"  He got to his feet, the toe of his boot squelching out more dirt pudding.  #  \"Hershie?\"  \"Yes, Mama?\" She'd caught him on the way home, flying high over the fleabag motels on the old Highway 2.  \"It's Friday,\" she said.  Right. Friday. He told her he'd come for dinner, and that meant getting there before sunset. \"I'll be there,\" he said.  \"Oh, it's not important. It's just me. Don't hurry on my account -- after all, you'll have thousands of Shabbas dinners with your mother. I'll live forever.\"  \"I said I'll be there.\"  \"And don't wear that costume,\" she said. She hated the costume. When the Department of Defense had issued it to him, she'd wanted to know why they were sending her boy into combat wearing red satin panties.  \"I'll change.\"  \"That's a good boy,\" she said. \"I'm making brisket.\"  #  By the time he touched down on the roof of his building, he knew he'd be late for dinner. He skimmed down the elevator shaft to the tenth floor and ducked out to his apartment, only to find the door padlocked. There was a note from the building super tacked to the peeling green paint. Among other things, it quoted the codicil from the Tenant Protection Act that allowed the super to padlock the door and forbade Hershie, on penalty of law, from doing anything about it.  Hershie's super-hearing picked up the sound of a door opening down the hallway. In a blur, he flew up to the ceiling and hovered there, pressing himself flat on the acoustic tile. One of his neighbours, that guy with the bohemian attitude who always seemed to be laughing at poor, nebbishy Hershie Abromowicz, made his way down the hall. He paused directly below Hershie's still, hovering form, reading the note on the door while he adjusted the collar of his ski-vest. He smirked at the note and got in the elevator.  Hershie let himself float to the ground, his cheeks burning.  Damn it, he didn't have _time_ for this. Not for any of it. He considered the padlock for a moment, then snapped the hasp with his thumb and index finger. Moving through the apartment with superhuman speed, he changed into a pair of nice slacks, a cable-knit sweater his mother had given him for his last birthday, a tweedy jacket and a woolen overcoat. Opening a window, he took flight.  #  \"Thomas, I _really_ can't talk right now,\" he said. His mother was angrily drumming her rings on the table's edge. Abruptly, she grabbed the bowl of cooling soup from his place setting and carried it into the kitchen. She hadn't done this since he was a kid, but it still inspired the same panicky dread in him -- if he wasn't going to eat his dinner, she wasn't going to leave it.  \"Supe, we _have_ to talk about this. I mean, DefenseFest is only a week away. We've got things to do!\"  \"Look, about DefenseFest. . .\"  \"Yes?\" Thomas had a wary note in his voice.  Hershie's mother reappeared with a plate laden with brisket, tsimmis, and kasha. She set it down in front of him.  \"We'll talk later, OK?\" Hershie said.  \"But what about DefenseFest?\"  \"It's complicated,\" Hershie began. His mother scooped up the plate of brisket and headed back to the kitchen. She was muttering furiously. \"I have to go,\" he said and closed his comm.  Hershie chased his mother and snatched the plate from her as she held it dramatically over the sink disposal. He held up his comm with the other hand and made a show of powering it down.  \"It's off, Mama. Please, come and eat.\"  #  \"I've been thinking of selling the house,\" she said, as they tucked into slices of lemon pound-cake.  Hershie put down his fork. \"Sell the house?\" While his father hadn't exactly _built_ the house with his own hands, he had sold his guts out at his discount menswear store to pay for it. His mother had decorated it, but his father's essence still haunted the corners. \"Why would you sell the house?\"  \"Oh, it's too big, Hershie. I'm just one old lady, and it's not like there're any grandchildren to come and stay. I could buy a condo in Florida, and there'd be plenty left over for you.\"  \"I don't need any money, Mama. I've got my pension.\"  She covered his hands with hers. \"Of course you do, bubbie. But fixed incomes are for old men. You're young, you need a nest egg, something to start a family with.\" Her sharp eyes, sunk into motherly pillows of soft flesh, bored into him. He tried to keep his gaze light and carefree. \"You've got money problems?\" she said, at length.  Hershie scooped up a forkful of pound-cake and shook his head. His mother's powers of perception bordered on clairvoyance, and he didn't trust himself to speak the lie outright. "]]]
