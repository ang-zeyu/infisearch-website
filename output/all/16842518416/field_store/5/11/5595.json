That was bad, Art thought, professionally. GMT polezeidom was meant to be a solid wall of oatmeal-thick bureaucracy, courtesy of some crafty, anonymous PDTalist. \"Please, stay at your current location. The police will be on the scene shortly. Very well done, sir.\"  Art turned to Linda, triumphant, ready for the traditional, postrhetorical accolades that witnesses of his verbal acrobatics were wont to dole out, and found her in an attitude of abject terror. Her eyes were crazily wide, the whites visible around the irises -- something he'd read about but never seen firsthand. She was breathing shallowly and had gone ashen.  Though they were not an actual couple yet, Art tried to gather her into his arms for some manly comforting, but she was stiff in his embrace, and after a moment, planted her palms on his chest and pushed him back firmly, even aggressively.  \"Are you all right?\" he asked. He was adrenalized, flushed.  \"*What if they'd decided to kill us*?\" she said, spittle flying from her lips.  \"Oh, they weren't going to hurt us,\" he said. \"No guts at all.\"  \"God*dammit*, you didn't know that! Where do you get off playing around with *my* safety? Why the hell didn't you just hand over your wallet, call the cops and be done with it? Macho fucking horseshit!\"  The triumph was fading, fast replaced by anger. \"What's wrong with you? Do you always have to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory? I just beat off those three assholes without raising a hand, and all you want to do is criticize? Christ, OK, next time we can hand over our wallets. Maybe they'll want a little rape, too -- should I go along with that? You just tell me what the rules are, and I'll be sure and obey them.\"  \"You fucking *pig*! Where the fuck do you get off raising your voice to me? And don't you *ever* joke about rape. It's not even slightly funny, you arrogant fucking prick.\"  Art's triumph deflated. \"Jesus,\" he said, \"Jesus, Linda, I'm sorry. I didn't realize how scared you must have been --\"  \"You don't know what you're talking about. I've been mugged a dozen times. I hand over my wallet, cancel my cards, go to my insurer. No one's ever hurt me. I wasn't the least bit scared until you opened up your big goddamned mouth.\"  \"Sorry, sorry. Sorry about the rape crack. I was just trying to make a point. I didn't know --\" He wanted to say, *I didn't know you'd been raped*, but thought better of it -- \"it was so...*personal* for you --\"  \"Oh, Christ. Just because I don't want to joke about rape, you think I'm some kind of *victim*, that *I've* been raped\" -- Art grimaced -- \"well, I haven't, shithead. But it's not something you should be using as a goddamned example in one of your stupid points. Rape is serious.\"  The cops arrived then, two of them on scooters, looking like meter maids. Art and Linda glared at each other for a moment, then forced smiles at the cops, who had dismounted and shed their helmets. They were young men, in their twenties, and to Art, they looked like kids playing dress up.  \"Evening sir, miss,\" one said. \"I'm PC McGivens and this is PC DeMoss. You called emergency services?\" McGivens had his comm out and it was pointed at them, slurping in their identity on police override.  \"Yes,\" Art said. \"But it's OK now. They took off. One of them left his wallet behind.\" He bent and picked it up and made to hand it to PC DeMoss, who was closer. The cop ignored it.  \"Please sir, put that down. We'll gather the evidence.\"  Art lowered it to the ground, felt himself blushing. His hands were shaking now, whether from embarrassment, triumph or hurt he couldn't say. He held up his now-empty palms in a gesture of surrender.  \"Step over here, please, sir,\" PC McGivens said, and led him off a short ways, while PC Blaylock closed on Linda.  \"Now, sir,\" McGivens said, in a businesslike way, \"please tell me exactly what happened.\"  So Art did, tastefully omitting the meat-parlor where the evening's festivities had begun. He started to get into it, to evangelize his fast-thinking bravery with the phone. McGivens obliged him with a little grin.  \"Very good. Now, again, please, sir?\"  \"I'm sorry?\" Art said.  \"Can you repeat it, please? Procedure.\"  \"Why?\"  \"Can't really say, sir. It's procedure.\"  Art thought about arguing, but managed to control the impulse. The man was a cop, he was a foreigner -- albeit a thoroughly documented one -- and what would it cost? He'd probably left something out anyway.  He retold the story from the top, speaking slowly and clearly. PC McGivens aimed his comm Artwards, and tapped out the occasional note as Art spoke.  \"Thank you sir. Now, once more, please?\"  Art blew out an exasperated sigh. His feet hurt, and his bladder was swollen with drink. \"You're joking.\"  \"No sir, I'm afraid not. Procedure.\"  \"But it's stupid! The guys who tried to mug us are long gone, I've given you their descriptions, you have their *identification* --\" But they didn't, not yet. The wallet still lay where Art had dropped it.  PC McGivens shook his head slowly, as though marveling at the previously unsuspected inanity of his daily round. \"All very true, sir, but it's procedure. Worked out by some clever lad using statistics. All this, it increases our success rate. 'Sproven.\"  Here it was. Some busy tribalist provocateur, some compatriot of Fede, had stirred the oats into Her Majesty's Royal Constabulary. Art snuck a look at Linda, who was no doubt being subjected to the same procedure by PC DeMoss. She'd lost her rigid, angry posture, and was seemingly -- amazingly -- enjoying herself, chatting up the constable like an old pal.  \"How many more times have we got to do this, officer?\"  \"This is the last time you'll have to repeat it to me.\"  Art's professional instincts perked up at the weasel words in the sentence. \"To you? Who else do I need to go over this with?\"  The officer shook his head, caught out. \"Well, you'll have to repeat it three times to PC DeMoss, once he's done with your friend, sir. Procedure.\"  \"How about this,\" Art says, \"how about I record this last statement to you with my comm, and then I can *play it back* three times for PC DeMoss?\"  \"Oh, I'm sure that won't do, sir. Not really the spirit of the thing, is it?\"  \"And what *is* the spirit of the thing? Humiliation? Boredom? An exercise in raw power?\"  PC McGivens lost his faint smile. \"I really couldn't say, sir. Now, again if you please?\"  \"What if I don't please? I haven't been assaulted. I haven't been robbed. It's none of my business. What if I walk away right now?\"  \"Not really allowed, sir. It's expected that everyone in England -- HM's subjects *and her guests* -- will assist the police with their inquiries. Required, actually.\"  Reminded of his precarious immigration status, Art lost his attitude. \"Once more for you, three more times for your partner, and we're done, right? I want to get home.\"  \"We'll see, sir.\"  Art recited the facts a third time, and they waited while Linda finished her third recounting.  He switched over to PC DeMoss, who pointed his comm expectantly. \"Is all this just to make people reluctant to call the cops? I mean, this whole procedure seems like a hell of a disincentive.\"  \"Just the way we do things, sir,\" PC DeMoss said without rancor. \"Now, let's have it, if you please?\"  From a few yards away, Linda laughed at something PC McGivens said, which just escalated Art's frustration. He spat out the description three times fast. \"Now, I need to find a toilet. Are we done yet?\"  \"'Fraid not, sir. Going to have to come by the Station House to look through some photos. There's a toilet there.\"  \"It can't wait that long, officer.\"  PC DeMoss gave him a reproachful look.  \"I'm sorry, all right?\" Art said. \"I lack the foresight to empty my bladder before being accosted in the street. That being said, can we arrive at some kind of solution?\" In his head, Art was already writing an angry letter to the *Times*, dripping with sarcasm.  \"Just a moment, sir,\" PC DeMoss said. He conferred briefly with his partner, leaving Art to stare ruefully at their backs and avoid Linda's gaze. When he finally met it, she gave him a sunny smile. It seemed that she -- at least -- wasn't angry any more.  \"Come this way, please, sir,\" PC DeMoss said, striking off for the High Street. \"There's a pub 'round the corner where you can use the facilities.\"  9.  It was nearly dawn before they finally made their way out of the police station and back into the street. After identifying Les from an online rogues' gallery, Art had spent the next six hours sitting on a hard bench, chording desultorily on his thigh, doing some housekeeping.  This business of being an agent-provocateur was complicated in the extreme, though it had sounded like a good idea when he was living in San Francisco and hating every inch of the city, from the alleged pizza to the fucking! drivers! -- in New York, the theory went, drivers used their horns by way of shouting \"Ole!\" as in, \"Ole! You changed lanes!\" \"Ole! You cut me off!\" \"Ole! You're driving on the sidewalk!\" while in San Francisco, a honking horn meant, \"I wish you were dead. Have a nice day. Dude.\"  And the body language was all screwed up out west. Art believed that your entire unconscious affect was determined by your upbringing. You learned how to stand, how to hold your face in repose, how to gesture, from the adults around you while you were growing up. The Pacific Standard Tribe always seemed a little bovine to him, their facial muscles long conditioned to relax into a kind of spacey, gullible senescence.  Beauty, too. Your local definition of attractive and ugly was conditioned by the people around you at puberty. There was a Pacific \"look\" that was indefinably off. Hard to say "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17028"],["title","Eastern Standard Tribe (#7)"],["body","it was, just that when he went out to a bar or got stuck on a crowded train, the girls just didn't seem all that attractive to him. Objectively, he could recognize their prettiness, but it didn't stir him the way the girls cruising the Chelsea Antiques Market or lounging around Harvard Square could.  He'd always felt at a slight angle to reality in California, something that was reinforced by his continuous efforts in the Tribe, from chatting and gaming until the sun rose, dragging his caffeine-deficient ass around to his clients in a kind of fog before going home, catching a nap and hopping back online at 3 or 4 when the high-octane NYC early risers were practicing work-avoidance and clattering around with their comms.  Gradually, he penetrated deeper into the Tribe, getting invites into private channels, intimate environments where he found himself spilling the most private details of his life. The Tribe stuck together, finding work for each other, offering advice, and it was only a matter of time before someone offered him a gig.  That was Fede, who practically invented Tribal agent-provocateurs. He'd been working for McKinsey, systematically undermining their GMT-based clients with plausibly terrible advice, creating Achilles' heels that their East-coast competitors could exploit. The entire European trust-architecture for relay networks had been ceded by Virgin/Deutsche Telekom to a scrappy band of AT&T Labs refugees whose New Jersey headquarters hosted all the cellular reputation data that Euros' comms consulted when they were routing their calls. The Jersey clients had funneled a nice chunk of the proceeds to Fede's account in the form of rigged winnings from an offshore casino that the Tribe used to launder its money.  Now V/DT was striking back, angling for a government contract in Massachusetts, a fat bit of pork for managing payments to rightsholders whose media was assessed at the MassPike's tollbooths. Rights-societies were a fabulous opportunity to skim and launder and spindle money in plenty, and Virgin's massive repertoire combined with Deutsche Telekom's Teutonic attention to detail was a tough combination to beat. Needless to say, the Route 128-based Tribalists who had the existing contract needed an edge, and would pay handsomely for it.  London nights seemed like a step up from San Francisco mornings to Art -- instead of getting up at 4AM to get NYC, he could sleep in and chat them up through the night. The Euro sensibility, with its many nap-breaks, statutory holidays and extended vacations seemed ideally suited to a double agent's life.  But Art hadn't counted on the Tribalists' hands-on approach to his work. They obsessively grepped his daily feed of spreadsheets, whiteboard-output, memos and conversation reports for any of ten thousand hot keywords, querying him for deeper detail on trivial, half-remembered bullshit sessions with the V/DT's user experience engineers. His comm buzzed and blipped at all hours, and his payoff was dependent on his prompt response. They were running him ragged.  Four hours in the police station gave Art ample opportunity to catch up on the backlog of finicky queries. Since the accident, he'd been distracted and tardy, and had begun to invent his responses, since it all seemed so trivial to him anyway.  Fede had sent him about a thousand nagging notes reminding him to generate a new key and phone with the fingerprint. Christ. Fede had been with McKinsey for most of his adult life, and he was superparanoid about being exposed and disgraced in their ranks. Art's experience with the other McKinsey people around the office suggested that the notion of any of those overpaid buzzword-slingers sniffing their traffic was about as likely as a lightning strike. Heaving a dramatic sigh for his own benefit, he began the lengthy process of generating enough randomness to seed the key, mashing the keyboard, whispering nonsense syllables, and pointing the comm's camera lens at arbitrary corners of the police station. After ten minutes of crypto-Tourette's, the comm announced that he'd been sufficiently random and prompted him for a passphrase. Jesus. What a pain in the ass. He struggled to recall all the words to the theme song from a CBC sitcom he'd watched as a kid, and then his comm went into a full-on churn as it laboriously re-ciphered all of his stored files with the new key, leaving Art to login while he waited.  Trepan: Afternoon!  Colonelonic: Hey, Trepan. How's it going?  Trepan: Foul. I'm stuck at a copshop in London with my thumb up my ass. I got mugged.  Colonelonic: Yikes! You OK?  Ballgravy: Shit!  Trepan: Oh, I'm fine -- just bored. They didn't hurt me. I commed 999 while they were running their game and showed it to them when they got ready to do the deed, so they took off.  ##Colonelonic laughs  Ballgravy: Britain==ass. Lon-dong.

He approached the desk sergeant and asked if he thought it would be much longer. The sergeant fiddled with a comm for a moment, then said, \"Oh, we're quite done with you sir, thank you.\" Art repressed a vituperative response, counted three, then thanked the cop.  He commed Linda.  \"What's up?\"  \"They say we're free to go. I think they've been just keeping us here for shits and giggles. Can you believe that?\"  \"Whatever -- I've been having a nice chat with Constable McGivens. Constable, is it all right if we go now?\"  There was some distant, English rumbling, then Linda giggled. \"All right, then. Thank you so much, officer!  \"Art? I'll meet you at the front doors, all right?\"  \"That's great,\" Art said. He stretched. His ass was numb, his head throbbed, and he wanted to strangle Linda.  She emerged into the dawn blinking and grinning, and surprised him with a long, full-body hug. \"Sorry I was so snappish before,\" she said. \"I was just scared. The cops say that you were quite brave. Thank you.\"  Art's adrenals dry-fired as he tried to work up a good angry head of steam, then he gave up. \"It's all right.\"  \"Let's go get some breakfast, OK?\"  10.  The parking-lot is aswarm with people, fire engines and ambulances. There's a siren going off somewhere down in the bowels of the sanatorium, and still I can't get anyone to look up at the goddamned roof.  I've tried hollering myself hoarse into the updrafts from the cheery blaze, but the wind's against me, my shouts rising up past my ears. I've tried dropping more pebbles, but the winds whip them away, and I've learned my lesson about half-bricks.  Weirdly, I'm not worried about getting into trouble. I've already been involuntarily committed by the Tribe's enemies, the massed and devious forces of the Pacific Daylight Tribe and the Greenwich Mean Tribe. I am officially Not Responsible. Confused and Prone to Wandering. Coo-Coo for Coco-Puffs. It's not like I hurt anyone, just decremented the number of roadworthy fartmobiles by one.  I got up this morning at four, awakened by the tiniest sound from the ward corridors, a wheel from a pharmaceuticals tray maybe. Three weeks on medically prescribed sleepytime drugs have barely scratched the surface of the damage wrought by years of circadian abuse. I'd been having a fragile shadow of a dream, the ghost of a REM cycle, and it was the old dream, the dream of the doctor's office and the older kids who could manage the trick of making a picture into reality.  I went from that state to total wakefulness in an instant, and knew to a certainty that I wouldn't be sleeping again any time soon. I paced my small room, smelled the cheerful flowers my cousins brought last week when they visited from Toronto, watched the horizon for signs of a breaking dawn. I wished futilely for my comm and a nice private channel where I could sling some bullshit and have some slung in my direction, just connect with another human being at a nice, safe remove.  They chide me for arguing on the "]]]
