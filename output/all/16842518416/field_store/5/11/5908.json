What decisive results had the terrible struggles produced, which stained almost periodically the valleys of the Tigris and the Zab with blood? After endless loss of life and property, they had nearly always issued in the establishment of the belligerents in their respective possessions, with possibly the cession of some few small towns or fortresses to the stronger party, most of which, however, were destined to come back to its former possessor in the very next campaign. The fall of the capital itself was not decisive, for it left the vanquished foe chafing under his losses, while the victory cost his rival so dear that he was unable to maintain the ascendency for more than a few years. Twice at least in three centuries a king of Assyria had entered Babylon, and twice the Babylonians had expelled the intruder of the hour, and had forced him back with a blare of trumpets to the frontier. Although the Ninevite dynasties had persisted in their pretensions to a suzerainty which they had generally been unable to enforce, the tradition of which, unsupported by any definite decree, had been handed on from one generation to another; yet in practice their kings had not succeeded in taking the hands of Bel, and in reigning personally in Babylon, nor in extorting from the native sovereign an official acknowledgment of his vassalage. Profiting doubtless by past experience, Assur-nazir-pal resolutely avoided those direct conflicts in which so many of his predecessors had wasted their lives. If he did not actually renounce his hereditary pretensions, he was content to let them lie dormant. He preferred to accommodate himself to the terms of the treaty signed a few years previously by Rammân-nirâri, even when Babylon neglected to observe them; he closed his eyes to the many ill-disguised acts of hostility to which he was exposed,* and devoted all his energies to dealing with less dangerous enemies.       * He did not make the presence of Cossoan troops among the      allies of the Sukhi a casus belli, even though they were      commanded by a brother and by one of the principal officers      of the King of Babylon.  Even if his frontier touched Karduniash to the south, elsewhere he was separated from the few states strong enough to menace his kingdom by a strip of varying width, comprising several less important tribes and cities;--to the east and north-east by the barbarians of obscure race whose villages and strongholds were scattered along the upper affluents of the Tigris or on the lower terraces of the Iranian plateau: to the west and north-west by the principalities and nomad tribes, mostly of Aramoan extraction, who now for a century had peopled the mountains of the Tigris and the steppes of Mesopotamia. They were high-spirited, warlike, hardy populations, proud of their independence and quick to take up arms in its defence or for its recovery, but none of them possessed more than a restricted domain, or had more than a handful of soldiers at its disposal. At times, it is true, the nature of their locality befriended them, and the advantages of position helped to compensate for their paucity of numbers.  [Illustration: 017.jpg THE ESCARPMENTS OF THE ZAB]       Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by M. Binder.  Sometimes they were entrenched behind one of those rapid watercourses like the Radanu, the Zab, or the Turnat, which are winter torrents rather than streams, and are overhung by steep banks, precipitous as a wall above a moat; sometimes they took refuge upon some wooded height and awaited attack amid its rocks and pine woods. Assyria was superior to all of them, if not in the valour of its troops, at least numerically, and, towering in the midst of them, she could single out at will whichever tribe offered the easiest prey, and falling on it suddenly, would crush it by sheer force of weight. In such a case the surrounding tribes, usually only too well pleased to witness in safety the fall of a dangerous rival, would not attempt to interfere; but their turn was ere long sure to come, and the pity which they had declined to show to their neighbours was in like manner refused to them. The Assyrians ravaged their country, held their chiefs to ransom, razed their strongholds, or, when they did not demolish them, garrisoned them with their own troops who held sway over the country. The revenues gleaned from these conquests would swell the treasury at Nineveh, the native soldiers would be incorporated into the Assyrian army, and when the smaller tribes had all in turn been subdued, their conqueror would, at length, find himself confronted with one of the great states from which he had been separated by these buffer communities; then it was that the men and money he had appropriated in his conquests would embolden him to provoke or accept battle with some tolerable certainty of victory.  Immediately on his accession, Assur-nazir-pal turned his attention to the parts of his frontier where the population was most scattered, and therefore less able to offer any resistance to his projects.*       * The principal document for the history of Assur-nazir-pal      is the Monolith of Nimrud, discovered by Layard in the      ruins of the temple of Ninip; it bears the same inscription      on both its sides. It is a compilation of various documents,      comprising, first, a consecutive account of the campaigns of      the kings first six years, terminating in a summary of the      results obtained during that period; secondly, the account      of the campaign of his sixth year, followed by three      campaigns not dated, the last of which was in Syria; and      thirdly, the history of a last campaign, that of his      eighteenth year, and a second summary. A monolith found in      the ruins of Kurkh, at some distance from Diarbekir,      contains some important additions to the account of the      campaigns of the fifth year. The other numerous inscriptions      of Assur-nazir-pal which have come down to us do not contain      any information of importance which is not found in the text      of the Annals. The inscription of the broken Obelisk, from      which I have often quoted, contains in the second column      some mention of the works undertaken by this king.  He marched towards the north-western point of his territory, suddenly invaded Nummi,* and in an incredibly short time took Gubbe, its capital, and some half-dozen lesser places, among them Surra, Abuku, Arura, and Arubi. The inhabitants assembled upon a mountain ridge which they believed to be inaccessible, its peak being likened to the point of an iron dagger, and the steepness of its sides such that no winged bird of the heavens dare venture on them. In the short space of three days Assur-nazir-pal succeeded in climbing its precipices and forcing the entrenchments which had been thrown up on its summit: two hundred of its defenders perished sword in hand, the remainder were taken prisoners. The Kirruri,** terrified by this example, submitted unreservedly to the conqueror, yielded him their horses, mules, oxen, sheep, wine, and brazen vessels, and accepted the Assyrian prefects appointed to collect the tribute.       * Nummi or Nimmi, mentioned already in the Annals of      Tiglath-pileser I., has been placed by Hommel in the      mountain group which separates Lake Van from Lake Urumiah,      but by Tiele in the regions situated to the southeast of      Nineveh; the observations of Delattre show that we ought      perhaps to look for it to the north of the Arzania,      certainly in the valley of that river. It appears to me to      answer to the cazas of Varto and Boulanîk in the sandjak of      Mush. The name of the capital may be identified with the      present Gop, chief town of the caza of Boulanîk; in this      case Abuku might be represented by the village of Biyonkh.       ** The Kirruri must have had their habitat in the depression      around Lake frumiah, on the western side of the lake, if we      are to believe Schrader; Jelattre has pointed out that it      ought to be sought elsewhere, near the sources of the      Tigris, not far from the Murad-su. The connection in which      it is here cited obliges us to place it in the immediate      neighbourhood of Nummi, and its relative position to Adaush      and Gilzân makes it probable that it is to be sought to the      west and south-west of Lake Van, in the cazas of Mush and      Sassun in the sandjak of Mush.  The neighbouring districts, Adaush, Gilzân, and Khubushkia, followed their example;* they sent the king considerable presents of gold, silver, lead, and copper, and their alacrity in buying off their conqueror saved them from the ruinous infliction of a garrison. The Assyrian army defiling through the pass of Khulun next fell upon the Kirkhi, dislodged the troops stationed in the fortress of Nishtun, and pillaged the cities of Khatu, Khatara, Irbidi, Arzania, Tela, and Khalua; ** Bubu, the Chief of Nishtun,*** was sent to Arbela, flayed alive, and his skin nailed to the city wall.       * Kirzâu, also transcribed Gilzân and Guzân, has been      relegated by the older Assyriologists to Eastern Armenia,      and the site further specified as being between the ancient      Araxes and Lake Urumiah, in the Persian provinces of Khoî      and Marand. The indications given in our text and the      passages brought together by Schrader, which place Gilzân in      direct connection with Kirruri on one side and with Kurkhi      on the other, oblige us to locate the country in the upper      basin of the Tigris, and I should place it near Bitlis-      tchaî, where different forms of the word occur many times on      the map, such as Ghalzan in Ghalzan-dagh; Kharzan, the name      of a caza of the sandjak of Sert; Khizan, the name of a caza      of the sandjak of Bitlis.

Khubushkia or Khutushkia      has been placed by Lenormant to the east of the Upper Zab,      and south of Arapkha, and this identification has been      approved by Schrader and also by Delitzsch; according to the      passages that Schrader himself has cited, it must, however,      have stretched northwards as far as Shatakh-su, meeting      Gilzân at one point of the sandjaks of Van and Hakkiari.       ** Assur-nazir-pal, in going from Kirruri to Kirkhi in the      basin of the Tigris, could go either by the pass of Bitlis      or that of Sassun; that of Bitlis is excluded by the fact      that it lies in Kirruri, and Kirruri is not mentioned in      what follows. But if the route chosen was by the pass of      Sassun, Khulun necessarily must have occupied a position at      the entrance of the defiles, perhaps that of the present      town of Khorukh. The name Khatu recalls that of the Khoith      tribe which the Armenian historians mention as in this      locality. Khaturu is perhaps Hâtera in the caza of Lidjô, in      the sandjak of Diarbekîr, and Arzania the ancient Arzan,      Arzn, the ruins of which may be seen near Sheikh-Yunus.      Tila-Tela is not the same town as the Tela in Mesopotamia,      which we shall have occasion to speak of later, but is      probably to be identified with Til or Tilleh, at the      confluence of the Tigris and the Bohtan-tcha. Finally, it is      possible that the name Khalua may be preserved in that of      Halewi, which Layard gives as belonging to a village      situated almost halfway between Rundvan and Til.       *** Nishtun was probably the most important spot in this      region: from its position on the list, between Khulun and      Khataru on one side and Arzania on the other, it is evident      we must look for it somewhere in Sassun or in the direction      of Mayafarrikin.  [Illustration: 021.jpg THE CAMPAIGNS OF ASSUR-NAZIR-PAL IN NAIRI]  In a small town near one of the sources of the Tigris, Assur-nazir-pal founded a colony on which he imposed his name; he left there a statue of himself, with an inscription celebrating his exploits carved on its base, and having done this, he returned to Nineveh laden with booty.  [Illustration: 022.jpg THE SITE OF SHADIKANNI AT ARBAN, ON THE KHABUR]       Drawn by Boudier, from a sketch taken by Layard.   A few weeks had sufficed for him to complete, on this side, the work bequeathed to him by his father, and to open up the neighbourhood of the northeast provinces; he was not long in setting out afresh, this time to the north-west, in the direction of the Taurus.*       * The text of the Annals declares that these events took      place in this same limmu, in what the king calls higher up      in the column the beginning of my royalty, the first year      of my reign. We must therefore suppose that he ascended the      throne almost at the beginning of the year, since he was      able to make two campaigns under the same eponym.  He rapidly skirted the left bank of the Tigris, burned some score of scattered hamlets at the foot of Nipur and Pazatu,* crossed to the right bank, above Amidi, and, as he approached the Euphrates, received the voluntary homage of Kummukh and the Mushku.** But while he was complacently engaged in recording the amount of vessels of bronze, oxen, sheep, and jars of wine which represented their tribute, a messenger of bad tidings appeared before him. Assyria was bounded on the east by a line of small states, comprising the Katna*** and the Bît-Khalupi,**** whose towns, placed alternately like sentries on each side the Khabur, protected her from the incursions of the Bedâwin.       * Nipur or Nibur is the Nibaros of Strabo. If we consider      the general direction of the campaign, we are inclined to      place Nipur close to the bank of the Tigris, east of the      regions traversed in the preceding campaign, and to identify      it, as also Pazatu, with the group of high hills called at      the present day the Ashit-dagh, between the Kharzan-su and      the Batman-tchai.       ** The Mushku (Moschiano or Meshek) mentioned here do not      represent the main body of the tribe, established in      Cappadocia; they are the descendants of such of the Mushku      as had crossed the Euphrates and contested the possession of      the regions of Kashiari with the Assyrians.       *** The name has been read sometimes Katna, sometimes Shuna.      The country included the two towns of Kamani and Dur-      Katlimi, and on the south adjoined Bît-Khalupi; this      identifies it with the districts of Magada and Sheddadîyeh,      and, judging by the information with which Assur-nazir-pal      himself furnishes us, it is not impossible that Dur-Katline      may have been on the site of the present Magarda, and Kamani      on that of Sheddadîyeh. Ancient ruins have been pointed out      on both these spots.       **** Suru, the capital of Bît-Khalupi, was built upon the      Khabur itself where it is navigable, for Assur-nazir-pal      relates further on that he had his royal barge built there      at the time of the cruise which he undertook on the      Euphrates in the VIth year of his reign. The itineraries of      modern travellers mention a place called es-Sauar or es-      Saur, eight hours march from the mouth of the Khabur on the      right bank of the river, situated at the foot of a hill some      220 feet high; the ruins of a fortified enclosure and of an      ancient town are still visible. Following Tomkins, I should      there place Suru, the chief town of Khalupi; Bît-Khalupi      would be the territory in the neighbourhood of es-Saur.  [Illustration: 024.jpg ONE OF THE WINGED BULLS FOUND AT ARBAN]       Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a sketch by Layard.  They were virtually Chaldæan cities, having been, like most of those which flourished in the Mesopotamian plains, thoroughly impregnated with Babylonian civilisation. Shadikanni, the most important of them, commanded the right bank of the Khabur, and also the ford where the road from Nineveh crossed the river on the route to Hariân and Carche-mish. The palaces of its rulers were decorated with winged bulls, lions, stelae, and bas-reliefs carved in marble brought from the hills of Singar. The people seem to have been of a capricious temperament, and, nothwithstanding the supervision to which they were subjected, few reigns elapsed in which it was not necessary to put down a rebellion among them. Bît-Khalupi and its capital Suru had thrown off the Assyrian yoke after the death of Tukulti-ninip; the populace, stirred up no doubt by Aramæan emissaries, had assassinated the Harnathite who governed them, and had sent for a certain Akhiababa, a man of base extraction from Bît-Adini, whom they had proclaimed king. This defection, if not promptly dealt with, was likely to entail serious consequences, since it left an important point on the frontier exposed: and there now remained nothing to prevent the people of Adini or their allies from spreading over the country between the Khabur and the Tigris, and even pushing forward their marauding bands as far as the very walls of Singar and Assur.  [Illustration: 024b.jpg NO. 1. ENAMELED BRICK (NIMROD). NO. 2. FRAGMENT OF MURAL PAINTING (NIMROD).]   [Illustration: 025.jpg STELE FROM ARBAN]       Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Layards sketch  Without losing a moment, Assur-nazir-pal marched down the course of the Khabur, hastily collecting the tribute of the cities through which he passed. The defenders of Sura were disconcerted by his sudden appearance before their town, and their rulers came out and prostrated themselves at the kings feet: Dost thou desire it? it is life for us;--dost thou desire it? it is death;--dost thou desire it? what thy heart chooseth, that do to us! But the appeal to his clemency was in vain; the alarm had been so great and the danger so pressing, that Assur-nazir-pal was pitiless. The town was handed over to the soldiery, all the treasure it contained was confiscated, and the women and children of the best families were made slaves; some of the ringleaders paid the penalty of their revolt on the spot; the rest, with Akhiabaha, were carried away and flayed alive, some at Nineveh, some elsewhere. An Assyrian garrison was installed in the citadel, and an ordinary governor, Azilu by name, replaced the dynasty of native princes. The report of this terrible retribution induced the Laqî* to tender their submission, and their example was followed by Khaian, king of Khindanu on the Euphrates. He bought off the Assyrians with gold, silver, lead, precious stones, deep-hued purple, and dromedaries; he erected a statue of Assur-nazir-pal in the centre of his palace as a sign of his vassalage, and built into the wall near the gates of his town an inscription dedicated to the gods of the conqueror.       * The Laqî were situated on both banks of the Euphrates,      principally on the right bank, between the Khabur and the      Balikh, interspersed among the Sukhi, of whom they were      perhaps merely a dissentient fraction.  Six, or at the most eight, months had sufficed to achieve these rapid successes over various foes, in twenty different directions--the expeditions in Nummi and Kirruri, the occupation of Kummukh, the flying marches across the mountains and plains of Mesopotamia--during all of which the new sovereign had given ample proof of his genius. He had, in fine, shown himself to be a thorough soldier, a conqueror of the type of Tiglath-pileser, and Assyria by these victories had recovered her rightful rank among the nations of Western Asia.  The second year of his reign was no less fully occupied, nor did it prove less successful than the first. At its very beginning, and even before the"]]]
