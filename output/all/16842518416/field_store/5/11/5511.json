Has not God fixed it for us, when He gave them the same passions, talents, tastes, as our own?\"  The farm labourer, unlike his brothers in the North, had no spirit left to strike. His sole enjoyment--such as it was--consisted in recalling \"'the glorious times before the war . . . when there was more food than there were mouths, and more work than were hands.'  \"'I say, vather,' drawled out some one, 'they say there's a sight more money in England now than there was afore the war-time.'  \"'Ees, booy,' said the old man, 'but _it's got into too few hands_.'\"  The system of 'sweating' among the London tailors had grown to such an extent that Kingsley was determined, if possible, to put an end to it, and with this purpose in view he wrote _Cheap Clothes and Nasty_.  The Government itself, he declares, does nothing to prevent sweating; the workmen declare that \"Government contract work is the worst of all, and the starved-out and sweated-out tailor's last resource . . . there are more clergymen among the customers than any other class; and often we have to work at home upon the Sunday at their clothes in order to get a living.\"  He followed this up with _Alton Locke_, dealing especially with the life and conditions of work of the journeymen tailors, and the Chartist riots. Both sides receive some hard knocks, for Kingsley was a born fighter, and his courage and fearlessness won him many friends, even among the most violent of the Chartists.  The character of Alton Locke was probably drawn from life, and was intended to be William Lovett, at one time a leader in the Chartist ranks. After a long fight with poverty, when he frequently went without a meal in order to save the money necessary for his education, he rose to a position of some influence. He was one of the first to propose that museums and public galleries should be opened on Sundays, for he declared that most of the intemperance and vice was owing to the want of wholesome and rational recreation. He insisted that it was necessary to create a moral, sober, and thinking working-class in order to enable them to carry through the reforms for which they were struggling. Disgust with the violent methods of many of his associates caused him at last to withdraw from their ranks.  Kingsley looked up to Carlyle as his master, to whom he owed more than to any other man. \"Of the general effect,\" he said, \"which his works had upon me, I shall say nothing: it was the same as they have had, thank God, on thousands of my class and every other.\"  When, finally, violent methods proved of no avail and the Chartist party dissolved, the democratic movement took a fresh lease of life. As Carlyle had already pointed out, the question of the people was a 'knife and fork' question--that is to say, so long as taxes were levied upon the necessities of life, the poorer classes, who could least of all afford to pay, would become poorer.  Sir Robert Peel was the first to remove this injustice, by substituting a tax upon income for the hundred and one taxes which had pressed so heavily upon the poor. Manufacturers were now able to buy their raw materials at a lower price, and need no longer pay such low wages to keep up their profits.  In 1845 Peel went a step farther, and in order to relieve the famine in Ireland, he removed the duty on corn. Thus, since corn could now be imported free, bread became cheaper.  The Corn Law Repealers had fought for years to bring this about. Their leader and poet, Ebenezer Elliott, declared that \"what they wanted was bread in exchange for their cottons, woollens, and hardware, and no other thing can supply the want of that one thing, any more than water could supply the want of air in the Black Hole of Calcutta.\" Bad government        Is the deadly will that takes     What Labour ought to keep,     It is the deadly power that makes     Bread dear and Labour cheap.  It was not until there had been many riots and much bloodshed that the Irish Famine forced Peel at last to give way.  A third party of reformers were working for the same end. This was the 'Young England' party, whose leader was Disraeli, a rising young politician. By birth a Jew, he had joined the English Church and the ranks of the Tory party. His early works are chiefly sketches of social and political life and are not concerned with the 'question of the People.' He took as his motto the words Shakespeare puts into Ancient Pistol's mouth,      Why, then the world's mine oyster,     Which I with sword will open,  thus showing at an early age that he had a firm belief in his own powers. From the beginning of his career he never hesitated in championing the cause of the People, and declared that \"he was not afraid or ashamed to say that he wished more sympathy had been shown on both sides towards the Chartists.\"  The people had begun to look upon the upper classes as their oppressors, who were living in comfort upon the profits wrung from their poorer brethren.  Thomas Cooper in his Autobiography describes the reckless and irreligious spirit which continued poverty was creating among the half-starved weavers:  \"'Let us be patient a little longer, lads, surely God Almighty will help us.' 'Talk no more about thy Goddle Mighty,' was the sneering reply; 'there isn't one. If there _was_ one, He wouldn't let us suffer as we do.'\"  The Chartists were opposed to the Anti-Corn Law party, for they thought that the cry of 'cheap bread' meant simply 'low wages,' and was a trap set to catch them unawares.  The Young England party believed in themselves as the leaders of a movement which should save England through its youth. They were, however, known in Parliament in their early days as \"young gentlemen who wore white waistcoats and wrote spoony poetry.\"  'Young England' wished for a return of the feudal relations between the nobility and their vassals; the nobles and the Church, as in olden days, were to stretch out a helping hand to the poor, to feed the hungry, and succour the distressed. National customs were to be revived, commerce and art were to be fostered by wealthy patrons. The Crown was once more to be in touch with the people. \"If Royalty did but condescend to lower itself to a familiarity with the people, it is curious that they will raise, exalt, and adore it, sometimes even invest it with divine and mysterious attributes. If, on the contrary, it shuts itself up in an august seclusion, it will be mocked and caricatured . . . if the great only knew what stress the poor lay by the few forms that remain, to join them they would make many sacrifices for their maintenance and preservation.\"[6]  [Footnote 6: George Smythe, Viscount Strangford, _Historic Fancies_.]  It was to lay the views of his party and himself before the public that Disraeli published the three novels, _Coningsby_, _Sybil_, and _Tancred_. _Coningsby_ deals with the political parties of that time, and is full of thinly-disguised portraits of people then living; _Sybil_, from which a quotation is given elsewhere, is a study of life among the working-classes; _Tancred_ discusses what part the Church should take in the government of the people.  Though the life of the 'Young England' party was short, it succeeded by means of agitation in and out of Parliament in calling public attention to the harshness of the New Poor Law and the need for social reform.  Carlyle was again the writer who influenced the young Disraeli, for the latter saw that to accomplish anything of real value he must form his own party and break loose from the worn-out beliefs and prejudices of both political parties. Though in later days he will be remembered as a statesman rather than as a novelist, it is necessary to study those three books in order to understand what England and the English were in Victoria's early years.  Each of these Reform parties had rendered signal service in their own fashion: Church, Government, and People were no longer disunited, distinctions of class had been broken down, and with their disappearance Chartism came to an end. The failure of the \"physical force\" Chartists in 1848 had served to enforce the lesson taught by Carlyle and Kingsley, that the way to gain reform was not through deeds of violence and bloodshed. Each man must learn to fit himself for his part in the great movement toward Reform. Intelligence, not force, must be their weapon.  After years of bitter strife between the Two Nations, England a last enjoyed peace within her own borders--that peace which a patriot poet, Ernest Jones, during a time of bitter trial had so earnestly prayed for:      God of battles, give us peace!     Rich with honour's proud increase;     Peace that frees the fettered brave;     Peace that scorns to make a slave;     Peace that spurns a tyrant's hand;     Peace that lifts each fallen land;     Peace of peoples, not of kings;     Peace that conquering freedom brings;     Peace that bids oppression cease;     God of battles, give us peace!     _Appendix to Chapter VI_   1838. The Chartist Movement. The Chartists demanded (1) Annual Parliaments; (2) Manhood Suffrage; (3) Vote by ballot; (4) Equal electoral districts; (5) Abolition of the property qualification for members of Parliament; (6) Payment for members of Parliament. The Reform Act of 1832 had brought the middle classes into power, and the working classes were now striving to better their own condition.  The Anti-Corn Law League, formed in this year, was largely a middle-class agitation supported by merchants and manufacturers. The great northern towns had been enfranchised by the Reform Bill, and sent as leaders of the movement Richard Cobden and John Bright. Both parties in Parliament were opposed to a total abolition of the Corn Laws.  1842. A motion for Free Trade defeated in Parliament by a large majority.  1843.

CHAPTER VII: _The Children of England_   \"From the folding of its robe, it brought two children; wretched, abject, frightful, hideous, miserable. . . . They were a boy and a girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish; but prostrate, too, in their humility. . . . 'They are Man's,' said the Spirit, looking down upon them. 'And they cling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want. Beware them both, and all of their degree, but most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased.'\"[8]  [Footnote 8: Charles Dickens, _A Christmas Carol_.]  In surveying the long reign of Queen Victoria nothing strikes one more than the gradual growth of interest in children, and the many changes in the nation's ideas of their upbringing and education. At the beginning of her reign the little children of the poor were for the most part slaves, and were often punished more cruelly by their taskmasters than the slaves one reads of in _Uncle Tom's Cabin_.  When Disraeli, afterward Lord Beaconsfield and Prime Minister, wrote _Sybil_, he drew, in that book, a terrible picture of the life of children in the manufacturing districts and in the country villages. The following extract speaks for itself:  \"There are many in this town who are ignorant of their very names; very few who can spell them. It is rare that you meet with a young person who knows his own age; rarer to find the boy who has seen a book, or the girl who has seen a flower. Ask them the name of their sovereign and they will laugh; who rules them on earth or who can save them in heaven are alike mysteries to them.\"  In such a town as Disraeli describes there were no schools of any kind, and the masters treated their apprentices \"as the Mamelouks treated the Egyptians.\" The author declares that \"there is more serfdom now in England than at any time since the Conquest. . . . The people were better clothed, better fed, and better lodged just before the Wars of the Roses than they are at this moment. The average term of life among the working classes is seventeen.\"  One of the first results of machinery taking the place of human labour was that an enormous number of women and young children of both sexes were employed in the factories in place of grown men, who were no longer needed. Especially in the spinning mills thousands of men were thrown out of work, and lower wages were paid to those who took their place. This led directly to the breaking up of the home and home-life. The wives were often obliged to spend twelve to thirteen hours a day in the mills; the very young children, left to themselves, grew up like wild weeds and were often put out to nurse at a shilling or eighteenpence a day.  One reads of tired children driven to their work with blows; of children who, \"too tired to go home, hide away in the wool in the drying-room to sleep there, and could only be driven out of the factory with straps; how many hundreds came home so tired every night that they could eat no supper for sleepiness and want of appetite, that their parents found them kneeling by the bedside where they had fallen asleep during their prayers.\"  Elizabeth Barrett Browning, one of the greatest poets of Victoria's reign, pleads for mercy and human kindness in her \"Cry of the Children.\"      Do ye hear the children weeping, O my brothers,       Ere the sorrow comes with years?     They are leaning their young heads against their mothers,       And _that_ cannot stop their tears.     The young lambs are bleating in the meadows,       The young birds are chirping in the nest,     The young fawns are playing with the shadows,       The young flowers are blowing toward the west--     But the young, young children, O my brothers,       They are weeping bitterly!     They are weeping in the playtime of the others,       In the country of the free.      \"For oh,\" say the children, \"we are weary,       And we cannot run or leap;     If we cared for any meadows, it were merely       To drop down in them and sleep.     Our knees tremble sorely in the stooping,       We fall upon our faces, trying to go;     And, underneath our heavy eyelids drooping       The reddest flower would look as pale as snow;     For, all day, we drag our burden tiring       Through the coal-dark underground--     Or, all day, we drive the wheels of iron       In the factories, round and round.\"  In the country the state of affairs was no better. New systems of industrial production threw large numbers of farm hands out of work, the rate of wages fell, and machinery, steam, and the work of women and children took the place of the labourer.  The children found a champion in Lord Ashley, afterward Lord Shaftesbury, who succeeded in the face of much opposition in his efforts to pass laws which should do away with such shameful wrong and injustice.  The increased amount of coal used (15-1/2 million tons at the beginning of the century, 64-1/2 million tons in 1854) naturally led to the demand for more workers, and it was owing to this that the proposals of Lord Shaftesbury met with such opposition from the mine-owners, who feared that if child labour were made illegal they would not have sufficient 'hands' to work the mines and that they would have to pay higher wages.  The Act of 1842 forbade altogether the employment of women and girls in the mines, and allowed only boys of the age of ten or more to do such work. The Poor Law Guardians of the time used to send children into the mines at the age of seven as a means of finding employment for them. The hours of work were limited to ten daily and fifty-eight each week.  Little or no attempt was made in the Bill to give children the means of obtaining a good education, although considerably more than half the children in the country never went to school at all, and many large towns were without a proper school.  By a previous Factory Act of 1834 all children under fourteen years of age were compelled to attend school for two hours daily. The employer was allowed to deduct one penny a week from the child's wages to pay the teacher. This proved absolutely useless, as the masters employed worn-out workers as teachers, and in consequence the children learnt nothing at all.  It was not until the year 1870 that a Bill was passed in Parliament to create an adequate number of public elementary schools for every district in the kingdom. To show the increase in the number of schools built, there were in the year 1854, 3825, and in the year 1885, 21,976.  But the children of England owe almost as much to Charles Dickens as they do to Lord Shaftesbury. He was almost the first, and certainly the greatest, writer who, with a heart overflowing with sympathy for little children, has left us in his books a gallery of portraits which no one can ever forget.  He himself, \"a very small and not over-particularly-taken-care-of boy,\" passed through a time of bitter poverty, and his stay at school, short as it was, was not a"]]]
