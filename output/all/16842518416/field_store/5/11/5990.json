Fuller's account of the elder Marvell is too good to be passed over:--     \"He afterwards became Minister at Hull, where for his lifetime he was    well beloved. Most facetious in discourse, yet grave in his carriage,    a most excellent preacher who, like a good husband, never broached    what he had new brewed, but preached what he had pre-studied some    competent time before. Insomuch that he was wont to say that he would    cross the common proverb which called Saturday the working-day and    Monday the holyday of preachers. It happened that Anno Dom. 1640,    Jan. 23, crossing Humber in a Barrow boat, the same was sandwarpt,    and he was drowned therein (with Mrs. Skinner, daughter to Sir Edward    Coke, a very religious gentlewoman) by the carelessness, not to say    drunkenness of the boatmen, to the great grief of all good men. His    excellent comment upon St. Peter is daily desired and expected, if    the envy and covetousness of private persons _for their own use_    deprive not the public of the benefit thereof.\"[6:1]  This good man, to whom perhaps, remembering the date of his death, the words may apply, _Tu vero felix non vitæ tantum claritate sed etiam opportunitate mortis_, was married at Cherry Burton, on the 22nd of October 1612, to Anne Pease, a member of a family destined to become widely known throughout the north of England. Of this marriage there were five children, all born at Winestead, viz. three daughters, Anne, Mary, and Elizabeth, and two sons, Andrew and John, the latter of whom died a year after his birth, and was buried at Winestead on the 20th September 1624.  The three daughters married respectively James Blaydes of Sutton, Yorkshire, on the 29th of December 1633; Edmund Popple, afterwards Sheriff of Hull, on the 18th of August 1636; and Robert More. Anne's eldest son, Joseph Blaydes, was Mayor of Hull in 1702, having married the daughter of a preceding Mayor in 1698. The descendants of this branch still flourish. The Popples also had children, one of whom, William Popple, was a correspondent of his uncle the poet's, and a merchant of repute, who became in 1696 Secretary to the Board of Trade, and the friend of the most famous man who ever sat at the table of that Board, John Locke. A son of this William Popple led a very comfortable eighteenth-century life, which is in strong contrast with that of his grand-uncle, for, having entered the Cofferers' Office about 1730, he was made seven years later Solicitor and Clerk of the Reports to the Commissioners of Trade and Plantations, and in 1745 became in succession to a relative, one Alured Popple, Governor of the Bermudas, a post he retained until his death, which occurred not      \"Where the remote Bermudas ride      In the ocean's bosom unespied,\"  but at his house in Hampstead. So well placed and idle a gentleman was almost bound to be a bad poet and worse dramatist, and this William Popple was both.  Marvell's third sister, Elizabeth, does not seem to have had issue, a certain Thomas More, or Moore, a Fellow of Magdalen College, Cambridge, whose name occurs in family records, being her stepson.  In the latter part of 1624 the elder Marvell resigned the living of Winestead, and took up the duties of schoolmaster and lecturer, or preacher, at Hull. Important duties they were, for the old Grammar School of Hull dates back to 1486, and may boast of a long career of usefulness, never having fallen into that condition of decay and disrepute from which so many similar endowments have been of late years rescued by the beneficent and, of course, abused action of the Charity Commissioners. Andrew Marvell the elder succeeded to and was succeeded by eminent headmasters. Trinity Church, where the poet's father preached on Sundays to crowded and interested congregations, was then what it still is, though restored by Scott, one of the great churches in the north of England.  The Rev. Andrew Marvell made his mark upon Hull. Mr. Grosart, who lacked nothing but the curb upon a too exuberant vocabulary, a little less enthusiasm and a great deal more discretion, to be a model editor, tells us in his invaluable edition of _The Complete Works in Verse and Prose of Andrew Marvell, M.P._,[8:1] that he had read a number of the elder Marvell's manuscripts, consisting of sermons and miscellaneous papers, from which Mr. Grosart proceeds:--     \"I gather three things.     \"(1) That he was a man of a very brave, fearlessly outspoken    character. Some of his practical applications in his sermons before    the Magistrates are daring in their directness of reproof, and    melting in their wistfulness of entreaty.     \"(2) That he was a well-read man. His Sermons are as full of    classical and patristic allusions and pat sayings from the most    occult literatures as even Bishop Andrewes.     \"(3) That he was a man of tireless activity. Besides the two offices    named, he became head of one of the Great Hospitals of the Town    (Charter House), and in an address to the Governors placed before    them a prescient and statesmanlike plan for the better management of    its revenues, and for the foundation of a Free Public Library to be    accessible to all.\"  When at a later day, and in the midst of a fierce controversy, Andrew Marvell wrote of the clergy as \"the reserve of our Christianity,\" he doubtless had such men as his father in his mind and memory.  It was at the old Grammar School of Hull, and with his father as his _Orbilius_, that Marvell was initiated into the mysteries of the Latin grammar, and was, as he tells us, put to his        \"Montibus, inquit, erunt; et erant submontibus illis;       Risit Atlantiades; et me mihi, perfide, prodis?       Me mihi prodis? ait.     \"For as I remember this scanning was a liberal art that we learn'd at    Grammar School, and to scan verses as he does the Author's prose    before we did or were obliged to understand them.\"[8:2]  Irrational methods have often amazingly good results, and the Hull Grammar School provided its head-master's only son with the rudiments of learning, thus enabling him to become in after years what John Milton himself, the author of that terrible _Treatise on Education_ addressed to Mr. Hartlibb, affirmed Andrew Marvell to be in a written testimonial, \"a scholar, and well-read in the Latin and Greek authors.\"  Attached to the Grammar School there was \"a great garden,\" renowned for its wall-fruit and flowers; so by leaving Winestead behind, our \"garden-poet,\" that was to be, was not deprived of inspiration.  Apart from these meagre facts, we know nothing of Marvell's boyhood at Hull. His clerical foe, Dr. Parker, afterwards Bishop of Oxford, writes contemptuously of \"an hunger-starved whelp of a country vicar,\" and in another passage, which undoubtedly refers to Marvell, he speaks of \"an unhappy education among Boatswains and Cabin-boys,\" whose unsavoury phrases, he goes on to suggest, Marvell picked up in his childhood. But truth need not be looked for in controversial pages. The best argument for a married clergy is to be found, for Englishmen at all events, in the sixty-seven volumes of the _Dictionary of National Biography_, where are recorded the services rendered to religion, philosophy, poetry, justice, and the empire by the \"whelps\" of many a country vicar. Parsons' wives may sometimes be trying and hard to explain, but an England without the sons of her clergy would be shorn of half her glory.  Marvell's boyhood seems to have been surrounded with the things that most make for a child's happiness. A sensible, affectionate, humorous, religious father, occupying a position of authority, and greatly respected, a mother and three elder sisters to make much of his bright wit and early adventures, a comfortable yet simple home, and an atmosphere of piety, learning, and good fellowship. What more is wanted, or can be desired? The \"Boatswains\" and \"Cabin-boys\" of Bishop Parker's fancy were in the neighbourhood, no doubt, and as stray companions for a half-holiday must have had their attractions; but it is unnecessary to attribute Andrew Marvell's style in controversy to his early acquaintance with a sea-faring population, for he is far more likely to have picked it up from his great friend and colleague, the author of _Paradise Lost_.  Marvell's school education over, he went up to Cambridge, not to his father's old college, but to the more splendid foundation of Trinity. About the date of his matriculation there is a doubt. In Wood's _Athenæ Oxonienses_ there is a note to the effect that Marvell was admitted \"in matriculam Acad. Cant. Coll. Trin.\" on the 14th of December 1633, when the boy was but twelve years old. Dr. Lort, a famous master of Trinity in his day, writing in November 1765 to Captain Edward Thompson, of whom more later on, told the captain that until 1635 there was no register of admissions of ordinary students, or pensioners, as they are called, but only a register of Fellows and Foundation Scholars, and in this last-named register Marvell's name appears as a Scholar sworn and admitted on the 13th of April 1638. As, however, Marvell took his B.A. degree in 1639, he must have been in residence long before April 1638. Probably Marvell went to Trinity about 1635, just before the register of pensioners was begun, as a pensioner, becoming a Scholar in 1638, and taking his degree in 1639.  Cambridge undergraduates do not usually keep diaries, nor after they have become Masters of Art are they much in the habit of giving details as to their academic career. Marvell is no exception to this provoking rule. He nowhere tells us what his University taught him or how. The logic of the schools he had no choice but to learn. Molineus, Peter Ramus, Seton, Keckerman were text-books of reputation, from one or another of which every Cambridge"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17388"],["title","Andrew Marvell (#2)"],["body","had to master his _simpliciters_, his _quids_, his _secundum quids_, his _quales_, and his _quantums_. Aristotle's Physics, Ethics, and Politics were \"tutor's books,\" and those young men who loved to hear themselves talk were left free to discuss, much to Hobbes's disgust, \"the freedom of the will, incorporeal substance, everlasting nows, ubiquities, hypostases, which the people understand not nor will ever care for.\"  In the life of Matthew Robinson,[11:1] who went up to Cambridge a little later than Marvell (June 1645), and was probably a harder reader, we are told that \"the strength of his studies lay in the metaphysics and in those subtle authors for many years which rendered him an irrefragable disputant _de quolibet ente_, and whilst he was but senior freshman he was found in the bachelor schools, disputing ably with the best of the senior sophisters.\" Robinson despised the old-fashioned Ethics and Physics, but with the new Cartesian or Experimental Philosophy he was _inter primos_. History, particularly the Roman, was in great favour at both Universities at this time, and young men were taught, so old Hobbes again grumbles, to despise monarchy \"from Cicero, Seneca, Cato and other politicians of Rome, and Aristotle of Athens, who seldom spake of kings but as of wolves and other ravenous beasts.\"[12:1] The Muses were never neglected at Cambridge, as the University exercises survive to prove, whilst modern languages, Spanish and Italian for example, were greedily acquired by such an eager spirit as Richard Crashaw, the poet, who came into residence at Pembroke in 1631. There were problems to be \"kept\" in the college chapel, lectures to be attended, both public and private, declamations to be delivered, and even in the vacations the scholars were not exempt from \"exercises\" either in hall or in their tutors' rooms. Earnest students read their Greek Testaments, and even their Hebrew Bibles, and filled their note-books, working more hours a day than was good for their health, whilst the idle ones wasted their time as best they could in an unhealthy, over-crowded town, in an age which knew nothing of boating, billiards, or cricket. A tennis-court there was in Marvell's time, for in Dr. Worthington's _Diary_, under date 3rd of April 1637, it stands recorded that on that day and in that place that learned man received \"a dangerous blow on the Eye.\"[12:2]  The only incident we know of Marvell's undergraduate days is remarkable enough, for, boy though he was, he seems, like the Gibbon of a later day, to have suddenly become a Roman Catholic. This occurrence may serve to remind us how, during Marvell's time at Trinity, the University of Cambridge (ever the precursor in thought-movements) had a Catholic revival of her own, akin to that one which two hundred years afterwards happened at Oxford, and has left so much agreeable literature behind it. Fuller in his history of the University of Cambridge tells us a little about this highly interesting and important movement:--     \"Now began the University (1633-4) to be much beautified in    buildings, every college either casting its skin with the snake, or    renewing its bill with the eagle, having their courts or at least    their fronts and Gatehouses repaired and adorned. But the greatest    alteration was in their Chapels, most of them being graced with the    accession of organs. And seeing musick is one of the liberal arts,    how could it be quarrelled at in an University if they sang with    understanding both of the matter and manner thereof. Yet some took    great distaste thereat as attendancie to superstition.\"[13:1]  The chapel at Peterhouse, we read elsewhere, which was built in 1632, and consecrated by Bishop White of Ely, had a beautiful ceiling and a noble east window. \"A grave divine,\" Fuller tells us, \"preaching before the University at St. Mary's, had this smart passage in his Sermon--that as at the Olympian Games he was counted the Conqueror who could drive his chariot wheels nearest the mark yet so as not to hinder his running or to stick thereon, so he who in his Sermons could preach _near Popery_ and yet _no Popery_, _there was your man_. And indeed it now began to be the general complaint of most moderate men that many in the University, both in the schools and pulpits, approached the opinions of the Church of Rome nearer than ever before.\"  Archbishop Laud, unlike the bishops of Dr. Newman's day, favoured the Catholic revival, and when Mr. Bernard, the lecturer of St. Sepulchre's, London, preached a \"No Popery\" sermon at St. Mary's, Cambridge, he was dragged into the High Commission Court, and, as the hateful practice then was, a practice dear to the soul of Laud, was bidden to subscribe a formal recantation. This Mr. Bernard refused to do, though professing his sincere sorrow and penitence for any oversights and hasty expressions in his sermon. Thereupon he was sent back to prison, where he died. \"If,\" adds Fuller, \"he was miserably abused in prison by the keepers (as some have reported) to the shortening of his life, He that maketh inquisition for blood either hath or will be a revenger thereof.\"[14:1]  By the side of this grim story the much-written-about incidents of the Oxford Movement seem trivial enough.  Not a few Cambridge scholars of this period, Richard Crashaw among the number, found permanent refuge in Rome.  The story of Marvell's conversion is emphatic but vague in its details. The \"Jesuits,\" who were well represented in Cambridge at the time, are said to have persuaded him to leave Cambridge secretly, and to take refuge in one of their houses in London. Thither the elder Marvell followed in pursuit, and after search came across his son in a bookseller's shop, where he succeeded both in convincing the boy of his errors and in persuading him to return to Trinity. An odd story, and not, as it stands, very credible; but Mr. Grosart discovered among the Marvell papers at Hull a fragment of a letter without signature, address, or date, which throws some sort of light on the incident. This letter was evidently, as Mr. Grosart surmises, sent to the elder Marvell by some similarly afflicted parent. In its fragmentary state the letter reads as follows:--     \"Worthy S^r,--M^r Breerecliffe being w^th me to-day, I related vnto    him a fearfull passage lately at Cambridg touching a sonne of mine,    Bachelor of Arts in Katherine Hall, w^ch was this. He was lately    inuited to a supper in towne by a gentlewoman, where was one M^r    Nichols a felow of Peterhouse, and another or two masters of arts, I    know not directly whether felowes or not: my sonne hauing noe    p'ferment, but liuing meerely of my penny, they pressed him much to    come to liue at their house, and for chamber and extraordinary bookes    they promised farre: and then earnestly moued him to goe to Somerset    house, where they could doe much for p'ferring him to some eminent    place, and in conclusion to popish arguments to seduce him soe rotten    and vnsauory as being ouerheard it was brought in question before the    heads of the Uniuersity: _Dr. Cosens_, being _Vice Chancelor_ noe    punishment is inioined him: but on Ash-wednesday next a recantation    in regent house of some popish tenets Nicols let fall: I p'ceive by    M^r Breercliffe some such prank vsed towards y^r sonne: I desire to    know what y^u did therin: thinking I cannot doe god better seruice    then bring it vppon the stage either in Parliament if it hold: or    informing some Lords of the Counsail to whom I stand much oblieged if    a bill in Starchamber be meete To terrify others by making these some    publique spectacle: for if such fearfull practises may goe vnpunished    I take care whether I may send a child ... the lord.\"[15:1]  The reference to Dr. Cosens, or Cosin, being Vice-Chancellor gives a clue to the date, for Cosin was chosen Vice-Chancellor on the 4th of November 1639.[15:2]  Though we can know nothing of the elder Marvell's methods of re-conversion, they were more successful than the elder Gibbon's, who, as we know, packed the future historian off to Lausanne and a Swiss pastor's house. What Gibbon became on leaving off his Romanism we can guess for ourselves, whereas Marvell, once out of the hands of these very shadowy \"Jesuits,\" remained the staunchest of Christian Protestants to the end of his days.  This strange incident, and two college exercises or poems, one in Greek, the other in Latin, both having reference to an addition to the Royal Family, and appearing in the _Musa Cantabrigiensis_ for 1637, are all the materials that exist for weaving the story of Marvell, the Cambridge undergraduate. The Latin verses, which are Horatian in style, contain one pretty stanza, composed apparently before the sex of the new-born infant was known at Cambridge.      \"Sive felici Carolum figurâ     Parvulus princeps imitetur almae     Sive Mariae decoret puellam                       Dulcis imago.\"  After taking his Bachelor's degree in 1639, Marvell, being still a Scholar of the college, must have gone away, for the Conclusion Book of Trinity, under date September 24, 1641, records as follows:--     \"It is agreed by y^e Master and 8 seniors y^t M^r Carter and D^r    Wakefields, D^r Marvell, D^r Waterhouse, and D^r Maye in regard y^t    some of them are reported to be married and y^t others look not after    y^eir days nor Acts shall receave no more benefitt of y^e Coll and    shall be out of y^ier places unless y^ei shew just cause to y^e Coll    for y^e contrary in 3 months.\"  Dr. Lort, in his amiable letter of 1765, already mentioned, points out that this entry contains no reflection on Marvell's morals, but shows that he was given \"notice to quit\" for non-residence, \"then much more strictly enjoined than it is now.\" The days referred to in the entry were, so the master obligingly explains, \"the certain number allowed by statute to absentees,\" whilst the \"acts mean the Exercises"]]]
