I know a place.\"  \"I'm drooling. Can I borrow your phone again? Uh, I think you're going to have to dial for me.\"  \"That's OK. Give me the number.\"  She did, and he cradled his comm to her head. He was close enough to her that he could hear the tinny, distinctive ringing of a namerican circuit at the other end. He heard her shallow breathing, heard her jaw creak. He smelled her shampoo, a free-polymer new-car smell, smelled a hint of her sweat. A cord stood out on her neck, merging in an elegant vee with her collarbone, an arrow pointing at the swell of her breast under her paper gown.  \"Toby, it's Linda.\"  A munchkin voice chittered down the line.  \"Shut up, OK. Shut up. Shut. I'm in the hospital.\" More chipmunk. \"Got hit by a car. I'll be OK. No. Shut up. I'll be fine. I'll send you the FAQs. I just wanted to say. . .\" She heaved a sigh, closed her eyes. \"You know what I wanted to say. Sorry, all right? Sorry it came to this. You'll be OK. I'll be OK. I just didn't want to leave you hanging.\" She sounded groggy, but there was a sob there, too. \"I can't talk long. I'm on a shitload of dope. Yes, it's good dope. I'll call you later. I don't know when I'm coming back, but we'll sort it out there, all right? OK. Shut up. OK. You too.\"  She looked up at Art. \"My boyfriend. Ex-boyfriend. Not sure who's leaving who at this point. Thanks.\" She closed her eyes. Her eyelids were mauve, a tracery of pink veins. She snored softly.  Art set an alarm that would wake him up in time to meet his lawyer, folded up his comm and crawled back into bed. His circadians swelled and crashed against the sides of his skull, and before he knew it, he was out.  6.  Hospitals operate around the clock, but they still have their own circadians. The noontime staff were still overworked and harried but chipper and efficient, too, without the raccoon-eyed jitters of the night before. Art and Linda were efficiently fed, watered and evacuated, then left to their own devices, blinking in the weak English sunlight that streamed through the windows.  \"The lawyers've worked it out, I think,\" Art said.  \"Good. Good news.\" She was dopamine-heavy, her words lizard-slow. Art figured her temper was drugged senseless, and it gave him the courage to ask her the question that'd been on his mind since they'd met.  \"Can I ask you something? It may be offensive.\"  \"G'head. I may be offended.\"  \"Do you do. . .this. . .a lot? I mean, the insurance thing?\"  She snorted, then moaned. \"It's the Los Angeles Lottery, dude. I haven't done it before, but I was starting to feel a little left out, to tell the truth.\"  \"I thought screenplays were the LA Lotto.\"  \"Naw. A good lotto is one you can win.\"  She favored him with half a smile and he saw that she had a lopsided, left-hand dimple.  \"You're from LA, then?\"  \"Got it in one. Orange County. I'm a third-generation failed actor. Grandpa once had a line in a Hitchcock film. Mom was the ditzy neighbor on a three-episode Fox sitcom in the 90s. I'm still waiting for my moment in the sun. You live here?\"  \"For now. Since September. I'm from Toronto.\"  \"Canadia! Goddamn snowbacks. What are you doing in London?\"  His comm rang, giving him a moment to gather his cover story. \"Hello?\"  \"Art! It's Fede!\" Federico was another provocateur in GMT. He wasn't exactly Art's superior -- the tribes didn't work like that -- but he had seniority.  \"Fede -- can I call you back?\"  \"Look, I heard about your accident, and I wouldn't have called, but it's urgent.\"  Art groaned and rolled his eyes in Linda's direction to let her know that he, too, was exasperated by the call, then retreated to the other side of his bed and hunched over.  \"What is it?\"  \"We've been sniffed. I'm four-fifths positive.\"  Art groaned again. Fede lived in perennial terror of being found out and exposed as an ESTribesman, fired, deported, humiliated. He was always at least three-fifths positive, and the extra fifth was hardly an anomaly. \"What's up now?\"  \"It's the VP of HR at Virgin/Deutsche Telekom. He's called me in for a meeting this afternoon. Wants to go over the core hours recommendation.\" Fede was a McKinsey consultant offline, producing inflammatory recommendation packages for Fortune 100 companies. He was working the lazy-Euro angle, pushing for extra daycare, time off for sick relatives and spouses. The last policy binder he'd dumped on V/DT had contained enough obscure leave-granting clauses that an employee who was sufficiently lawyer-minded could conceivably claim 450 days of paid leave a year. Now he was pushing for the abolishment of \"core hours,\" Corporate Eurospeak for the time after lunch but before afternoon naps when everyone showed up at the office, so that they could get some face-time. Enough of this, and GMT would be the laughingstock of the world, and so caught up in internecine struggles that the clear superiority of the stress-feeding EST ethos would sweep them away. That was the theory, anyway. Of course, there were rival Tribalists in every single management consulting firm in the world working against us. Management consultants have always worked on old-boys' networks, after all -- it was a very short step from interning your frat buddy to interning your Tribesman.  \"That's it? A meeting? Jesus, it's just a meeting. He probably wants you to reassure him before he presents to the CEO, is all.\"  \"No, I'm sure that's not it. He's got us sniffed -- both of us. He's been going through the product-design stuff, too, which is totally outside of his bailiwick. I tried to call him yesterday and his voicemail rolled over to a boardroom in O'Malley House.\" O'Malley House was the usability lab, a nice old row of connected Victorian townhouses just off Picadilly. It was where Art consulted out of. Also, two-hundred-odd usability specialists, product designers, experience engineers, cog-psych cranks and other tinkerers with the mind. They were the hairface hackers of Art's generation, unmanageable creative darlings -- no surprise that the VP of HR would have cause to spend a little face-time with someone there. Try telling Fede that, though.  \"All right, Fede, what do you want me to do?\"  \"Just -- Just be careful. Sanitize your storage. I'm pushing a new personal key to you now, too. Here, I'll read you the fingerprint.\" The key would be an unimaginably long string of crypto-gibberish, and just to make sure that it wasn't intercepted and changed en route, Fede wanted to read him a slightly less long mathematical fingerprint hashed out of it. Once it arrived, Art was supposed to generate a fingerprint from Fede's new key and compare it to the one that Fede wanted him to jot down.  Art closed his eyes and reclined. \"All right, I've got a pen,\" he said, though he had no such thing.  Fede read him the long, long string of digits and characters and he repeated them back, pretending to be noting them down. Paranoid bastard.  \"OK, I got it. I'll get you a new key later today, all right?\"  \"Do it quick, man.\"  \"Whatever, Fede. Back off, OK?\"  \"Sorry, sorry. Oh, and feel better, all right?\"  \"Bye, Fede.\"  \"What was *that*?\" Linda had her neck craned around to watch him.  He slipped into his cover story with a conscious effort. \"I'm a user-experience consultant. My coworkers are all paranoid about a deadline.\"  She rolled her eyes. \"Not another one. God. Look, we go out for dinner, don't say a word about the kerb design or the waiter or the menu or the presentation, OK? OK? I'm serious.\"  Art solemnly crossed his heart. \"Who else do you know in the biz?\"  \"My ex. He wouldn't or couldn't shut up about how much everything sucked. He was right, but so what? I wanted to enjoy it, suckitude and all.\"  \"OK, I promise. We're going out for dinner, then?\"  \"The minute I can walk, you're taking me out for as much flesh and entrails as I can eat.\"  \"It's a deal.\"  And then they both slept again.  7.  Met cute, huh? Linda was short and curvy, dark eyes and pursed lips and an hourglass figure that she thought made her look topheavy and big-assed, but I thought she was fabulous and soft and bouncy. She tasted like pepper, and her hair smelled of the abstruse polymers that kept it hanging in a brusque bob that brushed her firm, long jawline.  I'm getting a sunburn, and the pebbles on the roof are digging into my ass. I don't know if I'm going to push the pencil or not, but if I do, it's going to be somewhere more comfortable than this roof.  Except that the roof door, which I had wedged open before I snuck away from my attendants and slunk up the firecode-mandated stairwell, is locked. The small cairn of pebbles that I created in front of it has been strewn apart. It is locked tight. And me without my comm. Ah, me. I take an inventory of my person: a pencil, a hospital gown, a pair of boxer shorts and a head full of bad cess. I am 450' above the summery, muggy, verdant Massachusetts countryside. It is very hot, and I am turning the color of the Barbie aisle at FAO Schwartz, a kind of labial pink that is both painful and perversely cheerful.  I've spent my life going in the back door and coming out the side door. That's the way it is now. When it only takes two years for your job to morph into something that would have been unimaginable twenty-four months before, it's not really practical to go in through the front door. Not really practical to get the degree, the certification, the appropriate experience. I mean, even if you went back to university, the major you'd need by the time you graduated would be in a subject that hadn't been invented when you enrolled. So I'm good at back doors and side doors. It's what the Tribe does for me -- provides me with entries into places where I technically don't belong. And thank God for them, anyway. Without the Tribes, *no one* would be qualified to do *anything* worth doing.  Going out the side door has backfired on me today,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17028"],["title","Eastern Standard Tribe (#5)"],["body","gh.  Oh. Shit. I peer over the building's edge, down into the parking lot. The cars are thinly spread, the weather too fine for anyone out there in the real world to be visiting with their crazy relatives. Half a dozen beaters are parked down there, methane-breathers that the ESTalists call fartmobiles. I'd been driving something much the same on that fateful Leap Forward day in London. I left something out of my inventory: pebbles. The roof is littered, covered with a layer of gray, round riverstones, about the size of wasabi chickpeas. No one down there is going to notice me all the way up here. Not without that I give them a sign. A cracked windshield or two ought to do it.  I gather a small pile of rocks by the roof's edge and carefully take aim. I have to be cautious. Careful. A pebble dropped from this height -- I remember the stories about the penny dropped from the top of the CN Tower that sunk six inches into the concrete below.  I select a small piece of gravel and carefully aim for the windshield of a little blue Sony Veddic and it's bombs away. I can only follow the stone's progress for a few seconds before my eyes can no longer disambiguate it from the surrounding countryside. What little I do see of its trajectory is disheartening, though: the wind whips it away on an almost horizontal parabola, off towards Boston. Forgetting all about Newton, I try lobbing and then hurling the gravel downward, but it gets taken away, off to neverneverland, and the windscreens remain whole.  I go off to prospect for bigger rocks.  You know the sort of horror movie where the suspense builds and builds and builds, partially collapsed at regular intervals by something jumping out and yelling \"Boo!\" whereupon the heroes have to flee, deeper into danger, and the tension rises and rises? You know how sometimes the director just doesn't know when to quit, and the bogeymen keep jumping out and yelling boo, the wobbly bridges keep on collapsing, the small arms fire keeps blowing out more windows in the office tower?  It's not like the tension goes away -- it just get boring. Boring tension. You know that the climax is coming soon, that any minute now Our Hero will face down the archvillain and either kick his ass or have his ass kicked, the whole world riding on the outcome. You know that it will be satisfying, with much explosions and partial nudity. You know that afterward, Our Hero will retire to the space-bar and chill out and collect kisses from the love interest and that we'll all have a moment to get our adrenals back under control before the hand pops out of the grave and we all give a nervous jump and start eagerly anticipating the sequel.  You just wish it would *happen* already. You just wish that the little climaces could be taken as read, that the director would trust the audience to know that Our Hero really does wade through an entire ocean of shit en route to the final showdown.  I'm bored with being excited. I've been betrayed, shot at, institutionalized and stranded on the roof of a nuthouse, and I just want the fucking climax to come by and happen to me, so that I can know: smart or happy.  I've found a half-brick that was being used to hold down the tar paper around an exhaust-chimney. I should've used that to hold the door open, but it's way the hell the other side of the roof, and I'd been really pleased with my little pebbly doorstop. Besides, I'm starting to suspect that the doorjamb didn't fail, that it was sabotaged by some malevolently playful goon from the sanatorium. An object lesson or something.  I heft the brick. I release the brick. It falls, and falls, and falls, and hits the little blue fartmobile square on the trunk, punching a hole through the cheap aluminum lid.  And the fartmobile explodes. First there is a geyser of blue flame as the tank's puncture wound jets a stream of ignited assoline skyward, and then it blows back into the tank and *boom*, the fartmobile is in one billion shards, rising like a parachute in an updraft. I can feel the heat on my bare, sun-tender skin, even from this distance.  Explosions. Partial nudity. Somehow, though, I know that this isn't the climax.  8.  Linda didn't like to argue -- fight: yes, argue: no. That was going to be a problem, Art knew, but when you're falling in love, you're able to rationalize all kinds of things.  The yobs who cornered them on the way out of a bloody supper of contraband, antisocial animal flesh were young, large and bristling with testosterone. They wore killsport armor with strategic transparent panels that revealed their steroid-curdled muscles, visible through the likewise transparent insets they'd had grafted in place of the skin that covered their abs and quads. There were three of them, grinning and flexing, and they boxed in Art and Linda in the tiny, shuttered entrance of a Boots Pharmacy.  \"Evening, sir, evening, miss,\" one said.  \"Hey,\" Art muttered and looked over the yob's shoulder, trying to spot a secam or a cop. Neither was in sight.  \"I wonder if we could beg a favor of you?\" another said.  \"Sure,\" Art said.  \"You're American, aren't you?\" the third said.  \"Canadian, actually.\"  \"Marvelous. Bloody marvelous. I hear that Canada's a lovely place. How are you enjoying England?\"  \"I live here, actually. I like it a lot.\"  \"Glad to hear that, sir. And you, Miss?\"  Linda was wide-eyed, halfway behind Art. \"It's fine.\"  \"Good to hear,\" the first one said, grinning even more broadly. \"Now, as to that favor. My friends and I, we've got a problem. We've grown bored of our wallets. They are dull and uninteresting.\"  \"And empty,\" the third one interjected, with a little, stoned giggle.  \"Oh yes, and empty. We thought, well, perhaps you visitors from abroad would find them suitable souvenirs of England. We thought perhaps you'd like to trade, like?\"  Art smiled in spite of himself. He hadn't been mugged in London, but he'd heard of this. Ever since a pair of Manchester toughs had been acquitted based on the claim that their robbery and menacing of a Pakistani couple had been a simple cross-cultural misunderstanding, crafty British yobs had been taking off increasingly baroque scores from tourists.  Art felt the familiar buzz that meant he was about to get into an argument, and before he knew it, he was talking: \"Do you really think that'd hold up in court? I think that even the dimmest judge would be able to tell that the idea of a Canadian being mistaken about trading two wallets full of cash for three empty ones was in no way an error in cross-cultural communication. Really now. If you're going to mug us --\"  \"Mug you, sir? Dear oh dear, who's mugging you?\" the first one said.  \"Well, in that case, you won't mind if we say no, right?\"  \"Well, it would be rather rude,\" the first said. \"After all, we're offering you a souvenir in the spirit of transatlantic solidarity. Genuine English leather, mine is. Belonged to my grandfather.\"  \"Let me see it,\" Art said.  \"Beg pardon?\"  \"I want to see it. If we're going to trade, I should be able to examine the goods first, right?\"  \"All right, sir, all right, here you are.\"  The wallet was tattered and leather, and it was indeed made in England, as the frayed tag sewn into the billfold attested. Art turned it over in his hands, then, still smiling, emptied the card slot and started paging through the ID. \"Lester?\"  Lester swore under his breath. \"Les, actually. Hand those over, please -- they don't come with the wallet.\"  \"They don't? But surely a real British wallet is hardly complete without real British identification. Maybe I could keep the NHS card, something to show around to Americans. They think socialized medicine is a fairy tale, you know.\"  \"I really must insist, sir.\"  \"Fuck it, Les,\" the second one said, reaching into his pocket. \"This is stupid. Get the money, and let's push off.\"  \"It's not that easy any more, is it?\" the third one said. \"Fellow's got your name, Les. 'Sbad.\"  \"Well, yes, of course I do,\" Art said. \"But so what? You three are hardly nondescript. You think it'd be hard to pick your faces out of a rogues gallery? Oh, and wait a minute! Isn't this a trade? What happened to the spirit of transatlantic solidarity?\"  \"Right,\" Les said. \"Don't matter if you've got my name, 'cos we're all friends, right, sir?\"  \"Right!\" Art said. He put the tattered wallet in his already bulging jacket pocket, making a great show of tamping it down so it wouldn't come loose. Once his hand was free, he extended it. \"Art Berry. Late of Toronto. Pleased to meetcha!\"  Les shook his hand. \"I'm Les. These are my friends, Tony and Tom.\"  \"Fuck!\" Tom, the second one, said. \"Les, you stupid cunt! Now they got our names, too!\" The hand he'd put in his pocket came out, holding a tazer that sparked and hummed. \"Gotta get rid of 'em now.\"  Art smiled, and reached very slowly into his pocket. He pulled out his comm, dislodging Les's wallet so that it fell to the street. Les, Tom and Tony stared at the glowing comm in his hand. \"Could you repeat that, Tom? I don't think the 999 operator heard you clearly.\"  Tom stared dumbfounded at the comm, watching it as though it were a snake. The numbers \"999\" were clearly visible on its display, along with the position data that pinpointed its location to the meter. Les turned abruptly and began walking briskly towards the tube station. In a moment, Tony followed, leaving Tom alone, the tazer still hissing and spitting. His face contorted with frustrated anger, and he feinted with the tazer, barking a laugh when Art and Linda cringed back, then he took off at a good run after his mates.  Art clamped the comm to his head. \"They've gone away,\" he announced, prideful. \"Did you get that exchange? There were three of them and they've gone away.\"  From the comm came a tight, efficient voice, a male emergency operator. The speech was accented, and it took a moment to place it. Then Art remembered that the overnight emergency call-centers had been outsourced"]]]
