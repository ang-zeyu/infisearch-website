It was a system of self-government; we were not watched and punished and bound by rules, but graded and ruled ourselves--and the strange thing about it was that it worked! When the teacher went out of the room, everything went on just the same. Nobody left her desk or talked or idled; we just worked on, minding our own affairs; it was a great system.\"  Mrs. Tweed looked at her with a cynical smile. \"Some system!\" she cried mockingly; \"it may work in a school, where the little pinafore, pig-tail Minnies and Lucys gather; it won't work in life, where every one is grabbing for what he wants, and getting it some way. But see here,\" she cried suddenly, \"you haven't called me down yet! or told me I am a disgrace to the Patriotic Fund! or asked me what will my husband say when he comes home! You haven't looked shocked at one thing I've told you. Say, you should have seen old hatchet-face when I told her that I hoped the war would last forever! She said I was a wicked woman!\"  \"Well--weren't you?\" asked the president.  \"Sure I was--if I meant it--but I didn't. I wanted to see her jump, and she certainly jumped; and she soon gave me up and went back and reported. Then you were sent, and I guess you are about ready to give in.\"  \"Indeed, I am not,\" said the president, smiling. \"You are not a fool--I can see that--and you can think out these things for yourself. You are not accountable to me, anyway. I have no authority to find fault with you. If you think your part in this terrible time is to go the limit in fancy clothes, theaters, and late suppers with men of questionable character--that is for you to decide. I believe in the honor system. You are certainly setting a bad example--but you have that privilege. You cannot be sent to jail for it. The money you draw is hard-earned money--it is certainly sweated labor which our gallant men perform for the miserable little sum that is paid them. It is yours to do with as you like. I had hoped that more of you young women would have come to help us in our work in the Red Cross and other places. We need your youth, your enthusiasm, your prettiness, for we are sorely pressed with many cares and troubles, and we seem to be old sometimes. But you are quite right in saying that it is your own business how you spend the money!\"  After Mrs. Kent had gone, the younger woman sat looking around her flat with a queer feeling of discontent. A half-eaten box of chocolates was on the table and a new silk sweater coat lay across the lounge. In the tiny kitchenette a tap dripped with weary insistence, and unwashed dishes filled the sink. She got up suddenly and began to wash the dishes, and did not stop until every corner of her apartment was clean and tidy.  \"I am getting dippy,\" she said as she looked at herself in the mirror in the buffet; \"I've got to get out--this quiet life gets me. I'll go down to the _dansant_ this afternoon--no use--I can't stand being alone.\"  She put on her white suit, and dabbing rouge on her cheeks and penciling her eyes, she went forth into the sunshiny streets.  She stopped to look at a display of sport suits in a window, also to see her own reflection in a mirror placed for the purpose among the suits.  Suddenly a voice sounded at her elbow: \"Some kid, eh? Looking good enough to eat!\"  She turned around and met the admiring gaze of Sergeant Edward Loftus Brown, recruiting sergeant of the 19-th, with whom she had been to the theater a few nights before. She welcomed him effusively.  \"Come on and have something to eat,\" he said. \"I got three recruits to-day--so I am going to proclaim a half-holiday.\"  They sat at a table in an alcove and gayly discussed the people who passed by. The President of the Red Cross came in, and at a table across the room hastily drank a cup of tea and went out again.  \"She came to see me to-day,\" said Mrs. Tweed, \"and gave me to understand that they were not any too well pleased with me--I am too gay for a soldier's wife! And they do not approve of you.\"  Sergeant Brown smiled indulgently and looked at her admiringly through his oyster-lidded eyes. His smile was as complacent as that of the ward boss who knows that the ballot-box is stuffed. It was the smile of one who can afford to be generous to an enemy.  \"Women are always hard on each other,\" he said soothingly; \"these women do not understand you, Trixie, that's all. No person understands you but me.\" His voice was of the magnolia oil quality.  \"Oh, rats!\" she broke out. \"Cut that understanding business! She understands me all right--she knows me for a mean little selfish slacker who is going to have a good time no matter what it costs. I have been like a bad kid that eats the jam when the house is burning! But remember this, I'm no fool, and I'm not going to kid myself into thinking it is anything to be proud of, for it isn't.\"  Sergeant Brown sat up straight and regarded her critically. \"What have you done,\" he said, \"that she should call you down for it? You're young and pretty and these old hens are jealous of you. They can't raise a good time themselves and they're sore on you because all the men are crazy about you.\"  \"Gee, you're mean,\" Mrs. Tweed retorted, \"to talk that way about women who are giving up everything for their country. Mrs. Kent's two boys are in the trenches, actually fighting, not just parading round in uniform like you. She goes every day and works in the office of the Red Cross and tries to keep every tangle straightened out. She's not jealous of me--she despises me for a little feather-brained pinhead. She thinks I am even worse than I am. She thinks I am as bad as you would like me to be! Naturally enough, she judges me by my company.\"  Sergeant Brown's face flushed dull red, but she went on: \"That woman is all right--take it from me.\"  \"Well, don't get sore on me,\" he said quickly; \"I'm not the one who is turning you down. I've always stuck up for you and you know it!\"  \"Why shouldn't you?\" she cried. \"You know well that I am straight, even if I am a fool. These women are out of patience with me and my class----\"  \"Men are always more charitable to women than women are to each other, anyway--women are cats, mostly!\" he said, as he rolled a cigarette.  \"There you go again!\" she cried,--\"pretending that you know. I tell you women are women's best friends. What help have you given to me to run straight, for all your hot air about thinking so much of me? You've stuck around my flat until I had to put you out--you've never sheltered or protected me in any way. Men are broad-minded toward women's characters because they do not care whether women are good or not--they would rather that they were not. I do not mean all men,--William was different, and there are plenty like him--but I mean men like you who run around with soldiers' wives and slam the women who are our friends, and who are really concerned about us. You are twenty years older than I am. You're always blowing about how much you know about women--also the world. Why didn't you advise me not to make a fool of myself?\"  Sergeant Brown leaned over and patted her hand. \"There now, Trixie,\" he said, \"don't get excited; you're the best girl in town, only you're too high-strung. Haven't I always stood by you? Did I ever turn you down, even when these high-brow ladies gave you the glassy eye? Why are you going back on a friend now? You had lots to say about the Daughter of the Empire who came to see you the last time.\"  \"She wasn't nice to me,\" said Mrs. Tweed; \"but she meant well, anyway. But I'm getting ashamed of myself now--for I see I am not playing the game. Things have gone wrong through no fault of ours. The whole world has gone wrong, and it's up to us to bring it right if we can. These women are doing their share--they've given up everything. But what have I done? I let William go, of course, and that's a lot, for I do think a lot of William; but I am not doing my own share. Running around to the stores, eating late suppers, saying snippy things about other women, and giving people an excuse for not giving to the Patriotic Fund. You and I sitting here to-day, eating expensive things, are not helping to win the war, I can tell you.\"  \"But my dear girl,\" he interrupted, \"whose business is it? and what has happened to you anyway? I didn't bring you here to tell me my patriotic duty. I like you because you amuse me with your smart speeches. I don't want to be lectured--and I won't have it.\"  Mrs. Tweed arose and began to put on her gloves. \"Here's where we part,\" she said; \"I am going to begin to do my part, just as I see it. I've signed on--I've joined the great Win-the-War-Party. You should try it, Sergeant Brown. We have no exact rules to go by--we are self-governed. It is called the honor system; each one rules himself. It's quite new to me, but I expect to know more about it.\"  \"Sit down!\" he said sternly; \"people are looking at you--they think we are quarreling; I am not done yet, and neither are you. Sit down!\"  She sat down and apologized. \"I am excited, I believe,\" she said; \"people generally are when they enlist; and although I stood up, I had no intention of going, for the bill has not come yet and I won't go without settling my share of it.\"  \"Forget it!\" he said warmly; \"this isn't a Dutch treat. What have I done that you should hit me a slam like this?\"  \"It isn't a slam,\" she said; \"it is quite different. I want to run straight and fair--and I can't do it and let you pay for my meals; there's no sense in women being sponges. I know we have been brought up to beat our way. 'Be pretty, and all things will be added unto you,' is the first commandment, and the one with the promise. I've laid hold on that all my life, but to-day I am giving it up. The old way of training women nearly got me, but not quite--and now I am making a new start. It isn't too late. The old way of women always being under an obligation to men has started us wrong. I'm not blaming you or any one, but I'm "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16572"],["title","Indians of the Yosemite Valley and Vicinity (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: _Photograph by Taber_.]  [Signature: Galen Clark]      INDIANS OF THE YOSEMITE VALLEY AND VICINITY  Their History, Customs and Traditions  BY GALEN CLARK   Author of \"Big Trees of California,\" Discoverer of the Mariposa Grove of Big Trees, and for many years Guardian of the Yosemite Valley.

The Indians of the Yosemite are fast passing away. Only a handful now remain of the powerful tribes that once gathered in the Valley and considered it an absolute stronghold against their white enemies. Even in their diminished numbers and their comparatively civilized condition, they are still a source of great interest to all visitors, and it has been suggested many times that their history, customs and legends should be put in permanent and convenient form, before they are entirely lost.  Many tales and histories of the California Indians have been written by soldiers and pioneers, but Mr. Clark has told the story of these people from their own standpoint, and with a sympathetic understanding of their character. This fresh point of view gives double interest to his narrative.  Galen Clark comes of a notable family; his English ancestors came to the State of Massachusetts in the seventeenth century, but he is a native of the Town of Dublin, Cheshire County, New Hampshire, born on the 28th day of March, 1814, and is consequently nearly ninety years of age, but still alert and active in mind and body.  He attended school in his early youth during the winter months, and worked on a farm during the summer, leading nearly the same life which was followed by so many others who afterwards became famous in our country's history.  Later in life he learned chair-making and painting, an occupation which he followed for some years, when he removed to Philadelphia and subsequently to New York City.  Whilst residing in New York, in 1853, he resolved, after mature reflection, to visit the new Eldorado. His attention was first attracted to this State by visiting the celebrated Crystal Palace in New York, where was then on exhibition quantities of gold dust which had been sent or brought East by successful miners.  Mr. Clark left New York for California in October, 1853, coming via the Isthmus of Panama, and in due time reached his destination. In 1854 he went to Mariposa County, attracted thither by the wonderful accounts of the gold discoveries, and the marvelous stories he had heard of the grandeur and beauty of the Yosemite Valley and the surrounding mountains.  Upon his first arrival in Mariposa, he engaged in mining, and was also employed to assist in surveying Government land on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley, and canals for mining purposes, some of which passed through the celebrated \"Mariposa Grant,\" the subject of prolonged and bitter litigation, both in this country and in Europe. He probably knows more about the actual facts concerning the Mariposa Grant than any one now living, and it is to be hoped that some day he may overcome his natural repugnance to notoriety, and give to the public the benefit of his knowledge.  In the year 1855 Mr. Clark made his first trip into the Yosemite Valley with a party made up in Mariposa and Bear Valley.  Returning to Mariposa, he resumed his old occupation of surveying and mining, and, whilst so engaged, by reason of exposure, had a serious attack of lung trouble, resulting in severe hemorrhages which threatened to end his life.  He then removed, in April, 1857, to the South Fork of the Merced River, and built a log cabin in one of the most beautiful of our mountain valleys, on the spot where Wawona now stands. He soon recovered his health entirely, and, though constantly exposed to the winter storms and snows, has never had a recurrence of his malady.  Wawona is twenty-six miles from Yosemite, and at that time became known as Clark's Station, being on the trail leading from Mariposa to the Valley, and a noted stopping place for travelers. This trail, as well as one from Coulterville, was completed to the Valley in 1857, and the trip to Yosemite then involved a stage ride of ninety-two miles, and a journey of sixty miles more on horseback. In 1874 and 1875 the three present stage roads were constructed through to the Valley.  All travelers by the Raymond route will remember Wawona and the surroundings; the peaceful valley, the swift-flowing Merced, and the surrounding peaks and mountains, almost equaling in grandeur the famous Yosemite itself.  In the early days this locality was annually visited by several bands of Indians from the Chowchilla and Fresno rivers. The Indian name for the place was Pal-lah´-chun. Whilst residing there Mr. Clark was in constant contact with these visiting tribes; he obtained their confidence, and retains it to this day.  Whilst on a hunting trip, in the summer of 1857, Mr. Clark discovered and made known to the public the famous Big Tree Grove, now known all over the world as the \"Mariposa Grove of Big Trees,\" belonging to the State of California. On this expedition he did not follow the route now traveled, but came upon the grove at the upper end, near the place where the road to Wawona Point now branches off from the main drive. The spot where he caught his first view of the Big Trees has been appropriately marked, and can be seen from the stage road.  So impressed was Mr. Clark with the importance of his discovery, that he opened up a good horse trail from Wawona to the Trees, and shortly afterwards built a log cabin in the grove, for the comfort and convenience of visitors in bad or stormy weather. This cabin became known as \"Galen's Hospice.\"  In the year 1864 the Congress of the United States passed an Act, which was approved in June of the same year, granting to the State of California the \"Yosemite Valley\" and the \"Mariposa Grove of Big Trees.\" This grant was made upon certain conditions, which were complied with by the State, and a Commission was appointed by Governor Low to manage and govern the Valley and the Big Tree Grove. Galen Clark was, of course, selected as one of the commissioners. He was subsequently appointed Guardian of the Valley, and under his administration many needed improvements were made and others suggested. Bridges were built, roads constructed on the floor of the Valley, and trails laid out and finished to various points of interest overlooking the Valley itself. In a word, the Guardian did everything possible with the limited means at his disposal.  After serving twenty-four years, Mr. Clark voluntarily retired from the position of Guardian, carrying with him the respect and admiration of every member of the Commission, of all the residents of the Valley, and of every visitor who enjoyed the pleasure of his personal acquaintance.  As showing the opinion of those with whom Mr. Clark was intimately and officially associated for so long a time, the following resolutions passed by the Board of Commissioners upon"]]]
