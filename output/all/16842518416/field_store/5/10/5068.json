The great Canal of _Languedoc_ has a communication with this town, where covered boats, neatly fitted up for passengers, are continually passing up and down that wonderful and artificial navigation. It is a convenient port to ship wine at; but the people have the reputation of playing tricks with it, before and after it is put on board; and this opinion is a great baulk to the trade it is so happily situated to carry on, and of great benefit to the free port of _Nice_.     LETTER XIV.  PERPIGNAN.   DEAR SIR,  Before I leave this kingdom, and enter into that of Spain, let me trouble you with a letter on a subject which, though no ways interesting to yourself, may be very much so _to a young Gentleman of your acquaintance_ at Oxford, for whose happiness I, as well as you, am a little anxious. It is to apprize you, and to warn him, when he travels, to avoid the _gins and man-traps_ fixed all over this country; traps, which a thorough knowledge of Latin and Greek, combined even with father and mother's wit, will not be sufficient to preserve him from, unless he is first shewn the manner in which they are set. These traps are not made to catch the legs, but to ruin the fortunes and break the hearts of those who unfortunately step into them. Their baits are artful, designing, wicked men, and profligate, abandoned, and prostitute women. Paris abounds with them, as well as Lyons, and all the great towns between London and Rome; and are principally set to catch the young Englishman of fortune from the age of eighteen to five and twenty; and what is worse, an honest, sensible, generous young man, is always in most danger of setting his foot into them. You suspect already, that these traps are made only of paper, and ivory, and that cards and dice are the destructive engines I mean. Do you know that there are a set of men and women, in _Paris_ and _Lyons_, who live elegantly by lying in wait and by catching every _bird of passage_?--but particularly the English _gold-finch_. I have seen and heard of such wicked artifices of these people, and the fatal consequences to the unfortunate young men they have ensnared, that I really think I could never enjoy a single hour of contentment, if I had a large fortune, while a son of mine was making what is called the tour of Europe. The minute one of these young men arrive, either at _Paris_ or _Lyons_, some _laquais de place_, who is paid for it, gives the earliest notice to one of the confederacy, and he is instantly way-laid by a French _Marquis_, or an English _Chevalier d'Industrie_, who, with a most insinuating address, makes him believe, he is no sooner arrived at _Paris_ than he has found a sincere friend. The _Chevalier_ shews him what is most worthy of notice in _Paris_, attends him to _Versailles_ and _Marly_, cautions him against being acquainted with the honest part of the French nation, and introduces him to the knaves only of his own and this country; carries him to see French Ladies of the _first distinction_, (and such who certainly _live in that style_) and makes the young man giddy with joy. But alas! it is but a short-lived one!--he is invited; to sup with the _Countess_; and is entertained not only voluptuously, but they play after supper, and he wins too. What can be more delightful to a young man, in a strange country, than to be flattered by the French, courted by the English, entertained by _the Countess_, and cheered with success?--Nay, he flatters himself, from the particular _attention_ the _Countess_ shews him, above all other men admitted to her toilet, that she has even some _tendre_ for his person:--just at this _critical moment_, a _Toyman arrives_, to shew _Madame la Comtesse_ a new fashioned trinket; she likes it, but has not money enough in her pocket to pay for it:--here is a fine opportunity to make Madame la Comtesse a present;--and why should not he?--the price is not above four or five guineas more than his last night's winnings;--he offers it; and, with _great difficulty_ and much persuasion, she accepts it; but is quite _ashamed_ to think of the trouble he has given himself:--but, says she, you Englishmen are so charming,--so generous,--and so--so--and looks so sweet upon him, that while her tongue faulters, _egad_ he ventures to cover her confusion by a kiss;--when, instead of giving him the two broad sides of her cheek, she is so _off her guard_, and so overcome, as to present him _unawares_, with a pretty handsome dash of red pomatum from her lovely pouting lips,--and insists upon it that he sups with her, _tete a tete_, that very evening,--when all this happiness is compleated. In a few nights after, he is invited to meet the _Countess_, and to sup with _Monsieur le Marquis_, or _Monsieur le Chevalier Anglais_; he is feasted with high meat, and inflamed with delicious wines;--they play after supper, and he is stript of all his money, and gives--drafts upon his Banker for all his credit. He visits the Countess the next day; she receives him with a civil coolness,--is very sorry, she says,--and wished much last night for a favourable opportunity to give him a hint, not to play after he had lost the first thousand, as she perceived luck ran hard against him:--she is extremely mortified;--but; as a friend, advises him to go to _Lyons_, or some provincial town, where he may study the language with more success, than in the hurry and noise of so great a city as _Paris_, and apply for further credit. His _new friends_ visit him no more; and he determines to take the Countess's advice, and go on to _Lyons_, as he has heard the South of France is much cheaper, and there he may see what he can do, by leaving Paris, and an application to his friends in England. But at _Lyons_ too, some artful knave, of one nation or the other, accosts him, who has had notice of his _Paris_ misfortunes;--he pities him;--and, rather than see a countryman, or a gentleman of fashion and character in distress, he would lend him fifty or a hundred pounds. When this is done, every art is used to debauch his principles; he is initiated into a gang of genteel sharpers, and bullied, by the fear of a gaol, to connive at, or to become a party in their iniquitous society. His good name gives a sanction for a while to their suspected reputations; and, by means of an hundred pounds so lent to this honest young man, some thousands are won from the _birds of passage_, who are continually passing thro' that city to the more southern parts of _France_, or to _Italy_, _Geneva_, or _Turin_.  This is not an imaginary picture; it is a picture I have seen, nay, I have seen the traps set, and the game caught; nor were those who set the snares quite sure that they might not put a stop to my peregrination, for they _risqued a supper at me_, and let me win a few guineas at the little play which began before they sat down to table. Indeed, my dear Sir, were I to give you the particulars of some of those unhappy young men, who have been ruined in fortune and constitution too, at _Paris_ and _Lyons_, you would be struck with pity on one side, and horror and detestation on the other; nor would ever risque such a _finished part_ of your son's education. Tell my Oxonian friend, from me, when he travels, never to let either Lords or Ladies, even of his own country, nor _Marquises_, _Counts_, or _Chevaliers_, of this, ever draw him into play; but to remember that shrewd hint of Lord Chesterfield's to his son;--\"When you play with men (says his Lordship) know with _whom_ you play; when with women, _for what_ you play.\"--But let me add, that the only SURE WAY, is never to play at all.  At one of these towns I found a man, whose family I respected, and for whom I had a personal regard; he loaded me with civilities, nay, made me presents, before I had the most distant suspicions _how_ he became in a situation to enable him so to do. He made every profession of love and regard to me; and I verily believed him sincere; because I knew he had been obliged by a part of my family; but when I found a coach, a country-house, a good table, a wife, and servants, were all supported by the _chance_ of a gaming-table, I withdrew myself from all connections with him; for, I fear, he who lives to play, may _play_ to _live_.  Upon the whole, I think it is next to an impossibility for a young man of fortune to pass a year or two in _Paris_, the southern parts of France, Italy, &c. without running a great risque of being beggared by sharpers, or seduced by artful women; unless he has with him a tutor, who is made wise by years, and a frequent acquaintance with the customs and manners of the country: an honest, learned Clergyman tutor, is of less use to a young man in that situation, than a trusty _Valet de Chambre_. A travelling tutor must know men; and, what is more difficult to know, he must know women also, before he is qualified to guard against the innumerable snares that are always making to entangle strangers of fortune.  It is certainly true, that the nearer we approach to the sun, the more we become familiar with vices of every kind. In the _South of France_, and _Italy_, sins of the blackest dye, and many of the most unnatural kind, are not only committed with impunity, but boasted of with audacity; and, as one proof of the corruption of the people, of a thousand I could tell you, I must tell you, that seeing at _Lyons_ a shop in which a great variety of pictures were hung for sale, I walked in, and after examining them, and asking a few questions; but none that had the least tendency to want of decorum, the master of the shop turned to his wife, (a very pretty woman, and dressed even to a _plumed_ head)--shew _Monsieur_ the little miniature, said he; she then opened a drawer and took out a book, (I think it was her mass-book) and brought me a picture, so indecent, that I defy the most"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16487"],["title","The Story of the Living Machine (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net        THE STORY OF THE LIVING MACHINE  A REVIEW OF THE CONCLUSIONS OF MODERN BIOLOGY IN REGARD TO THE MECHANISM WHICH CONTROLS THE PHENOMENA OF LIVING ACTIVITY  BY  H.W.

APPLETON AND COMPANY 1903  COPYRIGHT, 1899, By D. APPLETON AND COMPANY.      PREFACE.   That the living body is a machine is a statement that is frequently made without any very accurate idea as to what it means. On the one hand it is made with a belief that a strict comparison can be made between the body and an ordinary, artificial machine, and that living beings are thus reduced to simple mechanisms; on the other hand it is made loosely, without any special thought as to its significance, and certainly with no conception that it reduces life to a mechanism. The conclusion that the living body is a machine, involving as it does a mechanical conception of life, is one of most extreme philosophical importance, and no one interested in the philosophical conception of nature can fail to have an interest in this problem of the strict accuracy of the statement that the body is a machine. Doubtless the complete story of the living machine can not yet be told; but the studies of the last fifty years have brought us so far along the road toward its completion that a review of the progress made and a glance at the yet unexplored realms and unanswered questions will be profitable. For this purpose this work is designed, with the hope that it may give a clear idea of the trend of recent biological science and of the advances made toward the solution of the problem of life.

INTRODUCTION.  ==Biology a New Science==.--In recent years biology has been spoken of as a new science. Thirty years ago departments of biology were practically unknown in educational institutions. To-day none of our higher institutions of learning considers itself equipped without such a department. This seems to be somewhat strange. Biology is simply the study of living things; and living nature has been studied as long as mankind has studied anything. Even Aristotle, four hundred years before Christ, classified living things. From this foundation down through the centuries living phenomena have received constant attention. Recent centuries have paid more attention to living things than to any other objects in nature. Linnæus erected his systems of classification before modern chemistry came into existence; the systematic study of zoology antedated that of physics; and long before geology had been conceived in its modern form, the animal and vegetable kingdoms had been comprehended in a scientific system. How, then, can biology be called a new science When it is older than all the others?  There must be some reason why this, the oldest of all, has been recently called a _new_ science, and some explanation of the fact that it has only recently advanced to form a distinct department in our educational system. The reason is not difficult to find. Biology is a new science, not because the objects it studies are new, but because it has adopted a new relation to those objects and is studying them from a new standpoint. Animals and plants have been studied long enough, but not as we now study them. Perhaps the new attitude adopted toward living nature may be tersely expressed by saying that in the past it has been studied as _at rest_, while to-day it is studied as _in motion_. The older zoologists and botanists confined themselves largely to the study of animals and plants simply as so many museum specimens to be arranged on shelves with appropriate names. The modern biologist is studying these same objects as intensely active beings and as parts of an ever-changing history. To the student of natural history fifty years ago, animals and plants were objects to be _classified_; to the biologist of to-day, they are objects to be _explained_.  To understand this new attitude, a brief review of the history of the fundamental features of philosophical thought will be necessary. When, long ago, man began to think upon the phenomena of nature, he was able to understand almost nothing. In his inability to comprehend the activities going on around him he came to regard the forces of nature as manifestations of some supernatural beings. This was eminently natural. He had a direct consciousness of his own power to act, and it was natural for him to assume that the activities going on around him were caused by similar powers on the part of some being like himself, only superior to him. Thus he came to"]]]
