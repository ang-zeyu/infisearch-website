The whites had stopped near a spot where a few rays of moonlight fell upon the trail, giving them a faint but needed view of the direction from which the danger threatened.  Neither spoke again, but with the utmost care and noiselessness, they stepped aside from the path and crouched among the undergrowth.  They had barely time to ensconce themselves in their new position, when the footfalls sounded more distinctly than before, and something in the nature of an exclamation was heard from one of the approaching savages.  It sounded more like the grunt of a pig than anything the listeners could call to mind, and Ashman feared it was notice of one warrior to his companions that he had discovered something amiss.  But if such were the fact, the natives would have stopped, while the cat-like steps were more audible than before, though the wonder to the watchers was that the parties continued invisible.  The eyes of both remained fixed on the faintly illuminated space, where they expected to catch sight of them, but the straining gaze failed to detect the most shadowy form.  Ashman was just beginning to suspect some strange mistake had been made, when he suddenly saw the form of a tall savage with bushy head and a javelin in his hand, glide like a shadow into the darkness in front.  A moment after, a second followed, then a third, fourth and fifth, the last carrying a long-bow, and all plainly seen by the whites at the side of the trail.  A few minutes later, Fred once more took the advance, reflecting that they were as likely to meet more of the natives as to have them overtake them.  The mystery was where they had come from in the first place.  They could not have entered the trail at the camp where Ashman and Johnston had started on their little exploring enterprise.  It looked as though they were hiding among the trees at the time the canoe approached the land, and may have followed the explorers soon after they started along the path with the purpose of cutting off their retreat.  If such should prove to be the case, Fred felt that not only he and his companion were in danger, but all the rest were liable to be attacked by these natives, who, as has been stated, were the most athletic that had been encountered since leaving the Amazon.  \"Fred,\" whispered the sailor a little later, \"they've turned back and are following us again.\"  \"Are you sure of it?\"  \"There's no mistake about it.\"  Fred was debating whether they should not turn again from the path, but he reflected that the natives having discovered the trick played on them, would be likely to defeat such a piece of strategy.  Before he could decide upon the best course, Johnston whispered:  \"Run! it's the only chance we've got!\"     CHAPTER VII  DESPERATE WORK.  It seemed to be the only course left.  Whether it was or not, it was too late to try anything else.  That the natives had discovered the explorers was proven by several low, tremulous whistles which at that instant sounded on the night.  It was risky running along the dark trail, even though illuminated here and there by the rays of the moon: but, feeling that the situation was desperate, Ashman broke into a swift lope, with Johnston at his heels, urging him to make haste.  \"If they come too close,\" thought the young man, \"we can dodge among the trees again and pick our way back to the river as best we can--helloa! what's that?\"  Well might he ask himself the question, for the whizz of something close to his ear left no doubt that one of their pursuers had hurled a poisoned javelin at them.  An instant after he heard a faint but peculiar noise which he could not describe nor identify.  Johnston at the same instant uttered a suppressed exclamation, not intended for his ears, and he called out in a recklessly loud voice,  \"Into the woods, quick!\"  Ashman did not hesitate, but darted to his right, halting after a couple of steps, through fear of betraying himself.  \"Where are you?\" asked Johnston, speaking more guardedly.  His groping hand touched Ashman, who seized it and silently drew him forward, neither speaking again.  Even in that trying moment, the younger was impressed by the singularity of his friend's actions, though there was no opportunity to ask an explanation.  The savages could be plainly heard, as they hurried past, evidently believing they would overtake the fugitives the next minute and certain of locating them, wherever they might be.  Sure enough, they had not gone fifty feet, when they detected the trick and turned about to catch the whites before they could steal any distance from the trail.  \"We must leave,\" said Ashman; \"we are too close to the path, and they are sure to find us.\"  Johnston made no answer, and, instead of following him, sank heavily to the ground, with a groan.  \"Great heaven! what is the matter, Aaron?\" gasped his friend.  \"I'm done for,\" was the feeble reply; \"never mind me: look--out--for--for--good-bye!\"  Struck almost dumb by an awful fear, Fred forgot the natives for the time and stooped over his friend.  It was as he suspected; the poor fellow had been struck full in the back by one of the poisoned javelins.  The exclamation which he uttered at the moment of receiving the wound was that which puzzled Ashman.  The sailor had withdrawn the weapon, and the wound bled but little.  The young man, however, identified it on the instant.  \"Aaron, rouse up!\" he called, shaking his shoulder; \"fight off your drowsiness!\"  He suddenly ceased, for at that moment, he realized that his companion was dead.  Thus fearfully did the virus do its work.  Before Ashman, could do more than rally from his shock, a muttered exclamation at his elbow announced that the savages had located him.  \"Curse you!\" he exclaimed, whipping out his revolver and letting fly in the dark at the point where he knew several of his foes were standing, waiting for a chance to hurl their missiles at him.  A screech announced that the bullet had found its mark, and he followed it with a couple more shots, which inflicted wounds, even if they caused no mortal ones.  The effect of this volley was to throw the natives into consternation and panic.  There is nothing go appalling as an unknown peril, and the flashes of fire lighting up the gloom sent them flying toward their village.  The path was open for the young man's escape, but could he leave the body of his friend behind?  Alas! it was that all he could do, and unless that were done within the next few minutes, it would be too late.  Stooping over, he grasped the shoulders of the body and drew it further from the path, in the hope that it would remain unnoticed.  Then he loosed the Winchester from the death grip, removed the revolver, and stepping back into the trail, started on his sorrowful return to his friends.  \"I wish they would follow me,\" he muttered; glaring into the gloom behind him; \"the man they have killed is worth more than the whole tribe of miscreants.\"  He was in a savage mood, and, despite the fearful danger from the poisoned arrows and spears, he yearned for another chance at the wretches who fought so unfairly.  He held a couple of loaded and repeating Winchesters, with which he could pour the most destructive of volleys among the savages, and he longed for the opportunity; but the profound silence which followed the fierce encounter was so striking that to Fred it all seemed like some horrid vision of sleep.  But he dare not wait.  These wretches had come from the direction of the Xingu, and he was apprehensive of trouble at the camp, where the three native attendants had been left.  His services might be needed at that very moment.  He did not run, but advanced with the stealth of an American Indian stealing upon an enemy.  It seemed to him his senses were strung to a higher pitch than ever before, for he had not walked far, when he became aware that some one was ahead of him, in the path and travelling in the same direction.  As yet he could catch no glimpse of the stranger, but there could be no mistake about the stealthy tread.  He was sure, too, that sooner or later the broken rays of moonlight would give him the sight for which he was waiting.  \"Yonder is a spot where he will betray himself,\" he added a moment later, as he observed the faint light ahead.  Instead of following on, Fred paused and laying the rifle of his dead friend on the ground he knelt and sighted his own piece as best he could in the darkness.  Where the hunter is placed in such a situation he instinctively _feels_ how to aim his weapon.  He was not kept long waiting.  A dark form became dimly outlined in the faint moonlight and an instant later the infuriated Ashman fired.  The rasping screech which followed was enough to curdle one's blood, but the young man only uttered an exclamation of disgust.  He had driven a ball through the vitals of a South American cougar, instead of through one of the natives, a score of whom he gladly would have wiped out of existence had he possessed the power.  The shot could not have been better aimed, had the sun been shining. The furious beast dropped in the middle of the path, rolled over on his back, clawed the air for a moment or two, and then became motionless. Had not Ashman been on the lookout when he reached the spot, he would have stumbled over the carcass.  \"It is only so much ammunition thrown away,\" he muttered, again glaring into the gloom behind him, in the hope of catching sight or sound of his pursuers; but they were too thoroughly panic-stricken by the frightful experience a few minutes before to trouble the white man for some time to come.  The dull roar of the rapids grew plainer, and, increasing his pace, he had but to walk a short distance when the clear moonlight, unobstructed by cloud or vegetation, was discerned where the path debouched from the forest.  The feeling that something had gone amiss in the camp during his absence was so strong with Ashman that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16855"],["title","The Land of Mystery (#6)"],["body","slowed his walk and stopped before emerging from the wood.  He paused, however, at a point where he had a full view not only of the camp but of the river and dark shore beyond.  The sight which met his gaze was not calculated to soothe his nerves. From some cause Bippo, Pedros and Quincal seemed to have been seized with a panic, hardly less than that produced among their countrymen by the discharge of the firearms of Ashman.  They were in the act of shoving the canoe back into the water in such haste that there could be no doubt they intended to flee from some enemy that had driven all thoughts of resistance out of their minds.  \"What the mischief are you doing?\" shouted the young man, dashing from cover and hurrying down the bank to intercept them before they could get away.     CHAPTER VIII.  THE LAND OF MYSTERY.  The peremptory tones of Fred Ashman rang out loud and clear above the roar of the rapids and caused the servants to halt at the moment the canoe was shoved into the water.  They looked up with frightened expressions and awaited his approach.  \"What do you mean?\" he demanded as he drew near.  Bippo, who was by far the brightest of the three, had shown a wonderful readiness in picking up a knowledge of the English tongue.  He was so much superior in that respect to his companions, that they invariably left to him the duty of conversing with their masters.  \"_Dey're_ ober dere,\" he replied, pointing to the other shore.  \"Who's over there?\"  \"Perfess'r and Long man; we seed 'em, dey motion for us to hurry ober to 'em.\"  This was astounding news and Ashman was mystified.  \"How did they get over there?  And why did they leave camp?\"  \"Don' know; seed 'em; want us hurry.\"  Without waiting to reflect upon the strange information, and recalling that more of the natives were likely to issue from the path at any moment, the young man stepped into the canoe, and, catching up one of the paddles, lent his help in propelling the craft across the foamy Xingu.  \"Where Johns'n?\" asked Bippo, when the middle of the stream was reached, and without ceasing his toil with the paddle.  \"The natives killed him with a poisoned spear; you will never see him again.\"  Bippo made no reply, but communicated the startling tidings to his companions, who muttered their amazement.  It was apparent that the news had added to their panic, and they bent to their task with such vigor that the boat rapidly approached the other bank.  Fred was asking himself, that if his friends had managed to get across the river, why it was they were not in sight.  He scrutinized the dark forest and the line of moonlit space in the expectation, of seeing them come forth to welcome him, but not a soul was in sight.  He did not know what to make of it.  There was something so uncanny about the whole business, that a strange distrust and uneasiness took possession of him.  It could not be that the natives had deceived him and were anxious to place the Xingu between them and the fierce savages who had handled the whites so roughly.  Bippo and his comrades had shown a loyalty from the first which gave their employers the fullest confidence in them.  The canoe was almost against the bank, where something of the bewilderment of Ashman seemed to enter the head of Bippo.  He spoke to his companions and the three ceased paddling.  Ashman had done so a moment before and was scanning the bank with a searching but vain scrutiny.  \"You must have been mistaken,\" he said in a low voice; \"they could not have swam the river and they had no other way of crossing.\"  \"We seed 'em--motion dat way,\" and the native beckoned with his right arm, just as a person would do when signaling another to approach.  \"I can't understand it,\" replied Ashman, with a shake of his head.  His doubts were confirmed, when he recalled that the professor and Jared Long had gone up the bank of the river with the purpose of learning the extent of the rapids.  It followed, therefore, that if they had made their way to the other shore, it must have been at a point so far above the angry waters that there was no danger of being caught in the furious current.  He was turning over these troublous thoughts, when Bippo, who was facing the bank they had left, uttered an expression of dismay and extended his arm toward the shore behind them.  Ashman turned his head, and there in the moonlight he saw Professor Grimcke and the New Englander standing on the land and motioning to them to return.  \"Yes--dat de way he do--he move arm like _dat_,\" said Bippo; \"we hurry to go to him, den he ain't here--but _dere_.\"  Ashman could not doubt that the servant believed the extraordinary assertion he had just made, and such being the case, the startling truth was manifest; they had seen two strangers whom they mistook for their own friends, and these strangers had beckoned them to paddle the canoe to the other shore where they were awaiting them.  If such were the fact--and he did not doubt it--a new mystery confronted him.  Who were the white men and strangers? and why had they disappeared when approached by the canoe and its occupants?  Ashman ordered the servants to turn the craft about and return to the shore they had left with all speed.  While doing so, and while Grimcke and Long were doubtless wondering what had got into the heads of the others, the young man wrought himself into a most uncomfortable condition of mind.  He questioned Bippo more particularly as to the appearance and actions of the strangers.  It was clear that he, as well as the other two, still believed the couple on the opposite bank were Grimcke and Long; though when reminded that it was impossible that they could have crossed and recrossed the stream in such a brief time, and without any means except that of swimming, they only shook their heads, signifying that, though they could not explain _that_ feature of the strange business, they would not yield their belief.  Ashman asked further, directing his question to each of the natives in turn, whether they saw the parties plainly enough to make sure they were white men.  The servants were positive on this point, adding the distracting statement that they were dressed precisely like the two absent members of the little company, and that each carried a rifle as they did.  \"Same ones--same ones; don't know how cross riber, but allee same do so,\" repeated Bippo, with a grin.  By this time the swiftly moving canoe was well on the way to the camp which it had left so abruptly, and, a minute later, Ashman sprang out and grasped the hand of each of his friends in turn.  In a few words he explained the extraordinary incidents of the last half hour, receiving in return the story of the experience of the Professor and his companion.  The latter were deeply touched by the loss of Johnston.  Danger tends to draw the members of a party closely together, and, despite the peculiar disposition of the sailor, the three felt a deep attachment for him.  They would have faced any danger in his behalf, but the time had passed for that, and they could only mourn the loss of such a valuable comrade.  \"But what about this story that Bippo tells?\"  Before a reply could be made, the native approached, with his peculiar grin.  \"How you cross riber?--why you come back 'gin?  Why you no stay ober dere when we hurry to go to you?\"  \"Bippo, you are mistaken,\" replied the Professor, with all the earnestness at his command.  \"We went up this side of the stream, and have not been on the other side since dark.  When we came back and saw that you were not in the camp, we thought you had all been killed.\"  The native grinned more than ever, and shook his head.  \"De Purfes'r funny man--he make laugh.\"  And he walked back to his companions with an unshakeable belief in the story given to Fred Ashman when he dashed in such excitement from the wood.  \"Bippo believes what he has told us,\" said Long, who had studied the fellow closely; \"and it follows that he and the others _did_ see a couple of white men.\"  \"I imagined,\" remarked Grimcke with something like regret in his tones, \"that we were the first of our race to reach this spot; but it is hard in these days to find any place on the globe where some white person had not been before us.\"  \"If there are a couple of them over there,\" said Ashman, scanning the opposite bank, \"they ought to be friends; and, after signaling to our servants to cross, it is inexplainable that they should withdraw from sight as they did.\"  \"We can depend on _one_ thing,\" added the Professor; \"we haven't seen the last of them.  I would be glad to believe them friends, but their actions are unsatisfactory.  I am inclined to think that the cause of their withdrawing was your entrance into the canoe.  For some reason they wished to have nothing to do with any of us.\"  \"It may be that since we are suspicious of them,\" said Fred, \"they feel the same toward us, and are unwilling to make our acquaintance until after reconnoiterin' us.  Helloa! what's up now?\"  This question was caused by the action of Bippo, who, trembling in every limb, and with the appearance of a person overcome with terror, pointed to the forest behind them.     CHAPTER IX.  A NATIVE HERCULES.  The savages that had shown such pluck in the instances described, now gave another striking proof of their courage.  At the moment the mystified explorers were discussing the strange appearance and actions of the white men, more than twenty of the athletic barbarians issued as stealthily as phantoms from the trail leading from the forest and crouched along the edge of the timber.  Their silence added impressiveness to the singular scene and prevented their movements being observed except by Bippo, who was so terrified that he could only tremble and point at them.  They were partly hidden by the shadow which put out a short distance from the fringe of the wood, but there could be no doubt of their hostile intentions.  They assumed the form of a line,"]]]
