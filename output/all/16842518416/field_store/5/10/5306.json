Oly Sweynsdatter came by after supper and asked if I wanted to go out and play with the fellows. To my surprise, I found I did. We had a grand afternoon pelting each other with snow-balls, a game that turned into a full-scale war, as all the older boys back from high-school came out and joined in, and then, later, all the men, even the Sheriff and Mr Adelson. I never laughed so much in all my life, even when I got one right in the ear.  Mr Adelson led a charge of adults against the fort that most of the Academy boys were hiding behind, but I saw him planning it and started laying in ammunition long before they made their go, and we sent them back with their tails between their legs. I hit him smack in the behind with one ball as he dove for cover.  Oly's mother gave us both good, Svenska hot cocoa afterwards, with fresh whipped cream, and Oly and I exchanged gifts. He gave me a tin soldier, a Confederate who was caught in the act of falling over backwards, clutching his chest. I gave him my best marble. We followed his mother around their house, recounting the adventures in the snow until she told me it was time for me to go home.  #  School started again, and I went in early the first day to turn in my paper. Mr Adelson took it without comment and scanned the first few paragraphs. \"Thank you, James, I think this will do nicely. I'll have it graded for you in the afternoon.\"  I met Oly out in the orchard, where he was chopping kindling for the school's stove, a job we all took turns at. \"I hear you might be getting a new Pa for Christmas,\" he said. He gave me a smile that meant something, but I couldn't guess what.  \"What is that supposed to mean?\" I asked.  \"My Mama says your Mama had old man Johnstone over for Christmas dinner. And the widow Ott told my Mama that she'd connected one or two calls between your house and the store every day in the last month. My Mama says that Johnstone is courting your Mama.\"  \"Mrs Ott isn't supposed to talk about the calls she connects,\" I said, as my mind reeled. \"It's like a telegraph operator: it's a confidential trust.\" Mr Adelson had told me that, once when he was telling me stories about his life before he went to sea.  \"So, is it true?\"  \"No!\" I said, surprising myself with my vehemence. \"My Mama just didn't want him to be alone at Christmas.\"  Oly swung the axe a few more times. \"Well, sure. But what about all the telephone calls?\"  \"That's business. The store is still partly ours. Mama's just looking after our interests.\"  \"If you say so,\" he said.  I shoved him hard. I drew a line in the snow with my toe. \"I _do_ say so. Step across the line if you say otherwise!\"  Oly got to his feet and looked at me. \"I don't want to fight with you, James. I was just tellin' you what my Mama said.\"  \"Well, your Mama ought to mind her own business,\" I said, baiting him.  That did it. He stepped over and popped me one, right in the nose. Oly and I had been chums since we could walk, and we'd had a few fights in our days but this time it was different. I was so _angry_ at him, at my Mama, at my Pa, at New Jerusalem, and we just kept on swinging at each other until Mr Adelson came out to ring the bell and separated us. My nose was sore and I was limping, and I'd torn Oly's jacket and bent his fingers back, so he cradled his hand in the crook of his arm.  \"Boys!\" Mr Adelson said. \"What the hell do you think you're doing? You're supposed to be friends.\"  His language shocked me, but I was still plenty angry. \"He's no friend of mine!\" I said.  \"That's fine with me,\" Oly said and glared at me.  The other kids were milling around, and Mr Adelson gave us both a look that could melt steel, then rang the bell.  #  I could hardly concentrate in class that day. My Mama getting married? A new Pa? It couldn't be true. But in my mind, I kept seeing my Mama and that Johnstone kissing under the mistletoe, and him sitting in my Pa's chair, drinking his whiskey.  Oly's desk was next to mine, and he kept shooting me dirty looks. Finally, I leaned over and whispered, \"Cut it out, you idiot.\"  Oly said, \"You're the idiot. I think you got your brains scrambled in France, James.\"  \"I'll scramble your brains!\"  \"Gentlemen,\" said Mr Adelson. \"Do you have something you'd like to share with the class?\"  \"No sir,\" we said together, and exchanged glares.  \"James, perhaps you'd like to come up to the front and finish the lesson?\"  \"Sir?\" I said, looking at the blackboard. He'd been going through quadratics, an elaborate first-principles proof.  \"I believe you know this already, don't you? Come up to the front and finish the lesson.\"  Slowly, I got up from my desk, leaving my slate on my desk, and made my way up to the front. Some of the kids giggled. I picked up a piece of chalk from the chalk-well, and started to write on the board.  Mr Adelson walked back to my seat and sat down. I stopped and looked over my shoulder, and he gave me a little scooting gesture that meant go on. I did, and by the end of the hour, I found that I was enjoying myself. I stopped frequently for questions, and erased the board over and over again, filling it with steady columns of numbers and equations. I stopped noticing Mr Adelson in my seat, and when he stood and thanked me and told us we could eat our lunches, it seemed like no time at all had passed.  Mr Adelson looked up from my essay. \"James, I'd like to have a chat with you. Stay behind, please.\"  \"Sit,\" he said, offering me the chair at his desk. He sat on one of the front-row desks, and stared at me for a long moment.  \"What was that mess this morning all about, James?\" he asked.  \"Oly and I had an argument,\" I said, sullenly.  \"I could see that. What was it about, if you don't mind my asking?\"  \"He said something about my Mama,\" I said.  \"I see,\" he said. \"Well, having met your mother, I feel confident in saying that she's more than capable of defending herself. Am I right?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" I said.  \"Then we won't see a repeat?\"  \"No, sir,\" I said. I didn't plan on talking to Oly ever again.  \"Then we'll say no more about it. Now, about this morning's lesson: you did very well.\"  \"It was a dirty trick,\" I said.  He grinned like a pirate. \"I suppose it was. I wouldn't have played it on you if I didn't have every confidence in your abilities, though.\" He leaned across and picked up my essay from his desk. \"It was this that convinced me, really. This is as good as anything I've seen in scholarly journals. I've half a mind to send it to the _Idler_.\"  \"I'm just a kid!\"  \"You're an extraordinary boy. I'm tempted to let you teach all the classes, and take up whittling.\"  He said it so deadpan, I couldn't tell if he was kidding me. \"Oh, you can't do that! I'm not nearly ready to take over.\"  He laughed. \"You're readier than you think, but I expect the town council would stop my salary unless I did _some_ of the work around here. Still, I think that's the most active I've seen you since you came to my class, and I'm running out of ideas to keep you busy. Maybe I'll keep you teaching maths. I'll give you my lesson plan to take home before school's out.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  #  Mr Adelson gave me a stack of papers tied up with twine after he dismissed the class for the day. I went home and did my chores, then unwrapped the parcel in the parlour. The lesson plans were there, laid out, day by day, and in the centre of them was a smaller parcel, wrapped in coloured paper. \"Merry Christmas,\" was written across it, in his hand.  I opened it, and found a slim book. \"War of the Worlds,\" by Verne. For some reason, it rang a bell. I thought that maybe it had been on our bookcase in 75, but somehow, it hadn't made it back home with us. I opened it, and read the inscription he'd written: \"From one traveller to another, Merry Christmas.\"  I forced myself to read the lesson plans for the next month before I allowed myself to start the Verne, and once I started, I found I couldn't stop. Mama had to drag me away for dinner.  #  My trip back to 1975 wasn't planned, but it wasn't an accident, either. We'd gotten a new load of hay in for our team, and Mama added stacking it in the horsebarn to my chores. I'd been consciously avoiding the horsebarn since Pa had disappeared. Every time I looked at it, I felt a little hexed, a little frightened.  But Mama had a philosophy: a boy should face up to his fears. She'd been terrified of spiders when she was a girl, and she told me that she had made a point of picking up every spider she saw and letting it crawl around on her face. After a year of that, she said, she never met a spider that frightened her.  Mama had been sending me to the store more and more, too, and having Mr Johnstone over for dinner every Friday night. She knew I didn't like him one little bit, and she said that I would just have to learn to live with what I didn't like, and if that was the only thing I learned from her, it would be enough.  I preferred the horsebarn.  I worked close to the door the first day, which is no way to do it, of course: if you blocked the door, it just made it harder to get at the back when the time came. The way to do it is to first clear out whatever hay is left over, move it out to the pasture, and then fill in from the back forward.  Mama told me so, that first night, when she came out to inspect my work. \"You sure must love working out here,\" she said. \"If you do it that way, you'll be out here stacking for twice as long. Well, you have your fun, but I still expect you to be getting your homework and regular chores done. Come in and clean up for supper now.\"  I jammed the pitchfork into a bale, and washed for supper.  The next afternoon, I resolved to do it right. I moved the bales I'd stacked up by the door to a corner, and then started cleaning out the back. Before long, I'd uncovered the door into 1975. \"James,\" Mama called, from the house. \"Dinner!\"  I took a long"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16721"],["title","A Place so Foreign (#7)"],["body","at the door. The wood on the edges had aged to the silvery-brown of the rest of the barn-boards, and it looked like it had been there forever. I could hardly remember a time when it wasn't there.  I went in for supper.  The next morning, I picked up my lunch and my schoolbooks, kissed Mama good-bye, and walked out. I stood on our porch for a long time, staring at the horsebarn. I remembered the brave explorers in Verne's books. I looked over my shoulder, at the closed door of our house, then walked slowly to the horsebarn. I swung the door open, then walked to the back. The triple-bolts had rusted somewhat and took real shoving to slide back. One of them was stubborn, so I picked up the rake and pried it back with the handle, thinking of how ingenious that was.  I gave the door my shoulder and shoved, and it swung back, complaining on its hinges. On the other side was the still-familiar dark of our 1975 apartment. I stepped into it, and closed the door behind me.  \"Lights,\" I said, and they came on.  The old place was just like the day we left it. It wasn't even dusty, and as I heard the familiar trundle of the robutler, I knew why. My Pa's easy chair sat in the parlour, with a print-out of the day's _Salt Lake City Bugler_ folded on the side-table. I walked to one wall and laid my palm against it, the familiar cool glassy stuff it was made of. \"Window,\" I said, and wiped a line across the wall. Wherever my hand wiped went transparent. It was a sunny day in 1975 -- 1980, by then, but it would be 75 in my mind forever. Under the dome, Greater Salt Lake was warm and tranquil. I saw boys my age scooting around in jet-packs, dodging hover-traffic.  Pa liked to open a big, square window when he came home, and sit in his easy chair and smoke a stinky cigar and read the paper and cluck over it -- \"Well, well, well,\" he'd say, and \"How _about_ that?\" Sometimes, he'd have a tumbler of whiskey. He'd given me some, once, and the stuff had burned like turpentine and I swore I wouldn't try it again for a long, long time.  I sat in Pa's easy chair and snapped up the newspaper, the way he used to. \"Panorama,\" I said, and Pa's square window opened before me. \"Whiskey,\" I said, and \"Cigar,\" because I was never one for half-measures. The robutler trundled over to me with a tumbler and a White Owl in its hover-field. I plucked them out. Cautiously, I put the cigar between my lips. The robutler extruded a long, snaky arm with a flame, and lit it. I took a deep puff, and coughed convulsively. Unthinking, I took a gulp of whiskey. I felt like my lungs had turned inside-out.  I finished both the whiskey and the cigar before I got up, taking cautious puffs and tiny sips, forcing myself.  My head swam, and nausea nearly drowned me. I staggered into the WC, and hung my head in the oubliette for an eternity, but nothing was coming up. I moved into my old bedroom and splayed out on my bed, watching the ceiling spin. \"Lights,\" I managed to croak, and the room went dark.  #  When I woke in the morning, the walls were at half-opacity, the normal 0700 schedule, and I dragged myself out of bed.  The robutler had extruded the table and set out my breakfast, ham and eggs and a big bulb of milk. One look at it sent me over the edge, and I left a trail of sick all the way to the WC.  When I was done, I was as wrung-out as a washcloth. My head pounded. The robutler was quietly cleaning up my mess. I started to order it to clear away breakfast, but discovered that I was miraculously hungry. I ate everything on the table and seconds, besides, and had the robutler juice my temples and clear away my headache. I dialed the walls to full transparency, and watched the traffic go by.  The robutler maneuvered itself into my field of vision and flashed a clock on its chest-plate: 0800 0800 0800. It was my old school-alarm. It snapped me back to reality. My Mama was going to whip me raw! She must've been worried sick.  I stood up and ran for the door. It was closed. I punched my code into its panel, and waited. Nothing happened. I calmed myself and punched it again. Still nothing. After trying it a hundred times, I convinced myself that it had been changed.  I summoned the robutler and asked it for the code. Its chest-panel lit up: BAD PROGRAM.  That's when I started to really worry. I was near to tears when I remembered the emergency override. I punched it in.  Nothing happened.  I think I started crying around then. I was stuck in 1975!  #  I'm not a stupid little kid. I didn't spend much time pewling. Instead, I went to the phone and dialed the police. The screen stayed blank. Feeling like I was in a dream, I went to the teleporter and dialed for my old school and stepped in. I failed to teleport.  Reality sank in.  All outside services to the apartment had been shut off when we moved out. The only things that still worked were the ones that ran off our reactor, a squat armoured box on the apartment's underbelly. The door in New Jerusalem worked, but on the 1975 side, it needed to communicate with the central office to approve any passage.  I thought about sitting tight and waiting. Mama would be sick with worry, and would check the barn eventually and see the shot bolts. She'd speak to Mr Johnstone, who would send a telegram to Paris, and they would relay the message to 1975, and _voila_, I'd be rescued. I'd get the whipping of my life, and do extra chores until I was seventy, but it was better than starving to death after the apartment's pantry ran out. I felt hungry just thinking about it.  Still, there was a better way. The null-gee doughnut that our apartment was spoked into had a supply of escape-jumpers, single-use jet-packs with a simple transponder that screamed for help on all the emergency channels. I could ride one of these down into Greater Salt Lake, wait for the police. The more I thought about this plan, the better it sounded. Better, anyway, than sitting around like a fairytale princess, waiting for rescue. In my mind, I was the rescuing type, not the kind that needed rescuing.  Besides, there wasn't much better than riding around in one of those jet-packs.  I cycled the emergency lock into the doughnut, unracked a pack and a jumpsuit that looked like it would fit me, and suited up. The packed whined as it powered up and ran through its diagnostics. I checked the idiot-lights to make sure they were all green, feeling like a real man of action, then I stepped into the exterior lock and jumped, arms and legs streamlined, toes pointed.  The jet-pack coughed to life and kicked me gently, then started lowering me to the ground. The emergency beacon's idiot-light came on, and I heaved a sigh of relief and got comfortable.  The flight was peaceful and dreamlike, a slow descent over the gleaming metal city. I was so engrossed with the view that I didn't see the packjackers until they were already on me. They hit me high and low, two kids about my age with tricked-out custom jet-packs with their traffic beacons broken off. One snagged my knees and hugged them to his chest, while the other took me at the armpits. A voice shouted in my ear: \"I'm cutting your pack loose. This is a very, very sharp knife, and when I'm done, I'll be the only thing holding you up. _Don't squirm_.\"  I didn't even have the chance to squirm. By the time the speech was finished, I was separated from my pack, and I spun over upside-down, and watched it continue its descent, straps dangling in the wind. My hair hung down, and blood filled my head, reawakening my headache. Reflexively, I twisted to get a look at my kidnappers, but stopped immediately as I felt their grips loosen. I squeezed my eyes shut and prayed.  The three of us dove fast and hard, and I tasted that second helping of breakfast again before we leveled off. I risked a peek, then squeezed my eyes shut again. We were speeding through the lower levels of Greater Salt Lake, the unmanned freight corridors, impossibly claustrophobic, and at our speed, dangerous.  We cornered tightly so many times that I lost count, and then we slowed to a stop. They dumped me to the ground, steel traction-plate. The wind was knocked out of me, and I was barely conscious of the hands that untabbed my jumpsuit, then began methodically turning out the pockets of my clothes.  \"What the hell are you wearing, kid?\" one of them asked. It was the same one who'd warned me about squirming. Hearing his voice a second time, I realised that he was younger than I was, maybe ten or eleven. Even then, it didn't occur to me to fight back -- he had a knife sharp enough to cut through the safety strapping on my pack.  \"Clothes. I'm from 1898 -- my Pa's an ambassador. I don't have any money.\" I struggled into a sitting position, and was knocked onto my back again.  \"Stay down and you won't get hurt,\" the same voice said. It was young enough that I couldn't tell if it was a boy or a girl. Small hands pressed into my eyes. \"No peeking, now.\"  Another set of hands systematically rifled my coat and pants, then cut them loose and gave the same treatment to my underpants and shirt. I blushed as they were cut loose, too.  \"You really don't have any money!\" the voice said.  \"I said so, didn't I?\"  The voice said a dirty word that would've gotten it beaten black-and-blue back home, and then the hands were gone. I looked up just in time to see two small figures jetting away upwards.  I was naked, sitting on a catwalk above a freight corridor, three-quarters of a century and God-knew-how-many miles from home. I didn't cry. I was too worried to cry. I kicked my ruined clothes down into the freight corridor and pulled on the jumpsuit.  Some hero I was!  #  It was hard work, climbing staircase after staircase, up to the shopping levels. By the time I reached a level where I could see the sky, I was dripping with sweat and my headache had returned.  Foot traffic was light, but what there was pretty frightening. I'd gone walking in 75 before of course, but"]]]
