It might, indeed, be queried, why do any languages, English and German, for example, have unusual compounds for 11 and 12? It would seem as though the regular method of compounding should begin with 10 and 1, instead of 10 and 3, in any language using a system with 10 as a base. An examination of several hundred numeral scales shows that the Teutonic languages are somewhat exceptional in this respect. The words _eleven_ and _twelve_ are undoubtedly combinations, but not in the same direct sense as _thirteen_, _twenty-five_, etc. The same may be said of the French _onze_, _douze_, _treize_, _quatorze_, _quinze_, and _seize_, which are obvious compounds, but not formed in the same manner as the numerals above that point. Almost all civilized languages, however, except the Teutonic, and practically all uncivilized languages, begin their direct numeral combinations as soon as they have passed their number base, whatever that may be. To give an illustration, selected quite at random from among the barbarous tribes of Africa, the Ki-Swahili numeral scale runs as follows:[53]     1.  moyyi,    2.  mbiri,    3.  tato,    4.  ena,    5.  tano,    6.  seta,    7.  saba,    8.  nani,    9.  kenda,   10.  kumi,   11.  kumi na moyyi,   12.  kumi na mbiri,   13.  kumi na tato,   etc.  The words for 11, 12, and 13, are seen at a glance to signify ten-and-one, ten-and-two, ten-and-three, and the count proceeds, as might be inferred, in a similar manner as far as the number system extends. Our English combinations are a little closer than these, and the combinations found in certain other languages are, in turn, closer than those of the English; as witness the _once_, 11, _doce_, 12, _trece_, 13, etc., of Spanish. But the process is essentially the same, and the law may be accepted as practically invariable, that all numerals greater than the base of a system are expressed by compound words, except such as are necessary to establish some new order of unit, as hundred or thousand.  In the scale just given, it will be noticed that the larger number precedes the smaller, giving 10 + 1, 10 + 2, etc., instead of 1 + 10, 2 + 10, etc. This seems entirely natural, and hardly calls for any comment whatever. But we have only to consider the formation of our English \"teens\" to see that our own method is, at its inception, just the reverse of this. Thirteen, 14, and the remaining numerals up to 19 are formed by prefixing the smaller number to the base; and it is only when we pass 20 that we return to the more direct and obvious method of giving precedence to the larger. In German and other Teutonic languages the inverse method is continued still further. Here 25 is _fünf und zwanzig_, 5 and 20; 92 is _zwei und neunzig_, 2 and 90, and so on to 99. Above 100 the order is made direct, as in English. Of course, this mode of formation between 20 and 100 is permissible in English, where \"five and twenty\" is just as correct a form as twenty-five. But it is archaic, and would soon pass out of the language altogether, were it not for the influence of some of the older writings which have had a strong influence in preserving for us many of older and more essentially Saxon forms of expression.  Both the methods described above are found in all parts of the world, but what I have called the direct is far more common than the other. In general, where the smaller number precedes the larger it signifies multiplication instead of addition. Thus, when we say \"thirty,\" _i.e._ three-ten, we mean 3 × 10; just as \"three hundred\" means 3 × 100. When the larger precedes the smaller, we must usually understand addition. But to both these rules there are very many exceptions. Among higher numbers the inverse order is very rarely used; though even here an occasional exception is found. The Taensa Indians, for example, place the smaller numbers before the larger, no matter how far their scale may extend. To say 1881 they make a complete inversion of our own order, beginning with 1 and ending with 1000. Their full numeral for this is _yeha av wabki mar-u-wab mar-u-haki_, which means, literally, 1 + 80 + 100 × 8 + 100 × 10.[54] Such exceptions are, however, quite rare.  One other method of combination, that of subtraction, remains to be considered. Every student of Latin will recall at once the _duodeviginti_, 2 from 20, and _undeviginti_, 1 from 20, which in that language are the regular forms of expression for 18 and 19. At first they seem decidedly odd; but familiarity soon accustoms one to them, and they cease entirely to attract any special attention. This principle of subtraction, which, in the formation of numeral words, is quite foreign to the genius of English, is still of such common occurrence in other languages that the Latin examples just given cease to be solitary instances.  The origin of numerals of this class is to be found in the idea of reference, not necessarily to the last, but to the nearest, halting-point in the scale. Many tribes seem to regard 9 as \"almost 10,\" and to give it a name which conveys this thought. In the Mississaga, one of the numerous Algonquin languages, we have, for example, the word _cangaswi_, \"incomplete 10,\" for 9.[55] In the Kwakiutl of British Columbia, 8 as well as 9 is formed in this way; these two numbers being _matlguanatl_, 10 - 2, and _nanema_, 10 - 1, respectively.[56] In many of the languages of British Columbia we find a similar formation for 8 and 9, or for 9 alone. The same formation occurs in Malay, resulting in the numerals _delapan_, 10 - 2, and _sambilan_ 10 - 1.[57] In Green Island, one of the New Ireland group, these become simply _andra-lua_, \"less 2,\" and _andra-si_, \"less 1.\"[58] In the Admiralty Islands this formation is carried back one step further, and not only gives us _shua-luea_, \"less 2,\" and _shu-ri_, \"less 1,\" but also makes 7 appear as _sua-tolu_, \"less 3.\"[59] Surprising as this numeral is, it is more than matched by the Ainu scale, which carries subtraction back still another step, and calls 6, 10 - 4. The four numerals from 6 to 9 in this scale are respectively, _iwa_, 10 - 4, _arawa_, 10 - 3, _tupe-san_, 10 - 2, and _sinepe-san_, 10 - 1.[60] Numerous examples of this kind of formation will be found in later chapters of this work; but they will usually be found to occur in one or both of the numerals, 8 and 9. Occasionally they appear among the higher numbers; as in the Maya languages, where, for example, 99 years is \"one single year lacking from five score years,\"[61] and in the Arikara dialects, where 98 and 99 are \"5 men minus\" and \"5 men 1 not.\"[62] The Welsh, Danish, and other languages less easily accessible than these to the general student, also furnish interesting examples of a similar character.  More rarely yet are instances met with of languages which make use of subtraction almost as freely as addition, in the composition of numerals. Within the past few years such an instance has been noticed in the case of the Bellacoola language of British Columbia. In their numeral scale 15, \"one foot,\" is followed by 16, \"one man less 4\"; 17, \"one man less 3\"; 18, \"one man less 2\"; 19, \"one man less 1\"; and 20, one man. Twenty-five is \"one man and one hand\"; 26, \"one man and two hands less 4\"; 36, \"two men less 4\"; and so on. This method of formation prevails throughout the entire numeral scale.[63]  One of the best known and most interesting examples of subtraction as a well-defined principle of formation is found in the Maya scale. Up to 40 no special peculiarity appears; but as the count progresses beyond that point we find a succession of numerals which one is almost tempted to call 60 - 19, 60 - 18, 60 - 17, etc. Literally translated the meanings seem to be 1 to 60, 2 to 60, 3 to 60, etc. The point of reference is 60, and the thought underlying the words may probably be expressed by the paraphrases, \"1 on the third score, 2 on the third score, 3 on the third score,\" etc.  Similarly, 61 is 1 on the fourth score, 81 is one on the fifth score, 381 is 1 on the nineteenth score, and so on to 400. At 441 the same formation reappears; and it continues to characterize the system in a regular and consistent manner, no matter how far it is extended.[64]  The Yoruba language of Africa is another example of most lavish use of subtraction; but it here results in a system much less consistent and natural than that just considered. Here we find not only 5, 10, and 20 subtracted from the next higher unit, but also 40, and even 100. For example, 360 is 400 - 40; 460 is 500 - 40; 500 is 600 - 100; 1300 is 1400 - 100, etc. One of the Yoruba units is 200; and all the odd hundreds up to 2000, the next higher unit, are formed by subtracting 100 from the next higher multiple of 200. The system is quite complex, and very artificial; and seems to have been developed by intercourse with traders.[65]  It has already been stated that the primitive meanings of our own simple numerals have been lost. This is also true of the languages of nearly all other civilized peoples, and of numerous savage races as well. We are at liberty to suppose, and we do suppose, that in very many cases these words once expressed meanings closely connected with the names of the fingers, or with the fingers themselves, or both. Now and then a case is met with in which the numeral word frankly avows its meaning--as in the Botocudo language, where 1 is expressed by _podzik_, finger, and 2 by _kripo_, double finger;[66] and in the Eskimo dialect of Hudson's Bay, where _eerkitkoka_ means both 10 and little finger.[67] Such cases are, however, somewhat exceptional.  In a few noteworthy instances, the words composing the numeral scale of a language have been carefully investigated and their original meanings accurately determined. The simple structure of many of the rude languages of the world should render this possible in a multitude of cases; but investigators are too often content with the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16449"],["title","The Number Concept: Its Origin and Development (#7)"],["body","numerals themselves, and make no inquiry respecting their meanings. But the following exposition of the Zuñi scale, given by Lieutenant Gushing[68] leaves nothing to be desired:     1.  töpinte = taken to start with.    2.  kwilli  = put down together with.    3.  ha'[=i] = the equally dividing finger.    4.  awite   = all the fingers all but done with.    5.  öpte    = the notched off.  This finishes the list of original simple numerals, the Zuñi stopping, or \"notching off,\" when he finishes the fingers of one hand. Compounding now begins.     6.  topalïk'ya   = another brought to add to the done with.    7.  kwillilïk'ya = two brought to and held up with the rest.    8.  hailïk'ye    = three brought to and held up with the rest.    9.  tenalïk'ya   = all but all are held up with the rest.   10.  ästem'thila  = all the fingers.   11.  ästem'thla topayä'thl'tona = all the fingers and another over                                     above held.  The process of formation indicated in 11 is used in the succeeding numerals up to 19.      20.  kwillik'yënästem'thlan = two times all the fingers.    100.  ässiästem'thlak'ya = the fingers all the fingers.   1000.  ässiästem'thlanak'yënästem'thla = the fingers all the fingers                                            times all the fingers.  The only numerals calling for any special note are those for 11 and 9. For 9 we should naturally expect a word corresponding in structure and meaning to the words for 7 and 8. But instead of the \"four brought to and held up with the rest,\" for which we naturally look, the Zuñi, to show that he has used all of his fingers but one, says \"all but all are held up with the rest.\" To express 11 he cannot use a similar form of composition, since he has already used it in constructing his word for 6, so he says \"all the fingers and another over above held.\"  The one remarkable point to be noted about the Zuñi scale is, after all, the formation of the words for 1 and 2. While the savage almost always counts on his fingers, it does not seem at all certain that these words would necessarily be of finger formation. The savage can always distinguish between one object and two objects, and it is hardly reasonable to believe that any external aid is needed to arrive at a distinct perception of this difference. The numerals for 1 and 2 would be the earliest to be formed in any language, and in most, if not all, cases they would be formed long before the need would be felt for terms to describe any higher number. If this theory be correct, we should expect to find finger names for numerals beginning not lower than 3, and oftener with 5 than with any other number. The highest authority has ventured the assertion that all numeral words have their origin in the names of the fingers;[69] substantially the same conclusion was reached by Professor Pott, of Halle, whose work on numeral nomenclature led him deeply into the study of the origin of these words. But we have abundant evidence at hand to show that, universal as finger counting has been, finger origin for numeral words has by no means been universal. That it is more frequently met with than any other origin is unquestionably true; but in many instances, which will be more fully considered in the following chapter, we find strictly non-digital derivations, especially in the case of the lowest members of the scale. But in nearly all languages the origin of the words for 1, 2, 3, and 4 are so entirely unknown that speculation respecting them is almost useless.  An excellent illustration of the ordinary method of formation which obtains among number scales is furnished by the Eskimos of Point Barrow,[70] who have pure numeral words up to 5, and then begin a systematic course of word formation from the names of their fingers. If the names of the first five numerals are of finger origin, they have so completely lost their original form, or else the names of the fingers themselves have so changed, that no resemblance is now to be detected between them. This scale is so interesting that it is given with considerable fulness, as follows:     1.  atauzik.    2.  madro.    3.  pinasun.    4.  sisaman.    5.  tudlemut.    6.  atautyimin akbinigin [tudlimu(t)] = 5 and 1 on the next.    7.  madronin akbinigin  = twice on the next.    8.  pinasunin akbinigin = three times on the next.    9.  kodlinotaila        = that which has not its 10.   10.  kodlin              = the upper part--_i.e._ the fingers.   14.  akimiaxotaityuna    = I have not 15.   15.  akimia. [This seems to be a real numeral word.]   20.  inyuina = a man come to an end.   25.  inyuina tudlimunin akbinidigin = a man come to an end and 5 on the                                         next.   30.  inyuina kodlinin akbinidigin = a man come to an end and 10 on the                                       next.   35.  inyuina akimiamin aipalin = a man come to an end accompanied by 1                                    fifteen times.   40.  madro inyuina = 2 men come to an end.  In this scale we find the finger origin appearing so clearly and so repeatedly that one feels some degree of surprise at finding 5 expressed by a pure numeral instead of by some word meaning _hand_ or _fingers of one hand_. In this respect the Eskimo dialects are somewhat exceptional among scales built up of digital words. The system of the Greenland Eskimos, though differing slightly from that of their Point Barrow cousins, shows the same peculiarity. The first ten numerals of this scale are:[71]     1.  atausek.    2.  mardluk.    3.  pingasut.    4.  sisamat.    5.  tatdlimat.    6.  arfinek-atausek  = to the other hand 1.    7.  arfinek-mardluk  = to the other hand 2.    8.  arfinek-pingasut = to the other hand 3.    9.  arfinek-sisamat  = to the other hand 4.   10.  kulit.  The same process is now repeated, only the feet instead of the hands are used; and the completion of the second 10 is marked by the word _innuk_, man. It may be that the Eskimo word for 5 is, originally, a digital word, but if so, the fact has not yet been detected. From the analogy furnished by other languages we are justified in suspecting that this may be the case; for whenever a number system contains digital words, we expect them to begin with _five_, as, for example, in the Arawak scale,[72] which runs:     1.  abba.    2.  biama.    3.  kabbuhin.    4.  bibiti.    5.  abbatekkábe = 1 hand.    6.  abbatiman   = 1 of the other.    7.  biamattiman = 2 of the other.    8.  kabbuhintiman = 3 of the other.    9.  bibitiman     = 4 of the other.   10.  biamantekábbe = 2 hands.   11.  abba kutihibena = 1 from the feet.   20.  abba lukku = hands feet.  The four sets of numerals just given may be regarded as typifying one of the most common forms of primitive counting; and the words they contain serve as illustrations of the means which go to make up the number scales of savage races. Frequently the finger and toe origin of numerals is perfectly apparent, as in the Arawak system just given, which exhibits the simplest and clearest possible method of formation. Another even more interesting system is that of the Montagnais of northern Canada.[73] Here, as in the Zuñi scale, the words are digital from the outset.     1.  inl'are = the end is bent.    2.  nak'e   = another is bent.    3.  t'are   = the middle is bent.    4.  dinri   = there are no more except this.    5.  se-sunla-re = the row on the hand.    6.  elkke-t'are = 3 from each side.    7.{ t'a-ye-oyertan = there are still 3 of them.      { inl'as dinri   = on one side there are 4 of them.    8.  elkke-dinri    = 4 on each side.    9.  inl'a-ye-oyert'an = there is still 1 more.   10.  onernan = finished on each side.   11.  onernan inl'are ttcharidhel = 1 complete and 1.   12.  onernan nak'e ttcharidhel = 1 complete and 2, etc.  The formation of 6, 7, and 8 of this scale is somewhat different from that ordinarily found. To express 6, the Montagnais separates the thumb and forefinger from the three remaining fingers of the left hand, and bringing the thumb of the right hand close to them, says: \"3 from each side.\" For 7 he either subtracts from 10, saying: \"there are still 3 of them,\" or he brings the thumb and forefinger of the right hand up to the thumb of the left, and says: \"on one side there are 4 of them.\" He calls 8 by the same name as many of the other Canadian tribes, that is, two 4's; and to show the proper number of fingers, he closes the thumb and little finger of the right hand, and then puts the three remaining fingers beside the thumb of the left hand. This method is, in some of these particulars, different from any other I have ever examined.  It often happens that the composition of numeral words is less easily understood, and the original meanings more difficult to recover, than in the examples already given. But in searching for number systems which show in the formation of their words the influence of finger counting, it is not unusual to find those in which the derivation from native words signifying _finger, hand, toe, foot_, and _man_, is just as frankly obvious as in the case of the Zuñi, the Arawak, the Eskimo, or the Montagnais scale. Among the Tamanacs,[74] one of the numerous Indian tribes of the Orinoco, the numerals are as strictly digital as in any of the systems already examined. The general structure of the Tamanac scale is shown by the following numerals:     5.  amgnaitone = 1 hand complete.    6.  itacono amgna pona tevinitpe = 1 on the other hand.   10.  amgna aceponare = all of the 2 hands.   11.  puitta pona tevinitpe = 1 on the foot.   16.  itacono puitta pona tevinitpe = 1 on the other foot.   20.  tevin itoto = 1 man.   21.  itacono itoto jamgnar bona tevinitpe = 1 on the hands of another                                               man.  In the Guarani[75] language of Paraguay the same method is found, with a different form of expression for 20. Here the numerals in question are     5.  asepopetei ="]]]
