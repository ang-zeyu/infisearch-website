I need not tell a man of your discernment, in what a different light all objects, whether animate, or inanimate, appear to those, whose temper is disturbed, either by ill health, ill treatment, or, what is perhaps more prevalent than either, the chagrin he may feel at not being rated in the estimation of others, according to that value he puts upon himself. Could Dr. Smollett rise from the dead, and sit down in perfect health, and good temper, and read his travels through France and Italy, he would probably find most of his anger turned upon himself. But, poor man! he was ill; and meeting with, what every stranger must expect to meet at most French inns, want of cleanliness, imposition, and incivility; he was so much disturbed by those incidents, that to say no more of the writings of an ingenious and deceased author, his travels into France, and Italy, are the least entertaining, in my humble opinion, of all his works. Indeed I have observed that most travellers fall into one extreme, or the other, and either are all panegyric or all censure; in which case, all they say cannot be just; for, as all nations are governed by men, and the bulk of men of all nations live by artifice of one kind or other, the few men who pass among them, without any sinister views, cannot avoid feeling, and but few from complaining of the ill treatment they meet with; not considering one of Swift's shrewd remarks; _I never_ said he, _knew a man who could not bear the misfortunes of another perfectly like a Christian_.  Remember therefore, when I tell you how ill I have been treated either by _Lords_ or _Aubergists_, or how dirtily served by either, it is to prepare myself and you too, to be content with neighbours' fare.  When a man writes remarks upon the manners and customs of other nations, he should endeavour to wean himself from all partiality for his own; and I need not tell you that I am in _full possession_ of that single qualification, which I hope will make you some amends for my defects in all the others; for it is certainly unjust, uncandid, and illiberal, to pronounce a custom or fashion absurd, because it does not coincide with our ideas of propriety. A Turk who travelled into England, would, upon his return to Constantinople, tell his countrymen, that at Canterbury; (bring out of _opium_,) his host did not know even what he demanded; and that it was with some difficulty he found out, that there were shops in the town where _opium_ was sold, and even then, it was with greater, he could prevail upon the vender of it to let him have above half an ounce: if he were questioned, why all these precautions? he would tell them, laughingly, that Englishmen believe _opium_ to be a deadly poison, and those people suspected that he either meant to kill himself, or to poison another man with it.  A French gentleman, who travelled some years since into Spain, had letters of recommendation to a Spanish Bishop, who received him with every mark of politeness, and treated him with much hospitality: soon after he retired to his bedchamber, a priest entered it,[A] holding a vessel in his hand, which was covered with a clean napkin; he said something; but the Frenchman understanding but little Spanish, intimated by signs his thanks, and desired him to put it down, believing, that his friend, the Bishop, had sent him a plate of sweetmeats, fruit, iced cream, or some kind of refreshment to eat before he went to bed, or to refresh his exhausted spirits in the night; but his astonishment was great indeed, when he found the priest put the present under the side of the bed; and more so, when he perceived that it was only a _pot de chambre_;--for, says the Frenchman, \"in Spain, they do not use the _chaise percee_!\" The Frenchman is surprized at the Spaniard, for not using so convenient a vehicle; the Englishman is equally surprized, that the Frenchman does;--the Frenchman is always attentive to his own person, and scarce ever appears but clean and well dressed; while his house and private apartments are perhaps covered with litter and dirt, and in the utmost confusion;--the Englishman, on the other hand, often neglects his external dress; but his house is always exquisitely clean, and every thing in it kept in the nicest order; and who shall say, which of the two judge the best for their own ease and happiness? I am sure the Frenchman will not give up his powdered hair, and laced coat, for a clean house; nor do I believe those fineries would sit quietly upon the back of an Englishman, in a dirty one. In short, my dear sir, we must take the world, and the things in it, as they are; it is a dirty world, but like France, has a vast number of good things in it, and such as I meet with, in this my third tour, which shall be a long one, if I am not _stopped_ by the way, you shall have such an account of as I am able to convey to you: I will not attempt to _top the traveller_ upon you, nor raise monuments of wonder, where none are to be seen; there is real matter enough to be found upon this great continent, to amuse a man who travels slowly over it, to see what is to be seen, and who wishes not to be seen himself. My style of travelling is such, that I can never be disturbed in mind for want of respect, but rather be surprised when I meet with even common civility. And, after all, what does it signify, whether Monsieur _ou Tel_ travels in a laced coat _et très bien mis_, attended by half a dozen servants, or, as Pope says,                                     \"will run   The Lord knows whither in a chaise and one.\"                                     I am, your's &c.  [A] The Bishops in Spain are attended and waited upon by inferior clergy.     LETTER II.  June 25th, 1766.   Before I leave Calais, let me remind you, that an English guinea is worth more than a _Louis d'or_; and observe, that the first question _my friend Mons. Dessein_, at the _Hotel D'Angleterre_ will put to you, (after he has made his bow, and given you a side look, as a cock does at a barley-corn) is, whether you have any guineas to change? because he gets by each guinea, full weight, ten _Sols_. By this hint, you will conclude, he will not, upon your return, ask you for your French Gold; but in this too you will be mistaken, for he finds an advantage in that also; he will, not indeed give you guineas, but, in lieu thereof, he has always a large quantity of _Birmingham Shillings_, to truck with you for your _Louis d'ors_. I am afraid, when Lord North took into consideration the state of the gold coin, he did not know, that the better state it is put into in England, is the surest means of transporting it into France, and other countries; and that scarce a single guinea which travellers carry with them to France, (and many hundred go every week) ever returns to England: Beside this, the quantity of gold carried over to the ports of _Dunkirk_, _Boulogne_, and _Calais_, by the Smugglers, who always pay ready money, is incredible; but as money, and matters of that kind, are what I have but _little concern in_, I will not enlarge upon a subject no way interesting to me, and shall only observe, that my landlord, _Mons. Dessein_, who was behind-hand with the world ten years ago, is now become one of the richest men in _Calais_, has built a little Theatre in his garden, and has united the profitable business of a Banker, to that of a Publican; and by studying the _Gout_ of the English nation, and changing their gold into French currency, has made, they say, a _Demi Plumb_.  Notwithstanding the contiguity of _Calais_ to England, and the great quantity of poultry, vegetables, game, &c. which are bought up every market-day, and conveyed to your coast, I am inclined to believe, there are not many parts of France where a man, who has but little money, can make it go further than in this town; nor is there any town in England, where the fishery is conducted with so much industry.  Yesterday I visited my unfortunate daughter, at the convent at _Ardres_;--but why do I say unfortunate? She is unfortunate only, in the eyes of the world, not in her own; nor indeed in mine, because she assured me she is happy. I left her here, you know, ten years ago, by way of education, and learning the language; but the small-pox,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16485"],["title","A Year's Journey through France and Part of Spain, Volume 1 (1777) (#1)"],["body"," seized her soon after, made such havock on a face, rather favoured by nature, that she desired to hide it from the world, and spend her life in that retirement, which I had chosen only to qualify her _for_ the world. I left her a child; I found her a sensible woman; full of affection and duty; and her mangled and seamed face, so softened by an easy mind, and a good conscience, that she appeared in my partial eyes, rather an agreeable than a plain woman; but she did not omit to signify to me, that what others considered her misfortune, she considered (as it was not her fault) a happy circumstance; \"if my face is plain (said she) my heart is light, and I am sure it will make as good a figure in the earth, as the fairest, and most beautiful.\" My only concern is, that I find the _Prieure_ of this convent, either for want of more knowledge, or more money, or both, had received, as parlour boarders, some English ladies of very suspicious characters. As the conversation of such women might interrupt, and disturb that peace and tranquillity of mind, in which I found my daughter, I told the _Prieure_ my sentiments on that subject, not only with freedom, but with some degree of severity; and endeavoured to convince her, how very unwarrantably, if not irreligiously she acted. An abandoned, or vicious woman, may paint the pleasures of this world in such gaudy colours, to a poor innocent Nun, so as to induce her to forget, or become less attentive to the professions she has made to the next.  It was near this town, you know, that the famous interview passed between Henry the Eighth, and _Francis_ the First, in the year 1520; and though it lasted twenty-eight days, and was an event which produced at that time so many amusements to all present, and so much conversation throughout Europe, the inhabitants of this, town, or Calais, seem to know little of it, but that one of the bastions at _Ardres_ is called the Bastion of the Two Kings.--There still remains, however, in the front of one of the houses in _Calais_, upon an ornamented stone, cut in old letter,                               =God Save the King=;  And I suppose that stone was put, where it now remains, by some loyal subject, before the King arrived, as it is in a street which leads from the gate (now stopped up) which Henry passed through.     LETTER III.   In a very few days I shall leave this town, and having procured letters of recommendation from some men of fashion, now in England, to their friends in _Spain_, I am determined to traverse this, and make a little tour into that kingdom; so you may expect something more from me, than merely such remarks as may be useful to you on any future tour you make in France; I mean to conduct you at least over the _Pyrenean_ hills to _Barcelona_; for, though I have been two or three times before in Spain, it was early in life, and when my mind was more employed in observing the _customs_ and _manors_ of the birds, and beasts of the field, than of their lords and masters, and made too, on the other side of that kingdom. Having seen as much of Paris as I desired, some years ago, I intend to pass through the provinces of _Artois_, _Champaigne_, _Bourgogne_, and so on to _Lyons_; by which route you will perceive, I shall leave the capital of this kingdom many leagues on my right hand, and see some considerable towns, and taste now and then of the most delicious wines, on the spots which produce them; beside this, I have a great desire to see the remains of a Roman subterranean town, lately discovered in _Champaigne_, which perhaps may gratify my curiosity in some degree, and thereby lessen that desire I have: long had of visiting _Herculaneum_, an _under-ground_ town you know, I always said I would visit, if a certain person happened to be put _under-ground_ before me; but the CAUSE, and the event, in all human affairs, are not to be fathomed by men; for though the event happened, the _cause_ frustrated my design; and I must cross the _Pyranean_ not the _Alpian_ hills. But lest I forget it, let me tell you, that as my travelling must be upon the frugal plan, I have sold my four-wheel post-chaise, to _Mons. Dessein_, for twenty-two guineas, and bought a French _cabriolet_, for ten, and likewise a very handsome English coach-horse, (a little touched in the wind indeed) for seven. This equipage I have fitted up with every convenience I can contrive, to carry me, my wife, two daughters, and all my _other_ baggage; you will conclude therefore, _light_ as the latter may be, we are _bien charge_; but as we move slowly, not above seven leagues a day, I shall have the more leisure to look about me, and to consider what sort of remarks may prove most worthy of communicating from time to time to you. I shall be glad to leave this town, though it is in one respect, something like your's,[B] everyday producing many _strange faces_, and some very agreeable acquaintance. The arrival of the packet-boats from Dover constitutes the principal amusement of this town.  [B] BATH.  The greater part of the English _transports_ who come over, do not proceed much further than to see the tobacco plantations near _St. Omer_'s; nor is their return home less entertaining than their arrival, as many of them are people of such _quick parts_, that they acquire, in a week's tour to _Dunkirk_, _Bologne_, and _St. Omer_'s, the _language_, dress and manners of the country. You must not, however, expect to hear again from me, till I am further _a-field_. But lest I forget to mention it in a future letter, let me refresh your memory, as to your conduct at Dover, at Sea, and at _Calais_. In the first of these three disagreeable places, (and the first is the worst) you will soon be applied to by one of the Captains of the packets, or bye-boats, and if you hire the boat to yourself, he will demand five guineas; if you treat with another, it is all one, because they are all, except one, partners and equally interested; and therefore will abate nothing. Captain Watson is the only one who _swims upon his own bottom_; and as he is a good seaman, and has a clean, convenient, nay an elegant vessel, I would rather turn the scale in his favour, because I am, as you will be, an enemy to all associations which have a tendency to imposition upon the public, and oppression to such who will not join in the general confederacy; yet I must, in justice to the Captains of the confederate party, acknowledge, that their vessels are all good; _well found_; and that they are civil, decent-behaved men. As it is natural for them to endeavour to make the most of each _trip_, they will, if they can, foist a few passengers upon you, even after you have taken the vessel to your own use only. If you are alone, this intrusion is not agreeable, but if you have ladies with you, never submit to it; if they introduce men, who appear like gentlemen upon your vessel, you cannot avoid treating them as such; if women, you cannot avoid them treating them with more attention than may be convenient, because they _are_ women; but were it only in consideration of the sea-sickness and its _consequences_, can any thing be more disagreeable than to admit people to _pot_ and _porringer_ with you, in a small close cabin, with whom you would neither eat, drink, or converse, in any other place? but these are not the only reasons; every gentleman going to France should avoid making new acquaintance, at Dover, at Sea, or at _Calais_: many _adventurers_ are always passing, and many honest men are often led into grievous and dangerous situations by such inconsiderate connections; nay, the best, and wisest men, are the most liable to be off their guard, and therefore you will excuse my pointing it out to you.  I could indeed relate some alarming consequences, nay, some fatal ones, which have befallen men of honour and character in this country, from such unguarded connections; and such as they would not have been drawn into, on the other side of the \"_invidious Streight_.\" When an Englishman leaves his own country, and is got no further from it than to this town, he looks back upon it with an eye of partial affection; no wonder then, if he feels more disposed to be kind to a countryman and a stranger he may meet in this.--I do not think it would be difficult to point out, what degree of intimacy would arise between two men who knew but little of each other, according to the part of the world they were to meet in.--I remember the time, when I only knew your person, and coveted your acquaintance; at that time we lived in the same town, knew each other's general character, but passed without speaking, or even the compliment of the hat; yet had we met in London, we should certainly have taken some civil notice of each other: had the interview been at York, it is five to one but it would have produced a conversation: at Edinburgh, or Dublin, we should have dined, or gone to the play together: but if we had met at Barbadoes, I should have been invited to spend a month at your PENN, and experienced many of those marks of hospitality, friendship, and generosity, I have found from the Creoles in general. When you get upon the French coast, the packet brings to, and is soon boarded by a French boat, to carry the passengers on shore; this passage is much longer than it appears to be, is always disagreeable, and sometimes dangerous; and the landing, if the water be very low, intolerable: in this case, never mind the advice of the Captain; his advice is, and must be regulated by his _own_ and his owner's interest, more than your convenience; therefore stay on board till there is water enough to sail up to the town, and be landed by a plank laid from the packet to the shore, and do not suffer any body to persuade you to go into a boat, or to be put on shore, by any other method, tho' the _packet-men_ and the _Frenchmen_ unite to persuade you so to do, because they are mutually benefited by putting you to more expence, and the latter "]]]
