As he did so, a folded note fell from among them unseen by Ronnie, and dropped to the floor close to Aubrey's foot.  Ronnie began reading; but black spots danced before his eyes, and Helen's beautiful clear writing zig-zagged up and down the page.  Presently his vision cleared a little and he read more easily.  Suddenly he laughed, a short, rather mirthless, laugh.  \"What's up?\" inquired Aubrey Treherne.  \"Oh, nothing much; only I suppose I'm in for a lecture again! Helen says: 'Ronald'--\" Ronnie lifted his eyes from the paper. \"What a nuisance it is to own that kind of name. As a small boy I was always 'Ronnie' when people were pleased, and 'Ronald' if I was in for a wigging. The feeling of it sticks to you all your life.\"  \"Of course it does,\" said Aubrey sympathetically. \"Beastly hard lines. Well? Helen says 'Ronald'--?\"  Ronnie's eyes sought the paper again; but once more the black spots danced in a wild shower. He rubbed his eyes and went on reading.  \"'Ronald, I shall have something to tell you when you get home, which will make a great difference to this Christmas, and to all Christmas-times to come. I will not put it into a letter. I will wait until you are here, and I can say it.'\"  \"What can it be?\" questioned Aubrey.  \"Oh, I know,\" said Ronnie, unsteadily--the floor was becoming soft and sandy again. \"I have heard it all before. She always thinks me extravagant at Christmas, and objects to her old people being given champagne and other seasonable good things. I have heard--heard it--all before. There was no need to write about it. And when she--when she says it, I shall jolly well tell her that a--that a--a fellow can do as he likes with his own earnings.\"  \"I should,\" said Aubrey Treherne.  Ronald went on reading, in silence.  Aubrey's eye was upon the folded sheet of paper on the floor.  Suddenly Ronnie said: \"Hullo! I'm to have it after all! Listen to this. 'P.S.--On second thoughts, now you are so nearly home, I would rather you knew what I have to say, before your return; so I am enclosing with this a pencil note I wrote some weeks ago. _Ronnie, we will have a Christmas-tree this Christmas_.' Well, I never!\" said Ronnie. \"That's not a very wild thing in the way of extravagance, is it? But it's a concession. I have wanted a Christmas-tree each Christmas. But Helen said you couldn't have a Christmas-tree in a home where there were no kids; it was absurd for two grownup people to give each other a Christmas-tree. Now, where is--\" He began searching in the empty envelope.  With a quick stealthy movement, Aubrey put his foot upon the note.  \"It is not here,\" said Ronnie, shaking out the thin sheets one by one, and tearing open the envelope. \"She has forgotten it, after all. Well--I should think it will keep. It can hardly have been important.\"  \"Evidently,\" remarked Aubrey, \"third thoughts followed second thoughts. Even Helen would scarcely put a lecture on economy into a welcome-home letter.\"  \"No, of course not,\" agreed Ronnie, and walked unsteadily to his chair.  Aubrey, stooping, transferred the note from beneath his foot to his pocket.  Ronald read his letter through again, then turned to Aubrey.  \"Look here,\" he said. \"I must send a wire. Helen wants to know whether I wish her to meet me in town, or whether I would rather she waited for me at home. What shall I say?\"  Aubrey Treherne rose. \"Think it over,\" he said, \"while I fetch a form.\"  He left the room.  He was some time in finding that form.  When he returned his face was livid, his hand shook.  Ronald sat in absorbed contemplation of the Infant.  \"It appears more perfect every time one sees it,\" he remarked, without looking at Aubrey.  Aubrey handed him a form for foreign telegrams, and a fountain pen.  \"What are you going to say to--to your wife?\" he asked in a low voice.  \"I don't know,\" said Ronnie, vaguely. \"What a jolly pen! What am I to do with this?\"  \"You are to let Helen know whether she is to meet you in town, or to wait at the Grange.\"  \"Ah, I remember. What do you advise, Treherne? I don't seem able to make plans.\"  \"I should say most decidedly, let her wait for you at home.\"  \"Yes, I think so too. I shall be rushing around in town. I can get home before tea-time. How shall I word it?\"  \"Why not say: _Owing to satisfactory news in letter, prefer to meet you quietly at home. All well._\"  Ronnie wrote this at Aubrey's dictation; then he paused.  \"What news?\" he asked, perplexed at the words he himself had written.  \"Why--that Helen is quite well. Isn't that satisfactory news?\"  \"Oh, of course. I see. Yes.\"  \"Then you might add: _Will wire train from London._\"  \"But I know the train now,\" objected Ronnie. \"I have been thinking of it for weeks! I shall catch the 3 o'clock express.\"  \"Very well, then add: _Coming by 3 o'clock train. Home to tea._\"  Ronnie wrote it--a joyous smile on his lips and in his eyes.  \"It sounds so near,\" he said. \"After seven long months--it sounds so near!\"  \"Now,\" said Aubrey, \"give it to me. I will take it out for you. I know an office where one can hand in wires at any hour.\"  \"You _are_ a good fellow,\" said Ronnie gratefully.  \"And now look here,\" continued Aubrey. \"Before I go, you must turn into bed, old chap. You need sleep more than you know. I can do a little prescribing myself. I am going to give you a dose of sleeping stuff which brought me merciful oblivion, after long nights of maddening wakefulness. You will feel another man, when you wake in the morning. But I am coming with you to the Hague. I can tend the Infant, while you go to the publishers. I will see you safely on board at the Hook, on the following evening, and next day you will be at home. After all those months alone in the long grass, you don't want any more solitary travelling. Now come to bed.\"  Ronnie rose unsteadily. \"Aubrey,\" he said, \"you are a most awfully good fellow. I shall tell Helen. She will--will--will be so--so grateful. I'm perfectly all right, you know; but other people seem so--so busy, and--and--so vague. You will help me to--to--to--arrest their attention. I must take the Infant to bed.\"  \"Yes, yes,\" said Aubrey; \"we will find a cosy place for the Infant. If Helen were here she would provide a bassinet. Don't forget that joke. It will amuse Helen. I make you a present of it. _If Helen were here she would provide a bassinet and a pram for the Infant of Prague_.\"  Ronnie laughed. \"I shall tell Helen you said so.\" Then, carrying the 'cello, he lurched unsteadily through the doorway. The Infant's head had a narrow escape.         *       *       *       *       *  Aubrey Treherne sent off the telegram. He required to alter only one word.  When it reached Helen, the next morning at breakfast, it read thus: _Owing to astonishing news in letter prefer to meet you quietly at home. All well. Coming by 3 o'clock train. Home to tea_.--_Ronald_.  Helen suffered a sharp pang of disappointment. She had expected something quite different. The adjective \"astonishing\" seemed strangely cold and unlike Ronnie. She had thought he would say \"wonderful,\" or \"unbelievable,\" or \"glorious.\"  But before she had finished her first cup of coffee, she had reasoned herself back into complete content. Ronnie, in an unusual fit of thoughtfulness, had remembered her feeling about the publicity of telegrams. She had so often scolded him for putting \"darling\" and \"best of love\" into messages which all had to be shouted by telephone from the postal town, into the little village office which, being also the village grocery store, was a favourite rendezvous at all hours of the day for village gossips.  It was quite unusually considerate of Ronnie to curb the glowing words he must have longed to pour forth. The very effort of that curbing, had reduced him to a somewhat stilted adjective.  So Helen finished her lonely breakfast with thoughts of glad anticipation. Ronnie's return was drawing so near. Only two more breakfasts without him. At the third she would be pouring out his coffee, and hearing him comment on the excellence of Blake's hot buttered toast!  Then, with a happy heart, she went up to the nursery.  Yet--unconsciously--the pang remained.     CHAPTER VII  A FRIEND IN NEED   As Aubrey Treherne, on his way back from despatching the telegram, stood in the general entrance hall, fumbling with the latch-key at the door of his own flat, a tall young man in an ulster dashed up the wide stone stairs, rapidly read the names on the various brass plates, and arrived at Aubrey's just as his door had yielded to persuasion and was admitting him into his own small passage.  \"Hullo,\" said a very British voice. \"Do you happen to be Ronald West's wife's cousin?\"  Aubrey turned in the doorway, taking stock of his interlocutor. He saw a well-knit, youthful figure, a keen resourceful face, and a pair of exceedingly bright brown eyes, unwavering in the steady penetration of their regard. Already they had taken him in, from top to toe, and were looking past him in a rapid investigation of as much of his flat as could be seen from the doorway.  Aubrey was caught!  He had fully intended muffling his electric bell, and not being at home to visitors.  But this brisk young man, with an atmosphere about him of always being ten minutes ahead of time, already had one of his very muddy boots inside the door, and eagerly awaited the answer to his question; so it was useless to reply to the latter in German, and to bang the former.  Therefore: \"I have that honour,\" replied Aubrey, with the best grace he could muster.  \"Ah! Well, I'm sorry to bother you so late, but I must have a word with you; and then I am going round to spend the night with Ronnie at his hotel.\"  \"Come in,\" said Aubrey, in a low voice; \"but we must not talk in the passage or we shall wake him. I saw he was not fit to be alone, so I sent to the hotel for his traps, and am putting him up here. He turned in, half an hour ago, and seemed"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16455"],["title","The Otterbein Hymnal (#0)"],["body","the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net      THE  OTTERBEIN HYMNAL  FOR USE IN  PUBLIC and SOCIAL WORSHIP.   PREPARED BY  EDMUND S. LORENZ.   DAYTON, OHIO:  UNITED BRETHREN PUBLISHING HOUSE,  1892.   The General Conference of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ, at its session in May, 1886, ordered,--  \"That a small hymnal, adapted to general church purposes, be published soon.\"  _ADVISORY COMMITTEE_  MUSICAL.  SAMUEL E. KUMLER. CALVIN H. LYON. MRS. A.R. SHAUCK. JUDGE JOHN A. SHAUCK  LITERARY.  PROF. J.P. LANDIS, D.D., PH.D.   COPYRIGHT, 1886, BY W.J. SHUEY, AGENT.     Introduction   The General Conference of 1889 ordered the publication of a hymnal that should be fully adapted to the needs of our church. In compliance with these instructions, the publishing agent, Rev. W.J. Shuey, arranged for its issue. Rev. E.S. Lorenz, well and favorably known throughout the Church, was asked to edit it, and, with the assistance of a thoroughly competent committee, has accomplished his task. I have carefully examined it in every part, and cannot see where any improvement can be made. It is pre-eminently a United Brethren Hymn-Book, providing as it does for every phase of our characteristic church life. It combines the solidity and stateliness of the standard hymns of the ages, with the life and sprightliness of the modern gospel song. The most recent songs are here for the young people, while the older members of the Church will hail with delight the reappearance of old songs dear to the hearts of many of us, because they are precious and good, and because our mothers sang them. Meeting every need of the public service, revival and social meetings, the Sunday-school, and the family, I can most cheerfully recommend this collection of hymns to our people, and trust that it will speedily be permitted to bring its help and blessing into every United Brethren church in our broad land, and beyond the seas, and that it will prove one of the many tender ties that unite our widely scattered members.                                  A. WEAVER,                                 _Senior Bishop._ DAYTON, OHIO, April 9, 1890.     PREFACE.   To he useful, a hymnal must express the peculiar type of Christian life characterizing the denomination it is to serve. The Church of the United Brethren in Christ emphasizes the necessity of Christian experience--experimental religion, the fathers would have phrased it--and recognises revival effort as the characteristic phase of its church activity; hence, its hymnal must furnish ample expression for its full and varied Christian experience and large facilities for revival work. In attempting to do this, the other phases of church life, which it has in common with other denominations, have not been forgotten or ignored, and it is hoped this collection of hymns and songs will be found as full and symmetrical as the church life it seeks to express.  In order to meet the needs of the many stages of literary and musical culture, hymns and tunes of the highest artistic merit stand side by side with songs whose practical value and spiritual purpose must atone for lack of literary and musical grace.  Doubtless many favorites will be missed from these pages, but the body of popular sacred songs is so large and rich that it was impossible to include everything desirable in so small a volume.  To the many brethren, whose number makes personal mention impossible, who kindly responded to a call for suggestions and advice, the thanks of the editor are due. While all could not be accepted, they have been very helpful, and have had large influence in giving character to the book. The valuable assistance furnished by the Advisory Committee deserves most kindly and hearty recognition. The owners of the many valuable copyright songs, in connection with which their names severally appear, will accept thanks for the kindness which so greatly enriches these pages.  That this volume will prove an effective instrument in the hands of the workers of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ for the accomplishment of great and lasting good, and bring to many hearts the same comfort and joy which its preparation brought to that of the editor, is his earnest hope and prayer.

L.M.  _Psalm 100._     (1)  Before Jehovah's awful throne,   Ye nations, bow with sacred joy; Know that the Lord is God alone;   He can create, and he destroy.  2 His sovereign power, without our aid,   Made us of clay, and formed us men; And when like wandering sheep we strayed,   He brought us to his fold again.  3 We are his people, we his care--   Our souls, and all our mortal frame; What lasting honors shall we rear,   Almighty Maker, to thy name?  4 We'll crowd thy gates with thankful songs,   High as the heavens our voices raise; And earth, with her ten thousand tongues,   Shall fill thy courts with sounding praise.  5 Wide as the world is thy command;   Vast as eternity thy love; Firm as a rock thy truth shall stand,   When rolling years shall cease to move.       Isaac Watts.   4     Old Hundred. L.M.  _All Men Invited to Praise God._     (3)  From all that dwell below the skies Let the Creator's praise arise; Let the Redeemer's name be sung, Through every land, by every tongue.  2 Eternal are thy mercies, Lord; Eternal truth attends thy word; Thy praise shall sound from shore to shore, Till suns shall rise and set no more.  3 Your lofty themes, ye mortals, bring, In songs of praise divinely sing: The great salvation loud proclaim, And shout for joy the Savior's name.  4 In every land begin the song; To every land the strains belong; In cheerful sounds all voices raise, And till the world with loudest praise.       Isaac Watts, 1713.   5     Old Hundred. L.M.  _Psalm 103._     (6)  Awake, my soul, awake my tongue, My God demands the grateful song; Let all my inmost powers record The wondrous mercy of the Lord.  2 Divinely free his mercy flows, Forgives my sins, allays my woes, And bids approaching death remove, And crowns me with indulgent love.  3 His mercy, with unchanging rays, Forever shines, while time decays; And children's children shall record The truth and goodness of the Lord.  4 While all his works his praise proclaim And men and angels bless his name, Oh, let my heart, my life, my tongue Attend, and join the blissful song!       Anne Steele, 1760.   6     Old Hundred.

L.M.  _Omnipresence._     (17)  Lord of all being! throned afar, Thy glory flames from sun and star; Center and soul of ev'ry sphere, Yet to each loving heart how near!  2 Sun of our life! thy quick'ning ray Sheds on our path the glow of day; Star of our hope! thy softened light Cheers the long watches of the night.  3 Our midnight is thy smile withdrawn; Our noontide is thy gracious dawn; Our rainbow arch thy mercy's sign; All, save the clouds of sin, are thine.  4 Grant us thy truth to make us free, And kindling hearts that burnt for thee, Till all thy living altars claim One holy light, one heavenly flame.       Oliver Wendell Holmes, 1848.   8     Duke Street. L.M.  _The Majesty of God._     (7)  Come, oh, my soul, in sacred lays, Attempt thy great Creator's praise; But oh! what tongue can speak his fame? What mortal verse can reach the theme?  2 Enthroned amidst the radiant spheres, He glory like a garment wears; To form a robe of light divine, Ten thousand suns around him shine.  3 In all our Master's grand designs, Omnipotence with wisdom shines; His works, through all this wondrous frame, Bear the great impress of his name.  4 Raised on Devotion's lofty wing, Do thou, my soul! his glories sing; And let his praise employ thy tongue, Till listening worlds applaud the song.
