An old German musician who used to play with him in the Orchestra told me that Lanier was the finest flutist he had ever heard.  It was in Baltimore, too, that he gave the lectures which resulted in his most important prose-writings, \"The Science of English Verse,\" \"The English Novel,\" \"Shakespeare and His Forerunners.\"  In August, 1874, at Sunnyside, Georgia, amid the loneliness of abandoned farms, the glory of cornfields, and the mysterious beauty of forest, he wrote \"Corn,\" the first of his poems to attract the attention of the country. It was published in _Lippincott's_ in 1875. Charlotte Cushman was so charmed by it that she sought out the author in Baltimore, and the two became good friends.  At 64 Centre Street, Baltimore, Lanier wrote \"The Symphony,\" which he said took hold of him \"about four days ago like a real James River ague, and I have been in a mortal shake with the same, day and night, ever since,\" which is the only way that a real poem or real music or a real picture ever can get into the world. He says that he \"will be rejoiced when it is finished, for it verily racks all the bones of my spirit.\" It appeared in _Lippincott's_, June, 1875.  Lanier was at 66 Centre Street, Baltimore, when he wrote the words of the Centennial Cantata, which he said he \"tried to make as simple and candid as a melody of Beethoven.\" He wrote to a friend that he was not disturbed because a paper had said that the poem of the Cantata was like a \"communication from the spirit of Nat Lee through a Bedlamite medium.\" It was \"but a little grotesque episode, as when a catbird paused in the midst of the most exquisite roulades and melodies to mew and then take up his song again.\"         *       *       *       *       *  In December of that year he was compelled to seek a milder climate in Florida, taking with him a commission to write a book about Florida for the J.B. Lippincott Company. Upon arriving at Tampa, he wrote to a friend:      Tampa is the most forlorn collection of little one-story frame     houses imaginable, and as May and I walked behind our landlord,     who was piloting us to Orange Grove Hotel, our hearts fell nearer     and nearer towards the sand through which we dragged. Presently     we turned a corner and were agreeably surprised to find ourselves     in front of a large three-story house with old nooks and corners,     clean and comfortable in appearance and surrounded by orange     trees in full fruit. We have a large room in the second story,     opening upon a generous balcony fifty feet long, into which     stretch the liberal arms of a fine orange tree holding out their     fruitage to our very lips. In front is a sort of open plaza     containing a pretty group of gnarled live-oaks full of moss and     mistletoe.  [Illustration: SIDNEY LANIER From a photograph owned by H.W. Lanier]  In May he made an excursion of which he wrote:      For a perfect journey God gave us a perfect day. The little     Ocklawaha steamboat _Marion_--a steamboat which is like nothing     in the world so much as a Pensacola gopher with a preposterously     exaggerated back--had started from Palatka some hours before     daylight, having taken on her passengers the night previous; and     by seven o'clock of such a May morning as no words could     describe, unless words were themselves May mornings, we had made     the twenty-five miles up the St. John's to where the Ocklawaha     flows into that stream nearly opposite Welaka, one hundred miles     above Jacksonville.  It was on this journey that he saw the most magnificent residence that he had ever beheld, the home of an old friend of his, an alligator, who possessed a number of such palatial mansions and could change his residence at any time by the simple process of swimming from one to another.  On his return to Baltimore he lived at 55 Lexington in four rooms arranged as a French flat. He makes mention of a gas stove \"on which my comrade magically produces the best coffee in the world, and this, with fresh eggs (boiled through the same handy little machine), bread, butter, and milk, forms our breakfast.\" December 3 he writes from the little French flat, announcing that he \"has plunged in and brought forth captive a long Christmas poem for _Every Saturday_,\" a Baltimore weekly publication. The poem was \"Hard Times in Elfland.\" He says, \"Wife and I have been to look at a lovely house with eight rooms and many charming appliances,\" whereof the rent was less than that of the four rooms.  The next month he writes from 33 Denmead Street, the eight-room house, to which he had gone, with the attendant necessity of buying \"at least three hundred twenty-seven household utensils\" and \"hiring a colored gentlewoman who is willing to wear out my carpets, burn out my range, freeze out my water-pipes, and be generally useful.\" He mentions having written a couple of poems, and part of an essay on Beethoven and Bismarck, but his chief delight is in his new home, which invests him with the dignity of paying taxes and water rates. He takes the view that no man is a Bohemian who has to pay water rates and street tax.         *       *       *       *       *  In addition to supporting his new dignity he finds time and strength for his usual work, and he writes on January 30, 1878, \"I have been mainly at work on some unimportant prose matter for pot-boilers, but I get off a short poem occasionally, and in the background of my mind am writing my Jacquerie.\" Unfortunately, \"Jacquerie\" remained in the background of his mind, with the exception of two songs--all we have to indicate what a stirring presentation our literature might have had of the fourteenth century awakening of \"Jacques Bonhomme,\" that early precursor of the more terrible arousing in 'Ninety-Three.  In the latter part of the year Lanier was living at Number 180 St. Paul Street, and in December he wrote to a friend:      \"Bayard Taylor's death slices a huge cantle out of the world.... It     only seems that he has gone to some other Germany a little farther     off.... He was such a fine fellow, one almost thinks he might     have talked Death over and made him forego his stroke.\"  At Bayard Taylor's home, where Lanier visited, were two immense chestnut trees, much loved by the two poets. Mrs. Taylor wrote that one of the trees died soon after the death of its poet owner. The other lingered until a short time after the passing of Lanier. It was in connection with the lines of the \"Cantata,\" written in the Baltimore home of the Southern poet, that the poet friends began a long-continued series of letters which one loves to read on a winter night, when the winds are battling with the world outside, and the fire gleams redly in the open grate, and the lamp burns softly on the library table, and all things invite to poetic dreams.  November 12, 1880, Sidney Lanier wrote to his publisher a letter of appreciation of the beautiful work done upon his volume, \"The Boy's King Arthur.\" It is dated at Number 435 North Calvert Street, the latest Baltimore address that we have.         *       *       *       *       *  The distinction Sidney Lanier achieved as first flutist in the orchestra of the Peabody Institute led to an offer of a position in the Thomas Orchestra, which the condition of his health did not permit him to accept.  In the summer of 1880 his \"Science of English Verse\" was published. \"Shakespeare and His Forerunners\" resulted from his work with his classes in Elizabethan Poetry. \"The English Novel\" is the course of lectures on \"Personality Illustrated by the Development of Fiction,\" delivered at Johns Hopkins University in the winter of 1880-'81. As we read the printed work in its depth and strength, we do not realize that his wife took the notes from his whispered dictation, and that his auditors as they listened trembled lest, with each sentence, that deep musical voice should fall on eternal silence. All this while he had been working at lectures and boys' books, when, as he said, \"a thousand songs are singing in my heart that will certainly kill me if I do not utter them soon.\" One of the thousand, \"Sunrise,\" he uttered with a temperature of 104 degrees burning out his life, but it is full of the rapture of the dawn.  To the pines of North Carolina the poet was taken, in the hope that they might give him of their strength. But the wind-song through their swaying branches lulled him to his last earthly sleep. On the 7th of September the narrow stream of his earthly existence broadened and deepened and flowed triumphantly into the great ocean of Eternal Life.     \"THE POET OF THE PINES\"  PAUL HAMILTON HAYNE   \"Why are not your countrymen all poets, surrounded as they are by beautiful things to inspire them?\" I asked a young Swiss.  \"Because,\" he replied, \"my people are so accustomed to beauty that it has no influence upon them.\"  They had never known anything but beauty: there were no sharp contrasts to clash, flint-like, and strike out sparks of divine fire.  Had the beauty of old Charleston produced the same negative effect, Southern literature would have suffered a distinct loss--if that may be regarded as lost which has never been possessed. For centuries the Queen of the Sea stood in a vision of splendor, the tumultuous waves of the Atlantic dashing at her feet, eternal sunshine crowning her royal brow. Her gardens were stately with oleanders and pomegranates, brilliant with jonquils and hyacinths, myrtle and gardenia. Roses of the olden time, Lancaster and York and the sweet pink cinnamon, breathed the fragrance of days long past. The hills that environed her were snowy with Cherokee roses and odorous with jasmine and honeysuckle. Her people dwelt in mansions in the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16622"],["title","Literary Hearthstones of Dixie (#5)"],["body","of which ancestral ghosts from Colonial days kept guard.  In old Charleston that goes back in history almost a century before the Revolution and extends to the opening of the Sixties--the old Queen City by the Sea, which now few are left to remember--was a circle of congenial creative souls just before the first shot at Fort Sumter heralded the destruction of the old-time life of the Colonial city. William Gilmore Simms was the head and mentor of the brilliant little band, and the much younger men, Paul Hamilton Hayne and Henry Timrod, were the fiery souls that gave it the mental electricity necessary to furnish the motive power. Through all the coming days of trial and hardship, of aspiration and defeat, of watching from the towers of high achievement or lying prone in the valley of failure, not one of that little circle ever lost the golden memory of those magic evenings in the home of the novelist and poet, the thinker and dreamer, William Gilmore Simms, the intellectual father of them all.  At that time in the old city was another picturesque home that harked back to Colonial days--stately, veranda-circled, surrounded by that fascinating atmosphere of history and poetry known to those old dwellings alone of all the structures of the New World: the home of the Southern poet of Nature, Paul Hamilton Hayne. Its many-windowed front looked cheerfully out upon a wide lawn radiant with flowers of bygone fashion, loved by the poets of olden times, and bright with the greenery that kept perpetual summer around the historic dwelling. This beautiful pre-Revolutionary home was burned in the bombardment of Charleston, and with it was destroyed the library that had been the pride of the poet's heart.  In this old home the Poet of the Pines was born of a family that looked back to the opening days of the eighteenth century, when Charleston was young, glowing with the beauty of her birth into the forests of the New World, wearing proudly the tiara of her loyalty to King and Crown. Looking back along the road that stretched between the first Hayne, who helped to make of the old city a memory to be cherished on the page of history and a picture on the canvas of the present to awaken admiration, and the young soul that looked with poetic vision on the beginning of the new era, one sees a long succession of brilliant names and powerful figures.  Paul Hayne was the great-grand-nephew of \"the Martyr Hayne,\" who has given to Charleston her only authentic ghost-story, the scene of which was a brick dwelling which stood till 1896 at the corner of Atlantic and Meeting Streets. Colonel Isaac H. Hayne, a soldier of the Revolution, secured a parole, that he might be with his dying wife. While on parole he was ordered to fight against his country. Rather than be forced to the crime of treason, he broke his parole, was captured and condemned to death. From her beautiful, mahogany-panelled drawing-room in that old home where the two streets cross, his sister-in-law, who had gone with his two little children to plead for his life, watched as he passed on his way from the vault of the old Custom House, used then as a prison, to the gallows. \"Return, return to us!\" she called in an agony of grief. As he walked on he replied, \"If I can I will.\" It is said that his old negro mammy, to whom he was always \"my chile,\" ran out to the gate with the playthings she had fondly cherished since the days when they were to him irresistible attractions, crying, \"Come back! Come back!\" To both calls his heart responded with such longing love that when the soul was released, the old home knew the step and the voice again. Ever afterward when eventide fell, one standing at that window would hear a ghostly voice from the street below and steps upon the stairs and in the hall; footsteps of one coming--never going.  Paul Hamilton Hayne's uncle, Colonel Arthur P. Hayne, fought under Jackson at New Orleans, and was afterward United States Senator. Paul was nephew of Robert Y. Hayne, whose career as a statesman and an orator won for him a fame that has not faded with the years. With this uncle, Paul found a home in his orphaned childhood.  Of his sailor father, Lieutenant Hayne, his shadowy memory takes form in a poem, one stanza of which gives us a view of the brave seaman's life and death:      He perished not in conflict nor in flame,       No laurel garland rests upon his tomb;       Yet in stern duty's path he met his doom;     A life heroic, though unwed to fame.  Though he pathetically mourns:      Never in childhood have I blithely sprung       To catch my father's voice, or climb his knee,  still        Love limned his wavering likeness on my soul,       Till through slow growths it waxed a perfect whole     Of clear conceptions, brightening heart and mind.  That clear conception remained a lifelong treasure in the poet's heart.  Through a great ancestral corridor had Paul Hamilton Hayne descended, with soul enjewelled with all the gems of character and thought that had sparkled in the long gallery through which he had travelled into the earth-light.  In the school of Mr. Coates, in Charleston, he was fitted to enter Charleston College, a plain, narrow-fronted structure with six severely classic columns supporting the façade. It stood on the foundation of the \"old brick barracks\" held by the Colonial troops through a six-weeks siege by twelve thousand British regulars under Sir Henry Clinton.  Hayne satisfied the hunger and thirst of his excursive and ardent mind by browsing in the Charleston Library on Broad and Church streets. It may be that sometimes, on his way to that friendly resort, he passed the old house on Church Street which once sheltered General Washington; a substantial three-storied building with ornamental woodwork which might cause its later use as a bakery to seem out of harmony to any but _chefs_ with high ideals of their art.  The Library of old Charleston was composed chiefly of English classics and the literature of France in the olden time when Europe furnished us with something more than anarchy, clothes, and bargain-counter titles. A sample of the Young America of that early day asked an old gentleman, \"Why are you always reading that old Montaigne?\" The reply was, \"Why, child, there is in this book all that a gentleman needs to think about,\" with the discreet addition, \"Not a book for little girls, though.\" If we find in our circle of poets a certain stateliness of style scarcely to be looked for in a somewhat new republic that might be expected to rush pell-mell after an idea and capture it by the sudden impact of a lusty blow, after the manner of the minute-men catching a red-coat at Lexington; if we observe in their writing old world expressions that woo us subtly, like the odor of lavender from a long-closed linen chest, we may attribute it to the fact that aristocratic old Charleston, though the first to assert her independence of the political yoke, yet clung tenaciously to the literary ideals of the Old World.  On Meeting Street was Apprentices' Library Hall, where Glidden led his hearers through the intricacies of Egyptian Archæology. Here Agassiz sometimes lectured on Zoölogy, and our youthful poet may have watched animals from the jungle climb up the blackboard at the touch of what would have been only a piece of chalk in any other hand, but became a magic creative force under the guidance of that wizard of science. Here he could have followed with Thackeray the varying fortunes and ethic vagaries of the royal Georges. His poetic soul may have kindled with the fire of Macready's \"Hamlet\" when, thinking that he was too far down the slope of life to hark back to the days of the youthful Dane, he proved that he still had the glow of the olden time in his soul by reading the part as only Macready could. In this old hall he may have looked upon the paintings which inspired him to create his own pictures, luminous with softly tinted word-colors.  Meeting Street seems to have been named with reference to its uses, for here, too, was the old theatre, gone long ago, where Fannie Ellsler danced with a wavering, quivering, shimmering grace that drove humming-birds to despair. In that theatre it may be that Paul Hayne heard Jenny Lind fill the night with a melody which would irradiate his soul throughout life and reproduce itself in the music-tones of his gently cadenced verse. There the ill-fated Adrienne Lecouvreur lived and died again in her wondrous transmigration into the soul of the great Rachel.  When a boy, Hayne's heart may have often thrilled to the voice of the scholarly Hugh Swinton Legare, as he made the heart of some classic old poem live in the music of his organ-tones.  A sensitive soul surrounded by the influences of life in old Charleston had many incentives to high and harmonious expression.  That the Queen City of the Sea did not claim the privilege of the fickleness alleged to be incident to the feminine character is illustrated by the fact that she had but two postmasters in seventy years, a circumstance worthy of note \"in days like these, when ev'ry gate is thronged with suitors, all the markets overflow,\" and the disbursing counter is crowded with claimants for the rewards due for commendable activity in the campaign. One of those two was Peter Bascot, an appointee of Washington. The other was Alfred Huger, \"the last of the Barons,\" who had refused to take the office in the time of Bascot.  In old Charleston the servants were the severest sticklers for propriety, and the butlers of the old families rivalled each other in the loftiness of their standards. Jack, the butler of \"the last of the Barons,\" was wide awake to the demands of his position, and when an old sea captain, an intimate friend of Mr. Huger, dining with the family, asked for rice when the fish was served he was first met with a chill silence. Thinking that he had not been heard, he repeated the request. Jack bent and whispered to"]]]
