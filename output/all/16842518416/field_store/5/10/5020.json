L.M.  _Life-long Praise._     (12)  God of my life! through all my days My grateful powers shall sound my praise; The song shall wake with opening light, And warble to the silent night.  2 When anxious cares would break my rest, And griefs would tear my throbbing breast, Thy tuneful praises, raised on high, Shall check the murmur and the sigh.  3 When death o'er nature shall prevail, And all its powers of language fail, Joy thro' my swimming eyes shall break, And mean the thanks I cannot speak.  4 Soon shall I learn th' exalted strains, Which echo o'er the heavenly plains, And emulate, with joy unknown, The growing seraphs round thy throne.       Philip Doddridge, 1740.   10     Rockingham. L.M.  _Psalm 106._     (15)  Oh, render thanks to God above, The fountain of eternal love; Whose mercy firm, through ages past, Hath stood, and shall forever last.  2 Who can his mighty deeds express, Not only vast--but numberless? What mortal eloquence can raise His tribute of immortal praise?  3 Extend to me that favor, Lord, Thou to thy chosen dost afford; When thou return'st to set them free. Let thy salvation visit me.       Tate-Brady.   11     Rockingham. L.M.  _God Revealed in Christ._     (600)  Now to the Lord, a noble song! Awake, my soul! awake, my tongue, Hosanna to th' eternal name, And all his boundless love proclaim.  2 See where it shines in Jesus' face,-- The brightest image of his grace! God, in the person of his Son, Has all his mightiest works outdone.  3 Grace!--'tis a sweet, a charming theme; My thoughts rejoice at Jesus' name: Ye angels! dwell upon the sound; Ye heavens! reflect it to the ground.  4 Oh! may I live to reach the place, Where he unveils his lovely face, Where all his beauties you behold, And sing his name to harps of gold.       Isaac Watts, 1707.   12     Rockingham. L.M.  _Unceasing Praise._     (13)  My God! my King! thy various praise Shall fill the remnant of my days; Thy grace employ my humble tongue, Till death and glory raise the song.  2 The wings of every hour shall bear Some thankful tribute to thine ear; And every setting sun shall see New works of duty, done for thee.  3 But who can speak thy wondrous deeds? Thy greatness all our thoughts exceeds; Vast and unsearchable thy ways-- Vast and immortal be thy praise.       Isaac Watts, 1719.   13     Otterbein. L.M.  _Psalm 95._     (4)  Oh, come, loud anthems let us sing, Loud thanks to our Almighty King! For we our voices high should raise, When our salvation's Rock we praise.  2 Into his presence let us haste, To thank him for his favors past; To him address, in joyful songs, The praise that to his name belongs.  3 Oh, let us to his courts repair, And bow with adoration there; Down on our knees, devoutly, all Before the Lord, our Maker, fall.       Nahum Tate, 1696.   14     Park Street. L.M.  _Joining in Praise._     (75)  Sweet is the work, my God! my King! To praise thy name, give thanks and sing; To show thy love by morning light, And talk of all thy truth at night.  2 Sweet is the day of sacred rest; No mortal care shall seize my breast; O may my heart in tune be found, Like David's harp of solemn sound.  3 My heart shall triumph in the Lord, And bless his works, and bless his word; Thy works of grace, how bright they shine! How deep thy counsels! how divine!       Isaac Watts.   15     Harvey's Chant. C. M.  _The Goodness of God in His Works._     (26)  Hail! great Creator, wise and good!   To thee our songs we raise; Nature, through all her various scenes,   Invites us to thy praise.  2 At morning, noon, and evening mild,   Fresh wonders strike our view; And, while we gaze, our hearts exult   With transports ever new.  3 Thy glory beams in every star,   Which gilds the gloom of night; And decks the smiling face of morn   With rays of cheerful light.  4 And while, in all thy wondrous ways,   Thy varied love we see; Oh, may our hearts, great God, be led   Through all thy works to thee.       Anon. 1795.   16     Harvey's Chant. C.M.  _Praise at all Times._     (27)  My soul shall praise thee, O my God   Through all my mortal days, And in eternity prolong   Thy vast, thy boundless praise.  2 In every smiling, happy hour,   Be this my sweet employ; Thy praise refines my earthly bliss,   And heightens all my joy.  3 When anxious grief and gloomy care   Afflict my throbbing breast, My tongue shall learn to speak thy praise,   And lull each pain to rest.  4 Nor shall my tongue alone proclaim   The honors of my God; My life, with all its active powers,   Shall spread thy praise abroad.  5 And when these lips shall cease to move,   When death shall close these eyes, My soul shall then to nobler heights   Of joy and transport rise.       O. Heigenbotham.   17     Harvey's Chant. C.M.  _Psalm 66._     (24)  Lift up to God the voice of praise,   Whose breath our souls inspired; Loud, and more loud the anthem raise,   With grateful ardor fired.  2 Lift up to God the voice of praise,   Whose goodness, passing thought, Loads every minute as it flies,   With benefits unsought.  3 Lift up to God the voice of praise   From whom salvation flows, Who sent his Son, our souls to save   From everlasting woes.  4 Lift up to God the voice of praise,   For hope's transporting ray, Which lights, through darkest shades of death,   To realms of endless day.       Ralph Wardlaw, 1803.   18     Nicæa 11s, 12s, & 10s.  _Adoration._  Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!   Early in the morning our song shall rise to thee; Holy, holy, holy! merciful and mighty!   God over all and blest eternally.  2 Holy, holy, holy! all saints adore thee,   Casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea; Cherubim and seraphim falling down before thee,   Who wast, and art, and evermore shall be.  3 Holy, holy, holy! tho' the darkness hide thee,   Though the eye of sinful man thy glory may not see; Only thou art holy, there is none beside thee;   Perfect in power, in love, and purity.  4 Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!   All thy works shall praise thy name in earth, and sky, and sea; Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty!   God over all, and blest eternally.       Reginald Heber--_alt._   19     Nicæa 11s, 12s, & 10s.  _Psalm 95._     (18)  Sing to the Lord Jehovah's name,   And in his strength rejoice; When his salvation is our theme,   Exalted be our voice.  2 With thanks approach his awful sight,   And psalms of honor sing; The Lord's a God of boundless might--   The whole creation's King.  3 Come, and with humble souls adore;   Come, kneel before his face; Oh, may the creatures of his power   Be children of his grace.  4 Now is the time--he bends his ear,   And waits for your request; Come, lest he rouse his wrath, and swear,   \"Ye shall not see my rest.\"       Isaac Watts, 1719.   20     St. Thomas. S.M.  _Bless the Lord._     (29)  Oh, bless the Lord, my soul!   Let all within me join, And aid my tongue to bless his name,   Whose favors are divine.  2 Oh, bless the Lord, my soul,   Nor let his mercies lie Forgotten in unthankfulness,   And without praises die.  3 'Tis he forgives thy sins--   'Tis he relieves thy pain-- 'Tis he that heals thy sicknesses,   And gives thee strength again.  4 He crowns thy life with love,   When ransomed from the grave; He who redeemed my soul from hell,   Hath sovereign power to save.       Isaac Watts.   21     Silver Street. S.M.  _Psalm 103._     (34)  Come, sound his praise abroad,   And hymns of glory sing; Jehovah is the sov'reign God,   The universal king.  2 He formed the deeps unknown;   He gave the seas their bound; The watery worlds are all his own,   And all the solid ground.  3 Come, worship at his throne;   Come, bow before the Lord; We are his works, and not our own;   He formed us by his word.  4 To-day attend his voice,   Nor dare provoke his rod; Come, like the people of his choice,   And own your gracious God.       Isaac Watts, 1719.   22     Gates of Praise.  _Gates of Praise._  Lift up the Gates of Praise,   That we may enter in, And o'er salvation's walls proclaim   That Christ redeems from sin.  Cho.--The stars may praise the hand         That decks the sky above,       But man alone can tell the pow'r         Of Christ's redeeming love.  2 God's works reveal his might,   His majesty and grace; But not the tender Father's love   That saves a dying race.  3 Then let the voice of praise   To heavenly courts ascend, Till with the songs the angels sing   Our hallelujahs blend.  4 To him that hath redeemed   Our souls from sin's dark maze; The Hope and Savior of mankind,   Be everlasting praise.       M. E. Servoss.   23     Leighton. S.M.  _Exhortation to Praise._     (32)  Stand up, and bless the Lord,   Ye people of his choice! Stand up, and bless the Lord, your God,.   With heart, and soul, and voice.  2 Though high above all praise,   Above all blessing high, Who would not fear his holy name,   And laud and magnify?  3 Oh, for the living flame   From his own altar brought, To touch our lips, our minds inspire,   And wing to heaven our thought!  4 God is our strength and song,   And his salvation ours; Then be his love in Christ proclaimed,   With all our ransomed powers.       James Montgomery, 1825.   24     Wilmot. 8s & 7s.  _Psalm 148._     (53)  Praise the Lord, ye heavens! adore him;   Praise him, angels in the height! Sun and moon! rejoice before him;   Praise him, all ye stars of light!  2 Praise the Lord, for he hath spoken;   Worlds his mighty voice obeyed; Laws, which never shall be broken,   For their guidance he hath made.  3 Praise the Lord, for he is glorious;   Never shall his promise fail; God hath made his saints victorious;   Sin and death shall not prevail.  4 Praise the God of our salvation,   Hosts on high! his power proclaim Heaven and earth, and all creation!   Laud and magnify his name.       John Kempthorne, 1810.   25     Horton. 7s.  _Psalm 107._     (50)  Thank and praise Jehovah's name;   For his mercies, firm and sure, From eternity the same   To"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16455"],["title","The Otterbein Hymnal (#2)"],["body","endure.  2 Let the ransomed thus rejoice,   Gathered out of every land; As the people of his choice,   Plucked from the destroyer's hand.  3 Praise him, ye who know his love;   Praise him from the depths beneath; Praise him in the heights above;   Praise your Maker all that breathe.  4 For his truth and mercy stand,   Past, and present, and to be, Like the years of his right hand--   Like his own eternity.       James Montgomery, 1822.   26     Hallelujah! 8s & 7s.  _Praise the Lord._  Hallelujah! song of gladness;   Song of everlasting joy; Hallelujah! song the sweetest   That can angel hosts employ.  Cho.--Praise ye the Lord! sing Hallelujah!       Praise ye the Lord! sing Hallelujah!       Praise ye the Lord! sing Hallelujah!       Praise ye the Lord!  2 Hallelujah! Church victorious,   Thou mayst lift this joyful strain; Hallelujah! songs of triumph,   Well befit the ransomed train.  3 Hallelujah! let our voices   Rise to heav'n with full accord; Hallelujah! ev'ry moment   Brings us nearer to the Lord.  4 But our earnest supplication,   Holy God, we raise to thee; Bring us to thy blissful presence.   Let us all thy glory see.       Anon.   27     Let Us Praise Him To-day. 8s & 7s.  _The Universal Song._  Praise to thee, thou great Creator!   Praise to thee from ev'ry tongue; Join, my soul, with ev'ry creature,   Join the universal song.  Cho.--Glory to the Father and the Son,       Glory to the Spirit! three in one!       Let us praise him, let us praise him, let us praise him to-day,       And sing his loving kindness on our way.  2 Father! source of all compassion!   Pure, unbounded grace is thine; Hail the Lord of our salvation!   Praise him for his love divine.  3 For ten thousand blessings given,   For the hope of future joy, Sound his praise thro' earth and heaven,   Sound Jehovah's praise on high.  4 Praise to God, our great Creator!   Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; Praise him, ev'ry living creature,   Earth and heav'n's united host.       J. W. Fawcett, 1767.   28     Lyons. 10s & 11s.  _Praise of Divine Love._  O worship the King, all-glorious above, And gratefully sing his wonderful love; Our Shield and Defender, the Ancient of days, Pavilioned in splendor and girdled with praise.  2 Thy bountiful care, what tongue can recite? It breathes in the air, it shines in the light; It streams from the hills, it descends to the plain, And sweetly distills in the dew and the rain.  3 Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail, In thee do we trust, nor find thee to fail; Thy mercies, how tender! how firm to the end, Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend!  4 Our Father and God, how faithful thy love! While angels delight to hymn thee above, The humbler creation, though feeble their lays. With true adoration shall lisp to thy praise.       Sir Robert Grant, 1839.   29     Lyons. 10s & 11s.  _Salvation to God._  Ye servants of God, your Master proclaim, And publish abroad his wonderful name. The name, all-victorious, of Jesus extol; His kingdom is glorious, and rules over all.  2 God ruleth on high, almighty to save; And still he is nigh, his presence we have; The great congregation his triumph shall sing, Ascribing salvation to Jesus our King.  3 \"Salvation to God, who sits on the throne,\" Let all cry aloud, and honor the Son; Our Savior's high praises the angels proclaim,-- Fall down on their faces, and worship the Lamb.       C. Wesley, 1744.   30     Gerar. S.M.  _The Glories of the Sanctuary._     (128)  How charming is the place   Where my Redeemer God Unveils the glories of his face,   And sheds his love abroad!  2 Here, on the mercy seat,   With radiant glory crowned, Our joyful eyes behold him sit,   And smile on all around.  3 To him their prayers and cries,   Each contrite soul presents; And while he hears their humble sighs   He grants them all their wants.  4 Give me, O Lord, a place   Within thy blest abode; Among the children of thy grace,   The servants of my God.       S. Stennett.   31     Hendon. 7s.  _A Blessing Implored._     (134)  Lord! we come before thee now; At thy feet we humbly bow; Oh, do not our suit disdain; Shall we seek thee, Lord, in vain?  2 Send some message from thy word, That may joy and peace afford; Let thy Spirit now impart Full salvation to each heart.  3 Comfort those who weep and mourn; Let the time of joy return; Those that are cast down lift up, Strong in faith, in love, and hope.  4 Grant that those who seek may find Thee, a God sincere and kind; Heal the sick, the captive free, Let us all rejoice in thee.       William Hammond, 1745.   32     Sicily. 8s, 7s, & 4s.  _Opening of Service._     (137)  In thy name, O Lord! assembling,   We, thy people, now draw near; Teach us to rejoice with trembling;   Speak, and let thy servants hear--       Hear with meekness--   Hear thy word with godly fear.  2 While our days on earth are lengthened,   May we give them, Lord, to thee; Cheered by hope, and daily strengthened,   May we run, nor weary be,       Till thy glory   Without clouds in heaven we see.  3 There, in worship, purer, sweeter,   Thee thy people shall adore; Tasting of enjoyment greater   Far than thought conceived before;        Full enjoyment,   Full, unmixed, and evermore.       Thomas Kelly, 1809.   33     Sicily. 8s, 7s, & 4s.  _Close of Service._     (141)  Lord, dismiss us with thy blessing,   Fill our hearts with joy and peace; Let us each, thy love possessing,   Triumph in redeeming grace;        Oh! refresh us,   Traveling through this wilderness.  2 Thanks we give and adoration,   For thy gospel's joyful sound; May the fruits of thy salvation   In our hearts and lives abound;        May thy presence   With us, evermore, be found.  3 So, whene'er the signal's given,   Us from earth to call away, Borne on angel's wings to heaven,   Glad the summons to obey,        We shall surely   Reign with Christ in endless day.       Walter Shirley, 1774.   34     Sicily. 8s, 7s, & 4s.  _Plea for Parting Blessing._     (139)  God of our salvation! hear us;   Bless, oh, bless us, ere we go; When we join the world, be near us,   Lest we cold and careless grow.        Savior! keep us;   Keep us safe from every foe.  2 As our steps are drawing nearer   To our everlasting home, May our view of heaven grow clearer,   Hope more bright of joys to come;        And, when dying,   May thy presence cheer the gloom.       Thomas Kelly, 1809.   35     Mendon. L.M.  _Psalm 84._     (119)  Great God! attend while Zion sings The joy that from thy presence springs; To spend one day with thee on earth Exceeds a thousand days of mirth.  2 Might I enjoy the meanest place Within thy house, O God of grace! Not tents of ease, nor thrones of power, Should tempt my feet to leave thy door.  3 God is our sun, he makes our day; God is our shield, he guards our way From all th' assaults of hell and sin, From foes without and foes within.  4 All needful grace will God bestow, And crown that grace with glory too; He gives us all things, and withholds No real good from upright souls.  5 O God, our King! whose sovereign sway The glorious hosts of heaven obey, And devils at thy presence flee; Blest is the man that trusts in thee!       Isaac Watts, 1719.   36     Mendon L.M.  _The Presence of Christ._     (124)  How sweet to leave the world awhile,   And seek the presence of our Lord! Dear Savior! on thy people smile,   And come, according to thy word.  2 From busy scenes we now retreat,   That we may here converse with thee: Ah! Lord! behold us at thy feet;--   Let this the gate of heaven be.  3 Chief of ten thousand! now appear,   That we by faith may see thy face; Oh! speak, that we thy voice may hear   And let thy presence fill this place.       Thomas Kelly, 1809.   37     Mendon. L.M.  _Psalm 84._     (127)  How pleasant, how divinely fair, O Lord of hosts, thy dwellings are! With long desire my spirit faints, To meet the assemblies of thy saints.  2 My flesh would rest in thine abode; My panting heart cries out for God; My God! my King! why should I be So far from all my joys and thee?  3 Blest are the souls who find a place Within the temple of thy grace; There they behold thy gentler rays, And seek thy face and learn thy praise.  4 Blest are the men whose hearts are set To find the way to Zion's gate; God is their strength, and through the road They lean upon their helper, God.  5 Cheerful they walk with growing strength, Till all shall meet in heaven at length; Till all before thy face appear, And join in nobler worship there.       Isaac Watts, 1719   38     Ward. L.M.  _Before Sermon._     (122)  Thy presence, gracious God! afford: Prepare us to receive thy word; Now let thy voice engage our ear, And faith be mixed with what we hear.  2 Distracting thoughts and cares remove, And fix our hearts and hopes above; With food divine may we be fed And satisfied with living bread.  3 To us thy sacred word apply, With sovereign power and energy; And may we, in thy faith and fear, Reduce to practice what we hear.  4 Father, in us thy Son reveal; Teach us to know and do thy will; Thy saving power and love display. And guide us to the realms of day.       John Fawcett. 1782.   39     Migdol. L.M.  _Acts 2:1._     (792)  Command thy blessing from above   O God, on all assembled here; Behold us with a Father's love,   While we look up with filial fear.  2 Command thy blessing, Jesus, Lord!   May we thy true disciples be; Speak to each heart the mighty word--   Say to the weakest, follow me.  3 Command thy blessing in this hour,   Spirit of truth! and till the place With wounding and with healing power,   With quickening and confirming grace.  4 Oh, thou, our Maker, Savior, Guide,   One true, eternal God confessed; Whom thou hast joined none may divide,   None dare to curse whom thou hast blest.       James Montgomery   40     Mear. C.M.  _God's Presence in Sanctuary_.     (111)  Again our earthly cares we leave,   And in thy courts appear; Again, with joyful feet, we come   To meet our Savior"]]]
