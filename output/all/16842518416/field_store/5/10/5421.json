Tex was not one of these diabolically cunning villains. He did not consider himself any kind of a villain. He accepted himself more or less contentedly as a poor, striving young man who wanted to get ahead in the world and was eager to pick up what he called \"side money,\" which might, if he were on to his job, amount to more than his wages. Tex did not consider that he owed the Rolling R anything whatever save a certain number of days' work in each month that he drew a pay check. He sold Sudden his time and his skill in the saddle--a month of it for fifty dollars. But if he could double that fifty without harm to himself, Tex was not going to split any hairs over the method.  Tex was not displaying any great genius when he edged the boys on to tease Johnny beyond the limit of that young man's endurance, or when he tattled to Mary V a slighting remark about her ability as a poet. Tex was merely carrying out an idea which had come to him when he saw Johnny with his hands full of aircraft literature. If it worked, all right. If it didn't work, Johnny would not be on the Rolling R pay roll any longer, but Tex would not have lost anything. It would be convenient to have Johnny down at Sinkhole Camp, shirking his job while he fiddled around with his flying bug. Tex believed he knew how he could keep the bug very active, and Johnny very much engrossed with it--down at Sinkhole Camp. It was simple enough, and worth the slight effort Tex was making.  So there was Johnny Jewel with his saddle and bridle and suitcase and chaps, waiting out by the mail box for the stage. And there came Sudden, driving back from the railroad--Tex knew he was expected back that forenoon--and reaching the gate before the stage had come in sight around the southwest spur of the ridge it could not cross. Sudden liked Johnny--and Tex knew that too. (Tex made it his business to know a good deal which had nothing to do with his legitimate work.) And good riders who did not get drunk every chance that offered were not to be hired every day in the week.  Johnny opened the gate, but Sudden did not drive through. He stopped and eyed the suitcase and the saddle and the chaps, and then he looked at Johnny.  \"Too much song-bird stuff?\" he asked, which showed how sensitive was the finger Sudden kept on the pulse of his outfit.  \"I've got to work for a living, but I don't have to work with that bunch of idiots,\" Johnny stated with much dignity.  Sudden rubbed a gauntleted hand across the lower part of his face; and that, I think, is why Johnny saw himself taken as seriously as his young egotism demanded.  \"Rather be by yourself, would you? Well, throw your baggage in the back of the car. I want you to catch up a couple of horses and go on down to Sinkhole. You won't be annoyed down there with anybody's foolishness but your own, young man. You'll work for your living, all right! Got a gun? A rifle? Well, there's one at the house you can take. There may not be any Rolling R horses going across the line--but it'll be your business to _know_ there aren't. If you see a greaser prowling around, put him on the run. They're paying good money for horses in Mexico, remember. You're down there to see they don't get 'em too cheap on this side. Do you get that?\"  \"Yes, sir--you bet!\"  \"Oh. You do? Well, get in.\"  At the corral he turned again to Johnny. \"Stop at the house when you're ready. There's a pile of _Modern Mechanics_ you may as well take along. You won't have any too much time for reading, though--not if you work the way you rhyme.\"  \"Well, I hope I work better,\" said Johnny, his spirits risen to where speech bubbled. \"I get paid for my work--and I guess I'd starve writing poetry for a living.\"  \"Yes, I guess you would. Good thing you know it.\" Sudden swung his machine around and drove into the garage, and Johnny, untying his rope from his saddle, went into the corral to catch two fairly gentle horses.  When he was ready he rode over to the bungalow, leading the gentlest horse packed with bedding roll, \"war bag,\" and a few odds and ends that Johnny wanted to take along. Sudden was waiting on the porch with a rifle, cartridge belt and two extra boxes of ammunition, and a sack half full of magazines. He stood with his hands in his pockets while Johnny tied rifle and sack on the saddle.  \"Now I want you to understand, Johnny, that you're going down there on special work,\" he said, coming down the steps and standing close to the horse. \"There's a telephone, and that's your protection if anything looks off-color. Keep the stock pushed back pretty well away from the line fences. There's some good feed in those draws over east of Sinkhole creek. Let 'em graze in there--but keep an eye out for rustlers. Get to know the bunches of horses and watch their moves. You'll soon know whether they are being bothered. Pete leaves camp this afternoon. You'll probably meet him.  \"And this gun--well, you keep it right with you. I don't want you to go around hunting trouble, but I want you to be ready for it if it comes. A horse looks awfully good to a greaser, remember. But no greaser likes the looks of a white man with a gun. Now let's see how much brains you've got for the job, young man. If you see to it that no Rolling R stuff comes up missing, and do it without any trouble, I'll call that making good.\"  \"All right, I'll try and make good, then.\" Johnny's shoulders went back. \"When a man's got some object in life besides just earning a living, he--\"  From within the house full-toned chords were struck from a piano. Johnny scowled, gave his packed horse a yank, and rode off. Couldn't that girl ever let up on a fellow? Playing that darn fool tune over and over! It sure showed how much brains she had in her head! He hoped she'd get enough of it. If he was her mother or her father, he knew what he'd do with her and the whole outfit. He'd stand 'em all up in a row and make 'em sing that fool song till they were hoarse as calves on the fifth day of weaning. There was a time, too, when he had liked that girl. If she had shown any brains or feeling, he could have loved Mary V. Good thing he found out in time.  Johnny looked back from the gate and heaved a great sigh of relief at his narrow escape. Or was it regret? Johnny himself did not know, but he called it relief because that was the most comfortable emotion a young man may take away with him into desert loneliness.  Yes, sir, he was glad of the chance to stay at Sinkhole for awhile. He wouldn't be pestered to death, and he would have plenty of time to study and read. He'd send for that correspondence course on aviation, and he'd get the theory of it all down pat, so that when he had enough money saved up to go into the thing right, all he would need would be the actual practice in the air. He should think he could go to some school and work his way along; get a little practice every day, and do repair work or something the rest of the time for nothing. A dollar a minute for learning was pretty steep, Johnny thought, but after all it was worth it. A dollar a minute--and four hundred minutes in the air for the average course!  Four hundred dollars, and only half that much saved. And then there would be his fare back east, and his board--Johnny wished that he might cut out eating, but he realized how healthy was his appetite. He counted three meals for every day, at an average of fifty cents for each meal. Well, even so, he could \"ride the bumpers\" to the school; take a side-door pullman; beat his way; hobo it--or whatever the initiated wanted to call it. He could send his suitcase on by express, and just wear old clothes--send his money on, too, for that matter. He could save quite a lot that way. Or maybe he could get Sudden to let him go back with cattle from the Gila River Ranch--only he wouldn't ask any favors from any one by the name of Selmer. No, he'd be darned if he would! He'd just draw his wages, when he had enough saved, and drop out of sight. He wouldn't even tell Curley where he was going. And then, some day--  There came the air castle again, floating alluringly before his eager imagination, like a mirage lake in the desert. Johnny's eyes stared ahead through the shimmering heat waves--stared and saw not the monotonous neutral tints of sand and rock and gray sage and yellow weeds and the rutted, dusty trail that wound away across the desert. But Mary V's face turned expectantly toward him from the crowd as he walked nonchalantly around his big tractor, testing every cable, inspecting the landing gear and the elevators and the--what-ye-may-call-'ems--and then climbing in and trying out his control--and pulling down his goggles and settling his moleskin cap and all--and then nodding imperiously to his helper--not little Curley; he was not big enough to crank his powerful motor--but some big guy that had a reach like--  And then the buzz and the hum, and fellows braced against the wings to hold 'er till he was ready to give the word! And the dust storm he kicked up behind--he hoped Mary V got her eyes full, darn her!--and then, getting the feel of 'er, and giving a nod to the fellows to let go the wings! And then--  Johnny rode along in a trance. He, his conscious inward self, was not riding a sweating bronk along a trail that wound more-or-less southward across the desert. That was his body, chained by grim necessity to work for a wage. He, Johnny Jewel's ego, was soaring up and up and up--up till the eagles themselves gazed enviously after. He was darting in and out among the convolutions of fluffy white clouds; was looping earthward in great, invisible volutes; catching himself on the upward curve and zigzagging away again, swimming ecstatically the high, clean air currents which the poor, crawling, earthbound ones never know.  Johnny jarred back to earth and to the sordid realities of life. He had ridden half way to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16871"],["title","Skyrider (#5)"],["body","without knowing it, and now his horse had stopped, facing another horse whose rider was staring curiously at Johnny. This was Pete, on his way in from Sinkhole.  \"Say-y! Yuh snake-bit, or what?\" Pete asked. \"Ridin' glassy-eyed right _at_ a feller! If my hawse had been a mite shorter, I expect you'd of rode right on over me and never of saw me. What's bitin' yuh, Johnny?\"  \"Me? Nothing!\" No daydreamer likes being pulled out of his dream by so ugly a reality as Pete, and Johnny was petulant. \"Why didn't you get outa the way, then? You saw me coming, didn't you?\"  \"Me? Sure! I ain't _loco_. I seen yuh five mile back, about. I knowed it was somebody from the ranch. Sudden 'phoned in and said I could drag it. And you can bet yore sweet young life I hailed them words with joy! What yuh done to 'im that he's sendin' yuh off down to Sinkhole? Me, I 'phoned in and much as told 'em he'd have to double my pay if he wanted me to stay down there any longer. That was a coupla days ago. Didn't git no satisfaction atall till to-day. Me, I'd ruther go to jail, twicet over, than stay here a week longer. Ain't saw a soul in two weeks down there. Well, I'll be pushin' along. Adios--and here's hopin' you like it better than what I done.\"  Johnny told him good-bye and straightway forgot him. Once he had his two horses \"lined out\" in their shuffling little trail-trot that was their natural gait, he picked up his dream where he had been interrupted. Where his body went mattered little to Johnny Jewel, so long as he was left alone with his thoughts. So presently his eyes were once more staring vacantly at the dim trail, while in spirit he was soaring high and swooping downward with the ease of a desert lark, while thousands thrilled to watch his flight.  What did he care about Sinkhole Camp? Loneliness meant long, uninterrupted hours in which to ride and read and dream of the great things he meant some day to do.     CHAPTER FOUR  A THING THAT SETS LIKE A HAWK   Six days are not many when they are lived with companions and the numberless details of one's everyday occupation. They may seem a month if you pass them in jail, or in waiting for some great event,--or at Sinkhole Camp, down near the Border.  Three days of the six Johnny spent in familiarizing himself with the two or three detached horse herds that watered along the meager little stream that sunk finally under a ledge and was seen no more in Arizona. He counted the horses as best he could while they loitered at their watering places, and he noticed where they fed habitually--also that they ranged far and usually came in to water in the late afternoon or closer to dusk, when the yellow-jackets that swarmed along the muddy banks of the stream did not worry them so much, nor the flies that were a torment.  He reported by telephone to his employer, who seemed relieved to know that everything was so quiet and untroubled down at that end of his range. And once, quite inadvertently, he reported to Mary V; or was going to, when he recognized a feminine note in the masculine gruffness that spoke over the wire. And when she found he had discovered her:  \"Oh, Johnny! I've thought of another verse!\" she began animatedly.  Johnny hung up, and although the telephone rang twice after that he would not answer. It seemed to him that Mary V had very little to do, harping away still at that subject. He had been secretly a bit homesick for the ranch, but now he thanked heaven, emphatically enough to make up for any lack of sincerity, that he was where he was.  He got out his aviation circulars again and went over them one by one, though he could almost repeat them with his eyes' shut. He tried to dream of future greatness, but instead he could only feel depressed and hopeless. It would take a long, long time to save enough money to learn the game. And the earning was dreary work at best. The little adobe cabin became straightway a squalid prison, the monotonous waste around him a void that spread like a great, impassable gulf between himself and the dreams he dreamed. He wished, fervently and profanely, that the greasers would try to steal some horses, so that he could be doing something.  People thought the Border was a tumultuous belt of violence drawn from Coast to Gulf, he meditated morosely. They ought to camp at Sinkhole for awhile. Why, he could ride in an hour or two to Mexico--and see nothing more than he could see from the door of his cabin. He wished he could see something. A fight--anything that had action in it. But the revolution, boiling intermittently over there, did not so much as float a wisp of steam in his direction.  He wished that he had not \"hung up\" on Mary V before he had told her a few things. He couldn't see why she didn't leave him alone. The Lord knew he was willing to leave _her_ alone.  A few days more of that he had before he saw a living soul. Then a Mexican youth came wandering in on a scrawny pony that seemed to have its heart set on drinking the creek dry, before his rider could drink it all. Johnny watched the boy lie down on the flat of his lean stomach with his face to the sluggish stream, and drink as if he, too, were trying to cheat the pony. Together they lifted their heads and looked at Johnny. The Mexican boy smiled, white-toothed, while deep pools of eyes regarded Johnny soberly.  \"She's damn hot to-day, señor,\" he said. \"Thank you for the so good water to drink.\"  \"That's all right. Help yourself,\" Johnny said languidly. \"Had your dinner?\"  \"Not this day. I'm come from Tucker Bly, his rancho. I ride to see if horses feed quiet.\"  \"Well, come in and eat. I cooked some peaches this morning.\"  The youth went eagerly, his somewhat stilted English easing off into a mixture of good American slang and the Mexican dialect spoken by peons and some a grade higher up the ladder. He was not more than seventeen, and while Johnny recalled his instructions to put any greaser on the run, he took the liberty of interpreting those instructions to please himself. This kid was harmless enough. He talked the range gossip that proved to Johnny's satisfaction that he was what he professed to be--a young rider for Tucker Bly, who owned the \"Forty-Seven\" brand that ranged just east of the Rolling R. Johnny had never seen this Tomaso--plain Tom, he called him presently--but he knew Tucker Bly; and a few leading questions served to set at rest any incipient suspicions Johnny may have had.  They were doing the same work, he and Tomaso. The only difference was that Johnny camped alone, and Tomaso rode out from the Forty-Seven ranch every day, taking whatever direction Tucker Bly might choose for him. But the freemasonry of the range land held Johnny to the feeling that there was a common bond between them, in spite of Tomaso's swarthy skin. Besides, he was lonely. His tongue loosened while Tomaso ate and praised Johnny's cookery with the innate flattery of his race.  \"Wha's that pic'shur? What you call that thing?\" Tomaso pointed a slender, brown finger at a circular heading, whereon a pink aeroplane did a \"nose dive\" toward the date line through voluted blue clouds.  \"That? Say! Didn't you ever see a flying machine?\" Johnny stared at him pityingly.  Tomaso shook his head vaguely. \"Me, I'm never saw one of them things. My brother, he's tell me. He knows the spot where there's one fell down. My brother, he says she's awful bad luck, them thing. This-a one, she's fell 'cross the line. She's set there like a big hawk, my brother says. Nobody wants. She's bad luck.\"  \"Bad luck nothing.\" Johnny's eyes had widened a bit. \"What you mean, one fell across the line? You don't mean--say what 'n thunder _do_ yuh mean? Where's there a flying machine setting like a hawk?\"  Tomaso waved a brown hand comprehensively from east to west. \"Somewhere--me, I dunno. My brother, he's know. He's saw it set there. It's what them soldiers got lost. It's bad luck. Them soldiers most dead when somebody find. They don't know where that thing is no more. They don't want it no more. My brother, she's tol' me them soldiers flew like birds and then they fell down. It's bad luck. My brother took one hammer from that thing, and one pliers. Them hammer, she's take a nail off my brother's thumb. And them pliers, she's lost right away.\"  Johnny's hand trembled when he tried to shake a little tobacco into a cigarette paper. His lips, too, quivered slightly. But he laughed unbelievingly.  \"Your brother was kidding you, Tom. Nobody would go off and leave an airplane setting in the desert. Those soldiers that got lost were away over east of here. Three or four hundred miles. He was kidding you.\"  \"No-o, my brother, she's saw that thing! She's hunt cattle what got across, and she's saw that what them soldiers flew. Me, I _know_.\" He looked at Johnny appraisingly, hesitated and leaned forward, impelled yet not quite daring to give the proof.  \"Well, what do you know?\" Johnny returned the look steadfastly.  \"You don't tell my brother--I--\" He fumbled in his trousers pocket, hesitated a little longer, and grew more trustful. \"Them pliers--I'm got.\"  He laid them on the table, and Johnny let his stool tilt forward abruptly on its four legs. He took up the pliers, examined them with one eye squinted against the smoke of his cigarette, weighed them in his hand, bent to read the trade-mark. Then he looked at Tomaso. Those pliers may or may not have come from the emergency kit of an airplane, but they certainly were not of the kind or quality that ranchmen were in the habit of owning. To Johnny they looked convincing. When he had an airplane of his own, he would find a hundred uses for a pair of pliers exactly like those.  \"I thought you said your brother lost 'em,\" he observed drily.  Tomaso shrugged, flung out his hands, smiled with his lips, and frowned with his eyes. \"S'pose he did lost. Somebody could find.\"  Johnny laughed. \"All right; we'll let it ride that way. I ain't going to tell your brother. Want to sell 'em?\" "]]]
