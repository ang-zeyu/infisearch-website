The men of the battery were sitting round their guns, singing a somewhat lengthy ditty, each verse ending with a declamation and a description of the beauty of \"la belle Suzanne.\" I asked them to whom Suzanne belonged and where the fair damsel resided. \"Oh,\" they replied, \"we have no time to think of damsels called 'Suzanne' now. This is our Suzanne,\" and the speaker affectionately gave an extra rub with his coat-sleeve to the barrel of the \"'75.\"  By a wonderful system of trench work it is possible for the gunners, in case of necessity, to take refuge in the champagne-vaults in the surrounding district, and it is in the champagne-vaults that the children go daily to school, with their little gas-masks hanging in bags on their arms. It appears that at first the tiny ones were frightened of the masks, but they soon asked to be also given a sack, like their elders, and now one and all have learnt at the least alarm to put on their masks. There is no need to tell the children to hurry home. They realise that it is not wise to loiter in the streets for fear of the whistling shells. They are remarkably plucky, these small men and women of France.  During one furious bombardment the children were safe in the vaults, but one small citizen began to cry bitterly. He was reproached by his comrades for cowardice, but he replied indignantly: \"I fear nothing for myself--I am safe here; but there is no cellar to our house, and oh! what will happen to the little mother?\" The teacher reassured him by telling him that his mother would certainly take refuge in somebody else's cellar.  On leaving Rheims we passed through various small hamlets where the houses had been entirely destroyed, and which now had the appearance of native villages, as the soldiers had managed to place thatched roofs on any building which had a semblance of walls standing.  At Villars Côterets the Garde Champêtre sounded the \"Gare à Vous!\" Four Taubes were passing overhead, so we took refuge in the hotel for tea. The enemy did no damage in that particular village, but in the next village of Crêpy-en-Valois a bomb killed one child and injured five women.  At his headquarters next morning I had the honour of being received by the Generalissimo Joffre, and telling him of the admiration and respect which we felt for him and for the magnificent fighting spirit of the troops under his able command. He replied modestly by speaking of the British Army. He referred to the offensive on the Somme, and said, \"You may well be proud of your young soldiers--they are excellent soldiers, much superior to the Germans in every way, a most admirable infantry; they attack the Germans hand to hand with grenades or with the bayonet, and push them back everywhere; the Germans have been absolutely _stupefied_ to find such troops before them.\" The General then paid a tribute to the Canadian and Australian troops, and told me that that day the Australians had taken new territory, adding, \"And not only have they taken it, but like their British and Canadian brothers, what they take they will hold.\"  I explained to General Joffre that, whilst I was not collecting autographs, I had with me the menu of the dinner in the citadel at Verdun, and that it would give me great pleasure to have his name added to the signatures already on that menu. All the signatures were on one side, so I turned the menu over in order to offer him a clear space, but he turned it back again, saying: \"Please let me sign on this side; I find myself in good company with the defenders of Verdun.\"  At departing he said to me: \"We may all be happy now, since certainly we are on the right side of the hill\" (\"Nous sommes sur la bonne pente\").  In case this little story should fall into the hands of any woman who has spent her time working for the men at the front, I would like to tell her the great pleasure it is to them to receive parcels, no matter what they contain. Fraternity and Equality reign supreme in the trenches, and the man counts himself happy who receives a little more than the others, since he has the joy and the pleasure of sharing his store of good things with his comrades. There is seldom a request made to the French behind the lines that they do not attempt to fulfil. I remember last winter, passing through a town in the provinces, I noticed that the elderly men appeared to be scantily clad in spite of the bitterness of the weather. It appeared that the call had gone forth for fur coats for the troops, and all the worthy citizens of the town forwarded to the trenches their caracul coats. Only those who are well acquainted with French provincial life can know what it means to them to part with these signs of opulence and commercial success.  It is perhaps in the post-offices that you find yourself nearest to the heart of \"France behind the lines.\"  One morning I endeavoured to send a parcel to a French soldier; I took my place in a long line of waiting women bound on the same errand. A white-haired woman before me gave the post-office clerk infinite trouble. They are not renowned for their patience, and I marvelled at his gentleness, until he explained: \"Her son died five weeks ago, but she still continues to send him parcels.\"  To another old lady he pointed out that she had written two numbers on the parcel. \"You don't want two numbers, mother. Which is your boy's number?--tell me, and I will strike out the other.\"  \"Leave them both,\" she answered. \"Who knows whether my dear lad will be there to receive the parcel? If he is not, I want it to go to some other mother's son.\"  Affection means much to these men who are suffering, and they respond at once to any sympathy shown to them. One man informed us with pride that when he left his native village he was \"decked like an altar of the Blessed Virgin on the first of May.\" In other words, covered with flowers.  There are but few lonely soldiers now, since those who have no families to write to them receive letters and parcels from the godmothers who have adopted them. The men anxiously await the news of their adopted relatives, and spend hours writing replies. They love to receive letters, but needless to say a parcel is even more welcome.  I remember seeing one man writing page after page. I suggested to him that he must have a particularly charming godmother. \"Mademoiselle,\" he replied, \"I have no time for a godmother since I myself am a godfather.\" He then explained that far away in his village there was a young assistant in his shop, \"And God knows the boy loves France, but both his lungs are touched, so they won't take him, but I write and tell him that the good God has given me strength for two, that I fight for him and for myself, and that we are both doing well for France.\" I went back in imagination to the village, I could see the glint in the boy's eyes, realised how the blood pulsed quicker through his veins at the sight of, not the personal pronoun \"I\" in the singular, but the plural \"We are doing well for France\": for one glorious moment he was part of the hosts of France and in spirit serving his Motherland. It is that spirit of the French nation that their enemies will never understand.  On one occasion a young German officer, covered with mud from head to foot, was brought before one of the French Generals. He had been taken fighting cleanly, and the General was anxious to show him kindness. He asked him if he would not prefer to cleanse himself before examination. The young German drew himself up and replied: \"Look at me, General; I am covered from head to foot with mud, and that mud is the soil of France. You will never possess as much soil in Germany.\" The General turned to him with that gentle courtesy which marks the higher commands in France, and answered: \"Monsieur, we may never possess as much soil in Germany; but there is something that you will never possess, and, until you conquer it, you cannot vanquish France, and that is the spirit of the French people.\"  The French find it difficult to understand the arrogance which appears ingrained in the German character, and which existed before the war.  I read once that in the Guest-book of a French hotel a Teutonic visitor wrote:  \"L'Allemagne est la première nation du monde.\"  The next French visitor merely added:  \"Yes, 'Allemagne' is the first country of the world--if we take them in alphabetical order.\"         *       *       *       *       *  I left the war-zone with an increased respect, if this were possible, for the men of France. They have altered their uniforms, but the spirit is unchanged. They are no longer in the red and blue of the old days, but in shades of green, grey, and blue, colours blending to form one mighty ocean--wave on wave of patriotism--beating against and wearing down the rocks of military preparedness of forty years, and as no man has yet been able to say to the ocean \"Stop,\" so no man shall cry \"Halt\" to the armies of France.  I have spoken much of the men of France, but the women have also earned our respect--those splendid peasant-women who even in times of peace worked and now carry a double burden on their shoulders; the middle-class women, endeavouring to keep together the little business built up by the man with years of toil, stinting themselves to save five francs to send a parcel to the man at the front that he may not suspect that there is not still every comfort in the little homestead; the noble women of France, who in past years could not be seen before noon, since my lady was at her toilette, but who can be seen now, their hands scratched and bleeding, kneeling on the floors of the hospitals scrubbing, proud and happy to take their part in national service. The men owe much of their courage to the attitude of the women who stand behind them, turning their tears to smiles to urge their men to even greater deeds of heroism.  In one of our hospitals was a young lad of seventeen, who"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16949"],["title","Flowers from a Persian Garden and Other Papers (#0)"],["body","\"The smiling Garden of Persian Literature\": a Garden which I     would describe, in the Eastern style, as a happy spot, where     lavish Nature with profusion strews the most fragrant and     blooming flowers, where the most delicious fruits abound, which     is ever vocal with the plaintive melancholy of the nightingale,     who, during day and night, \"tunes her love-laboured song\": ...     where the voice of Wisdom is often heard uttering her moral     sentence, or delivering the dictates of experience.--SIR W.

CLOUSTON,   AUTHOR OF 'POPULAR TALES AND FICTIONS' AND 'BOOK OF NOODLES'; EDITOR OF 'A GROUP OF EASTERN ROMANCES AND STORIES,' 'BOOK OF SINDIBAD,' 'BAKHTYAR NAMA,' 'ARABIAN POETRY FOR ENGLISH READERS,' ETC.   LONDON: DAVID NUTT, 270, 271, STRAND. MDCCCXC.     TO E. SIDNEY HARTLAND, ESQ.,  FELLOW OF THE SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES; MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL OF THE FOLK-LORE SOCIETY, ETC.   MY DEAR HARTLAND,  Though you are burdened with the duties of a profession far outside of which lie those studies that have largely occupied my attention for many years past, yet your own able contributions to the same, or cognate, subjects of investigation evince the truth of the seemingly paradoxical saying, that \"the busiest man finds the greatest amount of leisure.\" And in dedicating this little book to you--would that it were more worthy!--as a token of gratitude for the valuable help you have often rendered me in the course of my studies, I am glad of the opportunity it affords me for placing on record (so to say) the fact that I enjoy the friendship of a man possessed of so many excellent qualities of heart as well as of intellect.  The following collection of essays, or papers, is designed to suit the tastes of a more numerous class of readers than were some of my former books, which are not likely to be of special interest to many besides students of comparative folk-lore--amongst whom your own degree is high. The book, in fact, is intended mainly for those who are rather vaguely termed \"general readers\"; albeit I venture to think that even the folk-lore student may find in it somewhat to \"make a note of,\" as the great Captain Cuttle was wont to say--in season and out of season.  Leaving the contents to speak for themselves, I shall only say farther that my object has been to bring together, in a handy volume, a series of essays which might prove acceptable to many readers, whether of grave or lively temperament. What are called \"instructive\" books--meaning thereby \"morally\" instructive--are generally as dull reading as is proverbially a book containing nothing but jests--good, bad, and indifferent. We can't (and we shouldn't) be always in the \"serious\" mood, nor can we be for ever on the grin; and it seems to me that a mental dietary, by turns, of what is wise and of what is witty should be most wholesome. But, of the two, I confess I prefer to take the former, even as one ought to take solid food, in great moderation; and, after all, it is surely better to laugh than to mope or weep, in spite of what has been said of \"the loud laugh that speaks the vacant mind.\" Most of us, in this work-a-day world, find no small benefit from allowing our minds to lie fallow at certain times, as farmers do with their fields. In the following pages, however, I believe wisdom and wit, the didactic and the diverting, will be found in tolerably fair proportions.  But I had forgot--I am not writing a Preface, and this is already too long for a Dedication; so believe me, with all good wishes,  Yours ever faithfully, W. A. CLOUSTON. GLASGOW, February, 1890.

It is remarkable how very little the average general reader knows regarding the great Persian poet Saádí and his writings. His name is perhaps more or less familiar to casual readers from its being appended to one or two of his aphorisms which are sometimes reproduced in odd corners of popular periodicals; but who he was, when he lived, and what he wrote, are questions which would probably puzzle not a few, even of those who consider themselves as \"well read,\" to answer without first recurring to some encyclopædia. Yet Saádí was assuredly one of the most gifted men of genius the world has ever known: a man of large and comprehensive intellect; an original and profound thinker; an acute observer of men and manners; and his works remain the imperishable monument of his genius, learning, and industry.  Maslahu 'd-Dín Shaykh Saádí was born, towards the close of the twelfth century, at Shíráz, the famous capital of Fars, concerning which city the Persians have the saying that \"if Muhammed had tasted the pleasures of Shíráz, he would have begged Allah to make him immortal there.\" In accordance with the usual practice in Persia, he assumed as his _takhallus_, or poetical name,[1] Saádí, from his patron Atabag Saád bin Zingí, sovereign of"]]]
