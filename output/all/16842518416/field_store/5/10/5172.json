The ex-artilleryman kept a little music shop in a street near the Elephant and Castle. There were      a few fiddles in the window, and some Pan's pipes and     a tambourine, and a triangle, and certain elongated     scraps of music.  It was to this shop that Bucket the detective came under the pretence of wanting a second-hand 'wiolinceller' (see p. 29). In the course of conversation it turns out that Master Bagnet (otherwise 'Woolwich') 'plays the fife beautiful,' and he performs some popular airs for the benefit of his audience. Mr. Bucket also claims to have played the fife himself when a boy, 'not in a scientific way, but by ear.'   _Bagpipes_  Two references to the bagpipes deserve notice. One is in _David Copperfield_, where the novelist refers to his own early experiences as a shorthand reporter. He has no high opinion of the speeches he used to take down.      One joyful night, therefore, I noted down the music     of the parliamentary bagpipes for the last time, and     I have never heard it since; though I still recognize     the old drone in the newspapers.  In _O.M.F._ (II.) we read of Charley Hexam's fellow pupils keeping themselves awake      by maintaining a monotonous droning noise, as if they     were performing, out of time and tune, on a ruder sort     of bagpipe.  The peculiar subdued noise caused by a lot of children in a school is certainly suggestive of the instrument.   _Trombone_  Little is said about the trombone. We are told, in reference to the party at Dr. Strong's (_D.C._), that the good Doctor knew as much about playing cards as he did about 'playing the trombone.' In 'Our School' (_R.P._) we are told a good deal about the usher who 'made out the bills, mended the pens, and did all sorts of things.'      He was rather musical, and on some remote quarter-day     had bought an old trombone; but a bit of it was lost,     and it made the most extraordinary sounds when he     sometimes tried to play it of an evening.  In a similarly dismembered state was the flute which Dickens once saw in a broker's shop. It was 'complete with the exception of the middle joint.'  This naturally calls to mind the story of the choir librarian who was putting away the vocal parts of a certain funeral anthem. After searching in vain for two missing numbers he was obliged to label the parcel      'His body is buried in peace.' Two parts missing.   _Organ_  The references to the organ are both numerous and interesting, and it is pretty evident that this instrument had a great attraction for Dickens. The gentle Tom Pinch (_M.C._), whom Gissing calls 'a gentleman who derives his patent of gentility direct from God Almighty,' first claims our attention. He used to play the organ at the village church 'for nothing.' It was a simple instrument, 'the sweetest little organ you ever heard,' provided with wind by the action of the musician's feet, and thus Tom was independent of a blower, though he was so beloved that      there was not a man or boy in all the village and     away to the turnpike (tollman included) but would have     blown away for him till he was black in the face.  What a delight it must have been to him to avail himself of the opportunity to play the organ in the cathedral when he went to meet Martin!      As the grand tones resounded through the church they     seemed, to Tom, to find an echo in the depth of every     ancient tomb, no less than in the deep mystery of his     own heart.  And he would have gone on playing till midnight 'but for a very earthy verger,' who insisted on locking up the cathedral and turning him out.  On one occasion, while he was practising at the church, the miserable Pecksniff entered the building and, hiding behind a pew, heard the conversation between Tom and Mary that led to the former being dismissed from the architect's office, so he had to leave his beloved organ, and mightily did the poor fellow miss it when he went to London! Being an early riser, he had been accustomed to practise every morning, and now he was reduced to taking long walks about London, a poor substitute indeed!  Nor was the organ the only instrument that he could play, for we read how he would spend half his nights poring over the 'jingling anatomy of that inscrutable old harpsichord in the back parlour,' and amongst the household treasures that he took to London were his music and an old fiddle.  The picture which forms our frontispiece shows Tom Pinch playing his favourite instrument. At the sale of the original drawings executed by 'Phiz' for _Martin Chuzzlewit_ this frontispiece, which is an epitome of the salient characters and scenes in the novel, was sold for £35.  We read in _Christmas Stories_ that      Silas Jorgan     Played the organ,  but we are not told the name of the artist who at the concert at the Eagle (_S.B.C._ 4) accompanied a comic song on the organ--and such an organ!      Miss J'mima Ivins's friend's young man whispered it     had cost 'four hundred pound,' which Mr. Samuel Wilkins     said was 'not dear neither.'  The singer was probably either Howell or Glindon. Dickens appears to have visited the Eagle Tavern in 1835 or 1836. It was then a notable place of entertainment consisting of gardens with an orchestra, and the 'Grecian Saloon,' which was furnished with an organ and a 'self-acting piano.' Here concerts were given every evening, which in Lent took a sacred turn, and consisted of selections from Handel and Mozart. In 1837 the organ was removed, and a new one erected by Parsons.  The Eagle gained a wide reputation through its being introduced into a once popular song.      Up and down the City Road,       In and out the Eagle,     That's the way the money goes,       Pop goes the weasel.  This verse was subsequently modified (for nursery purposes) thus:      Half a pound of tuppenny rice,       Half a pound of treacle,     That's the way the money goes,[9]       Pop goes the weasel.  Many explanations have been given of 'weasel.' Some say it was a purse made of weasel skin; others that it was a tailor's flat-iron which used to be pawned (or 'popped') to procure the needful for admission to the tavern. A third (and more intelligible) suggestion is that the line is simply a catch phrase, without any meaning.  There is a notable reference to the organ in _Little Dorrit_. Arthur Clennam goes to call on old Frederick Dorrit, the clarionet player, and is directed to the house where he lived. 'There were so many lodgers in this house that the door-post seemed to be as full of bell handles as a cathedral organ is of stops,' and Clennam hesitates for a time, 'doubtful which might be the clarionet stop.'  Further on in the same novel we are told that it was the organ that Mrs. Finching was desirous of learning.      I have said ever since I began to recover the blow of     Mr. F's death that I would learn the organ of which     I am extremely fond but of which I am ashamed to say     I do not yet know a note.  The following fine description of the tones of an organ occurs in _The Chimes_:      The organ sounded faintly in the church below. Swelling     by degrees the melody ascended to the roof, and filled     the choir and nave. Expanding more and more, it rose     up, up; up, up; higher, higher, higher up; awakening     agitated hearts within the burly piles of oak, the     hollow bells, the iron-bound doors, the stairs of     solid stone; until the tower walls were insufficient     to contain it, and it soared into the sky.  The effect of this on Trotty Veck was very different from that which another organ had on the benevolent old lady we read of in _Our Parish_. She subscribed £20 towards a new instrument for the parish church, and was so overcome when she first heard it that she had to be carried out by the pew-opener.  There are various references to the organs in the City churches, and probably the description of one of them given in _Dombey and Son_ would suit most instruments of the period.      The organ rumbled and rolled as if it had got the     colic, for want of a congregation to keep the wind     and damp out.   _Barrel-Organ_  In real life the barrel-organ was a frequent source of annoyance to Dickens, who found its ceaseless strains very trying when he was busy writing, and who had as much trouble in evicting the grinders as David Copperfield's aunt had with the donkeys.  However, he takes a very mild revenge on this deservedly maligned instrument in his works, and the references are, as usual, of a humorous character. A barrel-organ formed a part of the procession to celebrate the election of Mr. Tulrumble[10] as Mayor of Mudfog, but the player put on the wrong stop, and played one tune while the band played another.  This instrument had an extraordinary effect on Major Tpschoffki, familiarly and more easily known as 'Chops,' the dwarf, 'spirited but not proud,' who was desirous of 'Going into Society' (_G.S._), and who had got it into his head that he was entitled to property:      His ideas respectin' his property never come upon him so     strong as when he sat upon a barrel-organ, and had the     handle turned. Arter the wibration had run through him     a little time he would screech out, 'Toby, I feel my     property coming--grind away! I'm counting my guineas     by thousands, Toby--grind away! Toby, I shall be a     man of fortun! I feel the Mint a-jingling in me, Toby,     and I'm swelling out into the Bank of England.' Such     is the influence of music on a poetic mind.  Dickens found the streets in New York very different from those in London, and specially remarks how quiet they were--no itinerant musicians or showmen of any kind. He could only remember hearing one barrel-organ with a dancing-monkey. '"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16595"],["title","Charles Dickens and Music (#7)"],["body","that, nothing lively, no, not so much as a white mouse in a twirling cage.'  We must not forget that he has two references to pipe organs in his _American Notes_. When he visited the Blind School at Boston he heard a voluntary played on the organ by one of the pupils, while at St. Louis he was informed that the Jesuit College was to be supplied with an organ sent from Belgium.  The barrel-organ brings to mind Jerry and his troupe of dancing-dogs (_O.C.S._), especially the unfortunate animal who had lost a halfpenny during the day, and consequently had to go without his supper. In fact, his master made the punishment fit the crime; for, having set the stop, he made the dog play the organ while the rest had their evening meal.      When the knives and forks rattled very much, or any     of his fellows got an unusually large piece of fat,     he accompanied the music with a short howl; but he     immediately checked it on his master looking round     and applied himself with increased diligence to the     Old Hundredth.  In _Dombey and Son_ there is a very apt comparison of Mr. Feeder, B.A., to this instrument. He was Doctor Blimber's assistant master, and was entrusted with the education of little Paul.      Mr. Feeder, B.A. ... was a kind of human barrel-organ     with a little list of tunes at which he was continually     working, over and over again, without any variation. He     might have been fitted up with a change of barrels,     perhaps, in early life, if his destiny had been     favourable, but it had not been.  So he had only one barrel, his sole occupation being to 'bewilder the young ideas of Dr. Blimber's young gentlemen.' Sometimes he had his Virgil stop on, and at other times his Herodotus stop. In trying to keep up the comparison, however, Dickens makes a curious mistake. In the above quotation Feeder is assigned one barrel only, while in Chapter XLI we are told that he had 'his other barrels on a shelf behind him.'  We find another comparison in _Little Dorrit_, when the long-suffering Pancks turns round on Casby, his employer, and exposes his hypocrisy. Pancks, who has had much difficulty in getting his master's rents from the tenants, makes up his mind to leave him; and before doing so he tells the whole truth about Casby to the inhabitants of Bleeding Heart Yard. 'Here's the Stop,' said Pancks, 'that sets the tune to be ground. And there is but one tune, and its name is \"Grind! Grind! Grind!\"'   _Guitar_  Although the guitar was a fashionable instrument sixty years ago, there are but few references to it. This was the instrument that enabled the three Miss Briggses, each of them performers, to eclipse the glory of the Miss Tauntons, who could only manage a harp. On the eventful day of 'The Steam Excursion' (_S.B._) the three sisters brought their instruments, carefully packed up in dark green cases,      which were carefully stowed away in the bottom of the     boat, accompanied by two immense portfolios of music,     which it would take at least a week's incessant playing     to get through.  At a subsequent stage of the proceedings they were asked to play, and after replacing a broken string, and a vast deal of screwing and tightening, they gave 'a new Spanish composition, for three voices and three guitars,' and secured an encore, thus completely overwhelming their rivals. In the account of the _French Watering-Place_ (_R.P._) we read about a guitar on the pier, 'to which a boy or woman sings without any voice little songs without any tune.'  On one of his night excursions in the guise of an 'Uncommercial Traveller' Dickens discovered a stranded Spaniard, named Antonio. In response to a general invitation 'the swarthy youth' takes up his cracked guitar and gives them the 'feeblest ghost of a tune,' while the inmates of the miserable den kept time with their heads.  Dora used to delight David Copperfield by singing enchanting ballads in the French language and accompanying herself 'on a glorified instrument, resembling a guitar,' though subsequent references show it was that instrument and none other.  We read in _Little Dorrit_ that Young John Chivery wore 'pantaloons so highly decorated with side stripes, that each leg was a three-stringed lute.' This appears to be the only reference to this instrument, and a lute of three strings is the novelist's own conception, the usual number being about nine.   [9]  Or, 'Mix it up and make it nice.'  [10] _The Public Life of Mr. Tulrumble_, 1837.     CHAPTER IV  VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS (continued)   Many musical instruments and terms are mentioned by way of illustration. Blathers, the Bow Street officer (_O.T._), plays carelessly with his handcuffs as if they were a pair of castanets. Miss Miggs (_B.R._) clanks her pattens as if they were a pair of cymbals. Mr. Bounderby (_H.T._), during his conversation with Harthouse,      with his hat in his hand, gave a beat upon the crown     at every division of his sentences, as if it were     a tambourine;  and in the same work the electric wires rule 'a colossal strip of music-paper out of the evening sky.'  Perhaps the most extraordinary comparison is that instituted by Mrs. Lirriper in reference to her late husband.      My poor Lirriper was a handsome figure of a man,     with a beaming eye and a voice as mellow as a musical     instrument made of honey and steel.  What a vivid imagination the good woman had! Her descriptive powers remind us of those possessed by Mrs. Gamp in speaking of the father of the mysterious Mrs. Harris.      As pleasant a singer, Mr. Chuzzlewit, as ever you heerd,     with a voice like a Jew's-harp in the bass notes.  There are many humorous references to remarkable performances on various instruments more or less musical in their nature. During the election at Eatanswill the crier performed two concertos on his bell, and shortly afterwards followed them up with a fantasia on the same instrument. Dickens suffered much from church bells, and gives vent to his feelings about them in _Little Dorrit_, where he says that      Maddening church bells of all degrees of dissonance,     sharp and flat, cracked and clear, fast and slow,     made the brick-and-mortar echoes hideous.  In his _Pictures from Italy_ he wrote thus:      At Genoa the bells of the church ring incessantly,     not in peals, or any known form of sound, but in     horrible, irregular, jerking dingle, dingle, dingle;     with a sudden stop at every fifteenth dingle or so,     which is maddening.... The noise is supposed to be     particularly obnoxious to evil spirits.  But it was these same bells, which he found so maddening, that inspired him with the title of a well-known story. He had chosen a subject, but was at a loss for a name. As he sat working one morning there suddenly rose up from Genoa      the clang and clash of all its steeples, pouring into     his ears, again and again, in a tuneless, grating,     discordant jerking, hideous vibration that made his     ideas spin round and round till they lost themselves     in a whirl of vexation and giddiness, and dropped     down dead.... Only two days later came a letter in     which not a syllable was written but 'We have heard     THE CHIMES at midnight, Master Shallow,' and I knew     he had discovered what he wanted.[11]  Yet, in spite of all this, Dickens shows--through his characters--a deep interest in bells and bell-lore. Little Paul Dombey finds a man mending the clocks at Dr. Blimber's Academy, and asks a multitude of questions about chimes and clocks; as, whether people watched up in the lonely church steeples by night to make them strike, and how the bells were rung when people died, and whether those were different bells from wedding-bells, or only sounded dismal in the fancies of the living; and then the precocious small boy proceeds to give the astonished clockmaker some useful information about King Alfred's candles and curfew-bells.  As Smike and Nicholas tramp their long journey to Portsmouth they hear the sheep-bells tinkling on the downs. To Tom Pinch journeying Londonwards 'the brass work on the harness was a complete orchestra of little bells.'  What a terror the bells are to Jonas Chuzzlewit just before he starts on his evil journey! He hears      the ringers practising in a neighbouring church, and     the clashing of their bells was almost maddening. Curse     the clamouring bells! they seemed to know that he     was listening at the door, and to proclaim it in a     crowd of voices to all the town! Would they never be     still? They ceased at last, and then the silence was     so new and terrible that it seemed the prelude to some     dreadful noise.  The boom of the bell is associated with many of the villains of the novels. Fagin hears it when under sentence of death. Blackpool and Carker hear the accusing bells when in the midst of planning their evil deeds.  We can read the characters of some by the way they ring a bell. The important little Mr. Bailey, when he goes to see his friend Poll Sweedlepipe (_M.C._) 'came in at the door with a lunge, to get as much sound out of the bell as possible,' while Bob Sawyer gives a pull as if he would bring it up by the roots. Mr. Clennam pulls the rope with a hasty jerk, and Mr. Watkins Tottle with a faltering jerk, while Tom Pinch gives a gentle pull. And how angry Mr. Mantalini is with Newman Noggs because he keeps him      'ringing at this confounded old cracked tea-kettle     of a bell, every tinkle of which is enough to throw     a strong man into convulsions, upon my life and     soul,--oh demmit.'  The introduction of electric bells has been a great trial to those who used to vent their wrath on the wire-pulled article or the earlier bell-rope, which used not infrequently to add unnecessary fuel by coming incontinently down on the head of the aggrieved one. What a pull the fierce gentleman must have given whose acquaintance Mr. Pickwick made when he was going to Bath! He had been"]]]
