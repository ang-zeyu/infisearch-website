Later he had bought more; and Sudden, growing up and falling heir to it all, had added tract after tract by purchase and lease and whatever other devices a good politician may be able to command.  Sudden's father had been a simple man, content to run his ranch along the lines of least resistance, and to take what prosperity came to him in the natural course of events. Sudden had organized a Company, had commercialized his legacy, had \"married money,\" and had made money. Far to the north and to the east and west ran the lines of other great ranches, where sheep were handled in great, blatting bands and yielded a fortune in wool. There were hills where Selmer cattle were wild as deer--cattle that never heard the whistle of a locomotive until they were trailed down to the railroad to market.  These made the money for Selmer and his Company. But it was the Rolling R, where the profits were smaller, that stood closest to Sudden's heart. There was not so much money in horses as there was in sheep; Sudden admitted it readily enough. But he hated sheep; hated the sound of them and the smell of them and the insipid, questioning faces of them. And he loved horses; loved the big-jointed, wabbly legged colts and the round-bodied, anxious mothers; loved the grade geldings and fillies and the registered stock that he kept close to home in fenced pastures; loved the broom-tail bronks that ranged far afield and came in a dust cloud moiling up from their staccato hoof beats, circled by hoarse, shouting riders seen vaguely through the cloud.  There was a thrill in watching a corral full of wild horses milling round and round, dodging the whispering ropes that writhed here and there overhead to settle and draw tight over some unlucky head. There was a thrill in the taming--more thrills than dollars, for until the war overseas brought eager buyers, the net profits of the horse ranch would scarcely have paid for Mary V's clothes and school and what she demurely set down as \"recreation.\"  But Sudden loved it, and Mary V loved it, and Mary V's mother loved whatever they loved. So the Rolling R was home. And that is why the Rolling R boys looked upon Mary V with unglamoured eyes, being thoroughly accustomed to the sight of her and to the sharp tongue of her and to the frequent discomfort of having her about.  They liked her, of course. They would have fought for her if ever the need of fighting came, just as they would have fought for anything else in their outfit. But they took her very calmly and as a matter of course, and were not inclined to that worshipful bearing which romancers would have us accept as the inevitable attitude of cowboys toward the daughter of the rancho.  Wherefore Johnny Jewel was not committing any heinous act of treason when he walked past Mary V with stiffened spine and head averted. Johnny was mad at the whole outfit, and that included Mary V. Indeed, his anger particularly included Mary V. A young man who has finished high school and one year at a university, and who reads technical books rather than fiction and has ambitions for something much higher than his present calling,--oh, very much higher!--would naturally object to being called a witless wight.  Johnny objected. He had cussed Aleck for repeating the epithet in the bunk house, and he had tried to lick Bud Norris, and had failed. He blamed Mary V for his skinned knuckles and the cut on his lip, and for all his other troubles. Johnny did not know about the coat, though he had it on; and if he had known, I doubt whether it would have softened his mood. He was a terribly incensed young man.  Mary V had let her steps lag a little, knowing that Johnny must overtake her presently unless he turned short around and went the other way, which would not be like Johnny. She had meant to say something that would lead the conversation gently toward the verses, and then she meant to say something else about the difficulty of making two lines rhyme, and the necessity of using perfectly idiotic words--such as wight. Mary V was disgusted with the boys for the way they had acted. She meant to tell Johnny that she thought his verses were very clever, and that she, too, was keen for flying. And would he like to borrow a late magazine she had in the house, that had an article about the growth of the \"game\"? Mary V did not know that she would have sounded rather patronizing. Her girl friends in Los Angeles had filled her head with romantic ideas about cowboys, especially her father's cowboys. They had taken it so for granted that the Rolling R boys must simply worship the ground she walked on, that Mary V had unconsciously come to believe that adoration was her birthright.  And then Johnny stepped out of the trail and passed her as though she had been a cactus or a rock that he must walk around! Mary V went hot all over, with rage before her wits came back. Johnny had not gone ten feet ahead of her when she was humming softly to herself a little, old-fashioned tune. And the tune was \"Auld Lang Syne.\"  Johnny whirled in the trail and faced her, hard-eyed.  \"You're trying to play smart Aleck, too, are yuh?\" he demanded. \"Why don't yuh sing the words that's in your mind? Why don't you _try_ to sing your own ideas of poetry? You know as much about writing poetry as I do about tatting! 'Worry'! 'surrey'! Or did you mean that it should be read 'wawry,' 'sorry'?\"  A fine way to talk to the Flower of the Rancho! Mary V looked as though she wanted to slap Johnny Jewel's smooth, boyish face.  \"Of course, you're qualified to teach me,\" she retorted. \"Such doggerel! You ought to send it to the comic papers. Really, Mr. Jewel, I have read a good deal of amateurish, childish attempts at poetry--in the infant class at school. But never in all my life--\"  \"Oh, well, if you ever get out of the infant class, Miss Selmer, you may learn a few rudimentary rules of metrical composition. I apologize for criticising your efforts. It is not so bad--for infant class work.\" He said that, standing there in the very coat which she had mended for him!  Mary V turned white; also she wished that _she_ had thought of mentioning the \"rudimentary rules of metrical composition\" instead of infant classes. She smiled as disagreeably as was possible to such humanly kissable lips as hers.  \"No, is it?\" she agreed sweetly. \"Witless wight was rather good, I thought. Wight fits you so well.\"  \"Oh, that!\" Johnny turned defensively to a tolerant condescension. \"That wasn't so bad, if it hadn't shown on the face of it that it was just dragged in to make a rhyme. Do you know what wight means, Miss Selmer?\"  Mary V was inwardly shaken. She had always believed that wight was a synonym for dunce, but now that he put the question to her in that tone, she was not positive. Her angry eyes faltered a little.  \"I see you don't--of course. Used as a noun--you know what a noun is, don't you? It means the name of anything. Wight means a person--any creature. Originally it meant a fairy, a supernatural being. As an adjective it means brave, valiant, strong or powerful. Or, it used to mean clever.\"  \"Oh, _you_! I hate the sight of you, you great bully!\" Mary V ducked past him and ran.  \"I'll help you look it up in the dictionary if you don't know how,\" Johnny called after her maliciously, not at all minding the epithet she had hurled at him. He went on more cheerfully, telling himself unchivalrously that he had got Mary V's goat, all right. He began to whistle under his breath, until he discovered that he was whistling \"Auld Lang Syne,\" and was mentally fitting to the tune the words: \"_Before I die, I'll ride the sky. I'll part the clouds like foam!_\"  He stopped whistling then, but the words went on repeating themselves over and over in his mind. \"And by gosh, I will too,\" he stated defiantly. \"I'll show 'em, the darned mutts! They can yawp and chortle and call me Skyrider as if it was a joke. That's as much as they know, the ignorant boobs. Why, they couldn't tell an aileron from an elevator if it was to save their lives!--and still they think I'm crazy and don't know anything. Why, darn 'em, they'll _pay money_ some day to see me fly! Boy, I'd like to circle over this ranch at about three or four thousand feet, and then do a loop or two and volplane right down _at_ 'em! Gosh, they'd be hunting holes to crawl into before I was through with 'em! I will, too--\"  Johnny went off into a pet daydream and was almost happy for a little while. Some day the Rolling R boys would be telling with pride how they used to know Johnny Jewel, the wonderful birdman that had his picture in all the papers and was getting thousands of dollars for exhibition flights. Tex, Aleck, Bud, Bill--Mary V, too, gol darn her!--would go around bragging just because they used to know him! And right then he'd sure play even for some of the insults they were handing him now.  \"Mary V Selmer? Let's see--the name sounds familiar, somehow. O-oh! You mean that little red-headed ranch girl from Arizona? Oh-h, yes! Well, give her a free pass--but I mustn't be bothered personally with her. The girl's all right, but no training, no manners. Hick stuff; no class, you understand. But give her a good seat, where she can view the getaway.\"  Tex, Aleck, Bud, and Bill--little Curley was all right; Curley could have a job as watchman at the hangar. But the rest of the bunch could goggle at him from a distance and be darned to them. Old Sudden too. He'd be kind of nice to old Sudden--nice in an offhand, indifferent kind of way. But Mary V could get down on her _knees_, and he wouldn't be nice to her. He should say not!  So dreamed Johnny Jewel, all the way to the mail box out by the main road, and nearly all the way back again. But then his ears were assailed with lugubrious singing:    \"An' dlead the Great Bear ho-o-ome,    An' dlead the Great Bear hoo-me,    I'll brand each star with "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16871"],["title","Skyrider (#3)"],["body","Rollin' R,    An-n dlead the Great Bear home!\"  That was Bud's contribution.  \"Aw, for gosh sake, _shut up_!\" yelled Johnny, his temper rising again.  From the bungalow, when he passed it on his way to the bunk house, came the measured thump-thump of a piano playing the same old tune with a stress meant to mock him and madden him.    \"Then if she'll smile I'll stop awhile,    And kiss her snow-white hand.\"  That was Mary V, singing at the top of her voice, and Johnny walked stiff-backed down the path. He wanted to turn and repeat to Mary V what he had shouted to Bud, but he refrained, though not from any chivalry, I am sorry to say. Johnny feared that it would be playing into her hand too much if he took that much notice of her. He wouldn't give her the satisfaction of knowing he heard her.    \"It would be grand to kiss 'er hand,    Her-rr snow-white hand if I had the sand,\"  Bud finished unctuously, adjusting the tune to fit the words.  Johnny swore, flung open the low door of the bunk house, went in, and slammed it shut after him, and began to pack his personal belongings. Presently Tex came in, warbling like a lovesick crow:    \"I'll cir-cle high 's if pass-in' by,    Then vol-lup bank-an' la-a-and--\"  \"So will this la-and,\" Johnny said viciously and threw one of his new riding boots straight at the warbler. \"For gosh sake, lay off that stuff!\"  Tex caught the boot dexterously without interrupting his song, except that he forgot the words and sang ta-da-da-da to the end of the verse.  \"Po'try was wrote to be read,\" he replied sententiously when he had finished. \"And tunes was made to be sung. And yo' all oughta be proud to death at the way yo' all made a hit with yore po'try. It beats what Mary V wrote, Skyrider. If yo' all want to know my honest opinion, Mary V's plumb sore because yo' all made up po'try about Venus instid of about her.\" He sat down on a corner of the littered table and began to roll a cigarette, jerking his head towards the bungalow and lowering one eyelid slowly. \"Girls, I'm plumb next to 'em, Skyrider. I growed up with four of 'em. Mary V loves that there Venus stuff, and kissin' her snow-white hand, same as a cat loves snow. Jealous--that's what's bitin' Mary V.\"  Johnny was sorting letters, mostly circulars and \"follow up\" letters from various aviation schools. He looked up suspiciously at Tex, but Tex manifested none of the symptoms of sly \"kidding.\" Tex was smoking meditatively and gazing absently at Johnny's suitcase.  \"Yo' all ain't quittin'?\" Tex roused himself to ask. \"Not over a little josh? Say, you're layin' yoreself wide open to more of the same. Yo' all wants to take it the way it's meant, Skyrider. Listen here, boy, if yo' all wants to git away from the ranch right now, why don't yo' all speak for to stay at Sinkhole camp? Yo' all could have mo' time to write po'try an' study up on flyin' machines, down there. And Pete, he's aimin' to quit the first. He don't like it down there.\"  Johnny dropped the letters back into his suitcase and sat down on the side of his bed to smoke. His was not the nature to hold a grudge, and Tex seemed to be friendly. Still, his youthful dignity had been very much hurt, and by Tex as much as the other boys. He gave him a supercilious glance.  \"I don't know where you get the idea that I'm a quitter,\" he said pettishly. \"First I knew that a bunch of rough-necks could kid me out of a job. Go down to Sinkhole yourself, if you're so anxious about that camp. Furthermore,\" he added stiffly, \"it's nobody's business but mine what I write or study, or where I write and study. So don't set there trying to look wise, Tex--telling me what to do and how to do it. You can't put anything over on me; your work is too raw. Al-to-gether too raw!\"  He glanced sidewise at a circular letter he had dropped, picked it up and began reading it slowly, one eye squinted against the smoke of his cigarette, his manner that of supreme indifference to Tex and all his kind. Johnny could be very, very indifferent when he chose.  He did not really believe that Tex was trying to put anything over on him; he just said that to show Tex he didn't give a darn one way or the other. But Tex seemed to take it seriously, and glowered at Johnny from under his black eyebrows that had a hawklike arch.  \"What yo' all think I'm trying to put over? Hey? What yo' all mean by that statement?\"  Johnny looked up, one eye still squinted against the smoke. The other showed surprise back of the indifference. \"You there yet?\" he wanted to know. \"What's the big idea? Gone to roost for the night?\"  Tex leaned toward him, waggling one finger at Johnny. The outer end of his eyebrows were twitching--a sign of anger in Tex, as Johnny knew well.  \"What yo' all got up yore sleeve--saying my work is raw! What yo' all aimin' at? That's what I'm roostin' here to learn.\"  Johnny fanned away the smoke and gave a little chuckle meant to exasperate Tex, which it did.  \"I guess the roosting's going to be pretty good,\" he said. \"You better send cookee word to bring your meals to yuh, Tex. Because if you roost there till I tell yuh, you'll be roosting a good long while!\" He got up and lounged out, his hands in his pockets, his well-shaped head carried at a provocative tilt. He heard Tex swear under his breath and mutter something about making the darned little runt come through yet, whereat Johnny grinned maliciously.  Halfway to the corral, however, Johnny's steps slowed as though he were walking straight up to a wall. The wall was there, but it was mental, and it was his mind that halted before it, astonished.  What had touched Tex off so suddenly when Johnny had flung out that meaningless taunt? Meaningless to Johnny--but how about Tex?  \"Gosh! He took it like a guilty conscience,\" said Johnny. \"What the horn-toad has Tex been doin'?\"     CHAPTER THREE  JOHNNY GOES GAILY ENOUGH TO SINKHOLE   Johnny Jewel, moved by the fluctuating determination of the young, went to bed that night fully resolved that he would not quit a good job just because untoward circumstance compelled him to herd with a bunch of brainless clowns. He, who had a definite aim in life, would not permit that aim to be turned aside because various and sundry roughneck punchers thought it was funny to go around yelping like a band of coyotes. Mary V, too--he did not neglect to include Mary V. Indeed, much of his determination to remain was born of his desire to crush that insolent young woman with polite, pitying toleration.  Even when the boys trooped in and began to compose what they believed to be rhymes, Johnny did not weaken. He turned his face to the wall and ignored them. Poor simps, what more could you expect? They went so far as to attempt some poetizing on the subject of Johnny's downfall in the corral, but no one seemed able to eliminate the word bronk at the end of the first line, \"_Johnny tried to ride a bronk._\" No one seemed able, either, to find any rhyme but honk. They tried ker-plunk, and although that seemed to answer the purpose fairly well, they were far from satisfied.  So was Johnny, but he would not say a word to save their lives. In spite of himself he heard a howl of glee when some genius among them declaimed loudly: \"_Johnny volluped into Job's Coffin, and Venus she most died a-lawfin!_\"  Johnny gave a grunt of contempt, and the genius, who happened to be Bud, lifted his head off the pillow and stared at the black shadow where Johnny lay curled up like a cat.  \"What's the matter with that, Skyrider? Kain't I make up po'try if I want to?\"  \"Sure. Help yourself--you poor fish. Vollup! _Hunh!_\" The contempt was even more pronounced than before.  \"Well? What's the matter with that? You said it yourself. And look out how you go peddlin' names around here. You think nobody knows anything but you! You're the little boy that invented flyin'--got the idea from yore own head, by thunder, when it swelled up like a balloon with self-conceit! That there gas-head of yourn'll take yuh right up amongst the clouds some day, and you won't need no flyin' machine, neither! Skyrider--is--_right_!\" Accidentally Johnny had touched Bud's self-esteem in a tender spot. \"And that's no kidding, either!\" he clinched his meaning. \"Punch a hole in yore skelp, and I'll bet that big haid of yourn would wizzle all up like them red balloons they sell at circuses! You--\"  \"_Hm-m-m!_ Just so it ain't all solid bone like yours,\" Johnny came back at him with youth's full quota of scorn. \"Keep away from pool rooms, Bud. Somebody is liable to take your head off and use it for a cue-ball. _Vollup! Hunh!_\"  Bud said more; a great deal more. But Johnny flopped over on the other side, buried his head under the blankets, and let them talk. Cue-balls--that was all their heads were good for. So why concern himself over their senseless patter?  It occurred to him, just before he went to sleep, that the unmistakable, southern drawl of Tex was missing from the jumble of voices. Tex, he remembered, had been unusually silent at supper, also, and twice Johnny had caught Tex watching him somberly. But he could think of no possible reason why Tex should want him to go down to Sinkhole Camp, and he could not see how either of them could effect the change even if Johnny had cared to go. Sudden Selmer did not ask his men what was their desire. Sudden gave orders; his men could obey or they could quit. And if Pete left, as Tex had hinted, Sudden would send some one down there, and that would be an end of it. There was just about one chance in six that Johnny Jewel would be the man to go.  Yet it so happened that Johnny did go--though Tex had nothing to do with it, so far as Johnny could see. For all his determination to stay and tolerate his companions, noon found him packed and out by the gate that opened on the stage road, waiting to flag the stage and buy a ride to town. He had accomplished, since breakfast, two fights and another quarrel with Mary V over that infernal jingle"]]]
