Their humor in the main, manifested itself in coarse and vulgar jests.  For athletics they had their turn vereins in which men went through hard, laborious exercises which made them muscle-bound. Their favorite sports were hunting and fencing--the desire to kill or wound. They rowed some but they knew nothing of baseball, boxing, tennis, golf or the usual sports so popular with young men in England, France and America. Aside from fencing, they had not a sport calculated to produce agility or nimbleness of foot and brain.  Their emotions expanded and their sentiments thrilled at the spectacle of war. Uniforms, helmets and gold lace delighted their eyes. The parade, the guard mount, the review were the finest things they knew. To a people trained in such a school and purposely given great burdens that they might attain fortitude, war was second nature. They welcomed it as a sort of pastime.  In the system on which Kultur was based, it was necessary to strike deeply the religious note; no difference if it was a false note. The German ear was so accustomed to discord it could not recognize the true from the false. The Kaiser was heralded to his people as a deeply religious man. In his public utterances he never failed to call upon God to grant him aid and bless his works.  One of the old traditions of the Fatherland was that the king, being specially appointed by God, could do no wrong. To the thinking portion of the nation this could have been nothing less than absurd fallacy, but where the majority do not think; if a thing is asserted strongly and often enough, they come to accept it. It becomes a belief. The people had become so impressed with the devoutness of the Kaiser and his assumption of Divine guidance, that the great majority of them believed the kaiser was always right; that he could do no wrong. When the great blow of war finally was struck the Kaiser asked his God to look down and bless the sword that he had drawn; a prayer altogether consistent coming from his lips, for the god he worshipped loved war, was a god of famine, rapine and blood. From the moment of that appeal, military autocracy and absolute monarchy were doomed. It took time, it took lives, it took more treasure than a thousand men could count in a lifetime. But the assault had been against civilization, on the very foundation of all that humanity had gained through countless centuries. The forces of light were too strong for it; would not permit it to triumph.  The President of the United States, from the bedside of his dying wife, appealed to the nations for some means of reaching peace for Europe. The last thoughts of his dying helpmate, were of the great responsibility resting upon her husband incident to the awful crisis in the lives of the nations of earth, that was becoming more pronounced with each second of time.  The Pope was stricken to death by the great calamity to civilization. A few minutes before the end came he said that the Almighty in His infinite mercy was removing him from the world to spare him the anguish of the awful war.  The first inclination of America was to be neutral. She was far removed from the scenes of strife and knew little of the hidden springs and causes of the war. Excepting in the case of a few of her public men; her editors, professors and scholars, European politics were as a sealed book. The president of the United States declared for neutrality; that individual and nation should avoid the inflaming touch of the war passion. We kept that attitude as long as was consistent with national patience and the larger claims of HUMANITY and universal JUSTICE.  As an evidence of our lack of knowledge of the impending conflict, a party of Christian men were on the sea with the humanitarian object in view of attending a world's peace conference in Constance, Germany--Germany of all places, then engaged in trying to burn up the world. Arriving in Paris, the party received its first news that a great European war was about to begin. Steamship offices were being stormed by crowds of frantic American tourists. Martial law was declared. The streets were alive with soldiers and weeping women. Shops were closed, the clerks having been drafted into the army. The city hummed with militarism.  Underneath the excitement was the stern, stoic attitude of the French in preparing to meet their old enemy, combined with their calmness in refraining from outbreaks against German residents of Paris. One of the party alluding to the incongruous position in which the peace delegates found themselves, said:       \"It might be interesting to observe the unique and almost humorous      situation into which these peace delegates were thrown. Starting      out a week before with the largest hope and most enthusiastic      anticipation of effecting a closer tie between nations, and      swinging the churches of Christendom into a clearer alignment      against international martial attitudes, we were instantly      'disarmed,' bound, and cast into chains of utter helplessness, not      even feeling free to express the feeblest sentiment against the      high rising tide of military activity. We were lost on a      tempestuous sea; the dove of peace had been beaten, broken winged      to shore, and the olive branch lost in its general fury.\"  Describing conditions in Paris on August 12, he says:       \"We are in a state of tense expectation, so acute that it dulls the      senses; Paris is relapsing into the condition of an audience      assisting at a thrilling drama with intolerably long entr'acts,      during which it tries to think of its own personal affairs.       \"We know that pages of history are being rapidly engraved in steel,      written in blood, illuminated in the margin with glory on a      background of heroism and suffering, not more than a few score      miles away.       \"The shrieking camelots (peddlers) gallop through the streets      waving their news sheets, but it is almost always news of      twenty-four hours ago. The iron hand of the censor reduces the      press to a monotonous repetition of the same formula. Only      headlines give scope for originality. Of local news there is none.      There is nothing doing in Paris but steady preparation for meeting      contingencies by organizing ambulances and relief for the poor.\"  From the thousands of tales brought back by American tourists caught in Germany at the outbreak of the war, there is more than enough evidence that they were not treated with that courtesy manifested towards them by the French. They were arrested as spies, subjected to all sorts of embarrassments and indignities; their persons searched, their baggage and letters examined, and frequently were detained for long periods without any explanation being offered. When finally taken to the frontier, they were not merely put across--frequently they were in a sense thrown across.  Nor were the subjects of other nations, particularly those with which Germany was at war, treated with that fine restraint which characterized the French. Here is an account by a traveller of the treatment of Russian subjects:       \"We left Berlin on the day Germany declared war against Russia. Within      seventy-five miles of the frontier, 1,000 Russians in the train by      which they were travelling were turned out of the carriage and      compelled to spend eighteen hours without food in an open field      surrounded by soldiers with fixed bayonets.       \"Then they were placed in dirty cattle wagons, about sixty men, women      and children to a wagon, and for twenty-eight hours were carried about      Prussia without food, drink or privacy. In Stettin they were lodged in      pig pens, and next morning were sent off by steamer to Rugen, whence      they made their way to Denmark and Sweden without money or luggage.      Sweden provided them with food and free passage to the Russian      frontier. Five of our fellow-passengers went mad.\"  The steamship Philadelphia--note the name, signifying brotherly love, so completely lost sight of in the conflict--was the first passenger liner to reach America after the beginning of the European war. A more remarkable crowd never arrived in New York City by steamship or train. There were men of millions and persons of modest means who had slept side by side on the journey over; voyagers with balances of tens of thousands of dollars in banks and not a cent in their pocketbooks; men able and eager to pay any price for the best accommodations to be had, yet satisfied and happy sharing bunks in the steerage.  There were women who had lost all baggage and had come alone, their friends and relatives being unable to get accommodations on the vessel. There were children who had come on board with their mothers, with neither money nor reservations, who were happy because they had received the very best treatment from all the steamship's officers and crew and because they had enjoyed the most comfortable quarters to be had, surrendered by men who were content to sleep in most humble surroundings, or, if necessary, as happened in a few cases, to sleep on the decks when the weather permitted.  Wealthy, but without funds, many of the passengers gave jewelry to the stewards and other employees of the steamship as the tips which they assumed were expected even in times of stress. The crew took them apologetically, some said they were content to take only the thanks of the passengers. One woman of wealth and social position, without money, and having lost her check book with her baggage, as had many others of the passengers, gave a pair of valuable bracelets to her steward with the request that he give them to his wife. She gave a hat--the only one she managed to take with her on her flight from Switzerland--to her stewardess.  The statue of Liberty never looked so beautiful to a party of Americans before. The strains of the Star Spangled Banner, as they echoed over the waters of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16598"],["title","History of the American Negro in the Great World War (#8)"],["body","bay, were never sweeter nor more inspiring. As the Philadelphia approached quarrantine, the notes of the American anthem swelled until, as she slowed down to await the coming of the physicians and customs officials, it rose to a great crescendo which fell upon the ears of all within many hundred yards and brought an answering chorus from the throngs who waited to extend their hands to relatives and friends.  There was prophecy in the minds of men and women aboard that ship. Some of them had been brought into actual contact with the war; others very near it. In the minds of all was the vision that liberty, enlightenment and all the fruits of progress were threatened; that if they were to be saved, somehow, this land typified the spirit of succor; somehow the aid was to proceed from here.  Liberty never had a more cherished meaning to men of this Republic. In the minds of many the conviction had taken root, that if autocracy and absolute monarchy were to be overthrown; that \"government of the people, by the people, for the people\" should \"not perish from the earth,\" it would eventually require from America that supreme sacrifice in devotion and blood that at periods in the growth and development of nations, is their last resort against the menace of external attack, and, regardless of the reflections of theorists and philosophers, the best and surest guarantee of their longevity; that the principles upon which they were builded were something more than mere words, hollow platitudes, meaning nothing, worthy of nothing, inspiring nothing. It was the dawning of a day; new and strange in its requirements of America whose isolation and policy, as bequeathed by the fathers, had kept it aloof from the bickerings and quarrels of the nations that composed the \"Armed Camp\" of Europe, during which, as subsequent events proved, the blood of the Caucasian and the Negro would upon many a hard fought pass; many a smoking trench in the battle zone of Europe, run together in one rivulet of departing life, for the guarantee of liberty throughout all the earth, and the establishment of justice at its uttermost bounds and ends.     CHAPTER IV  AWAKENING OF AMERICA   PRESIDENT CLINGS TO NEUTRALITY--MONROE DOCTRINE AND WASHINGTON'S WARNING--GERMAN CRIMES AND GERMAN VICTORIES--CARDINAL MERCIER'S LETTER--MILITARY OPERATIONS--FIRST SUBMARINE ACTIVITIES--THE LUSITANIA OUTRAGE--EXCHANGE OF NOTES--UNITED STATES AROUSED--ROLE OF PASSIVE ONLOOKER BECOMES IRKSOME--FIRST MODIFICATION OF PRINCIPLES OF WASHINGTON AND MONROE--OUR DESTINY LOOMS.   August 4,1914, President Wilson proclaimed the neutrality of the United States. A more consistent attempt to maintain that attitude was never made by a nation. In an appeal addressed to the American people on August 18th, the president implored the citizens to refrain from \"taking sides.\" Part of his utterance on that occasion was:       \"We must be impartial in thought as well as in action, must put a      curb upon our sentiments as well as upon every transaction that      might be construed as a preference of one party to the struggle      before another.       \"My thought is of America. I am speaking, I feel sure, the earnest      wish and purpose of every thoughtful American that this great      country of ours, which is, of course, the first in our thoughts and      in our hearts, should show herself in this time of peculiar trial a      nation fit beyond others to exhibit the fine poise of undisturbed      judgment, the dignity of self-control, the efficiency of      dispassionate action; a nation that neither sits in judgment upon      others, nor is disturbed in her own counsels, and which keeps      herself fit and free to do what is honest and disinterested and      truly serviceable for the peace of the world.\"  American poise had been somewhat disturbed over the treatment of American tourists caught in Germany at the outbreak of the war. American sentiment was openly agitated by the invasion of Belgium and the insolent repudiation by Germany of her treaty obligations. The German chancellor had referred to the treaty with Belgium as \"a scrap of paper.\" These things had created a suspicion in American minds, having to do with what seemed Germany's real and ulterior object, but in the main the people of this county accepted the president's appeal in the spirit in which it was intended and tried to live up to it, which attitude was kept to the very limit of human forbearance.  A few editors and public men, mostly opposed to the president politically, thought we were carrying the principle of neutrality too far; that the violation of Belgium was a crime against humanity in general and that if we did not at least protest against it, we would be guilty of national stultification if not downright cowardice. Against this view was invoked the time-honored principles of the Monroe Doctrine and its great corollary, Washington's advice against becoming entangled in European affairs. Our first president, in his farewell address, established a precept of national conduct that up to the time we were drawn into the European war, had become almost a principle of religion with us. He said:       \"Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to      believe me, fellow citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to      constantly awake, since history and experience prove that foreign      influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican      government--Europe has a set of primary interests which to us have      none or a very remote relation. Hence she must be engaged in      frequent controversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign      to our concern. Hence, therefore, it must be unwise in us to      implicate ourselves by artificial ties in the ordinary vicissitudes      of her politics or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her      friendships or enmities.\"  The Monroe Doctrine was a statement of principles made by President Monroe in his famous message of December 2, 1823. The occasion of the utterance was the threat by the so-called Holy Alliance to interfere forcibly in South America with a view to reseating Spain in control of her former colonies there. President Monroe, pointing to the fact that it was a principle of American policy not to intermeddle in European affairs, gave warning that any attempt by the monarchies of Europe \"to extend their system to any portion of this hemisphere\" would be considered by the United States \"as dangerous to our peace and safety.\" This warning fell in line with British policy at the time and so proved efficacious.

This clause of the doctrine was the work of Monroe's secretary of state, John Quincy Adams, and its occasion was furnished by the fear that Russia was planning to set up a colony at San Francisco, then the property of Spain, whose natural heir on the North American continent, Adams held, was the United States. It is this clause of the document that has furnished much of the basis for its subsequent development.  In 1902 Germany united with Great Britain and Italy to collect by force certain claims against Venezuela. President Roosevelt demanded and finally, after threatening to dispatch Admiral Dewey to the scene of action, obtained a statement that she would not permanently occupy Venezuelan territory. Of this statement one of the most experienced and trusted American editors, avowedly friendly to Germany, remarked at the time, that while he believed \"it was and will remain true for some time to come, I cannot, in view of the spirit now evidently dominant in the mind of the emperor and among many who stand near him, express any belief that such assurances will remain trustworthy for any great length of time after Germany shall have developed a fleet larger than that of the United States.\" He accordingly cautioned the United States \"to bear in mind probabilities and possibilities as to the future conduct of Germany, and therefore increase"]]]
