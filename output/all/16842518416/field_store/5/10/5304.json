Pa took a key ring out of his vest pocket and unlocked the door, then swung it open. Each of us shouldered our bags and walked through, in eerie silence, into a pitch black room.  Pa reached out and pulled the door shut, then there was a sharp click and we were in 1975.  #  1975 was a queer sight. Our apartment was a lozenge of silver, spoked into the hub of a floating null-gee doughnut. Pa did something fancy with his hands and the walls went transparent, and I swear, I dropped to the floor and hugged the nubby rubber tiles for all I was worth. My eyes were telling me that we were hundreds of yards off the ground, and while I'd jumped from the rafters of the horsebarn into the hay countless times, I suddenly discovered that I was afraid of heights.  After that first dizzying glimpse of 1975, I kept my eyes squeezed shut and held on for all I was worth. After a minute or two of this, my stomach told me that I wasn't falling, and I couldn't hear any rushing wind, any birdcalls, anything except Mama and Pa laughing, fit to bust. I opened one eye and snuck a peek. My folks were laughing so hard they had to hold onto each other to stay up, and they were leaning against thin air, Pa's back pressed up against nothing at all.  Cautiously, I got to my feet and walked over to the edge. I extended one finger and it bumped up against an invisible wall, cool and smooth as glass in winter.  \"James,\" said my Pa, smiling so wide that his thick moustache stretched all the way across his face, \"welcome to 1975.\"  #  Pa's ambassadorial mission meant that he often spent long weeks away from home, teleporting in only for Sunday dinner, the stink of aliens and distant worlds clinging to him even after he washed up. The last Sunday dinner I had with him, Mama had made mashed potatoes and corn bread and sausage gravy and turkey, spending the whole day with the wood-fired cooker back in 1898 (actually, it was 1901 by then, but I always thought of it as 1898). She'd moved the cooker into the horsebarn after a week of wrestling with the gadgets we had in our 1975 kitchen, and when Pa had warned her that the smoke was going to raise questions in New Jerusalem, she explained that she was going to run some flexible exhaust hose through the door into 75 and into our apt's air-scrubber. Pa had shook his head and smiled at her, and every Sunday, she dragged the exhaust pipe through the door.  That night, Pa sat down and said grace, and he was in his shirtsleeves with his suspenders down, and it almost felt like home -- almost felt like a million Sunday dinners eaten by gaslight, with a sweaty pitcher of lemonade in the middle of the table, and seasonal wildflowers, and a stinky cheroot for Pa afterwards as he tipped his chair back and rested one hand on his belly, as if he couldn't believe how much Mama had managed to stuff him this time.  \"How are your studies coming, James?\" he asked me, when the robutler had finished clearing the plates and clattered away into its nook.  \"Very well, sir. We're starting calculus now.\" Truth be told, I hated calculus, hated Isaac Newton and asymptotes and the whole smelly business. Even with the viral learning shots, it was like swimming in molasses for me.  \"Calculus! Well, well, well --\" this was one of Pa's catch-all phrases, like \"How _about_ that?\" or \"What do you know?\" \"Well, well, well. I can't believe how much they stuff into kids' heads here.\"  \"Yes, sir. There's an awful lot left to learn, yet.\" We did a subject every two weeks. So far, I'd done French, Molecular and Cellular Biology, Physics and Astrophysics, Esperanto, Cantonese and Mandarin, and an alien language whose name translated as \"Standard.\" I'd been exempted from History, of course, along with the other kids there from the past -- the Chinese girl from the Ming Dynasty, the Roman boy, and the Injun kid from South America.  Pa laughed around his cigar and crossed his legs. His shoes were so big, they looked like canoes. \"There surely is, son. There surely is. And how are you doing with your classmates? Any tussles your teacher will want to talk to me about?\"  \"No, sir! We're friendly as all get-out, even the girls.\" The kids in 75 didn't even notice what they were doing in school. They just sat down at their workstations and waited to have their brains filled with whatever was going on, and left at three, and never complained about something being too hard or too dull.  \"That's good to hear, son. You've always been a good boy. Tell you what: you bring home a good report this Christmas, and I'll take you to see Saturn's rings on vacation.\"  Mama shot him a look then, but he pretended he didn't see it. He stubbed out his cigar, hitched up his suspenders, and put on his tailcoat and tophat and ambassadorial sash and picked up his leather case.  \"Good night, son. Good night, Ulla. I'll see you on Wednesday,\" he said, and stepped into the teleporter.  That was the last time I ever saw him.  #  \"He died from bad snails?\" Oly Sweynsdatter said to me, yet again.  I balled up a fist and stuck it under his nose. \"For the last time, yes. Ask me again, and I'll feed you this.\"  I'd been back for a month, and in all that time, Oly had skittered around me like a shy pony, always nearby but afraid to talk to me. Finally, I'd grabbed him and shook him and told him not to be such a ninny, tell me what was on his mind. He wanted to know how my Pa had died, over in France. I told him the reason that Mama and Mr Johnstone and the man from the embassy had worked out together. Now, I regretted it. I couldn't get him to shut up.  \"Sorry, all right, sorry!\" he said, taking a step backwards. We were in the orchard behind the schoolyard, chucking rotten apples at the tree-trunks to watch them splatter. \"Want to hear something?\"  \"Sure,\" I said.  \"Tommy Benson's sweet on Marta Helprin. It's disgusting. They hold hands -- _in church_! None of the fellows will talk to him.\"  I didn't see what the big deal was. Back in 75, we had had a two-week session on sexual reproduction, like all the other subjects. Most of the kids there were already in couples, sneaking off to low-gee bounceataria and renting private cubes with untraceable cash-tokens. I'd even tussled with one girl, Katebe M'Buto, another exchange student, from United Africa Trading Sphere. I'd picked her up at her apt, and her father had even shaken my hand -- they grow up fast in UATS. Of course, I'd never let on to my folks. Pa would've broken an axle. \"That's pretty disgusting, all right,\" I said, unconvincingly.  \"You want to go down to the river? I told Amos and Luke that I'd meet them after lunch.\"  I didn't much feel like it, but I didn't know what else to do. We walked down to the swimming hole, where some boys were already naked, swimming and horsing around. I found myself looking away, conscious of their nudity in a way that I'd never been before -- all the boys in town swam there, all summer long.  I turned my back to the group and stripped down, then ran into the water as quick as I could.  I paddled around a little, half-heartedly, and then I found myself being pulled under! My sinuses filled with water and I yelled a stream of bubbles, and closed my mouth on a swallow of water. Strong hands pulled at my ankles. I kicked out as hard as I could, and connected with someone's head. The hands loosened and I shot up like a cork, sputtering and coughing. I ran for the shore, and saw one of the Allen brothers surfacing, rubbing at his head and laughing. The four Allen boys lived on a ranch with their parents out by the salt flats, and we only saw them when they came into town with their folks for supplies. I'd never liked them, but now, I saw red.  \"You pig!\" I shouted at him. \"You stupid, rotten, pig! What the heck do you think you were doing?\"  The Allens kept on laughing -- I used to know some of their names, but in the time I'd been in 75, they'd grown as indistinguishable as twins: big, hard boys with their heads shaved for lice. They pointed at me and laughed. I scooped up a flat stone from the shore and threw it at the head of the one who'd pulled me under, as hard as I could.  Lucky for him -- and me! -- I was too angry to aim properly, and the stone hit him in the shoulder, knocking him backwards. He shouted at me -- it was like a roar of a wild animal -- and the four brothers charged.  Oly appeared at my side. \"Run!\" he shouted.  I was too angry. I balled my fists and stood my ground. The first one shot out of the water towards me, and punched me so hard in the guts, I saw stars. I fell to the ground, gasping. I looked up at a forest of strong, bare legs, and knew they'd surrounded me.  \"It's the Sheriff!\" Oly shouted. The legs disappeared. I struggled to my knees.  Oly collapsed to the ground beside me, laughing. \"Did you see the way they ran? The Sheriff never comes down to the river!\"  \"Thanks,\" I said, around gasps, and started to get dressed.  \"Any time,\" he said. \"Now, let's do some swimming.\"  \"No, I gotta go home and help Mama,\" I lied. I didn't feel like going skinny dipping anymore -- maybe never again.  Oly gave me a queer look. \"OK. See you.\"  #  I went straight home, pelting down the road as fast as I could, not even looking where I was going. I let the door slam behind me and took the stairs two at a time up to the attic ladder, then bolted the trap-door shut behind me and sat in the dark, with my knees in my chest.  Down below, Mama let out a half-hearted, \"James? Is that you?\" like she always did since I came back home. I ignored her, like always, and she stopped worrying about it, like always.  Pa's last trip had been to the Dalai Lama's court in 1975. The man from the embassy said that he was going to talk with the monks about a \"white-paper that the two embassies were jointly presenting on the effect of mimetic ambassadorships on the reincarnated soul.\" It was all nonsense to me. He'd never arrived. The"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16721"],["title","A Place so Foreign (#3)"],["body","said that it had put him down gentle as you like on the floor of the Lama's floating castle over the Caspian Sea, but the monks never saw him.  And that was that.  It had been a month since our return. I'd ventured out into town and looked up my chums, and found them so full of gossip that didn't mean anything to me; so absorbed with games that seemed childish to me; so strange, that I'd retreated home. I'd prowled around our house like a burglar at first, and when I came back to the attic, all the numbness that had enveloped me since the man from the State Department had teleported into our apt melted away and I started bawling.  The attic had always been Pa's domain. He'd come up here with whatever crackpot invention he'd ordered this month out of a catalog or one of the expensive, foreign journals he subscribed to, and tinker and swear and hit his thumbnail and tear his pants on a stray dingus and smoke his cheroots and have a heck of a time.  The muffled tread of his feet and the distant cursing while I sat in the parlour downstairs had been the homiest sound I knew. Mama and I would lock eyes every time a particularly forceful round of hollers shook down, and Mama would get a little smile and her eyes would crinkle, and I felt like we were sharing a secret.  Now, the attic was my private domain: there was the elixir shelf, full of patent medicines, hair-tonics, and soothing syrups. There was the bookcase full of wild theories and fantastic adventure stories. There were the crates full of dangerous, coal-fired machines -- an automatic clothes-washing-machine, a cherry-pitter, and other devices whose nature I couldn't even guess at. None of them had ever worked, but I liked to run my hands over them, feel the smooth steel of their parts, disassemble and reassemble them. Back in 75, I'd once tried to take the robutler apart, just to get a look at how it was all put together, but it was a lost cause -- I couldn't even figure out how to get the cover off.  I walked through the cool dark, the only light coming from the grimy attic window, and fondled each piece. I picked up an oilcan and started oiling the joints and bearings and axles of each machine in turn. Pa would have wanted to know that everything was in good working order.  #  \"I think you should be going to school, James,\" Mama said, at breakfast. I'd already done my morning chores, bringing in the coal, chopping kindling, taking care of the milch-cows and making my bed.  I took another forkful of sausage, and a spoonful of mush, chewed, and looked at my plate.  \"It's time, it's time. You can't spend the rest of your life sulking around here. Your father would have wanted us to get on with our lives.\"  Even though I wasn't looking at her when she said this, I knew that her eyes were bright with tears, the way they always got when she mentioned Pa. His chair sat, empty, at the head of the table. I had another bite of sausage.  \"James Arthur Nicholson! Look at me when I speak to you!\"  I looked up, reflexively, as I always did when she used my full name. My eyes slid over her face, then focused on a point over her left shoulder.  \"Yes'm.\"  \"You're going to school. Today. And I expect to get a good report from Mr Adelson.\"  \"Yes'm.\"  #  We have two schools in New Jerusalem: the elementary school that was built twenty years before, when they put in the wooden sidewalks and the town hall; and the non-denominational Academy that was built just before I left for 1975.  Miss Tannenbaum, a spinster lady with a moustache and a bristling German accent terrorised the little kids in the elementary school -- I'd been stuck in her class for five long years. Mr Adelson, who was raised in San Francisco and who had worked as a roustabout, a telegraph operator and a merchant seaman taught the Academy, and his wild stories were all Oly could talk about.  He raised one eyebrow quizzically when I came through the door at 8:00 that morning. He was tall, like my Pa, but Pa had been as big as an ox, and Mr Adelson was thin and wiry. He wore rumpled pants and a shirt with a wilted celluloid collar. He had a skinny little beard that made him look like a gentleman pirate, and used some shiny pomade to grease his hair straight back from his high forehead. I caught him reading, thumbing the hand-written pages of a leatherbound volume.  \"Mr Adelson?\"  \"Why, James Nicholson! What can I do for you, sonny?\" New Jerusalem only had but 2,000 citizens, and only a hundred or so in town proper, so of course he knew who I was, but it surprised me to hear him pronounce my name in his creaky, weatherbeaten voice.  \"My mother says I have to go to the Academy.\"  \"She does, hey? How do you feel about that?\"  I snuck a look at his face to see if he was putting me on, but I couldn't tell -- he'd raised up his other eyebrow now, and was looking hard at me. There might have been the beginning of a smile on his face, but it was hard to tell with the beard. \"I guess it don't matter how I feel.\"  \"Oh, I don't know about that. This is a school, not a prison, after all. How old are you?\"  \"Fourteen. Sir.\"  \"That would put you in with the seniors. Do you think you can handle their course of study? It's half-way through the semester now, and I don't know how much they taught you when you were over in,\" he swallowed, \"France.\"  I didn't know what to say to that, so I just stared at my hard, uncomfortable shoes.  \"How are your maths? Have you studied geometry? Basic algebra?\"  \"Yes, sir. They taught us all that.\" And lots more besides. I had the feeling of icebergs of knowledge floating in my brain, ready to crest the waves and crash against the walls of my skull.  \"Very good. We will be studying maths today in the seniors' class. We'll see how you do. Is that all right?\"  Again, I didn't know if he was really asking, so I just said, \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Marvelous. We'll see you at the 8:30 bell, then. And James --\" he paused, waited until I met his gaze. His eyebrows were at rest. \"I'm sorry about your father. I'd met him several times. He was a good man.\"  \"Thank you, sir,\" I said, unable to look away from his stare.  #  The first half of the day passed with incredible sloth, as I copied down problems to my slate and pretended to puzzle over them before writing down the answer I'd known the minute I saw the question.  At lunch I found a seat at the base of the big willow out front of the school and unwrapped the waxed paper from the thick ham sandwich Mama had fixed me. I munched it and conjugated Latin verbs in my head, trying to make the day pass. Oly and the fellows were roughhousing in the yard, playing follow-the-leader with Amos Gundersen out front, showing off by walking on his hands and then springing upright. Amos' mother came from circus people in Russia, and all the kids in his family wanted to be acrobats when they grew up.  I tried not to watch them.  I was engrossed in a caterpillar that was crawling up my pants-leg when Mr Adelson cleared his throat behind me. I started, and the caterpillar tumbled to the ground, and then Mr Adelson was squatting on his long haunches at my side.  \"How are you liking your first day, James?\" he asked, in his raspy voice.  \"It's fine, sir.\"  \"And the work? You're able to keep up with the class?\"  \"It's not a problem for me. We studied this when I was away.\"  \"Are you bored? Do you need more of a challenge?\"  \"It's fine, sir.\" _Unless you want to assign me some large-prime factoring problems_.  \"Right, then. Don't hesitate to call on me if things are moving too slowly or too quickly. I mean that.\"  I snuck another look at him. He seemed sincere.  \"Why aren't you playing with your chums?\"  \"I don't feel like it.\"  \"You just wanted to think?\"  \"I guess so.\" Why wouldn't he just leave me alone?  \"It's hard to come home, isn't it?\"  I stared at my shoes. What did he know about it?  \"I've been around the world, you know that? I sailed with a tramp steamer, the _Slippery Trick_. I saw the naked savages of Polynesia, and the voodoo witches that the freed slaves of the Caribbean worship, and the coolies pulling rickshaws in Peking. It was so _hard_ to come home to Frisco, after five years at sea.\"  To my surprise, he sat down next to me, in the dirt and roots at the base of the tree. \"You know, aboard the _Trick_, they called me Runnyguts -- I threw up every hour for my first month. I was more reliable than the Watch! But they didn't mean anything by it. When you live with a crew for years, you become a different person. We'd be out at sea, nothing but water as far as the eye could see, and we'd be playing cards on-deck. We'd told each other every joke we knew already, and every story about home, and we knew that deck of cards so well, which one had salt-water stains on the back and which one turned up at corner and which one had been torn, and we'd just scream at the sun, so bored! But then we'd put in to port at some foreign city, and we'd come down the plank in our best clothes, twenty men who knew each other better than brothers, hard and brown from months at sea, and it felt like whatever happened in that strange port-of-call, we'd come out on top.\"  \"And then I came back to the Frisco, and the Captain shook my hand and gave me a sack of gold and saw me off, and I'd never felt so alone, and I'd never seen a place so foreign.  \"I went back to my old haunts, the saloons where I'd gone for a beer after a day's work at the docks, and the dance-halls, and the theatres, and I saw my old chums. That was hard, James.\"  He stopped then. I found myself saying, \"How was it hard, Mr Adelson?\"  He looked surprised, like he'd forgotten that he was talking to me. \"Well, James, it's like this: when you're away that long, you get to invent yourself all over again. Of course, everyone invents themselves as they grow up. Your chums there --\" he gestured at the boys, who were now trying, with varying success, to turn somersaults, dirtying their school clothes \"-- they're inventing"]]]
