And such is ever the true order of rank which graces occupy in  reference to gifts. The most trifling act which is marked by  usefulness to others is nobler in God's sight, than the most brilliant  accomplishment of genius. To teach a few Sunday-school children, week  after week, commonplace simple truths--persevering in spite of  dullness and mean capacities--is a more glorious occupation than the  highest meditations or creations of genius which edify or instruct  only our own solitary soul.    II. The spiritual unity of the Church--\"the same Spirit.\"   Men have formed to themselves two ideas of unity: the first is a  sameness of form--of expression; the second an identity of spirit.  Some of the best of mankind have fondly hoped to realize an unity for  the Church of Christ which should be manifested by uniform expressions  in everything: their imaginations have loved to paint, as the ideal of  a Christian Church, a state in which the same liturgy should be used  throughout the world, the same ecclesiastical government, even the  same vestments, the same canonical hours, the same form of  architecture. They could conceive nothing more entirely one than a  Church so constituted that the same prayers, in the very same  expressions, at the very same moment, should be ascending to the  Eternal Ear.   There are others who have thrown aside entirely this idea as  chimerical; who have not only ceased to hope it, but even to wish it;  who if it could be realized, would consider it a matter of regret; who  feel that the minds of men are various--their modes and habits of  thought, their original capacities and acquired associations,  infinitely diverse; and who, perceiving that the law of the universal  system is manifoldness in unity, have ceased to expect any other  oneness for the Church of Christ than that of a sameness of spirit,  showing itself through diversities of gifts. Among these last was the  Apostle Paul: his large and glorious mind rejoiced in the  contemplation of the countless manifestations of spiritual nature  beneath which he detected one and the same pervading Mind. Now let us  look at this matter somewhat more closely.   1. All real unity is manifold. Feelings in themselves identical find  countless forms of expression: for instance, sorrow is the same  feeling throughout the human race; but the Oriental prostrates himself  upon the ground, throws dust upon his head, tears his garments, is not  ashamed to break out into the most violent lamentations. In the north,  we rule our grief in public; suffer not even a quiver to be seen upon  the lip or brow, and consider calmness as the appropriate expression  of manly grief. Nay, two sisters of different temperament will show  their grief diversely; one will love to dwell upon the theme of the  qualities of the departed, the other feels it a sacred sorrow, on  which the lips are sealed for ever; yet would it not be idle to ask  which of them has the truest affection? Are they not both in their own  way true? In the same East, men take off their sandals in devotion; we  exactly reverse the procedure, and uncover the head. The Oriental  prostrates himself in the dust before his sovereign; even before his  God the Briton only kneels; yet would it not again be idle to ask  which is the essential and proper form of reverence? Is not true  reverence in all cases modified by the individualities of temperament  and education? Should we not say, in all these forms worketh one and  the same spirit of reverence?   Again in the world as God has made it, one law shows itself under  diverse, even opposite manifestations; lead sinks in water, wood  floats upon the surface. In former times men assigned these different  results to different forces, laws, and gods. A knowledge of Nature has  demonstrated that they are expressions of one and the same law; and  the great difference between the educated and the uneducated man is  this--the uneducated sees in this world nothing but an infinite  collection of unconnected facts--a broken, distorted, and fragmentary  system, which his mind can by no means reduce to order. The educated  man, in proportion to his education, sees the number of laws  diminished--beholds in the manifold appearances of Nature the  expression of a few laws, by degrees fewer, till at last it becomes  possible to his conception that they are all reducible to one, and  that that which lies beneath the innumerable phenomena of Nature is  the One Spirit--God.   2. All _living_ unity is spiritual, not formal; not sameness, but  manifoldness. You may have a unity shown in identity of form; but it  is a lifeless unity. There is a sameness on the sea-beach--that unity  which the ocean waves have produced by curling and forcibly destroying  the angularities of individual form, so that every stone presents the  same monotony of aspect, and you must fracture each again in order to  distinguish whether you hold in your hand a mass of flint or fragment  of basalt. There is no life in unity such as this.   But as soon as you arrive at a unity that is living, the form becomes  more complex, and you search in vain for uniformity. In the parts, it  must be found, if found at all, in the sameness of the pervading life.  The illustration given by the apostle is that of the human body--a  higher unity, he says, by being composed of many members, than if  every member were but a repetition of a single type. It is conceivable  that God might have moulded such a form for human life; it is  conceivable that every cause, instead of producing in different nerves  a variety of sensations, should have affected every one in a mode  precisely similar; that instead of producing a sensation of sound--a  sensation of colour--a sensation of taste--the outward causes of  nature, be they what they may, should have given but one unvaried  feeling to every sense, and that the whole universe should have been  light or sound.   That would have been unity, if sameness be unity; but, says the  apostle, \"if the whole body were seeing, where were the hearing?\" That  uniformity would have been irreparable loss--the loss of every part  that was merged into the one. What is the body's unity? Is it not  this? The unity of a living consciousness which marvellously animates  every separate atom of the frame, and reduces each to the performance  of a function fitted to the welfare of the whole--its own, not  another's: so that the inner spirit can say of the remotest, and in  form most unlike, member, \"That too, is myself.\"   3. None but a spiritual unity can preserve the rights both of the  individual and the Church. All other systems of unity, except the  apostolic, either sacrifice the Church to the individual, or the  individual to the Church.   Some have claimed the right of private judgment in such a way that  every individual opinion becomes truth, and every utterance of private  conscience right: thus the Church is sacrificed to the individual; and  the universal conscience, the common faith, becomes as nothing; the  spirits of the prophets are not subject to the prophets. Again, there  are others, who, like the Church of Rome, would surrender the  conscience of each man to the conscience of the Church, and coerce the  particulars of faith into exact coincidence with a formal creed.  Spiritual unity saves the right of both in God's system. The Church  exists for the individual, just as truly as the individual for the  Church. The Church is then most perfect when all its powers converge,  and are concentrated on the formation and protection of individual  character; and the individual is then most complete--that is, most a  Christian--when he has practically learned that his life is not his  own, but owed to others--\"that no man liveth to himself, and no man  dieth to himself.\"   Now, spiritual unity respects the sanctity of the individual  conscience. How reverently the Apostle Paul considered its claims,  and how tenderly! When once it became a matter of conscience, this was  his principle laid down in matters of dispute: \"Let every man be fully  persuaded in his own mind.\" The belief of the whole world cannot make  that thing true to me which to me seems false. The conscience of the  whole world cannot make a thing right to me, if I in my heart believe  it wrong. You may coerce the conscience, you may control men's belief,  and you may produce a unity by so doing; but it is the unity of  pebbles on the sea-shore--a lifeless identity of outward form with no  cohesion between the parts--a dead sea-beach on which nothing grows,  and where the very seaweed dies.   Lastly, it respected the sanctity of individual character. Out of  eight hundred millions of the human race, a few features diversify  themselves into so many forms of countenance, that scarcely two could  be mistaken for each other. There are no two leaves on the same tree  alike; nor two sides of the same leaf, unless you cut and kill it  There is a sacredness in individuality of character; each one born  into this world is a fresh new soul intended by his Maker to develope  himself in a new fresh way; we are what we are; we cannot be truly  other than ourselves. We reach perfection not by copying, much less by  aiming at originality; but by consistently and steadily working out  the life which is common to us all, according to the character which  God has given us.   And thus will the Church of God be one at last--will present an unity  like that of heaven. There is one universe in which each separate star  differs from another in glory; one Church in which a single Spirit,  the Life of God, pervades each separate soul; and just in proportion  as that Life becomes exalted does it enable every one to shine forth  in the distinctness of his own separate individuality, like the stars  of heaven.      IV.   _Preached May 26, 1850._   THE TRINITY.      \"And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16645"],["title","Sermons Preached at Brighton (#8)"],["body"," pray God     your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto     the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.\"--1 Thess. v. 23.   The knowledge of God is the blessedness of man. To know God, and to be  known by Him--to love God, and to be loved by Him--is the most  precious treasure which this life has to give; properly speaking the  only treasure; properly speaking the only knowledge; for all  knowledge is valuable only so far as it converges towards and ends in  the knowledge of God, and enables us to acquaint ourselves with God,  and be at peace with Him. The doctrine of the Trinity is the sum of  all that knowledge which has as yet been gained by man. I say gained  _as yet_. For we presume not to maintain that in the ages which are to  come hereafter, our knowledge shall not be superseded by a higher  knowledge; we presume not to say that in a state of existence  future--yea even here upon this earth, at that period which is  mysteriously referred to in Scripture as \"the coming of the Son of  Man\"--there shall not be given to the soul an intellectual conception  of the Almighty, a vision of the Eternal, in comparison with whose  brightness and clearness our present knowledge of the Trinity shall be  as rudimentary and as childlike as the knowledge of the Jew was in  comparison with the knowledge of the Christian.   Now the passage which I have undertaken to expound to-day, is one in  which the doctrine of the Trinity is brought into connection  practically with the doctrine of our Humanity. Before entering into it  brethren, let us lay down these two observations and duties for  ourselves. In the first place, let us examine the doctrine of the  Trinity ever in the spirit of charity.   A clear statement of the deepest doctrine that man can know, and the  intellectual conception of that doctrine, are by no means easy. We are  puzzled and perplexed by _words_; we fight respecting _words_.  Quarrels are nearly always verbal quarrels. Words lose their meaning  in the course of time; nay, the very words of the Athanasian creed  which we read to-day mean not in this age, the same thing which they  meant in ages past. Therefore it is possible that men, externally  Trinitarians, may differ from each other though using the same words,  as greatly as a Unitarian differs from a Trinitarian. There may be  found in the same Church and in the same congregation, men holding all  possible shades of opinion, though agreeing externally, and in words.   I speak within the limit of my own experience when I say that persons  have been known and heard to express the language of bitter  condemnation respecting Unitarianism, who when examined and calmly  required to draw out verbally the meaning of their own conceptions,  have been proved to be holding all the time--unconsciously--the very  doctrine of Sabellianism. And this doctrine is condemned by the Church  as distinctly as that of Unitarianism. Therefore let us learn from all  this a large and catholic charity. There are in almost every  congregation, themselves not knowing it, Trinitarians who are  practically Tri-theists, worshipping three Gods; and Sabellians, or  worshippers of one person under three different manifestations. To  know God so that we may be said intellectually, to appreciate Him, is  blessed: to be unable to do so is a misfortune. Be content with your  own blessedness, in comparison with others' misfortunes. Do not give  to that misfortune the additional sting of illiberal and unchristian  vituperation.   The next observation we have to lay down for ourselves is, that we  should examine this doctrine in the spirit of modesty. There are those  who are inclined to sneer at the Trinitarian; those to whom the  doctrine appears merely a contradiction--a puzzle--an entangled,  labyrinthine enigma, in which there is no meaning whatever. But let  all such remember, that though the doctrine may appear to them absurd,  because they have not the proper conception of it, some of the  profoundest thinkers, and some of the holiest spirits among mankind,  have believed in this doctrine--have clung to it as a matter of life  or death. Let them be assured of this, that whether the doctrine be  true or false, it is not necessarily a doctrine self-contradictory.  Let them be assured of this, in all modesty, that such men never could  have held it unless there was latent in the doctrine a deep  truth,--perchance the truth of God.   We pass on now to the consideration of this verse under the following  divisions. In the first place, we shall view it as a triad in discord:  \"I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved  blameless;\" in the second place, as a Trinity in Unity: \"the God of  peace sanctify you wholly.\" We take then first of all for our  consideration the triad in discord: \"I pray God your whole body and  soul and spirit be preserved blameless.\"   The apostle here divides human nature into a three-fold division; and  here we have to observe again the difficulty often experienced in  understanding words. Thus words in the Athanasian creed have become  obsolete, or lost their meaning: so that in the present day the words  \"person,\" \"substance,\" \"procession,\" \"generation,\" to an ordinary  person, mean almost nothing. So this language of the apostle, when  rendered into English, shows no difference whatever between \"soul\" and  \"spirit.\" We say, for instance, that the soul of a man has departed  from him. We also say that the spirit of a man has departed from him.  There is no distinct difference between the two; but in the original  two very different kinds of thoughts--two very different modes of  conception--are represented by the two English words \"soul\" and  \"spirit.\"   It is our business, therefore, in the first place, to understand what  is meant by this threefold division. When the apostle speaks of the  body, what he means is the animal life--that which we share in common  with beasts, birds, and reptiles; for our life my Christian  brethren--our sensational existence--differs but little from that of  the lower animals. There is the same external form, the same material  in the blood-vessels, in the nerves, and in the muscular system. Nay,  more than that, our appetites and instincts are alike, our lower  pleasures like their lower pleasures, our lower pain like their lower  pain, our life is supported by the same means, and our animal  functions are almost indistinguishably the same.   But, once more, the apostle speaks of what he calls the \"soul.\" What  the apostle meant by what is translated \"soul,\" is the immortal part  of man--the immaterial as distinguished from the material: those  powers, in fact, which man has by nature--powers natural, which are  yet to survive the grave. There is a distinction made in scripture by  our Lord between these two things. \"Fear not,\" says He, \"them who can  kill the body; but rather fear Him who can destroy both body and  soul in hell.\"   We have again, to observe respecting this, that what the apostle  called the \"soul,\" is not simply distinguishable from the body, but  also from the spirit; and on that distinction I have already touched.  By the soul the apostle means our powers natural--the powers which we  have by nature. Herein is the soul distinguishable from the spirit. In  the Epistle to the Corinthians we read--\"But the natural man receiveth  not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness unto  him; neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.  But he that is spiritual judgeth all things.\" Observe, there is a  distinction drawn between the natural man and the spiritual. What is  there translated \"natural\" is derived from precisely the same word as  that which is here translated \"soul.\" So that we may read just as  correctly: \"The man under the dominion of the soul receiveth not the  things of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness unto him;  neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned. But  he that is spiritual judgeth all things.\" And again, the apostle, in  the same Epistle to the Corinthians, writes: \"That is not first which  is spiritual, but that which is natural:\" that is, the endowments of  the soul precede the endowments of the spirit. You have the same truth  in other places. The powers that belong to the Spirit were not the  first developed; but the powers which belong to the soul, that is the  powers of nature. Again in the same chapter, reference is made to the  natural and spiritual body. \"There is a natural body and there is a  spiritual body.\" Literally, there is a body governed by the soul--that  is, powers natural: and there is a body governed by the Spirit--that  is, higher nature.   Let then this be borne in mind, that what the apostle calls \"soul\" is  the same as that which he calls, in another place, the \"natural man.\"  These powers are divisible into two branches--the intellectual powers  and the moral sense. The intellectual powers man has by nature. Man  need not be regenerated in order to possess the power of reasoning, or  in order to invent. The intellectual powers belong to what the apostle  calls the \"soul.\" The moral sense distinguishes between right and  wrong. The apostle tells us, in the Epistle to the Romans, that the  heathen--manifestly natural men--had the \"work of the law written in  their hearts; their conscience also bearing witness.\"   The third division of which the apostle speaks, he calls the \"spirit;\"  and by the spirit he means that life in man which, in his natural  state, is in such an embryo condition, that it can scarcely be said to  exist at all--that which is called out into power and vitality by  regeneration--the perfection of the powers of human nature. And you  will observe, that it is not merely the instinctive life, nor the  intellectual life, nor the moral life, but it is principally our  nobler affections--that existence, that state of being, which we call  love. That is "]]]
