I have lived in this spot for twenty years; the little town of Akwar lies near, and there is hardly a person in it who has not been my patient. I am known even in Meerut and Delhi, and I can hardly believe the mutineers, for such they seem to be, will harm me or my friends.\"  \"You once told me,\" replied Mary, \"that when an appeal was made to the religion of this people they knew no such thing as fear or mercy.\"  \"And I told you the truth,\" said her father gravely.  \"But since we have weapons and plenty of ammunition, and know how to handle the firearms we shall not be led like lambs to the slaughter.\"  \"That is true enough,\" said Jack, \"but it will be of little avail, when our enemies are numbered by the hundred and perhaps the thousand.\"  \"I take it, then, that you favor an abandonment of our home?\"  \"I do, and with the least possible delay.\"  \"And you, my daughter, are you of the same mind?\"  \"I am,\" was the emphatic response.  \"Then my decision is that we shall start for the interior and stay there until it is safe to show ourselves again among these people, provided it ever shall be safe.\"  \"When shall you start?\"  The parent looked at the sky.  \"It is two or three hours to nightfall.  We will set out early to-morrow morning before the sun is high in the sky.\"  \"But will we not be more liable to discovery?\" asked Jack.  \"Not if we use care.  I am familiar with the country for miles in every direction.  We shall have to travel for the first two or three days through a thick jungle, and it is too dangerous work to undertake in the night-time.  This, you know, is the land of the cobra and the tiger, not to mention a few other animals and reptiles equally unpleasant in their nature.  Last night,\" continued the doctor, \"I saw a glare in the sky off to the westward on the opposite side of the river in the direction of Meerut.  I wonder what it meant?\"  \"By Jove!\" exclaimed Jack, \"that explains something that the palanquin bearer said to me about there being so many Inglese where there are none to-day.  I could not catch his meaning, though he mentioned Meerut.  But he gave me to understand that it was not quite time yet for the uprising, which would come in a few weeks.\"  \"Those things are apt to be precipitated.  I have no doubt that the mutineers burned the city last night.  If so, the main body will hurry to Delhi, which, being the ancient capital of the Mogul Empire, will become the new one.  Some of the rebels may take it into their heads to come in this direction.  What is the matter, Dr. Everson?\"     CHAPTER III.  YANKEE MARKSMANSHIP.  As Jack Everson was seated he faced the broad, sluggish Ganges, with the low, green banks beyond.  He was looking over the water, in the rays of the declining sun, when he saw something that caused him to rise hastily from his seat and peer earnestly across the river toward the opposite shore.  Observing his action, the doctor asked his question.  Both he and his daughter, rising to their feet, gazed in the same direction.  It was easy to see what had attracted the attention of their guest.  A party of horsemen, fully twenty, if not more, in number, had approached the river and were now halted on the other side, looking across in the direction of Dr. Marlowe's home, as if debating the question of making it a visit.  \"Let me get my glass,\" said Mary, starting toward the house, hardly a hundred feet distant.  \"Allow me to bring it,\" interrupted Jack.  \"It is on one of the chairs on the veranda, and I want my rifle.\"  Taking the glass from him on his return, the young woman levelled it at the group of horsemen on the other side.  \"I cannot make out who they are,\" she said, passing the glass to her father.  It took the parent but a few seconds to answer the question.  One sweeping glance told him.  \"They are Ghoojurs,\" he remarked, with as much calmness as he could assume.  \"And who are Ghoojurs?\" asked Jack Everson, less excited than his friends.  \"They belong to the nomadic tribes which originally occupied India, and are among the worst wretches in the world.  They are brigands and robbers, who are to be dreaded at all times.  Now, if the revolt has broken out, they will be as merciless as tigers.\"  \"It looks as if they intended to make us a visit, doctor?\"  \"Alas! there can be no earthly doubt of it.\"  \"Let us hurry into the jungle,\" said Mary, her face paling with fear. \"We have not a minute to waste.\"  \"The advice is good, but before acting on it I should like to make an experiment.\"  During this brief interval Jack Everson had carefully examined his rifle to assure himself that it was in good condition.  \"Heavens, man!\" exclaimed Dr. Marlowe, \"you are not going to try a shot at them?\"  \"That is my intention.\"  \"They are a mile distant!\"  \"One of my medals was won for hitting a target at exactly that distance,\" replied Jack, continuing his preparations.  \"It is impossible that you should succeed.\"  \"But not impossible that I should try, so please don't bother the man at the wheel.\"  \"They have ridden into the water,\" added the young woman, still nervous and excited.  \"Which will serve to shorten the distance somewhat.\"  \"Why not wait until they are halfway across; or, better still, not wait at all?\" inquired the doctor.  Jack Everson made no reply, but, lying down on his back, he slightly separated his raised knees, and, by crossing his ankles, made a rest for the barrel of his rifle.  The left arm was crooked under his head, so as to serve as a pillow or support, leaving the hand to steady the stock of his gun, while the right inclosed the trigger guard.  The horsemen, instead of riding side by side, were strung along in a line, with the leader several paces in advance and mounted on a rather large horse of a coal-black color.  Directly behind him came one upon a bay, while a little further back rode another on a white steed.  There could be no question that they were on their way to kill without mercy.  The situation was intensely trying to father and daughter.  The whole party of Ghoojurs had entered the Ganges and were steadily approaching. The water was so shallow that it could be seen as it splashed about the bodies of the riders, who were talking and laughing, as if in anticipation of the enjoyment awaiting them.  They preserved their single file, like so many American Indians in crossing a stream, and their last thought must have been of any possible danger that could threaten them from the three on the further bank.  The situation was becoming unbearable when the rifle cracked with a noise no louder than a Chinese cracker, and a faint puff of smoke curled upward from the muzzle of the weapon.  At the same moment the Ghoojur at the front, on his black horse, flung up his arms and tumbled sideways into the water, which splashed over his animal's head. Frightened, the horse reared, pawed the air, and, whirling about, galloped back to the bank, sending the water flying in showers from his hoofs.  \"Score me a bull's-eye!\" called Jack Everson, who in his pleasure over his success, could not wait for the result.  \"But see!\" cried Mary, \"you have only infuriated them.  Oh! father, how can we save ourselves?\"     CHAPTER IV.  FLIGHT.  The success of the first shot gave Jack Everson self-confidence and he took less time in aiming the second, which was as unerring as the first.  Another Ghoojur plunged off his horse and gave but a single struggle when he sank from sight in the shallow water.  \"Another bull's-eye!\" called Jack, proceeding to reload his piece.  \"I hope, doctor, you are keeping a correct score; I must have credit for all I do.\"  \"Now for my distinguished friend on the milk-white steed,\" said Jack, proceeding to adjust his telescopic sight to that individual.  \"If they will send over the three horses it will give us one apiece.\"  But the Ghoojurs had had enough of this fearful business.  They saw that some unaccountable fatality was at work and it was madness for them to remain.  With never a suspicion of the truth they wheeled their animals about and sent them galloping for the bank which they had left a short time before full of hope and anticipation.  \"I'm sorry for that,\" reflected Jack Everson, \"for it mixes things and I can't pick out my man, but here goes.\"  In one sense, his opportunity was better than before; for, while he could not select his particular target, he had but to aim at the bunch to make sure of hitting somebody, which is precisely what he did.  The Ghoojur whom he punctured did not fall, for the reason that two of his friends reached out and prevented him.  It was a piece of supererogation on their part, for when the party emerged from the Ganges upon dry land that fellow was of no further account.  Jack now showed more haste than before in reloading his weapon, fearing that the party would get beyond his reach before he could fire for the fourth time.  Much to his regret, they did so, for though he made the shot, it was necessarily so hurried that it inflicted no injury, and the whole party galloped out of sight over the slight swell without showing any further concern for their companions left behind.  Jack now rose to his feet with the question:  \"What is my record, doctor?\"  \"Three bull's-eyes; your score is perfect.\"  \"Hardly, for the last was a miss; however, three out of a possible four is pretty fair when the circumstances are considered.  I suspect that that particular party is not likely to give us further trouble.\"  \"No, they will not forget the lesson.\"  \"If we can induce our enemies to make their approach by the same ford and when the sun is shining this will become truly amusing.\"  \"But the Ghoojurs will not repeat that mistake.  This affair has served another purpose,\" added the physician, \"we must not delay our departure.\"  \"Do you advise our going while it is night?\"  \"I advised the contrary a little while ago,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16805"],["title","The Jungle Fugitives: A Tale of Life and Adventure in India (#2)"],["body"," I confess I am afraid to stay in the house, even for a few hours.  However, we will take our dinner there, gather a few belongings and then hurry off.  We shall find some spot where it will be safe to pass the night, and where we are not likely to be molested, because no one will know where to find us.\"  All glanced in the direction of the other shore, and seeing nothing to cause misgiving moved to the house, a low, roomy structure, though of moderate proportions, with a broad veranda extending along two sides. It was time for the evening meal, and there was some surprise felt that Mustad, the servant, had not summoned them before.  This surprise turned to astonishment and alarm when it was discovered that Mustad was not in the house.  No preparation had been made for dinner, and though his name was called several times in a loud voice, there was no response.  \"He has left us,\" said the doctor.  \"What does it mean?\" asked Mary.  \"It can have but one meaning: by some legerdemain, such as our own Indians show in telegraphing news from one mountain top to another, word has reached Mustad of what has taken place, and he has been called upon to join the faithful, and has been only too glad to do it.\"  \"I should think he would have attempted to do us harm before going.\"  \"He is too great a coward.\"  \"But his fanaticism will make him reckless.\"  \"When he gets among his friends then he will be among the worst.\"  \"But, father, he was always meek and gentle and respectful.\"  \"Those are the kind who become directly the opposite.\"  \"Do you think he would harm us?\"  \"I have no doubt of it,\" was the reply of the doctor.  \"I know the breed; I have twice been the means of saving his life through my medicines, and Mary nursed him for three weeks when he was suffering from a fever.\"  \"Yon may be doing him an injustice,\" ventured Jack Everson, to whom the judgment of his friend seemed bitter.  \"I wish I could think so, but, Mary, if you can provide us with something in the way of food, Mr. Everson and I will get the things together that we are to take with us.\"  Dr. Marlowe wisely decided not to burden themselves with unnecessary luggage.  Jack took from his trunk a few needed articles and stowed them into a travelling bag whose supporting strap could be flung over one shoulder.  Though a physician himself, admitted to practice, he had brought none of his instruments with him, for the good reason that he saw no sense in doing so.  Into the somewhat larger bag of the elder doctor were placed his most delicate instruments and several medical preparations, mostly the results of his experiments.  They were too precious to be lost if there was any way of preserving them.  Mary packed her articles in a small travelling bag, the strap of which she, too, flung over her shoulder, though Jack asked to be allowed to relieve her.  It was after the hurried meal had been eaten by lamplight that the three completed their preparations for departure.  That to which they paid the most attention was their means of defense.  Jack Everson had brought a plentiful supply of cartridges for his superb breechloader; and the belt was already secured around his body.  Dr. Marlowe never allowed his supply of ammunition to run low, so that the two were well supplied in that respect.  Jack was pleased to find that the revolver belonging to Mary Marlowe was of the same calibre as his own, so that the cartridges could be used indiscriminately.  \"I remember,\" he said to her, when the parent was just beyond hearing, \"that you were quite skillful with your weapon.\"  \"Not specially so, but what skill I gained is due to your tuition.\"  \"Not so much to that as to the aptness of the pupil.\"  \"Your remark is more gallant than true, but I hope I shall not be called upon to use this weapon as you used yours awhile ago.\"  \"Such is my prayer, but if the necessity arises do not hesitate.\"  \"Be assured I shall not,\" she replied, with a flash of her fine eyes and a compression of her lips.     CHAPTER V.  COMPANIONS IN FLIGHT.  Everything needed having been gathered, the lamps were extinguished, and with the physician in the lead, the three passed out of the front door to the veranda.  The doctor decided to leave the door unfastened, since it was useless to secure it.  Suddenly, when the doctor was about to give the word to move, he saw a shadowy figure in the direction of the river.  \"Sh!\" he whispered; \"it looks as if we had waited too long; some one is approaching.  Be ready to use your gun or to retreat into the house if necessary to fight it out there.\"  \"It is a white man,\" said the daughter in an undertone; \"he may be a patient.\"  It was clear by this time that the stranger was not a native, for he was dressed in civilized costume and his gait was that of a European. He did not perceive the silent figures until within a few paces of the veranda, when he paused abruptly, as if startled.  \"Good evening,\" he said in English.  \"Is this Dr. Marlowe?\"  \"It is; who are you?\"  \"My name is Anderson; I was looking for you.\"  \"In what way can I serve you?\"  \"You have heard the news, I suppose,\" said the man, keeping his position, and looking up to the three, who were now all on the edge of the veranda; \"the native soldiers at Meerut mutinied yesterday, killed most of their officers, plundered the city, slaying every white person they could find, after which most of them hurried to Delhi.\"  \"You bring dreadful tidings; I had heard nothing definite, but suspected all that you have told me.  Are you alone and why do you come to me?\"  \"I fled with my wife and two other families, Turner and Wharton, from the outskirts of Meerut as soon as there seemed a chance for us.  We made our way to the river, found a boat and paddled to this place, for we had no sail and there was scarcely any wind.\"  \"Where are your friends?\"  \"I left them by the edge of the river in the boat, promising to rejoin them in a few minutes.\"  \"Have you no companions, but those you named?\"  \"None; my wife and I buried two children last Summer; Mr. Turner has none, and Mr. Wharton and his young wife were but recently married.\"  \"You have not told me why you come to me?\"  \"Chiefly to warn you of your peril and to beseech you to fly before it is too late.\"  \"I thank you very much for your solicitude; it was kind on the part of you and your friends, but it strikes me that one place is about as safe as another.\"  \"We are so far from the large cities and the coast that it is useless to attempt to reach any of them.  Our first aim was to get as far from Meerut as possible; then as we found ourselves approaching your home, it seemed to us there was a chance for our lives by pushing to the northward, into the wilder and less settled country, where the flames of the insurrection may not reach.\"  \"Your sentiments are our own; you have been wonderfully fortunate in getting this far; my friends and I have seen enough to warn us to lose no time, and we were on the point of starting when I saw you.\"  \"May I ask what course you intend to take?\"  \"I have lived here for twenty years, so that I am acquainted with the section.  My intention was to follow a slightly travelled road, which, in fact, is little more than a bridle path, until several miles beyond Akwar, when we should come back to the main highway and keep to that for fifty or perhaps a hundred miles.  By that time, we should be safe, if such a thing as safety is possible.\"  \"Your plan is a good one, but is not mine better?\"  \"What is that?\"  \"I, too, am familiar with this part of the country; a stream empties into the Ganges just eastward of your house, hardly a half mile distant; it must have its source somewhere among the foothills of the Himalayas.  At any rate, it is navigable for all of a hundred miles. It seems to me that when paddling up that stream at night, between the wooded banks, there will be less chance of being discovered by enemies than when travelling overland, as you contemplate.\"  \"I am favorably impressed with your plan; do I understand you to invite us to join your party?\"  \"You are more than welcome; our boat will accommodate us all without crowding, but I regret to say we have but a single gun among us.  That is mine, which I left with my friends against my return.\"  \"We are well supplied in that respect; we accept your invitation with many thanks.\"  As the doctor spoke he stepped down from the veranda, followed by the others, and Mr. Anderson led the way across the lawn to the river, where his friends were awaiting his coming with many misgivings.  A general introduction followed.  A common danger makes friends of strangers, and in a few minutes all were as well acquainted as if they had known one another for days and weeks.  Anderson and Turner were men in middle life, while Wharton was of about the same age as Jack Everson.  They had lived for several years on the outskirts of Meerut, but it was young Wharton who discovered the impending peril, and it was due to him that the three families escaped the fate of hundreds of others on that woful night.  The young wife and Mary Marlowe became intimate friends at once, while, as has been said, there was a hearty, genuine comradeship immediately established among all.  The boat was larger than Dr. Marlowe and his companions suspected.  It was more than twenty feet in length, with a cabin at the stern, a place for a mast, though there was neither mast nor sail on board.  Anderson had spoken of paddling to this point, when, had he spoken correctly, he would have said that no paddles were used, but that the craft was propelled by means of poles.     CHAPTER VI.  ON THE GANGES.  While all the members of the party were cheered by hope, none forgot that a dreadful peril impended.  Enough time had passed since the revolt at Meerut for the news to spread even beyond the little town of Akwar, which was within a fourth of a mile of the home of Dr. Marlowe. He was aware that some of the most fanatical Mussulmans"]]]
