The Big Deeds       We are done with little thinking and we're done with little deeds,     We are done with petty conduct and we're done with narrow creeds;     We have grown to men and women, and we've noble work to do,     And to-day we are a people with a larger point of view.     In a big way we must labor, if our Flag shall always fly.     In a big way some must suffer, in a big way some must die.      There must be no little dreaming in the visions that we see,     There must be no selfish planning in the joys that are to be;     'We have set our faces eastwards to the rising of the sun     That shall light a better nation, and there's big work to be done.     And the petty souls and narrow, seeking only selfish gain,     Shall be vanquished by the toilers big enough to suffer pain.      It's a big task we have taken; 'tis for others we must fight.     We must see our duty clearly in a white and shining light;     We must quit our little circles where we've moved in little ways,     And work, as men and women, for the bigger, better days.     We must quit our selfish thinking and our narrow views and creeds.     And as people, big and splendid, we must do the bigger deeds.             The Wrist Watch Man       He is marching dusty highways and he's riding bitter trails,     His eyes are clear and shining and his muscles hard as nails.     He is wearing Yankee khaki and a healthy coat of tan,     And the chap that we are backing is the Wrist Watch Man.      He's no parlor dude, a-prancing, he's no puny pacifist,     And it's not for affectation there's a watch upon his wrist.     He's a fine two-fisted scrapper, he is pure American,     And the backbone of the nation is the Wrist Watch Man.      He is marching with a rifle, he is digging in a trench,     He is swapping English phrases with a poilu for his French;     You will find him in the navy doing anything he  can,     For at every post of duty is the Wrist Watch Man.      Oh, the time was that we chuckled at the soft and flabby chap     Who wore a little wrist watch that was fastened with a strap.     But the chuckles all have vanished, and with glory now we scan     The courage and the splendor of the Wrist Watch Man.      He is not the man we laughed at, not the one who won our jeers,     He's the man that we are proud of, he's the man that owns our cheers;     He's the finest of the finest, he's the bravest of the clan,     And I pray for God's protection for our Wrist Watch Man.            Follow the Flag       Aye, we will follow the Flag       Wherever she goes,     Into the tropic sun,       Into the northern snows;     Go where the guns ring out       Scattering steel and lead,     Painting the hills with blood,       Strewing the fields with dead.     But in each heart must be,       And back of each bitter gun,     Love for the best in life       After the fighting's done.      Aye, we will follow the Flag       Into benighted lands,     Brave in the faith for which,       Proudly, our banner stands.     Life for her life we'll pay,       Blood for her blood we'll give,     Fighting, but not to kill,       Save that the best shall live.     But, when the cannon's roar       Dies in a hymn of peace,     Justice and truth must reign,       Power of the brute must cease.      Aye, we will follow the Flag,       Gladly her work we'll do,     Banishing wrongs of old,       Founding the truth anew.     What though our guns must speak,       What though brave men must die,     Ages of truth to come       All this shall justify.     Men in the charms of peace,       Basking in Freedom's sun,     Some day shall bless our Flag       After our work is done.      Aye, we will follow the Flag       Wherever she goes,     Into the tropic sun,       Into the northern snows.     Fearlessly, on we'll go       Into the cruel strife,     Gladly the few shall die,       Winning for many, life.     Tyranny's wrongs must cease,       Brutes must no longer brag,     This is our work on earth,       So we will follow the Flag.             We've Had a Letter From the Boy       We've had a letter from the boy,     And oh, the gladness and the joy     It brought to us! We read it o'er     I'd say a dozen times or more.     We laughed until the teardrops fell     At all the fun he had to tell.     He's in the navy, wearing blue,     And everything is all so new     That he can see in youthful style     The funny things to make us smile.      He's working hard! Between the lines     We gather that. The brass he shines     Without complaining, and the food     He gets to eat is very crude.     And yet he laughs at all his chores.     He says the maid who scrubs our floors     Will have to quit when he returns     Unless a better way she learns.     \"I've got it on the fairer sex,\"     Says he, \"since I am swabbing decks.\"      \"A sailor's life, dear Mom,\" writes he,     \"Is not the life you picked for me.     And yet I'm getting fat and strong     And learning as I go along     That any life a man can find     Is apt to grow to be a grind     Unless a fellow has the wit     To see the brighter side of it.     Don't worry for your sailor son;     He sleeps well when his work is done.\"      We've had a letter from the boy,     And oh, the gladness and the joy     It brought to us! 'Twas good to know     That he is facing duty so.     Between the lines that he had penned     His mother's bitter fears to end,     I saw his manhood glowing bright,     And now I know his heart is right.     Behind the laughter I could see     My boy's the man I'd hoped he'd be.             Exempt       They have said you needn't go to the front to face the foe;       They have left you with jour women and your children safe at home;     They have spared you from the crash of the murderous guns that flash       And the horrors and the madness and the death across the foam.     But it's your fight, just the same, and your country still must claim       The splendor of your manhood and the best that you can do;     In a thousand different ways through the dark and troubled days,       You must stand behind the nation that has been so good to you.      You're exempt from shot and shell, from the havoc and the hell       That have robbed the world of gladness; you have missed the sterner fate     Of the brave young men and fine, that are falling into line,       You may stay among your children who are swinging on the gate.     But you're not exempt from love of the Flag that flies above,       You've a greater obligation to your country to be true;     You must work from day to day in a bigger, better way       For the glory of the nation that has been so good to you.      You are not exempt from trial, from long days of self-denial,       From devotion to your homeland and from courage in the test.     You are not exempt from giving to your country's needs and living       As a citizen and soldier--an example of the best.     You've a harder task before you than the boys who're fighting for you,       You must match their splendid courage and devotion through and through;     You must prove by fine endeavor, and by standing constant ever       That you're worthy of the country that has been so good to you.             Duty       We know not where the path may lead nor what the end may be,     The clouds are dark above us now, the future none can see,     And yet when all the storms have passed, and cannons cease to roar,     We shall be prouder of our flag than we have been before.      We could not longer idle stay, spectators of a wrong,     The weak were crying out for help against oppression strong;     And though we pray we may be spared the bitterness of strife,     'Twere better that we die than live the coward's feeble life.      We could not longer silent sit, our glory at an end,     And blind ourselves unto the wrongs committed by a friend;     We must be tolerant with all, yet in these days of hate,     Some things have happened that it would be shame to tolerate.      And now we stand before the world, erect and calm and grave,     And speak the words that decency must rule the land and wave;     Into the chaos of despair we fling ourselves to-day     As guardians of a precious trust hate must not sweep away.      We must rejoice, if we are men, not weak and soft of heart     That we have heeded duty's call, and taken up our part.     And when at last sweet peace shall come, and all the strife is o'er,     We shall be prouder of our flag than we have been before,             A Prayer       God grant to us the strength of men,       The patience of the brave;     The wisdom to be silent, when       The days with doubt are grave.     When dangers come, as come they must,       Throughout the trying hours     Let us continue still to trust       That triumph shall be ours.      We have foresworn our days of ease       To battle for the right,     To venture over troubled seas       Oppression's wrongs to fight.     And we have pledged ourselves to grief,       And bitter hurt and pain,     Then must we cling to this belief:       We suffer not in vain.      God grant to us the strength of men,       God help us to be true     Until that glorious morning when       The world shall smile anew.     We shall be tested sore and tried,       And flayed by many fears,     Yet let us in this faith abide,       That right shall rule the years.             Sympathy       One came to the house with a pretty speech:       \"It's all for the best,\" said he,     And I know that he sought my heart to reach,       And I know that he grieved with me.      But I was too full of my sorrow then       To list to his words or care;     Though I've tried I cannot recall again       The comfort he gave me there.      But another came, and his lips were dumb       As he grasped me by the hand,     And he stammered: \"Old man, I had to come,       Oh, I hope you'll understand."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16632"],["title","Over Here (#5)"],["body","\"      And ever since then I have felt his hand       Clasped tightly in my own,     And to-day his silence I understand--       My sorrowing he had known.             Hate       They say we must not hate, nor fight in hate.       I've thought it over many a solemn hour,     And cannot mildly view the man or state     That has no thought, save only to be great;     I cannot love the creature drunk with power.       I hate the hand that slaughters babes at sea,     I hate that will that orders wives to die.      And there is something rises up in me     When brutes run wild in crime and lechery       That soft adjustments will not satisfy.      Men seldom fight the things they do not hate;       A vice grows strong on mildly tempered scorn;     Rank thrives the weed the gardeners tolerate;     You cannot stroke the snake that lies in wait,       And change his nature with to-morrow's morn.     If roses are to bloom, the weeds must go;       Vice be dethroned if virtue is to reign;     Honor and shame together cannot grow,     Sin either conquers or we lay it low,       Wrong must be hated if the truth remain.      I hold that we must fight this war in hate--       In bitter hate of blood in fury spilled;     Of children, bending over book and slate,     Slaughtered to make a Prussian despot great;       In hate of mothers pitilessly killed.     In hate of liars plotting wars for gain;       In hate of crimes too black for printed page;     In hate of wrongs that mark the tyrant's reign--     And crush forever all within his train.       Such hate shall be the glory of our age.             General Pershing       He isn't long on speeches. At the banquet table, he     Could name a dozen places where he would much rather be.     He's not one for fuss and feathers or for marching in review,     But he's busy every minute when he's got a job to do.     And you'll find him in the open, fighting hard and fighting square     For the glory of his country when his boys get over there.      He has listened to the cheering of the splendid folks of France,     And he knows that he's the leader of America's advance,     And he knows his task is mighty and that words will not avail,     So he's standing to his duty, for he isn't there to fail.     And you'll find him cool and steady when the guns begin to flare,     And he'll talk in deeds of glory when his boys get over there.      He has gone to face the fury of the Prussian hordes that sweep     O'er the fertile fields of Freedom, where the forms of heroes sleep,     And it seems no time for talking or for laughter or for cheers,     With the wounded all about him and their moaning in his ears.     He is waiting for to-morrow, waiting there to do his share,     And he'll strike a blow for freedom when his boys get over there.             The Better Thing       It is better to die for the flag,       For its red and its white and its blue,     Than to hang back and shirk and to lag       And let the flag sink out of view.     It is better to give up this life     In the heat and the thick of the strife     Than to live out your days 'neath a sky,     Where Old Glory shall never more fly.      The peace that we long for will be       Far worse than the war that we dread     If never again we're to see       The blue, and the white and the red     Wind-tossed and sun-kissed in the skies.     If ever the Stars and Stripes dies     Or loses its lustre and pride,     We shall wish in our souls we had died.      It is better by far that we die       Than that flag shall pass out of the world;     If ever it ceases to fly,       If ever it's hauled down and furled,     Dishonor shall stamp us with shame     And freedom be naught but a name,     And the few years of dearly-bought breath     Will be filled with worse horrors than death.             To a Lady Knitting       Little woman, hourly sitting,     Something for a soldier knitting,     What in fancy can you see?     Many pictures come to me     Through the stitch that now you're making:     I behold a bullet breaking;     I can see some soldier lying     In that garment slowly dying,     And that very bit of thread     In your fingers, turns to red.     Gray to-day; perhaps to-morrow     Crimsoned by the blood of sorrow.      It may be some hero daring     Shall that very thing be wearing     When he ventures forth to give     Life that other men may live.     He may braver wield the saber     As a tribute to your labor,     And for that, which you have knitted,     Better for his task be fitted.     When the thread has left your finger,     Something of yourself may linger,     Something of your lovely beauty     May sustain him in his duty.      Some one's boy that was a baby     Soon shall wear it, and it may be     He will write and tell his mother     Of the kindness of another,     And her spirit shall caress you,     And her prayers at night shall bless you.     You may never know its story,     Cannot know the grief or glory     That are destined now and hover     Over him your wool shall cover,     Nor what spirit shall invade it     Once your gentle hands have made it.      Little woman, hourly sitting,     Something for a soldier knitting,     'Tis no common garb you're making,     These, no common pains you're taking.     Something lovely, holy, lingers     O'er the needles in your fingers     And with every stitch you're weaving     Something of yourself you're leaving.     From your gentle hands and tender     There may come a nation's splendor,     And from this, your simple duty,     Life may win a fairer beauty.             A Good Soldier       He writes to us most every day, and how his letters thrill us!     I can't describe the joys with which his quaint expressions fill us.     He says the military life is not of his selection,     He's only soldiering to-day to give the Flag protection.     But since he's in the army now and doing duties humble,     He'll do what all good soldiers must, and he will never grumble.      He's not so keen for standing guard, a lonely vigil keeping,     \"But when I must,\" he writes to us, \"they'll never find me sleeping!     I hear a lot of boys complain about the tasks they set us     And there's no doubt that mother's meals can beat the ones they get us,     But since I'm here to do my bit, close to the job I'm sticking;     I'll take whatever comes my way and waste no word in kicking.      \"I'd like to be a captain, dad, a major or a colonel,     I'd like to get my picture in some illustrated journal;     I don't exactly fancy jobs that now and then come my way,     Like picking bits of rubbish up that desecrate the highway.     But still I'll do those menial tasks as cheerfully as could one,     For while I am a private here I'm going to be a good one.      \"A soldier's life is not the way I'd choose to make my living,     But now I'm in the ranks to serve, my best to it I'm giving.     Oh, I could name a dozen jobs that I'd consider finer,     But since I've got this one to do I'll never be a whiner.     I'm just a private in the ranks, but take it from my letter,     They'll never fire your son for one who'll do his duty better.\"             His Santa Claus       He will not come to him this year with all his old-time joy,     An imitation Santa Claus must serve his little boy;     Last year he heard the reindeers paw the roof above his head,     And as he dreamed the kindly saint tip-toed about his bed,     But Christmas Eve he will not come by any happy chance;     This year his kindly Santa Claus must guard a trench in France.      His mother bravely tries to smile; last Christmas Eve was gay;     Last Christmas morn his daddy rose at dawn with him to play;     This year he'll hang his stocking by the chimney, but the hands     That filled it with the joys he craved now serve in foreign lands.     He is too young to understand his mother's troubled glance,     But he that was his Santa Claus is in a trench in France.      Somewhere in France this Christmas Eve a soldier brave will be,     And all that night in fancy he will trim a Christmas tree;     And all that night he'll live again the joys that once he had     When he was good St. Nicholas unto a certain lad.     And he will wonder if his boy, by any sad mischance,     Will find his stocking empty just because he serves in France.             Show the Flag       Show the flag and let it wave     As a symbol of the brave;     Let it float upon the breeze     As a sign for each who sees     That beneath it, where it rides,     Loyalty to-day abides.      Show the flag and signify     That it wasn't born to die;     Let its colors speak for you     That you still are standing true,     True in sight of God and man     To the work that flag began.      Show the flag that all may see     That you serve humanity.     Let it whisper to the breeze     That comes singing through the trees     That whatever storms descend     You'll be faithful to the end.      Show the flag and let it fly,     Cheering every passer-by--Men     that may have stepped aside,     May have lost their old-time pride,     May behold it there, and then     Consecrate themselves again.      Show the flag! The day is gone     When men blindly hurry on     Serving only gods of gold;     Now the spirit that was cold     Warms again to courage fine.     Show the flag and fall in line!             The Honor Roll       The boys upon the honor roll, God bless them all, I pray!     God watch them when they sleep at night, and guard them through the day.     We've stamped their names upon our walls, the list in glory grows,     Our brave boys and our splendid boys who stand to meet our foes.      Oh, here are sons of mothers fair and fathers fine and true,     The little ones of yesterday, the children that we knew;     We thought of them as youngsters gay, still laughing at their games,     And then we found the honor roll emblazoned with their names.
