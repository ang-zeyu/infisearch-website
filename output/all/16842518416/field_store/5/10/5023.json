Philip Doddridge, 1735.   100     Antioch. C.M.  _Jesus is God._     (195)  Jesus is God! the glorious bands   Of holy angels sing Songs of adoring praise to him,   Their Maker and their King.  2 He was true God in Bethlehem's crib,   On Calvary's cross, true God; He who, in heaven, eternal reigned,   In time, on earth abode.  3 Jesus is God! there never was   A time when he was not; Boundless, eternal, merciful,   The Word the Sire begot.  4 Backward our thoughts through ages stretch,   Onward through endless bliss; For there are two eternities,   And both alike are his.  5 Jesus is God! oh, could I now,   But compass land and sea, To teach and tell this single truth,   How happy should I be!  6 Oh, had I but an angel's voice,   I would proclaim so loud, Jesus, the Good, the Beautiful,   Is everlasting God.       Frederick Wm. Faber, 1862.   101     Herald Angels. 7s D.       (219)  Hark! the herald angels sing, \"Glory to the new-born King! Peace on earth, and mercy mild, God and sinners reconciled.\" Joyful all ye nations, rise; Join the triumph of the skies! With the angelic host proclaim, Christ is born in Bethlehem.  2 See, he lays his glory by, Born that man no more may die; Born to raise the sons of earth, Born to give them second birth. Veiled in flesh the Godhead see; Hail the incarnate Deity. Pleased as man with men to dwell, Jesus, our Immanuel.  3 Hail the heaven-born Prince of Peace! Hail the Sun of Righteousness; Light and life to all he brings, Risen with healing in his wings. Let us, then, with angels sing, \"Glory to the new-born King! Peace on earth, and mercy mild, God and sinners reconciled.\"       C. Wesley, 1759   102     Herald Angels. 7s D.  _Glory to God._     (204)  Angels rejoiced and sweetly sung   At our Redeemer's birth; Mortals! awake: let every tongue   Proclaim his matchless worth.  2 Glory to God, who dwells on high,   And sent his only Son To take a servant's form, and die,   For evils we had done!  3 Good-will to men; ye fallen race!   Arise, and shout for joy; He comes, with rich abounding grace   To save and not destroy.  4 Lord! send the gracious tidings forth,   And fill the world with light, That Jew and Gentile, through the earth,   May know thy saving might.       William Hurn, 1813.   1O3     Salvation Morning, 7s & 6s.  _God's Salvation Morning._  What means this glorious radiance   Across Judea's plain? Those white-winged angels singing   In such exultant strain?  Cho.--The King of glory cometh,       Earth's broken hearts to bind,       And God's salvation morning       Hath dawned for all mankind.  2 What means this wondrous story   The holy angels tell? Of one who reigned in heaven,   And now on earth would dwell?  3 Why bend these Eastern sages   To one of lowly birth? What means this heav'nly message   Of love and peace on earth?  4 Ye wand'rers in earth's darkness,   On ocean deep and land, Hail! hail! the joyful tidings,   The morning is at hand.       M. E. Servoss.   104     Invitation. C.M.  _The Forgiving One._     (232)  What grace, O Lord! and beauty shone   Around thy steps below! What patient love was seen in all   Thy life and death of woe!  2 Thy foes might hate, despise, revile,   Thy friends unfaithful prove; Unwearied in forgiveness still,   Thy heart could only love.  3 Oh, give us hearts to love like thee;   Like thee, O Lord! to grieve Far more for others' sins, than all   The wrongs that we receive.  4 One with thyself, may every eye,   In us, thy brethren, see That gentleness and grace that springs   From union, Lord, with thee.       Edward Denny, 1839.   105     Invitation.   C.M.  _The True Test._  We may not climb the heavenly steeps   To bring the Lord Christ down; In vain we search the lowest deeps,   For him no depths can drown.  2 But warm, sweet, tender, even yet   A present help is he; And faith has yet its Olivet,   And love its Galilee.  3 The healing of the seamless dress   Is by our beds of pain; We touch him in life's throng and press,   And we are whole again.  4 Through him the first fond prayers are said   Our lips of childhood frame; The last low whispers of our dead   Are burdened with his name.  5 O Lord and Master of us all,   Whate'er our name or sign, We own thy sway, we hear thy call,   We test our lives by thine!       J. G. Whittier.   106     Invitation. C.M.  _Childhood of Jesus._     (228)  In stature grows the heavenly Child,   With death before his eyes; A Lamb unblemished, meek and mild,   Prepared for sacrifice.  2 The Son of God his glory hides   With parents mean and poor; And he who made the heavens abides   In dwelling-place obscure.  3 Those mighty hands that stay the sky   No earthly toil refuse; And he who set the stars on high   A humble trade pursues.  4 He before whom the angels stand.   At whose behest they fly, Now yields himself to man's command,   And lays his glory by.  5 The Father's name we loudly raise,   The Son we all adore, The Holy Ghost, One God, we praise,   Both now and evermore.       Anon.   107     Invitation. C.M.  _A Man of Sorrow._     (229)  A pilgrim through this lonely world,   The blessed Savior passed; A mourner all his life was he,   A dying Lamb at last  2 That tender heart which felt for all,   For us its life-blood gave; It found on earth no resting-place.   Save only in the grave.  3 Such was our Lord; and shall we fear   The cross with all its scorn? Or love a faithless, evil world   That wreathed his brow with thorn?  4 No, facing all its frowns or smiles,   Like him obedient still, We homeward press, through storm or calm,   To Zion's blessed hill.       H. Bonar.   108     Olivet. L.M.  _The Meekness of Jesus._     (242)  How beauteous were the marks divine, That in thy meekness used to shine; That lit thy lonely pathway, trod In wondrous love, O Son of God!  2 Oh, who, like thee, so calm, so bright, Thou God of God, thou Light of Light! Oh, who, like thee, did ever go So patient through a world of woe?  3 Oh, who, like thee, so humbly bore The scorn, the scoffs of men before? So meek, forgiving, godlike, high, So glorious in humility?  4 E'en death, which sets the prisoner free, Was pang, and scoff, and scorn to thee; Yet love, through all thy torture glowed, And mercy with thy life-blood flowed.  5 Oh, in thy light, be mine to go, Illuming all my way of woe! And give me ever on the road To trace thy footsteps, Son of God!       Arthur Cleveland Coxe, 1838.   109     Olivet. L.M.  _The Teaching of Jesus._     (243)  How sweetly flowed the gospel's sound   From lips of gentleness and grace, When listening thousands gathered round,   And joy and reverence filled the place!  2 From heaven he came, of heaven he spoke;   To heaven he led his followers' way; Dark clouds of gloomy night he broke,   Unveiling an immortal day.  3 \"Come, wanderers, to my Father's home;   Come, all ye weary ones, and rest;\" Yes, sacred Teacher, we will come,   Obey thee, love thee, and be blest.       John Bowring, 1823.   110     Olivet. L.M.  _Christ's Example._     (239)  My dear Redeemer and my Lord, I read my duty in thy Word; But in thy life the law appears, Drawn out in living characters.  2 Such was thy truth, and such thy zeal, Such deference to thy Father's will, Such love and meekness so divine, I would transcribe and make them mine.  3 Cold mountains and the midnight air Witnessed the fervor of thy prayer; The desert thy temptations knew; Thy conflict and thy victory too.  4 Be thou my pattern, make me bear More of thy gracious image here; Then God, the Judge, shall own my name Among the followers of the Lamb.       Isaac Watts, 1709.   111     Overberg. L.M.  _The Miracles of Christ._     (247)  Behold! the blind their sight receive; Behold! the dead awake and live; The dumb speak wonders, and the lame Leap, like the hart, and bless his name.  2 Thus doth th' eternal Spirit own And seal the mission of the Son; The Father vindicates his cause, While he hangs bleeding on the cross.  3 He dies! the heavens in mourning stood; He rises, the triumphant God! Behold the Lord ascending high, No more to bleed, no more to die.  4 Hence, and forever, from my heart, I bid my doubts and fears depart; And to those hands my soul resign, Which bear credentials so divine.       Isaac Watts, 1709.   113     Overberg. L.M.  _Entry into Jerusalem._     (248)  Ride on! ride on in majesty! Hark! all the tribes Hosanna cry; O Savior meek, pursue thy road With palms and scattered garments strowed.  2 Bide on! ride on in majesty! In lowly pomp ride on to die; O Christ, thy triumphs now begin O'er captive death and conquered sin.  3 Ride on! ride on in majesty! The angel armies of the sky Look down with sad and wondering eyes To see the approaching sacrifice.  4 Ride on! ride on in majesty! The last and fiercest strife is nigh; The Father on his sapphire throne Awaits his own anointed Son.  5 Ride on! ride on in majesty! In lowly pomp, ride on to die; Bow thy meek head to mortal pain, Then take, O God, thy power and reign.       Henry Hart Milman, 1827.   113     Overberg. L.M.  _The Transfiguration._     (245)  Oh, wondrous type, oh, vision fair, Of glory that the church shall share, Which Christ upon the mountain shows, Where brighter than the sun he glows!  2 From age to age the tale declare, How with the three disciples there, Where Moses and Elias meet, The Lord holds converse high and sweet.  3 The law and prophets there have place, Two chosen witnesses of grace; The Father's voice from out the cloud Proclaimed his only Son aloud.  4 With shining face and bright array Christ deigns to manifest to-day, What glory shall be theirs above Who joy in God with perfect love.       Latin. Tr. by J.M. Neale, 1851.   114     Bavaria. 8s & 7s D.  _Christ Our Example._     (251)  Ever would I fain be reading,   In the ancient holy Book, Of my Savior's gentle pleading,   Truth in ev'ry word and look. How to all the sick"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16455"],["title","The Otterbein Hymnal (#8)"],["body","tearful   Help was ever gladly shown; How he sought the poor and fearful,   Called them brothers and his own.  2 How no contrite soul e'er sought him,   And was bidden to depart; How, with gentle words he taught him,   Took the death from out his heart. Still I read the ancient story,--   And my joy is ever new,-- How for us he left his glory,   How he still is kind and true.  3 How the flock he gently leadeth,   Whom his Father gave him here; How his arms he widely spreadeth,   To his heart to draw us near. Let me kneel, my Lord! before thee,   Let my heart in tears o'erflow, Melted by thy love adore thee,   Blessed in thee, mid joy or woe.       Ger., Louisa Hensel, 1829.      Tr., Catherine Winkworth, 1858   115     Heber. C.M.  _The Example of Christ._     (236)  Behold where, in the Friend of man,   Appears each grace divine! The virtues all in Jesus meet,   With mildest radiance shine.  2 To spread the rays of heavenly light,   To give the mourner joy, To preach glad tidings to the poor,   Was his divine employ.  3 In the last hour of deep distress,   Before his Father's throne, With soul resigned, he bowed, and said,   \"Thy will, not mine, be done!\"  4 Be Christ our pattern and our guide,   His image may we bear; Oh, may we tread his sacred steps,   And his bright glories share.       William Endfield, 1802.   116     Wonderful Love of Jesus. P.M.  _Christ's Love._  In vain in high and holy lays My soul her grateful voice would raise; For who can sing the worthy praise Of the wonderful love of Jesus?  Cho.--Wonderful love! wonderful love!         Wonderful love of Jesus!       Wonderful love! wonderful love!         Wonderful love of Jesus!  2 A joy by day, a peace by night, In storms a calm, in darkness light; In pain a balm, in weakness might, Is the wonderful love of Jesus.  3 My hope for pardon when I call, My trust for lifting when I fall; In life, in death, my all in all, Is the wonderful love of Jesus.       E.S. Lorenz.   117     Olive's Brow. L.M.  _Christ in Gethsemane._     (253)  'Tis midnight; and on Olive's brow   The star is dimmed that lately shone; 'Tis midnight; in the garden, now,   The suffering Savior prays alone.  2 'Tis midnight; and, from all removed,   The Savior wrestles lone with fears; E'en that disciple whom he loved   Heeds not his Master's grief and tears.  3 'Tis midnight; and for others' guilt   The man of sorrows weeps in blood; Yet he that hath in anguish knelt   Is not forsaken by his God.  4 'Tis midnight; and from ether plains   Is borne the song that angels know; Unheard by mortals are the strains   That sweetly soothe the Savior's woe.       W.B. Tappan, 1822.   118     Windham. L.M.  _\"Why Hast Thou Forsaken Me?\"_     (256)  From Calvary a cry was heard--   A bitter and heart-rending cry; My Savior! ev'ry mournful word   Bespoke thy soul's deep agony  2 A horror of great darkness fell   On thee, thou spotless holy One! And all the eager hosts of hell   Conspired to tempt God's only Son.  3 The scourge, the thorns, the deep disgrace,   These thou could'st bear, nor once repine; But when Jehovah veiled his face,   Unutterable pangs were thine.  4 Let the dumb world its silence break;   Let pealing anthems rend the sky; Awake, my sluggish soul, awake!   He died that we might never die.       John W. Cunningham, 1820.   119     Zephyr. L.M.  _Consecration in View of the Cross._     (261)  When I survey the wondrous cross, On which the Prince of Glory died, My richest gain I count but loss, And pour contempt on all my pride.  2 Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast, Save in the death of Christ, my God; All the vain things that charm me most, I sacrifice them to his blood.  3 See, from his head, his hands, his feet Sorrow and love flow mingled down; Did e'er such love and sorrow meet, Or thorns compose so rich a crown?  4 Were all the realms of nature mine, That were a present far too small; Love so amazing, so divine. Demands my soul, my life, my all.       Isaac Watts, 1707.   120     Miriam, 7s & 6s. Double.       (300)  O sacred head, now wounded! With grief and shame weighed down, Now scornfully surrounded With thorns, thine only crown; O sacred head, what glory, What bliss, till now, was thine! Yet tho' despised and gory, I joy to call thee mine.  2 What thou, my Lord! hast suffered Was all for sinners' gain; Mine, mine was the transgression, But thine the deadly pain; Lo! here I fall, my Savior! 'Tis I deserve thy place; Look on me with thy favor; Vouchsafe to me thy grace.  3 The joy can ne'er be spoken, Above all joys beside, When in thy body broken, I thus with safety hide; My Lord of life! desiring Thy glory now to see, Beside thy cross expiring, I'd breathe my soul to thee.       Paul Gerhardt, 1659.   121     Avon. C.M.  _Before the Cross._     (281)  Alas! and did my Savior bleed?   And did my Sovereign die? Would he devote that sacred head   For such a worm as I?  2 Was it for crimes that I have done   He groaned upon the tree? Amazing pity! grace unknown!   And love beyond degree!  3 Well might the sun in darkness hide,   And shut his glories in, When Christ, the mighty Maker, died   For man, the creature's sin!  4 Thus might I hide my blushing face   While his dear cross appears; Dissolve my heart in thankfulness,   And melt mine eyes to tears.  5 But drops of grief can ne'er repay   The debt of love I owe; Here, Lord, I give myself away;   'Tis all that I can do.       Isaac Watts, 1709.  Cho.--Jesus died for you,       And Jesus died for me,       Yes, Jesus died for all mankind;       Bless God, salvation's free.  Cho.--Help me, dear Savior, thee to own,         And ever faithful be;       And when thou sittest on thy throne.         O Lord, remember me.   122     Avon. C.M.  _Jesus Died for Me._  Great God, when I approach thy throne   And all thy glory see; This is my stay, and this alone,   That Jesus died for me.  2 How can a soul condemned to die,   Escape the just decree? Helpless and full of sin am I,   But Jesus died for me.  3 Burdened with sin's oppressive chain,   Oh, how can I get free? No peace can all my efforts gain,   But Jesus died for me.  4 And, Lord, when I behold thy face,   This must be all my plea; Save me by thy almighty grace,   For Jesus died for me.       W.B. Bathurst, d. 1877.   123     Cowper. C.M.  _Contrition at the Cross._     (283)  O Jesus! sweet the tears I shed,   While at thy cross I kneel, Gaze on thy wounded, fainting head,   And all thy sorrows feel.  2 My heart dissolves to see thee bleed,   This heart so hard before; I hear thee for the guilty plead,   And grief o'erflows the more.  3 'Twas for the sinful thou didst die,   And I a sinner stand; What love speaks from thy dying eye,   And from each pierced hand!  4 I know this cleansing blood of thine   Was shed, dear Lord, for me; For me, for all--oh, grace divine!--   Who look by faith on thee.       Ray Palmer, 1867.   124     Cowper. C.M.  _Resting Beneath the Cross._     (277)  Oppressed with noon-day's scorching heat,   To yonder cross I flee; Beneath its shelter take my seat:   No shade like this for me!  2 Beneath that cross clear waters burst,   A fountain sparkling free; And there I quench my desert thirst:   No spring like this for me!  3 A stranger here, I pitch my tent   Beneath this spreading tree; Here shall my pilgrim life be spent:   No home like this for me!  4 For burdened ones a resting-place   Beside that cross I see; Here I cast off my weariness:   No rest like this for me!       H. Bonar, 1857.   125     The Cross. C.M.  _The Precious Love._     (530)  The cross, the cross, the blood-stained cross!   The hallowed cross I see; Reminding me of precious blood   That once was shed for me.  Cho.--Oh, the blood, the precious blood,         That Jesus shed for me;       Upon the cross, in crimson flood,         Just now by faith I see.  2 The cross, the cross, that heavy cross,   My Savior bore for me; It bowed him to the earth with grief   On sad Mount Calvary  3 The wounds, the wounds, those painful wounds;   Oh, they were made for me! His hands and feet, his holy head,   All pierced and torn I see.  4 The death, the death, the awful death!   That Jesus died for me; I heard his groans, his prayer, \"Forgive,\"   His bleeding side I see.  5 The love, the love, the matchless love,   That bled upon the tree! It melts my heart, it wins my love,   It brings me, Lord, to thee.       J.H. Stockton.   126     Gorton. S.M.  _Our Ransom Paid._     (296)  Our sins on Christ were laid;   He bore the mighty load; Our ransom price he fully paid   In groans, and tears, and blood.  2 To save a world he dies;   Sinners, behold the Lamb! To him lift up your longing eyes;   Seek mercy in his name.  3 Pardon and peace abound;   He will your sins forgive; Salvation in his name is found,--   He bids the sinner live.  4 Jesus, we look to thee;--   Where else can sinners go? Thy boundless love shall set us free   From wretchedness and woe.       J. Fawcett, 1760.   127     Gorton. S.M.  _For Me He Died._     (300)  Are there no wounds for me?   Hast thou received them all? How can I, Lord, the anguish see,   Beneath which thou didst fall?  2 'Tis over now, I know,--   That suffering life of thine; Thy precious blood has ceased to flow,   Thou wear'st thy crown divine;  3 But yet, I weeping see   The thorns which pierced thy head; Thou faint'st beneath thy cross for me,   For me to death thou'rt led!  4 Meekly, with love divine,   Thy holy head is bent, And streams of blood, for sins of mine,   Flow where thy side is rent.  5 Beneath this sacred flood   I bow my sinful soul; Dear Savior, let thy precious blood   Wash me and make me whole.       Mrs. Grace Webster Hinsdale, 1868.   128     Owen. S.M.  _The Savior's Tears._     (298)  Did Christ o'er sinners weep,   And shall our cheeks be dry? Let floods of penitential grief   Burst forth from every eye.  2 The Son of God in tears--   The wondering angels see! Be thou astonished, O my soul!   He shed those tears for "]]]
