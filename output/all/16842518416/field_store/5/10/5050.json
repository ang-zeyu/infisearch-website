The first real surprise of the girl came when she reached the bridge. This proved that she was more than four miles from home, a distance much greater than she had suspected.  \"Where can Nick be?\" she asked herself, never once thinking that they might have missed each other when she was swinging in the tree-top. It struck her that the day was nearly gone, for she noticed the gathering twilight diffusing itself through the forest.  \"I don't think I will go any farther,\" she said; \"Nick will be along pretty soon, and I'll wait here for him.\"  Standing on the bridge and looking down the road and listening for the sound of the carriage wheels were tiresome to one of Nellie's active habits, and it was not long before she broke off some of the bread, set down her lunch basket, and then dropped some crumbs into the water.  As they struck the surface, sending out little rings toward the shore, several tiny fish came up after the food. Nellie laughed outright, and, in her eagerness, was careless of how she threw the crumbs, most of which fell upon the bank.  It occurred to her that she could do better by going down to the edge of the stream, where she would not mistake her aim.  Childlike, she did not pause to think of the wrong of so doing, for she ought to have known that her parents never would have consented to such an act.  Just there, Nellie, like many another little girl, made a great mistake.     CHAPTER X.  IN GREAT DANGER.   A little child is like a butterfly, thinking only of the pleasures of the moment. Nellie Ribsam came down close to the edge of the creek and threw some crumbs out upon the surface. In the clear water she could see the shadowy figures of the minnows, as they glided upward and snapped at the morsels.  She became so interested in the sport that she kept walking down the bank of the stream, flinging out the crumbs until there was none left in her hand; then she debated whether she should go back after her lunch basket or wait where she was until Nick appeared on the bridge.  \"It's a bother to carry the basket with me,\" she said to herself; \"I had to leave it on the ground when I was after grapes, so I'll wait till Nick comes, and then I'll call to him. Won't he be scared when he sees me down here!\"  From where she stood, she observed the bridge above her head, and consequently Nick could look directly down upon her whenever he should reach the structure.  Nellie felt that she would like to go on down the creek to the big pond into which it emptied; but she knew better than to do that, for she would be certain to miss her big brother, and it was already beginning to grow dark around her.  \"I wonder what makes Nick so long,\" she said to herself, as she sat down on a fallen tree; \"I'm so tired that I never can walk the four miles home.\"  She had sat thus only a brief while, when her head began to droop; her bright eyes grew dull, then closed, and leaning against a limb which put out from the fallen tree, on which she was sitting, she sank into the sweet, dreamless sleep of childhood and health.  Had she not been disturbed she would not have wakened until the sun rose, but at the end of an hour, an involuntary movement of the head caused it to slip off the limb against which it was resting with such a shock that instantly she was as wide awake as though it was mid-day.  Ah, but when she sprang to her feet and stared about her in the gloom she was dreadfully alarmed!  She was quick-witted enough to understand where she was and how it had all come about. The gibbous moon was directly overhead, and shone down upon her with unobstructed fullness.  \"Nick has gone over the bridge while I was asleep,\" was her instant conclusion; \"and father and mother will be worried about me.\"  Her decision as to what she should do could not but be the one thing--that was to climb back up the bank to the bridge, cross it, and hurry homeward.  There was a little throbbing of the heart, when she reflected that she had several miles to travel, most of which was through the gloomy woods; but there was no hesitation on the part of Nellie, who, but for the sturdy teaching of her parents, would have crouched down beside the log and sobbed in terror until she sank into slumber through sheer exhaustion.  \"I have been a bad girl,\" she said to herself, as she reflected on her thoughtlessness; \"and mother will whip me, for I know she ought to; and mother always does what she ought to do.\"  There was no room for doubt in the mind of the child, for she understood the nature of her parents as well as any child could understand that of its guardian.  Nellie was some distance below the point where the bridge spanned the creek, but she could see the dim outlines of the structure as she started toward it. It seemed higher than usual, but that was because the circumstances were different from any in which she had ever been placed.  The little one was making her way as best she could along the stream in the direction of the bridge, when she was frightened almost out of her senses by hearing a loud, sniffing growl from some point just ahead of her.  It was a sound that would have startled the bravest man, and Nellie was transfixed for the moment. She did not turn and run, nor did she sink in a swoon to the ground, but she stood just where she had stopped, until she could find out what it meant.  She was not kept long in waiting, for in less than a minute the noise was repeated, and at the same moment she caught the outlines of a huge black bear swinging along toward her. He was coming down the bed of the creek, with his awkward, ponderous tread, and when seen by Nellie was within fifty feet of her.  When it is remembered that he was of unusual size and proceeding straight toward the child, it seems impossible that she should have done anything at all to help herself. The sight was enough to deprive her of the power of motion and speech.  But it was in such a crisis as this that little Nellie Ribsam showed that she had not forgotten the teaching of her parents: \"God helps them that help themselves.\"  With scarcely a second's pause, she whirled on her heel and dashed down the stream with the utmost speed at her command.  The bear could not have failed to see her, though it is not to be supposed that he was looking for the little girl when he first came that way. Furthermore, had the chase lasted several minutes Nellie must have fallen a victim to the savage animal.  It required no instruction to teach her that there was but one way in which she could escape, and that was by climbing a tree. Had there been a large one near at hand she would have ascended that as quickly as possible; but, fortunately, the first one to which she fled was a sapling, no larger than those she had climbed during the afternoon, and no one could have clambered to the highest point attainable quicker than did the frightened little girl.  Had she been a veteran hunter, Nellie could not have made a better selection, for she was fully twenty feet from the ground, and as much beyond the reach of the bear as though she were in her trundle-bed at home.  But the position was a frightful one to her, and for several minutes she believed the animal would tear the tree down and destroy her.  \"I have done all I can for myself,\" she murmured, recalling the instruction of her parents, \"and now God will do the rest.\"  Beautiful, trusting faith of childhood! Of such, indeed, is the kingdom of heaven.  The huge bear, which from some cause or other had ventured from the recesses of the wood, was but a short distance behind the little wanderer when she climbed so hastily beyond his reach. He acted as though he was somewhat bewildered by the unusual scene of a small child fleeing from him, but nothing is so tempting to pursuit as the sight of some one running from us, and the brute galloped after Nellie with an evident determination to capture her, if the thing could be done.  When he found the child had eluded him for the time, he sat down on his haunches and looked upward, as though he intended to wait till she would be compelled to descend and surrender herself.  The small tree in which Nellie had taken refuge was several yards from the edge of the stream, the bank sloping so steeply that the water never reached the base, excepting during a freshet.  It was a chestnut, whose smooth bark rendered it all the more difficult to climb, but Nellie went up it as rapidly as a man ascends telegraph poles with the spikes strapped to his boots.  The bear clawed the bark a little while, as a cat is sometimes seen to do when \"stretching\" herself, and it was during these few minutes that the girl thought nothing could save her from falling into his clutches.  When he ceased, she peered downward through the branches, and could just see the massy animal near the base of the tree, as if asking himself what was the next best thing to do.  It will be admitted that the situation of Nellie Ribsam was one in which few children of her tender years are ever placed. Happy it is, indeed, that it is so, for what one in a thousand would have retained her self-possession?  In explanation, it may be doubted indeed whether Nellie fully comprehended her peril. Had she been older, her consternation, doubtless, would have been greater, as the emotion she showed some years later, when placed in great danger, would seem to prove.  But there was one fact of which she was firmly convinced: she had complied with her father's instructions, for, as has been shown, she put forth every possible exertion to save herself, and now she called on Heaven to assist her.  Perched in the top of the tree, with the enormous bear sitting beneath and looking hungrily upward, she prayed:  \"Heavenly Father, please take care of me and don't let that big bear catch me; don't"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16472"],["title","Through Forest and Fire (#8)"],["body"," papa and mamma feel too bad, and please make the bad bear go away and let me alone.\"     CHAPTER XI.  \"GOTT SEI DANK!\"   The prayer of little Nellie Ribsam--so far as it related to herself--was answered.  She secured her seat, as best she could, in the branches of the chestnut sapling, and, by arranging her dress and the yielding limbs with considerable skill, she made herself quite comfortable.  The trying situation in which she was placed, it would be thought, was enough to drive away all disposition to sleep, but at the end of less than half an hour the little head was nodding again, and, forgetful of her peril, her senses soon left her.  It will be understood that the danger of the young wanderer was rendered all the greater by this loss of consciousness, for her muscles would relax in slumber, and, unless her position was unusually secure, she was certain to fall.  But that gracious Father in whom she so implicitly trusted watched over the little one, and she remained as though seated in the broad rocking-chair at home.  When at last she moved slightly and was on the point of losing her balance, she awoke so quickly that she saved herself just in the nick of time.  She was shocked and startled, but regaining her breath she held fast with one hand while she parted the branches with the other and carefully peered down among the limbs.  \"He is gone!\" was her joyous exclamation; \"I knew the Lord would make him go away, because I asked him to.\"  She was right: the bear had vanished, and all danger from that source for the time had passed.  The brute probably found enough to eat without waiting for little girls to fall into his clutches. As he had never been known to trouble any one in the neighborhood, it was reasonable to believe that he got all he wanted without venturing away from the depths of the woods, and rousing an ill-will against himself that would speedily result in his destruction.  Nellie did not feel surprised at all, for, as I have shown, she had the faith to believe that her prayer would be answered.  \"Now I will go down to the ground and start for home. I guess the bear isn't far off, but the Lord will not let him hurt me.\"  She carefully descended the tree and stood on the ground a minute later. She found that her dress was torn and she had lost part of the ribbon from her hat. This troubled her more than anything else, for her frugal mother had told her many a time that she must take the best care of her clothing.  \"I was so scared that I forgot to look out,\" she said to herself, after taking an inventory of the damages; \"but I guess mother will excuse me for losing the ribbon, though I know she won't for coming so far into the woods without permission.\"  She now set out resolutely for the bridge, determined to lose no more time in reaching home. As is the rule, the brief space she had passed in sleep seemed three times as long as was actually the case, and she thought it must be near morning.  She had gone but a short distance when she stopped with another shock of affright.  \"My gracious! what can that be?\"  A point of light appeared between her and the bridge, flickering about like an _ignis-fatuus_ or jack-o'-lantern. Nellie felt like taking to the tree again, but she bravely stood her ground until she could satisfy her curiosity as to its nature.  Watching it closely she observed shadowy figures flitting around the light in a curious and grotesque way. She was in greater doubt than ever, when she heard voices.  \"I think I saw her tracks, but I couldn't be sure; Nellie knows too much to walk or fall into the deep water.\"  \"I hope so, but my heart misgives me sorely. God be merciful, for if she is lost I can never recover!\"  The first speaker was Nick Ribsam, and the second was the father, the mother immediately adding:  \"Why the poor child came here is more than I can understand, but He doeth all things well.\"  _\"Oh, mother! Oh, father! Oh, Nick! It is I, Nellie! I am so glad to see you!\"_  And the little wanderer flew like the wind along the bank of the creek. The mother was the first to recognize the voice, and rushing forward she caught her child in her arms, murmuring in her own language:  \"Mein Kind! Mein Kind! Gott sei Dank!\" (My child! My child! God be thanked!)  \"Mein lieber Nellie! Komm an mein Herz! Kannst du es sein?\" (My dear Nellie! Come to my heart! Can it be you?) exclaimed the overjoyed father.  \"O meine abtrünnige Schwester! Wie du uns erschreckt hast! Wie es mich freut dich zu finden!\" (Oh, my truant sister! What a scare you have given us! How glad I am to find you!) shouted Nick.  And the child that was lost and was found was hugged first by mother, then by father, and then by Nick, and then all strove to get hold of her at the same time, till the brother ceased, through fear that she would be torn apart.  Nellie was laughing and crying, and wondering why it was such commotion was caused by her return to her folks.  Mr. Layton and Kilgore heard the tumult, and knew what it meant. A few minutes brought them to the spot, and, though their greeting was less demonstrative, their eyes filled with tears over the exceeding joy of the reunited family.  When the excitement had subsided somewhat, the group listened to the story of Nellie. She told it in her childish, straightforward manner, and it was all the more impressive on that account.  The listeners were greatly touched; but the probability that a large bear was in the neighborhood hastened their footsteps and they lost no time in hurrying away.  When they reached the highway above, crossed the bridge, and had gone some distance on their way home, they began to feel there was nothing to be feared from the animal. Mr. Layton referred to the tracks of the beast which they had noticed when hunting for Nellie, but said he would never have mentioned it until the fate of the girl became known; for the suggestions which must have followed were too dreadful.  Nothing was seen of the animal, however, and, as the distance from the bridge was increased the party finally gave up all thought and conversation respecting it.  There was a grateful household that night, when, at a late hour, they gathered about the family altar and the head returned thanks to Him who had been so merciful to them and theirs.  The happy mother held the daughter in her arms all night, while they both slept; and when the parent awoke, now and then, through the darkness, she shuddered, pressed the little one closer to her and kissed the chubby cheek, on which her former tears had not yet dried.  But Katrina Ribsam was none the less an affectionate mother when, several days later, she called Nellie to her knee and told her how wrongly she had acted in venturing on such a dangerous tramp without asking permission from her parents.  Nellie said she knew it, and wondered why it was her mother delayed the punishment so long. She was ready, and loved and respected her mother the more for administering it.  But truth compels me to say that the chastisement was given with such a gentle hand that it was hardly worth the name, and the mother herself suffered far more than did the child, who to this day is not conscious that she received anything like physical pain.     CHAPTER XII.  OMINOUS PREPARATIONS.   Happily there are few little girls in this favored land who are called upon to go through such trials as fell to the lot of little Nellie Ribsam when she was but eight years old.  It created much talk in the neighborhood, and she was complimented on the bravery she had shown, while the glad father became more confirmed than ever in his favorite belief that God helps them that help themselves.  \"'Spose dot she didn't try to helps herself some,\" he said, in talking the matter over with Mr. Marston, \"don't you not sees dot she would get eat up doo, dree times by dot bear dot vos bigger as nefer vos?\"  \"It is a good thing for one, even though he be a child, to be able to do his utmost when overtaken by danger--there can be no question about _that_; but it would require a great deal of training to bring some children to that point, even when they are double the years of your little girl.\"  \"Dot's becos dere folks don't not begins right; we starts mit Nick and Nellie when dey was so small dot dey didn't know nuffin, which is why it happens dey knows so much now.\"  Great as was the interest excited by the adventure of Nellie, it was not long before it was thrown in the shade by another fact which was brought to light by that same experience: that was the existence of a large bear in the woods which lay to the east and west of the road leading to Dunbarton.  This forest, as has already been intimated, covered a large tract of country, in which, a few years previous, bears, deer, and wolves had been hunted by many of those dwelling on the outskirts. Large inroads had been made on the woodland, and here and there the cabin of a settler or squatter was found by those who penetrated any distance.  There were clearings extending over several acres, while, again, a man might wander for hours without emerging from the timber, which included the common varieties found in the Middle States--oak, beech, maple, birch, hickory, hemlock, black walnut, American poplar or whitewood, gum, elm, persimmon, and others less important.  The pine resembled the famous white pine of the Allegheny mountains, and predominated. Where there was such a large area covered with timber, about every variety of surface was known. In some places were rocks, ravines, hollows, and gulches; in others there were marshy swamps through which a hunter would find it hard work to force his way.  Shark Creek entered from the east and was of considerable volume. In many places it was deep, while elsewhere it widened into broad and shallow expansions. It wound its way through the woods in the sinuous course always taken by such streams, and, crossing the road, where it was spanned by a bridge, it continued onward a"]]]
