But toward the north beyond the Want-way King Peter was lord over a good stretch of land, and that of the best; yet was he never a rich man, for he had no freedom to tax and tail his folk, nor forsooth would he have used it if he had; for he was no ill man, but kindly and of measure.  On these northern marches there was war at whiles, whereas they ended in a great forest well furnished of trees; and this wood was debateable, and King Peter and his sons rode therein at their peril: but great plenty was therein of all wild deer, as hart, and buck, and roe, and swine, and bears and wolves withal.  The lord on the other side thereof was a mightier man than King Peter, albeit he was a bishop, and a baron of Holy Church.  To say sooth he was a close-fist and a manslayer; though he did his manslaying through his vicars, the knights and men-at-arms who held their manors of him, or whom he waged.  In that forest had King Peter's father died in battle, and his eldest son also; therefore, being a man of peace, he rode therein but seldom, though his sons, the three eldest of them, had both ridden therein and ran therefrom valiantly.  As for Ralph the youngest, his father would not have him ride the Wood Debateable as yet.  So came those young men to the Want-ways, and found their father sitting there on a heap of stones, and over against him eight horses, four destriers, and four hackneys, and four squires withal.  So they came and stood before their father, waiting for his word, and wondering what it would be.  Now spake King Peter:  \"Fair sons, ye would go on all adventure to seek a wider land, and a more stirring life than ye may get of me at home: so be it!  But I have bethought me, that, since I am growing old and past the age of getting children, one of you, my sons, must abide at home to cherish me and your mother, and to lead our carles in war if trouble falleth upon us.  Now I know not how to choose by mine own wit which of you shall ride and which abide.  For so it is that ye are diverse of your conditions; but the evil conditions which one of you lacks the other hath, and the valiancy which one hath, the other lacks. Blaise is wise and prudent, but no great man of his hands.  Hugh is a stout rider and lifter, but headstrong and foolhardy, and over bounteous a skinker; and Gregory is courteous and many worded, but sluggish in deed; though I will not call him a dastard.  As for Ralph, he is fair to look on, and peradventure he may be as wise as Blaise, as valiant as Hugh, and as smooth-tongued as Gregory; but of all this we know little or nothing, whereas he is but young and untried.  Yet may he do better than you others, and I deem that he will do so.  All things considered, then, I say, I know not how to choose between you, my sons; so let luck choose for me, and ye shall draw cuts for your roads; and he that draweth longest shall go north, and the next longest shall go east, and the third straw shall send the drawer west; but as to him who draweth the shortest cut, he shall go no whither but back again to my house, there to abide with me the chances and changes of life; and it is most like that this one shall sit in my chair when I am gone, and be called King of Upmeads.  \"Now, my sons, doth this ordinance please you?  For if so be it doth not, then may ye all abide at home, and eat of my meat, and drink of my cup, but little chided either for sloth or misdoing, even as it hath been aforetime.\"  The young men looked at one another, and Blaise answered and said: \"Sir, as for me I say we will do after your commandment, to take what road luck may show us, or to turn back home again.\" They all yeasaid this one after the other; and then King Peter said: \"Now before I draw the cuts, I shall tell you that I have appointed the squires to go with each one of you.  Richard the Red shall go with Blaise; for though he be somewhat stricken in years, and wise, yet is he a fierce carle and a doughty, and knoweth well all feats of arms.  \"Lancelot Longtongue shall be squire to Hugh; for he is good of seeming and can compass all courtesy, and knoweth logic (though it be of the law and not of the schools), yet is he a proper man of his hands; as needs must he be who followeth Hugh; for where is Hugh, there is trouble and debate.  \"Clement the Black shall serve Gregory:  for he is a careful carle, and speaketh one word to every ten deeds that he doeth; whether they be done with point and edge, or with the hammer in the smithy.  \"Lastly, I have none left to follow thee, Ralph, save Nicholas Longshanks; but though he hath more words than I have, yet hath he more wisdom, and is a man lettered and far-travelled, and loveth our house right well.  \"How say ye, sons, is this to your liking?\"  They all said \"yea.\"  Then quoth the king; \"Nicholas, bring hither the straws ready dight, and I will give them my sons to draw.\"  So each young man came up in turn and drew; and King Peter laid the straws together and looked at them, and said:  \"Thus it is, Hugh goeth north with Lancelot, Gregory westward with Clement.\" He stayed a moment and then said:  \"Blaise fareth eastward and Richard with him.  As for thee, Ralph my dear son, thou shalt back with me and abide in my house and I shall see thee day by day; and thou shalt help me to live my last years happily in all honour; and thy love shall be my hope, and thy valiancy my stay.\"  Therewith he arose and threw his arm about the young man's neck; but he shrank away a little from his father, and his face grew troubled; and King Peter noted that, and his countenance fell, and he said:  \"Nay nay, my son; grudge not thy brethren the chances of the road, and the ill-hap of the battle.  Here at least for thee is the bounteous board and the full cup, and the love of kindred and well-willers, and the fellowship of the folk.  O well is thee, my son, and happy shalt thou be!\"  But the young man knit his brows and said no word in answer.  Then came forward those three brethren who were to fare at all adventure, and they stood before the old man saying nought.  Then he laughed and said: \"O ho, my sons!  Here in Upmeads have ye all ye need without money, but when ye fare in the outlands ye need money; is it not a lack of yours that your pouches be bare?  Abide, for I have seen to it.\"  Therewith he drew out of his pouch three little bags, and said; \"Take ye each one of these; for therein is all that my treasury may shed as now.  In each of these is there coined money, both white and red, and some deal of gold uncoined, and of rings and brooches a few, and by estimation there is in each bag the same value reckoned in lawful silver of Upmeads and the Wolds and the Overhill-Countries. Take up each what there is, and do the best ye may therewith.\"  Then each took his bag, and kissed and embraced his father; and they kissed Ralph and each other, and so got to horse and departed with their squires, going softly because of the hot sun.  But Nicholas slowly mounted his hackney and led Ralph's war-horse with him home again to King Peter's House.    CHAPTER 2  Ralph Goeth Back Home to the High House   Ralph and King Peter walked slowly home together, and as they went King Peter fell to telling of how in his young days he rode in the Wood Debateable, and was belated there all alone, and happed upon men who were outlaws and wolfheads, and feared for his life; but they treated him kindly, and honoured him, and saw him safe on his way in the morning.  So that never thereafter would he be art and part with those who hunted outlaws to slay them.  \"For,\" said he, \"it is with these men as with others, that they make prey of folk; yet these for the more part prey on the rich, and the lawful prey on the poor.  Otherwise it is with these wolfheads as with lords and knights and franklins, that as there be bad amongst them, so also there be good; and the good ones I happed on, and so may another man.\"  Hereto paid Ralph little heed at that time, since he had heard the tale and its morality before, and that more than once; and moreover his mind was set upon his own matters and these was he pondering.  Albeit perchance the words abode with him.  So came they to the House, and Ralph's mother, who was a noble dame, and well-liking as for her years, which were but little over fifty, stood in the hall-door to see which of her sons should come back to her, and when she saw them coming together, she went up to them, and cast her arms about Ralph and kissed him and caressed him--being exceeding glad that it was he and not one of the others who had returned to dwell with them; for he was her best-beloved, as was little marvel, seeing that he was by far the fairest and the most loving.  But Ralph's face grew troubled again in his mother's arms, for he loved her exceeding well; and forsooth he loved the whole house and all that dwelt there, down to the turnspit dogs in the chimney ingle, and the swallows that nested in the earthen bottles, which when he was little he had seen his mother put up in the eaves of the out-bowers: but now, love or no love, the spur was in his side, and he must needs hasten as fate would have him.  However, when he had disentangled himself from his mother's caresses, he enforced himself to keep a cheerful countenance, and upheld it the whole evening through, and was by seeming merry at supper, and went to bed singing.    CHAPTER 3  Ralph Cometh to the Cheaping-Town   He slept in an upper chamber in a turret of the House, which chamber was his own, and none might meddle with it.  There the next day he awoke in the dawning, and arose and clad himself, and took his wargear and his sword and spear, and bore all away without doors to the side of the Ford in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/169"],["title","The Well at the World's End: A Tale (#2)"],["body","ingle of the river, and laid it for a while in a little willow copse, so that no chance-comer might see it; then he went back to the stable of the House and took his destrier from the stall (it was a dapple-grey horse called Falcon, and was right good,) and brought him down to the said willow copse, and tied him to a tree till he had armed himself amongst the willows, whence he came forth presently as brisk-looking and likely a man-at-arms as you might see on a summer day.  Then he clomb up into the saddle, and went his ways splashing across the ford, before the sun had arisen, while the throstle-cocks were yet amidst their first song.  Then he rode on a little trot south away; and by then the sun was up he was without the bounds of Upmeads; albeit in the land thereabout dwelt none who were not friends to King Peter and his sons: and that was well, for now were folk stirring and were abroad in the fields; as a band of carles going with their scythes to the hay-field; or a maiden with her milking-pails going to her kine, barefoot through the seeding grass; or a company of noisy little lads on their way to the nearest pool of the stream that they might bathe in the warm morning after the warm night.  All these and more knew him and his armour and Falcon his horse, and gave him the sele of the day, and he was nowise troubled at meeting them; for besides that they thought it no wonder to meet one of the lords of Upmeads going armed about his errands, their own errands were close at home, and it was little likely that they should go that day so far as to Upmeads Water, seeing that it ran through the meadows a half-score miles to the north-ward.  So Ralph rode on, and came into the high road, that led one way back again into Upmeads, and crossed the Water by a fair bridge late builded between King Peter and a house of Canons on the north side, and the other way into a good cheaping-town hight Wulstead, beyond which Ralph knew little of the world which lay to the south, and seemed to him a wondrous place, full of fair things and marvellous adventures.  So he rode till he came into the town when the fair morning was still young, the first mass over, and maids gathered about the fountain amidst the market-place, and two or three dames sitting under the buttercross.  Ralph rode straight up to the house of a man whom he knew, and had often given him guesting there, and he himself was not seldom seen in the High House of Upmeads.  This man was a merchant, who went and came betwixt men's houses, and bought and sold many things needful and pleasant to folk, and King Peter dealt with him much and often.  Now he stood in the door of his house, which was new and goodly, sniffing the sweet scents which the morning wind bore into the town; he was clad in a goodly long gown of grey welted with silver, of thin cloth meet for the summer-tide: for little he wrought with his hands, but much with his tongue; he was a man of forty summers, ruddy-faced and black-bearded, and he was called Clement Chapman.  When he saw Ralph he smiled kindly on him, and came and held his stirrup as he lighted down, and said:  \"Welcome, lord!  Art thou come to give me a message, and eat and drink in a poor huckster's house, and thou armed so gallantly?\"  Ralph laughed merrily, for he was hungry, and he said: \"Yea, I will eat and drink with thee and kiss my gossip, and go my ways.\"  Therewith the carle led him into the house; and if it were goodly without, within it was better.  For there was a fair chamber panelled with wainscot well carven, and a cupboard of no sorry vessels of silver and latten: the chairs and stools as fair as might be; no king's might be better: the windows were glazed, and there were flowers and knots and posies in them; and the bed was hung with goodly web from over sea such as the soldan useth.  Also, whereas the chapman's ware-bowers were hard by the chamber, there was a pleasant mingled smell therefrom floating about.  The table was set with meat and drink and vessel of pewter and earth, all fair and good; and thereby stood the chapman's wife, a very goodly woman of two-score years, who had held Ralph at the font when she was a slim damsel new wedded; for she was come of no mean kindred of the Kingdom of Upmeads: her name was Dame Katherine.  Now she kissed Ralph's cheek friendly, and said: \"Welcome, gossip! thou art here in good time to break thy fast; and we will give thee a trim dinner thereafter, when thou hast been here and there in the town and done thine errand; and then shalt thou drink a cup and sing me a song, and so home again in the cool of the evening.\"  Ralph seemed a little troubled at her word, and he said: \"Nay, gossip, though I thank thee for all these good things as though I had them, yet must I ride away south straightway after I have breakfasted, and said one word to the goodman.  Goodman, how call ye the next town southward, and how far is it thither?\"  Quoth Clement:  \"My son, what hast thou to do with riding south?  As thou wottest, going hence south ye must presently ride the hill-country; and that is no safe journey for a lonely man, even if he be a doughty knight like to thee, lord.\"  Said Ralph, reddening withal:  \"I have an errand that way.\"  \"An errand of King Peter's or thine own?\" said Clement.  \"Of King Peter's, if ye must wot,\" said Ralph.  Clement were no chapman had he not seen that the lad was lying; so he said:  \"Fair lord, saving your worship, how would it be as to the speeding of King Peter's errand, if I brought thee before our mayor, and swore the peace against thee; so that I might keep thee in courteous prison till I had sent to thy father of thy whereabouts?\"  The young man turned red with anger; but ere he could speak Dame Katherine said sharply:  \"Hold thy peace, Clement!  What hast thou to meddle or make in the matter?  If our young lord hath will to ride out and see the world, why should we let him?  Yea, why should his father let him, if it come to that?  Take my word for it that my gossip shall go through the world and come back to those that love him, as goodly as he went forth.  And hold! here is for a token thereof.\"  Therewith she went to an ark that stood in the corner, and groped in the till thereof and brought out a little necklace of blue and green stones with gold knobs betwixt, like a pair of beads; albeit neither pope nor priest had blessed them; and tied to the necklace was a little box of gold with something hidden therein.  This gaud she gave to Ralph, and said to him: \"Gossip, wear this about thy neck, and let no man take it from thee, and I think it will be salvation to thee in peril, and good luck to thee in the time of questing; so that it shall be to thee as if thou hadst drunk of the WELL AT THE WORLD'S END.\"  \"What is that water?\" said Ralph, \"and how may I find it?\"  \"I know not rightly,\" she said, \"but if a body might come by it, I hear say it saveth from weariness and wounding and sickness; and it winneth love from all, and maybe life everlasting.  Hast thou not heard tell of it, my husband?\"  \"Yea,\" said the chapman, \"many times; and how that whoso hath drunk thereof hath the tongue that none may withstand, whether in buying or selling, or prevailing over the hearts of men in any wise.  But as for its wherabouts, ye shall not find it in these parts.  Men say that it is beyond the Dry Tree; and that is afar, God wot!  But now, lord Ralph, I rede thee go back again this evening with Andrew, my nephew, for company:  forsooth, he will do little less gainful than riding with thee to Upmeads than if he abide in Wulstead; for he is idle.  But, my lord, take it not amiss that I spake about the mayor and the tipstaves; for it was but a jest, as thou mayest well wot.\"  Ralph's face cleared at that word, and he stood smiling, weighing the chaplet in his hand; but Dame Katherine said:  \"Dear gossip, do it on speedily; for it is a gift from me unto thee: and from a gossip even king's sons may take a gift.\"  Quoth Ralph:  \"But is it lawful to wear it? is there no wizardry within it?\"  \"Hearken to him!\" she said, \"and how like unto a man he speaketh; if there were a brawl in the street, he would strike in and ask no word thereof, not even which were the better side: whereas here is my falcon-chick frighted at a little gold box and a pair of Saracen beads.\"  \"Well,\" quoth Ralph, \"the first holy man I meet shall bless them for me.\"  \"That shall he not,\" said the dame, \"that shall he not.  Who wotteth what shall betide to thee or me if he do so?  Come, do them on, and then to table!  For seest thou not that the goodman is wearying for meat? and even thine eyes will shine the brighter for a mouthful, king's son and gossip.\"  She took him by the hand and did the beads on his neck and kissed and fondled him before he sat down, while the goodman looked on, grinning rather sheepishly, but said nought to them; and only called on his boy to lead the destrier to stable.  So when they were set down, the chapman took up the word where it had been dropped, and said:  \"So, Lord Ralph, thou must needs take to adventures, being, as thou deemest, full grown.  That is all one as the duck taketh to water despite of the hen that hath hatched her.  Well, it was not to be thought that Upmeads would hold you lords much longer.  Or what is gone with my lords your brethren?\"  Said Ralph:  \"They have departed at all adventure, north, east, and west, each bearing our father's blessing and a bag of pennies.  And to speak the truth, goodman, for I perceive I am no doctor at lying, my father and mother would have me stay at home when my brethren were gone, and that liketh me not; therefore am I come out to seek my luck in the world: for Upmeads is good for a star-gazer, maybe, or a simpler, or a priest, or a worthy good carle of the fields, but not for a king's son with the blood running hot in his veins.  Or what sayest thou, gossip?\"  Quoth the dame:  \"I could weep for thy mother; but for"]]]
