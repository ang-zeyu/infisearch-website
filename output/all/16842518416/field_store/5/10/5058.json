Some of the water swept into the cabin, and the girls were alarmed more than ever.  \"A good job done that it's overboard,\" said Captain Jerry. \"Another plunge or two and we would have gone over, sure pop!\"  With the wreckage cleared away the boys breathed more freely. But the peril was still extreme, for it was no easy matter to keep the craft from taking the mighty waves broadside. But the force of the wind drove them on, and Captain Jerry handled the wheel as only a veteran tar could.  \"I guess it's a hurricane,\" was Tom's comment.  \"Looks more like a cyclone to me,\" spluttered Sam. \"I'd give a good deal to be out of it.\"  To keep from, being swamped they had to run out to sea. This was no pleasant prospect to the boys, but it could not be helped.  \"We needn't tell the girls,\" said Dick. \"It will only worry them more, without doing any good.\"  Two hours went by, and the storm kept on as madly as ever. Night was now coming on, and soon it was impossible to see a hundred feet in any direction. The yacht's lanterns were lit, and one was hoisted on a stick which Dick nailed to the stump of the mast.  \"We've got to, have some sort o' light,\" said Captain Jerry. \"If not, we may run afoul o' some other craft.\"  The time went by slowly, each hour seeming an age. Nobody felt like eating, and nothing was said about supper until nearly nine o'clock, when Dora opened the cabin door and called Dick:  \"We thought we would get to shore before eating,\" she said. \"How much longer will we be out, do you think?\"  \"There is no telling, Dora,\" he replied evasively.  \"No telling? Doesn't Captain Jerry know where we are?\"  \"Hardly. You see it is so dark, and we can't make any headway with the mast gone.\"  \"How stupid of me! I should have known that. Shall we try to fix up some supper?\"  \"You might pass some sandwiches. But, no, we had better come down, one at a time,\" returned Dick.  This suggestion was carried out, Captain Jerry being the last to go down, leaving the wheel in the hands of Dick and Tom.  \"Don't ye let it git away from ye,\" was his caution. \"If ye do it will be good-by, 'Liza Jane, an' all of us goin' slam bang to Davy Jones' locker!\"  From old Jerry the girls learned that they would probably have to remain on the yacht all night.  \"Don't ye git alarmed,\" he said. \"The storm's goin' down, an' we'll come out all right when the sun rises.\"  The prospect of remaining on the ocean all night was dismaying, and all of the girls wondered what Mrs. Stanhope would say when they did not return.  \"I know mother will be very much worried,\" said Dora soberly.  It was decided by the boys that they should take turns at lying down, each being given two hours in which to rest. Sam was the first to turn in, but it is doubtful if he slept to any extent. Tom followed, and then came Dick. Captain Jerry declined, stating he could sleep when he had the party safe on shore once more.  By morning the storm had taken another turn. It no longer rained, but the sky was murky, and there was a dense fog, which the wind blew first in one direction, and then another. They were still running to sea, with small prospect of being able to turn back.  \"This is certainly more than I bargained for,\" observed Dick to Tom, in a low voice. \"To me it looks mighty serious.\"  \"Oh, the storm is bound to go down.\"  \"Yes, Tom, but how long do you suppose the provisions and water will last?\"  At this question Tom's face fell.  \"I hadn't thought of that, Dick. I don't suppose we have more than enough for to-day, have we?\"  \"Well, we might make it last two days on a pinch--we brought quite a lot along. But after that--\"  \"Do you think we'll have to stay out here more than two days?\" demanded Sam.  \"I don't know what to think, Sam.\"  \"Can't we rig up some sort of a jury-mast?\"  \"Captain Jerry mentioned that. We'll try.\"  There was no stick on board of the  _Old Glory_ outside of the bowsprit, and at last they decided to saw this off and put it up as a small mast.  The task was no easy one, and just as the temporary mast was being fitted into place there came an extra heavy puff of wind which sent the yacht far over on her side.  \"Hold fast, all of ye!\" roared Captain Jerry, and they obeyed, and the stick went rolling over the side and out of sight in the billows.  \"Gone!\" gasped Tom. \"That ends putting up another mast.\"  Slowly the day wore along. The girls were silent, and if the truth be told more than one tear was shed between them, although before the boys they tried to put on a brave face. There were no regular meals, and by the advice of Captain Jerry and Dick they were sparing of the provisions and the water.  \"Our only hope now is for the storm to go down, or else to sight some passing ship,\" said Dick. \"Getting back to Santa Barbara at present is out of the question. For all we know, we may be a hundred or two hundred miles from the coast.\"  About two o'clock in the afternoon the sky cleared a little. But as the fog lifted, the wind blew with greater force, sending them reeling and plunging into the mighty waves.  \"It looks as if we should be swamped after all,\" said Tom dolefully.  \"Never say die, Tom,\" came from Sam resolutely.  \"I suppose Mrs. Stanhope will be worried half to death.\"  \"No doubt of it.\"  Nobody had any heart to talk, and each watched eagerly for some sign of a sail. Tom had a spyglass, and just before sunset he let out a shout:  \"A ship! A ship!\"  \"Where?\" came from the others.  \"Off in that direction,\" and Tom pointed with his hand.  All took a look through the glass, and saw that he was right. There was a steamer approaching.  \"If only they see us.\" said Dick, and his brothers nodded.  The girls had heard the cry, and now came on deck to learn what it meant.  \"Oh, I hope they take us on board and back home,\" said Nellie. \"I must say I am heartily tired of this yacht.\"  The wind was increasing, and the girls had to go back to the cabin to keep from getting wet. The boys put up a flag, upside down, on a piece of planking, and waited eagerly for the steamer to come nearer.  \"The yacht is settling,\" cried Dick, a little while later. \"Don't you notice it?\"  \"The Old Glory has sprung some leaks,\" responded Captain Jerry sadly. \"Take the wheel while I go and look them over.\"  Tom and Sam, took the wheel, while old Jerry and Dick inspected the leaks. They soon reported that two seams had opened at the bow, and that there was a bad break at the stern, which was bound soon to interfere with the rudder.  \"I believe that steamer is going to leave us!\" cried Sam, a little while later.  \"Oh, don't say that,\" said Dick. \"We must signal her somehow.\"  \"We'll fire some rockets,\" said Captain Jerry.  This was done, and a little later they saw that the steamer was heading in their direction. By this time the Old Glory showed unmistakable signs of being on the point of foundering, and the girls were told to come on deck. Everybody was given a life preserver, which had been kept close at hand since the beginning of the trouble.  \"We are seen!\" cried Sam joyously, as a signal came from the steamer.  Gradually the strange vessel drew closer, and they saw that she was a rather clumsy affair of the \"tramp\" pattern, used to carry all sorts of cargoes from one port to another.  \"They are lowering a small boat,\" said Sam, a little later.  \"I wish they would hurry,\" returned Tom, in a low voice. \"I believe this yacht is going to go down very soon.\"  At last the small boat was close enough to be hailed, and preparations were made for transferring the girls first.  It was no easy matter to make the change, and it took a good quarter of an hour to land the girls on the steamer's deck.  By this time the Old Glory was completely water-logged.  \"We have got to jump for it, lads!\" cried Captain Jerry, \"unless you want to go down with her!\"  And jump they did, into the mighty waves, and none too soon, for a minute later the yacht went down, out of their sight forever.  The small boat was not far away, and soon Sam and Tom were picked up. To get Dick and Captain Jerry was not so easy, but the task was finally accomplished, and soon all of our friends stood on the deck of the tramp steamer, safe and sound once more.     CHAPTER VII  DISMAYING NEWS   \"Thank fortune we got away from the yacht just in time!\" exclaimed Tom, as he shook the water from his clothes.  \"I'm sorry to see the Old Glory go,\" said Captain Jerry sadly. \"I thought a heap o' that craft, I did. It will be sorry news to take back to Master Bob.\"  \"Never mind, we'll help pay for the loss,\" put in Dick.  \"Where are you folks from?\" questioned the captain of the steamer, as he came up to, the crowd.  \"We came from Santa Barbara. The storm took our mast, and blew us out to sea,\" answered Dick. \"We owe you something for, picking us up.\"  \"You're welcome for what I've done,\" answered Captain, Fairleigh. \"Come with me, and I'll try to get you some dry clothing. I can trick out the men folks, and the young ladies will have to see my wife, who happens to be with me on this trip.\"  \"What steamer is this?\" asked Tom.  \"The Tacoma, lad.\"  \"Are you bound for San Francisco?\" questioned Sam.  \"No, we are bound for Honolulu, on the Hawaiian Islands.\"  \"Honolulu!\" burst out the others.  \"Do you mean to say that the first port you will make will be Honolulu?\" demanded Dick.  \"That's my orders, lad. I must get there just as quick as I can, too, for a cargo of sugar.\"  \"But we don't want to go to the Hawaiian Islands!\" put in Dora. \"Mercy! It's two thousand miles away!\"  At this Captain Fairleigh shrugged his broad shoulders.  \"I am sorry for you, but I can't put back, miss. Perhaps we'll meet some vessel bound for some port in the United States. If so, I can ask the captain to take you back.\"  \"And if you don't meet any vessel?\" came from Grace.  \"Oh, I think we'll pass some vessel,\" returned the captain.  He took the girls and introduced them to,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16476"],["title","The Rover Boys on Land and Sea: The Crusoes of Seven Islands (#6)"],["body"," his wife, and then turned the boys and old Jerry over to the first mate, who obtained for them some dry clothing. After this all were provided with a hot supper, which did much toward making them comfortable, at least physically speaking.  But not one of them was comfortable mentally. To be carried to the Hawaiian Islands, two thousand miles away, was no pleasant thought. Besides, what would their folks think of their prolonged absence?  \"Mother will think that we have all been drowned,\" said Dora.  \"And that is what our folks will think, too,\" said Nellie. \"Oh, it is terrible, simply terrible!\" And she wrung her little hands.  By making inquiries Dick learned that the steamer was expected to reach Honolulu inside of two weeks, if the weather was not too, bad. From Honolulu they could get passage to San Francisco on the mail steamer, the trip lasting exactly seven days.  \"We'll have to get some money first,\" said Tom. \"And we can't cable for it, either,\" he went on, for the cable to the Hawaiian Islands from the United States had not yet been laid.  \"Let us hope that we will see some ship that will take us back,\" said Sam.  Day after day they watched eagerly for a passing sail. But though they sighted four vessels and hailed them, not one was bound for the United States, outside of a whaler, and that craft intended to stay out at least three months longer before making for port.  \"We are booked for this trip, and no mistake,\" sighed Tom. \"Well, since that is so, let us make the best of it.\"  The Tacoma was heavily laden, and though the storm cleared away and the Pacific Ocean became moderately calm, she made but slow progress.  \"Our boilers are not in the best of condition,\" said Captain Fairleigh.  \"I trust there is no danger of their blowing up,\" returned Dick.  \"Not if we don't force them too much.\"  It had been arranged that the boys and girls should pay a fair price for the trip to Honolulu, the money to, be sent to the captain of the Tacoma later on. As for old Jerry, he signed articles to work his passage to the Hawaiian Islands and back again. As Captain Fairleigh was rather short of hands he was glad to have the old sailor join his crew.  The days slipped by, and, having recovered from the effects of the storm, the Rover boys became as light hearted as ever. Tom was particularly full of pranks.  \"No use of crying over spilt milk,\" he declared. \"Let us be thankful the pitcher wasn't broken, or, in other words, that we are not at this moment at the bottom of the Pacific.\"  \"Right you are,\" replied Sam.  There was an old piano on board, and the boys and girls often amused themselves at this, singing and playing. As there were no other passengers, they had the freedom of the ship.  \"This would be real jolly,\" said Tom, \"if it wasn't that the folks at home must be worried,\" and then he began to sing, for he really could not be sad:  \"A life on the ocean wave,   A home on the rolling deep, A house in a watery cave--   Where I might rest in sleep!\"  \"Did you ever hear such a song?\" cried Nellie, and Tom went on:  \"The boy stood on the burning deck,   Munching apples by the peck; The captain yelled, he stood stock-still,   For of those apples he wanted his fill!\"  \"Tom Rover!\" burst out Dora. \"I believe you would sing at your own funeral!\" And Tom continued gayly:  \"Sailing, sailing, over the bounding main,   For many a stormy wind shall blow, Ere the Rovers get home again!\"  \"Tom lives on songs,\" said Sam slyly. \"He'd rather sing than eat a pie.\"  \"Pie!\" thundered Tom tragically. \"Who said pie? I haven't seen a home-made pie since--since--\"  \"The time you went down in the pantry at midnight and ate two,\" finished Dick, and then there was a burst of laughter.  \"Never mind, Tom, I'll make you half a dozen pies--when we get home,\" came from Nellie.  \"Will you really?\" said Tom, and then he began once more, as gayly as ever:  \"You can give me pudding And give me cake, And anything else You care to bake; But if you wish To charm my eye, Just hand me over Some home-made pie!\"  \"That's all right,\" said Dick. \"But in place of eye you should have said stomach.\"  \"Stomach doesn't rhyme with pie,\" snorted 'Tom. \"I'm a true poet and I know what I am doing.\"  \"Talking about pie makes me think of pie-plates,\" said Sam. \"Let us play spinning the plate on deck. It will be lots of fun trying to catch the plate while it is spinning and the steamer is rolling.\"  \"Good!\" cried Grace, and ran to get a plate from the cook's galley. Soon they were playing merrily, and the game served to make an hour pass pleasantly. When the forfeits had to be redeemed, the girls made the boys do several ridiculous things. Tom had to hop from one end of the deck to the other on one foot, Sam had to stand on his head, and recite \"Mary had a Little Lamb,\" and Dick had to go to three of the sailors and ask each if they would tie the ship to a post during the night.  \"I'll wager you are a merry crowd on land,\" .said Captain Fairleigh, as he paused to watch the fun. \"Takes me back to the time when I was a boy,\" and he laughed heartily. Even the captain's wife was amused. She was particularly fond of music, and loved to listen to the playing and singing.  The days slipped by one after the other, until Captain Fairleigh announced that forty-eight hours more ought to bring them in sight of Diamond Head, a high hill at the entrance to Honolulu harbor.  But another storm was at hand, and that night the wind blew more fiercely than ever. The Tacoma tossed and pitched to such a degree that standing on the deck was next to impossible, and all of the boys and the girls gathered in the cabin and held fast to the posts and the stationary seats.  \"It feels as if the steamer would roll clear over,\" said Sam. \"Here we go again!\"  There was thunder and lightning, and soon a deluge of rain, fully as heavy as that experienced while on board of the ill-fated Old Glory. This continued all of the night, and in the morning the storm seemed to grow worse instead of better.  \"We are in a run of bad luck,\" said Dick. \"I really believe we will have all sorts of trouble before we get back to the United States.\"  Toward noon a mist came up, and it grew dark. Lanterns were lit, and the Tacoma felt her way along carefully, for Captain Fairleigh knew that they were now in the track of considerable shipping.  By nightfall the steamer lay almost at a stand-still, for the mist was thicker than ever. For safety the whistle was sounded at short intervals.  The girls were the first to retire, and the boys followed half an hour later. The staterooms of all were close together.  Dick Rover was the last to go to sleep. How long he slept he did not know.  He awoke with a start. A shock had thrown him to the floor of the stateroom, and down came Sam on top of him. There were hoarse cries from the deck, a shrill steam whistle, and the sound of a fog horn, and then a grinding thud and a bump that told the Tacoma had either run into some other ship or into the rocks.     CHAPTER VIII  FROM ONE SHIP TO ANOTHER   \"We struck something!\"  \"What is the matter?\"  \"Are we going down?\"  These and a score of other cries rang out on board the steamer. The thumping and bumping continued, followed by a crashing that could mean but one thing--that the ship was being splintered, and that her seams were being laid wide open.  As soon as possible the Rover boys slipped into some clothing and went on deck. They were quickly followed by the three girls, who clung tight to them in terror.  \"Oh, Dick, this is the worst yet!\" came from Dora. \"What will be the end?\"  \"The Tacoma is sinking!\" was the cry from out of the darkness.  \"Are we really sinking?\" gasped Nellie as she clutched Tom.  \"Yes, we are,\" came from Sam. \"Can't you feel the deck settling?\"  They could, only too plainly, and in a minute more the water seemed to be running all around them. The cries continued, but it was so black they could see next to nothing.  What happened in the next few minutes the Rover boys could scarcely tell, afterward. An effort was made to get out a life-boat, and it disappeared almost as soon as it left the side, carrying some sailors with it. Then some red-fire blazed up, lighting up the tragic scene, and revealing a schooner standing close by the steamer. The sailing vessel had her bowsprit broken and part of her forward rail torn away.  \"If we must die, let us die together!\" said Dick, and they kept together as well as they could. Old Jerry was with them, and said he would do all he could for them. He had already passed around life-preservers, and these they put on with all possible speed.  Then followed a sudden plunge of the steamer and all found themselves in the waves of the ocean. They went down together, each holding the hand of somebody else. When they came up, Tom was close to a life-line thrown from the sailing vessel and this he clutched madly.  \"Haul us in!\" he yelled. \"Haul us in!\" And the line was pulled in with care, and after ten minutes of extreme peril the boys and the girls and Captain Jerry found themselves on board of the sailing vessel, which proved to be a large three-masted schooner.  All of our friends were so exhausted that they had to be carried to the cabin and here Dora and Grace fainted away completely, while Nellie was little better off. Tom had had his left arm bruised and Dick was suffering from an ugly scratch on the forehead. It was fully an hour before any of them felt like moving around.  In the meantime the two vessels had separated, and though red fire was burned twice, after that, and rockets sent up, nothing more was seen or heard of the Tacoma or those left on board.  \"But I don't think she went down,\" said Captain Jerry. \"She was too well built for that.\" And he was right, as events proved. Much crippled the steamer two days later entered Honolulu harbor, where she was laid up for repairs.  Worn out completely by what they had passed through, the boys slept heavily for the rest"]]]
