I'm dying. I want to die! Can't you understand that? I want to die! I don't want your help!\"  He had said it. And the shock of it jolted even him in the depths of his half-conscious mind. Could a man really _want_ to die?  Yes.  He had forgotten what terror he had left so far behind. He knew only that he wanted to move forever in the direction of the flowing peace.  Like probing fingers, Sam Atkins' mind continued to touch him. It scanned the broken organs of his body, and, in some kind of detached way, Baker felt that he was accompanying Atkins on that journey of exploration, even as Sam had asked.  They searched the skeleton and found the splintered bones. They examined the muscle structure and found the torn and shattered tissue. They searched the dark recesses of his vital organs and came to injury that Baker knew was hopeless.  \"You built this once,\" Sam Atkins' voice whispered. \"You can build it again. The materials are all here. The blood stream is still moving. The nerve tissue will carry your instructions. I'll supply the scaffolding--while you build--\"  He remembered. Baker examined the long-untouched record of when he had done this before. He remembered the construction of cells, the building of organs, the interconnection of nerve tissue. He felt an infinite sadness at the present ruin. Yes--he could build again.         *       *       *       *       *  Sam Atkins' face was like that of a dead man. Across the table from him, Jim Ellerbee and John Fenwick watched silently. Faintly, between them was the crystal-projected image of Baker's body.  Fenwick felt the cold touch of some mysterious unknown prickle his scalp. Sam Atkins seemed remote and alien, like the practitioner of ancient and forbidden arts. Fenwick found the question tumbling over and over in his mind, who is this man? He felt as if the very life energy of Sam Atkins was somehow flowing out through the crystal, across space, to the distant broken body of Bill Baker and was supporting it while Baker's own feeble energy was consumed in the rebuilding of his shattered organs.  [Illustration]  Though Fenwick and Ellerbee held their own crystals, Sam had somehow shut them out. They were in faint contact with Baker, but they could not follow the fierce contact that Sam's mind held with him.  Ellerbee's face showed worry and a trace of panic. He hesitantly reached out to touch the immobile figure of Sam Atkins, who sat with closed eyes and imperceptible breath. Fenwick sensed disaster. He arrested the motion of Ellerbee's hand.  \"I think you could kill them both,\" he whispered. The life force of one man, divided between two--it was not sufficient to cope with unexpected shocks to either, now.  Ellerbee desisted. \"I've never seen anything like this before,\" he said. \"I don't know what Sam's doing--I don't know how he's doing it--\"  Fenwick looked sharply at Ellerbee. Ellerbee had discovered the crystals, so he and Sam said. Yet Sam was able to do things with them that Ellerbee could not conceive. Fenwick wondered just who was responsible for the crystals. And he resolved that some day, when and if Baker pulled out of this, he would learn something more about Sam Atkins.  Time moved beyond midnight and into the early morning hours of the day, but this meant nothing to William Baker. He was in the midst of eternity. Because the old pattern was there, and the ancient memories were clear, his reconstruction moved at a pace that was limited only by the materials available. When these grew scarce, Sam Atkins showed him how to break down and utilize other structures that could be rebuilt leisurely at a later time. There was remembered joy in the building and, once started, Baker gave only idle wonder to the question of whether this was more desirable than death. He did not know. This seemed the right thing to do.  In the presence of Sam Atkins everything he was doing seemed right, and a lifetime of doubts, and errors, and fears seemed distant and vague.  But Sam said suddenly, \"It is almost finished. Just a little farther and you'll have to go the rest of the way alone.\"  Terror struck at Baker. He had reached a point where he was absolutely sure he could _not_ go on alone without Sam's supporting presence. \"You tricked me!\" Baker cried. \"You tricked me! You didn't tell me I would have to be reborn alone!\"  \"Doesn't every man?\" said Sam. \"Is there any way to be born, except alone?\"  Slowly, the world closed in about Baker.  Light. Sounds.  Wet. Cold.  The impact of a million idiot minds. The coursing of cosmic-ray particles. The wrenching of Earth's magnetic and gravitational fields. Old and sluggish memories were renewed, memories meant to be buried for all of his life.  Baker felt as if he were suddenly running down a dark and immense corridor. Behind were all the terrors spawned since the beginning of time. Ahead were a thousand openings of light and safety. He raced for the nearest and brightest and most familiar.  \"No,\" said Sam Atkins. \"You cannot go that way again. It is the way you went before--and it led to this--to a search for death. For you, it will lead only to the same goal again.\"  \"I can't go on!\" Baker cried. The terrors seemed to be swiftly closing in.  \"Take my hand a moment longer,\" said Sam. \"Inspect these more distant paths. There are many of them that will be agreeable to you.\"  Baker felt calmer now in the renewed presence of Sam Atkins. He passed the branching pathway that Sam had forbidden, that had seemed so bright. He sensed now why Sam had cautioned him against it. Far down, in the depths of it, he glimpsed faintly a dark ugliness that he had not seen before. He shuddered.  Directly ahead there seemed to be the opening of a corridor of blazing brightness. Baker's calmness increased as he approached. \"This one,\" he said.  He heard nothing, but he sensed Sam Atkins' smile, and nod of approval.  He remembered now for the first time why he had wanted to die. It was to avoid the very terrors by which he had been pursued through the dark corridor. All this had happened before, and he had gone down the pathway Sam had forbidden. Somehow, like a circle, it had come back to this very point, to this forgotten experience for which he had been willing to die rather than endure again.  It was very bewildering. He did not understand the meaning of it. But he knew he had corrected a former error. He was back in the world. He was alive again.  Sam Atkins looked up at his companions through eyes that seemed all but dead. \"He's going to make it,\" he said. \"We can get the car out and pick up Baker now.\"         *       *       *       *       *  They used Sam's panel truck, which had a four-wheel drive and mud tires. Nothing else could possibly get through. Fenwick left his own car at Ellerbee's.  It was still raining lightly as the truck sloshed and slewed through the muck that was hardly recognizable now as a road. For an hour Sam fought the wheel to hold the car approximately in the middle of the brownish ooze that led them through the night. The three men sat in the cab. Behind them, a litter and first-aid equipment had been rigged for Baker. Sam told them nothing would be needed except soap and water, but Fenwick and Ellerbee felt it impossible to go off without some other emergency equipment.  After an hour, Sam said, \"He's close. Just around the next bend. That's where his car went off.\"  Baker loomed suddenly in the lights of the car. He was standing at the edge of the road. He waved an arm wearily.  Fenwick would not have recognized him. And for some seconds after the car had come to a halt, and Baker stood weaving uncertainly in the beam of the lights, Fenwick was not sure it was Baker at all.  He looked like something out of an old Frankenstein movie. His clothes were ripped almost completely away. Those remaining were stained with blood and red clay, and soaked with rain. Baker's face was laced with a network of scars as if he had been slashed with a shower of glass not too long ago and the wounds were freshly healed. Blood was caked and cracked on his face and was matted in his hair.  [Illustration]  He smiled grotesquely as he staggered toward the car door. \"About time you got here,\" he said. \"A man could catch his death of cold standing out here in this weather.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Dr. William Baker was quite sure he had no need of hospitalization, but he let them settle him in a hospital bed anyway. He had some thinking to do, and he didn't know of a better place to get it done.  There was a good deal of medical speculation about the vast network of very fresh scars on his body, the bones which X rays showed to have been only very recently knit, and the violent internal injuries which gave some evidence of their recent healing. Baker allowed the speculation to go on without offering explanations. He let them tap and measure and apply electrical gadgets to their heart's content. It didn't bother the thinking he had to get done.  Fenwick and Ellerbee came back the next day to see him. The two approached the bed so warily that Baker burst out laughing. \"Pull up chairs!\" he exclaimed. \"Just because you saw me looking a shade less than dead doesn't mean I'm a ghost now. Sit down. And where's Sam? Not that I don't appreciate seeing your ugly faces, but Sam and I have got some things to talk about.\"  Ellerbee and Fenwick looked at each other as if each expected the other to speak.  \"Well, what's the matter?\" demanded Baker. \"Nothing's happened to Sam, I hope!\"  Fenwick spoke finally. \"We don't know where Sam is. We don't think we'll be seeing him again.\"  \"Why not?\" Baker demanded. But in the back of his mind was the growing suspicion that he knew.  \"After your--accident,\" said Fenwick, \"I went back to the farm with"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28119"],["title","My Father, the Cat (#0)"],["body","Slesar, as we have said before, is a young advertising     executive who has rapidly become one of the better known writers in     the field. Here is an off-trail story that is guaranteed to make     some of you take a very searching second look at some of the young     men you know._         my  father,      the      cat   _by HENRY SLESAR_    He wondered if I'd told her everything, and, faltering, I  had to admit that I hadn't. She was wonderful--but human.   My mother was a lovely, delicate woman from the coast of Brittany, who was miserable sleeping on less than three mattresses, and who, it is said, was once injured by a falling leaf in her garden. My grandfather, a descendant of the French nobility whose family had ridden the tumbrils of the Revolution, tended her fragile body and spirit with the same loving care given rare, brief-blooming flowers. You may imagine from this his attitude concerning marriage. He lived in terror of the vulgar, heavy-handed man who would one day win my mother's heart, and at last, this persistent dread killed him. His concern was unnecessary, however, for my mother chose a suitor who was as free of mundane brutality as a husband could be. Her choice was Dauphin, a remarkable white cat which strayed onto the estate shortly after his death.  Dauphin was an unusually large Angora, and his ability to speak in cultured French, English, and Italian was sufficient to cause my mother to adopt him as a household pet. It did not take long for her to realize that Dauphin deserved a higher status, and he became her friend, protector, and confidante. He never spoke of his origin, nor where he had acquired the classical education which made him such an entertaining companion. After two years, it was easy for my mother, an unworldly woman at best, to forget the dissimilarity in their species. In fact, she was convinced that Dauphin was an enchanted prince, and Dauphin, in consideration of her illusions, never dissuaded her. At last, they were married by an understanding clergyman of the locale, who solemnly filled in the marriage application with the name of M. Edwarde Dauphin.  I, Etienne Dauphin, am their son.  To be candid, I am a handsome youth, not unlike my mother in the delicacy of my features. My father's heritage is evident in my large, feline eyes, and in my slight body and quick movements. My mother's death, when I was four, left me in the charge of my father and his coterie of loyal servants, and I could not have wished for a finer upbringing. It is to my father's patient tutoring that I owe whatever graces I now possess. It was my father, the cat, whose gentle paws guided me to the treasure houses of literature, art, and music, whose whiskers bristled with pleasure at a goose well cooked, at a meal well served, at a wine well chosen. How many happy hours we shared! He knew more of life and the humanities, my father, the cat, than any human I have met in all my twenty-three years.  Until the age of eighteen, my education was his personal challenge. Then, it was his desire to send me into the world outside the gates. He chose for me a university in America, for he was deeply fond of what he called \"that great raw country,\" where he believed my feline qualities might be tempered by the aggressiveness of the rough-coated barking dogs I would be sure to meet.  I must confess to a certain amount of unhappiness in my early American years, torn as I was from the comforts of the estate and the wisdom of my father, the cat. But I became adapted, and even upon my graduation from the university, sought and held employment in a metropolitan art museum. It was there I met Joanna, the young woman I intended to make my bride.  Joanna was a product of the great American southwest, the daughter of a cattle-raiser. There was a blooming vitality in her face and her body, a lustiness born of open skies and desert. Her hair was not the gold of antiquity; it was new gold, freshly mined from the black rock. Her eyes were not like old-world diamonds; their sparkle was that of sunlight on a cascading river. Her figure was bold, an open declaration of her sex.  She was, perhaps, an unusual choice for the son of fairy-like mother and an Angora cat. But from the first meeting of our eyes, I knew that I would someday bring Joanna to my father's estate to present her as my fiancee.  I approached that occasion with understandable trepidation. My father had been explicit in his advice before I departed for America, but on no point had he been more emphatic than secrecy concerning himself. He assured me that revelation of my paternity would bring ridicule and unhappiness upon me. The advice was sound, of course, and not even Joanna knew that our journey's end would bring us to the estate of a large, cultured, and conversing cat. I had deliberately fostered the impression that I was orphaned, believing that the proper place for revealing the truth was the atmosphere of my father's home in France. I was certain that Joanna would accept her father-in-law without distress. Indeed, hadn't nearly a score of human servants remained devoted to their feline master for almost a generation?  We had agreed to be wed on the first of June, and on May the fourth, emplaned in New York for Paris. We were met at Orly Field by Francois, my father's solemn manservant, who had been delegated not so much as escort as he was chaperone, my father having retained much of the old world proprieties. It was a long trip by automobile to our estate in Brittany, and I must admit to a brooding silence throughout the drive which frankly puzzled Joanna.  However, when the great stone fortress that was our home came within view, my fears and doubts were quickly dispelled. Joanna, like so many Americans, was thrilled at the aura of venerability and royal custom surrounding the estate. Francois placed her in charge of Madame Jolinet, who clapped her plump old hands with delight at the sight of her fresh blonde beauty, and chattered and clucked like a mother hen as she led Joanna to her room on the second floor. As for myself, I had one immediate wish: to see my father, the cat.  He greeted me in the library, where he had been anxiously awaiting our arrival, curled up in his favorite chair by the fireside, a wide-mouthed goblet of cognac by his side. As I entered the room, he lifted a paw formally, but then his reserve was dissolved by the emotion of our reunion, and he licked my face in unashamed joy.  Francois refreshed his glass, and poured another for me, and we toasted each other's well-being.  \"To you, _mon purr_,\" I said, using the affectionate name of my childhood memory.  \"To Joanna,\" my father said. He smacked his lips over the cognac, and wiped his whiskers gravely. \"And where is this paragon?\"  \"With Madame Jolinet. She will be down shortly.\"  \"And you have told her everything?\"  I blushed. \"No, _mon purr_, I have not. I thought it best to wait until we were home. She is a wonderful woman,\" I added impulsively. \"She will not be--\"  \"Horrified?\" my father said. \"What makes you so certain, my son?\"  \"Because she is a woman of great heart,\" I said stoutly. \"She was educated at a fine college for women in Eastern America. Her ancestors were rugged people, given to legend and folklore. She is a warm, human person--\"  \"Human,\" my father sighed, and his tail swished. \"You are expecting too much of your beloved, Etienne. Even a woman of the finest character may be dismayed in this situation.\"  \"But my mother--\"  \"Your mother was an exception, a changeling of the Fairies. You must not look for your mother's soul in Joanna's eyes.\" He jumped from his chair, and came towards me, resting his paw upon my knee. \"I am glad you have not spoken of me, Etienne. Now you must keep your silence forever.\"  I was shocked. I reached down and touched my father's silky fur, saddened by the look of his age in his gray, gold-flecked eyes, and by the tinge of yellow in his white coat.  \"No, _mon purr_,\" I said. \"Joanna must know the truth. Joanna must know how proud I am to be the son of Edwarde Dauphin.\"  \"Then you will lose her.\"  \"Never! That cannot happen!\"  My father walked stiffly to the fireplace, staring into the gray ashes. \"Ring for Francois,\" he said. \"Let him build the fire. I am cold, Etienne.\"  I walked to the cord and pulled it. My father turned to me and said: \"You must wait, my son. At dinner this evening, perhaps. Do not speak of me until then.\"  \"Very well, father.\"  When I left the library, I encountered Joanna at the head of the stairway, and she spoke to me excitedly.  \"Oh, Etienne! What a _beautiful_ old house. I know I will love it! May we see the rest?\"  \"Of course,\" I said.  \"You look troubled. Is something wrong?\"  \"No, no. I was thinking how lovely you are.\"  We embraced, and her warm full body against mine confirmed my conviction that we should never be parted. She put her arm in mine, and we strolled through the great rooms of the house. She was ecstatic at their size and elegance, exclaiming over the carpeting, the gnarled furniture, the ancient silver and pewter, the gallery of family paintings. When she came upon an early portrait of my mother, her eyes misted.  \"She was lovely,\" Joanna said. \"Like a princess! And what of your father? Is there no portrait of him?\"  \"No,\" I said hurriedly. \"No portrait.\" I had spoken my first lie to Joanna, for there was a painting, half-completed, which my mother had begun in the last year of her life. It was a whispering little watercolor, and Joanna discovered it to my consternation.  \"What a magnificent cat!\" she said. \"Was it a pet?\"  \"It is Dauphin,\" I said nervously.  She laughed. \"He has your eyes, Etienne.\"  \"Joanna, I must tell you something--\"  \"And this ferocious gentleman with the moustaches? Who is he?\"  \"My grandfather. Joanna, you must listen--\"  Francois, who had been following our inspection tour at shadow's-length, interrupted. I suspected that his timing was no mere"]]]
