LESLIE       _It is said that Life crawled up from the slime of the sea-bottoms     and became Man because of inherent greatness bred into him before     the dawn of time. But perhaps this urge was not as formless as we     think._   Buos was chastising Laloi as they sped through the ionosphere of the green planet. But like the airy creature she was, Laloi ignored the criticism and rippled zephyr-like through a clump of daffodils when they completed their descent.  \"So pretty,\" she sighed. She flung her incorporeal substance around each flower, absorbing their unified beauty of scent, sight, and feel. Buos shrilled himself into a column of wind to express his displeasure at her attitude.  \"Stupid, silly, shallow thing!\" he said. \"If the others only knew how you behaved--\"  \"And you'll be glad to tell them, of course,\" she said, extending her fingers of air into the roots of the wind-bent grass. She rolled across the hill ecstatically, and Buos followed in grumbling billows of energy.  \"I don't carry tales,\" he replied, somewhat mortified. \"But we're here as observers, and you insist upon making this world a plaything ...\"  \"I love it,\" she said happily. \"It's so warm and green.\"  Buos whipped in front of her angrily. \"This is an assignment,\" he snapped, his emotion crackling the air about him. \"We have a purpose here.\"  \"Purpose!\" she groaned, settling over a patch of crowded clover. \"How many centuries will this assignment last?\"  \"This world is young,\" said Buos. \"It will take time.\"  \"But how long?\" she asked mournfully. \"Our world will be shrivelled and dead before these people have the knowledge to rescue us. Why can't we spend our lives here ...\"  \"And leave the others behind?\" said Buos stiffly. \"Selfish being,\" he said sadly. \"This world cannot support one-fourth our number.\"  \"Oh, I know, I know,\" Laloi said. \"I do not mean to say such things. I am twisted by my sorrow ...\" As if to express her self-abnegation, she corkscrewed out of the clover and into a thin spiral of near-nothingness.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Settle down, foolish one,\" said Buos, not unkindly. \"I know your feelings. Do you think I am not tormented as well, by the slow pace of these Earth-things? Crude, barbaric beings, like children with the building blocks of science. They have such a long way to go ...\"  \"And so few _know_,\" said Laloi despairingly. \"A handful of seeing minds, tens of millions of ignorant ones. Not even first principles--they're stupid, stupid!\"  \"But they will learn,\" Buos said stubbornly. \"That is historical fact. Someday, they will know the true meanings of matter and light and energy. Slowly, yes, slowly. But in terms of their growth, it will seem like great speed to them ...\"  \"And in terms of our world,\" said Laloi, spinning sadly over the ground, \"they may be far too late ...\"  \"No!\" In his excitement, Buos forgot himself and entwined with the flowing form of the she-creature, and the result was a rending of the air that cracked like heat lightning over the field. \"No,\" he repeated again. \"They must not be too late. They must learn. They must build from the very ground, and then they must fly. And then their eyes must be lifted to the stars, and desire must extend them to all the universe ...\"  \"It seems so hopeless--\"  \"It cannot be! Our destiny is not extinction. They must come to us, in fleets of silver, and replant our soil, and send towers of green shooting into our sky, breathing out air.\"  \"Yes, yes!\" Laloi cried pitifully. \"It will be that way, Buos. It will be that way! That man-creature, we will begin with him ...\"  Buos floated earthward disconsolately. \"He is a dreamer,\" he said cheerlessly. \"His mind is good; he thinks of tomorrow; he is one of the knowing ones. But he cannot be moved, Laloi. His thoughts may fester and die in the prison of his brain ...\"  \"No, they will not! We have watched him. He understands much. He will help us!\"  \"I have seen his like before,\" said Buos hopelessly. \"He thinks and he works, and his conclusions will die stillborn, for lack of a moving force ...\"  \"Then let us provide it, Buos. Let us move him!\"  \"With what?\" said the other disdainfully. \"Arms of nothing? Hands of vacuum? A breeze against his cheek? A rustle of leaves? A meaningless whistle in his ear?\"  \"Let us try. Let us try! This empty watchfulness is destroying us. Let us move him, Buos. Come!\"  Faster than the sky-sweeping clouds they flew, over the gently swelling hills, over the yearning branches of the trees, over the calm blue waters of the lakes. Swifter than the flight of birds they came, searching for a thinking mind ...  They found him at last.  \"He knows, he knows,\" said Laloi. \"Only now to say 'this is so because' and 'this must happen when'! Only to think--to understand--\"  They hovered over his head, in a pandemonium of helplessness. They whirled, and tumbled, and shrilly circled. And then to Laloi the inspiration came.  The apple, caught by a sudden gust of wind, twisted from the tenuous hold of the tree and fell to the ground.  The man, startled, picked it up.  He gazed at it, deep in thought.

Shea returns with this intriguing short-short predicting     a not too distant future where medicine, not content with     stimulating life and new growth in people who had already died, goes     on to further experiments which Baron von Frankenstein would have     found interesting._   resurrection  _by ROBERT J. SHEA_    They had been cramped for space, him and his people.  Obviously this new age had solved the problem better.   \"You're a fascinating person,\" the girl said. \"I've never met anyone like you before. Tell me your story again.\"  The man was short and stocky, with Asiatic features and a long, stringy mustache. \"The whole story?\" he asked. \"It would take a lifetime to tell you.\" He stared out the window at the yellow sun and the red sun. He still hadn't gotten used to seeing two suns. But that was minor, really, when there were so many other things he had to get used to.  A robot waiter, with long thin metal tubes for arms and legs, glided over. When he'd first seen one of those, he'd thought it was a demon. He'd tried to smash it. They'd had trouble with him at first.  \"They had trouble with me at first,\" he said.  \"I can imagine,\" said the girl. \"How did they explain it to you?\"  \"It was hard. They had to give me the whole history of medicine. It was years before I got over the notion that I was up in the Everlasting Blue Sky, or under the earth, or something.\" He grinned at the girl. She was the first person he'd met since they got him a job and gave him a home in a world uncountable light years from the one he'd been born on.  \"When did you begin to understand?\"  \"They simply taught all of history to me. Including the part about myself. Then I began to get the picture. Funny. I wound up teaching them a lot of history.\"  \"I bet you know a lot.\"  \"I do,\" the man with the Asiatic features said modestly. \"Anyway, they finally got across to me that in the 22nd century--they had explained the calendar to me, too; I used a different one in my day--they had learned how to grow new limbs on people who had lost arms and legs.\"  \"That was the first real step,\" said the girl.  \"It was a long time till they got to the second step,\" he said. \"They learned how to stimulate life and new growth in people who had already died.\"  \"The next part is the thing I don't understand,\" the girl said.  \"Well,\" said the man, \"as I get it, they found that any piece of matter that has been part of an organism, retains a physical 'memory' of the entire structure of the organism of which it was part. And that they could reconstruct that structure from a part of a person, if that was all there was left of him. From there it was just a matter of pushing the process back through time. They had to teach me a whole new language to explain that one.\"  \"Isn't it wonderful that intergalactic travel gives us room to expand?\" said the girl. \"I mean now that every human being that ever lived has been brought back to life and will live forever?\"  \"Same problem I had, me and my people,\" said the man. \"We were cramped for space. This age has solved it a lot better than I did. But they had to give me a whole psychological overhauling before I understood that.\"  \"Tell me about your past life,\" said the girl, staring dreamily at him.  \"Well, six thousand years ago, I was born in the Gobi Desert, on Earth,\" said Genghis Khan, sipping his drink.
