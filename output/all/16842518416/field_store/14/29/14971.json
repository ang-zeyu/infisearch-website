That's what we've got to do tomorrow, if we run that new flag up on the tower, and we might as well get our hands in first as last. Cole, you go on with Dick, and Rodney and I will follow.\"  Dick laughingly declared that as he was not spoiling for a fight he could get on very well without an escort, but still he did not raise any objection when Cole took him by the arm and led him away. Rodney slowly followed, with Billings for a companion, the latter using his best arguments to make the stubborn Rodney see that he could not hope to gain anything by showing so much hostility toward his cousin, who was popular both at the academy and in the town, and that the Taylor girls, from whom they had just parted, didn't think any the more of him for what he had said. Rodney saw that plainly, and it was another thing that made him angry; but he was careful not to let Billings know it. He took no little pride in his horsemanship, and was confident that he made a very fine looking sergeant of artillery; but none of the girls had ever told him so, and he couldn't bear to hear Marcy praised either. He was envious, as well as jealous, and when Rodney got that way, he was in the right humor to do something desperate.  \"That new law will fix him and Graham, too,\" he said to himself. \"I'll take pains to call their attention to it the minute I get back to the academy, and if they don't take the hint and make themselves scarce about here, I will set somebody on their track. There are a good many traitors in and around Barrington, and I wonder that they haven't been driven out before this time. I'll rid the school of those two, I bet you; but before they go I'll pick a quarrel with them and whip them out of their boots.\"  This confident assertion recalls to mind something that was said by the Confederate General Rosser on the morning of the 9th of October, 1864, just previous to the beginning of the fight known in history as \"Woodstock Races.\" Having formed his line of battle, Rosser sat on his horse watching the movements of his old schoolmate, General Custer, who was busy getting his own forces in shape to attack him. Finally Rosser turned to his staff and said:  \"You see that officer down there? That is General Custer, of whom the Yanks are so proud, and I intend to give him the best whipping to-day he ever got; see if I don't.\"  When Custer was ready to fight he made his charge; the valiant Rosser fled before it, and never but once stopped running until he reached Mount Jackson, twenty-six miles away. It was a trial of speed, rather than a battle, and that is the reason the engagement is called \"Woodstock Races.\" The Confederates lost everything they had that was carried on wheels, and the Union loss was but sixty killed and wounded. Rodney Gray was not as much of a braggart as Rosser was, but if he had tried to carry his threat into execution he might have been as badly whipped.                                  CHAPTER III.                     CHEERS FOR \"THE STARS AND BARS.\"  If any boy who reads this series of books believes that secession was the result of a sudden impulse on the part of the Southern people, he has but to look into his history to find that he is mistaken. They had not only been thinking about it for a long time, but, aided by some of Buchanan's treacherous cabinet officers, they had been preparing for it. The Secretary of the Navy ordered the best vessels in our little fleet to distant stations, so that they could not be called upon to help the government when the insurgents seized the forts that were scattered along the coast; and the Secretary of War took nearly a hundred and fifty thousand stand of arms out of Northern arsenals and sent them to the South. He did it openly and without any attempt at concealment, and the Southern papers publicly thanked him for so doing. The Mobile _Register_ said, in so many words, that they were much obliged to Mr. Floyd for \"disarming the North and equipping the South.\"  After such acts as these on the part of government officials, it is not surprising that private citizens began to take their local affairs into their own hands. A regular system of espionage and ostracism was established all over the South. Everybody who was known or suspected of being opposed to slavery and disunion was not only closely watched, but was denied admission to homes in which he had always been a welcome visitor. Free negroes were given to understand that they could either clear out, or remain and be sold into bondage. Northern men--even those who had long been engaged in business in the South, and whose interests were centered there--were looked upon and treated with contempt, and their lives were made miserable in every way that the exasperated and unreasonable people around them could think of.  But, of course, things did not stop here. These suspected persons very soon became the victims of open violence. Some were taken out of their houses at night and whipped; others were tarred and feathered; and more were hanged by self-appointed vigilance committees, or killed in personal encounters. Up to the time of which we write there had been none of this violence in and around Barrington, but it was coming now. Almost the first thing that attracted the attention of Rodney Gray and his companions when they went into the post-office was a notice that had been fastened upon the bulletin board. It took them a minute or two to elbow their way through the crowd of men and boys who were gathered in front of it, reading and commenting upon the startling intelligence it contained, and when they succeeded they read as follows:  IMPORTANT NOTICE.  At a meeting of the citizens and voters of Barrington, held this day, March 9, 1861, it was unanimously  _Resolved:_ That the excitement at present existing among the people renders it prudent for us to appoint a committee of the citizens of Barrington to recommend what measures (if any) should be adopted for the purpose of suppressing any unlawful or riotous outbreak in the town; and that the following named are hereby appointed a \"_Committee of Safety_\" who are respectfully requested to adopt such measures, or to recommend any measures for adoption by the citizens generally, as may seem to them proper and necessary for the preservation of good order.  Then followed a long list, containing the names of nearly all the prominent and wealthy men of the place.  \"Humph!\" exclaimed Dick Graham, contemptuously. \"The fellows who got this up wasted time and ink to no purpose. There has been no outbreak in Barrington, and none threatened.\"  \"How does it come that you are so well posted, Dick?\" said a friendly voice at his elbow; and when he faced about Dick's eyes met those of Mr. Riley, one of the men whose names appeared on the list. \"The gentlemen who framed that resolution did not mean to convey the impression that there had been any riotous proceedings in and around Barrington,\" he continued. \"But if they had desired to create an uproar and excite the fears of the women and children, they might have said that there has been an outbreak threatened; and it would have been nothing but the truth. You boys, who are all the while shut up in the academy, can not be expected to know all that is going on in the country.\"  \"Who has threatened any outbreak?\" inquired Dick incredulously. \"And when is it coming off?\"  \"Look here,\" said Mr. Riley, lowering his voice. \"You remember the John Brown raid, don't you?\"  \"Seems to me I have heard something about it. But you are not afraid of him, are you?\"  \"I am not joking,\" replied Mr. Riley earnestly. \"Brown laid out a regular campaign before he started in at Harper's Ferry. He had a map, and on it had marked several localities in which the negroes were greatly in excess of the whites. Those towns and villages were to be destroyed, after the blacks had been coaxed or forced into his army, and Barrington was one of them.\"  \"Well, what of it?\" exclaimed Dick. \"He didn't get here, did he?\"  \"Of course he didn't; but he spread such a spirit of discontent among the niggers that we have been shaky ever since. And the events of the last few weeks do not tend to quiet our fears, I assure you.\"  \"When is this insurrection, or whatever you call it, coming off?\"  \"We don't know when to expect it, but we mean to be ready for it at any hour of the day or night. We have positive evidence that there are about half a dozen too many Abolitionists, and altogether too many free niggers, in and around Barrington.\"  \"When did you find it out?\"  \"We've always known it; but we never felt so very much afraid of them before. I don't mind telling you, although I should not want to post it on the town pump, that we have had spies out for the last three or four days.\"  \"That's what I thought you were getting at. But who are they?\"  \"There's Bud Goble, for one.\"  \"Aw, Great Scott!\" exclaimed Dick, and even Rodney looked disgusted. \"I hope you haven't put the least faith in anything that lazy, worthless fellow has said to you.\"  \"He may be too lazy to earn an honest living, but he is far from worthless in an emergency like the present,\" replied the committeeman. \"He is with us all over, and has been very active since these troubles began.\"  \"I don't see why he should be so very active. He never owned the price of a pickaninny in his life. But I'll tell you what's a fact, Mr. Riley: Bud Goble has got something against every Northern man in Barrington and for miles outside of it, and he will do anything or swear to any number of lies--\"  \"Don't you give the Committee of Safety any credit for common-sense or prudence?\" demanded Rodney, who, although he appeared to be listening to the conversation, was busy thinking over a project that had suddenly suggested itself to him. \"You don't suppose that anything will be done to these suspected men until they have had a fair trial, do you?\"  \"That's the idea,\" said Mr."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28391"],["title","True To His Colors (#5)"],["body","ley, with a smile. \"Rodney, you have your share of common-sense, whether the committee have or not.\"  \"A fair trial?\" repeated Dick, who was like Marcy Gray in that he never \"pulled in his shingle one inch\"; in other words, never backed down from his principles, no matter who might hear what he had to say about them. \"Who'll try these suspected men? Judge Lynch; who will order them to be strung up before they can say a word in their own defense. I tell you such work is all wrong.\"  \"Don't let your excitement run away with your reason, Dick,\" said Mr. Riley soothingly. \"There's been no innocent person harmed yet, and, moreover, such a thing never happened in this county.\"  \"No, but it is going on all over the South; and I tell you that there are plenty of people of the Bud Goble stamp who would do the same thing right here if they were not afraid,\" said Dick earnestly.  \"Put him out! He's a traitor!\" cried one of the academy boys; and \"put him out,\" was echoed from all parts of the post-office. But the boys who uttered the words were all Dick Graham's friends, and an attempt to put him out would certainly have resulted disastrously to somebody.  \"Of course I understand that this is all sport,\" said Mr. Riley. \"But seriously, Dick, the time may come when it will be anything but safe for you to express your sentiments with so much freedom.\"  \"I assure you I appreciate your kindness in giving me a friendly word of caution, and thank you for it,\" replied the boy, \"but this is a free country, and I shall say what I think, regardless of consequences. Wait till the time for fighting comes and see--\"  \"See what?\" interrupted Billings. \"There isn't going to be any fighting.\"  \"Don't fool yourself. There'll be fighting before this thing is over, and more than you redhot secessionists will want to see--mark that! And when it comes we'll see who will do the most of it, I or men like Bud Goble, who have taken advantage of this time of excitement to get innocent folks into trouble.\"  Having had his talk out Dick turned to work his way to the window to get his mail; but before he got there a wild shout arose from the crowd of students who blocked his path, and a moment afterward a brand new Confederate flag fluttered over their heads. Rodney Gray had received a package from home and this was what he found in it.  \"I say, Graham,\" he exclaimed, as soon as he could make himself heard, \"doesn't the sight of this make you ashamed of the sentiments you have just uttered?\"  \"Not a bit of it,\" was the prompt response. \"Missouri hasn't recognized that flag yet. When she does, I will fight for it as long and as hard as you will.\"  \"Will you join us in a hurrah for it?\" continued Rodney.  \"No, I won't.\"  \"Three cheers for the Stars and Bars!\" shouted Ed Billings. \"Long may that flag wave, and may it never be polluted by the touch of a hated Yankee.\"  The cheers that followed were not cheers; they were whoops and yells--very much like those with which the charging Confederates so often saluted our blue-coats on the field of battle. Dick had half a notion to see if he could not get up a little counter-enthusiasm in behalf of the Stars and Stripes, but was afraid the attempt might result in failure; so after he had secured his mail, he went out on the porch and sat down to read those acts of the Confederate Congress calling for one hundred thousand volunteers, and ordering all who sympathized with the North to leave the limits of the Confederacy within ten days. His secession paper told him all about them, the editor enlarged upon and applauded them, and Dick was forced to the conclusion that things were getting serious; how serious, he little dreamed until four weeks more had passed away.  Dick spent half an hour over his paper and letters, and then Rodney Gray appeared. He had found a stick somewhere and fastened his flag to it. Although these two boys had had some sharp verbal contests during the last three months, they kept up an appearance of friendship, which was real so far as Dick Graham was concerned. The latter could not \"swallow Rodney's disunion doctrines,\" as he often declared, but for all that he had a sincere regard for him, and always spoke of him as one of the finest fellows in school. Perhaps we shall see whether or not Rodney paid him back in kind.  \"Give it a cheer, why don't you?\" said Rodney, waving his flag over Dick's head. \"Where in the world have you been?\"  \"Right here, waiting for you.\"  \"Well, come up the road a piece. There's a squad there, and we have been counting noses.\"  \"How many noses do you want, and what do you want them for?\" inquired Dick, putting his paper into his pocket and getting upon his feet. \"What new nonsense are you up to?\"  \"There's no nonsense about this, I tell you. It's business. We want as many noses as we can get, and the boys behind them must be true blue. The fellows said I would be wasting time if I came after you, but I want to hear you say so with your own lips before I shall believe it. You have said more than once that if Missouri goes out and joins the Confederacy, you will go with her, haven't you?\"  \"You bet, and I say so yet. My State, or any State, has the right to go out of the Union as she came into it--of her own free will; and if those fellows up North are going to fight to keep her in, I shall fight to help her out. That's me; but you see Missouri hasn't yet--\"  \"I have heard that until I am tired of it,\" interrupted Rodney. \"Missouri hasn't gone out yet, but she's going; and in the meantime, what about that flag at the academy? Are you in favor of letting it stay there?\"  \"That depends entirely upon the colonel,\" answered Dick. \"If he says haul her down, down she comes. If he says let her stay up, up she stays. That's me.\"  \"And will you continue to march and drill under it, now that we have a flag of our own?\" demanded Rodney.  \"That also depends. If the other boys drill under it and march after it, I will. In fact, I don't know but I shall do it any way, whether the others do or not. I don't know what you mean when you speak of a flag of our own. I don't recognize that thing you are carrying over your shoulder. The old flag is my flag, and will be as long as Missouri stays in the Union. I don't see the least use in rushing things. You and your friends are taking a good deal upon yourselves when you presume to act in advance of the State.\"  \"Well, you see what the business men of Barrington think of the situation, don't you? That notice in the post-office looks and sounds mighty innocent, but reading between the lines--\"  \"So you read between the lines!\" exclaimed Dick. \"I did the same, and I tell you that that Committee of Safety is a fraud. Bud Goble has been carrying tales about some innocent men whom, for personal reasons, he does not like, and Mr. Riley and a few other hotheads are trying to find some excuse for driving them out of town. There'll be outrages here the first thing you know and they will be committed under cover of that business men's meeting, and with the connivance of those whose names are signed to that list.\"  \"Do you mean to say that all those prominent men are such ruffians?\" cried Rodney, in great excitement. \"Why didn't you say as much when you were talking to Mr. Riley? You dared not do it.\"  \"I didn't think of it; but I will wait here while you run back and tell him.\"  Dick looked sharply at his companion as he said this, and was surprised to see the usually self-possessed Rodney turn as red as a beet. It was plain that he had been touched in some tender spot by these chance words.  \"What's he been up to?\" was the question Dick Graham propounded to himself. \"If I had known that I was going to hit him as hard as that, I wouldn't have said a word. He has been doing something sneaking, and I did not think that of Rodney Gray.\" Then aloud he said: \"I didn't mean to hint that you would do such a thing, but you have been about half-wild during the last few weeks, and I don't believe you know all the time what you are doing.\"  \"Well, if I'm crazy, I have the satisfaction of knowing that there are a good many like me in the South,\" replied Rodney, with a light laugh; and he uttered nothing but the truth. Taken as a body the Southern people certainly acted as if they had lost their senses. Among all those who rejoiced over South Carolina's reckless act there were few who saw that \"it was but the prelude to the most terrible tragedy of the age--the unchaining of a storm that was destined to shake the continent with terror and devastation, leaving the Southern States a wreck, and sweeping from the earth the institution in whose behalf the fatal work was done.\" You may be sure that Rodney Gray did not see this sad picture, for just at that moment there were few things he could see except the elegant silk banner that waved above his head, and which he was determined to hoist at the academy flag-staff the very next morning.  \"Here are the fellows,\" he added, as he and Dick came up with the squad who were gathered on a street corner waiting for them.  \"And a fine-looking lot of lads they are,\" was Dick's comment. \"Rebels the last one of them.\"  \"Washington was a rebel, young fellow,\" replied one of the students, \"and that is what he would be if he were with us to-day.\"  \"Well, seeing that he isn't here to decide the matter, don't let's waste time in talking about it,\" said Cole. \"The question is, Is that flag at the academy going to stay up or come down--which?\"  \"It's going to come down,\" replied Billings, very decidedly. \"We've got a handsomer flag to take its place. Let's cheer it, and see how many of that crowd on the other side of the street will take off their hats to it.\"  The cheers were given with a will; and this time Dick Graham joined in--not because he cared a cent for the Stars and Bars, but just to help make a noise. The result was all the boys could have desired. The cheers were answered and hats were lifted in all directions, and"]]]
