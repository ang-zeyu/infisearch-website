For though some stimuli, as of opium and alcohol, at the same time that they exhaust the sensorial power by promoting increase of fibrous action, may also increase the production or secretion of it in the brain, yet experience teaches us, that the exhaustion far out-balances the increased production, as is evinced by the general debility, which succeeds intoxication.  In respect to the fetor attending copious continued sweats, it is owing to the animalized part of this fluid being kept in that degree of warmth, which most favours putrefaction, and not suffered to exhale into the atmosphere. Broth, or other animal mucus, kept in similar circumstances, would in the same time acquire a putrid smell; yet has this error frequently produced miliary eruptions, and increased every kind of inflammatory or sensitive fever.  The ease, which the patient experiences during sweating, if it be not produced by much external heat, is similar to that of the warm bath; which by its stimulus applied to the cutaneous vessels, which are generally cooler than the internal parts of the system, excites them into greater action; and pleasureable sensation is the consequence of these increased actions of the vessels of the skin. From considering all these circumstances, it appears that it is not the evacuation by sweats, but the continued stimulus, which causes and supports those sweats, which is serviceable in preventing the returns of fever-fits. And that sweats too long continued, or induced by too great stimulus of warmth, clothes, or medicines, greatly injure the patient by increasing inflammation, or by exhausting the sensorial power. See Class I. 1. 2. 14.  _Secondly_, The sweats produced by exercise or labour are of the warm kind; as they originate from the increased action of the capillaries of the skin, owing to their being more powerfully stimulated by the greater velocity of the blood, and by a greater quantity of it passing through them in a given time. For the blood during violent exercise is carried forwards by the action of the muscles faster in the arteries, than it can be taken up by the veins; as appears by the redness of the skin. And from the consequent sweats, it is evinced, that the secretory vessels of the skin during exercise pour out the perspirable matter faster, than the mouths of the absorbent vessels can drink it up. Which mouths are not exposed to the increased muscular action, or to the stimulus of the increased velocity and quantity of the blood, but to the cool air.  _Thirdly_, the increased secretion of perspirable matter occasioned by the stimulus of external heat belongs likewise to this place; as it is caused by the increased motions of the capillary vessels; which thus separate from the blood more perspirable matter, than the mouths of their correspondent absorbent vessels can take up; though these also are stimulated by external heat into more energetic action. If the air be stationary, as in a small room, or bed with closed curtains, the sweat stands in drops on the skin for want of a quicker exhalation proportioned to the quicker secretion.  A _fourth_ variety of warm perspiration is that occasioned by stimulating drugs, of which opium and alcohol are the most powerful; and next to these the spices, volatile alkali, and neutral salts, especially sea salt; that much of the aqueous part of the blood is dissipated by the use of these drugs, is evinced by the great thirst, which occurs a few hours after the use of them. See Art. III. 2. 12. and Art. III. 2. 1.  We may from hence understand, that the increase of this secretion of perspirable matter by artificial means, must be followed by debility and emaciation. When this is done by taking much salt, or salted meat, the sea-scurvy is produced; which consists in the inirritability of the bibulous terminations of the veins arising from the capillaries; see Class I. 2. 1. 14. The scrophula, or inirritability of the lymphatic glands, seems also to be occasionally induced by an excess in eating salt added to food of bad nourishment. See Class I. 2. 3. 21. If an excess of perspiration is induced by warm or stimulant clothing, as by wearing flannel in contact with the skin in the summer months, a perpetual febricula is excited, both by the preventing the access of cool air to the skin, and by perpetually goading it by the numerous and hard points of the ends of the wool; which when applied to the tender skins of young children, frequently produce the red gum, as it is called; and in grown people, either an erysipelas, or a miliary eruption, attended with fever. See Class II. 1. 3. 12.  Shirts made of cotton or calico stimulate the skin too much by the points of the fibres, though less than flannel; whence cotton handkerchiefs make the nose sore by frequent use. The fibres of cotton are, I suppose, ten times shorter than those of flax, and the number of points in consequence twenty times the number; and though the manufacturers singe their calicoes on a red-hot iron cylinder, yet I have more than once seen an erysipelas induced or increased by the stimulus of calico, as well as of flannel.  The increase of perspiration by heat either of clothes, or of fire, contributes much to emaciate the body; as is well known to jockeys, who, when they are a stone or two too heavy for riding, find the quickest way to lessen their weight is by sweating themselves between blankets in a warm room; but this likewise is a practice by no means to be recommended, as it weakens the system by the excess of so general a stimulus, brings on a premature old age, and shortens the span of life; as may be further deduced from the quick maturity, and shortness of the lives, of the inhabitants of Hindostan, and other tropical climates.  M. Buffon made a curious experiment to shew this circumstance. He took a numerous brood of the butterflies of silkworms, some hundreds of which left their eggs on the same day and hour; these he divided into two parcels; and placing one parcel in the south window, and the other in the north window of his house, he observed, that those in the colder situation lived many days longer than those in the warmer one. From these observations it appears, that the wearing of flannel clothing next the skin, which is now so much in fashion, however useful it may be in the winter to those, who have cold extremities, bad digestions, or habitual coughs, must greatly debilitate them, if worn in the warm months, producing fevers, eruptions, and premature old age. See Sect. XXXVII. 5. Class I. 1. 2. 14. Art. III. 2. 1.  4. _Urina uberior colorata._ Copious coloured urine. Towards the end of fever-fits a large quantity of high coloured urine is voided, the kidneys continuing to act strongly, after the increased action of the absorbents of the bladder is somewhat diminished. If the absorbents continue also to act strongly, the urine is higher coloured, and so loaded as to deposit, when cool, an earthy sediment, erroneously thought to be the material cause of the disease; but is simply owing to the secretion of the kidnies being great from their increased action; and the thinner parts of it being absorbed by the increased action of the lymphatics, which are spread very thick on the neck of the bladder; for the urine, as well as perhaps all the other secreted fluids, is produced from the kidnies in a very dilute state; as appears in those, who from the stimulus of a stone, or other cause, evacuate their urine too frequently; which is then pale from its not having remained in the bladder long enough for the more aqueous part to have been reabsorbed. The general use of this urinary absorption to the animal oeconomy is evinced from the urinary bladders of fish, which would otherwise be unnecessary. High coloured urine in large quantity shews only, that the secreting vessels of the kidnies, and the absorbents of the bladder, have acted with greater energy. When there is much earthy sediment, it shews, that the absorbents have acted proportionally stronger, and have consequently left the urine in a less dilute state. In this urine the transparent sediment or cloud is mucous; the opake sediment is probably coagulable lymph from the blood changed by an animal or chemical process. The floating scum is oil. The angular concretions to the sides of the pot, formed as the urine cools, is microcosmic salt. Does the adhesive blue matter on the sides of the glass, or the blue circle on it at the edge of the upper surface of the urine, consist of Prussian blue?  5. _Diarrhoea calida._ Warm diarrhoea. This species may be divided into three varieties deduced from their remote causes, under the names of diarrhoea febrilis, diarrhoea crapulosa, and diarrhoea infantum. The febrile diarrhoea appears at the end of fever-fits, and is erroneously called critical, like the copious urine, and the sweats; whereas it arises from the increased action of those secerning organs, which pour their fluids into the intestinal canal (as the liver, pancreas, and mucous glands), continuing longer than the increased action of the intestinal absorbents. In this diarrhoea there is no appearance of curdled chyle in the stools, as occurs in cholera. I. 3. 1. 5.  The _diarrhoea crapulosa_, or diarrhoea from indigestion, occurs when too great a quantity of food or liquid has been taken; which not being compleatly digested, stimulates the intestines like any other extraneous acrid material; and thus produces an increase of the secretions into them of mucus, pancreatic juice, and bile. When the contents of the bowels are still more stimulant, as when drastic purges, or very putrescent diet, have been taken, a cholera is induced. See Sect. XXIX. 4.  The _diarrhoea infantum_, or diarrhoea of infants, is generally owing to too great acidity in their bowels. Milk is found curdled in the stomachs of all animals, old as well as young, and even of carnivorous ones, as"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27600"],["title","Zoonomia; Or, the Laws of Organic Life, Vol. II (#5)"],["body"," hawks. (Spallanzani.) And it is the gastric juice of the calf, which is employed to curdle milk in the process of making cheese. Milk is the natural food for children, and must curdle in their stomachs previous to digestion; and as this curdling of the milk destroys a part of the acid juices of the stomach, there is no reason for discontinuing the use of it, though it is occasionally ejected in a curdled state. A child of a week old, which had been taken from the breast of its dying mother, and had by some uncommon error been suffered to take no food but water-gruel, became sick and griped in twenty-four hours, and was convulsed on the second day, and died on the third! When all young quadrupeds, as well as children, have this natural food of milk prepared for them, the analogy is so strong in favour of its salubrity, that a person should have powerful testimony indeed of its disagreeing, before he advises the discontinuance of the use of it to young children in health, and much more so in sickness. The farmers lose many of their calves, which are brought up by gruel, or gruel and old milk; and among the poor children of Derby, who are thus fed, hundreds are starved into the scrophula, and either perish, or live in a state of wretched debility.  When young children are brought up without a breast, they should for the first two months have no food but new milk; since the addition of any kind of bread or flour is liable to ferment, and produce too much acidity; as appears by the consequent diarrhoea with green dejections and gripes; the colour is owing to a mixture of acid with the natural quantity of bile, and the pain to its stimulus. And they should never be fed as they lie upon their backs, as in that posture they are necessitated to swallow all that is put into their mouths; but when they are fed, as they are sitting up, or raised up, when they have had enough, they can permit the rest to run out of their mouths. This circumstance is of great importance to the health of those children, who are reared by the spoon, since if too much food is given them, indigestion, and gripes, and diarrhoea, is the consequence; and if too little, they become emaciated; and of this exact quantity their own palates judge the best.  M. M. In this last case of the diarrhoea of children, the food should be new milk, which by curdling destroys part of the acid, which coagulates it. Chalk about four grains every six hours, with one drop of spirit of hartshorn, and half a drop of laudanum. But a blister about the size of a shilling is of the greatest service by restoring the power of digestion. See Article III. 2. 1. in the subsequent Materia Medica.  6. _Salivatio calida._ Warm salivation. Increased secretion of saliva. This may be effected either by stimulating the mouth of the gland by mercury taken internally; or by stimulating the excretory duct of the gland by pyrethrum, or tobacco; or simply by the movement of the muscles, which lie over the gland, as in masticating any tasteless substance, as a lock of wool, or mastic.  In about the middle of nervous fevers a great spitting of saliva sometimes occurs, which has been thought critical; but as it continues sometimes two or even three weeks without the relief of the patient, it may be concluded to arise from some accidental circumstance, perhaps not unsimilar to the hysteric ptyalisms mentioned in Class I. 3. 2. 2. See Sect. XXIV.  M. M. Cool air, diluents, warm bath, evacuations.  7. _Catharrhus calidus._ Warm catarrh. Consists in an increased secretion of mucus from the nostrils without inflammation. This disease, which is called a cold in the head, is frequently produced by cold air acting for some time on the membranes, which line the nostrils, as it passes to the lungs in respiration. Whence a torpor of the action of the mucous glands is first introduced, as in I. 2. 3. 3. and an orgasm or increased action succeeds in consequence. Afterwards this orgasm and torpor are liable to alternate with each other for some time like the cold and hot fits of ague, attended with deficient or exuberant secretion of mucus in the nostrils.  At other times it arises from reverse sympathy with some extensive parts of the skin, which have been exposed too long to cold, as of the head, or feet. In consequence of the torpor of these cutaneous capillaries those of the mucous membrane of the nostrils act with greater energy by reverse sympathy; and thence secrete more mucus from the blood. At the same time the absorbents, acting also with greater energy by their reverse sympathy with those of some distant part of the skin, absorb the thinner parts of the mucus more hastily; whence the mucus is both thicker and in greater quantity. Other curious circumstances attend this disease; the membrane becomes at times so thickened by its increased action in secreting the mucus, that the patient cannot breathe through his nostrils. In this situation if he warms his whole skin suddenly by fire or bed-clothes, or by drinking warm tea, the increased action of the membrane ceases by its reverse sympathy with the skin; or by the retraction of the sensorial power to other parts of the system; and the patient can breathe again through the nostrils. The same sometimes occurs for a time on going into the cold air by the deduction of heat from the mucous membrane, and its consequent inactivity or torpor. Similar to this when the face and breast have been very hot and red, previous to the eruption of the small-pox by inoculation, and that even when exposed to cool air, I have observed the feet have been cold; till on covering them with warm flannel, as the feet have become warm, the face has cooled. See Sect. XXXV. 1. 3. Class II. 1. 3. 5. IV. 2. 2. 10. IV. 1. 1. 5.  M. M. Evacuations, abstinence, oil externally on the nose, warm diluent fluids, warm shoes, warm night-cap.  8. _Expectoratio calida._ Warm expectoration consists of the increased secretion of mucus from the membrane, which lines the bronchiæ, or air-cells of the lungs, without inflammation. This increased mucus is ejected by the action of coughing, and is called a cold, and resembles the catarrh of the preceding article; with which it is frequently combined.  M. M. Inhale the steam of warm water, evacuations, warm bath, afterwards opium, sorbentia.  9. _Exsudatio pone aures._ A discharge behind the ears. This chiefly affects children, and is a morbid secretion; as appears from its fetor; for if it was owing to defect of absorption, it would be saline, and not fetid; if a morbid action has continued a considerable time, it should not be stopped too suddenly; since in that case some other morbid action is liable to succeed in its stead. Thus children are believed to have had cholics, or even convulsions, consequent to the too sudden healing of these morbid effusions behind their ears. The rationale of this is to be explained from a medical fact, which I have frequently observed; and that is, that a blister on the back greatly strengthens the power of digestion, and removes the heart-burn in adults, and green stools in children. The stimulus of the blister produces sensation in the vessels of the skin; with this additional sensorial power these vessels act more strongly; and with these the vessels of the internal membranes of the stomach and bowels act with greater energy from their direct sympathy with them. Now the acrid discharge behind the ears of children produces sensation on that part of the skin, and so far acts as a small blister. When this is suddenly stopped, a debility of the digestive power of the stomach succeeds from the want of this accustomed stimulus, with flatulency, green stools, gripes, and sometimes consequent convulsions. See Class II. 1. 5. 6. and II. 1. 4. 6.  M. M. If the matter be absorbed, and produces swelling of the lymphatics of the neck, it should be cured as soon as possible by dusting the part with white lead, cerussa, in very fine powder; and to prevent any ill consequence an issue should be kept for about a month in the arm; or a purgative medicine should be taken, every other day for three or four times, which should consist of a grain of calomel, and three or four grains of rhubarb, and as much chalk. If there be no appearance of absorption, it is better only to keep the parts clean by washing them with warm water morning and evening; or putting fuller's earth on them; especially till the time of toothing is past. The tinea, or scald head, and a leprous eruption, which often appears behind the ears, are different diseases.  10. _Gonorrhea calida._ Warm gleet. Increased discharge of mucus from the urethra or prostrate gland without venereal desire, or venereal infection. See Class I. 2. 3. 8.  M. M. Cantharides, balsams, rhubarb, blister in perinæum, cold bath, injections of metallic salts, flannel shirt, change of the form of the accustomed chair or saddle of the patient.  11. _Fluor albus calidus._ Warm fluor albus. Increased secretion of mucus in the vagina or uterus without venereal desire or venereal infection. It is distinguished from the fluor albus frigidus by the increased sense of warmth in the part, and by the greater opacity or spissitude of the material discharged; as the thinner parts are reabsorbed by the increased action of the absorbents, along with the saline part, whence no smarting or excoriation attends it.  M. M. Mucilage, as isinglass, hartshorn jelly, gum arabic. Ten grains of rhubarb every night. Callico or flannel shift, opium, balsams. See Class I. 2. 3. 7.  12. _Hæmorrhois alba._ White piles. An increased discharge of mucus from the rectum frequently mistaken for matter; is said to continue a few weeks, and recur like the bleeding piles; and to obey lunar influence. See Class I. 2. 1. 6.  M. M. Abstinence from vinous spirit. Balsam of copaiva. Spice swallowed in large fragments, as ten or fifteen black pepper-corns cut in half, and taken after dinner and supper. Ward's paste, consisting of"]]]
