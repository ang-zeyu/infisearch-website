Take a short length of quill tubing and draw out one end into a roomy capillary stem, and again draw out the extremity into a fine hair point, thus forming a small Pasteur pipette with a hair-like capillary extremity.  2. With a standard pipette fill 100 c. mm. into the neck of this pipette, and make a scratch with a writing diamond at the upper level (a) of the mercury meniscus (Fig. 19, A).  [Illustration: FIG. 19.--Making throttle pipettes--large capacity]  Now force the mercury down into the capillary stem as far as it will go, so as to leave the upper part of the tube in the region of the diamond scratch empty (Fig. 19, B).  3. Heat the tube in the region of the diamond scratch in the blowpipe flame, and removing the tube from the flame draw it out so that the diamond scratch now occupies a position somewhere near the centre of this new capillary portion (Fig. 19, C).  4. Heat the tube in this position in the peep flame of the Bunsen burner, and draw it out into a hair-like extremity. Snap off the glass tube, leaving about 5 mm. of hair-like extremity attached to the upper capillary portion (Fig. 19, D). Allow the glass to cool.  5. Lift up the bulb by the long capillary stem and allow the mercury to return to its original position--an operation which will be facilitated by snapping off the hair-like extremity from the long piece of capillary tubing.  6. Mark on the capillary stem with a grease pencil the position of the end of the column of mercury (Fig. 19, E.)  7. Warm the capillary tubing at this spot in the peep flame of the Bunsen burner, and draw it out very slightly so that when cut at this position a pointed extremity will be obtained.  8. With a glass-cutting knife cut the capillary tube through at the point \"b,\" and allow the mercury to run out.  9. Now apply a thick layer of sealing wax to the neck of the bulb.  10. Take a piece of 5 mm. bore glass tubing and draw it out as if making an ordinary Pasteur pipette.  11. Break the capillary portion off so as to leave a covering tube similar to that already used for the smaller graduated pipettes. Into this covering tube drop the graduated bulb and draw the capillary stem down through the conical extremity until further progress is stopped by the layer of sealing wax.  12. Warm the pipette in the gas flame so as to melt the sealing wax and make an air-tight joint.  13. Fit an india-rubber teat over the open end of the covering tube, and the automatic pipette is ready for use (Fig. 19, F).  ~Sedimentation Pipettes~ (Fig. 20).--These are prepared from 10 cm. lengths of narrow glass tubing by sealing one extremity, blowing a small bulb at the centre, and plugging the open end with cotton-wool; after sterilisation the open end is provided with a short piece of rubber tubing and a glass mouthpiece. When it is necessary to observe sedimentation reactions in very small quantities of fluid, these tubes will be found much more convenient than the 5 by 0.5 cm. test-tubes previously mentioned.  [Illustration: FIG. 20.--Sedimentation pipette.]  Pasteur pipettes fitted with india-rubber teats will also be found useful for sedimentation tests when dealing with minute quantities of serum, etc.  [Illustration: FIG. 21.--Fermentation tubes.]  ~Fermentation Tubes~ (Fig. 21).--These are used for the collection and analysis of the gases liberated from the media during the growth of some varieties of bacteria and may be either plain (a) or graduated (b). A simple form (Fig. 21, c) may be made from 14 cm. lengths of soft glass tubing of 1.5 cm. diameter. The Bunsen flame is applied to a spot some 5 cm. from one end of such a piece of tubing and the tube slightly drawn out to form a constriction, the constricted part is bent in the bat's-wing flame, to an acute angle, and the open extremity of the long arm sealed off in the blowpipe flame. The open end of the short arm is rounded off and then plugged with cotton-wool, and the tube is ready for sterilisation.   CLEANING OF GLASS APPARATUS.  All glassware used in the bacteriological laboratory must be thoroughly cleaned before use, and this rule applies as forcibly to new as to old apparatus, although the methods employed may vary slightly.  ~To Clean New Test-tubes.~--  1. Place the tubes in a bucket or other convenient receptacle, fill with water and add a handful of \"Sapon\" or other soap powder. See that the tubes are full and submerged.  2. Fix the bucket over a large Bunsen flame and boil for thirty minutes--or boil in the autoclave for a similar period.  3. Cleanse the interior of the tubes with the aid of test-tube brushes, and rinse thoroughly in cold water.  4. Invert the tubes and allow them to drain completely.  5. Dry the tubes and polish the glass inside and out with a soft cloth, such as selvyt.  ~New flasks, plates, and capsules~ must be cleaned in a similar manner.  ~To Clean New Graduated Pipettes.~--  1. Place the pipettes in a convenient receptacle, filled with water to which soap powder has been added.  2. Boil the water vigorously for twenty minutes over a Bunsen flame.  3. Rinse the pipettes in running water and drain.  4. Run distilled water through the pipettes and drain.  5. Run rectified spirits through the pipette and drain as completely as possible.  6. Place the pipettes in the hot-air oven (_vide_ page 31), close the door, open the ventilating slide, and run the temperature slowly up to about 80° C. Turn off the gas and allow the oven to cool.  Or 6a. Attach each pipette in turn to the rubber tube of the foot bellows, or blowpipe air-blast, and blow air through the pipette until the interior is dry.  Glassware that has already been used is regarded as _infected_, and is treated in a slightly different manner.  ~Infected Test-tubes.~--  1. Pack the tubes in the wire basket of the autoclave (having previously removed the cotton-wool plugs, caps, etc.), in the vertical position, and before replacing the basket see that there is a sufficiency of water in the bottom of the boiler. Now attach a piece of rubber tubing to the nearest water tap, and by means of this fill each tube with water.  2. Disinfect completely by exposing the tubes, etc., to a temperature of 120° C. for twenty minutes (_vide_ page 37).  (If an autoclave is not available, the tubes must be placed in a digester, or even a large pan or pail with a tightly fitting cover, and boiled vigorously for some thirty to forty-five minutes to ensure disinfection.)  3. Whilst still hot, empty each tube in turn and roughly clean its interior with a stiff test-tube brush.  4. Place the tubes in a bucket or other convenient receptacle, fill with water and add a handful of Sapon or other soap powder. See that the tubes are full and submerged.  5. Fix the bucket over a large Bunsen flame and boil for thirty minutes.  6. Cleanse the interior of the tubes with the aid of test-tube brushes, and rinse thoroughly in cold water.  7. Drain off the water and immerse tubes in a large jar containing water acidulated with 2 to 5 per cent. hydrochloric acid. Allow them to remain there for about fifteen minutes.  8. Remove from the acid jar, drain, rinse thoroughly in running water, then with distilled water.  9. Invert the tubes and allow them to drain completely.  Dry the tubes and polish the glass inside and out with a soft cloth, such as selvyt.  ~Infected flasks, plates, and capsules~ must be treated in a similar manner.  ~Flasks~ which have been used only in the preparation of media must be cleaned immediately they are finished with. Fill each flask with water to which some soap powder and a few crystals of potassium permanganate have been added, and let boil over the naked flame. The interior of the flask can then usually be perfectly cleaned with the aid of a flask brush, but in some cases water acidulated with 5 per cent. nitric acid, or a large wad of wet cotton-wool previously rolled in silver sand, must be shaken around the interior of the flask, after which rinse thoroughly with clean water, dry, and polish.   ~Infected Pipettes.~--  1. Plunge infected pipettes immediately after use into tall glass cylinders containing a 2 per cent. solution of lysol, and allow them to remain therein for some days.  2. Remove from the jar and drain. Boil in water to which a little soap has been added, for thirty minutes.  3. Rinse thoroughly in cold water.  4. Immerse in 5 per cent. nitric acid for an hour or two.  5. Rinse again in running water to remove all traces of acid.  6. Complete the cleaning as described under \"new pipettes.\"  When dealing with graduated capillary pipettes employed for blood or serum work (whether new or infected), much time is consumed in the various steps from 5 onward, and the cleansing process can be materially hastened if the following device is adopted.  Fit up a large-sized Kitasato's filter flask to a Sprengel's suction pump or a Geryk air pump (see page 43). To the side tubulure of the filter flask attach a 20 cm. length of rubber pressure tubing having a calibre sufficiently large to admit the ends of the pipettes.  Next fill a small beaker with distilled water. Attach the first pipette to the free end of the rubber tubing, place the pipette point downward in the beaker of water and start the pump (Fig. 22).  [Illustration: FIG. 22.--Cleaning blood pipettes.]  When all the water has been aspirated through the pipette into the filter flask, fill the beaker with rectified spirit and when this is exhausted refill with ether. Detach the pipette and dry in the hot-air oven.  ~Slides and cover-slips~ (Fig. 23), when first purchased, have \"greasy\" surfaces, upon which water gathers in minute drops and effectually prevents the spreading of thin, even films.  ~Microscopical Slides.~--The slides in general use are those known as \"three by one\" slips (measuring 3 inches by 1 inch, or 76 by 26 mm.), and should be of good white crown glass, with ground edges.  ~New slides~ should be allowed to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27713"],["title","The Elements of Bacteriological Technique (#4)"],["body","in alcohol acidulated with 5 per cent. hydrochloric acid for some hours, rinsed in running water, roughly drained on a towel, dried, and finally polished with a selvyt cloth.  [Illustration: FIG. 23.--Slides and cover-slips, actual size.]  If only a few slides are required for immediate use a good plan is to rub the surface with jeweler's emery paper (Hubert's 00). A piece of hard wood 76×26×26 mm. with a piece of this emery paper gummed tightly around it is an exceedingly useful article on the microscope bench.  ~Cover-slips.~--The most useful sizes are the 19 mm. squares for ordinary cover-glass film preparations, and 38 by 19 mm. rectangles for blood films and serial sections; both varieties must be of \"No. 1\" thickness, which varies between 0.15 and 0.22 mm., that they may be available for use with the high-power immersion lenses.  Cover-slips should be cleaned in the following manner:  1. Drop the cover-slips one by one into an enamelled iron pot or tall glass beaker, containing a 10 per cent. solution of chromic acid.  2. Heat over a Bunsen flame and allow the acid to boil gently for twenty minutes.       NOTE.--A few pieces of pipe-clay or pumice may be placed in      the beaker to prevent the \"spurting\" of the chromic acid.  3. Turn the cover-slips out into a flat glass dish and wash in running water under the tap until all trace of yellow colour has disappeared. During the washing keep the cover-slips in motion by imparting a rotatory movement to the dish.  4. Wash in distilled water in a similar manner.  5. Wash in rectified spirit.  6. Transfer the cover-slips, by means of a pair of clean forceps, previously heated in the Bunsen flame to destroy any trace of grease, to a small beaker of absolute alcohol.  Drain off the alcohol and transfer the cover-slips, by means of the forceps, to a wide-mouthed glass pot, containing absolute alcohol, in which they are to be stored, and stopper tightly.       NOTE.--After once being placed in the chromic acid, the      cover-slips must on no account be touched by the fingers.  ~Used Slides and Cover-slips.~--Used slides with the mounted cover-slip preparations, and cover-slips used for hanging-drop mounts, should, when discarded, be thrown into a pot containing a 2 per cent. solution of lysol.  After immersion therein for a week or so, even the cover-slips mounted with Canada balsam can be readily detached from their slides.   _Slides._--  1. Wash the slides thoroughly in running water.  2. Boil the slides in water to which \"sapon\" has been added, for half an hour.  3. Rinse thoroughly in cold water.  4. Dry and polish with a dry cloth.   _Cover-slips._--  1. Wash the cover-slips thoroughly in running water.  2. Boil the cover-slips in 10 per cent. solution of chromic acid, as for new cover-slips.  3. Wash thoroughly in running water.  4. Pick out those cover-slips which show much adherent dirty matter, and rub them between thumb and forefinger under the water tap. The dirt usually rubs off easily, as it has become friable from contact with the chromic acid.  5. Return all the cover-slips to the beaker, fill in _fresh_ chromic acid solution, and treat as new cover-slips.       NOTE.--_Test-tubes, plates, capsules_, etc., which, from      long use, have become scratched and hazy, or which cannot be      cleaned in any other way, may be dealt with by immersing      them in an enamelled iron bath, containing water acidulated      to 1 per cent. with hydrofluoric acid, for ten minutes,      rinsing thoroughly in water, drying, and polishing.   PLUGGING TEST-TUBES AND FLASKS.  Before sterilisation all test-tubes and flasks must be carefully plugged with cotton-wool, and for this purpose best absorbent cotton-wool (preferably that put up in cylindrical one-pound packets and interleaved with tissue paper--known as surgeons' wool) should be employed.  1. For a test-tube or a small flask, tear a strip of cotton-wool some 10 cm. long by 2 cm. wide from the roll.  2. Turn in the ends neatly and roll the strip of wool lightly between the thumb and fingers of both hands to form a long cylinder.  3. Double this at the centre and introduce the now rounded end into the open mouth of the tube or flask.  4. Now, whilst supporting the wool between the thumb and fingers of the right hand, rotate the test-tube between those of the left, and gradually screw the plug of wool into its mouth for a distance of about 2.5 cm., leaving about the same length of wool projecting.  [Illustration: FIG 24..--Plugging test-tubes: a, cylinder of wool being rolled; b, cylinder of wool being doubled; c, cylinder of wool being inserted in tube.]  The plug must be firm and fit the tube or flask fairly tightly, sufficiently tightly in fact to bear the weight of the glass plus the amount of medium the vessel is intended to contain, but not so tightly as to prevent it from being easily removed by a screwing motion when grasped between the fourth, or third and fourth, fingers, and the palm of the hand.  For a large flask a similar but larger strip of wool must be taken; the method of making and inserting the plug is identical.     III. METHODS OF STERILISATION.   STERILISING AGENTS.  Sterilisation--i. e., the removal or the destruction of germ life--may be effected by the use of various agents. As applied to the practical requirements of the bacteriological laboratory, many of these agents, such as electricity, sunlight, etc., are of little value, others are limited in their applications; others again are so well suited to particular purposes that their use is almost entirely restricted to such.  The sterilising agents in common use are:  ~Chemical Reagents.~--_Disinfectants_ (for the disinfection of glass and metal apparatus and of morbid tissues).  ~Physical Agents.~ HEAT.--(a) _Dry Heat:_  1. Naked flame (for the sterilisation of platinum needles, etc.).  2. Muffle furnace (for the sterilisation of filter candles, and for the destruction of morbid tissues).  3. Hot air (for the sterilisation of all glassware and of metal apparatus).  (b) _Moist Heat:_  1. Water at 56° C. (for the sterilisation of certain albuminous fluids).  2. Water at 100° C. (for the sterilisation of surgical instruments, rubber tubing, and stoppers, etc.).  3. Streaming steam at 100° C. (for the sterilisation of media).  4. Superheated steam at 115° C. or 120° C. (for the disinfection of contaminated articles and the destruction of old cultivations of bacteria).  FILTRATION.--  1. Cotton-wool filters (for the sterilisation of air and gases).  2. Porcelain filters (for the sterilisation of various liquids).   METHODS OF APPLICATION.  ~Chemical Reagents~, such as belong to the class known as antiseptics (_i. e._, substances which inhibit the growth of, but do not destroy, bacterial life), are obviously useless. Disinfectants or germicides (_i. e._, substances which destroy bacterial life), on the other hand, are of value in the disinfection of morbid material, and also of various pieces of apparatus, such as pipettes, pending their cleansing and complete sterilisation by other processes. To this class (in order of general utility) belong:      Lysol, 2 per cent. solution;     Perchloride of mercury, 0.1 per cent. solution;     Carbolic acid, 5 per cent. solution;     Absolute alcohol;     Ether;     Chloroform;     Camphor;     Thymol;     Toluol;     Volatile oils, such as oil of mustard, oil of garlic.  Formaldehyde is a powerful germicide, but its penetrating vapor restricts its use. These disinfectants are but little used in the final sterilisation of apparatus, chiefly on account of the difficulty of effecting their complete removal, for the presence of even traces of these chemicals is sufficient to so inhibit or alter the growth of bacteria as to vitiate subsequent experiments conducted by the aid of apparatus sterilised in this manner.       NOTE.--Tubes, flasks, filter flasks, pipettes, glass tubing,      etc., may be rapidly sterilised, in case of emergency, by      washing, in turn, with distilled water, perchloride of      mercury solution, alcohol, and ether, draining, and finally      gently heating over a gas flame to completely drive off the      ether vapor. Chloroform or other volatile disinfectants may      be added to various fluids in order to effect the      destruction of contained bacteria, and when this has been      done, may be completely driven off from the fluid by the      application of gentle heat.  ~Dry Heat.~--The _naked flame_ of the Bunsen burner is invariably used for sterilising the platinum needles (which are heated to redness) and may be employed for sterilising the points of forceps, or other small instruments, cover-glasses, pipettes, etc., a very short exposure to this heat being sufficient.  _Ether Flame._--In an emergency small instruments, needles, etc., may be sterilised by dipping them in ether and after removal lighting the adherent fluid and allowing it to burn off the surface of the instruments. Repeat the process twice. It may then be safely assumed that the apparatus so treated is sterile.  [Illustration: FIG. 25.--Muffle furnace.]  _Muffle Furnace_ (Fig. 25).--Although this form of heat is chiefly used for the destruction of the dead bodies of small infected animals, morbid tissues, etc., it is also employed for the sterilisation of porcelain filter candles (_vide_ p. 42).  Filter candles are disinfected immediately after use by boiling in a beaker of water for some fifteen or twenty minutes. This treatment, however, leaves the dead bodies of the bacteria upon the surface and blocking the interstices of the filter.  To destroy the organic matter and prepare the filter candle for further use proceed as follows:  1. Roll each bougie up in a piece of asbestos cloth, secure the ends of the cloth with a few turns of copper wire, and place inside the muffle (a small muffle 76×88×163 mm. will hold perhaps four small filter candles).  2. Light the gas and raise the contents of the"]]]
