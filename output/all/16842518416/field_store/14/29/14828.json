We here come to the rabbit, one of our innocent and harmless friends that is a great pet with children. It is very timid and easily scared, but when treated kindly it becomes tame.  2. The rabbit is about the size of a cat, and has a short tail. The wild gray rabbit is not so large as the tame rabbit which we have about the house.  3. The rabbit has sharp gnawing-teeth like the rat and mouse, and it gets its food and eats it in the same way.  4. It eats the leaves and stalks of plants, and is very fond of cabbage, lettuce, and the tender leaves of beets and turnips. It sometimes does much damage by gnawing the bark of young fruit-trees.  5. It has whiskers like the cat, so that it can crawl into holes without making a noise.  6. Its fore feet are armed with strong, blunt claws. It can not climb, but it is able to dig holes in the earth.  7. Our wild rabbit lives in the grass, or in holes which it finds in stumps and hollow trees, and among stones; but the English rabbit digs a hole in the soft ground for its home.  8. The holes that the rabbits dig are called _burrows_; and where a great many rabbits have burrows close together, the place where they live is called a _warren_.  9. The burrows have two or more doors, so that if a weasel or some other enemy goes in at one door, the rabbit runs out at the other. In a warren, many burrows open into one another, forming quite a village under ground.  10. The rabbits choose a sandy place for a warren, near a bank, where they can dig easily, and where the water will run off. In these homes they sleep most of the time during the day, and come out by night to feed on such plants as they can find. When wild, the dew gives them drink enough; but when fed with dry grain food, they need water.     LESSON XXXV.  _MORE ABOUT RABBITS._  [Illustration]   1. The rabbit has large ears, and can hear the slightest sound. When feeding or listening, the ears stand up or lean forward; but when running, the ears lie back on its neck.  2. When the rabbit hears any sound to alarm it, it never stops to see what is the matter, but scuds away to its hole, plunges in, and waits there until it thinks the danger has passed away.  3. Then it comes to the mouth of the burrow, and puts out its long ears. If it does not hear anything, it raises its head a little more, and peeps out. Then, if it does not see anything out of the way, it comes out again and begins to feed.  4. Rabbits increase so fast that if they were not kept down they would soon eat up all the plants of our gardens and fields. So a great many animals and birds feed upon them, and a great many are killed for their meat and fur.  5. When first born, the little rabbits are blind, like puppies and kittens, and their bodies are naked. The mother rabbit makes a warm nest for them of dried leaves, and she lines it with fur from her own body.  6. In about ten or twelve days the little rabbits are able to see, and in a few weeks more they are quite able to take care of themselves.  7. The rabbits that we have for pets are of various colors, but mostly white or black, or part white and part black. They do not dig into the earth as the wild ones do, but they love to have their homes in snug little places, like holes.  8. The hind legs of the rabbit are longer than its fore ones, and, instead of walking, it hops along. When it runs, it springs forward with great leaps, and gets over the ground very fast.  9. Pet rabbits that have large ears sell most readily. One of the rabbits, in the picture, looks very curious with one long ear lopped down over his eye, and the other standing up straight.  10. When they live out in the woods and fields, rabbits have many cruel foes. One of the worst of these is the owl, who, prowling about in the dark, springs upon the poor rabbit, and breaks its neck with one fierce stroke of its sharp bill.  11. As a rabbit can not defend itself by fighting, it has long ears to detect danger, and swift feet to get away from an enemy. When alarmed, away it goes, with a hop, skip, and jump, and like a flash passes out of sight.  [Illustration]     LESSON XXXVI.  _HOW THE HARE LIVES._  [Illustration]   1. The hare looks very much like a large rabbit. It has the same kind of teeth, and eats the same kind of food. Its legs are longer than those of the rabbit, and it runs in the same way, only faster.  2. It does not burrow in the ground nor crawl into holes, but it makes its home in tufts of long grass. As it lies in the same place for a long time, it makes a little hollow, which is called its _form_.  3. It has larger ears than the rabbit, and seems always listening. It is very timid, and, when it hears any strange sound, away it goes like the wind, running with long leaps.  4. When at rest in its form, it folds its legs under its body, lays its ears back flat on its neck; and, as it is of the color of dried grass, a person may pass by within a few feet of it and not see it.  5. Its upper lip is divided in the middle, as is also that of the rabbit. It sometimes will fight, and then it hits hard blows with its fore feet, and strikes so fast that its blows sound like the roll of a drum.  6. When the snow falls, the hare sits in its form, and is covered up. But its fur keeps it warm, and the heat of its body melts the snow next to its skin, so that it sits in a kind of snow-cave, the snow keeping off the cold wind.  7. When dogs chase a hare, it runs very fast until the dogs are close to it, when it stops suddenly. This it can do, as it runs by leaping with its long hind legs.  8. The dogs can not stop so quickly, and run past. The hare then starts off in another direction, or _doubles_, as we say, and so gains upon the dog. In this way it often escapes, and then it goes back to its form.  9. The hare is sometimes tamed, and it soon learns to know its friends; but it is a troublesome pet, as it gnaws the legs of the chairs and tables, and destroys the trees in the yard by gnawing off the bark near the roots.     _ALICE'S BUNNY._       Would you hear about my bunny,     All his little ways so funny?      First of all, then, you must know,     He has coat as white as snow,     Staring eyes of pink so pale,     And a tiny, dumpy tail.      Once, he had a pretty mate,     But she met a cruel fate.     Now quite by himself he stays,     And contented spends his days.      He runs about the nursery floor,     The chairs and table clambers o'er,     And nestles down upon my lap     Beside the cat, to take a nap;      And once, when I was in disgrace,     He licked the tear-drops from my face.     Now, don't you think my little bunny     Must be kind as well as funny?     LESSON XXXVII.  _SOMETHING ABOUT SQUIRRELS._  [Illustration]   1. Here comes the squirrel--the little fellow that frisks and gambols so prettily over trees and hedges, and that chatters to us as we take a walk in the woods or fields. He is afraid to let us touch him; but he will let us come quite near, as he knows he can easily get away.  2. As we see him scampering along on the fences or trees, the first thing that we notice is his long bushy tail, which he coils up over his back.  3. But we will find one in a cage, and then we will take a closer look. We find that he has chisel-teeth, like the rat and rabbit, and then we know that Mr. Squirrel eats something that he must gnaw.  4. His toes are not strong, like those of the rat or rabbit, but they are long and slender, and we know that he does not dig holes in the ground. The nails are not strong enough to catch prey, but are long, thin, sharp, and bent at their tips.  5. Then we find that the squirrel can turn all his toes around so that the nails point backward, and we see that he is made for running up and down trees, where he has his home.  6. Now we see what he does with his sharp cutting-teeth. He lives upon nuts, and his teeth are for gnawing through the hard shell, to get at the kernel inside.  7. The ears of the squirrel are of moderate size. The rabbit and hare live upon the ground, and, if they did not have large ears and sharp hearing, they would be killed by dogs and other enemies. But the squirrel has his home in trees, out of reach of animals that can not climb; so it does not need such sharp hearing to save itself.  8. When in his home in the trees, the squirrel feels safe; so he curls his tail over his body and head to keep warm, and goes to sleep.     LESSON XXXVIII.  _MORE ABOUT SQUIRRELS._  [Illustration]   1. As the squirrel is made to climb trees and live on nuts, he builds his nest there, and makes the tree his home. He finds some hollow place in the tree, or he builds where some large limb branches off, so that his nest can not well be seen from below.  2. His nest is made of dried leaves and bits of moss. His summer home is high up on the tree, where he has plenty at air; but his winter nest is as snug in some hole as he can make it.  3. In the fall, the squirrel gathers nuts and corn, and stores them up near his winter nest. Then, when cold weather comes on, he crawls into his bed of leaves, curls up, and goes to sleep.  4. Now and then, in the winter, he wakes, crawls to his store and has a dinner, and then goes to sleep again. When the warm days of spring come on, he wakes up fully, and is ready for his summer's work and play.  5. When the squirrel eats a nut, he takes it in his paws, sits up straight, with his tail curled over his back, and nips off the shell in little bites, turning it about as easily as we could with our hands.  6. The"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28077"],["title","Friends in Feathers and Fur, and Other Neighbors: For Young Folks (#8)"],["body","that we see most often are the little chattering red squirrel, and the gray squirrel, which is about twice as large. In the West and South, a large squirrel, that is partly red and partly gray, is called a fox-squirrel. All these squirrels have fine little rounded ears, and large eyes, so placed that they can look all around.  7. The English squirrel is most like our red squirrel. It is of the same color, but a little larger, and has pointed ears, with a long tuft of hair standing up from the top.  8. The teeth of the squirrel grow, and he wears them off by gnawing nuts. If, when not in his winter's sleep, he should stop gnawing something hard for a week or two, his teeth would become so long that he could not use them again.  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  LESSON XXXIX.  _THE FLYING SQUIRREL._  [Illustration]   1. Here we have the most curious squirrel of all--one that can fly or sail through the air. It is about the size of the common red squirrel, and nearly of the same color, but lighter upon the lower part of its body.  2. It has a loose skin on each side, running from its fore legs to its hind ones. When it is at rest, or when it walks and runs, this skin hangs like a ruffle. But when Mr. Squirrel wants to go fast, or on a long journey, he scampers to the top of a tree and spreads out his legs, drawing the loose skin tight like a sail.  3. He then gives a leap, and away he sails into the air, striking near the foot of another tree a long distance away. He runs up to the top of this tree, and away he goes again, so fast that nothing can catch him.  4. As he sails through the air, he falls toward the ground; but he can carry his legs and tail in such a way that, just before he strikes, he shoots upward a little way, and lands on a tree, some distance above the ground.  5. The flying squirrel is covered with soft, fine fur, but the covering of the flying-sail is finer than that of any other part. It has large eyes, for seeing in the night. It sleeps most of the day, and comes out after sunset in search of food.  6. A squirrel makes a pretty pet, and sometimes it becomes so tame that it runs about like a dog. A squirrel was once found in its nest before its eyes were opened, and brought to the house.  7. It became very tame, and, after it grew up, it would watch its master when he went out, and get into his pocket, where it would stay and peep out to the people it met.  8. When they came to a country place, the squirrel would leap out, run along the road, climb to the tops of the trees, nibble the leaves and bark, and then scamper after his master, and nestle down into his pocket again.     _THE OWL._       An owl sat in a hollow tree,       And cried the whole day through:     \"I can not see; the sun blinds me.       Ah, what am I to do?\"      When night was dark, the owl looked out,       And thought he'd leave his house:     For \"light,\" said he, \"has come to me--       I'll go and catch a mouse.\"      The mouse he caught, and then he cried:       \"What next am I to do?     The woods shall ring, I'll sit and sing,       Too-whit, too-whit, too-whoo!\"     LESSON XL.  _BO-PEEP AND THE SQUIRREL._  [Illustration]       Little Bo-peep said to her sheep,       \"In the wood there is tender grass growing;     And as you're so good, you shall dine in the wood,       By the brook that is quietly flowing.\"      Then a squirrel hard by looked down with a sigh,       And said, \"Oh, please go away, ma'am!     The acorns are mine, and the nuts too, so fine;       And in the woods always I play, ma'am.\"      Then little Bo-peep at the squirrel did peep:       \"No harm we are going to do, sir;     My sheep are not thieves, and, under the leaves       Of the wood, there is room for us too, sir.      \"But I wish to be just: so here's a soft crust       Of white bread of my mother's own baking;     And I'll give you a slice, which you'll find very nice,       If you'll join us in our merry-making.\"      *    *    *    *    *      If you saw a goat     Buttoned in a coat;     If you saw a rat     Dressed up in a hat;     If you saw a lamb     Take a slice of ham;     If you saw a bear     Combing out its hair;     If you saw an ox     Opening a box;     If you saw a pig     Eat a nice new fig;     If you saw a mouse     Throwing down a house;     If you saw a stag     Picking up a rag;     If you saw a cow     Make a pretty bow;     If you saw a fly     Take its slate and cry--     You would surely say,     \"What peculiar play!\"     Or would surely sing,     \"What a funny thing!\"     LESSON XLI.  _HOW THE MOLE LOOKS._  [Illustration]   1. Here we have the mole--a very curious animal. It is about the size of a rat, and is covered with a dark brown coat of fine fur. The fur does not lie back, as on the cat, but stands out straight from the body.  2. The legs of the mole are short, and are so formed that it can not stand upon them and raise its body from the ground.  3. The fore legs are large and strong, and each paw has five toes, armed with strong nails. When its toes are together, its fore paw is like a spade; and when they are spread apart, it is like a fork.  4. It has small ears, which are out of sight in the fur; and something like eyes, also deep in the fur, so that it can not see, or at most it can only tell when it is light and when it is dark.  5. Its nose is pointed, and its teeth are all sharp, like those of the cat, but are so small that they look like the points of white needles.  6. What does this little blind animal, that can only creep along, do? how can he get a living? and how does it get away from enemies?  7. We see that all its limbs are so small and set so close to its body that it can easily creep through small holes. Its hair stands out, so that it can crawl both ways.  8. It has no eyes, because it lives in the dark, and does not need to see to get its food.  9. Its nose is pointed and keen, so that it gets its food by scent instead of sight. By scent, too, it can tell when danger is nigh.  10. Its fur is fine and close, so that it is able to live in very damp places, and the wet does not get through to the skin.  11. Its ears and eyes are deep down in the fur, so that, in crawling through a hole, no dirt or dust can get into them.  12. Its teeth are not chisel-shaped, for gnawing, but are sharp and pointed, like the teeth of animals that live on flesh; but they are so small that they would break in trying to eat the bones of even a mouse.     LESSON XLII.  _HOW THE MOLE WORKS AND LIVES._  [Illustration]   1. As the mole is not made for the sunlight, it must live below ground. With its strong fore paws it digs into the earth, and it can dig so fast that anywhere in the grass it will get out of sight in about a minute.  2. When it is above ground and it scents any danger, it does not run or climb, but it digs; and, when once under ground, it can keep out of the way of almost any enemy.  3. As it digs forward, it pushes the dirt backward, and it will go a long way in a little while. Its hind legs drag behind, and, as they have little to do, they are weak.  4. It digs along in the dark when its keen little nose scents a worm or a grub; this it pushes into its mouth with its paw, and eats in an instant.  5. The meat which it finds below ground has no bones; so its small teeth are all that it needs to chew with. In some safe place, nearly always at the foot of a tree, the mole throws up a little mound of dirt, and in the middle of it builds its nest of dried grass.  6. Then it makes tunnels all around, not any one leading straight up to the nest. In the picture we see the mole's nest and the tunnels leading to it. The mole drinks a great deal, and in its tunnels it digs wells where it can go down and find water.  7. In the summer it keeps near the top of the ground; but in winter it digs down deeper, to find grubs, and because it is warmer.  8. In digging under ground, the mole destroys the roots of grass and plants, and does some damage; but it does much more good, by destroying the grubs which live on the roots of plants.     LESSON XLIII.  _ABOUT THE PORCUPINE._  [Illustration]   1. We find in the woods a curious animal called a hedgehog, but which is really a porcupine. The hedgehog is found in Europe, and lives upon insects; the porcupine lives in quite a different way.  2. The porcupine is a little larger than the rabbit. It has short legs, sharp claws, and a short, broad tail. Like the rabbit, it has chisel-teeth for gnawing.  3. It climbs easily; but it moves slowly, both in walking and climbing. Its food is mostly the inside bark of trees. It climbs a tree, and seldom leaves until it has stripped off most of the bark.  4. As it can not run, it has a curious way of defending itself. Besides a coat of warm, soft fur, its back and sides are covered thick with sharp-pointed quills, from two to three inches long.  5. When the porcupine is feeding or going about, these quills lie back flat, like hair; but when there is any danger, they stand out straight. Upon the approach of an enemy, it folds up its paws, curls its head under its fore legs, and shows itself a bundle of sharp quills.  6. Should a dog or hungry wolf then snap at it, the quills get into his mouth, and stick there. Each quill has barbs like a fish-hook, and many an animal has died from the quills working into its flesh after having tried to bite a porcupine.  7. The porcupine can also throw up its back or strike a heavy blow with its tail, driving the quills into the flesh of its enemies.  8. The quills easily break off at their blunt end, and they grow like the hair; so the porcupine has a plenty for use at all times.  9. When men hunt the porcupine, they take care not to get a blow from the tail, and then they watch their chance, and strike the animal on the nose with a club, which kills it at once.  10. The porcupine builds its nest in hollow trees. In the winter it sleeps most of the time, only coming out once in a while to"]]]
