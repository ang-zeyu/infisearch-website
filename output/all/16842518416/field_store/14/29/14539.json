I forget how much I've spent on 'em--they're in dock now.\"  Bones tightened _his_ lips, too.  \"They're in dock now?\" he said.  He scratched his nose.  \"Dear old Fred Pole,\" he said, \"you're a jolly old soul.  By Jove that's not bad! 'Pole' an' 'soul' rhyme--did you notice it?\"  Fred had noticed it.  \"It's rum,\" said Bones, shaking his head, \"it is rum how things get about.  How did you know, old fellow-citizen, that I was going in for shippin'?\"  Mr. Fred Pole did not know that Bones was going in for shipping, but he smiled.  \"There are few things that happen in the City that I _don't_ know,\" he admitted modestly.  \"The Tibbetts Line,\" said Bones firmly, \"will fly a house-flag of purple and green diagonally--that is, from corner to corner.  There will be a yellow anchor in a blue wreath in one corner and a capital T in a red wreath in the other.\"  \"Original, distinctly original,\" said Fred in wondering admiration. \"Wherever did you get that idea?\"  \"I get ideas,\" confessed Bones, blushing, \"some times in the night, sometimes in the day.  The fleet\"--Bones liked the sound of the word and repeated it--\"the fleet will consist of the _Augustus_, the _Sanders_--a dear old friend of mine living at Hindhead--the _Patricia_--another dear old friend of mine living at Hindhead, too--in fact, in the same house.  To tell you the truth, dear old Fred Pole, she's married to the other ship.  And there'll be the _Hamilton_, another precious old soul, a very, very, very, very dear friend of mine who's comin' home shortly----\"  \"Well, what shall we say, Mr. Tibbetts?\" said Fred, who had an early luncheon appointment.  \"Would you care to buy the two boats at the same price we gave your uncle for them?\"  Bones rang his bell.  \"I'm a business man, dear old Fred,\" said he soberly.  \"There's no time like the present, and I'll fix the matter--_now!_\"  He said \"now\" with a ferociousness which was intended to emphasize his hard and inflexible business character.  Fred came into the private office of Pole & Pole after lunch that day, and there was in his face a great light and a peace which was almost beautiful.  But never beamed the face of Fred so radiantly as the countenance of the waiting Joe.  He lay back in his chair, his cigar pointing to the ceiling.  \"Well, Fred?\"--there was an anthem in his voice.  \"Very well, Joe.\"  Fred hung up his unnecessary umbrella.  \"I've sold the _Fairies_!\"  Joe said it and Fred said it.  They said it together.  There was the same lilt of triumph in each voice, and both smiles vanished at the identical instant.  \"_You've_ sold the _Fairies_!\" they said.  They might have been rehearsing this scene for months, so perfect was the chorus.  \"Wait a bit, Joe,\" said Fred; \"let's get the hang of this.  I understand that you left the matter to me.\"  \"I did; but, Fred, I was so keen on the idea I had that I had to nip in before you.  Of course, I didn't go to him as Pole & Pole----\"  \"To him?  What him?\" asked Fred, breathing hard.  \"To What's-his-name--Bones.\"  Fred took his blue silk handkerchief from his pocket and dabbed his face.  \"Go on, Joe,\" he said sadly  \"I got him just before he went out to lunch.  I sent up the United Merchant Shippers' card--it's our company, anyway.  Not a word about Pole & Pole.\"  \"Oh, no, of course not!\" said Fred.  \"And, my boy,\"--this was evidently Joe's greatest achievement, for he described the fact with gusto--\"not a word about the names of the ships.  I just sold him two steamers, so and so tonnage, so and so classification----\"  \"For how much?\"  Fred was mildly curious.  It was the curiosity which led a certain political prisoner to feel the edge of the axe before it beheaded him.  \"A hundred and twenty thousand!\" cried Joe joyously.  \"He's starting a fleet, he says.  He's calling it the Tibbetts Line, and bought a couple of ships only this morning.\"  Fred examined the ceiling carefully before he spoke.  \"Joe,\" he said, \"was it a firm deal?  Did you put pen to paper?\"  \"You-bet-your-dear-sweet-life,\" said Joe, scornful at the suggestion that he had omitted such an indispensable part of the negotiation.  \"So did I, Joe,\" said Fred.  \"Those two ships he bought were the two _Fairies_.\"  There was a dead silence.  \"Well,\" said Joe uneasily, after a while, \"we can get a couple of ships----\"  \"Where, Joe?  You admitted yesterday there weren't two boats in the world on the market.\"  Another long silence.  \"I did it for the best, Fred.\"  Fred nodded  \"Something must be done.  We can't sell a man what we haven't got. Joe, couldn't you go and play golf this afternoon whilst I wangle this matter out?\"  Joe nodded and rose solemnly.  He took down his umbrella from the peg and his shiny silk hat from another peg, and tiptoed from the room.  From three o'clock to four Mr. Fred Pole sat immersed in thought, and at last, with a big, heavy sigh, he unlocked his safe, took out his cheque-book and pocketed it.  Bones was on the point of departure, after a most satisfactory day's work, when Fred Pole was announced.  Bones greeted him like unto a brother--caught him by the hand at the very entrance and, still holding him thus, conducted him to one of his beautiful chairs.  \"By Jove, dear old Fred,\" he babbled, \"it's good of you, old fellow--really good of you!  Business, my jolly old shipowner, waits for no man.  Ali, my cheque-book!\"  \"A moment--just a moment, dear Mr. Bones,\" begged Fred.  \"You don't mind my calling you by the name which is already famous in the City?\"  Bones looked dubious.  \"Personally, I prefer Tibbetts,\" said Fred.  \"Personally, dear old Fred, so do I,\" admitted Bones.  \"I've come on a curious errand,\" said Fred in such hollow tones that Bones started.  \"The fact is, old man, I'm----\"  He hung his head, and Bones laid a sympathetic hand on his shoulder.  \"Anybody is liable to get that way, my jolly old roysterer,\" he said. \"Speakin' for myself, drink has no effect upon me--due to my jolly old nerves of iron an' all that sort of thing.\"  \"I'm ashamed of myself,\" said Fred.  \"Nothing to be ashamed of, my poor old toper,\" said Bones honestly in error.  \"Why, I remember once----\"  \"As a business man, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said Fred bravely, \"can you forgive sentiment?\"  \"Sentiment!  Why, you silly old josser, I'm all sentiment, dear old thing!  Why, I simply cry myself to sleep over dear old Charles What's-his-name's books!\"  \"It's sentiment,\" said Fred brokenly.  \"I just can't--I simply can't part with those two ships I sold you.\"  \"Hey?\" said Bones.  \"They were your uncle's, but they have an association for me and my brother which it would be--er--profane to mention.  Mr. Tibbetts, let us cry off our bargain.\"  Bones sniffed and rubbed his nose.  \"Business, dear old Fred,\" he said gently.  \"Bear up an' play the man, as dear old Francis Drake said when they stopped him playin' cricket. Business, old friend.  I'd like to oblige you, but----\"  He shook his head rapidly  Mr. Fred slowly produced his cheque-book and laid it on the desk with the sigh of one who was about to indite his last wishes.  \"You shall not be the loser,\" he said, with a catch in his voice, for he was genuinely grieved.  \"I must pay for my weakness.  What is five hundred pounds?\"  \"What is a thousand, if it comes to that, Freddy?\" said Bones. \"Gracious goodness, I shall be awfully disappointed if you back out--I shall be so vexed, really.\"  \"Seven hundred and fifty?\" asked Fred, with pleading in his eye.  \"Make it a thousand, dear old Fred,\" said Bones; \"I can't add up fifties.\"  So \"in consideration\" (as Fred wrote rapidly and Bones signed more rapidly) \"of the sum of one thousand pounds (say Â£1,000), the contract as between &c., &c.,\" was cancelled, and Fred became again the practical man of affairs.  \"Dear old Fred,\" said Bones, folding the cheque and sticking it in his pocket, \"I'm goin' to own up--frankness is a vice with me--that I don't understand much about the shippin' business.  But tell me, my jolly old merchant, why do fellers sell you ships in the mornin' an' buy 'em back in the afternoon?\"  \"Business, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said Fred, smiling, \"just big business.\"  Bones sucked an inky finger.  \"Dinky business for me, dear old thing,\" he said.  \"I've got a thousand from you an' a thousand from the other Johnny who sold me two ships. Bless my life an' soul----\"  \"The other fellow,\" said Fred faintly--\"a fellow from the United Merchant Shippers?\"  \"That was the dear lad,\" said Bones.  \"And has he cried off his bargain, too?\"  \"Positively!\" said Bones.  \"A very, very nice, fellow.  He told me I could call him Joe--jolly old Joe!\"  \"Jolly old Joe!\" repeated Fred mechanically, as he left the office, and all the way home he was saying \"Jolly old Joe!\"     CHAPTER II  HIDDEN TREASURE  Mrs. Staleyborn's first husband was a dreamy Fellow of a Learned University.  Her second husband had begun life at the bottom of the ladder as a three-card trickster, and by strict attention to business and the exercise of his natural genius, had attained to the proprietorship of a bucket-shop.  When Mrs. Staleyborn was Miss Clara Smith, she had been housekeeper to Professor Whitland, a biologist who discovered her indispensability, and was only vaguely aware of the social gulf which yawned between the youngest son of the late Lord Bortledyne and the only daughter of Albert Edward Smith, mechanic.  To the Professor she was Miss _H. Sapiens_--an agreeable, featherless plantigrade biped of the genus _Homo_.  She was also thoroughly domesticated and cooked like an angel, a nice woman who apparently never knew that her husband had a Christian name, for she called him \"Mr. Whitland\" to the day of his death.  The strain and embarrassment of the new relationship with her master were intensified by the arrival of a daughter, and doubled when that daughter came to a knowledgeable age."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27525"],["title","Bones in London (#3)"],["body","Whitland had the inherent culture of her father and the grace and delicate beauty which had ever distinguished the women of the house of Bortledyne.  When the Professor died, Mrs. Whitland mourned him in all sincerity. She was also relieved.  One-half of the burden which lay upon her had been lifted; the second half was wrestling with the binomial theorem at Cheltenham College.  She had been a widow twelve months when she met Mr. Cresta Morris, and, if the truth be told, Mr. Cresta Morris more fulfilled her conception as to what a gentleman should look like than had the Professor.  Mr. Cresta Morris wore white collars and beautiful ties, had a large gold watch-chain over what the French call poetically a _gilet de fantasie_, but which he, in his own homely fashion, described as a \"fancy weskit.\" He smoked large cigars, was bluff and hearty, spoke to the widow--he was staying at Harrogate at the time in a hydropathic establishment--in a language which she could understand.  Dimly she began to realize that the Professor had hardly spoken to her at all.  Mr. Cresta Morris was one of those individuals who employed a vocabulary of a thousand words, with all of which Mrs. Whitland was well acquainted; he was also a man of means and possessions, he explained to her.  She, giving confidence for confidence, told of the house at Cambridge, the furniture, the library, the annuity of three hundred pounds, earmarked for his daughter's education, but mistakenly left to his wife for that purpose, also the four thousand three hundred pounds invested in War Stock, which was wholly her own.  Mr. Cresta Morris became more agreeable than ever.  In three months they were married, in six months the old house at Cambridge had been disposed of, the library dispersed, as much of the furniture as Mr. Morris regarded as old-fashioned sold, and the relict of Professor Whitland was installed in a house in Brockley.  It was a nice house--in many ways nicer than the rambling old building in Cambridge, from Mrs. Morris's point of view.  And she was happy in a tolerable, comfortable kind of fashion, and though she was wholly ignorant as to the method by which her husband made his livelihood, she managed to get along very well without enlightenment.  Marguerite was brought back from Cheltenham to grace the new establishment and assist in its management.  She shared none of her mother's illusions as to the character of Mr. Cresta Morris, as that gentleman explained to a very select audience one January night.  Mr. Morris and his two guests sat before a roaring fire in the dining-room, drinking hot brandies-and-waters.  Mrs. Morris had gone to bed; Marguerite was washing up, for Mrs. Morris had the \"servant's mind,\" which means that she could never keep a servant.  The sound of crashing plates had come to the dining-room and interrupted Mr. Morris at a most important point of his narrative.  He jerked his head round.  \"That's the girl,\" he said; \"she's going to be a handful.\"  \"Get her married,\" said Job Martin wisely.  He was a hatchet-faced man with a reputation for common-sense.  He had another reputation which need not be particularized at the moment.  \"Married?\" scoffed Mr. Morris.  \"Not likely!\"  He puffed at his cigar thoughtfully for a moment, then:  \"She wouldn't come in to dinner--did you notice that?  We are not good enough for her.  She's fly!  Fly ain't the word for it.  We always find her nosing and sneaking around.\"  \"Send her back to school,\" said the third guest.  He was a man of fifty-five, broad-shouldered, clean-shaven, who had literally played many parts, for he had been acting in a touring company when Morris first met him--Mr. Timothy Webber, a man not unknown to the Criminal Investigation Department.  \"She might have been useful,\" Mr. Morris went on regretfully, \"very useful indeed.  She is as pretty as a picture, I'll give her that due. Now, suppose she----\"  Webber shook his head.  \"It's my way or no way,\" he said decidedly.  \"I've been a month studying this fellow, and I tell you I know him inside out.\"  \"Have you been to see him?\" asked the second man.  \"Am I a fool?\" replied the other roughly.  \"Of course I have not been to see him.  But there are ways of finding out, aren't there?  He is not the kind of lad that you can work with a woman, not if she's as pretty as paint.\"  \"What do they call him?\" asked Morris.  \"Bones,\" said Webber, with a little grin.  \"At least, he has letters which start 'Dear Bones,' so I suppose that's his nickname.  But he's got all the money in the world.  He is full of silly ass schemes, and he's romantic.\"  \"What's that to do with it?\" asked Job Martin, and Webber turned with a despairing shrug to Morris.  \"For a man who is supposed to have brains----\" he said, but Morris stopped him with a gesture.  \"I see the idea--that's enough.\"  He ruminated again, chewing at his cigar, then, with a shake of his head----  \"I wish the girl was in it.\"  \"Why?\" asked Webber curiously.  \"Because she's----\"  He hesitated.  \"I don't know what she knows about me.  I can guess what she guesses.  I'd like to get her into something like this, to--to----\"  He was at a loss for a word.  \"Compromise?\" suggested the more erudite Webber.  \"That's the word.  I'd like to have her like that!\"  He put his thumb down on the table in an expressive gesture.  Marguerite, standing outside, holding the door-handle hesitating as to whether she should carry in the spirit kettle which Mr. Morris had ordered, stood still and listened.  The houses in Oakleigh Grove were built in a hurry, and at best were not particularly sound-proof.  She stood fully a quarter of an hour whilst the three men talked in low tones, and any doubts she might have had as to the nature of her step-father's business were dispelled.  Again there began within her the old fight between her loyalty to her mother and loyalty to herself and her own ideals.  She had lived through purgatory these past twelve months, and again and again she had resolved to end it all, only to be held by pity for the helpless woman she would be deserting.  She told herself a hundred times that her mother was satisfied in her placid way with the life she was living, and that her departure would be rather a relief than a cause for uneasiness.  Now she hesitated no longer, and went back to the kitchen, took off the apron she was wearing, passed along the side-passage, up the stairs to her room, and began to pack her little bag.  Her mother was facing stark ruin.  This man had drawn into his hands every penny she possessed, and was utilizing it for the furtherance of his own nefarious business.  She had an idea--vague as yet, but later taking definite shape--that if she might not save her mother from the wreck which was inevitable, she might at least save something of her little fortune.  She had \"nosed around\" to such purpose that she had discovered her step-father was a man who for years had evaded the grip of an exasperated constabulary.  Some day he would fall, and in his fall bring down her mother.  Mr. Cresta Morris absorbed in the elaboration of the great plan, was reminded, by the exhaustion of visible refreshment, that certain of his instructions had not been carried out.  \"Wait a minute,\" he said.  \"I told that girl to bring in the kettle at half-past nine.  I'll go out and get it.  Her royal highness wouldn't lower herself by bringing it in, I suppose!\"  He found the kettle on the kitchen table, but there was no sign of Marguerite.  This was the culmination of a succession of \"slights\" which she had put on him, and in a rage he walked along the passage, and yelled up the stairs:  \"Marguerite!\"  There was no reply, and he raced up to her room.  It was empty, but what was more significant, her dresses and the paraphernalia which usually ornamented her dressing-table had disappeared.  He came down a very thoughtful man.  \"She's hopped,\" he said laconically.  \"I was always afraid of that.\"  It was fully an hour before he recovered sufficiently to bring his mind to a scheme of such fascinating possibilities that even his step-daughter's flight was momentarily forgotten        *      *      *      *      *  On the following morning Mr. Tibbetts received a visitor.  That gentleman who was, according to the information supplied by Mr. Webber, addressed in intimate correspondence as \"Dear Bones,\" was sitting in his most gorgeous private office, wrestling with a letter to the eminent firm of Timmins and Timmins, yacht agents, on a matter of a luckless purchase of his.   \"DEAR SIRS GENENTLEMEN\" (ran the letter.  Bones wrote as he thought, thought faster than he wrote, and never opened a dictionary save to decide a bet)--\"I told you I have told you 100000 times that the yacht _Luana_ I bought from your cleint (a nice cleint I must say!!!) is a frord fruad and a _swindel_.  It is much two too big.  2000 pounds was a swindel outraygious!!  Well I've got it got it now so theres theirs no use crying over split milk.  But do like a golly old yaght-seller get red of it rid of it.  Sell it to _anybody_ even for a 1000 pounds. I must have been mad to buy it but he was such a plausuble chap....\"   This and more he wrote and was writing, when the silvery bell announced a visitor.  It rang many times before he realized that he had sent his factotum, Ali Mahomet, to the South Coast to recover from a sniffle--the after-effects of a violent cold--which had been particularly distressing to both.  Four times the bell rang, and four times Bones raised his head and scowled at the door, muttering violent criticisms of a man who at that moment was eighty-five miles away.  Then he remembered, leapt up, sprinted to the door, flung it open with an annoyed:  \"Come in!  What the deuce are you standing out there for?\"  Then he stared at his visitor, choked, went very red, choked again, and fixed his monocle.  \"Come in, young miss, come in,\" he said gruffly.  \"Jolly old bell's out of order.  Awfully sorry"]]]
