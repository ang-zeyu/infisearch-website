Two dogs of black Saint Hubert's breed,                        120   Unmatched for courage, breath, and speed,   Fast on his flying traces came,   And all but won that desperate game;   For, scarce a spear's length from his haunch,   Vindictive, toiled the bloodhounds stanch;                     125   Nor nearer might the dogs attain,   Nor farther might the quarry strain.   Thus up the margin of the lake,   Between the precipice and brake,   O'er stock and rock their race they take.                      130   VIII    The Hunter marked that mountain high,   The lone lake's western boundary,   And deemed the stag must turn to bay,   Where that huge rampart barred the way;   Already glorying in the prize,                                 135   Measured his antlers with his eyes;   For the death-wound and the death-halloo,   Mustered his breath, his whinyard drew--   But thundering as he came prepared,   With ready arm and weapon bared,                               140   The wily quarry shunned the shock,   And turned him from the opposing rock;   Then, dashing down a darksome glen,   Soon lost to hound and Hunter's ken,   In the deep Trossachs' wildest nook                            145   His solitary refuge took.   There, while close couched, the thicket shed   Cold dews and wild-flowers on his head,   He heard the baffled dogs in vain   Rave through the hollow pass amain,                            150   Chiding the rocks that yelled again.   IX    Close on the hounds the Hunter came,   To cheer them on the vanished game;   But, stumbling in the rugged dell,   The gallant horse exhausted fell.                              155   The impatient rider strove in vain   To rouse him with the spur and rein,   For the good steed, his labors o'er,   Stretched his stiff limbs, to rise no more;   Then, touched with pity and remorse,                           160   He sorrowed o'er the expiring horse.   \"I little thought, when first thy rein   I slacked upon the banks of Seine,   That Highland eagle e'er should feed   On thy fleet limbs, my matchless steed!                        165   Woe worth the chase, woe worth the day,   That costs thy life, my gallant gray!\"   X    Then through the dell his horn resounds,   From vain pursuit to call the hounds.   Back limped, with slow and crippled pace,                      170   The sulky leaders of the chase;   Close to their master's side they pressed,   With drooping tail and humbled crest;   But still the dingle's hollow throat   Prolonged the swelling bugle-note.                             175   The owlets started from their dream,   The eagles answered with their scream,   Round and around the sounds were cast,   Till echo seemed an answering blast;   And on the Hunter hied his way,                                180   To join some comrades of the day;   Yet often paused, so strange the road,   So wondrous were the scenes it showed.   XI    The western waves of ebbing day   Rolled o'er the glen their level way;                          185   Each purple peak, each flinty spire,   Was bathed in floods of living fire.   But not a setting beam could glow   Within the dark ravines below,   Where twined the path in shadow hid,                           190   Round many a rocky pyramid,   Shooting abruptly from the dell   Its thunder-splintered pinnacle;   Round many an insulated mass,   The native bulwarks of the pass,                               195   Huge as the tower which builders vain   Presumptuous piled on Shinar's plain.   The rocky summits, split and rent,   Formed turret, dome, or battlement,   Or seemed fantastically set                                    200   With cupola or minaret,   Wild crests as pagod ever decked,   Or mosque of Eastern architect.   Nor were these earth-born castles bare,   Nor lacked they many a banner fair;                            205   For, from their shivered brows displayed,   Far o'er the unfathomable glade,   All twinkling with the dewdrops sheen,   The brier-rose fell in streamers green,   And creeping shrubs, of thousand dyes,                         210   Waved in the west-wind's summer sighs.   XII    Boon nature scattered, free and wild,   Each plant or flower, the mountain's child.   Here eglantine embalmed the air,   Hawthorn and hazel mingled there;                              215   The primrose pale and violet flower,   Found in each cliff a narrow bower;   Fox-glove and night-shade, side by side,   Emblems of punishment and pride,   Grouped their dark hues with every stain                       220   The weather-beaten crags retain.   With boughs that quaked at every breath,   Grey birch and aspen wept beneath;   Aloft, the ash and warrior oak   Cast anchor in the rifted rock;                                225   And, higher yet, the pine-tree hung   His shattered trunk, and frequent flung,   Where seemed the cliffs to meet on high,   His bows athwart the narrowed sky.   Highest of all, where white peaks glanced,                     230   Where glist'ning streamers waved and danced,   The wanderer's eye could barely view   The summer heaven's delicious blue;   So wondrous wild, the whole might seem   The scenery of a fairy dream.                                  235   XIII    Onward, amid the copse 'gan peep   A narrow inlet, still and deep,   Affording scarce such breadth of brim   As served the wild duck's brood to swim.   Lost for a space, through thickets veering,                    240   But broader when again appearing,   Tall rocks and tufted knolls their face   Could on the dark-blue mirror trace;   And farther as the Hunter strayed,   Still broader sweep its channels made.                         245   The shaggy mounds no longer stood,   Emerging from entangled wood,   But, wave-encircled, seemed to float,   Like castle girdled with its moat;   Yet broader floods extending still                             250   Divide them from their parent hill,   Till each, retiring, claims to be   An islet in an inland sea.   XIV    And now, to issue from the glen,   No pathway meets the wanderer's ken,                           255   Unless he climb, with footing nice,   A far projecting precipice.   The broom's tough roots his ladder made,   The hazel saplings lent their aid;   And thus an airy point he won,                                 260   Where, gleaming with the setting sun,   One burnished sheet of living gold,   Loch Katrine lay beneath him rolled,   In all her length far winding lay,   With promontory, creek, and bay,                               265   And island that, empurpled bright,   Floated amid the livelier light,   And mountains, that like giants stand,   To sentinel enchanted land.   High on the south, huge Benvenue                               270   Down on the lake in masses threw   Crags, knolls, and mounds, confusedly hurled,   The fragments of an earlier world;   A wildering forest feathered o'er   His ruined sides and summit hoar,                              275   While on the north, through middle air,   Ben-an heaved high his forehead bare.   XV    From the steep promontory gazed   The stranger, raptured and amazed,   And, \"What a scene were here,\" he cried,                       280   \"For princely pomp, or churchman's pride!   On this bold brow, a lordly tower;   In that soft vale, a lady's bower;   On yonder meadow, far away,   The turrets of a cloister gray;                                285   How blithely might the bugle-horn   Chide, on the lake, the lingering morn!   How sweet, at eve, the lover's lute   Chime, when the groves were still and mute!   And when the midnight moon should lave                         290   Her forehead in the silver wave,   How solemn on the ear would come   The holy matin's distant hum,   While the deep peal's commanding tone   Should wake, in yonder islet lone,                             295   A sainted hermit from his cell,   To drop a bead with every knell--   And bugle, lute, and bell, and all,   Should each bewildered stranger call   To friendly feast, and lighted hall.                           300   XVI    \"Blithe were it then to wander here!   But now--beshrew yon nimble deer--   Like that same hermit's, thin and spare,   The copse must give my evening fare;   Some mossy bank my couch must be,                              305   Some rustling oak my canopy.   Yet pass we that; the war and chase   Give little choice of resting-place--   A summer night, in greenwood spent,   Were but tomorrow's merriment:                                 310   But hosts may in these wilds abound,   Such as are better missed than found;   To meet with Highland plunderers here,   Were worse than loss of steed or deer.   I am alone; my bugle-strain                                    315   May call some straggler of the train;   Or, fall the worst that may betide,   Ere now this falchion has been tried.\"   XVII    But scarce again his horn he wound,   When lo! forth starting at the sound,                          320   From underneath an aged oak,   That slanted from the islet rock,   A damsel guider of its way,   A little skiff shot to the bay,   That round the promontory steep                                325   Led its deep line in graceful sweep,   Eddying, in almost viewless wave,   The weeping willow-twig to lave,   And kiss, with whispering sound and slow,   The beach of pebbles bright as snow.                           330   The boat had touched the silver strand,   Just as the Hunter left his stand,   And stood concealed amid the brake,   To view this Lady of the Lake.   The maiden paused, as if again                                 335   She thought to catch the distant strain.   With head upraised, and look intent,   And eye and ear attentive bent,   And locks flung back, and lips apart,   Like monument of Grecian art,                                  340   In listening mood, she"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28307"],["title","A Christmas Accident and Other Stories (#0)"],["body","CHRISTMAS ACCIDENT  AND OTHER STORIES  [Illustration]  BY ANNIE ELIOT TRUMBULL     A Christmas Accident     STORIES BY  ANNIE ELIOT TRUMBULL  [Illustration: Leaf]            A CHRISTMAS ACCIDENT AND OTHER             STORIES. 16mo.

They were just two of those little red brick dwellings that one is always seeing side by side in the outskirts of a city, and looking as if the occupants must be alike too. But these two families were quite different. Mr. Gilton, who lived in one, was a pretty cross sort of man, and was quite well-to-do, as cross people sometimes are. He and his wife lived alone, and they did not have much going out and coming in, either. Mrs. Gilton would have liked more of it, but she had given up thinking about it, for her husband had said so many times that it was women's tomfoolery to want to have people, whom you weren't anything to and who weren't anything to you, ringing your doorbell all the time and bothering around in your dining-room,--which of course it was; and she would have believed it if a woman ever did believe anything a man says a great many times.  In the other house there were five children, and, as Mr. Gilton said, they made too large a family, and they ought to have gone somewhere else. Possibly they would have gone had it not been for the fence; but when Mr. Gilton put it up and Mr. Bilton told him it was three inches too far on his land, and Mr. Gilton said he could go to law about it, expressing the idea forcibly, Mr. Bilton was foolish enough to take his advice. The decision went against him, and a good deal of his money went with it, for it was a long, teasing lawsuit, and instead of being three inches of made ground it might have been three degrees of the Arctic Circle for the trouble there was in getting at it. So Mr. Bilton had to stay where he was.  It was then that the yards began to take on those little differences that soon grew to be very marked. Neither family would plant any vines because they would have been certain to heedlessly beautify the other side, and consequently the fence, in all its primitive boldness, stood out uncompromisingly, and the one or two little bits of trees grew carefully on the farther side of the enclosure so as not to be mixed up in the trouble at all. But Mr. Gilton's grass was cut smoothly by the man who made the fires, while Mr. Bilton only found a chance to cut his himself once in two weeks. Then, by and by, Mr. Gilton bought a red garden bench and put it under the tree that was nearest to the fence. No one ever went out and sat on it, to be sure, but to the Bilton children it represented the visible flush of prosperity. Particularly was Cora Cordelia wont to peer through the fence and gaze upon that red bench, thinking it a charming place in which to play house, ignorant of the fact that much of the red paint would have come off on her back. Cora Cordelia was the youngest of the five. All the rest had very simple names,--John, Walter, Fanny, and Susan,--but when it came to Cora Cordelia, luxuries were beginning to get very scarce in the Bilton family, and Mrs. Bilton felt that she must make up for it by being lavish, in one direction or another. She had wished to name Fanny, Cora, and Susan, Cordelia, but she had yielded to her husband, and called one after his mother and one after herself, and then gave both her favorite names to the youngest of all. Cora Cordelia was a pretty little girl, prettier even than both her names put together.  After the red bench came a quicksilver ball, that was put in the middle of the yard and reflected all the glory of its owner, albeit in a somewhat distorted form. This effort of human ingenuity filled the Bilton children with admiration bordering on awe; Cora Cordelia spent hours gazing at it, until called in and reproved by her mother for admiring so much things she could not afford to have. After this, she only admired it covertly.  Small distinctions like these barbed the arrows of contrast and comparison and kept the disadvantages of neighborhood ever present.  Then, it was a constant annoyance to have their surnames so much alike. Matters were made more unpleasant by mistakes of the butcher, the grocer, and so on,--Gilton, 79 Holmes Avenue, was so much like Bilton, 77 Holmes Avenue. Gilton changed his butcher every time he sent his dinner to Bilton; and though the mistakes were generally rectified, neither of the two families ever forgot the time the Biltons ate, positively ate, the Gilton dinner, under a misapprehension. Mrs. Bilton apologized, and Mrs. Gilton boldly told her husband that she was glad they'd had it, and she hoped they'd enjoyed it, which only made matters worse; and altogether it was a dark day, the only joy of it being that fearful one snatched by John, Walter, Susan, Fanny, and Cora Cordelia from the undoubted excellence of the roast.  Of course there was an assortment of minor difficulties. The smoke from the Biltons' kitchen blew in through the windows of the Giltons' sitting-room when the wind was in one direction, and, when it was in the other, many of the clothes from the Giltons' clothesline were blown into the Biltons' yard, and Fanny, Susan, or Cora Cordelia had to be sent out to pick them up and drop them over the fence again, which Mrs. Bilton said was very wearing, as of course it must have been. Things like this were always happening, but matters reached a climax when it came to the dog. It wasn't a large dog, but it was a tiresome one. It got up early in the morning and barked. Now we all know that early rising is a good thing and honorable among all men, but it is something that ought to be done quietly, out of regard to the weaker vessels; and a dog that barks between five and seven in the morning, continuously, certainly ought to be suppressed, even if it be necessary to use force. Everybody agreed with the Biltons about that,--everybody except the Giltons themselves, who, by some one of nature's freaks, didn't mind it. Mrs. Bilton often said she wished Mrs. Gilton could be a light sleeper for a week and see what it was like. So, too, everybody thought that Mr. Bilton had right on his side when he complained that this same dog came into his yard, being apparently indifferent to any coolness between the estate owners, and ran over a bed of geraniums and one thing and another, that was the small Bilton offset to the Gilton bench and ball. But when one morning, for the first time, that dog remained quiet and restful, and was found cold and poisoned, and Mr. Gilton was loud in his accusations of the Bilton boys and their father, public opinion wavered for a moment. After that accident, no member of either family spoke to any member of the other. That was the way matters stood the day before Christmas.         *       *       *       *       *  It was snowing hard, and the afternoon grew dark rapidly, and the whirling flakes pursued a blinding career. In spite of that, everybody was out doing the last thing. Mrs. Gilton was not, to be sure. Of course they would have a big dinner, but even that was all arranged for, although the turkey hadn't come and her husband was going to stop and see about it on his way home. She shuddered as the possibility of its having gone to the Biltons occurred to her. But she didn't believe it had,--they hadn't the same butcher any longer. Meanwhile there was so little to do. It was too dark to read or sew, and she sat idly at the window looking out at the passers and the driving snow. Everybody else was in a hurry. She wished she, too, had occasion to hasten down for a last purchase, or to light the lamp in order to finish a last bit of dainty sewing, as she used to do when she was a girl. She seemed to have so few friends now with whom she exchanged Christmas greetings. Was it then only for children and youth, this Christmas cheer? And must she necessarily have left it behind her with her girlhood? No, she knew better than that. She felt that there was a deeper significance in the Christmas-tide than can come home to the hearts of children and unthoughtfulness, and yet it had"]]]
