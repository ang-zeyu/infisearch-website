Doubtless some one had to go where there was danger of being shot, as some one had to dig ditches and help to pry wagons out of the mud, but there was something rather preposterous in the thought that anything of this kind was incumbent upon him.  The mutterings of the men against an officer, who would not share their hardships and duties, did not reach his ears, nor yet the gibes of the more earnest of the officers at the “young headquarter swells,” whose interest and zeal were nothing to what they would have taken in a fishing excursion.  It came about very naturally and very soon that this continual avoidance of duty in directions where danger might be encountered was stigmatized  by the harsher name of cowardice.  Neither did this come to his knowledge, and he was consequently ignorant that he had delivered a fatal stab to his reputation one fine morning when, the regiment being ordered out with three days' rations and forty rounds of cartridges, the sergeant who was sent in search of him returned and reported that he was sick in his tent.  Jacob Alspaugh expressed the conclusion instantly arrived at by every one in the regiment:  “It's all you could expect of one of them kid-glove fellers, to weaken when it came to serious business.”  Harry's self-sufficiency had left so little room for anything that did not directly concern his own comfort, that he could not understand the deadly earnestness of the men he saw file out of camp, or that there was any urgent call for him to join them in their undertaking.  “Bob Bennett's always going where there's no need of it,” he said to a companion, as he saw the last of the regiment disappear into the woods on the mountain side.  “He could have staid back here with us just as well as not, instead of trudging off through the heat over these devilish roads, and probably get into a scrape for which no one will thank him.”  “Yes,” said Ned Burnleigh, with his affected drawl, “what the devil's the use, I'd like to know, for a fellah's putting himself out to do things, when there's any quantity of other fellahs, that can't be better employed, ready and even anxious to do them.”  “That's so.  But it's getting awful hot here.  Let's go over to the shade, where we were yesterday, and have Dick bring us a bucket of cold spring water and the bottles and things.”  ---  “Abe!” said Jake Alspaugh to his file-leader--a red-headed, pock-marked man, whose normal condition was that of outspoken disgust at every thing--“this means a fight.”  “Your news would've been fresh and interesting last night,” growled Abe Bolton.  “I suppose that's what we brought our guns along for.”  “Yes; but somebody's likely to get killed.”  “Well, you nor me don't have to pay their life insurance, as I know on.”  “But it may be you or me,”  “The devil'd be might anxious for green wood before he'd call you in.”  “Come, now, don't talk that way.  This is a mighty serious time.”  “I'll make it a durned sight seriouser for you if you don't keep them splay feet o'your'n offen my heels when we're marching.”  “Don't you think we'd better pay, or--something?”  “You might try taking up a collection.”  “Try starting a hymn, Jake,” said a slender young man at his right elbow, whose face showed a color more intimately connected with the contents of his canteen than the heat of the day.  “Line it out, and we'll all join in.  Something like this, for example:  'Hark, from the tombs a doleful sound   Mine ears attend the cry. Ye living men, come view the ground   Where you must shortly lie.'”  Alspaugh shuddered visibly.  “Come, spunk up, Jake,” continued the slender young man.  “Think how proud all your relations will be of you, if you die for your country.”  “I'm mad at all of my relations, and I don't want to do nothing to please 'em,” sighed Jake.  “But I hope you're not so greedy as to want to live always?” said the slender young man, who answered roll-call to Kent Edwards.  “No, but I don't want to be knocked off like a green apple, before I'm ripe and ready.”  “Better be knocked off green and unripe,” said Kent, his railing mood changing to one of sad introspection, “than to prematurely fall, from a worm gnawing at your heart.”  Jake's fright was not so great as to make him forego the opportunity for a brutal retort:  “You mean the 'worm of the still,' I s'pose.  Well, it don't gnaw at my heart so much as at some other folkses' that I know'd.”  Kent's face crimsoned still deeper, and he half raised his musket, as if to strike him, but at that moment came the order to march, and the regiment moved forward.  The enemy was by this time known to be near, and the men marched in that silence that comes from tense expectation.  The day was intensely hot, and the stagnant, sultry air was perfumed with the thousand sweet odors that rise in the West Virginia forests in the first flush of Summer.  The road wound around the steep mountain side, through great thickets of glossy-leaved laurel, by banks of fragrant honeysuckle, by beds of millions of sweet-breathing, velvety pansies, nestling under huge shadowy rocks, by acres of white puccoon flowers, each as lovely as the lily that grows by cool Siloam's shady rill--all scattered there with Nature's reckless profusion, where no eye saw them from year to year save those of the infrequent hunter, those of the thousands of gaily-plumaged birds that sang and screamed through the branches of the trees above, and those of the hideous rattlesnakes that crawled and hissed in the crevices of the shelving rocks.  At last the regiment halted under the grateful shadows of the broad-topped oaks and chestnuts.  A patriarchal pheasant, drumming on a log near by some uxorious communication to his brooding mate, distended his round eyes in amazement at the strange irruption of men and horses, and then whirred away in a transport of fear.  A crimson crested woodpecker ceased his ominous tapping, and flew boldly to a neighboring branch, where he could inspect the new arrival to good advantage and determine his character.  The men threw themselves down for a moment's rest, on the springing moss that covered the whole mountain side.  A hum of comment and conversation arose.  Jake Alspaugh began to think that there was not likely to be any fight after all, and his spirits rose proportionately.  Abe Bolton growled that the cowardly officers had no doubt deliberately misled the regiment, that a fight might be avoided.  Kent Edwards saw a nodding May-apple flower--as fair as a calla and as odorous as a pink--at a little distance, and hastened to pick it.  He came back with it in the muzzle of his gun, and his hands full of violets.  A thick-bodied rattlesnake crawled slowly and clumsily out from the shelter of a little ledge, his fearful eyes gleaming with deadly intentions against a ground-squirrel frisking upon the end of a mossy log, near where Captain Bob Bennett was seated, poring over a troublesome detail in the “Tactics.”  The snake saw the man, and his awkward movement changed at once into one of electric alertness. He sounded his terrible rattle, and his dull diamonds and stripes lighted up with the glare that shines through an enraged man's face. The thick body seemed to lengthen out and gain a world of sinuous suppleness.  With the quickness of a flash he was coiled, with head erect, forked tongue protruding, and eyes flaming like satanic jewels.  A shout appraised Captain Bennett of his danger.  He dropped the book, sprang to his feet with a quickness that matched the snake's, and instinctively drew his sword.  Stepping a little to one side as the reptile launched itself at him, he dexterously cut it in two with a sweeping stroke.  A shout of applause rose from the excited boys, who gathered around to inspect the slain serpent and congratulate the Captain upon his skillful disposition of his assailant.  “O, that's only my old bat-stroke that used to worry the boys in town-hall so much,” said the Captain carelessly.  “It's queer what things turn out useful to a man, and when he least expects them.”  A long, ringing yell from a thousand throats cleft the air, and with its last notes came the rattle of musketry from the brow of the hill across the little ravine.  The bullets sang viciously overhead. They cut the leaves and branches with sharp little crashes, and struck men's bodies with a peculiar slap.  A score of men in the disordered group fell back dead or dying upon the green moss.  “Of course, we might've knowed them muddle-headed officers 'd run us right slap into a hornets' nest of Rebels before they knowed a thing about it,” grumbled Abe Bolton, hastily tearing a cartridge with his teeth, and forcing it into his gun.  “Hold on, my weak-kneed patriot,” said Kent Edwards, catching Jake Alspaugh by the collar, and turning him around so that he faced the enemy again.  “It's awful bad manners to rush out of a matinee just as the performance begins.  You disturb the people who've come to enjoy the show.  Keep you seat till the curatin goes down. You'll find enough to interest you.”  The same sudden inspiration of common-sense that had flashed upon Captain Bennett, in encountering the snake now raised him to the level of this emergency.  He comprehended that the volley they had received had emptied every Rebel gun.  The distance was so short that the enemy could be reached before they had time to re-load. But no time must be lost in attempting to form, or in having the order regularly given by the Colonel.  He sprang toward the enemy, waving his sword, and shouted in tones that echoed back from the cliffs:  “Attention, BATTALION!  Charge bayonets!  FORWARD, DOUBLE-QUICK, MARCH!”  A swelling cheer answered him.  His own company ran forward to follow his impetuous lead.  The others joined in rapidly.  Away they dashed down the side of the declivity, and in an instant more were swarming up the opposite side toward the astonished "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2766"],["title","The Red Acorn (#3)"],["body","Rebels. Among these divided councils reigned.  Some were excited snapping unloaded guns at the oncoming foe; others were fixing bayonets, and sturdily urging their comrades to do likewise, and meet the rushing wave of cold steel with a counter wave.  The weaker-hearted ones were already clambering up the mountain-side out of reach of harm.  There was no time for debate.  The blue line led by Bennett flung itself upon the dark-brown mass of Rebels like an angry wave dashing over a flimsy bank of sand, and in an instant there was nothing to be done but pursue the disrupted and flying fragments.  It was all over.      Chapter III.  A Race.     “Some have greatness thrust upon them.” -- Twelfth Night.   The unexpected volley probably disturbed private Jacob Alspaugh's mind more than that of any other man in the regiment.  It produced there an effect akin to the sensation of nauseous emetic in his stomach.  He had long enjoyed the enviable distinction of being the “best man” among combative youths of Sardis, and his zeal and invariable success in the fistic tournaments which form so large a part of the interest in life of a certain class of young men in villages, had led his townsmen to entertain extravagant hopes as to his achievements in the field.  But, like most of his class, his courage was purely physical, and a low order of that type.  He was bold in those encounters where he knew that his superior strength and agility rendered small the chances of his receiving any serious bodily harm, but of that high pride and mounting spirit which lead to soldierly deeds he had none.  The sight of the dying men on each side shriveled his heart with a deadly panic.  “O, Kent,” he groaned, “Lemme go, and let's git out o' here.  This's just awful, and it'll be ten times wuss in another minnit.  Let's git behind that big rock there, as quick as the Lord'll let us.”  He turned to pull away from Kent's detaining hand, when he heard Captain Bennett's order to the regiment to charge, and the hand relaxed its hold.  Jake faced to the front again and saw Kent and Abe Bolton, and the rest of the boys rush forward, leaving him and a score of other weak-kneed irresolutes standing alone behind.  Again he thought he would seek the refuge of the rock, but at that moment the Union line swept up to the Rebels, scattering them as a wave does dry sand.  Jake's mental motions were reasonably rapid.  Now he was not long in realizing that all the danger was past, and that he had an opportunity of gaining credit cheaply.  He acted  promptly.  Fixing his bayonet, he gave a fearful yell and started forward on a run for the position which the regiment had gained.  He was soon in the lead of the pursuers, and appeared, by his later zeal, to be making amends for his earlier tardiness.  As he ran ahead he shouted savagely:  “Run down the hellions!  Shoot 'em!  Stab 'em! Bay'net 'em!  Don't let one of 'em git away.”  There is an excitement in a man-chase that is not even approached by any other kind of hunting, and Jake soon became fairly intoxicated with it.  He quickly overtook one or two of the slower-paced Rebels, who surrendered quietly, and were handed by him over to the other boys as they came up, and conducted by them to the rear.  Becoming more excited he sped on, entirely unmindful of how far he was outstripping his comrades.  A hundred yards ahead of him was a tall, gaunt Virginian, clad in butternut-colored jeans of queer cut and pattern, and a great bell-crowned hat of rough, gray beaver.  Though his gait was shambling and his huge splay feet rose and fell in the most awkward way, he went over the ground with a swiftness that made it rather doubtful whether Jake was gaining on him at all.  But the latter was encouraged by the sings of his chase's distress.  First the bell-crowned hat flew off and rolled behind, and Jake could not resist the temptation to give it a kick which sent it spinning into a clump of honeysuckles. Then the Rebel flung off a haversack, whose flapping interfered with his speed, and this was followed by a clumsily-constructed cedar canteen.  The thought flashed into Jake's mind that this was probably filled with the much-vaunted peach-brandy of that section; and as ardent sprits were one of his weaknesses, the temptation to stop and pick up the canteen was very strong, but he conquered it and hurried on after his prey.  Next followed the fugitive's belt, loaded down with an antique cartridge-box, a savage knife made from a rasp and handled with buckhorn, and a fierce-looking horse-pistol with a flint-lock.  “I seemed to be bustin' up a moosyum o' revolutionary relics,” said Jake afterward, in describing the incident.  “The feller dropped keepsakes from his forefathers like a bird moltin' its feathers on a windy day.  I begun to think that if I kep up the chase purty soon he'd begin to shed Continental money and knee-britches.”  The fugitive turned off to the right into a narrow path that wound through the laurel thickets.  Jake followed with all the energy that remained in him, confident that a short distance more would bring him so close to his game that he could force his surrender by a threat of bayoneting.  He caught up to within a rod of the Rebel, and was already foreshortening his gun for a lunge in case of refusal to surrender on demand, when he was amazed to see the Rebel whirl around, level his gun at him, and order HIS surrender. Jake was so astonished that he stumbled, fell forward and dropped his gun.  As he raised his eyes he saw three or four other Rebels step out from behind a rock, and level their guns upon him with an expression of bloodthirstiness that seemed simply fiendish.  Then it flashed upon him how far away he was from all his comrades, and that the labyrinth of laurel made them even more remote.  With this realization came the involuntary groan:  “O, Lordy! it's all up with me.  I'm a goner, sure!”  His courage did not ooze out of his fingers, like the historic Bob Acres's; it vanished like gas from a rent balloon.  He clasped his hands and tried to think of some prayer.  “Now I lay me,” he murmured.  “Shan't we shoot the varmint?” said one of the Rebels, with a motion of his gun in harmony with that idea.  “O, mister--mister--GOOD mister, DON'T!  PLEASE don't!  I swear I didn't mean to do no harm to you.”  “Wall, ye acted monty quare fur a man that didn't mean no harm,”  said the pursued man, regaining his breath with some difficulty. “A-chasin' me down with thet ar prod on yer gun, an' a-threatenin' to stick hit inter me at every jump.  Only wanted ter see me run, did yer?”  “O, mister, I only done it because I wuz ordered to.  I couldn't help myself; I swear I couldn't.”  “Whar's the ossifers thet wuz a-orderin' ye?  Whar's the captins that wuz puttin' ye up ter hit?  Thar wan't no one in a mile of ye.  Guess we'd better shoot ye.”  Again Jake raised his voice in abject appeal for mercy.  There was nothing he was not willing to promise if only his life were only spared.  “Wouldn't hit be better ter bay'net him?” suggested one of the Rebels, entirely unmoved, as his comrades were, by Jake's piteous pleadings.  “Ef we go ter shootin' 'round yere hit'll liekly bring the Yankees right onter us.”  “I 'spect hit would be better ter take him back a little ways, any way,” said the man whom Jake had pursued.  “Pick up his gun thar, Eph.  Come along, you, an' be monty peart about hit, fur we're in a powerful bad frame o' mind ter be fooled with.  I wouldn't gin a fi'-penny-bit fur all yer blue-bellied life's worth.  The boys ar jest pizen mad from seein' so many o' thar kin and folks killed by yer crowd o' thievin' Hessians.”  Grateful for even a momentary respite, Jake rose from his knees with alacrity and humbly followed one of the Rebels along the path. The others strode behind, and occasionally spurred him into a more rapid pace with a prick from their bayonets.  “O,---ough, mister, don't do that!  Don't, PLEASE!  You don't know how it hurts.  I ain't got no rhinoceros skin to stand such jabs as that.  That came purty nigh goin' clean through to my heart.”  “Skeet ahead faster, then, or the next punch'll go righ smack through ye, fur sartin.  Ef yer skin's so tender what are ye doin' in the army?”  They climbed the mountain laboriously, and started down on the other side.  About midway in the descent they came upon a deserted cabin standing near the side of the road.  “By the Lord Harry,” said one of the Rebels, “I'm a'most done clean gin out, so I am.  I'm tireder nor a claybank hoss arter a hard day's plowin', an' I'm ez dry ez a lime-kiln.  I motion that we stop yere an' take a rest.  We kin put our Yank in the house thar, an' keep him.  I wonder whar the spring is that the folks thet lived yere got thar water from?”  “Ef I don't disremember,” said another, “this is the house where little Pete Higgenbottom lived afore the country got ruther onhelthy fur him on account of his partiality for other people's hosses.  I made a little trip up yere the time I loss thet little white-faced bay mar of pap's, an I'm purty sure the spring's over thar in the holler.”  “Lordy, how they must 've hankered arter the fun o' totin' water to 've lugged hit clar from over tha.  I'd've moved the house nigher the spring afore I'd've stood thet ere a month, so I would.”  “The distance to the water ortent to bother a feller thet gets along with usin' ez little ez you do,” growled the first speaker.  “A man whose nose looks like a red-pepper pod in August, and his shirt like a section o' rich bottom land, hain't no great reason ter make remarks on other folks's use o' water.”  Jake plucked up some courage from the relaxation in the savage grimness of his captors, which seemed implied by this rough pleasantry, and with him such recuperation of spirits naturally took the form of brassy self-assertion.  “Don't you fellers know,” he began with a manner and tone intended to be placating, but instead was rasping and"]]]
