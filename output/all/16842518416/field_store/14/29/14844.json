Get hung for being horse thieves?\"  \"No criminal activities were reported by your people, but there is a record of singular restlessness and dissatisfaction with established conditions.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"What did they do?\"  \"They were constantly on the move, for the most part. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries they were primarily pioneers, frontiersmen, settlers of new country. But when the country was established they usually packed up and went somewhere else. Rovers, trappers, unsettled people.\"  \"This is not good?\" Fenwick glanced at the chart that was open now. It was almost uncolored.  \"I regret to say that such people are not classed as the stable element of communities,\" said Baker. \"We cannot evaluate the index of hereditary accomplishment for the Clearwater faculty very high.\"  \"It appears that our grandpas were among those generally given credit for getting things set up,\" said Fenwick.  \"Such citizens are indeed necessary,\" said Baker. \"But our index evaluates stability in community life and accomplishments with long-range effects in science and culture.\"  \"We haven't got much of a chance then, grandpa being foot-loose as he was.\"  \"Other factors could completely override this negative evaluation. You see, this is the beauty of the Index; it doesn't depend on any one factor or small group of factors. We evaluate the whole range of factors that have anything to do with the situation. Weaknesses in one spot may be counterbalanced by strength in others.\"  \"It looks like Clearwater is staffed by a bunch of bums without any strong spots.\"  \"I wouldn't say it in such terms, but the reason I am pointing these things out to you, John, is to try to persuade you to disassociate yourself from such a weak organization and go elsewhere. You have fine talents of your own, but you have always had a pattern of associating with groups like this one at Clearwater. Don't you see now that the only thing for you to do is go somewhere where there are people capable of doing things?\"  \"I _like_ Clearwater. I like the people at the College. Where else are we in the bums category?\"  Baker suddenly didn't want to go on. The whole thing had become distasteful to him. \"There are a good many others. I don't think we need to go into them. There is the staff reading index, the social activity index, wardrobe evaluation, hobbies, children--actual and planned.\"  \"I want to hear about them,\" said Fenwick. \"That wardrobe evaluation--that sounds like a real fascinating study.\"  \"Actually, it's comparatively minor,\" said Baker. \"Our psychologists have worked out some extremely interesting correlations, however. Each item of a man's wardrobe is assigned a numerical rating. Tuxedo, one or more. Business suits, color and number. Hunting jackets. Slacks. Sport coats. Work shoes. Dress shoes. Very interesting what our people can do with, such information.\"  \"Clearwater doesn't rate here?\"  Baker indicated the chart. \"I'm afraid not. Now, this staff reading index is somewhat similar. You recall the application forms asked for the number of pages of various types of material read during the past six months--scientific journals, newspapers, magazines, fiction.\"  \"I suppose Clearwater is a pretty illiterate bunch,\" said Fenwick.  Baker pointed soundlessly to the graph.  \"Hobbies and social activities are not bad,\" Baker said, after a time. \"Almost up to within ten points of the standard. A few less bingo parties and Brownie meetings and that many more book reviews or serious soirees would balance the social activity chart. If the model railroad club were canceled and a biological activity group substituted, the hobby classification would look much better. Then, in the number of children, actual and planned, Clearwater is definitely out of line, too. You see, the standard takes the form of the well-known bell-shaped curve. Clearwater is way down on the high side.\"  \"Too much biological activity already,\" Fenwick murmured.  Baker looked up. \"What was that? I didn't hear what you said.\"  Fenwick leaned back and extended his arms on the desk. \"I said your whole damned Index is nothing but a bunch of pseudo-intellectual garbage.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Baker felt the color rising in his face, but he forced himself to remain calm. After a moment of silence he said. \"Your emotional feelings are understandable, but you must remember that the Index permits us to administer accurately the National Science Development Act. Without the scientific assurance of the Index there would be no way of determining where these precious funds could best be utilized.\"  \"You'd be better off putting the money on the ponies,\" said Fenwick. \"Sometimes they win. As it stands, you've set it up for a sure loss. You haven't got a chance in the world.\"  \"You think Clearwater College could make better use of some of our funds than, say, MIT?\"  \"I wouldn't be surprised. Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the boys at MIT or Cal Tech or a lot of other places couldn't come up with a real development in the way of a fermodacular filter for reducing internucleated cross currents. But the real breakthroughs--you've closed your doors and locked them out.\"  \"Who have we locked out? We've screened and fine combed the resources of the entire country. We know exactly where the top research is being conducted in every laboratory in the nation.\"  Fenwick shook his head slowly and smiled. \"You've forgotten the boys working in their basements and in their back yard garages. You've forgotten the guys that persuade the wife to put up with a busted-down automatic washer for another month so they can buy another hundred bucks worth of electronic parts. You've remembered the guys who have Ph. D.'s for writing 890-page dissertations on the Change of Color in the Nubian Daisy after Twilight, but you've forgotten guys like George Durrant, who can make the atoms of a crystal turn handsprings for him.\"  Baker leaned back in his chair and smiled. He almost wished he hadn't wasted the effort of trying to show Fenwick. But, then, he had tried. And he would always have regretted it if he hadn't.  \"You're referring now to the crackpot fringe?\" he said.  \"I suppose so,\" said Fenwick. \"I've heard it called that before.\"  \"One of the things, above all else, which the Index was designed to accomplish,\" said Baker, \"was the screening out of all elements that might be ever so remotely associated with the crackpot fringe. And believe me, you'll never know how strong it is in this country! Every two-bit tinkerer wants a handout to develop his world-shaking gadget that will suppress the fizz after the cap is removed from a pop bottle, or adapt any apartment-size bathtub for raising tropical fish.\"  \"You ever heard of the flotation process?\" said Fenwick abruptly.  Baker frowned at the sudden shift of thought. \"Of course--\"  \"What would the world be like without the flotation process?\"  \"The metals industry would be vastly different, of course. Copper would be much scarcer and higher priced. Gold--\"  \"A ton of ore and maybe a pound of recovered metal, right?\" said Fenwick. \"Move a mountain of waste to get anything of value. Crush millions of tons of rock and float out the pinpoint particles of metal on bubbles of froth.\"  \"That's a rough description of what happens.\"  \"You've heard of high-grading.\"  \"Of course. A somewhat colloquial term used in mining.\"  \"The high-grader takes a pick and digs for anything big enough to see and pick up with his hands. He doesn't worry about the small stuff that takes sweat and machinery to recover.\"  \"I suppose so. I fail to see the significance--\"  \"You're high-grading, Bill,\" said Fenwick. He leaned across the desk and spoke with bitter intensity. \"You're high-grading and you should be using a flotation process.\"  Fenwick slowly drew back in his chair. Baker felt overwhelmed by the sudden intensity he had never before seen displayed in John Fenwick. Any reaction on his part seemed suddenly inadequate. \"I fail to see any connection--,\" he said finally.  Fenwick looked at him steadily. \"Human creativeness can be mined only by flotation methods. It's in low-grade ore. Process a million stupid notions and find a pin point of genius. Turn over enormous wastes of human thought and recover a golden principle. But turn your back on these mountains of low-grade material and you shut out the wealth of creative thought that is buried in them. More than that, by high-grading only where rich veins have appeared in the past, you're mining lodes that have played out.\"  \"An ingenious analogy,\" said Baker, recovering with a smile now. \"But it's hardly an accurate or applicable one. The human mind is not a piece of precious metal found in a mountain of ore. Rather, it's an intricate device capable of producing computations of unbelievable complexity. And we know how such devices that are superior in function are produced, and we know what their characteristics are. We also know that such a device does not 'play out'. If it is superior in function, it can remain so for a long time.\"  \"High-grading,\" said Fenwick. \"And the vein is played out. You'll never find the thing you're looking for until you develop means of processing low-grade material.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Baker watched Fenwick across the desk. He was weary of the whole thing. He certainly had no need to prove himself to this man. He had simply tried to do Fenwick a favor, and Fenwick had thrown it right back in his face. Yet there was a temptation to go on, to prove to Fenwick the difference between their two worlds. Fenwick belonged to a world compounded of inevitable failure. The temptation to show him, to try again to lift him out of it was born of a kind of pity for Fenwick.  Baker's own life had arrowed decisively, without waver, to a goal that was as correct as the tolerances of human error could make it. He often permitted himself"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28118"],["title","The Great Gray Plague (#3)"],["body"," pride of considering his mind somewhat as a computer that had been programmed through a magnificent gene inheritance to drive irresistibly toward the precise goals he had reached. But Fenwick--Fenwick was still fumbling around in a morass of uncertainty. After years of erratic starts and stops he was now confusedly trying to make something out of that miserable little institution called Clearwater College.  It wasn't particularly friendship that urged Baker to show Fenwick. Their friendship was of a breed that Baker had never quite been able to define to his own satisfaction. It seemed to him there was a sort of deadly fascination in associating with a man who walked so blindly, who was so profoundly incapable of understanding his own blindness and peril.  \"I'm going to show you,\" Baker said abruptly, \"exactly what it would mean if we were to do as you suggest. I'll show you what it would be like to give attention to every halfwit and crackpot that comes begging for a handout.\" He switched the intercom and spoke into it. \"Doris, please bring in the Ellerbee file. Yes--the crackpot section.\"  He switched off. \"Doris has her own quaint but quite accurate way of cataloguing our various applications,\" he explained.  In a moment the secretary entered and placed the file on the desk. \"There's a new letter in there,\" she said. \"Dr. Pehrson initialed it. He said you didn't want to be bothered any more with this case.\"  \"That's right.\"  Baker opened the file and shoved it toward Fenwick. \"This boy has a gadget he wants us to look at. Doesn't really need any money, he says. That's the kind we really have to be on guard against. If we looked at his wonder gadget, we'd be pestered for a million-dollar handout for years to come.\"  \"What's he got?\" Fenwick asked.  \"Some kind of communication device, he says. He claims it's nothing but a grown crystal which you hold in your hand and talk to anybody anywhere on Earth.\"  \"Sounds like it wouldn't take much to find out whether he's got anything or not. Just let him put on a five-minute demonstration.\"  \"But multiply that five minutes by a thousand, by ten thousand. And once you let them get their teeth into you, it doesn't stop with five minutes. It goes on into reams of letters and years of time. No, you have to stop this kind of thing before it ever starts. But take a look at some of this material in the file and you'll see what I mean.\"  Fenwick picked up the top letter as Baker pushed the file toward him. \"He starts this one by saying, 'Dear Urban.' Is that what he calls you? What does he mean?\"  \"Who knows? He's a crackpot, I told you. Who cares what he means, anyway. We've got far more important things to worry about.\"  Fenwick scanned the letter a moment, then looked up, a faint smile on his face. \"I know what he means. Urban--Pope Urban--was the one responsible for the persecutions of Galileo.\"  Baker shrugged embarrassedly. \"I told you he was a crackpot. Delusions of grandeur and of persecution are typical.\"  \"This boy may not be as crazy as he sounds. You're giving him a pretty good imitation of a Galileo treatment--won't even look at his device. He says here that 'Since you have previously refused to examine my device and have questioned my reliability as an observer, I have obtained the services of three unbiased witnesses, whose affidavits, signed and notarized, are attached. These men are the Fire Chief, the Chief of Police, and the Community Church Pastor of Redrock, all of whom testify that they did see my device in full operation this past week. I trust that this evidence will persuade you that an investigation should be made of my device. I fail to see how the bull-headedness and cocksureness of your office can withstand any more of the evidence I have to offer in support of my claims.'\"  \"A typical crackpot letter,\" said Baker. \"He tries to be reasonable, but his colors are soon shown when he breaks down into vituperative language like a frustrated child.\"  Fenwick thumbed through the large pile of correspondence. \"I'd say anybody would likely blow his stack a good deal harder than this if he'd been trying to get your attention this long. Why didn't he ever send you one of his gadgets in the mail?\"  \"Oh, he did,\" said Baker. \"That was one of the first things he did.\"  \"What did you do?\"  \"Sent it back. We always return these things by registered return mail.\"  \"Without even trying it out?\"  \"Of course.\"  \"Bill, that isn't even reasonable. These earlier letters of his describe the growing of these crystals. He tells exactly how he does it. He knows what he's talking about. I'd like to see him and see his crystal.\"  \"That's what I was hoping you'd say! All we have to do is get Doris to give him a call and he'll be here first thing in the morning. You can be our official investigator. You can see what it's like dealing with a crackpot!\"         *       *       *       *       *  James Ellerbee was a slim man, impetuous and energetic. Fenwick liked him on sight. He was not a technical man; he was a farmer. But he was an educated farmer. He had a degree from the State Agricultural College. He dabbled in amateur radio and electronics as a hobby.  \"I'm certainly glad someone is finally willing to give me a break and take a look at my device,\" he said as he shook Fenwick's hand. \"I've had nothing but a runaround from this office for the past eight months. Yet, according to all the publicity, this is where the nation's scientific progress is evaluated.\"  Fenwick felt like a hypocrite. \"We get pretty overloaded,\" he said lamely.  They were in Baker's office. Baker watched smugly from behind his desk. Ellerbee said, \"Well, we might as well get started. All you have to do, Mr. Fenwick, is hold one of these crystal cubes in your hand. I'll go in the other office and close the door. It may help at first if you close your eyes, but this is not really necessary.\"  \"Wait,\" said Fenwick. Somehow he wanted to get away from Baker while this was going on. \"I'd like to take it outside, somewhere in the open. Would that be all right?\"  \"Sure. Makes no difference where you try it,\" said Ellerbee. \"One place is as good as another.\"  Baker waved a hand as they went out. \"Good luck,\" he said. He smiled confidently at Fenwick.  As far as Fenwick could see, the crystal was not even potted or cased in any way. The raw crystal lay in his hand. The striations of the multitude of layers in which it was laid down were plainly visible.  Ellerbee dropped Fenwick off by the Jefferson memorial, then drove on about a mile. Still in sight, he stopped the car and got out. Fenwick saw him wave a hand. Nothing happened.  Fenwick glanced down at the crystal in his hand. About the size of a child's toy block. He could almost understand Baker's position. It _was_ pretty silly to suppose this thing could have the powers Ellerbee said it had. No electric energy applied. It merely amplified the normal telepathic impulses existing in every human mind, Ellerbee said. Fenwick sighed. You just couldn't tell ahead of time that a thing wasn't going to pan out. He knew his philosophy was right. These had to be investigated--every lousy, crackpot one of them. You could never tell what you were missing out on unless you did check.  He squeezed harder on the crystal, as Ellerbee had told him to do.  It was just a little fuzzy at first, fading and coming back. Then it was there, shimmering a little, but steady. The image of Ellerbee standing in front of him, grinning.  Fenwick glanced down the road. Ellerbee was still there, a mile away. But he was also right there in front of him, about four feet away.  \"It shakes you up a little bit at first,\" said Ellerbee. \"But you get used to it after a while. Anyway, this is it. Are you convinced my device works?\"  Fenwick shook his head to try to clear it rather than to give a negative answer. \"I'm convinced _something_ is working,\" he said. \"I'm just not quite sure what it is.\"  \"I'll drive across town,\" Ellerbee offered. \"You can see that distance makes no difference at all. Later, I'll prove it works clear across the country if you want me to.\"  They arranged that proof of Ellerbee's presence on the other side of the city could be obtained by Fenwick's calling him at a drug store pay phone. Then they would communicate by means of the cubes.  It was no different than before.  The telephone call satisfied Fenwick that Ellerbee was at least ten miles away. Then, within a second, he also appeared to be standing directly in front of Fenwick.  \"What do you want?\" said Fenwick finally. \"What do you want the Bureau to do about your device? How much money do you want for development?\"  \"Money? I don't need any money!\" Ellerbee exploded. \"All I want is for the Government to make some use of the thing. I've had a patent on it for six months. The Patent Office had sense enough to give me a patent, but nobody else would look at it. I just want somebody to make some use of it!\"  \"I'm sure a great many practical applications can be found,\" Fenwick said lamely. \"We'll have to make a report, first, however. There will be a need for a great many more experiments--\"  But most important of all, Baker would have to be shown. Baker would have to _know_ from his own experience that this thing worked.  Fenwick suddenly wanted to get away from Ellerbee as much as he had from Baker a little earlier. There was just so much a man's aging synapses could stand, he told himself. He had to do a bit of thinking by himself. When Ellerbee drove up again, Fenwick told him what he wanted.  Ellerbee looked disappointed but resigned. \"I hope this isn't another runaround, Mr. Fenwick. You'll pardon me for being blunt, but I've had some pretty raw treatment from your office since I started writing about my communicator.\"  \"I promise you this isn't a runaround,\" said Fenwick, \"but it's absolutely necessary to get Dr. Baker to view your demonstration. We will want to see your laboratories and your methods of"]]]
