He has even gone so far as to deny absolutely that he knows anything of the matter--and then has contradicted himself a minute afterwards. At last, this morning, I have brought him a degree further. In the last few days I made it my business to acquaint myself, as far as possible, with the exact circumstances of the tragedy, so far as they are known, and in course of my inquiries I saw the housekeeper of the offices next door--the man who identified the body as Denson's. He either could not, or would not, tell me very much, but he _did_ say that you had been working in some way in connection with the case, and that you knew as much of it as anybody. That gave me an idea. This morning I told Mason that not only he, but I also had a duty in respect to this matter, and my duty was to see that nothing in connection with such a crime as this should be hushed up on any consideration or for anybody's fancies. I said that if he liked he need tell me no more, but might take _you_ into consultation professionally, as your client, allowing me first to see you and to assure you that, consistently with his own safety, he was anxious to further the ends of justice. I said that, as your client, your first duty would be to protect him, that your professional practice would keep your mouth absolutely sealed, and that you already knew a good deal about the crime--perhaps more than he suspected. I protested that this seemed to me the very least he could do, and I warned him that if he refused to do even this, I should have to consider whether it was consistent with my character, as a clergyman and a loyal citizen, any longer to conceal the fact that he was keeping back information that might lead to the apprehension of the murderer. This frightened him, and between the fear of the threat and the fear that you might already know more than he suspected, he authorised me--he was even eager about it--to come and see you; always, of course, under a pledge of strict professional secrecy.\"  \"So far your account is quite clear, Mr. Potswood,\" Hewitt said. \"You have done your best, now I must do mine. You wish me to see Mason at once, no doubt?\"  \"I arranged to bring you to his house, if you were willing and your engagements permitted, at three this afternoon. Will that do? I have been keeping you, I see--it is past one already. Will you lunch with me at my club?\"  \"With great pleasure--more especially as I have a few questions to ask as we go along. Is it far?\"  \"Just at this end of Pall Mall--we will walk, if you like.\"  \"Tell me now,\" said Hewitt as they went, \"anything you know about Mr. Mason's habits, family connections, and so forth, as fully and as minutely as you please. Has he any friends connected with China, for instance?\"  \"China? Why, no, I think not; except--but I'll tell you all I know. Mr. Mason has no family connections, so far as I am aware--at any rate, in London--except his niece, Miss Creswick. She is within a few months of twenty-one, a charming girl, but horribly shut in, for Mason has almost no visitors. Miss Creswick was his sister's daughter; she lost her mother first and then her father, and was left to the guardianship of her uncle. He was also trustee under the will, and he has, I believe, discretion to keep charge of her property, if he thinks fit, till she reaches the age of twenty-five; though in case of his death she is to inherit in the ordinary way, on coming of age. She is a very dutiful and, indeed, an affectionate niece; though I must say he is scarcely fair to her, keeping her, as he does, so completely secluded from the society of young people of her own age. Mere thoughtlessness, I think; he has had no children of his own, his mind is wholly occupied with his science and his fads, and he makes himself a recluse without a thought of the girl. And that brings me to what I was about to say at first, when you asked me if Mr. Mason had any friends connected with China. There is a young doctor--Lawson is his name--some very distant connection of the family, I think, who had a professional appointment of some sort in Shanghai for a year or two, but who is now in London trying to work up a small practice of his own. If you hadn't mentioned China I shouldn't have thought of him, since he never goes to the house now--or, at any rate, is supposed not to go.\"  \"Doesn't go to the house? And why is that?\"  \"Well, there was a disagreement. What it was I don't quite know, but in the first place it had some connection with some of Mason's experiments--something which Lawson declined to help him with for professional reasons, or else something he declined to do for Lawson, I don't know which. But the thing went further, for, as a matter of fact, there was something between the young people--Lawson is only twenty-eight--and Mason put an end to that. It had been something like a formal engagement, I think, but in the quarrel--Mason was always quarrelling with somebody when he _had_ friends, and that's why he has so few now--in the quarrel things were said that ended in a rupture. Whether young Lawson was fortune-hunting or not I cannot say, but Mason certainly accused him of it, and promised to keep back the girl's money as long as he could. In the meantime Mason declared an end to the engagement, and poor Helen was broken-hearted; for as I have said, she is an affectionate girl, and she hadn't a friend to confide in. But I'm boring you--you don't want to know all these things, surely?\"  \"On the contrary, I can't possibly know too much, and the particulars can't possibly be too minute. Nine cases out of ten I bring to an issue by means of a triviality. You were saying a little while back that there were almost _no_ visitors at Mr. Mason's house; but you said 'almost,' and that means there are some. Who are they?\"  \"Very occasionally--rarely, in fact--there are one or two members of learned societies with whom he had been in correspondence, or who are old friends. There is a Professor Hutton and a Dr. Burge, I believe; but they don't appear once in six months; and there is Mr. Everard Myatt, who is more frequent. He does not profess to be a great man of science, but he is interested in chemistry as an amateur, and is, I fancy, a sort of disciple of Mason's. He has noticed a sad difference in Mason just lately, and he even called on me yesterday, though I hardly knew him by sight, in the hope that I would back up his urgent suggestion that Mason should go off for a change and a rest. Beyond these I don't think I know of a single visitor. But here we are at the Megatherium.\"     II   Mr. Jacob Mason's house stood in its own grounds in a quiet suburban road. It was not a very large house, but it straggled about comfortably in the manner of detached houses built in the suburbs at a time when space was less valuable than now, and it consisted of two floors only. The front door was not far from the road, and was clearly visible to passengers who might chance to look through either of the two iron gates that opened one on each end of the semi-circular drive.  All these things Martin Hewitt noticed as the Rev. Mr. Potswood pushed open one of these gates, and the two walked up the drive. The front door stood in a portico, and a French window gave access to the roof of this portico from a bedroom or dressing-room. As Hewitt and his companion approached the house the French window was pushed open, and a man appeared--a middle-aged, slightly stoutish man with a short, grey beard; commonplace enough in himself, but now convulsed with noisy anger, shaking his fists and stamping on the portico-roof.  \"Get out!\" he shouted. \"Don't come near my house again, or I'll have you flung out! Go away and take your friends with you! D'you hear? Go away, sir, and don't come here annoying me! Go! Go at once!\"  Mr. Potswood absolutely staggered with amazement. \"Why,\" he gasped, \"it's Mason! He's mad--clean mad! Why, Mason, my poor friend, don't you know me?\"  \"Get out, I say!\" cried Mason. \"Give me no more of your talk! I won't have you here!\" And now Hewitt caught a glimpse of a girl's face at the window behind the man--a pale and handsome face, drawn with anxiety and fear.  Hewitt seized the clergyman quickly by the arm. \"Come,\" he whispered hurriedly, \"come away at once. There is a reason for this. Get away at once. If you can answer back angrily, do so, but at any rate, come away.\"  He hurried back to the gate, half dragging the astounded rector, who was all too honest a soul to be able to counterfeit an anger he did not feel, even if his amazement had not made him speechless. Hewitt closed the gate behind him and said as he walked, \"Where is the rectory? We will go there. He may have sent a message while you were out.\"  Mechanically the rector took the first turning. \"But he's mad!\" he protested. \"Mad, poor fellow! Merciful heavens, Mr. Hewitt, his whole tale must have been a delusion! A mere madman's fancy! Poor fellow! We must go back, Mr. Hewitt--we really must! We can't leave that poor girl there alone with a raving maniac!\"  \"No,\" Hewitt insisted, \"come to the rectory. That is no madness, Mr. Potswood. Couldn't you see the colour of the man under the eyes, and the shaking of his beard? That was not anger and it was not madness. It was terror, Mr. Potswood--sheer, sick terror! Terror, or some emotion very much like it.\"  \"But, if terror, why that outburst? What does it mean? If it were terror, why not rather welcome our company and help?\"  \"Don't you see, Mr. Potswood?\" answered Hewitt. \"Don't you guess? _Mason is watched, and he knows it!_ He was acting his anger before unseen eyes--and he knew they were on him!\"  \"God be merciful to us all,\" ejaculated the clergyman. \"Poor man--poor sinner! What is this unspeakable thing which has him in its clutches? What had he done to give himself over to such a power?\"  \"We can tell nothing, and guess nothing, as yet,\" Hewitt answered. \"Let us see if he has sent you a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28077"],["title","Friends in Feathers and Fur, and Other Neighbors: For Young Folks (#0)"],["body","(http://www.pgdpcanada.net) from digital material generously made available by Internet Archive/American Libraries (http://www.archive.org/details/americana)    Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustrations.

[Illustration]  A machine, turned by a crank, has been made to speak words, but nothing below a human being has been able to get thought from a written or printed page and convey it to others. To make the machine requires a vast amount of labor expended upon matter; to get the thought requires the awakening of a human spirit. The work of the machine is done when the crank stops; the mental work, through internal volition, goes on to ever higher achievements.  In schools much labor has been spent in trying to produce human speaking-machines. Words are built up out of letters; short words are grouped into inane sentences such as are never used; and sentences are arranged into unnatural and insipid discourse. To grasp the thin ghost of the thought, the little human spirit must reverse its instinct to reach toward the higher, and, mole-like, burrow downward.  The amount of effort spent in this way, if given to awakening thought, would much more effectively secure the mechanical ends sought, and at the same time would yield fruit in other fields of mental activity.  The matter selected for these higher and better purposes must possess a human interest. The thoughts that bear fruit are those with roots set in past experiences, but which, outgrowing these experiences, reach out toward new light.  In this little book we have again given the initial steps of science rather than the expression of scientific results. Beginning with familiar forms of life, the pupil is led to see more clearly that which is about him, and then to advance into the realm of the unknown with assured steps, in the tried paths of investigation and comparison.  While giving prominence to the facts that inform, we have not been unmindful of the fancy that stimulates. The steady flow of description is frequently interrupted by the ripple of story and verse. While we have made no effort to secure the favor of Mr. Gradgrind by looking at facts only on their lower side, we trust that our effort may prove of some service in the anxious work of parent and teacher.

There sits the lady,     Folding up the clothes;      In comes a blackbird,     And nips off her nose!   [Illustration: Chickens at Home.]     LESSON I.  _HOW FOWLS LOOK._  [Illustration]  1. Here we find the hen and chickens, a new company of our farm-yard friends. We see that they are very unlike the other friends we have been studying, and, though we know them well, we may find out something new about them.  2. Instead of a coat of hair or fur, the hen is covered with feathers, all pointing backward and lying over each other, so that the rain falls off as from the shingles of a house.  3. When we studied the cat, we found that she had four legs for walking and running, and that she used the paws on her front legs for scratching and catching her prey.  4. We have but two legs for walking or running, our fore legs being arms, and our paws, hands.  5. These new friends, the chickens, have but two legs, and in this way are more like boys and girls than are cats and dogs.  [Illustration]  6. But the chicken has the same number of limbs as the others, only those in front are wings instead of fore legs or arms.  7. Here is a picture of the legs and feet of a hen. We see that the legs are covered with scales, and that each foot has four toes, three pointing forward and one back. Each toe has a long, sharp, and strong nail.  8. Let us look at the hen when she is walking slowly! As she lifts up each foot, her toes curl up, very much as our fingers do when we double them up to make a fist.  [Illustration]  9. When the chicken is about a year old, a spur, hard like horn, begins to grow on the inside of each leg. Upon the old cocks these spurs are long and sharp, and he can strike savage blows with them.  10. It is when we look a hen in the face that we see how much it differs from all the animals we have studied before.  [Illustration]  11. The head stands up straight, and the eyes are placed on each side, so that it can look forward, to the side, and partly backward.  12. Two little ears are just back and below the eyes; at first we would hardly know what they are, they are so small and unlike the other ears which we have seen.  13. All the lower part of the face is a bill, hard like horn, and running out to a point. The bill opens and makes the mouth, and two holes in the upper part make the nose.  14. As the whole bill is hard like bone, the hen does not need teeth, and does not have any. She was never known to complain with the tooth-ache.  15. Large bits of food she scratches apart with her feet, or breaks up with her bill; but, as she can not chew, the pieces she takes into her mouth she swallows whole.  16. Upon the top of the head is a red, fleshy comb, which is much larger on cocks than on hens. This comb is sometimes single, and sometimes double.  17. Under the bill on each side there hangs down a wattle of red flesh that looks very much like the comb.  18. The tail of the cock has long feathers, which curl over the rest and give him a very graceful appearance.     LESSON II.  _WHAT FOWLS DO._  [Illustration]  1. When the hen walks, she folds her wings close by her side; but when she flies, she spreads them out like a fan. Her body is so heavy that she can fly but a little ways without resting.  2. At night fowls find a place to roost upon a tree, or a piece of timber placed high on purpose for them. Their toes cling around the stick that they stand on, so that they do not fall off.  3. Fowls live upon grain, bugs, and worms. With their long nails and strong toes they scratch in the earth, and "]]]
