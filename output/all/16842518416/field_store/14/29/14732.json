THE ELK OR WAPITI--THE NOBLEST OF ALL DEER  The Rocky Mountain Elk, or Wapiti, is the finest of all true Deer. The cows weigh 400 to 500 pounds, the bulls 600 or 800, but occasionally 1000. At several of the hotels a small herd is kept in a corral for the pleasure and photography of visitors.  The latest official census puts the summer population of Elk in the Yellowstone Park at 35,000, but the species is migratory, at least to the extent of seeking a winter feeding ground with as little snow as possible, so that most of them move out as snow time sets in. Small herds linger in the rich and sheltered valleys along the Yellowstone, Snake and nearby rivers, but the total of those wintering in the Park is probably less than 5,000.   STALKING A BAND OF ELK  [Illustration]  In the summer months the best places in which to look for these Deer are all the higher forests, especially along the timber-line. I had an interesting stalk after a large band of them among the woods of Tower Falls in the June of 1897. I had found the trail of a considerable herd and followed it up the mountain till the \"sign\" was fresh. Then I tied up my horse and went forward on foot. For these animals are sufficiently acquainted with man as a mischief-maker to be vigilant in avoiding him, even in the Park. I was cautiously crawling from tree to tree, when out across an open space I descried a cow Elk and her calf lying down. A little more crawling and I sighted a herd all lying down and chewing the cud. About twenty yards away was a stump whose shelter offered chances to use the camera, but my present position promised nothing, so I set out carefully to cross the intervening space in plain view of scores of Elk; and all would have been well but for a pair of mischievous little Chipmunks. They started a most noisy demonstration against my approach, running back and forth across my path, twittering and flashing their tails about. In vain I prayed for a paralytic stroke to fall on my small tormentors. Their aggravating plan, if plan it was, they succeeded in fully carrying out. The Elk turned all their megaphone ears, their funnel noses and their blazing telescopic eyes my way. I lay like a log and waited; so did they. Then the mountain breeze veered suddenly and bore the taint of man to those watchful mothers. They sprang to their feet, some fifty head at least, half of them with calves by their sides, and away they dashed with a roaring sound, and a rattling and crashing of branches that is wonderfully impressive to hear, and nothing at all to tell about.  I had made one or two rough sketches as I lay on the ground, but the photographs were failures.  [Illustration: XII. A young investigator among the Deer at Fort Yellowstone _Photo by E. T. Seton_]  [Illustration: XIII. Elk in Wyoming: (a) \"Dawn\" _Photo by E. T. Seton_ (b) \"Nightfall\" _Photo by G. G. Seton_]  This band contained only cows engaged in growing their calves. According to Elk etiquette, the bulls are off by themselves at a much higher elevation, engaged in the equally engrossing occupation of growing their antlers. Most persons are surprised greatly when first they learn that the huge antlers of the Elk, as with most deer, are grown and shed each year. It takes only five months to grow them. They are perfect in late September for the fighting season, and are shed in March. The bull Elk now shapes his conduct to his weaponless condition. He becomes as meek as he was warlike. And so far from battling with all of their own sex that come near, these big \"moollys\" gather in friendly stag-parties on a basis of equal loss, and haunt the upper woods whose pasture is rich enough to furnish the high power nutriment needed to offset the exhausting drain of growing such mighty horns in such minimum time.  They are more free from flies too in these high places, which is important, for even the antlers are sensitive while growing. They are even more sensitive than the rest of the body, besides being less protected and more temptingly filled with blood. A mosquito would surely think he had struck it rich if he landed on the hot, palpitating end of a Wapiti's thin-skinned, blood-gorged antlers. It is quite probable that some of the queer bumps we see on the finished weapons are due to mosquito or fly stings suffered in the early period of formation.   THE BUGLING ELK  During the summer the bulls attend strictly to their self-development, but late August sees them ready to seek once more the mixed society of their kind. Their horns are fully grown, but are not quite hardened and are still covered with velvet. By the end of September these weapons are hard and cleaned and ready for use, just as a thrilling change sets in in the body and mind of the bull. He is full of strength and vigour, his coat is sleek, his neck is swollen, his muscles are tense, his horns are clean, sharp, and strong, and at their heaviest. A burning ambition to distinguish himself in war, and win favours from the shy ladies of his kind, grows in him to a perfect insanity; goaded by desire, boiling with animal force, and raging with war-lust, he mounts some ridge in the valley and pours forth his very soul in a wild far-reaching battle-cry. Beginning low and rising in pitch to a veritable scream of piercing intensity, it falls to a rumbled growl, which broken into shorter growls dies slowly away. This is the famed bugling of the Elk, and however grotesque it may seem when heard in a zoo, is admitted by all who know it in its homeland to be the most inspiring music in nature--because of what it means. Here is this magnificent creature, big as a horse, strong as a bull, and fierce as a lion, standing in all the pride and glory of his primest prime, announcing to all the world: \"I am out for a fight! Do any of you want a F-I-G-H-T----!-!-!?\" Nor does he usually have long to wait. From some far mountainside the answer comes:  \"Yes, yes, yes! _Yes, I Do_, Do, Do, Do!\"  A few more bugle blasts and the two great giants meet; and when they do, all the world knows it for a mile around, without it being seen. The crashing of the antlers as they close, the roars of hate, the squeals of combat, the cracking of breaking branches as they charge and charge, and push and strive, and--_sometimes_ the thud of a heavy body going down.  Many a time have I heard them in the distant woods, but mostly at night. Often have I gone forth warily hoping to see something of the fight, for we all love to see a fight when not personally in danger; but luck has been against me. I have been on the battlefield next morning to see where the combatants had torn up an acre of ground, and trampled unnumbered saplings, or tossed huge boulders about like pebbles, but the fight I missed.  One day as I came into camp in the Shoshonees, east of the Park, an old hunter said: \"Say, you! you want to see a real old-time Elk fight? You go up on that ridge back of the corral and you'll sure see a hull bunch of 'em at it; not one pair of bulls, but _six_ of 'em.\"  I hurried away, but again I was too late; I saw nothing but the trampled ground, the broken saplings, and the traces of the turmoil; the battling giants were gone.  [Illustration]  Back I went and from the hunter's description made the sketch which I give below. The old man said: \"Well, you sure got it this time. That's exactly like it was. One pair was jest foolin', one was fencing and was still perlite; but that third pair was a playin' the game for keeps. An' for givin' the facts, that's away ahead of any photograph I ever seen.\"  Once I did come on the fatal battle-ground, but it was some time after the decision; and there I found the body of the one who did not win. The antlers are a fair index of the size and vigour of the stag, and if the fallen one was so big and strong, what like was he who downed him, pierced him through and left him on the plain.   SNAPPING A CHARGING BULL  At one time in a Californian Park I heard the war-bugle of an Elk. He bawled aloud in brazen, ringing tones: \"Anybody want a F-I-G-H-T t-t-t-t!!\"  I extemporized a horn and answered him according to his mood. \"_Yes, I do; bring it ALONG!_\" and he brought it at a trot, squealing and roaring as he came. When he got within forty yards he left the cover and approached me, a perfect incarnation of brute ferocity and hate.  [Illustration]  His ears were laid back, his muzzle raised, his nose curled up, his lower teeth exposed, his mane was bristling and in his eyes there blazed a marvellous fire of changing opalescent green. On he marched, gritting his teeth and uttering a most unpleasantly wicked squeal.  Then suddenly down went his head, and he came crash at me, with all the power of half a ton of hate. However, I was not so much exposed as may have been inferred. I was safely up a tree. And there I sat watching that crazy bull as he prodded the trunk with his horns, and snorted, and raved around, telling me just what he thought of me, inviting him to a fight and then getting up a tree. Finally he went off roaring and gritting his teeth, but turning back to cast on me from time to time the deadly, opaque green light of his mad, malignant eyes.  A friend of mine, John Fossum, once a soldier attached to Fort Yellowstone, had a similar adventure on a more heroic scale. While out on a camera hunt in early winter he descried afar a large bull Elk lying asleep in an open valley. At once Fossum made a plan. He saw that he could crawl up to the bull, snap him where he lay, then later secure a second picture as the creature ran for the timber. The first part of the programme was carried out admirably. Fossum got within fifty feet and still the Elk lay sleeping. Then the camera was opened out. But alas! that little _pesky_ \"click,\" that does so much mischief, awoke the bull, who at once sprang to his feet and ran--not for the woods--but _for the man_. Fossum with the most amazing nerve stood there quietly focussing his camera, till "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27897"],["title","The Kopje Garrison: A Story of the Boer War (#0)"],["body","Kopje Garrison, by George Manville Fenn.   CHAPTER ONE.  HOW DREW LENNOX AND BOB DICKENSON WENT A-FISHING.  They did not look like fishermen, those two young men in khaki, for people do not generally go fishing with magazine-rifles instead of fishing-rods--certainly not in England.  But this was in South Africa, and that makes all the difference.  In addition, they were fishing in a South African river, where both of them were in profound ignorance as to what might take their bait first; and they were talking about this when they first reached the bank and saw the swift river flowing onward--a lovely river whose banks were like cliffs, consequent upon ages of the swift stream cutting its way downward through the soft earth, while here and there clumps of trees grew luxuriantly green, and refreshed the eyes of the lookers-on after a couple of months spent in riding over the drab and dreary veldt.  \"Tackle isn't half strong enough,\" said the younger of the two, who was nearly good-looking; in fact, he would have been handsome if he had not always worn so stupid an aspect.  \"Think there are any crocodiles here?\"  \"Likely enough, Bobby.\"  \"S'pose one of them takes the bait?\"  \"Well, suppose he does!\" said the other, who resembled his companion, minus the stupid look; for if the keen, dark-grey eyes were truth-tellers of what was behind them, he was, as the men in his company said, sharp as a needle.  \"S'pose he does!\" said the young man addressed as Bobby--otherwise Robert Dickenson, second lieutenant in Her Majesty's --th Mounted Infantry.  \"Well, that's a cool way of talking.  Suppose he does!  Why, suppose one of the great magnified efts swallows the bait?\"  \"Suppose he does.  What then?\"  \"Why, he'll be more likely to pull me in than let me pull him out.\"  \"No doubt about it, if the line doesn't break.\"  \"What should I do then, Drew, old man?\"  \"I don't know what you'd do, my little man.  I know what I should do.\"  \"Yes.  What?\"  \"Let go.\"  \"Ah, I didn't think of that,\" said the young officer quite calmly.  \"I say, though, if it turned out to be a hippopotamus?\"  \"I wish it would, Bobby--that is, so long as it was a nice fat calf. I'm so ragingly hungry that I should look upon a steak off one of those india-rubber gentlemen as the greatest delicacy under the sun.\"  \"Oh, don't talk nonsense.  One of those things wouldn't be likely to bite.  But I say, Drew, old chap, do you think there are any fish to be caught?\"  \"I haven't the slightest idea, Bobby.  But here's a river; it looks likely.  Fishes live in rivers; why shouldn't they be here?\"  \"To be sure; why not?\" said the other, brightening up and looking better.  \"Who knows?  There may be carp and tench, eels and pike.\"  \"Not likely, Bobby, my lad; but most probably there are fish of some kind, such as live on this side of the equator.\"  \"Mahseer, perhaps--eh?\"  \"Bah!  This is Africa, not northern India.  Let's get down and make a beginning.  We had better get down through that woody rift.\"  \"I wish I'd got my six-jointed rod, old fellow.\"  \"But as you haven't, we must try what we can do with a line.\"  \"I say, it was lucky you thought to bring some hooks.\"  \"They were meant to try in the sea, old fellow, but I never had a chance.  Come softly, and be on the lookout.\"  \"Eh?\" cried the young man addressed, bringing the rifle he carried to the ready.  \"Boers?\"  \"Oh no; our fellows are not likely to let any of those gentlemen approach.  I thought we might perhaps put up a deer, antelope, buck, or something.\"  \"Venison roast, hot, juicy!  Oh Drew, old man, don't; pray don't!  You gave me such an awful pang.  Oh dear! oh dear!\"  \"Pst!  Quiet!  Don't build your hopes on anything, because I dare say we shall be disappointed; but still we might.\"  \"Ah, might!\" said the young officer.  \"Oh dear!  I thought we might get wounded, or have a touch of fever, but I never expected that we should run the risk of being starved to death.\"  \"Then give us a chance of escaping that fate by keeping your tongue quiet.  If we don't get a shot at something down there, we may still hit upon a bag of fish.\"  \"Forward!\" whispered the young officer, and together the pair approached the wooded gully and cautiously began to descend it to reach the river; but all proved to be silent, and in spite of their caution not a bush rustled, and their patient movements were in vain.  \"I did expect a shot at something,\" said the elder officer in a disappointed tone.  \"Venison was too much,\" said Bobby.  \"I expected it would be a sneaking leopard, or one of those doggy-looking monkeys.\"  \"The baboons?  Oh no; they'd be among the rocky hills.  But you need not be surprised, for this is the land of disappointments.\"  \"Oh, I say, don't talk like that, Drew, old chap,\" said the younger officer.  \"Fishermen have bad luck enough always, without your prophesying ill before we begin.\"  \"One can't help it out here.  Hang it all! we've had nothing but misfortunes ever since we came.  Now then, you sit down on that rock, and I'll sit on this.\"  \"Why not keep close together?\"  \"Because if we do we shall be getting our lines tangled.\"  \"Of course; I forgot that.  Here, you'll want some bait.\"  The speaker took a small tin canister from his pocket, unscrewed the lid, and made by the help of his pocket-knife a fair division of some nasty, sticky-looking paste, which looked as if it would soon wash off the hook upon which it was placed; and then the two fishermen separated and took up their stations about fifty yards apart, the two stones standing well out in the rapid current which washed around them and proved advantageous, from the fact that they had only to drop the baited hook into the water at their feet, when the swift stream bore it outward and away, the fishers merely having to let out line and wait, watchful and patient, for a bite.  It was very calm and beautiful in the bend of the river that they had chosen.  There was a faint breeze, apparently caused by the rush of the stream, whose rippling amongst the stones with which the shore beneath the cliff-like bank was strewed made pleasant music; and as soon as the whole of the line was paid out the two young men sat silent and watchful, waiting for the tug which should tell that there was a fish at work.  But a good ten minutes elapsed, and there was no sign.  \"Humph!\" grunted Dickenson, after his patience was exhausted.  \"No mistake about there being fish here.\"  \"How do you know?\"  \"One of them has taken my bait.\"  It was on Drew's lips to say, \"Washed off by the stream;\" but he remained silent as he softly pulled in his own line, to find nothing but the bare hook.  \"There! do you see?\" he said softly, the sound of his voice passing over the water so that it was like a whisper at his friend's ear, as he dangled the bare hook.  \"Oh yes, I see: fish nibbled it off.\"  \"Hope you are right,\" said Drew softly, as he rebaited, dropped in the white marble of paste, and watched it glide down the stream, drawing out one by one the rings of line which he had carefully coiled up on the rock when he drew it out.  Then stooping and picking a long, heavy, stream-washed, slaty fragment from out of the water by his side, he made the end of his line fast to it and laid it at his feet, so as to have his hands at liberty.  With these he drew out a cigarette-case and opened it, but his brow puckered up as he looked disconsolately at its contents.  \"The last two,\" he said softly.  \"Better keep 'em.  Be more hungry perhaps by-and-by.\"  Closing the case, he replaced it in his breast-pocket.  \"The hardest job I know of,\" he muttered, \"practising self-denial.\" Then aloud, \"Well, Bob, do they bite?\"  \"No: only suck.  Lost two more baits; but I shall have a big one directly.\"  \"Glad of it.  How will you cook it--roast or boil?\"  \"Don't chaff.  Mind your own line.\"  Drew Lennox smiled, glanced down at his line, which the stream had now drawn out tight, and, satisfied that the stone to which it was tied would give him fair warning if he were fortunate enough to get a bite, he stepped back, picked up his rifle, and taking out his handkerchief, began to give it a rub here and a rub there, to add polish to the well-cleaned barrel, trigger-guard, and lock.  He took some time over this, but at last all was to his satisfaction; and laying down the piece on the rock by his side, he once more drew up his line, glancing up-stream, to see that his companion was similarly occupied, both finding the bait gone.  \"I say, isn't it aggravating?\" said Dickenson.  \"I know what they are-- sort of mullet-like fish with small mouths.  Put on a smaller bait.\"  \"All right; good plan,\" said Lennox.  \"Wish to goodness I'd a few well-scoured English worms.  I'd soon let the fish know!\"  \"Ah, I suppose they would be useful,\" said Lennox, moulding up a piece of paste and trying to make it as hard as he could.  \"I say, Bob.\"  \"Hullo!\"  \"I've read that you can dig up great fat worms here in South Africa, eighteen inches long.\"  \"Dig one up, then, and I'll cut it into eighteen inch-long baits.\"  \"I didn't bring a spade with me, old fellow,\" said Drew, smiling.  \"Humph!  Why didn't you?\"  \"Same reason that you didn't bring out some worms in your kit.  I say, are you loaded?\"  \"Of course.  You asked me before.\"  Drew Lennox said no more, but glanced up-stream and down-stream, after starting his bait once again upon its swim.  Then, after watching the rings uncoil till the line was tight, he swept the edge of the opposite bank some fifty yards away, carefully searching the clumps of trees and bushes, partly in search of a lurking enemy or spying Kaffir, taught now by experience always to be on the alert, and partly in the faint hope of catching a glimpse of something in the shape of game such as would prove welcome in the famine that he and his comrades were experiencing.  But, as he might have known in connection with game, their coming would have been quite sufficient to scare off the keen eared and eyed wild"]]]
