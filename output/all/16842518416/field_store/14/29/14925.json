The next worst thing in the world is a railroad train. He dies twice a mile regularly. _But_--Martin Beck said, \"Come at once.\"  So, with his suit-case full of Green River, Hermitage and other well-known mineral waters, a couple of lemons (who had been playing for Louis Shouse at Convention Hall the previous week), and his Orpheum pass, poor Lehman boarded the night train for Chicago, hoping for the best but expecting the worst--and getting it.  He got on board early so he could get into his berth before the train started. Lower seven, right in the middle of the car. He placed his bottles of life preservers in the little hammock beside him, punched a little hole in the end of one of the lemons, closed his eyes and said his evening prayer.  The train started. So did his troubles. The train gained headway. Ditto the trouble. But, like his forefathers in far-away Prussia, he fought for freedom. He brought all the strength of his powerful mind to bear. He tried \"The New Thought,\" \"Self-Hypnotism,\" \"Silent Prayer\"; he tried every religious belief he could think of except Mormonism. And finally he slept; or died; he was not sure which; and he didn't mind; he lost consciousness; that was all he cared for.  The next thing he knew somebody was shaking him and telling him to \"Change cars!\" It seemed that this car had developed a hot box and passengers would have to change to the car ahead, taking the same numbered berth in the new car that they had occupied in the first one.  Poor Lehman's getting up and dressing was absolute proof of the power of mind over matter. But finally, with part of his clothing on his back and the rest over his arm, he managed to stagger into the other car, only to discover that he had lost his berth ticket.  The conductor said that the only thing to do was to wait until the other passengers got located, and the berth that was left would naturally be his. It doesn't take a mind reader to see what he got. Upper number one; right over the wheels: just beside a smoky kerosene lamp.  As in all good novels we will now have a line of stars.         *       *       *       *       *  Arriving in Chicago, he varied the misery of the trip by a taxicab trip across the city to catch the New York train: this time drawing lower nine.  \"Troubles never come single.\" In the seat back of him was a woman with a baby. The lady in front of him indulged in perfume of a most violent type. The weather and the porter were warm and humid.  He went up into the smoking room, but some rude drummers were smoking in there so he had to come back to his seat. The lady in front of him said something about people \"reeking with tobacco smoke,\" and took another perfume shower-bath. Then the porter leaned over him to open the window.  So the day passed, and the night came; and Lehman went to bed. About two o'clock in the morning the end of the world came. Or so Lehman thought for a moment. It was afterwards discovered that the car he was on had broken a wheel and jumped the track. Upon coming to and taking account of stock, Lehman found that his injuries consisted of one fractured bottle, a dislocated vocabulary and a severe loss of temper.  For the second time on this awful trip he was invited to \"change to the car ahead.\" The first thing he did was to hunt through his clothes for his ticket. No more of that upper number one business for your Uncle Martin! No sir! Having at last found it, he placed it in his mouth, picked up what there was left of his clothes and made his way up ahead to the other car.  \"Tickets!\" said the conductor.  \"You bet!\" said Lehman, taking the ticket from his mouth and handing it to the conductor.  The conductor took it, copied the number on to his plan, handed the ticket to the porter and the porter took him in and put him to bed _again_.  Lehman tried to say his evening prayer again, but couldn't remember it. While he was thinking it over the door at the ladies' end of the car opened and something came down the aisle. As this \"something\" came out of the ladies' apartment, it was presumably a woman. But Lehman disputes that fact to this day. She was about six feet long, nine inches wide, all the way, and about the color of a cowhide trunk. Her hair was in curl papers, her teeth in her pocket and her trust in Heaven. Like a grenadier she marched down the aisle until she came to the berth where Lehman was trying to die as painlessly as possible. Upon arriving here she pulled the curtains aside, sat down on the edge of the berth, jabbed Lehman in the stomach with her elbow, and said loudly--  \"_Lay over!_\"  Lehman groaned, got one look at the female, then placed both feet in the small of her back and shot her out on to the floor, yelling loudly for the police.  The car was in an uproar in an instant. Lehman was lying on his back, shouting \"Police!\" The female was screaming and hunting for her teeth. The conductor, the porter and the brakeman came running in to see whether it was a political discussion or just a murder. All the old lady could do was to mumble and hunt for her teeth. A man across the aisle swore that he saw Lehman stab the old lady with a bowie knife and throw her out into the aisle. The woman with the baby corroborated him, excepting that she thought he hit her with a piece of lead pipe.  By this time the old lady had found part of her Fletcherizing outfit and informed the congregation that she was neither struck nor stabbed; but that her husband in the berth there had certainly gone crazy.  There was a sympathetic chorus of \"Oh!s\" from the other passengers and the conductor jerked the curtains aside and asked Lehman what he meant by treating his wife this way.  \"_My wife?_\" screamed Lehman. \"Why you ---- --!$!--&--$&'o$--! Are you calling that old goat face _my wife_?\"  \"Sure that's your wife! Don't you suppose she knows?\"  \"Well, don't you suppose _I know_! Do I look as if I would be the husband of anything that looks like _that_?\"  The old lady now caught sight of Lehman for the first time.  \"Why,\" she gasped; \"that isn't my husband.\"  \"I know darn well it ain't,\" said Lehman.  \"Then what are you doing in my berth?\" demanded the old lady.  \"I am not in your berth!\"  \"You _are_ in my berth!\"  \"Let's see your tickets,\" said the conductor.  \"Here is mine,\" said the old lady. \"Lower seven.\"  \"And here is mine,\" said Lehman. \"Lower seven.\"  The conductor looked at them closely; then stepped back under a lamp and looked at them closer. Then he handed the old lady's back to her. Then he turned to Lehman and, handing him his ticket, said,  \"That is your yesterday's ticket from Kansas City to Chicago.\" Lehman looked at it dazed for a moment, then dressed and went up into the baggage car where he sat on a trunk all the way to New York.         *       *       *       *       *  E.

Why do so many hotel bathrooms have warm cold water and cold hot water?  Why is it that on the morning you are expecting company you can never find the chambermaid? And every other morning she tries your door every fifteen minutes regularly.  Why does a hotel clerk always try to give you some room different from the one you ask for?  Why does a hotel cashier always look at you pityingly?  Why does a bellboy always try to get two quarts of water into a quart pitcher?  Why do hotels feed actors cheaper than they do folks?  Why is a mistake in the bill always in the hotel's favor?  Why does the landlord's wife always have theatrical trunks?  Why do drummers always leave their doors open?  Why does my wife always try to get a corner table, and then put me in the chair facing the wall?  Why do \"American\" hotels always have French and Italian cooks?  Why does the fellow in the next room always get up earlier than I do?  Why does the elevator boy always go clear to the top floor and back when the man on the second floor rings for him?  Why is the news stand girl always so haughty?  Why does the night clerk always dress so much better than the day clerks?  Why do I think I know so much about running a hotel?

This is the real thing in the Trouble line.  Max Faetkenheuer was musical director with an opera company that was playing through the South. They arrived in one town at four in the afternoon, and Max found the orchestra waiting at the theater. They looked doubtful; they sounded dreadful. Individually they were bad; collectively they were worse. During the first number the cornet only struck the right note once and that frightened him so he stopped playing. The clarinet player had been taking lessons from a banjo teacher for three years and had never made the same noise twice. There were six French horns, all Dutch. The trap drummer was blind and played by guess and by gorry.  Max labored and perspired and swore until 7:15; then he had to stop because the audience wanted to come in and didn't dare to while the riot was on.  \"Now look, Mister Cornet Player,\" Max said; \"I'll tell you what you do; you keep your mute in all through the show.\"  \"Yes, well, I shan't be here myself, but I will speak to my 'sub' about it.\"  \"What's the reason you won't be here?\" asked Max.  \"I play for a dance over to Masonic Hall.\"  \"So do I,\" said the bass fiddler.  \"We all do, but the drummer,\" said the flute player.  \"_You do?_ Then what the devil have you kept me here rehearsing you for three hours for?\" demanded Max.  \"Well,\" said the cornet player, \"we knew this was a big show, and we presumed you would be a good director, and we thought the practice would do us good.\"  \"It will,\" said Max.         *       *       *       *       *  On another occasion he struggled all the afternoon with a \"Glee Club and Mandolin Serenaders'\" orchestra. Finally, by cutting out all solos, playing all the accompaniments himself, and confining the \"Glee Club\" to \"um-pahs,\" he got everything figured out except the cornet player; he was beyond pardon; so Max said to him,  \"I am awful sorry, old man, but you won't do; so you just sit and watch the show to-night.\"  \"Oh,\" said the Not-Jule-Levy, \"then I don't play, eh?\"  \"You do not play,\" said Max.  \"All right then; then there'll be no show.\"  \"Why won't there be a show?\" asked Max.  \"Because I am the Mayor, and I will revoke your license.\"  He played.         *       *       *       *       *  At some Southern town we played once with \"The Old Homestead\"; the rehearsal was called for 4:30. At 4:30 all the musicians were there but the bass fiddler.  \"Where is your bass fiddler?\" asked our director.  \"Well, he can't get here just yet,\" replied one of the other players.  \"When will he be here?\"  \"Well, if it rains he is liable to be in any minute now; if it don't rain he can't get here until six o'clock.\"  \"What has the rain got to do with it?\"  \"He drives the sprinkling cart.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The worst orchestra I ever heard was with an Uncle Tom's Cabin show playing East St. Louis. It consisted of two pieces; a clarinet and a bass fiddle, each worse than the other.         *       *       *       *       *  At North Goram, Maine, I once hired an entire brass band of twenty-two pieces to play for an entire evening of roller skating in the town hall, for three dollars.

At the top of the first column are the words--\"In Hoc Signo Vinces.\" One day one of the stage hands came to me with a copy of the paper in his hands, and pointing to this line, said,  \"That means 'We Shoot to Kill,' don't it?\"         *       *       *       *       *  My wife was in a hair-dressing parlor in Cleveland; the girl who was doing what ever she was doing to her, discovered that she was the Miss Dayne at Keith's Theater.  \"Oh, say,\" she said, \"I wish you would tell me something.\"  \"Yes? what is it?\" asked Miss D.  \"Is that old man that plays on the stage with you as homely as he looks? His face is just like one of those soft rubber faces that the men sell on the street; the ones you pinch up into all sorts of shapes. He doesn't look as bad as that all the time, does he?\"  Miss D. told her that there was not much choice.         *       *       *       *       *  Jim Thornton was playing his first engagement for"]]]
