Thus I left him to oversee the building of these mighty ships, which have been and will ever be the might of these small islands.  But, even as I went speeding through dark streets, in my ears, rising high above the hum of our engine was the unceasing din, the remorseless ring and clash of the riveting-hammers.     V  SHIPS IN MAKING    Build me straight, O worthy Master!    Staunch and strong, a goodly vessel,  That shall laugh at all disaster    And with wave and whirlwind wrestle!                       --_Longfellow._  He was an old man with that indefinable courtliness of bearing that is of a past generation; tall and spare he was, his white head bowed a little by weight of years, but almost with my first glance I seemed to recognise him instinctively for that \"worthy Master Builder of goodly vessels staunch and strong!\" So the Master Builder I will call him.  He stood beside me at the window with one in the uniform of a naval captain, and we looked, all three of us, at that which few might behold unmoved.  \"She's a beauty!\" said the Captain. \"She's all speed and grace from cutwater to sternpost.\"  \"I've been building ships for sixty-odd years and we never launched a better!\" said the Master Builder.  As for me I was dumb.  She lay within a stone's throw, a mighty vessel, huge of beam and length, her superstructure towering proudly aloft, her massive armoured sides sweeping up in noble curves, a Super-Dreadnought complete from trucks to keelson. Yacht-like she sat the water all buoyant grace from lofty prow to tapering counter, and to me there was something sublime in the grim and latent power, the strength and beauty of her.  \"But she's not so very--big, is she?\" enquired a voice behind me.  The Captain stared; the Master Builder smiled.  \"Fairly!\" he nodded. \"Why do you ask?\"  \"Well, I usually reckon the size of a ship from the number of her funnels, and--\"  \"Ha!\" exclaimed the Captain explosively.  \"Humph!\" said the Master Builder gently. \"After luncheon you shall measure her if you like, but now I think we will go and eat.\"  During a most excellent luncheon the talk ranged from ships and books and guns to submarines and seaplanes, with stories of battle and sudden death, tales of risk and hardship, of noble courage and heroic deeds, so that I almost forgot to eat and was sorry when at last we rose from table.  Once outside I had the good fortune to find myself between the Captain and the venerable figure of the Master Builder, in whose company I spent a never-to-be-forgotten afternoon. With them I stood alongside this noble ship which, seen thus near, seemed mightier than ever.  \"Will she be fast?\" I enquired.  \"Very fast--for a Dreadnought!\" said the Captain.  \"And at top speed she'll show no bow wave to speak of,\" added the veteran. \"See how fine her lines are fore and aft.\"  \"And her gun power will be enormous!\" said the Captain.  Hard by I espied a solitary being, who stood, chin in hand, lost in contemplation of this large vessel.  \"Funnels or not, she's bigger than you thought?\" I enquired of him.  He glanced at me, shook his head, sighed, and took himself by the chin again.  \"Holy smoke!\" said he.  \"And you have been building ships for sixty years?\" I asked of the venerable figure beside me.  \"And more!\" he answered; \"and my father built ships hereabouts so long ago as 1820, and his grandfather before him.\"  \"Back to the times of Nelson and Rodney and Anson,\" said I, \"great seamen all, who fought great ships! What would they think of this one, I wonder?\"  \"That she was a worthy successor,\" replied the Master Builder, letting his eyes, so old and wise in ships, wander up and over the mighty fabric before us. \"Yes,\" he nodded decisively, \"she's worthy--like the men who will fight her one of these days.\"  \"But our enemies and some of our friends rather thought we had degenerated these latter days,\" I suggested.  \"Ah, well!\" said he very quietly, \"they know better now, don't you think?\"  \"Yes,\" said I, and again, \"Yes.\"  \"Slow starters always,\" continued he musingly; \"but the nation that can match us in staying power has yet to be born!\"  So walking between these two I listened and looked and asked questions, and of what I heard, and of what I saw I could write much; but for the censor I might tell of armour-belts of enormous thickness, of guns of stupendous calibre, of new methods of defence against sneaking submarine and torpedo attack, and of devices new and strange; but of these I may neither write nor speak, because of the aforesaid censor. Suffice it that as the sun sank, we came, all three, to a jetty whereto a steamboat lay moored, on whose limited deck were numerous figures, divers of whom beckoned me on.  So with hearty farewells, I stepped aboard the steamboat, whereupon she snorted and fell suddenly a-quiver as she nosed out into the broad stream while I stood to wave my hat in farewell.  Side by side they stood, the Captain tall and broad and sailor-like in his blue and gold--a man of action, bold of eye, hearty of voice, free of gesture; the other, his silver hair agleam in the setting sun, a man wise with years, gentle and calm-eyed, my Master Builder. Thus, as the distance lengthened, I stood watching until presently they turned, side by side, and so were gone.  Slowly we steamed down the river, a drab, unlovely waterway, but a wonderful river none the less, whose banks teem with workers where ships are building--ships by the mile, by the league; ships of all shapes and of all sizes, ships of all sorts and for many different purposes. Here are great cargo boats growing hour by hour with liners great and small; here I saw mile on mile of battleships, cruisers, destroyers and submarines of strange design with torpedo boats of uncanny shape; tramp steamers, windjammers, squat colliers and squatter tugs, these last surely the ugliest craft that ever wallowed in water. Mine layers were here with mine sweepers and hospital ships--a heterogeneous collection of well-nigh every kind of ship that floats.  Some lay finished and ready for launching, others, just begun, were only a sketch--a hint of what soon would be a ship.  On our right were ships, on our left were ships and more ships, a long perspective; ships by the million tons--until my eyes grew a-weary of ships and I went below.  Truly a wonderful river, this, surely in its way the most wonderful river eyes may see, a sight I shall never forget, a sight I shall always associate with the stalwart figure of the Captain and the white hair and venerable form of the Master Builder as they stood side by side to wave adieu.     VI  THE BATTLE CRUISERS   Beneath the shadow of a mighty bridge I stepped into a very smart launch manned by sailors in overalls somewhat grimy, and, rising and falling to the surge of the broad river, we held away for a destroyer that lay grey and phantom-like, low, rakish, and with speed in every line of her. As we drew near, her narrow deck looked to my untutored eye a confused litter of guns, torpedo tubes, guy ropes, cables and windlasses. Howbeit, I clambered aboard, and ducking under a guy rope and avoiding sundry other obstructions, shook hands with her commander, young, clear-eyed and cheery of mien, who presently led me past a stumpy smokestack and up a perpendicular ladder to the bridge where, beneath a somewhat flimsy-looking structure, was the wheel, brass-bound and highly be-polished like all else about this crowded craft as, notably, the binnacle and certain brass-bound dials, on the faces whereof one might read such words as: Ahead, Astern, Fast, Slow, etc. Forward of this was a platform, none too roomy, where was a gun most carefully wrapped and swaddled in divers cloths, tarpaulins, etc.--wrapped up with as much tender care as if it had been a baby, and delicate at that. But, as the commander casually informed me, they had been out patrolling all night and \"it had blown a little\"--wherefore I surmised the cloths and tarpaulins aforesaid.  \"I should think,\" I ventured, observing her sharp lines and slender build, \"I should think she would roll rather frightfully when it does blow a little?\"  \"Well, she does a bit,\" he admitted, \"but not so much--Starboard!\" said he, over his shoulder, to the bearded mariner at the wheel. \"Take us round by the _Tiger_.\"  \"Aye, aye, sir!\" retorted the bearded one as we began to slide through the water.  \"Yes, she's apt to roll a bit, perhaps, but she's not so bad,\" he continued; \"besides, you get used to it.\"  Here he fell to scanning the haze ahead through a pair of binoculars, a haze through which, as we gathered speed, ghostly shapes began to loom, portentous shapes that grew and grew upon the sight, turret, superstructure and embattled mast; here a mighty battle cruiser, yonder a super-destroyer, one after another, quiet-seeming on this autumn morning, and yet whose grim hulks held latent potentialities of destruction and death, as many of them have proved but lately.  As we passed those silent, monstrous shapes, the Commander named them in turn, names which had been flashed round the earth not so long ago, names which shall yet figure in the histories to come with Grenville's _Revenge_, Drake's _Golden Hind_, Blake's _Triumph_, Anson's _Centurion_, Nelson's _Victory_ and a score of other deathless names--glorious names that make one proud to be of the race that manned and fought them.  Peacefully they rode at their moorings, the water lapping gently at their steel sides, but, as we steamed past, on more than one of them, and especially the grim _Tiger_, I saw the marks of the Jutland battle in dinted plate, scarred funnel and superstructure, taken when for hours on end the dauntless six withstood the might of the German fleet.  So, as we advanced past these battle-scarred ships, I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27866"],["title","Great Britain at War (#4)"],["body","a sense of awe, that indefinable uplift of soul one is conscious of when treading with soft and reverent foot the dim aisles of some cathedral hallowed by time and the dust of our noble dead.  \"This afternoon,\" said the Commander, offering me his cigarette case, \"they're going to show you over the _Warspite_--the German Navy have sunk her so repeatedly, you know. There,\" he continued, nodding towards a fleet of squat-looking vessels with stumpy masts, \"those are the auxiliaries--coal and oil and that sort of thing--ugly beggars, but useful. How about a whisky and soda?\"  Following him down the perpendicular ladder, he brought me aft to a hole in the deck, a small hole, a round hole into which he proceeded to insert himself, first his long legs, then his broad shoulders, evidently by an artifice learned of much practice. Finally his jauntily be-capped head vanished, and thereafter from the deeps below his cheery voice reached me.  \"I have whisky, sherry and rum--mind your head and take your choice!\"  I descended into a narrow chamber divided by a longish table and flanked by berths with a chest of drawers beneath each. At the further end of this somewhat small and dim apartment and northeasterly of the table was a small be-polished stove wherein a fire burned; in a rack against a bulkhead were some half-dozen rifles, above our head was a rack for cutlasses, and upon the table was a decanter of whisky he had unearthed from some mysterious recess, and he was very full of apologies because the soda had run out.  So we sat awhile and quaffed and talked, during which he showed me a favourite rifle, small of bore but of high power and exquisite balance, at sight of which I straightway broke the tenth commandment. He also showed me a portrait of his wife (which I likewise admired), a picture taken by himself and by him developed in some dark nook aboard.  After this, our whisky being duly despatched, we crawled into the air again, to find we were approaching a certain jetty. And now, in the delicate manoeuvre of bringing to and making fast, my companions, myself and all else were utterly forgotten, as with voice and hand he issued order on order until, gently as a nesting bird, the destroyer came to her berth and was made fast. Hereupon, having shaken hands all round, he handed us over to other naval men as cheery as he, who in due season brought us to the dep ship, where luncheon awaited us.  I have dined in many places and have eaten with many different folk, but never have I enjoyed a meal more than this, perhaps because of the padre who presided at my end of the table. A manly cleric this, bright-eyed, resolute of jaw but humorous of mouth, whose white choker did but seem to offset the virility of him. A man, I judged, who preached little and did much--a sailor's padre in very truth.  He told me how, but for an accident, he would have sailed with Admiral Cradock on his last, ill-fated cruise, where so many died that Right and Justice might endure.  \"Poor chaps!\" said I.  \"Yes,\" said he, gently, \"and yet it is surely a noble thing to--die greatly!\"  And surely, surely for all those who in cause so just have met Death unflinching and unafraid, who have taken hold upon that which we call Life and carried it through and beyond the portals of Death into a sphere of nobler and greater living--surely to such as these strong souls the Empire they served so nobly and loved so truly will one day enshrine them, their memory and deeds, on the brightest, most glorious page of her history, which shall be a monument more enduring than brass or stone, a monument that shall never pass away.  So we talked of ships and the sea and of men until, aware that the company had risen, we rose also, and donning hats and coats, set forth, talking still. Together we paced beside docks and along piers that stretched away by the mile, massive structures of granite and concrete, which had only come into being, so he told me, since the war.  Side by side we ascended the broad gangway, and side by side we set foot upon that battle-scarred deck whose timbers, here and there, showed the whiter patches of newer wood. Here he turned to give me his hand, after first writing down name and address, and, with mutual wishes of meeting again, went to his duties and left me to the wonders of this great ship.  Crossing the broad deck, more spacious it seemed than an ocean liner, I came where my travelling companions were grouped about a grim memorial of the Jutland battle, a huge projectile that had struck one of the after turrets, in the doing of which it had transformed itself into a great, convoluted disc, and was now mounted as a memento of that tremendous day.  And here it was I became acquainted with my Midshipmite, who looked like an angel of sixteen, bore himself like a veteran, and spoke (when his shyness had worn off a little) like a British fighting man.  To him I preferred the request that he would pilot me over this great vessel, which he (blushing a little) very readily agreed to do. Thereafter, in his wake, I ascended stairways, climbed ladders, wriggled through narrow spaces, writhed round awkward corners, up and ever up.  \"It's rather awkward, I'm afraid, sir,\" said he in his gentle voice, hanging from an iron ladder with one hand and a foot, the better to address me. \"You see, we never bring visitors this way as a rule--\"  \"Good!\" said I, crushing my hat on firmer. \"The unbeaten track for me--lead on!\"  Onward and upward he led until all at once we reached a narrow platform, railed round and hung about with plaited rope screens which he called splinter-mats, over which I had a view of land and water, of ships and basins, of miles of causeways and piers, none of which had been in existence before the war. And immediately below me, far, far down, was the broad white sweep of deck, with the forward turrets where were housed the great guns whose grim muzzles stared patiently upwards, nuzzling the air almost as though scenting another battle.  And standing in this coign of vantage, in my mind's eye I saw this mighty vessel as she had been, the heave of the fathomless sea below, the whirling battle-smoke about her, the air full of the crashing thunder of her guns as she quivered 'neath their discharge. I heard the humming drone of shells coming from afar, a hum that grew to a wail--a shriek--and the sickening crash as they smote her or threw up great waterspouts high as her lofty fighting-tops; I seemed to hear through it all the ring of electric bells from the various fire-controls, and voices calm and all unshaken by the hellish din uttering commands down the many speaking-tubes.  \"And you,\" said I, turning to the youthful figure beside me, \"you were in the battle?\"  He blushingly admitted that he was.  \"And how did you feel?\"  He wrinkled his smooth brow and laughed a little shyly.  \"Really I--I hardly know, sir.\"  I asked him if at such times one was not inclined to feel a trifle shaken, a little nervous, or, might one say, afraid?  \"Yes, sir,\" he agreed politely, \"I suppose so--only, you see, we were all too jolly busy to think about it!\"  \"Oh!\" said I, taking out a cigarette, \"too busy! Of course! I see! And where is the Captain during action, as a rule?\"  \"As a matter of fact he stood--just where you are, sir. Stood there the whole six hours it was hottest.\"  \"Here!\" I exclaimed. \"But it is quite exposed.\"  My Midshipmite, being a hardy veteran in world-shaking naval battles, permitted himself to smile.  \"But, you see, sir,\" he gently explained, \"it's really far safer out here than being shut up in a gun-turret or--or down below, on account of er--er--you understand, sir?\"  \"Oh, quite!\" said I, and thereafter thought awhile, and, receiving his ready permission, lighted my cigarette. \"I think,\" said I, as we prepared to descend from our lofty perch, \"I'm sure it's just--er--that kind of thing that brought one Francis Drake out of so very many tight corners. By the way--do you smoke?\"  My Midshipmite blushingly confessed he did, and helped himself from my case with self-conscious fingers.  Reaching the main deck in due season, I found I had contrived to miss the Chief Gunner's lecture on the great guns, whereupon who so agitated and bitterly apologetic as my Midshipmite, who there and then ushered me hastily down more awkward stairs and through narrow openings into a place of glistening, gleaming polish and furbishment where, beside the shining breech of a monster gun, muscular arm negligently leaning thereon, stood a round-headed, broad-shouldered man, he the presiding genius of this (as I afterwards found) most sacred place.  His lecture was ended and he was addressing a few well-chosen closing remarks in slightly bored fashion (he had showed off his ponderous playthings to divers kings, potentates and bigwigs at home and abroad, I learned) when I, though properly awed by the gun but more especially by the gunner, ventured to suggest that a gun that had been through three engagements and had been fired so frequently must necessarily show some signs of wear. The gunner glanced at me, and I shall never forget that look. With his eyes on mine, he touched a lever in negligent fashion, whereon silently the great breech slipped away with a hiss and whistle of air, and with his gaze always fixed he suggested I might glance down the bore.  Obediently I stooped, whereon he spake on this wise:  \"If you cast your heyes to the right abaft the breech you'll observe slight darkening of riflin's. Now glancin' t'left of piece you'll per-ceive slight darkening of riflin's. Now casting your heyes right forrard you'll re-mark slight roughening of riflin's towards muzzle of piece and--there y'are, sir. One hundred and twenty-seven times she's been fired by my 'and and good for as many more--both of us. Arternoon, gentlemen, and--thank ye!\"  Saying which he touched a lever in the same negligent fashion, the mighty breech block slid back into place, and I"]]]
