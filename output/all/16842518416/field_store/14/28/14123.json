Sheridan, General, United States Army â€” Volume 2 (#6)"],["body","to General Lee that his cavalry was so badly demoralized that it should be dismounted; and the citizens of the valley, intensely disgusted with the boasting and swaggering that had characterized the arrival of the \"Laurel Brigade\" in that section, baptized the action (known to us as Tom's Brook) the \"Woodstock Races,\" and never tired of poking fun at General Rosser about his precipitate and inglorious flight.  (When Rosser arrived from Richmond with his brigade he was proclaimed as the savior of the Valley, and his men came all bedecked with laurel branches.)  On the 10th my army, resuming its retrograde movement, crossed to the north side of Cedar Creek.  The work of repairing the Manassas Gap branch of the Orange and Alexandria railroad had been begun some days before, out from Washington, and, anticipating that it would be in readiness to transport troops by the time they could reach Piedmont, I directed the Sixth Corps to continue its march toward Front Royal, expecting to return to the Army of the Potomac by that line.  By the 12th, however, my views regarding the reconstruction of this railroad began to prevail, and the work on it was discontinued.  The Sixth Corps, therefore, abandoned that route, and moved toward Ashby's Gap with the purpose of marching direct to Washington, but on the 13th I recalled it to Cedar Creek, in consequence of the arrival of the enemy's infantry at Fisher's Hill, and the receipt, the night before, of the following despatch, which again opened the question of an advance on Gordonsville and Charlottesville:   (Cipher.) \"WASHINGTON, October 12, 1864, 12 M.  \"MAJOR-GENERAL SHERIDAN:  \"Lieutenant-General Grant wishes a position taken far enough south to serve as a base for further operations upon Gordonsville and Charlottesville.  It must be strongly fortified and provisioned. Some point in the vicinity of Manassas Gap would seem best suited for all purposes.  Colonel Alexander, of the Engineers, will be sent to consult with you as soon as you connect with General Augur.  \"H.  W.  HALLECK, Major-General.\"   As it was well known in Washington that the views expressed in the above despatch were counter to my convictions, I was the next day required by the following telegram from Secretary Stanton to repair to that city:   \"WASHINGTON, October 13, 1864.  \"MAJOR-GENERAL SHERIDAN (through General Augur)  \"If you can come here, a consultation on several points is extremely desirable.  I propose to visit General Grant, and would like to see you first.  \"EDWIN M.  STANTON, \"Secretary of War.\"   I got all ready to comply with the terms of Secretary Stanton's despatch, but in the meantime the enemy appeared in my front in force, with infantry and cavalry, and attacked Colonel Thoburn, who had been pushed out toward Strasburg from Crook's command, and also Custer's division of cavalry on the Back road.  As afterward appeared, this attack was made in the belief that all of my troops but Crook's had gone to Petersburg.  From this demonstration there ensued near Hupp's Hill a bitter skirmish between Kershaw and Thoburn, and the latter was finally compelled to withdraw to the north bank of Cedar Creek.  Custer gained better results, however, on the Back road, with his usual dash driving the enemy's cavalry away from his front, Merritt's division then joining him and remaining on the right.  The day's events pointing to a probability that the enemy intended to resume the offensive, to anticipate such a contingency I ordered the Sixth Corps to return from its march toward Ashby's Gap.  It reached me by noon of the 14th, and went into position to the right and rear of the Nineteenth Corps, which held a line along the north bank of Cedar Creek, west of the Valley pike.  Crook was posted on the left of the Nineteenth Corps and east of the Valley pike, with Thoburn's division advanced to a round hill, which commanded the junction of Cedar Creek and the Shenandoah River, while Torbert retained both Merritt and Custer on the right of the Sixth Corps, and at the same time covered with Powell the roads toward Front Royal.  My head-quarters were at the Belle Grove House, which was to the west of the pike and in rear of the Nineteenth Corps.  It was my intention to attack the enemy as soon as the Sixth Corps reached me, but General Early having learned from his demonstration that I had not detached as largely as his previous information had led him to believe, on the night of the 13th withdrew to Fisher's Hill; so, concluding that he could not do us serious hurt from there, I changed my mind as to attacking, deciding to defer such action till I could get to Washington, and come to some definite understanding about my future operations.  To carry out this idea, on the evening of the 15th I ordered all of the cavalry under General Torbert to accompany me to Front Royal, again intending to push it thence through Chester Gap to the Virginia Central railroad at Charlottesville, to destroy the bridge over the Rivanna River, while I passed through Manassas Gap to Rectortown, and thence by rail to Washington.  On my arrival with the cavalry near Front Royal on the 16th, I halted at the house of Mrs. Richards, on the north bank of the river, and there received the following despatch and inclosure from General Wright, who had been left in command at Cedar Creek:  \"HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY Division, \"October 16, 1864.  \"GENERAL:  \"I enclose you despatch which explains itself.  If the enemy should be strongly reenforced in cavalry, he might, by turning our right, give us a great deal of trouble.  I shall hold on here until the enemy's movements are developed, and shall only fear an attack on my right, which I shall make every preparation for guarding against and resisting.  \"Very respectfully, your obedient servant,  \"H.  G.  WRIGHT, Major-General Commanding. \"MAJOR-GENERAL P. H. SHERIDAN, \"Commanding Middle Military Division.\"   [INCLOSURE.] \"To LIEUTENANT-GENERAL EARLY:  \"Be ready to move as soon as my forces join you, and we will crush Sheridan.  \"LONGSTREET, Lieutenant-General.\"   The message from Longstreet had been taken down as it was being flagged from the Confederate signal-station on Three Top Mountain, and afterward translated by our signal officers, who knew the Confederate signal code.  I first thought it a ruse, and hardly worth attention, but on reflection deemed it best to be on the safe side, so I abandoned the cavalry raid toward Charlottesville, in order to give General Wright the entire strength of the army, for it did not seem wise to reduce his numbers while reinforcement for the enemy might be near, and especially when such pregnant messages were reaching Early from one of the ablest of the Confederate generals. Therefore I sent the following note to General Wright:  \"HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION, \"Front Royal, October 16, 1864.  \"GENERAL: The cavalry is all ordered back to you; make your position strong.  If Longstreet's despatch is true, he is under the impression that we have largely detached.  I will go over to Augur, and may get additional news.  Close in Colonel Powell, who will be at this point. If the enemy should make an advance, I know you will defeat him. Look well to your ground and be well prepared.  Get up everything that can be spared.  I will bring up all I can, and will be up on Tuesday, if not sooner.  \"P. H. SHERIDAN, Major-General.  \"MAJOR-GENERAL H.  G.  WRIGHT, \"Commanding Sixth Army Corps.\"   At 5 o'clock on the evening of the 16th I telegraphed General Halleck from Rectortown, giving him the information which had come to me from Wright, asking if anything corroborative of it had been received from General Grant, and also saying that I would like to see Halleck; the telegram ending with the question: \"Is it best for me to go to see you?\"  Next morning I sent back to Wright all the cavalry except one regiment, which escorted me through Manassas Gap to the terminus of the railroad from Washington.  I had with me Lieutenant-Colonel James W.  Forsyth, chief-of-staff, and three of my aides, Major George A. Forsyth, Captain Joseph O'Keefe, and Captain Michael V. Sheridan.  I rode my black horse, Rienzi, and the others their own respective mounts.  Before leaving Cedar Creek I had fixed the route of my return to be by rail from Washington to Martinsburg, and thence by horseback to Winchester and Cedar Creek, and had ordered three hundred cavalry to Martinsburg to escort me from that point to the front.  At Rectortown I met General Augur, who had brought a force out from Washington to reconstruct and protect the line of railroad, and through him received the following reply from General Halleck:  \"HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES, \"WASHINGTON, D.C., October 16 1864  \"To MAJOR-GENERAL SHERIDAN, \"Rectortown, Va.  General Grant says that Longstreet brought with him no troops from Richmond, but I have very little confidence in the information collected at his headquarters.  If you can leave your command with safety, come to Washington, as I wish to give you the views of the authorities here.  \"H. W. HALLECK, Major-General, Chief-of-Staff.\"   In consequence of the Longstreet despatch, I felt a concern about my absence which I could hardly repress, but after duly considering what Halleck said, and believing that Longstreet could not unite with Early before I got back, and that even if he did Wright would be able to cope with them both, I and my staff, with our horses, took the cars for Washington, where we arrived on the morning of the 17th at about 8 o'clock.  I proceeded at an early hour to the War Department, and as soon as I met Secretary Stanton, asked him for a special train to be ready at 12 o'clock to take me to Martinsburg, saying that in view of existing conditions I must get back to my army as quickly as possible.  He at once gave the order for the train, and then the Secretary, Halleck, and I proceeded to hold a consultation in regard to my operating "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2652"],["title","Personal Memoirs of P. H. Sheridan, General, United States Army â€” Volume 2 (#7)"],["body","of the Blue Ridge.  The upshot was that my views against such a plan were practically agreed to, and two engineer officers were designated to return with me for the purpose of reporting on a defensive line in the valley that could be held while the bulk of my troops were being detached to Petersburg.  Colonel Alexander and Colonel Thom both of the Engineer Corps, reported to accompany me, and at 12 o'clock we took the train.  We arrived about dark at Martinsburg, and there found the escort of three hundred men which I had ordered before leaving Cedar Creek.  We spent that night at Martinsburg, and early next morning mounted and started up the Valley pike for Winchester, leaving Captain Sheridan behind to conduct to the army the Commissioners whom the State of New York had sent down to receive the vote of her troops in the coming Presidential election.  Colonel Alexander was a man of enormous weight, and Colonel Thom correspondingly light, and as both were unaccustomed to riding we had to go slowly, losing so much time, in fact, that we did not reach Winchester till between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, though the distance is but twenty-eight miles.  As soon as we arrived at Colonel Edwards's headquarters in the town, where I intended stopping for the night, I sent a courier to the front to bring me a report of the condition of affairs, and then took Colonel Alexander out on the heights about Winchester, in order that he might overlook the country, and make up his mind as to the utility of fortifying there.  By the time we had completed our survey it was dark, and just as we reached Colonel Edwards's house on our return a courier came in from Cedar Creek bringing word that everything was all right, that the enemy was quiet at Fisher's Hill, and that a brigade of Grover's division was to make a reconnoissance in the morning, the 19th, so about 10 o'clock I went to bed greatly relieved, and expecting to rejoin my headquarters at my leisure next day.  Toward 6 o'clock the morning of the 19th, the officer on picket duty at Winchester came to my room, I being yet in bed, and reported artillery firing from the direction of Cedar Creek.  I asked him if the firing was continuous or only desultory, to which he replied that it was not a sustained fire, but rather irregular and fitful.  I remarked: \"It's all right; Grover has gone out this morning to make a reconnoissance, and he is merely feeling the enemy.\" I tried to go to sleep again, but grew so restless that I could not, and soon got up and dressed myself.  A little later the picket officer came back and reported that the firing, which could be distinctly heard from his line on the heights outside of Winchester, was still going on.  I asked him if it sounded like a battle, and as he again said that it did not, I still inferred that the cannonading was caused by Grover's division banging away at the enemy simply to find out what he was up to.  However, I went down-stairs and requested that breakfast be hurried up, and at the same time ordered the horses to be saddled and in readiness, for I concluded to go to the front before any further examinations were made in regard to the defensive line.  We mounted our horses between half-past 8 and 9, and as we were proceeding up the street which leads directly through Winchester, from the Logan residence, where Edwards was quartered, to the Valley pike, I noticed that there were many women at the windows and doors of the houses, who kept shaking their skirts at us and who were otherwise markedly insolent in their demeanor, but supposing this conduct to be instigated by their well-known and perhaps natural prejudices, I ascribed to it no unusual significance.  On reaching the edge of the town I halted a moment, and there heard quite distinctly the sound of artillery firing in an unceasing roar. Concluding from this that a battle was in progress, I now felt confident that the women along the street had received intelligence from the battle, field by the \"grape-vine telegraph,\" and were in raptures over some good news, while I as yet was utterly ignorant of the actual situation.  Moving on, I put my head down toward the pommel of my saddle and listened intently, trying to locate and interpret the sound, continuing in this position till we had crossed Mill Creek, about half a mile from Winchester.  The result of my efforts in the interval was the conviction that the travel of the sound was increasing too rapidly to be accounted for by my own rate of motion, and that therefore my army must be falling back.  At Mill Creek my escort fell in behind, and we were going ahead at a regular pace, when, just as we made the crest of the rise beyond the stream, there burst upon our view the appalling spectacle of a panic-stricken army-hundreds of slightly wounded men, throngs of others unhurt but utterly demoralized, and baggage-wagons by the score, all pressing to the rear in hopeless confusion, telling only too plainly that a disaster had occurred at the front.  On accosting some of the fugitives, they assured me that the army was broken up, in full retreat, and that all was lost; all this with a manner true to that peculiar indifference that takes possession of panic-stricken men.  I was greatly disturbed by the sight, but at once sent word to Colonel Edwards commanding the brigade in Winchester, to stretch his troops across the valley, near Mill Creek, and stop all fugitives, directing also that the transportation be, passed through and parked on the north side of the town.  As I continued at a walk a few hundred yards farther, thinking all the time of Longstreet's telegram to Early, \"Be ready when I join you, and we will crush Sheridan,\" I was fixing in my mind what I should do.  My first thought was too stop the army in the suburbs of Winchester as it came back, form a new line, and fight there; but as the situation was more maturely considered a better conception prevailed.  I was sure the troops had confidence in me, for heretofore we had been successful; and as at other times they had seen me present at the slightest sign of trouble or distress, I felt that I ought to try now to restore their broken ranks, or, failing in that, to share their fate because of what they had done hitherto.  About this time Colonel Wood, my chief commissary, arrived from the front and gave me fuller intelligence, reporting that everything was gone, my headquarters captured, and the troops dispersed.  When I heard this I took two of my aides-de-camp, Major. George A. Forsyth and Captain Joseph O'Keefe, and with twenty men from the escort started for the front, at the same time directing Colonel James W. Forsyth and Colonels Alexander and Thom to remain behind and do what they could to stop the runaways.  For a short distance I traveled on the road, but soon found it so blocked with wagons and wounded men that my progress was impeded, and I was forced to take to the adjoining fields to make haste.  When most of the wagons and wounded were past I returned to the road, which was thickly lined with unhurt  men, who, having got far enough to the rear to be out of danger, had halted, without any organization, and begun cooking coffee, but when they saw me they abandoned their coffee, threw up their hats, shouldered their muskets, and as I passed along turned to follow with enthusiasm and cheers.  To acknowledge this exhibition of feeling I took off my hat, and with Forsyth and O'Keefe rode some distance in advance of my escort, while every mounted officer who saw me galloped out on either side of the pike to tell the men at a distance that I had come back. In this way the news was spread to the stragglers off the road, when they, too, turned their faces to the front and marched toward the enemy, changing in a moment from the depths of depression, to the extreme of enthusiasm.  I already knew that even in the ordinary condition of mind enthusiasm is a potent element with soldiers, but what I saw that day convinced me that if it can be excited from a state of despondency its power is almost irresistible.  I said nothing except to remark as I rode among those on the road: \"If I had been, with you this morning this disaster would not have happened. We must face the other way; we will go back and recover our camp.\"  My first halt was made just north of Newtown, where I met a chaplain digging his heels into the sides of his jaded horse, and making for the rear with all possible speed.  I drew up for an instant, and inquired of him how matters were going at the front.  He replied, \"Everything is lost; but all will be right when you get there\"; yet notwithstanding this expression of confidence in me, the parson at once resumed his breathless pace to the rear.  At Newtown I was obliged to make a circuit to the left, to get round the village.  I could not pass through it, the streets were so crowded, but meeting on this detour Major McKinley, of Crook's staff, he spread the news of my return through the motley throng there.  When nearing the Valley pike, just south of Newtown I saw about three-fourths of a mile west of the pike a body of troops, which proved to be Ricketts's and Wheaton's divisions of the Sixth Corps, and then learned that the Nineteenth Corps had halted a little to the right and rear of these; but I did not stop, desiring to get to the extreme front.  Continuing on parallel with the pike, about midway between Newtown and Middletown I crossed to the west of it, and a little later came up in rear of Getty's division of the Sixth Corps. When I arrived, this division and the cavalry were the only troops in the presence of and resisting the enemy; they were apparently acting as a rear-guard at a point about three miles north of the line we held at Cedar Creek when the battle began.  General Torbert was the first officer to meet me, saying as he rode up, \"My God! I am glad you've come.\" Getty's division, when I found it, was about a mile north of"]]]
