But I didn't find any of these either as I plodded along, being sure to keep one magnetted boot always in contact with the ground.  Karpin and McCann had set their dome up at just about the only really level spot on that entire planetoid. The rest of it was nothing but jagged rock, and it wasn't easy traveling at all, maneuvering around with magnets on my boots and a bulky atmosphere suit cramping my movements.         *       *       *  And then I stopped and looked out at space and cursed myself for a ring-tailed baboon. McCann's body might be anywhere in the Solar System, anywhere at all, but there was one place I could be sure it wasn't, and that place was this asteroid. No, Karpin had not blown a grave or stuffed the body into a fissure in the ground. Why not? Because this chunk of rock was valuable, that's why not. Because Karpin was in the process of selling it to one of the major companies, and that company would come along and chop this chunk of rock to pieces, getting the valuable metal out, and McCann's body would turn up in the first week of operations if Karpin were stupid enough to bury it here.  Ten hours between McCann's death and Karpin's departure for Chemisant City. He'd admitted that already. And I was willing to bet he'd spent at least part of that time carrying McCann's body to some other asteroid, one he was sure was nothing but worthless rock. If that were true, it meant the mortal remains of Jafe McCann were now somewhere--_anywhere_--in the Asteroid Belt. Even if I assumed that the body had been hidden on an asteroid somewhere between here and Chemisant City--which wasn't necessarily so--that wouldn't help at all. The relative positions of planetoids in the Belt just keep on shifting. A small chunk of rock that was between here and Chemisant City a few weeks ago--it could be almost anywhere in the Belt right now.  The body, that was the main item. I'd more or less counted on finding it somehow. At the moment, I couldn't think of any other angle for attacking Karpin's story.  As I clopped morosely back to the dome, I nibbled at Karpin's story in my mind. For instance, why go to Chemisant City? It was closer, he said, but it couldn't have been closer by more than a couple of hours. The way I understood it, Karpin was well-known back on Atronics City--it was the normal base of operations for he and his partner--and he didn't know a soul at Chemisant City. Did it make sense for him to go somewhere he wasn't known after his partner's death, even if it _was_ an hour closer? No, it made a lot more sense for a man in that situation to go where he's known, go someplace where he has friends who'll sympathize with him and help him over the shock of losing a partner of fifteen years' standing, even if going there does mean traveling an hour longer.  And there was always the cash-return form. That was what I was here about in the first place. It just didn't make sense for McCann to have held up his celebration while he filled out a form that he wouldn't be able to mail until he got back to Atronics City. And yet the company's handwriting experts were convinced that it wasn't a forgery, and I could pretty well take their word for it.  Mulling these things over as I tramped back toward the dome, I suddenly heard a distant bell ringing way back in my head. The glimmering of an idea, not an idea yet but just the hint of one. I wasn't sure where it led, or even if it led anywhere at all, but I was going to find out.         *       *       *       *       *  Karpin opened the doors for me. By the time I'd stripped off the suit he was back to work. He was cleaning the single unit which was his combination stove and refrigerator and sink and garbage disposal.  I looked around the dome again, and I had to admit that a lot of ingenuity had gone into the manufacture and design of this dome and its contents. The dome itself, when deflated, folded down into an oblong box three feet by one foot by one foot. The lock itself, of course, folded separately, into another box somewhat smaller than that.  As for the gear inside the dome, it was functional and collapsible, and there wasn't a single item there that wasn't needed. There were the two chairs and the two cots and the table, all of them foldaway. There was that fantastic combination job Karpin was cleaning right now, and that had dimensions of four feet by three feet by three feet. The clutter of gear over to the left wasn't as much of a clutter as it looked. There was a Geiger counter, an automatic spectrograph, two atmosphere suits, a torsion densimeter, a core-cutting drill, a few small hammers and picks, two spare air tanks, boxes of food concentrate, a paint tube, a doorless jimmy-john and two small metal boxes about eight inches cube. These last were undoubtedly Karpin's and McCann's pouches, where they kept whatever letters, money, address books or other small bits of possessions they owned. Back of this mound of gear, against the wall, stood the air reconditioner, humming quietly to itself.  In this small enclosed space there was everything a man needed to keep himself alive. Everything except human company. And if you didn't need human company, then you had everything. Just on the other side of that dome, there was a million miles of death, in a million possible ways. On this side of the dome, life was cozy, if somewhat Spartan and very hot.  I knew for sure I was going to get a head cold. My body had adjusted to the sixty-eight degrees inside the suit, finally, and now was very annoyed to find the temperature shooting up to ninety again.  Since Karpin didn't seem inclined to talk, and I would rather spend my time thinking than talking anyway, I took a hint from him and did some cleaning. I'd noticed a smeared spot about nose-level on the faceplate of my fishbowl, and now was as good a time as any to get rid of it. It had a tendency to make my eyes cross.  My shirt was sodden and wrinkled by this time anyway, having first been used to wipe sweat from my face and later been rolled into a ball and left on the chair when I went outside, so I used it for a cleaning rag, buffing like mad the silvered surface of the faceplate. Faceplates are silvered, not so the man inside can look out and no one else can look in, but in order to keep some of the more violent rays of the sun from getting through to the face.  I buffed for a while, and then I put the fishbowl on my head and looked through it. The spot was gone, so I went over and reattached it to the rest of the suit, and then settled back in my chair again and lit a cigarette.  Karpin spoke up. \"Wish you wouldn't smoke. Makes it tough on the conditioner.\"  \"Oh,\" I said. \"Sorry.\" So I just sat, thinking morosely about non-forged cash-return forms, and coincidences, and likely spots to hide a body in the Asteroid Belt.         *       *       *  Where would one dispose of a body in the asteroids? I went back through my thinking on that topic, and I found holes big enough to drive Karpin's claim through. This idea of leaving the body on some worthless chunk of rock, for instance. If Karpin had killed his partner--and I was dead sure he had--he'd planned it carefully and he wouldn't be leaving anything to chance. Now, an asteroid isn't worthless to a prospector until that prospector has landed on it and tested it. _Karpin_ might know that such-and-such an asteroid was nothing but worthless stone, but the guy who stops there and finds McCann's body might _not_ know it.  No, Karpin wouldn't leave that to chance. He would get rid of that body, and he would do it in such a way that nobody would _ever_ find it.  How? Not by leaving it on a worthless asteroid, and not by just pushing it off into space. The distance between asteroids is large, but so's the travel. McCann's body, floating around in the blackness, might just be found by somebody.  And that, so far as I could see, eliminated the possibilities. McCann's body was in the Belt. I'd eliminated both the asteroids themselves and the space around the asteroids as hiding places. What was left?  The sun, of course.  I thought that over for a while, rather surprised at myself for having noticed the possibility. Now, let's say Karpin attaches a small rocket to McCann's body, stuffed into its atmosphere suit. He sets the rocket going, and off goes McCann. Not that he aims it toward the sun, that wouldn't work well at all. Instead of falling into the sun, the body would simply take up a long elliptical orbit _around_ the sun, and would come back to the asteroids every few hundred years. No, he would aim McCann _back_, in the direction opposite to the direction or rotation of the asteroids. He would, in essence, slow McCann's body down, make it practically stop in relation to the motion of the asteroids. And then it would simply _fall_ into the sun.  None of my ideas, it seemed, were happy ones. If McCann's body were even at this moment falling toward the sun, it was just as useful to me as if it were on some other asteroid.  But, wait a second. Karpin and McCann had worked with the minimum of equipment, I'd already noticed that. They didn't have extras of anything, and they certainly wouldn't have extra rockets. Except for one fast trip to Chemisant City--when he had neither the time nor the excuse to buy a jato rocket--Karpin had spent all of his time since McCann's death right here on this planetoid.  So that killed that idea.  While I was hunting around for some other idea, Karpin spoke up again, for the first time in maybe twenty minutes. \"You think I killed him, don't you?\" he said, not looking around from his cleaning job.  I considered my answer. There was no reason at all to be overly polite to this sour old buzzard, but at the same time I am naturally the soft-spoken type. \"We aren't sure,\" I said. \"We just think there are some odd items to be explained.\"  \"Such as what?\" he demanded.  \"Such as the timing of McCann's cash-return form.\"  \"I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27089"],["title","The Risk Profession (#5)"],["body","explained that,\" he said.  \"I know. You've explained everything.\"  \"He wrote it out himself,\" the old man insisted. He put down his cleaning cloth, and turned to face me. \"I suppose your company checked the handwriting already, and Jafe McCann is the one who wrote that form.\"  He was so blasted sure of himself. \"It would seem that way,\" I said.  \"What other odd items you worried about?\" he asked me, in a rusty attempt at sarcasm.  \"Well,\" I said, \"there's this business of going to Chemisant City. It would have made more sense for you to go to Atronics City, where you were known.\"  \"Chemisant was closer,\" he said. He shook a finger at me. \"That company of yours thinks it can cheat me out of my money,\" he said. \"Well, it can't. I know my rights. That money belongs to me.\"  \"I guess you're doing pretty well without McCann,\" I said.  His angry expression was replaced by one of bewilderment. \"What do you mean?\"  \"They told me back at Atronics City,\" I explained, \"that McCann was the money expert and you were the metals expert, and that's why McCann handled all your buying on credit and stuff like that. Looks as though you've got a pretty keen eye for money yourself.\"  \"I know what's mine,\" he mumbled, and turned away. He went back to scrubbing the stove coils again.  I stared at his back. Something had happened just then, and I wasn't sure what. He'd just been starting to warm up to a tirade against the dirty insurance company, and all of a sudden he'd folded up and shut up like a clam.  And then I saw it. Or at least I saw part of it. I saw how that cash-return form fit in, and how it made perfect sense.  Now, all I needed was proof of murder. Preferably a body. I had the rest of it. Then I could pack the old geezer back to Atronics City and get proof for the part I'd already figured out.  I'd like that. I'd like getting back to Atronics City, and having this all straightened out, and then taking the very next liner straight back to Earth. More immediately, I'd like getting out of this heat and back into the cool sixty-eight degrees of--  And then it hit me. The whole thing hit me, and I just sat there and stared. They did not carry extras, Karpin and McCann, they did not carry one item of equipment more than they needed.  I sat there and looked at the place where the dead body was hidden, and I said, \"Well, I'll be a son of a gun!\"  He turned and looked at me, and then he followed the direction of my gaze, and he saw what I was staring at, and he made a jump across the room at the revolver lying on the cot.         *       *       *  That's what saved me. He moved too fast, jerked his muscles too hard, and went sailing up and over the cot and ricocheted off the dome wall. And that gave me plenty of time to get up from the chair, moving more cautiously than he had, and get my hands on the revolver before he could get himself squared away again.  I straightened with the gun in my hand and looked into a face white with frustration and rage. \"Okay, Mister McCann,\" I said. \"It's all over.\"  He knew I had him, but he tried not to show it. \"What are you talking about? McCann's dead.\"  \"Sure he is,\" I said. \"Jafe McCann was the money-minded part of the team. He was the one who signed for all the loans and all the equipment bought on credit. With this big strike in, Jafe McCann was the one who'd have to pay all that money.\"  \"You're babbling,\" he snapped, but the words were hollow.  \"You weren't satisfied with half a loaf,\" I said. \"You should have been. Half a loaf is better than none. But you wanted every penny you could get your hands on, and you wanted to pay out just as little money as you possibly could. So when you killed Ab Karpin, you saw a way to kill your debts as well. You'd _become_ Ab Karpin, and it would be Jafe McCann who was dead, and the debts dead with him.\"  \"That's a lie,\" he said, his voice getting shrill. \"_I'm_ Ab Karpin, and I've got papers to prove it.\"  \"Sure. Papers you stole from a dead man. And you might have gotten away with it, too. But you just couldn't leave well enough alone, could you? Not satisfied with having the whole claim to yourself, you switched identities with your victim to avoid your debts. And not satisfied with _that_, you filled out a cash-return form and tried to collect your money as your own heir. _That's_ why you had to go to Chemisant City, where nobody would recognize Ab Karpin or Jafe McCann, rather than to Atronics City where you were well-known.\"  \"You don't want to make too many wild accusations,\" he shouted, his voice shaking. \"You don't want to go around accusing people of things you can't prove.\"  \"I can prove it,\" I told him. \"I can prove everything I've said. As to who you are, there's no problem. All I have to do is bring you back to Atronics City. There'll be plenty of people there to identify you. And as to proving you murdered Ab Karpin, I think his body will be proof enough, don't you?\"  McCann watched me as I backed slowly around the room to the mound of gear. The partners had had no extra equipment, no extra equipment at all. I looked down at the two atmosphere suits lying side by side on the metallic rock floor.  _Two_ atmosphere suits. The dead man was supposed to be in one of those, floating out in space somewhere. He was in the suit, right enough, I was sure of that, but he wasn't floating anywhere.  A space suit is a perfect place to hide a body, for as long as it has to be hid. The silvered faceplate keeps you from seeing inside, and the suit is, naturally, a sealed atmosphere. A body can rot away to ashes inside a space suit, and you'll never notice a thing on the outside.         *       *       *  I'd had the right idea after all. McCann had planned to get rid of Karpin's body by attaching a rocket to it, slowing it down, and letting it fall into the sun. But he hadn't had an opportunity yet to go buy a rocket. He couldn't go to Atronics City, where he could have bought the rocket on credit, and he couldn't go to Chemisant City until the claim sale went through and he had some money to spend. And in the meantime, Karpin's body was perfectly safe, sealed away inside his atmosphere suit.  And it would have been safe, too, if McCann hadn't been just a little bit too greedy. He could kill his partner and get away with it; policemen on the Belt are even farther apart than the asteroids. He could swindle his creditors and get away with it; they had no way of checking up and no reason to suspect a switch in identities. But when he tried to get his own money back from Tangiers Mutual Insurance; _that's_ when he made his mistake.  I studied the two atmosphere suits, at the same time managing to keep a wary eye on Jafe McCann, standing rigid and silent across the room. Which one of those suits contained the body of Ab Karpin?  The one with the new patch on the chest, of course. As I'd guessed, McCann had shot him, and that's why he had the problem of disposing of the body in the first place.  I prodded that suit with my toe. \"He's in there, isn't he?\"  \"You're crazy.\"  \"Think I should open it up and check? It's been almost a month, you know. I imagine he's pretty ripe by now.\"  I reached down to the neck-fastenings on the fishbowl, and McCann finally moved. His arms jerked up, and he cried, \"Don't! He's in there, he's in there! For God's sake, don't open it up!\"  I relaxed. Mission accomplished. \"Crawl into your suit, little man,\" I said. \"We've got ourselves a trip to make, the three of us.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Henderson, as usual, was jovial but stern. \"You did a fine job up there, Ged,\" he said, with false familiarity. \"Really brilliant work.\"  \"Thank you very much,\" I said. I was holding the last piece of news for a minute or two, relishing it.  \"But you brought McCann in over a week ago. I don't see why you had to stay up at Atronics City at all after that, much less ten days.\"  I sat back in the chair and negligently crossed my legs. \"I just thought I'd take a little vacation,\" I said carelessly, and lit a cigarette. I flicked ashes in the general direction of the ashtray on Henderson's desk. Some of them made it.  \"A vacation?\" he echoed, eyes widening. Henderson was a company man, a _real_ company man. A vacation for him was purgatory, it was separation from a loved one. \"I don't believe you have a vacation coming,\" he said frostily, \"for at least six months.\"  \"That's what you think, Henny,\" I said.  All he could do at that was blink.  I went on, enjoying myself hugely. \"I don't like this company,\" I said. \"And I don't like this job. And I don't like you. And from now on, I've decided, it's going to be vacation all the time.\"  \"Ged,\" he said, his voice faint, \"what's the matter with you? Don't you feel well?\"  \"I feel well,\" I told him. \"I feel fine. Now, I'll tell you why I spent an extra ten days at Atronics City. McCann made and registered the big strike, right?\"  Henderson nodded blankly, apparently not trusting himself to speak.  \"Wrong,\" I said cheerfully. \"McCann went to Chemisant City and filled out all the forms required for registering a claim. But every place he was supposed to sign his name he wrote _Ab Karpin_ instead. Jafe McCann _never did make a legal registration of his claim_.\"  Henderson just looked fish-eyed.  \"So,\" I went on, \"as soon as I turned McCann over to the law at Atronics City, I went and registered that claim myself. And then I waited around for ten days until the company finished the paperwork involved in buying that claim from me. And then I came straight back here, just to say goodbye to you. Wasn't that nice?\"  He didn't move.  \"Goodbye,\" I said.   THE END   [Illustration]     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ March 1961.
