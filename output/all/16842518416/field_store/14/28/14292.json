They had evidently halted for consultation. Meanwhile Watson was whispering some instructions to George. After he had finished he leaned against the door with his whole weight, and indicated to Macgreggor that he was to do the same thing. The latter obeyed in silence.  The horsemen without made a great deal of clatter. If they were pursuing the fugitives they did not seem to think secrecy of movement very necessary. \"Whose cabin is this?\" demanded one of them.  \"It did belong to old Sam Curtis, but he's moved away, down to Alabama,\" some one answered.  \"Some darky may live in it now, eh?\" said the first voice.  \"Perhaps it's empty, and these tarnation spies are in it,\" was the rejoinder in a lower tone.  The men moved their horses closer to the house, which they quickly surrounded. No chance now for any one to escape; it seemed as if the three men in the cabin must inevitably be caught like rats in a trap. Yet they waited courageously, breathlessly. It was a tense moment. Another minute would decide their fate. Would they remain free men, or would they fall into the hands of their pursuers, with all the consequences that such a capture implied?  Already one of the Vigilants, evidently the leader, had dismounted. Approaching the door of the cabin, he gave it a push as if he expected it would open at once. But there was no yielding; Watson and Macgreggor were still leaning firmly against the other side.  The leader began to knock on the door with a revolver. \"Here, here,\" he shouted; \"if there's any one in this cabin, come out--or we'll have you out!\"  At first there was no response, save a bark from Waggie. The leader rattled savagely at the door. \"Let's break in,\" he cried to his companions, \"and see if the place has any one in it!\"  The Vigilants were about to follow the example of their leader, and dismount when there came a wheedling voice--apparently the voice of a negress--from within the cabin.  \"What you gemmen want dis time o' night wid poor Aunty Dinah?\"  \"A nigger's living here,\" muttered the leader, in surprise.  \"What for you gwyne to disturb an ole niggah at dis hour?\" asked the voice from within.  \"It's all right, aunty,\" called out the leader. \"We only want some information. Come to the door.\"  \"In one minute I be with you,\" was the answer. \"I'se a nursin' my old man here--he done gone and took the smallpox--and----\"  The smallpox! Had the voice announced that a million Union troops were descending upon the party the consternation would not have been half as great. The smallpox! At the mention of that dreaded name, and at the thought that they were so close to contagion, the Vigilants, with one accord, put spurs into their horses and rushed madly away. The leader, dropping his revolver in his excitement, and not even stopping to pick it up, leaped upon his horse and joined in the inglorious retreat. On, on, dashed the men until they reached the town of Jasper, tired and provoked. Like many other men, North or South, they were brave enough when it came to gunpowder, but were quickly vanquished at the idea of pestilential disease.  \"Bah!\" cried the leader, as they all reined up in front of the village tavern, which now looked dark and uninviting; \"those three spies, if spies they are, can go to Guinea for all I care. I shall hunt them no more.\"  There was a general murmur of assent to this fervent remark. One of the Vigilants said, in an injured tone: \"I wish Jake Hare was at the bottom of the ocean!\"  In explanation of which charitable sentiment it may be explained that Farmer Hare, on the departure of Watson, Macgreggor and George Knight, had run all the way to Jasper. Here he told the Vigilants that the three men had returned in the boat (which he had previously declared they had taken) and landed on the bank of the river. They could be easily caught, he said. He carefully suppressed any account of the way in which he had been outwitted by Watson. The fact was that Hare made up his mind, logically enough, that the fugitives would keep along the Tennessee until morning came, and as he had seen the direction they had taken he determined to set the Vigilants on their track. His scheme, as we have seen, was nearly crowned with success.                     *       *       *       *       *  \"A miss is as good as a mile,\" laughed Watson, as he stood with his two companions in the pitch black interior of the cabin, listening to the last faint sounds of the retreating Vigilants.  \"There's nothing like smallpox, eh?\" said George.  \"Or nothing like a boy who can imitate a darky's voice,\" put in Macgreggor. \"Where did you learn the art, George?\"  \"We boys in Cincinnati had a minstrel company of our own,\" the boy explained, \"and I used to play negro parts.\"  \"I'll never call the minstrels stupid again,\" said Watson. \"They have been instrumental in saving our lives.\"  \"Rather say it was your own brains that did it,\" interposed George.  So they talked until daybreak, for they found it impossible to sleep. Meanwhile the weather had changed. When the sun came peeping over the horizon, between tearful clouds, as if afraid that it was almost too damp for him to be out, the trio were pushing cautiously along the bank of the Tennessee, in the direction of Chattanooga.  \"I don't know who brought the Vigilants out for us the second time, unless it was our dear friend Hare, and I don't know whether they will give us another chase this morning,\" said Watson, as they were laboriously ascending one of the mountain spurs which led down to the river shore, \"but we must go steadily on, and trust to luck. To delay would be fatal. This is Friday--and we must be in Marietta by this evening.\"  On they trudged, over rocks and paths that would have taxed the ability of a nimble-footed chamois, as they wondered how the rest of their friends were faring, and where might be the intrepid Andrews. Sometimes Waggie scampered joyously on; sometimes he reposed in his master's overcoat. The clouds had now cleared away; the sun was shining serenely over the swollen and boisterous waters of the crooked Tennessee. Nature was once more preparing to smile.  \"I'm getting frightfully hungry,\" cried George, about noon-time. \"I wouldn't mind a bit of breakfast.\"  \"There's where we may get some,\" said Macgreggor. He pointed to an old-fashioned colonial house of brick, with a white portico, which they could see in the centre of a large open tract about a quarter of a mile back of the river. The smoke was curling peacefully from one of the two great chimneys, as if offering a mute invitation to a stranger to enter the house and partake of what was being cooked within. In a field in front of the mansion cattle were grazing, and the jingle of their bells sounded sweetly in the distance. No one would dream, to look at such an attractive picture, that the grim Spectre of War stalked in the land.  \"Shall we go up to the house, and ask for something?\" suggested Macgreggor, who was blessed with a healthy appetite.  Watson looked a little doubtful. \"There's no use in our showing ourselves any more than is necessary,\" he said. \"Rather than risk our necks, we had better go on empty stomachs till we reach Chattanooga.\"  But such a look of disappointment crept over the faces of George and Macgreggor, and even seemed to be reflected in the shaggy countenance of Waggie, that Watson relented.  \"After all,\" he said, \"there's no reason why there should be any more danger here than in Chattanooga or Marietta. Let's make a break for the house, and ask for a meal.\"  Hardly had he spoken before they were all three hurrying towards the mansion. When at last they stood under the portico, George seized the quaint brass knocker of the front door, and gave it a brisk rap. After some delay a very fat negress opened the door, and eyed the strangers rather suspiciously. Their tramp over the country had not improved their appearance, and her supercilious, inquisitive look was not strange, under the circumstances.  \"What you folks want?\" she asked, putting her big arms akimbo in an uncompromising attitude. Watson was about to reply when an attractive voice, with the soft accent so characteristic of the Southerners, called: \"What is it, Ethiopia? Any one to see me?\"  The next instant a kindly-faced gentlewoman of about fifty stood in the doorway.  \"Is there anything I can do for you?\" she asked pleasantly.  Macgreggor proceeded to tell the customary story about their being on their way from Kentucky to join the Confederate army further south. His heart smote him as he did so, for she was so gentle and sympathetic in her manner that he loathed to practice any deception, however necessary; but there was no help for it. So he ended by asking for something to eat.  \"Come in,\" said the mistress of the mansion, for such she proved to be, \"and take any poor hospitality I can offer you. My husband, Mr. Page, and both my children are away, fighting under General Lee, and I am only too glad to do anything I can for others who are helping the great cause.\" She smiled sweetly at George, and patted his dog. The boy regarded her almost sheepishly; he, too, hated the idea of imposing on so cordial a hostess.  Mrs. Page led the party into a great colonial hallway, embellished with family portraits. \"By-the-way,\" she added, \"there is a Confederate officer in the house now--Major Lightfoot, of the --th Virginia Regiment. He reached here this morning from Richmond and goes to Chattanooga this afternoon on a special mission.\"  Watson bit his lip. \"We're coming to too close quarters with the enemy,\" he thought, and he felt like retreating from the mansion with his companions. But it was too late. Such a move would only excite suspicion, or, worse still, lead to pursuit. \"We must face the thing through,\" he muttered, \"and trust to our wits.\"  Mrs. Page ushered the strangers, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26892"],["title","Chasing an Iron Horse (#7)"],["body","the delighted Waggie, into a large, handsomely paneled dining-room on the left of the hallway. She made them gather around an unset table. \"Sit here for a few minutes,\" she said, \"and the servants will bring you the best that Page Manor can offer you. In the meantime, I'll send Major Lightfoot to see you. He may be able to help you in some way.\"  She closed the door and was gone. \"I wish this Major Lightfoot, whoever he is, was in Patagonia at the present moment,\" whispered Watson. \"It's easy enough to deceive the Southern country bumpkins, and make them think you are Confederates, but when you get among people with more intelligence, like officers----\"  \"What difference does it make?\" interrupted Macgreggor, looking longingly at a mahogany sideboard. \"Didn't you hear Mrs. Page say the Major was a Virginian? He doesn't know anything about Kentucky.\"  \"That's lucky,\" laughed Watson, \"for we don't either.\"  \"Hush!\" came the warning from George. The door opened, and several negro servants began to bring in a cold dinner. What a meal it was too, when the time came to partake of it, and how grateful the three hungry travelers felt to the mistress of the house. When it had been disposed of, and the servants had left the dining-room, George said, almost under his breath: \"Hadn't we better be off? We have a good number of miles yet, between here and Marietta.\"  Watson was about to rise from the table when the door opened to admit a tall, stalwart man of about thirty, whose cold, gray-blue eyes and resolute mouth denoted one who was not to be trifled with. He was dressed in the gray uniform of a Confederate officer, but he had, presumably, left his sword and pistols in another room. The visitors stood up as he entered.  \"Glad to see you, my men,\" he said, shaking hands with each one.  \"Is this Major Lightfoot?\" asked Watson, trying to look delighted, but not making a brilliant success of it.  \"Yes,\" returned the Major. \"I hear you boys are Kentuckians.\"  \"We are,\" said Macgreggor stoutly; \"we are ready to die for our country, and so we are journeying southward to enlist.\"  \"You're a pretty young chap to take up arms,\" observed the Major, eyeing George keenly.  \"One is never too young to do that,\" answered the boy. He was determined to put a bold face on the affair, and he saw no reason why the Confederate officer should suspect him if he spoke up unhesitatingly.  \"The South has need of all her loyal sons,\" remarked Watson, who felt no compunction in deceiving the Major, whatever might have been his sentiments as to hoodwinking Mrs. Page.  \"So you all come from Kentucky?\" went on the officer. \"That interests me, for I come from Kentucky myself!\"  The jaws of the three strangers dropped simultaneously. Had a bomb fallen at their feet they could not have been more disconcerted. What did they know about Kentucky, if they had to be put through a series of cross-questions by a native! But there was no reason, after all, why the Major should dwell on the subject.  \"I thought Mrs. Page said you belonged to a Virginia regiment,\" exclaimed Macgreggor, almost involuntarily.  \"So I do,\" replied the Major, \"but I only settled in Virginia two years ago. I was born and bred in Kentucky, and there's no state like it--now is there?\"  \"No!\" cried the trio, with a well-feigned attempt at enthusiasm. They felt that they were treading on dangerous ground, and resolved to play their parts as well as they could.  \"Do you all come from the same part of Kentucky?\" queried the Major, as he sat down on a chair, evidently prepared for a pleasant chat.  \"From Fleming County,\" said Watson carelessly, quite as if he knew every other county in the State. \"I fear, sir, we must be moving on towards Chattanooga. We are in a hurry to enlist, and we have already been delayed too long.\"  The Major completely ignored the latter part of this sentence. \"From Fleming County,\" he said. \"Well, that's pleasant news. I know Fleming County like a book. There is where my father lived and died. What part of the county do you come from?\"  Had the Major asked them to tell the area of the United States in square inches he could not have propounded a more puzzling question.  \"Dunder and blitzen;\" thought Watson. \"If I only knew more of Kentucky geography I might get myself out of this scrape.\"  \"We come from the southeastern part of the county,\" said Macgreggor, after an awkward pause.  \"Near what town?\"  Another pause. Oh, for the name of a town in the southeastern part of Fleming County, Kentucky. The Major was looking at the visitors curiously. Why this sudden reticence on their part?  At last Watson spoke up, although evasively. \"We were a long distance from any town; we worked on adjoining farms, and when the call to arms came we determined to rush to the rescue of our beloved Southland.\"  The Major gave Watson one searching look. \"Humph!\" said he, \"that's all very pretty, and I'm glad you are so patriotic--but that won't do. What is the nearest town to the places you live in?\"  The name of Carlisle flashed through Watson's mind. He recalled that it was somewhere in the part of Kentucky in which Fleming County was situated. A man he knew had once lived there. He would risk it.  \"The nearest town is Carlisle,\" he said shortly. \"And now, Major, we really must be off! Good-bye!\"  He started for the door, followed by George and Macgreggor, who were both devoutly wishing that such a state as Kentucky had never existed.  \"Wait a second,\" suddenly commanded the Southerner, stepping in front of the door to bar the way. \"You seem to be strangely ignorant of your own county. Carlisle happens to be in the adjoining county.\"  \"Here, sir, we're not here to be examined by you, as if we were in the witness box,\" cried Watson, who hoped to carry the situation through with a strong hand. He would try a little bluster.  A sarcastic smile crossed the firm face of Major Lightfoot. \"Don't try to bluff me,\" he said quietly but sternly; \"for it won't work. I see very clearly that you fellows have never been in Fleming County, nor do I think you have ever been in Kentucky at all, for the matter of that. You certainly talk more like Yankees than Kentuckians.\"  \"Then you don't believe us?\" asked Macgreggor, trying to assume an air of injured innocence.  \"Certainly not,\" answered the Major. He folded his arms, and regarded the visitors as if he were trying to read their inmost thoughts. \"You are lying to me! And as you've lied to me about coming from Kentucky, it's quite as likely you've lied to me about your being on your way to enlist in the Confederate army. For all I know you may be Union spies. In short, my friends, you are acting in the most suspicious way, and I put you under arrest!\"  George's heart sank within him. He was not afraid of being arrested, but to think that he might never take part in the bridge-burning expedition. Lightfoot turned the key in the door.  Watson walked up to the Major, and tapped him on the shoulder. \"Look here,\" he said, in the tone of a man who is quite sure of his position. \"You talk about putting us under arrest, but you're only playing a game of bluff yourself. We are three to your one--and I'd like to know what is to prevent our walking out of this house, and knocking you down, too--or, if you prefer, shooting you--if you attempt to stop us?\"  Lightfoot laughed, in a superior sort of way. \"Go, if you want,\" he said curtly; \"but I don't think you'll go very far.\" His eyes glistened, as if he thought the whole scene rather a good joke. \"Half a mile back of this mansion there's a squadron of Confederate cavalry picketed. If I give them the alarm they'll scour the whole countryside for you, and you'll all be in their hands within an hour.\"  Watson turned pale. It was the paleness of vexation rather than of fear. \"Why were we fools enough to come to this house,\" he thought. He knew how quickly they could be caught by cavalrymen.  The Major smiled in a tantalizing manner. \"I think you will take my advice and surrender,\" he said, sitting down carelessly in a chair and swinging one of his long legs over the other. \"If, on investigation, it proves that you are not spies, you will be allowed to go on your way. If there's any doubt about it, however, you will be sent to Richmond.\"  Macgreggor, with a bound, leaped in front of the Confederate, and, pulling out a revolver, pointed it at Lightfoot's head. \"Unless you promise not to have us followed, you shan't leave this room alive!\" he cried with the tone of a man daring everything for liberty. George fully expected to see the officer falter, for he had seen that the Major was unarmed.  But Lightfoot did nothing of the kind. On the contrary, he gave one of his provoking laughs. \"Don't go into heroics,\" he said, pushing Macgreggor away as though he were \"shoohing\" off a cat. \"You know I would promise anything, and the second your backs were turned I'd give the alarm. You don't think I would be fool enough to see you fellows walking away without making a trial to get you back?\"  Macgreggor hesitated, as he looked at George and Watson. Then he answered fiercely, handling his pistol ominously the meanwhile: \"We've but one chance--and we'll take it! We will never let you leave this room alive, promise or no promise. You are unarmed, and there are _three_ of us, armed.\"  The Major did not seem to be at all startled. He merely changed the position of his legs, as he answered: \"Killing me wouldn't do you any good, my boy! If you do shoot me before I can escape from the room the shooting would only alarm the house--the cavalry would be summoned by Mrs. Page, and you would find yourself worse off even than you are now.\"  Watson touched Macgreggor on the shoulder. \"The Major's right,\" he said; \"we would only be shooting down a man in cold blood, and gaining nothing by it. He has trapped us--and, so long as those plagued cavalrymen are so near, we had better submit. I think I've got as much courage as the next man,"]]]
