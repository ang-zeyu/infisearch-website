The remainder was in connection with sailing.  Dick, Dolores and the big-headed man occupied one cab, while the baggage followed in another. Dolores had obtained quite a wardrobe, much to the amusement of her employer. But the man spoke only once during the trip.  \"Everyone in the party must consider that they work for you, Dick. You must hear all complaints and settle all differences. They must not approach me for any reason. I am known as Morquil, of section one, which you will understand when we reach our destination.\"  The crew was hurrying back and forth on the deck of the small ship, taking care of last-minute details. A group of people were gathered beside a huge stack of baggage, and Dick walked toward them without waiting for the others.  Dolores went up the gangplank beside Morquil, helping him slightly. He seemed to have difficulty in supporting his enormous head with the slight body.  As Dick reached the group, he read the names from the list in his hand. \"Mr. and Mrs. John McCarthy. You are in stateroom number seven. Take what baggage you can carry, the rest will be put on board.\" He called each name and stateroom; they headed for the ship. John McCarthy he found was the man he had met in the office, and he _still_ had his perpetual grin. Evidently his fiancee had agreed to the pact for they were now man and wife.  When Dick started toward the ship, after watching the baggage put on board, he was stopped by a tap on the shoulder. The cab drivers were still waiting for their money. Morquil had left everything in his hands, even to paying for the motor trip to the dock.  It was a strange departure, with only a few people on the dock to say goodbye. Even they were just neighbors of the passengers. Most of the women on board were crying as the _Primrose_ nosed out through the harbor toward the open sea.         *       *       *       *       *  Dick was still at the rail when the captain approached. \"I'm sorry to bother you, Mr. Barrow, but I must know our destination so I can set the course.\"  The young leader's day dreaming was cut short, to jerk him back to his duties. He felt that the lives and hopes of everyone on the ship had been thrust into his hands.  Even the captain didn't know where they were going. The ship had been chartered for a voyage of several months, to an unknown destination. He and the crew were well paid, and didn't care where they went.  Dick drew a sealed envelope from his pocket, detached a slip of paper and handed it to the captain. He read the note, then repeated it. \"You are to keep the destination to yourself. No one on the ship is to know where we are going, and you will not mention it to me again. I hope that we have good weather, Captain, and a fast trip.\"  Barrow felt like a fool. Repeating messages as if they were his own--without the slightest knowledge of what they were about. _He_ was supposedly charting the course--and didn't have the slightest idea where they were going.  When Dick reached his stateroom (after answering questions from everyone on board--and telling them nothing) he found Dolores sobbing. She had kept her smile until the boat sailed. Now she was crying her eyes out. It was not a new sight, as every woman on the ship seemed occupied in the same way, with the men trying to comfort them.  As Dick sat down beside her, he could feel the throb of the diesel motor. It seemed to carry the rhythm of adventure through the walls of the cabin, giving the feeling of the unknown. For a long time there was silence while Dolores held one of Dick's hands for protection.  \"Dick! We only have _one_ cabin! I'm supposed to stay here with you--and I _hardly know you_! Morquil told me that I must stay here, there are no extra rooms.\"  \"I'm sorry, Dolores. We will just have to put up with things as they are. We've got into this and will have to see it through. After all, we _are_ man and wife, and the people on board would think it strange if we didn't occupy the same room. There are two bunks, so I won't have to sleep on the floor. It will be a long trip, and we might as well enjoy it as much as possible.\"  Days changed into weeks as the ship plowed steadily south. They stopped at one port for a few hours to refuel, but there was little to see. The ship was slow and it felt good to walk on land again. But no one spoke enough English to answer questions.  It was the only time they sighted land until just before the end of the trip, when small islands began to slide by. Some within a few hundred feet, others just visible in the distance. Morquil hadn't appeared on deck during the entire trip, but now he approached the rail.  His face lighted with an ethereal glow as he gazed across the blue water. He looked like a man who was sighting his home after many years of absence. Dick couldn't help but feel glad for him, while cold chills of misgiving crept up and down his own spine. Their voyage was ending at a far different place that he had pictured in his mind, and quite the opposite of the description which Morquil had given of gigantic mechanical development.  They were passing by small south-sea islands, where mechanical equipment was out of the question. They hardly appeared _habitable_!  When the captain approached Dick, Morquil joined the conversation. \"_I'll_ give you the directions, Captain. Mr. Barrow is not feeling well, and I can do it for him.  \"In about an hour we will reach the island, and I will point out the entrance to the harbor. It is well protected and there is no need to worry about any storm while we unload.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Every inch of space in the ship was packed with supplies. There were crates of books as well as pieces of machinery. Considerable radio equipment included assembled sets as well as parts. There were rifles and even one small cannon. Several crates of chickens and turkeys joined the other things on the beach. Then to the amazement of the party, a crate of pigs appeared.  It required three days to empty the ship, and with each passing hour the little party grew more apprehensive. It seemed as if they had been transferred to an island to start a _new_ civilization, instead of a place where mechanical development was far advanced. Because Dick was the leader of the party, the others began to look at him with hatred; Morquil was almost forgotten.  When the last piece of equipment was covered with heavy tarpaulins, they constructed a shelter against one side of the pile. It was almost dark when everything was finished, and the captain decided to wait until the next day to sail. Everyone was invited on board the _Primrose_, for a farewell party.  Dick was forced to call a meeting in the main cabin, to forestall danger of the party deserting with the ship. Morquil had instructed him carefully.  \"Friends, we are facing a great adventure. I'm in no different position than you, except that as leader I am responsible for whatever happens. I must take all blame for whatever comes, yet know that it will eventually work out as we expected.  \"You all know that it is forbidden to talk about this trip, or to surmise our destination. I can assure you that it is done for your benefit, and later you will appreciate the fact that you did _not_ know the future. I can't say what the next few days will bring to all of us, but be assured that everything you have been promised will be fulfilled.  \"At the moment it seems impossible that things can turn out as we expected, but they _will_! You must simply be patient, and do not lose faith in this great adventure.\"  As Dick finished his speech, Morquil smiled, well satisfied. Dolores even smiled faintly, although it required effort to overcome her feeling of disaster.  The following morning everyone went ashore, and John McCarthy went around trying to aid Barrow in cheering up the party. He lied like a trooper, whispering to everyone that he had discovered something that satisfied _him_ about the marvelous civilization they would reach before long.  Word of this reached Morquil, and he hurriedly called Dick and John out of sound of the others. He appeared almost frightened, and the moment they were alone, he spoke.  \"What have you learned? I wanted you to know nothing, and it is better if you are ignorant. Whatever you learned is too much, and may upset the future.\"  John started to laugh, then seeing the expression of agony on the face of Morquil, he stopped short. \"Don't worry. I haven't learned _anything_! I simply tried to help Dick keep the people satisfied. They were getting so restless they _needed_ something. In my home town I was known as a famous liar, and thought my ability might come in handy.\"  Slowly the agony disappeared from Morquil's face. \"Someday you will understand how much you have done for me, John. You will never regret it!\"  The McCarthys remained jovial, and tried to keep up the spirits of the others as the days of loneliness passed.         *       *       *       *       *  Philip Jones and his wife were quiet, and waited patiently. Andrew and Emma Smith had taken over the cooking, and served the meals. George and Mary Martin were the youngest couple, and Dick doubted whether either of them was past twenty-one. The others were all nearer thirty. They spent their time side by side, gazing over the sea, perfectly happy in each other's company.  Jerold Brown and Peter Yarbro were constantly fishing, from the collapsible boat, while their wives played cards.  One night they were awakened by brilliant flashes of light. Running to the beach, they watched in amazement.  They appeared like big guns firing just above the surface of the water, a few miles away. While they watched they gradually faded out. It was like a terrific electric storm, and the little party drew close together for comfort.  When the lights faded out entirely, Morquil told them to get some sleep. They would have to move equipment aboard "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26941"],["title","Wantedâ€”7 Fearless Engineers! (#3)"],["body","new ship the following day.  With the first streak of dawn Dick was back at the edge of the beach, straining his eyes into the gloom, but it was almost an hour before any object was visible.  After breakfast the ship was much plainer. They could see a rounded hull, like the top of a huge submarine, above the water. One of the women remarked that she would _stay_ on the island before she'd enter an undersea ship. The trip on the _Primrose_ was bad enough, but it wasn't _below_ the surface.  Morquil called them within the canvas shelter, as if to make a speech. He held a small ball in one hand, and while they waited for instructions it landed in their midst.  A cloud of yellow vapor burst from the object, and everyone in the party slowly sank to the ground. Morquil joined the others in unconscious stupor, a victim of his own gas.     CHAPTER III  _Strange Destination_   When Dick opened his eyes, there was a feeling of motion to the bed. The strangeness of the ceiling overhead drew his attention. It was not canvas, but shiny metal, almost purple in tint.  Suddenly he sat up. Dolores lay beside him. As his eyes cleared of the lingering mist, objects in the room became plainer. They were in a luxuriously equipped cabin.  Dolores slowly opened her eyes. A moment later she sat up beside him. Glancing through the porthole, beyond the bed, she turned away with a groan.  \"We _are_ under water! And deep! I can't see a thing but strange blue light.\"  When Dick joined her, his forehead puckered in a frown. \"No, Dolores. It doesn't look like water, it looks more like--No! _It can't be!_\"  For several minutes there was silence while he gazed through the opening. Dolores had lost interest in the outside and was examining the fittings of the cabin. It had everything that could be desired in a first class hotel room, and many little toilet articles besides.  Suddenly Dick turned away. \"_It's true!_ We're in the air--_or above it_! Dolores, this ship is an _aircraft_!\"  \"Never mind, Dick, this room is _beautiful_! Whether we're flying or swimming, this is the nicest room I ever had. It has _everything_, and _look_ at the dressing table!\"  Dick sat down in amazement, a smile slowly spreading over his face. Dolores was happy--wherever they were. The room was all that mattered. But he couldn't understand why Morquil had gassed them, and put them on board unconscious. _He_ would have enjoyed seeing the new ship.  When a knock sounded at the door, Dolores was unpacking her clothes for the first time since they left the _Primrose_. Turning the knob, Morquil stepped in.  \"I'm sorry, Dick, that I had to use gas, but I knew the people would be afraid of boarding this ship. John McCarthy is down in the power room already, examining the machines, but some of the others are upset about the transfer from the island. I hope you don't feel resentful?\"  \"No, Morquil. We're satisfied. If you don't believe it--look at Dolores. She decided to like this room the minute she saw it, and is unpacking already.\"  The worried expression disappeared from the strange man's face. \"I had the cabins equipped for women, as I know they are particular about such things.\"  \"Would you like to see the ship? It will be your home for a long time, and you might as well get acquainted. I'm sorry that no one but myself understands English, but you will have ample time to learn our language during the voyage. You must speak it fluently by the time we arrive.\"  As they started out, Dolores dropped the dress she was holding, to join them. Curiosity overcame the desire to straighten out her clothes.  Entering a wide passage, they turned to the right. It ended abruptly in a room with several comfortable chairs. Three tables occupied the center in uneven positions, the underparts filled with metal-covered books. Two men of Morquil's race looked up at their approach.  Dick returned their friendly smile. When Dolores smiled they appeared embarrassed; but truly greatly pleased. Barrow noticed that one of them was examining a book in English; the illustrations seemed to fascinate him.  A narrow passage, beyond the main cabin, led to the control room where three men sat in swivel chairs. The instrument board was a marvel to Dick, and he watched for several minutes. It would require months to understand even a small portion of the gauges.  The ship was built with two decks, and a large hold beneath the lower floor which contained the machinery. The strange men were quartered on the lower level, with the exception of Morquil. His cabin was next to the one occupied by the Barrows. The McCarthys were on the opposite side of the passage, in a room slightly smaller than the one allotted to Dick and his wife.  The quarters of the remainder of the party were smaller, but still quite comfortable; all located farther back on the same passage.         *       *       *       *       *  Morquil was proud of the ship, and displayed each section with pride. He opened every cupboard door, and showed them through all of the cabins. They were stopped for a while, when they met Mrs. Yarbro, trying to dispel her fear of the strange craft. The others appeared to be taking their new quarters for granted, and settling down for the trip.  The main cabin was toward the front of the ship, while the dining room was at the rear; the staterooms on the passage between. One stairway led to the lower level, from just back of the control room, another from the dining saloon. A ramp beneath the rear stairway led to the hold of the ship. When they started down, Dolores returned to her cabin. Her interest ended on the upper decks.  Dick spotted John, bending over one of the machines, so engrossed that he didn't hear their approach. One of the crew stood nearby, watching.  When McCarthy saw Barrow, he nearly burst with enthusiasm. \"This is the greatest thing I've ever seen! Why, it almost _talks_! Do you know, this little machine actually picks up the orders from the control room, and _adjusts every machine down here_! Darned if I don't think it's got a brain!\"  When Morquil led the way toward the front of the hold, John was still engrossed in the apparatus. \"He will be a valuable man to you, Dick, and can solve many problems that you would otherwise have to do yourself. He will make an able assistant.\"  Passing by the heavy machinery, they approached an enclosed section, which appeared to be of recent installation. Stepping through the doorway, Morquil threw a switch which lighted every corner, then watched expectantly as Dick examined the strange objects. It appeared to be a colony of metal beehives, with covered passages between.  \"It is our home, Dick. This room contains everything in miniature that you will see when we arrive. Each of the smaller domes house thirty thousand people, the large one three times that number. We are born, live our lives, and die beneath these metal ceilings. It will be your job to care for them.  \"Everything beneath these domes is exactly as it is in our cities, except that the machines are dummies. This model room was installed so you could study our civilization during the trip. When you arrive you will be ready to start work.  \"You, and you only will have a key. You may bring any member of your party here that you desire, but it is not necessary for them to understand the entire civilization. There are only six cities, including the large one, where you and John McCarthy will be located. The other men will each have one dome under their control.  \"It is easy to travel back and forth, and you may gather together at any time, although each of you will have duties in different sections. While you are overseeing the work in the smaller cities John can look after the capital. Upon your arrival in Yorpun you will take complete charge of all mechanical work. It will be your responsibility from then on.\"  As Dick slipped the key in his pocket, he felt the weight of a country settle slowly on his shoulders. Two hundred and ten thousand people--entirely dependent upon _his_ control of the machines.  Where could this settlement be? They had sailed darn near to the end of the world in the _Primrose_, and now they were going even farther. From the way the metal domes covered the cities, it might be at the south pole, and still be habitable.  By the time they returned to the main cabin, it was dinner time. It was past mid-day when he regained consciousness, and Dick was hungry.  Mrs. McCarthy was knitting a sweater for her husband, while three of the strange men watched in amazement. Her knitting needles seemed to hold them spellbound. The other members of Dick's party were sitting around trying to decide what to do. But the sound of the dinner gong, made them forget their worries.  Dick had to go down to the hold and call John, who was still watching the master machine. If he hadn't been dragged away, he would have spent the night examining the strange device.  The meal was simple, but they all enjoyed it. It seemed to dispel the gloom from the party, and they appreciated McCarthy's jokes. There were fifteen of Morquil's race in the crew, and all but the men at the controls joined them.  Knives and forks stood at the places set for the passengers, brought from the supplies on the _Primrose_, but the crew ate with long narrow spoons. Table silver was evidently unknown to this race of people.  After dinner Morquil called them to the main cabin, and for the first time told about the destination. All that had kept them from losing hope long before, was his promise of greater comfort and luxury than they could hope for in their native land.  \"I know that some of you resent the fact that you were unconscious while put aboard this ship. But I know you would hesitate to come of your own accord. One woman said that she wouldn't go on an _undersea_ ship, and she would be more afraid of this.  \"You will be amazed to know that we are now leaving the atmosphere of the earth that you have always known.
