D. Porter \"for the bravery and skill displayed in the attack on the post of Arkansas on the 10th January, 1863,\" and in consideration of those services, together with his efficient labors and vigilance subsequently displayed in thwarting the efforts of the rebels to obstruct the Mississippi and its tributaries and the important part rendered by the squadron under his command, which led to the surrender of Vicksburg.  I do therefore, in conformity to the seventh section of the act approved 16th July, 1862, nominate Commander D. D.

MAJOR-GENERAL GRANT:  Understanding that your lodgment at Chattanooga and Knoxville is now secure, I wish to tender you, and all under your command, my more than thanks, my profoundest gratitude, for the skill, courage, and perseverance with which you and they, over so great difficulties, have effected that important object. God bless you all!   A. LINCOLN.     TO GOVERNOR CURTIN.  EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 9, 1863  HIS EXCELLENCY A. G. CURTIN,  Governor of Pennsylvania.  DEAR SIR:--I have to urge my illness, and the preparation of the message, in excuse for not having sooner transmitted you the inclosed from the Secretary of War and Provost Marshal General in response to yours in relation to recruiting in Pennsylvania. Though not quite as you desire, I hope the grounds taken will be reasonably satisfactory to you. Allow me to exchange congratulations with you on the organization of the House of Representatives, and especially on recent military events in Georgia and Tennessee.  Yours very truly,   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL BUTLER.  EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., December 10, 1863.  MAJOR-GENERAL BUTLER, Fort Monroe, Va.:  Please suspend execution in any and all sentences of death in your department until further order.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL MEADE.  EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 11, 1863.  MAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Army of the Potomac:  Lieut. Col. James B. Knox, Tenth Regiment Pennsylvania Reserves, offers his resignation under circumstances inducing me to wish to accept it. But I prefer to know your pleasure upon the subject. Please answer.   A. LINCOLN.     TO JUDGE HOFFMAN.  EXECUTIVE MANSION, December 15, 1863.  HON. OGDEN HOFFMAN, U. S. District Judge, San Francisco, Cal.:  The oath in the proclamation of December 8 is intended for those who may voluntarily take it, and not for those who may be constrained to take it in order to escape actual imprisonment or punishment. It is intended that the latter class shall abide the granting or withholding of the pardoning power in the ordinary way.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO MARY GONYEAG.  EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 15, 1863.  MOTHER MARY GONYEAG, Superior, Academy of Visitation, Keokuk, Iowa:  The President has no authority as to whether you may raffle for the benevolent object you mention. If there is no objection in the Iowa laws, there is none here.   A. LINCOLN.     PROCLAMATION CONCERNING DISCRIMINATING DUTIES, DECEMBER 16, 1863.  BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  A Proclamation.  Whereas by an act of the Congress of the United States of the 24th of May, 1828, entitled \"An act in addition to an act entitled 'An act concerning discriminating duties of tonnage and impost' and to equalize the duties on Prussian vessels and their cargoes,\" it is provided that upon satisfactory evidence being given to the President of the United States by the government of any foreign nation that no discriminating duties of tonnage or impost are imposed or levied in the ports of the said nation upon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States or upon the produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported in the same from the United States or from any foreign country, the President is thereby authorized to issue his proclamation declaring that the foreign discriminating duties of tonnage and impost within the United States are and shall be suspended and discontinued so far as respects the vessels of the said foreign nation and the produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported into the United States in the same from the said foreign nation or from any other foreign country, the said suspension to take effect from the time of such notification being given to the President of the United States and to continue so long as the reciprocal exemption of vessels belonging to citizens of the United States and their cargoes, as aforesaid, shall be continued, and no longer; and  Whereas satisfactory evidence has lately been received by me through an official communication of Senor Don Luis Molina, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Nicaragua, under date of the 28th of November, 1863, that no other or higher duties of tonnage and impost have been imposed or levied since the second day of August, 1838, in the ports of Nicaragua, upon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States, and upon the produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported in the same from the United States, and from any foreign country whatever, than are levied on Nicaraguan ships and their cargoes in the same ports under like circumstances:  Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of America, do hereby declare and proclaim that so much of the several acts imposing discriminating duties of tonnage and impost within the United States are, and shall be, suspended and discontinued so far as respects the vessels of Nicaragua, and the produce, manufactures, and the merchandise imported into the United States in the same from the dominions of Nicaragua, and from any other foreign country whatever; the said suspension to take effect from the day above mentioned, and to continue thenceforward so long as the reciprocal exemption of the vessels of the United States, and the produce, manufactures, and merchandise imported into the dominions of Nicaragua in the same, as aforesaid, shall be continued on the part of the government of Nicaragua.  Given under my hand at the city of Washington, the sixteenth day of December, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and the eighty-eighth of the Independence of the United States.   A. LINCOLN.  By the President:  WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.     MESSAGE TO CONGRESS,  DECEMBER 17, 1863.  TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES:  Herewith I lay before you a letter addressed to myself by a committee of gentlemen representing the freedmen's aid societies in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Cincinnati. The subject of the letter, as indicated above, is one of great magnitude and importance, and one which these gentlemen, of known ability and high character, seem to have considered with great attention and care. Not having the time to form a mature judgment of my own as to whether the plan they suggest is the best, I submit the whole subject to Congress, deeming that their attention thereto is almost imperatively demanded.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL HURLBUT.  [Cipher.]  EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., December 17, 1863.  MAJOR-GENERAL HURLBUT, Memphis, Tenn.:  I understand you have under sentence of death, a tall old man, by the name of Henry F. Luckett. I personally knew him, and did not think him a bad man. Please do not let him be executed unless upon further order from me, and in the meantime send me a transcript of the record.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL U.S. GRANT.  WAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, December 19, 1863.  GENERAL GRANT, Chattanooga, Tennessee:  The Indiana delegation in Congress, or at least a large part of them, are very anxious that General Milroy shall enter active service again, and I share in this feeling. He is not a difficult man to satisfy, sincerity and courage being his strong traits. Believing in our cause, and wanting to fight for it, is the whole matter with him. Could you, without embarrassment, assign him a place, if directed to report to you?   A. LINCOLN.     TO SECRETARY STANTON.  (Private.)  EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., December 21, 1863.  HON. SECRETARY OF WAR.  MY DEAR SIR:--Sending a note to the Secretary of the Navy, as I promised, he called over and said that the strikes in the ship-yards had thrown the completion of vessels back so much that he thought General Gilimore's proposition entirely proper. He only wishes (and in which I concur) that General Gillmore will courteously confer with, and explain to, Admiral Dahlgren.  In regard to the Western matter, I believe the program will have to stand substantially as I first put it. Henderson, and especially Brown, believe that the social influence of St. Louis would inevitably tell injuriously upon General Pope in the particular difficulty existing there, and I think there is some force in that view.  As to retaining General Schofield temporarily, if this should be done, I believe I should scarcely be able to get his nomination through the Senate. Send me over his nomination, which, however, I am not quite ready to send to the Senate.  Yours as ever,   A. LINCOLN.     TO O. D. FILLEY.  EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 22, 1863.  O. D. FILLEY, ST. Louis, Missouri:  I have just looked over a petition signed by some three dozen citizens of St. Louis, and three accompanying letters, one by yourself, one by a Mr. Nathan Ranney, and one by a Mr. John D. Coalter, the whole relating to the Rev. Dr. McPheeters. The petition prays, in the name of justice and mercy, that I will restore Dr. McPheeters to all his ecclesiastical rights. This gives no intimation as to what ecclesiastical rights are withheld.  Your letter states that Provost-Marshal Dick, about a year ago,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2659"],["title","The Papers and Writings of Abraham Lincoln â€” Volume 7: 1863-1865 (#8)"],["body","the arrest of Dr. McPheeters, pastor of the Vine Street Church, prohibited him from officiating, and placed the management of the affairs of the church out of the control of its chosen trustees; and near the close you state that a certain course \"would insure his release.\" Mr. Ranney's letter says: \"Dr. Samuel S. McPheeters is enjoying all the rights of a civilian, but cannot preach the Gospel!!!!\" Mr. Coalter, in his letter, asks: \"Is it not a strange illustration of the condition of things, that the question of who shall be allowed to preach in a church in St. Louis shall be decided by the President of the United States?\"  Now, all this sounds very strangely; and, withal, a little as if you gentlemen making the application do not understand the case alike; one affirming that the doctor is enjoying all the rights of a civilian, and another pointing out to me what will secure his release! On the second day of January last, I wrote to General Curtis in relation to Mr. Dick's order upon Dr. McPheeters; and, as I suppose the doctor is enjoying all the rights of a civilian, I only quote that part of my letter which relates to the church. It is as follows: \"But I must add that the United States Government must not, as by this order, undertake to run the churches. When an individual, in a church or out of it, becomes dangerous to the public interest, he must be checked; but the churches, as such, must take care of themselves. It will not do for the United States to appoint trustees, supervisors, or other agents for the churches.\"  This letter going to General Curtis, then in command there, I supposed, of course, it was obeyed, especially as I heard no further complaint from Dr. McPheeters or his friends for nearly an entire year. I have never interfered, nor thought of interfering, as to who shall or shall not preach in any church; nor have I knowingly or believingly tolerated any one else to so interfere by my authority. If any one is so interfering by color of my authority, I would like to have it specifically made known to me. If, after all, what is now sought is to have me put Dr. McPheeters back over the heads of a majority of his own congregation, that, too, will be declined. I will not have control of any church on any side.  Yours respectfully,   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO MILITARY COMMANDER AT POINT LOOKOUT.  EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 22, 1863.  MILITARY COMMANDER, Point Lookout, Md.:  If you have a prisoner by the name Linder--Daniel Linder, I think, and certainly the son of U. F. Linder, of Illinois, please send him to me by an officer.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO MILITARY COMMANDER AT POINT LOOKOUT.  EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., December 24, 1863.  MILITARY COMMANDER, Point Lookout, Md.:  If you send Linder to me as directed a day or two ago, also send Edwin C. Claybrook, of Ninth Virginia rebel cavalry.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO U. F. LINDER.  EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON D. C., December 26, 1863.  HON. U. F. LINDER, Chicago, Ill.: Your son Dan has just left me with my order to the Secretary of War, to administer to him the oath of allegiance, discharge him and send him to you.   A. LINCOLN.     TO GENERAL N. P. BANKS.  EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 29, 1863.  MAJOR-GENERAL BANKS:  Yours of the sixteenth is received, and I send you, as covering the ground of it, a copy of my answer to yours of the sixth, it being possible the original may not reach you. I intend you to be master in every controversy made with you.  Yours truly,   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL BUTLER.  EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., December 30, 1863.  MAJOR-GENERAL BUTLER, Fort Monroe, Va.:  Jacob Bowers is fully pardoned for past offence, upon condition that he returns to duty and re-enlists for three years or during the war.   A. LINCOLN.     TO SECRETARY STANTON.  EXECUTIVE MANSION WASHINGTON, December 31, 1863.  HON. SECRETARY OF WAR.  SIR:--Please fix up the department to which Curtis is to go, without waiting to wind up the Missouri matter. Lane is very anxious to have Fort Smith in it, and I am willing, unless there be decided military reasons to the contrary, in which case of course, I am not for it. It will oblige me to have the Curtis department fixed at once.  Yours truly,   A. LINCOLN.     1864    TELEGRAM TO GENERAL SULLIVAN.  WAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.C., January 1, 1864. 3.30 p.m.  GENERAL SULLIVAN, Harper's Ferry:  Have you anything new from Winchester, Martinsburg or thereabouts?   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR PIERPOINT.  EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., January 2, 1864.  GOVERNOR PIERPOINT, Alexandria, Va.:  Please call and see me to-day if not too inconvenient.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL BUTLER.  EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 2, 1864  MAJOR-GENERAL BUTLER.  SIR:--The Secretary of War and myself have concluded to discharge of the prisoners at Point Lookout the following classes: First, those who will take the oath prescribed in the proclamation of December 8, and issued by the consent of General Marston, will enlist in our service. Second, those who will take the oath and be discharged and whose homes lie safely within our military lines.  I send by Mr. Hay this letter and a blank-book and some other blanks, the way of using which I propose for him to explain verbally better than I can in writing.  Yours, very truly,   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL MEADE.  EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 5, 1864.  MAJOR-GENERAL MEADE:  If not inconsistent with the service, please allow General William Harrow as long a leave of absence as the rules permit with the understanding that I may lengthen it if I see fit. He is an acquaintance and friend of mine, and his family matters very urgently require his presence.   A. LINCOLN.     MESSAGE TO CONGRESS,  JANUARY 5, 1864.  GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:  By a joint resolution of your honorable bodies approved December 23, 1863, the paying of bounties to veteran volunteers, as now practiced by the War Department, is, to the extent of three hundred dollars in each case, prohibited after this 5th day of the present month. I transmit for your consideration a communication from the Secretary of War, accompanied by one from the Provost-Marshal General to him, both relating to the subject above mentioned. I earnestly recommend that the law be so modified as to allow bounties to be paid as they now are, at least until the ensuing 1st day of February.  I am not without anxiety lest I appear to be importunate in thus recalling your attention to a subject upon which you have so recently acted, and nothing but a deep conviction that the public interest demands it could induce me to incur the hazard of being misunderstood on this point. The Executive approval was given by me to the resolution mentioned, and it is now by a closer attention and a fuller knowledge of facts that I feel constrained to recommend a reconsideration of the subject.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR BRAMLETTE.  EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 6, 1864. 2 P.M.  GOVERNOR BRAMLETTE, Frankfort, Kentucky:  Yours of yesterday received. Nothing is known here about General Foster's order, of which you complain, beyond the fair presumption that it comes from General Grant, and that it has an object which, if you understood, you would be loath to frustrate. True, these troops are, in strict law, only to be removed by my order; but General Grant's judgment would be the highest incentive to me to make such order. Nor can I understand how doing so is bad faith and dishonor, nor yet how it so exposes Kentucky to ruin. Military men here do not perceive how it exposes Kentucky, and I am sure Grant would not permit it if it so appeared to him.   A. LINCOLN.     TO GENERAL Q. A. GILLMORE.  EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 13, 1864.  MAJOR-GENERAL GILLMORE:  I understand an effort is being made by some worthy gentlemen to reconstruct a legal State government in Florida. Florida is in your Department, and it is not unlikely you may be there in person. I have given Mr. Hay a commission of major, and sent him to you, with some blank-books and other blanks, to aid in the reconstruction. He will explain as to the manner of using the blanks, and also my general views on the subject. It is desirable for all to co-operate, but if irreconcilable differences of opinion shall arise, you are master. I wish the thing done in the most speedy way, so that when done it be within the range of the late proclamation on the subject. The detail labor will, of course, have to be done by others; but I will be greatly obliged if you will give it such general supervision as you can find consistent with your more strictly military duties.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR BROUGH. EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 15, 1864.  GOVERNOR BROUGH, Columbus, Ohio:  If Private William G. Toles, of Fifty-ninth Ohio Volunteers, returns to his regiment and faithfully serves out his term, he is fully pardoned for all military offenses prior to this.   A. LINCOLN.     TO CROSBY AND NICHOLS.  EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 16, 1864.  MESSRS. CROSBY AND NICHOLS.  GENTLEMEN: The number for this month and year of the North American Review was duly received, and for which please accept my thanks. Of course I am not the most impartial judge; yet, with due allowance for this, I venture to hope that the article entitled \"The President's Policy\" will be of value to the country. I fear I am not worthy of all which is therein kindly said of me personally.  The sentence of twelve lines, commencing at the top of page 252, I could wish to be not exactly what it is. In what is there expressed, the writer has not correctly understood me. I have never had a theory that secession could absolve States or people from their obligations. Precisely the contrary is asserted in the inaugural address; and it was because of my belief in the"]]]
