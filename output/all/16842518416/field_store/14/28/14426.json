Other dwellings we saw, even larger and more imposing than the one we entered yesterday. We were tempted to explore them, but Lev-el-Hedyd wisely dissuaded us, saying the day was waxing hotter each hour and it could be done on our return.  In the northern part of the town are many religious temples, with their tall towers like slender pyramids, tapering to a point. They are curious things, and surprisingly well preserved. The interiors of these temples are uninteresting. Nōfūhl says the religious rites of the Mehrikans were devoid of character. There were many religious beliefs, all complicated and insignificant variations one from another, each sect having its own temples and refusing to believe as the others. This is amusing to a Persian, but mayhap was a serious matter with them. One day in each week they assembled, the priests reading long moral lectures written by themselves, with music by hired singers. They then separated, taking no thought of temple or priest for another seven days. Nōfūhl says they were not a religious people. That the temples were filled mostly with women.  [Illustration: In One of the Temples]   In the afternoon we found it necessary to traverse a vast pleasure-ground, now a wild forest, but with traces still visible of broad promenades and winding driveways. (Olbaldeh thinks this must be the Centralpahk sometimes alluded to in Mehrikan literature.) There remains an avenue of bronze statues, most of them yet upright and in good condition, but very comic. Lev-el-Hedyd and I still think them caricatures, but Nōfūhl is positive they were serious efforts, and says the Mehrikans were easily pleased in matters of art.  We lost our way in this park, having nothing to guide us as in the streets of the city. This was most happy, as otherwise we should have missed a surprising discovery.  It occurred in this wise.  Being somewhat overcome by the heat we halted upon a little hill to rest ourselves. While reclining beneath the trees I noticed unusual carvings upon a huge block against which Lev-el-Hedyd was supporting his back. They were unlike any we had seen, and yet they were not unfamiliar. As I lay there gazing idly at them it flashed upon me they were Egyptian. We at once fell to examining the block, and found to our amazement an obelisk of Egyptian granite, covered with Egyptian hieroglyphics of an antiquity exceeding by thousands of years the most ancient monuments of the country!  Verily, we were puzzled!  \"When did the Egyptians invade Mehrika?\" quoth Bhoz-jā-khāz, with a solemn look, as if trying to recall a date.  \"No Egyptian ever heard of Mehrika,\" said Nōfūhl. \"This obelisk was finished twenty centuries before the first Mehrikan was weaned. In all probability it was brought here as a curiosity, just as we take to Persia the bronze head of George-wash-yn-tun.\"  We spent much time over the monument, and I think Nōfūhl was disappointed that he could not bring it away with him.   Also while in this park we came to a high tower, standing by itself, and climbed to the top, where we enjoyed a wide-spreading view.  The extent of the city is astounding.  Miles away in the river lay the _Zlōtuhb_, a white speck on the water. All about us in every direction as far as sight can reach were ruins, and ruins, and ruins. Never was a more melancholy sight. The blue sky, the bright sunshine, the sweet-scented air with the gay flowers and singing birds only made it sadder. They seemed a mockery.  [Illustration: \"Miles away in the river lay the _Zlotuhb_, a white speck on the water.\"]  We have encamped for the night, and I can write no more. Countless flying insects gather about us with a hateful buzz, and bite us beyond endurance. They are a pest thrice accursed.  I tell Nōfūhl his fine theory concerning the extinction of the Yahnkis is a good tale for those who have never been here.  No man without a leather skin could survive a second night.     _18th May_    Poor Jā-khāz is worse than sick.  He had an encounter last night with a strange animal, and his defeat was ignoble. The animal, a pretty thing, much like a kitten, was hovering near when Jā-khāz, with rare courage and agility, threw himself upon it.  And then what happened none of us can state with precision. We know we held our noses and fled. And Jā-khāz! No words can fit him. He carries with him an odor to devastate a province. We had to leave him ashore and send him fresh raiment.  This is, verily, a land of surprises.  Our hands and faces still smart from the biting insects, and the perfume of the odorous kitten promises to be ever with us.   Nōfūhl is happy. We have discovered hundreds of metal blocks, the poorest of which he asserts would be the gem of a museum. They were found by Fattan-laïz-eh in the basement of a high building, all laid carefully away upon iron shelves. The flood of light they throw upon the manners and customs of this ludicrous people renders them of priceless value to historians.  I harbor a suspicion that it causes Nōfūhl some pleasure to sit upon the cool deck of the _Zlōtuhb_ and watch Bhoz-jā-khāz walking to and fro upon the ruins of a distant wharf.     _19th May_    The air is cooler. Grip-til-lah thinks a storm is brewing.  Even Nōfūhl is puzzled over the wooden image we brought aboard yesterday. It is well preserved, with the barbaric coloring still fresh upon it. They found it standing upright in a little shop.  [Illustration: The Wooden God.]  How these idols were worshipped, and why they are found in little shops and never in the great temples is a mystery. It has a diadem of feathers on the head, and as we sat smoking upon the deck this evening I remarked to Nōfūhl that it might be the portrait of some Mehrikan noble. Whereupon he said they had no nobles.  \"But the Mehrikans of gentle blood,\" I asked, \"had they no titles?\"  \"Neither titles nor gentle blood,\" he answered.  \"And as they were all of much the same origin, and came to this country simply to thrive more fatly than at home, there was nothing except difference in wealth on which to establish a superior order. Being deep respecters of money this was a satisfying distinction. It soon resulted that those families who possessed riches for a generation or two became the substitute for an aristocracy. This upper class was given to sports and pastimes, spending their wealth freely, being prodigiously fond of display. Their intellectual development was feeble, and they wielded but little influence save in social matters. They followed closely the fashions of foreign aristocracies. Great attentions were paid to wandering nobles from other lands. Even distant relatives of titled people were greeted with the warmest enthusiasm.\"  Then I said to him, \"But explain to me, O Nōfūhl, how it was possible for so shallow a nation to become so great.\"  \"They were great only in numbers and too weak to endure success. At the beginning of the twentieth century--as they counted time--huge fortunes were amassed in a day, and the Mehrikans became drunk with money.\"  Whereupon I exclaimed, \"O Land of Delight! For much money is cheering.\"  But the old man shook his head. \"Very true, O Prince; but the effect was woful. These vast fortunes soon dominated all things, even the seat of government and the courts of Justice. Tricks of finance brought fabulous gains. Young men became demoralized. For sober industry with its moderate profits was ridiculed.\"  \"Verily, that would be natural!\" I said. \"But in a land where all were rich who was found to cook and scrub, to fetch and carry and to till the soil? For none will shovel earth when his pockets are stuffed with gold.\"  \"All were not rich. And when the poor also became greedy they became hostile. Then began social upheavals with bloodshed and havoc.\"  [Illustration: A Street Scene in Ancient Nhu-Yok (The costumes and manner of riding are taken from metal plates now in the museum at Teheran)]     _20th May_    An icy wind from the northeast with a violent rain. Yesterday we gasped with the hot air. To-day we are shivering in winter clothing.     _21st May_    The same as yesterday. Most of us are ill. My teeth chatter and my body is both hot and cold. A storm more wicked never wailed about a ship. Lev-el-Hedyd calls it the shrieking voices of the hundred millions of Mehrikans who must have perished in similar weather.     _16th June_    It is many days since I have touched this journal. A hateful sickness has been upon me, destroying all energy and courage. A sort of fever, and yet my limbs were cold. I could not describe it if I would.  Nōfūhl came into the cabin this evening with some of his metal plates and discoursed upon them. He has no respect for the intellects of the early Mehrikans. I thought for a moment I had caught him in a contradiction, but he was right as usual. It was thus:  _Nōfūhl._ They were great readers.  _Khan-li._ You have told us they had no literature. Were they great readers of nothing?  _Nōfūhl._ Verily, thou hast said it! Vast sheets of paper were published daily in which all crimes were recorded in detail. The more revolting the deed, the more minute the description. Horrors were their chief delight. Scandals were drunk in with thirstful eyes. These chronicles of crime and filth were issued by hundreds of thousands. There was hardly a family in the land but had one.  _Khan-li._ And did this take the place of literature?  _Nōfūhl._ Even so.     _20th June_    Once more we are on the sea; two days from Nhū-Yok. Our decision was a sudden one. Nōfūhl, in an evil moment, found among those accursed plates a map of the country, and thereupon was seized with an unreasoning desire to visit a town called \"Washington.\" I wavered and at last consented, foolishly I believe, for the crew are loud for Persia. And this town is inland on a river. He says it was their finest city, the seat of Government, the capital of the country. Grip-til-lah swears he can"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27307"],["title","The Last American (#4)"],["body","it if the map is truthful.  Jā-khāz still eats by himself.   This afternoon we reclined upon the deck, the _Zlōtuhb_ drifting gently in a southerly direction. Land could be seen on the starboard bow, a faint strip along the western horizon.  It was about the middle of the afternoon, while passing the ruins of a gigantic tower--perhaps a lighthouse--that Nōfūhl, of a sudden, clambered hastily to his feet and looked about him. Then he called to Grip-til-lah, asking how many leagues we were from the harbor of Nhū-Yok. Grip-til-lah's reply I forget, but it filled the old man with a gentle excitement. I observed an unwonted sparkle in his eyes, also a quivering of the fingers as he pointed to the ocean around about, and exclaimed--  \"Beneath us, the bottom of the sea is covered with iron ships--the wrecks of stupendous navies--the mightiest of all human history!\"  At once we all became interested.  \"What navies?\" I inquired. \"And what compassed their destruction? Was it a battle?\"  _Nōfūhl._ A battle of whose magnitude no Persian has conception; a conflict in which the sea was tossed and the heavens rent by thunderings of iron monsters. Any one of them would have blown to atoms a fleet of _Zlōtuhbs_.  _Ad-el-pate._ Verily! A tale easier told than believed. But I would readily venture my head in the _Zlōtuhb_ against any of these nursery-tale wonders.  _Nōfūhl._ And with wisdom. For the loss of thy brain, Ad-el-pate, could not affect the nature of thy speech.  Whereupon there was laughter, and Ad-el-pate held his peace.  _Khan-li._ But tell us of this battle, O Nōfūhl. I remember now to have read about it at college. These details of ancient history I am prone to forget. How came it about?  _Nōfūhl._ I have spoken of the Mehrikans being a greedy race. And their greed, at last, resulted in this war. By means of one-sided laws of their own making they secured for themselves a lion's share of all profits from the world's commerce. This checked the prosperity of other nations, until at last the leading powers of Europe combined in self-defence against this all-absorbing greed. They collected an armada the like of which was never imagined, neither before nor since. Then, across the ocean, came the iron host. And here, upon this very spot where we are floating, they met the Mehrikan ships.  _Khan-li._ How many ships in all?  _Nōfūhl._ The Mehrikans had eighty heavy ships of iron, with a number of smaller craft. The allies had two hundred and forty heavy battleships, all of iron. They also had smaller craft for divers purposes.  _Khan-li._ Allah! A bad prospect for our greedy friends! And being a nation of traders they had no liking, probably, for the perils of war.  _Nōfūhl._ As to that historians differ. According to the Mehrikans themselves they were mighty warriors. But certain writers of that period give a different impression. Nōz-yt-ahl is sure they were cowards, weak in body as in spirit, but often favored by fortune. In my opinion, this battle throws considerable light upon that matter.  A day like this, it was, also in June, as the Europeans, coming northward along the coast to seize Nhū-Yok, met the Mehrikan Admiral Nev-r-sai-di with his eighty ships. And the struggle was short.  _Khan-li._ Verily, I can believe it! With three ships to one I would give the Europeans about half a day--a summer afternoon like this--to send the greedy ones to the bottom.  _Nōfūhl._ Thy guess is good, O Prince, as to the hours of fighting. It lasted just one summer afternoon. But the Mehrikans it was who sent their enemies to the bottom. And the sea beneath our feet is strewn with iron hulks.  _Khan-li._ Bismillah! If that be a true tale--and I doubt it not--these greedy ones were not so contemptible, at least when there was profit in it.  _Lev-el-Hedyd._ At what period did this occur?  _Nōfūhl._ Early in the twentieth century. I cannot recall the date, but it was never forgotten by the Mehrikans. Surely a just pride, for on that day they accomplished wonders. The Admiral Nev-r-sai-di on his ship the _Ztazenztrypes_ was at one time surrounded by a dozen German men-of-war. And lo! he demolished all! And of Frank and Russyan vessels he put an end to as many more; also sundry Talyans and British.  _Lev-el-Hedyd._ Bismillah! But that was good! What, O Nōfūhl, is the Persian of that name _Ztazenztrypes_?  _Nōfūhl._ None can tell with certainty. To the Mehrikans it signified victory, or something similar.  Other miracles were achieved by the Mehrikans that day. _Nōfli-zon-mee_, a little craft with a pointed prow, jammed holes in nearly a score of monster ships, and the waters closed over them. There figured also a long and narrow boat of Mehrikan devising, the _Yankyd-Oodl_. This astonishing machine sailed to and fro among the foreign ships upsetting all traditions. Much glory befell her commander, the Captain Hoorai-boiz.  _Grip-til-lah._ And how many ships did the Mehrikans lose?  _Nōfūhl._ Reports are contradictory. According to one of their own writers of the period they suffered no loss whatever in vessels. Yet at the same time he asserts, \"We gave them Haleklumbya,\" which must be the name of a ship.  _Khan-li._ A gallant fight! But can you explain how such an inferior people could become heroic of a sudden?  _Nōfūhl._ According to 'Ardfax, an early British historian, they were addicted to surprising feats upon the water. And this statement is borne out by a Spanish admiral, Offulbad-shoota, who maintains that the Mehrikans, being a godless people, were aided by the devil.     _2d July_    We are on the river that leads to \"Washington.\" Grip-til-lah says we shall sight it to-morrow. The river is a dirty color.     _3d July_    We see ahead of us the ruins of a great dome, also a very high shaft. Probably they belong to the city we seek.  [Illustration: \"We see ahead of us the ruins of a great dome, also a very high shaft.\"]     _4th July_    A date we shall not forget!  Little did I realize this morning when we left the _Zlōtuhb_ in such hilarious mood what dire events awaited us. I landed about noon, accompanied by Nōfūhl, Lev-el-Hedyd, Bhoz-jā-khāz, Ad-el-pate, Kuzundam the first mate, Tik'l-palyt the cook, Fattan-laïz-eh, and two sailors. Our march had scarce begun when a startling discovery caused great commotion in our minds. We had halted at Nōfūhl's request, to decipher the inscription upon a stone, when Lev-el-Hedyd, who had started on, stopped short with a sudden exclamation. We hastened to him, and there, in the soft earth, was the imprint of human feet!  I cannot describe our surprise. We decided to follow the footprints, and soon found they were leading us toward the great dome more directly than we could have gone ourselves. Our excitement was beyond words. Those of us who had weapons carried them in readiness. The path was little used, but clearly marked. It wound about among fallen fragments and crumbling statues, and took us along a wide avenue between buildings of vast size and solidity, far superior to any we had seen in Nhū-Yok. It seemed a city of monuments.  [Illustration: Through the Streets of \"Washington.\"]  As we ascended the hill to the great temple and saw it through the trees rising high above us, we were much impressed by its vast size and beauty. Our eyes wandered in admiration over the massive columns, each hewn from a single block, still white and fresh as if newly quarried. The path took us under one of the lower arches of the building, and we emerged upon the other side. This front we found even more beautiful than the one facing the city. At the centre was a flight of steps of magnificent proportions, now falling asunder and overgrown in many places with grass and flowers.  [Illustration: The Ruins of the Great Temple]  These steps we ascended. As I climbed silently up, the others following, I saw two human feet, the soles toward us, resting upon the balustrade above. With a gesture I directed Nōfūhl's attention to them, and the old man's eyes twinkled with delight. Was it a Mehrikan? I confess to a lively excitement at the prospect of meeting one. How many were they? and how would they treat us?  Looking down upon my little band to see that all were there, I boldly marched up the remaining steps and stood before him.  He was reclining upon a curious little four-legged seat, with his feet upon the balustrade, about on a level with his head. Clad in skins and rough cloth he looked much like a hunter, and he gazed quietly upon me, as though a Persian noble were a daily guest. Such a reception was not gratifying, especially as he remained in the same position, not even withdrawing his feet. He nodded his curious head down once and up again, deeming it apparently a sufficient salutation.  [Illustration: \"He remained in the same position, not even withdrawing his feet.\"]  The maintenance of my own dignity before my followers forbade my standing thus before a seated barbarian, and I made a gesture for him to rise. This he answered in an unseemly manner by ejecting from his mouth a brownish fluid, projecting it over and beyond the balustrade in front of him. Then looking upon me as if about to laugh, and yet with a grave face, he uttered something in an unmusical voice which I failed to understand.  [Illustration: The Feet upon the Portico.]  Upon this Nōfūhl, who had caught the meaning of one or two words, stepped hastily forward and addressed him in his own language. But the barbarian understood with difficulty and they had much trouble in conversing, chiefly from reason of Nōfūhl's pronunciation. He afterward told me that this man's language differed but little from that of the Mehrikans, as they wrote it eleven centuries ago.  When he finally arose in talking with Nōfūhl I could better observe him. He was tall and bony, with an awkward neck, and appeared at first glance to be a man of forty years. We decided later he was under thirty. His yellow skin and want of hair made him seem much older than "]]]
