[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26912"],["title","Report of the Juvenile Delinquency Committee (#6)"],["body"," As we have said, we are not     anxious that the ordinary law-abiding bookseller or distributor     should have to undergo the stigma of a criminal prosecution, and     this was the main reason for entering into arrangements with the     Associated Booksellers and Gordon and Gotch. At present, however,     criminal proceedings afford the only real way of testing the     position even where there is an honest difference of opinion. We     think a better procedure could be devised, and the Select Committee     may be invited to deal with this matter.      \"(2) A number of comics which are not strictly indecent within the     meaning of the Act are nevertheless objectionable from other points     of view. In many the ethical standards of the characters are low.     The quality of the print and illustrations varies from the     indifferent to the very poor, and must have a serious effect on     children's eyesight. In a number of comics the grammar and     vocabulary are likewise bad.      \"It is said that children learn from what they see and hear around     them. If this is so it would appear that the assiduous reading of     comics tends to counteract the work of teachers which costs the     country so much.      \"An Inter-departmental Committee in 1952 recommended the     introduction of a system of registration. The Committee's original     recommendations were: that publishers or importers of comics should     apply for registration of every title and that only suitable titles     should be registered. The sale of unregistered comics was to be an     offence. This procedure may be preferable to the subsequently     suggested system of automatic registration followed by     de-registration upon complaint.      \"Registration of comics, of course, amounts to censorship. There     is, however, no question of literary merit or the spread of     knowledge, and the view that an adult should in general be free to     read what he likes does not apply in the case of publications     primarily intended for children. If it is accepted as proper to     censor films there can be little objection to censoring comics.      \"We therefore suggest that the Select Committee might consider     whether an authority might be set up to approve and register     comics. There could be an Appeal Board similar to that in respect     of films to consider complaints against any decision of the     registering authority.      \"If this suggestion is unacceptable an alternative might be an     amendment to the legislation to be introduced enabling the Court in     the case of comics to take into account as one of the factors in     considering whether they are objectionable matters of grammar,     language and visual standards.\"  The present Committee is of opinion that there is a good deal of force in the suggestions put forward in this part of the report of the Department of Justice, and our view is that these suggestions should be referred to the Minister of Education with a request that he consider them favourably and forward his conclusions to the Government.      \"(3) We have come across cases in which publications have been     advertised to such persons and in such a way as to endeavour to     sell them or attract the public on the basis of their emphasis or     alleged emphasis on sex, horror or violence.      \"If a publication--for instance, a medical book--is displayed in a     shop window open at a page of illustrations this would probably be     an offence against the present law even though the book may itself     be unobjectionable. There is however, another type of case which     would not be caught by the law as it stands, but which we think     equally deserves to be prohibited. An example of what we have in     mind is an advertisement which is put out by a mail-order firm and     is obviously designed to 'sell the book on its sex.' This open     appeal to salacious instincts is most objectionable and we can see     no justification for allowing it. Whether or not the publication     itself is indecent, we think the type of advertisement we refer to     should be prohibited by law.      \"_Amendments of Principal Act_: Prior to 1954 the Indecent     Publications Act 1910 had stood without alteration for over forty     years, and although its main principles are still sound revision is     badly needed. Indeed, last year's amendment in certain respects     increased rather than decreased the difficulties. In our opinion,     the best solution is to reconsider the legislation as a whole and     to deal with the topic of objectionable publications in a new and     self-contained Act. This would, of course, take some time. We have     notes of many points to raise with the draftsman, but we cite     others of more general significance.      \"(1) We consider that parts of the present section 6 are obsolete     and should be repealed. Section 6 enumerates certain classes of     works which are _prima facie_ indecent. Among these are 'any     document or matter which relates or refers, or may reasonably be     supposed to relate or refer, to any disease affecting the     generative organs of either sex, or to any complaint or infirmity     arising from or relating to sexual intercourse, or to the     prevention or removal of irregularities in menstruation'.      \"In so far as this part of the section would prevent the     advertising of useless or harmful products, it is unnecessary in     view of the Medical Advertisements Act 1942. In so far as it     represents a general attitude it seems out of date now that the     matters referred to are discussed with far less reticence than when     the Act was passed. The reference to drugs or methods for procuring     abortion or miscarriage in the later part of the section might be     retained, but it belongs more properly in the Crimes Act or the     Police Offences Act.      \"(2) At present section 157 of the Crimes Act overlaps the     provisions of the Indecent Publications Act 1910, and the tests it     lays down are expressed in very different language. This section is     little used, but it seems undesirable that there should be two     different tests for what is really the same offence. We recommend     the repeal of section 157 in so far as its subject matter overlaps     the Indecent Publications Act 1910.      \"(3) If the legislation is rewritten, we suggest that consideration     be given to the incorporation in the Act of the 'dominant effect'     test laid down in an American case, the Ulysses case.      \"The consolidation and rewriting of the existing legislation would     be of real benefit. The nature of the topic, however, demands that     any general consolidation should receive careful and even cautious     consideration. We do not think that in this matter urgent or speedy     action is called for.\"  The Committee has examined all of these suggestions and recommends that they should receive the very favourable consideration of the Government.   Summary of Principal Conclusions and Recommendations  I. That the changes in the law which were regarded by the Mazengarb Committee as calling for immediate action were duly and promptly brought into being by the Government by and through its 1954 amendments to the Indecent Publications Act 1910, the Child Welfare Act 1925, and the Police Offences Act 1927.  II. That the changes made last year in the Indecent Publications Act 1910 have been to some extent effective and helpful. We recommend, however, that consideration be given by Government to the redrafting of the Indecent Publications Act 1910 and to the inclusion in any new draft of the amendments suggested by the Department of Justice.  III. That it is clear that the suggestions made by the Mazengarb Committee for administrative action by certain named Government Departments along the lines indicated by that Committee have been sympathetically studied by the several Departments and that satisfactory measures have been taken by such Departments to carry out the recommendations of that Committee.  IV. That in the opinion of the present Committee the Child Welfare Division should not be reconstituted as a separate and independent Department of State, but that it should remain, as at present, a Branch or Division of the Department of Education.  V. That Government should take effective steps to set up a broadly based committee composed of men and/or women of expert knowledge and possessed of specialized training and wide experience to act as a fact-finding body so that as far as possible a reliable diagnosis may be obtained of the extent, causes, and incidence of the problem of delinquency in this Dominion. We think that this must be done before any thorough-going solutions can be propounded for consideration by Government.  VI. That the suggestions made by the Department of Justice with respect to \"comics\" in general and \"crime comics\" in particular and also with regard to \"suggestive\" magazines and periodicals appeal very strongly to the members of the present Committee, and we accordingly recommend that the Government should take action along the lines proposed by the Justice Department.  VII. That every effort be made through the Parent-Teacher and Home and School Associations to reach the greatest possible number of parents and prospective parents in order that they might be given the type of assistance referred to in greater detail in the body of this report.  VIII. That, for the better attainment of the object set out in the preceding paragraph, it is recommended that the Director of Education be asked to confer with appropriate experts with a view to the provision of suitable courses of lectures for parents and prospective parents.  That with the same end in view steps should be taken to increase the numbers of our visiting teachers, school psychologists, and public health nurses.  IX. That the Director of the National Broadcasting Service be supported in the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26912"],["title","Report of the Juvenile Delinquency Committee (#7)"],["body","he proposes to follow to put into effect the suggestions made by him in this report. We also stress our view that during the hours set apart for listening by children there should be a complete absence of features that can fairly be regarded as being unsuitable for or injurious to young children.  X. That on the question of contraceptives the Committee has but one recommendation to make--namely, that the Government should seriously consider whether it could be made a criminal offence for any one but a chemist acting in the ordinary course of his business to sell such articles to any member of the general public.
