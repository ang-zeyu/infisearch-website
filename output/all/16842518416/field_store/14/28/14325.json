The boulder gave and thundered down the slope. It brushed past the female but did not strike her.  \"Higher up and try again, Invar!\" cried the Chief Hunter.  They bounded up the slope. Anak paused and hurled a flint throwing-stone with deadly aim. It struck the female a glancing blow on the face, tearing the flesh from one of the prominent brow ridges. She stopped, momentarily blinded. Invar raised a rock high above his head with both hands and cast it at her. It struck her on the chest and she fell backwards. Again Anak's strategy was successful and an avalanche of rolled rocks overwhelmed her. The boy turned to fly, but the fleet-footed Invar overtook him and the knives of the two hunters quickly put an end to his career.  As they bent over his dead body, a shrill scream rose on the air. It was not the voice of an apeman, or an apewoman, but held a human quality. The hunters straightened up and sought the source of it. Again came the scream. From the mouth of a cave above them bounded a girl. She won momentarily to freedom, but a huge Neanderthal male followed her from the cave. His hairy arm seized and dragged her back.  \"Una!\" cried Invar and Anak in one voice.         *       *       *       *       *  Forgotten were strategy and tactics. Anak bounded up the slope, Invar at his heels. Into the mouth of the cave they charged. The huge male dropped the girl and faced them with a growl. Anak hurled a throwing-stone, but his aim was poor. It rebounded harmlessly from the great arched chest of the Neanderthaler. With a roar, the apeman charged.  The hunter sidestepped the rush and swung his smiting-stone. The blow was deflected by the upraised arm of the apeman and fell on his shoulder. Invar hurled a throwing-stone which found the monster's face and made him pause. The apeman recovered himself and rushed at the youth. The boy met him, smiting-stone in hand, but one swing of the heavier flint broke through his guard and stretched him senseless on the floor, blood flowing from a gash in his head.  Anak hurled another throwing-stone which caught the apeman on the back of the head, dazing him. With a shout, Anak closed. The effects of the blow had been only momentary and the Neanderthaler met his rush with both his stones swinging. One of them tore a long gash down Anak's back while the other laid open his thigh. The apeman dropped his stones and wound his long hairy arms about the hunter's body. Anak threw himself back and the two rolled on the floor, the apeman striving to crush the life out of his slighter opponent, while Anak smote futilely with his smiting-stone at the hairy body. Slowly, the hunter's ribs gave under the pressure. Spots of fire danced before his eyes. He strove valiantly, but his muscles were as a child's, compared to the enormous development of his opponent. With a gasp, his body went limp.         *       *       *       *       *  Una had watched the struggle with horror-stricken eyes. As the apeman's grip tightened about Anak's body, she gave a low moan. Her gaze fell on the discarded smiting-stones of the Neanderthaler. She sprang forward and lifted one in both hands. The apeman threw back his head to give a roar of victory. The note never issued from his throat. The huge flint which he had chipped patiently to a sharp edge, struck him on the back of the head. With a gasp and a convulsive shudder, the apeman rolled over, his skull crushed in.  Invar slowly recovered consciousness, and now sat up. He looked dully at the dead body of the Neanderthaler. Beside it, Anak lay in a pool of blood. He staggered to his feet, asking dully:  \"Is Anak with Degar Astok?\"  \"Not yet,\" replied Una. \"Help me to stop the flow of his blood.\"  \"He said there were five of the cousins of Gumor,\" said the boy as he looked around apprehensively. \"We have slain but four.\"  Una pointed toward the ravine.  \"The other lies there,\" she said. \"This one slew his mate an hour gone. I think he designed me to take her place.\"  Fever took Anak, and for three days he hovered between life and death. Then he slept and woke conscious, although his strength was badly sapped by the fever. There was no lack of food, for game was plentiful and Invar had found and mended the throwing-spears which Esle had tampered with. Slowly Anak recovered his strength. A month after the fight he stretched his muscles and announced himself as well.  \"I return to-day to the tribe of Ugar,\" he announced.  \"Can you return?\" asked Invar doubtfully. \"Remember the word of death.\"  \"That, let Uglik answer,\" replied Anak. \"In peace or in war, I will return. Soon the winter will come and here are warm caves and game in plenty. Here shall the tribe make a home.\"  \"Where you go, there go I,\" exclaimed Invar.  \"And I likewise,\" said Una.  \"Una will stay here until we return,\" replied Anak in a tone which brooked no argument.         *       *       *       *       *  The girl pouted, but a sharp word from Anak settled the matter. Throwing-spear and smiting-stone in hand, the two hunters approached the camping place of Uglik's tribe. They were within a hundred yards before they were seen. Esle set up a shrill cry.  \"Here come those on whom the Father passed the death word. Slay, oh, hunters!\"  Anak raised his hand and made the sign of peace.  \"Wait before you attack two such as we,\" he said. \"We are bearers of good tidings. By our hands, the cousins of Gumor have died. Think you, do you care to attack two such as we?\"  The hunters looked at one another doubtfully.  \"He lies!\" shrilled Esle.  \"We do not lie!\" retorted Anak. \"Their bones, picked clear by Kena, lie in their ravine. We come in peace to lead you to their home. There are warm caves and game in plenty. We will rejoin the tribe if the Father will remove the death word. Otherwise, attack us if you dare, and the tribe of Ugar will join the cousins of Gumor.\"  Uglik's face plainly showed hesitation.  \"The death word his been passed,\" he said doubtfully. \"It can be withdrawn only by a sacrifice to Degar Astok.\"  \"We two have offered five of the cousins of Gumor, and a boy. Is that not enough?\"  \"It must be a human sacrifice!\" cried Esle.  \"Then, hag of evil omen, traitor to Uglik, attempted slayer of Invar and me, I offer you!\" cried Anak furiously, his spear raised.  \"Sacrilege!\" she shrilled, darting behind Uglik. \"Slay the defamer of the God!\"  \"What mean these charges, Anak?\" asked Uglik darkly.  \"Esle tampered with our spears, which you ordered her to strengthen for the battle with the cousins of Gumor,\" said Anak. \"They broke in our hands. With only smiting-stones and knives, we overcame them. Further, she tried to plot with me to kill you and take your place.\"  \"He lies!\" cried Esle in a quavering voice. Uglik turned a black face on her.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Enough!\" he roared. \"The sacrifice is sufficient. I withdraw the death word. Anak, the cause of dissension between us is gone. Rejoin the tribe in peace.\"  \"I bow to the Father,\" replied Anak, suiting his action to his word. \"The tribe of Ugar has gained three members.\"  \"Three?\" asked Uglik.  \"The maiden, Una, was not slain, but borne away alive by the cousins of Gumor. I have rescued her and she waits in the valley of plenty.\"  \"Then Degar Astok was right when he told me he should have a new High Priestess,\" said Uglik, licking his lips. \"She shall come to my cave and take the place of that worn-out hag, Esle.\"  \"She will dwell in mine,\" said Anak shortly. \"I have taken her for mine and I will not give her up.\"  \"The word of the Father is the law of the tribe,\" said Uglik.  \"That is true. I ask that the maiden whom I have taken in war be given to me in peace.\"  \"The maiden, Una, dwells in the Father's cave!\" said Uglik.  \"Then cry I rannag on you, Uglik, the Father!\" cried Anak. \"I challenge you to the fight to death, which you may not refuse and continue to rule.\"  \"And on you I pass the death word!\" shouted Uglik. \"Hunters--\"  \"The Father may not pass the death word on one who has cried rannag,\" retorted Anak. \"Such is the law!\"  \"Such is the law!\" echoed the hunters, glad of an excuse not to attack the two hunters of whose prowess they knew so much.  Uglik looked from one group to the other.  \"When the sun starts to rest, the rannag will be fought,\" he answered. \"When I have slain this traitor, Una becomes High Priestess. Hunters, bind the hag, Esle, that she may not escape. Anak, lead the way to the valley of plenty.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Packing up was a simple matter for the tribe of Ugar. In five minutes they were following Anak to the valley of the Neanderthalers. When they arrived, Uglik picked out the largest of the caves, and told the hunters to choose their own. In a few minutes the tribe was established in their new home. Esle was released from her bonds, for it was essential that the High Priestess of Degar Astok prepare the ground for the rannag.  Anak and Invar walked slowly up to the cave where Una waited.  \"Uglik is a mighty warrior,\" said Invar doubtfully.  \"So is Anak,\" was the reply. \"Further, I have a plan.\"  \"Then are Uglik's days numbered,\" replied Invar with delight. \"Tell me what I am to do to aid you.\"  \"When we get to the cave, you may cut off my hair and beard.\"  Invar started back aghast.  \"Your strength will go with it,\" he protested. \"The glory of the warrior is his beard.\"  \"I do not believe it,\" said Anak. \"By cutting it, I will rob Uglik of a handhold he could use to my downfall. Fear not, I know what I am doing.\"  With a flint knife, Invar slowly and painfully hacked off Anak's long hair and beard. When the operation was over, Anak smeared himself plentifully with the fat of a wild pig which had fallen to one of Invar's spears the day before. When he was ready, he threw himself down to sleep. When he had dropped off to slumber, Una rose. She took "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26989"],["title","B. C. 30,000 (#4)"],["body","liver of the pig from the back of the cave and approached the doorway.  \"Where go you, Una?\" demanded Invar.  \"I take this to the Father that he may strengthen himself for the rannag,\" she said enigmatically. \"Should not the best be given to the Father?\"  Invar's hand tightened on his throwing-spear.  \"Minded am I to slay you,\" he said darkly.  \"And fight to the death with Anak when he awakens? Listen, oh, fool, if the Father eats greatly, he will be slow and Anak may slay him with ease.\"  A light of admiration flashed into Invar's eyes.  \"It is well thought,\" he said.         *       *       *       *       *  With a swift glance around, Una took from her girdle a tiny skin packet. She opened it and displayed a brown powder.  \"This, Esle gave me,\" she whispered. \"She said that Uglik had threatened her death and she wished Anak to kill him. If I give Anak this, Degar Astok would make him strong.\"  \"Why did you not do so?\"  \"Because I am a woman, and I know a woman's heart. It would have the opposite effect. I will rub it into the liver I give to Uglik.\"  With the aid of the women, Esle laid out a rough oval on the ground where the two combatants were to meet. Throwing-stones and spears were not allowed in rannag, the two combatants fighting their duel with smiting-stones and flint knives only. At the appointed hour, the two combatants appeared, stripped to their loin-clothes only. The Father was hideous with streaks of paint, red, yellow, white, and black. Anak glistened from his coat of grease, but his skin was bare of ornament.  The two combatants took their places, while around the fighting ground gathered the hunters and youths, throwing-spears in hand. Their privilege and duty it was to slay either of the fighters who fled or who was forced out of the ring. Esle intoned a long prayer to Degar Astok. The word for combat was given. The two men approached each other cautiously. The Father confident in his strength, but he felt heavy and lethargic. Anak was clear-eyed and alert, ready to take advantage of any opening offered him.  The two men circled, wary as great jungle cats. Anak, suddenly ducked his head and rubbed his eyes. With a roar of triumph, Uglik charged.  Outside the ring, there was a commotion. A woman's scream, rent the air. Invar leaped to Una's side, to find her wrestling with Esle.  \"Kill her, Invar!\" shrieked the girl. \"She tried to cast a spell on Anak.\"  The young hunter forced open the High Priestess' hand. In it was grasped a bit of shiny quartz with which she had reflected the sun into the hunter's eyes. With upraised hand, he struck her to the ground.  \"She shall be judged after the rannag,\" he said. \"Take you this spear, Una, and drive it through her if she moves.\"  The girl took the spear. Invar returned to watch the fight. Anak had sidestepped the first rush of the Father and his smiting-stone had bit heavily into Uglik's shoulder. Uglik had whirled and charged again. Anak made as if to leap to one side. As Uglik changed his direction to meet him, Anak swayed back. Again his smiting-stone bit heavily into the Father's side. With a cry of pain, Uglik paused and changed his tactics. He approached cautiously, ready to leap to either side. Farther and farther Anak retreated until the hunters at the end of the oval raised their spears in anticipation. Then Anak charged.  Uglik was taken by surprise. His blow glanced off Anak's upraised stone while an upward sweep of the weapon took him in the neck. He dropped his stone and threw his arms around Anak's body. Well had Anak planned when he greased his body, for Uglik's grip failed. Anak shook him loose and struck again. Once more Uglik grasped him, and this time threw him heavily to the ground. Again the grease made his hold slip. Anak struggled to his feet, but it was evident that the fall had hurt him.         *       *       *       *       *  Uglik followed up his advantage. He warded off the blow of the hunter's stone and again flung him to earth. Anak dropped his stone.  Uglik's hands fastened on the hunter's throat, and mercilessly he banged Anak's head on the rocky ground. Anak wound his mighty legs about the Father's middle. Silently they put forth their strength. Uglik's hold was the more deadly, and slowly the hunter weakened.  \"The Father kills!\" screamed Esle.  She strove to rise to her feet, but Una had her orders from Invar. She pressed home the spear. With a sob, Esle fell back.  Anak's tongue began to protrude from his mouth and his eyes swelled. An expression of triumph spread over Uglik's face, which suddenly changed to one of amazement, and then to pain and fear.  As they rolled over, Anak had felt something pierce his leg. The pain was nothing, but it persisted. As his consciousness slipped away, only that one feeling remained. He reached down to his leg. Thrust deep into his thigh was a knife-like sliver of flint. With a supreme effort, he rallied his failing consciousness and grasped it. The Father's chest was directly over him. With his last conscious effort, he thrust upward with the fragment of flint. His aim was true. Uglik suddenly released his hold and raised himself to his knees, his hands plucking at his chest. For a moment he swayed forward and back. Then, with a cry, he pitched forward, blood gushing from his chest over the unconscious hunter.         *       *       *       *       *  Anak recovered consciousness to find his opponent lying dead before him, the sliver of flint buried in his heart. He staggered to his feet and tried to speak. His vocal cords refused to act and he massaged his throat gently.  \"I am Father of the tribe of Ugar by right of rannag,\" he said hoarsely. \"Do any challenge the right?\"  There was no answer. Anak stepped to Una's side.  \"Uglik spoke truth when he said that Una would be High Priestess of Degar Astok,\" he said. \"This I now proclaim her. You, Esle, stripped of your office, shall do menial tasks for all who will until death claims you. If your homage wavers, death will not be long.  \"Lo, I make a new law for the tribe. No longer shall all the women belong to the Father, but to those to whom the Father awards them. To each hunter, I now give one woman. He shall take her to his cave and hunt for her. She shall obey him and no other. The others shall live in a woman's cave, and shall be tabu until they are chosen by one who has no woman, or until a hunter desires more than one woman to chip his flints and dress his skins. Hunters, choose your women and take up caves. Here stays the tribe of Ugar forever, and we will allow no others in the valley.\"  Followed by Una he strode toward the Father's cave. Below the hunters and the women eyed one another a trifle fearfully. At last Invar stepped forward and grasped one of them by the arm.  \"Come to my cave!\" he ordered.  The woman followed him submissively.     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Astounding Stories_ April 1932.
