He could not but see the force of Watson's reasoning. The Major rose to his feet. He was smiling away again, as if he were enjoying himself.  \"We surrender!\" announced Watson with a woebegone expression on his strong face.  \"You'll admit,\" said Lightfoot, \"that I was too clever for you?\"  There was no answer. George picked up Waggie. \"Can I take my dog along with us, wherever we go?\" he asked.  [Illustration: The Major Merely Changed the Position of His Legs]  The Major suddenly advanced towards George, and patted the tiny animal. \"Hello! Waggie, how are you, old man?\" he cried.  George gasped. \"How on earth did you know Waggie's name?\" he asked. For Waggie had been chewing at a bone on the floor ever since the entrance of the Confederate, and his master had not addressed a word to him during that time.  \"I know his name almost as well as I do yours, George Knight,\" said Lightfoot.  In his excitement George dropped Waggie on a chair. The three Northerners heard this last announcement with open-mouthed astonishment.  Lightfoot burst into a great laugh that made the mystery the more intense. \"Why, comrades,\" he cried, \"I ought to go on the stage; I had no idea I was such a good actor. Don't you know your friend, Walter Jenks?\" The Southern accent of the speaker had suddenly disappeared.  The listeners stood dumfounded. Then the whole situation dawned upon them. They had been most gloriously and successfully duped. This Major Lightfoot was none other than Walter Jenks, a sergeant from General Mitchell's camp, whom Andrews had sent out on the bridge-burning party. He had shaved off his beard, and assumed a Southern accent (something he was able to do because he was a Marylander), so that the guests at the Page mansion had failed to recognize him.  Jenks shook the three warmly by the hand. \"It was a mean trick to play on you fellows,\" he explained, lowering his voice, \"but for the life of me I couldn't resist the temptation.\"  \"How on earth did you turn up here in the guise of a Confederate officer?\" asked Watson, who now felt a sense of exhilaration in knowing that he might yet join Andrews at Marietta.  \"It is too long a story to tell,\" whispered Jenks. \"I'll only say here that I got lost from the other two fellows I was traveling with--was suspected of being a spy in one of the villages I passed through--and, to avoid pursuit, had to shave off my beard and disguise myself in this Confederate uniform, which I was lucky enough to 'appropriate.' I was nearly starved--stumbled across this place or my way down--told a plausible story (Heaven forgive me for deceiving so delightful a lady as Mrs. Page)--and here I am! And the sooner we set off from here, the sooner we will meet at the appointed town.\"  \"When the war's over,\" remarked Macgreggor, \"you can earn a fortune on the stage.\"  Half an hour later the four Northerners had taken a grateful farewell of the unsuspecting Mrs. Page, and were hurrying along the bank of the Tennessee. By four o'clock in the afternoon they had reached a point directly opposite Chattanooga. Here they found a ferryman, just as they had been given to expect, with his flat \"horse-boat\" moored to the shore. He was a fat, comfortable-looking fellow, as he sat in tailor-fashion on the little wharf, smoking a corncob pipe as unconcernedly as though he had nothing to do all day but enjoy tobacco.  Watson approached the man. \"We want to get across the river as soon as possible,\" he explained, pointing to his companions. \"This officer (indicating Walter Jenks, who retained his Confederate uniform) and the rest of us must be in Chattanooga within half an hour.\"  The ferryman took his pipe from his mouth and regarded the party quizzically. \"You may want to be in Chattanooga in half an hour,\" he said, in a drawling, lazy fashion, \"but I reckon the river's got somethin' to say as to that!\" He waved one hand slowly in the direction of the stream, which was, without a shadow of doubt, an angry picture to gaze upon. Its waters were turbulent enough to suggest that a passage across them at this moment would be attended by great risk.  But to the anxious travelers any risk, however great, seemed preferable to waiting. If they missed the evening train from Chattanooga to Marietta their usefulness was ended. No bridge-burning adventure for them!  \"I tell you we _must_ get over to-night,\" urged Jenks, who hoped that his uniform would give him a certain prestige in the eyes of the ferryman. \"I am Major Lightfoot, of the --th Virginia, and I'm on an important mission. Every minute is precious!\"  \"That may be true enough, Colonel,\" replied the man, ignoring the title of \"major,\" and taking a whiff from his pipe. \"That may be true enough, but I calculate nature's got somethin' to say in this world. And I calculate I ain't a-going to risk my life, and the happiness of my wife and five children, by tryin' to stem the Tennessee in this turmoil.\"  George's heart sank within him. To be so near the realization of his dream of adventure, and to be stopped at the eleventh hour by this stupid, cautious boatman! Waggie, who had been frisking near him, suddenly became solemn.  Watson pulled from his coat a large pack of Confederate money. \"There's money for you,\" he cried, \"if you'll take us over!\"  The ferryman eyed him in a sleepy way, and took another pull at that provoking pipe.  \"Money!\" he said, after a long pause, during which the Northerners gazed at him as if their very lives depended on his decision. \"Money! What's the use to me of money, if we all get drowned crossing over?\"  As he spoke the river roared and rushed downwards on its course with a heedlessness that quite justified him in his hesitation. \"Wait till to-morrow morning, and the Tennessee will be quieter. Then I'll help you out.\"  \"Wait till doomsday, why don't you say?\" thundered Jenks. \"We must take the risk--and I order you to take us over, at once!\"  \"You may be a very big man in the army,\" answered the ferryman, \"but your orders don't go here!\" He produced a small tin box from the tail of his coat, leisurely poured from it into his pipe some strong tobacco, and slowly lighted the stuff. Then he arose, walked to the edge of the wharf, and beckoned to a lad of nine or ten years old who was half asleep in the boat. The boy jumped up, leaped upon the wharf, and ran off along the river's bank in the opposite direction from which the four strangers had come. He had received a mysterious order from the ferryman.  \"What's the matter now?\" asked Macgreggor, who had a strong desire to knock down this imperturbable fellow who refused to be impressed even by a Confederate uniform.  \"Nothing,\" replied the man, stolidly. He sat down again, crossed his legs, and took a long pull at the pipe.  \"For the last time,\" shouted Jenks, shaking his fist in the smoker's face, \"I order you to take out that boat, and ferry us across the river!\"  \"For the last time,\" said the man, very calmly, \"I tell you I'm not going to risk my life for four fools!\"  George walked up closer to Watson, and whispered: \"Let's seize the boat, and try to cross over ourselves!\"  Watson beckoned to his two companions, and told them what the boy suggested.  \"We will be taking our lives in our hands,\" said Jenks, \"but anything is better than being delayed here.\"  \"Besides,\" added Macgreggor, \"although the river _is_ pretty mischievous-looking, I don't think it's any more dangerous than waiting here.\"  Jenks took out his watch, and looked at it. \"I'll give you just five minutes,\" he said, addressing the ferryman, \"and if by that time you haven't made up your mind to take us over the river, we'll take the law into our own hands, seize your boat, and try the journey ourselves.\" Waggie began to bark violently, as if he sympathized with this speech.  The man smiled. \"That will be a fool trick,\" he answered. \"If it's dangerous for me, it'll be death for you uns. Better say your prayers, partner!\"  \"Only four minutes left!\" cried Jenks, resolutely, keeping an eye on the watch.  The ferryman closed his eyes and resumed his smoking. The others watched him intently. Meanwhile George was thinking. Two minutes more passed. The boy was recalling a saying of his father's: \"Sometimes you can taunt an obstinate man into doing things, where you can't reason with him.\"  \"Time is up!\" said Jenks, at last. \"Come, boys, let's make a break for the boat!\"  The ferryman placed his pipe on the ground with the greatest composure. \"Take the boat if you want,\" he observed, rising to his feet, \"but you fellows won't get very far in it! Look there!\"  He pointed up the river's bank. The boy who had been sent away a few minutes before was coming back to the wharf; he was now, perhaps, a quarter of a mile away, but he was not alone. He was bringing with him five Confederate soldiers, who were walking briskly along with muskets at right shoulder.  \"You fellows looked kind o' troublesome,\" explained the ferryman, \"so as there's a picket up yonder I thought I'd send my son up for 'em!\"  Watson made a move towards the boat. \"Better stay here,\" cried the ferryman; \"for before you can get a hundred feet away from the bank in this contrary stream those soldiers will pick you off with their muskets. D'ye want to end up as food for fishes?\"  The men groaned in spirit. \"It's too late,\" muttered Jenks. He could picture the arrival at Marietta of all the members of the expedition save his own party, and the triumphal railroad escapade the next day. And when the Northern newspapers would ring with the account of the affair, his own name would not appear in the list of the brave adventurers.  Suddenly George went up to the ferryman, and said, with much distinctness: \"I see we have to do with a coward! There's not a boatman in Kentucky who wouldn't take us across this river. Even a Yankee wouldn't fear it. But you are so afraid you'll have "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26906"],["title","The Jameson Satellite (#0)"],["body","JAMESON SATELLITE  By NEIL R. JONES      _The mammoths of the ancient world have been wonderfully preserved     in the ice of Siberia. The cold, only a few miles out in space, will     be far more intense than in the polar regions and its power of     preserving the dead body would most probably be correspondingly     increased. When the hero-scientist of this story knew he must die,     he conceived a brilliant idea for the preservation of his body, the     result of which even exceeded his expectations. What, how, and why     are cleverly told here._     PROLOGUE  _The Rocket Satellite_   In the depths of space, some twenty thousand miles from the earth, the body of Professor Jameson within its rocket container cruised upon an endless journey, circling the gigantic sphere. The rocket was a satellite of the huge, revolving world around which it held to its orbit. In the year 1958, Professor Jameson had sought for a plan whereby he might preserve his body indefinitely after his death. He had worked long and hard upon the subject.  Since the time of the Pharaohs, the human race had looked for a means by which the dead might be preserved against the ravages of time. Great had been the art of the Egyptians in the embalming of their deceased, a practice which was later lost to humanity of the ensuing mechanical age, never to be rediscovered. But even the embalming of the Egyptians--so Professor Jameson had argued--would be futile in the face of millions of years, the dissolution of the corpses being just as eventual as immediate cremation following death.  The professor had looked for a means by which the body could be preserved perfectly forever. But eventually he had come to the conclusion that nothing on earth is unchangeable beyond a certain limit of time. Just as long as he sought an earthly means of preservation, he was doomed to disappointment. All earthly elements are composed of atoms which are forever breaking down and building up, but never destroying themselves. A match may be burned, but the atoms are still unchanged, having resolved themselves into smoke, carbon dioxide, ashes, and certain basic elements. It was clear to the professor that he could never accomplish his purpose if he were to employ one system of atomic structure, such as embalming fluid or other concoction, to preserve another system of atomic structure, such as the human body, when all atomic structure is subject to universal change, no matter how slow.  [Illustration: It glowed in a haze of light, the interior clearly revealed.]  He had then soliloquized upon the possibility of preserving the human body in its state of death until the end of all earthly time--to that day when the earth would return to the sun from which it had sprung. Quite suddenly one day he had conceived the answer to the puzzling problem which obsessed his mind, leaving him awed with its wild, uncanny potentialities.  He would have his body shot into space enclosed in a rocket to become a satellite of the earth as long as the earth continued to exist. He reasoned logically. Any material substance, whether of organic or inorganic origin, cast into the depths of space would exist indefinitely. He had visualized his dead body enclosed in a rocket flying off into the illimitable maw of space. He would remain in perfect preservation, while on earth millions of generations of mankind would live and die, their bodies to molder into the dust of the forgotten past. He would exist in this unchanged manner until that day when mankind, beneath a cooling sun, should fade out forever in the chill, thin atmosphere of a dying world. And still his body would remain intact and as perfect in its rocket container as on that day of the far-gone past when it had left the earth to be hurled out on its career. What a magnificent idea!  At first he had been assailed with doubts. Suppose his funeral rocket landed upon some other planet or, drawn by the pull of the great sun, were thrown into the flaming folds of the incandescent sphere? Then the rocket might continue on out of the solar system, plunging through the endless seas of space for millions of years, to finally enter the solar system of some far-off star, as meteors often enter ours. Suppose his rocket crashed upon a planet, or the star itself, or became a captive satellite of some celestial body?  It had been at this juncture that the idea of his rocket becoming the satellite of the earth had presented itself, and he had immediately incorporated it into his scheme. The professor had figured out the amount of radium necessary to carry the rocket far enough away from the earth so that it would not turn around and crash, and still be not so far away but what the earth's gravitational attraction would keep it from leaving the vicinity of the earth and the solar system. Like the moon, it would forever revolve around the earth.  He had chosen an orbit sixty-five thousand miles from the earth for his rocket to follow. The only fears he had entertained concerned the huge meteors which careened through space at tremendous rates of speed. He had overcome this obstacle, however, and had eliminated the possibilities of a collision with these stellar juggernauts. In the rocket were installed radium repulsion rays which swerved all approaching meteors from the path of the rocket as they entered the vicinity of the space wanderer.  The aged professor had prepared for every contingency, and had set down to rest from his labors, reveling in the stupendous, unparalleled results he would obtain. Never would his body undergo decay; and never would his bones bleach to return to the dust of the earth from which all men originally came and to which they must return. His body would remain millions of years in a perfectly preserved state, untouched by the hoary palm of such time as only geologists and astronomers can conceive.  His efforts would surpass even the wildest dreams of H. Rider Haggard, who depicted the wondrous, embalming practices of the ancient nation of Kor in his immortal novel, \"She,\" wherein Holly, under the escort of the incomparable Ayesha, looked upon the magnificent, lifelike masterpieces of embalming by the long-gone peoples of Kor.  With the able assistance of a nephew, who carried out his instructions and wishes following his death, Professor Jameson was sent upon his pilgrimage into space within the rocket he himself had built. The nephew and heir kept the secret forever locked in his heart.         *       *       *       *       *  Generation after generation had passed upon its way. Gradually humanity had come to die out, finally disappearing from the earth altogether. Mankind was later replaced by various other forms of life which dominated the globe for their allotted spaces of time before they too became extinct. The years piled up on one another, running into millions, and still the Jameson Satellite kept its lonely vigil around the earth, gradually closing the distance between satellite and planet, yielding reluctantly to the latter's powerful attraction.  Forty million years later, its orbit ranged some twenty thousand miles from the earth while the dead world edged ever nearer the cooling sun whose dull, red ball covered a large expanse of the sky. Surrounding the flaming sphere, many of the stars could be perceived through the earth's thin, rarefied atmosphere. As the earth cut in slowly and gradually toward the solar luminary, so was the moon revolving ever nearer the earth, appearing like a great gem glowing in the twilight sky.  The rocket containing the remains of Professor Jameson continued its endless travel around the great ball of the earth whose rotation had now ceased entirely--one side forever facing the dying sun. There it pursued its lonely way, a cosmic coffin, accompanied by its funeral cortege of scintillating stars amid the deep silence of the eternal space which enshrouded it. Solitary it remained, except for the occasional passing of a meteor flitting by at a remarkable speed on its aimless journey through the vacuum between the far-flung worlds.  Would the satellite follow its orbit to the world's end, or would its supply of radium soon exhaust itself after so many eons of time, converting the rocket into the prey of the first large meteor which chanced that way? Would it some day return to the earth as its nearer approach portended, and increase its acceleration in a long arc to crash upon the surface of the dead planet? And when the rocket terminated its career, would the body of Professor Jameson be found perfectly preserved or merely a crumbled mound of dust?     CHAPTER I  _40,000,000 Years After_   Entering within the boundaries of the solar system, a long, dark, pointed craft sped across the realms of space towards the tiny point of light which marked the dull red ball of the dying sun which would some day lie cold and dark forever. Like a huge meteor it flashed into the solar system from another chain of planets far out in the illimitable Universe of stars and worlds, heading towards the great red sun at an inconceivable speed.  Within the interior of the space traveler, queer creatures of metal labored at the controls of the space flyer which juggernauted on its way towards the far-off solar luminary. Rapidly it crossed the orbits of Neptune and Uranus and headed sunward. The bodies of these queer creatures were square blocks of a metal closely resembling steel, while for appendages, the metal cube was upheld by four jointed legs capable of movement. A set of six tentacles, all metal, like the rest of the body, curved outward from the upper half of the cubic body. Surmounting it was a queer-shaped head rising to a peak in the center and equipped with a circle of eyes all the way around the head. The creatures, with their mechanical eyes equipped with metal shutters, could see in all directions. A single eye pointed directly upward, being situated in the space of the peaked head,"]]]
