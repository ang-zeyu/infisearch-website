Sound it long!     Ye who have wept fourscore can tell       The holy meaning of their song.      'Tis freedom's birthday--blood-bought boon!       O war-rent flag! O soldier-shroud!     Thine be the glory--nor too soon       Is heard your \"Cry aloud!\"      O not too soon is rent the chain       And charter, trampling right in dust!     Till God is God no longer--ne'er again       Quench liberty that's just.      Lynn, Mass., _February 3, 1865_.     \"_MEMENTO_\"      Respectfully inscribed to my friends in Lynn.         I come to thee       O'er the moonlit sea,     When the hoarse wave revisits thy shore!       When waters shout,       And the stars peep out,     I am with thee in spirit once more.        Then list the moan       Of the billows' foam,     Laving with surges thy silv'ry beach!       Night's dewy eye,       The sea-mew's lone cry,     Witness my presence and utter my speech.        Pleasant a grave       By the \"Rock\" or wave,     And afar from life's turmoil its goal.       No sculptured lie,       Or hypocrite sigh,     E'er to mock the bright truth of the soul.        Friends, will not ye       Think kindly of me,     In those moments to memory bestowed?       Smile on me yet,       O blue eyes and jet,     Soft as when parting thy sympathy glowed!      _March 3, 1867._     _COMMUNION HYMN_       Saw ye my Saviour? Heard ye the glad sound?     Felt ye the power of the Word?     'Twas the Truth that made us free,     And was found by you and me     In the life and the love of our Lord.      Mourner, it calls you,--\"Come to my bosom,     Love wipes your tears all away,     And will lift the shade of gloom,     And for you make radiant room     Midst the glories of one endless day.\"      Sinner, it calls you,--\"Come to this fountain,     Cleanse the foul senses within;     'Tis the Spirit that makes pure,     That exalts thee, and will cure     All thy sorrow and sickness and sin.\"      Strongest deliverer, friend of the friendless,     Life of all being divine:     Thou the Christ, and not the creed;     Thou the Truth in thought and deed;     Thou the water, the bread, and the wine.     _LAUS DEO!_      The laying of the corner-stone of The Mother Church.       Laus Deo, it is done!     Rolled away from loving heart         Is a stone.     Lifted higher, we depart,         Having one.      _Laus Deo_,--on this rock     (Heaven chiseled squarely good)         Stands His church,--     God is Love, and understood         By His flock.      _Laus Deo_, night star-lit     Slumbers not in God's embrace;         Be awake;     Like this stone, be in thy place:         Stand, not sit.      Grave, silent, steadfast stone,     Dirge and song and shoutings low         In thy heart     Dwell serene,--and sorrow? No,     It has none,         _Laus Deo!_     _OUR NATIONAL THANKSGIVING HYMN_       God of the rolling year! to Thee we raise     A nation's holiest hymn in grateful praise!     Plenty and peace abound at Thy behest,     Yet wherefore this Thy love? Thou knowest best!      Thou who, impartial, blessings spreadst abroad,     Thou wisdom, Love, and Truth,--divinely God!     Who giveth joy and tears, conflict and rest,     Teaching us thus of Thee, who knowest best!      Ruler Supreme! to Thee we'll meekly bow,     When we have learned of Truth what Thou doest now--     Why from this festive hour some dear lost guest     Bears hence its sunlit glow--Thou knowest best!      How have our honored dead fought on in gloom!     Peace her white wings will spread over their tomb;     Why waited their reward, triumph and rest,     Till molds the hero form? Thou knowest best!      Shades of our heroes! the Union now is one,     The star whose destiny none may outrun;     Tears of the bleeding slave poured on her breast,     When to be wiped away, Thou knowest best!      Thou who in the Christ hallowed its grief,--     O meekest of mourners, while yet the chief,--     Give to the pleading hearts comfort and rest,     In that benediction which knoweth best!      Lynn, Mass., _December 7, 1865_.     _SATISFIED_       It matters not what be thy lot,         So Love doth guide;     For storm or shine, pure peace is thine,         Whate'er betide.      And of these stones, or tyrants' thrones,         God able is     To raise up seed--in thought and deed--         To faithful His.      Aye, darkling sense, arise, go hence!         Our God is good.     False fears are foes--truth tatters those,         When understood.      Love looseth thee, and lifteth me,         Ayont hate's thrall:     There Life is light, and wisdom might,         And God is All.      The centuries break, the earth-bound wake,         God's glorified!     Who doth His will--His likeness still--         Is satisfied.      Pleasant View, Concord, N. H., _January, 1900_."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27378"],["title","The Story of the Heavens (#0)"],["body","made available by The Internet Archive/American Libraries.)

Professor Pickering has allowed me to copy some of the drawings made at Harvard College Observatory by Mr. Trouvelot, and I have availed myself of his kindness for Plates I., IV., XII., XV.  I am indebted to Professor Langley for Plate II., to Mr. De la Rue for Plates III. and XIV., to Mr. T.E. Key for Plate XVII., to Professor Schiaparelli for Plate XVIII., to the late Professor C. Piazzi Smyth for Fig. 100, to Mr. Chambers for Fig. 7, which has been borrowed from his \"Handbook of Descriptive Astronomy,\" to Dr. Stoney for Fig. 78, and to Dr. Copeland and Dr. Dreyer for Fig. 72. I have to acknowledge the valuable assistance derived from Professor Newcomb's \"Popular Astronomy,\" and Professor Young's \"Sun.\" In revising the volume I have had the kind aid of the Rev. Maxwell Close.  I have also to thank Dr. Copeland and Mr. Steele for their kindness in reading through the entire proofs; while I have also occasionally availed myself of the help of Mr. Cathcart.
