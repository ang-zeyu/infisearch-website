C. L. Roper, D.O.   R. S. KITCHENER, PRINTER, OAKLAND, CAL.  1916      Copyrighted 1916  by  DORA C. C. L. ROPER  All Rights Reserved         Man is composed of what he has assimilated from his     spiritual, mental and physical food     INTRODUCTION   These pages are dedicated to those who are seeking light on the question of rational living and to all who are suffering from the effects of wrong living. Thought along this line expresses growth and progress, and with it comes knowledge. Common sense and judgment, following a natural instinct, will go a long way toward attaining better health. But those who, through the constant use of cooked, or highly spiced and fermented food, have lost their natural instincts and intuitions, will find the study of the science of dietetical chemistry of inestimable value toward a better understanding of natural laws, and be enabled to make the selections and combinations of foods more suitable to their temperament.  Before the question as to meat eating and vegetarianism can be solved, we must consider the first principle of nature, which is the law of self preservation. Thereafter we may be able to think and strive to save the lives of animals, now cruelly sacrificed largely for the sense gratification of man. The artificial preparation of food is a fine art, and no doubt has helped much toward the development of our central nervous system.  The ordinary mixed diet with the addition of meat two or three times per week is the safest method for most people who are compelled to work eight, ten, or twelve hours out of every twenty-four and have to deprive themselves of the proper amount of fresh air, sunshine and physical exercise, which brings all the muscles and organs of the body into proper action.  Inharmony, disease, and misfortune are largely caused by living a life contrary to the laws of nature.  The fulfillment of high ideals must be accompanied by common sense and judgment, so it becomes an evolution instead of revolution. The evolving of man from the stage of a jelly fish to a being possessed of a bony framework in an upright position by the eating of animals has developed a higher self. After having reached this stage of evolution the nature of some people has become so highly sensitized that meat, as a food, becomes repugnant to them. What they need is a stepping stone. The very food which has produced this state of over refinement or destruction must be used for construction and minimized by degrees.  In examining the claims of the disciples of vegetarianism it is well to consider those nations whose constitution and customs of work and education resemble our own. And in doing so we find that while nearly all European nations, as well as many of the Orient, practice moderation in meat eating, still they are for the most part only \"near vegetarians,\" and therefore should not be used as examples in an argument for vegetarianism.  It is possible for normal individuals under fairly normal conditions of life to nourish perfectly their bodies on a vegetarian diet, provided they are willing to live mainly on sun-kissed foods instead of on a mass of sloppily-cooked, devitalized, starchy vegetables, and soft nitrogenous foods that burden the digestive organs and produce obesity and slow consumption.  I hope that the menus on the following pages will be a help to all who seek simplicity from a standpoint of health as well as economy.  Note: For preparation of foods, consult Scientific Feeding.      Some people think that we become like the food we eat. This     is true when the vibrations of what we eat are stronger than     the vibrations in our bodies. All food consumed has a     vibration of its own and unless the vital force within can     change the rate of vibration of the food eaten and tune it to     the vibration of the body itself, one cannot become     nourished, or in other words \"he becomes like the food he     eats.\" There is but one force or energy in the body, which is     life or \"spirit.\" Under normal conditions this force has in     itself all the power to harmonize with the vibrations of the     foods taken into the body. Provided there is a demand for     food in the form of true hunger.      Natural diet, deep rhythmic breathing with corresponding     exercises awaken latent talents within us and rapid mental     and spiritual unfoldment takes place. Inharmony, disease and     pain are caused by living a life contrary to the laws of God     and Nature.     HOW TO BECOME A VEGETARIAN.   Adopting a vegetarian diet should be done with great care, and not in a hurry, especially when the person is not in perfect health.  The best time to begin is the Spring. People who have lived on excessive meat should cut it down to two and three times per week, substituting cured meat and fish part of the time.  It may take months, or even years to educate the cells of the stomach to act upon nuts, legumes, and other heavy protein foods, so as to be properly nourished. An individual with great adaptability may make this change without much discomfort, but many people who desire to leave off meat, do so because they are already sick from wrong eating. If they feel benefited by the change for a while it is generally because their system is eliminating the toxins which are the result of excessive meat eating. After this has taken place, the body requires food, properly combined and proportioned, or else nerve starvation and obesity are the result.  To those who for various reasons desire to adopt a vegetarian diet I would say, do not substitute bread and vegetables for meat. Do not spend your energy making new and complex dishes as advocated in fashionable vegetarian cook books. Compounds containing several soft proteins such as beans, nuts, eggs and cream, besides starches, are a burden to the liver and alimentary canal and lay the foundation for new diseases.  If cooked foods are required, study carefully the preparation of nutritious soups, well boiled cereals, salads, and add as many raw foods as possible.  Exercise more in the open air, live and work in sunny well ventilated rooms, retire early and live as close to nature as you can.  I hope that the following pages may serve as a stepping stone for all who desire to eat less meat, as well as for those who wish to become vegetarians.      In adopting a raw food diet, or in reducing heat-giving     elements, such as artificial sugars and hot drinks, it is     important to apply more external heat to the body for a     while, or else have the morning meal served in a sunny room.     Plenty of outdoor exercise is necessary to properly utilize a     vegetarian diet.     FOOD REQUIREMENTS.   It is important that the diet should contain the proper amount of protein, starches and fats, suitable to the individual needs. Age, weight, height, occupation, season and climate must all be considered. Numerous and careful researches regarding food requirements made during the last fifty years have led to the realization that the majority of civilized men and women consume from two to three times the amount of food necessary.     FOOD FOR THE AGED.   Many people at the ages of sixty and seventy still lead an active life, while others retire from activity at forty-five or fifty. Therefore, the food should conform to the person's mental and physical requirements. If the teeth are poor and the digestive powers weak, the food should be light, consisting mainly of well cooked cereals, baked potatoes, rice, cooked greens, a small amount of meat, raw fruits and raw greens in combination with fatty foods, as salads, milk and buttermilk, toasted breads and soups.  The total fuel requirement depends upon whether the individual leads a quiet or active existence. For a person who lives mainly indoors, and makes little use of the muscles of the arms, shoulders and trunk, 1000 to 1200 calories is sufficient for twenty-four hours. If more food is eaten than the body requires, the excess will manifest itself by the development of chronic ailments and obesity, or feeble-mindedness.  The morning and evening meals should consist of fluid and semi-fluid foods, or of toasted breads and salads. Meats, eggs (except the yolks), cheese, beans, peas and nuts should be eaten only during the middle of the day in small quantities. One can cut down his amount of food greatly by thoroughly chewing each morsel. The demand for protein at this period is small, while the amount of fat should be increased.     WHAT SHALL WE DRINK WITH OUR MEALS?   This question is often asked. It depends entirely on the quality and combination of food which is eaten.  A diet consisting of a variety of solids and vegetables with excessive fluids gives the stomach nothing to do; the contents pass at once into the intestines. Such mixtures are ingested instead of being digested; they cannot be fully utilized because stimulation upon the drainage of the body is lacking.  If dry foods are eaten, such as sandwiches, rice, macaroni, potatoes or dry cereals, without the addition of fruits, vegetables or soups, a small amount of liquid should be taken. Such simple foods do not form a perfect meal, therefore milk or broths are preferable to water. Water is best taken from five to fifteen minutes before the meal or from one to two hours after meals.      Note: These pages are not a perfected plan of right eating to     be slavishly followed. Each man is a law unto himself, and     with a little self-study and practical application this book     may be worth its weight in gold to the true student of     natural laws.
