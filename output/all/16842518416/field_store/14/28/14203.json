Decidedly this part of the English Channel was, for the time being at least, unhealthy; and Kapitan Schwalbe resolved to make for the Bristol Channel, where the dangers of being destroyed by modern mosquitoes were more remote.  Meanwhile Ross and Vernon had been sent back to the quarters in the alley-way, by the side of the motor-room.  Not knowing the reason for the U-boat's sudden submergence, and consequently unaware of the danger that threatened her, they formed the erroneous impression that the submarine was about to attack.  \"The old fellow gave us a pretty straight tip,\" remarked Vernon, when the chums found themselves alone.  \"All the same, I vote we get out of it at the first opportunity, favourable or otherwise.\"  \"'Ssh,\" whispered Ross.  \"Someone might be listening.  I don't see how you propose to clear out, though.\"  \"We were on deck just now.\"  \"We were,\" agreed Trefusis.  \"It was fairly dark.  All the men up for'ard were lying down.  It would have been an easy matter to have dived overboard and swum for it, if we hadn't been twenty miles or more from land.\"  \"There was a bright look-out kept, all the same,\" objected Ross.  \"And I wouldn't mind saying that if the submarine were closer inshore, getting a supply of petrol, for example, we should be closely watched. All the same, I'm with you if we get the ghost of a chance.  But it's a rummy affair altogether.  Fancy that chap knowing our names and the rank of our respective fathers.\"  \"Ramblethorne must have told him that,\" said Vernon.  \"I suppose so; but for what reason?  By Jove, if we get out of this mess all right, we'll have something to talk about--having been prisoners on a German submarine!\"  The lads were not allowed on deck again that night.  Acting upon Haye's suggestion they \"turned in\", and slept fitfully until awakened by the noise of the watch being relieved.  The seaman, Hans Koppe, brought them their breakfast.  The meal consisted of fish, coffee, and the usual black bread.  By this time the captives had practically recovered from the effects of the injection. Haye's head was still painful, although the headache had left him.  They ate with avidity, owing possibly to the atmosphere of the confined space, which was highly charged with oxygen.  \"What is the Captain's name?\" asked Ross, when the man came to remove the breakfast things.  The sailor told him.  \"Where are we now?\" enquired Vernon.  The man winked solemnly.  \"Afloat,\" he replied.  \"Be content with that.\"  Just then there were unmistakable signs of activity on the part of the submarine crew.  Several men hurried along the alley-way, each with a set purpose.  They paid little heed to the Englanders as they passed.  At their heels came Herr Rix, the Leutnant of the submarine.  He was beaming affably.  \"Goot mornings!\" he exclaimed.  \"You come mit me, den I show you how we blockade.\"  He led the way to the compartment in which the bowl of the supplementary periscope was placed.  It was now broad daylight, and consequently the bowl showed a distinct image.  A junior officer was standing by, but on seeing Rix approach he saluted and moved aside.  \"Look!\" exclaimed the Leutnant.  Both lads peered into the bowl.  On its dull sides, an expanse of sea and sky was portrayed.  Beyond that they could see nothing, until Rix called their attention to a small dark object.  \"Englische sheep!\" he declared.  \"Now you vos watch.\"  He touched a metal stud.  Instantly an arrangement of telescopic lenses came into play within the tube of the periscope, with the result that a small portion of the view was greatly magnified upon the object card. It revealed a tramp of about nine hundred tons.  She had a single funnel painted black, with two broad red bands; two stumpy masts, with derricks, and a lofty bridge and chart-house abaft the funnel.  She was wall-sided.  Her rusty hull was originally painted black.  Here and there were squares of red lead, showing that her crew had been engaged in trying to smarten her up before she reached port.  Aft, frayed and dirty with the smoke that poured from her funnel, floated the red ensign.  The submarine began to rise.  Although she tilted abruptly, the image of the tramp steamer still remained upon the object bowl.  By an ingenious arrangement, the lenses were constructed to compensate for any deviation of the tube of the periscope from the vertical.  The lads could see the bows of the U-boat shaking clear of the water, throwing cascades of foam off on either side as the passing craft forged ahead at at least eighteen knots.  Now, for the first time, the skipper of the tramp saw the danger.  He was a short, thick-set man, with white hair and an iron-grey moustache, and a face the colour of mahogany.  For an instant he grasped the bridge-rails and looked towards the submarine, then gesticulated violently to the man at the wheel.  The spikes ran through the helmsman's hands, as he rapidly revolved the wheel actuating the steam steering-gear.  The tramp swung hard to port, with the idea of baffling the momentarily expected torpedo.  Kapitan Schwalbe acted up to his principles.  In any case he was loath to use a torpedo upon a comparatively small vessel.  In response to an order, half a dozen of the submarine's crew swarmed on deck, three going for'ard and three aft.  Within forty-five seconds the two disappearing guns were raised from the water-tight \"houses\".  Ross, Vernon, and the German Leutnant remained gazing into the bowl of the periscope.  The vision so absorbed the attention of the two lads that they hardly heeded the presence of Herr Rix, who occasionally emitted grunts of satisfaction or annoyance as the scene was enacted.  The bow gun spat viciously.  The range was but three hundred yards. The missile passed a few feet in front of the tramp's bows, and, throwing up a shower of spray that burst inboard on the British vessel's fo'c'sle, ricochetted a mile or so away.  The tramp's skipper showed his mettle.  Round swung the vessel, listing heavily as she did so.  By this time the call for more steam had been responded to, and dense clouds of black smoke belched from her funnel, mingled with puffs of white vapour as the siren bleated loudly for aid.  Running awash, U75 had a great advantage of speed; overtaking her prey she was able to send half a dozen shells into the lofty target presented as she slid by.  Holes gaped in the thin plating close to the waterline.  A shell, passing completely through the funnel, demolished the siren.  Being without wireless, the tramp was now without means of long-distance signalling.  Another missile hit the chart-house and, exploding, swept the frail structure overboard in a thousand fragments.  The old skipper, hit by a splinter of wood, fell inertly upon the bridge; but the next instant he staggered to his feet, bawling to the crew to get the hand-steering gear connected.  \"He's down again!\" exclaimed Ross breathlessly, as the brave old man dropped upon the shattered planking of the bridge.  \"Hurrah!  He's still alive.\"  The skipper had deliberately taken cover behind the slender shelter afforded by the metal side-light boards.  By the frantic movement of his arm, it was evident that he was exhorting his men to \"stick it\" like Britons.  The hail of shells continued.  Already fire had broken out on board in several places.  A sliver of metal sheered through the ensign staff. Without hesitation one of the crew rushed off, retrieved the weather-worn bunting, and made his way to the mainmast.  Slowly and deliberately he re-hoisted the ensign until it fluttered proudly from the truck, then with apparent unconcern the man disappeared below.  By this time the tramp was again under control, with a course shaped for land, which lay about ten miles to the S.S.E.  It was, however, a foregone conclusion that unless help were speedily forthcoming the vessel was doomed.  The tramp began to heel, almost imperceptibly at first, then with increasing speed.  She had received her _coup de gr√¢ce_.  Still the engines were kept going full speed ahead.  The dauntless skipper remained on the bridge, with a look of grim resolution on his weather-beaten features.  Slowly the vessel's way diminished.  Her bow-wave, owing to the gradually increasing draught, was greater, but less sharp than before. In a few minutes the water would be pouring over her fore-deck.  Seeing that their work was completed, the pirates ceased fire, the guns' crews standing with folded arms and stolidly watching the tramp as she struggled in her death-throes.  Presently a vast cloud of steam issued from her engine-room.  The inrush of water had damped her furnaces.  The engineer and firemen, their faces black with coal-dust and streaming with moisture, hurried on deck.  For another quarter of a mile the doomed vessel carried way, then came to a sudden stop.  As she did so she gave a quick list to starboard, until only a few inches of bulwark amidships showed above the waves.  Then, and only then, did the skipper give orders for the boats to be lowered.  In an orderly manner the crew manned the falls, and the task of abandoning the ship began.  Without undue haste, the crew dropped into the waiting boats, each man with a bundle containing his scanty personal effects wrapped up in a handkerchief.  The Captain was the last to leave.  He did so reluctantly, his left hand tightly grasping the ship's papers.  Having rowed a safe distance from the foundering vessel, the men rested on their oars, and waited in silence for the end.  It was not long in coming.  The tramp was heeling more and more, and slightly down by the bows. Suddenly she almost righted; then, amid a smother of foam as the compressed air burst open her hatches, she flung her stern high in the air.  Even then she seemed in no hurry.  The after part from the mainmast remained in view, the now motionless propeller"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26641"],["title","The Submarine Hunters: A Story of the Naval Patrol Work in the Great War (#8)"],["body","well clear of the water.  For quite a minute she remained thus, then with a quick yet almost gentle movement slid under the waves.  The last seen of her was the weather-worn red ensign still fluttering from the truck.  The periscope's bowl showed nothing but an expanse of sea and sky, and the two boats rising buoyantly to the waves.  A grim chuckle brought Ross and Vernon back to their surroundings. Herr Rix was rubbing his hands and grunting with evident satisfaction.  \"Goot!\" he ejaculated.  \"Now, how you like dat?  Now you see how we German make blockade, hein?\"  \"A brave deed,\" replied Ross scornfully, and, gripping Vernon by the arm, led him back to their uncomfortable quarters in the alley-way.     CHAPTER VII  On the Bed of the Sea  For the next twenty-four hours nothing exciting occurred.  The U-boat kept to the surface as much as possible, running under her petrol motors at fifteen knots.  To exceed that pace would mean too great a consumption of fuel, and already the vessel was short of petrol.  Kapitan Schwalbe was prone to act on the side of extreme caution. Having sunk one vessel, he would not tackle another in the same vicinity.  He invariably put at least a hundred miles between him and the scene of his latest ignominious exploit before attempting another act of kultur.  Three times during that twenty-four hours he dived: twice on sighting what were unquestionably Bristol Channel pilot-boats, and on the third occasion when a Penzance lugger under motor-power (for it was a dead calm) crossed his track.  All this time a regular stream of shipping was passing up and down the Bristol Channel, as unconcernedly as in the piping days of peace.  To anyone but a bumptious German, the sight would have told its own tale; for the British Mercantile Marine, used to danger and difficulties, was not to be deterred by the \"frightfulness\" of von Tirpitz's blockade. On the contrary, the possibility of falling in with a hostile submarine gave an unwonted spice to the everyday routine of the toilers of the sea.  After breakfast on the following morning Ross and Vernon were told to go on deck.  The sea was still calm, and the submarine, now running awash at full speed, was cleaving the water with practically dry decks.  The lads soon realized what was in progress.  A couple of miles away was a large ocean cargo-boat, outward bound, and U75 was in pursuit.  Trefusis and his chum were not allowed for'ard, where the quick-firer was already in position for opening fire.  They were ordered abaft the conning-tower, the hatch of which was open.  Kapitan Schwalbe's head and shoulders could be seen projecting above the opening.  On the raised grating surrounding the conning-tower, stood a boyish-looking Unter-leutnant.  Hermann Rix was nowhere to be seen.  Apparently his duties compelled him to remain below.  Presently the quick-firer barked, and a projectile struck the water about a hundred yards from the starboard side of the pursued vessel. With the discharge of the gun, a sailor hoisted the black cross ensign of Germany from a small flagstaff aft, while a signal in the International Code ordering the British vessel to heave to instantly fluttered from the light mast immediately abaft the conning-tower.  The only response from the chase was the hoisting of the red ensign, for previously she had shown no colours.  Slowly, defiantly, the bunting was hauled close up, and ironically \"dipped\" three times.  Again and again the submarine's bow-chaser fired.  The shells were well aimed as regards direction, but all fell short.  Imperceptibly the merchantman had increased distance.  \"Look at the fools!\" Ross heard the Kapitan remark, as he kept his binoculars focused on his intended prey.  \"They are trying to snapshot us.  Are all Englishmen so blind to peril?\"  \"Are you sure they haven't a couple of quick-firers mounted aft, sir?\" asked the Unter-leutnant.  \"There are several men gathered round something on the poop.\"  \"Himmel, I hope not!\" ejaculated Schwalbe.  \"But no; had they any guns they would have opened fire before now.  What is the matter with our gun-layer?  It is about time he got a shell home.\"  The Unter-leutnant lowered himself on the foredeck, and shouted angrily at the seaman whose duty it was to \"lay\" the bow-chasers.  The man again bent over the sights.  This time the shell pitched ahead of the chase, but slightly to port. Some of the spray thrown up by the projectile fell on board.  \"Is that the best you can do, you brainless idiot?\" shouted Schwalbe wrathfully.  Now that he was in pursuit he was loath to be baffled, but at the same time he realized that the submarine was using a lot of precious fuel and a prodigious amount of ammunition without any definite result.  In the midst of his torrent of abuse directed upon the luckless gun-layer, Kapitan Schwalbe suddenly stopped.  Gripping the rim of the oval hatchway he gazed, horror-stricken, at two objects bobbing in the water directly in the path of the submarine.  Then, recovering his voice, he shouted to the quartermaster to port helm.  The fellow obeyed promptly, but it was too late.  Practically simultaneously, two barrels swung round and crashed alongside the submarine's hull.  Officers and men, expecting momentarily to find themselves blown into the air, stood stock-still.  Then, as nothing so disastrous occurred, Schwalbe gave orders for easy astern.  The barrels, connected by a span of grass rope, had been thrown overboard from the pursued vessel, in the hope that the submarine would foul her propellers in the tangle of line.  Once a blade picked up that trailing rope, the latter would coil round the boss as tightly as a band of flexible steel.  The plan all but succeeded; only the metal guards protecting the propellers saved them from being hopelessly jammed.  Yet the attempt was attended with good results as far as the British ship was concerned, for by the time U75 had lost way and had cautiously backed away from the obstruction, the swift cargo-vessel had gained a distance that put her beyond all chance of being overhauled.  Infuriated by his failure, Kapitan Schwalbe went aft and descended into his cabin.  He was hardly conscious of the presence of his two involuntary guests as he passed.  He was thinking of the fate that had consigned him to a perilous and uncongenial task.  Without doubt the vessel he had been pursuing was equipped with wireless, and by this time a number of those dreaded hornets would be tearing towards the spot.  To add to his discomfiture it was reported to him that the reserve of fuel on board had seriously dwindled.  In order to remain effective it was necessary that U75 should replenish her tanks before another forty-eight hours had passed.  According to his customary tactics, Schwalbe ordered the submarine to dive to sixty feet.  At that depth she would be safe from any possibility of being rammed.  Provided she could avoid the under-water obstructions with which the British naval authorities had sown the bed of the sea at almost every point likely to be frequented by lurking hostile submarines, she was in no actual danger.  Gaining his diminutive cabin, Schwalbe by sheer force of habit consulted the aneroid.  The mercury was falling rapidly.  Since he last looked, barely two hours previously, it had dropped 764 to 734 millimetres, or an inch and two-tenths.  That meant that the anti-cyclone was rapidly breaking up, and that a severe gale was approaching with considerable swiftness.  U75 must submerge and seek shelter.  It was impossible for her to keep at a uniform depth unless she maintained steerage-way; that meant a great demand upon her storage batteries.  She could not remain on the bottom of the sea in a heavy gale, owing to the constant \"pumping\" or up-and-down movements caused by the varying pressure of passing waves, unless she sought a sheltered roadstead--and sheltered roadsteads were generally mined, or guarded by some ingenious device that had already accounted for several of U75's consorts.  Producing a chart of the Bristol Channel, Schwalbe unfolded and spread it upon a table.  Then, in conjunction with a translation of the latest British Admiralty guide to the west coast of England, he proceeded to select what he hoped would be a snug shelter during the coming storm.  \"Herr Rix!\" he shouted.  \"I'll make for this anchorage.  There's every indication of a strong blow from the nor'-east.\"  \"This\" was Helwick Channel, a deep, almost blind passage between the Glamorgan coast and an outlying submerged reef known as the East and West Helwick.  In fine weather it was a short cut for traders plying between Llanelly and Swansea.  In bad weather it was a place to be avoided, as far as sailing vessels were concerned.  Sheltered by the bold outlines of Worm's Head, it ought to prove an ideal lurking-place until the gale had blown itself out, for there was little danger of the place being used as an anchorage, since vessels preferred to give the rock-bound coast a wide berth.  On this account, it was also highly probable that the Helwick channel had not been safe-guarded by the British naval authorities.  Just before sunset, U75, having made the passage unobserved, brought up in twelve fathoms of water, resting evenly on the firm, hard sands at the bottom.  Ross and his chum turned in early.  There was nothing for them to do. They held aloof from the crew; there were no books to entertain them, no games to amuse them.  The submarine was now motionless, sufficient water ballast having been taken in to allow her to settle firmly upon the bottom; but, in order to be prepared, the anchor was let go.  Thus not the slightest movement of the hull was apparent.  The rest, after hours of erratic movement on the oily swell, was a welcome one.  The lads had set their joint watch by the submarine's time, which, being mid-European standard, was one hour fast of Greenwich.  For several hours they slept soundly and undisturbed."]]]
