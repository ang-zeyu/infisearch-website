I never went to the theatre but once, and the dancing was not half so pretty as this. What clever boys you must be!” said Rose, smiling upon her kinsmen like a little queen upon her subjects.  “Ah, we're a fine lot, and that is only the beginning of our larks. We haven't got the pipes here or we'd,      'Sing for you, play for you      A dulcy melody,'”  answered Charlie, looking much elated at her praise.  “I did not know we were Scotch; papa never said anything about it, or seemed to care about Scotland, except to have me sing the old ballads,”  said Rose, beginning to feel as if she had left America behind her somewhere.  “Neither did we till lately. We've been reading Scott's novels, and all of a sudden we remembered that our grandfather was a Scotchman. So we hunted up the old stories, got a bagpipe, put on our plaids, and went in, heart and soul, for the glory of the Clan. We've been at it some time now, and it's great fun. Our people like it, and I think we are a pretty canny set.”  Archie said this from the other coach-step, where he had perched, while the rest climbed up before and behind to join in the chat as they rested.  “I'm Fitzjames and he's Roderick Dhu, and we'll give you the broadsword combat some day. It's a great thing, you'd better believe,” added the Prince.  “Yes, and you should hear Steve play the pipes. He makes 'em skirl like a good one,” cried Will from the box, eager to air the accomplishments of his race.  “Mac's the fellow to hunt up the old stories and tell us how to dress right, and pick out rousing bits for us to speak and sing,” put in Geordie, saying a good word for the absent Worm.  “And what do you and Will do?” asked Rose of Jamie, who sat beside her as if bound to keep her in sight till the promised gift had been handed over.  “Oh, I'm the little foot-page, and do errands, and Will and Geordie are the troops when we march, and the stags when we hunt, and the traitors when we want to cut any heads off.”  “They are very obliging, I'm sure,” said Rose, whereat the “utility men”  beamed with modest pride and resolved to enact Wallace and Montrose as soon as possible for their cousin's special benefit.  “Let's have a game of tag,” cried the Prince, swinging himself up to a beam with a sounding slap on Stevie's shoulder.  Regardless of his gloves, Dandy tore after him, and the rest swarmed in every direction as if bent on breaking their necks and dislocating their joints as rapidly as possible.  It was a new and astonishing spectacle to Rose, fresh from a prim boarding-school, and she watched the active lads with breathless interest, thinking their antics far superior to those of Mops, the dear departed monkey.  Will had just covered himself with glory by pitching off a high loft head first and coming up all right, when Phebe appeared with a cloak, hood, and rubbers, also a message from Aunt Plenty that “Miss Rose was to come in directly.”  “All right; we'll bring her!” answered Archie, issuing some mysterious order, which was so promptly obeyed that, before Rose could get out of the carriage, the boys had caught hold of the pole and rattled her out of the barn, round the oval and up to the front door with a cheer that brought two caps to an upper window, and caused Debby to cry aloud from the back porch,  “Them harum-scarum boys will certainly be the death of that delicate little creter!”  But the “delicate little creter” seemed all the better for her trip, and ran up the steps looking rosy, gay, and dishevelled, to be received with lamentation by Aunt Plenty, who begged her to go and lie down at once.  “Oh, please don't! We have come to tea with our cousin, and we'll be as good as gold if you'll let us stay, auntie,” clamoured the boys, who not only approved of “our cousin” but had no mind to lose their tea, for Aunt Plenty's name but feebly expressed her bountiful nature.  “Well, dears, you can; only be quiet, and let Rose go and take her iron and be made tidy, and then we will see what we can find for supper,”  said the old lady as she trotted away, followed by a volley of directions for the approaching feast.  “Marmalade for me, auntie.”  “Plenty of plum-cake, please.”  “Tell Debby to trot out the baked pears.”  “I'm your man for lemon-pie, ma'am.”  “Do have fritters; Rose will like 'em.”  “She'd rather have tarts, I know.”  When Rose came down, fifteen minutes later, with every curl smoothed and her most beruffled apron on, she found the boys loafing about the long hall, and paused on the half-way landing to take an observation, for till now she had not really examined her new-found cousins.  There was a strong family resemblance among them, though some of the yellow heads were darker than others, some of the cheeks brown instead of rosy, and the ages varied all the way from sixteen-year-old Archie to Jamie, who was ten years younger. None of them were especially comely but the Prince, yet all were hearty, happy-looking lads, and Rose decided that boys were not as dreadful as she had expected to find them.  They were all so characteristically employed that she could not help smiling as she looked. Archie and Charlie, evidently great cronies, were pacing up and down, shoulder to shoulder, whistling “Bonnie Dundee”; Mac was reading in a corner, with his book close to his near-sighted eyes; Dandy was arranging his hair before the oval glass in the hat-stand; Geordie and Will investigating the internal economy of the moon-faced clock; and Jamie lay kicking up his heels on the mat at the foot of the stairs, bent on demanding his sweeties the instant Rose appeared.  She guessed his intention, and forestalled his demand by dropping a handful of sugar-plums down upon him.  At his cry of rapture the other lads looked up and smiled involuntarily, for the little kinswoman standing there above was a winsome sight with her shy, soft eyes, bright hair, and laughing face. The black frock reminded them of her loss, and filled the boyish hearts with a kindly desire to be good to “our cousin,” who had no longer any home but this.  “There she is, as fine as you please,” cried Steve, kissing his hand to her.  “Come on, Missy; tea is ready,” added the Prince encouragingly.  “I shall take her in.” And Archie offered his arm with great dignity, an honour that made Rose turn as red as a cherry and long to run upstairs again.  It was a merry supper, and the two elder boys added much to the fun by tormenting the rest with dark hints of some interesting event which was about to occur. Something uncommonly fine, they declared it was, but enveloped in the deepest mystery for the present.  “Did I ever see it?” asked Jamie.  “Not to remember it; but Mac and Steve have, and liked it immensely,”  answered Archie, thereby causing the two mentioned to neglect Debby's delectable fritters for several minutes, while they cudgelled their brains.  “Who will have it first?” asked Will, with his mouth full of marmalade.  “Aunt Plenty, I guess.”  “When will she have it?” demanded Geordie, bouncing in his seat with impatience.  “Sometime on Monday.”  “Heart alive! what is the boy talking about?” cried the old lady from behind the tall urn, which left little to be seen but the topmost bow of her cap.  “Doesn't auntie know?” asked a chorus of voices.  “No; and that's the best of the joke, for she is desperately fond of it.”  “What colour is it?” asked Rose, joining in the fun.  “Blue and brown.”  “Is it good to eat?” asked Jamie.  “Some people think so, but I shouldn't like to try it,” answered Charlie, laughing so he split his tea.  “Who does it belong to?” put in Steve.  Archie and the Prince stared at one another rather blankly for a minute, then Archie answered with a twinkle of the eye that made Charlie explode again,  “To Grandfather Campbell.”  This was a poser, and they gave up the puzzle, though Jamie confided to Rose that he did not think he could live till Monday without knowing what this remarkable thing was.  Soon after tea the Clan departed, singing “All the blue bonnets are over the border,” at the tops of their voices.  “Well, dear, how do you like your cousins?” asked Aunt Plenty, as the last pony frisked round the corner and the din died away.  “Pretty well, ma'am; but I like Phebe better.” An answer which caused Aunt Plenty to hold up her hands in despair and trot away to tell sister Peace that she never should understand that child, and it was a mercy Alec was coming soon to take the responsibility off their hands.  Fatigued by the unusual exertions of the afternoon, Rose curled herself up in the sofa corner to rest and think about the great mystery, little guessing that she was to know it first of all.  Right in the middle of her meditations she fell asleep and dreamed she was at home again in her own little bed. She seemed to wake and see her father bending over her; to hear him say, “My little Rose”; to answer, “Yes, papa”; and then to feel him take her in his arms and kiss her tenderly. So sweet, so real was the dream, that she started up with a cry of joy to find herself in the arms of a brown, bearded man, who held her close, and whispered in a voice so like her father's that she clung to him involuntarily,  “This is my little girl, and I am Uncle Alec.”    Chapter 3--Uncles  When Rose woke next morning, she was not sure whether she had dreamed what occurred the night before, or it had actually happened. So she hopped up and dressed, although it was an hour earlier than she usually rose, for she could not sleep any more, being possessed with a strong desire to slip down and see if the big portmanteau and packing cases were really in the hall. She seemed to remember tumbling over them when she went to bed, for"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2726"],["title","Eight Cousins (#3)"],["body","aunts had sent her off very punctually, because they wanted their pet nephew all to themselves.  The sun was shining, and Rose opened her window to let in the soft May air fresh from the sea. As she leaned over her little balcony, watching an early bird get the worm, and wondering how she should like Uncle Alec, she saw a man leap the garden wall and come whistling up the path. At first she thought it was some trespasser, but a second look showed her that it was her uncle returning from an early dip into the sea. She had hardly dared to look at him the night before, because whenever she tried to do so she always found a pair of keen blue eyes looking at her. Now she could take a good stare at him as he lingered along, looking about him as if glad to see the old place again.  A brown, breezy man, in a blue jacket, with no hat on the curly head, which he shook now and then like a water dog; broad-shouldered, alert in his motions, and with a general air of strength and stability about him which pleased Rose, though she could not explain the feeling of comfort it gave her. She had just said to herself, with a sense of relief, “I guess I shall like him, though he looks as if he made people mind,” when he lifted his eyes to examine the budding horse-chestnut overhead, and saw the eager face peering down at him. He waved his hand to her, nodded, and called out in a bluff, cheery voice,  “You are on deck early, little niece.”  “I got up to see if you had really come, uncle.”  “Did you? Well, come down here and make sure of it.”  “I'm not allowed to go out before breakfast, sir.”  “Oh, indeed!” with a shrug. “Then I'll come aboard and salute,” he added; and, to Rose's great amazement, Uncle Alec went up one of the pillars of the back piazza hand over hand, stepped across the roof, and swung himself into her balcony, saying, as he landed on the wide balustrade: “Have you any doubts about me now, ma'am?”  Rose was so taken aback, she could only answer with a smile as she went to meet him.  “How does my girl do this morning?” he asked, taking the little cold hand she gave him in both his big warm ones.  “Pretty well, thank you, sir.”  “Ah, but it should be very well. Why isn't it?”  “I always wake up with a headache, and feel tired.”  “Don't you sleep well?”  “I lie awake a long time, and then I dream, and my sleep does not seem to rest me much.”  “What do you do all day?”  “Oh, I read, and sew a little, and take naps, and sit with auntie.”  “No running about out of doors, or house-work, or riding, hey?”  “Aunt Plenty says I'm not strong enough for much exercise. I drive out with her sometimes, but I don't care for it.”  “I'm not surprised at that,” said Uncle Alec, half to himself, adding, in his quick way: “Who have you had to play with?”  “No one but Ariadne Blish, and she was such a goose I couldn't bear her. The boys came yesterday, and seemed rather nice; but, of course, I couldn't play with them.”  “Why not?”  “I'm too old to play with boys.”  “Not a bit of it; that's just what you need, for you've been molly-coddled too much. They are good lads, and you'll be mixed up with them more or less for years to come, so you may as well be friends and playmates at once. I will look you up some girls also, if I can find a sensible one who is not spoilt by her nonsensical education.”  “Phebe is sensible, I'm sure, and I like her, though I only saw her yesterday,” cried Rose, waking up suddenly.  “And who is Phebe, if you please?”  Rose eagerly told all she knew, and Uncle Alec listened, with an odd smile lurking about his mouth, though his eyes were quite sober as he watched the face before him.  “I'm glad to see that you are not aristocratic in your tastes, but I don't quite make out why you like this young lady from the poor-house.”  “You may laugh at me, but I do. I can't tell why, only she seems so happy and busy, and sings so beautifully, and is strong enough to scrub and sweep, and hasn't any troubles to plague her,” said Rose, making a funny jumble of reasons in her efforts to explain.  “How do you know that?”  “Oh, I was telling her about mine, and asked if she had any, and she said, 'No, only I'd like to go to school, and I mean to some day.”  “So she doesn't call desertion, poverty, and hard work, troubles? She's a brave little girl, and I shall be proud to know her.” And Uncle Alec gave an approving nod, that made Rose wish she had been the one to earn it.  “But what are these troubles of yours, child?” he asked, after a minute of silence.  “Please don't ask me, uncle.”  “Can't you tell them to me as well as to Phebe?”  Something in his tone made Rose feel that it would be better to speak out and be done with it, so she answered, with sudden colour and averted eyes,  “The greatest one was losing dear papa.”  As she said that, Uncle Alec's arm came gently round her, and he drew her to him, saying, in the voice so like papa's,  “That is a trouble which I cannot cure, my child; but I shall try to make you feel it less. What else, dear?”  “I am so tired and poorly all the time, I can't do anything I want to, and it makes me cross,” sighed Rose, rubbing the aching head like a fretful child.  “That we can cure and we will,” said her uncle, with a decided nod that made the curls bob on his head, to that Rose saw the gray ones underneath the brown.  “Aunt Myra says I have no constitution, and never shall be strong,”  observed Rose, in a pensive tone, as if it was rather a nice thing to be an invalid.  “Aunt Myra is a ahem! an excellent woman, but it is her hobby to believe that everyone is tottering on the brink of the grave; and, upon my life, I believe she is offended if people don't fall into it! We will show her how to make constitutions and turn pale-faced little ghosts into rosy, hearty girls. That's my business, you know,” he added, more quietly, for his sudden outburst had rather startled Rose.  “I had forgotten you were a doctor. I'm glad of it, for I do want to be well, only I hope you won't give me much medicine, for I've taken quarts already, and it does me no good.”  As she spoke, Rose pointed to a little table just inside the window, on which appeared a regiment of bottles.  “Ah, ha! Now we'll see what mischief these blessed women have been at.”  And, making a long arm, Dr. Alec set the bottles on the wide railing before him, examined each carefully, smiled over some, frowned over others, and said, as he put down the last: “Now I'll show you the best way to take these messes.” And, as quick as a flash, he sent one after another smashing down into the posy-beds below.  “But Aunt Plenty won't like it; and Aunt Myra will be angry, for she sent most of them!” cried Rose, half frightened and half pleased at such energetic measures.  “You are my patient now, and I'll take the responsibility. My way of giving physic is evidently the best, for you look better already,” he said, laughing so infectiously that Rose followed suit, saying saucily,  “If I don't like your medicines any better than those, I shall throw them into the garden, and then what will you do?”  “When I prescribe such rubbish, I'll give you leave to pitch it overboard as soon as you like. Now what is the next trouble?”  “I hoped you would forget to ask.”  “But how can I help you if I don't know them? Come, let us have No. 3.”  “It is very wrong, I suppose, but I do sometimes wish I had not quite so many aunts. They are all very good to me, and I want to please them; but they are so different, I feel sort of pulled to pieces among them,” said Rose, trying to express the emotions of a stray chicken with six hens all clucking over it at once.  Uncle Alec threw back his head and laughed like a boy, for he could entirely understand how the good ladies had each put in her oar and tried to paddle her own way, to the great disturbance of the waters and the entire bewilderment of poor Rose.  “I intend to try a course of uncles now, and see how that suits your constitution. I'm going to have you all to myself, and no one is to give a word of advice unless I ask it. There is no other way to keep order aboard, and I am captain of this little craft, for a time at least. What comes next?”  But Rose stuck there, and grew so red, her uncle guessed what that trouble was.  “I don't think I can tell this one. It wouldn't be polite, and I feel pretty sure that it isn't going to be a trouble any more.”  As she blushed and stammered over these words, Dr. Alec turned his eyes away to the distant sea, and said so seriously, so tenderly, that she felt every word and long remembered them,  “My child, I don't expect you to love and trust me all at once, but I do want you to believe that I shall give my whole heart to this new duty; and if I make mistakes, as I probably shall, no one will grieve over them more bitterly than I. It is my fault that I am a stranger to you, when I want to be your best friend. That is one of my mistakes, and I never repented it more deeply than I do now. Your father and I had a trouble once, and I thought I could never forgive him; so I kept away for years. Thank God, we made it all up the last time I saw him, and he told me then, that if he was forced to leave her he should bequeath his little girl to me as a token of his love. I can't fill his place, but I shall try to be a father to her; and if she learns to love me half as well as she did the good one she has lost, I shall be a proud and happy man. Will she believe this and try?”  Something in Uncle Alec's face touched Rose to the heart, and when he held out his hand with that anxious troubled look in his eyes, she was moved to put up her innocent lips and seal the contract with a confiding kiss. The strong arm held her close a minute, and she felt the broad chest heave once as if with a great sigh of relief; but not a word was spoken till a tap at the door made both start.  Rose popped her head through the window to say “come in,” while Dr. Alec hastily rubbed the sleeve of his jacket"]]]
