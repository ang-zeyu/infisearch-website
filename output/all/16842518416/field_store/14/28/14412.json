When I walked in the Row, where a few horsemen were performing as harbingers of spring, I criticised their riding, which I thought indifferent, as they neglected nearly all the rules. I began to anticipate a day when I should exhibit a purer and more classic style of equestrianism. And one morning I saw Diana, who pulled up her dancing mare to ask me if I had remembered her advice, and I felt proudly able to reply that I should certainly make my appearance in the Row before very long.  From that day I was perpetually questioning my riding-master as to when he considered I should be ripe enough for Rotten Row. He was dubious, but not actually dissuasive. 'It's like this, you see, sir,' he explained, 'if you get hold of a quiet, steady horse--why, you won't come to no harm; but if you go out on an animal that will take advantage of you, Mr. Pulvertoft, why, you'll be all no-how on him, sir.'  They would have mounted me at the school; but I knew most of the stud there, and none of them quite came up to my ideal of a 'quiet, steady horse;' so I went to a neighbouring job-master, from whom I had occasionally hired a brougham, and asked to be shown an animal he could recommend to one who had not had much practice lately. He admitted candidly enough that most of his horses 'took a deal of riding,' but added that it so happened that he had one just then which would suit me 'down to the ground'--a phrase which grated unpleasantly on my nerves, though I consented to see the horse. His aspect impressed me most favourably. He was a chestnut of noble proportions, with a hogged mane; but what reassured me was the expression of his eye, indicating as it did a self-respect and sagacity which one would hardly expect for seven and sixpence an hour.  'You won't get a showier Park 'ack than what he is, not to be so quiet,' said his owner. 'He's what you may call a kind 'oss, and as gentle--you could ride him on a packthread.'  I considered reins safer, but I was powerfully drawn towards the horse: he seemed to me to be sensible that he had a character to lose, and to possess too high an intelligence wilfully to forfeit his testimonials. With hardly a second thought, I engaged him for the following afternoon.  I mounted at the stables, with just a passing qualm, perhaps, while my stirrup-leathers were being adjusted, and a little awkwardness in taking up my reins, which were more twisted than I could have wished; however, at length, I found myself embarked on the stream of traffic on the back of the chestnut--whose name, by the way, was Brutus.  Shall I ever forget the pride and ecstasy of finding that I had my steed under perfect control, that we threaded the maze of carriages with absolute security? I turned him into the Park, and clucked my tongue: he broke into a canter, and how shall I describe my delight at the discovery that it was not uncomfortable? I said 'Woa,' and he stopped, so gradually that my equilibrium was not seriously disturbed; he trotted, and still I accommodated myself to his movements without any positive inconvenience. I could have embraced him for gratitude: never before had I been upon a beast whose paces were so easy, whose behaviour was so considerate. I could ride at last! or, which amounted to the same thing, I could ride the horse I was on, and I would 'use no other.' I was about to meet Diana Chetwynd, and need not fear even to encounter her critical eyes.  We had crossed the Serpentine bridge, and were just turning in upon the Ride, when--and here I am only too conscious that what I am about to say may strike you as almost incredible--when I heard an unfamiliar voice addressing me with, 'I say--you!' and the moment afterwards realised that it proceeded from my own horse!  I am not ashamed to own that I was as nearly off as possible; for a more practised rider than I could pretend to be might have a difficulty in preserving his equanimity in this all but unparalleled situation. I was too much engaged in feeling for my left stirrup to make any reply, and presently the horse spoke once more. 'I say,' he inquired, and I failed to discern the slightest trace of respect in his tone--'do you think you can ride?' You can judge for yourself how disconcerting the inquiry must have been from such lips: I felt rooted to the saddle--a sensation which, with me, was sufficiently rare. I looked round in helpless bewilderment, at the shimmering Serpentine, and the white houses in Park Lane gleaming out of a lilac haze, at the cocoa-coloured Row, and the flash of distant carriage-wheels in the sunlight: all looked as usual--and yet, there was I on the back of a horse which had just inquired 'whether I thought I could ride'!  'I have had two dozen lessons at a riding-school,' I said at last, with rather a flabby dignity.  'I should hardly have suspected it,' was his brutal retort. 'You are evidently one of the hopeless cases.'  I was deeply hurt, the more so because I could not deny that he had some claim to be a judge. 'I--I thought we were getting on so nicely together,' I faltered, and all he said in reply to that was, '_Did_ you?'  'Do you know,' I began, striving to be conversational, 'I never was on a horse that talked before.'  'You are enough to make any horse talk,' he answered; 'but I suppose I _am_ an exception.'  'I think you must be,' said I. 'The only horses I ever heard of as possessing the gift of speech were the Houyhnhnms.'  'How do you know I am not one of them?' he replied.  'If you are, you will understand that I took the liberty of mounting you under a very pardonable mistake; and if you will have the goodness to stand still, I will no longer detain you.'  'Not so fast,' said he: 'I want to know something more about you first. I should say now you were a man with plenty of oats.'  'I am--well off,' I said. How I wished I was!  'I have long been looking out for a proprietor who would not overwork me: now, of course, I don't know, but you scarcely strike me as a _hard_ rider.'  'I do not think I could be fairly accused of that,' I answered, with all the consciousness of innocence.  'Just so--then buy me.'  'No,' I gasped: 'after the extremely candid opinion you were good enough to express of my riding, I'm surprised that you should even suggest such a thing.'  'Oh, I will put up with that--you will suit me well enough, I dare say.'  'You must excuse me. I prefer to keep my spare cash for worthier objects; and, with your permission, I will spend the remainder of the afternoon on foot.'  'You will do nothing of the sort,' said he.  'If you won't stop, and let me get off properly,' I said with firmness, 'I shall _roll_ off.' There were some promenaders within easy hail; but how was I to word a call for help, how explain such a dilemma as mine?  'You will only reduce me to the painful necessity of rolling on you,' he replied. 'You must see that you are to a certain extent in my power. Suppose it occurred to me to leap those rails and take you into the Serpentine, or to run away and upset a mounted policeman with you--do you think you could offer much opposition?'  I could not honestly assert that I did. 'You were introduced to me,' I said reproachfully, 'as a _kind_ horse!'  'And so I am--apart from matters of business. Come, will you buy, or be bolted with? I hate indecision!'  'Buy!' I said, with commercial promptness. 'If you will take me back, I will arrange about it at once.'  It is needless to say that my one idea was to get safely off his back: after which, neither honour nor law could require me to execute a contract extorted from me by threats. But, as we were going down the mews, he said reflectively, 'I've been thinking--it will be better for all parties, if you make your offer to my proprietor _before_ you dismount.' I was too vexed to speak: this animal's infernal intelligence had foreseen my manoeuvre--he meant to foil it, if he could.  And then we clattered in under the glass-roofed yard of the livery stables; and the job-master, who was alone there, cast his eyes up at the sickly-faced clock, as if he were comparing its pallor with my own. 'Why, you _are_ home early, sir,' he said. 'You didn't find the 'orse too much for you, did you?' He said this without any suspicion of the real truth; and, indeed, I may say, once for all, that this weird horse--Houyhnhnm, or whatever else he might be--admitted no one but myself into the secret of his marvellous gifts, and in all his conversations with me, managed (though how, I cannot pretend to say) to avoid being overheard.  'Oh, dear no,' I protested, 'he carried me admirably--admirably!' and I made an attempt to slip off.  No such thing: Brutus instantly jogged my memory, and me, by the slightest suggestion of a 'buck.'  'He's a grand 'orse, sir, isn't he?' said the job-master complacently.  'M--magnificent!' I agreed, with a jerk. 'Will you go to his head, please?'  But the horse backed into the centre of the yard, where he plunged with a quiet obstinacy. 'I like him so much,' I called out, as I clung to the saddle, 'that I want to know if you're at all inclined to part with him?' Here Brutus became calm and attentive.  'Would you be inclined to make me a orfer for him, sir?'  'Yes,' I said faintly. 'About how much would he be?'  'You step into my orfice here, sir,' said he, 'and we'll talk it over.'  I should have been only too willing, for there was no room there for the horse, but the suspicious animal would not hear of it: he began to revolve immediately.  'Let us settle it now--here,' I said, 'I can't wait.'  The job-master stroked away a grin. No doubt there _was_ something unbusinesslike and unpractical in such precipitation, especially as combined with my appearance at the time.  'Well, you _'ave_ took a voilent fancy to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27284"],["title","The Talking Horse, and Other Tales (#2)"],["body","'orse and no mistake, sir,' he remarked.  'I never crossed a handsomer creature,' I said; which was hardly a prudent remark for an intending purchaser, but then, there was the animal himself to be conciliated.  'I don't know, really, as I can do without him just at this time of year,' said the man. 'I'm under-'orsed as it is for the work I've got to do.'  A sweet relief stole over me: I had done all that could be expected of me. 'I'm very sorry to hear that,' I said, preparing to dismount. 'That _is_ a disappointment; but if you can't there's an end of it.'  'Don't you be afraid,' said Brutus, '_he'll_ sell me readily enough: make him an offer, quick!'  'I'll give you thirty guineas for him, come!' I said, knowing well enough that he would not take twice the money.  'I thought a gentleman like you would have had more insight into the value of a 'orse,' he said: 'why, his action alone is worth that, sir.'  'You couldn't let me have the action without the horse, I suppose?' I said, and I must have intended some joke.  It is unnecessary to prolong a painful scene. Brutus ran me up steadily from sum to sum, until his owner said at last: 'Well, we won't 'aggle, sir, call it a hundred.'  I had to call it a hundred, and what is more, it _was_ a hundred. I took him without a warranty, without even a veterinary opinion. I could have been induced to take my purchase away then and there, as if I had been buying a canary, so unaccustomed was I to transactions of this kind, and I am afraid the job-master considered me little better than a fool.  So I found myself the involuntary possessor of a Houyhnhnm, or something even worse, and I walked back to my rooms in Park Street in a state of stupor. What was I to do with him? To ride an animal so brutally plainspoken would be a continual penance; and yet, I should have to keep him, for I knew he was cunning enough to outwit any attempt to dispose of him. And to this, Love and Ambition had led me! I could not, after all I had said, approach Diana with any confidence as a mere pedestrian: the fact that I was in possession of a healthy horse which I never rode, would be sure to leak out in time, and how was I to account for it? I could see no way, and I groaned under an embarrassment which I dared not confide to the friendliest ear. I hated the monster that had saddled himself upon me, and looked in vain for any mode of escape.  I had to provide Brutus with stabling in another part of the town, for he proved exceedingly difficult to please: he found fault with everything, and I only wonder he did not demand that his stable should be fitted up with blue china and mezzotints. In his new quarters I left him for some days to his own devices: a course which I was glad to find, on visiting him again, had considerably reduced his arrogance. He wanted to go in the Row and see the other horses, and it did not at all meet his views to be exercised there by a stableman at unfashionable hours. So he proposed a compromise. If I would only consent to mount him, he engaged to treat me with forbearance, and pointed out that he could give me, as he expressed it, various 'tips' which would improve my seat. I was not blind to the advantages of such an arrangement. It is not every one who secures a riding-master in the person of his own horse; the horse is essentially a generous animal, and I felt that I might trust to Brutus's honour. And to do him justice, he observed the compact with strict good faith. Some of his 'tips,' it is true, very nearly tipped me off, but their result was to bring us closer together; our relations were less strained; it seemed to me that I gained more mastery over him every day, and was less stiff afterwards.  But I was not allowed to enjoy this illusion long. One day when I innocently asked him if he found my hands improving, he turned upon me his off sardonic eye. 'You'll _never_ improve, old sack-of-beans' (for he had come to address me with a freedom I burned to resent); 'hands! why, you're sawing my mouth off all the time. And your feet \"home,\" and tickling me under my shoulders at every stride--why, I'm half ashamed to be seen about with you.'  I was deeply hurt. 'I will spare you for the future,' I said coldly; 'this is my last appearance.'  'Nonsense,' he said, 'you needn't show temper over it. Surely, if I can put up with it, _you_ can! But we will make a new compact.' (I never knew such a beast as he was for bargains!) 'You only worry me by interfering with the reins. Let 'em out, and leave everything to me. Just mention from time to time where you want to go, and I'll attend to it,--if I've nothing better to do.'  I felt that such an understanding was destructive of all dignity, subverting, as it did, the natural relations between horse and rider; but I had hardly any self-respect left, and I consented, since I saw no way of refusing. And on the whole, I cannot say, even now, that I had any grave reason for finding fault with the use Brutus made of my concessions; he showed more tact than I could have expected in disguising the merely nominal nature of my authority.  I had only one serious complaint against him, which was that he had a habit of breaking suddenly away, with a merely formal apology, to exchange equine civilities with some cob or mare, to whose owner I was a perfect stranger, thus driving me to invent the most desperate excuses to cover my seeming intrusion: but I managed to account for it in various ways, and even made a few acquaintances in this irregular and involuntary manner. I could have wished he had been a less susceptible animal, for, though his flirtations were merely Platonic, it is rather humiliating to have to play 'gooseberry' to one's own horse--a part which I was constantly being called upon to perform!  As it happened, Diana was away in Paris that Easter, and we had not met since my appearance in the Row; but I knew she would be in town again shortly, and with consummate diplomacy I began to excite Brutus's curiosity by sundry careless, half-slighting allusions to Miss Chetwynd's little mare, Wild Rose. 'She's too frisky for my taste,' I said, 'but she's been a good deal admired, though I dare say you wouldn't be particularly struck by her.'  So that, on the first afternoon of Diana's return to the Row, I found it easy, under cover of giving Brutus an opportunity of forming an opinion, to prevail on him to carry me to her side. Diana, who was with a certain Lady Verney, her chaperon, welcomed me with a charming smile.  'I had no idea you could ride so well,' she said, 'you manage that beautiful horse of yours so very easily--with such light hands, too.'  This was not irony, for I could now give my whole mind to my seat; and, as I never interfered at all with the steering apparatus, my hands must have seemed the perfection of lightness.  'He wants delicate handling,' I answered carelessly, 'but he goes very well with _me_.'  'I wish you would let me try his paces some morning, Pulvertoft,' struck in a Colonel Cockshott, who was riding with them, and whom I knew slightly: 'I've a notion he would go better on the curb.'  'I shall be very happy,' I began, when, just in time, I noticed a warning depression in Brutus's ears. The Colonel rode about sixteen stone, and with spurs! 'I mean,' I added hastily, 'I should have been--only, to tell you the truth, I couldn't conscientiously trust any one on him but myself.'  'My dear fellow!' said the Colonel, who I could see was offended, 'I've not met many horses in my time that I couldn't get upon terms with.'  'I think Mr. Pulvertoft is _quite_ right,' said Diana. 'When a horse gets accustomed to one he does so resent a strange hand: it spoils his temper for days. I never will lend Wild Rose to anybody for that very reason!'  The Colonel fell back in the rear in a decided sulk. 'Poor dear Colonel Cockshott!' said Diana, 'he is so proud of his riding, but _I_ think he dragoons a horse. I don't call that _riding_, do you?'  'Well--hardly,' I agreed, with easy disparagement. 'I never believe in ruling a horse by fear.'  'I suppose you are very fond of yours?' she said.  'Fond is not the word!' I exclaimed--and it certainly was not.  'I am not sure that what I said about lending Wild Rose would apply to _you_,' she said. 'I think you would be gentle with her.'  I was certain that I should treat her with all consideration; but as I doubted whether she would wholly reciprocate it, I said with much presence of mind, that I should regard riding her as akin to profanation.  As Brutus and I were going home, he observed that it was a good thing I had not agreed to lend him to the Colonel.  'Yes,' I said, determined to improve the occasion, 'you might not have found him as considerate as--well, as some people!'  'I meant it was a good thing for _you_!' he hinted darkly, and I did not care to ask for an explanation. 'What did you mean,' he resumed, 'by saying that I should not admire Wild Rose? Why, she is charming--charming!'  'In that case,' I said, 'I don't mind riding with her mistress occasionally--to oblige you.'  'You don't mind!' he said; 'you will _have_ to, my boy,--and every afternoon!'  I suppressed a chuckle: after all, man _is_ the nobler animal. I could manage a horse--in my own way. My little _ruse_ had succeeded: I should have no more forced introductions to mystified strangers.  And now for some weeks my life passed in a happy dream. I only lived for those hours in the Row, where Brutus turned as naturally to Wild Rose as the sunflower to the sun, and Diana and I grew more intimate every day. Happiness and security made me almost witty. I was merciless in my raillery of the eccentric exhibitions of horsemanship which were to be met with, and Diana was provoked by my comments to the sweetest silvery laughter. As for Colonel Cockshott, whom I had once suspected of a desire to be my rival, he had long become a 'negligible quantity;' and if I delayed in asking Diana to trust me with her "]]]
