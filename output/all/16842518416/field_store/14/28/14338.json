In particular, we believe that some effective measures could be devised to control the distribution of that type of contraceptive which is mainly used in these circumstances.  We recommend the consideration of the licensing of the importation of certain contraceptive goods.  We urge that the sale or distribution of contraceptives should be restricted entirely to registered practising chemists, doctors, hospital departments or clinics, and that their sale by other persons should be illegal and subject to severe penalty.  Evidence placed before the Committee showed that, a profit up to 300 per cent. was being made on contraceptive appliances.  We recommend that the restriction on the advertisement of contraceptives should be more rigidly enforced, and particularly that the promiscuous advertisement and sale of contraceptives by \"mail order\" agencies should be made illegal.  We recommend that it should be made unlawful to supply contraceptives to young persons.  Difficulties and possibilities of evasion are of course obvious, but, nevertheless, similar restrictions have been applied with at least some measure of success in other directions.  We would also appeal to the Pharmaceutical Society and to the individual chemists, since the responsibility rests so largely with them, to co-operate most earnestly in this matter.  With regard to abortifacients, the recommendations we later make apply with even greater force to unmarried women.  Several witnesses, speaking on behalf of women's organizations, advocated the introduction of women police for the guidance and protection of the young in places of public resort.  Reference to the effect of alcohol on moral restraint has already been made.  The second big consideration is the care of the unmarried woman who is in trouble.  It has been suggested that if there were a more tolerant attitude towards such girls many who now resort to abortion would be prepared to go forward and face the future.  As one witness stated:--      \"She should be treated with the greatest tenderness. Usually she is     more sinned against than sinning; but she carries all the blame     which belongs not only to the man but also to society, which has     been guilty of supine acquiescence in the surrender of standards of     moral conduct.      \"She has to give birth to a child which has the rights of every     unborn infant; and she has to re-establish herself in the     community.... It is terribly difficult for them afterwards with the     child, and they need all the help they can get. It seems to me that     some of them must go in sheer dread to the abortionist. My definite     opinion is that something more needs to be done.\"  In all fairness to the many fine organizations which are helping these girls, the Committee is satisfied that there is no lack of tolerance, sympathy, and helpfulness with them.  If fault there is, it is in the attitude of the general public to this matter.  Some criticism has been directed at the St. Helens Hospitals because they are not freely open to unmarried women, but it is only right that the position should be made clear.  The actual position is that, in the majority of cases, the St. Helens Hospitals, which can only offer accommodation to an expectant mother for the period of her confinement, are _not suitable_ for dealing with single women, who require protection and care before and after their confinements as well.  There are, throughout the country, many admirable institutions which are equipped to give this service.  Discussion before this Committee has, however, made it clear that where an unmarried mother can make adequate private arrangements for the care of herself and her infant after confinement, the St. Helens Hospitals are prepared to take her for the actual confinement period.  In regard to the maternity homes which deal with unmarried women, there has also been some criticism of the usual regulations in these homes which call for a period of residence in the home both before and, especially, after confinement.  It should be pointed out, however, that this is a wise and humane provision, entirely in the interests of the mothers and their babies; it ensures for the mother that very period of convalescence which other witnesses have so strongly advocated under other circumstances, it gives the baby protection in the most difficult early months, and it allows the helpers in the home an opportunity to make provision for the baby's future.  Here, again, where the mother is able to make adequate provision for herself and her infant, these regulations are certainly relaxed in some of the homes concerned, and we would commend this practice in suitable cases to those responsible for the management of all these homes.  Regarding the obstetrical care given to the unmarried mothers in these homes, the evidence given indicates clearly that it is of a standard equal to that in our other maternity hospitals.  Indeed, whereas the risks of childbirth amongst unmarried mothers the world over is notoriously high, amongst the women who place themselves in the care of these homes in New Zealand the maternal mortality and the infant mortality are both exceedingly low.  In the homes of which the members of the Committee have personal knowledge the same ante-natal care (indeed, since these patients are resident in the home and under close observation, more complete care) is given and the same methods of pain relief are used.  It is only right that these reassuring facts should be made public.  Regarding the provision for the children in these cases, while we are satisfied that the State and the various organisations responsible for their care deal with them in a kindly and sympathetic manner, we agree that every effort should be made to give them a fair prospect in life, to avoid any stigma, and to keep secret their misfortune.  It has been suggested by one witness that the privacy of an unmarried mother's affairs has been interfered with the present regulations regarding the notification of births. Under the Child Welfare Act as it at present operates there is a duty on the Registrar to inform the Child Welfare Department of every birth, and the register is also open to the Plunket Society for purposes of following up.  Good as the intention of these provisions is in the interests of the babies, the assertion has been made that in certain cases the knowledge of this lack of secrecy has deterred women from allowing their pregnancies to continue, and has constrained them to seek abortion.  The Committee is not prepared to comment on this complaint, but would suggest that it be investigated, and that, if there is any justification in it, the regulations be amended so that, while fully protecting the child, full secrecy is maintained.   (4) TO MEET CHANGES IN SOCIAL OUTLOOK.  The Committee has concluded that, beyond the economic and domestic considerations already discussed, there are many changes in modern social outlook which are operating in the direction of family limitation, and which, in many cases, lead to the practice of abortion.  Can anything be done to prevent the occurrence of abortion resulting from these tendencies in modern life?  Concerning birth-control the realities of the position must be faced. There can be no doubt that there is a widespread uncontrolled and ill-instructed use of contraceptives.  As one witness put it, \"New Zealand is saturated with birth-control.\"  Owing to this extensive half-knowledge there is in many cases an entirely unwarranted dependence on their reliability to the exclusion of any measure of self-discipline whatever.  The Committee is under no illusion in this matter.  With this attitude prevailing in the community and provided with such a weapon--even though it is likely to explode in their own hands--women will continue to limit their families. No social legislation, however generous, will prevent it, nor, as far as the Committee can see, will legal prohibitions do much to restrict it.  Two lines of action are suggested:--      (1) To direct the knowledge of birth-control through more     responsible channels, where, while the methods advised would be     more reliable, the responsibilities and privileges of motherhood,     the advisability of self-discipline in certain directions, and     other aspects of the question could be discussed.  It is this view which has led the Committee to the recommendations it has made in the discussion of birth-control.      (2) To appeal to the womanhood of New Zealand in so far as selfish     and unworthy motives have entered into our family life, to consider     the grave physical and moral dangers, not to speak of the dangers     of race suicide which are involved.  We can but urge all those who have to do with the education of our youth and the moulding of women's opinion to give these matters earnest consideration, and the Committee is of the opinion that it is necessary to develop the education of young people in biology and physiology in our primary and secondary schools as a foundation for a more rational and wholesome outlook on sex matters.   (5) CONTRACEPTION.  The practice of contraception is a debatable question, and one on which the most varied evidence has been given.  Witnesses opposed this practice, some on moral grounds, some with the plea for a greater natural increase in the population of New Zealand.  Others again, particularly the representatives of women's organizations, advocated the establishment of clinics for the general instruction of married women in the practice of reliable methods of contraception. They expressed the opinion, and some of them supported their opinions with sound argument and overseas experience, that the instruction of the mothers of New Zealand in the practice of child-spacing rather than resulting in a diminution of the birth-rate might well cause an increase in the size of many families, for, in addition to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27070"],["title","Report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Various Aspects of the Problem of (#6)"],["body","mothers to plan their families, such clinics also specialize in propaganda calculated to awaken women to an appreciation of the privileges and responsibilities of motherhood.  The Committee agrees that the possession of reliable contraceptive knowledge by the married women of New Zealand would tend to augment rather than to diminish further the natural rate of increase of our population, for an additional factor to those given above lies in the large amount of sterility which follows induced abortion, that most unsatisfactory of all forms of birth-control.  The evidence laid before the Committee shows that in New Zealand every year thousands of women imperil, and indeed negate, their future prospects of motherhood by submitting to the induction of abortion.  It has been shown that abortion is a delayed, dangerous, and unsatisfactory form of birth-control, and it can quite logically be argued that if a reliable and simple method of contraception was known to all married people the abortion problem would assume very small proportions.  This is, to a large extent, true, but it must not be forgotten that both abortion and contraception have various aspects, and that apart from other objections there are practical difficulties which are not easily surmounted. There is no known contraceptive which is simple, inexpensive, and 100 per cent. reliable for the thoughtless, the careless, and the stupid.  Contraception may be considered under three headings:--      (1) The practice of contraception extramaritially, which only needs     to be mentioned to be deprecated.      (2) The practice of contraception by married people irrespective of     their circumstances.  Evidence was given by responsible and representative women in support of a mother's right to say when she will bear her children, and although we agree that this privilege might well be conceded her, we are of the opinion that it is not the function of the State to undertake the dissemination of the knowledge and give the practical instruction necessary to enable the general adoption of this principle.  This general instruction can well be left to the medical profession, who should also undertake the responsibility of impressing the privileges of motherhood upon young women seeking such advice.  In recommending that such general instruction should be left to the medical practitioners, we are cognizant of the fact that many members of that profession are at a loss to know what methods of contraception can be reliably recommended to lay persons.  A sub-committee of the Obstetrical Society, consisting of members who have made a special study of this problem, has been set up, and the presentation of their report will doubtless clarify the position in the minds of the medical profession.      (3) The practice of contraception by married women who, in the     opinion of their medical attendant, should have temporary or     permanent freedom from the fact or fear of pregnancy.  Not only are there cases in which severe illness exists making further pregnancies dangerous, but there is also a heterogenous group including all gradations of health and economic reasons.  Here we have the mother with health undermined and reserve vitality reduced to a minimum by the strain of bearing and rearing a large family. She approaches the menopausal stresses with anxiety and apprehension, having done her duty to family and race, often having lived an exemplary self-sacrificing life, the intolerable contemplation of a late pregnancy drives her to desperate measures often for the first time in her life.  Again, there is the relatively young, tired, anæmic, debilitated mother, with a number of young children born at very close intervals, often denied even a half-holiday, let alone an adequate one, unable to afford suitable domestic assistance, often with poor housing or domestic arrangements, and completely exhausted with the incessant round of cleaning, cooking, and the strain of the inevitable fretfulness of a number of young children.  The Committee is of the opinion that it is the State's duty to ensure that mothers within this group should obtain the respite that the health of themselves and their present and future families demands.  The economic aspects of these problems are dealt with in our general recommendations, but we also recommend that departments should be established, preferably in conjunction with the out-patients' departments of our public hospitals, whither medical practitioners could refer for instruction and equipment with contraceptive appliances mothers who in their opinion should be assured of temporary or permanent freedom from child-bearing.  It might be desirable that the certifying doctor's recommendation should be endorsed by the officer in charge of the department before admission, but that is a practical point which could be discussed at a later date with members of the Obstetrical Society and medical profession.  Though the Committee discounts the exaggerated statements that have been made at intervals about the sale of contraceptives to juveniles, and though no first-hand information on such matters was laid before the Committee, yet we are of the opinion that the sale of contraceptives to young persons should be prohibited.   (6) THE CONTROL OF THE ADVERTISEMENT AND SALE OF ABORTIFACIENT DRUGS AND APPLIANCES.  The Committee recommends the advertising and sale (except by doctor's prescription) of drugs euphemistically described as for the \"correction of women's ailments\" or \"correction of irregularities\" should be forbidded. For their alleged purpose of correcting functional menstrual irregularities they have no value; as abortifacients though usually ineffective their unrestricted sale should be forbidden. As stated previously, \"their only value is as a lucrative source of gain to those people who, knowing their inefficiency, yet exploit the distress of certain women by selling them.\" An example of this exploitation was obtained by the Committee. The drugs were advertised as \"corrective pills, ordinary strength, 7s. 6d.; extra strong, 12s. 6d.; special strength, 20s.\" A supply of the last was obtained, and analysis showed that they consisted of (1) a capsule containing about 12 drops of oil of savin, value about 6d., dangerous to health but usually useless for the purpose sold; (2) 9 tablets of quinine, worth about 4s., and quite ineffective; (3) 24 iron and aloes pills, worth about 6d., and equally ineffective. The gross profit on this 2s. worth of rubbish was at least 900 per cent. If it is possible to legislate to stop such fraudulent exploitation of people we recommend that it be done.  The Committee also recommends that the sale of surgical instruments which can be used for the purpose of procuring abortions, such as catheters, Bougies, and sea-tangle tents, be prohibited, except on the prescription of a medical practitioner, and that if possible their importation be placed under control.     PART IV.--QUESTIONS RELATING TO THE MEDICO-LEGAL ASPECTS OF ABORTION.   At the present time there is in many countries much criticism of the existing laws regarding abortion, and various suggestions have been made for the alteration of the law.  Such representations have, indeed, been made to this Committee.  A consideration of these matters, therefore, could not escape our attention.   THE NEW ZEALAND LAW REGARDING ABORTION.  The law in regard to abortion as set down in sections 221, 222, and 223 of the Crimes Act, 1908, is as follows:--      _Procuring Abortion._      \"221. (1). Every one is liable to imprisonment with hard labour for     life who, with intent to procure the miscarriage of any woman or     girl, whether with child or not, unlawfully administers to or     causes to be taken by her any poison or other noxious thing, or     unlawfully uses any instrument or other means whatsoever with the     like intent.      \"(2) The woman or girl herself is not indictable under this     section.\"  This section re-enacts s. 201 of the Criminal Code Act, 1893. _Cf._ s. 223, _infra_.  \"Other means\" must be read _ejusdem generis_ with \"instrument.\" (_R._ v. _Skellon_ [1913] 33 N.Z.L.R. 102.)      \"_Procuring her own Miscarriage._      \"222. Every woman or girl is liable to seven years' imprisonment     with hard labour who, whether with child or not, unlawfully     administers to herself, or permits to be administered to her, any     poison or other noxious thing, or unlawfully uses on herself, or     permits to be used on her, any instrument or other means whatsoever     with intent to procure miscarriage.\"  This section re-enacts s. 202 of the Criminal Code Act, 1893.      \"_Supplying the Means of Procuring Abortion._      \"223. (1) Every one is liable to three years' imprisonment with     hard labour who unlawfully supplies or procures any poison or other     noxious thing, or any instrument or thing whatsoever, knowing that     the same is intended to be unlawfully used or employed with intent     to procure the miscarriage of any woman or girl, whether with child     or not.      \"(2) Every one who commits this offence after a previous conviction     for a like offence is liable to imprisonment with hard labour for     life.\"  This section re-enacts s. 203 of the Criminal Code Act, 1893. In _R._ v. _Thompson_ [1911] 30 N.Z.L.R. 690, a person was convicted of an attempt (s. 93. p. 209, _ante_) to procure a noxious thing although the thing actually procured was innoxious.  \"Knowing\" has the meaning of \"believing,\" and a person supplying \"a noxious thing\" is guilty even when the person supplied, who states that he required it for procuring abortion, had no intention of using it and did not use it for that purpose (_R._ v. _Nosworthy_ [1907] 36 N.Z.L.R. 536).  If the evidence shows that prisoner intended the instrument to be used for the purpose stated, it is sufficient without evidence of intention on the part of the woman to use it or allow it to be"]]]
