Therefore we cannot boast of many merits and works, if they are viewed apart from grace and mercy, but as it is written, 1 Cor. 1, 31: He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord, namely, that he has a gracious God. For thus all is well. We say, besides, that if good works do not follow, faith is false and not true.  XIV. Of Monastic Vows.  As monastic vows directly conflict with the first chief article, they must be absolutely abolished. For it is of them that Christ says, Matt. 24, 5. 23 ff.: I am Christ, etc. For he who makes a vow to live as a monk believes that he will enter upon a mode of life holier than ordinary Christians lead, and wishes to earn heaven by his own works not only for himself, but also for others; this is to deny Christ. And they boast from their St. Thomas that a monastic vow is equal to Baptism. This is blasphemy [against God].  XV. Of Human Traditions.  The declaration of the Papists that human traditions serve for the remission of sins, or merit salvation, is [altogether] unchristian and condemned, as Christ says Matt. 15, 9: In vain they do worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. Again, Titus 1, 14: That turn from the truth. Again, when they declare that it is a mortal sin if one breaks these ordinances [does not keep these statutes], this, too, is not right.  These are the articles on which I must stand, and, God willing, shall stand even to my death; and I do not know how to change or to yield anything in them. If any one wishes to yield anything, let him do it at the peril of his conscience.  Lastly, there still remains the Pope's bag of impostures concerning foolish and childish articles, as, the dedication of churches, the baptism of bells, the baptism of the altarstone, and the inviting of sponsors to these rites, who would make donations towards them. Such baptizing is a reproach and mockery of Holy Baptism, hence should not be tolerated. Furthermore, concerning the consecration of wax-tapers, palm-branches, cakes, oats, [herbs,] spices, etc., which indeed, cannot be called consecrations, but are sheer mockery and fraud. And such deceptions there are without number, which we commend for adoration to their god and to themselves, until they weary of it. We will [ought to] have nothing to do with them.

Stokes Company   TO THOSE THOUGHTFUL PERSIANS WHO CAN READ A WARNING IN THE SUDDEN RISE AND SWIFT EXTINCTION OF A FOOLISH PEOPLE THIS VOLUME IS DEDICATED   A FEW WORDS BY HEDFUL  SURNAMED \"THE AXIS OF WISDOM\"  _Curator of the Imperial Museum at Shiraz._ _Author of \"The Celestial Conquest of Kaly-phorn-ya,\" and of_ _\"Northern Mehrika under the Hy-Bernyan Rulers\"_   The astounding discoveries of Khan-li of Dimph-yoo-chur have thrown floods of light upon the domestic life of the Mehrikan people. He little realized when he landed upon that sleeping continent what a service he was about to render history, or what enthusiasm his discoveries would arouse among Persian archæologists.  Every student of antiquity is familiar with these facts.  But for the benefit of those who have yet to acquire a knowledge of this extraordinary people, I advise, first, a visit to the Museum at Teheran in order to excite their interest in the subject, and second, the reading of such books as Nōfūhl's \"What we Found in the West,\" and Nōz-yt-ahl's \"History of the Mehrikans.\" The last-named is a complete and reliable history of these people from the birth of the Republic under George-wash-yn-tun to the year 1990, when they ceased to exist as a nation. I must say, however, that Nōz-yt-ahl leaves the reader much confused concerning the period between the massacre of the Protestants in 1927, and the overflow of the Murfey dynasty in 1940.  He holds the opinion with many other historians that the Mehrikans were a mongrel race, with little or no patriotism, and were purely imitative; simply an enlarged copy of other nationalities extant at the time. He pronounces them a shallow, nervous, extravagant people, and accords them but few redeeming virtues. This, of course, is just; but nevertheless they will always be an interesting study by reason of their rapid growth, their vast numbers, their marvellous mechanical ingenuity and their sudden and almost unaccountable disappearance.  The wealth, luxury, and gradual decline of the native population; the frightful climatic changes which swept the country like a mower's scythe; the rapid conversion of a vast continent, alive with millions of pleasure-loving people, into a silent wilderness, where the sun and moon look down in turn upon hundreds of weed-grown cities,--all this is told by Nōz-yt-ahl with force and accuracy.  \"Here's Truth. 'T is a bitter pill but good physic.\"     ABOARD THE ZLŌTUHB IN THE YEAR 2951  _10th May_    There is land ahead!  Grip-til-lah was first to see it, and when he shouted the tidings my heart beat fast with joy. The famished crew have forgotten their disconsolate stomachs and are dancing about the deck. 'T is not I, forsooth, who shall restrain them! A month of emptiness upon a heavy sea is preparation for any folly. Nōfūhl alone is without enthusiasm. The old man's heart seems dead.  We can see the land plainly, a dim strip along the western horizon. A fair wind blows from the northeast, but we get on with cruel hindrance, for the _Zlōtuhb_ is a heavy ship, her bluff bow and voluminous bottom ill fitting her for speed.  The land, as we near it, seems covered with trees, and the white breakers along the yellow beach are a welcome sight.     _11th May_    Sighted a fine harbor this afternoon, and are now at anchor in it.  Grip-til-lah thinks we have reached one of the western islands mentioned by Ben-a-Bout. Nōfūhl, however, is sure we are further North.     _12th May_    What a change has come over Nōfūhl! He is the youngest man aboard. We all share his delight, as our discoveries are truly marvellous. This morning while I was yet in my bunk he ran into the cabin and, forgetting our difference in rank, seized me by the arm and tried to drag me out. His excitement so had the better of him that I captured little meaning from his words. Hastening after him, however, I was amazed to see such ancient limbs transport a man so rapidly. He skipped up the narrow stairs like a heifer and, young though I am, it was faster than I could follow.  But what a sight when I reached the deck! We saw nothing of it yesterday, for the dusk of evening was already closing about us when we anchored.  Right ahead, in the middle of the bay, towered a gigantic statue, many times higher than the masts of our ship. Beyond, from behind this statue, came the broad river upon whose waters we were floating, its surface all a-glitter with the rising sun. To the East, where Nōfūhl was pointing, his fingers trembling with excitement, lay the ruins of an endless city. It stretched far away into the land beyond, further even than our eyes could see. And in the smaller river on the right stood two colossal structures, rising high in the air, and standing like twin brothers, as if to guard the deserted streets beneath. Not a sound reached us--not a floating thing disturbed the surface of the water. Verily, it seemed the sleep of Death.  I was lost in wonder.  As we looked, a strange bird, like a heron, arose with a hoarse cry from the foot of the great image and flew toward the city.  \"What does it all mean?\" I cried. \"Where are we?\"  \"Where indeed!\" said Nōfūhl. \"If I knew but that, O Prince, I could tell the rest! No traveller has mentioned these ruins. Persian history contains no record of such a people. Allah has decreed that we discover a forgotten world.\"  [Illustration: The City of Ruins]   Within an hour we landed, and found ourselves in an ancient street, the pavements covered with weeds, grass, and flowers, all crowding together in wild neglect. Huge trees of great antiquity thrust their limbs through windows and roofs and produced a mournful sight. They gave a welcome shade, however, as we find the heat ashore of a roasting quality most hard to bear. The curious buildings on either side are wonderfully preserved, even sheets of glass still standing in many of the iron window-frames.  We wandered along through the thick grass, Nōfūhl and I, much excited over our discoveries and delighted with the strange scene. The sunshine is of dazzling brightness, birds are singing everywhere, and the ruins are gay with gorgeous wild flowers. We soon found ourselves in what was once a public square, now for the most part a shady grove. (Afterward ascertained to be the square of the City Hall.)  [Illustration: \"We soon found ourselves in what was once a public square.\"]  As we sat on a fallen cornice and gazed on the lofty buildings about us I asked Nōfūhl if he was still in ignorance as to where we were, and he said:  \"As yet I know not. The architecture is much like that of ancient Europe, but it tells us nothing.\"  Then I said to him in jest, \"Let this teach us, O Nōfūhl! the folly of excessive wisdom. Who among thy pupils of the Imperial College at Ispahan would believe their venerable instructor in history and languages could visit the largest city in the world and know so little about it!\"  \"Thy words are wise, my Prince,\" he answered; \"few babes could know less.\"  As we were leaving this grove my eyes fell upon an upturned slab that seemed to have a meaning. It was lying at our feet, partly hidden by the tall grass, having fallen from the columns that supported it. Upon its surface were strange characters in bold relief, as sharp and clear as when chiselled ten centuries ago. I pointed it out to Nōfūhl, and we bent over it with eager eyes.  It was this:      ASTOR HOUSE  \"The inscription is Old English,\" he said. \"'House' signified a dwelling, but the word 'Astor' I know not. It was probably the name of a deity, and here was his temple.\"  This was encouraging, and we looked about eagerly for other signs.   Our steps soon brought us into another street, and as we walked I expressed my surprise at the wonderful preservation of the stone work, which looked as though cut but yesterday.  \"In such an atmosphere decay is slow,\" said Nōfūhl. \"A thousand years at least have passed since these houses were occupied. Take yonder oak, for instance; the tree itself has been growing for at least a hundred years, and we know from the fallen mass beneath it that centuries had gone by before its birth was possible.\"  He stopped speaking, his eyes fixed upon an inscription over a doorway, partly hidden by one of the branches of the oak.  Turning suddenly upon me with a look of triumph, he exclaimed:  \"It is ours!\"  \"What is ours?\" I asked.  \"The knowledge we sought;\" and he pointed to the inscription,  NEW YORK STOCK EXC....  He was tremulous with joy.  [Illustration: \"'The knowledge we sought;' and he pointed to the inscription.\"]  \"Thou hast heard of Nhū-Yok, O my Prince?\"  I answered that I had read of it at school.  \"Thou art in it now!\" he said. \"We are standing on the Western Continent. Little wonder we thought our voyage long!\"  \"And what was Nhū-Yok?\" I asked. \"I read of it at college, but remember little. Was it not the capital of the ancient Mehrikans?\"  \"Not the capital,\" he answered, \"but their largest city. Its population was four millions.\"  \"Four millions!\" I exclaimed. \"Verily, O Fountain of Wisdom, that is many for one city!\"  \"Such is history, my Prince! Moreover, as thou knowest, it would take us many days to walk this town.\"  \"True, it is endless.\"  He continued thus:  \"Strange that a single word can tell so much! Those iron structures, the huge statue in the harbor, the temples with pointed towers, all are as"]]]
