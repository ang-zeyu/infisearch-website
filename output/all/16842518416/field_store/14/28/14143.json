The sun soon brought warmth into the troopers' frozen limbs, and they went to work watering and feeding the horses.  Later in the morning they moved to the site of the camp to be, about a mile away.  It was a wind-smoothed stretch of untouched desert, but speedily horse-lines and white tents broke its vastness.  That night Mac, doing his turn of horse-picket while the tired camp slept, walked out a little way into the silver moonlit desert.  In the utter stillness, with the cold pure air, the sands unmarked by any footstep, and the impression of unlimited space, the desert seemed a new world--a world far away from the old one.  But busy days followed, and the desert soon lost its first charm in the solid practical work of leading the horses across it on foot till they should be strong enough to be ridden again.  It was hot dusty work in the midday sun, and Mac was thankful when the day came for him to hoist his lazy bones into the saddle.  The camp grew, and became a place of importance with its great piles of stores, its roads and its rows of mean speedily-erected shops of Greek, Armenian and Egyptian cheapjacks. The troops quickly fell in with the life, and set out to make the most of Egypt and its pleasures.  They were there until the end of April, and in those five months Mac saw most of the country one way or another, though all his journeyings are not chronicled in the pages to come.  In the course of time he hated the place, and longed with the rest of the mounted men to pass to new fields and fresh adventures. But he looks back now on those Egyptian days as the jolliest days there ever were, and breathes a sigh of sorrow that they can never come again.     CHAPTER VI  DAYS IN THE DESERT  Mac felt absolutely dejected, and looked it.  His mare, too, appeared neither happy nor spirited.  Except for some nebulous figures, indistinct in the yellow murk, little else was visible.  Mac crouched scowling in the lee of the mare, who stood with drooping head and closed eyes, swaying occasionally to the violent buffetings of the desert storm, and patiently waiting for some move on the part of her master.  The three squadrons and the transport had left camp independently just after dawn with instructions to bivouac together, at midday, at a certain spot known to the High Command by the enigmatical formula \"No. 3. Tower, 105°--Virgin's Breasts 45°.\"  Mac, who carried the compass, had taken various bearings before the breaking of the storm, and had now halted where the Major and he considered angles, bearings, and letters indicated.  There was no sign of the other units.  Either they had sagaciously abandoned the expedition earlier or else they had other opinions regarding the trysting place.  Anyhow, whether they were still wandering about the infernal desert or not, Mac was firmly convinced that camp was the place for him.  Picking up his rein, he made in the direction of a blur he knew to be the Major, and told him so.  The Major had visions of pleasant refuge in a Cairene hotel, a good dinner, and a cool bath, instead of a night trek in the desert as originally intended.  So he agreed, and shrill whistling stirred to life more or less comatose troopers and horses.  Steering, nor'-nor'-west, each following close upon the next ahead, they rode in deep silence.  They crossed wave after wave of sand-hills, monotonous and bewildering.  The khamsin blew in hot, sandy spurts, and lulled; then came again in hotter, more shrivelling bursts \"From Hell!\" thought the troopers, one and all.  Sand trickled down their necks, and filtered down to that place where it neither increased the comfort of their riding nor diminished the ardour of their revilings against the weather.  With fiercer gusts, gravel rose and stung horse and rider, while the former stumbled frequently over unseen boulders.  In the latter half of the afternoon they struck the old railway embankment to Suez, lost it again, but soon found the edge of the irrigated land and followed it to the camp.  Parched, red-eyed, headachy, and yellow with dust, they made for their lines, watered their horses, and set about making themselves as comfortable as circumstances allowed.  The happiness of the trooper was not enhanced when he failed to find a misty blur representing his tent.  It had chosen to give up the unequal contest and had departed down-wind.  He followed, and joined the rest of the tent's company in recovering the tattered remnants, and towels, and personal property which had strayed into the domain of the next regiment.  Camp was not a healthy spot in the khamsin days, Mac decided.  Coins to a piastreless cobber smoothed over a horse-picket difficulty, and he passed out of the camp by back ways.  So, in the village of Helmieh, he spent the night.  Gusts bellowed through the swaying date-palms overhead, and roared round the courtyard, but his bed was comfortable, and the house of his good French friends proof against the sand-laden blasts of the spring storm.  He was awakened sufficiently early to allow of his appearance at roll-call next morning.  It was not according to his nature to rise early from so pleasant a bed, but it was a matter of discretion.  Many days were passed in the desert, none worse and many better.  Troop days were all right; squadron days were not bad; regimental days were tolerable at times; but brigade and divisional manoeuvres were inventions of the devil.  On these latter occasions elusive white flags, the skeleton enemy, appeared and disappeared.  Scouts reported them here, then there.  The mounted men advanced in open order, all except the front line smothered in a fog of dust.  Infantry toiled and sweated after them.  The maligned staff viewed from afar the battle royal.  Thankful men received wounds from galloping umpires, and lay down peacefully to await rescue by the attentive ambulance. Chastisements descended from great to lesser dignitaries.  Why had not Colonel Macpherson managed to move his flank-guard three miles in two minutes?  So a field day would pass, each rank being roundly condemned to everlasting perdition by the rank immediately below it, until the G.O.C., Egypt, and the British Empire, bore the brunt of the awful damnings.  Bad-tempered and dishevelled, the troops would set off on their homeward march, the final straw being added to the annoyances of the infantry by the passage to windward of the mounted rifles. Shrouded in the dust, they levelled their final, terrible threats against those who would be home two hours before them.  Times there were, too, good times, when the troopers would trek across the Delta to the Barrage du Nil, a pleasant spot where the Nile divides into its delta streams and canals.  Here they would bivouac for the night beneath shady plantations of lebbak trees in beautiful gardens. In the daytime they swam their horses in the river.  A jolly form of amusement there was the blanket-tossing of intruding natives, who were rather prone to contract those things which did not belong to them; and no method of discouragement was so efficacious.  The \"Gyppies\" were fleet of foot, but so were the troopers, and to see a lanky southerner pursuing a victim was good entertainment.  Captured at length and shrieking in abject terror, they would go flying skyward from the tautened blanket.  But, alas, the blankets were of Government manufacture, and occasionally, upon the victim's meteoric return, would split in two.  Thus many blankets were rent in twain, and thus did many dusky ones learn that the belongings of the troopers were sacred property.  And so Egyptian days passed light-heartedly enough.  That was before the serious times, before they had been involved in the real fierce thing.  And now few of them ride together any longer.  Many will ride no more, and others are scattered over the earth.     CHAPTER VII  MAC GOES TO CAIRO  The camp lay listless in the glaring heat of high noon.  Long rows of tents gleamed dazzlingly in the sun.  Saddlery, horse-rugs, nose-bags and gear were untidily scattered about.  Except for the sleepy figure of the horse-picket, attempting vainly to keep his lanky person within the shadow of the feed-trough, there was no one in sight.  The horses needed little attention.  With heads low and legs crooked, they dozed in every attitude of siesta.  Within the open tents lay the human element, more or less replete after the seldom varying meal of sandy stew and bread.  Most of the men slept, stretched full length upon rush matting on the shady sides of the tents.  Some wore trousers, some shirts and some neither.  Stretched full length upon his back, his head supported upon his neighbour's chest, and his eyes idly following the ceaseless procession of flies round the tent pole, Mac smoked and pondered deeply: was it worth the fag to go to Cairo?  Knowing full well that his last three weeks' shirts and socks awaited washing, he decidedly dutifully to remain at home, though possibly he might take the air, and probably the beer, of Heliopolis in the evening.  However, his good intentions were ruthlessly upset, for at that moment the interior of his desert domicile was swiftly converted into a swirling tornado of dust and dirt.  Blankets, towels and hay departed upwards, and all was turmoil. In five seconds the air was calm again, but not so the eight inhabitants of the canvas home.  Emerging from repose and a fog of grimy dust, they condemned Egypt and things Egyptian in no uncertain tones.  They had washed and eaten, and had settled down comfortably for the afternoon, and why had this confounded blanky cyclone selected their blanky tent to blanky well empty itself upon!  Often during the midday heat, \"weary Willies,\" swirling spiral columns of sand 1,000 feet high, wandered in slow procession"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26548"],["title","The Tale of a Trooper (#8)"],["body"," the edge of the desert from the north-east, usually missing the camp, but sometimes crossing it, leaving a narrow trail of chaos and ill temper.  Mac met the situation with admirable dignity and philosophy.  This disturbance decided the Cairo question--he would go. Still muttering wrathfully, the tent's complement sought their individual towels and gravitated independently and sorrowfully towards the shower-baths.  Three-quarters of an hour later found Mac, suitably adorned, sitting on a bench at Helmeih Station having his boots and bandolier polished by four jabbering, disreputable \"Gyppie\" youngsters, who swore glibly the while the most lurid English oaths.  Incidentally, they often terminated an exceptionally fluent flow with \"Eh, Mistah Mickkenzie?\" the usual mode of native address to New Zealanders after the High Commissioner's visit, which sometimes ruffled Mac's dignity, but more often amused him.  His toilet was cut short by the arrival of the train, so, seizing bandolier and spurs and dropping a few coins, he jumped into a second-class compartment with but one boot clean of desert sand.  Rattling through Palais de Koubbeh and Demerdache, he considered what he might do with himself now he had quitted camp. Money was not so plentiful as in those palmy days when they had set foot in this Orient land with two months' pay behind them.  \"Special prices,\" too, were quoted for these men from the south.  However, it was a lot of trouble to think on such an afternoon; he would decide it later.  At any rate a shave was felt to be the most overpowering necessity, though, really, the desert did make one thirsty!  A shave would be the second item.  In a small inferior café near the Boulak Station, he discovered Jock, an artilleryman he knew, and together they satisfied their thirst; neither had formed any plan for the afternoon, so both welcomed the idea of spending it in company.  They adjourned to the barber's. Shaving in Sahara sand appealed not to Mac's heart, and, failing visits to Cairo, mornings found him in an evil mood with a painful task before him.  Shaving over, and Mac's other boot cleaned, a little sight-seeing was suggested as a modest and inexpensive way of passing the afternoon. The Pyramids were stale, besides being a dickens of a distance off. The gunner voted for the Citadel, and Mac didn't mind, though he had been there once already.  They made their way towards a gharry stand, and, spurning clamouring drivers from their path, comfortably seated themselves in the one which appeared to sport the best pair of Arab horses.  Their feet supported upon the opposite seat, blue wisps of the best Egyptian tobacco smoke trailing over the hood behind, they set off.  Scanning the Oriental life surging round them, criticizing Arab methods of dressing sheep, amused by the scribes and money-changers--dirty though prosperous-looking sharpers--and so on and so forth, they passed slowly down the long Sharia-Mahommed Ali, between the frowning walls of two great Mosques, where the cannon balls of Napoleon are still fast in the stone, and then up the sharp incline into the Citadel itself.  Leaving the Arab driver in a paroxysm of tears because he had received only one-third more than his lawful fare, Jock and Mac passed by the sentries, through the cavernous mouth of the main gate into the inner precincts of the Citadel.  How powerful a fortress in days gone by it must have been, they thought, but how short lived and unavailing it would prove before modern artillery.  They came to a halt before the great Mosque of Mahommed Ali, and the fine, tapering minarets met with their deepest approval.  At the entrance they assumed the apologetic sandals and were taken in hand by an obtrusive dragoman, who, besides impressing them with his own importance, related with small appreciation of truth fabulous facts concerning the edifice.  They duly noted his salient pronouncements, rewarded him with a few piastres and \"imshi yallah'ed\" in duet when he demanded more.  Then, in the late afternoon sunlight, they stood on the edge of the cliff without.  There they talked of many things while looking out over that weird, mysterious city, over its forests of graceful minarets, towards the green delta beyond; across the Nile to the west where the Pyramids of Gizeh stood silhouetted against the setting sun, and down into the gloom in the valley to the east, where, silent and deserted, lay the City of the Dead.  Stirred into activity once more by feelings of emptiness and thoughts of their weekly square meal, they turned their backs upon the glory of the Egyptian evening and wandered down to the depths again.  They jostled their way through the throng, human and animal, which made progress difficult and the atmosphere strong.  Spotting a couple of donkeys in the charge of one Arab donkey boy, they schemed with each other with a view to his undoing.  \"Very gude, Noo Zealand,\" said the dusky one when approached.  \"Gib it twenty piastres for stashion.\"  \"All right, ole sport.  You'll get it at t'other end, and make your blanky bone-bags go.  Savvy?\"  They proceeded fairly satisfactorily at first, Ahmed only having to be occasionally reprimanded for not producing sufficient speed on the part of his donks.  Then, while the Arab was in front of Mac, vainly endeavouring to persuade Jock's mount to proceed less swiftly, Mac quietly took a turning to the left.  The Arab went twenty-five yards farther before he missed him.  In violent excitement he tore after him and besought him to stop.  \"All right, you black diamond,\" said Mac cheerfully, and remained standing in the street.  The Arab, his fears at rest, chased the other soldier, but as soon as the native had disappeared round the corner, Mac moved on again.  The same thing happened in the case of the gunner, who halted immediately the Arab arrived.  The latter wanted to lead the donkey in the direction of the trooper, but the gunner was obstinate and insisted that his was the correct way.  In a frame of mind too horrible to contemplate, the Arab disappeared once more in pursuit of the trooper, only to find he had entirely evaporated.  In the throes of the greatest dilemma of his life he returned, to learn that the worst had come to pass and the gunner and his donkey also were gone from his sight.  \"Allah!  Oh, Allah!\" he wailed, and, burying his head in his long blue skirts, he dissolved into tears.  By devious ways Mac and Jock journeyed onwards, until, happy and laughing at having for once done a nigger in the eye, they rejoined at the Obelisk Restaurant, where they turned their borrowed steeds adrift. Coming weekly as it did, dinner in Cairo was an affair of some length, and, between shandies and cigarettes, it was already late when it was _mafeesh_.  They strolled along the streets and were about to drop into the Café Égyptien, when they espied a fellow-countryman struggling with a donkey.  They went to his assistance, to discover that the donk-man was, quite unnecessarily, attempting to stop a bottle of beer being poured down the donk's throat.  This promised sport, so Jock quickly procured four more bottles of cheap beer and they joined the third soldier in his estimable effort.  Abdul had secured an assistant against this vile outrage to his animal, but he was temporarily put out of action by having the reins made fast round his lower extremities.  The donk rapidly absorbed three bottles, while the distracted \"Gyppies\" tugged and wailed, \"No gude!  No gude!  Finish Noo Zealand!\" to which the only reply was \"Imshi Yallah, you black devils.\"  At this stage the little beast, an animal of rather miserable dimensions, with a large, rotund centrepiece, escaped and wobbled ridiculously down the street. He was recaptured, drenched with two more bottles, and let loose to wander wherever his tottery legs would carry him.  The donk swayed and stumbled, his ears cocked at all angles, and his expression happy and foolish.  The gathered soldiers laughed till their sides were sore, and when tired of this fun they let the Arabs take away, as best they could, their ill-used, though happy, ass.  The hour had grown late.  To the station the trooper and the gunner wended their way.  A short sleep in the train, a tired walk campwards in the clear coolness of the Egyptian night, and to bed on the open sand beneath a starry vault.  \"Lights out\" sounded clearly in their camp, and echoed more beautifully and faintly from other camps along the desert's edge.     CHAPTER VIII  MAC TOURS IN COMFORT  Mac sighed appreciatively.  If Egypt was to be seen, this was undoubtedly the way to see it.  On the whole it had been an exceedingly profitable little bit of diplomacy, coupled with good luck, that had attached him to a party of distinguished people, whose privilege it was to be shown Egypt as the Government chose to show it.  He lay comfortably in his bed smoking.  Travelling in this manner appealed to him.  His first tastes of Egyptian railway travelling, in dirty, clanking boxes, which required disinfecting, had not been pleasant. Now, from the darkened cabin of a saloon car on the Cairo-Luxor express de luxe, he watched the fleeting vista of moonlit palms, sleeping villages, and silhouetted hills.  He had left New Zealand some six months before with the intention of slaying Germans, not of touring in luxury in Egypt, but he was not averse to these interim enjoyments.  The war could wait, and anyhow at that particular moment it was hardly showing any inclination of stopping, and neither was Zeitoun Camp a place of unmixed blessings. Arrived at this state of mental satisfaction, he threw the remnants of his cigarette out of the window and went to sleep.  When he awoke, they were rattling over a Nile bridge, and the sun shone full in upon him.  The early morning scene of industrious blue-robed fellaheen at work in the green fields, the graceful palms, desert hills, and blue sky thrilled the one artistic fibre which "]]]
