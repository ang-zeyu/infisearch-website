Ever and again she stopped and listened, and at last, very far away, she heard a measured chinking. It was so faint even in the morning stillness that she could tell it must be far away. But she knew the sound was that of a man sharpening a flint.  Presently the trees began to thin out, and then came a regiment of nettles barring the way. She turned aside, and then she came to a fallen tree that she knew, with a noise of bees about it. And so presently she was in sight of the knoll, very far off, and the river under it, and the children and the hippopotami just as they had been yesterday, and the thin spire of smoke swaying in the morning breeze. Far away by the river was the cluster of alders where she had hidden. And at the sight of that the fear of Uya returned, and she crept into a thicket of bracken, out of which a rabbit scuttled, and lay awhile to watch the squatting-place.  The men were mostly out of sight, saving Wau, the flint-chopper; and at that she felt safer. They were away hunting food, no doubt. Some of the women, too, were down in the stream, stooping intent, seeking mussels, crayfish, and water-snails, and at the sight of their occupation Eudena felt hungry. She rose, and ran through the fern, designing to join them. As she went she heard a voice among the bracken calling softly. She stopped. Then suddenly she heard a rustle behind her, and turning, saw Ugh-lomi rising out of the fern. There were streaks of brown blood and dirt on his face, and his eyes were fierce, and the white stone of Uya, the white Fire Stone, that none but Uya dared to touch, was in his hand. In a stride he was beside her, and gripped her arm. He swung her about, and thrust her before him towards the woods. \"Uya,\" he said, and waved his arms about. She heard a cry, looked back, and saw all the women standing up, and two wading out of the stream. Then came a nearer howling, and the old woman with the beard, who watched the fire on the knoll, was waving her arms, and Wau, the man who had been chipping the flint, was getting to his feet. The little children too were hurrying and shouting.  \"Come!\" said Ugh-lomi, and dragged her by the arm.  She still did not understand.  \"Uya has called the death word,\" said Ugh-lomi, and she glanced back at the screaming curve of figures, and understood.  Wau and all the women and children were coming towards them, a scattered array of buff shock-headed figures, howling, leaping, and crying. Over the knoll two youths hurried. Down among the ferns to the right came a man, heading them off from the wood. Ugh-lomi left her arm, and the two began running side by side, leaping the bracken and stepping clear and wide. Eudena, knowing her fleetness and the fleetness of Ugh-lomi, laughed aloud at the unequal chase. They were an exceptionally straight-limbed couple for those days.  They soon cleared the open, and drew near the wood of chestnut-trees again--neither afraid now because neither was alone. They slackened their pace, already not excessive. And suddenly Eudena cried and swerved aside, pointing, and looking up through the tree-stems. Ugh-lomi saw the feet and legs of men running towards him. Eudena was already running off at a tangent. And as he too turned to follow her they heard the voice of Uya coming through the trees, and roaring out his rage at them.  Then terror came in their hearts, not the terror that numbs, but the terror that makes one silent and swift. They were cut off now on two sides. They were in a sort of corner of pursuit. On the right hand, and near by them, came the men swift and heavy, with bearded Uya, antler in hand, leading them; and on the left, scattered as one scatters corn, yellow dashes among the fern and grass, ran Wau and the women; and even the little children from the shallow had joined the chase. The two parties converged upon them. Off they went, with Eudena ahead.  They knew there was no mercy for them. There was no hunting so sweet to these ancient men as the hunting of men. Once the fierce passion of the chase was lit, the feeble beginnings of humanity in them were thrown to the winds. And Uya in the night had marked Ugh-lomi with the death word. Ugh-lomi was the day's quarry, the appointed feast.  They ran straight--it was their only chance--taking whatever ground came in the way--a spread of stinging nettles, an open glade, a clump of grass out of which a hy√¶na fled snarling. Then woods again, long stretches of shady leaf-mould and moss under the green trunks. Then a stiff slope, tree-clad, and long vistas of trees, a glade, a succulent green area of black mud, a wide open space again, and then a clump of lacerating brambles, with beast tracks through it. Behind them the chase trailed out and scattered, with Uya ever at their heels. Eudena kept the first place, running light and with her breath easy, for Ugh-lomi carried the Fire Stone in his hand.  It told on his pace--not at first, but after a time. His footsteps behind her suddenly grew remote. Glancing over her shoulder as they crossed another open space, Eudena saw that Ugh-lomi was many yards behind her, and Uya close upon him, with antler already raised in the air to strike him down. Wau and the others were but just emerging from the shadow of the woods.  Seeing Ugh-lomi in peril, Eudena ran sideways, looking back, threw up her arms and cried aloud, just as the antler flew. And young Ugh-lomi, expecting this and understanding her cry, ducked his head, so that the missile merely struck his scalp lightly, making but a trivial wound, and flew over him. He turned forthwith, the quartzite Fire Stone in both hands, and hurled it straight at Uya's body as he ran loose from the throw. Uya shouted, but could not dodge it. It took him under the ribs, heavy and flat, and he reeled and went down without a cry. Ugh-lomi caught up the antler--one tine of it was tipped with his own blood--and came running on again with a red trickle just coming out of his hair.  Uya rolled over twice, and lay a moment before he got up, and then he did not run fast. The colour of his face was changed. Wau overtook him, and then others, and he coughed and laboured in his breath. But he kept on.  At last the two fugitives gained the bank of the river, where the stream ran deep and narrow, and they still had fifty yards in hand of Wau, the foremost pursuer, the man who made the smiting-stones. He carried one, a large flint, the shape of an oyster and double the size, chipped to a chisel edge, in either hand.  They sprang down the steep bank into the stream, rushed through the water, swam the deep current in two or three strokes, and came out wading again, dripping and refreshed, to clamber up the farther bank. It was undermined, and with willows growing thickly therefrom, so that it needed clambering. And while Eudena was still among the silvery branches and Ugh-lomi still in the water--for the antler had encumbered him--Wau came up against the sky on the opposite bank, and the smiting-stone, thrown cunningly, took the side of Eudena's knee. She struggled to the top and fell.  They heard the pursuers shout to one another, and Ugh-lomi climbing to her and moving jerkily to mar Wau's aim, felt the second smiting-stone graze his ear, and heard the water splash below him.  Then it was Ugh-lomi, the stripling, proved himself to have come to man's estate. For running on, he found Eudena fell behind, limping, and at that he turned, and crying savagely and with a face terrible with sudden wrath and trickling blood, ran swiftly past her back to the bank, whirling the antler round his head. And Eudena kept on, running stoutly still, though she must needs limp at every step, and the pain was already sharp.  So that Wau, rising over the edge and clutching the straight willow branches, saw Ugh-lomi towering over him, gigantic against the blue; saw his whole body swing round, and the grip of his hands upon the antler. The edge of the antler came sweeping through the air, and he saw no more. The water under the osiers whirled and eddied and went crimson six feet down the stream. Uya following stopped knee-high across the stream, and the man who was swimming turned about.  The other men who trailed after--they were none of them very mighty men (for Uya was more cunning than strong, brooking no sturdy rivals)--slackened momentarily at the sight of Ugh-lomi standing there above the willows, bloody and terrible, between them and the halting girl, with the huge antler waving in his hand. It seemed as though he had gone into the water a youth, and come out of it a man full grown.  He knew what there was behind him. A broad stretch of grass, and then a thicket, and in that Eudena could hide. That was clear in his mind, though his thinking powers were too feeble to see what should happen thereafter. Uya stood knee-deep, undecided and unarmed. His heavy mouth hung open, showing his canine teeth, and he panted heavily. His side was flushed and bruised under the hair. The other man beside him carried a sharpened stick. The rest of the hunters came up one by one to the top of the bank, hairy, long-armed men clutching flints and sticks. Two ran off along the bank down stream, and then clambered to the water, where Wau had come to the surface struggling weakly. Before they could reach him he went under again. Two others threatened Ugh-lomi from the bank.  He answered back, shouts, vague insults, gestures. Then Uya, who had been hesitating, roared with rage, and whirling his fists plunged into the water. His followers splashed after him.  Ugh-lomi glanced over his shoulder and found Eudena already vanished into the thicket. He would perhaps have waited for Uya, but Uya preferred to spar in the water below him until the others were beside him. Human tactics in those days, in all serious fighting, were the tactics of the pack. Prey that turned at bay they gathered around and rushed."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27370"],["title","Poems (#0)"],["body","by  MARY BAKER EDDY  Author of \"Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures\"        Published by The Trustees under the Will of Mary Baker G. Eddy Boston, U.S.A.  Authorized Literature of The First Church of Christ, Scientist in Boston, Massachusetts  Copyright, 1910 by Mary Baker Eddy All Rights Reserved  Printed in the United States of America     PREFACE   _The poems garnered up in this little volume were written at different periods in the life of the author, dating from her early girlhood up to recent years. They were not written with a view of making a book, each poem being the spontaneous outpouring of a deeply poetic nature and called forth by some experience that claimed her attention._  _The \"Old Man of the Mountain,\" for instance, was written while the author was contemplating this lofty New Hampshire crag, whose rugged outlines resemble the profile of a human face. Inspired by the grandeur of this masterpiece of nature's handiwork, and looking \"up through nature, unto nature's God,\" the poem began to take form in her thought, and alighting from her carriage, she seated herself by the roadside and began to write. Some tourists who were passing, and who made her acquaintance, asked her what she was writing, and she replied by reading the poem to them. They were so pleased with it that each requested a copy, which was subsequently mailed to them. Similar requests continued to reach the author for years afterward, until the poem finally found its way into print, appearing, together with \"The Valley Cemetery,\" in a book \"Gems for You,\" published in Manchester, N. H., in 1850, and again in Boston, in 1856._  _The poem on the \"Dedication of a Temperance Hall,\" in Lynn, Mass., in 1866, was written for that occasion, and was sung by the audience as a dedicatory hymn. \"The Liberty Bells\" appeared in a Lynn, Mass., newspaper, under the date of February 3, 1865. A note from the author, which was published with the poem, read as follows:_  \"MR. EDITOR:--_In 1835 a mob in Boston (although Boston has since been the pioneer of anti-slavery) dispersed a meeting of the Female Anti-Slavery Society, and assailed the person of William Lloyd Garrison with such fury that the city authorities could protect him nowhere but in the walls of a jail. To-day, by order of Governor Andrew, the bells are ringing to celebrate the passing of a resolution in Congress prohibiting slavery in the United States.\"_  _All of the author's best-known hymns are included in this collection, as well as many poems written in girlhood and during the years she resided in Lynn, Mass., and which appeared in various publications of that day. Among her earliest poems are \"Upward,\" \"Resolutions for the Day,\" \"Autumn\" (written in a maple grove), \"Alphabet and Bayonet,\" and \"The Country-Seat\" (written while visiting a family friend in the beautiful suburbs of Boston); yet, even these are characterized by the same lofty trend of thought that reached its fulness in her later productions._  _In May, 1910, Mrs. Eddy requested her publisher to prepare a few bound volumes of her poems, for private distribution. When this became known to her friends, they urged her to allow a popular edition to be issued, to which she assented. With grateful acknowledgment, therefore, of this permission, this little volume is presented to the public, in the hope that these gems of purest thought from this spiritually-minded author will prove a joy to the heavy laden and a balm to the weary heart._                                                         ADAM H.

Primeval dweller where the wild winds rest,     Beyond the ken of mortal e'er to tell     What power sustains thee in thy rock-bound cell.      Or if, when first creation vast began,     And far the universal fiat ran,     \"Let there be light\"--from chaos dark set free,     Ye rose, a monument of Deity,      Proud from yon cloud-crowned height to look henceforth     On insignificance that peoples earth,     Recalling oft the bitter draft which turns     The mind to meditate on what it learns.      Stern, passionless, no soul those looks betray;     Though kindred rocks, to sport at mortal clay--     Much as the chisel of the sculptor's art     \"Plays round the head, but comes not to the heart.\"      Ah, who can fathom thee! Ambitious man,     Like a trained falcon in the Gallic van,     Guided and led, can never reach to thee     With all the strength of weakness--vanity!      Great as thou art, and paralleled by none,     Admired by all, still art thou drear and lone!     The moon looks down upon thine exiled height;     The stars, so cold, so glitteringly bright,      On wings of morning gladly flit away,     Yield to the sun's more genial, mighty ray;     The white waves kiss the murmuring rill--     But thy deep silence is unbroken still.     _CONSTANCY_       When starlight blends with morning's hue,     I miss thee as the flower the dew!     When noonday's length'ning shadows flee,     I think of thee, I think of thee!      With evening, memories reappear--     I watch thy chair, and wish thee here;     Till sleep sets drooping fancy free     To dream of thee, to dream of thee!      Since first we met, in weal or woe     It hath been thus; and must be so     Till bursting bonds our spirits part     And Love divine doth fill my heart.      Written many years ago.     _MOTHER'S EVENING PRAYER_       O gentle presence, peace and joy and power;       O Life divine, that owns each waiting hour,     Thou Love that guards the nestling's faltering flight!       Keep Thou my child on upward wing tonight.      Love is our refuge; only with mine eye       Can I behold the snare, the pit, the fall:     His habitation high is here, and nigh,       His arm encircles me, and mine, and all.      O make me glad for every scalding tear,       For hope deferred, ingratitude, disdain!     Wait, and love more for every hate, and fear       No ill,--since God is good, and loss is gain.      Beneath the shadow of His mighty wing;       In that sweet secret of the narrow way,     Seeking and finding, with the angels sing:       \"Lo, I am with you alway,\"--watch and pray.      No snare, no fowler, pestilence or pain;       No night drops down upon the troubled breast,     When heaven's aftersmile earth's tear-drops gain,       And mother finds her home and heav'nly rest.     _LOVE_       Brood o'er us with Thy shelt'ring wing,       'Neath which our spirits blend     Like brother birds, that soar and sing,       And on the same branch bend.     The arrow that doth wound the dove     Darts not from those who watch and love.      If thou the bending reed wouldst break       By thought or word unkind,     Pray that his spirit you partake,       Who loved and healed mankind:     Seek holy thoughts and heavenly strain,     That make men one in love remain.      Learn, too, that wisdom's rod is given       For faith to kiss, and know;     That greetings glorious from high heaven,       Whence joys supernal flow,     Come from that Love, divinely near,     Which chastens pride and earth-born fear,     Through God, who gave that word of might       Which swelled creation's lay:     \"Let there be light, and there was light.\"       What chased the clouds away?     'Twas Love whose"]]]
