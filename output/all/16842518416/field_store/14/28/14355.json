Just imagine, a globe of crystal, gilded all over, the lower part beautifully encrusted, perfumes burning at the top, with jets from which flame issued when they were lighted.”  “I quite understand, but they were not lighted at the time, I suppose?”  “Happily not, or I should have been grilled prematurely.”  “And you were only knocked down flat, instead?”  “Not at all.”  “How, ‘not at all?’”  “Why, the luster fell on my skull. It appears that we have upon the top of our heads an exceedingly thick crust.”  “Who told you that, Porthos?”  “The doctor. A sort of dome which would bear Notre-Dame.”  “Bah!”  “Yes, it seems that our skulls are made in that manner.”  “Speak for yourself, my dear fellow, it is your own skull that is made in that manner, and not the skulls of other people.”  “Well, that may be so,” said Porthos, conceitedly, “so much, however, was that the case, in my instance, that no sooner did the luster fall upon the dome which we have at the top of our head, than there was a report like a cannon, the crystal was broken to pieces, and I fell, covered from head to foot.”  “With blood, poor Porthos!”  “Not at all; with perfumes, which smelt like rich creams; it was delicious, but the odor was too strong, and I felt quite giddy from it; perhaps you have experienced it sometimes yourself, D’Artagnan?”  “Yes, in inhaling the scent of the lily of the valley; so that, my poor friend, you were knocked over by the shock and overpowered by the perfumes?”  “Yes; but what is very remarkable, for the doctor told me he had never seen anything like it--”  “You had a bump on your head I suppose?” interrupted D’Artagnan.  “I had five.”  “Why five?”  “I will tell you; the luster had, at its lower extremity, five gilt ornaments; excessively sharp.”  “Oh!”  “Well, these five ornaments penetrated my hair, which, as you see, I wear very thick.”  “Fortunately so.”  “And they made a mark on my skin. But just notice the singularity of it, these things seem really only to happen to me! Instead of making indentations, they made bumps. The doctor could never succeed in explaining that to me satisfactorily.”  “Well, then, I will explain it to you.”  “You will do me a great service if you will,” said Porthos, winking his eyes, which, with him, was sign of the profoundest attention.  “Since you have been employing your brain in studies of an exalted character, in important calculations, and so on, the head has gained a certain advantage, so that your head is now too full of science.”  “Do you think so?”  “I am sure of it. The result is, that, instead of allowing any foreign matter to penetrate the interior of the head, your bony box or skull, which is already too full, avails itself of the openings which are made in allowing this excess to escape.”  “Ah!” said Porthos, to whom this explanation appeared clearer than that of the doctor.  “The five protuberances, caused by the five ornaments of the luster, must certainly have been scientific globules, brought to the surface by the force of circumstances.”  “In fact,” said Porthos, “the real truth is, that I felt far worse outside my head than inside. I will even confess, that when I put my hat upon my head, clapping it on my head with that graceful energy which we gentlemen of the sword possess, if my fist was not very gently applied, I experienced the most painful sensations.”  “I quite believe you, Porthos.”  “Therefore, my friend,” said the giant, “M. Fouquet decided, seeing how slightly built the house was, to give me another lodging, and so they brought me here.”  “It is the private park, I think, is it not?”  “Yes.”  “Where the rendezvous are made; that park, indeed, which is so celebrated in some of those mysterious stories about the superintendent?”  “I don’t know; I have had no rendezvous or heard mysterious stories myself, but they have authorized me to exercise my muscles, and I take advantage of the permission by rooting up some of the trees.”  “What for?”  “To keep my hand in, and also to take some birds’ nests; I find it more convenient than climbing.”  “You are as pastoral as Tyrcis, my dear Porthos.”  “Yes, I like the small eggs; I like them very much better than larger ones. You have no idea how delicate an _omelette_ is, if made of four or five hundred eggs of linnets, chaffinches, starlings, blackbirds, and thrushes.”  “But five hundred eggs is perfectly monstrous!”  “A salad-bowl will hold them easily enough,” said Porthos.  D’Artagnan looked at Porthos admiringly for full five minutes, as if he had seen him for the first time, while Porthos spread his chest out joyously and proudly. They remained in this state several minutes, Porthos smiling, and D’Artagnan looking at him. D’Artagnan was evidently trying to give the conversation a new turn. “Do you amuse yourself much here, Porthos?” he asked at last, very likely after he had found out what he was searching for.  “Not always.”  “I can imagine that; but when you get thoroughly bored, by and by, what do you intend to do?”  “Oh! I shall not be here for any length of time. Aramis is waiting until the last bump on my head disappears, in order to present me to the king, who I am told cannot endure the sight of a bump.”  “Aramis is still in Paris, then?”  “No.”  “Whereabouts is he, then?”  “At Fontainebleau.”  “Alone?”  “With M. Fouquet.”  “Very good. But do you happen to know one thing?”  “No, tell it me, and then I shall know.”  “Well, then, I think Aramis is forgetting you.”  “Do you really think so?”  “Yes; for at Fontainebleau yonder, you must know, they are laughing, dancing, banqueting, and drawing the corks of M. de Mazarin’s wine in fine style. Are you aware that they have a ballet every evening there?”  “The deuce they have!”  “I assure you that your dear Aramis is forgetting you.”  “Well, that is not at all unlikely, and I have myself thought so sometimes.”  “Unless he is playing you a trick, the sly fellow!”  “Oh!”  “You know that Aramis is as sly as a fox.”  “Yes, but to play _me_ a trick--”  “Listen: in the first place, he puts you under a sort of sequestration.”  “He sequestrates me! Do you mean to say I am sequestrated?”  “I think so.”  “I wish you would have the goodness to prove that to me.”  “Nothing easier. Do you ever go out?”  “Never.”  “Do you ever ride on horseback?”  “Never.”  “Are your friends allowed to come and see you?”  “Never.”  “Very well, then; never to go out, never to ride on horseback, never to be allowed to see your friends, that is called being sequestrated.”  “But why should Aramis sequestrate me?” inquired Porthos.  “Come,” said D’Artagnan, “be frank, Porthos.”  “As gold.”  “It was Aramis who drew the plan of the fortifications at Belle-Isle, was it not?”  Porthos colored as he said, “Yes; but that was all he did.”  “Exactly, and my own opinion is that it was no very great affair after all.”  “That is mine, too.”  “Very good; I am delighted we are of the same opinion.”  “He never even came to Belle-Isle,” said Porthos.  “There now, you see.”  “It was I who went to Vannes, as you may have seen.”  “Say rather, as I did see. Well, that is precisely the state of the case, my dear Porthos. Aramis, who only drew the plans, wishes to pass himself off as the engineer, whilst you, who, stone by stone, built the wall, the citadel, and the bastions, he wishes to reduce to the rank of a mere builder.”  “By builder, you mean mason, perhaps?”  “Mason; the very word.”  “Plasterer, in fact?”  “Hodman?”  “Exactly.”  “Oh, oh! my dear Aramis, you seem to think you are only five and twenty years of age still.”  “Yes, and that is not all, for he believes you are fifty.”  “I should have amazingly liked to have seen him at work.”  “Yes, indeed.”  “A fellow who has got the gout?”  “Yes.”  “Who has lost three of his teeth?”  “Four.”  “While I, look at mine.” And Porthos, opening his large mouth very wide, displayed two rows of teeth not quite as white as snow, but even, hard, and sound as ivory.  “You can hardly believe, Porthos,” said D’Artagnan, “what a fancy the king has for good teeth. Yours decide me; I will present you to the king myself.”  “You?”  “Why not? Do you think I have less credit at court than Aramis?”  “Oh, no!”  “Do you think I have the slightest pretensions upon the fortifications at Belle-Isle?”  “Certainly not.”  “It is your own interest alone which would induce me to do it.”  “I don’t doubt it in the least.”  “Well, I am the intimate friend of the king; and a proof of that is, that whenever there is anything disagreeable to tell him, it is I who have to do it.”  “But, dear D’Artagnan, if you present me--”  “Well!”  “Aramis will be angry.”  “With me?”  “No, with _me_.”  “Bah! whether he or I present you, since you are to be presented, what does it matter?”  “They were going to get me some clothes made.”  “Your own are splendid.”  “Oh! those I had ordered were far more beautiful.”  “Take care: the king likes simplicity.”  “In that case, I will be simple. But what will M. Fouquet say, when he learns that I have left?”  “Are you a prisoner, then, on parole?”  “No, not"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2710"],["title","Louise de la Valliere (#7)"],["body","that. But I promised him I would not leave without letting him know.”  “Wait a minute, we shall return to that presently. Have you anything to do here?”  “I, nothing: nothing of any importance, at least.”  “Unless, indeed, you are Aramis’s representative for something of importance.”  “By no means.”  “What I tell you--pray, understand that--is out of interest for you. I suppose, for instance, that you are commissioned to send messages and letters to him?”  “Ah! letters--yes. I send certain letters to him.”  “Where?”  “To Fontainebleau.”  “Have you any letters, then?”  “But--”  “Nay, let me speak. Have you any letters, I say?”  “I have just received one for him.”  “Interesting?”  “I suppose so.”  “You do not read them, then?”  “I am not at all curious,” said Porthos, as he drew out of his pocket the soldier’s letter which Porthos had not read, but D’Artagnan had.  “Do you know what to do with it?” said D’Artagnan.  “Of course; do as I always do, send it to him.”  “Not so.”  “Why not? Keep it, then?”  “Did they not tell you that this letter was important?”  “Very important.”  “Well, you must take it yourself to Fontainebleau.”  “To Aramis?”  “Yes.”  “Very good.”  “And since the king is there--”  “You will profit by that.”  “I shall profit by the opportunity to present you to the king.”  “Ah! D’Artagnan, there is no one like you for expedients.”  “Therefore, instead of forwarding to our friend any messages, which may or may not be faithfully delivered, we will ourselves be the bearers of the letter.”  “I had never even thought of that, and yet it is simple enough.”  “And therefore, because it is urgent, Porthos, we ought to set off at once.”  “In fact,” said Porthos, “the sooner we set off the less chance there is of Aramis’s letter being delayed.”  “Porthos, your reasoning is always accurate, and, in your case, logic seems to serve as an auxiliary to the imagination.”  “Do you think so?” said Porthos.  “It is the result of your hard reading,” replied D’Artagnan. “So come along, let us be off.”  “But,” said Porthos, “my promise to M. Fouquet?”  “Which?”  “Not to leave Saint-Mande without telling him of it.”  “Ah! Porthos,” said D’Artagnan, “how very young you still are.”  “In what way?”  “You are going to Fontainebleau, are you not, where you will find M. Fouquet?”  “Yes.”  “Probably in the king’s palace?”  “Yes,” repeated Porthos, with an air full of majesty.  “Well, you will accost him with these words: ‘M. Fouquet, I have the honor to inform you that I have just left Saint-Mande.’”  “And,” said Porthos, with the same majestic mien, “seeing me at Fontainebleau at the king’s, M. Fouquet will not be able to tell me I am not speaking the truth.”  “My dear Porthos, I was just on the point of opening my lips to make the same remark, but you anticipate me in everything. Oh! Porthos, how fortunately you are gifted! Years have made not the slightest impression on you.”  “Not over-much, certainly.”  “Then there is nothing more to say?”  “I think not.”  “All your scruples are removed?”  “Quite so.”  “In that case I shall carry you off with me.”  “Exactly; and I will go and get my horse saddled.”  “You have horses here, then?”  “I have five.”  “You had them sent from Pierrefonds, I suppose?”  “No, M. Fouquet gave them to me.”  “My dear Porthos, we shall not want five horses for two persons; besides, I have already three in Paris, which would make eight, and that will be too many.”  “It would not be too many if I had some of my servants here; but, alas! I have not got them.”  “Do you regret them, then?”  “I regret Mousqueton; I miss Mousqueton.”  “What a good-hearted fellow you are, Porthos,” said D’Artagnan; “but the best thing you can do is to leave your horses here, as you have left Mousqueton out yonder.”  “Why so?”  “Because, by and by, it might turn out a very good thing if M. Fouquet had never given you anything at all.”  “I don’t understand you,” said Porthos.  “It is not necessary you should understand.”  “But yet--”  “I will explain to you later, Porthos.”  “I’ll wager it is some piece of policy or other.”  “And of the most subtle character,” returned D’Artagnan.  Porthos nodded his head at this word policy; then, after a moment’s reflection, he added, “I confess, D’Artagnan, that I am no politician.”  “I know that well.”  “Oh! no one knows what you told me yourself, you, the bravest of the brave.”  “What did I tell you, Porthos?”  “That every man has his day. You told me so, and I have experienced it myself. There are certain days when one feels less pleasure than others in exposing one’s self to a bullet or a sword-thrust.”  “Exactly my own idea.”  “And mine, too, although I can hardly believe in blows or thrusts that kill outright.”  “The deuce! and yet you have killed a few in your time.”  “Yes; but I have never been killed.”  “Your reason is a very good one.”  “Therefore, I do not believe I shall ever die from a thrust of a sword or a gun-shot.”  “In that case, then, you are afraid of nothing. Ah! water, perhaps?”  “Oh! I swim like an otter.”  “Of a quartan fever, then?”  “I have never had one yet, and I don’t believe I ever shall; but there is one thing I will admit,” and Porthos dropped his voice.  “What is that?” asked D’Artagnan, adopting the same tone of voice as Porthos.  “I must confess,” repeated Porthos, “that I am horribly afraid of politics.”  “Ah, bah!” exclaimed D’Artagnan.  “Upon my word, it’s true,” said Porthos, in a stentorian voice. “I have seen his eminence Monsieur le Cardinal de Richelieu, and his eminence Monsieur le Cardinal de Mazarin; the one was a red politician, the other a black politician; I never felt very much more satisfied with the one than with the other; the first struck off the heads of M. de Marillac, M. de Thou, M. de Cinq-Mars, M. Chalais, M. de Bouteville, and M. de Montmorency; the second got a whole crowd of Frondeurs cut in pieces, and we belonged to them.”  “On the contrary, we did not belong to them,” said D’Artagnan.  “Oh! indeed, yes; for if I unsheathed my sword for the cardinal, I struck it for the king.”  “My good Porthos!”  “Well, I have done. My dread of politics is such, that if there is any question of politics in the matter, I should greatly prefer to return to Pierrefonds.”  “You would be quite right, if that were the case. But with me, my dear Porthos, no politics at all, that is quite clear. You have labored hard in fortifying Belle-Isle; the king wished to know the name of the clever engineer under whose directions the works were carried out; you are modest, as all men of true genius are; perhaps Aramis wishes to put you under a bushel. But I happen to seize hold of you; I make it known who you are; I produce you; the king rewards you; and that is the only policy I have to do with.”  “And the only one I will have to do with either,” said Porthos, holding out his hand to D’Artagnan.  But D’Artagnan knew Porthos’s grasp; he knew that, once imprisoned within the baron’s five fingers, no hand ever left it without being half-crushed. He therefore held out, not his hand, but his fist, and Porthos did not even perceive the difference. The servants talked a little with each other in an undertone, and whispered a few words, which D’Artagnan understood, but which he took very good care not to let Porthos understand. “Our friend,” he said to himself, “was really and truly Aramis’s prisoner. Let us now see what the result will be of the liberation of the captive.”    Chapter IV. The Rat and the Cheese.  D’Artagnan and Porthos returned on foot, as D’Artagnan had set out. When D’Artagnan, as he entered the shop of the Pilon d’Or, announced to Planchet that M. du Vallon would be one of the privileged travelers, and as the plume in Porthos’s hat made the wooden candles suspended over the front jingle together, a melancholy presentiment seemed to eclipse the delight Planchet had promised himself for the morrow. But the grocer had a heart of gold, ever mindful of the good old times--a trait that carries youth into old age. So Planchet, notwithstanding a sort of internal shiver, checked as soon as experienced, received Porthos with respect, mingled with the tenderest cordiality. Porthos, who was a little cold and stiff in his manners at first, on account of the social difference existing at that period between a baron and a grocer, soon began to soften when he perceived so much good-feeling and so many kind attentions in Planchet. He was particularly touched by the liberty which was permitted him to plunge his great palms into the boxes of dried fruits and preserves, into the sacks of nuts and almonds, and into the drawers full of sweetmeats. So that, notwithstanding Planchet’s pressing invitations to go upstairs to the _entresol_, he chose as his favorite seat, during the evening which he had to spend at Planchet’s house, the shop itself, where his fingers could always fish up whatever his nose detected. The delicious figs from Provence, filberts from the forest, Tours plums, were subjects of his uninterrupted attention for five consecutive hours. His teeth, like millstones, cracked heaps of nuts, the shells of which were scattered all over the floor, where they were trampled by every one who went in and out of the shop; Porthos pulled from the stalk with his lips, at one mouthful, bunches of the rich Muscatel raisins with their beautiful bloom, half a pound of which passed at one gulp from his mouth to his stomach. In one of the corners of the shop, Planchet’s assistants, huddled together, looked at each other without venturing to open their lips. They did not know who Porthos was, for they had never seen him before. The race of those Titans who had worn the cuirasses of Hugh Capet, Philip Augustus, and Francis I. had already begun to disappear. They could hardly help thinking he might be the ogre of the fairy tale, who was going to turn the whole contents of Planchet’s shop into his insatiable stomach, and that, too, without in the slightest degree displacing"]]]
