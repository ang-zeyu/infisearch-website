Constipating Foods: Skim-milk, liquid foods, fine flour     bread, potatoes, tapioca, white of eggs, gluten, mush, cheese     made from skim-milk.     DIET AND HYGIENE FOR BRAIN WORKERS.   Proper growth and activity of the brain and nervous system are promoted by a healthy flow of blood. Pure air and sufficient food properly combined and proportioned are essential. Choose more of the lighter forms of protein and starchy foods, as fish, eggs, almonds, green peas, bacon, a moderate amount of lamb and beef, rice, sago, wheat, and vegetable gelatines. Foods rich in minerals are celery, apples, tomatoes, greens, oranges, and practically all the fresh fruits and vegetables, especially the small berries. Melons and starchy vegetables in large quantities are suitable for muscular workers. Use as little as possible of so-called pure chemical substances, such as refined sugar and flour.  Avoid poisonous beverages, tobacco and all forms of drugs. Sleep at least nine hours in a well ventilated room, facing east or south. Avoid constipation. Combine mental work with moderate amounts of useful and enjoyable exercise and physical work. Protect the eyes from strong artificial light. Keep the feet warm. Relax before and after meals. A certain amount of manual labor is absolutely necessary for the brain-worker. It favors deep breathing and creates a demand for more air and water, and thus improves digestion, oxidation and nutrition. The body poisons are carried off quicker and nervous headaches and despondency are avoided. Short walks out of doors before retiring are very beneficial for people who suffer with cold hands and feet.      Dress by an open fire or in a sunny room. A chill before     breakfast produces indigestion and a desire for unnecessary     hot foods. Never sleep by night lamps or any other artificial     light. They are injurious to the eyes and absorb oxygen.      Avoid fresh breads, inferior cakes and pastry. Do not eat     unless you are hungry. Do not over-indulge in athletic or any     other kind of exercise. Remember that natural feeding, pure     air and sufficient sleep call for natural breathing and     natural exercise. Unnatural feeding and late hours create     disease or nervousness.     \"THE IMMIGRANT.\"   All who leave the land of their birth should make themselves acquainted with the art of living and the peculiarities of the new country in which they intend to live.  To depart entirely from their old customs and habits is as dangerous as to neglect the study of the new environment or the failure to adopt necessary changes.  In some portions of the United States the climatic conditions are very changeable; we have extreme heat and cold, an excess of rain with wind storms and dryness alternating within a short time. West of the Rocky Mountains we have a mild sea air. In the Southern States and near the Pacific Coast we have low districts where malaria and catarrhal conditions are easily acquired.  Tropical fruits and vegetables which are looked upon as luxuries in Northern Europe are necessary articles of food in the country where they grow, therefore the stranger should make himself acquainted with such foods, and by degrees learn to eat them.     TRAINING CHILDREN IN CORRECT HABITS OF EATING.   A child should have his face and hands washed before and after each meal. He should not be allowed to carry foodstuffs and candy about the house, or touch carpets and furniture with sticky and greasy fingers. If he requires food between meals, give him four or five meals per day, but have him eat his food in the proper place.  The breeding of flies, mosquitoes and other disease carriers is greatly favored by allowing children to eat at any and all times without napkins, or special preservation of their dress, or without cleaning their hands before and after eating, or before and after playing with animals and pets.  The American child is given too much consideration at the table. There is a great difference between the saying \"I don't like a certain food\" and \"I don't want it,\" because there are things which taste better.  To leave one's plate half full of foodstuffs and ask for, or accept, other food is customary, but before the law of our Creator it is unclean and disrespectful, wasteful and dangerous.  The physiological laws of our bodies are based on very economical plans: nature utilizes everything and wastes nothing. Cooked foodstuffs, whether they are wasted within our bodies by over-indulgence, or in the garbage can, create decomposition and germs.     MENUS FOR DINNER FOR YOUNG CHILDREN.        1. One-half orange, one ounce boiled fish, one-half of an apple,         toast.      2. One-half of an apple, one or two eggs, one to two tablespoons         raw rylax.      3. Cereal salad with carrots and fish.      4. Legume soup, butter and bread, raw carrots.      5. Well boiled macaroni, two tablespoons of cold grated cheese.      6. Light rice with cold grated Swiss cheese.      7. Cereal salad with apple and eggs.      8. Lettuce, baked potatoes, beachnut bacon and one egg.      9. Mashed carrots,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27245"],["title","Food for the Traveler (#3)"],["body"," two tablespoons of young peas, bacon.     10. String beans with stale bread and butter, bacon and egg.     11. Finely chopped spinach, bacon, egg, stale bread, butter.     12. Three to five cherries, light omelet, lettuce.     13. Cereal salad with apples, two to three tablespoons of cottage         cheese.     14. Baked oats with prunes or cranberry sauce and bacon.     15. Whole wheat with sterilized cream and celery.     16. Peach and cereal salad, beachnut bacon and one egg.     17. Baked potato greens, meat, egg or fish.     18. Legume puree or soup, carrots, bacon.  Legumes are a very important food for young children, and their use should begin during the second year. They are easily digested if prepared in the form of soups and purees, and combined as directed in the different menus. They should not be given at night.      Mothers of girls should think it more important to furnish     healthful exercise, wholesome food and restful sleep during     the years of budding womanhood, than to worry about lessons     in music and art, or a business education. All these can be     taken up with much greater benefit after maturity. Arrested     development of the organs of reproduction will lay the     foundation for many years of unhappiness and suffering.      Many parents are impressed with the idea that their children     require a large amount of sweets, in order to make them grow.     We cannot force nature without paying the penalty. At     maturity, we reap what has been sown for us, or what we have     sown for ourselves.     MEMORANDUM     Prevention of Disease, Insanity and Crime  CONTENTS: Wet or Dry?

Paper, $1.00; postpaid, $1.10   EXTRACTS FROM REVIEWS AND LETTERS      Your book, \"The Epicure of Medicine,\" is worth its weight in     gold.            DR. F. SCHURMANN, Honolulu, T. H. (The Schurmann Institute).      A knowledge based on such experience is worthy of the     profoundest consideration. This accounts for the sincerity of     the mode of writing.                                 DR. AXEL EMIL GIBSON, Los Angeles, Cal.      The book is interesting and has value. The author's account     of her own struggles with disease leads one to wonder how she     could be alive and able to write a book. Few such struggles     have ever been recorded. It is interesting to follow the     author in her account of the combats she has had with the     disease. There are many new and strange teachings in the book     of which we shall express no opinion.                                 THE THERAPEUTIC RECORD, Louisville, Ky.      The study of the book shows that the author, like many     American physicians, is not a staunch believer in \"drug     cures,\" but considers that spiritual, mental and physical     healing applied in the natural way are the only means to     produce chemical changes within our bodies.                                       PRACTICAL MEDICINE, Delhi, India.      After a careful reading and understanding of DR. ROPER'S new     work, I can heartily endorse her efforts to bring the right     style of living before the people. Such a work as this seems     a blessing to humanity.      MRS. LOTTIE HALL, Pres. of Lincoln School Mothers' Club, Berkeley.      The only cook book which I have seen, which gives the proper     chemical combinations for each meal of the day.                                      MRS. ESTHER TALBOTT, Oakland, Cal.      Your book deserves to be circulated by the millions. Our club     would consider it a favor if you could give us a lecture and     demonstration on nutritious soups.                                    MRS. IDA HOUGHTALING, Berkeley, Cal.      \"Scientific Feeding\" is an open door to health. After being     under the care and supervision of DR. ROPER for two months I     feel confident that she has knowledge which leads to health     through right living.             MISS ELISABETH JEWETT, Kindergarten Director, Cleveland, O.      Your book is a regular gold mine. I particularly like the     chapter, \"Study of Food.\" A copy should be in every school     library.
