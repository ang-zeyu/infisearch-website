Pollio is further credited, by Suetonius, with having built an _atrium libertatis_[28], in which Isidore, a writer of the seventh century, probably quoting a lost work of Suetonius, places the library, with the additional information, that the collection contained Greek as well as Latin books[29].  The work of Pollio is recorded among the acts of generosity which Augustus suggested to others. But before long the emperor turned his own attention to libraries, and enriched his capital with two splendid structures which may be taken as types of Roman libraries,--the library of Apollo on the Palatine Hill, and that in the Campus Martius called after Octavia, sister to the emperor. I will take the latter first.  The _Porticus Octaviæ_, or, as it was sometimes called, the _Opera Octaviæ_, must have been one of the most magnificent structures in Rome (fig. 3). It stood in the Campus Martius, near the Theatre of Marcellus, between the Capitoline Hill and the Tiber. A double colonnade surrounded an area which measured 443 feet by 377 feet, with _Jani_, or four-faced archways, at the four corners, and on the side next the Tiber a double hexastyle porch, which, with a few fragments of the colonnade, still exists in a fairly good state of preservation[30]. Within this space were two temples, one of Jupiter, the other of Juno, a _curia_ or hall, in which the Senate frequently met, a _schola_ or \"Conversation Hall[31],\" and two libraries, the one of Greek, the other of Latin books. The area and buildings were crowded with masterpieces in bronze and marble.  [Illustration: Fig. 3. Plan of the Porticus Octaviæ, Rome. From _Formæ Urbis Romæ Antiqua_, Berlin, 1896.]  This structure was originally built by Quintus Metellus, about 146 B.C.[32]. One of the temples was due to his own liberality, the other had been erected by Domitius Lepidus, B.C. 179. Now twenty years before, Metellus had fought in a successful campaign against Perseus king of Macedonia, in which the Romans had been assisted by Eumenes II.: and in B.C. 148, as Prætor, he received Macedonia as his province. Is it not possible that on one or other of these occasions he may have visited Pergamon, and, when designing his buildings in Rome, have copied what he had seen there? Again, in B.C. 157, Crates of Mallus, a distinguished grammarian, was sent from Pergamon as ambassador to Rome, and, being laid up there by an accident, gave lectures on grammar, in the course of which he could hardly have failed to mention the new library[33].  The buildings of Metellus were altered, if not entirely rebuilt, by Augustus, B.C. 33, out of the proceeds of his victorious campaign against the Dalmatians; with the additional structures above enumerated. The _schola_ is believed to have stood behind the temples, and the libraries behind the _schola_, with the _curia_ between them[34]. Thus the colonnades, which Metellus had restricted to the two temples, came at last to serve the double purpose for which they were originally intended in connexion with a library as well as with a temple.  The temple and area of Apollo on the Palatine Hill, which Augustus began B.C. 36 and dedicated B.C. 28, exhibit an arrangement precisely similar to that of the Porticus Octaviæ. The size was nearly the same[35], and the structures included in the area were intended to serve the same purposes. The temple stood in the middle of a large open peristyle, connected with which were two libraries, one for Greek, the other for Latin books; and between them, used perhaps as a reading-room or vestibule, was a hall in which Augustus occasionally convened the Senate. It contained a colossal statue of Apollo, made of gilt bronze; and on its walls were portrait-reliefs of celebrated writers, in the form of medallions, in the same material[36].  Of the other public libraries of Rome--of which there are said to have been in all twenty-six--I need mention only three as possessing some peculiarity to which I shall have to draw attention. Of these the first was established by Tiberius in his palace, at no great distance from the library of Apollo; the second and third by Vespasian and Trajan in their Fora, connected in the one with the temple of Peace, and in the other with the temple dedicated in honour of Trajan himself.  [Illustration: Fig. 4. Plan of the Forum of Trajan; after Nibby.]  Of the first two of these libraries we have no information; but in the case of the third we are more fortunate. The Forum of Trajan (fig. 4) was excavated by order of Napoleon I., and the extent of its buildings, with their relation to one another, is therefore known with approximate accuracy. The Greek and Latin libraries stood to the right and left of the small court between the _Basilica Ulpia_ and the _Templum Divi Trajani_, the centre of which was marked by the existing Column. They were entered from this court, each through a portico of five inter-columniations. The rooms, measured internally, were about 60 feet long, by 45 feet broad.  At this point I must mention, parenthetically, the library built by Hadrian at Athens. Pausanias records it in the following passage:      Hadrian also built for the Athenians a temple of Hera     and Panhellenian Zeus, and a sanctuary common to all the     gods. But most splendid of all are one hundred columns;     walls and colonnades alike are made of Phrygian marble.     Here, too, is a building adorned with a gilded roof and     alabaster and also with statues and paintings: books are     stored in it. There is also a gymnasium named after     Hadrian; it too has one hundred columns from the     quarries of Libya[37].  A building called the Stoa of Hadrian, a ground-plan of which (fig. 5) I borrow from Miss Harrison's _Mythology and Monuments of Ancient Athens_, has been identified with part at least of that which Pausanias describes in the above passage. A lofty wall, built of large square blocks of Pentelic marble, faced on the west side by a row of Corinthian columns, enclosed a quadrangular court, measuring 328 feet from east to west, by 250 feet from north to south. This court, entered through a sort of propylæa on the west side (N), was surrounded by a cloister or colonnade 27 feet wide, and containing 100 columns. None of those columns are standing, but their number can be accurately calculated from the marks of the bases still to be seen on the eastern side of the quadrangle.  Within this area are the remains of a building of uncertain use, and at present only partially excavated.  On the east side a row of five chambers, of which that in the centre was the largest, opened off from the colonnade[38].  [Illustration: Fig. 5. Plan of the Stoa of Hadrian, at Athens.    AE, KI. Pier-arcade of the medieval church of the Panagia.   B. North-east angle of this church, of Roman work.   B, C, D, F. Portions of the Roman building which preceded the church.   L, M. Reservoirs.   N. Propylæa through which the court was entered.  ]  If the ground plan of this structure (fig. 5) be compared with that of the precinct of Athena and library at Pergamon (fig. 2), a striking similarity between them will at once be recognised; and, whatever may have been the destination of the building within the cloistered area, there can, I think, be little doubt that the library was contained in the five rooms beyond its limits to the east. They must have been entered from the cloister, much as those at Pergamon were. It is possible that Hadrian may himself have visited Pergamon, for Trajan had built an imperial residence there; but, even if he did not do this, he would accept the type from the great libraries built at Rome by Augustus. It should be mentioned that S. Jerome specially commemorates this library among Hadrian's works at Athens, and says that it was of remarkable construction (_miri operis_)[39].  From this brief digression I return to the public libraries of Rome. In the first place those built by Augustus had a regular organisation. There appears to have been a general director called _Procurator Bibliothecarum Augusti_[40]; and subordinate officers for each division: that is to say, one for the Greek books, one for the Latin books. These facts are derived from inscriptions found in _Columbaria_. Secondly, it may be concluded that they were used not merely for reading and reference, but as meeting-places for literary men.  The Palatine libraries evidently contained a large collection of old and new books; and I think it is quite certain that new books, as soon as published, were placed there, unless there was some special reason to the contrary. Otherwise there would be no point in the lines in which Ovid makes his book--sent from Pontus after his banishment--deplore its exclusion. The book is supposed to climb from the Forum to the temple of Apollo:    Signa peregrinis ubi sunt alterna columnis     Belides et stricto barbarus ense pater   Quæque viri docto veteres coepere novique     Pectore lecturis inspicienda patent.   Quærebam fratres exceptis scilicet illis     Quos suus optaret non genuisse parens;   Quærentem frustra custos e sedibus illis     Præpositus sancto iussit abire loco[41].      Where, set between each pair of columns from some     foreign quarry, are statues of the Danaids, and their     barbarous father with drawn sword; and where whatever     the minds of men of old or men of to-day have imagined,     is laid open for a reader's use. I sought my brethren,     save those of course whom their father would fain have     never begotten; and, while I was seeking for them in     vain, he who was set over the room bade me leave that     holy ground.  The second couplet can only mean that old books and new books were alike to be found there. The general nature of the collection, and its extent, may be further gathered from the advice which Horace"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26378"],["title","The Care of Books (#6)"],["body"," to his friend Celsus:    Quid mihi Celsus agit? monitus multumque monendus   Privatas ut quærat opes, et tangere vitet   Scripta Palatinus quæcunque recepit Apollo[42].      What is my friend Celsus about? he who has been     reminded, and must still be reminded again and again,     that he should draw upon his own resources, and be     careful to avoid the multifarious writings which     Palatine Apollo has taken under his charge.  A man might say now-a-days, \"Trust to your own wits, and don't go so often to the library of the British Museum.\"  Aulus Gellius, who lived A.D. 117-180, speaks of \"sitting with a party of friends in the library of the palace of Tiberius, when a book happened to be taken down with the title M. Catonis Nepotis,\" and they began asking one another who this M. Cato Nepos might be[43]. This library contained also public records[44].  The same writer tells a story of a grammatical difficulty which was to be settled by reference to a book _in templo Pacis_, in the forum of Vespasian; and again, when a particular book was wanted, \"we hunted for it diligently,\" he says, \"and, when we had found it in the temple of Peace, we read it[45].\"  The library in the forum of Trajan, often called _Bibliotheca Ulpia_, was apparently the Public Record Office of Rome. Aulus Gellius mentions that some decrees of former prætors had fallen in his way there when he was looking for something else, and that he had been allowed to read them[46]; and a statement of Vopiscus is still more conclusive as to the nature of its contents. It tells us, moreover, something about the arrangement. In his life of the Emperor Tacitus (Sept. A.D. 275--Apr. 276) Vopiscus says:      And lest anybody should think that I have given too     hasty a credence to a Greek or Latin author, the Ulpian     Library has in its sixth press (_armarium_) an ivory     volume (_librum elephantinum_) in which the following     decree of the Senate, signed by Tacitus with his own     hand, is recorded, etc.[47]  Again, in his life of the Emperor Aurelian, the same writer records how his friend Junius Tiberianus, prefect of the city, had urged him to undertake the task, and had assured him that: \"even the linen-books (_libri lintei_) shall be brought out of the Ulpian library for your use[48].\"  Books could occasionally be borrowed from a public library, but whether from one of those in the city of Rome, I cannot say. The scene of the story which proves this is laid by Aulus Gellius at Tibur (Tivoli), where the library was in the temple of Hercules--another instance of the care of a library being entrusted to a temple. Aulus Gellius and some friends of his were assembled in a rich man's villa there at the hottest season of the year. They were drinking melted snow, a proceeding against which one of the party, a peripatetic philosopher, vehemently protested, urging against the practice the authority of numerous physicians and of Aristotle himself. But none the less the party went on drinking snow-water. Whereupon \"he fetched a treatise by Aristotle out of the library of Tibur, which was then very conveniently accommodated in the temple of Hercules, and brought it to us, saying----[49].\" But I need not finish the quotation, as it has no bearing on my special subject.  It is probable that numerous collections of books had been got together by individuals in Rome, before it occurred to Augustus and his friends to erect public libraries. One such library, that belonging to the rich and luxurious Lucullus, has been noticed as follows by Plutarch[50]:      His procedure in regard to books was interesting and     remarkable. He collected fine copies in large numbers;     and if he was splendid in their acquisition, he was more     so in their use. His libraries were accessible to all,     and the adjoining colonnades and reading-rooms were     freely open to Greeks, who, gladly escaping from the     routine of business, resorted thither for familiar     converse, as to a shelter presided over by the Muses.  The Romans were not slow in following the example set by Lucullus; and a library presently became indispensable in every house, whether the owner cared for reading or not. This fashionable craze is denounced by Seneca (writing about A.D. 49) in a vehement outburst of indignation, which contains so many valuable facts about library arrangement, that I will give a free translation of it.      Outlay upon studies, best of all outlays, is reasonable     so long only as it is kept within certain limits. What     is the use of books and libraries innumerable, if scarce     in a lifetime the master reads the titles? A student is     burdened by a crowd of authors, not instructed; and it     is far better to devote yourself to a few, than to lose     your way among a multitude.      Forty thousand books were burnt at Alexandria. I leave     others to praise this splendid monument of royal     opulence, as for example Livy, who regards it as \"a     noble work of royal taste and royal thoughtfulness.\" It     was not taste, it was not thoughtfulness, it was learned     extravagance--nay not even learned, for they had bought     their books for the sake of show, not for the sake of     learning--just as with many who are ignorant even of the     lowest branches of learning books are not instruments of     study, but ornaments of dining-rooms. Procure then as     many books as will suffice for use; but not a single one     for show. You will reply: \"Outlay on such objects is     preferable to extravagance on plate or paintings.\"     Excess in all directions is bad. Why should you excuse a     man who wishes to possess book-presses inlaid with     _arbor-vitæ_ wood or ivory: who gathers together masses     of authors either unknown or discredited; who yawns     among his thousands of books; and who derives his chief     delight from their edges and their tickets?      You will find then in the libraries of the most arrant     idlers all that orators or historians have     written--book-cases built up as high as the ceiling.     Nowadays a library takes rank with a bathroom as a     necessary ornament of a house. I could forgive such     ideas, if they were due to extravagant desire for     learning. As it is, these productions of men whose     genius we revere, paid for at a high price, with their     portraits ranged in line above them, are got together to     adorn and beautify a wall[51].  A library was discovered in Rome by Signor Lanciani in 1883 while excavating a house of the 4th century on the Esquiline in the modern Via dello Statuto. I will narrate the discovery in his own words.      I was struck, one afternoon, with the appearance of a     rather spacious hall [it was about 23 feet long by 15     feet broad], the walls of which were plain and     unornamented up to a certain height, but beautifully     decorated above in stucco-work. The decoration consisted     of fluted pilasters, five feet apart from centre to     centre, enclosing a plain square surface, in the middle     of which there were medallions, also in stucco-work, two     feet in diameter. As always happens in these cases, the     frame was the only well-preserved portion of the     medallions. Of the images surrounded by the frames, of     the medallions themselves, absolutely nothing was left     _in situ_, except a few fragments piled up at the foot     of the wall, which, however, could be identified as     having been representations of human faces. My hope     that, at last, after fifteen years of excavations, I had     succeeded in discovering a library, was confirmed beyond     any doubt by a legend, written, or rather painted, in     bright red colour on one of the frames. There was but     one name POLONIVS THYAN ..., but this name told more     plainly the purpose of the apartment than if I had     discovered there the actual bookshelves and their     contents[52].  When I had the pleasure of meeting Signor Lanciani in Rome in April, 1898, he most kindly gave me his own sketch of the pilasters and medallion, taken at the moment of discovery. I am therefore able to reproduce exactly (fig. 6) one compartment of the wall of the library above described. The height of the blank wall below the stucco-work, against which the furniture containing the books stood, has been laid down as about 3 feet 6 inches, on the authority of Professor Middleton[53]. The remains of the medallion are still to be seen in the Museo del Orto Botanico, Rome. The person commemorated is obviously Apollonius Tyaneus, a Pythagorean philosopher and wonderworker, said to have been born about four years before the Christian era.  [Illustration: Fig. 6. Elevation of a single compartment of the wall of the Library discovered in Rome, 1883.  From notes and measurements made by Signor Lanciani and Prof. Middleton.]  A similar room was discovered at Herculaneum in 1754. A full account of the discovery was drawn up at once by Signor Paderni, keeper of the Herculaneum Museum, and addressed to Thomas Hollis, Esq., by whom it was submitted to the Royal Society. I will extract, from this and subsequent letters, the passages that bear upon my subject.                                      _Naples, 27 April, 1754._      ... The place where they are digging, at present, is     under _Il Bosco di Sant' Agostino_.... All the buildings     discover'd in this site are noble; ... in one there has     been found an entire library, compos'd of volumes of the     Egyptian Papyrus, of which there have been taken out     about 250....[54]                     _To the same._                                           _18 October, 1754._      ... As yet we have only entered into one room, the floor     of which is formed of mosaic work, not unelegant. It     appears to have been a library, adorned with presses,     inlaid with different sorts of wood, disposed in rows;     at the top of which were cornices, as in our own times.      I was"]]]
