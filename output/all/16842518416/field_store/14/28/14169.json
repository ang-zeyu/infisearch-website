Reports received this moment are that Banks is fighting with Ewell eight miles from Winchester.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL McDOWELL.  WAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D.C., May 24, 1862  MAJOR-GENERAL I. McDOWELL:  I am highly gratified by your alacrity in obeying my order. The change was as painful to me as it can possibly be to you or to any one. Everything now depends upon the celerity and vigor of your movement.   A. LINCOLN     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. W. GEARY.  WAR DEPARTMENT, May 25, 1862 1.45 P.M.  GENERAL GEARY, White Plains:  Please give us your best present impression as to the number of the enemy's forces north of Strasburg and Front Royal. Are the forces still moving north through the gap at Front Royal and between you and there?   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.  WASHINGTON, May 25, 1862. 2 P.M.  MAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:  The enemy is moving north in sufficient force to drive General Banks before him--precisely in what force we cannot tell. He is also threatening Leesburg and Geary, on the Manassas Gap railroad, from both north and south--in precisely what force we cannot tell. I think the movement is a general and concerted one, such as would not be if he was acting upon the purpose of a very desperate defense of Richmond. I think the time is near when you must either attack Richmond or give up the job and come to the defense of Washington. Let me hear from you instantly.   A. LINCOLN, President.     ORDER TAKING MILITARY POSSESSION OF RAILROADS.  WAR DEPARTMENT, May 25, 1862.  Ordered: By virtue of the authority vested by act of Congress, the President takes military possession of all the railroads in the United States from and after this date until further order, and directs that the respective railroad companies, their officers and servants, shall hold themselves in readiness for the transportation of such troops and munitions of war as may be ordered by the military authorities, to the exclusion of all other business.  By order of the Secretary of War.  M. C. MEIGS     TELEGRAM TO SECRETARY CHASE.  WAR DEPARTMENT, May 25, 1862.  SECRETARY CHASE, Fredericksburg, Virginia:  It now appears that Banks got safely into Winchester last night, and is this morning retreating on Harper's Ferry. This justifies the inference that he is pressed by numbers superior to his own. I think it not improbable that Ewell, Jackson, and Johnson are pouring through the gap they made day before yesterday at Front Royal, making a dash northward. It will be a very valuable and very honorable service for General McDowell to cut them off. I hope he will put all possible energy and speed into the effort.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL R. SAXTON.  WAR DEPARTMENT, May 25, 1862.  GENERAL SAXTON, Harper's Ferry:  If Banks reaches Martinsburg, is he any the better for it? Will not the enemy cut him from thence to Harper's Ferry? Have you sent anything to meet him and assist him at Martinsburg? This is an inquiry, not an order.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL R. SAXTON.  WAR DEPARTMENT, May 25, 1862. 6.30 P.M.  GENERAL SAXTON, Harper's Ferry:  One good six-gun battery, complete in its men and appointments, is now on its way to you from Baltimore. Eleven other guns, of different sorts, are on their way to you from here. Hope they will all reach you before morning. As you have but 2500 men at Harper's Ferry, where are the rest which were in that vicinity and which we have sent forward? Have any of them been cut off?   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL R. SAXTON.  WAR DEPARTMENT, May 25, 1862.  GENERAL SAXTON, Harper's Ferry:  I fear you have mistaken me. I did not mean to question the correctness of your conduct; on the contrary! I approve what you have done. As the 2500 reported by you seemed small to me, I feared some had got to Banks and been cut off with him. Please tell me the exact number you now have in hand.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.  [Sent in cipher.]  WAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D. C., May 25,1862. 8.30 P.M.  MAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:  Your despatch received. General Banks was at Strasburg, with about 6,000 men, Shields having been taken from him to swell a column for McDowell to aid you at Richmond, and the rest of his force scattered at various places. On the 23d a rebel force of 7000 to 10,000 fell upon one regiment and two companies guarding the bridge at Front Royal, destroying it entirely; crossed the Shenandoah, and on the 24th (yesterday) pushed to get north of Banks, on the road to Winchester. Banks ran a race with them, beating them into Winchester yesterday evening. This morning a battle ensued between the two forces, in which Banks was beaten back into full retreat toward Martinsburg, and probably is broken up into a total rout. Geary, on the Manassas Gap railroad, just now reports that Jackson is now near Front Royal, With 10,000, following up and supporting, as I understand, the forces now pursuing Banks, also that another force of 10,000 is near Orleans, following on in the same direction. Stripped here, as we are here, it will be all we can do to prevent them crossing the Potomac at Harper's Ferry or above. We have about 20,000 of McDowell's force moving back to the vicinity of Front Royal, and General Fremont, who was at Franklin, is moving to Harrisonburg; both these movements intended to get in the enemy's rear.  One more of McDowell's brigades is ordered through here to Harper's Ferry; the rest of his force remains for the present at Fredericksburg. We are sending such regiments and dribs from here and Baltimore as we can spare to Harper's Ferry, supplying their places in some sort by calling in militia from the adjacent States. We also have eighteen cannon on the road to Harper's Ferry, of which arm there is not a single one yet at that point. This is now our situation.  If McDowell's force was now beyond our reach, we should be utterly helpless. Apprehension of something like this, and no unwillingness to sustain you, has always been my reason for withholding McDowell's force from you. Please understand this, and do the best you can with the force you have.   A. LINCOLN.     HISTORY OF CONSPIRACY OF REBELLION  MESSAGE TO CONGRESS.  MAY 16, 1862  TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:  The insurrection which is yet existing in the United States and aims at the overthrow of the Federal Constitution and the Union, was clandestinely prepared during the Winter of 1860 and 1861, and assumed an open organization in the form of a treasonable provisional government at Montgomery, in Alabama on the 18th day of February, 1861. On the 12th day of April, 1861, the insurgents committed the flagrant act of civil war by the bombardment and the capture of Fort Sumter, Which cut off the hope of immediate conciliation. Immediately afterward all the roads and avenues to this city were obstructed, and the capital was put into the condition of a siege. The mails in every direction were stopped and the lines of telegraph cut off by the insurgents, and military and naval forces which had been called out by the government for the defense of Washington were prevented from reaching the city by organized and combined treasonable resistance in the State of Maryland. There was no adequate and effective organization for the public defense. Congress had indefinitely adjourned. There was no time to convene them. It became necessary for me to choose whether, using only the existing means, agencies, and processes which Congress had provided, I should let the government fall at once into ruin or whether, availing myself of the broader powers conferred by the Constitution in cases of insurrection, I would make an effort to save it, with all its blessings, for the present age and for posterity.  I thereupon summoned my constitutional advisers, the heads of all the departments, to meet on Sunday, the 20th day of April, 1861, at the office of the Navy Department, and then and there, with their unanimous concurrence, I directed that an armed revenue cutter should proceed to sea to afford protection to the commercial marine, and especially the California treasure ships then on their way to this coast. I also directed the commandant of the navy-yard at Boston to purchase or charter and arm as quickly as possible five steamships for purposes of public defense. I directed the commandant of the navy-yard at Philadelphia to purchase or charter and arm an equal number for the same purpose. I directed the commandant at New York to purchase or charter and arm an equal number. I directed Commander Gillis to purchase or charter and arm and put to sea two other vessels. Similar directions were given to Commodore Dupont, with a view to the opening of passages by water to and from the capital. I directed the several officers to take the advice and obtain the aid and efficient services, in the matter, of his Excellency Edwin D. Morgan, the Governor of New York, or in his absence George D. Morgan, William M. Evarts, R. M. Blatchford, and Moses H. Grinnell, who were by my directions especially empowered by the Secretary of the Navy to act for his department in that crisis in matters pertaining to the forwarding of troops and supplies for the public defense.  The several departments of the government at that time contained so large a number of disloyal persons that it would have been impossible to provide safely through official agents only for the performance of the duties thus confided to citizens favorably known for their ability, loyalty, and patriotism.  The several orders issued upon these occurrences were transmitted by private messengers, who pursued a circuitous way to the seaboard cities, inland across the States of Pennsylvania and Ohio and the northern lakes. I believe by these and other similar measures taken in that crisis, some of which were without any authority of law, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2658"],["title","The Papers and Writings of Abraham Lincoln — Volume 6: 1862-1863 (#3)"],["body","government was saved from overthrow. I am not aware that a dollar of the public funds thus confided without authority of law to unofficial persons was either lost or wasted, although apprehensions of such misdirection occurred to me as objections to those extraordinary proceedings, and were necessarily overruled.  I recall these transactions now because my attention has been directed to a resolution which was passed by the House of Representatives on the 30th day of last month, which is in these words:  \"Resolved, That Simon Cameron, late Secretary of War by investing Alexander Cummings with the control of large sums of the public money and authority to purchase military supplies without restriction, without requiring from him any guaranty for the faithful performance of his duties, when the services of competent public officers were available, and by involving the government in a vast number of contracts with persons not legitimately engaged in the business pertaining to the subject-matter of such contracts, especially in the purchase of arms for future delivery, has adopted a policy highly injurious to the public service, and deserves the censure of the House.\"  Congress will see that I should be wanting equally in candor and in justice if I should leave the censure expressed in this resolution to rest exclusively or chiefly upon Mr. Cameron. The same sentiment is unanimously entertained by the heads of department who participated in the proceedings which the House of Representatives have censured. It is due to Mr. Cameron to say that although he fully approved the proceedings they were not moved nor suggested by himself, and that not only the President, but all the other heads of departments, were at least equally responsible with him for whatever error, wrong, or fault was committed in the premises.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.  WASHINGTON, May 26, 1862. 12.40  MAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:  We have General Banks's official report. He has saved his army and baggage, and has made a safe retreat to the river, and is probably safe at Williamsport. He reports the attacking force at 15,000.   A. LINCOLN, President.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL I. McDOWELL.  WAR DEPARTMENT, May 26, 1862. 1 P.M.  MAJOR-GENERAL McDOWELL, Falmouth, Virginia:  Despatches from Geary just received have been sent you. Should not the remainder of your forces, except sufficient to hold the point at Fredericksburg, move this way--to Manassas Junction or Alexandria? As commander of this department, should you not be here? I ask these questions.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL McCLELLAN.  WASHINGTON, May 26, 1862.  MAJOR-GENERAL GEORGE B. McCLELLAN:  Can you not cut the Alula Creek railroad? Also, what impression have you as to intrenched works for you to contend with in front of Richmond? Can you get near enough to throw shells into the city?   A. LINCOLN, President.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. C. FREMONT.  May 27.1862. 9.58 P.M.  MAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT:  I see that you are at Moorefield. You were expressly ordered to march to Harrisonburg. What does this mean?   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM FROM SECRETARY STANTON TO GOVERNOR ANDREW.  WASHINGTON, May 27, 1862.  GOVERNOR ANDREW, Boston:  The President directs that the militia be relieved, and the enlistments made for three years, or during the war. This, I think, will practically not be longer than for a year. The latest intelligence from General Banks states that he has saved nearly his whole command with small loss.  Concentrations of our force have been made, which it is hoped will capture the enemy.  EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.     TELEGRAM FROM SECRETARY STANTON TO GENERAL J. C. FREMONT,  WASHINGTON, May 28, 1862  MAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT, Moorefield  The President directs you to halt at Moorefield and await orders, unless you hear of the enemy being in the general direction of Rodney, in which case you will move upon him. Acknowledge the receipt of this order, and the hour it is received.  EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL I. McDOWELL.  WASHINGTON, May 28, 1862.  GENERAL McDOWELL, Manassas Junction:  General McClellan at 6.30 P.M. yesterday telegraphed that Fitz-John Porter's division had fought and driven 13,000 of the enemy, under General Branch, from Hanover Court-House, and was driving them from a stand they had made on the railroad at the time the messenger left. Two hours later he telegraphed that Stoneman had captured an engine and six cars on the Virginia Central, which he at once sent to communicate with Porter. Nothing further from McClellan.  If Porter effects a lodgment on both railroads near Hanover Court-House, consider whether your forces in front of Fredericksburg should not push through and join him.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.  WASHINGTON, May 28, 1862.  MAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:  What of F.J. Porter's expedition? Please answer.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL I. McDOWELL.  WASHINGTON. May 28, 1862. 4 P.M.  GENERAL McDOWELL, Manassas Junction:  You say General Geary's scouts report that they find no enemy this side of the Blue Ridge. Neither do I. Have they been to the Blue Ridge looking for them.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL I. McDOWELL.  WASHINGTON, May 28, 1862. 5.40 P.M.  GENERAL McDOWELL, Manassas Junction:  I think the evidence now preponderates that Ewell and Jackson are still about Winchester. Assuming this, it is for you a question of legs. Put in all the speed you can. I have told Fremont as much, and directed him to drive at them as fast as possible. By the way, I suppose you know Fremont has got up to Moorefield, instead of going into Harrisonburg.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN  WASHINGTON May 28, 1862. 8.40 P.M.  MAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:  I am very glad of General F. J. Porter's victory. Still, if it was a total rout of the enemy, I am puzzled to know why the Richmond and Fredericksburg railroad was not seized again, as you say you have all the railroads but the Richmond and Fredericksburg. I am puzzled to see how, lacking that, you can have any, except the scrap from Richmond to West Point. The scrap of the Virginia Central from Richmond to Hanover Junction, without more, is simply nothing. That the whole of the enemy is concentrating on Richmond, I think cannot be certainly known to you or me. Saxton, at Harper's Ferry informs us that large forces, supposed to be Jackson's and Ewells, forced his advance from Charlestown today. General King telegraphs us from Fredericksburg that contrabands give certain information that 15,000 left Hanover Junction Monday morning to reinforce Jackson. I am painfully impressed with the importance of the struggle before you, and shall aid you all I can consistently with my view of due regard to all points.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM FROM SECRETARY STANTON TO GENERAL FREMONT.  WASHINGTON, May 28, 1862.  MAJOR-GENERAL JOHN C. FREMONT, Moorefield:  The order to remain at Moorefield was based on the supposition that it would find you there.  Upon subsequent information that the enemy were still operating in the vicinity of Winchester and Martinsburg, you were directed to move against the enemy.  The President now again directs you to move against the enemy without delay. Please acknowledge the receipt of this, and the time received.  EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL MARCY.  WASHINGTON, May 29, 1862. 10 A.M.  GENERAL R. B. MARCY, McClellan's Headquarters:  Yours just received. I think it cannot be certainly known whether the force which fought General Porter is the same which recently confronted McDowell. Another item of evidence bearing on it is that General Branch commanded against Porter, while it was General Anderson who was in front of McDowell. He and McDowell were in correspondence about prisoners.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.  WAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D. C., May 29, 1862. 10.30 A.M.  MAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:  I think we shall be able within three days to tell you certainly whether any considerable force of the enemy--Jackson or any one else--is moving on to Harper's Ferry or vicinity. Take this expected development into your calculations.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL N. P. BANKS.  WASHINGTON, May 29, 1862.  MAJOR-GENERAL BANKS, Williamsport, Maryland:  General McDowell's advance should, and probably will, be at or near Front Royal at twelve (noon) tomorrow. General Fremont will be at or near Strasburg as soon. Please watch the enemy closely, and follow and harass and detain him if he attempts to retire. I mean this for General Saxton's force as well as that immediately with you.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL FREMONT  WASHINGTON, May 29, 1862. 12 M.  MAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT, Moorefield, Virginia:  General McDowell's advance, if not checked by the enemy, should, and probably will, be at Front Royal by twelve (noon) to-morrow. His force, when up, will be about 20,000. Please have your force at Strasburg, or, if the route you are moving on does not lead to that point, as near Strasburg as the enemy may be by the same time. Your despatch No.30 received and satisfactory.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL I. McDOWELL.  WASHINGTON, May 29, 1862.  MAJOR-GENERAL McDOWELL, Manassas Junction:  General Fremont's force should, and probably will, be at or near Strasburg by twelve (noon) tomorrow. Try to have your force, or the advance of it, at Front Royal as soon.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL MARCY.  WASHINGTON, May 29, 1862. 1.20 P.M.  GENERAL R. B. MARCY:  Your despatch as to the South Anna and Ashland being seized by our forces this morning is received. Understanding these points to be on the Richmond and Fredericksburg railroad, I heartily congratulate the country, and thank General McClellan and his army for their seizure.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL I. McDOWELL.  WASHINGTON, May 30, 1862. 10 A.M.  MAJOR-GENERAL"]]]
