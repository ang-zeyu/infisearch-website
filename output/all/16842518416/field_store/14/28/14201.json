Pity you hadn't held him with the double arm-lock instead of cracking him over the head.  Herr Kapitan Schwalbe won't want to be troubled with a passenger with a swollen head.\"  Leaving their senseless victims in the cave, the two Germans again ascended the hill to St. Mena's Chapel.  As they breasted the summit, they could see the fixed white light of Black Bull Head showing momentarily brighter and brighter against the rapidly failing daylight.  Setting a prismatic compass in position upon the sill of one of the glazeless windows, Ramblethorne took a careful bearing in a seaward direction.  This done, he pointed the projector of the signalling apparatus in precisely the same direction, and threw a waterproofed cloth over the instrument.  \"Too early yet, von Ruhle,\" he remarked.  \"Nevertheless it is advisable to fix our bearings while twilight lasts.  A light might spell disaster.\"  \"A deucedly unpleasant night for such a task,\" grumbled von Ruhle.  \"On the contrary, it is just the very thing,\" replied the doctor.  \"It is not thick enough to be dangerous, but the rain is just sufficient to assist in the screening of U75.  Do not think of your personal comfort, my dear von Ruhle, when urgent work for the Fatherland has to be undertaken.\"  For another half-hour the two men paced the grass-grown stones.  Their choice of St. Mena's Island as a secret signalling station was an excellent one.  It was isolated, and, being slightly greater in elevation than the cliffs of the mainland in the immediate vicinity, would effectually screen any ray of light sent landwards from the expected German submarine.  Thus all danger of the narrow gleam of reflected light being detected by the none too smart members of the coast patrol was entirely obviated.  \"Time!\" exclaimed the doctor, consulting the luminous face of his watch.  Dexterously, and without disturbing the position of the instrument, von Ruhle whipped off the covering.  Although there were no visible signs that anything was taking place, both men knew that a beam of light, reflected from the distant lighthouse on Black Bull Head, was being directed seawards.  In silence the two men peered through the driving rain, von Ruhle making use of a pair of powerful night-glasses.  Suddenly, after an interval of almost five minutes, a faint pin-prick of light flickered from the surface of the sea.  Instantly Ramblethorne stepped a dozen paces to the right.  \"I can see nothing from here,\" he announced in a low voice.  \"Can you?\"  \"Yes,\" replied his companion.  \"Good: that's friend Schwalbe.\"  The doctor was right.  From the deck of the unterseeboot a signalling apparatus similar to that employed by the spies was in use.  By an ingenious automatic arrangement it projected a beam of light, derived from the same sources as that on St. Mena's Island, rigidly in a fixed direction, regardless of the \"lift\" of the submarine under the action of the waves.  For several minutes a rapid exchange of signals was maintained; then the two spies, folding up their apparatus, walked rapidly towards Main Beach Cove.  They had not long to wait before the faint sound of oars was borne to their ears.  \"Himmel!  They have arrived already,\" exclaimed von Ruhle.  \"So it appears,\" replied Ramblethorne dryly.  \"I pride myself that I have exceptionally good eyesight, but I fail to see her.  The neutral colour of the submarine is indeed excellent for night work.\"  They descended the sandy and shingly beach until further progress was barred by the lapping wavelets of the rising tide.  Through the mirk loomed up the outlines of a canvas collapsible boat crowded with men.  At two lengths from the shore the rowers laid on their oars.  One of the men gave vent to a low whistle resembling the call of a curlew.  \"All clear,\" replied Ramblethorne.  The boat's keel rasped on the shingle.  A cloaked figure in the stern-sheets made his way for'ard and leapt ashore.  \"Herr von Hauptwald?\" he asked.  \"The same,\" replied the doctor.  \"And Kapitan Schwalbe?\"  \"The captain is still on board,\" replied the officer.  \"It is hard to resist the opportunity of getting ashore after being cooped up there for more than a fortnight.  But the petrol?\"  \"We have not so much as we hoped to obtain,\" replied von Ruhle.  The Leutnant muttered an oath.  \"And how is business?\" asked Ramblethorne, with a view of distracting the officer's thoughts from the shortage of fuel.  The Leutnant muttered another oath.  \"Bad!\" he replied savagely.  \"Only one wretched little tramp steamer, which we fell in with about twenty miles from the Stacks.  She gave us a run for our money, but we had her at last.  Even then she tried to ram us.  One has to be most cautious also.  These accursed English have been far too active with their new-fangled contrivances.  We called up U71 early this morning.  She replied.  Again at noon we called her, but there was no reply.  U70 we have lost all touch with since Monday, yet she was under orders to assist in the blockade of the Bristol Channel until we, as senior unterseeboot, gave instructions to return to Wilhelmshaven.\"  \"Lost, I suppose,\" remarked Ramblethorne.  The Leutnant had walked to a distance of nearly ten yards from his men, who were drawn up in military order awaiting their officer's commands.  He lowered his voice.  \"Although I am sorry to say it,\" he declared, \"I am afraid she has gone too.  Our losses are not only serious--they are appalling.  Submarine work is now a continual nightmare.  We do our duty, but before long, if we are sufficiently fortunate to escape the toils that these English cast about us, we shall all be physical wrecks.\"  The man's agitation increased as he spoke.  Obviously he was labouring under a severe strain.  \"And this petrol?\" he asked anxiously.  \"What quantity?\"  Ramblethorne told him.  \"Not enough,\" declared the Leutnant.  \"Himmel, it is not enough to get us round Cape Wrath.  On board we have only sufficient for six hours' surface running, while our batteries are not far short of running down. You had better see the captain and explain.\"  Leaving von Ruhle to direct the seamen to the secret petrol store in the cave, Ramblethorne accompanied the Leutnant to the submarine.  The U75 was one of the latest type of Germany's submarines.  Over three hundred feet in length, there was little about her in common with the accepted idea of under-water craft.  Her deck ran in one continuous sweep for almost her entire length, and rose nearly six feet above the surface.  The visible part of her sides was perpendicular, the bulging sections being entirely beneath the surface.  Her conning-tower was surrounded by a platform as long as the navigation-bridge of a modern destroyer.  The two periscopes were \"housed\", but two slender \"wireless\" masts gave the boat the appearance of a swift torpedo craft.  Acknowledging a salute from a burly quartermaster, Ramblethorne gained the deck, and was escorted aft by the Leutnant.  Pacing the tapering platform was a broad-shouldered, fair-haired man of about thirty, although a carefully trimmed blonde beard made him look much older.  He lacked the natural elastic stride of the British naval officer.  His movements resembled those of a thoroughly drilled soldier, yet ever and anon he would glance furtively in the direction of the open sea as if in constant dread of sudden and unknown peril.  \"Greetings, Herr von Hauptwald!\" he exclaimed, when the Leutnant had formally introduced his visitor.  \"You are well known to me by repute, but I doubt whether we have met before.\"  \"I fancy so,\" rejoined the doctor.  \"Do you not remember that little affair in the Strauer Platz?  Ah, I thought you would!  But to come to the point.  We have been unable to obtain the requisite quantity of petrol.\"  \"Somehow I thought it,\" replied Kapitan Schwalbe.  \"How much have you?\"  Ramblethorne told him.  \"Enough, with what we have left on board, for only eight hundred miles run.  It will not take us home, and we are under orders not to leave these waters before Friday next.  We have been let down badly.\"  \"I know that it is useless to express regrets,\" said Ramblethorne boldly.  \"I can only hope that other means of supplying the requisite fuel will be forthcoming.  But here is another matter.  We have had to secure two English lads, both sons of distinguished naval officers. Unfortunately they overheard a conversation between von Ruhle and myself.  In the interests of the Secret Service it is absolutely necessary that they are kept out of the way for at least a couple of months.  I am averse to doing them personal injury.\"  \"Then what do you wish?\" asked Kapitan Schwalbe.  \"Take them on board with you.  If possible, land them at a German port. If this be possible, you will realize that we have a strong tool to work with.\"  \"I fail to understand,\" said the Kapitan of U75.  \"They could be made good use of as hostages,\" resumed Ramblethorne. \"If these English persist in talking about reprisals, we can hint that--well, it is unnecessary to go into details.\"  \"I see,\" remarked Kapitan Schwalbe.  \"But if it is impossible to land them?\"  \"Then you must put them on board the first outward-bound tramp steamer you fall in with--provided she is bound for South American ports, or anywhere that will mean a long voyage.\"  \"Very well,\" assented the submarine officer.  \"I quite understand your anxiety to get them out of the way.\"  \"Temporarily, mind,\" added Ramblethorne.  \"Precisely.  Herr Rix,\" he exclaimed, addressing the Leutnant.  \"Take four men and go ashore.  Von Ruhle will tell you where these English boys are; have them brought on board.\"  \"One moment,\" interrupted Ramblethorne.  \"They came to the island in a boat.  There is nothing unusual in that, I admit, but the fact remains that the boat is still lying in the cove next to this.  You might order the men to set the boat adrift.\"  \"Water-logged, and with sails"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26641"],["title","The Submarine Hunters: A Story of the Naval Patrol Work in the Great War (#4)"],["body","and the main-sheet made fast. Another deplorable accident.  Ach!  It shall be so.\"  Half an hour later Ross Trefusis and Vernon Haye, still unconscious under the action of the anaesthetic injection, were brought on board U75 and passed below.  Their boat, lying on its beam-ends, was drifting slowly in the direction of Black Bull Head.  Ramblethorne and von Ruhle, their work for the present done, were already on the way to the mainland.  Meanwhile, alarmed at the non-appearance of the young heir to Killigwent Hall and his guest, a party had set off to search St. Mena's Island.  Just as the boat's keel grounded on the beach of Half Tide Cove, the German submarine slipped quietly through the blurr of misty rain, and under cover of darkness headed towards the mouth of Bristol Channel.     CHAPTER IV  The Awakening  \"Dash it all!  What am I doing here?\" muttered Ross Trevor drowsily, as he opened his eyes.  For the moment he quite imagined that he was in his dormitory at school, and that by an oversight the rest of his chums had left him in bed.  The suggestion was strengthened by the sound of gurgling water, as if the bathroom tap were running.  Then he became aware that everything was pitching up and down.  Once before he had experienced a similar sensation--when he had had a violent headache following a slight touch of sunstroke.  It puzzled him, too, that he was almost in darkness.  Somewhere without, and partly screened by some projection, an electric light was burning.  The reflected rays were just sufficient to enable him to take stock of his surroundings.  No, he was not back in the school dormitory.  True, he had a headache, but that would not account for the actual motion.  He fumbled, his fingers came in contact with a curved board that served to prevent the occupant of the bed--or, rather, bunk--from falling on the floor.  Almost mechanically he rolled out, and stood supporting himself by grasping the ledge of the bunk.  The swaying, due partly to dizziness and partly to an unaccountable see-saw motion, would have thrown him to the floor but for the assistance afforded by the side of the bunk.  Gradually he became aware that there was a similar sleeping-place immediately beneath the one he had been occupying.  Someone was lying there, breathing heavily.  There was sufficient light for Ross to recognize him.  It was his chum Vernon.  Just then a bell clanged noisily.  The sound of running water was outvoiced by the loud din of machinery in motion.  A wave of hot air that reminded the lad of the atmosphere of a Tube station wafted past him.  The whole fabric trembled under the powerful pulsations of the mechanism.  With his legs trembling through sheer physical weakness, Ross hung on grimly.  He wanted to shout, but no sound came from his parched tongue. He was bewildered.  It seemed as if he were in the throes of a terrible nightmare, and that he would awake on finding himself falling into a bottomless abyss.  The reflected light was obscured as a broad-shouldered man made his way along the narrow corridor in which the bunks were placed.  As he did so he caught sight of the lad.  Without a word he seized Ross in his arms, not roughly, but nevertheless unceremoniously, and lifted him back into the bunk.  There was something so peremptory in the action that Ross lay still and closed his eyes.  All his will power seemed to have deserted him.  \"Make a dash for it, old man!\" exclaimed a muffled voice that Trefusis hardly recognized as his chum's.  \"Make a dash for it.  Don't let them collar us.\"  It was Vernon rambling in his sleep.  The words were sufficient to give Ross a key to the hitherto baffling problem.  Like a flash he recalled the episode of their adventure on St. Mena's Island.  He remembered himself being held in the grasp of the powerful Ramblethorne until unconsciousness overcame him.  He was still a prisoner, but with the qualifying knowledge that he was not alone. Vernon Haye was sharing his captivity, wherever it might be.  \"We're afloat then,\" he muttered.  \"What has happened?\"  Moistening his lips, Ross leant over the side of the bunk and called his chum by name.  His voice sounded strangely unfamiliar.  He could only just hear himself above the clamorous noise of the engines.  It was not long before another man appeared at the end of the corridor. As he did so he switched on a lamp almost above the lad's head.  For a few seconds Ross was temporarily blinded by the sudden transition from artificial twilight to the intense brilliancy of electric light.  \"So!  You are now awake, hein?\" asked a guttural voice.  \"How you vos feel?\"  \"Rotten!\" replied Ross emphatically.  His reply was brief and to the point.  It summed up his sensations during the last ten minutes.  The man laughed.  \"So you look.  You better soon will be.  You know where you now vos?\"  \"On board a ship,\" answered the lad.  He was still hoping against hope that his questioner was anything but a German.  There was a small chance that he had by some means been picked up at sea by a Dutch or a Swedish vessel.  The man's announcement \"put the lid on\" that possibility.  \"Sheep--goot!\" he chuckled.  \"German unterseeboot--vot you vos call submarine.  No danger to you boys if you yourselves behave.  Much to see--ach! plenty much.\"  The lad's eyes had now become more accustomed to the light.  He could see that his visitor was a broad-shouldered, muscular man of average height, florid-featured, and with light-yellow hair and a fair moustache.  He was dressed in a uniform that was apparently a bad copy of that worn by executive officers of the British Navy.  On the breast of his coat he wore an Iron Cross.  \"Me Hermann Rix, Ober-leutnant of unterseeboot,\" he announced.  \"Der Kapitan send me to see how you get better.  Goot!  I tell seaman to bring food quick.  In one hour you go on deck.  Den you feel all well.\"  The German Leutnant bent and peered into the lower cot.  \"Fat head,\" he remarked seriously.  \"Bad knock, but he get well soon.\"  With that the officer went away, leaving the light switched on.  Scrambling out of his bunk, Ross approached his chum.  Vernon was now sleeping quietly.  His face, however, was flushed, while it was quite evident that he had received a fairly heavy blow across the skull, for the top of his head was swollen to a considerable extent.  Before Ross had finished his examination a sailor entered, bearing a tray on which were three slices of rye bread, some tinned beef, and a bottle of Rhenish wine.  \"Sprechen Sie deutsch?\" he asked.  For an instant Trefusis hesitated before replying.  To profess ignorance of the German language would be an immense advantage while on board the submarine, provided he could control his facial expressions and listen without betraying himself.  Then, on the other hand, he reflected that Ramblethorne, the spy, might have been instrumental in getting him into this predicament.  More than likely the Captain of the submarine had been informed of the fact that his unconscious passengers were well acquainted with the tongue-twisting language of the Fatherland.  \"Here is food for you,\" said the man, placing the tray on the floor. \"You had better take hold of the bottle before it upsets.  We are rolling a bit.  When your friend open his eyes, call me.  I am in yonder compartment.  It would be well for you to dress.  I will bring your clothes to you very soon.\"  Ross made a sorry meal.  The food was not at all appetizing.  His throat was in no condition to enable him to swallow easily.  A feeling of nausea, due either to the motion, the hot, confined air, or the after effects of the stupefying injection--perhaps a little of all three--was still present.  He was actually on board a German submarine--one of Tirpitz's twentieth-century pirates.  He racked his brains to find a reason. With its limited accommodation an unterseeboot seemed the last type of craft that would receive a pair of prisoners--and non-combatants--within its steel-clad hull.  It must have been at Ramblethorne's instigation; yet why had not the spy knocked the pair of luckless eavesdroppers over the head and tumbled them into the sea?  It seemed by far the easiest solution; yet, in spite of that, Ross and Vernon were being carried to an unknown destination in one of the \"mystery-craft\" of the Imperial German Navy.  The reappearance of the seaman bearing Ross's clothes cut short the latter's unsolved meditations.  Without a word the man laid the neatly folded garments on the bunk--a pair of flannel trousers, cricket shirt, underclothes, and the sweater that had been the cause of the lads' undoing; but in place of his shoes a pair of half-boots, reeking with tallow, had been provided.  Ross proceeded to dress.  As he did so a voice that he hardly recognized asked:  \"Hulloa, Trefusis, where are we?\"  It was Haye.  His companion was now awake, but hardly conscious of his surroundings.  \"Better?\" asked Ross laconically.  He could not at that moment bring himself to answer the question.  \"Didn't know that I was ill,\" remonstrated Vernon.  Then, after a vain attempt to raise his head--perhaps fortunately, since the bottom of Ross's cot was within a few inches of his face--he added:  \"Dash it all!  I remember.  That beastly German gave me a crack over the head with his copper walking-stick.  Where are we?\"  \"In a rotten hole, old man.  We're in a German submarine, bound goodness knows where.\"  \"Where are my clothes?\" asked Haye, this time successfully getting out of his bunk.  \"Since you have yours, there seems to be no reason why I shouldn't have mine.  Hang it!  What's the matter with me? Everything's spinning round like a top.\"  Mindful of the seaman's words, and with a docility that would have surprised him in different circumstances, Ross staggered along the corridor.  The passage was about thirty feet in length.  On one side the metal wall was flat, on the other it had a pronounced curve. Against it were six bunks"]]]
