Wot d'you think?\"  \"I'm off to it, George, by the first bloomin' boat that goes.\"  \"Haw!  Haw!  Haw!\" roared the old boy, throwing his head back, and swaying with the fullness of his mirth.  \"What an 'ell of a joke.\" Mac, too, chuckled as he sat in the saddle.  \"True, dink, George, I'm going.\"  \"Go on!  Yer can't kid me that.  Why the bloomin' thing's in Yourope, an' it'll be all over in a couple o' shakes.\"  \"Never mind.  I'm off.  And so's Charley.\"  But George was not to be persuaded, and Mac left him still enjoying the joke.  That night a distant voice on the telephone said it was probable that an overseas force would be despatched as soon as possible, and inquired if they would willingly volunteer.  \"You bet your boots!\" Mac shouted down the line.  \"Good,\" said the voice.  \"The whole Regiment has so far volunteered.\"  Three or four days passed wearily by, for all interest had gone out of the old life and they were restless for the new.  Disturbing rumours came vaguely from without of an overseas force ready and about to sail, and Charley and Mac unanimously decided that they were too far from the centre of things, and that they must proceed closer to civilization without delay.  Finishing the day's work, they went through the Saturday overhaul and made themselves presentable in public, saddled the horses, and, in the refreshing spring evening, rode away down the narrow winding road through glades of bush and lonely valleys to the railway line.  There they stayed at a neighbouring homestead, gathering round a great, crackling log-fire to talk over the wonderful days ahead.  Early in the morning they were again on the road for a small country town where lived Mac's Colonel.  Pleasant indeed were those hours, riding ever over the glorious hills and down in the valleys, and as they rode along the world seemed a wonderful place.  The Colonel met Mac's anxious inquiries, as to whether there was any chance of his getting away, with a cheery laugh.  \"No doubt about it, my boy.  You'll be all right.\"  But he was not able to relieve Charley's anxiety as to what was taking place in infantry regiments.  He told them of the Advance Guard which lay at anchor in Port Nicholson awaiting orders to sail at any moment for an unknown destination, but said it was no use trying to get away with it, as it was composed only of infantry regiments from the cities.  It was well towards midnight when they returned, Mac in absolute peace of mind, but Charley still unsettled.  His headquarters were a hundred miles away, and their sport of a host spent the following day running them down in his car, so that Charley might have final satisfaction, and that night, as the car spun homeward hour after hour through the darkness, there was no marring thought in the minds of the two would-be campaigners.  Mac seized two hours' sleep on a sofa, and then crept away into the night to catch a mail train which, rumbling northwards through the hills in the small hours, sometimes stopped near here to water.  Late the next afternoon he acquainted his relatives of his intentions, spent a day or two with them, wished them a cheery farewell, and early the next Sunday, ere the morning mists in the gullies had fled before the first rays, he was again riding up the hill to the old homestead.  He slung his civilian clothes into his tin box, cast his eye rather sorrowfully over his agricultural books as he stowed them away in a kerosene case, and regarded his bare walls whimsically as he removed from them his few precious photos and one or two quaint sketches.  He wondered vaguely while he donned his khaki breeches and puttees what strange lands he might wander in, what queer beds might be his, and what great adventures he might have ere he would again take that mufti from the tin trunk.  And would this fine old station life ever be his again?  In the evening he rode to neighbouring homesteads to bid farewell to many whose homes had been his, and whose thoughts would go with him on his unknown travels.  Finally he parted with his dogs.  The next morning, no longer a stockman, but a soldier of the King, he turned his back on the station, a home of pleasant memories, and travelled slowly the long road to the camp.  His mare had come straight from a long spell of grass, and it was late in the afternoon of the following day before he dismounted finally in his squadron lines.  Here already, in the middle days of August, were several thousand splendid men--a battalion of infantry, a regiment of mounted rifles, a battery of artillery, medical corps, engineers, signallers and service corps; fine men all, accustomed to life in the open, strong of build, active of movement and infinitely amused with everything around--splendid comrades with whom to embark on a campaign.  Mac made his way to his tent, where he was straightway at home with mates of previous camps and station days.     CHAPTER II  MAC EMBARKS FOR OVERSEAS  Six weeks dragged slowly by.  A few days after they came into camp, there were ten great transports ready to take overseas the Expeditionary Force of 8,500 men, horses, guns, limbers and stores, and always there had been orders to be ready for instant embarkation and that the probable date of departure was a week ahead.  Constantly that day was put off, and again put off, delay followed delay, while the men speculated on the cause, condemned the authorities and blasphemed generally.  The War would be over before they could get anywhere near the front, and they chafed vainly.  The troopships lay in the harbours, the men were ready in camp, why not embark?  With the exception of this uneasiness of mind, nothing spoilt the full enjoyment of the spring days.  All day the sun shone bright and strong from a blue sky, the warmth tempered by pleasant breezes from the sea or the mountains, and at night the stars stood out brilliantly in the great dome above.  Used to many camps in the past, accustomed also to cooking and to battling generally for themselves, they were as much at home as ever they were in the lines of white tents, and for most of them these were lazy holidays after the hard life of the bush and the sheep-runs.  The army was generous in its supply of food, and much good butter, jam, meat and bread, which would have been luxuries indeed in the months to come, went to waste in Awapuni incinerators.  And day after day came cars from towns and farms and stations within two hundred miles, bringing tuck-box after tuck-box containing the choicest products of the home larders.  The red sun, lifting above the eastern hills, found long irregular lines of horses straggling across dewy fields to water at the rushing streams of the Manawatu River.  On one bare-backed horse of every four sat a trooper, clad sketchily in shirt and breeches tugged on hastily, as a sergeant had called the roll.  They played the fool as they passed, laughing and chattering, losing their horses in their madness, all making thorough nuisances of themselves and all atune with the fresh glory of the dawn.  Usually, during the day, in independent troops of thirty or forty men, they wandered about the district, among the pleasant suburban homes of Palmerston, along shady country roads or up into the hills.  They walked or cantered for an hour or so, and then, selecting a likely-looking homestead, they would unsaddle and unbridle their mounts and leave them to graze the succulent grass at the sides of the road, or roll if they wished, while a man was put at both ends of that stretch of road to prevent their straying.  Then the others would lie in the shade or sun themselves on the bank opposite the homestead, sleeping, smoking, reading or playing cards.  Scarcely ever did the oracle fail to work.  The door of the house would open and a fair maid appear, anon, a mother and a sister.  The first would come tripping down the path to the soldiers and inquire:  \"Mother says would you like some tea?\"  \"Well,\" they would reply, \"it wouldn't be a bad idea, would it?  But, I say, wouldn't it be a lot of trouble?\"  \"Oh, not at all.\"  And she would skip away back to the house to the innards of which, mother and sister, regarding the preamble as a mere formality, had disappeared to get things under way.  A brief interval was followed by the appearance of large trays of cups, the whole of the household crockery from the drawing-room, breakfast-room and kitchen, with scones and cakes, and all the luxuries of the storeroom, and, perhaps, apples from the barn.  The good family, as is only in keeping with proper hospitality, would join in the feast; and the disappearance of two or three cheery troopers into the house to assist in washing up would end one of those irresponsible, warm-hearted little scenes which were so many in those far-away days of August '14.  Another hour or so on the march in the middle afternoon, and they would return to camp, to \"stables\" and evening.  Palmerston normally was never anything else than a quiet country town of sober habits and eminent respectability, but now the echoing emptiness of her streets was gone, the lights shone brilliantly across the Square, the air was full of the murmur of the crowd, the tread of heavy boots, the tinkling of spurs and glasses and the laughter of merry parties.  Perspiring waiters and flustered waitresses fed the hordes in the hotels, while the baths worked overtime.  The road to the camp lay like a searchlight beam across the landscape--the cloud of never-resting dust lit by the strong headlights of a thousand taxis which careered along the rough road, careless of life or of their own future.  Happy and weary, the men came streaming back to camp, entering by the front if before \"Lights Out,\" through the pine plantations if after.  At length embarkation orders became concrete and remained so.  The camp buzzed with excitement, and, when night"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26548"],["title","The Tale of a Trooper (#2)"],["body","me, all were busy getting the gear ready.  No one slept, and, in the dark, silent hours before the dawn, the camp was struck.  The neat lines of tents became merely small bundles and odd poles, while hundreds of figures passed hither and thither amid blazing fires of straw.  In the early light the Regiment moved away from the pleasant camp of Awapuni, the first of many such abodes.  In the middle of the morning, struggling engines creaked away with the long lines of horse-trucks and carriages of rowdy troopers who cheered wildly as they set out at last upon their adventures.  They crawled along the low country of the Manawatu, then along the rough cliffs above the sea, over the hills, and at length down the rocky gorge to Wellington.  The troops detrained, watered and fed the horses, hung about for a while, and eventually led the horses to the wharves.  Four great grey transports lay alongside, and the sun shone down hotly on a scene of seething activity, a crowd of troops working with the energy of enthusiasm, long strings of horses filing up huge gangways and disappearing into lines of horse-boxes around the bulwarks, or swinging aloft singly by cranes to be lowered swiftly into the black depths of holds.  Mac led his terrified mare up the steep gangway and down into a hold where he left her with regret.  Mac's squadron was to embark on another ship, except some men who were to look after the horses.  This transport lay at Lyttleton.  So Mac and his cobbers had a few hours' leave pending the departure of the southward ferry steamer at eight o'clock, and they, in the meantime, went up the town to have a good time and to turn out old friends.  They did not waste these few short hours, the streets rang with their enthusiasm, and the departing steamer took away from the pier a singing, rollicking crowd of happy warriors.  Mac slept soundly on a table, and awoke in the morning to find the vessel was berthing at Lyttleton.  Disembarking, they filed round the wharves to where two troopships lay opposite each other, and embarked again on H.M.N.Z.T. No. 4, the S.S. _Tahiti_.  Mac grabbed what looked about the best bunk in the murky depths of the 'tween decks which was the Squadron's alloted space, and wrote his name in several places on the boards.  The lucky ones got breakfast during the forenoon, those who were lazy dodged fatigues and slept in out-of-the-way corners in the sun, and so Mac and his cobber Bill might have been found comfortably dozing on a great pile of onions on the aft boat deck.  They found such seclusion most satisfactory on these turbulent days of movement, except for occasional visits to see that no blighted trooper was trying to beat a fellow for his \"possie\" in the hold.  Trains kept rumbling out of the tunnel beneath the great hills, bringing more troops, horses and stores, and all the afternoon the gangways were crowded with these coming on board.  By four, embarkation was complete and a throng of people who had massed behind a barrier to see the last of the troops, flooded on to the wharf.  Secrecy had been strictly kept as to the time of departure, and so the public were few to what there might have been.  Pretty girls were wildly enthusiastic and were not particular as to how many troopers they fondly took farewell of, women smiled and laughed, though there were often tears in their eyes, and the men were laboriously humorous. A band played airs which the bandmaster considered suitable to the occasion, the troops, swarming on the railings and the rigging, sang lustily snatches of song; and finally, amidst the fortissimo strains of the National Anthem, a wild holloing from every one, and a bellowing of fog-horns, the ships drew slowly away from the wharf.  They manoeuvred awkwardly out through the moles, while the throng on shore became but one black shape beneath a sea of fluttering handkerchiefs.  That night the two ships steamed slowly to the north.  Mac landed horse-picket, and for four hours he paced a length of the boat-deck up and down past fifty horses' heads, while the wind howled mournfully in the rigging and the ship swayed easily to the swell.  Morning broke, with a dull sky, a dull sea and many miserable troopers.  Towards midday they were joined by two vessels from the south with the Otago troops, and in the middle of the afternoon the whole four hove to in Cook Strait, awaiting the four transports from Wellington.  But contrary orders came, and so, entering Wellington Harbour, they dropped anchor towards evening.  A gale came down in gusts from the hills around, bringing furious squalls of rain; and Mac, in heavy oilskins, again paced the boat-deck.  Dawn broke grey and drear, and the troops were in the depths of depression.  It was not the ill weather which distressed them, but at the eleventh hour, in the middle of the night, a picket boat had brought unwelcome despatches and now all hope was gone, all faith lost.  \"Owing to unforeseen circumstances, the transports will not at present sail, and orders for disembarkation will be issued in due course.\"  So ran the death sentence.  Most of the infantry remained on the transports, but the other branches of the service mournfully disembarked and trekked to the few more or less level places amid Wellington's hills, where they pitched camps. The Wellington Mounteds found a home on Trentham racecourse, and passed a fortnight there, riding along the valley roads and manoeuvring over the steep hills.  It was not so bad either, for day after day passed with glorious sunshine and cooling breeze, and the city was in reach by a weary train.  There was a grand review which no one particularly enjoyed, and Mac least of all, for he had an attack of influenza.  All the long day he rode with a dizzy, aching head; and one of Wellington's very own tearing gales, which whirled upwards great clouds of yellow dust, served not at all to cool his heated brow.  And when, late at night, he spread out his straw and lay down, the long day seemed to have been a vague, bad dream.  But the fever had gone when morning came, which proves that there are more ways than one of curing influenza.  He had cut short the career of the same disease at Awapuni Camp when out on an extensive movement one night near Feilding.  His officer had given him a goodly nip of strong Scotch whisky and had advised him to remain at the first bivouac, but Mac thought that influenza was as bad at one place as at another.  So he successfully guarded a road all night, his horse picketed to a fence, and himself in a greatcoat stretched asleep in the middle of the road.  Once again, the bright stars long before dawn looked down upon the bustle of a breaking camp, looked down upon the flaring piles of burning straw, the collapsing tents and the happy laughing throng of busy troopers.  Early in the dewy morning they clattered out of the race-course gates and away down the winding road in the valley bottom. Afternoon found them skirting the harbour beneath the great rocky escarpments of Wellington's hills, and from here Mac espied a sight which gladdened his soul and he lost no time in communicating his discovery to Bill and the others.  Across a distant neck of land at the far side of the harbour, he had seen the tall tapering masts of two men-of-war, moving rapidly, and two murky streaks of smoke.  This looked like business.  In an hour two great cruisers rounded the far point, and the boys welcomed them warmly as a sort of guarantee that there would be no humbug about this embarkation.  Again came the animated scene as they shipped their horses, again a last night to roam streets, which echoed with mirth far into the night, and again the crowded piers aflutter with handkerchiefs, drawing away in the distance.  The _Tahiti_ passed close astern of the two cruisers, the Japanese _Ibuki_ and the British _Minotaur_, and cheered their crews lustily as they came abeam.  The whole fleet anchored in the stream.  All night long the Morse lamps winked at the mastheads, the ships' lights twinkled on the water in long twisting lines, and the great glow of a million lamps of the city lit with fire the waters of the harbour, and the huge hills stood out black against the sky.  A day of squalls followed, and dragged slowly by.  Why were the anchors not weighed?  Pessimists said they might never leave, and all eagerly watched the warships for any signs of going to sea--an increasing volume of smoke from the funnels, activity on the bridge or more than an ordinary display of signal flags.  But there was nothing to bring lasting satisfaction and the grey day ended with a colourless sunset. Towards midnight a tender bumped alongside, men shouted in the dark and packages were dropped with thuds upon the deck above.     CHAPTER III  SORROWS AND JOYS IN A TROOPSHIP  Mac dragged himself regretfully out of his bunk when a mournful \"reveille\" had finished echoing along the decks, and went above to see what might be doing.  They were off, or, at least, they soon would be. Already the cruisers were coming steadily down the harbour, some transports had weighed, and were awkwardly pulling their heads round to seaward, others sent clouds of steam rumbling in a deafening roar from their safety-valves.  The cruisers passed, and each transport followed in her appointed place.  Everyone neglected the work of the moment in that hour of putting to sea, and Mac, perched high on the roof of the wireless cabin, watched it with as much pride and rapture as might an emperor reviewing the grandest of fleets.  In single line-ahead, the fourteen great grey ships, their smoke trailing away over the port quarter before a fresh wind, passed down the wild rocky gap of the entrance.  The grey seas rolled in a long swell, grey, flying clouds hid the eastern mountain tops.  The passengers of an in-bound steamer had hurried on deck, clad lightly against the chill wind, sent a faint cheer to each passing ship.  Hundreds of people waved"]]]
