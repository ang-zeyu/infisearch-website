When the Confederate squadron arrived at Drewry's Bluff, the defenses which had been constructed at the place were not in a condition to have prevented the Federal squadron from passing on to Richmond; but in the day which the Federal vessels wasted in silencing the fire of the half-deserted Confederate batteries on the lower river, the works at Drewry's Bluff were materially strengthened. The _Jamestown_ and several smaller vessels were sunk in the river channel, the two rifled guns of the _Jamestown_ having been previously landed and mounted in pits dug in the brow of the bluff. The eight-inch solid-shot gun of the _Patrick Henry_ and her two six-inch rifles were also landed, thus forming a formidable naval battery countersunk on the brow of the hill, consisting of one eight-inch solid-shot gun and four six-inch rifles. Besides the naval battery, there were several army guns mounted in a breastwork and served by a battalion of Artillery, under the command of Major A. Drewry, who was the owner of the bluff, and from whom the place took its name.  The naval guns were manned by the crews of the _Patrick Henry_, _Jamestown_ and _Virginia_--the crew of the _Virginia_ arriving at the bluff soon after she had been destroyed by Flag Officer Tatnall, to prevent her from falling into the hands of the enemy. It is not always possible for a sea captain to preserve the vessel he commands; but it is always possible to act with firmness, skill and judgment under trying and adverse circumstances, and this Flag Officer Tatnall seems to have done. A court-martial, composed of officers of high professional attainments and acknowledged personal merit, acquitted him of all blame for the loss of the _Virginia_.  The following naval officers may be named as participating in the engagement of Drewry's Bluff, though there were others whose names are not at this time procurable: Of the _Patrick Henry_, Commander John Randolph Tucker, Lieutenant James Henry Rochelle, Lieutenant Francis Lyell Hoge, and others; of the _Jamestown_, Lieutenant Commanding J. Nicholas Barney, Acting Master Samuel Barron, Jr., and others; of the _Virginia_, Lieutenant Catesby Roger Jones, Lieutenant Hunter Davidson, Lieutenant John Taylor Wood, Lieutenant Walter Raleigh Butt, and others. Commander E. Farrand was the ranking and commanding officer present, having been sent down from Richmond to command the station.  It was on the 15th of May, 1862, that the Federal vessels _Galena_, _Monitor_, _Naugatuck_, _Aroostook_, and _Port Royal_ made the well-known attack on the Confederate batteries at Drewry's Bluff, which was the only obstacle barring the way to Richmond, the capital of the Confederate States.  The _Galena_ and _Monitor_ engaged the batteries at short distance, the other three Federal vessels keeping just within long range of the Confederate guns. The _Monitor_, after the action commenced, finding that her position was too near the bluff to allow of her guns being elevated sufficiently to throw their shot to the crest of the cliff, retired to a more favorable position. The Confederates wasted but few shot on her, knowing they would not pierce her armor.  The _Galena_ was managed and fought with great skill and daring. Approaching to within about six hundred yards of the Confederate batteries, she was deliberately moored, her battery sprung and a well-directed fire opened upon the Confederate works. From half past six o'clock in the morning until about eleven, when the action ceased, she kept this position, receiving nearly the whole of the Confederate fire. The most effective gun on the Bluff was the eight-inch solid shot gun of the _Patrick Henry_. Knowing by previous experience the power of the gun, Tucker gave it his personal supervision. At 11 o'clock A.M. a shot from this gun passed into one of the bow posts of the _Galena_, and was followed by an immediate gushing forth of smoke, showing that the vessel was on fire or had sustained some serious damage, a conclusion confirmed by her moving off down the river, accompanied by the other four vessels of the Federal squadron. It was at Drewry's Bluff that Midshipman Carroll, of Maryland, was killed. He was struck by a projectile whilst standing by Tucker's side, whose aide he was.  For some days it was expected that another attack on the Confederate position would be made, but no other effort to capture Richmond with iron-clads was attempted. A half a dozen armored vessels, built expressly for being forced through obstructions and by batteries, could have passed Drewry's Bluff and captured Richmond, but the force with which the attempt was actually made was neither well adapted for the undertaking nor sufficiently strong for success.  The _Galena's_ loss was thirteen killed and eleven wounded, and one officer and two men were wounded on board the other Federal vessels. On the Confederate side the loss, including the battalion of Artillery, as well as the force of sailors, was eleven killed and nine wounded.  After the Federal repulse at Drewry's Bluff, the officers and crew of the _Patrick Henry_, _Virginia_ and _Jamestown_ were permanently attached to the naval batteries at that place, Tucker continuing to command his men on shore.  In August, 1862, Tucker was ordered to command the iron-clad steamer _Chicora_, which vessel had just been launched at Charleston. She was a casemate iron-clad, with armor four inches in thickness, and carried a battery of two nine-inch smooth-bore shell guns, and two six-inch Brooks rifles, throwing a projectile weighing sixty pounds. Flag Officer Duncan N. Ingraham commanded the Charleston squadron, and flew his flag on board the _Palmetto State_, Lieutenant Commanding John Rutledge. The _Palmetto State_ was an iron-clad, similar to the _Chicora_ in build and armor, carrying a battery of one seven-inch rifled gun forward, one six-inch rifled gun aft, and one eight-inch shell gun on each broadside.  On the night of January 31st, 1863, the two Confederate iron-clads made a successful attack on the Federal blockading squadron off Charleston. Passing the bar of Charleston harbor at early dawn, the Confederate iron-clads quickly drove the blockading vessels out to sea, and the blockade was broken, at least for some hours. In his official report of this action Flag Officer Ingraham says, \"I cannot speak in too high terms of the conduct of Commander Tucker and Lieutenant Commanding Rutledge; the former handled his vessel in a beautiful manner and did the enemy much damage. I refer you to his official report.\"  The official report to which Flag Officer Ingraham refers the Confederate Secretary of the Navy is as follows:   \"CONFEDERATE STATES STEAMER _Chicora_,                                         \"January 31st, 1863.      \"_Sir_--In obedience to your order, I got under way at 11.30     P.M. yesterday, and stood down the harbor in company with the     Confederate States steamer _Palmetto State_, bearing your     flag. We crossed the bar at 4.40 A.M., and commenced the     action at 5.20 A.M. by firing into a schooner-rigged     propeller, which we set on fire and have every reason to     believe sunk, as she was nowhere to be seen at daylight. We     then engaged a large sidewheel steamer, twice our length from     us on the port bow, firing three shots into her with telling     effect, when she made a run for it. This vessel was supposed     to be the _Quaker City_. We then engaged a schooner-rigged     propeller and a large sidewheel steamer, partially crippling     both, and setting the latter on fire, causing her to strike     her flag; at this time the latter vessel, supposed to be the     _Keystone State_, was completely at my mercy, I having taken     position astern, distant some two hundred yards. I at once     gave the order to cease firing upon her, and directed     Lieutenant Bier, First Lieutenant of the _Chicora_, to man a     boat and take charge of the prize, if possible to save her; if     that was not possible, to rescue her crew. While the boat was     in the act of being manned, I discovered that she was     endeavoring to make her escape by working her starboard wheel,     the other being disabled, her colors being down. I at once     started in pursuit and renewed the engagement. Owing to her     superior steaming qualities she soon widened the distance to     some two hundred yards. She then hoisted her flag and     commenced firing her rifled guns; her commander, by this     faithless act, placing himself beyond the pale of civilized     and honorable warfare.[1] We next engaged two schooners, one     brig, and one bark-rigged propeller, but not having the     requisite speed were unable to bring them to close quarters.     We pursued them six or seven miles seaward. During the latter     part of the combat, I was engaged at long range with a     bark-rigged steam sloop-of-war; but in spite of all our     efforts, was unable to bring her to close quarters, owing to     her superior steaming qualities. At 7.30 A.M., in obedience to     your orders, we stood in shore, leaving the partially crippled     and fleeing enemy about _seven miles clear of the bar_,     standing to the southward and eastward. At 8 A.M., in     obedience to signal, we anchored in four fathoms waters off     the Beach Channel.\"      \"It gives me pleasure to testify to the good conduct and     efficiency of the officers and crew of the _Chicora_. I am     particularly indebted to the pilots, Messrs. Payne and Aldert,     for the skillful pilotage of the vessel.\"      \"It gives me pleasure to report that I have no injuries or     casualties.\"      \"Very respectfully, your obedient servant,                             \"J.R.

The Federal squadron consisted of the _Housatonic_, _Meresdita_, _Keystone State_, _Quaker City_, _Augusta_, _Flag_, _Memphis_, _Stettin_, _Ottawa_, and _Unadilla_, ten vessels, all of them unarmored, and three, the _Housatonic_, _Ottawa_ and _Unadilla_, built for war service, the other seven being merchant steamers converted into men-of-war. The Confederate squadron consisted of only two vessels, both iron-clads, the _Palmetto State_ and _Chicora_, which received no damage whatever during the engagement, either to their hulls, machinery, or crew, whilst several of the ten Federal wooden vessels were seriously injured, though none of them were sunk, their escape from capture or destruction being due to the swiftness of their flight. Their loss was twenty-five killed and twenty-two wounded.  The blockade of Charleston harbor was soon, indeed immediately, re-established, and kept up by the armored frigate _New Ironsides_ and a number of heavy \"Monitors.\" There was, from the end of this battle to the evacuation of Charleston by the Confederates, no time when there would have been the least probability of the success of another dash by the Confederate vessels in the harbor upon the Federal squadron blockading.  In the month of February, 1863, Tucker was promoted to the rank of Captain in the Provisional Navy of the Confederate States, and in March following was appointed Flag Officer of the Confederate Forces Afloat at Charleston, the _Chicora_ bearing his flag.  On the 7th of April, 1863, Admiral Dupont made his attack on Charleston, with a squadron consisting of the armored frigate _New Ironsides_ and eight \"Monitors.\" Tucker, with his usual good judgment, held the _Chicora_ and _Palmetto State_, aided by a number of rowboats armed with torpedoes, ready to make a desperate and final assault upon the Federal squadron if it should succeed in passing the Confederate forts guarding the entrance to the harbor. Admiral Dupont's squadron was repulsed by the forts, and the Confederate squadron was not engaged.  The Confederate naval forces afloat at Charleston did not possess either the strength or swiftness necessary for an attack on the Federal blockading squadron with any reasonable prospect of success, and Tucker therefore turned his attention to attacks by means of torpedo-boats fitted out from his squadron. On the 5th of October, 1863, Lieutenant W.T. Glassell, with a small double-ender steam torpedo-boat, made an attempt to sink the _New Ironsides_, lying off Morris' Island. The _New Ironsides_ was not sunk, but she was seriously damaged and was sent North for repairs. The torpedo-boat was filled with water, and her commander, pilot, and engineer, all that were on board of her, were thrown overboard by the shock of the striking and exploding of the torpedo against the bottom of the iron-clad. The torpedo-boat was finally taken back into Charleston harbor by the pilot and engineer, but Lieutenant Glassell was made prisoner after having been in the water about an hour. A torpedo-boat commanded by Lieutenant Dixon of the Confederate Army, and manned by six volunteers from Tucker's squadron and one from the army, attacked and sunk, on the night of February 17th, 1864, the United States steamer _Housatonic_ lying in the North Channel. The torpedo-boat with all on board went to the bottom, but most of the crew of the _Housatonic_ were saved by taking refuge in the rigging, which was not submerged when the vessel rested on the bottom.  The boat attack on Fort Sumter, made by the Federals on September 8th, 1863, was easily repulsed, and the Charleston squadron materially aided in the repulse.  A battalion of sailors from the recruits on board the receiving-ship _Indian Chief_, under the command of Lieutenant Commanding William Galliard Dozier, was detached by Tucker to co-operate with the army on James' Island in August, 1864. This battalion rendered good service, and upon its return to the squadron was kept organized and ready to respond whenever a call for assistance was made upon the Navy by the Army.  Early in 1864 some changes were made in the commanding officers of the squadron; Commander Isaac Newton Brown was ordered to the _Charleston_, Commander Thomas T. Hunter to the _Chicora_, and Lieutenant Commanding James Henry Rochelle to the _Palmetto State_. No other changes were made in the commands of the squadron while it existed.  The three iron-clads under Tucker's command at Charleston were all slow vessels, with imperfect engines, which required frequent repairing; for that day, and considering the paucity of naval resources in the South, they were fairly officered, manned and armed. All of them were clad with armor four inches thick, and they were all of the type of the _Virginia_, or _Merrimac_, as that vessel is frequently but erroneously called. The commander of the vessels were all formerly officers of the United States Navy, who were citizens of the Southern States and had resigned their commissions in the Federal service when their States seceded from the Union. The lieutenants and other officers were appointed from civil life, but they were competent to perform the duties required of them, and conducted themselves well at all times and under all circumstances. The crews of each vessel numbered from one hundred and twenty to one hundred and sixty men, some of them able-seamen, and most of them efficient and reliable men. Each vessel carried a torpedo, fitted to the end of a spar some fifteen or twenty feet long projecting from the bows in a line with the keel, and so arranged that it could be carried either triced up clear of the water or submerged five or six feet below the surface. The squadron was in a good state of discipline and drill, and, so far as the personnel was concerned, in a very efficient condition.  Every night one or two of the iron-clads anchored in the channel near Fort Sumter for the purpose of resisting a night attack on that place or a dash into the harbor by the Federal squadron.  Not long before the evacuation of Charleston an iron-clad named the _Columbia_ was launched there. She had a thickness of six inches of iron on her casemate, and was otherwise superior to the other three iron-clads of the squadron. Unfortunately, she was run aground whilst coming out of dock, and so much injured as not to be able to render any service whatever.  Charleston was evacuated by the Confederate forces on the 18th of February, 1865. Several days previous to the evacuation a detachment from the squadron of about three hundred men, under the command of Lieutenant Commanding James Henry Rochelle, consisting of the officers and crews of the _Palmetto State_, _Columbia_, and the recruits from the receiving-ship _Indian Chief_, were dispatched by rail to Wilmington, which the detachment reached only a few days before it was, in turn, abandoned by the Confederate Army. The Charleston naval detachment was ordered to co-operate with the Army as a body of infantry, and was assigned to duty with General Hoke's division, of which it formed the extreme right, resting on Cape Fear river. The position was exposed to an annoying fire from the Federal gunboats in the river, to which no reply could be made, but from which some loss was suffered. The evacuation of Wilmington took place on the 22d of February, 1865, and the Charleston squadron's naval battalion marched out with Hoke's division, to which it remained attached until somewhere in the interior of North Carolina it reunited with Tucker's command.  With the officers and crews of the _Charleston_ and _Chicora_, Tucker left Charleston on the 18th of February, 1865, the day of the evacuation of the city by the Confederate Army. As far as Florence in South Carolina the Charleston naval brigade traveled by rail, but at that point Tucker received a telegram informing him that the Federal forces were about cutting the railway communication between Florence and Wilmington. This was the last message that came over the wires, and Tucker, knowing that the enemy had succeeded in seizing the railroad, abandoned his intention of making for Wilmington, and marched his command across the country to Fayetteville, where he received orders from the Navy Department to bring his force to Richmond. On the way from Fayetteville to Richmond the detached Charleston naval battalion was reunited to the main body under Tucker, and the whole brigade proceeded together to Richmond, and from Richmond it was sent to garrison the Confederate batteries at Drewry's Bluff, of which place Tucker was ordered to assume command, the naval forces afloat in James river being under the command of Rear Admiral Raphael Semmes.  When Tucker took command at Drewry's Bluff the Confederate cause was at its last gasp. Richmond was evacuated by the Confederate Army and Government on the night of the 2d of April, 1865. Strange to relate, Tucker received no orders to retire with his command, and he held his post steadily until, early on the morning of the 3d, the Confederate iron-clads in James river were burnt by their own commanders. When he knew the troops were marching out of Richmond and saw the Confederate iron-clads burning in the river, Tucker thought it was not only justifiable but necessary for him to act without orders, and he retired with his command from Drewry's Bluff. General R.E. Lee told Tucker, when they met, that of all the mistakes committed by the Richmond authorities he regretted none more than the neglect to apprise the naval force at Drewry's Bluff of the intended evacuation of the city.  The naval brigade from Drewry's Bluff, under Flag Officer Tucker, joined the rear guard of the Confederate Army, and was attached to General Custis Lee's division of General Ewell's corps, with which it marched"]]]
