This is our first visit to your planetary system and we chanced upon your rocket. So it is a satellite? We didn't watch it long enough to discover whether or not it was a satellite. At first we thought it to be another traveling space craft, but when it refused to answer our signals we investigated.\"  \"And so that was the earth at which I looked,\" mused the professor. \"No wonder I didn't recognize it. The topography has changed so much. How different the sun appears--it must have been over a million years ago when I died!\"  \"Many millions,\" corrected 25X-987. \"Suns of such size as this one do not cool in so short a time as you suggest.\"  Professor Jameson, in spite of all his amazing computations before his death, was staggered by the reality.  \"Who are you?\" he suddenly asked.  \"We are the Zoromes from Zor, a planet of a sun far across the Universe.\"  25X-987 then went on to tell Professor Jameson something about how the Zoromes had attained their high stage of development and had instantly put a stop to all birth, evolution and death of their people, by becoming machine men.     CHAPTER IV  _The Dying World_   \"And now tell us of yourself,\" said 25X-987, \"and about your world.\"  Professor Jameson, noted in college as a lecturer of no mean ability and perfectly capable of relating intelligently to them the story of the earth's history, evolution and march of events following the birth of civilization up until the time when he died, began his story. The mental speech hampered him for a time, but he soon became accustomed to it so as to use it easily, and he found it preferable to vocal speech after a while. The Zoromes listened interestedly to the long account until Professor Jameson had finished.  \"My nephew,\" concluded the professor, \"evidently obeyed my instructions and placed my body in the rocket I had built, shooting it out into space where I became the satellite of the earth for these many millions of years.\"  \"Do you really want to know how long you were dead before we found you?\" asked 25X-987. \"It would be interesting to find out.\"  \"Yes, I should like very much to know,\" replied the professor.  \"Our greatest mathematician, 459C-79, will tell it to you.\" The mathematician stepped forward. Upon one side of his cube were many buttons arranged in long columns and squares.  \"What is your unit of measuring?\" he asked.  \"A mile.\"  \"How many times more is a mile than is the length of your rocket satellite?\"  \"My rocket is fifteen feet long. A mile is five thousand two hundred and eighty feet.\"  The mathematician depressed a few buttons.  \"How far, or how many miles from the sun was your planet at that time?\"  \"Ninety-three million miles,\" was the reply.  \"And your world's satellite--which you call moon from your planet--earth?\"  \"Two hundred and forty thousand miles.\"  \"And your rocket?\"  \"I figured it to go about sixty-five thousand miles from the earth.\"  \"It was only twenty thousand miles from the earth when we picked it up,\" said the mathematician, depressing a few more buttons. \"The moon and sun are also much nearer your planet now.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Professor Jameson gave way to a mental ejaculation of amazement.  \"Do you know how long you have cruised around the planet in your own satellite?\" said the mathematician. \"Since you began that journey, the planet which you call the earth has revolved around the sun over forty million times.\"  \"Forty--million--years!\" exclaimed Professor Jameson haltingly. \"Humanity must then have all perished from the earth long ago! I'm the last man on earth!\"  \"It is a dead world now,\" interjected 25X-987.  \"Of course,\" elucidated the mathematician, \"those last few million years are much shorter than the ones in which you lived. The earth's orbit is of less diameter and its speed of revolution is greatly increased, due to its proximity to the cooling sun. I should say that your year was some four times as long as the time in which it now takes your old planet to circumnavigate the sun.  \"How many days were there in your year?\"  \"Three hundred and sixty-five.\"  \"The planet has now ceased rotating entirely.\"  \"Seems queer that your rocket satellite should avoid the meteors so long,\" observed 459C-79, the mathematician.  \"Automatic radium repulsion rays,\" explained the professor.  \"The very rays which kept us from approaching your rocket,\" stated 25X-987, \"until we neutralized them.\"  \"You died and were shot out into space long before any life occurred on Zor,\" soliloquized one of the machine men. \"Our people had not yet even been born when yours had probably disappeared entirely from the face of the earth.\"  \"Hearken to 72N-4783,\" said 25X-987, \"he is our philosopher, and he just loves to dwell on the past life of Zor when we were flesh and blood creatures with the threat of death hanging always over our heads. At that time, like the life you knew, we were born, we lived and died, all within a very short time, comparatively.\"  \"Of course, time has come to mean nothing to us, especially when we are out in space,\" observed 72N-4783. \"We never keep track of it on our expeditions, though back in Zor such accounts are accurately kept. By the way, do you know how long we stood here while you recounted to us the history of your planet? Our machine bodies never get tired, you know.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Well,\" ruminated Professor Jameson, giving a generous allowance of time. \"I should say about a half a day, although it seemed scarcely as long as that.\"  \"We listened to you for four days,\" replied 72N-4783.  Professor Jameson was really aghast.  \"Really, I hadn't meant to be such a bore,\" he apologized.  \"That is nothing,\" replied the other. \"Your story was interesting, and if it had been twice as long, it would not have mattered, nor would it have seemed any longer. Time is merely relative, and in space actual time does not exist at all, any more than your forty million years' cessation of life seemed more than a few moments to you. We saw that it was so when your first thought impressions reached us following your revival.\"  \"Let us continue on to your planet earth,\" then said 25X-987. \"Perhaps we shall find more startling disclosures there.\"  As the space ship of the Zoromes approached the sphere from which Professor Jameson had been hurled in his rocket forty million years before, the professor was wondering how the earth would appear, and what radical changes he would find. Already he knew that the geographical conditions of the various continents were changed. He had seen as much from the space ship.  A short time later the earth was reached. The space travelers from Zor, as well as Professor Jameson, emerged from the cosmic flyer to walk upon the surface of the planet. The earth had ceased rotating, leaving one-half its surface always toward the sun. This side of the earth was heated to a considerable degree, while its antipodes, turned always away from the solar luminary, was a cold, frigid, desolate waste. The space travelers from Zor did not dare to advance very far into either hemisphere, but landed on the narrow, thousand-mile strip of territory separating the earth's frozen half from its sun-baked antipodes.  As Professor Jameson emerged from the space ship with 25X-987, he stared in awe at the great transformation four hundred thousand centuries had wrought. The earth's surface, its sky and the sun were all so changed and unearthly appearing. Off to the east the blood red ball of the slowly cooling sun rested upon the horizon, lighting up the eternal day. The earth's rotation had ceased entirely, and it hung motionless in the sky as it revolved around its solar parent, its orbit slowly but surely cutting in toward the great body of the sun. The two inner planets, Mercury and Venus, were now very close to the blood red orb whose scintillating, dazzling brilliance had been lost in its cooling process. Soon, the two nearer planets would succumb to the great pull of the solar luminary and return to the flaming folds, from which they had been hurled out as gaseous bodies in the dim, age-old past, when their careers had just begun.  The atmosphere was nearly gone, so rarefied had it become, and through it Professor Jameson could view with amazing clarity without discomfort to his eyes the bloated body of the dying sun. It appeared many times the size he had seen it at the time of his death, on account of its relative nearness. The earth had advanced a great deal closer to the great star around which it swung.  The sky towards the west was pitch black except for the iridescent twinkle of the fiery stars which studded that section of the heavens. As he watched, a faint glow suffused the western sky, gradually growing brighter, the full moon majestically lifted itself above the horizon, casting its pale, ethereal radiance upon the dying world beneath. It was increased to many times the size Professor Jameson had ever seen it during his natural lifetime. The earth's greater attraction was drawing upon the moon just as the sun was pulling the earth ever nearer itself.  This cheerless landscape confronting the professor represented the state of existence to which the earth had come. It was a magnificent spread of loneliness which bore no witness to the fact that it had seen the teeming of life in better ages long ago. The weird, yet beautiful scene, spread in a melancholy panorama before his eyes, drove his thoughts into gloomy abstraction with its dismal, depressing influence. Its funereal, oppressive aspect smote him suddenly with the chill of a terrible loneliness.  25X-987 aroused Professor Jameson from his lethargic reverie. \"Let us walk around and see what we can find. I can understand how you feel in regard to the past. It is quite a shock--but it must happen to all worlds sooner or later--even to Zor. When that time comes, the Zoromes will find a new planet on which to live."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26906"],["title","The Jameson Satellite (#4)"],["body"," If you travel with us, you will become accustomed to the sight of seeing dead, lifeless worlds as well as new and beautiful ones pulsating with life and energy. Of course, this world being your own, holds a peculiar sentimental value to you, but it is really one planet among billions.\"  Professor Jameson was silent.  \"I wonder whether or not there are any ruins here to be found?\" queried 25X-987.  \"I don't believe so,\" replied the professor. \"I remember hearing an eminent scientist of my day state that, given fifty thousand years, every structure and other creation of man would be obliterated entirely from off the earth's surface.\"  \"And he was right,\" endorsed the machine man of Zor. \"Time is a great effacer.\"  For a long time the machine men wandered over the dreary surface of the earth, and then 25X-987 suggested a change of territory to explore. In the space ship, they moved around the earth to the other side, still keeping to the belt of shadowland which completely encircled the globe like some gigantic ring. Where they now landed arose a series of cones with hollow peaks.  \"Volcanoes!\" exclaimed the professor.  \"Extinct ones,\" added the machine man.  Leaving the space ship, the fifty or more machine men, including also Professor Jameson, were soon exploring the curiously shaped peaks. The professor, in his wanderings had strayed away from the rest, and now advanced into one of the cup-like depressions of the peak, out of sight of his companions, the Zoromes.     CHAPTER V  _Eternity or Death_   He was well in the center of the cavity when the soft ground beneath him gave way suddenly and he catapulted below into the darkness. Through the Stygian gloom he fell in what seemed to be an endless drop. He finally crashed upon something hard. The thin crust of the volcano's mouth had broken through, precipitating him into the deep, hollow interior.  It must have been a long ways to fall--or so it had seemed. Why was he not knocked senseless or killed? Then he felt himself over with three tentacles. His metal legs were four broken, twisted masses of metal, while the lower half of his cubic body was jammed out of shape and split. He could not move, and half of his six tentacles were paralyzed.  How would he ever get out of there? he wondered. The machine men of Zor might never find him. What would happen to him, then? He would remain in this deathless, monotonous state forever in the black hole of the volcano's interior unable to move. What a horrible thought! He could not starve to death; eating was unknown among the Zoromes, the machines requiring no food. He could not even commit suicide. The only way for him to die would be to smash the strong metal head, and in his present immovable condition, this was impossible.  It suddenly occurred to him to radiate thoughts for help. Would the Zoromes receive his messages? He wondered how far the telepathic messages would carry. He concentrated the powers of his mind upon the call for help, and repeatedly stated his position and plight. He then left his mind clear to receive the thought answers of the Zoromes. He received none. Again he tried. Still he received no welcoming answer. Professor Jameson became dejected.         *       *       *       *       *  It was hopeless. The telepathic messages had not reached the machine men of Zor. They were too far away, just as one person may be out of earshot of another's voice. He was doomed to a terrible fate of existence! It were better that his rocket had never been found. He wished that the Zoromes had destroyed him instead of bringing him back to life--back to this!  His thoughts were suddenly broken in upon.  \"We're coming!\"  \"Don't give up hope!\"  If the professor's machine body had been equipped with a heart, it would have sung for joy at these welcome thought impressions. A short time later there appeared in the ragged break of the volcano's mouth, where he had fallen through, the metal head of one of the machine men.  \"We shall have you out of there soon,\" he said.         *       *       *       *       *  The professor never knew how they managed it for he lost consciousness under some strange ray of light they projected down upon him in his prison. When he came to consciousness once more, it was to find himself inside the space ship.  \"If you had fallen and had smashed your head, it would have been all over with you,\" were the first thought impulses which greeted him. \"As it is, however, we can fix you up first rate.\"  \"Why didn't you answer the first time I called to you?\" asked the professor. \"Didn't you hear me?\"  \"We heard you, and we answered, but you didn't hear us. You see, your brain is different than ours, and though you can send thought waves as far as we can you cannot receive them from such a great distance.\"  \"I'm wrecked,\" said the professor, gazing at his twisted limbs, paralyzed tentacles and jammed body.  \"We shall repair you,\" came the reply. \"It is your good fortune that your head was not crushed.\"  \"What are you going to do with me?\" queried the professor. \"Will you remove my brains to another machine?\"  \"No, it isn't necessary. We shall merely remove your head and place it upon another machine body.\"  The Zoromes immediately set to work upon the task, and soon had Professor Jameson's metal head removed from the machine which he had wrecked in his fall down the crater. All during the painless operation, the professor kept up a series of thought exchanges in conversation with the Zoromes, and it seemed but a short time before his head surmounted a new machine and he was ready for further exploration. In the course of his operation, the space ship had moved to a new position, and now as they emerged 25X-987 kept company with Professor Jameson.  \"I must keep an eye on you,\" he said. \"You will be getting into more trouble before you get accustomed to the metal bodies.\"  But Professor Jameson was doing a great deal of thinking. Doubtlessly, these strange machine men who had picked up his rocket in the depths of space and had brought him back to life, were expecting him to travel with them and become adopted into the ranks of the Zoromes. Did he want to go with them? He couldn't decide. He had forgotten that the machine men could read his innermost thoughts.  \"You wish to remain here alone upon the earth?\" asked 25X-987. \"It is your privilege if you really want it so.\"  \"I don't know,\" replied Professor Jameson truthfully.         *       *       *       *       *  He gazed at the dust around his feet. It had probably been the composition of men, and had changed from time to time into various other atomic structures--of other queer forms of life which had succeeded mankind. It was the law of the atom which never died. And now he had within his power perpetual existence. He could be immortal if he wished! It would be an immortality of never-ending adventures in the vast, endless Universe among the galaxy of stars and planets.  A great loneliness seized him. Would he be happy among these machine men of another far-off world--among these Zoromes? They were kindly and solicitous of his welfare. What better fate could he expect? Still, a longing for his own kind arose in him--the call of humanity. It was irresistible. What could he do? Was it not in vain? Humanity had long since disappeared from the earth--millions of years ago. He wondered what lay beyond the pales of death--the real death, where the body decomposed and wasted away to return to the dust of the earth and assume new atomic structures.  He had begun to wonder whether or not he had been dead all these forty millions of years--suppose he had been merely in a state of suspended animation. He had remembered a scientist of his day, who had claimed that the body does not die at the point of official death. According to the claims of this man, the cells of the body did not die at the moment at which respiration, heart beats and the blood circulation ceased, but it existed in the semblance of life for several days afterward, especially in the cells of the bones, which died last of all.  Perhaps when he had been sent out into space in his rocket right after his death, the action of the cosmic void was to halt his slow death of the cells in his body, and hold him in suspended animation during the ensuing millions of years. Suppose he should really die--destroying his own brain? What lay beyond real death? Would it be a better plane of existence than the Zoromes could offer him? Would he rediscover humanity, or had they long since arisen to higher planes of existence or reincarnation? Did time exist beyond the mysterious portals of death? If not, then it was possible for him to join the souls of the human race. Had he really been dead all this time? If so, he knew what to expect in case he really destroyed his own brain. Oblivion!  Again the intense feeling of loneliness surged over him and held him within its melancholy grasp. Desperately, he decided to find the nearest cliff and jump from it--head-first! Humanity called; no man lived to companion him. His four metal limbs carried him swiftly to the summit of a nearby precipice. Why not gamble on the hereafter? 25X-987, understanding his trend of thought, did not attempt to restrain him. Instead, the machine man of Zor waited patiently.  As Professor Jameson stood there meditating upon the jump which would hurl him now into a new plane of existence--or into oblivion, the thought transference of 25X-987 reached him. It was laden with the wisdom born of many planets and thousands of centuries' experience.  \"Why jump?\" asked the machine man. \"The dying world holds your imagination within a morbid clutch. It is all a matter of mental condition. Free your mind of this fascinating influence and come with us to visit other worlds, many of them are both beautiful and new. You will then feel a great difference.  \"Will you come?\"  The professor considered for a moment as he resisted the impulse to dive off"]]]
