All you have to do is put that helmet on my head and change me back to myself. Is that too much to ask?\"  \"Certainly, of a robot,\" ENIAC said stiffly. \"No more shilly-shallying. It's lucky you are wearing the Ivan-matrix, so I can impose my will on you. Put your eyeprint on this. Instantly!\"  Martin rushed behind the couch and hid. The robot advanced menacingly. And at that moment, pushed to the last ditch, Martin suddenly remembered something.  He faced the robot.          *        *       *        *        *  \"Wait,\" he said. \"You don't understand. I can't eyeprint that thing. It won't work on me. Don't you realize that? It's supposed to take the eyeprint--\"  \"--of the rod-and-cone pattern of the retina,\" the robot said. \"So--\"  \"So how can it do that unless I can keep my eye open for twenty seconds? My perceptive reaction-thresholds are Ivan's aren't they? I can't control the reflex of blinking. I've got a coward's synapses. And they'd force me to shut my eyes tight the second that gimmick got too close to them.\"  \"Hold them open,\" the robot suggested. \"With your fingers.\"  \"My fingers have reflexes too,\" Martin argued, moving toward a sideboard. \"There's only one answer. I've got to get drunk. If I'm half stupefied with liquor, my reflexes will be so slow I won't be able to shut my eyes. And don't try to use force, either. If I dropped dead with fear, how could you get my eyeprint then?\"  \"Very easily,\" the robot said. \"I'd pry open your lids--\"  Martin hastily reached for a bottle on the sideboard, and a glass. But his hand swerved aside and gripped, instead, a siphon of soda water.  \"--only,\" ENIAC went on, \"the forgery might be detected.\"  Martin fizzled the glass full of soda and took a long drink.  \"I won't be long getting drunk,\" he said, his voice thickening. \"In fact, it's beginning to work already. See? I'm co√∂perating.\"  The robot hesitated.  \"Well, hurry up about it,\" he said, and sat down.  Martin, about to take another drink, suddenly paused, staring at ENIAC. Then, with a sharply indrawn breath, he lowered the glass.  \"What's the matter now?\" the robot asked. \"Drink your--what is it?\"  \"It's whiskey,\" Martin told the inexperienced automaton, \"but now I see it all. You've put poison in it. So that's your plan, is it? Well, I won't touch another drop, and now you'll never get my eyeprint. I'm no fool.\"  \"Cog Almighty,\" the robot said, rising. \"You poured that drink yourself. How could I have poisoned it? Drink!\"  \"I won't,\" Martin said, with a coward's stubbornness, fighting back the growing suspicion that the drink might really be toxic.  \"You swallow that drink,\" ENIAC commanded, his voice beginning to quiver slightly. \"It's perfectly harmless.\"  \"Then prove it!\" Martin said cunningly. \"Would you be willing to switch glasses? Would you drink this poisoned brew yourself?\"  \"How do you expect me to drink?\" the robot demanded. \"I--\" He paused. \"All right, hand me the glass,\" he said. \"I'll take a sip. Then you've got to drink the rest of it.\"  \"Aha!\" Martin said. \"You betrayed yourself that time. You're a robot. You can't drink, remember? Not the same way that I can, anyhow. Now I've got you trapped, you assassin. _There's_ your brew.\" He pointed to a floor-lamp. \"Do you dare to drink with me now, in your electrical fashion, or do you admit you are trying to poison me? Wait a minute, what am I saying? That wouldn't prove a--\"  \"Of course it would,\" the robot said hastily. \"You're perfectly right, and it's very cunning of you. We'll drink together, and that will prove your whiskey's harmless--so you'll keep on drinking till your reflexes slow down, see?\"  \"Well,\" Martin began uncertainly, but the unscrupulous robot unscrewed a bulb from the floor lamp, pulled the switch, and inserted his finger into the empty socket, which caused a crackling flash. \"There,\" the robot said. \"It isn't poisoned, see?\"  \"You're not swallowing it,\" Martin said suspiciously. \"You're holding it in your mouth--I mean your finger.\"  ENIAC again probed the socket.  \"Well, all right, perhaps,\" Martin said, in a doubtful fashion. \"But I'm not going to risk your slipping a powder in my liquor, you traitor. You're going to keep up with me, drink for drink, until I can eyeprint that gimmick of yours--or else I stop drinking. But does sticking your finger in that lamp really prove my liquor isn't poisoned? I can't quite--\"  \"Of course it does,\" the robot said quickly. \"I'll prove it. I'll do it again ... _f(t)_. Powerful DC, isn't it? Certainly it proves it. Keep drinking, now.\"          *        *       *        *        *  His gaze watchfully on the robot, Martin lifted his glass of club soda.  \"_F ff ff f(t)!_\" cried the robot, some time later, sketching a singularly loose smile on its metallic face.  \"Best fermented mammoth's milk I ever tasted,\" Martin agreed, lifting his tenth glass of soda-water. He felt slightly queasy and wondered if he might be drowning.  \"Mammoth's milk?\" asked ENIAC thickly. \"What year is this?\"  Martin drew a long breath. Ivan's capacious memory had served him very well so far. Voltage, he recalled, increased the frequency of the robot's thought-patterns and disorganized ENIAC's memory--which was being proved before his eyes. But the crux of his plan was yet to come....  \"The year of the great Hairy One, of course,\" Martin said briskly. \"Don't you remember?\"  \"Then you--\" ENIAC strove to focus upon his drinking-companion. \"You must be Mammoth-Slayer.\"  \"That's it!\" Martin cried. \"Have another jolt. What about giving me the treatment now?\"  \"What treatment?\"  Martin looked impatient. \"You said you were going to impose the character-matrix of Mammoth-Slayer on my mind. You said _that_ would insure my optimum ecological adjustment in this temporal phase, and nothing else would.\"  \"Did I? But you're not Mammoth-Slayer,\" ENIAC said confusedly. \"Mammoth-Slayer was the son of the Great Hairy One. What's your mother's name?\"  \"The Great Hairy One,\" Martin replied, at which the robot grated its hand across its gleaming forehead.  \"Have one more jolt,\" Martin suggested. \"Now take out the ecologizer and put it on my head.\"  \"Like this?\" ENIAC asked, obeying. \"I keep feeling I've forgotten something important. _F (t)._\"  Martin adjusted the crystal helmet on his skull. \"Now,\" he commanded. \"Give me the character-matrix of Mammoth-Slayer, son of the Great Hairy One.\"  \"Well--all right,\" ENIAC said dizzily. The red ribbons swirled. There was a flash from the helmet. \"There,\" the robot said. \"It's done. It may take a few minutes to begin functioning, but then for twelve hours you'll--wait! Where are you going?\"  But Martin had already departed.  The robot stuffed the helmet and the quarter-mile of red ribbon back for the last time. He lurched to the floor-lamp, muttering something about one for the road. Afterward, the room lay empty. A fading murmur said, \"_F(t)._\"          *        *       *        *        *  \"Nick!\" Erika gasped, staring at the figure in the doorway. \"Don't stand like that! You frighten me!\"  Everyone in the room looked up abruptly at her cry, and so were just in time to see a horrifying change take place in Martin's shape. It was an illusion, of course, but an alarming one. His knees slowly bent until he was half-crouching, his shoulders slumped as though bowed by the weight of enormous back and shoulder muscles, and his arms swung forward until their knuckles hung perilously near the floor.  Nicholas Martin had at last achieved a personality whose ecological norm would put him on a level with Raoul St. Cyr.  \"Nick!\" Erika quavered.  Slowly Martin's jaw protruded till his lower teeth were hideously visible. Gradually his eyelids dropped until he was peering up out of tiny, wicked sockets. Then, slowly, a perfectly shocking grin broadened Mr. Martin's mouth.  \"Erika,\" he said throatily. \"Mine!\"  And with that, he shambled forward, seized the horrified girl in his arms, and bit her on the ear.  \"Oh, Nick,\" Erika murmured, closing her eyes. \"Why didn't you ever--no, no, _no_! Nick! Stop it! The contract release. We've got to--Nick, what are you doing?\" She snatched at Martin's departing form, but too late.  For all his ungainly and unpleasant gait, Martin covered ground fast. Almost instantly he was clambering over Watt's desk as the most direct route to that startled tycoon. DeeDee looked on, a little surprised. St. Cyr lunged forward.  \"In Mixo-Lydia--\" he began. \"Ha! So!\" He picked up Martin and threw him across the room.  \"Oh, you beast,\" Erika cried, and flung herself upon the director, beating at his brawny chest. On second thought, she used her shoes on his shins with more effect. St. Cyr, no gentleman, turned her around, pinioned her arms behind her, and glanced up at Watt's alarmed cry.  \"Martin! What are you doing?\"  There was reason for his inquiry. Apparently unhurt by St. Cyr's toss, Martin had hit the floor, rolled over and over like a ball, knocked down a floor-lamp with a crash, and uncurled, with an unpleasant expression on his face. He rose crouching, bandy-legged, his arms swinging low, a snarl curling his lips.  \"You take my mate?\" the pithecanthropic Mr. Martin inquired throatily, rapidly losing all touch with the twentieth century. It was a rhetorical question. He picked up the lamp-standard--he did not have to bend to do it--tore off the silk shade as he would have peeled foliage from a tree-limb, and balanced the weapon in his hand. Then he moved forward, carrying the lamp-standard like a spear.  \"I,\" said Martin, \"kill.\"  He then endeavored, with the most admirable single-heartedness, to carry out his expressed intention. The first thrust of the blunt, improvised spear rammed into St. Cyr's solar plexus and drove him back against the wall with a booming thud. This seemed to be what Martin wanted. Keeping one end of his spear pressed into the director's belly, he crouched lower, dug his toes into the rug, and did his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32127"],["title","Wheels Within (#0)"],["body","Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from Galaxy Science Fiction May 1952.

Illustrated by DON SIBLEY         *       *       *       *       *     \"When did the headaches first start?\" asked the neurologist, Dr. Hall.  \"About six months ago,\" Bennett replied.  \"What is your occupation, Mr. Bennett?\"  \"I am a contractor.\"  \"Are you happy in your work?\"  \"Very. I prefer it to any other occupation I know of.\"  \"When your headaches become sufficiently severe, you say that you have hallucinations,\" Hall said. \"Can you describe what you see during those hallucinations?\"  \"At first I had only the impression that I was in a place completely unlike anything I had ever known,\" Bennett answered. \"But each time my impressions became sharper, and I carried a fairly clear picture when my mind returned to normal the last time. I felt then that I had been in a room in a tall building that towered thousands of feet over a great city. I even remembered that the name of the city was Thone. There were other people in the room with me--one person especially. I remembered her very clearly.\"  \"Her?\" Hall asked.  \"Yes.\"  \"Was there anything unusual about this woman?\"  \"Well, yes, there was,\" Bennett said, after a brief and almost embarrassed pause. \"This will sound pretty adolescent, but--\"  Hall leaned forward attentively. \"It may be relevant. You're not here to be judged, you know; I'm trying to help you.\"  Bennett nodded and spoke rapidly, as though trying to finish before he could stop himself. \"She was a woman who exactly fitted an image I've had in mind for as long as I can remember. She was tall, fair--though brunette--very beautiful, very vivid, very well poised. I seem to have known her all my life, but only in my dreams, from my very earliest ones to the present. She's never changed in all that time.\"  He halted as suddenly as he had begun to talk, either having nothing more to say, or unwilling to say it.  \"Have you ever married, Mr. Bennett?\" Hall prodded gently.  \"No, I never have.\" Again, Bennett stopped, adding nothing more to his blunt answer.  \"May I ask why not?\"  Bennett turned his face away. \"I was hoping you wouldn't ask that. It makes me sound like a romantic kid.\" He looked at the doctor almost in defiance. \"I've always felt that some day I would meet this girl, or at least someone very much like her. I know it's not a rational feeling--maybe I've even used it as an excuse not to get married--but it's like spilling salt and throwing a pinch over our shoulder; we aren't superstitious, yet we don't take any chances.\"  Dr. Hall didn't comment. He ended the questioning period and put Bennett through a series of tests. Then they sat down again and Hall offered his diagnosis.  \"The neurological examination is essentially negative, Mr. Bennett. In other words, there is no organic reason that I can find for your headaches. That leaves only one other possibility--an emotional disturbance. I'm a neurologist, remember, not a psychoanalyst. I can only give an opinion about the cause of your complaint.\"  Bennett waited expectantly.  \"Headaches without organic causes are generally the result of repressed anger,\" Hall went on. \"That anger can stem from any number of traumatic situations or attitudes, all deeply buried in the unconscious, of course, or they would not have the power to hurt us. From what we know of you, however, it seems to be the result of frustration. In other words, you have created a fantasy image of a completely unattainable woman, and therefore none of the women you meet can fulfill your expectations. Since she is unattainable, you naturally feel a sense of frustration.\"  \"But who could she be?\" Bennett asked anxiously.  \"Someone you knew in childhood, perhaps. A composite of real and imaginary women. Usually, it is an idealized image of your own mother.\"  Bennett sat frowning. \"All right, let's say that's so. But where do the hallucinations of the city of Thone fit in?\"  \"This is something that has to be tracked down in a series of analytical sessions, so all I can do is guess. If one is unable to reach a goal in a real environment, the obvious answer is to create a fantasy world. That's what you appear to be doing. It's a dangerous situation, Mr. Bennett. Potentially, at least.\"  \"How so?\" Bennett asked, alarmed.  \"The general tendency is toward greater and greater divorcement from reality. I suggest immediate treatment by a competent analyst. If you don't know of one, I can recommend several.\"  \"I'd like to think it over.\"  \"Do that,\" Hall said. \"And call me when you've decided.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The third day after he consulted the neurologist, Bennett's headache returned. As before, drugs were of no help. When the pain became blinding, he lay back on his bed, placed a cold cloth on his forehead, and closed his eyes.  Suddenly the realities he knew were gone and he was back in the dream-city of Thone.  Persons and objects were much clearer now. Bennett saw that he lay in a receptacle shaped like a rectangular metal box. It was padded, reminding him unpleasantly of a coffin. The woman he had seen before was again with him, but now he knew that her name was Lima. Behind her stood a man; a tall, dark man whose eyebrows joined over the bridge of his nose, and whose forehead was creased in a permanent frown. The woman held out her arms to Bennett. Her lips moved, but no sound came from them.  Bennett's spirit seemed to rise from the flesh--he could see his body still lying there--and he followed the woman. As he approached she retreated and, try as he would to reach her, she remained just beyond his grasp.  After what seemed hours of futile pursuit, a cloud formed between him and the woman. When it dissipated, he had left the world of Thone. He was in a trolley-bus, in his own world, and vaguely he recalled having left his room, gone down to the street, and boarded the trolley--during the time he had followed Lima, in his hallucination. It seemed that he had a definite destination then, but now he could not recall what it had been.  His attention was drawn to the outside by the flickering of lights that flashed in through the bus windows. Bennett looked out and saw that he was in the Pleasure Section of the city, traveling through the Street of Carnivals. He watched the fronts of the amusement buildings pass before him and he read their advertisements listlessly.  Suddenly one sign seemed to spring out from all the others:  LIMA MYSTIC OF THE MIND  He left the trolley at the next corner and made his way through the crowd to the brightly lit carnival building.  Inside, he found a chair and seated himself. The show's act appeared about half over. It was pretty evidently charlatan stuff, Bennett decided, but the black-hooded mystic on the stage held his attention. She was a tall woman, with a slender figure and fair flesh. She was poised, or perhaps it was indifference to the crowd.  A runner went through the audience touching articles of clothing or ornaments, and the woman without hesitation named each one he touched. The act was slightly different from most Bennett had seen in that the runner said nothing, merely touching the articles to be named.  The next portion of the show consisted of a mind-reading act. Bennett expected the usual routine of writing a question on paper, which would be sealed in an envelope and placed in a container on the stage.  He was surprised when the runner returned to the crowd and asked for volunteers for thought-reading.  A short man with a bright yellow necktie raised his hand. The runner made his way through the crowd to the man and touched him on the shoulder before turning back to the mystic. He still said nothing.  \"This man is thinking that he should have stayed at home tonight,\" the mystic said. \"There are wrestling matches on the teletone, and he would have enjoyed them more than this show. Besides, he would have spent less money that way than he has tonight. And he does not like to spend money unless he must.\"  A titter of amusement went through the crowd as the man blushed a dull crimson.  The runner touched a second man.  \"This man wishes to know the winner in the eighth race at the horse tracks tomorrow,\" she said. \"I am sorry, but, because of Public Law one thousand thirty-two, Section five-A, I am prohibited from answering a question of that nature.\"  The third person contacted was a woman. She raised her hand, then half changed her mind when she saw that the runner was turning toward her. But then she defiantly tossed her brown hair back from her face and allowed him to touch her shoulder.  \"This woman is wondering if her lover is true to her--and if her husband will find out about them.\"  This time the crowd laughed when the embarrassed woman turned pale and rushed up the aisle toward the exit.  No further hands were raised and the show ended with a short address by the runner: \"I hope you have enjoyed these truly marvelous and mysterious demonstrations. Now the mystic, Lima, is available for a short time for personal interviews. The fee is very reasonable--one dollar a minute. Anyone wishing an interview please step forward.\"  The mystic pulled the hood from her head, smiled, bowed at the crowd, and left the stage.  Bennett gasped.  \"The woman of the city of Thone!\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"You have paid in advance for twenty-five minutes of my time,\" Lima said, as she smiled in amusement. \"Perhaps you had better begin your questions, instead of merely staring at me.\"  Bennett brought his thoughts back with an effort. \"Your performance was exceptionally good,\" he said very soberly.
