He was a handsome young fellow, with a peculiarly pleasant and friendly look about his eyes,--an expression which was quite new to me then, though I soon became familiar with it.  For the rest, he was dark-haired and berry-brown of skin, well-knit and strong, and obviously used to exercising his muscles, but with nothing rough or coarse about him, and clean as might be.  His dress was not like any modern work-a-day clothes I had seen, but would have served very well as a costume for a picture of fourteenth century life: it was of dark blue cloth, simple enough, but of fine web, and without a stain on it.  He had a brown leather belt round his waist, and I noticed that its clasp was of damascened steel beautifully wrought.  In short, he seemed to be like some specially manly and refined young gentleman, playing waterman for a spree, and I concluded that this was the case.  I felt that I must make some conversation; so I pointed to the Surrey bank, where I noticed some light plank stages running down the foreshore, with windlasses at the landward end of them, and said, \"What are they doing with those things here?  If we were on the Tay, I should have said that they were for drawing the salmon nets; but here--\"  \"Well,\" said he, smiling, \"of course that is what they _are_ for.  Where there are salmon, there are likely to be salmon-nets, Tay or Thames; but of course they are not always in use; we don't want salmon _every_ day of the season.\"  I was going to say, \"But is this the Thames?\" but held my peace in my wonder, and turned my bewildered eyes eastward to look at the bridge again, and thence to the shores of the London river; and surely there was enough to astonish me.  For though there was a bridge across the stream and houses on its banks, how all was changed from last night!  The soap- works with their smoke-vomiting chimneys were gone; the engineer's works gone; the lead-works gone; and no sound of rivetting and hammering came down the west wind from Thorneycroft's.  Then the bridge!  I had perhaps dreamed of such a bridge, but never seen such an one out of an illuminated manuscript; for not even the Ponte Vecchio at Florence came anywhere near it.  It was of stone arches, splendidly solid, and as graceful as they were strong; high enough also to let ordinary river traffic through easily.  Over the parapet showed quaint and fanciful little buildings, which I supposed to be booths or shops, beset with painted and gilded vanes and spirelets.  The stone was a little weathered, but showed no marks of the grimy sootiness which I was used to on every London building more than a year old.  In short, to me a wonder of a bridge.  The sculler noted my eager astonished look, and said, as if in answer to my thoughts--  \"Yes, it _is_ a pretty bridge, isn't it?  Even the up-stream bridges, which are so much smaller, are scarcely daintier, and the down-stream ones are scarcely more dignified and stately.\"  I found myself saying, almost against my will, \"How old is it?\"  \"Oh, not very old,\" he said; \"it was built or at least opened, in 2003. There used to be a rather plain timber bridge before then.\"  The date shut my mouth as if a key had been turned in a padlock fixed to my lips; for I saw that something inexplicable had happened, and that if I said much, I should be mixed up in a game of cross questions and crooked answers.  So I tried to look unconcerned, and to glance in a matter-of-course way at the banks of the river, though this is what I saw up to the bridge and a little beyond; say as far as the site of the soap- works.  Both shores had a line of very pretty houses, low and not large, standing back a little way from the river; they were mostly built of red brick and roofed with tiles, and looked, above all, comfortable, and as if they were, so to say, alive, and sympathetic with the life of the dwellers in them.  There was a continuous garden in front of them, going down to the water's edge, in which the flowers were now blooming luxuriantly, and sending delicious waves of summer scent over the eddying stream.  Behind the houses, I could see great trees rising, mostly planes, and looking down the water there were the reaches towards Putney almost as if they were a lake with a forest shore, so thick were the big trees; and I said aloud, but as if to myself--  \"Well, I'm glad that they have not built over Barn Elms.\"  I blushed for my fatuity as the words slipped out of my mouth, and my companion looked at me with a half smile which I thought I understood; so to hide my confusion I said, \"Please take me ashore now: I want to get my breakfast.\"  He nodded, and brought her head round with a sharp stroke, and in a trice we were at the landing-stage again.  He jumped out and I followed him; and of course I was not surprised to see him wait, as if for the inevitable after-piece that follows the doing of a service to a fellow- citizen.  So I put my hand into my waistcoat-pocket, and said, \"How much?\" though still with the uncomfortable feeling that perhaps I was offering money to a gentleman.  He looked puzzled, and said, \"How much?  I don't quite understand what you are asking about.  Do you mean the tide?  If so, it is close on the turn now.\"  I blushed, and said, stammering, \"Please don't take it amiss if I ask you; I mean no offence: but what ought I to pay you?  You see I am a stranger, and don't know your customs--or your coins.\"  And therewith I took a handful of money out of my pocket, as one does in a foreign country.  And by the way, I saw that the silver had oxydised, and was like a blackleaded stove in colour.  He still seemed puzzled, but not at all offended; and he looked at the coins with some curiosity.  I thought, Well after all, he _is_ a waterman, and is considering what he may venture to take.  He seems such a nice fellow that I'm sure I don't grudge him a little over-payment.  I wonder, by the way, whether I couldn't hire him as a guide for a day or two, since he is so intelligent.  Therewith my new friend said thoughtfully:  \"I think I know what you mean.  You think that I have done you a service; so you feel yourself bound to give me something which I am not to give to a neighbour, unless he has done something special for me.  I have heard of this kind of thing; but pardon me for saying, that it seems to us a troublesome and roundabout custom; and we don't know how to manage it. And you see this ferrying and giving people casts about the water is my _business_, which I would do for anybody; so to take gifts in connection with it would look very queer.  Besides, if one person gave me something, then another might, and another, and so on; and I hope you won't think me rude if I say that I shouldn't know where to stow away so many mementos of friendship.\"  And he laughed loud and merrily, as if the idea of being paid for his work was a very funny joke.  I confess I began to be afraid that the man was mad, though he looked sane enough; and I was rather glad to think that I was a good swimmer, since we were so close to a deep swift stream. However, he went on by no means like a madman:  \"As to your coins, they are curious, but not very old; they seem to be all of the reign of Victoria; you might give them to some scantily-furnished museum.  Ours has enough of such coins, besides a fair number of earlier ones, many of which are beautiful, whereas these nineteenth century ones are so beastly ugly, ain't they?  We have a piece of Edward III., with the king in a ship, and little leopards and fleurs- de-lys all along the gunwale, so delicately worked.  You see,\" he said, with something of a smirk, \"I am fond of working in gold and fine metals; this buckle here is an early piece of mine.\"  No doubt I looked a little shy of him under the influence of that doubt as to his sanity.  So he broke off short, and said in a kind voice:  \"But I see that I am boring you, and I ask your pardon.  For, not to mince matters, I can tell that you _are_ a stranger, and must come from a place very unlike England.  But also it is clear that it won't do to overdose you with information about this place, and that you had best suck it in little by little.  Further, I should take it as very kind in you if you would allow me to be the showman of our new world to you, since you have stumbled on me first.  Though indeed it will be a mere kindness on your part, for almost anybody would make as good a guide, and many much better.\"  There certainly seemed no flavour in him of Colney Hatch; and besides I thought I could easily shake him off if it turned out that he really was mad; so I said:  \"It is a very kind offer, but it is difficult for me to accept it, unless--\"  I was going to say, Unless you will let me pay you properly; but fearing to stir up Colney Hatch again, I changed the sentence into, \"I fear I shall be taking you away from your work--or your amusement.\"  \"O,\" he said, \"don't trouble about that, because it will give me an opportunity of doing a good turn to a friend of mine, who wants to take my work here.  He is a weaver from Yorkshire, who has rather overdone himself between his weaving and his mathematics, both indoor work, you see; and being a great friend of mine, he naturally came to me to get him some outdoor work.  If you think you can put up with me, pray take me as your guide.\"  He added presently: \"It is true that I have promised to go up-stream to some special friends of mine, for the hay-harvest; but they won't be ready for us for more than a week: and besides, you might go with me, you know, and see some very nice people, besides making notes of our ways in Oxfordshire.  You could hardly do better if you want to see the country.\"  I felt myself obliged to thank him, whatever might come of it; and he added eagerly:  \"Well, then, that's settled.  I will give my friend a call; he is living in the Guest House like you, and if he isn't up yet, he ought to be this fine summer morning.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3261"],["title","News from Nowhere; Or, An Epoch of Rest (#2)"],["body","he took a little silver bugle-horn from his girdle and blew two or three sharp but agreeable notes on it; and presently from the house which stood on the site of my old dwelling (of which more hereafter) another young man came sauntering towards us.  He was not so well-looking or so strongly made as my sculler friend, being sandy-haired, rather pale, and not stout-built; but his face was not wanting in that happy and friendly expression which I had noticed in his friend.  As he came up smiling towards us, I saw with pleasure that I must give up the Colney Hatch theory as to the waterman, for no two madmen ever behaved as they did before a sane man.  His dress also was of the same cut as the first man's, though somewhat gayer, the surcoat being light green with a golden spray embroidered on the breast, and his belt being of filagree silver- work.  He gave me good-day very civilly, and greeting his friend joyously, said:  \"Well, Dick, what is it this morning?  Am I to have my work, or rather your work?  I dreamed last night that we were off up the river fishing.\"  \"All right, Bob,\" said my sculler; \"you will drop into my place, and if you find it too much, there is George Brightling on the look out for a stroke of work, and he lives close handy to you.  But see, here is a stranger who is willing to amuse me to-day by taking me as his guide about our country-side, and you may imagine I don't want to lose the opportunity; so you had better take to the boat at once.  But in any case I shouldn't have kept you out of it for long, since I am due in the hay- fields in a few days.\"  The newcomer rubbed his hands with glee, but turning to me, said in a friendly voice:  \"Neighbour, both you and friend Dick are lucky, and will have a good time to-day, as indeed I shall too.  But you had better both come in with me at once and get something to eat, lest you should forget your dinner in your amusement.  I suppose you came into the Guest House after I had gone to bed last night?\"  I nodded, not caring to enter into a long explanation which would have led to nothing, and which in truth by this time I should have begun to doubt myself.  And we all three turned toward the door of the Guest House.     CHAPTER III: THE GUEST HOUSE AND BREAKFAST THEREIN   I lingered a little behind the others to have a stare at this house, which, as I have told you, stood on the site of my old dwelling.  It was a longish building with its gable ends turned away from the road, and long traceried windows coming rather low down set in the wall that faced us.  It was very handsomely built of red brick with a lead roof; and high up above the windows there ran a frieze of figure subjects in baked clay, very well executed, and designed with a force and directness which I had never noticed in modern work before.  The subjects I recognised at once, and indeed was very particularly familiar with them.  However, all this I took in in a minute; for we were presently within doors, and standing in a hall with a floor of marble mosaic and an open timber roof.  There were no windows on the side opposite to the river, but arches below leading into chambers, one of which showed a glimpse of a garden beyond, and above them a long space of wall gaily painted (in fresco, I thought) with similar subjects to those of the frieze outside; everything about the place was handsome and generously solid as to material; and though it was not very large (somewhat smaller than Crosby Hall perhaps), one felt in it that exhilarating sense of space and freedom which satisfactory architecture always gives to an unanxious man who is in the habit of using his eyes.  In this pleasant place, which of course I knew to be the hall of the Guest House, three young women were flitting to and fro.  As they were the first of the sex I had seen on this eventful morning, I naturally looked at them very attentively, and found them at least as good as the gardens, the architecture, and the male men.  As to their dress, which of course I took note of, I should say that they were decently veiled with drapery, and not bundled up with millinery; that they were clothed like women, not upholstered like armchairs, as most women of our time are.  In short, their dress was somewhat between that of the ancient classical costume and the simpler forms of the fourteenth century garments, though it was clearly not an imitation of either: the materials were light and gay to suit the season.  As to the women themselves, it was pleasant indeed to see them, they were so kind and happy-looking in expression of face, so shapely and well-knit of body, and thoroughly healthy-looking and strong.  All were at least comely, and one of them very handsome and regular of feature.  They came up to us at once merrily and without the least affectation of shyness, and all three shook hands with me as if I were a friend newly come back from a long journey: though I could not help noticing that they looked askance at my garments; for I had on my clothes of last night, and at the best was never a dressy person.  A word or two from Robert the weaver, and they bustled about on our behoof, and presently came and took us by the hands and led us to a table in the pleasantest corner of the hall, where our breakfast was spread for us; and, as we sat down, one of them hurried out by the chambers aforesaid, and came back again in a little while with a great bunch of roses, very different in size and quality to what Hammersmith had been wont to grow, but very like the produce of an old country garden.  She hurried back thence into the buttery, and came back once more with a delicately made glass, into which she put the flowers and set them down in the midst of our table.  One of the others, who had run off also, then came back with a big cabbage-leaf filled with strawberries, some of them barely ripe, and said as she set them on the table, \"There, now; I thought of that before I got up this morning; but looking at the stranger here getting into your boat, Dick, put it out of my head; so that I was not before _all_ the blackbirds: however, there are a few about as good as you will get them anywhere in Hammersmith this morning.\"  Robert patted her on the head in a friendly manner; and we fell to on our breakfast, which was simple enough, but most delicately cooked, and set on the table with much daintiness.  The bread was particularly good, and was of several different kinds, from the big, rather close, dark-coloured, sweet-tasting farmhouse loaf, which was most to my liking, to the thin pipe-stems of wheaten crust, such as I have eaten in Turin.  As I was putting the first mouthfuls into my mouth my eye caught a carved and gilded inscription on the panelling, behind what we should have called the High Table in an Oxford college hall, and a familiar name in it forced me to read it through.  Thus it ran:     \"_Guests and neighbours_, _on the site of this Guest-hall once stood    the lecture-room of the Hammersmith Socialists_.  _Drink a glass to    the memory_!  _May 1962_.\"  It is difficult to tell you how I felt as I read these words, and I suppose my face showed how much I was moved, for both my friends looked curiously at me, and there was silence between us for a little while.  Presently the weaver, who was scarcely so well mannered a man as the ferryman, said to me rather awkwardly:  \"Guest, we don't know what to call you: is there any indiscretion in asking you your name?\"  \"Well,\" said I, \"I have some doubts about it myself; so suppose you call me Guest, which is a family name, you know, and add William to it if you please.\"  Dick nodded kindly to me; but a shade of anxiousness passed over the weaver's face, and he said--\"I hope you don't mind my asking, but would you tell me where you come from?  I am curious about such things for good reasons, literary reasons.\"  Dick was clearly kicking him underneath the table; but he was not much abashed, and awaited my answer somewhat eagerly.  As for me, I was just going to blurt out \"Hammersmith,\" when I bethought me what an entanglement of cross purposes that would lead us into; so I took time to invent a lie with circumstance, guarded by a little truth, and said:  \"You see, I have been such a long time away from Europe that things seem strange to me now; but I was born and bred on the edge of Epping Forest; Walthamstow and Woodford, to wit.\"  \"A pretty place, too,\" broke in Dick; \"a very jolly place, now that the trees have had time to grow again since the great clearing of houses in 1955.\"  Quoth the irrepressible weaver: \"Dear neighbour, since you knew the Forest some time ago, could you tell me what truth there is in the rumour that in the nineteenth century the trees were all pollards?\"  This was catching me on my archaeological natural-history side, and I fell into the trap without any thought of where and when I was; so I began on it, while one of the girls, the handsome one, who had been scattering little twigs of lavender and other sweet-smelling herbs about the floor, came near to listen, and stood behind me with her hand on my shoulder, in which she held some of the plant that I used to call balm: its strong sweet smell brought back to my mind my very early days in the kitchen-garden at Woodford, and the large blue plums which grew on the wall beyond the sweet-herb patch,--a connection of memories which all boys will see at once.  I started off: \"When I was a boy, and for long after, except for a piece about Queen Elizabeth's Lodge, and for the part about High Beech, the Forest was almost wholly made up of pollard hornbeams mixed with holly thickets.  But when the Corporation of London took it over about twenty- five years ago, the topping and lopping, which was a part of the old commoners' rights, came to an end, and the trees were let to grow.  But I have not seen the place now for many years, except once, when we Leaguers went a pleasuring to High Beech.  I was very much"]]]
