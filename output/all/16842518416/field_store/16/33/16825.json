Drop those guns, every man of you, and get your hands up!\"  Walls spun around with an oath, levelling his atom-pistol. But out of the jungle crashed a streak of fire that hit the captain's arm and sent him reeling.  One of the girls screamed. Another of the _Sunsprite's_ crew had tried to aim his weapon and had been cut down by a second bolt of atomic fire that had hit his leg.  \"I _don't_ want to kill you unless you force me to,\" came that crisp voice from the darkness. \"You have ten seconds to drop the guns.\"  \"That's the chief, Kenniston!\" yelled Holk Or excitedly. \"It's John Dark himself!\"  The dreaded name of the pirate, a synonym for cold ruthlessness, reinforced the threat from the darkness.  Murdock let his weapon fall and shouted, \"Drop the atom-guns, men! If we try to fight, the women will be hurt!\"  The _Sunsprite's_ men dropped their atom-pistols. Instantly out into the brilliant light from the jungle rushed a score of armed pirates. Martians, Earthmen, Venusians and others--this horde represented the criminal under-world of every planet in the System.  In a moment they had those in the clearing completely disarmed and lined up against the ship. All except Holk Or, who was loudly greeting his pirate comrades.  Kenniston saw John Dark coming across the moonslit clearing toward them. The notorious pirate was a tall, bulky Earthman, but he walked with the lightfootedness of a cat in his moonshoes. His black hair was bare, and in the silver light his black-browed, intelligent face was coldly calm as his eyes searched the row of prisoners.  \"So you finally got here, Kenniston. What about the repair-equipment?\" he asked sharply.  Kenniston nodded toward the _Sunsprite_. \"It's in the hold. We got everything you listed.\"  \"Good!\" Dark approved. \"We saw your ship crash-landing today, and started this way at once. We've been beating through the jungle, fighting off the damned Vestans, until we heard the uproar going on here. What happened? Who are these people?\"  Kenniston explained briefly how he had induced Gloria Loring's party to come on a pretended treasure-hunt. He was careful to stress the wealth of the party, and John Dark reacted as he had expected.  \"If they're that wealthy, their families can pay big ransoms. You've done very well, Kenniston.\"  \"What about Ricky?\" asked Kenniston tensely. \"He's all right?\"  \"Sure he's all right--he's up at the camp,\" Dark answered.  Gloria said bitterly to Kenniston, \"You can congratulate yourself. You've managed to save your brother.\"  John Dark addressed her. \"Miss Loring, I presume you and your companions are willing to pay ransom for your crew also? I never take prisoners, unless they promise a good profit.\"  \"Yes, of course we'll pay the ransom of the crew!\" Gloria agreed hastily.  \"Good!\" said the pirate calmly. \"You'll not find your captivity any more irksome than necessary.\"  Mrs. Milsom, the dumpy chaperon, was goggling at the notorious pirate in an extreme of terror. A sardonic gleam came into Dark's eyes as he glanced at her.  \"You're a handsome wench,\" he told the plump dowager with mock admiration. \"I've half a mind to keep you and let the ransom go.\"  \"No, no!\" shrieked the terrified woman.  Dark burst into a roar of laughter. \"All right, my shrinking beauty, we'll accept ransom for you.\"  He turned and shot efficient orders to his subordinates, who by now had gathered behind him.  \"Get that stuff out of the hold, rig up power-sledges, and start freighting it up to the camp. You'll have to cut a path through the jungle--use atom-blasters to burn one out.\"  One of the pirates, a hard-faced Martian, said uneasily, \"That will make a racket that'll bring every Vestan on the asteroid down on us.\"  \"You can keep the Vestans off if you keep your eyes open,\" Dark retorted. \"Get to work, now! We've got to get the stuff up there and repair the _Falcon_ at once. I'll take these prisoners up to camp.\"  Kenniston was grouped with the other prisoners. With a strong escort of armed pirates guarding them, and Dark and Holk Or ahead, they started through the jungle toward the pirate camp.   CHAPTER VI  Asteroid Horror   The pirate encampment was a big clearing hacked from the jungle a mile west of the little lake. In this space lay the long, looming black mass of the most dreaded corsair ship ever to sail the void. The _Falcon_ had been righted to even keel, but its crippled condition was evident in the fused, wrecked condition of its tail rocket-tubes.  The whole camp was enclosed and protected by a shimmering blue dome of electric force. This emanated from a heavy copper cable that completely encircled the clearing, and which drew its power from insulated cables that led into the ship to generators driven by the few cyclotrons still functioning. This protective electric wall had been set up at John Dark's orders to keep out the dreaded Vestans.  John Dark raised his voice as he and his men with their prisoners approached the shimmering wall of the camp.  \"Kin Ibo! Drop the wall for us!\"  They saw the hard-looking Martian who was Dark's second-in-command dive into the ship to turn off the power of the electric barrier. It died, and Dark's party entered the clearing. Then the electric wall sprang into being again behind them.  Kenniston looked swiftly around. There were a score more of the motley pirates here in the camp. Also, near the side of the looming black _Falcon_, were the small, rough log huts that Dark's men had constructed.  Dark's black eyes were triumphant as he told his Martian lieutenant, \"Kenniston and Holk Or brought back the equipment all right, and also brought some people who'll bring big ransom. Their wrecked ship is a few miles south. You go down there with half the men here and help the others bring up the equipment.\"  Kin Ibo, looking a little apprehensively out at the jungle, obeyed. Dark motioned Kenniston and the other captives toward one of the huts by the big ship.  \"That hut will be your quarters until we get the _Falcon_ repaired,\" declared the pirate leader. \"Any of you who try to leave it will be shot at sight. I hope you'll not be foolish enough to attempt escape.\"  \"That's right, folks, you wouldn't have a chance,\" Holk Or told them earnestly. \"Even if you could get out through the electric wall, the Vestans would get you. They're thick in the jungle around here.\"  They silently entered the hut. Its broad open windows admitted enough of the dazzling moonslight to brighten its interior.  A dark, eager-looking young Earthman sprang up as they entered, and rushed to pump Kenniston's hand.  \"Lance, you got back safely!\" he exclaimed. \"Thank the Lord--I've been worrying myself almost crazy about you.\"  \"How about you, Ricky?\" Kenniston asked his young brother anxiously. \"You're all right?\"  Ricky Kenniston nodded quickly. \"Sure, I'm okay. But things haven't been so good here, Lance. The Vestans have got a half-dozen pirates who ventured outside the wall in the last few days. These creatures literally haunt the jungles around here now--I think they've been drawn here from all over the asteroid.\"  Ricky looked wonderingly at Gloria and the others who were entering the hut. \"Lance, who are all these people? Are they prisoners of Dark too?\"  \"Yes, we're prisoners,\" Hugh Murdock told him bitterly, with a savage glance at Kenniston. \"We're prisoners because your brother sacrificed us all to get back here and save _your_ neck.\"  \"Lance, you didn't do that?\" Ricky exclaimed in distress.  \"I had to, Ricky,\" Kenniston protested. \"It meant your life if I didn't.\"  \"Of course,\" Murdock agreed ironically. \"What importance are we, compared to saving your young brother's life?\"  Kenniston spoke slowly, to Murdock and Gloria and the others. \"It wasn't merely Ricky's life at stake that made me sacrifice you all. It was more than that. I tried to tell you before, but you wouldn't listen.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Kenniston went across the hut and brought back the square black medicine-case of his young physician-brother. He opened it, and out of the vials and instruments inside he took a square bottle of milky fluid.  \"This is what I sacrificed everything to save,\" Kenniston said simply.  They all stared. \"What is it?\" Gloria asked, puzzled.  \"It's Ricky's discovery,\" Kenniston said. \"It's a preventative and cure for gravitation-paralysis.\"  Captain Walls, himself an old-time space-man, was first of the group to appreciate the significance of the statement. The captain gasped.  \"A preventative for gravitation-paralysis? Kenniston, are you _sure_?\"  Kenniston nodded gravely. \"Yes. Ricky had been working on the problem a long time, back in the Institute of Planetary Medicine. He thought he'd found a way to prevent gravitation-paralysis, the most awful scourge of all the outer System, the thing that's doomed so many space-men. But his formula required rare elements found only in the outer planets.  \"Ricky and I,\" he continued, \"went out there and secured those elements. He made up this formula, and tried it on a gravitation-paralysis case--a space-man who's lain paralyzed for years. The formula was designed to strengthen the human nervous system against the shock of varying gravitations, to re-establish an already damaged nerve-web. And it worked.\"  Kenniston's voice was husky as he concluded. \"It worked, and that living log became a man again. The formula was a success. Ricky and I started back for Earth, where he intended to announce the discovery and arrange for"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32317"],["title","The World with a Thousand Moons (#8)"],["body","manufacture on a big scale. But, on the way back, Dark's pirates captured us.\"  Kenniston flung out his hand in a tortured gesture. \"_That's_ why I went to any lengths to save Ricky's life! It's because Ricky is the only person who knows the intricate formula of this serum. If he were to die, the secret of the cure would die with him. And that would mean that thousands on thousands more of space-men would be stricken into living death by gravitation-paralysis in the future, just as so many thousands of old friends and shipmates of mine have been stricken in the past!\"  Captain Walls was the first to speak. Quietly, the plump master of the _Sunsprite_ extended his hand.  \"Kenniston, will you shake hands with me? And will you forgive me for everything? You did absolutely right. I'm an old space-man and I _know_ what gravitation-paralysis is.\"  Gloria's dark eyes were glimmering with tears. \"If we'd only known,\" she murmured to Kenniston. \"No one could blame you for sacrificing a lot of worthless idlers like us, for a thing like this.\"  \"But you're going to be all right--all of you,\" Kenniston assured her. \"John Dark will make you pay a big ransom, but you can afford that and you'll get back safely to Earth.\"  \"Thank Heaven for that!\" exclaimed Mrs. Milsom. \"I can't understand all this scientific talk of yours, but I do know that that pirate chief means no good to me. Didn't you see the lustful looks he gave me?\"  The laugh that greeted this lessened the tension. Kenniston turned as Ricky plucked at his arm.  \"What about ourselves, Lance?\" Ricky asked quietly. \"Dark still won't let us go, you know. He still needs me as a doctor.\"  Hugh Murdock stepped forward. \"Dark would let you both go, for a big enough ransom. I'd like to pay it for you.\"  The handsomeness of Murdock's gesture moved Kenniston. He was only able to mutter his thanks.         *       *       *       *       *  While Ricky was treating Captain Walls' burned arm, the officer kept looking fascinatedly at that square bottle of milky fluid.  He said hesitantly, \"I've a son--back on Earth. For five years he's lain in a cot from the gravitation-paralysis that hit him out on Jupiter. Do you suppose--\"  Ricky nodded. \"Yes, Captain. I'm sure that we can cure him, now.\"  There was an uproar out in the clearing. Kenniston went to the door and looked out.  The electric wall had temporarily been dropped, and Kin Ibo and the main body of the pirates were hastily entering the camp with their improvised power-sledges that bore heavy loads of machinery and materials.  Kenniston heard Kin Ibo reporting shrilly to John Dark, \"We lost two men to the Vestans on the way here--and nearly lost two more! All this activity has drawn them from all over the asteroid! Look at that!\"  Outside the electric wall, which had been hastily re-raised, could be glimpsed the shapes of lurking asteroidal animals. Meteor-rats, big striped cats, flame-birds--and every one of those lurking animals bore attached to its neck one of the little gray Vestan parasites.  John Dark was saying harshly, \"We've got to have the rest of those materials to repair the _Falcon_.\"  \"I tell you, it'd be suicide to try another trip through those jungles!\" expostulated the Martian. \"Those Vestans are devils!\"  \"Bah, you Martians are all alike--no good when your superstitions get aroused,\" snorted Dark contemptuously. \"I'll take the men down myself. Come on, men--unload those sledges and we'll go back to the wreck.\"  His indomitable personality drove the scared, unwilling pirates into the task. Again the electric wall was faded out for a moment to let them out.  When they returned some time toward morning, Kenniston heard the crash of atom-guns heralding their approach. And when the wall was momentarily dropped, John Dark and his men stumbled into the camp with their loaded sledges in sweating haste.  \"Turn on the wall again--quick!\" bellowed Dark's bull voice. \"The jungle's swarming with the gray devils now--they got five of us on the way back!\"  Ricky, looking over Kenniston's shoulder, spoke appalledly. \"Good God, Lance--look at them! I didn't know there _were_ so many Vestans!\"  Outside the barrier of shimmering electricity, scores of animals and birds dominated by the dreaded little gray parasitical creatures were now swarming. And their number seemed growing every minute.  \"All this activity of the night has drawn the Vestans from far and wide,\" Kenniston muttered. \"I don't like it. If that electric wall should fail, the creatures would be in on us in a moment.\"  Dark himself seemed to feel something of the same apprehension, for he was shouting urgent orders. \"Hook up those atomic welders, and start putting the new plates into the _Falcon's_ tail. Kin Ibo, have your gang fit in the new rocket-tubes. I'll see to installing the new cycs. If we work, we can get the job done by tomorrow night and get out of here.\"  Through the day, the pirates toiled with an energy that showed their earnest desire to leave the asteroid. That desire was reinforced by the ever-larger number of Vestans that now swarmed outside the wall.  There were literally hundreds of the gray parasites now outside the barrier. To have tried going outside the wall now would have been sheer suicide. The creatures were apparently driven by unholy eagerness to possess themselves of human bodies.  Gloria, looking out with Kenniston, shuddered deeply. \"This horrible world! It's like a nightmare.\"  \"We'll soon be away from it,\" Kenniston reassured. \"See, they've almost finished repairing the _Falcon_.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The urgent toil of the pirates was showing results. By the time night came again, and the meteor-moonlets blazed forth with magic beauty in the dark heavens, the task of repair was almost done.  Kenniston and his companions had not ventured forth from the hut. Pirates were everywhere in the clearing, and all had heard John Dark's strict order to blast down the captives if they left their prison.  But from the hut, Kenniston and the others could see that the horde of Vestan-dominated animals around the camp had further increased. With ghastly avidity, they kept circling the shimmering, electric wall.  Kenniston turned in alarm at a ripping sound from the back of the log hut. Two of the logs were being torn out bodily. The battered green face and giant shoulders of Holk Or came through the opening.  \"Kenniston, I came in this way because I didn't dare let Dark see me talking to you!\" the Jovian exclaimed. His face was urgent in expression. \"I've found out that Dark doesn't mean to let your friends here get away from Vesta alive.\"  \"What?\" exclaimed Kenniston. \"That's impossible! Dark said he was going to hold Gloria and the others for ransom.\"  Holk Or nodded hastily. \"I know, and he meant it, then. But since then, he's found out something that's changed his plans. He found it out from me--like a big fool, I told him everything when he questioned me.\"  The Jovian continued rapidly. \"I told him that Murdock had sent that telaudio message back to Patrol headquarters, asking about my record. Now Dark figures that the Patrol will come out here to find out if that message meant that some of John Dark's outfit had actually escaped.  \"Dark wants the Patrol to keep thinking that he and his outfit were destroyed--so he can slip out to Pluto and prepare a new base. So Dark, when he leaves here, is going to drop Miss Loring and her friends by the wrecked _Sunsprite_, so the Patrol will find 'em dead by the wreck and will believe their cruiser crashed accidentally. That way, they won't go on searching as they would if Miss Loring's party was all missing. And Dark will have a chance to get out to Pluto without an alarm going out.\"  Kenniston was suspicious. \"Why do you tell us this, Holk? You're one of the pirates yourself.\"  \"I know, but I'm afraid Dark means to drop _me_ with the others by the _Sunsprite_!\" Holk Or exclaimed. \"He didn't say so, but I believe he figures on doing it so that the telaudio inquiry about me would be explained when I was found dead with the others by the wreck.\"  Murdock said swiftly, \"The Jovian's right, Kenniston. All this is just what Dark _would_ do, to hide his trail, now that he knows my telaudio message may have aroused the Patrol's suspicion.\"  Holk Or said emphatically, \"I'm with you if you can figure out any way to take the _Falcon_, Kenniston!\"  Kenniston paced to and fro. His whole mind was suddenly in a wild turmoil of stark fears. This meant death for Gloria and the others, and the ultimate responsibility for that death would be his.  \"There is one possible chance for us to take the _Falcon_,\" he muttered finally. \"But my God, it seems like an insane idea--\"  \"Wait a minute!\" Captain Walls interrupted. \"Dark won't drop you and your brother to die, Kenniston. He still needs your brother as a physician. You two will be safe even if we are killed.\"  \"What of that? I can't let Gloria and the rest of you be murdered! I was willing to sacrifice you when I thought it was only a question of your being held for ransom, but this changes everything,\" Kenniston said wildly.  \"It doesn't change anything,\" the captain said firmly. \"Your duty is to keep your brother alive at all costs, to save that formula that means life and hope for thousands of gravitation-paralysis victims like my son.\"  \"You mean--I should let you all be killed so Ricky and I can be saved?\" Kenniston cried. \"I'm damned if I will!\"  \"We'll never do that!\" Ricky Kenniston agreed warmly. \"No formula in the world is worth that.\"  \"_This_ formula is,\" Gloria said earnestly to Kenniston. \"The captain is right.\"  \"I won't do it,\" Kenniston repeated. \"I have an idea by which we might be able to take the _Falcon_. We're going to try it.\"  \"Be reasonable, Kenniston,\" pleaded Hugh Murdock. \"None of us except Holk Or has a weapon. What chance would we have against half a hundred armed pirates?\"         *       *       *       *   "]]]
