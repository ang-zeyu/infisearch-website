Harkaway was too prone to interpret alien traits in terms of terrestrial culture. Previously, since all intelligent life-forms with which the _Herringbone_ had come into contact had already been discovered by somebody else, that didn't matter too much. In this instance, however, any mistakes of contact or interpretation mattered terribly. And Iversen couldn't see Harkaway not making a mistake; the boy simply didn't have it in him.  \"You know you're superimposing our attitude on theirs,\" the junior officer continued tactlessly. \"The Flimbotzik are a simple, friendly, _shig-livi_ people, closely resembling some of our historical primitives--in a nice way, of course.\"  \"None of our primitives had space travel,\" Iversen pointed out.  \"Well, you couldn't really call those things spaceships,\" Harkaway said deprecatingly.  \"They go through space, don't they? I don't know what else you'd call them.\"  \"One judges the primitiveness of a race by its cultural and technological institutions,\" Harkaway said, with a lofty smile. \"And these people are laughably backward. Why, they even believe in reincarnation--_mpoola_, they call it.\"  \"How do you know all this?\" Iversen demanded. \"Don't tell me you profess to speak the language already?\"  \"It's not a difficult language,\" Harkaway said modestly, \"and I have managed to pick up quite a comprehensive smattering. I dare-say I haven't caught all the nuances--_heeka lob peeka_, as the Flimbotzik themselves say--but they are a very simple people and probably they don't have--\"  \"Are we going to keep them waiting,\" Iversen asked, \"while we discuss nuances? Since you say you speak the language so well, suppose you make them a pretty speech all about how the Earth government extends the--I suppose it would be hand, in this instance--of friendship to Flimbot and--\"  Harkaway blushed. \"I sort of did that already, acting as your deputy. _Mpoo_--status--means so much in these simple societies, you know, and they seemed to expect something of the sort. However, I'll introduce you to the Flimflim--the king, you know--\" he pointed to an imposing individual in the forefront of the crowd--\"and get over all the amenities, shall I?\"  \"It would be jolly good of you,\" Iversen said frigidly.         *       *       *       *       *  It was a pity they hadn't discovered Flimbot much earlier in their survey of the Virago System, Iversen thought with regret, because it was truly a pleasant spot and a week was very little time in which to explore a world and study a race, even one as simple as the gentle Flimbotzik actually turned out to be. It seemed amazing that they should have developed anything as advanced as space travel, when their only ground conveyances were a species of wagon drawn by plookik, a species of animal.  But Iversen had no time for further investigation. The _Herringbone's_ fuel supply was calculated almost to the minute and so, willy-nilly, the Earthmen had to leave beautiful Flimbot at the end of the week, knowing little more about the Flimbotzik than they had before they came. Only Harkaway, who had spent the three previous weeks on Flimbot, had any further knowledge of the Flimbotzik--and Iversen had little faith in any data he might have collected.  \"I don't believe Harkaway knows the language nearly as well as he pretends to,\" Iversen told the first officer as both of them watched the young lieutenant make the formal speech of farewell.  \"Come now,\" the first officer protested. \"Seems to me the boy is doing quite well. Acquired a remarkable command of the language, considering he's been here only four weeks.\"  \"Remarkable, I'll grant you, but is it accurate?\"  \"He seems to communicate and that is the ultimate objective of language, is it not?\"  \"Then why did the Flimbotzik fill the tanks with wine when I distinctly told him to ask for water?\"  Of course the ship could synthesize water from its own waste products, if necessary, but there was no point in resorting to that expedient when a plentiful supply of pure H_{2}O was available on the world.  \"A very understandable error, sir. Harkaway explained it to me. It seems the word for water, _m'koog_, is very similar to the word for wine, _mk'oog_. Harkaway himself admits his pronunciation isn't perfect and--\"  \"All right,\" Iversen interrupted. \"What I'd like to know is what happened to the _mk'oog_, then--\"  \"The m'koog, you mean? It's in the tanks.\"  \"--because, when they came to drain the wine out of the tanks to put the water in, the tanks were already totally empty.\"  \"I have no idea,\" the first officer said frostily, \"no idea at all. If you'll glance at my papers, you'll note I'm Temperance by affiliation, but if you'd like to search my cabin, anyway, I--\"  \"By Miaplacidus, man,\" Iversen exclaimed, \"I wasn't accusing you! Of that, anyway!\"  Everybody on the vessel was so confoundedly touchy. Lucky they had a stable commanding officer like himself, or morale would simply go to pot.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Well, it's all over,\" Harkaway said, joining them up at the airlock in one lithe bound--a mean feat in that light gravity. \"And a right good speech, if I do say so myself. The Flimflim says he will count the thlubbzik with ardent expectation until the mission from Earth arrives with the promised gifts.\"  \"Just what gifts did you take it upon yourself to--\" Iversen began, when he was interrupted by a voice behind them crying, \"Woe, woe, woe!\"  And, thrusting himself past the three other officers, Dr. Smullyan addressed the flim'puu, or farewell committee, assembled outside the ship. \"Do not let the Earthmen return to your fair planet, O happily ignorant Flimbotzik,\" he declaimed, \"lest wretchedness and misery be your lot as a result. Tell them, 'Hence!' Tell them, 'Begone!' Tell them, 'Avaunt!' For, know ye, humanity is a blight, a creeping canker--\"  He was interrupted by the captain's broad palm clamping down over his mouth.  \"Clap him in the brig, somebody, until we get clear of this place,\" Iversen ordered wearily. \"If Harkaway could pick up the Flimbotzi language, the odds are that some of the natives have picked up Terran.\"  \"That's right, always keep belittling me,\" Harkaway said sulkily as two of the crewmen carried off the struggling medical officer, who left an aromatic wake behind him that bore pungent testimonial to where a part, at least, of the _mk'oog_ had gone. \"No wonder it took me so long to find myself.\"  \"Oh, have you found yourself at last?\" Iversen purred. \"Splendid! Now that you know where you are, supposing you do me a big favor and go lose yourself again while we make ready for blastoff.\"  \"For shame,\" said the first officer as Harkaway stamped off. \"For shame!\"  \"The captain's a hard man,\" observed the chief petty officer, who was lounging negligently against a wall, doing nothing.  \"Ay, that he is,\" agreed the crewman who was assisting him. \"That he is--a hard man, indeed.\"  \"By Caroli, be quiet, all of you!\" Iversen yelled. The very next voyage, he was going to have a new crew if he had to transfer to Colonization to do it! Even colonists couldn't be as obnoxious as the sons of space with which he was cursed.         *       *       *       *       *  It was only after the _Herringbone_ had left the Virago System entirely that Iversen discovered Harkaway had taken the greech along.  \"But you can't abscond with one of the natives' pets!\" he protested, overlooking, for the sake of rhetoric, the undeniable fact that Harkaway had already done so and that there could be no turning back. It would expend too much precious fuel and leave them stranded for life on Virago XI^a.  \"Nonsense, sir!\" Harkaway retorted. \"Didn't the Flimflim say everything on Flimbot was mine? _Thlu'pt shig-nliv, snusnigg bnig-nliv_ were his very words. Anyhow, they have plenty more greechi. They won't miss this little one.\"  \"But he may have belonged to someone,\" Iversen objected. \"An incident like this could start a war.\"  \"I don't see how he could have belonged to anyone. Followed me around most of the time I was there. We've become great pals, haven't we, little fellow?\" He ruffled the greech's pink fur and the creature gave a delighted squeal.  Iversen could already see that the greechik were going to be Flimbot's first lucrative export. From time immemorial, the people of Earth had been susceptible to cuddly little life-forms, which was why Earth had nearly been conquered by the zz^{iu} from Sirius VII, before they discovered them to be hostile and quite intelligent life-forms rather than a new species of tabby.  \"Couldn't bear to leave him,\" Harkaway went on as the greech draped itself around his shoulders and regarded Iversen with large round blue eyes. \"The Flimflim won't mind, because I promised him an elephant.\"  \"You mean the diplomatic mission will have to waste valuable cargo space on an _elephant_!\" Iversen sputtered. \"And you should know, if anyone does, just how spacesick an elephant can get. By Pherkad, Lieutenant Harkaway, you had no authority to make any promises to the Flimflim!\"  \"I discovered the Flimbotzik,\" Harkaway said sullenly. \"_I_ learned the language. _I_ established rapport. Just because you happen to be the commander of this expedition doesn't mean you're God, Captain Iversen!\"  \"Harkaway,\" the captain barked, \"this smacks of downright mutiny! Go to your cabin forthwith and memorize six verses of the Spaceman's Credo!\"  The greech lifted its head and barked back at Iversen, again. \"That's my brave little watch-greech,\" Harkaway said fondly. \"As a matter of fact, sir,\" he told the captain, \"that was just what I was proposing to do myself. Go to my cabin, I mean; I have no time to waste on inferior prose. I plan to spend the rest of the voyage, or such part as I can spare from my duties--\"  \"You're relieved of them,\" Iversen said grimly.  \"--working on my book. It's all about the doctrine of _mpoola_--reincarnation, or, if you prefer,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31664"],["title","Once a Greech (#2)"],["body","mpsychosis. The Flimbotzi religion is so similar to many of the earlier terrestrial theologies--Hindu, Greek, Egyptian, Southern Californian--that sometimes one is almost tempted to stop and wonder if simplicity is not the essence of truth.\"  Iversen knew that, for the sake of discipline, he should not, once he had ordered Harkaway to his cabin, stop to bandy words, but he was a chronic word-bandier, having inherited the trait from his stalwart Viking ancestors. \"How can you have learned all about their religion, their doctrine of reincarnation, in just four ridiculously short weeks?\"  \"It's a gift,\" Harkaway said modestly.  \"Go to your cabin, sir! No, wait a moment!\" For, suddenly overcome by a strange, warm, utterly repulsive emotion, Iversen pointed a quivering finger at the caterpillar. \"Did you bring along the proper food for that--that thing? Can't have him starving, you know,\" he added gruffly. After all, he was a humane man, he told himself; it wasn't that he found the creature tugging at his heart-strings, or anything like that.  \"Oh, he'll eat anything we eat, sir. As long as it's not meat. All the species on Flimbot are herbivores. I can't figure out whether the Flimbotzik themselves are vegetarians because they practice _mpoola_, or practice _mpoola_ because they're--\"  \"I don't want to hear another word about _mpoola_ or about Flimbot!\" Iversen yelled. \"Get out of here! And stay away from the library!\"  \"I have already exhausted its painfully limited resources, sir.\" Harkaway saluted with grace and withdrew to his cabin, wearing the greech like an affectionate lei about his neck.         *       *       *       *       *  Iverson heard no more about _mpoola_ from Harkaway--who, though he did not remain confined to his cabin when he had pursuits to pursue in other parts of the ship, at least had the tact to keep out of the captain's way as much as possible--but the rest of his men seemed able to talk of nothing else. The voyage back from a star system was always longer in relative terms than the voyage out, because the thrill of new worlds to explore was gone; already anticipating boredom, the men were ripe for almost any distraction.  On one return voyage, the whole crew had set itself to the study of Hittite with very creditable results. On another, they had all devoted themselves to the ancient art of alchemy, and, after nearly blowing up the ship, had come up with an elixir which, although not the quintessence--as they had, in their initial enthusiasm, alleged--proved to be an effective cure for hiccups. Patented under the name of Herringbone Hiccup Shoo, it brought each one of them an income which would have been enough to support them in more than modest comfort for the rest of their lives.  However, the adventurous life seemed to exert an irresistible lure upon them and they all shipped upon the _Herringbone_ again--much to the captain's dismay, for he had hoped for a fresh start with a new crew and there seemed to be no way of getting rid of them short of reaching retirement age.  The men weren't quite ready to accept _mpoola_ as a practical religion--Harkaway hadn't finished his book yet--but as something very close to it. The concept of reincarnation had always been very appealing to the human mind, which would rather have envisaged itself perpetuated in the body of a cockroach than vanishing completely into nothingness.  \"It's all so logical, sir,\" the first officer told Iversen. \"The individuality or the soul or the psyche--however you want to look at it--starts the essentially simple cycle of life as a greech--\"  \"Why as a greech?\" Iversen asked, humoring him for the moment. \"There are lower life-forms on Flimbot.\"  \"I don't know.\" The first officer sounded almost testy. \"That's where Harkaway starts the progression.\"  \"Harkaway! Is there no escaping that cretin's name?\"  \"Sir,\" said the first officer, \"may I speak frankly?\"  \"No,\" Iversen said, \"you may not.\"  \"Your skepticism arises less from disbelief than from the fact that you are jealous of Harkaway because it was he who made the great discovery, not you.\"  \"Which great discovery?\" Iversen asked, sneering to conceal his hurt at being so overwhelmingly misunderstood. \"Flimbot or _mpoola_?\"  \"Both,\" the first officer said. \"You refuse to accept the fact that this hitherto incompetent youth has at last blossomed forth in the lambent colors of genius, just as the worthy greech becomes a zkoort, and the clean-living zkoort in his turn passes on to the next higher plane of existence, which is, in the Flimbotzik scale--\"  \"Spare me the theology, please,\" Iversen begged. \"Once a greech, always a greech, I say. And I can't help thinking that somehow, somewhere, Harkaway has committed some horrible error.\"  \"Humanity is frail, fumbling, futile,\" Dr. Smullyan declared, coming upon them so suddenly that both officers jumped. \"To err is human, to forgive divine, and I am an atheist, thank God!\"  \"That _mk'oog_ is powerful stuff,\" the first officer said. \"Or so they tell me,\" he added.  \"This is more than mere _mk'oog_,\" Iversen said sourly. \"Smullyan has been too long in space. It hits everyone in the long run--some sooner than others.\"  \"Captain,\" the doctor said, ignoring these remarks as he ignored everything not on a cosmic level, which included the crew's ailments, \"I am in full agreement with you. Young Harkaway has doomed that pretty little planet--\"  \"Moon,\" the first officer corrected. \"It's a satellite, not a--\"  \"We ourselves were doomed _ab origine_, but the tragic flaw inherent in each one of our pitiful species is contagious, dooming all with whom we come in contact. And Harkaway is the most infectious carrier on the ship. Woe, I tell you. Woe!\" And, with a hollow moan, the doctor left them to meditate upon the state of their souls, while he went off to his secret stores of oblivion.  \"Wonder where he's hidden that _mk'oog_,\" Iversen brooded. \"I've turned the ship inside out and I haven't been able to locate it.\"  The first officer shivered. \"Somehow, although I know Smullyan's part drunk, part mad, he makes me a little nervous. He's been right so often on all the other voyages.\"  \"Ruchbah!\" Iversen said, not particularly grateful for support from such a dithyrambic source as the ship's medical officer. \"Anyone who prophesies doom has a hundred per cent chance of ultimately being right, if only because of entropy.\"  He was still brooding over the first officer's thrust, even though he had been well aware that most of his officers and men considered him a sorehead for doubting Harkaway in the young man's moment of triumph. However, Iversen could not believe that Harkaway had undergone such a radical transformation. Even on the basis of _mpoola_, one obviously had to die before passing on to the next existence and Harkaway had been continuously alive--from the neck down, at least.  Furthermore, all that aside, Iversen just couldn't see Harkaway going on to a higher plane. Although he supposed the young man was well-meaning enough--he'd grant him that negligible virtue--wouldn't it be terrible to have a system of existence in which one was advanced on the basis of intent rather than result? The higher life-forms would degenerate into primitivism.  But weren't the Flimbotzik virtually primitive? Or so Harkaway had said, for Iversen himself had not had enough contact with them to determine their degree of sophistication, and only the spaceships gave Harkaway's claim the lie.         *       *       *       *       *  Iversen condescended to take a look at the opening chapter of Harkaway's book, just to see what the whole thing was about. The book began:  \"What is the difference between life and death? Can we say definitely and definitively that life is life and death is death? Are we sure that death is not life and life is not death?  \"No, we are not sure!  \"Must the individuality have a corporeal essence in which to enshroud itself before it can proceed in its rapt, inexorable progress toward the Ultimate Non-actuality? And even if such be needful, why must the personal essence be trammeled by the same old worn-out habiliments of error?  \"Think upon this!  \"What is the extremest intensification of individuality? It is the All-encompassing Nothingness. Of what value are the fur, the feathers, the skin, the temporal trappings of imperfection in our perpetual struggle toward the final undefinable resolution into the Infinite Interplay of Cosmic Forces?  \"Less than nothing!\"  At this point, Iversen stopped reading and returned the manuscript to its creator, without a word. This last was less out of self-restraint than through sheer semantic inadequacy.  The young man might have spent his time more profitably in a little research on the biology or social organization of the Flimbotzik, Iversen thought bitterly when he had calmed down, thus saving the next expedition some work. But, instead, he'd been blinded by the flashy theological aspects of the culture and, as a result, the whole crew had gone metempsychotic.  This was going to be one of the _Herringbone's_ more unendurable voyages, Iversen knew. And he couldn't put his foot down effectively, either, because the crew, all being gentlemen of independent means now, were outrageously independent.  However, in spite of knowing that all of them fully deserved what they got, Iversen couldn't help feeling guilty as he ate steak while the other officers consumed fish, vegetables and eggs in an aura of unbearable virtue.  \"But if the soul transmigrates and not the body,\" he argued, \"what harm is there in consuming the vacated receptacle?\"  \"For all you know,\" the first officer said, averting his eyes from Iversen's plate with a little--wholly gratuitous, to the captain's mind--shudder, \"that cow might have housed the psyche of your grandmother.\"  \"Well, then, by indirectly participating in that animal's slaughter, I have released my grandmother from her physical bondage to advance to the"]]]
