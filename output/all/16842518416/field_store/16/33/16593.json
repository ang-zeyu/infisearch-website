Being as wet as they could be, they did not waste any time about crossing streams. The field officers spread out and rode squarely at the most promising crossings in sight. The men watched their progress, and took the best they found. If the water did not get above the middle of the sides of the Colonel's medium-sized horse, they took off their haversacks and unbuckled their cartridge-boxes, and plunged in after him, the shorter men pairing off with the taller men, and clinging to them.  So eager was their advance that by the time they halted at noon for a rest and a cup of coffee, they were miles ahead of the rest of the brigade, and beginning to look forward to catching glimpses of Shelbyville.  They had encountered no opposition except long-taw shots from rebel cavalry watching them from the opposite sides of the yellow floods, and who would scurry away as soon as they began to cross.  The young Aid again appeared upon the scene.  \"Colonel,\" he said, saluting, \"the General presents his compliments, and directs that you advance to that next creek, and halt there for the night and observe it.\"  \"What did that young man remark?\" said Shorty in an undertone; \"that we wuz to advance to that crick and observe it? What in the thunder have we bin doin' for the past four days but observe cricks, an' cross the nasty, wet things?\"  \"He means, Shorty,\" said Capt. McGillicuddy, \"that we are to go as near as we can to the bank, and watch, that the rebels do not come across, and wait there until the rest of the division get in supporting distance.\"  \"I guessed that was what his West Point lingo meant, if he has brains enough to mean anything. Why didn't he say in plain United States: 'Git down to the edge o' that there crick, watch for a chance to jump the rebels, and keep your eye peeled that the rebels don't jump you?' That'd be plain Methodist-Episcopal, that everybody could under stand.\".  \"I'll see that you are appointed Professor of Military Language and Orders at West Point when you are discharged,\" said the Captain, laughing.  The regiment advanced to the edge of the swollen flood and made themselves as comfortable as possible under shelters improvised from rails, cedar boughs, pieces of driftwood, etc. A considerable force of rebels appeared on the opposite bank, whose business seemed to be to \"observe\" the Yankees.  The restless Si and Shorty started out on a private reconnoissance. They discovered that the shore opposite the left of the regiment was really an island, separated by some hundreds of yards of rushing water from them, but the main current ran on the other side of the island.  \"We can't observe the crick through that mass o' willers and cottonwoods,\" said Shorty. \"That's certain. No tellin' what devilment the rebels are up to on the bank over there. They may be gittin' up a flank movement over there, with pontoons and flatboats, to bust the whole army wide open.\"  \"That's so,\" assented Si. \"The orders are to observe this crick, and we can't do it if we can't see the other bank. We ought to git over to that island.\"  They went back and reported to Capt. McGillicuddy, and told him what they thought. He at once agreed with them, and sanctioned their proposal to go over to the island, if they could find means of crossing.  After a diligent search they came across an old canoe hollowed out of a tulip-tree log. It was a cranky affair, and likely to turn over if their hair was not parted exactly in the middle; but both of the boys were used to canoe management, and they decided to risk the thing.  It was ticklish business crossing the current, but they succeeded in reaching the island, which extended a foot or more above the level of the flood, and was covered with a thicket of willows and cottonwoods about the size of hoe-handles. They pushed their way through these and came in sight of the opposite banks. There was apparently some thing important going on over there. Quite a number of rebels could be seen moving about through the rain and mud, there was great deal of chopping going on, several flatboats, canoes and rafts were lying at the bank, wagons were passing, and the boys thought they could make out a cannon or two.  \"I can't make out what in the world they're up to,\" said Si. \"But I'm certain the Colonel ought to know it. Suppose you take the canoe, Shorty, and paddle over and report, and I'll stay here and watch.\"  \"All right,\" answered Shorty, starting back for the canoe.  He reported to Capt. McGillicuddy, who took him up to the Colonel.  \"It don't seem possible that they can be doing anything to threaten us,\" said the Colonel; \"though they may know of some practicable crossing higher up the stream, which will let them in on our flank. Still, they ought to be watched. I'll inform the General at once. You had better station a picket on the island, Captain, if you can do so safely.\"  \"Me and my pardner 'll look out for them, Colonel, if you think necessary,\" said Shorty, proud to be of service under the Colonel's direction.  \"Very good,\" said the Colonel briefly. \"I'll entrust the lookout to you boys. Let me know at once if anything important develops.\"  The young Aid had been standing nigh during this conversation.  \"Your men, Colonel,\" he said patronizingly, \"are excellent soldiers, in their way, but they lack the intelligence necessary to comprehend the movements of the enemy on the opposite bank. I think I shall go over there myself, take a personal observation, and determine precisely what the meaning of the movements may be.\"  \"As you like,\" said the Colonel stiffly. \"As for myself, I don't think it is necessary for me to go. I'd trust those boys' eyes as quick as I would my own. They are as good soldiers as ever breathed; they are as keen as a brier, with not a particle of nonsense about them. They are as truthful as the day. When they tell me anything that they have seen with their own eyes I can trust it as absolutely as if I had seen it myself; and their judgment can not be beat.\"  \"No enlisted man can possibly see anything so well as an officer who has been educated,\" said the Aid.  \"That is a matter of opinion,\" said the Colonel dryly.  \"Anyway, I'm going over to see for myself,\" said the Aid. And he called after Shorty:  \"Here, my man, I'm going along with you.\"  Shorty muttered some very warm words under his breath, but discipline asserted itself, and he answered respectfully:  \"Very good, sir.\"  He halted until the Aid came alongside, and then started to walk beside him as he would have done with one of his own officers when out alone with him.  \"Fall two paces behind,\" commanded the Aid sternly  Shorty said to himself some very hotly-disparaging things about pretentious young snips of Regular officers. They reached the canoe, and the Lieutenant calmly seated himself in the stern. This was another aggravation. If Shorty had gone out with one of his own officers, even the Colonel, he would have shown a deep interest in everything and wanted to do his share toward getting the canoe safely over. This young fellow calmly seated himself, and threw all the responsibility and work on Shorty.  \"Now, you set right in the center, there,\" said Shorty, as he picked up the paddle and loosened the rope, \"and keep mighty still.\"  \"My man,\" said the Lieutenant, frowning, \"when I want your advice I'll ask it. It is for me to give you directions, not you me. You paddle out, now, and head straight for that island. Paddle briskly, and get me over there as quick as possible.\"  Shorty was tempted to tip the canoe over then and there, but he restrained himself, and bent his strong arms to the hard task of propelling the canoe across the strong current, avoiding the driftwood, maintaining his balance, and keeping the bow pointed toward the place where he wanted to land.  The Lieutenant had sense enough to sit very still, and as he naturally had been drilled into bolt-up-rightness, Shorty had little trouble with him until they were nearing the shore. Then the canoe ran into a swirl which threw its bow around. Forgetting his dignified pose, the Lieutenant made a grab for some overhanging willows.  \"Let them alone, blast you; I'll bring her around all right,\" Shorty started to yell, but too late. Before the words were out of his mouth the cranky canoe went over. Shorty with the quickness of a cat jumped clear, caught some branches with one hand, and made a grab for the canoe with the other. But he saw the Lieutenant go down head foremost, with fancy boots disappearing last. He let the canoe go, to make a grab for the boots. He missed them, but presently the Lieutenant's head appeared, and he gasped and sputtered:  \"Save me, my good man. I can't swim a stroke.\"  Shorty plunged out, succeeded in catching the Lieutenant by the collar, and after a vicious struggle with the current, grabbed with his right hand a pole that Si thrust out to him, while with his left he dragged the Lieutenant ashore, \"wetter'n a blamed drowned West Point muskrat,\" as he after ward expressed it.  \"My good man, you saved my life, and I thank you for it,\" said the Lieutenant when he recovered his breath. \"I shall mention you in my report.\"  \"If you don't stop calling me your 'good man' I'll chuck you into the drink again, you wasp-waisted, stiff-backed, half-baked West Point brevet Second Lieutenant,\" said Shorty wrathfully. \"If you'd had the sense of a six-months'-old goslin' you'd 'a' set still, as I told you, and let me manage that canoe. But you never kin learn a West Pointer nothin'. He'd try to give God Almighty points if he got a chance. Now we've lost our canoe, and we're in a devil of a fix. I feel like throwin' you back in the crick.\"  \"Take care, my good\" and then the Lieutenant caught the glare of Shorty's eye. \"Take care, sir. You're on the verge of mutiny. I may have you court-martialed and shot, if you're not careful.\"  \"Court-martial and be blamed,\" said Si, who was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31774"],["title","Si Klegg, Book 4 (#6)"],["body"," angry as Shorty. \"You've lost our canoe, and we may be drowned before we can git off this island. It's got so dark they can't see us from the shore, the water's steadily rising, these trees are too small to climb, and the Lord knows how we're goin' to git off.\"  \"Corporal, I'll see that you're reduced to the ranks for disrespect to me. I had intended to recommend this man for promotion on account of his great service to the army in saving my life. Now I shall see that you are both punished for insubordination.\"  \"Insubordination be damned, and you with it,\" said Shorty. \"You'd better be thinking how we're to git off this island. The water's bin raisin' about a foot a minute. I've bin watchin' while we wuz talkin'.\"  The Lieutenant stood, dazed, while the boys were canvassing plans for saving themselves.  \"I'll tell you, Shorty,\" said Si suddenly. \"Le's ketch one o' them big saw-logs that's comin' down, straddle it, and let it carry us somewhere. It may take us into our own lines. Anything's better than drowndin'. Here comes one in the eddy now.\"  Shorty caught the log with a long pole, and dexterously steered it up close to the shore in comparatively still water. Si threw a grapevine over it and held it.  \"Now, all git on,\" said Shorty. \"Be careful not to push it away.\"  \"Let me get on ahead,\" said the Lieutenant, still mindful of his rank, \"and you two get on behind, the Corporal next to me.\"  \"Not much, Mary Ann,\" jeered Shorty. \"We want a man of sense ahead, to steer. I'll git on first, then you, and then Si, to bring up the rear and manage the hind end of the log.\"  The Lieutenant had to comply. They all got safely on, and Shorty pushed off, saying:  \"Here, sit straight, both of you. Here goes mebbe for New Orleans, mebbe for Libby Prison, mebbe for the camp of the 200th Ind.  \"We're out on the ocean sailin'.\"  [Illustration: HERE GOES, MEBBE TO LIBBEY PRISON. 55]    CHAPTER V. AFLOAT ON A LOG  SI, SHORTY AND THE WEST-POINTER HAVE AN EVENTFUL JOURNEY.  THE log swept out into the yellow swirl, bobbing up and down in the turbulent current.  \"Bobs like a buckin' broncho,\" said Shorty. \"Make you seasick, Si?\"  \"Not yet,\" answered his partner. \"I ain't so much afraid o' that as I am that some big alligator-gar 'll come along and take his dinner off my leg.\"  \"Bah,\" said Shorty, contemptuously; \"no alligator-gar is goin' to come up into this mud-freshet. He'd ruther hunt dogs and nigger-babies further down the river. Likes 'em better. He ain't goin' to gnaw at them old Wabash sycamore legs o' yourn when he kin git a bite at them fat shoats we saw sailin' down stream awhile ago.\"  \"The belief in alligator-gar is a vulgar and absurd superstition,\" said the Lieutenant, breaking silence for the first time. \"There, isn't anywhere in fresh water a fish capable of eating anything bigger than a bull-frog.\"  \"Hullo; did West Point learn you that?\" said Shorty. \"You know just about as much about it as you do about gittin' over cricks an' paddlin' a canoe. Have you ever bin interduced to a Mississippi catfish? Have you ever seen an alligator-gar at home in the Lower Mississippi? Naw! You don't know no more about them than a baby does about a catamount. I have heard tell of an alligator-gar that was longer'n a fence-rail, and sort of king of a little bayou down in the Teche country. He got mad because they run a little stern-wheel steamboat up into his alley to git their cotton off, an' he made up his mind to stop it. He'd circle 'round the boat to git a good headway and pick out his man. Then he'd take a run-and-jump, leap clean across the boat, knock off the man he'd picked out, an' tow him off under a log an' eat him. He intended to take the Captain fust, but his appetite got the better of him. He saw a big, fat, juicy buck nigger of a deck-hand, an' couldn't stand the temptation. He fetched him easy. Next he took a nice, tender little cabin-boy. Then he fetched the big old Mate, but found him so full o' terbacker, whisky and bad language that he couldn't eat him nohow, an' turned him over to the mudturtles, what'll eat anything. The Captain then got scared an' quit. He didn't care a hat for the Mate, for he was glad to git rid of him; but he liked the cabin-boy an' he had to pay the owner o' the nigger $1,200 for him, an' that made runnin' up the Teche onprofitable.\"  \"Oh, Shorty,\" Si gasped. He thought he was acquainted with his partner's brilliant talents for romance, but this was a meteoric flight that he had not expected.  \"But that wasn't nothin',\" Shorty continued, \"to a he catfish that a man told me about down near Helena, Ark. He used to swim around in a little chute near a house-cabin in which lived a man with a mighty good-lookin' young wife. The man was awful jealous of his woman, an' used to beat her. The ole he catfish had a fine eye for purty women, and used to cavort around near the cabin whenever his business would permit. The woman noticed him, and it tickled him greatly. She'd throw him hunks o' bread, chunks o' cold meat, and so on. The man'd come out and slap her, and fling clubs and knots at him. One day the man put his wife in a basswood canoe, and started to take her across the river. He hadn't got a rod from the shore when the old he catfish ups and bites the canoe in two, then nips the man's hand so's he didn't git over it for months, and then puts his nose under the woman's arm, and helps her ashore as polite as you please.\"  \"Shorty,\" gasped Si, \"if you tell any more such stories as that this log'll certainly sink. See it how it wobbles now.\"  \"I consider such stuff very discourteous to your officer,\" said the Lieutenant stiffly. \"I shall make a note of it for consideration at some future time.\"  \"Halt! Who goes thar?\" rang out sharply from the bank.  \"Hush; don't breathe,\" said Shorty. They were in an eddy, which was sweeping them close to the rebel bank.  \"Who air yo' haltin'?\" said a second voice.  \"I see some men in a canoe out thar. I heared their voices fust,\" said the first voice.  \"Whar' yo see any men in a canoe?\" asked the second incredulously.  \"Right over thar. You kin see 'em. They're comin' right this-a-way. I'm a gwine t' halt 'em agin an' then shoot.\"  \"Stuff,\" said the other. \"You're allers seein' shadders an' ghostses. That 'er's only an ole tree with three limbs stickin' up. Don't yo' shoot an' skeer the whole camp. They'll have the grand laugh on yo', an' mebbe buck-an'-gag yo'.\"  \"'Tain't stuff,\" persisted the other. \"Thar never wuz a tree that ever growed that had three as big limbs as that all on one side. You're moon blind.\"  \"A man mout well be rain blind in sich a storm as this, but I tell yo' that's nothin' but an ole sycamore drift log. If yo' shoot the boys'll never git tired o' damnin' yo', an' jest as likely as not the ossifers'll make yo' tote a rail through the mud termorrer.\"  The boys were so near that every word could be distinctly heard, and they were floating nearer every moment.  The suspense was thrilling. If the man fired at that distance he could not help hitting one of them and discovering the others. They scarcely breathed, and certainly did not move a muscle, as the log floated steadily in-shore in the comparatively stiller waters of the eddy. The rain was coming down persistently yet, but with a sullen quietness, so that the silence was not broken by the splashing of the drops.  A water-moccasin deadliest of snakes crawled up onto the log and coiled himself in front of Si, with that indifference to companionship which seems to possess all animals in flood-times. Si shuddered as he saw it, but did not dare make a motion against it.  The dialog on the bank continued.  \"Thar, you kin see thar air men in a canoe,\" said the first voice.  \"I can't see nothin' o' the kind,\" replied the other.  \"If hit ain't a log with three dead limbs, hit's a piece o' barn-timber with the j'ists a-stickin' up.\"  \"I don't believe hit nary mite. Hit's men, an' I'm a-gwine t' shoot.\"  \"No, yo' hain't gwine t' make a durned fool o' yourself. Wait a minute. Hit's a-comin' nigher, an' soon you kin hit it with a rock. I'll jest do hit t' show yo how skeery yo' air. Le'me look around an' find a good rock t' throw. If I kin find jest the right kind I kin hit a yallerhammer at that distance.\"  This prospect was hardly more reassuring than that of being fired at, but there was nothing to do but to take whatever might come. To make it more aggravating, the current had slowed down, until the motion of their log was very languid. They were about 100 feet from the shore when they heard the second voice say:  \"Heah, I've got jest the right kind o' a dornick. Now jest keep yer eye peeled an' fixed on that center limb, an' yo'll hear it chunk when I plunk hit an' show hit's nothin' but a stick o' wood.\"  Si thought he saw the Lieutenant crouch a little, but was not sure.  The stone came whistling through the air, struck the top of the Lieutenant's cap and knocked it off into the water.  \"Thar,\" said the second voice triumphantly; \"yo' see hit ain't no men. Jest as I done tole yo'. I knocked the bark offen the end o' one o' the sticks.\"  The log moved slowly on, and presently catching in a stronger current, swept out into the stream again. It seemed so like deliverance, that Si made a quick blow and knocked the snake off into the water, and Shorty could not help shouting triumphantly:  \"Good-by, Johnnies! Sorry we can't stay with you longer. Got other engagements down the crick. Ta-ta! See you later.\"  The chagrined sentry fired an angry shot, but they were already behind a clump of willows.  \"Lootenant,\" said Shorty, \"you put on a whole lot of unnecessary frills, but you've got good stuff in you after all. You went through that little affair like a man. I'll back you after this.\"  \"When I desire your opinion, sir, as to my conduct,\" replied the Lieutenant, \"I shall ask you for it. Until then keep it to yourself. It is for me to speak of your conduct, not you of mine.\"  But again they \"h"]]]
