That's my brave boy.\" And they were on the lantern deck again, fairly rocking in the gale,--and Laura was chopping away on her stiff wicks, and pumping up her oil again, and filling the receivers, as if she had ever done it till this Christmas before. And she kept saying over to herself,--  \"Then those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.\"  \"And I will light them,\" said she aloud. \"That will save another walk at sundown. And I know these carcels run at least five hours.\" So she struck a match, and with some little difficulty coaxed the fibres to take fire. The yellow light flared luridly on the white snow-flakes, and yet it dazzled her and Tommy as it flashed on them from the reflectors. \"Will anybody see it, mamma?\" said the child. \"Will papa see it?\" And just then the witching devil who manages the fibres of memory, drew from the little crypt in Laura's brain, where they had been stored unnoticed years upon years, four lines of Leigh Hunt's, and the child saw that she was Hero:--      \"Then at the flame a torch of fire she lit,     And, o'er her head anxiously holding it,     Ascended to the roof, and, leaning there,     Lifted its light into the darksome air.\"  If only the devil would have been satisfied with this. But of course she could not remember that, without remembering Schiller:--      \"In the gale her torch is blasted,       Beacon of the hoped-for strand:     Horror broods above the waters,       Horror broods above the land.\"  And she said aloud to the boy, \"Our torch shall not go out, Tommy,--come down, come down, darling, with mamma.\" But all through the day horrid lines from the same poem came back to her. Why did she ever learn it! Why, but because dear Tom gave her the book himself; and this was his own version, as he sent it to her from the camp in the valley,--      \"Yes, 'tis he! although he perished,     Still his sacred troth he cherished.\"  \"Why did Tom write it for me?\"      \"And they trickle, lightly playing     O'er a corpse upon the sand.\"  \"What a fool I am! Come, Tommy. Come, Matty, my darling. Mamma will tell you a story. Once there was a little boy, and he had two kittens. And he named one Buff and one Muff\"-- But this could not last for ever. Sundown came. And then Laura and Tommy climbed their own tower,--and she lighted her own lantern, as she called it. Sickly and sad through the storm, she could see the sister lantern burning bravely. And that was all she could see in the sullen whiteness. \"Now, Tommy, my darling, we will come and have some supper.\" \"And while the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.\" \"Yes, 'tis he; although he perished, still his sacred troth he cherished.\" \"Come, Tommy,--come Tommy,--come, Tommy, let me tell you a story.\"  But the children had their supper,--asking terrible questions about papa,--questions which who should answer? But she could busy herself about giving them their oatmeal, and treating them to ginger-snaps, because it was Christmas Eve. Nay, she kept her courage, when Tommy asked if Santa Claus would come in the boat with papa. She fairly loitered over the undressing them. Little witches, how pretty they were in their flannel nightgowns! And Tommy kissed her, and gave her--ah me!--one more kiss for papa. And in two minutes they were asleep. It would have been better if they could have kept awake one minute longer. Now she was really alone. And very soon seven o'clock has come. She does not dare leave the clock-work at the outer lantern a minute longer. Tom and Mipples wind the works every four hours, and now they have run five. One more look at her darlings. Shall she ever see them again in this world? Now to the duty next her hand!  Yes, the wind is as fierce as ever! A point more to the north, Laura notices. She has no child to carry now. She tumbles once in the drift. But Laura has rolled in snow before. The pile at the door is three feet thick. But she works down to the latch,--and even her poor numb hand conquers it,--and it gives way. How nice and warm the tower is! and how well the lights burn! Can they be of any use this night to anybody? O my God, grant that they be of use to him!  She has wound them now. She has floundered into the snow again. Two or three falls on her way home,--but no danger that she loses the line of march. The light above her own house is before her. So she has only to aim at that. Home again! And now to wait for five hours,--and then to wind that light again--at midnight!  \"And at midnight there was a cry made\"--\"oh dear!--if he would come,--I would not ask for any cry!\"--         *       *       *       *       *  And Laura got down her choice inlaid box, that Jem brought her from sea,--and which held her treasures of treasures. And the dear girl did the best thing she could have done. She took these treasures out.--You know what they were, do not you? They were every letter Tom Cutts ever wrote her--from the first boy note in print,--\"Laura,--these hedgehog quills are for you. I killed him. TOM.\" And Laura opened them all,--and read them one by one, each twice,--and put them back, in their order, without folding, into the box. At ten she stopped,--and worked her way upstairs into her own lantern,--and wound its works again. She tried to persuade herself that there was less wind,--did persuade herself so. But the snow was as steady as ever. Down the tower-stairs again,--and then a few blessed minutes brooding over Matty's crib, and dear little Tom who has kicked himself right athwart her own bed where she had laid him. Darlings! they are so lovely, their father must come home to see them! Back then to her kitchen fire. There are more of dear Tom's letters yet. How manly they are,--and how womanly. She will read them all!--will she ever dare to read them all again?  Yes,--she reads them all,--each one twice over,--and his soldier diary,--which John Wildair saved and sent home, and, as she lays it down, the clock strikes twelve. Christmas day is born!--  \"And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh.\" Laura fairly repeated this aloud. She knew that the other carcel must be wound again. She dressed herself for the fight thoroughly. She ran in and trusted herself to kiss the children. She opened the lee-door again, and crept round again into the storm,--familiar now with such adventure. Did the surf beat as fiercely on the rocks? Surely not. But then the tide is now so low! So she came to her other tower, crept up and wound her clock-work up again, wiped off, or tried to wipe off, what she thought was mist gathering on the glasses, groped down the stairway, and looked up on the steady light above her own home. And the Christmas text came back to her. \"The star went before them, and stood above the place where the young child was.\"  \"A light to lighten the Gentiles,--and the glory of my people Israel!\"  \"By the way of the sea,\"--and this Laura almost shouted aloud,--\"Galilee of the Gentiles, the people who sat in darkness saw a great light, and to them who sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.\" \"Grant it, merciful Father,--grant it for these poor children!\" And she almost ran through the heavy drifts, till she found the shelter again of her friendly tower. Her darlings had not turned in their bed, since she left them there.  And after this Laura was at rest. She took down her Bible, and read the Christmas chapters. It was as if she had never known before what darkness was,--or what the Light was, when it came. She took her Hymn Book and read all the Christmas Hymns. She took her Keble,--and read every poem for Advent and the hymn for Christmas morning. She knew this by heart long ago. Then she took Bishop Ken's \"Christian Year,\"--which Tom had given for her last birthday present,--and set herself bravely to committing his \"Christmas Day\" to memory:--        \"Celestial harps, prepare       To sound your loftiest air;     You choral angels at the throne,     Your customary hymns postpone;\"  and thus, dear girl, she kept herself from thinking even of the wretched Hero and Leander lines, till her clock struck three. Upstairs then to her own tower, and to look out upon the night. The sister flame was steady. The wind was all hushed. But the snow was as steady, right and left, behind and before. Down again, one more look at the darlings, and then, as she walked up and down her little kitchen, she repeated the verses she had learned, and then sat down to--      \"You with your heavenly ray     Gild the expanse this day;      \"You with your heavenly ray     Gild--the expanse--this day;      \"You--with--your--heavenly--ray\"--  Dear Laura, bless God, she is asleep. \"He giveth his beloved sleep.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Her head is thrown back on the projecting wing of grandmamma's tall easy-chair, her arms are resting relaxed on its comfortable arms, her lips just open with a smile, as she dreams of something in the kingdom of God's heaven, when, as the lazy day just begins to grow gray, Tom, white with snow to his middle, holding the boat's lantern before him as he steals into her kitchen, crosses the room, and looks down on her,--what a shame to wake her,--bends down and kisses her!  Dear child! How she started,--\"At midnight there is a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh,\"--\"Why, Tom! Oh! my dearest, is it you?\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Have I been asleep on duty?\" This was her first word when she came fairly to herself.  \"Guess not,\" said old Mipples, \"both lanterns was burning when I come in. 'Most time to put 'em out, Major! 'Keepers must be diligent to save oil by all reasonable prevision.'\"  \"Is the north light burning?\" said poor Laura. And she looked guiltily at her tell-tale clock.  \"Darling,\" said Tom, reverently, \"if it were not burning, we should not be here.\"  And Laura took her husband to see the babies, not willing to let his hand leave hers, nor he, indeed, to let hers leave his."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32455"],["title","Christmas Eve and Christmas Day: Ten Christmas stories (#6)"],["body"," Old Mipples thought himself one too many, and went away, wiping his eyes, to the other light. \"Time to extinguish it,\" he said.  But before Tom and Laura had known he was gone, say in half an hour, that is, he was back again, hailing them from below.  \"Major! Major! Major! An English steamer is at anchor in the cove, and is sending her boat ashore.\"  Tom and Laura rushed to the window; the snow was all over now, and they could see the monster lying within half a mile. \"Where would they be, Miss Cutts, if somebody had not wound up the lamps at midnight? Guess they said 'Merry Christmas' when they see 'em.\" And Laura held her breath when she thought what might have been. Tom and Mipples ran down to the beach to hail them, and direct the landing. Tom and Mipples shook the hand of each man as he came ashore, and then Laura could see them hurrying to the house together. Steps on the landing; steps on the stairway,--the door is open, and,--not Tom this time,--but her dear lost brother Jem, in the flesh, and in a heavy pea-coat.  \"Merry Christmas! Laura!\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Laura,\" said Jem, as they sat at their Christmas dinner, \"what do you think I thought of first, when I heard the cable run out so like blazes; when I rushed up and saw your yellow lanterns there?\"  \"How should I know, Jem?\"  \"'They that dwell in the shadow of death, upon them the light hath shined.'\"  \"But I did not think it was you, Laura.\"     CHRISTMAS WAITS IN BOSTON.   I.  I always give myself a Christmas present. And on this particular year the present was a Carol party,--which is about as good fun, all things consenting kindly, as a man can have.  Many things must consent, as will appear. First of all there must be good sleighing,--and second, a fine night for Christmas eve. Ours are not the carollings of your poor shivering little East Angles or South Mercians, where they have to plod round afoot in countries where they do not know what a sleigh-ride is.  I had asked Harry to have sixteen of the best voices in the chapel school to be trained to eight or ten good Carols without knowing why. We did not care to disappoint them if a February thaw setting in on the 24th of December should break up the spree before it began. Then I had told Howland that he must reserve for me a span of good horses, and a sleigh that I could pack sixteen small children into, tight-stowed. Howland is always good about such things, knew what the sleigh was for, having done the same in other years, and doubled the span of horses of his own accord, because the children would like it better, and \"it would be no difference to him.\" Sunday night as the weather nymphs ordered, the wind hauled round to the northwest and everything froze hard. Monday night, things moderated and the snow began to fall steadily,--so steadily;--and so Tuesday night the Metropolitan people gave up their unequal contest, all good men and angels rejoicing at their discomfiture, and only a few of the people in the very lowest _Bolgie_, being ill-natured enough to grieve. And thus it was, that by Thursday evening was one hard compact roadway from Copp's Hill to the Bone-burner's Gehenna, fit for good men and angels to ride over, without jar, without noise and without fatigue to horse or man. So it was that when I came down with Lycidas to the chapel at seven o'clock, I found Harry had gathered there his eight pretty girls and his eight jolly boys, and had them practising for the last time,      \"Carol, carol, Christians,     Carol joyfully;     Carol for the coming     Of Christ's nativity.\"  I think the children had got inkling of what was coming, or perhaps Harry had hinted it to their mothers. Certainly they were warmly dressed, and when, fifteen minutes afterwards, Howland came round himself with the sleigh, he had put in as many rugs and bear-skins as if he thought the children were to be taken new born from their respective cradles. Great was the rejoicing as the bells of the horses rang beneath the chapel windows, and Harry did not get his last _da capo_ for his last carol. Not much matter indeed, for they were perfect enough in it before midnight.  Lycidas and I tumbled in on the back seat, each with a child in his lap to keep us warm; I was flanked by Sam Perry, and he by John Rich, both of the mercurial age, and therefore good to do errands. Harry was in front somewhere flanked in likewise, and the twelve other children lay in miscellaneously between, like sardines when you have first opened the box. I had invited Lycidas, because, besides being my best friend, he is the best fellow in the world, and so deserves the best Christmas eve can give him. Under the full moon, on the snow still white, with sixteen children at the happiest, and with the blessed memories of the best the world has ever had, there can be nothing better than two or three such hours.  \"First, driver, out on Commonwealth Avenue. That will tone down the horses. Stop on the left after you have passed Fairfield Street.\" So we dashed up to the front of Haliburton's palace, where he was keeping his first Christmas tide. And the children, whom Harry had hushed down for a square or two, broke forth with good full voice under his strong lead in      \"Shepherd of tender sheep,\"  singing with all that unconscious pathos with which children do sing, and starting the tears in your eyes in the midst of your gladness. The instant the horses' bells stopped, their voices began. In an instant more we saw Haliburton and Anna run to the window and pull up the shades, and, in a minute more, faces at all the windows. And so the children sung through Clement's old hymn. Little did Clement think of bells and snow, as he taught it in his Sunday school there in Alexandria. But perhaps to-day, as they pin up the laurels and the palm in the chapel at Alexandria, they are humming the words, not thinking of Clement more than he thought of us. As the children closed with      \"Swell the triumphant song     To Christ, our King,\"  Haliburton came running out, and begged me to bring them in. But I told him, \"No,\" as soon as I could hush their shouts of \"Merry Christmas;\" that we had a long journey before us, and must not alight by the way. And the children broke out with      \"Hail to the night,     Hail to the day,\"  rather a favorite,--quicker and more to the childish taste perhaps than the other,--and with another \"Merry Christmas\" we were off again.  Off, the length of Commonwealth Avenue, to where it crosses the Brookline branch of the Mill-Dam,--dashing along with the gayest of the sleighing-parties as we came back into town, up Chestnut Street, through Louisburg Square,--we ran the sleigh into a bank on the slope of Pinckney Street in front of Walter's house,--and, before they suspected there that any one had come, the children were singing      \"Carol, carol, Christians,     Carol joyfully.\"  Kisses flung from the window; kisses flung back from the street. \"Merry Christmas\" again with a good-will, and then one of the girls began      \"When Anna took the baby,     And pressed his lips to hers\"--  and all of them fell in so cheerily. O dear me! it is a scrap of old Ephrem the Syrian, if they did but know it! And when, after this, Harry would fain have driven on, because two carols at one house was the rule, how the little witches begged that they might sing just one song more there, because Mrs. Alexander had been so kind to them, when she showed them about the German stitches. And then up the hill and over to the North End, and as far as we could get the horses up into Moon Court, that they might sing to the Italian image-man who gave Lucy the boy and dog in plaster, when she was sick in the spring. For the children had, you know, the choice of where they would go; and they select their best friends, and will be more apt to remember the Italian image-man than Chrysostom himself, though Chrysostom should have \"made a few remarks\" to them seventeen times in the chapel. Then the Italian image-man heard for the first time in his life      \"Now is the time of Christmas come,\"  and      \"Jesus in his babes abiding.\"  And then we came up Hanover Street and stopped under Mr. Gerry's chapel, where they were dressing the walls with their evergreens, and gave them      \"Hail to the night,     Hail to the day\";  and so down State Street and stopped at the Advertiser office, because, when the boys gave their \"Literary Entertainment,\" Mr. Hale put in their advertisement for nothing, and up in the old attic there the compositors were relieved to hear      \"Nor war nor battle sound,\"  and      \"The waiting world was still.\"  Even the leading editor relaxed from his gravity, and the \"In General\" man from his more serious views, and the Daily the next morning wished everybody a merry Christmas with even more unction, and resolved that in coming years it would have a supplement, large enough to contain all the good wishes. So away again to the houses of confectioners who had given the children candy,--to Miss Simonds's house, because she had been so good to them in school,--to the palaces of millionnaires who had prayed for these children with tears if the children only knew it,--to Dr. Frothingham's in Summer Street, I remember, where we stopped because the Boston Association of Ministers met there,--and out on Dover Street Bridge, that the poor chair-mender might hear our carols sung once more before he heard them better sung in another world where nothing needs mending.      \"King of glory, king of peace!\"     \"Hear the song, and see the Star!\"     \"Welcome be thou, heavenly King!\"     \"Was not Christ our Saviour?\"  and all the others, rung out with order or without order, breaking the hush directly as the horses' bells were stilled, thrown into the air with all the gladness of childhood, selected sometimes as Harry happened to think best for the hearers, but more often as the jubilant and uncontrolled enthusiasm of the children"]]]
