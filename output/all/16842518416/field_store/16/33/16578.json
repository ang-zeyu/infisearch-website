In the 22 hot Summers that he had lived through he had never found himself very far from a well or spring when his thirst cried out to be slacked, and he did not suppose that it was much farther between wells down South.  \"I don't see the use of carrying two or three pints o' water along all day right past springs and over cricks,\" he remarked to his chum, as the two were examining the queer, cloth-covered cans.  \"We've got to take 'em, any way,\" answered his chum, resignedly, \"It's regulations.\"  On his entry into service a boy accepted everything without question when assured that it was \"regulations.\" He would have charged bayonets on a buzz-saw if authoritatively informed that it was required by the mysterious \"regulations.\"  The long march the 200th Ind. made after Bragg over the dusty turnpikes the first week in October, 1862, taught Si the value of a canteen. After that it was rarely allowed to get empty.  \"What are these grooves along each side for?\" he asked, pointing out the little hollows which give the \"prod\" lightness and strength.  \"Why,\" answered the Orderly, who, having been in the three-months' service, assumed to know more about war than the Duke of Wellington, \"the intention of those is to make a wound the lips of which will close up when the bayonet is pulled out, so that the man'll be certain to die.\"  Naturally so diabolical an intention sent cold shivers down Si's back.  The night before Si left for \"the front\" he had taken his musket and couterments home to show them to his mother and sisters--and the other fellow's sister, whose picture and lock of hair he had safely stowed away. They looked upon the bayonet with a dreadful awe. Tears came into Maria's eyes as she thought of Si roaming about through the South like a bandit plunging that cruel steel into people's bowels.  \"This is the way it's done,\" said Si, as he charged about the room in an imaginary duel with a rebel, winding up with a terrifying lunge. \"Die, Tur-r-rraitor, gaul durn ye,\" he exclaimed, for he was really getting excited over the matter, while the girls screamed and jumped upon the chairs, and his good mother almost fainted.  The attention that the 200th Ind. had to give to the bayonet drill confirmed Si's deep respect for the weapon, and he practiced assiduously all the \"lunges,\" \"parries,\" and \"guards\" in the Manual, in the hope that proficiency so gained would save his own dearly-beloved hide from puncture, and enable him to punch any luckless rebel that he might encounter as full of holes as a fishing net.  [Illustration: WHAT THE BAYONET WAS GOOD FOR 033 ]  The 200th Ind.'s first fight was at Perryville, but though it routed the rebel force in front of it, it would have taken a bayonet half-a-mile long to touch the nearest \"Johnny.\" Si thought it odd that the rebels didn't let him get close enough to them to try his new bayonet, and pitch a dozen or two of them over into the next field.  If the truth must be told, the first blood that stained Si's bayonet was not that of a fellow-man.  Si Klegg's company was on picket one day, while Gen. Buell was trying to make up his mind what to do with Bragg. Rations had been a little short for a week or so. In fact, they had been scarcely sufficient to meet the demands of Si's appetite, and his haversack had nothing in it to speak of. Strict orders against foraging had been, issued. It was the day of \"guarding rebel onion patches.\" Si couldn't quite get it straight in his head why the General should be so mighty particular about a few pigs and chickens and sweet potatoes, for he was really getting hungry, and when a man is in this condition he is not in a fit mood to grapple with fine-spun theories of governmental policy.  So when a fat pig came wabbling and grunting toward his post, it was to Si like a vision of manna to the children of Israel in the wilderness. A wild, uncontrollable desire to taste a fresh spare-rib took possession of him. Naturally, his first idea was to send a bullet through the animal, but on second thought he saw that wouldn't do at all. It would \"give him away\" at once, and, besides, he had found that a single shot on the picket-line would keep Buell's entire army in line-of-battle for a whole day.  Si wrote to his mother that his bright new bayonet was stained with Southern blood, and the old lady shuddered at the awful thought. \"But,\" added Si, \"it was only a pig, and not a man, that I killed!\"  \"I'm so glad!\" she exclaimed.  [Illustration: AS MARIA PICTURED SI USING HIS BAYONET 034 ]  By the time Si had been in the service a year there was less zeal in the enforcement of orders of this kind, and Si had become a very skillful and successful forager. He had still been unable to reach with his bayonet the body of a single one of his misguided fellow citizens, but he had stabbed a great many pigs and sheep. In fact, Si found his bayonet a most useful auxiliary in his predatory operations. He could not well have gotten along without it.  Uncle Sam generally furnished Si with plenty of coffee--roasted and unground--but did not supply him with a coffee mill. Si thought at first that the Government had forgotten something. He saw that several of the old veterans of '61 had coffee mills, but he found on inquiry that they had been obtained by confiscation only. He determined to supply himself at the first opportunity, but in the meantime he was obliged to 'use his bayonet as a substitute, just as all the rest of the soldiers did.  We regret to say that Si, having thrown away his \"Baxter's Call to the Unconverted\" in his first march, and having allowed himself to forget the lessons he had learned but a few years before in Sunday-school, soon learned to play poker and other sinful games. These, at night, developed another use for the bayonet. In its capacity as a \"handy\" candlestick it was \"equaled by few and excelled by none.\" The \"shank\" was always ready to receive the candle, while the point could be thrust into the ground in an instant, and nothing more was necessary. This was perhaps the most general sphere of usefulness found by the bayonet during the war. Barrels of candle-grease flowed down the furrowed sides of this weapon for every drop of human blood that dimmed its luster.    CHAPTER IV. THE AWFUL HARDTACK  THE HARD AND SOLID STAFF OF MILITARY LIFE.  \"APPETITE'S a queer thing,\" said Si to Shorty one day, when both were in a philosophical mood. \"It's an awful bother when you haven't it, and it's a great deal worse when you have it, and can't get anything for it.\" \"Same as money,\" returned sage Shorty. During the first few months of Si Klegg's service in the army the one thing that bothered him more than anything else was his appetite. It was a very robust, healthy one that Si had, for he had grown up on his father's farm in Indiana, and had never known what it was to be hungry without abundant means at hand for appeasing his desires in that direction. His mother's cupboard was never known to be in the condition of Old Mother Hubbard's, described in the nursery rhyme. The Kleggs might not have much tapestry and bric-a-brac in their home, but their smoke-house was always full, and Mrs. Klegg's kitchen could have fed a camp-meeting any time without warning. So it was that when Si enlisted his full, rosy face and his roundness of limb showed that he had been well fed, and that nature had made good use of the ample daily supplies that were provided. His digestive organs were kept in perfect condition by constant exercise.  After Si had put down his name on the roll of Co. Q of the 200th Ind. he had but a few days to remain at home before his regiment was to start for Louisville. During this time his mother and sisters kept him filled up with \"goodies\" of every sort. In fact, it was the biggest thing in the way of a protracted picnic that Si had ever struck.  \"You must enjoy these things while you can, Si,\" said his mother, \"for goodness knows what you'll do when you really git into the army. I've heerd 'em tell awful things about how the poor sogers don't have half enough to eat, and what they do git goes agin' any Christian stomach. Here, take another piece of this pie. A little while, and it'll be a long time, I reckon, till ye git any more.\"  \"Don't keer if I do!\" said Si, for there was scarcely any limit to his capacity.  And so during those days and nights the old lady and the girls cooked and cooked, and Si ate and ate, until it seemed as if he wouldn't want any more till the war was over.  Si was full, and as soon as Co. Q was, it was ordered to camp, and Si had to go. They loaded him down with good things enough to last him a week. The pretty Annabel--the neighbor's daughter who had solemnly promised Si that she wouldn't go with any other fellow while he was away--came around to see Si off and brought him a rich fruit cake.  \"I made that for you,\" she said.  \"Bully for you!\" said Si, for he felt that he must begin to talk like a soldier.  The first day or two after reaching Louisville the 200th received rations of \"soft bread.\" But that didn't last long. It was only a way they had of letting the fresh soldier down easy. Orders came to get ready to pull out after Bragg, and then Si'a regiment had its first issue of army rations. As the Orderly pried open a box of hardtack and began to distribute them to the boys, exclaimed:  \"Them's nice-looking soda crackers. I don't believe the grub is going to be so bad, after all.\"  Si had never seen a hardtack before.  \"Better taste one and see how you like it!\" said one of Buell's ragged Indiana veterans, who had come over to see the boys of the 200th and hear the latest news from \"God's country.\"  It happened that this lot was one of extra quality as to hardness. The baker's watch had stopped, or he had gone to sleep, and they had been left in the oven or dry-kiln too long. Si took one of them and carried it to his mouth. He first tried on it the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31771"],["title","Si Klegg, Book 1 (#3)"],["body","which made such havoc with a quarter section of custard pie, but his incisors made no more impression upon it than if it had been a shingle.  \"You have to bear on hard,\" said the veteran, with a grim smile.  \"Je-ru-sa-lem!\" exclaimed Si after he had made two or three attempts equally barren of results.  Then he tried his \"back teeth.\" His molars were in prime order, and his jaw power was sufficient to crack a hickory nut every time. Si crowded one corner of the hardtack as far as he could between his \"grinders,\" where he could get a good \"purchase\" on it, shut his eyes and turned on a full head of steam. His teeth and jaws fairly cracked under the strain, but he couldn't even \"phase\" it.  \"If that ain't old pizen!\" said Si. \"It beats anything I ever seen up in the Wabash country.\"  But his blood was up, and laying the cracker upon a log, he brought the butt of his gun down upon it like a pile-driver.  [Illustration: HE TRIES THE BUTT OF HIS GUN ON IT 041 ]  \"I thought I'd fix ye,\" he said, as he picked up the fragments, and tried his teeth upon the smaller ones. \"Have I got to eat such stuff as that?\" with a despairing look at his veteran friend. \"I'd just as soon be a billy-goat and live on circus-posters, fruit-cans and old hoop-skirts.\"  \"You'll get used to it after a while, same's we did. You'll see the time when you'll be mighty glad to get even as hard a tack as that!\"  Si's heart sank almost into his shoes at the prospect, for the taste of his mother's pie and Annabel's fruit cake were yet fresh in his mouth. But Si was fully bent on being a loyal, obedient soldier, determined to make the best of everything without any more \"kicking\" than was the inalienable right of every man who wore a uniform.  For the first time in his life Si went to bed hungry that night. Impelled by the gnawings of his appetite he made repeated assaults upon the hardtack, but the result was wholly insufficient to satisfy the longings of his stomach. His supper wasn't anything to speak of. Before going to bed he began to exercise his ingenuity on various schemes to reduce the hardtack to a condition in which it would be more gratifying to his taste and better suited to the means with which nature had provided him for disposing of his rations. Naturally Si thought that soaking in water would have a beneficial effect. So he laid five or six of them in the bottom of a camp-kettle, anchored them down with a stone, and covered them with water. He thought that with the aid of a frying-pan he would get up a breakfast that he could eat, anyway.  Si felt a little blue as he lay curled up under his blanket with his head pillowed on his knapsack. He thought some about his mother, and sister Maria, and pretty Annabel, but he thought a good deal more about the beef and potatoes, the pies and the puddings, that were so plentifully spread upon the table at home.  It was a long time before he got to sleep. As he lay there, thinking and thinking, there came to his mind some ether uses to which it seemed to him the hardtack might be put, which would be much more consistent with its nature than to palm it off on the soldiers as alleged food. He thought he could now understand why, when he enlisted, they examined his teeth so carefully, as if they were going to buy him for a mule. They said it was necessary to have good teeth in order to bite \"cartridges\" successfully, but now he knew it was with reference to his ability to eat hardtack.  Si didn't want to be killed if he could help it.  While he was lying there he determined to line one of his shirts with hardtacks, and he would put that on whenever there was going to be a fight. He didn't believe the bullets would go through them. He wanted to do all he could toward paralyzing the rebels, and with such a protection he could be very brave, while his comrades were being mowed down around him. The idea of having such' a shirt struck Si as being a brilliant one.  Then, he thought hardtack would be excellent for half-soling his shoes. He didn't think they would ever wear out.  If he ran short of ammunition he could ram pieces of hardtack into his gun and he had no doubt they would do terrible execution in the ranks of the enemy.  All these things and many more Si thought of until finally he was lost in sleep. Then he dreamed that somebody was trying to cram stones down his throat.  The company was called out at daylight, and immediately after roll-call Si went to look after the hardtacks he had put to soak the night before. He thought he had never felt so hungry in his life. He fished out the hardtack and carefully inspected them, to note the result of the submerging and to figure out the chances on his much-needed breakfast.  To any old soldier it would be unnecessary to describe the condition in which Si found those hardtacks, and the effect of the soaking. For the information of any who never soaked a hardtack it may be said that Si found them transformed, to all appearances, into sole-leather. They were flexible, but as tough as the hide that was \"found in the vat when the tanner died.\"  Si tried to bite a piece off one of them to see what it was like, but he couldn't get his teeth through it. In sheer desperation he laid it on a log, seized a hatchet, and chopped off a corner. He put it in his mouth and chewed on it a while, but found it as tasteless as cold codfish.  Si thought he would try the frying-pan. He chopped the hardtacks into bits, put in equal parts of water and grease, sifted over the mixture a little salt and pepper, and then gave it a thorough frying. Si's spirits rose during the gradual development of this scheme, as it seemed to offer a good prospect for his morning meal. And when it came to the eating. Si found it really good, comparatively speaking, even though it was very much like a dish compounded of the sweepings from around a shoemaker's bench. A good appetite was indispensable to a real enjoyment of this--which the soldiers called by a name that cannot be given here--but Si had the appetite, and he ate and was thankful.  \"I thought I'd get the bulge on them things some way or other,\" said Si, as he drank the last of his coffee and arose from his meal, feeling like a giant refreshed with new wine.  For the next two or three months Si largely devoted his surplus energies to further experimenting with the hardtack. He applied every conceivable process of cookery he could think of that was possible with the meager outfit at his command in the way of utensils and materials. Nearly all of his patient and persevering efforts resulted only in vexation of spirit.  He continued to eat hardtack from day to day, in these various forms, but it was only because he had to do it. He didn't hanker after it, but it was a military necessity--hardtack or starvation. It was a hard choice, but Si's love of life--and Annabel--induced him to choose the hardtack.  [Illustration: THE BEST WAY AFTER ALL 045 ]  But for a long-time Si's stomach was in a state of chronic rebellion, and on the whole he had a hard time of it getting used to this staple article of army diet. He did not become reconciled to it until after his regiment had rations of flour for a week, when the \"cracker-line\" had been cut by the guerillas and the supply of that substantial edible was exhausted. Si's experience with the flour swept away all his objections to the hardtack. Those slapjacks, so fearfully and wonderfully made, and those lumps of dough, mixed with cold water and dried on flat stones before the fire, as hard as cannon balls, played sad havoc with his internal arrangements. For the first time he was obliged to fall into the cadaverous squad at sick-call and wabble up to the doctor's shop, where he was dosed with castor-oil and blue-mass. Si was glad enough to see hardtack again. Most of the grumbling he did thereafter concerning the hardtack was because he often couldn't get enough.  About six months taught Si what all the soldiers learned by experience, that the best way to eat the average hardtack was to take it \"straight\"--just as it came out of the box, without any soaking or frying or stewing. At meal-time he would make a quart or so of coffee, stab the end of a ramrod through three or four slices of sowbelly, and cook them over the coals, allowing some of the drippings to fall upon the hardtack for lubricating purposes, and these constituted his frugal repast.    CHAPTER V. FAT PORK--INDISPENSABLE BODY TIMBER FOR PATRIOTISM.  IT WAS told in the last chapter how the patriotic impulses of Si Klegg, of the 200th Ind., reached his stomach and digestive apparatus, and brought them under obedient subjection to hardtack. He didn't have quite so rough an experience with that other staple of army diet, which was in fact the very counterpart of the hardtack, and which took its most popular name from that part of the body of the female swine which is usually nearest the ground. Much of Si's muscle and brawn was due to the fact that meat was always plenty on his father's farm. When Si enlisted he was not entirely free from anxiety on the question of meat, for to his appetite it was not even second in importance to bread. If bread was the \"staff of life\" meat was life itself to Si. It didn't make much difference to him what kind it was, only so it was meat. He didn't suppose Uncle Sam would keep him supplied with quail on toast and porterhouse steaks all the time, but he did hope he would give him as much as he wanted of something in that line.  \"You won't get much pork, unless you're a good forager,\" said one of Si's friends he met at Louisville, and who had been a year in the service.  Si thought he might, with practice and a little encouragement, be fairly successful in foraging on his' own hook, but at the same time he said he wouldn't grumble if he could only get plenty of pork. Fortunately for him he had not been imbued with the teachings of the Hebraic dispensation which declared \"unclean\" the beast that"]]]
