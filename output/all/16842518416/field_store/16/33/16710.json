Darrig fought the whole thing out in his mind, and when he couldn't fight any longer, he--retreated. I'm afraid he's hopelessly insane.\"  \"Let's see him.\"  They walked down the corridor to Malley's laboratory. Darrig was relaxed on a couch, his eyes glazed and staring.  \"Is there any way of curing him?\" Cercy asked.  \"Shock therapy, maybe.\" Malley was dubious. \"It'll take a long time. And he'll probably block out everything that had to do with producing this.\"  Cercy turned away, feeling sick. Even if Darrig could be cured, it would be too late. The aliens must have picked up the Ambassador's message by now and were undoubtedly heading for Earth.  \"What's this?\" Cercy asked, picking up a piece of paper that lay by Darrig's hand.  \"Oh, he was doodling,\" Malley said. \"Is there anything written on it?\"  Cercy read aloud: \"'Upon further consideration I can see that Chaos and the Gorgon Medusa are closely related.'\"  \"What does that mean?\" Malley asked.  \"I don't know,\" Cercy puzzled. \"He was always interested in folklore.\"  \"Sounds schizophrenic,\" the psychiatrist said.  Cercy read it again. \"'Upon further consideration, I can see that Chaos and the Gorgon Medusa are closely related.'\" He stared at it. \"Isn't it possible,\" he asked Malley, \"that he was trying to give us a clue? Trying to trick himself into giving and not giving at the same time?\"  \"It's possible,\" Malley agreed. \"An unsuccessful compromise--But what could it mean?\"  \"Chaos.\" Cercy remembered Darrig's mentioning that word in his telephone call. \"That was the original state of the Universe in Greek myth, wasn't it? The formlessness out of which everything came?\"  \"Something like that,\" Malley said. \"And Medusa was one of those three sisters with the horrible faces.\"  Cercy stood for a moment, staring at the paper. Chaos ... Medusa ... and the organizing principle! Of course!  \"I think--\" He turned and ran from the room. Malley looked at him; then loaded a hypodermic and followed.         *       *       *       *       *  In the control room, Cercy shouted Harrison into consciousness.  \"Listen,\" he said, \"I want you to build something, quick. Do you hear me?\"  \"Sure.\" Harrison blinked and sat up. \"What's the rush?\"  \"I know what Darrig wanted to tell us,\" Cercy said. \"Come on, I'll tell you what I want. And Malley, put down that hypodermic. I haven't cracked. I want you to get me a book on Greek mythology. And hurry it up.\"  Finding a Greek mythology isn't an easy task at two o'clock in the morning. With the aid of FBI men, Malley routed a book dealer out of bed. He got his book and hurried back.  Cercy was red-eyed and excited, and Harrison and his helpers were working away at three crazy looking rigs. Cercy snatched the book from Malley, looked up one item, and put it down.  \"Great work,\" he said. \"We're all set now. Finished, Harrison?\"  \"Just about.\" Harrison and ten helpers were screwing in the last parts. \"Will you tell me what this is?\"  \"Me too,\" Malley put in.  \"I don't mean to be secretive,\" Cercy said. \"I'm just in a hurry. I'll explain as we go along.\" He stood up. \"Okay, let's wake up the Ambassador.\"         *       *       *       *       *  They watched the screen as a bolt of electricity leaped from the ceiling to the Ambassador's bed. Immediately, the Ambassador vanished.  \"Now he's a part of that stream of electrons, right?\" Cercy asked.  \"That's what he told us,\" Malley said.  \"But still keeping his pattern, within the stream,\" Cercy continued. \"He has to, in order to get back into his own shape. Now we start the first disrupter.\"  Harrison hooked the machine into circuit, and sent his helpers away.  \"Here's a running graph of the electron stream,\" Cercy said. \"See the difference?\" On the graph there was an irregular series of peaks and valleys, constantly shifting and leveling. \"Do you remember when you hypnotized the Ambassador? He talked about his friend who'd been killed in space.\"  \"That's right,\" Malley nodded. \"His friend had been killed by something that had just popped up.\"  \"He said something else,\" Cercy went on. \"He told us that the basic organizing force of the Universe usually stopped things like that. What does that mean to you?\"  \"The organizing force,\" Malley repeated slowly. \"Didn't Darrig say that that was a new natural law?\"  \"He did. But think of the implications, as Darrig did. If an organizing principle is engaged in some work, there must be something that opposes it. That which opposes organization is--\"  \"Chaos!\"  \"That's what Darrig thought, and what we should have seen. The chaos is underlying, and out of it there arose an organizing principle. This principle, if I've got it right, sought to suppress the fundamental chaos, to make all things regular.  \"But the chaos still boils out in spots, as Alfern found out. Perhaps the organizational pattern is weaker in space. Anyhow, those spots are dangerous, until the organizing principle gets to work on them.\"  [Illustration]  [Illustration]         *       *       *       *       *  He turned to the panel. \"Okay, Harrison. Throw in the second disrupter.\" The peaks and valleys altered on the graph. They started to mount in crazy, meaningless configurations.  \"Take Darrig's message in the light of that. Chaos, we know, is underlying. Everything was formed out of it. The Gorgon Medusa was something that _couldn't be looked upon_. She turned men into stone, you recall, destroyed them. So, Darrig found a relationship between chaos and that which can't be looked upon. All with regard to the Ambassador, of course.\"  \"The Ambassador can't look upon chaos!\" Malley cried.  \"That's it. The Ambassador is capable of an infinite number of alterations and permutations. But _something_--the matrix--can't change, because then there would be nothing left. To destroy something as abstract as a pattern, we need a state in which no pattern is possible. A state of chaos.\"  The third disrupter was thrown into circuit. The graph looked as if a drunken caterpillar had been sketching on it.  \"Those disrupters are Harrison's idea,\" Cercy said. \"I told him I wanted an electrical current with absolutely no coherent pattern. The disrupters are an extension of radio jamming. The first alters the electrical pattern. That's its purpose: to produce a state of patternlessness. The second tries to destroy the pattern left by the first; the third tries to destroy the pattern made by the first two. They're fed back then, and any remaining pattern is systematically destroyed in circuit ... I hope.\"  \"This is supposed to produce a state of chaos?\" Malley asked, looking into the screen.  For a while there was only the whining of the machines and the crazy doodling of the graph. Then, in the middle of the Ambassador's room, a spot appeared. It wavered, shrunk, expanded--  What happened was indescribable. All they knew was that everything within the spot had disappeared.  \"Switch it off\" Cercy shouted. Harrison cut the switch.  The spot continued to grow.  \"How is it we're able to look at it?\" Malley asked, staring at the screen.  \"The shield of Perseus, remember?\" Cercy said. \"Using it as a mirror, he could look at Medusa.\"  \"It's still growing!\" Malley shouted.  \"There was a calculated risk in all this,\" Cercy said. \"There's always the possibility that the chaos may go on, unchecked. If that happens, it won't matter much what--\"  The spot stopped growing. Its edges wavered and rippled, and then it started to shrink.  \"The organizing principle,\" Cercy said, and collapsed into a chair.  \"Any sign of the Ambassador?\" he asked, in a few minutes.  The spot was still wavering. Then it was gone. Instantly there was an explosion. The steel walls buckled inward, but held. The screen went dead.  \"The spot removed all the air from the room,\" Cercy explained, \"as well as the furniture and the Ambassador.\"  \"He couldn't take it,\" Malley said. \"No pattern can cohere, in a state of patternlessness. He's gone to join Alfern.\"  Malley started to giggle. Cercy felt like joining him, but pulled himself together.  \"Take it easy,\" he said. \"We're not through yet.\"  \"Sure we are! The Ambassador--\"  \"Is out of the way. But there's still an alien fleet homing in on this region of space. A fleet so strong we couldn't scratch it with an H-bomb. They'll be looking for us.\"  He stood up.  \"Go home and get some sleep. Something tells me that tomorrow we're going to have to start figuring out some way of camouflaging a planet.\"                                                       --ROBERT SHECKLEY         *       *       *       *       *"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32041"],["title","One Man's Poison (#0)"],["body","Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from Galaxy Science Fiction December 1953.

He held it up for Casker to admire, then laid it carefully on the workbench beside the razor.  \"Hell of a meal for two grown men,\" Casker said, flopping down in one of the ship's padded crash chairs.  \"If you'd like to give up your share--\" Hellman started to suggest.  Casker shook his head quickly. Hellman smiled, picked up the razor and examined its edge critically.  \"Don't make a production out of it,\" Casker said, glancing at the ship's instruments. They were approaching a red dwarf, the only planet-bearing sun in the vicinity. \"We want to be through with supper before we get much closer.\"  Hellman made a practice incision in the radish, squinting along the top of the razor. Casker bent closer, his mouth open. Hellman poised the razor delicately and cut the radish cleanly in half.  \"Will you say grace?\" Hellman asked.  Casker growled something and popped a half in his mouth. Hellman chewed more slowly. The sharp taste seemed to explode along his disused tastebuds.  \"Not much bulk value,\" Hellman said.  Casker didn't answer. He was busily studying the red dwarf.         *       *       *       *       *  As he swallowed the last of his radish, Hellman stifled a sigh. Their last meal had been three days ago ... if two biscuits and a cup of water could be called a meal. This radish, now resting in the vast emptiness of their stomachs, was the last gram of food on board ship.  \"Two planets,\" Casker said. \"One's burned to a crisp.\"  \"Then we'll land on the other.\"  Casker nodded and punched a deceleration spiral into the ship's tape.  Hellman found himself wondering for the hundredth time where the fault had been. Could he have made out the food requisitions wrong, when they took on supplies at Calao station? After all, he had been devoting most of his attention to the mining equipment. Or had the ground crew just forgotten to load those last precious cases?  He drew his belt in to the fourth new notch he had punched.  Speculation was useless. Whatever the reason, they were in a jam. Ironically enough, they had more than enough fuel to take them back to Calao. But they would be a pair of singularly emaciated corpses by the time the ship reached there.  \"We're coming in now,\" Casker said.  And to make matters worse, this unexplored region of space had few suns and fewer planets. Perhaps there was a slight possibility of replenishing their water supply, but the odds were enormous against finding anything they could eat.  \"Look at that place,\" Casker growled.  Hellman shook himself out of his reverie.  The planet was like a round gray-brown porcupine. The spines of a million needle-sharp mountains glittered in the red dwarf's feeble light. And as they spiraled lower, circling the planet, the pointed mountains seemed to stretch out to meet them.  \"It can't be _all_ mountains,\" Hellman said.  \"It's not.\"  Sure enough, there were oceans and lakes, out of which thrust jagged island-mountains. But no sign of level land, no hint of civilization, or even animal life.  \"At least it's got an oxygen atmosphere,\" Casker said.  Their deceleration spiral swept them around the planet, cutting lower into the atmosphere, braking against it. And still there was nothing but mountains and lakes and oceans and more mountains.  On the eighth run, Hellman caught sight of a solitary building on a mountain top. Casker braked recklessly, and the hull glowed red hot. On the eleventh run, they made a landing approach.  \"Stupid place to build,\" Casker muttered.  The building was doughnut-shaped, and fitted nicely over the top of the mountain. There was a wide, level lip around it, which Casker scorched as he landed the ship.         *       *       *       *       *  From the air, the building had merely seemed big. On the ground, it was enormous. Hellman and Casker walked up to it slowly. Hellman had his burner ready, but there was no sign of life.  \"This planet must be abandoned,\" Hellman said almost in a whisper.  \"Anyone in his right mind would abandon this place,\" Casker said. \"There're enough good planets around, without anyone trying to live on a needle point.\"  They reached the door. Hellman tried to open it and found it locked. He looked back at the spectacular display of mountains.  \"You know,\" he said, \"when this planet was still in a molten state, it must have been affected by several gigantic moons that are now broken up. The strains, external and internal, wrenched it into its present spined appearance and--\"  \"Come off it,\" Casker said ungraciously. \"You were a librarian before you decided to get rich on uranium.\"  Hellman shrugged his shoulders and burned a hole in the doorlock. They waited.  The only sound on the mountain top was the growling of their stomachs.  They entered.  The tremendous wedge-shaped room was evidently a warehouse of sorts. Goods were piled to the ceiling, scattered over the floor, stacked haphazardly against the walls. There were boxes and containers of all sizes and shapes, some big enough to hold an elephant, others the size of thimbles.  Near the door was a dusty pile of books. Immediately, Hellman bent down to examine them.  \"Must be food somewhere in here,\" Casker said, his face lighting up for the first time in a week. He started to open the nearest box.  [Illustration]  \"This is interesting,\" Hellman said, discarding all the books except one.  \"Let's eat first,\" Casker said, ripping the top off the box. Inside was a brownish dust. Casker looked at it, sniffed, and made a face.  \"Very interesting indeed,\" Hellman said, leafing through the book.  Casker opened a small can, which contained a glittering green slime. He closed it and opened another. It contained a dull orange slime.  \"Hmm,\" Hellman said, still reading.  \"Hellman! Will you kindly drop that book and help me find some food?\"  \"Food?\" Hellman repeated, looking up. \"What makes you think there's anything to eat here? For all you know, this could be a paint factory.\"  \"It's a warehouse!\" Casker shouted.  He opened a kidney-shaped can and lifted out a soft purple stick. It hardened quickly and crumpled to dust as he tried to smell it. He scooped up a handful of the dust and brought it to his mouth.  \"That might be extract of strychnine,\" Hellman said casually.         *       *       *       *       *  Casker abruptly dropped the dust and wiped his hands.  \"After all,\" Hellman pointed out, \"granted that this is a warehouse--a cache, if you wish--we don't know what the late inhabitants considered good fare. Paris green salad, perhaps, with sulphuric acid as dressing.\"  \"All right,\" Casker said, \"but we gotta eat. What're you going to do about all this?\" He gestured at the hundreds of boxes, cans and bottles.  \"The thing to do,\" Hellman said briskly, \"is to make a qualitative analysis on four or five samples. We could start out with a simple titration, sublimate the chief ingredient, see if it forms a precipitate, work out its molecular makeup from--\"  \"Hellman, you don't know what you're talking about. You're a librarian, remember? And I'm a correspondence school pilot. We don't know anything about titrations and sublimations.\"  \"I know,\" Hellman said, \"but we should. It's the right way to go about it.\"  \"Sure. In the meantime, though, just until a chemist drops in, what'll we do?\"  \"This might help us,\" Hellman said, holding up the book. \"Do you know what it is?\"  \"No,\" Casker said, keeping a tight grip on his patience.  \"It's a pocket dictionary and guide to the Helg language.\"  \"Helg?\"  \"The planet we're on. The symbols match up with those on the boxes.\"  Casker raised an eyebrow. \"Never heard of Helg.\"  \"I don't believe the planet has ever had any contact with Earth,\" Hellman said. \"This dictionary isn't Helg-English. It's Helg-Aloombrigian.\"  Casker remembered that Aloombrigia was the home planet of a small, adventurous reptilian race, out near the center of the Galaxy.  \"How come you can read Aloombrigian?\" Casker asked.  \"Oh, being a librarian isn't a completely useless profession,\" Hellman said modestly. \"In my spare time--\"  \"Yeah. Now how about--\"  \"Do you know,\" Hellman said, \"the Aloombrigians probably helped the Helgans leave their planet and find another. They sell services like that. In which case, this building very likely is a food cache!\"  \"Suppose you start translating,\" Casker suggested wearily, \"and maybe find us something to eat.\"  They opened boxes until they found a likely-looking substance. Laboriously, Hellman translated the symbols on it.  \"Got it,\" he said. \"It reads:--'USE SNIFFNERS--THE BETTER ABRASIVE.'\"  \"Doesn't sound edible,\" Casker said.  \"I'm afraid not.\"  They found another, which read: VIGROOM! FILL ALL YOUR STOMACHS, AND FILL THEM RIGHT!  \"What kind of animals do you suppose these Helgans were?\" Casker asked.  Hellman shrugged his shoulders.  The next label took almost fifteen minutes to translate. It read: ARGOSEL MAKES YOUR THUDRA ALL TIZZY. CONTAINS THIRTY ARPS OF RAMSTAT PULZ, FOR SHELL LUBRICATION.  \"There must be _something_ here we can eat,\" Casker said with a note of desperation.  \"I hope so,\" Hellman replied.         *       *       *       *       *  At the end of two hours, they were no closer. They had translated dozens of titles and sniffed so many substances that their olfactory senses had given up in disgust.  \"Let's talk this over,\" Hellman said, sitting on a box marked: VORMITISH--GOOD AS IT SOUNDS!  \"Sure,\" Casker said, sprawling out "]]]
