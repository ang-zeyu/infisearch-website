Take the breasts of two cooked partridges, about six ounces, and cut into very small pieces. Mince two ounces of lean ham, one truffle, and six mushrooms; stir this mixture into a gill of white sauce. Butter nine small moulds, line them neatly with this mixture, smooth well over with a hot wet knife, fill in with minced partridge, coat them neatly over the top with the quenelle meat, steam them for twenty minutes; dish on a circle of mashed potato, pour good white sauce over and round them, and serve French beans or tomatoes in the centre.   Partridge à la Vénitienne.  Put a brace of partridges into a stewpan with butter, two glasses of Chablis, and two glasses of stock, add a bouquet garni, very little garlic, two cloves, salt and pepper; let them simmer gently. Take them off when done, pass the gravy through a sieve, add a little butter and flour to thicken it, a small piece of glaze, a little cayenne and salt. Pour the sauce over the partridges, and cover over all with two spoonfuls of grated Parmesan cheese; put a few breadcrumbs and pieces of clarified butter on this, and set the whole on a baking sheet in the oven. Brown the birds well, and serve with sauce espagnole or sauce piquante.   Pintail.  This bird should be roasted at a clear quick fire, well floured when first laid down, turned briskly, and basted with butter _constantly_. It takes about twenty-five minutes to roast, and then it should be laid down before the fire for two or three more, when it will yield a very rich gravy. Score the breast, and sprinkle a little cayenne on it, and send cut lemon up to table to hand with it.   Boiled Pheasant.  Cover with buttered paper and simmer as gently as possible till it is done enough. Pour either celery, horseradish, oyster, or soubise sauce over it, and serve more in a tureen.   Boudins of Pheasant à la Richelieu.  Take a cold pheasant and pick the meat from it; remove the skin and sinews, and pound the flesh in a mortar to a smooth paste. Mix its weight with the same quantity of pounded potatoes or panada and six ounces of fresh butter. Mix these thoroughly, pound them together, and season highly with salt and cayenne, and a trifle of mace. Bind together with the yolks of four eggs, one at a time, two tablespoonfuls of white sauce, and last of all two tablespoonfuls of boiled onions chopped small. Spread this mixture out on a dish, and make it up into small cutlets about three inches long, two inches wide, and a quarter of an inch thick. Drop these carefully into very hot water, and poach them gently for a few minutes. The water must not boil. Take them up, drain, and let them get cold; then egg and breadcrumb them, and fry them in hot butter a nice pale colour. Make a gravy by peeling and frying four onions in butter till lightly browned, dredge an ounce of flour over them, and pour upon them half a pint of stock, a glassful of claret, the bones of the pheasant, and pepper and salt. Simmer over fire for twenty minutes, strain through sieve, and it is ready for use. Serve the boudins in a circle with the gravy round.   Pheasant à la Bonne Femme.  Put a well-hung pheasant in a buttered stewpan with three ounces of good beef dripping and six ounces of ham cut into dice. Let the pheasant fry over fire till it is nicely and lightly browned, then add a tablespoonful of chutnee and three large Spanish onions cut in rings; cover the saucepan, and let it simmer till all are cooked. Take up the bird and put it on a dish, beat the onions over the fire for ten minutes, season with pepper and salt, and serve round the pheasant.   Pheasant à la Brillat-Savarin.  Hang a pheasant till tender, pluck, draw, and lard it carefully. Bone and draw two woodcocks, keep the trail separate, throw away the gizzards, chop up the meat with beef marrow which has been cooked by steam, scraped bacon, pepper, salt, mixed herbs and truffles; fill the pheasant with this stuffing, which fix in with a piece of bread the shape of a cork and tie it round with fine thread. Lay a thick slice of bread two inches broader than the pheasant in the dripping pan; pound the tail of the woodcock in a mortar with truffles, add anchovy, a little scraped bacon, and a lump of fresh butter; spread a thick layer on the bread, roast the pheasant over it so as to catch all the dripping and dish up on it.   Crème of Pheasants à la Moderne.  Take two pheasants, remove the skin from the breast, and cut from each the two large fillets and the two under ones; remove every particle of the white flesh that did not come away with the fillets, leaving the legs and pinions on the carcases.  Spread each fillet on a board and with a knife scrape the flesh from the skin of the fillet. When the flesh is removed from the four large fillets and from the four smaller ones, and little remnants gathered from the carcases, place them in a mortar and pour in a gill of cream and pound well for a few minutes, then rub through clean wire sieve, place it back in the mortar and keep adding, a gill at a time, more cream until one pint of cream is used up; now take two plain cylinder moulds, well buttered and ornamented according to fancy with truffles (or small dariole moulds may be used), fill carefully and place a piece of buttered paper on the top of the mould or moulds, and place them in a stewpan with about a pint of boiling water and let them simmer very gently for twenty minutes and turn out. Make a sauce to serve with this dish of the carcases, &c., mixed with rich Béchamel sauce, and when dished there should be a garnish of peas, mushrooms, or shred truffles.   Pheasant Cutlets.  Take a well-hung young pheasant, cut it when prepared into neat joints. Take out the bones carefully and shape the joints into cutlets; flatten these with the cutlet-bat, season rather highly and cover them thickly with egg and finely-grated breadcrumbs. Put the bones and trimmings into a saucepan with a carrot, a turnip, an onion, a handful of parsley, a bouquet garni, a bayleaf, pepper, salt, and as much water as will cover them. Let them stew slowly till the flavour of the herbs is drawn out, then thicken gravy and strain. Fry the cutlets in hot fat till a bright brown. Serve on a hot dish in a circle with one of the small bones stuck into each cutlet; pour the gravy round.   Galantine of Pheasant à la Mode.  Bone a pheasant, cut off the legs and press what is left of the leg inside, and cut away any sinews. Take three-quarters of a pound of sausage meat, a dozen oysters, three or four truffles, a slice of tongue, and three rashers of fat bacon. Cut the truffles into _small_ dice, also the tongue and bacon. Mix all together with the sausage meat, adding a little cayenne pepper, half a teaspoonful of herbs mixed, half an ounce of melted gelatine, and two yolks of eggs. Mix well together, and spread over the pheasant evenly. Then roll it up lengthways and tightly in a cloth and place it in saucepan to boil for an hour, then take it out and remove the cloth carefully. To serve this dish, cut it up into thin slices and dish them in a circle, letting one piece overlap the other uniformly all round. Place a little cress salad compressed into a ball on the top, and at the base a few croûtons of aspic jelly at an equal distance apart, and a little chopped aspic between. Sprinkle a little over the salad ball at the top.   Fritôt of Crème of Pheasant.  Take eight tartlet tins, not too large, butter them, and fill about three parts full of crème of pheasant and place them in the oven for a few minutes. When quite firm to the touch, remove them from oven, and when cold dip each one into a light batter and fry in clean lard of a light brown. The batter should be made with half a pound of Vienna flour, the half of a yolk of egg, a dessertspoonful of salad oil, and a gill of pale ale. Mix all these together lightly till it will mask the point of one's finger; if too thick, add a drop or two more ale. Serve with brown or mushroom sauce. Send this dish very hot to table.   Partridge à la Crème.  See Pheasant ditto.   Fritôt of Partridge à la Crème.  See Pheasant ditto.   Pheasant and Macaroni.  Pull the flesh with two forks from a cold roast pheasant. Put the bones and trimmings into a saucepan with enough water to cover them, and let them simmer till it is much reduced. Add two shalots, a little salt and pepper, a grate of nutmeg, a gill of mushroom ketchup and the same of Marsala. Thicken with flour and butter, and let all simmer gently for twenty minutes; strain it, and put it back into the saucepan for it to boil up. Just before the pheasant is to be served, put the meat into the gravy and let it warm through without boiling. After it is dished, place round it some macaroni made as follows:--Have two pints of boiling water, into which plunge four ounces of macaroni, add pepper and salt, and simmer gently for twenty minutes. Drain it, and put it into a pint of good stock, with a little salt, a teaspoonful of unmixed mustard and a dust of cayenne. Let it all boil till the macaroni is tender, then add a tablespoonful of Parmesan cheese and an ounce of butter. Toss it over fire till all is well mixed, then serve.   Pheasant Pie with Oysters.  Boil a pheasant till almost done; it will finish cooking in the pie. Make as much gravy as the size of the bird will require, add half a cup of milk, season and thicken it. Make a good pie-crust, and then put the pieces of pheasant in a pie-dish, which must be hot. Scatter some raw oysters among the pieces of pheasant, pour over all enough gravy to fill the dish to the depth of one inch, and cover it with the crust, which must be pressed against the edge so that it will adhere. Let it bake for half an hour. After it is cooked, pour in remainder of the gravy in the slit in the top of the crust.   Pheasant des Rois.  Have a pound of the best preserved truffles, such as can be obtained at Benoist's, in Wardour Street, stew them in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31982"],["title","Dressed Game and Poultry à la Mode (#7)"],["body"," mixture of a quarter of a pound of butter, a large tablespoonful of finest Lucca oil, and half a pound of bacon fat scraped into shreds. Thoroughly cook the truffles, so that a silver fork can be stuck into them without pushing hard. Stuff a pheasant with them and sew it up. Cover the breast with a slice of fat bacon, and put two or three slices beneath it. Place round the pheasant pieces of veal and ham cut into small cubes the size of dice, add a few carrots, an onion or two, salt and pepper. Pour on it a claretglassful of Chablis, cover the saucepan, place it on a slow fire and use the salamander, then let it stew for an hour. When ready to serve, strain the same, removing all grease, and pour over the bird.   Pheasant à la Sainte Alliance.  An expensive dish.  Take a well-hung cock pheasant and truss it for roasting. Farce it with a stuffing made of two woodcocks' flesh and internals (or snipes') finely minced with two ounces of fresh butter, some salt, pepper, and a pinch of cayenne, a bouquet garni finely powdered, and as many chopped truffles as will be required to fill the pheasant. Truss the bird and roast, basting it well with fresh butter. Whilst roasting, lay in the pan a round of toast, upon which a little of the stuffing has been spread, and serve the bird on it. Bread sauce and brown gravy should be handed round with it.   Salmi of Pheasant.  Half roast a pheasant, and when it is nearly cold cut it into neat joints, removing the skin. Put the bones and trimmings into a saucepan with an ounce of fresh butter, a bayleaf, and a bouquet garni, and stir these over a slow fire till lightly brown, then pour over half a pint of Espagnole sauce and a glassful of claret. Let all simmer for a quarter of an hour. Strain the gravy, skim it carefully, add a pinch of cayenne and the juice of half a lemon, then put it back into the saucepan with the pieces of game. Heat these up slowly. When cooked, dish up and pour the hot sauce over them and garnish with fried sippets. A little orange juice and a lump of sugar is an improvement to the sauce.   Pheasant Stewed with Cabbage.  Truss a pheasant for boiling. Divide a large cabbage into quarters, soak them after cutting off the stalks, plunge them into boiling water and boil for about ten minutes. Take them out, drain them and press all the water from them, then put them into the stewpan. Lay the pheasant well in the cabbage, add six ounces of good bacon, half a pound of Bologna sausage, three pork sausages, some parsley, a bayleaf, a bouquet garni, one carrot, an onion stuck with four cloves, a shalot, and some pepper. Pour in as much stock as will cover the whole, and cover the pan closely and bring to a boil and let it simmer slowly for an hour. Then take out the bird and the meat and keep them warm whilst the cabbage is drained, peppered, and salted, and steamed over fire till dry. Then place it on a dish, arrange the pheasant on it and all the other adjuncts round it. Serve poivrade sauce in a tureen.   Pheasant Stuffed with Oysters.  Truss a pheasant for roasting and fill it with forcemeat made of two dozen oysters pounded in the mortar, with a tablespoonful of brown breadcrumbs, half an ounce of fresh butter, a dessertspoonful of lemon juice, a boned anchovy, and a little cayenne. Mix these ingredients thoroughly and bind them with the yolk of an egg. Cover the bird with thin slices of fat bacon tied on securely, and roast before a clear fire. When done, dish up with clear gravy, and hand bread sauce in a tureen with it.   Pheasant Stuffed with Tomatoes.  Truss a pheasant for roasting, and fill it with a forcemeat made of six tomatoes pounded in the mortar, with a tablespoonful of breadcrumbs, a shalot, a mushroom, half a clove of garlic, a teaspoonful of parsley, and half an ounce of butter, pepper and salt to taste. Bind together with the yolk of an egg. Cover the bird with slices of bacon and roast before a clear fire. Mushroom or tomato sauce may be served in a tureen with it. Partridge and grouse are also very delicious stuffed in this way.   Pheasant en Surprise.  Take a pheasant, remove the skin from the breast and take away all the meat, removing any gristle there may be, and place it in a mortar. Have ready half a pint of good cream, and begin by pouring half the quantity over the pheasant and pound together for a few minutes, then rub it through a clean wire sieve. When passed, put it back into the mortar, add the remainder of the cream gradually into the fowl, stirring it round so that they blend together perfectly. Fill a mould with this mixture and twist a bit of buttered paper round the top; then fold a sheet of paper several times and place it in a stewpan, put about half a pint of boiling water into the stewpan, or more according to size of it, and let all simmer gently for twenty minutes. Add a little salt and a dust of cayenne pepper. Turn this out and mix with it half a pint of white aspic jelly. Have ready some very clear aspic jelly, and colour it red. Take a pretty shaped jelly mould, pour in a little of the red aspic to about rather more than a quarter of the mould. When this is cool, put in the pheasant and aspic mixture, and place on ice for four hours; when properly frozen, turn out, and garnish the top with a wreath of fresh chervil leaves. Serve chopped aspic in little mounds round the base alternately with mounds of mayonnaise salad or tomatoes.   Pheasant à la Suisse.  Take the remains of a cold pheasant, cut it into neat joints. Salt and pepper these highly, and strew over it finely chopped onion and parsley. Cover them with oil, and squeeze over them the juice of a lemon. Turn the pieces every now and then, and let them remain till they have imbibed the flavour, then dip the pieces in a batter made of four ounces of flour, with as much milk added as will make a thick batter. Stir into it half a wineglassful of brandy and an egg, the white and yolk beaten to a froth. This batter should rest for an hour in a warm place before using. Fry the pieces of chicken in the batter, and send it up piled on a dish garnished with fried parsley.   Pheasant à la Tregothran.  Bone a pheasant and stuff it with the meat from four woodcocks or six snipe, cut it up, and chop up some truffles and make it into forcemeat. Fry the trail of the woodcock or snipe in a little butter, and place on little rounds of fried bread and arrange round the dish. Stew the bones of the woodcocks or snipe to make the gravy, reduce it, and add a glass of Marsala to the broth and serve in a boat.   Pheasant à la Victoria.  Take a quarter of a pound of bacon, cut it up in pieces (frying the bacon first), add a small clove of garlic, a small shalot, a bayleaf, half a carrot, half a turnip, half a dozen stewing oysters, and salt and pepper to taste.

Serve with rich Espagnole sauce or oyster sauce on a croustade of potato.   Pigeons à la Duchesse.  Split a couple of pigeons in halves, remove the breast bones and beat them flat, sauté them with two ounces of butter, pepper and salt. Press them flat between two plates with a weight on them, and when the pigeons are cold spread the quenelle meat over the cut side of the birds; then egg and breadcrumb them and fry in fat. Dish in a circle with brown sauce round and a macédoine of vegetables in the centre.   Pigeons à la Financière.  Take four pigeons, truss and braise them in stock, then glaze them, dish them up against a block of fried bread. Pour round half a pint of Financière sauce, and garnish with small quenelles of forcemeat, truffles, mushrooms, and cockscombs in the centre.   Pigeons à la Merveilleuse.  Blanch a brace of pigeons, and beat the backs so as to spread out the breasts, boil them in equal quantities of stock and Chablis, season with salt and pepper, a sprig of parsley, two shalots, and two cloves; when cooked, take them out of the stewpan, and cook some mushrooms, twelve shelled crayfish, and a little flour in the sauce of the pigeons, boil for half an hour, reduce and thicken the sauce with yolks of egg and cream, season with finely chopped parsley and pour over the pigeons, and serve garnished with the heads of the crayfish.   Ballotines of Pigeon à la Moderne.  Take four boned pigeons, cut them lengthways in two, and make a farce of half a pound of pork sausage meat, half a spoonful of chopped truffles, the same of mushrooms, a few pieces of tongue cut into dice shapes, a bouquet garni, pepper and salt, and one yolk of an egg, all well mixed together. Then divide it into eight equal parts, and fill the halves of the pigeons with it; make them into round balls, cutting off the feet. Tie each piece of pigeon in a little bit of calico, and braise them till nicely tender. Then let them cool, tie them up tightly, and let them get quite cold; place one of the feet in each ballotine, and arrange them on a sauté-pan. Take off the calico, make them hot and glaze them, and serve with mushrooms and peas, and with a rich brown sauce over them.   Pigeons en Poqueton.  Put some pâté de foie gras forcemeat, or any other forcemeat, into a small stewpan, and spread it all over at the bottom and sides, rubbing the stewpan first with butter. Put in a couple of pigeons trussed for roasting, some sweetbreads and tongue cut into neat pieces, and some button mushrooms; arrange all these tastily in the pan, place some more forcemeat on the top, cover it over with slices of bacon, and bake it in a gentle oven. Before closing it, pour some good gravy inside. The pigeons should be seasoned with pepper and salt, and just rubbed with garlic. When it is cooked, take it from the oven, and turn it carefully out into its dish, and pour a very rich sauce over it.   Pigeon en Ragoût de "]]]
