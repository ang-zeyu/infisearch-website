The average length of the      nasal bones in the series from Pocatello is 7.1 mm. The averages,      which have not been included in Table 1, for three measurements of      the series from Carbon County, Wyoming, are as follows (Encampment,      males; Encampment, females; Savery, males; and Savery, females,      respectively): alveolobasilar length, 14.4, 14.3, 14.5, 14.3;      interorbital breadth, 3.5, 3.4, 3.5, 3.4; depth of braincase, 7.8,      7.6, 7.9, 7.6. Additional measurements are included in Table 1 for      other series.  _Discussion._--The name _Microtus montanus caryi_ Bailey is here placed in synonymy under _M. m. nanus_ (Merriam). Vernon Bailey (1917) in his description of _caryi_ made four assumptions that have been found to be entirely or partly invalid. First, he assumed that this is an \"extreme variant which gradually changes in characters across Nevada and Utah, and reaches its maximum variation in Wyoming.\" The differences pointed out in subsequent descriptions of subspecies found in the above area do not show a gradual change in any character, or in the number of characters, nor is _caryi_ an extreme when compared with the other subspecies. Second, _Microtus nanus_ was not, as Bailey assumed, a different species than _Microtus montanus_. Third, he assumed that the characteristics of adults of _nanus_ were adequately ascertainable from the thirteen topotypes available to him. Subsequent sampling from Idaho shows that the series of specimens available to Bailey was made up mostly of young and subadult animals. Finally, _caryi_ does not occupy as Bailey stated \"the meadows along streams in the arid sagebrush country of the Bear River, Green River, and Wind River valleys\" exclusively, or characteristically. When the localities from which the species actually is known are plotted, it seems that the arid basin serves as a barrier and that the species is more commonly and abundantly found in montane meadows in the Transition and Canadian life-zones.  Certain samples, here assigned to _M. m. nanus_, that vary from the average of the subspecies deserve comment. For example, mice from the area in Wyoming southwest of the Green River (in the Uinta Mountains) have relatively smaller feet, but are larger in both total length and size of skull. Specimens from near Afton, Lincoln County, Wyoming, are relatively large in both total length and size of skull. This series and specimens from Teton County, Wyoming, are intermediate between _nanus_ from Idaho and the newly named subspecies from near Cody, Park County, Wyoming, described below, in terms of both darkness and the amount of reddish color. Mice from Laramie County are more richly reddish-brown. The specimens from near Savery, in Carbon County, Wyoming, are darker. The alveolobasilar length relative to the condylobasilar length is smaller in the series from along Deer Creek, 16 mi. S, 11 mi. W Waltman, Natrona County, Wyoming. The series from the southern tier of counties in Wyoming and some of the specimens from Colorado have relatively wider zygomatic arches. The specimens from southern Sweetwater County, Wyoming, are relatively paler, have a relatively longer tail and longer hindfeet, lesser condylobasilar length, and wider braincase. Most of these variations are of questionable significance; they may be chance variations owing to errors in sampling.  Much of the south-central part of the state is relatively low and relatively arid. This area includes the arid basin of the Green River and its major tributaries and the arid Red Desert along the continental divide in Sweetwater County. This area might have acted as a barrier to the mice; gene flow might have been prevented between the populations of the western part of the state and those farther east in the Medicine Bow Mountains and Laramie Mountains. Nevertheless geographic variations of subspecific worth have not taken place. The barrier has either not been of as long duration, or has not been so complete and effective, as the other barriers in the state, namely the Absaroka Range, the Big Horn Basin, the Shoshone Basin, and the valley of the North Platte River. These four barriers presumably have led to the differentiation of the two subspecies that are newly named beyond. Each of the two areas which is set apart by these barriers and in which one of the newly named subspecies has evolved is small; therefore there is a lesser amount of suitable habitat available for each of the newly named mice than there is for _M. m. nanus_. It is conceivable, therefore, that in periods of adverse conditions in each of the small areas the size of the effective breeding population may have been so small that random genetic drift could have operated effectively, or that selection was more critical than in a larger, more stable population. It is difficult to test these possibilities because the selective value of the taxonomic characters is unknown. The observed pattern of variation and facts of distribution are, however, not contradictory to the above possibilities.       _Specimens examined._--Total, 993, distributed as follows: All      specimens unless otherwise indicated are in the University of      Kansas Museum of Natural History.

E and ⅗ mi.      S Cody, 5020 ft., Park Co., Wyoming; obtained on August 11, 1948,      by James W. Bee, original number 18-8-11-48.       _Range._--In northwestern Wyoming eastward from the Absaroka and      Wind River ranges into the western part of the Big Horn Basin.       _Diagnosis._--A relatively large _Microtus montanus_; tail actually      and relatively long; hind foot actually but not relatively large;      skull large; zygomatic expanse actually and relatively large;      alveolobasilar length relatively large; upper molar tooth-row      relatively long; color relatively light, not reddish.  [Illustration: FIG. 1. Geographic range of _Microtus montanus_ in Wyoming, Colorado, and adjacent areas. The solid circles represent localities from which specimens have been examined; the hollow circles represent type localities. The ranges of subspecies in Utah are after Durrant, 1952.

Certain proportions which differ from those of _nanus_ and which      are not in close agreement with the observed differences with age      in specimens of _nanus_ of a size comparable to _codiensis_ are      relatively large alveolobasilar length, relatively long alveolar      length of upper molar tooth-row, relatively wide-spreading      zygomatic arches, and relatively long tail. The color in      _codiensis_ is lighter than in _nanus_. As compared to the new      subspecies named below from the Big Horn Mountains to the east,      _codiensis_ is of similar size in head-body length, but has a      relatively as well as actually longer tail; the hind foot averages      longer; the upper molar tooth-row is relatively longer; the color      is slightly paler and less grizzled; the bullae are larger and less      flattened; the angle formed at the suture between the basioccipital      and basisphenoid bones is less acute; and the region of the suture      is less prominently elevated between the bullae when viewed from      the ventral aspect. The pterygoid plates mesial and posterodorsal      to the posterior end of the last upper molar are less fenestrated,      and the incisive foramina are less constricted posteriorly.  [Illustration: FIG. 2. Map showing the major barriers to _Microtus montanus_ in Wyoming and Colorado; the barriers are the low areas named on the map (the name \"Black Hills\" is on the map for another reason; these hills are not a barrier). The major mountainous areas higher than approximately 8000 feet in elevation in Wyoming, Colorado and Utah are stippled. These mountainous areas include the habitat that is most suitable for the montane meadow mouse. The Black Hills are unoccupied by this species but these hills seem to be ecologically suitable for the species.]       _Measurements._--The average and the extremes for some measurements      of 34 males and females, 27 from the type locality and 7 from other      localities in the range assigned to this subspecies, are as      follows: total length, 165 (146-186); length of tail, 44.2 (35-55);      hind foot, 19.6 (17-21); condylobasilar length of the skull, 25.5      (24.0-27.5); zygomatic breadth, 15.6 (14.7-16.6); alveolar length      of upper molar tooth-row, 6.6 (6.2-7.0); prelambdoidal breadth, 8.8      (8.1-9.5); lambdoidal breadth, 12.0 (11.2-12.8). As an indication      of variability and for comparison with other series the coefficient      of variability and two times the standard error of the mean for      each measurement in this series are included in Table 1. The      averages for some measurements of 27 topotypes are as follows:      total length, 162; length of tail, 45.5; hind foot, 19.9;      condylobasilar length, 25.6; palatilar length, 14.0; molar series,      6.6; alveolobasilar length, 14.9; zygomatic breadth, 15.6;      interorbital breadth, 3.5; lambdoidal breadth, 12.1; prelambdoidal      breadth, 8.9; depth of braincase, 7.8.  _Discussion._--Three species of _Microtus_ were collected by James W. Bee at the type locality. _Microtus montanus codiensis_, _Microtus longicaudus mordax_, and _Microtus pennsylvanicus modestus_ were taken in the same runways in the same meadow, at the same time. _Microtus ochrogaster haydeni_, although not taken at this locality, occurs in the Big Horn Basin. These four species differ in their geographic ranges, being largely allopatric, except _M. montanus_ and _M. longicaudus_ which are sympatric. Although the different species have ecological preferences and habits which differ, several species of _Microtus_ may occur together in local areas such as the above. Certain of the characteristics of _M. m. codiensis_ are intermediate between those of the species _M. montanus_ on one hand and those of the other three species on the other hand. Could interspecific hybridization between \"good species\" of _Microtus_ take place in nature and possibly alter the characteristics of a local population?       _Specimens examined._--Total, 50, distributed as follows      (abbreviations for collections are given in the account of _M. m.      nanus_; localities that are not represented in Fig. 1 because      overlapping or crowding of the symbols would result are      Italicized):       MONTANA: _Carbon Co._: Beartooth Mountains, 2 (USBS); _Beartooth      Lake_, 1 (USBS).
