Since the builder had artfully omitted all low branches, there was little chance of his knocking his head off.  Towards noon, he paused to rest at the little pool on the edge of the woods. He waved to a group of guards he saw peering at him across an open field of what looked very much like grass. One of the men ran over.  \"The Jursan envoy is back, Your Illustrious Sublimity.\"  Vyrtl sighed.  \"Tell General Wilkins to bring her here immediately.\"  He turned away and sat upon a flat stone beside the pool.  After a while, he noticed that the ground was liberally supplied with pebbles for casting into the water. He was watching the spreading ripples about fifteen minutes later when he heard approaching voices behind him.  A glance over his shoulder showed him Wilkins and two guards escorting the old woman. He turned away, tossing another pebble into the pool with a half-hearted motion of his arm.  When Wilkins coughed discreetly behind him, he told the aide and the guards to withdraw. He listened to the footsteps until he knew they were beyond range of ordinary conversation.  \"You are the same Daphne Foster?\" he asked, still facing the pool.  \"The same, Your Illustrious Sublimity.\"  \"Let us dispense with formality. Tell me how you did it.\"  \"It is simple ... in a way. But it requires the use of a not-so-simple instrument.\"  \"Such as I?\" he asked, apparently intent upon the water.  \"I did not mean Your Illustrious--I did not mean it that way. It is a little triumph of our Jursan technicians, which will shortly be at your disposal. I used it to force an illusion upon you.\"  \"And very cleverly, I admit. Do you have it with you?\"  \"Yes. It is compact. It merely operates upon the idea that other forces can be used to produce hypnosis besides lights, drugs, and soothing sounds.\"  \"Turn it on!\" ordered Vyrtl.         *       *       *       *       *  He waited a moment, then twisted around on the stone to face her. There was no sign of the woman he had seen crossing the field. Before him seemed to stand the black-haired, lithe girl.  The only change was in her eyes, which no longer smiled into his so provocatively.  _Funny_, thought Vyrtl. _When we actually were strangers, she seemed so intimate. Only now does she look at me so coldly._  \"You see?\" she said, and started to reach for some switch or button concealed by the jewel at her breast.  Vyrtl stopped her with a gesture.  \"You must also be skilled in the sciences of the mind,\" he remarked. \"What I mean is ... I suppose you never really looked like that?\"  She shook her head a trifle ruefully.  \"Not quite. Most of it is in your own imagination. We know a good deal about you, Your--\"  \"You deduced somehow what I would look for,\" interrupted Vyrtl, nodding. \"I can see how a study of the things I chose to have about me--paintings, statues, furnishings, even people--might yield keys to my preferences. You did remarkably well.\"  He tossed another pebble and stared at the ripples.  \"I suppose every man has his ideal of a woman,\" he said. \"I doubt that any man has _seen_ his absolute ideal--except me. I wonder if you know what it does to one?\"  He chose a flat pebble and sent it skipping across the surface with a vicious snap of his wrist. It bounced three ... four ... five times, and sank.  \"I presume,\" said Daphne Foster, breaking a tight little silence, \"that you will grant me time to set my affairs in order?\"  Vyrtl weighed a pebble in his hand.  \"You expect to be executed,\" he stated flatly.  \"Naturally, we knew all along that someone would have to pay for tricking you. The Emperor of Pollux must, after all, maintain his dignity.\"  Vyrtl wondered if he had detected a note of irony in the musical voice. He marveled anew at the pleasure of listening to her. But of course, he reminded himself, he heard his own imagined ideal of what a lovely woman's voice should be.  \"No,\" he said abruptly, swinging about. \"I am merely going to insist that you fulfill the terms of the agreement by remaining at my court. I want you near me from now on.\"  She blinked at that.  \"But, surely ... you must realize ... it is only an illusion!\" she protested.  \"As am I,\" said Vyrtl. \"A figurehead imprisoned in a maze of formalities and so-called pleasures.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He saw that she could not understand what could be wrong with his position.  \"Once, when I was very young,\" he said, \"I thought I would rule. But fourteen planets require a whole _council_ of co-ordinators! I gave up that idea and tried to enjoy myself.\"  She stared at him uncertainly. He waved a hand at the artificial forest.  \"It has been like that ever since. They fall all over themselves to devise new ways of getting my attention and to present pleasures and entertainment I am incapable of enjoying. I have more wealth than I can estimate, I sometimes forget which palace I am in, even my wives look alike by now.\"  \"I must sympathize with Your Illustrious Sublimity.\"  He flung her a hard stare.  \"Perhaps you ought! Even my generals and their soldiers have their dreams--of conquest or loot. The engineer who built this dome pictures himself famous and admired. Wilkins is proud of his influence, and other courtiers have visions of doing away with Wilkins and replacing him.\"  He stood up restlessly.  \"You will laugh at me, I know--but there is little enjoyment in life when every whim is catered to at a snap of one's fingers. What have I to _desire_?\"  \"I see.\" She nodded slowly. \"The old saying about the pleasure of anticipation outweighing that of attainment.\"  \"You should know. You Jursans and your scientific renaissance, your goal of contacting Terra again.\"  He beckoned to Wilkins and the two guards. They ran eagerly across the grass.  \"You see?\" he snorted. \"Sometimes I almost wish they would ignore me!\"  He looked at her and saw the blue eyes achieve their knowing, amused smile once more.  \"That's right,\" he said, smiling back. \"Now I shall have something to keep my thoughts from becoming dull and bored. A man needs some impossible dream for moments when he wants to relax.\"  Wilkins panted up, trying to look alert and willing.  \"The unattainable Lady Daphne will accompany us to our capital,\" said Vyrtl. \"Make the necessary arrangements.\"  He enjoyed the way his aide covered up a momentary bewilderment.  _No one else will ever, ever understand this_, he thought with an unaccustomed thrill of pleasure and amusement.         *       *       *       *       *"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32650"],["title","Some Personal Reminiscences of Service in the Cavalry of the Army of the Potomac (#0)"],["body","(http://www.archive.org/details/americana)    Note: Images of the original pages are available through       Internet Archive/American Libraries.

Reprinted from \"The United Service,\" January, 1889.  Philadelphia: L. R. Hamersly & Co. 1889.     _SOME PERSONAL REMINISCENCES OF SERVICE IN THE CAVALRY OF THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC._   At the earnest solicitation of my many military friends, I have thrown together some reminiscences of my personal experience as a cavalryman during the late War of the Rebellion. Though my four years of campaigning began with a three months' tour of tramping with the \"dough-boys\" under General Patterson in the spring and early summer of 1861, the latter was only a prolonged picnic. Two days before I was mustered out of the Ninth Pennsylvania Infantry I enrolled myself in the First Pennsylvania Cavalry, and soon discovered that I was more fitted for riding a horse than for trudging through the slush and mud with a heavy \"Harper's Ferry\" musket on my shoulder.  I will pass over the tedious instructions of the school of the trooper, mounted and dismounted, and begin my reminiscences as a full-fledged Yankee cavalryman.  The First Pennsylvania Cavalry, which originally belonged to the Pennsylvania Reserve Corps, began its experience as a fighting regiment in a skirmish and charge near Dranesville, Virginia, on November 26, 1861, and, strange to relate, the first man killed was our assistant surgeon, Dr. Alexander. The regiment's first experience of heavy firing was in the battle of Dranesville, on December 20. This engagement was fought by a brigade of the Pennsylvania Reserve Corps, commanded by General E. O. C. Ord, my regiment supporting Eastman's battery. The enemy had the same number of regiments and guns that we had, and their commanding officer was General J. E. B. Stuart, but Ord outgeneraled him and gave us the victory, the rebels retreating from the field.  The campaign of the spring of 1862 showed what some, at least, of the cavalry did before General Hooker offered his liberal reward for a \"dead cavalryman.\"[1] Those who served in the Army of the Potomac will remember that from the fall of 1861 to the summer of 1862 the cavalry were for the most part scattered about and used as escorts, strikers, dog-robbers, and orderlies for all the generals and their numerous staff officers from the highest in rank down to the second lieutenants. The cavalry force under General George D. Bayard, then colonel of my regiment, consisting of the First New Jersey, Second New York, and First Pennsylvania Cavalry Regiments, was the first brigade organized in that branch of the service in the United States army. The campaign began with easy marches to Catlett's Station, on the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, and scouting to Warrenton and Rappahannock Station.        [1] In this connection it may be well to quote the following       extract from an article in the _Century Magazine_ of May, 1888,       by Colonel William F. Fox, entitled \"The Chances of being hit in       Battle\": \"The muster-out rolls of the various mounted commands       show that there were ten thousand five hundred and ninety-six       'dead cavalrymen' who were killed in action during the war, of       whom six hundred and seventy-one were officers, the proportionate       loss of officers being greater than in the infantry.\"  On the morning of the 17th of April we left Catlett's Station and moved in the direction of Falmouth. In this movement we were supported by a brigade of infantry commanded by General Augur. On the morning of the 18th, about three o'clock, we charged upon the heights of Falmouth, drove the enemy from their position, and captured the quaint old town, but we were unable to save the bridge spanning the river, as the enemy had set fire to the end on the Fredericksburg side. This was my first experience in a mounted charge of any consequence. In this engagement I was acting as assistant adjutant-general for Bayard, with the rank of first lieutenant. The success of our cavalry engagement gave Bayard his star and promoted me to the rank of captain and the command of a squadron.  After a tour of scouting and picketing along the Rappahannock River south of Fredericksburg, we were assigned to General McDowell's corps of observation, which was composed of three divisions of infantry,--McCall's, Shields's, and King's. The operations of this corps were intended to serve either as a protection to the city of Washington or as a reinforcement to McClellan on the Peninsula.  About June 1 the cavalry took the advance on the telegraph road leading towards Richmond, and reached the forks of a road near Hanover Court-House, to which place McClellan's patrols came. While we who were in the advance-guard were congratulating ourselves upon getting under the right wing of McClellan's army without a fight, our hopes were suddenly blasted by the following order sent to \"Capt. Hamp. Thomas, Commanding Advance-Guard: Sir,--You will return with your command as rapidly as possible. Don't blow your horses if you can help it. Cross over to Falmouth and receive further instructions. (Signed) G. D. B., B. G.\"  When we reached Fredericksburg we noticed considerable excitement. General Shields's division had gone, the First New Jersey and First Pennsylvania Cavalry and four companies of the \"Bucktails\" were on the march northward, and the balance of our brigade of cavalry was left with King's and McCall's divisions. Upon reporting to General Bayard, we learned the cause of all this rapid marching. The authorities at Washington had become frightened at Stonewall Jackson's movement against General Banks, who was in the Shenandoah Valley. This scattering of General McDowell's strong corps was fatal to General McClellan's plans while he was on the Peninsula.  Then commenced one of the wildest marches I ever experienced. Day and night we marched through heavy rain-storms, over the mountains and swimming swollen streams. The last ten miles were made in one hour and twenty minutes, and we lost several horses foundered after crossing the Shenandoah River. We reached Strasburg, in the valley, on June 7, just in time to cut off the rear of Jackson's army. We had a running fight all the way up the valley until we reached Harrisonburg, where we had a very severe engagement,--our two regiments of cavalry and the four companies of \"Bucktails\" against a division of rebel infantry. The First New Jersey Cavalry lost its colonel and several officers captured, and the \"Bucktails,\" Colonel Kane and Captain Fred. Taylor captured. The rebels lost heavily in killed and wounded, among the former being General Turner Ashby. General Fremont's command, which had crossed over from the Kanawha Valley, joined us at Harrisonburg the next day, when we moved towards Port Republic. Here Fremont's men had a very sharp engagement at Cross Keys on June 8. Our cavalry were only lookers-on in this fight, but Jackson succeeded in checking our forces with his rear-guard, while the head of his column crossed the bridge at Port Republic, driving away Shields's advance, which had passed up the Luray Valley expecting to cut him off. They were too late, however, in reaching that point, for Jackson had slipped away and moved his men down to Richmond by rail, taking the same position which we were to have taken on McClellan's right flank. The result was the change of base, with all its hard fighting, hard marching, and heavy losses, to the James River at Harrison's Landing.  We then began a long and weary march down the valley, over rivers and mountains, to the vicinity of Culpeper Court-House. On our arrival there came the order for General Bayard's cavalry to report to the head-quarters of the Army of Northern Virginia, J. Pope commanding, with head-quarters in the saddle. It took twenty wagons to haul that saddle! We were assigned to picket and scouting duty, our lines stretching from Raccoon Ford to Barnett's Ford, on the Rapidan, a distance of fifteen miles. On the night of August 8 our pickets were driven in a short distance from the river, and on the morning of the 9th commenced what is known as the battle of Cedar Mountain. In that engagement General Bayard showed the finest order of generalship. With four regiments of cavalry he held Jackson's whole command of eighteen thousand men at bay from 4 A.M. until 4 P.M. This movement of Bayard's was made in echelons of squadrons, single-rank formation, and gave the idea to the enemy that we had about ten thousand men in his front. The men of Crawford's and Hartsuff's brigades will bear witness to the tenacity with which our cavalry held on until they came to our relief.  To relate an incident of what cavalrymen could do before a reward was offered for a dead one: During the afternoon a battery of four guns belonging to General Banks's command was left in a very exposed position. In front of these guns was an open field, and on the other side some woods in which a brigade of rebel infantry had formed in regimental front, four lines deep, and was moving out to capture the battery. General Banks asked General Bayard if the guns could be saved. Bayard, taking in the situation, ordered Major Falls, of the First Pennsylvania Cavalry, to charge his battalion upon the enemy's infantry. The charge was made, but only one company succeeded in reaching the enemy. Some men of the company passed through the lines and returned, while the balance of the battalion was repulsed before reaching the open field. The captain of the company was wounded in five places, the second lieutenant killed,--in fact, the company came near being wiped out of existence; and when the first lieutenant, Warren L. Holbrook, came to rally the remnant of his company he found but a corporal's"]]]
