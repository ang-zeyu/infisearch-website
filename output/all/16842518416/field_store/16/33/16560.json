With the Red-shoulder it is often called 'Chicken Hawk,' but does not deserve the name. It nests in trees 30-70 feet up and in April lays 2-4 eggs, dull white sparingly marked with brown.   RED-SHOULDERED HAWK  _Buteo lineatus lineatus. Case 1, Fig. 4; Case 3 Fig. 12_  [Illustration: RED-SHOULDERED HAWK. ADULT.  Note the Barred Tail.]            Seen from below the reddish brown underparts and           black and white barred tail will identify adults           of this species. Immature birds are streaked below           with blackish; the tail is dark grayish brown           indistinctly barred, but the shoulder is always           rusty, though this is not a marking one can see in           life. L., male. 18½; female, 20¼.            _Range._ Eastern North America from northern           Florida to Canada; resident except in the northern           part of its range.            Washington, common P.R. Ossining, common P.R.           Cambridge, common, Apl.-Nov., less common in           winter. N. Ohio, common P.R. Glen Ellyn, P.R.,           more common than the Red-tail; chiefly T.V.  A medium-sized, heavy-bodied Hawk with wings which, when closed, reach well toward the tip of the tail. It lives both in the woods and open places, and may be flushed from the border of a brook or seen soaring high in the air. Its note, frequently uttered, as it swings in wide circles, is a distinctive _Kèe-you, Kèe-you_, quite unlike the call of any of our other Hawks. It is often well imitated by the Blue Jay. The Red-shoulder feeds chiefly on mice and frogs. It nests in trees 30-60 feet up and, in April, lays 3-5 eggs, white marked with brown.  The Florida Red-shouldered Hawk (_Buteo lineatus alleni_), a smaller form with grayer head and paler underparts, is a resident in Florida and along the coast from South Carolina to Mexico. It nests in February.   BROAD-WINGED HAWK  _Buteo platypterus_            With a general resemblance to the Red-shouldered           Hawk, but smaller; no red on the bend of the wing,           or rusty in the primaries, only the outer three of           which are 'notched.' L., male, 15¾; female, 16¾.            _Range._ Eastern North America. Breeding from the           Gulf States to the St. Lawrence; winters from Ohio           and Delaware to S.A.; migrates northward in March.            Washington, uncommon P.R. Ossining, tolerably           common S.R., Mch. 15-Oct. 23. Cambridge, uncommon           T.V. in early fall, rare in spring and summer;           Apl. 25-Sept. 30. N. Ohio, not common P.R. Glen           Ellyn, not common S.R., Apl. 10-Oct. 4. SE. Minn.,           common S.R., Mch. 11.  A rather retiring, unwary Hawk which nests in thick woods and is less often seen in the open than the Red-shoulder, but, when migrating, hundreds pass high in the air, with other Hawks. Its call is a high, thin, penetrating whistle. It nests in late April and early May, laying 2-4 whitish eggs marked with brown.   ROUGH-LEGGED HAWK  _Archibuteo lagopus sancti-johannis_            Legs feathered to the toes; basal half of tail           white; belly black. Some individuals are wholly           black. L., male, 21; female, 23.            _Range._ Breeds in northern Canada; usually rare           and irregular in the northern U.S., from November           to April.            Washington, rare and irregular W.V. Ossining,           casual. Cambridge, T.V., not common, Nov.-Dec.;           Mch.-Apl. N. Ohio, not common W.V., Nov. 20-Apl.           3. Glen Ellyn, quite common W.V., Oct. 12-Apl. 30.           SE. Minn., W.V., Oct. 15-Mch.  Frequents fields and marshes, where it hunts to and fro after mice, which form its principal fare.   GOLDEN EAGLE  _Aquila chrysaetos_            With the Bald Eagle, largest of our raptorial           birds; with a general resemblance to the young of           that species, in which the head and tail are dark,           but with the legs feathered to the toes. L., male,           32½; female, 37½.            _Range._ Northern parts of the northern           Hemisphere; in the United States, rare east of the           Mississippi.            Washington, rare W.V., Ossining, A.V. Cambridge, 1           record. N. Ohio, rare W.V. SE. Minn., P.R.  The Golden Eagle is so rare in the eastern United States and its general resemblance to a young Bald Eagle is so close, that only an experienced ornithologist could convince me that he had seen a Golden Eagle east of the Mississippi.   BALD EAGLE  _Haliæetus leucocephalus leucocephalus. Case 3, Fig. 11_            When immature the head and tail resemble the body           in color, and at this age the bird is sometimes           confused with the more western Golden Eagle. The           latter has the head browner and the legs feathered           to the toes. L., male, 33; female, 35½.            _Range._ North America but rare in the interior           and in California, migratory at the northern limit           of its range.            Washington, not common P.R. Ossining, common P.R.           Cambridge, of irregular occurrence at all seasons.           N. Ohio, tolerably common P.R. SE. Minn., P.R.,           becoming rare.  An adult Bald Eagle will at once be recognized by its white head and tail; the immature birds by their large size. Eagles are usually found near the water where fish may be obtained either on the shore or from the Osprey. The call of the male is a human-like, loud, clear _cac-cac-cac_; that of the female is said to be more harsh and often broken. Eagles nest in tall trees and on cliffs, and lay two or three dull white eggs, in Florida, in November and December; in Maine, in April.     FALCONS, CARACARAS, ETC. FAMILY FALCONIDÆ   GYRFALCON  _Falco rusticolus gyrfalco_            A large Hawk with long, pointed wings, the upper           parts brown with numerous narrow, buffy bars or           margins, the tail evenly barred with grayish and           blackish, the underparts white lightly streaked           with black. L. 22.            _Range._ Arctic regions; south in winter rarely to           New York and Minnesota. The Gray Gyrfalcon (_F. r.           rusticolus_) a paler form, with a streaked crown,           the Black Gyrfalcon (_F. r. obsoletus_) a           slate-colored race, and the White Gyrfalcon (_F.           islandus_) are also rare winter visitants to the           northern United States.  These great Falcons are so rare in the United States that unless they are seen by an experienced observer, under exceptionally favorable conditions, authentic records of their visits can be based only on the actual capture of specimens.   DUCK HAWK  _Falco peregrinus anatum_            The adult is slaty blue above; buff below marked           with black, and with black cheek-patches. Immature           birds are blackish above margined with rusty,           below deep rusty buff streaked with blackish. L.,           male, 16; female, 19.            _Range._ Northern Hemisphere, breeding south           locally to New Jersey and in Alleghanies to South           Carolina; winters from New Jersey southward.            Washington, rare and irregular W.V. Ossining,           casual. Cambridge, rare T.V., casual in winter,           SE. Minn., uncommon S.R., Apl. 4.  As the Peregrine of falconry we know of the Duck Hawk as a fearless, dashing hunter of greater power of wing and talon. It nests in rocky cliffs in April and from its eyrie darts upon passing Pigeons and other birds. It is most often seen following the coast-line during migrations where it takes toll of Ducks and shore-birds. Three to four heavily marked, brownish eggs are laid in April.   PIGEON HAWK  _Falco columbarius_            A small Hawk, about the size of a Sparrow Hawk.           The adult is slaty blue above, with a rusty collar           and a barred, white-tipped tail; below buff,           streaked with blackish. Young birds have the           upperparts blackish brown. L. 11.            _Range._ Breeds north of, and winters chiefly           south of the United States. Migrates northward in           April and May, and southward in September and           October.            Washington, not uncommon T.V. Ossining, tolerably           common T.V., Apl. 1-May 11; Aug. 10-Oct. 15.           Cambridge, common T.V., Apl. 25-May 5; Sept.           25-Oct. 20; occasional in winter. N. Ohio, rare           P.R. Glen Ellyn, regular but rare T.V., Apl.           26-May 5; Sept. 1-Oct. 16. SE. Minn., Apl. 13.  We know this Hawk as a not common migrant generally seen in open places and along the shores. It feeds chiefly on small birds.   SPARROW HAWK  _Falco sparverius sparverius. Case 1, Figs. 7, 8; Case 3, Figs. 5, 6_            The male has the tail with only one bar; the           breast unmarked; the abdomen with black spots;           while the female has the tail with several bars,           the underparts streaked with brownish. In both           sexes the bright reddish brown of the upperparts,           black markings about the head, and small size are           gold field characters. L. 10.            _Range._ Sparrow Hawks are found throughout the           greater part of the Western Hemisphere. Our           eastern race inhabits the region east of the           Rockies and is migratory at the northern limit of           its range. Southern Florida specimens are slightly           smaller and darker and are known as the Florida           Sparrow Hawk (_F. s. paulus_).  [Illustration: SPARROW HAWK HOVERING ABOVE ITS PREY.]            Washington, common W.V., rare S.R. Ossining,           rather rare P.R. Cambridge, P.R., common in           summer, rare in winter. N. Ohio, common P.R. Glen           Ellyn, rather rare S.R., Mch. 10-Oct. 26.  The Sparrow Hawk is one of our commonest and most familiar Hawks. He is a handsome little Falcon, and though his prey is chiefly humble grasshoppers,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31751"],["title","What Bird is That? (#6)"],["body"," he captures them in a sportsmanlike manner by \"waiting on\" or hovering on rapidly beating wings over his game and dropping on it with deadly aim. His call is a high, rapidly repeated _Killy-killy-killy_. The three to seven eggs, finely marked with reddish brown, are laid in a hollow limb or similar situation in April.   AUDUBON'S CARACARA  _Polyborus cheriway cheriway_            A falcon-like Vulture with a bare face, black cap,           white throat, breast and nape; the rest of the           plumage is black, the tail barred with white. L.           22.            _Range._ Mexican border and southward; south           central Florida.  In the eastern United States the Caracara is found only in the Kissimmee prairie region of southern Florida where its presence, so far from others of its kind, furnishes one of the problems in distribution which stimulate the imagination of the faunal naturalist.     OSPREYS. FAMILY PANDIONIDÆ   OSPREY  _Pandion haliætus carolinensis. Case 3, Fig. 14_            The Osprey or Fish Hawk is often miscalled           'Eagle,' but it is a smaller bird with white,           instead of blackish underparts. L. 23.            _Range._ The Osprey is found throughout the           greater part of the world; the American form           occurs in both North and South America and winters           from the southern United States southward,           starting northward in March.            Washington, uncommon S.R., Mch. 19-Nov. 30.           Ossining, common T.V., rare S.R., Apl. 3-May 26;           Sept. 29-Oct. 20. Cambridge, rather common T.V.,           Apl.-May; Sept.-Oct. N. Ohio, rare S.R., Apl.           20-Oct. Glen Ellyn, two records, May and Sept.  The Osprey, or Fish Hawk, feeds on fish and nothing but fish. He is, therefore, never found far from his fishing grounds, where no one who has seen him plunge for his prey and rise with it from the water will doubt his ability to supply his wants. Ospreys usually nest in trees at varying distances from the ground, but sometimes on cliffs or even on the ground itself, and return year after year to the same nest. The Osprey's alarm note is a high, loud, complaining whistle, frequently repeated. The eggs are laid in late April and early May. They are usually four in number, buffy white, heavily marked with chocolate.     BARN OWLS. FAMILY ALUCONIDÆ   BARN OWL  _Aluco pratincola pratincola. Case 3, Fig. 17_            A light-colored Owl, looking almost white in the           dusk. L. 18.            _Range._ Barn Owls are found throughout the world.           Our species is rare north of New Jersey and Ohio.           It is migratory only at the northern limit of its           range.            Washington, not rare P.R. Ossining, A.V.  This is the 'Monkey-faced Owl' of towers and steeples. Few who hear its loud, sudden scream or rapidly repeated _crree-crree-crree_ know their author, who may live for years in the heart of a village a stranger to its human inhabitants. The mice, however, have tragic evidence of his presence in the nightly raids he makes upon their ranks. The nest is made in the diurnal retreat, 5-9 white eggs being laid in April.     HORNED OWLS, HOOT OWLS, ETC. FAMILY STRIGIDÆ   LONG-EARED OWL  _Asio wilsonianus. Case 1, Fig. 17_            Distinguished by very long ear-tufts. L. 14¾.            _Range._ Temperate North America. Winters south to           Georgia and Louisiana.            Washington, common P.R. Ossining, common P.R.           Cambridge, rare, P.R. but sometimes common in fall           and winter. N. Ohio, uncommon P.R. Glen Ellyn,           rare, fall records only, Nov. 7-Dec. 14.  An Owl of evergreen clumps and dense growths, where its presence is often betrayed by the litter below of undigested pellets of hair and bones which Owls eject at the mouth. It is not a \"hoot\" Owl, and even many ornithologists have not heard its notes, which are described as a \"soft-toned, slow _wu-hunk, wu-hunk_, and a low twittering, whistling _dicky, dicky, dicky_.\" It is not a hole-inhabiting Owl and like the Great Horned nests in an old Hawk, Crow, or Squirrel nest. Three to six white eggs are laid in April.   SHORT-EARED OWL  _Asio flammeus. Case 1, Fig. 18_            The 'ears' are barely evident, the eyes are           yellow; underparts streaked. L. 15½.            _Range._ Found throughout the greater part of the           world; migrating southward at the northern part of           its North American range.            Washington, common W.V. Ossining, casual.           Cambridge, T.V., Mch. 15-Apl. 15, rare; Oct.-Nov.,           uncommon. N. Ohio, uncommon P.R. Glen Ellyn, rare,           Dec. 11-May 15. SE. Minn., common S.R.  This is a marsh Owl and we are therefore not likely to find it associated with other members of its family. Its notes are said to resemble the _ki-yi_ of a small dog. Four to seven white eggs are laid in an open nest in the grasses in April.   BARRED OWL  _Strix varia varia. Case 1, Fig. 15_            A large Owl with black eyes (the figure is           incorrect) and no 'ears.' L. 20.            _Range._ Eastern North America. Generally a           Permanent Resident. The Florida Barred Owl (_S. v.           alleni_, Case 3, Fig. 16), is somewhat darker than           the northern form and has nearly naked toes. It           inhabits Florida and the coast region from South           Carolina to Texas.            Washington, not common, rare P.R. Ossining, rare           P.R. Cambridge, P.R., sometimes common in Nov. and           Dec. N. Ohio, common P.R. Glen Ellyn, rare and           local P.R. SE. Minn., common P.R.  An Owl of the woods, common in the less thickly settled parts of its range. Its loud, sonorous notes, _whoo, whoo-whoo who-whoo, to-whoo-ah_, are often uttered. When two birds come together their united calls produce some of the most startling sounds to be heard in nature. The Barred Owl feeds chiefly on mice. It nests in hollow trees in March, laying 2-4 white eggs.   GREAT GRAY OWL  _Scotiaplex nebulosa nebulosa_            Largest of American Owls, with a general           resemblance to the Barred Owl, but nearly a third           larger and with yellow eyes. L. 27.            _Range._ Northern North America, rarely straggling           to United States in winter.            Cambridge, very rare and irregular W.V. SE. Minn.,           rare W.V.   RICHARDSON'S OWL  _Cryptoglaux funerea richardsoni_            A small Owl about the size of a Screech Owl, but           without ear-tufts. It is grayish brown above and           both head and back are spotted with black; the           underparts are white heavily streaked with grayish           brown.            _Range._ Northern Canada and Alaska, rarely           visiting the eastern United States in winter. We           are not likely to meet this Owl.            Cambridge, very rare W.V.   SAW-WHET OWL  _Cryptoglaux acadica acadica. Case 2, Fig. 41_            Smallest of our Owls; eyes yellow, no ear-tufts.           L. 8.            _Range._ Nests in the northern United States and           northward, south in the Alleghanies to Maryland;           winters rather rarely and irregularly southward to           Virginia.            Washington, rare W.V., Oct.-Mch. Ossining, rather           rare W.V., Oct. 28-Jan. 13. Cambridge, not           uncommon, W.V., Nov.-Mch. N. Ohio, rare P.R. SE.           Minn., uncommon. P.R.  A tame little Owl which sometimes may be caught in one's hand. It passes the day in dense growth, usually evergreens. Its note resembles the \"sound made when a large-tooth saw is being filed.\"   SCREECH OWL  _Otus asio asio. Case 1, Figs. 13, 14_            The two sexes are alike, the two color phases           being individual and representing dichromatism.           Among animals, gray and black squirrels furnish a           similar case. The ear-like feather-tufts give the           bird a cat-like appearance, hence the name 'Cat           Owl.' The young are downy-looking creatures evenly           barred with dusky. L. 9½.            _Range._ Screech Owls are found throughout the           greater part of the Western Hemisphere. Our           eastern form occurs in the eastern United States           from Canada southward. The Florida race (_O. a.           floridanus_, Case 3, Fig. 19) is smaller and of a           darker gray than the northern bird. The 'red'           phase is rare.            Washington, common P.R. Ossining, common P.R.           Cambridge, common P.R. N. Ohio, common P.R. Glen           Ellyn, common P.R. SE. Minn., common P.R.  This, the smallest of our 'horned' Owls, is also the commonest. It lives near and sometimes in our homes even when they are situated in towns. Its tremulous, wailing whistle (in no sense a 'screech') is therefore one of our most characteristic twilight bird-notes. Mice and insects form the greater part of the Screech Owl's fare. Four to six white eggs are laid in a hollow tree, bird-box, or similar site in April.   GREAT HORNED OWL  _Bubo virginianus virginianus. Case 1, Fig. 16_            Largest of the 'horned' Owls. L. 22.            _Range._ Western Hemisphere in many forms; our           form is confined to the eastern United States. A           Permanent Resident.            Washington, rare P.R. Ossining, tolerably common           P.R. Cambridge, uncommon, autumn or winter. N.           Ohio, rare P.R. SE. Minn., common P.R.  The Great Horned Owl retreats before the civilization that destroys the forests in which it lives. In thinly settled regions its deep-toned, monotone, _whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, whooo, whooo_ is still a characteristic bird voice, but most of us hear it only when we camp in the wilderness. The bird's fierce nature has won for it the name of \"tiger among birds.\" Rabbits, skunks, game birds and smaller prey form its fare. The 2-3 white eggs are laid in an abandoned Hawk, Crow, or squirrel nest in February; it is the first"]]]
