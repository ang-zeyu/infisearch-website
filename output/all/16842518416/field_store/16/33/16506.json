On her, it does not matter that she has no feathers save on      the head--even skin looks good. Overcome by involuntary ardor, I      boo at her. Whereupon I am violently assailed by a powerfully built      native whom I have not previously noticed to be escorting her._       _I am rescued before he can do me any permanent damage, though, if      you wish the truth, it will be a long time before I can fly again.      However, I am given notice by the cold-hearted management. Now I am      without a job. And what is more, if on this planet one is not      permitted to express one's instinctive and natural admiration for a      beautiful woman, then all I have to say is that it is a lousy      planet and I wiggle my toes at it. How do I go about getting      deported?_       _Impatiently yours,_       _Rajois Sludd_  \"Oh, I suppose it serves him right,\" Tarb said quickly, before Stet could comment, \"but don't you think it would be a good idea if the _Times_ got up a Fizbian-Terrestrial handbook of its own? It's the only solution that I can see. The regular one, I recognize now, is more than inadequate, with all that spiritual gup--\" Miss Snow drew in her breath sharply--\"and not much else. All these problems are bound to arise again and again. Frankly speaking, Stet, your solutions only take care of the individual cases; they don't establish a sound intercultural basis.\"  He grunted.  \"What's more,\" she went on eagerly, \"we could not only give copies to every Fizbian planning to visit Earth, but also print copies in Terran for Terrestrials who are interested in learning more about Fizbus and the Fizbians. In fact, all Terrans who come in contact with us should have the book. It would help both races to understand each other so much better and--\"  \"Unnecessary!\" Stet snapped, so violently that she stopped with her mouth open. \"The standard handbook is more than adequate. Whatever limitations it may have are deliberate. Setting down in cold print all that ... stuff you want to have included would make a point of things we prefer not to stress. I wouldn't want to have the Terrestrials humor me as if I were a fledgling or a foreigner.\"  He leaped out of his chair and paced up and down the office. One would think he had forgotten he ever could fly.  \"But you are a foreigner, Stet,\" Tarb said gently. \"No matter what you do or say, Terrestrials and Fizbians are--well, worlds apart.\"  \"Spiritually, I am much closer to the Terrestrials than--but you wouldn't understand.\" He and Miss Snow nodded sympathetically at each other. \"And you might be interested to know that I happen to be the author of all that 'spiritual gup.' I wrote the handbook--as a service to Fizbus, I might point out. I wasn't paid for it.\"  \"Oh, dear!\" Tarb said. \"Oh, _dear_! I really and truly am sorry, Stet.\"  He brushed her apologies aside. \"Answer that letter. Ignore the question about deportation entirely.\" He ran a foot through his crest. \"Just tell the fellow to see our personnel manager. We could use a chef in the company dining room. Haven't tasted a decent celestial ragout--at a price I could afford--since I left Fizbus.\"  \"Would you want me to print that reply in the column?\" she asked. \"'If you lose your job because you're unfamiliar with Terrestrial customs, come to the _Times_. We'll give you another job at a much lower salary.'\"  \"Of course not! Send your answer directly to him. You don't think we put any of those letters you've been answering in the column, do you? Or any that come in at all, for that matter. I have to write all the letters that are printed--and answer them myself.\"  \"I should have recognized the style,\" Tarb said. \"So this is the service the _Times_ offers to its subscribers. Nothing that would be of help. Nothing that could prevent other Fizbians from making the same mistake. Nothing that could be controversial. Nothing that would help Terrestrials to understand us. Nothing, in short, but a lot of birdseed!\"  \"Impertinence!\" Miss Snow remarked. \"You shouldn't let her talk to you like that, Mr. Zarnon.\"  \"Tarb!\" Stet roared, casting an impatient glance at Miss Snow. \"How dare you talk to me in that way? And all this is none of your business, anyway.\"  \"I'm a Fizbian,\" she stated, \"and it certainly is my business. I'm not ashamed of having wings. I'm proud of them and sorry for people who don't have them. And, by the stars, I'm going to fly. If skirts are improper to wear for flying, then I can wear slacks. I saw them in a Terrestrial fashion magazine and they're perfectly respectable.\"  \"Not for working hours,\" Miss Snow sniffed.  \"I have no intention of flying during working hours,\" Tarb snapped back. \"Even you should be able to see that the ceiling's much too low.\"  Stet ran a foot through his crest again. \"I hate to say this, Tarb, but I don't feel you're the right person for this job. You mean well, I'm sure, but you're too--too inflexible.\"  \"You mean I have principles,\" she retorted, \"and you don't.\" Which wasn't entirely true; he had principles--it was just that they were unprincipled.  \"That will be enough, Tarb,\" he said sternly. \"You'd better go now while I think this over. I'd hate to send you back to Fizbus, because I'd--well, I'd miss you. On the other hand....\"  Tarb went back to her office and drafted a long interstel to a cousin on Fizbus, explaining what she would like for a birthday present. \"And send it special delivery,\" she concluded, \"because I am having an urgent and early birthday.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Tarb Morfatch!\" Stet howled, a few months later. \"What on Earth are you doing?\"  \"Dictating into my scripto,\" Tarb said cheerfully. \"Some of the boys from the print shop helped fix it up for me. They were very nice about it, too, considering that the superscriptos will probably throw them out of work. You know, Stet, Terrestrials can be quite decent people.\"  \"Where did you get that scripto?\"  \"Cousin Mylfis sent it to me for my birthday. I must have complained about wearing out my claws on a typewriter and he didn't understand that scriptos won't work on Earth. Only they do.\" She beamed at her employer. \"All it needed was a transformer. I guess you're just not mechanically minded, Stet.\"  He clenched his feet. \"Tarb, Terrestrials aren't ready for our technology. You've done a very unwise thing in having that scripto sent to you. And I've done a very unwise thing in keeping you here against my better judgment.\"  \"Maybe the Terrestrials aren't ready,\" she said, ignoring his last remark, \"but I'm not going to wear my feet to the bone if I can get a gadget that'll do the same thing with no expenditure of physical energy.\" She placed a foot on his. \"I don't see how a thing like this could possibly corrupt the Terrestrials, Stet. It's made a better, brighter girl out of me already.\"  \"Hear, hear!\" said Drosmig hoarsely from his perch.  \"Shut up, Senbot. You just don't understand, Tarb. If you'll only--\"  \"But I'm afraid I do understand, Stet. And I won't send my scripto back.\"  \"May I come in?\" Miss Snow tapped lightly on the door frame. \"Is what I hear true?\"  \"About the scripto?\" Tarb asked. \"It certainly is. All you have to do is talk into it and the words appear on the paper. Guess that makes you obsolete, doesn't it, Miss Snow?\"  \"And high time, too,\" commented Drosmig. \"Never liked the old biddy.\"  \"Senbot....\" Stet began, and stopped. \"Oh, what's the use trying to talk reasonably to either of you! Tarb, come back to my office with me.\"  She could not refuse and so she followed. Miss Snow, torn between curiosity and the scripto, hesitated and then made after them.  \"I've decided to take you off the column--for this morning, anyway--and send you on an outside assignment,\" Stet told Tarb. \"The consul's wife is coming to Earth today. Once she heard there was another woman on Terra, nothing could stop her. Consul seems to think it's my fault, too,\" he added moodily. \"Won't believe I had nothing to do with hiring you. I told the Home Office not to send a woman, that she'd disrupt the office, and you sure as hell have.\"  \"But I thought you said in your letters that you were doing everything in your power to bring Fizbian womenfolk to their men on Terra!\" Tarb pointed out malevolently.  \"Yes,\" he confessed. \"We must please our readers. You know that. Anyway, all that's irrelevant right now. What I want you to do is go meet the consul's wife. Nice touch, having the only other Fizbian woman here be the one to interview her. Human interest angle for the Terrestrial papers. Shouldn't be surprised if Solar Press picked it up--they like items of that kind for fillers. Take Griblo along with you and make sure he has film in his camera this time.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" Tarb said. \"Anything you say, sir.\"  He pretended not to notice her sarcasm. \"I have a list of the questions you should ask her.\" He fixed her with his eye. \"You stick to them, do you hear me? I don't want anything controversial.\" He rummaged among the papers on his desk. \"I know I had it half an hour ago. Sit down, will you, Tarb? Stop hopping around.\"  \"If I can't have a perch, I want a stool,\" Tarb said. \"This is a private office and I think it's a gross affectation for you to have those silly, uncomfortable chairs in it.\"  \"If you would have your wings clipped like Mr. Zarnon's--\" Miss Snow began before Stet could stop her.  \"Stet, you _didn't_!\"  His crest thrashed back and forth. \"They'll grow back again and it's so much more convenient this way. After all, I can't use them here and I do have to associate with Terrestrials and use their equipment. The consul has had his wings clipped also and so have several of our more prominent industrialists--\"  \"Oh, _Stet_!\" Tarb wailed. \"I was beginning to think some pretty hard things about you, but I wouldn't ever have dreamed you'd do anything as awful as that!\"  \"Why should I have to apologize to you?\" he raged."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31644"],["title","Helpfully Yours (#6)"],["body"," \"Who do you think you are, anyway? You're an incompetent little fool. I should have fired you that first day. I've let you get away with so much only because you have a pretty face. You've only been on Earth a couple of months; how can you presume to think you know what's good and what's bad for the Fizbians here?\"  \"I may not know what's good,\" she retorted, \"but I certainly do know what's bad. And that's you, Stet--you and everything you stand for. You not only don't have the courage of your convictions, you don't even have any convictions. You're ashamed of being a Fizbian, ashamed of anything that makes Fizbians different from Terrestrials, even if it's something better, something that most Terrans would like to have. You're a damned hypocrite, Stet Zarnon, that's what you are--professing to help our people when actually you're hurting them by trying to force them into the mold of an alien species.\"  She brushed back her crest. \"I take it I'm fired,\" she said more quietly. \"Do you want me to interview the consul's wife first or leave right away?\"  It took Stet a moment to bring his voice under control. \"Interview her first. We'll talk this over when you get back.\"         *       *       *       *       *  It was pleasant to be away from the office, she thought as the taxi pulled toward the airfield, and doing wingwork again, even if it proved to be the first and last time on this planet. Griblo sat hunched in a corner of the seat, too preoccupied with the camera, which, even after two years, he hadn't fully mastered, to pay attention to her.  Outside, it was raining, the kind of thin drizzle that, on Fizbus or Earth, could go on for days. Tarb had brought along the native umbrella she had purchased in the hotel gift shop--a delightful contraption that was supposed to keep off the rain and didn't, and was supposed to collapse and did, but at the wrong moments. She planned to take it back with her when she returned to Fizbus. Approved souvenir or not, it was the same beautiful purple as her eyes. And, besides, who had made the ruling about approved souvenirs? Stet, of course.  \"No reason why we couldn't have autofax brought from Home,\" Griblo suddenly grumbled.  Tarb pulled herself back from her thoughts. \"I suppose Stet wouldn't let you,\" she said. \"But now that one scripto's here,\" she went on somewhat complacently, \"he'll have to--\"  \"Keep this planet charming and unspoiled, he says,\" Griblo interrupted ungratefully. \"Its spiritual values will be corrupted by too much contact with a crass advanced technology. And, of course, he's got the local camera manufacturers solidly behind him. I wonder whether they advertise in the _Times_ because he helps keep autofax off Terra or whether he keeps the autofax off Terra because they advertise in the _Times_.\"  \"But what does he care about advertising? He may talk as if he owned the _Times_, but he doesn't.\"  Griblo gave a nasty laugh. \"No, he doesn't, but if the Terran edition didn't show a profit, it'd fold quicker than you can flip your wings and he'd have to go back to nasty old up-to-date Fizbus as a lowly sub-editor. And he wouldn't like that one bit. Our Stet, as you may have noticed, is fond of running things to suit himself.\"  \"But Mr. Grupe told me that the _Times_ isn't interested in money. It's running this edition of the paper only as a service to--oh, I suppose all that was a lot of birdseed, too!\"  \"Grupe!\" Griblo snorted. \"The sanctimonious old buzzard! He's a big stockholder on the paper. Bet you didn't know that, did you? All they're out for is money. Fizbian money, Terrestrial money--so long as it's cash.\"  \"Tell me, Griblo,\" Tarb asked, \"what does 'When in Rome, do as the Romans do' mean?\"  Griblo grinned sourly. \"Stet's favorite motto.\" He moved along the seat closer to her. \"I'll tell you what it means, chicken. When on Earth, don't be a Fizbian.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The consul's wife, an old mauve creature, did not seem overpleased to see Tarb, since the younger, prettier Fizbian definitely took the spotlight away from her. The press had, of course, seen Tarb before, but at that time they hadn't been able to communicate directly with her and they didn't, she now found out, think nearly as much of Stet as he did of them.  Tarb couldn't attempt to deviate much from Stet's questions, for the consul's wife was not very cooperative and the consul himself watched both women narrowly. He was a good friend of Stet's, Tarb knew, and apparently Stet had taken the other man into his confidence.  When the interviews were over and the consular party had left, Tarb remained to chat with the Terrestrial journalists. Despite Griblo's worried objections, she joined them in the Moonfield Restaurant, where she daringly partook of a cup of coffee and then another and another.  After that, things weren't very clear. She dimly remembered the other reporters assuring her that she shouldn't disfigure her lovely wings with a stole ... and then pirouetting in the air over the bar to prolonged applause ... and then she was in the taxi again with Griblo shaking her.  \"Wake up, Tarb--we're almost at the office! Stet'll have me plucked for this!\"  Tarb sat up and pushed her crest out of her eyes. The sky was growing dark. They must have been gone a long time.  \"I'll never hear the end of this,\" Griblo moaned. \"Why, if only he could get someone to fill my place, Stet would fire me like a shot! Not that I wouldn't quit if I could get another job.\"  \"Oh, it'll be mostly me he'll be mad at.\" Tarb pulled out her compact. Stet had warned her not to polish her eyeballs in public, but the ground with him! Her head hurt. And her feathers, she saw in the mirror, had turned almost beige. She looked horrible. She felt horrible. And Stet would probably think she was horrible.  \"When Stet's mad,\" Griblo prophesied darkly, \"he's mad at _everybody_!\"  And Stet _was_ mad. He was waiting in the newsroom, his emerald-blue eyes blazing as if he had not only polished but lacquered them.  \"What's the idea of taking six hours to cover a simple story!\" he shouted as soon as the door began to open. \"Aside from the trivial matter of a deadline to be met--Griblo, _where's Tarb_? Nothing's happened to her, has it?\"  \"Naaah,\" Griblo said, unslinging his camera. \"She took a short cut, only she got held up by a terrace. Snagged her umbrella on it, I believe. I heard her yelling when I was waiting for the elevator; I didn't know nice girls knew language like that. She should be up any minute now.... There she is.\"  He pointed to a window, through which the lissome form of the young feature writer could be seen, tapping on the glass in order to attract attention.  [Illustration]  \"Somebody better open it for her,\" the cameraman suggested. \"Probably not meant to open from the outside. Not many people come in that way, I guess.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Open-mouthed, the whole newsroom stared at the window. Finally the Copy Editor got up and let a dripping Tarb in.  \"Nearly thought I wouldn't make it,\" she observed, shaking herself in a flurry of wet pink feathers. The rest of the staff ducked, most of them too late. \"Umbrella didn't do much good,\" she continued, closing it. It left a little puddle on the rug. \"My wings got soaked right away.\" She tossed her wet crest out of her eyes. \"Golly, but it's good to fly again. Haven't done it for months, but it seems like years.\" Her eye caught Miss Snow's. \"You don't know what you're missing!\"  \"Tarb,\" Stet thundered, \"you've been drinking coffee! _Griblo!_\" But the cameraman had nimbly sought sanctuary in the dark-room.  \"You'd better go home, Tarb.\" When Stet's eye tufts met across his nose, he was downright ugly, she realized. \"Griblo can give me the dope and I'll write up the story myself. I can fill it out with canned copy. And you and I will discuss this situation in the morning.\"  \"Won't go home when there's work to be done. Duty calls me.\" Giving a brief and quite recognizable imitation of a Terrestrial trumpet, Tarb stalked down the corridor to her office.  Drosmig looked up from his perch, to which he was still miraculously clinging at that hour. \"So it got you, too?... Sorry ... nice girl.\"  \"It hasn't got me,\" Tarb replied, picking up a letter marked _Urgent_. \"I've got it.\" She scanned the letter, then made hastily for Stet's office.  He sat drumming on his desk with the antique stainless steel spatula he used as a paperknife.  \"Read this!\" she demanded, thrusting the letter into his face. \"Read this, you traitor--sacrificing our whole civilization to what's most expedient for you! Hypocrite! Cad!\"  \"Tarb, listen to me! I'm--\"  \"Read it!\" She slapped the letter down in front of him. \"Read it and see what you've done to us! Sure, we Fizbians keep to ourselves and so the only people who know anything about us are the ones who want to sell us brushes, while the people who want to help us don't know a damn thing about us and--\"  \"Oh, all right! I'll read it if you'll only keep quiet!\" He turned the letter right-side up.       _Johannesburg_       _Dear Senbot Drosmig:_       _I represent the Dzoglian Publishing Company, Inc., of which I know      you have heard, since your paper has seen fit to give our books      some of the most unjust reviews on record. However, be that as it      may, I have opened an office on Earth with the laudable purpose of      effecting an interchange of respective literatures, to see which      Terrestrial books might most profitably be translated into Fizbian,      and which of the authors on our own list might have potential      appeal for the Earth reader._       _Dealing with authors is, of course, a nerve-racking business and I      soon found myself in dire need of mental treatment. What was my      horror to find that this primitive, although charming, planet had      no neurotones, no psychoscopes, not even any cerebrophones--in      fact, no psychiatric machines at all!"]]]
