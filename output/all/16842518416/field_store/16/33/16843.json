Wherever he went his books went with him; in his carriage, in his gardens they never left his side.  He betrays, moreover, a taste for the beauties of nature which is distinctly un-Roman.  Even the Roman poets were almost utterly oblivious to the charms of scenery.  When Horace points out of the window to the snow lying deep on Soracte, it is not to emphasise the beauty of the scene, but a preliminary to telling the boy to pile the logs of Algidus upon the fire.  Even Virgil, who occasionally paints a bit of landscape or seascape in the Aeneid, does so in a half-hearted fashion, as a mere preface to the incident which is to follow, not from a poet's love of beauty.  In Pliny, on the other hand, we find the modern love for a beautiful view.  Me nihil aeque ac natura opera delectant.  When he describes his Tuscan villa he uses language with which we feel in complete harmony.  He specifies the places from which the best views may be obtained; and if the garden seems to our taste to have been laid out in rather a formal way, with its box-trees cut into different shapes of animals and birds, he was in that respect only following the fashion of his day, and his delight in the unadorned beauties of the surrounding country has a genuine ring in it.  In another curious respect Pliny was ahead of his times.  He had no taste for the Circensian games and the brutalities of the gladiatorial shows.  Writing to Sempronius Rufus (iv. 22), he bluntly declares that he wishes they could be abolished in Rome, inasmuch as they degrade the character and morals of the whole world. In another passage (ix. 6) he says that the Circensian games have not the smallest attraction for him--ne levissime quidem teneor.  He cannot understand why so many thousands of grown-up people take such a childish pleasure in watching horses running races.  It is not the speed of the horses or the skill of the drivers which is the attraction,--if it were, there might be some reason for their enthusiasm,--what they go to see is the victory of their pet racing colours, the triumph of the reds, blues, or greens.  Favent panno, pannum amant.  We find him writing on all manner of subjects.  He asks his scientific friends to explain to him the mystery of a spring whose waters ebb and flow, of a lake which contained floating islands, and in one letter he tells a fascinating ghost story of quite the conventional type, about a haunted house, which drove any unwary tenant crazy, and the ghost of a murdered man which walked with clanking chains.  Pliny was no cut and dried philosopher.  Like his master Cicero he was an eclectic, and pinned his faith to no single creed.  Whatever was human interested him, and on whatever interested him he put pen to paper.  It need scarcely be said how valuable these letters are in filling up the gaps of Roman history.  We have to thank Pliny for our knowledge of the great eruption of Vesuvius which overwhelmed Pompeii and Herculaneum, and it was probably only due to the accident that the elder Pliny was one of the victims that we possess the two striking letters in which the disaster is described.  In another letter our author describes how the Emperor Trajan sent for him and others to his country seat at Centum Cellae, to help him to try certain important cases, and then he tells us of the modest, simple living of Trajan--Suavitas simplicitasque convictus--and the presents he gave them on their departure.  The debates in the Senate, the trials in the Court of the Hundred, the public readings in the city, which--first introduced by Asinius Pollio in the time of Augustus--were then the fashion,--of all these Pliny gives us a clear presentment.  His charity is hardly ever at fault.  Only when he writes of Regulus and Pallas does he dip his pen in gall.  But Regulus had been his bitter enemy and an informer, and the memory of Pallas was justly execrated.  A few words may be added respecting the letters which form the Tenth Book of his correspondence, and which show us Pliny acting as Governor of the province of Pontus and Bithynia.  He had been sent there because the finances of many of the cities had been allowed to fall into a shocking state, and because the Emperor wanted a man whom he could thoroughly trust to put them straight.  No doubt Pliny, while flattered at this proof of Trajan's regard, felt the severance from his friends and ordinary pursuits which this term of absence necessitated.  But compare his attitude with that of Cicero as Governor of Cilicia!  Cicero crawled on the outward journey, and when he reached his destination he counted the days to his return like a bullied school-boy counts the days to the end of the term.  He writes to his friends in the capital, begging and praying of them that they will prevent his being obliged to stay for a second year.  All his thoughts are of Rome and how to return there.  The wretched provincials bore him to distraction; he yearns for the wider arena of the capital in which to play the swelling part to which he aspires.  There is, in short, not a trace in Cicero's letters from his province to show that he took the slightest interest in his new surroundings.  Pliny displays a far different spirit.  He reminds us more of the Colonial Governor of our own day.  He is interested in the past history and traditions of the country, he is anxious that the cities shall have good water supplies, good baths, good theatres, good gymnasia.  He is for ever suggesting to the Emperor that he should send architects to consult with him on some important public work.  And these letters disclose to us what a wonderful system of organised government the Roman Empire possessed.  Pliny even writes to Trajan to ask permission that an evil-smelling sewer may be covered over in a town called Amastria.  If all the governors of the provinces wrote home for orders on such points, the Emperor must indeed have been busy, and some of his replies to Pliny show that Trajan hinted very plainly that a governor ought to have some initiative of his own.  None the less, the tenour of this correspondence proves that Trajan held the threads of government very jealously in his own hands.  When Pliny suggested the establishment of a small fire-brigade in Nicomedia, where the citizens had stood enjoying the aesthetic beauty of a disastrous fire which destroyed whole streets, instead of putting it out, Trajan sharply vetoed the suggestion, on the ground that the Greeks were factious people and would turn even a fire-brigade to illicit and seditious purposes.  There is, of course, one letter to Trajan which has achieved world-wide fame, that in which he asks the Emperor how he wishes him to deal with the Christians who were brought before him and refused to worship the statues of the Emperor and the gods.  So much has been written upon this subject that it is almost superfluous to add more.  Yet it may be pointed out that the letter only confirms our estimate of the kindliness and scrupulous justice of Pliny.  He acquits the Christians of all criminal practices; he bears testimony to the purity of their lives and their principles.  What baffles and vexes him is their \"pertinacity and inflexible obstinacy\"--Neque enim dubitabam, qualecunque esset quod fateretur, pertinaciam certe et inflexibilem obstinationem debere puniri.  He could not understand, in other words, why, when the theory of the Roman religion was so tolerant, the Christians should be so intolerantly narrow-minded and bigoted.  As we have said, Pliny was an eclectic, and an eclectic is the last person to understand the frame of mind which glories in martyrdom.  Such was Pliny's attitude towards the purely religious side of the question, but that, after all, was not the main issue.  With him, as the representative of the Roman Emperor, the crime of the Christians lay not so much in their refusal to worship the statues of Jupiter and the heavenly host of the Pagan mythology, as in their refusal to worship the statue of the Emperor.  Church and State have never been so closely identified in any form of government as in that of the early Roman Empire.  The genius of the Emperor was the genius of the Empire; to refuse to sprinkle a few grains of incense on the ara of Trajan was an act of gross political treason to the best of rulers.  No wonder, therefore, that Pliny felt constrained to punish these harmless members of a sect which he could not understand. Trajan's reply is equally clear and distinct.  He discountenanced all inquisition and persecution.  The Christians are not to be hunted down, no notice is to be taken of anonymous accusations, and if any suspected person renounces his error and offers prayers publicly to the gods of Rome, no further action is to be taken against him.  On the other hand, if the case is proved and the accused still remains obstinate, punishment must follow and the law be maintained.  Pliny evidently thought that if the Christians were given a chance of renouncing their past folly the growth of the new religion would be checked.  He speaks of a certain revival of the old religion, of the temples once more being thronged by worshippers, and the sacrificial victims again finding buyers, though almost in the same sentence he describes \"the contagion of the Christian superstition\" as having spread not only in the towns but into the villages and rural districts.  He did not foresee that in process of time a Roman Emperor would himself embrace the new faith and persecute the upholders of the old with the same vigour as was in his day applied to the repression of the new.  J.B. FIRTH.    THE LETTERS OF THE YOUNGER PLINY.   BOOK I.   1.I.--TO SEPTICIUS.  You have constantly urged me to collect and publish the more highly finished of the letters that I may have written.  I have made such a collection, but without preserving the order in which they were composed, as I was not"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3234"],["title","The Letters of the Younger Pliny, First Series — Volume 1 (#4)"],["body"," a historical narrative.  So I have taken them as they happened to come to hand.  I can only hope that you will not have cause to regret the advice you gave, and that I shall not repent having followed it; for I shall set to work to recover such letters as have up to now been tossed on one side, and I shall not keep back any that I may write in the future.  Farewell.   1.II.--TO ARRIANUS.  As I see that your arrival is likely to be later than I expected, I forward you the speech which I promised in an earlier letter.  I beg that you will read and revise it as you have done with other compositions of mine, because I think none of my previous works is written in quite the same style.  I have tried to imitate, at least in manner and turns of phrase, your old favourite, Demosthenes, and Calvus, to whom I have recently taken a great fancy; for to catch the fire and power of such acknowledged stylists is only given to the heaven-inspired few.  I hope you will not think me conceited if I say that the subject- matter was not unworthy of such imitation, for throughout the whole argument I found something that kept rousing me from my sleepy and confirmed indolence, that is to say, as far as a person of my temperament can be roused.  Not that I abjured altogether the pigments of our master Cicero; when an opportunity arose for a pleasant little excursion from the main path of my argument I availed myself of it, as my object was to be terse without being unnecessarily dry.  Nor must you think that I am apologising for these few passages.  For just to make your eye for faults the keener, I will confess that both my friends here and myself have no fear of publishing the speech, if you will but set your mark of approval against the passages that possibly show my folly. I must publish something, and I only hope that the best thing for the purpose may be this volume which is ready finished.  That is the prayer of a lazy man, is it not? but there are several reasons why I must publish, and the strongest is that the various copies I have lent out are said to still find readers, though by this time they have lost the charm of novelty.  Of course, it may be that the booksellers say this to flatter me.  Well, let them flatter, so long as fibs of this kind encourage me to study the harder.  Farewell.   1.III.--TO CANINIUS RUFUS.  How is Comum looking, your darling spot and mine?  And that most charming villa of yours, what of it, and its portico where it is always spring, its shady clumps of plane trees, its fresh crystal canal, and the lake below that gives such a charming view?  How is the exercise ground, so soft yet firm to the foot; how goes the bath that gets the sun's rays so plentifully as he journeys round it?  What too of the big banqueting halls and the little rooms just for a few, and the retiring rooms for night and day?  Have they full possession of you, and do they share your company in turn? or are you, as usual, continually being called away to attend to private family business?  You are indeed a lucky man if you can spend all your leisure there; if you cannot, your case is that of most of us.  But really it is time that you passed on your unimportant and petty duties for others to look after, and buried yourself among your books in that secluded yet beautiful retreat.  Make this at once the business and the leisure of your life, your occupation and your rest; let your waking hours be spent among your books, and your hours of sleep as well.  Mould something, hammer out something that shall be known as yours for all time.  Your other property will find a succession of heirs when you are gone; what I speak of will continue yours for ever--if once it begins to be.  I know the capacity and inventive wit that I am spurring on.  You have only to think of yourself as the able man others will think you when you have realised your ability.  Farewell.   1.IV.--TO POMPEIA CELERINA.  What treasures you have in your villas at Ocriculum, at Narnia, at Carsola and Perusia!  Even a bathing place at Narnia!  My letters--for now there is no need for you to write--will have shown you how pleased I am, or rather the short letter will which I wrote long ago.  The fact is, that some of my own property is scarcely so completely mine as is some of yours; the only difference being that I get more thoroughly and attentively looked after by your servants than I do by my own.  You will very likely find the same thing yourself when you come to stay in one of my villas.  I hope you will, in the first place that you may get as much pleasure out of what belongs to me as I have from what belongs to you, and in the second that my people may be roused a little to a sense of their duties.  I find them rather remiss in their behaviour and almost careless.  But that is their way; if they have a considerate master, their fear of him grows less and less as they get to know him, while a new face sharpens their attention and they study to gain their master's good opinion, not by looking after his wants but those of his guests. Farewell.   1.V.--TO VOCONIUS ROMANUS.  Did you ever see a man more abject and fawning than Marcus Regulus has been since the death of Domitian?  His misdeeds were better concealed during that prince's reign, but they were every bit as bad as they were in the time of Nero.  He began to be afraid that I was angry with him and he was not mistaken, for I certainly was annoyed.  After doing what he could to help those who were compassing the ruin of Rusticus Arulenus, he had openly exulted at his death, and went so far as to publicly read and then publish a pamphlet in which he violently attacks Rusticus and even calls him \"the Stoics' ape,\" adding that \"he is marked with the brand of Vitellius.\"  You recognise, of course, the Regulian style!  He tears to pieces Herennius Senecio so savagely that Metius Carus said to him, \"What have you to do with my dead men?  Did I ever worry your Crassus or Camerinus?\"--these being some of Regulus's victims in the days of Nero.  Regulus thought I bore him malice for this, and so he did not invite me when he read his pamphlet.  Besides, he remembered that he once mortally attacked me in the Court of the Centumviri.  I was a witness on behalf of Arionilla, the wife of Timon, at the request of Rusticus Arulenus, and Regulus was conducting the prosecution.  We on our side were relying for part of the defence on a decision of Metius Modestus, an excellent man who had been banished by Domitian and was at that moment in exile.  This was Regulus's opportunity.  \"Tell me, Secundus,\" said he, \"what you think of Modestus.\"  You see in what peril I should have placed myself if I had answered that I thought highly of him, and how disgraceful it would have been if I had said that I thought ill of him.  I fancy it must have been the gods who came to my rescue.  \"I will tell you what I think of him,\" I said, \"when the Court has to give a decision on the point.\"  He returned to the charge:  \"My question is, what do you think of Modestus?\"  Again I replied:  \"Witnesses used to be interrogated about persons in the dock, not about those who are already convicted.\"  A third time he asked:  \"Well, I won't ask you now what you think of Modestus, but what you think of his loyalty.\"  \"You ask me,\" said I, \"for my opinion.  But I do not think it is in order for you to ask an opinion on what the Court has already passed judgment.\"  He was silenced, while I was congratulated and praised for not having smirched my reputation by giving an answer that might have been discreet but would certainly have been dishonest, and for not having entangled myself in the meshes of such a crafty question.  Well, now the fellow is conscience-stricken, and buttonholes first Caecilius Celer and then implores Fabius Justsus to reconcile me to him. Not content with that, he makes his way in to see Spurinna, and begs and prays of him--you know what an abject coward he is when he is frightened--as follows.  \"Do go,\" says he, \"and call on Pliny in the morning--early in the morning, for my suspense is unbearable--and do what you can to remove his anger against me.\"  I was early awake that day, when a message came from Spurinna, \"I am coming to see you.\"  I sent back word, \"I will come and see you.\"  We met at the portico of Livia, just as we were each of us on the way to see the other.  He explained his commission from Regulus and added his own entreaties, but did not press the point too strongly, as became a worthy gentleman asking a favour for a worthless acquaintance.  This was my answer: \"Well, you must see for yourself what message you think best to take back to Regulus; I should not like you to be under any misapprehension. I am waiting till Mauricus returns\"--he had not yet returned from exile- -\"and so I cannot give you an answer either way, for I shall do just what he thinks best.  It is he who is principally interested in this matter, I am only secondarily concerned.\"  A few days afterwards Regulus himself met me when I was paying my respects to the new praetor.  He followed me thither and asked for a private conversation.  He said he was afraid that something he once said in the Court of the Centumviri rankled in my memory, when, in replying to Satrius Rufus and myself, he remarked, \"Satrius Rufus, who is quite content with the eloquence of our days, and does not seek to rival Cicero.\"  I told him that as I had his own confession for it I could now see that the remark was a spiteful one, but that it was quite possible to put a complimentary construction upon it.  \"For,\" said I, \"I do try to rival Cicero, and I am not content with the eloquence of our own time.  I think it is very stupid not to take as models the very best masters.  But how is it that you remember this case and forget the other one in which you asked me what I thought of the loyalty of Metius Modestus?\"  As you know, he is always pale, but he grew perceptibly paler at this"]]]
