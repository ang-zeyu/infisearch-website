But eating them wouldn't really be cannibalism. They aren't people._  _That premise works both ways, dear lady_, Jrann-Pttt ideated. _And I must say your species will prove far easier to peel for the cooking pot._  \"Monster! What are you doing?\" Mortland dropped his twigs and pulled the mosquito-bat away from a bush. \"Don't eat those berries, you silly ass; the bush won't like it!\" The mosquito-bat piped wrathfully.  Jrann-Pttt probed with intentness. \"You know, I rather think the bush wants its berries to be eaten. Something to do with--er--propagating itself. Of course it has a false impression as to what is going to be done with the berries, but the important fact is that it won't put up any resistance.\"  \"All right, old fellow.\" Mortland released the mosquito-bat, which promptly flew back to the bush. \"I'm not the custodian of your morals.\"  \"I wonder whether we could eat those berries, too,\" Professor Bernardi remarked pensively.  \"Carl!\" Mrs. Bernardi's tear-stained face flushed pink. \"Why--why, that's almost indecent!\"  \"We eat beans, don't we?\" Mortland pointed out. \"They're seeds.\"  \"We also eat meat,\" Miss Anspacher added.  There was silence. \"I imagine,\" Mrs. Bernardi murmured, \"it's because we never get to meet the meat socially.\" She avoided the saurians' eyes.  \"We'd better see how Monster makes out, though,\" Miss Anspacher observed, replenishing her lipstick, \"before we try the berries ourselves. The fact that the bush is anxious to dispose of them doesn't mean they can't be poisonous.\"  \"Why should Monster sacrifice himself for us?\" Mortland retorted hotly, overlooking the fact that Monster's purpose in eating the berries was almost certainly not an altruistic one. \"If we can risk his life, we can risk our own.\" He crammed a handful of berries into his mouth defiantly. \"I say, they're good!\"  Algol sniffed the bush with disgust, then turned away.  \"See?\" said Miss Anspacher. \"They're undoubtedly poisonous. When he's really hungry, he isn't so fussy.\" She combed her hair.  \"But is he really hungry?\" Bernardi asked suspiciously. \"Come here, Algol. Nice kitty.\" He bent down and sniffed the cat's breath. The cat sniffed his interestedly. Their whiskers touched. \"I thought so. Fish!\"  \"You mean,\" Mrs. Bernardi shrieked, \"that while we were struggling through that water, alternately starving and drowning by centimeters, that wretched cat has not only been walking along here dry as toast, but gorging himself on fish?\"  \"Now, now, Mrs. Bernardi,\" Jrann-Pttt said. \"Being a dumb animal, he wouldn't think of informing you about matters of which he'd assume that you, as the superior beings, would be fully cognizant.\"  \"You might have told us there were fish on this planet, Mr. Pitt.\"  \"Dear lady, there is something I feel I should tell you. I am not--\"  \"They're here on the other side of the ridge,\" Greenfield called, bending over and peering through the foliage. \"The fish, I mean.\"  \"The pools look shallow,\" Bernardi said, also bending over. \"The fish should be easy enough to catch. Might even be able to get them in our hands.\" He reached out to demonstrate, proving the error of both his theses, for the fish slipped right through his fingers and, as he grabbed for them, he lost his balance, toppled over the side of the ridge into the mud and water below and began to disappear, showing beyond a doubt that the pools were deeper than he had thought.  \"Carl, what are you doing?\" Mrs. Bernardi peered into the murky depths where her husband was threshing about. \"Why don't you come out of that filthy mud?\"  His voice, though muffled, was still acid. \"It isn't mud, my dear. It's quicksand!\"  \"Rope!\" the captain exclaimed, grabbing a coil.  \"Hold on, chaps!\" cried a squeaky voice. \"I'm coming to the rescue!\" A stout twelve-foot vine plunged out of the shadows and wrapped one end of itself around a tree--disregarding the latter's violent objections--and the other end around Professor Bernardi's thorax, which was just disappearing into the mud. \"Now if one or two of you would haul away, we'll soon have him out all shipshape and proper. Heave ho! Don't be afraid of hurting me; my strength is as the strength of ten because my heart is pure.\"  \"It's that vine!\" Dfar-Lll exclaimed. \"So that's what has been following us all along!\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"I can accept the idea of a vegetable thinking,\" Professor Bernardi gasped as he was pulled out of the quicksand, \"although with the utmost reluctance.\" He shook himself like a dog. \"But how can it be mobile?\"  \"You chaps can move around,\" the vine explained, \"so I said to myself: 'Dammit, I'll have a shot at doing that, too.' Hard going at first, when you're using suckers, but I persevered and I made it. Look, I can talk, too. Never heard of a vine doing that before, did you? Fact is, I hadn't thought of it before, but then I never had anyone to communicate with. All those other vines are so stupid; you have absolutely no idea! Hope you don't mind my picking up your language, but it was the only one around--\"  \"We are honored,\" Professor Bernardi declared. \"And I am deeply grateful to you, too, sir or madam, for saving my life.\"  \"Think nothing of it,\" the vine said, arranging its leaves, which were of a pleasing celadon rather than the whitish-green favored by the rest of the local vegetation. \"Now that I can move, I'll probably be doing heroic things like that all the time. Are you all going to the city? May I go with you? I've heard lots about the city,\" it went on, taking consent for granted, \"but I never thought I'd get to see it. Everybody in the swamp is such an old stick-in-the-mud. I thought I was trapped, too, forced to spend the rest of my life in a provincial environment. Is it true that the streets are filled with chlorophyll? Do you think I can get a job in a botanical garden or something? Perhaps I can give little talks on horticulture to visitors?\"  The mosquito-bat looked out of the tea kettle austerely. \"Monster!\" it piped shrilly.  \"The very idea!\" the vine snapped back indignantly. \"Oh, well,\" it said, calming down, \"you probably don't know any better. It's up to me as the intelligent life-form to forgive you, and I shall.\"  Jrann-Pttt and Dfar-Lll looked at each other in consternation. _Do you think there really are cities on this planet, sir? Can there be indigenous intelligent life? If so, it may have already got in touch with the commandant._  _Impossible_, Jrann-Pttt replied. _The vine probably just heard us talking about a city. After all, it picked up the language that way; very likely it absorbed some terrestrial concepts along with it. If there are any real settlements at all, they must be quite primitive--nothing more than villages. No, it's we who will build the cities on Venus. Combining our technology with the terrestrials', we could develop a pretty little civilization here--after we've disposed of the commandant, so he can't report our disappearance. We don't want any publicity. So much better to keep our little society exclusive._         *       *       *       *       *  \"Wonder what time it is,\" the captain remarked as he rose and stretched in the dim yellow light of the long Venusian day. \"Must have slept for hours. My watch seems to have stopped.\"  \"Mine, too.\" Mortland unstrapped his from his wrist and shook it futilely. \"Waterproof, hah! If we ever get back to Earth, I shall make the manufacturer eat his guarantee.\"  \"Oh, well, what does time matter to us now?\" Professor Bernardi pointed out as he rose from his leafy couch with a loud creak. All of them--even the saurians--had aches and pains in every joint and muscle as a result of the unaccustomed exercise and the damp climate. \"We are out of its reach. It has no present meaning for us.\"  This depressed them all. Only the vine seemed in good health and spirits. \"I notice you're all wearing clothes except for the short four-legged gentleman with the home-grown fur coat,\" it chattered happily. \"Do you think I'll be socially acceptable without them? I wouldn't want to make a bad impression at the very start--or would leaves do?\"  Everybody looked at Jrann-Pttt. \"We are not a narrow-minded species,\" he said hastily. \"I'm sure your leaves will be more than adequate.\"  After a breakfast of fish and berries stewed in tea--which the vine declined with thanks--the various members of the party gathered up their belongings and resumed their journey. Encrusted with dried purple mud and grime, their clothes deliberately torn by anti-social shrubbery, their chins--of the males, that is--disfigured by hirsute growths, the terrestrials made a sorry spectacle. It was hot, boiling hot, and more humid than ever.  \"Well,\" said Miss Anspacher, letting the Swahili marching song with which she had been attempting to encourage the company peter out, \"I do hope we'll reach your city soon, Jrann-Pttt. I must say I could use a hot bath.\" She added hastily, \"Hot baths are a peculiar cultural trait of ours.\"  \"I could use one myself,\" Jrann-Pttt said. He brushed his scales fastidiously.  \"I'm looking forward so to meeting your relatives,\" she said, grabbing his left arm determinedly. \"I'm not violating a taboo or anything, am I?\" _It isn't really slimy; it just feels that way._  \"Not one of my people's. But I'm afraid you are violating a terrestrial taboo, judging from the thoughts I pick up from your captain's mind.\"  \"Oh, him--he's a stupid fool!\"  \"Not at all. Rough,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31686"],["title","Collector's Item (#6)"],["body","aps. Untutored, yes. But with a good deal of native intelligence, although fearfully primitive.\"  \"Perhaps I was too harsh,\" Miss Anspacher observed thoughtfully. _The captain ... is good-looking in a brutal sort of way, although not nearly as handsome or even as spiritual in appearance as Jrann-Pttt. And sometimes I almost think he_--she blushed to herself--_shows a certain partiality for my company._  She did not, however, let go of the saurian's arm when the captain bustled up, prepared to put a stop to this, but tactfully, if possible, for he had begun to realize that his rude ways did not endear him to her.  \"Ah--we're making very good progress, aren't we, Pitt?\" he interrupted, trying to insinuate himself between the two.  \"Excellent.\"  \"How soon do you think we'll be at your city at this rate?\"  Jrann-Pttt shrugged. \"Since I have no way of telling what our rate is or how far we have gone, how can I tell? As a matter of fact, you might as well learn now as later--I am not a Venusian. There is no intelligent life native to Venus.\"  \"Oh, really!\" the vine interposed indignantly. \"Saying a thing like that right in front of me! What would you call me, then, pray tell?\"  Jrann-Pttt kept his actual thoughts to himself. \"A mutation,\" he said. \"Probably you are the first intelligent life-form to appear upon this planet. Scholarly volumes will be written about you.\"  \"Oh?\" The vine seemed to be appeased. \"I accept your apology. Perhaps I'll learn to write and do the books myself, because I'm the only one who can understand the real me.\"  \"But how can you show us the way to your city if you're not native to Venus?\" Bernardi demanded, whirling fretfully upon the saurian. \"What is this, anyway? Each time you come up with a different story!\"  \"See?\" said the captain. \"Didn't I tell you he was up to no good?\"  \"I should like to lead you to our base,\" Jrann-Pttt replied with quiet dignity. \"I am telling you the truth now since I feel I should have your consent before proceeding farther.\"  ??????? Dfar-Lll projected.  \"I hesitated before, because I wasn't sure I could trust you. You see, the spaceship in which we came to this planet is a prison ship, with a crew consisting of malefactors--thieves, murderers, defrauders--dispatched to the remote fastnesses of the Galaxy to fetch back zoological specimens. Our zoo, I must say, is the finest and most interesting in the Universe.\"  \"Monster!\" the mosquito-bat squeaked.  \"Shhh,\" Mortland admonished. \"Don't interrupt.\"  \"I was in command of our ill-fated expedition....\"  _Oh_, Dfar-Lll projected. _For a moment there, sir, you had me worried._  \"When we reached Venus, I was, I must admit, careless. I gave the crew a chance to mutiny and they did. Slew most of the officers. Dfar-Lll and I were lucky to escape with our lives.\"  \"But you might have told us!\" Mrs. Bernardi's voice held reproach.  \"Until we knew what kind of beings you were, we couldn't let you know how helpless and unprotected we were.\"  The women seemed moved, but not the men.  \"Leading us on a wild goose chase, were you?\" the captain challenged.  Jrann-Pttt drew a deep breath. \"It was my hope that all of you would consent to help us get our ship back from these criminals. Then we could fly to my planet--which is the fifth of the star you know as Alpha Centauri--where, I assure you, you would be hospitably received.\"  _We aren't really going back home, Jrann-Pttt, are we? I'd sooner stay here in the swamp than go back to that jail._  _Have confidence in me, r-Lll. As soon as we have disposed of the commandant and his officers, I can put our ship out of commission. The terrestrials won't be able to tell what's wrong. They know nothing about space travel. The fact that they got their crude vessel to operate was probably sheer luck._  But the younger was not to be diverted. _Will we kill them after we've disposed of our officers? I should hate to._  _Certainly not. We shall need servants and I don't trust the prisoners in the ship--all criminals of the lowest type!_ Aloud, he said to the bewildered terrestrials, \"If you don't want to help us, I shall understand. No sense your interfering in another species' quarrels, particularly as we must seem like monsters to you.\"  \"Monster!\" the mosquito-bat agreed. \"Monster, monster, monster!\" No one tried to stop him. Jrann-Pttt sensed that somehow he had lost a good deal of his grip on the terrestrials. Finesse, he thought angrily, was wasted on these barbaric life-forms.  Bernardi sighed. \"I suppose we'll have to help you.\" _No reason why his ship shouldn't stop off at Earth before it goes to Alpha Centauri. No reason why it should even go to Alpha Centauri at all, in fact._  \"If you ask me,\" the captain said, \"he's one of the criminals himself.\"  \"But nobody asked you,\" Miss Anspacher retorted, the more acidly because she had been wondering the same thing. \"Shall we resume our journey?\"  \"Hold on,\" the vine said. \"I don't want to intrude or anything, but it hasn't been made quite clear to me whether or not I'm included in the invitation to this Alpha Centauri place, and I wouldn't want to keep going only on the off-chance that you might ask me. I really think you should, because you led me astray with your fair promises of glittering cities.\"  \"The cities of our planet do not glitter,\" Jrann-Pttt replied, wishing it would wither instantly, \"but certainly you are invited. Glad to have you.\"  \"Oh, that's awfully decent of you,\" the vine said emotionally. \"I shan't forget it, I promise you.\"         *       *       *       *       *  They plodded onward, the vine chattering so incessantly that a faint gurgling which accompanied them went unnoticed. The gurgling grew louder and louder as they pushed on. Finally, \"I keep hearing water,\" Mortland remarked. \"We must be approaching a river of some kind.\"  A few minutes later, bursting through a screen of underbrush, they found themselves confronted by a river whose bubbling violet-blue waters extended for at least four kilometers from shadowy bank to bank, with the ridge tapering to a point almost in its exact center.  Apparently, while they had been trekking along the elevation, the surrounding terrain, concealed from them by the dense and evil-minded vegetation, had imperceptibly taken off, leaving the ridge to become a peninsula that jutted out into the river. They seemed to be stranded. All they could do was retrace their steps and, since they had no idea how far back the split became part of the mainland again, the return journey might last almost as long as it had taken them to get there.  \"I know we're heading in the right direction,\" Jrann-Pttt defended himself. \"I wasn't aware of the river because we must have come by an overland route.\" Although he was telling the truth, at least insofar as he knew it himself, no one, not even Dfar-Lll, believed him.  \"But let's rest a bit before we turn back,\" Mortland proposed, flopping to the ground. \"I'm utterly used up.\"  \"Maybe we don't need to go back,\" the vine said. \"Not all the way, anyhow.\" Everyone stared. It waved its leaves brightly at them. \"I notice the captain thoughtfully brought along lots of rope and there were scads of fallen logs just a bit back. Couldn't you just lash the logs together with the rope and make a--a thing on which we could float the rest of the way? On the water, you know.\"  The others continued to look at it open-mouthed.  \"Just a little idea I had,\" it said modestly. \"May not amount to much, but then you can't tell until you've tried, can you?\"  \"It--he--means a raft, I think,\" Mrs. Bernardi said.  Jrann-Pttt probed the raft concept in her mind, for he found the vegetable's mental processes curiously obscure. \"What an excellent idea!\" he exclaimed.  \"It does not seem infeasible,\" Professor Bernardi admitted tightly. By now, he was suspicious of everyone and everything. _If I had never broached the idea of space travel to those peasants_, he thought, _I would be on Earth in the dubious comfort of my own home. That's what comes of trying to help humanity._         *       *       *       *       *  \"Well,\" observed the captain as the heavy raft hit the water with a tremendous splash, \"she seems to be riverworthy.\" He rubbed his hands in anticipation, much of his surliness gone, now that he was about to deal with something he understood. \"Since she is, in a manner of speaking, a ship, I suppose I assume command again?\" He waited for objections, glancing involuntarily in Jrann-Pttt's direction. There were none. \"Right,\" he said, repressing any outward symptoms of relief.  He efficiently deployed the personnel to the positions on the raft where he felt they might be least useless, the gear being piled in the middle and surmounted by Algol, who naturally assumed possession of the softest and safest place by the divine right of cats.  _The captain does have a commanding presence_, Miss Anspacher thought, _and a sort of uncouth grace. Moreover, he cannot read my mind--in fact, he often cannot even understand me when I speak._  \"All right!\" he bellowed. \"Cast off!\"  The vine unfastened the rope that it had insouciantly attached to a tree trunk, remarking to the others, \"Don't let the trees intimidate you. Actually their bark is worse than their bite.\" Now it dropped lithely on board the raft, looking for a comfortable resting place.  \"Please don't twine around me,\" Miss Anspacher said coldly. \"If you insist upon coming with us, you will have to choose an inanimate object to cling to.\"  \"All right, all right,\" it tried to soothe her. \"No need to get yourself all worked up over such a mere triviality, is there? I'll just coil myself tidily around one of those spare logs. I must say you're warmer, though.\"  _Yes, she is, isn't she?_ thought the captain, and squeezed her hand.         *       *       *       *       *  The raft drifted down the river. Since the current was flowing in the desired direction, there did not appear to be any need to use the poles,"]]]
