It is a combination lock, with five million possible combinations. Do you want to be here for all of eternity?\"  \"No.\"  \"Then quiet.\"  Vaguely, Temple wondered why the door wasn't guarded.  \"With a lock like this,\" Arkalion explained, as if he had read Temple's thought, \"they need no other precaution. It is assumed that only authorized personnel know the combination.\"  Then had Arkalion come this way before? It seemed the only possible assumption. But when? And how? \"Here we are,\" said Arkalion.  The door swung in toward them.  Temple strode forward, found himself in a great bare hall, surprisingly well-lighted. After the dimness of the caverns, he hardly could see.  \"Don't stand there scowling and fussing with your eyes. There is one additional precaution--an alarm at Central Headquarters. We have about five minutes, no more.\"         *       *       *       *       *  At one end of the bare hall stood what to Temple looked for all the world like an old-fashioned telephone booth, except that its walls were completely opaque. On the wall adjacent to it was a single lever with two positions marked \"hold\" and \"transport\". The lever stood firmly in the \"hold\" position.  \"You sure you want to come?\" Arkalion demanded.  \"Yes, I told you that.\"  \"Good. I have no time to explain. I will enter the conveyor.\"  \"Conveyor?\"  \"This booth. You will wait until the door is shut, then pull the lever down. That is all there is to it, but, as you can see, it is a two-man operation.\"  \"But how do I--\"  \"Haste, haste! There are similar controls at the other end. You pull the lever, wait two minutes, enter the conveyor yourself. I will fetch you--if you are sure.\"  \"I'm sure, dammit!\"  \"Remember, you go without training, without the opportunity everyone else has.\"  \"You already told me that. Mars is half-way to eternity. Mars is limbo. If I can't go back to Earth I want to go--well, to Nowhere. There are too many ghosts here, too many memories with nothing to do.\"  Arkalion shrugged, entered the booth. \"Pull the lever,\" he said, and shut the door.  Temple reached up, grasped the lever firmly in his hand, yanked it. It slid smoothly to the position marked \"transport.\" Temple heard nothing, saw nothing, began to think the device, whatever it was, did not work. Did Arkalion somehow get _moved_ inside the booth?  Temple thought he heard footfalls on the stairs outside. Soon, faintly, he could hear voices. Someone banged on the door to the hall. Licking dry lips, Temple opened the booth, peered inside.  Empty.  The voices clamored, fists pounded on the door. Something clicked. Tumblers fell. The door to the great, bright hall sprung outward. Someone rushed in at Temple, who met him savagely with a short, chopping blow to his jaw. The man, temporarily blinded by the dazzling light, stumbled back in the path of his fellows.  Temple darted into the booth, the conveyor, and slammed it shut.  Fingers clawed on the outside.  A sound almost too intense to be heard rang in Temple's ears. He lost consciousness instantly.    CHAPTER VI  \"What a cockeyed world,\" said Alaric Arkalion Sr. to his son. \"You certainly can't plan on anything, even if you do have more money than you'll ever possibly need in a lifetime.\"  \"Don't feel like that,\" said young Alaric. \"I'm not in prison any longer, am I?\"  \"No. But you're not free of the Nowhere Journey, either. There is an unheralded special trip to Nowhere, two weeks from today, I have been informed.\"  \"Oh?\"  \"Yes, oh. I have also been informed that you will be on it. You didn't escape after all, Alaric.\"  \"Oh. Oh!\"  \"What bothers me most is that scoundrel Smith somehow managed to escape. They haven't found him yet, I have also been informed. And since my contract with him calls for ten million dollars 'for services rendered,' I'll have to pay.\"  \"But he didn't prevent me from--\"  \"I can't air this thing, Alaric! But listen, son: when you go where you are going, you're liable to find another Alaric Arkalion, your double. Of course, that would be Smith. If you can get him to cut his price in half because of what has happened, I would be delighted. If you could somehow manage to wring his neck, I would be even more delighted. Ten million dollars--for nothing.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"I'm so excited,\" murmured Mrs. Draper. Stephanie watched her on one of the new televiewers, recently installed in place of the telephone.  \"What is it?\"  \"Our bill has been passed by a landslide majority in both houses of Congress!\"  \"Ooo!\" cried Stephanie.  \"Not very coherent, my dear, but those are my sentiments exactly. In two weeks there will be a Journey to Nowhere, a special one which will include, among its passengers, a woman.\"  \"But the study which had to be made--?\"  \"It's already been made. From what I gather, they can't take it very far. Most of their conclusions had to be based on supposition. The important thing, though, is this: a woman _will_ be sent. The way the C.E.L. figures it, my dear, is that a woman falling in the twenty-one to twenty-six age group should be chosen, a woman who meets all the requirements placed upon the young men.\"  \"Yes,\" said Stephanie. \"Of course. And I was just thinking that I would be--\"  \"Remember those chickens!\" cautioned Mrs. Draper. \"We already have one hundred seventy-seven volunteers who'd claw each other to pieces for a chance to go.\"  \"Wrong,\" Stephanie said, smiling. \"You now have one hundred seventy-eight.\"  \"Room for only one, my dear. Only one, you know.\"  \"Then cross the others off your list. I'm already packing my bag.\"         *       *       *       *       *  When Temple regained consciousness, it was with the feeling that no more than a split second of time had elapsed. So much had happened so rapidly that, until now, he hadn't had time to consider it.  Arkalion had vanished.  Vanished--he could use no other word. He was there, standing in the booth--and then he wasn't. Simple as that. Now you see it, now you don't. And goodbye, Arkalion.  But goodbye Temple, too. For hadn't Temple entered the same booth, waiting but a second until Arkalion activated the mechanism at the other end? And certainly Temple wasn't in the booth now. He smiled at the ridiculously simple logic of his thoughts. He stood in an open field, the blades of grass rising to his knees, as much brilliant purple as they were green. Waves of the grass, stirred like tide by the gentle wind, and hills rolling off toward the horizon in whichever direction he turned. Far away, the undulating hills lifted to a half soft mauve sky. A somber red sun with twice Sol's apparent disc but half its brightness hung midway between zenith and horizon completing the picture of peaceful other-worldliness.  Wherever this was, it wasn't Earth--or Mars.  Nowhere?  Temple shrugged, started walking. He chose his direction at random, crushing an easily discernible path behind him in the surprisingly brittle grass. The warm sun baked his back comfortably, the soft-stirring wind caressed his cheeks. Of Arkalion he found not a trace.  Two hours later Temple reached the hills and started climbing their gentle slopes. It was then that he saw the figure approaching on the run. It took him fully half a minute to realize that the runner was not human.         *       *       *       *       *  After months of weightless inactivity, things started to happen for Sophia. The feeling of weight returned, but weight as she never had felt it before. It was as if someone was sitting on every inch of her body, crushing her down. It made her gasp, forced her eyes shut and, although she could not see it, contorted her face horribly. She lost consciousness, coming to some time later with a dreadful feeling of loginess. Someone swam into her vision dimly, stung her arm briefly with a needle. She slept.  She was on a table, stretched out, with lights glaring down at her. She heard voices.  \"The new system is far better than testing, comrade.\"  \"Far more efficient, far more objective. Yes.\"  \"The brain emits electromagnetic vibration. Strange, is it not, that no one before ever imagined it could tell a story. A completely accurate story two years of testing could not give us.\"  \"In Russia we have gone far with the biological, psychological sciences. The West flies high with physics. Give them Mars; bah, they can have Mars.\"  \"True, Comrade. The journey to Jupiter is greater, the time consumed is longer, the cost, more expensive. But here on Jupiter we can do something they cannot do on Mars.\"  \"I know.\"  \"We can make supermen. Supermen, comrade. A wedding of Nietzsche and Marx.\"  \"Careful. Those are dangerous thoughts.\"  \"Merely an allusion, comrade. Merely a harmless allusion. But you take an ordinary human being and train him on Jupiter, speeding his time-sense and metabolic rate tremendously with certain endocrine secretions so that one day is as a month to him. You take him and subject him to big Jupiter's pull of gravity, more than twice Earth's--and in three weeks you have, yes--you have a superman.\"  \"The woman wakes.\"  \"Shh. Do not frighten her.\"  Sophia stretched, every muscle in her body aching. Slowly, as in a dream, she sat up. It required strength, the mere act of pulling her torso upright!  \"What have you done to me?\" she cried, focussing her still-dim vision on the two men.  \"Nothing, comrade. Relax.\"  Sophia turned slowly on the table, got one long shapely leg draped over its edge.  \"Careful, comrade.\"  What were they warning her about? She merely wanted to get up and stretch; perhaps then she would feel better. Her toe touched the floor, she swung her other leg over, aware of but ignoring her nakedness.  \"A good specimen.\"  \"Oh, yes, comrade. So this time they send a woman among the others. Well, we shall do our work. Look--see the way she is formed, so lithe, loose-limbed, agile.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]  [Sidenote: There was a reason why his scripts were smash hits--they had realism. And why not? He was reliving every scene and emotion in them!]   It was really a pretty fair script, and it caught me at a moment when every playwright worth his salt was playing in France, prostituting in Hollywood or sulking in a slump. I needed a play badly, so I told Ellie to get this unknown up to my office and have a contract ready.  When she announced him on the inter-com, my door banged open and a youngster in blue-jeans, sweatshirt and a stubbly crew-cut popped in like a carelessly aimed champagne cork.  I said, \"I'm sorry, son, but I have an interview right now. Besides we aren't casting yet. Come back in a couple of weeks.\"  His grin never faltered, being of the more durable kind that you find on farms and west of the Rockies. His ragged sneakers padded across my Persian, and I thought he was going to spring over my desk like a losing tennis player.  \"I'm your interview,\" he announced. \"At least I'm Hillary Hardy, and your girl just told me you'd see me.\"  \"You--are Hillary Hardy?\"  \"In the morbid flesh,\" he said jamming out five enthusiastic fingers that gulped my hand and jack-hammered until I broke his grip with a Red-Cross life-saving hold.  \"Spare the meat,\" I groaned. \"I have to sign the contract, too.\"  \"I did it! I did it! They said I was crazy, but I did it the first time.\"  \"Did what?\"  \"Sold the first play I wrote.\"  \"This--is--your first work?\"  \"My very first,\" he said, splitting his freckles with a double row of white teeth a yard wide. \"They said I'd have to go to college, and then I'd have to write a million words before I'd produce anything worthwhile.\"  If he hadn't owned such an honest, open face I'd have thrown him out as an imposter right then. The ream of neatly typed pages on my desk would have fooled any agent, editor or producer like myself, on Broadway. The format was professional, the plot carefully constructed, the dialogue breezy as a May afternoon in Chicago and the motivation solidly adult.  \"How old are you?\" I asked.  \"Nineteen.\"  \"And you'll sign an affidavit that you wrote this play, and it's an original work?\"  \"Certainly!\" The smile faded a little. \"Look, Mr. Crocker, you're not just kidding about this contract, are you? Is the play really okay?\"  \"That,\" I said trying to restrain my own enthusiasm, \"is only determined on the boards. But I'm willing to risk a thousand-dollar advance on your signature to this.\" I shoved the papers at him with my fountain pen on top.  He didn't uncap the pen until he had read the whole thing, and while he pored over the fine print I had time to catch my breath.  His play competed rather well with the high average output of most professionals I knew--not exactly terrific, but a relatively safe gamble, as gambles go on the street of bright lights. Well, I made a mental note to pass the script around a bit before I signed the contract myself. After all, he might have cribbed the whole thing somewhere.  He finished reading, signed the contract and handed it back to me with an air of expectancy. I stalled, \"I, uh, will have the check for you in a few days. Meanwhile, you'd better get yourself an agent and an attorney and fix up that affidavit of authorship. Normally, I don't deal with free-lance playwrights, you see.\"  \"But I don't need any agent,\" he protested. \"You be my agent, Mr. Crocker--\" He was studying my reaction, and after a moment he said, \"You still don't quite believe that I wrote _Updraft_, do you, sir? Now that you've met me you want more time to check up, don't you?\"  I said, \"Frankly, yes, Hardy. _Updraft_ is a mature piece of writing, and unless you are a genius--well, it's just business son.\"  \"I don't blame you,\" he said smiling that fresh-air smile. \"And I'll admit I'm no genius, but I can explain everything. You see, I've read 38 books on how to write plays--\"  \"Tut!\" I said. \"Format technique is just a fraction of producing an appealing play.\"  \"Perhaps,\" he admitted. \"But _I've memorized all 38 books_. What's more, I've been reading and memorizing plays, novels, poetry and history since I was 13. I have a storehouse of--\"  \"Memorizing?\"  \"Yes, sir. I'm a student of _mnemonics_, you know, the art of memory perfection. My real ambition is to develop absolute recall. All my reading and memorizing have been just exercises to expand my power of complete recall.\"  \"You mean that playwriting is just a hobby?\"  \"Not--exactly. I need money, lots of it, to continue my research. Psychiatrists come high.\"  Well, I suppose good plays have been written for screwier reasons, and I was in no mood to look a gift-author in the mouth. I did pass _Updraft_ around to a brace of critics, and none of them could hang a plagiarism charge on Hardy. So I wrote out his check and started the wheels going on the production.  The boy prodigy dropped out of sight for the time being, taking no further interest in his brain-child. _Updraft_ did all right in the sticks, but it was when we opened on Broadway that it began to coin money.         *       *       *       *       *  In ten performances we were playing to capacity crowds, and within a month we had to take in the S. R. O. sign. A lucky hit? I thought so at the time. _Updraft_ had a dash of humor, a bit of adventure, a dollop of romance and a gentle little heart tug at the conclusion, but damned if the critics could put their fingers on its money-making essence. They gave it pleasant little reviews and mild compliments, but no more. The cash customers, however, came and kept coming and _kept coming_!  The morning after the 100th performance I told Ellie to hunt up Hardy and see what he was doing about another play. I could stand to have another hit ready when _Updraft_ petered out.  That afternoon my secretary reported, \"He's in a sanitarium over in Hoboken.\"  \"Nuts! I knew we should have held back on his royalties,\" I exclaimed. \"I suppose he's drunk himself into a--\"  \"It's a mental hospital,\" Ellie said, \"but Mr. Hardy told me he is just there for some experimental psycho-therapy. He sounded quite normal and cheerful.\"  Hillary Hardy showed up next morning at my request, and he did, indeed, appear in good spirits. I demanded, \"What's this business of locking yourself up in a looney-bin? Don't you realize that's bad public relations?\"  He chuckled. \"I thought of that. So I'm going under an assumed name. Your girl said you had something very important to tell me.\"  \"Sure. I want another play,\" I told him. \"_Updraft_ won't run forever, you know.\"  \"Oh, I have plenty of money now, so I won't have to bother. The people at the sanitarium have become interested in my project, and all I'm spending is board and room there. Thanks to your royalty checks I've got quite a pile in the bank.\"  \"Won't have to bother?\" I yelled. \"Here I launch you on Broadway, and that's all the gratitude I get. Now's the time to cash in on the reputation of your first play. It's setting attendance records.\"  \"Sorry, Mr. Crocker,\" he said. \"I'm in a critical stage of my experiments. I just can't afford the time at the moment.\"  \"Experiments! Experiments! What is this business?\"  He brightened. \"Would you believe it? I've contacted memories back to three months after my birth. And at this rate I'll reach birth itself within a few weeks.\"  I shuddered. What a nasty ambition! \"What's the percentage?\"  \"You don't understand,\" he said warming to his subject. \"The further back I go the more nearly I approach total recall. At present I can contact any memory in my experience back to six months, day by day, minute by minute. I can run off these memories like colored movies, recalling every sight, sound, smell, feel and taste.\"  \"So what happened earlier than six months that's so important?\"  \"Probably nothing of great interest,\" Hardy granted, \"but the further back I go, the more intense is the reality of all my memories. For instance, right now I can return to the day, hour, minute and second I went to school for the first time. I can remember the look on the teacher's face and hear the screams of twenty-six kindergarten kids. I can smell the freshly oiled floors and the newly painted walls. I can feel the wart on my mother's finger, the one I was holding onto for dear life.\"  The almost fanatic glow in his eager, young face impressed me. Realism of memory! Could that be the essence of his successful first play? Did his down-to-earth touch account for _Updraft's_ surprising audience appeal?  I pleaded, \"Don't let me down now, Hillary. I gambled thousands of dollars on your first play. If you can repeat we'll both enjoy an even better pay-off. Besides, have you looked into what your taxes will be?\"  \"Taxes? No, I really haven't, but I'm sure I have enough to last another year. Sorry, Mr. Crocker. Maybe later, but right at the moment--\"  His broad-shouldered, lean athletic form drifted through my door and was gone.  Two weeks later _Parodisiac_ arrived, typed on fools-cap, uncorrected, with pencil notations and coffee-spots on it, but it was by-lined, \"Hillary Hardy,\" and after a single, quick scanning I was overjoyed to pay the expense of transcribing it to more durable paper. The play was powerful, witty and emotion-stirring. It was a work of art.  And on the last page was scribbled in the border: \"I looked into my tax bill, and found you were right. I'm almost broke after Uncle Sam takes his cut, so here is the play you asked for. Hope you like it. (signed) H. H.\"  There was a P.S. \"Expect to hit _birth_ this week.\"  When I phoned him at the sanitarium, asking for Sam Buckle, the name he had left originally with Ellie, he refused to come to the phone. So I wired him. \"Quit"]]]
