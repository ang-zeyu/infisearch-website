Place upon it, two inches from the edge, minced fowl or game, prepared as for croquets, and rolled up between two teaspoons in balls the size of a nutmeg. Place these an inch from each other; egg the paste all round and fold the edge of it over the balls of mince. Press it firmly down, and with a paste stamp two inches wide cut the rissoles, keeping the mince balls exactly in the centre of each.

Cover with puff paste, and bake for about an hour and a half.   Pressed Grouse.  Boil a brace of grouse till very tender; season, and then take away all the meat and pull it out very fine, removing all skin. Add to the liquor in which they were boiled a tablespoonful of gelatine for each three pounds of grouse, and keep stirring it in the boiling liquor till it is quite dissolved; place the grouse in a deep tin basin, and pour the liquor over it whilst hot; stir it well, so that the meat may become thoroughly saturated with the liquor,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31982"],["title","Dressed Game and Poultry à la Mode (#3)"],["body","turn a plate over it, put on a heavy weight, let it get cold, and turn out.

Make a mixture of about half a pint of stock and two ounces of butter, and let boil. When the stock boils take 3-1/4 ounces of fine Vienna flour, and stir it well over the fire for about three minutes; then add the yolks of three eggs, stirring over the fire again. Take it then from the saucepan, and place it on a plate to get cool; then pound the shredded grouse till quite fine, using a gill of cream; now pass it through a fine sieve. Take a plain round mould, holding a pint and a half, butter it, and ornament with truffles cut in devices. Cut up three or four mushrooms, and mix in with the grouse panada, and fill the mould. Place buttered paper over it, and let it steam for half an hour; then turn out and let it get cold, and when cold cut it into a number of scallops of the same size.

Warm these over a slow fire, but do not let them boil; when done, pour into a fancy mould lined with light puff paste. Bake, turn out, and serve very hot, garnished with crisped parsley.   To Cook Hare.  The great object in cooking a hare is to keep it as moist as possible, and therefore the hare must not be put too close to the fire in the first stage of roasting. Prepare a stuffing of quarter of a pound of beef suet, chopped finely, two ounces of uncooked ham, a teaspoonful of chopped parsley, and two teaspoonfuls of dried mixed savoury herbs; add to this a quarter of the rind of a lemon, chopped very fine, a dust of cayenne pepper, salt, five ounces of breadcrumbs, and two whole eggs. Pound this in the mortar. The liver may be minced and pounded in with these ingredients if fresh. Place the stuffing in the hare, and place at a distance from the fire; have plenty of dripping melted in the dripping pan, and basting should go on and be continued from the very first. Then as the hare is getting on, baste with good milk, and then baste well with butter; put the hare near the fire so as to froth the butter, and at the same time dredge the hare with some flour, so as to get a good brown colour, and serve good rich gravy _round_ it with half a glass of port wine in a tureen, and currant jelly should be handed with it.   Hare Cutlets à la Chef.  Take a freshly-killed hare, save the blood, paunch and skin it. Roast it, then cut off the fillets and cut them aslant and flatten them. Put the bones of the hare into a saucepan with two onions sliced, one good-sized carrot, a tiny piece of garlic, two cloves, and a bouquet garni, and one bayleaf. Moisten with a glass of white wine, and let all this steep and stew for an hour; then pass through a sieve, add a quarter of a boiled Spanish onion, and thicken with the blood of the hare. Make some hare stuffing, and moisten with some of the sauce, and make it into cutlets. To form cutlets similar to the fillet cutlets, place them in a frying-pan, and let them poach in water. Place the hare fillets and the stuffing cutlets in the pan and fry to a good colour in clarified butter. Put a small piece of the small bones of the hare in every cutlet and dish them in a crown. Fill the centre with a mixture of small onions, mushrooms, and small pieces of bacon, cut into dice which have been stewed in some of the sauce. Hand red currant jelly with this dish.   Hare en Daube.  French Recipe.  The hare must not be too high; cut it into pieces as for jugged hare. Rub into a stewpan a bit of bacon cut into squares; put the hare into it, together with thyme, bayleaf, spices, salt, pepper, and as much garlic as will go on the point of a knife. Add a little bacon rind blanched and cut into the shape of lozenges. When the whole has a uniform colour, moisten with a good glass of white wine, put on a close lid, and stew for four hours upon hot cinders. When ready to be served, pour away the lard, the spice, and the fat, and add a little essence of ham, and send to table hot.   Hare Derrynane Fashion.  Take three or four eggs, a pint of new milk, a couple of handfuls of flour, three yolks.

Paunch, skin, and clean a hare marinaded in vinegar for a couple of days with four onions sliced, three shalots, a couple of sprigs of parsley, pepper and salt. After two days take the hare out and drain it. Farce it with a stuffing made of the flesh of a chicken, three whole eggs, the liver, and a slice of bacon, all finely chopped, mixed and seasoned with pepper, salt, and a bouquet garni. Now put the hare in a stewpan with slices of bacon all over it, some sliced carrots, two onions stuck with cloves, and half a pint of consommé. Put some live coals on the lid of the saucepan and let it cook for three hours.   Hare à la Mode.  Skin the hare and cut it up in into joints and lard with fine fillets of bacon; place in an earthenware pot, with some slices of salt pork, chopped bacon, salt, mixed spice, a piece of butter, and half a pint of port wine; lay two or three sheets of buttered paper over it; fix on the lid tightly and simmer over a slow fire. When nearly done, stir in the blood, boil up and serve.   Jugged Hare.  Have a wide-mouthed stone jar, and put into it some good brown gravy free from fat. Next cut up the hare into neat joints; fry these joints in a little butter to brown them a little. Have the jar made hot by placing it in the oven, and have a cloth ready to tie over its mouth. Put the joints already browned into the jar, and let it stand for fifteen minutes on the dresser. After this has stood some time untie the jar and add the gravy, with a dust of cinnamon, six cloves, two bayleaves, and the juice of half a lemon. The gravy should have onion made in it, and should be thickened with a little arrowroot. A wineglassful of port should be added, and a good spoonful of red currant jelly should be dissolved in it. Next place the jar up to its neck in a large saucepan of boiling water, only taking care the jar is well tied down. Let it remain in the boiling water from an hour to an hour and a half. Stuffing balls, made with the same as the stuffing for roast hare, rolled into small balls the size of marbles and thrown into boiling fat, should be served with it.   To Roast Landrail.  This bird should be trussed like a snipe, and roasted quickly at a brisk but not a fierce fire for about fifteen or sixteen minutes. It should be dished on fried breadcrumbs, and gravy served in a tureen.   Croustade of Larks.  Bone two dozen larks, season, and put into each a piece of pâté de foie gras (truffled). Roll the larks up into a ball, put them in a pudding basin, season them with salt and pepper, and pour three ounces of clarified butter over them, and bake in a hot oven for a quarter of an hour. Dish them in a fried bread croustade, made by cutting the crust from a stale loaf about eight inches long, which must be scooped out in"]]]
