O'Malley started and his mouth popped open. He knew that voice! Then in came the voice of his other pilot.  \"We'll do as you do, Commander. Lead on!\"  \"You spalpeens!\" O'Malley bellowed. Then he broke out in a loud laugh. \"Sure, an' the Auld Man made monkeys out of you two.\"  There was no more time for happy reunion. Seven Messerschmitts were coming down after the bombers. They were not interested in the three Lightnings and hoped that the Yanks flying them had not noticed any Jerries near by. In this they were very much disappointed.  Stan peeled off and banked steeply. Laying over he rolled into position and cut out an Me. As the Jerry flashed past his sights, he opened up and his Brownings sawed a wing off the fighter. He was over and the Jerry was gone before he was able to see what had happened to the enemy ship. As he came up he saw that O'Malley was celebrating. He was doing mad loops and dives that threatened to drive the six Me's out of the sky before Allison could tangle with one of them. Allison's voice came in, crisp and exasperated.  \"I say, you Irisher. Lay off and let me have a chance!\"  \"Come on in!\" O'Malley yelled back and he stalled and dived after an Me.  The three ferry pilots were finishing off the Jerries when a flight of six Lightnings and three Airacobras slid down from upstairs and joined in. There was only one luckless Me left. Three had been shot down and two had fled. The outnumbered Jerry dived and headed for home.  Allison and Stan closed in beside O'Malley. Their leader called over to them.  \"There's a big fight on down there on that beach. Looks like the boys needed some help to keep the Stukas away.\"  \"We're under your orders, Commander,\" Stan answered.  \"Sure, an' you birds stand trial right alongside o' me when we get back,\" O'Malley shouted back. He dived and his pals went with him.  Down they went over the invasion beach-head where sky battles raged as German and Italian fighter bombers tried to strafe or bomb Yank and British landing craft.  Stan leaned over and looked down. The scene below was a stirring one. Three battlewagons of the cruiser class lay offshore. In closer, a line of destroyers was blazing fire and smoke as they blasted the shore batteries of the enemy. A group of torpedo boats darted in and out, tormenting an enemy ship. Toward the shore and moving from four big transports came the landing barges: the personnel barges, the tank carriers, the mechanized armament barges. In swarms they were pouring toward the shore. In the air above, Yank and R.A.F. fighter pilots struggled to keep the dive bombers and the torpedo planes from getting at the ships. This was the zero hour for the boys in the barges. Either they established a beach-head or they failed at terrible cost.  Stan forgot that he was supposed to be a ferry pilot. He spotted a Stuka slipping in behind a screen of smoke rising from a burning freighter. Nosing down, he went after the Stuka. He caught a flash of O'Malley and Allison going in, too. They were needed, there was no doubt about that. The German planes were getting through.  Coming down on the bandit, Stan eased over a bit and flattened out to come in on the bomber's tail. The Stuka was sloping down toward one of the transport ships. Stan kicked his throttle on full and raised his nose until he had the bandit in his sights. His thumb pressed the gun button and he felt the terrific kick-back from his bank of guns. He saw the tail and a large part of the rear compartment of the Stuka wobble and then sheer away. Whirling crazily, smoke billowing up from its torn body, the Stuka went down, landing with a splash close alongside the transport. Stan went over the deck of the ship so low, he could see the grateful Navy boys waving at him.  Swinging inshore, Stan knifed after a Focke-Wulf 190 which was strafing the barges. He sent the 190 kiting along the tops of the waves and away inland. Stan was hot on the tail of the Focke-Wulf. He was sure he would get in a burst, when suddenly a burst of flak from a ground battery enveloped him. He felt the steel ripping through his wings. One motor began to stutter badly. It was then that Stan remembered he was supposed to deliver his plane to Malta in good condition.  Easing around, he climbed upward at a slow rate. He was looking for O'Malley and Allison. He spotted O'Malley by the crazy manner of his attack against an Me 110 which had closed in upon him. Stan grinned in spite of the seriousness of their predicament. Half the tail had been shot off O'Malley's Lightning. She was not handling very well. The Me had a big edge. Stan went up as fast as his one crippled motor would take him.  The Me pitted against O'Malley had the Irishman in a spot. He had doubled inside O'Malley's loop and was now on his tail. Stan tried hard to power dive but got only feeble results. He waited grimly, expecting O'Malley to go down under a hail of Nazi lead. But O'Malley did not go down. Another Lightning came roaring down and cut the Me almost in half. Allison had been looking for O'Malley, too.  \"How about hitting it for Malta, Commander?\" Stan called.  \"I say, old man, we better be getting out of here. The boys have everything under control in this sector,\" Allison added.  \"Sure, an' we're headed for home, tuck in close an' follow me,\" O'Malley called cheerfully.  \"We better cook up a good report,\" Stan said grimly.  \"Sure, an' we got waylaid. 'Tis something could happen to anyone flying ferry planes,\" O'Malley answered. \"Wasn't that the way it happened?\"  \"That is a bit of the truth, you know,\" Allison agreed.  \"I don't know how I'll explain the flak holes I picked up. No Jerry or Italian plane ever carried five-inch guns,\" Stan answered.  \"We met a enemy battleship,\" O'Malley said, unconcerned.  Stan snorted. \"The Italian Navy hasn't poked its nose out of a home base in over a year. We were supposed to be flying in close to Allied shores.\"  \"Sure, an' you're right,\" O'Malley answered cheerfully. \"But I'll be thinkin' o' something, niver fear.\"  Stan looked down and then up. They had plunged into very soupy weather with low clouds and some wind. His ship was not taking it very well. Then it began to rain.  \"You better be thinking of getting us in, one of my engines is about to conk out on me,\" he called across.  \"I'm doing foine,\" O'Malley said. \"Hear them signals coming in? That's the boys on Malta giving us the old signal. We'll ride right in.\"  They changed course, heading north. Stan began to frown. It did not seem right to be heading in that direction. Suddenly they sighted a field through the rain. O'Malley dived for the field and Stan followed with Allison close behind. They hit the runway in a drenching rain and rolled in wing to wing.  Suddenly they were confronted by four trucks. The trucks rolled out and halted across their paths, pulling in close before them so that the Lightnings could not turn around. Stan stared at the trucks. They certainly were not Yank or British. Then he saw squads of grinning Italian soldiers poking machine guns over the sides of the trucks. Ground men began swarming out. Everyone was smiling.  \"You sure let them call you in,\" Stan shouted to O'Malley.  \"'Twas a dirty trick, them using our signals to call us in here,\" O'Malley fumed.  \"Malta is just across the strait, I'll bet,\" Allison said. \"I've heard that the Italians use this trick, but I never thought they'd fool the Irish.\" There was a mocking note in Allison's voice. \"We may as well climb down like good little boys. They have us covered with a hundred machine guns.\"  \"I'm getting out very carefully,\" Stan said. O'Malley said nothing at all, but he climbed out and joined Stan and Allison.  A group of Italian officers crowded around them. All were smiling and bowing as though welcoming the Yanks. O'Malley scowled at them, but Stan grinned back and Allison lifted a hand.  One of the Italian officers stepped forward. He spoke good English.  \"You are prisoners of war, gentlemen. Come with us.\" He waved a hand toward the dim outline of a building.  The three Yanks were willing to move in out of the rain. They were drenched to the skin. Before they had reached the place where they were to be questioned the rain had ceased falling, and the sun had burst through the clouds. O'Malley was completely disgusted.  \"Sure, an' I calls that a dirty trick. The weather is against us as well as iverything else.\"  \"Please be seated,\" the Italian officer said as they entered a large room.  The three Yanks sat down and waited gloomily. Three high-ranking Italian officers entered. They spoke swiftly in their native tongue to the officer who had escorted the boys to the room. Their words were excited and they made many motions with their hands. O'Malley stared at them sourly. Finally the junior officer turned to the boys.  \"General Bolero wishes to ask you some questions.\"  The general smiled as he put the questions. \"We wish to know how many planes and how many ships you are using. Also we wish to know at what places your forces plan to land.\"  Stan spoke up. He shrugged his shoulders and spread his hands wide.  \"No one can answer those questions but our high command. We are only ferry pilots as you will see if you examine the flight orders of our leader.\" He nodded toward O'Malley.  The general turned and spoke quickly to the other officers in Italian. They looked at O'Malley and talked some more, then the general turned to O'Malley. Before he could speak, O'Malley cut in:  \"What I want to know is who's responsible for the trick that was pulled on us?\"  The general smiled and his medal-covered chest expanded at O'Malley's question.  \"I am honored that you appreciate my clever trick,\" he said"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32288"],["title","A Yankee Flier in Italy (#5)"],["body","fably.  O'Malley scowled at the general. \"'Tis a foul trick,\" he said. \"I have been insulted an' I'll get even with you.\"  Stan broke in to avoid O'Malley's getting into real action against the general.  \"What are you going to do with us?\"  \"You will be flown to one of our prison camps on the mainland. You will be treated strictly according to International Law,\" the general answered.  \"How soon?\" Stan asked. He was thinking the paratroopers might take over this airfield very soon. He knew they would be hitting the coastal fields in order to give the boys spots to work from that were closer to Italy than the African coast.  \"At once, at once,\" the general said and he seemed suddenly nervous.  \"We are in no hurry, old man,\" Allison said and grinned.  \"Ah, but we are in a very great hurry,\" put in the junior officer. \"General Bolero is leaving at once. You will be flown out in, say, twenty minutes. I am so sorry there will be no time for dry clothes.\" He bowed and nodded to four soldiers armed with rifles who had appeared through a side door. \"You will go with the guards.\"     CHAPTER V  PRISON SHIP   The three Yanks were rushed out upon the parade ground at the Italian base. Two squads of shouting Italian soldiers escorted them. They burst upon a scene of confusion and excitement. Stan looked across the grounds toward the runways. Suddenly he burst out laughing and poked Allison in the ribs.  \"Look! His Nibs is deserting us!\"  General Bolero was leading his staff toward a parked plane. For a big fat man he was making fast time. His cape floated out behind him and he had lost his jaunty cap. His officers were loaded down with brief cases, files, and bundles of papers. The general was a full ten paces ahead of them.  \"I'd call that a rout,\" Allison shouted.  \"I think our outfits must be closing in. We'll have to do some stalling,\" Stan shouted.  O'Malley was already stalling. Four men were pushing him along, and he was beginning to show signs of temper. Stan tried to get close enough to shout a warning to him. He did not want O'Malley to start a riot at that moment.  The Italians were evacuating the base in every sort of machine they had. Cars roared across the field, men pedaled by on bicycles, trucks lumbered past, and a whippet tank snorted as it rolled past dragging a field gun. Men on foot rushed in every direction.  Stan stumbled and went down, managing to trip two soldiers. Instantly a dozen Italians were upon him, tugging at him, waving their rifles and shouting. O'Malley took this as a signal to go into action. He swung hard on the chin of an officer standing beside him. The surprised officer went down like a felled beef. With a yell O'Malley waded in, swinging at soldiers as they piled in on him. Many bloody noses and black eyes developed in a hurry, but O'Malley was swarmed under by the weight of sheer numbers. He went down yelling like a Comanche Indian and swinging like Joe Louis.  Stan struggled to his feet and held up his hands. He realized the uselessness of fighting against such odds. The melee O'Malley had caused had drawn almost a company of Italians to the spot. Allison had managed to stay on his feet, but he had suffered from rough handling along with Stan and O'Malley. His uniform, which was wet and sagging, had been torn in a dozen places.  \"Go quietly!\" an Italian officer bellowed. He had just arrived on the scene. \"Go quietly or you will be sorry!\"  \"We're going, call off your dogs!\" Stan shouted.  The officer shouted orders in Italian and soon restored a semblance of order. Allison called across to Stan.  \"Have a look above, and you'll see what all the excitement is about.\"  Stan looked into the sky and caught his breath. The paratroopers were coming. Low over the hilly country a fleet of transports and gliders swept in from the sea. They swept along in perfect formation like giant birds seeking a tree to light upon. Above them fighter planes wove in and out, while on either side fighter-bombers roared along. It was a beautiful sight.  Suddenly the Yank air soldiers began to pile out. The sky blossomed with colored parachutes until the blue was thickly dotted with them like a field crowded with spring flowers. They came floating down with machine guns and supply hassocks dangling from their chutes. On a slope above the field a glider nosed in. It slid to a halt and a jeep bounded out of its fat, rounded snout. Another glider slid in and a tank rolled out of it almost before it had slid to a halt. The slope above them was already swarming with Yanks, and machine guns were rattling.  Stan looked around desperately. They were being rushed toward a big truck. He made one last attempt to slow down their retreat. Shaking off the men who held him, he ducked his head and hit the line of soldiers like a blocking back clearing a path for a ball carrier. Two Italians went down, one under a straight, stiff arm and the other from a solid body-block. Then a soldier clipped Stan across the head with the butt of his rifle. Stan went down on his face and lay still.  O'Malley had started his fight again, but this time the Italians were not wasting precious minutes. O'Malley got a rap such as the one that had felled Stan. Allison went down under a pile of soldiers. Two minutes later the three Yanks, out cold, were dumped into the truck and it was rumbling away along a paved road.  A few minutes later Stan groaned and opened his eyes. The truck was so packed with soldiers that he was forced to sit up, even though he had been out limp and cold. His head throbbed and felt twice its normal size. Turning it a little he could look out over the side of the truck. They were rolling along a winding road, climbing in low gear. Looking back Stan saw the battlefield they had just left.  The Yank airborne troops had swarmed onto the airfield. Already two big Yank planes had landed and men were spilling out to take over the field. With a groan Stan looked up. Twisting his head caused pains to shoot up and down his neck. He saw that the paratroopers were still coming in. A field of white chutes filled the air, while behind them dropped the varicolored chutes carrying equipment and ammunition. Gliders were casting off their toggle hooks and swooping earthward. Equipped with tommy-guns, folding rifles, mortars, folding bicycles, bazookas and light artillery, the air soldiers swarmed down.  Suddenly excited shouts from the Italians in the truck made Stan look up again. A fighter-bomber was roaring down toward the truck. Stan saw that there were three trucks in the group and that they were closely bunched, an ideal target for the diving Yank. Grimly he watched the hundred-pound egg slide free as the bomber lifted and zoomed upward. The deadly missile seemed to hang in the air for a moment, though it grew bigger and bigger every second. It appeared to be aimed straight at the last truck in line, which was their transport. Stan looked about for Allison and O'Malley.  His pals were standing against the side of the truck, wedged in by soldiers. They both looked weak and shaken. O'Malley was almost without clothes. Then the bomb hit. It landed in a bank just behind the truck. A great upheaval of earth and rocks lifted into the air and showered over the truck. One rear tire exploded with a bang and the truck began to wobble and jolt as it swayed along.  Then they broke over the top of the ridge and went careening down a steep slope. Five minutes later they had reached cover in an avenue of trees. But the Italians did not halt for repairs. They wanted to put as many miles as possible between them and the Yank air army before their gas ran out.  An hour later the truck limped into another airfield which had not been attacked. It was tucked away in a circle of hills with wooded slopes reaching down to a little valley. Here they found they had overtaken General Bolero. He was out on the field rushing about, shouting orders and apparently getting ready to take off again. His staff was trailing him about, with their bundles and brief cases and files.  Stan and his pals were rushed into a small barracks room. The junior officer who spoke English had charge of them, backed by a dozen guards.  \"We will supply you with clothing,\" he said, casting his eye over their ragged uniforms.  The clothing turned out to be blue shirts and bright green dungaree overalls. O'Malley glared at the officer. Stan grinned as he slipped into his outfit.  \"It would save you a lot of trouble if you just turned us loose,\" he suggested.  \"You will not escape. You will be sent to Italy.\" The officer matched O'Malley's glare. \"Sicily can never be taken. Our infallible leader Mussolini has said Sicily can never be taken.\" He waved his hands excitedly. \"Your forces will be driven into the sea.\"  \"I'll bet you a bottle of your finest wine that half of the island is already taken,\" Stan answered.  \"I say, why don't you kick the Germans out and help us along?\" Allison asked. He felt he might touch a sore spot in mentioning the Germans.  The shot hit home. A flush spread over the face of the officer. \"The Nazi dogs,\" he snapped. \"We will deal with them after we have used them to help us.\"  \"Sure, an' they'll treat you like they did the Poles,\" O'Malley said. \"An' it will serve you right well, you spalpeens.\"  \"We'd like to stop over here and rest a bit,\" Stan cut in. \"We realize you treated us roughly because we made you a lot of trouble. We'll give you our parole. There'll be no more rough stuff.\"  \"You talkin' fer me?\" O'Malley growled.  \"I am,\" Stan said and gave O'Malley a hard look. \"We'll see that you're a nice, well-behaved boy.\"  \"Agreed,\" Allison said, catching Stan's idea that he was playing for time. Even if they gave their parole it would not prevent their being captured by the Yanks.  The officer smiled knowingly. \"You would like to stay here. You think your air troops will take over this field. No, we will not be so foolish. You leave for Italy in one hour."]]]
