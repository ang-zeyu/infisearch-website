SNOWY OWL  _Nyctea nyctea_            A large Owl with no 'ear' tufts and yellow eyes;           chiefly white with small brownish or blackish           markings. L. 25.            _Range._ Nests in Arctic regions, migrating           southward irregularly in winter to the northern           United States.            Washington, casual W.V. Ossining, A.V. Cambridge,           rare and irregular W.V. N. Ohio, rare W.V. Glen           Ellyn, very rare W.V. SE. Minn., common W.V.,           Oct.-Apl.  A rare winter visitant which is more often seen along the seashore. Unlike most Owls it hunts by day, feeding chiefly on mice but also on birds.   HAWK OWL  _Surnia ulula caparoch_            A medium-sized Owl with a whitish face and yellow           eyes and a _long, rounded_ tail; the head is           spotted, the back barred with whitish; the           underparts are barred with white and blackish. L.           15; T. 7¼.            _Range._ Northern North America, rarely visiting           the northern United States in winter.            Cambridge, very rare in late fall. N. Ohio, rare           W.V. SE. Minn., uncommon W.V., Oct.-Mch.  \"The Hawk Owl is strictly diurnal, as much so as any of the Hawks, and like some of them often selects a tall shrub or dead-topped tree in a comparatively open place for a perch, where it sits in the bright sunlight watching for its prey\" (Fisher).   FLORIDA BURROWING OWL  _Speotyto cunicularia floridana_            A small, ground Owl, with nearly naked legs and           feet and no ear-tufts. The upperparts are grayish           brown marked with white; the throat is white, rest           of underparts barred with grayish brown and white.           L. 9.            _Range._ Southern Florida, chiefly in the           Kissimmee Prairie region.  This is a representative of our western Burrowing Owl, which, in some way unknown to man, has established itself far from others of its kind in central southern Florida, where it is locally common. It nests in a hole in the ground, excavated by itself, and lays 5-7 white eggs in March.     PARROTS, MACAWS, PAROQUETS, COCKATOOS. ORDER PSITTACI     PARROTS AND PAROQUETS. FAMILY PSITTACIDÆ   CAROLINA PAROQUET  _Conuropsis carolinensis carolinensis_            A long-tailed, green Paroquet with a yellow head,           orange forehead and cheeks. L. 12½.            _Range._ Formerly southeastern United States north           to Virginia, west to Nebraska and Texas; now           southern Florida where it is on the verge of           extinction, if not extinct.            Washington, extinct, known only from specimens           shot in Sept., 1865.  The Paroquet has paid the penalty of wearing bright plumes, of making a desirable cage-bird, of being destructive to fruit, and of having little fear of man. Once abundant and wide-spread, for nearly the past half a century it has been restricted to Florida, where the species will soon go out of existence, if it has not already done so. Its nesting habits are unknown.     CUCKOOS, KINGFISHERS, ETC. ORDER COCCYGES     CUCKOOS, ANIS, ETC. FAMILY CUCULIDÆ   YELLOW-BILLED CUCKOO  _Coccyzus americanus americanus. Case 7, Fig. 1_            Broadly white-tipped tail-feathers, a partly           yellow bill, and largely reddish brown primaries           distinguish this species from its black-billed           cousin. L. 12½, of which one-half is tail.            _Range._ Nests from northern Florida to Canada;           winters in tropical America, returning to the           United States in April.            Washington, common S.R., May 3-Oct. 13. Ossining,           common S.R., May 4-Oct. 31. Cambridge, common           S.R., May 12-Sept. 15. N. Ohio, common S.R., Apl.           20-Sept. 25. Glen Ellyn, quite common S.R., May           15-Sept. 29. SE. Minn., common S.R., May 21-Aug.           20.  Cuckoos are common birds, but are more often heard than seen. Their notes are not like those of the cuckoo clock, which exactly imitates the voice of the European Cuckoo, but a series of _cuck-cuck-cucks_ and _cow-cows_ repeated a varying number of times. The Cuckoo rarely makes long flights but slips from one tree to another, seeking at once the inner branches and avoiding an exposed perch. The nest, a platform of sticks, thinly covered, is placed in low trees or bushes. The 3-5 greenish blue eggs are laid in May.   BLACK-BILLED CUCKOO  _Coccyzus erythrophthalmus. Case 7, Fig. 2_            A wholly black bill (note that in both our Cuckoos           it is slightly curved), wings without reddish           brown, and small, inconspicuous white tips to the           tail-feathers distinguish this species from the           preceding.            _Range._ A more northern species than the           Yellow-billed Cuckoo. Nests from Virginia (Georgia           in the mountains) to Quebec; winters in tropical           America, reaching the southern States in April.            Washington, rather rare S.R., May 5-Oct. 6.           Ossining, common S.R., May 3-Oct. 7. Cambridge,           common S.R., May 12-Sept. 20. N. Ohio, tolerably           common S.R., May 1-Sept. 25. Glen Ellyn, S.R., May           5-Oct. 21. SE. Minn., common S.R., May 8-Sept. 27.  The day after penning the foregoing notes on the Yellow-billed Cuckoo, I saw a Black-bill make a prolonged, dashing flight through the open, alight on the limb of a dead, leafless tree, directly over a young girl who was calling loudly to an active dog near her, and from this conspicuous perch utter its low _coo-coo_ notes, both looking and sounding more like a Dove than a conventional Cuckoo. So while we may say that the Cuckoos are much alike in habits one must not accept generalized statements too literally. There is much individuality among birds, a fact that makes their study far more interesting than if all were cast in the same mold.  The notes of this species are softer than those of the Yellow-bill, but the difference between the calls of the two species must be learned from the birds, not from books. The nest of the Black-bill is the more compactly built of the two, and its eggs are of a deeper shade.     KINGFISHERS. FAMILY ALCEDINIDÆ   BELTED KINGFISHER  _Ceryle alcyon. Case 3, Fig. 18; Case 5, Fig. 10_            The female resembles the male, but the sides and           the band across the breast are reddish brown. This           is our only Kingfisher. Crest, color, size,           habits, all distinguish him. L. 13.            _Range._ North America; winters from Illinois and           Virginia, southward; migrates north in early           April.            Washington, common P.R., except in midwinter.           Ossining, common S.R., Apl. 1-Nov. 23; casual in           winter. Cambridge, common S.R., Apl. 10-Nov. 1;           rare W.V. N. Ohio, common S.R., Mch. 20-Nov. 1;           rare W.V. Glenn Ellyn, isolated pairs, Apl. 1-Nov.           19. SE. Minn., common S.R., Mch. 21-Dec. 12.  The Belted Kingfisher is a watchman of the waterways who sounds his loud rattle when we trespass on his territory, a gallant fisherman, who, like a Falcon 'waits on' with fluttering wing, and the moment his aim is taken plunges headlong with a splash on some fish that has ventured too near the surface.  The nest is made at the end of a burrow in a bank; 5-8 white eggs are laid in May.     WOODPECKERS, WRYNECKS, ETC. ORDER PICI     WOODPECKERS. FAMILY PICIDÆ   IVORY-BILLED WOODPECKER  _Campephilus principalis_            Our largest Woodpecker, black with a white stripe           down each side of the neck, white showing in the           wing in flight, the male with a flaming red crest,           the female with a black one and both with an           ivory-white bill. L. 20.            _Range._ Formerly southeastern United States to           North Carolina; now rare and local in the wilder,           less settled portions of the Gulf States.  When man appears, the Ivory-bill disappears. This is not alone due to the destruction of the birds' haunts but to the bird's shy, retiring nature. Its days are numbered even more surely than are those of the forests it inhabits.  The nesting cavity is usually made in a cypress some forty feet from the ground, and 3-5 white eggs are laid in March.   HAIRY WOODPECKER  _Dryobates villosus villosus. Case 2, Figs. 28, 29_            The Hairy is a large edition of the Downy with           white, unmarked outer tail-feathers. The male has           a red head-band. L. 9½.            _Range._ Middle and northern states; a permanent           resident. The southern Hairy Woodpecker (_D. v.           auduboni_) inhabits the southeastern United States           north to southern Virginia. It is smaller than the           Hairy and has less white in the plumage. L.           8-1/10.            The Northern Hairy Woodpecker (_D. v. leucomelas_)           is found from the northern United States           northward. It is larger and whiter than the Hairy.           L. 10.            The Newfoundland Hairy Woodpecker (_D. v.           terrænovæ_) is larger and darker than the Hairy;           it inhabits Newfoundland.            Washington, rare P.R. Ossining, rare P.R.           Cambridge, uncommon W.V., one summer record. N.           Ohio, common P.R. Glen Ellyn, fairly common P.R.  The Hairy is not so common as his small cousin the Downy, and does not so readily make friends. He prefers the woods to our orchards and is for these reasons less often seen at our feeding-stands. The Hairy's notes are noticeably louder than the Downy's. The nest-hole is usually in a dead tree. The 2-4 white eggs are laid the last half of April.   DOWNY WOODPECKER  _Dryobates pubescens medianus. Case 2, Figs. 26, 27_            The Downy differs from the Hairy Woodpecker in           color by having the outer tail-feathers with black           bars, but it is the bird's obviously smaller size           that will serve to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31751"],["title","What Bird is That? (#8)"],["body","it. L. 6¾.            _Range._ From Virginia northward into Canada. A           Permanent Resident. The Southern Downy Woodpecker           (_D. p. pubescens_, Case 3, Fig. 25) is smaller,           darker below and with the white markings smaller.           L. 6. It inhabits the south Atlantic and Gulf           States north to North Carolina.            Washington, common P.R. Ossining, common P.R.           Cambridge, common P.R. N. Ohio, common P.R. Glen           Ellyn, common P.R. SE. Minn., common P.R.  Our commonest Woodpecker; an alert, active little driller for insects and their eggs and larvæ, and frequent visitor to our lunch-counters, particularly if we supply them with suet. His sharp _peek, peek_, running at times into a diminishing string of _peeks_, and his rolling tatoo, as he pounds a limb with amazing rapidity, are prominent parts of every-day bird language, the tatoo being a 'song' of the breeding season.  Four to six white eggs are laid in a hole, usually in a dead tree, the first week in May. The Southern Downy nests in April.   RED-COCKADED WOODPECKER  _Dryobates borealis_            Between the Downy and Hairy in size (L. 8½) with a           general resemblance to both, but the male with a           small tuft of red feathers on each _side_ of the           back of the head.            _Range._ Southeastern States north to North           Carolina.  An inhabitant of the pine woods, who utters a coarse _yank-yank_ note and may at times be seen feeding from the terminal tufts of pine 'needles' in the higher branches. The nest is usually in a living pine; the 2-5 white eggs are laid in April.   ARCTIC THREE-TOED WOODPECKER  _Picoides arcticus_            Two toes in front and one behind, a solid black           back and an orange-yellow crown in the male           distinguish this from all our other Woodpeckers.           Size of the Hairy, L. 9½.            _Range._ Canada, and northern parts of our border           states, rarely south in winter, as far as Nebraska           and Ohio.            Cambridge, one record. N. Ohio, rare W.V. SE.           Minn., rare.  An inhabitant of the spruce and balsam forests of our northern states, occasionally straggling southward in winter. Nests in May.   THREE-TOED WOODPECKER  _Picoides americanus americanus_            Two toes in front and one behind, an orange-yellow           crest in the male, and a black back _closely and           evenly barred with white_ distinguish this bird;           it is somewhat smaller than the preceding, L. 8¾.            _Range._ Canada, south to the northern parts of           our boundary states; unknown south of           Massachusetts.  Not so common as the Arctic Three-toed Woodpecker, and less often found south of its breeding range. Nests in early June.   YELLOW-BELLIED SAPSUCKER  _Sphyrapicus varius varius. Case 3, Fig. 26, Case 5, Fig. 30_            The female has the throat white, and rarely, crown           wholly black. Young birds have the throat whitish,           crown dull black, breast brownish. The black           breast-patch and red forehead, and red or white           throat are distinguishing characters. L. 8½.            _Range._ Nests from northern New England and           Minnesota (in Alleghanies from North Carolina) to           Canada; winters from Pennsylvania (rarely)           southward to the Gulf States.            Washington, common T.V., Mch.-May; Sept. and Oct.,           Occasional in winter. Ossining, common T.V., Apl.           5-May 13; Sept. 18-Oct. 23; casual in winter.           Cambridge, not uncommon T.V., Apl. and Sept.           15-Nov. 1; occasional W.V. N. Ohio, common T.V.,           Apl. 1-May 20; Sept. 15-Oct. 20. Glen Ellyn,           common T.V., Mch. 31-May 12; Sept. 14-Oct. 13. SE.           Minn., common S.R., Mch. 25-Oct. 19.  This is the mysterious maker of the rows of little holes drilled in even lines, like hieroglyphics, on the trunks of apple and other trees. Using his brush-tipped tongue as a swab, he drinks the sap that oozes from these punctures.  As a migrant the Yellow-belly is not conspicuous. His business takes him into the heart of living trees and he is usually seen only when flying from one to another. His low 'snarling' note attracts the attention of only the observant.  The nest-hole is 25-40 feet up; the 5-7 white eggs are laid in May.   PILEATED WOODPECKER  _Phlœotomus pileatus pileatus_            Next to the nearly extinct Ivory-bill this is the           largest of our Woodpeckers. (L. 17.) Both sexes           have a flaming red crest (reaching the forehead in           the male) the remainder of the plumage being           black, with the throat, a stripe from the bill           down the sides of the neck, and the basal half of           the wing-feathers white; bill horn-color.            _Range._ Southeastern and Gulf States, north to           North Carolina. The Northern Pileated Woodpecker           (_P. p. abieticola_) is found thence northward           into Canada and west to the Pacific. It is a           larger bird, with the white areas larger.  In the south the Pileated is by no means rare and seems not averse to the presence of man; but in the north he retires to the wilder forested areas and we are apt to see him only when we go a-camping. And he is well worth seeing with his flaming crest and powerful bill which, used either as a chisel or drum-stick, produces impressive results. Strangely enough the Pileated's notes resemble those of the Flicker but are louder.  The nest is usually well up; the 3-5 white eggs are laid in April in the south, in May in the north.   RED-HEADED WOODPECKER  _Melanerpes erythrocephalus. Case 3, Figs. 21, 22; Case 6, Fig. 43_            Adults of both sexes have the whole head red;           young, during their first winter, have the head           grayish brown, and a black band across the white           wing-feathers. L. 9¾.            _Range._ Eastern United States, west to Rockies;           local east of the Alleghanies and north of           Pennsylvania.            Washington, rather common S.R., rare W.V.           Ossining, rare P.R., common in fall, Aug. 27-Oct.           12. Cambridge, irregular at all seasons; sometimes           common in fall. N. Ohio, common S.R., Apl.           20-Sept. 25; occasionally winters. Glen Ellyn,           common S.R., Feb. 19-Nov. 6; a few winter. SE.           Minn., common S.R., Apl. 4-Sept. 17; rare in           winter.  Adding to the normal habits of a Woodpecker marked skill as a flycatcher, the Red-head stops his grub-hunting and swings out after a passing insect with a dazzling display of red, white and blue-black. Noisy as he is conspicuous, he beats his log-drum, rolls a tree toad-like _krrring_, or, with tireless persistency utters a whistled croak. In the northeastern states Red-heads are distributed irregularly. They are rarely common in the summer, but in the fall they sometimes appear in numbers. Whenever they come we are soon aware of their presence.  The nest is generally in a dead tree; the 4-6 white eggs are laid in May.   RED-BELLIED WOODPECKER  _Centurus carolinus. Case 3, Fig. 23_            Back and wings evenly barred with black and white,           hence the name 'Zebra'; the female and young have           the front part of the crown gray. L. 9½.            _Range._ Eastern United States, north to southern           Pennsylvania, western New York and southern           Minnesota; casually further.            Washington, locally common P.R. Cambridge, A.V.,           one record. N. Ohio, tolerably common P.R. SE.           Minn., uncommon P.R.  A common, hoarse-voiced resident of orange groves and gardens who with a _chuh-chuh_, jerkily hitches himself upward in the routine of the daily grub hunt. It is rare at the northern part of its range, but resident wherever found. The nest is in dead or living trees; the 4-6 white eggs are laid in late April or early May.   NORTHERN FLICKER  _Colaptes auratus luteus. Case 2, Figs. 21, 22; Case 3, Fig. 20_            The white rump and yellow wing-linings, displayed           in flight; black breast-crescent, spotted           underparts and fairly large size, readily           distinguish this beautiful bird. The female very           properly lacks the male's 'moustache.' L. 12.            _Range._ Eastern North America, from North           Carolina and southern Illinois to Canada and           Alaska. The Southern Flicker (_C. a. auratus_) a           smaller, darker race, inhabits the South Atlantic           and Gulf States.            Washington, common S.R., rare W.V. Ossining,           common S.R., Mch. 25-Oct. 30; a few winter.           Cambridge, very common S.R., common W.V. N. Ohio,           common S.R., Mch. 10-Nov. 15 a few winter. Glen           Ellyn, common S.R., Mch. 7-Dec. 24; a few winter.           SE. Minn., common S.R., Mch. 21-Oct. 16.  Thirty years ago the Flicker, High-hole or Yellow-hammer, was prey of any boy with a gun and was correspondingly wild and little known; now, thanks to the Audubon Society, he is almost as domestic as the Robin. In search of ants and their eggs, he hunts our lawns and even accepts the hospitality of our nest-logs. A great acquisition to our dooryard life is this bird of beautiful colors, quaint habits, and strange notes. His loud, strongly accented call, _kée-yer_, his rapidly repeated mellow _weéchew, weéchew_, possess character even if they lack musical quality.  The Flicker nests in holes and lays from 5-9 white eggs in late April or early May.     GOATSUCKERS, SWIFTS, HUMMINGBIRDS. ORDER MACROCHIRES     NIGHTHAWKS, WHIP-POOR-WILLS, ETC. FAMILY CAPRIMULGIDÆ   CHUCKWILL'S WIDOW  _Antrostromus carolinensis. Case 6, Fig. 40_            A larger, browner bird than the Whip-poor-will,           with branched, not simple bristles at the sides of           the bill.
