He shook his head, slowly, back and forth, his fingers tightening about the animal's neck.  \"Harry, listen,\" Kirk said, watching Loren's squeezing fingers, \"it's over now. You don't have to wait any longer. I'll take you back now. I'll take you home!\"  Loren froze, staring. \"Home?\" he said.  \"That's right,\" Kirk said. \"That's right, Harry.\"  \"_Home_,\" Loren breathed, and his eyes were suddenly like a child's, wide and unbelieving.  \"The waiting's all over,\" Kirk said. \"You don't have to wait any longer.\"  \"I don't have to wait any longer,\" Loren repeated softly, and his hand dropped from the neck of the animal.  Kirk watched Loren and the swaying animal. \"The rocket's ready,\" he said.  Loren's eyes were lost in some distant memory. Gradually Kirk could see the eyes turn shiny with tears. \"Is Annette waiting?\" he asked.  Kirk thought quickly. He knew that what he was going to say shouldn't be said, because he had no right. But he was thinking of his own skin. \"Why, yes, Harry,\" he said slowly. \"I imagine Annette _is_ waiting.\"  Loren let a quick breath come through his teeth. \"Annette,\" he whispered. \"And Dickie?\"  \"Dickie?\" Kirk said.  \"Little Dickie?\" Loren said and he held his breath.  \"Oh, yes,\" Kirk lied. \"Of course.\"  \"I can't ask about Eddie, because we never had the chance,\" Loren said, his eyes still lost. \"I always told Annette that no kid should ever grow up without a brother, only we never had the chance for Eddie.\" Loren reached out absently and touched the brown and yellow neck of the creature. \"I called this fellow Eddie, though. Do you suppose that was all right? He's not very pretty.\"  Kirk nodded, looking at the waving, funnel-shaped head of the animal. \"That was all right, Harry.\"  \"Does she still braid her hair?\" Loren asked, his eyes shiny.  \"What?\" Kirk said.  \"Annette. Does she still braid her hair?\"  \"Why,\" Kirk said slowly, feeling his palms going moist. \"Why wouldn't she, Harry?\"  A faint smile flickered across Loren's lips as he remembered.  Kirk watched one of the creature's claws, out of the corners of his eyes. He opened and closed the fingers of one hand, testing. The claw jerked slightly.  The blood of Kirk's new wound was drying, he knew, because it had been only a surface cut. He wondered how it would be if the thing used its claws with serious intent. Like it must have to make the cut that had been raked into Loren's back. Loren was bending forward now, and Kirk could see the tip end of that scar. Somehow Loren had managed to stay alive and befriend the creature. Eddie. The lidless eyes stared.  Kirk knew that he had to make use of the moment. It could break apart any time, the wildness could return, the unreasoning....  \"Listen, Harry,\" he said, \"we ought to get started, you know. There's no use waiting longer.\"  \"Started?\" Loren said.  \"Of course,\" Kirk said, trying to keep his voice matter-of-fact. \"You're going home.\"  Loren looked at Kirk and his eyes turned suddenly hard and his mouth lost the faint smile. \"I am,\" he stated flatly.  \"Yes,\" Kirk said. \"Of course.\"  \"You're a liar.\"  \"Now, Harry,\" Kirk said, his eyes flickering to the waiting animal. \"I surely wouldn't lie to you.\"  \"You haven't come for me until after all this time, and now you say you surely wouldn't lie to me.\"  It was like standing in a gully, Kirk thought, watching a boulder teetering above you. It tipped this way and that, and you didn't know when or if it was going to come hurtling down. You waited. But Kirk couldn't wait, he knew. He had to do something.  \"Harry, listen. It wasn't easy to find you, don't you see?\" He hoped he was making it sound as though all he had done for the last dozen years of exploring was look for Harry Loren. He wished that the damned thing would stop swaying its ugly head back and forth. Loren's hand was inching out toward the yellow and brown neck.  \"Look, Harry, these things aren't done in a day. We--\"  \"A day!\" Loren hissed. \"A _day_! All this time and you say a _day_!\"  \"No, I'm sorry,\" Kirk said quickly. He wished he could shift out of the cramped half-lying position he was in. \"I didn't mean a day, Harry. I meant it wasn't easy. We didn't know where you were--\" He was talking quickly, whining almost, and he'd never whined before.  Loren's fingers were touching the waving neck.  \"We'd better hurry,\" Kirk said desperately. \"Annette's waiting. And Dickie, of course.\"  Loren blinked.  \"You wouldn't want to keep them waiting any longer, not after all this time, Harry.\"  Loren stroked his fingers slowly down the long neck of the animal.  \"I think,\" Kirk said, almost hoarsely, \"now that I really remember it, Annette _was_ still wearing her hair braided. I remember that now, Harry. Positively.\"  Loren froze the motion of his hand and stared at Kirk. His lips trembled, and then suddenly he put his hands in front of his face. He bent forward, and Kirk felt his nerves jumping, watching the man start to cry.  The animal turned its stare away from Kirk for the first time. It looked at Loren and then slowly raised a claw, touching Loren's shoulder carefully. It made a sound then, a peculiar hissing sound, soft, barely audible. There was no danger in it, or menace, only a pitiful sound.  Loren raised his head a little and brought his hands away from his face. Tears had cut through dust and grime and his face was streaked.  \"Shall we go, Harry?\" Kirk said.  Loren wiped at his eyes, stupidly, without knowing what he was doing. Then he brought his hands down and wiped them across his chest.  \"All right,\" he said. \"Let's go.\" He picked up Kirk's pistol from where he had dropped it on the ground and held it out.  Kirk looked at the gun and at the animal. The claw had been drawn away from Loren's shoulder and again it was poised, ready. \"You keep it, Harry,\" he said.  \"Oh, yes. Of course,\" Loren said. There was a moment of silence as Loren stuck the pistol absently into the waist of his ragged cloth covering, beside the knife. The three of them waited then, Kirk, Loren, and the animal.  \"Eddie?\" Loren said finally. \"Are you ready?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Kirk felt himself smiling in the direction of the animal. He remembered when he was a small boy, going by a house where there had been a mongrel with a flat head and large teeth. He had smiled at that animal as he was doing now. The dog had sensed his fear in spite of the smile.  Loren was standing up slowly, and the animal's head swayed in slow circling motions.  \"All right?\" Loren said.  Kirk glanced at the man, saw the wild, nearly vacant look of the face, the polite tilt of the head. Kirk's palms were wet. Goddamn it, he thought, and he stood up suddenly.  The animal extended a claw, slowly, turning it so that it seemed to wind and circle as it came toward Kirk.  \"_Eddie_,\" Loren said.  The claw came away. Kirk caught his breath.  \"Shall we go?\" Loren said, his eyes shining.  \"Yes,\" Kirk said. \"We'll go, Harry.\" He turned slowly, so that his back was to Loren and the animal. He thought about the comb-like claws and the scar on Loren's back. He thought about Loren's knife and about the pistol.  He wanted to look back as he walked. He wanted to talk, to hear Loren's answer and so know just where he was. More than anything he wanted to break into a run and get into that rocket and get out of here.  He could see the gleam of the rocket finally, but he didn't look back yet. He kept moving. As he got closer he could see Leo, standing near the base of the ship, tall, leaning carelessly against the silver surface, smoking. He wanted to shout to Leo, to tell him for God's sake to wake up and protect him.  They reached the edge of the clearing and Leo, whose careless body had stiffened, waited motionless, one hand on his pistol. Kirk stopped. \"There it is, Harry,\" he said, not turning around. \"There's the ship.\" He waited, half-closing his eyes, breathing slowly.  There was no sound.  \"That's Leo, my friend, Harry,\" Kirk said, putting his palms flat against his thighs. \"Your friend, Harry.\"  Leo, Kirk could see, was still frozen, his eyes slitted to narrow brightness. Kirk began to step into the clearing. \"Hello, there, Leo,\" he said, his voice a tense, grating sound. \"I've brought some friends.\"  Leo was lifting his pistol out of its holster, inchingly.  \"_Friends_,\" Kirk rasped.  Leo's thin eyes flickered and the pistol slid back into the holster.  Kirk turned around slowly, and he saw that Loren had stopped just inside the clearing. The animal remained beside him, its head making its slow circles. Loren was staring up at the rocket and the sun reflecting from the bright surface, came down and shown on Loren's face, deepening the lines there.  \"Leo,\" Kirk said slowly, \"this is Harry Loren and his friend, Eddie. Harry's been here quite a while, waiting for us.\"  \"Oh, yes?\" said Leo, still not moving.  \"That's right, Leo,\" Kirk said. \"Quite a while. What year was it, Harry?\" he said across the clearing. \"What year did you crash?\"  Loren blinked and there were tears again in his eyes. He reached out slowly, and the animal shifted so that its head touched Loren's hand. \"Twenty-four-nineteen.\"  Kirk put his teeth together. \"Twenty-four-nineteen,\" he said.  Loren nodded slowly, his eyes still upon the rocket.  \"Eighteen years,\" Leo said softly.  \"A long time, Leo,\" Kirk said. He thought of a girl with her hair braided about her head, looking up, while Loren had shot into the depths of sky and space. He thought of a little boy called Dickie, standing there, too, watching a fast-disappearing blackness in the sky. He thought about eighteen years, and the fading of youth. A boy becoming a man. Braided hair becoming gray. Memories fading and minds adjusting. New love, new dedication. A world shifting, a universe shifting.  Kirk looked at Eddie, the animal, real and alive, waiting patiently at the tips of Loren's fingers. \"Eddie's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31703"],["title","'Mid Pleasures and Palaces (#2)"],["body"," been with Harry for a long time,\" he said.  \"Oh?\" said Leo quietly.  Loren's hand stroked the brown and yellow head.  \"Harry,\" Kirk said. \"We're going to leave now. Are you ready?\"  Loren was silent.  \"You go up first, will you, Leo?\" Kirk said.  Leo looked at him, a faint frown touching his brow, then he began moving up the ladder to the air lock. Kirk waited until Leo had disappeared into the rocket, then he repeated, \"We're going to leave now, Harry. Are you ready?\"  Loren remained motionless, his hand touching the animal's head. Suddenly he turned then and began moving slowly away through the brush, the brown and yellow creature bobbing beside him with queer rocker-like jumps.  \"Goodby, Harry,\" Kirk said. Finally he turned and climbed up the ladder. When he had gotten into his seat, he said, \"Let's go, Leo,\" and he moved his hands to the controls.         *       *       *       *       *  The rocket settled into the quiet motion of its course through space.  \"But I don't get it,\" Leo said. \"I really don't. All that time, and then all he has to do is walk a dozen yards and get into the rocket and he's going home. That's all he would have to do.\"  \"Why?\" Kirk said.  \"Why?\" said Leo, frowning.  Kirk nodded, looking at the man. \"Why?\"                                                             ...
