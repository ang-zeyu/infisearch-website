THE JEW SPY AGAIN     PREFACE  \"Si Klegg, of the 200th Ind., and Shorty, his Partner,\" were born years ago in the brain of John McElroy, Editor of The National Tribune.  These sketches are the original ones published in The National Tribune, revised and enlarged somewhat by the author. How true they are to nature every veteran can abundantly testify from his own service. Really, only the name of the regiment was invented. There is no doubt that there were several men of the name of Josiah Klegg in the Union Army, and who did valiant service for the Government. They had experiences akin to, if not identical with, those narrated here, and substantially every man who faithfully and bravely carried a musket in defense of the best Government on earth had sometimes, if not often, experiences of which those of Si Klegg are a strong reminder.  The Publishers.   THIS BOOK IS RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED  TO THE RANK AND FILE  OF THE GRANDEST ARMY EVER MUSTERED FOR WAR.     CHAPTER I. OUT ON PICKET  THE BOYS SHOW THE DEACON A NEW WRINKLE IN THE CULINARY ART.  SOME days later, Si had charge of a picket-post on the Readyville Pike, near Cripple Deer Creek. The Deacon went with them, at their request, which accorded with his own inclinations, The weather was getting warmer every day, which made him fidgety to get back to his own fields, though Si insisted that they were still under a foot of snow in Indiana. But he had heard so much about picket duty that, next to battle, it was the thing he most wanted to see. Abraham Lincoln was left behind to care for the \"house.\" He had been a disappointment so far, having developed no strong qualities, except for eating and sleeping, of which he could do unlimited quantities.  \"No use o' takin' him out on picket,\" observed Shorty, \"unless we kin git a wagon to go along and haul rations for him. I understand now why these rebels are so poor; the niggers eat up everything they kin raise. I'm afraid, Deacon, he'll make the Wabash Valley look sick when you turn him loose in it.\"  \"I guess my farm kin stand him,\" said the Deacon proudly. \"It stood Si when he was a growin' boy, though he used, to strain it sometimes.\"  They found a comfortable fence-corner facing{16} south for their \"tent,\" which they constructed by making a roof of cedar boughs resting on a rail running from one angle to another. They laid more boughs down in the corner, and on this placed their blankets, making a bed which the Deacon pronounced very inviting and comfortable. They built a fire in front, for warmth and for cooking, and so set up housekeeping in a very neat and soldier-like way.  [Illustration: MR. KLEGG ENJOYS SOLID COMFORT. 16]  The afternoon passed without special incident. Shorty came in with a couple of chickens, but the{17} Deacon had learned enough to repress any questions as to where and how he got them. He soon became more interested in his preparations for cooking them. He had built a big fire in a hole in the ground, and piled a quantity of dry cedar on this. Then he cut off the heads and legs of the chickens, and, getting some mud from the side of the road, proceeded to cover each, feathers and all, with a coating nearly an inch thick.  \"What in the world do you mean by that, Shorty?\" asked the Deacon in surprise.  \"He's all right. Pap,\" assured Si. \"He'll show you a new wrinkle in chicken-fixin' that you kin teach mother when you go home. She knows more about cookin' than any other woman in the world, but I'll bet she's not up to this dodge.\"  The fire had by this time burned down to a heap of glowing embers. The boys scraped a hole in these, laid on it their two balls of mud, then carefully covered them with live coals and piled on a little more wood.  \"I'll say right now,\" said the Deacon, \"that I don't think much o' that way. Why didn't you take their feathers off and clean out their innards? Seems to me that's a nasty way.\"  \"Wait and see,\" said Shorty sententiously.  Si had mixed some meal into a dough in the half-canteens he and Shorty carried in their haversacks. He spread this out on a piece of sheet-iron, and propped it up before the fire. In a little while it was nicely browned over, when Si removed it from the sheet-iron, turned it over, and browned the other side. He repeated this until he had a sufficiency of{18} \"hoe cakes\" for their supper. A kettle of good, strong coffee had been boiling on the other side of the fire while this was going on. Then they carefully raked the embers off, and rolled out two balls of hard-baked clay. Waiting for these to cool a little, they broke them. The skin and feathers came off with the pieces and revealed deliciously savory, sweet meat, roasted just to a turn. The intestines had shriveled up with the heat into little, hard balls, which were thrown away.  \"Yum--yum--yum,\" said Shorty, tearing one of the chickens in two, and handing a piece to the Deacon, while Si gave him a sweet, crisp hoe cake and a cup of strong coffee. \"Now, this's what you might call livin'. Never beat that cookin' in any house that had a roof. Only do that when you've stars in the roof of your kitchen.\"  \"It certainly is splendid,\" admitted the Deacon. \"I don't think Maria could've done better.\"  It was yet light when they finished their supper, filled their pipes, and adjusted themselves for a comfortable smoke. One of the men came back and said:  \"Corporal, there's a rebel on horseback down the road a little ways who seems to be spying on us. We've noticed him for some little time. He don't come up in good range, and we haven't fired at him, hopin' he'd come closer. Better come and take a look at him.\"  \"Don't do anything to scare him off,\" said Si. \"Keep quiet. Me and Shorty'll sneak down through the field, out of sight, and git him.\"  They picked up their guns and slipped out under{19} the cover of the undergrowth to where they could walk along the fence, screened by the heavy thicket of sumach. Catching the excitement of the occasion, the Deacon followed them at a little distance.  Without discovery Si and Shorty made their way to a covert within an easy 50 yards of where the horseman sat rather uneasily on a fine, mettled animal. They got a good look at him. He was a young, slender man, below medium hight, with curly, coalblack hair, short whiskers, a hooked nose, and large, full eyes. He wore a gray suit of rather better make and material than was customary in the rebel army. He had a revolver in his belt and a carbine slung to his saddle, but showed no immediate intention of using either. His right hand rested on his thigh, and his eyes were intently fixed on the distant picket-post.  \"A rebel scout,\" whispered Si. \"Shall we knock him over, and then order him to surrender, or halt him first, and then shoot?\"  \"He can't git away,\" said Shorty. \"I have him kivered. You kivver his hoss's head. Then call him down.\"  Si drew his sights fine on the horse's head and yelled:  \"Surrender, there, you dumbed rebel.\"  [Illustration: \"SURRENDER, THERE, YOU DUMBED REBEL.\" 21]  The man gave a quick start, a swift glance at the blue uniforms, and instantly both hands went up.  \"That is all right, boys. Don't shoot. I'm a friend,\" he called in a strong German accent.  \"Climb down off o' that boss, and come here, and do it mighty sudden,\" called out Si, with his finger still on the trigger.{20}  The horse became restive at the sound of strange voices, but the man succeeded in dismounting, and taking his reins in his hand, led the horse up to the fence.  \"Very glad to see you, boys,\" said he, surveying their blue garments with undisguised satisfaction, and putting out his other hand to shake.  \"Take off that revolver, and hand it here,\" ordered the wary Shorty, following the man with the muzzle of his gun. The man slipped his arm through the reins, unbuckled his revolver, and handed it to Shorty. Si jumped over the fence and seized the carbine.  \"Who are you, and where did you come from?\" asked Si, starting the man up the road toward the post.  \"What rechiment do you belong to?\" asked the stranger, warily.  \"We belong to Co. Q, 200th Injianny, the best regiment in Gen. Rosecrans's army,\" answered Si proudly, that the captive might understand where the honor of his taking belonged.  \"That is all right,\" said the stranger, with an air of satisfaction. \"The 200th Indianny is a very good regiment. I saw them whip John Morgan's cavalry at Green River. Clumsy farmer boys, but shoot like born devils.\"  \"But who are you, and where did you come from?\" repeated Si impatiently.  \"I'm all right. I'm Levi Rosenbaum of Gen. Rosecrans's secret service. I got some news for him.\"  \"You have?\" said Si suspiciously. \"Why didn't you ride right in and tell it to him? What've you{21} bin hangin' around here all afternoon, watchin' our post for?\"  \"I wasn't sure you was there. I was told that the Yankee pickets was going to be pushed out to Cripple Deer Creek to-day, but I didn't know it for sure. I was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31773"],["title","Si Klegg, Book 3 (#1)"],["body","that the rebels was there yet. Jim Jones, of the secret service, had agreed to come out this afternoon and wave a flag if it was all{22} right. I was waiting for his sign. But he is probably drunk. He always gets so when he reaches camp.\"  The Deacon joined them in the road, and gave a searching glance at the prisoner.  \"Ain't you a Jew?\" he inquired presently. \"Ain't your name Rosenbaum? Didn't you go through Posey County, Ind., a year or two ago, with a wagon, sellin' packs o' cloth to the farmers?\"  \"I'm an American citizen,\" said the man proudly, \"the same as the rest of you. My religion is Hebrew. I don't know and don't care what your religion is. Every man has the religion that suits him. My name is Rosenbaum. I did sell cloth in Posey County, unt all over Indianny. It was good cloth, too, unt I sold it at a bargain.\"  \"It certainly was good cloth, and cheap,\" admitted the Deacon. \"What in the world are you doin' down here in them clothes?\"  \"I'm doing just what these men are doing here in their cloze,\" answered Rosenbaum. \"I'm trying to serve the country. I'm doing it different from them, because I'm built different from them. I hope I'm doing it well. But I'm awfully hungry. Got anything to eat? Just a cup of coffee and a cracker? Don't care for any pork.\"  \"Yes, we'll give you something to eat,\" said Shorty. \"I think there's some of our chicken left. You'll find that good.\"  \"How did you cook that?\" said Rosenbaum, looking at the tempting morsel suspiciously.  Shorty explained.{23}  \"Thanks; I can't eat it,\" said Rosenbaum with a sigh. \"It ain't kosher.\"  \"What the devil's that?\" asked Shorty.  \"It's my religion. I can't explain. Send for the Officer of the Guard to take me to Headquarters,\" answered Rosenbaum, sipping his coffee.    CHAPTER II. ROSENBAUM, THE SPY  THE JEW TELLS THE THRILLING STORY OF HIS ADVENTURE.  THE Officer of the Guard was a long time in coming, and Mr. Rosenbaum grew quite chatty and communicative, as they sat around the bright fire of cedar logs and smoked.  \"Yes,\" he said, \"I have been in the secret service ever since the beginning of the war--in fact, before the war, for I began getting news for Frank Blair in the Winter before the war. They say Jews have no patriotism. That's a lie. Why should they have no patriotism for countries where they were treated like dogs? In Germany, where I was born, they treated us worse than dogs. They made us live in a little, nasty, pig-pen of an alley; we had to go in at sundown, unt stay there; we had to wear a different cloze from other folks, unt we didn't dare to say our souls were our own to any dirty loafer that insulted us.  \"Here we are treated like men, unt why shouldn't we help to keep the country from breaking up? Jews ought to do more than anybody else, unt I made up my mind from the very first that I was going to do all that I could. The Generals have told me that I could do much better for the country in the secret service than as a soldier; they could get plenty of soldiers unt but few spies.\"{25}  \"Now you're shoutin',\" said Shorty. \"They kin git me to soldier as long as the war lasts, for the askin', but I wouldn't be a spy 10 minutes for a corn-basket full o' greenbacks. I have too much regard for my neck. I need it in my business.\"  \"You a spy,\" said Si derisively. \"You couldn't spy for sour apples. Them big feet o' your'n 'd give you dead away to anybody that'd ever seen you before.\"  \"Spyin' isn't the business that any straightfor'rd man,\"--the Deacon began to say in tones of cold disapproval, and then he bethought him of courtesy to the stranger, and changed hastily--\"that I'd like to do. It's entirely too resky.\"  \"O, it's jest as honorable as anything else. Pap,\" said Si, divining his father's thought. \"All's fair in love and war. We couldn't git along without spies. They're as necessary as muskets and cannon.\"  \"Indeed they are,\" said Mr. Rosenbaum earnestly; \"you wouldn't know what to do with your muskets and cannon if the spies didn't tell you where the rebels were, unt how many there was of them. I go out unt get information that it would cost hundreds of lives to get, unt may save thousands of lives, unt all that it costs is one poor little Jew's neck, when they drop on to him some day, unt leave him swinging from a tree. But when that time comes, I shall make no more complaint than these other poor boys do, who get their heads knockt off in battle. I'm no better than they are. My life belongs to the country the same as theirs, unt this free Government is worth all our lives, unt more, too.\"  His simple, sincere patriotism touched the Deacon{26} deeply. \"I'd no idee that there was so much o' the man in a Jew,\" he said to himself. Then he asked the stranger:  \"How did you come to go into the spy business, Mr. Rosenbaum?\"  \"Well, I was in St. Louis in the Clothing pizniss, unt you know it was purty hot there. All the Germans were for the Union, unt most of the Americans unt Irish seemed to be Secessionists. I sided with the Germans, but as nobody seemed to think that a Jew had any principles or cared for anything but the almighty dollar, everybody talked right out before me, unt by keepin' my ears wide open I got hold of lots of news, which I took straight to General Lyon. I got well acquainted with him, and he used to send me here and there to find out things for him. I'd sell gray uniforms and other things to the Secessionists; they'd talk to one another right before me as to what was being done, and I'd keep my ears wide open all the time, though seemed to be only thinking about the fit and the buttons and the gold lace.  \"Then General Lyon wanted to find out just exactly how many men there was in Camp Jackson--no guesswork--no suppose. I took 2,000 of my business cards, printed on white, and 1,000 printed on gray paper. I went through the whole camp. To every man in uniform I give a white card; to every man without a uniform, who seemed to be there for earnest, I give a gray card. When I got back I counted my cards in General Lyon's office, unt found I'd give out 500 white cards unt 200 gray{27} ones. Then General Lyon took out about 3,000 men, unt brought the whole crowd back with him.\"  \"Then General Lyon,\" continued Rosenbaum, \"sent me out from Springfield, Mizzouri, to see how many men old Pap Price unt Ben McCullough had gathered up against him from Mizzouri, Arkansaw, Texas unt the plains. Holy Moses, I was scared when I saw the pile of them. The whole world seemed to be out there, yipping unt yelling for Jeff Davis, drinking raw sod-corn whisky, making secession speeches, unt shooting at marks.  \"I rode right into them, unt pretended that I was looking for Mexican silver dollars to take to Mexico to buy powder unt lead for the rebel army. I had a lot of new Confedrit notes that I'd got from my cousin, who was in the tobacco business in Memphis. They was great curiosities, unt every man who had a Mexican dollar wanted to trade it for a Confedrit dollar.  \"There was no use tryin' to count the men--might as well have tried to count the leaves on the trees, so I begun to count the regiments. I stuck a pin in my right lapel for every Mizzouri regiment, one in my left lapel for every Arkansaw regiment, one in my vest for every one from Texas. I had black pins for the cannons. I was getting along very well, when I run across Bob Smiles, a dirty loafer, who had been a customer in St. Louis. He wouldn't pay me, unt I had to get out a writ unt levy on his clothes just as he was dressing to go to a quadroon ball.  \"I left him with only a necktie, which was worth nothing to me, as it had been worn and soiled. He was very sore against me, unt I was not surprised.{28}  \"It made me sick at my stomach when I saw him come up.  \"'Hello, you damn Dutch Jew,' he said. 'What are you doing here?'  \"I tried to be very pleasant, unt I put out my hand unt said, with my best smile:  \"'Good gracious. Bob, how glad I am to see you. When did you get here? Are you well? How are the other boys? Who's here? Where are you stopping?'  \"But I might as well have tried to make friends with a bull dog in front of a farm house where all the people had gone away.  \"'Go to blazes,' he said. 'None of your bizniss how I am, how I got here, or how the other boys are. Better not let them find out you're here. They'll take it out of your Jew hide for the way you used to skin them in St. Louis. I want to know what the devil you are doing here?'  \"'Now, Mister Smiles,' I said, pleasant as a May morning, 'that's not the way to talk to me. You know I got up the stylishest clothes unt the best fits in St. Louis. We had a little trouble, it is true. It was nothing, though. Just a little business dispute. You know I always thought you one of the very nicest men in St. Louis, unt I said so, even to the Squire unt to the Constable.'  \"'Go to the devil, you Savior-killing Jew,' said he. 'Shut up your mouth, or I'll stuff a piece of pork in it. I want to know at once what you are doing here? Where did you come from?'  \"'I come from Memphis,' said I. 'I'm in the service of the Southern Confedrisy. General Pillow sent{29} me to gather up all the Mexican dollars I could find, to send to Mexico to buy ammunition.'  \"'It's a lie, of course,' said he. 'A Jew'd rather lie than eat, any day. Then you're one of them St. Louis Dutch--them imported Hessians. They're all dead against us. They all ought to be killed. I ought to kill you myself for being so cussed mean to me.'  \"He put his hand on his revolver in a way that made my breakfast sour in my stomach, but then I knew that Bob Smiles was a great blowhard, unt his bark was much worse than his bite. In St. Louis he was always going to fight somebody unt kill somebody, but he never done neither. Quite a crowd gathered around, unt Bob blew off to them, unt they yelled, 'Hang the Jew spy. Kill the damn rascal,' and other things that made me unhappy. But what made my flesh crawl was to see a man who wasn't saying"]]]
