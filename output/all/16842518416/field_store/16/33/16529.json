Because, in the latter instance, I'm not sure we should interfere. It may be her only chance.\"  [Illustration]  \"Carl!\" his wife cried indignantly. \"That's a horrid thing to say! You must rescue her at once!\"  \"Oh, I suppose so,\" he said, then gave his wife a nasty little grin that he knew would irritate her. \"It isn't that she's unattractive, my dear, in case you hadn't noticed, though she's pretty well past the bloom of youth--\"  \"_Will_ you stop making leering noises and go save her or _not_?\"  \"I was coming to that. It's just that she persists in using her Ph.D. as a club to beat men into respectful pulps. Men don't like being beaten into respectful pulps, whether by a man or a woman. Now if she'd only learned that other people have feelings--\"  \"If you don't stop lecturing and go, I will!\" his wife threatened.  \"All right, all right,\" he said wearily. \"Come on, Mortland.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The two scientists slogged through the steamy, odorous jungle of Venus and soon reached the lizard-man, who, weighed down by his captive, had not been able to travel as fast.  \"You blast him,\" the professor told Mortland. \"Try not to hit Miss Anspacher, if you can manage it.\"  \"Er--I've never fired one of these things before,\" Mortland said. \"Can't stand having my eardrums blasted. However, here goes.\" He pointed his weapon at the lizardlike creature in a gingerly manner. \"Ah--hands up,\" he ordered. \"Only fair to give the--well, blighter a sporting chance,\" he explained to Professor Bernardi.  To their amazement, the lizard-man promptly dropped Miss Anspacher into the lavender-colored mud and put up his hands. Miss Anspacher gave an indignant yelp.  \"Seems intelligent in spite of the kidnaping,\" Mortland commented. \"But how does he happen to understand English? We're the only expedition ever to have reached Venus ... that I know of, anyway.\" He and the professor stared at each other in consternation. \"There may have been a secret expedition previously and perhaps they left a--a base or something, which would explain why--\"  \"If you two oafs would stop speculating, you might help me out of here!\" Miss Anspacher remarked in her customary snappish tone. Professor Bernardi leaped forward to obey. \"You don't have to pull quite so hard! I haven't taken root yet!\" She came out of the mud with a sound like two whales kissing. She brushed hopelessly at her once-white blouse and shorts. \"Oh, dear, I look a mess!\"  Professor Bernardi did not comment, being engaged in slapping at a small winged creature--about the size of a bluejay, but looking like a cross between a bat and a mosquito--that seemed interested in taking a bite out of him. It escaped his flapping hand and flew to the top of Mortland's sun helmet, where it glared at the professor.  \"Since you seem to understand English,\" Miss Anspacher said to the lizard-man through a mouthful of hairpins, \"perhaps you will be so kind as to explain the meaning of this outrage?\"  \"I was smitten,\" the alien replied suavely. \"Passion made me forget myself.\"  Professor Bernardi looked thoughtfully at him. \"A prior expedition isn't the answer. It wouldn't have troubled to educate you so thoroughly. Therefore, the explanation is that you pick up English by reading our minds. Correct?\"  The lizard-man turned an embarrassed olive. \"Yes.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Now that he was able to give the creature a more thorough inspection, Bernardi saw that he really didn't look too much like a lizard. He definitely appeared to be wearing clothes of some kind, which, in the Venusian heat, indicated a particularly refined degree of civilization--unless, of course, the squamous skin protected him from the heat as well as the humidity.  More than that, though, he was humanoid in almost a Hollywood way. He had a particularly fine profile and an athletic physique, which, oddly, his scales seemed to enhance, much like a movie idol dressed in fine-meshed Medieval armor. Naturally, he had a tail, but it was as well proportioned as a kangaroo's, though shorter and more graceful, and it struck Professor Bernardi as a particularly handsome and useful gadget.  For one thing, the people from Earth were standing uncomfortably in the slippery mud, while the lizard-man was using his tail much in the fashion of a spectator stool, leaning back against it almost in a sitting position, with his armor-shod feet supporting him comfortably. For another, the tail undoubtedly served for balance and the added push of a walking stick and perhaps for swift attack or getaway. Very practical and attractive, the professor concluded--too bad Man had relinquished his tail when climbing down from the trees.  \"Thank you,\" the saurian said with uneasy modesty, looking at him. \"Good of you to think so. You are a fairly intelligent species, aren't you?\"  \"Fairly,\" the professor acknowledged, preoccupied with a clever idea. Perhaps existence on Venus wasn't going to be as unpleasant as he had anticipated. \"From reading my mind, you know what this blaster can do, don't you?\"  \"I'm afraid so.\"  \"Then you know what I expect of you?\"  \"Yes, sahib. I'se comin', massa. To hear is to obey, effendi.\" The creature turned and went briskly back toward the camp, leaving the others to stumble after him.  Mrs. Bernardi gave a shriek as his handsome scaled form emerged from the greenish-white underbrush, haloed in luminous yellow mist. Algol, the ship's cat, prudently took sanctuary behind her, then peered out to see what was going on and whether there was likely to be anything in it for him.  \"This is our native bearer,\" Professor Bernardi explained as the three scientists burst out of the jungle.  \"My name is Jrann-Pttt.\" The creature bowed low. \"At your service, madame.\"  \"Oh, Carl!\" Mrs. Bernardi clapped her hands. \"He's just perfect! So thoughtful of you to find one that speaks English! I do hope you can cook, Pitt?\"  \"I will do my best, madame.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Algol daintily picked his way through the mud toward the saurian, sniffed him with judicial deliberation; then, deciding that anyone who smelled so much like the better class of fish must be All Right, rubbed against his legs.  \"Well,\" remarked Miss Anspacher, using the side of the spaceship as a mirror by which to redden her somewhat prissy lips, \"that makes it practically unanimous, doesn't it?\"  \"All except Professor Bernardi,\" said Jrann-Pttt, looking at the scientist with what might have been a smile. \"He doesn't like me.\"  \"I see that your telepathic powers are not quite accurate,\" the professor returned. \"I do not dislike you; I distrust you.\"  \"The fact that the two terms are not entirely synonymous in your language would argue a certain degree of incipient civilization,\" the lizard-man observed.  \"You know, Carl,\" Mrs. Bernardi whispered, \"he has an awfully funny way of talking, for a native.\"  \"Frankly I don't like this at all, Professor,\" Captain Greenfield said, mopping his brow with a limp handkerchief. \"If I hadn't been off looking for a better berth for the ship--all this mud worries me--this'd never have happened.\"  \"You mean you would have let the lizard get away with Miss Anspacher?\"  The big man's face flushed crimson. \"I don't think that's funny, Professor.\"  Bernardi quickly changed the subject, for he realized that the captain, being by far the most muscular of the party, was not a man to trifle with. \"Tell me, Greenfield, did you succeed in finding a better spot for the ship? I must admit I'm worried about that mud myself.\"  \"Only remotely dry spot around is an outcropping 'bout two kilometers away,\" Greenfield said grudgingly. He shifted his camp stool in a futile search for shade. Even though the sun never penetrated the thick layer of clouds, the yellow light diffused through them was blinding. \"Might be big enough, but it's not level. Could blast it smooth, but that'd take at least a week--Earth time.\"  Bernardi pulled his damp shirt away from his body. \"Well, I daresay we'll be all right where we are, if we're not assailed by any violent forces of nature. On Earth, this might be a monsoon climate.\"  \"If you ask me, that monster is more of a danger than any monsoon.\"  Bernardi sighed. Although by far the most competent officer available for the job of spaceship captain, Greenfield was not quite the man he would have chosen to be his associate for months on end. Still, beggars--as Miss Anspacher might have eloquently put it--could not be choosers. \"What makes you say that?\" he asked, trying to set an example of tolerance.  \"Don't like the idea of him cooking for us,\" the captain said stubbornly. \"Might poison us all in our beds.\"  \"Well, don't eat in your bed,\" suggested Mortland, strolling out of the airlock in the company of the cat. Algol, however, finding that the spot beside the captain's camp stool was as dry as anything could be on Venus, decided to turn back.         *       *       *       *       *  \"The difficulty is easily overcome, Captain,\" the professor said, still holding on to his patience. \"You can continue to cook your own meals from the tinned and packaged foods on board ship. The rest of us will eat fresh native foods prepared by Jrann-Pttt.\"  \"But why,\" Miss"]]]
