Not that he cared a fig about the mules, but that he wanted to \"jump\" somebody.  [Illustration: STOP BEATIN' THEM MULES' 22]  \"Go to brimstone blazes, you freckle-faced Posey County refugee,\" responded Groundhog, the teamster, in the same fraternal spirit. \"I'm drivin' this here team.\" He gave the nigh-swing mule a \"welt\" that would have knocked down anything else than a swing mule.  \"If you don't stop beatin' them mules, by thunder, I'll make you.\"  \"Make's a good word,\" responded Groundhog, giving the off-swing mule a wicked \"biff.\" \"I never see anything come out of Posey County that could make me do what I didn't want to.\"  Si struck at him awkwardly. He was so hampered by his weight of soggy clothes that there was little force or direction to his blow. The soaked teamster returned the blow with equal clumsiness.  The other boys came up and pulled them apart.  \"We ain't no time for sich blamed nonsense,\" they growled. \"We've got to git this here wagon up to the company, an' we'll have the devil's own time doin' it. Quit skylarkin' an' git to work.\"  They looked around for something with which to make pries. Every rail and stick within a quarter of a mile of the road was gone. They had been used up the previous Summer, when both armies had passed over the road.  There was nothing to do but plod off through mud and rain to the top of a hill in the distance, where there was a fence still standing. A half an hour later each of the six came back with a heavy rail on his shoulder. They pried the wagon out and got it started, only to sink again in another quagmire a few hundred yards further on.  Si and the boys went back to get their rails, but found that they had been carried off by another squad that had a wagon in trouble. There was nothing to do but to make another toilsome journey to the fence for more rails.  After helping the wagon out they concluded it{24} would be wiser to carry their rails with them a little way to see if they would be needed again.  They were many times that afternoon. As dark ness came on Si, who had the crowning virtue of hopefulness when he fully recognized the unutterable badness of things, tried to cheer the other boys up with assertions that they would soon get into camp, where they would find bright, warm fires with which to dry their clothes, and plenty of hot coffee to thaw them out inside.  The quick-coming darkness added enormously to the misery of their work. For hours they struggled along the bottomless road, in the midst of a ruck of played-out mules and unutterably tired, disgusted men, laboring as they were to get wagons ahead.  Finally they came up to their brigade, which had turned off the road and gone into line-of-battle in an old cotton-field, where the mud was deeper, if possible, than in the road.  \"Where's the 200th Ind.?\" called out Si.  \"Here, Si,\" Shorty's voice answered.  \"Where's the fires, Shorty,\" asked Si, with sinking heart.  \"Ain't allowed none,\" answered his partner gloomily. \"There's a rebel battery on that hill there, and they shoot every time a match is lighted. What've you got there, a rail? By George, that's lucky! We'll have something to keep us out of the mud.\"  They laid down the rail and sat upon it.  \"Shorty,\" said Si, as he tried to arrange his aching bones to some comfort on the rail, \"I got mad at you for cussin' the Wabash this morning. I ain't a fluid talker such as you are, an' I can't find words to say{25} what I think. But I jest wisht you would begin right here and cuss everybody from Abe Lincoln down to Corporal Si Klegg, and everything from the Wabash in Injianny down to the Cumberland in Tennessee. I'd like to listen to you.\"    CHAPTER II. SECOND DAY'S MARCH  THE LONG COLUMN CRAWLS THROUGH RAIN AND COLD TO MURFREESBORO.  SI KLEGG was generous with his rail, as he was with all things among his comrades. He selected the softest part, in the center, for him self and Shorty, and then invited the other boys to share its hospitalities. They crowded up close to him and Shorty on either side, and there seemed to come a little warmth and dryness from the close contact of their bodies.  Si was so mortally tired that it seemed a great relief just to sit still and rest, though the rain continued to pour down.  Shorty fished some hardtack and fried pork out of his haversack, and also gave him a handful of ground coffee. Si munched the crackers and meat, with an occasional nip at the coffee. His spirits began to rise just a trifle. He was too healthy in body and mind to be totally downcast for long.  \"'Tis n't much of a supper,\" he said to himself, \"but it beats nothin' at all miles and miles. Besides, I was mighty lucky in gettin' the biggest rail. Some that the other boys has are no good at all. They'll let 'em right down in the mud. And most o' the boys has no rails at all. I'm awfully sorry for 'em.\"  Then he began to wonder if they were not {27}overcautious about the nearness of the enemy. He had been in the army just long enough to have contempt for the stories that were always current with a certain class about the proximity and strength of the enemy. Shorty was not of that kind; but, then, Shorty was as liable to be imposed upon as anybody.  \"How do you know there's a rebel battery on the hill out there?\" he finally asked Shorty.  \"They belted into the Oshkosh Terrors, out there to our right, killed a mule, scared two teamsters to death, and knocked over three or four kittles of coffee. It was awful unlucky about the coffee,\" an swered Shorty.  \"How long ago was that?\"  \"O, several hours ago. Just after we turned into the field, and long before you come up.\"  \"Mebbe they've gone off now. Mebbe, if they're there yet, their ammynition's so soaked that they can't shoot. What do you say to startin' a little fire? It'd be an immense comfort. Unless we can dry out a little we'll be soaked into such mush before morning that we can't keep our shape, and they'll have to ladle us up with dippers.\"  \"It's strictly against orders.\"  \"You mean it was against orders several hours ago. I can't see nothin' on that hill over there. I've been watchin' for half an hour. There's nothin' movin'. Mebbe the orders has been changed, an' you haint heard about it,\" persisted Si. \"Mebbe the Orderly that was bringing 'em 's stuck in the mud. Mebbe the rain's soaked 'em so's they can't be read. If anybody's got any dry matches I'm goin' to chance{28} it.\"  Word was passed along the rail, and at length one of the boys was found to have some matches in a tin box which was proof against the rain.  Si got out his knife and whittled down a corner of the rail until he came to the dry part, and got off some shavings. Splinters were contributed by the others, and after several failures a small flame was started.  \"Here, what in the world are you men doing there?\" came in the stentorian tones of the Colonel, who it startled Si to discover was sitting a short distance behind him. \"Put that light out this instant.\"  Even before the command could be obeyed, four great flashes burned out like lightning in the murky darkness on the hill-top. Four cannon roared, and four shells screeched toward Si and his companions, who instinctively toppled over backward into the mud. One of the shells struck in the mud a few yards in front, burst with a deafening report, and sent over them a deluge of very wet Tennessee real estate.  \"The battery's out there yit, Si,\" said Shorty, as they gathered themselves up and carefully stamped out every spark of fire.  \"It's 'tendin' strictly to business,\" remarked Wes Williams.  \"Its ammynition don't seem to be a mite wet,\" added Jim Hutchinson.  \"There, you see, now,\" said the Colonel sternly. \"I'll tie up by the thumbs the next man that dares scratch a match.\"  \"You jest kin if I do,\" muttered Si, scraping off some of the superabundant mud, and resuming his{29} seat on the rail. \"This dog's cured of suckin' eggs.\" He set the butt of his gun down in front of him, clasped his hands around the barrel, leaned his head on them, and went to sleep.  He was so tired that he could have slept anywhere and in any position. He was dimly conscious during the night that the rain ceased and that it turned bitter cold. He was not going to wake up for trifles like that, though. When Si went to sleep he devoted himself entirely to that and nothing else. It {30} was one thing that he never allowed any interference with.  But with the first gray streaks of dawn in the east some uneasy, meddlesome spirit in the 200th Ind. happened to be awake, and he awakened the Adjutant, who cuffed and shook the headquarters drummer until he awakened and beat the reveille. This aroused the weary Orderly-Sergeants, who started upon the task of getting up the bone-wracked, aching-muscled men. In 10 minutes there was enough discontent and bitter grumbling in the 200th Ind. to have furnished forth a new political party.  The awakening process finally reached those of Co. Q who had roosted on Si's rail all night.  Si vigorously insisted on being let alone; that he hadn't been asleep five minutes, and that, anyhow, it was not his turn to go on guard. But the Orderly-Sergeant of Co. Q was a persistent fellow, and would not be denied.  When Si finally tried to rise he found that, in addition to the protests of his stiff legs, he was pinned firmly down. Feeling around to ascertain the cause, he discovered that the tail of his overcoat and his shoes had become deeply imbedded in the mud, and frozen solidly there. Shorty was in the same fix.  [Illustration: FROZEN IN THE MUD 29]  \"Got to shuck yourself out o' your overcoat, and leave them gunboats anchored where they are,\" remarked Shorty, doing as he said, and falling in for roll-call in his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31772"],["title","Si Klegg, Book 2 (#2)"],["body"," feet.  After roll-call Si got a hatchet from one of the boys and chopped his and Shorty's shoes out. The overcoats were left for subsequent effort, for the first thing was to get some wood and water and cook breakfast.{31}  The morning was bitter cold and the sky overcast, but Si felt that this was a thousand times better than the cheerless rain, which seemed to soak his very life out of him.  He pounded most of the frozen mud off his shoes, picked up the camp-kettle, and started off for wood and water, broke the ice on the creek, took a good wash, and presently came back with a load of dry pine and a kettle full of water.  \"My joints feel like I think an old wagon does after it's gone about a year without greasing,\" he remarked to Shorty, who had a good fire going; \"but I think that after I get about a quart o' hot coffee, inside of me, with a few pounds o' pork and crackers, I'll be nearly as good as new again. My, how good that grub does smell! An' did you ever see such a nice fire?\"  He chopped his and Shorty's overcoats out while Shorty was cooking breakfast, and when at last he sat down on one end of his rail and ate enough toasted hard bread and crisp fried side-meat to feed a small family for a week, washing it down with something near a quart of black coffee sweetened with coarse brown sugar, life began again to have some charms for him.  \"You're sure that dumbed battery's gone that shot at us last night, are you, Shorty?\" he said, as he drained his cup, fastened it again to the strap of his haversack, and studied the top of the hill with a critical eye.  \"They say it is,\" said Shorty, between bites. \"While you was down at the crick a man come over from the camp o' the Oshkosh Terrors, and said two o' their{32} companies 'd been onto the hill, and the rebels had gone.\"  \"I wish them Oshkosh fellers'd mind their own business,\" said Si, irritably, as he picked up his gun and began rubbing the mud and rust off. \"They're entirely too fresh for a new regiment. That battery was none of theirs. It was ours, right in our front, an' if they'd let it alone till after breakfast we'd gone up and taken it. It was just the right size for the 200th Ind., and we wanted a chance at it. But now they've had to stick in and run it off.\"  \"Don't worry,\" said Shorty, fishing out another cracker; \"it hasn't gone too far. 'Taint lost. You'll have a chance at it some other time. Mebbe to-day yet.\"  The army began to move out very promptly, and soon the 200th Ind. was called to take its place in the long column that crawled over the hills and across the valleys toward Murfreesboro, like some gigantic blue serpent moving toward his prey.  Miles ahead of the 200th Ind.'s place in the column the rebels were offering annoying disputation of farther progress. Lines as brown as the dried leaves on the oak trees would form on the hilltops, batteries would gallop into position, and there would be sharp bangs by the cannon and a sputter of musketry-fire.  Then the long, blue serpent would wriggle out of the road into the fields, as if coiling to strike. Union batteries would rush on to hilltops and fire across valleys at the rebel cannon, and a sputter of musketry would answer that from the leaf-brown ranks on the hilltops, which would dissolve and march back{33} to the next hilltop, where the thing would be gone over again. The 200th Ind. would occasionally see one of these performances as it marched over and down one of the hills.  As the afternoon was wearing away the 200th{34} Ind. kept nearing the front, where this was going on. Finally, when the dull day was shading into dusk, and the brigade ahead of it was forming in the field at the foot of a hill to open a bickering fire against the dun line at the top, the 200th Ind. was taken off the road and marched away over to the left, where it was put into line in front of a dense grove of cedars.  \"Capt. McGillicuddy,\" commanded the Colonel to the Captain of Co. Q, \"advance your company as skirmishers to the edge of the cedars, and send a Corporal and five men into the thicket to see if there is anything there.\"  \"Corporal Klegg,\" said the Captain, \"take five men off the left of the company and go in and see what's in there.\"  Si was instantly fired with the importance of the duty assigned him. He sent two of his men to the left, two to the right, while he and Shorty, a little distance apart, struck for the heart of the thicket. They made their way with difficulty through the dense chaparral for some minute's, and then stopped, as they heard voices and the crashing of branches in front.  Si's heart thumped against his ribs. He looked over to his left, and saw Shorty standing there peering earnestly into the brush, with his gun cocked and ready to fire. He ran over to him and whispered:  \"What do you see, Shorty?\"  [Illustration: WHAT DO YOU SEE, SHORTY?' 33]  \"Nothin' yit, but I expect to every minute,\" replied Shorty, without turning his intent eyes. Si's gun was already cocked, and he bent his head {35}forward eagerly, to get a better view. But he could see nothing, except that the tops of the bushes were shaking.  \"Shall we skip back an' report?\" asked Si.  \"I ain't goin' till I see something,\" said Shorty, stoutly.  \"Nor me,\" echoed Si, rather ashamed that he had suggested it.  \"Steady, there; steady, on the right! Come for ward with that left company,\" called out a stern voice in front.  \"Must be a full regiment in there,\" whispered Si, craning his neck still farther. The tramping and crashing increased.  \"Steady, men, I tell you! Steady! Press on the center,\" commanded the unseen Colonel. \"Forward! Forward!\"  In spite of his perturbation, Si noticed that the sounds did not seem to be coming any nearer.  \"We must get a squint at 'em,\" he said, desperately, to Shorty. \"Let's git down an' crawl forward. There must be an openin' somewhere.\"  They got down on their hands and knees, so as to avoid as many as possible of the thickly-interlaced branches. Soon they came to a rift which led to an opening of some rods in circumference. Raising their heads cautiously above a moss-covered log, they saw in the opening a stalwart Sergeant with five or six men. The Sergeant was standing there with his eyes fixed on the tops of the trees, apparently thinking of the next series of commands he was to give, while the men were busy breaking limbs off the cedars.  Si and Shorty immediately grasped the situation.{36}  \"Forward, Co. Q!\" yelled Si at the top of his lungs. \"Surrender, you consarned rebels, or we'll blow your heads off,\" he added, as he and Shorty jumped forward into the opening and leveled their guns on the squad.  \"What'n thunder was you fellers makin' all that racket fur,\" Si asked the Sergeant as he was marching him back to the skirmish-line.  \"Ouah Cunnel,\" explained the Sergeant, \"wuz afeared you'ns 'd try to flank us through the thicket, and sent me down to make a rumpus and hold you back while he fit you in front. But whar's your company?\"  \"We'll come to it soon,\" said Si.    CHAPTER III. STILL ON THE MARCH  SI AND SHORTY STOP ON THE WAY LONG ENOUGH TO BAG SIX REBS.  SI CALLED out to the other boys by name to come up and join him.  The rebel Sergeant mentally tallied off each name as it was called. A flush of shame and anger mounted to his face as Si concluded.  \"Gol darn hit,\" he said, \"you'uns hain't got ez many ez we'uns; they hain't nigh ez good men ez we'uns, an' they'uns ain't heah. We'uns air Tennesseans, an' you'uns hain't.\"  \"We've got enough, an' they're good enough,\" said Si sententiously. \"Injianny turns out better men than Tennessee ever dreamed o' doing.\"  \"I don't believe hit a mite,\" said the Sergeant, stooping down and picking up a piece of cedar, which made a formidable club. \"We'uns is not a-gwine back with yo'uns nary a step. By rights, we'uns orter take yo'uns back with we'uns. But I'm willin' to call hit off, and let yo'uns go ef yo'uns 'll let we'uns go. Is hit a bargain?\"  \"Not by 40 rows o' apple trees it ain't,\" said Si, stepping back a little to get a better range, and fixing his bayonet. \"I've set my heart on takin' you back to Co. Q, an' back to Co. Q you'll go, if Si Klegg knows himself.\"{38}  \"And you'll go in a hurry, too,\" said Shorty. \"It's gettin' late, and I'm always afraid to be out after dark. Mosey, now!\"  The other rebels were picking up clubs similar to the Sergeant's and casting their eyes on him for the signal to attack.  \"See here,\" said Si desperately, cocking his gun. \"Don't waste no more time in words. This hain't a debatin' society. You're goin' back to Co. Q or going somewhere else thunderin' quick. Sergeant, if you make a move agin me I'll surely blow your head off en you, an' jab my bayonet through the next man. My partner, Shorty, is a worse man than I am, an' I can't tell how many of you he'll kill. He's awful quick-tempered, too, towards evening, an' liable to begin shooting any minute without warnin'. It'll save several lives if you start right off on the jump, straight toward the rear, an' keep it up, with out looking to the right or left, until you reach Co. Q. You'll find the trail we made comin' in. Take it this minute.\"  The rebel Sergeant's eyes looked directly into the dark muzzle of Si's gun. They glanced along the barrel, and met one eye looking directly through the sights, while the other was closed, in the act of taking deliberate aim. He decided with great promptness that there were many reasons why he should prefer to be a live rebel in a Yankee prison, rather than a badly-disfigured dead one in a lonely cedar thicket. He dropped his club, turned around, and made his way along the path over which Si had come. The rest followed, with Si and Shorty a few paces in the rear.  Palpitating with pride, Si marched his prisoners up to the company, who gave him three cheers. The Captain ordered him to report with his prisoners to the Colonel.
