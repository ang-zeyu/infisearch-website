Indeed, the opinion was very generally expressed, that the spirits were genuine spirits, and the medium an excellent test medium, through which they should delight, in future, to have further communications.  As they finished their wine a knock was heard at the door. Dropper responded with a \"Come in.\" An Irish servant put her head within the apartment:  \"Plase, sir,\" said she, \"I have a caird here that a gintleman at the door towld me to give to the red-headed gintleman as just come in.\"  Dropper viewed the card, and the four looked at each other for a moment, apparently with a view of discovering who it was that answered the description of a \"red-headed gintleman.\" At last, Boggs spoke.  \"I think it must be me,\" said he, receiving the card from Dropper, and reading aloud, from the back of it, as follows:     \"Sir, an old acquaintance desires to see you for a moment, in    relation to a matter involving your own interest.\"  \"Show him up,\" said Dropper, \"it will only make one more--that is, if Boggs is agreed.\"  Mr. Boggs had no objections to such course being taken, though he was deeply puzzled to know who the old acquaintance could be.  In a moment, the servant introduced into the room a tall, spare individual, of about thirty-two years of age. He was ordinarily attired, and, though not seedy, his garments were by no means new. His face was closely shaven, and surrounded by a large standing collar. He looked around the room upon the different parties present, until his eyes rested upon Boggs. He then ventured to speak.  [Illustration]  \"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"excuse this interruption. The fact is, I have been seeking this gentleman for nearly three years past, and observing him in company with you, I could not forbear following to seek a brief interview.\"  Boggs turned pale. Visions of cowhides and pistols came before his mind.  \"You are perfectly excusable,\" said Dropper. \"We will leave the room, if you desire.\"  \"N-n-not for all the world,\" ejaculated Boggs, hastily. \"I have not the slightest objection to your remaining.\"  \"Nor I,\" said the tall gentleman. \"Your name,\" continued he, addressing Boggs, \"is Johnson, I believe.\"  Nothing could have relieved Boggs from the suspense under which he was laboring more than this last remark. The gentleman had evidently mistaken him for one Johnson, who had, probably, insulted or injured the tall individual, on some previous occasion. The blush again returned to Boggs' cheeks.  \"You are mistaken,\" said he, at last. \"My name is Boggs.\"  \"Boggs--so it is,\" said the tall stranger. \"My bad memory often leads me into errors. But the mistake is very natural--Johnson sounds so much like Boggs; but, whether Johnson or Boggs, you are the individual whom I seek.\"  This announcement caused Boggs's courage to again descend into his boots.  \"It is three years since I have seen you,\" said the tall individual. \"During that length of time, a person would be likely to forget a name. But your person, sir, that I could never, never forget,\" continued the tall man, solemnly, and throwing in a little melo-dramatic action, as he spoke, which made Boggs shudder.  \"C-c-certainly,\" said Boggs.  \"Mr. Boggs,\" said the stranger, \"you probably don't recollect me.\"  \"C-can't say that I do,\" stammered Boggs.  \"That need make no difference,\" said the stranger, mysteriously. \"I know you.\"  The stranger then commenced feeling in his coat pockets with his hands.  Boggs sprang to his feet, observing this movement, fully satisfied that the stranger was seeking his revolver or bowie-knife.  \"Sir,\" said Boggs, hurriedly, \"if I have ever unconsciously done you an injury, I am ready to apologize. I can see no good reason why this apartment should be made the scene of a sanguinary conflict.\"  \"Sanguinary conflict--apology\"--said the other, somewhat astonished. \"My dear sir, the apology is due to you.\"  Boggs's equanimity was once more restored. \"You don't know how happy I am to hear you say so,\" said he. \"Could you make it convenient to apologize at once, to fully relieve my mind of the frightful anticipations?\"  \"With the greatest pleasure in the world, Mr. Boggs,\" said the stranger. \"I apologize.\"  \"And I cheerfully forgive you,\" said Boggs.  \"Then you recollect the circumstance, do you?\" asked the stranger.  \"Hang me if I do,\" said Boggs.  \"Then you forgive me in anticipation.\"  \"Certainly,\" replied Boggs. \"But what the devil were you feeling in your pockets for so mysteriously?\"  \"My _porte-monnaie_,\" replied the stranger, who at length succeeded in finding the object of his search. He took from it a gold dollar, two dimes and a cent, and placed them on the table before Boggs. \"There,\" said he, \"is the sum of one dollar and twenty-one cents, United States currency, which amount is justly your due.\"  \"What the deuce does all this mean?\" asked Boggs, in his bewilderment; \"for between being waylaid in the street, accused of petty larceny, anticipations of being murdered, receiving apologies for unknown injuries, and the proffer of money from a total stranger, I hardly know whether I am standing on my heels or my head.\"  The mysterious stranger then proceeded to make his explanation.  \"About three years ago,\" said he, \"I invited a lady friend to the theatre. She signified her intention to accept the invitation. In the evening I called for her, attired in my best, and found her seated in the parlor attired in _her_ best. We arrived at the theatre. I had taken with me only a small sum of money--amounting in the aggregate to one dollar and thirty-seven and a half cents. I took the dollar from my pocket, and passed it to the ticket-seller, who took occasion to pass it to me again immediately, and putting his physiognomy before the seven by nine aperture through which the money goes in and the pasteboard comes out, he announced to me, in effect, that the bank note aforesaid, of the denomination of one dollar, was a base imitation. This was a perplexing position. Had I been the fortunate possessor of another dollar on the spot, I should not have been troubled. The lady's acquaintance I had but recently formed. My pride would not permit me to announce to her my true financial condition at that moment. Between pride and a hurried contemplation of the prospective frightful results of my monetary deficiency, I was completely bewildered. I stammered out something about having nothing with me except two or three shillings and a fifty dollar bill--the first of which, gentlemen, existed in the innermost recesses of my vest pocket, and the last in my imagination. I was wondering what the devil I should do next, when a gentleman with red hair addressed me. \"Good evening, sir,\" said he, touching his hat, \"did you say you have difficulty in getting a bill changed?\" Without waiting for me to speak he said, \"here's a dollar; you can return it to me to-morrow, when you call at my office to transact that matter of which we were speaking yesterday. Good evening.\" I looked in my hand, and found in it two half dollars and a card, upon which I perceived a name and address written. I was more bewildered than ever, owing to the unexpected deliverance, from what a moment before, I had believed to be an inextricable difficulty. I thought that heaven had deputed some red-haired angel to come to my relief. Then I doubted whether it was not a dream; but the weight of the two half dollars satisfied me that the whole thing was a tangible reality. The difficulty was dissipated, the funds were provided, and the necessary tickets purchased. Next morning I resolved to visit my deliverer, and give him my heartfelt thanks and a dollar. As I was about to leave on my joyful errand, I felt in my pocket for the card; it was gone. I was horror-stricken. I searched everywhere, but could not find it. I tried then to recall to my mind the name; but having read it under considerable excitement, it had not impressed itself upon my memory. I went to the theatre, in hopes to find it there, but in vain. For three months, gentlemen, all my spare time was employed in perambulating Broadway, and standing at the entrance of the theatre, in hopes of meeting my deliverer. Many are the short and red-haired gentlemen whom I have vainly pursued. A half hour since, as I was riding down Broadway in a stage, I saw my deliverer turning the corner of this street, in company with three other gentlemen. I stopped the stage, gave the driver a quarter, and without waiting to receive the change, I made a rush for the stage door, stepped on the silk skirt of a lady passenger, kicked a fat gentleman on the shins, knocked a baby out of an Irishwoman's lap, fell, and struck my head against the door, tumbled out, slipped on the Russ pavement, excited the mirth of the passengers and pedestrians, got up, and reached the corner just in time to see the party whom I followed enter this house. I rushed on, and after some little inquiry, succeeded in attaining this apartment. Gentlemen, Boggs was my deliverer.\"  \"Hurrah for Boggs,\" shouted Dropper.  \"Boggs, you're a philanthropist,\" said Spout.  \"_Vive le Boggs_,\" said Van Dam.  \"Gentlemen,\" said Boggs, \"I protest against your unwarranted compliments. My dear sir,\" said he, addressing the stranger, \"you only borrowed a dollar of me, whereas, I perceive you have given me one dollar and twenty-one cents.\"  \"Three years interest, at seven per cent,\" suggested the stranger, \"Legally your due, and I insist upon your accepting interest as well as principal.\"  Boggs, without further objection pocketed the proffered amount.  \"Your case,\" said Spout, to the stranger; \"is one of morbid concientiousness; so much so that I feel desirous of knowing you better.\"  \"My name, gentlemen,\" said the stranger, \"is Dusenbury Quackenbush.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32274"],["title","The History and Records of the Elephant Club (#3)"],["body","  A general rush was made toward the stranger. Van Dam seized one hand, Boggs the other; Spout caught him by the arm, whilst Dropper, who was the last to reach him, threw his long arms around the whole party. For a moment there was general commotion, growing out of a fierce shaking of hands and arms. Each person loudly assured Mr. Quackenbush of the happiness he felt in having formed his acquaintance. As soon as they had relieved him from their affectionate welcomings Mr. Quackenbush spoke.  \"I am certainly happy to become acquainted with you, gentlemen,\" remarked he, \"but really I am fearful I shall not be a very interesting acquaintance in a _coterie_ of old friends, as you appear to be, and without doubt are.\"  \"Yes, we are old friends,\" said Spout, \"our friendship is as enduring as the gullibility of the public, and I might add as ancient as--as--gentlemen excuse me if I fail in this point to institute an appropriate comparison. As an astonisher, however, I will inform you of a fact known only to Mr. Van Dam and myself; and which is, that, two hours since, not one of the gentlemen of this quintet had ever known another of it; if I except the case of Mr. Boggs and Mr. Quackenbush.\"  \"Mr. Quackenbush,\" inquired Spout, \"allow me to ask whether you are acquainted with life in the metropolis in its multiform phases?\"  \"I confess my ignorance,\" was the reply. \"It is most unfortunate that the position of a teacher in a public school is one not calculated to bring an individual in contact with much that is interesting.\"  \"Taking that fact into consideration,\" said Spout, \"I propose, that you all meet me at my room, two evenings hence, when I shall be prepared to unfold to you a purpose and a plan, which I have just conceived. My room, gentlemen, is over old Shavem's, the brokers, three doors from the corner. The number would be 461-1/2, if there were any on the door. You can't mistake the place, however; there is an antiquated pump in front, and when I'm at home there is a Spout inside.\"  \"Oh--h!\" groaned Dropper.  \"Never mind,\" resumed Spout, \"I don't often attempt such things. Can I depend upon your coming?\"  All gave an affirmative response.  \"Then,\" said Spout, \"you can depend upon my going, I pronounce this meeting adjourned.\"  After a few words the parties separated.  [Illustration]     HOW THE CLUB ORGANIZED.  Put out the light, and then put.--SHAKSPEARE.   [Illustration]  THE evening arrived on which the gentlemen, named in the last chapter, were to meet in the room of Mr. John Spout.  Mr. Spout was there, awaiting the arrival of his friends. He was seated at the end of a table, in a large easy-chair, in his dressing-gown. Before him, on the table, were several written papers. The apartment was one of moderate dimensions, neatly carpeted, and, with plenty of furniture, unobjectionable in quality and taste. On the walls were suspended various pictures, engravings, fencing-foils, and masks, boxing-gloves, antique models, Indian ornaments, plaster casts of legs, arms, hands, feet, &c. On either side of the table were two chairs, placed there, evidently, in anticipation of the arrival of his friends.  Several pipe-stems protruded from a pasteboard box, which was on the table. It required no unusual shrewdness to guess at the contents, and to rightly determine that it was filled with the best-abused, and, at the same time, best-used weed known.  One by one, the other gentlemen arrived, and were ushered by the housekeeper into Mr. Spout's apartment. They sat, engaged in discussing tobacco and the events of the day. At length, Mr. Dropper inquired of Mr. Spout if he had as yet fully elaborated the idea which, on the occasion of the previous meeting, had seemed to weigh so heavily on his mind?  \"I was about to advert to the subject,\" said Mr. Spout. \"It has engaged my undivided attention up to the present time, and the idea and plan based upon it are sufficiently perfected to satisfy myself.\"  \"Trot it out,\" said Boggs, \"we are all attention.\"  \"The fact, gentlemen,\" said Spout, \"that most of our number have been either absent from the city, or so much engaged in our different vocations that we have never gained, or have lost, familiarity with many interesting phases of life, as it exists in New York, suggested to me the thought of devoting some portion of our time to looking about, and having put our observations in writing, to interchange them for our mutual gratification.\"  \"A capital idea,\" said Mr. Dusenbury Quackenbush.  \"Brilliant with pleasurable results,\" remarked Mr. Myndert Van Dam.  \"Replete with rational enjoyment,\" suggested Mr. Remington Dropper.  \"I'm in,\" was the laconic response of Mr. James George Boggs.  \"Then I suppose I can count upon your coöperation in the realization of the idea,\" said Spout.  A general affirmative answer being given, Mr. Spout continued.  \"You being unanimous,\" said he, \"I'll now proceed to unfold my plans. To secure unanimity of action and entire success, it is necessary that we have a plan of organization. But in thinking upon this subject, I have foreseen that, by the adoption of any of the ordinary plans, we saddle ourselves with a useless machinery, which will hinder the successful accomplishment of the object we desire. We have no time to spare in discussing rules of order, the adoption of which invariably makes disorder the rule. Yet, there must be a head. In brief, then, gentlemen, I propose that the principles upon which our meetings shall be governed, shall be a despotic principle, but one which shall be compatible with the largest liberty of the governed. How do you like the idea?\"  \"The idea looks paradoxical to me,\" said Van Dam.  \"Rather profound,\" suggested Quackenbush.  \"Funny,\" said Boggs.  \"I can tell better when I hear the rules,\" said Dropper.  \"I have them prepared,\" continued Spout. \"Shall I read them to you?\"  \"By all means,\" replied Van Dam.  The others signified an affirmative response.  Mr. Spout then proceeded to read:--  We, whose signatures are hereunto affixed, do hereby organize ourselves into a club, having for its   NAME,  THE ELEPHANT CLUB, and having in view the following   OBJECTS:  1. The enjoyment and amusement of its members through.  2. A profound study of the Metropolitan Elephant, by surveying him in all his majesty of proportion, by tracing him to his secret haunts, and observing his habits, both in his wild and domestic state.   OFFICER.  The only officer of the club shall be a Higholdboy, whose   DUTY  It shall be to sit in a big chair, at the end of the table, and to see that the members conform to the following   RULES OF CONDUCT:  1. In the meetings of the club, every member shall do exactly as he pleases.  2. Each member shall speak when he pleases, what he pleases, and as long as he pleases.  N.B.--If the remarks of any member are particularly stupid or tedious, the other members are under no obligations to remain and hear them.  N. particular B. Should the speaker, at the conclusion of his remarks, find himself in the presence of only a part of his original audience, and some of those asleep; he is at full liberty, for his private satisfaction, to conclude that his eloquence, like that of the traditional parsons, is not only moving and soothing, as evidenced by the absence of some and the somnolence of others, but so satisfactory that those who were awake will never care to hear him again.  3. No member shall be permitted to bring spirituous or fermented liquors, wine, beer, or cider, whether imported or domestic, into any of the meetings of the club, under the penalty of passing them around for general use; unless the member prefers to keep them to himself, from motives of economy--the economy in such case to be regarded as an offence, to be punished with a severe letting alone.  4. The third rule shall apply to cigars, cheroots, and cigaretts.  5. Ditto--ditto--sardines, Bologna sausages, crackers and cheese.  6. Members are prohibited from sitting with their feet on the table, unless in that position they sit with more comfort, or they have other reasons satisfactory to themselves.  N.B.--The Higholdboy, in consideration of his onerous duties, is exempted from the action of this rule.  7. The Higholdboy is empowered to reprimand any member, when he considers it necessary to preserve the dignity of the club.  N. special and particular B. In order that this rule shall not operate prejudicially to the sovereign rights of individuals, the members of the club are at liberty to treat the reprimand of the Higholdboy as a good joke.  8. Any member who shall be absent from any meeting of the club, shall be liable to stand a half-dozen on the half shell for each of his fellow-members, unless he gives _no_ previous notice to the club, or any member thereof, of his prospective absence. Such notice, which he fails to give, to be either verbal or written, at his own option.  9. These foregoing rules shall in all cases be construed strictly, they shall never be repealed or amended; and shall be of binding force, except as hereinafter provided in the   ORDER OF BUSINESS.  1. The Higholdboy shall announce the suspension of all rules for three months.  At the conclusion, Mr. Spout, in a solemn tone, addressed the party.  \"Gentleman,\" said he, \"I am aware that the rules, which I have prepared and submitted, are stringent in the extreme, but I think they will be found, on examination, to be no more so than is essential to secure that unanimity of action so indispensable to the accomplishment of any great end. Believing, then, that you fully appreciate the importance of the end we have in view, I trust they will meet with your approval. Gentlemen, I give way to others.\"  Mr. Spout took his seat, amid manifestations of the approval of his associates.  Mr. Boggs was the first to speak on the subject of the rules.  \"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"unaccustomed as I am to public speaking, and overpowered as I feel at the present moment, I should do"]]]
