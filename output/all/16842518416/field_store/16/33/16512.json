[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3165"],["title","Rashi (#4)"],["body","]  A veritable renaissance took place, parallel with the movement of ideas which went on in the schools and convents of the eleventh and fourteenth centuries;[8] for Jewish culture is often bound up with the intellectual destinies of the neighboring peoples.  For some time the schools of Lorraine stood at the head of the Talmudic movement, and it was to them that Rashi came a little later to derive instruction.  One of the most celebrated offspring of the family of the Kalonymides is Meshullam ben Kalonymos, who lived at Mayence in the second half of the tenth century.  He was a Talmudist held in high regard and the composer of liturgic poetry.  He devoted himself to the regulation of the material and spiritual affairs of his brethren.  Although he stood in correspondence with the Babylonian masters, he was in a position to pass judgment independently of them.  Communication with the East was frequent. The communities of France and Germany sent disciples to the Babylonians and submitted difficulties to them.  Tradition relates that the Gaon Natronai (about 865) even visited France. However that may be, the Jews of France at an early period were acquainted with Babylonian works, both the chronicles and the legal codes.  Other Talmudists of the tenth century are known, but rabbinical literature may be said to have commenced only with Gershom ben Judah (about 960-1028).  According to tradition his master was his contemporary Hai Gaon; in reality he was the disciple of Judah ben Meir ha-Cohen, surnamed Leontin (about 975). Originally from Metz, Gershom established himself at Mayence, to which a large number of pupils from neighboring countries soon flocked in order to attend his school.  Thus he was the legatee of the Babylonian academies, the decay of which became daily more marked.  In his capacity as head of a school as in many other respects, he was the true forerunner of Rashi, who carried on his work with greater command of the subject and with more success.  Rabbenu Gershom not only gave Talmudic learning a fresh impetus and removed its centre [center sic] to the banks of the Rhine, but he also exerted the greatest and most salutary influence upon the social life of his co-religionists, through his \"Decrees,\" religious and moral, which, partly renewing older institutions, were accepted by all the Jews of Christian countries.  Among other things, he forbade polygamy.  He merits consideration in two aspects, as a Gaon and as one to whom his disciples gave the surname which still attaches to him, \"the Light of the Exile,\" <I>Meor ha-Golah.</I>  Rashi said of him: \"Rabbenu Gershom has enlightened the eyes of the Captivity; for we all live by his instruction; all the Jews of these countries call themselves the disciples of his disciples.\"  Gershom seems to have been the first Rhenish scholar who resorted to the written word for the spread of his teachings.  He devoted himself to the establishment of a correct text of the Bible and the Talmud, and his chief work is a Talmudical commentary.  Since his time the continuity of learning has been uninterrupted. The seed sown by Rabbenu Gershom was not long in germinating. Schools began to multiply and develop in Lorraine.  The one at Mayence prospered for a long time, and was eclipsed only by the schools of Champagne.  A rabbi, Machir, the brother of Gershom, by his Talmudic lexicon contributed likewise to the development of rabbinical knowledge. His four sons were renowned scholars, contemporaries and doubtless fellow-students of Rashi.  The disciples of Gershom, who continued the work of their master, are of especial interest to us, because one of them, Simon the Elder, was the maternal uncle of Rashi, and three others were his masters.  These were Jacob ben Yakar, Isaac ha-Levi, and Isaac ben Judah.  The latter two were disciples also of Eliezer ben Isaac the Great, of Mayence.  Jacob ben Yakar and Isaac ha-Levi went to Worms, where they became rabbis, while Isaac ben Judah remained at Mayence, and directed the Talmudic school there.  About the middle of the eleventh century, then, an intellectual ferment took place in France and Lorraine, earnest literary and scientific activity manifested itself, and above all elements of profound rabbinical culture became visible.  But one who should regulate these forces was lacking, a guide to direct these activities and to serve as a model to others.  In order that the movement might not come to a premature end, a master was needed who would give it impetus and define its course, who would strike the decisive blow.  Such a man there was, a man who impressed his contemporaries as a scholar of high degree and noble character, and whose memory as such is still cherished by posterity.  This man was Rashi.                             CHAPTER II                  THE YOUTH AND EDUCATION OF RASHI  Little is known concerning the life of Rashi.  Owing to various causes not a single work is extant that might be used as a guide for the establishment of minor facts.  Generally speaking, Jewish literature in the middle ages was of an impersonal character; practically no memoirs nor autobiographies of this period exist. The disciples of the great masters were not lavish of information concerning them.  They held their task to be accomplished when they had studied and handed on the master's works; regard for his teachings ranked above respect for the personality of the author. But the figure of Rashi, as though in despite of all such obstacles, has remained popular.  People wanted to know all the details of his life, and they invented facts according to their desires.  Fiction, however, fell short of the truth.  Legend does not represent him so great as he must actually have been.  In the present work, too, I shall be obliged to resort to comparisons and analogies, to supplement by hypotheses the scanty information afforded by history, yet I shall distinguish the few historic facts from the mass of legends in which they are smothered.  As of old many cities in Greece asserted that they were the birthplace of Homer, the national poet, so a number of cities disputed for the honor of being the birthplace of Rashi, or of having been his residence, or the scene of his death.  Worms claimed him as one of its rabbis, Lunel, thanks to a confusion of names, has passed as his birthplace, and Prague as the city of his death.  One historian set 1105 as the year of his birth, though in fact it is the year of his death.  Others placed it in the thirteenth century, and still others even in the fourteenth.  In the course of this narrative other such instances will occur - of fables, more or less ingenious, collected by chroniclers lacking discrimination.  They may make pleasant reading, although they contain no element of authenticity.  Besides, they are of relatively recent date, and emanate to a large extent from Italy and Spain, whose historians could count upon the credulity of their readers to impose their inventions upon Jews and Christians alike.  Confusion of this sort reigned in regard to Rashi's life until 1823, the year in which the illustrious Zunz published the essay which established, not only his own, but also Rashi's reputation, and brought Rashi forth from the shadow of legend into the full light of history.  We owe a debt of gratitude to Zunz and other scholars, such as Geiger, Weiss, Berliner, and Epstein, because, with the legendary often superimposed upon the true, they have made it easy to pick out the genuine from the false.  Now that the result of their labors is before us, no great difficulty attaches to the task of casting off legend from history, and extracting from the legendary whatever historic material it contains.                             I  In brushing aside all the myths with which the biography of Rashi is cobwebbed, one finds, not a varied life, rich in incident, but an entirely intellectual life, whose serenity was undisturbed by excitement.  An event dividing Rashi's life into almost equal parts is his taking up his residence at Troyes.  During the earlier period he received his education, at first in the city of his birth, then in the academies of Lorraine.  On his return to Troyes, he had matured and was thoroughly equipped.  In the school he founded there, he grouped pupils about him and wrote the works destined to perpetuate his influence.  First of all, it is necessary to make Rashi's acquaintance, as it were, to know the names he bore and those he did not bear.  An example of the fantastic stories of which he was the hero is afforded by the name Yarhi, which is sometimes still given to him.  It does not date further back than the sixteenth century, before which time he was called R. Solomon (Shelomo) by the Jews of France, and R. Salomon ha-Zarfati (the Frenchman) by Jews outside of France.  Christian scholars likewise called him R. Salomo Gallicus, and also briefly R. Solomon, as the most celebrated rabbi who ever bore that name.  So said Abbe Bartolocci, one of the first and most eminent bibliographers of rabbinical literature, explaining that the short appellation had the same force as when Saint Paul is designated simply as \"the apostle.\"  The usual name applied to Rashi (R Sh I) is formed, in accordance with a well-known Jewish custom, from the initials of his name and patronymic in Hebrew, Rabbi Shelomo Izhaki[9], which the Christians translated by Solomon Isaacides, just as they made Maimonides of Moses ben Maimon.  Raymond Martini, the celebrated author of the <I>Pugio fidei,</I> seems to have been the first who saw in Rashi the initials of the words, R. Solomon Yarhi. He confused Rashi either with a Solomon of Lunel, mentioned by the traveller [traveler sic] Benjamin of Tudela, or with a grammarian, Solomon ben Abba Mari, of Lunel, who lived in the second half of the fourteenth century.  Sebastian Munster, the German Hebraist (1489-1552), and the elder Buxtorf (1564-1629), the humanist and highly"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3165"],["title","Rashi (#5)"],["body","Hebrew scholar, popularized the mistake, which soon gave rise to another.  L'Empereur, also a scholar in Hebraica, of the seventeenth century, went even further than his predecessors, in holding Lunel [10] to have been the birthplace of Rashi, while Basnage (1653-1725), the celebrated historian of the Jews, spoke of \"Solomon the Lunatic.\"  Though as early a writer as Richard Simon (1638-1712) protested against the error of making Lunel the native city of Rashi, the mistake crept even into Jewish circles.  Since this city of Languedoc was one of the principal centres [centers sic] of Jewish learning in the Provence during the middle ages, Rashi, in most unexpected fashion, came to swell the number of \"scholars\" of Lunel, of whom mention is frequently made in rabbinical literature.  It even seems that at the beginning of the nineteenth century, Jews of Bordeaux went to Lunel on a pilgrimage to his tomb.  In point of fact Rashi was neither a German nor a Provencal; he was born and he died in Champagne, at Troyes.  At that time France was divided into a dozen distinct countries, one of the most important of which was the countship of Champagne, to the northeast, between the Ile-de-France and Lorraine.  There were Jews in all the important localities of the province, especially in the commercial cities.  In the period with which we are dealing, fairs took place every year successively at Lagny, Bar- sur-Aube, Provins, Troyes, and again Provins and Troyes.  The principal city was Troyes, which at the end of the ninth century, when it contained about twelve thousand inhabitants, was chosen as their capital by the counts of Champagne.  In a wide plain, where the Seine divides into several branches, rises the city of Troyes, maintaining to some extent its medieval character, with its narrow, illpaved streets, which of old swarmed with geese and porkers, and with its houses of wooden gables and overhanging roofs.  Manufactures prospered at Troyes. Many tanneries were established there, and parchment was exported from all parts of the district.  In fact it has been suggested that the development of the parchment industry at Troyes furthered the literary activity for which the province was noted, by providing writing material at a time when in general it was so rare.  But manufactures in that period had not attained a high degree of perfection, and the main instrument for obtaining wealth was commerce, chiefly the commerce carried on at fairs, those great lists periodically opened to the commercial activity of a whole province or a whole country.  Troyes, celebrated for its fairs, was the scene of two a year, one beginning on St. John's Day (the warm fair), and one beginning on St. Remy's Day (the cold fair).  They covered a quarter so important that it constituted two large parishes by itself.  Although religon [religion sic] had already begun to intervene in the regulation of the fairs, Jews took a large part in them, and somewhat later, like the Jews of Poland in the seventeenth century, they used them as the occasions for rabbinical synods. In the Jewish sources, the fairs of Troyes are frequently mentioned.  The relations that sprang up among the great numbers of Jews that went to them were favorable to the cause of science, since the Jews in pursuing their material interests did not forget those of learning.  Thus the fairs exercised a certain influence upon the intellectual movement.  Troyes was also the seat of a permanent Jewish community of some importance; for a Responsum of the first half of the eleventh century declared that the regulations of the community should have the force of law for each member, and when the regulations deal with questions of general import they were to hold good for neighboring communities as well.  Another Responsum dating from the same period shows that the Jews of France owned land and cultivated the vine.  Troyes no longer bears visible traces of the ancient habitation of the Jews.  It is possible that the parish of St. Frobert occupies the ground covered by the old Jewry; and probably the church of St. Frobert, now in ruins, and the church of St. Pantaleon were originally synagogues.  But in Rashi's works there are more striking evidences that Jews were identified with Troyes.  Certain of his expressions or other indications attach them to the city of Troyes, \"our city,\" as he says.  Rashi, then, was born at Troyes in 1040-the year of Gershom's death, some authors affirm, who are more concerned with the pragmatism of history than its truth, more with scientific continuity than with the sequence of events.  But if it is almost certain that the rabbi, who, as I said, was the precursor of Rashi, had been dead for twelve years, 1040 (possibly 1038) is probably the year of the death of another authority, no less celebrated, Hai Gaon, whose passing away marks the irreparable decadence of the Babylonian Gaonate.  The French rabbi and his Spanish colleagues were destined to harvest the fruits of this Gaonate and carry on its work, exemplifying the words of the Talmud: \"When one star is extinguished in Israel, another star rises on the horizon.\"  In order that Rashi should have a setting in accord with so high a position, legend has surrounded his family with a nimbus of glory.  History, it is true, does not make mention of his ancestors, and this silence, joined to the popularity which Rashi came to enjoy, inspired, or was an added stimulus to, the fantastic genealogic theories of those who in their admiration of him, or through pride of family, declared him to have been descended from a rabbi of the third century, Johanan ha- Sandlar.[11]  All that can be said with certainty is, that his maternal uncle was Simon the Elder, a disciple of Gershom and a learned and respected rabbi.  Rashi's father Isaac appears to have been well-educated.  Rashi on one occasion mentions a certain bit of instruction he had received from him.  Tradition, fond of ascribing illustrious ancestors to its heroes, would see in this Isaac one who through his knowledge and godliness deserved to share in the renown of his son, and to whom his son, moreover, rendered pious homage by quoting him in the opening passage[12] of the commentary on Genesis.  We would willingly believe Rashi capable of a delicate attention of this kind, only we know that the Isaac cited is a certain Talmudic scholar.  Tradition, letting its fancy play upon the lives of great men, delights also in clothing their birth with tales of marvels. Sometimes the miraculous occurs even before they are born and points to their future greatness.  The father of Rashi, for instance, is said to have possessed a precious gem of great value.  Some Christians wanted to take it away from him, either because they desired to put it to a religious use, or because they could not bear the sight of such a treasure in the hands of a Jew.  Isaac obstinately refused their offers.  One day the Christians lured him into a boat, and demanded that he give up his gem.  Isaac, taking a heroic stand, threw the object of their ardent desires into the water.  Then a mysterious voice was heard in his school pronouncing these words: \"A son will be born to thee, O Isaac, who will enlighten the eyes of all Israel.\" According to a less familiar tradition, Isaac lived in a seaport town, where he earned a poor livelihood as stevedore.  Once he found a pearl in the harbor, and went in all haste to show it to his wife, the daughter of a jeweler.  Realizing the value of the pearl, she could not contain herself, and went forthwith to a jeweler.  He offered her ten thousand ducats, double its value, because the duke was anxious to buy it as an adornment for the bishop's cope.  The woman would not listen to the proposition, and ran back to her husband to tell him to what use the pearl was going to be put.  Rather than have it adorn a bishop's vestment, Isaac threw it into the sea, sacrificing his fortune to his God.  The scene of another tradition is laid at Worms.  One day his wife, who had become pregnant, was walking along a street of the city when two carriages coming from opposite directions collided. The woman in danger of being crushed pressed up close against a wall, and the wall miraculously sank inward to make way for her. This made Isaac fear an accusation of witchcraft, and he left Worms for Troyes, where a son was born to him, whom he named Solomon.  To turn from the mythical to the hypothetical-the young Solomon probably received his early education in his own family, and what this education was, can easily be conceived.  It was the duty of the father himself to take charge of the elementary instruction of his son and turn the first glimmerings of the child's reason upon the principles of religion.  This instruction was concentrated upon the observance of laws and customs.  \"From the tenderest age,\" says Dr. M. Berliner, \"the child was initiated into the observance of religious precepts, and was put upon his guard against their transgression.  His parents had but one aim, to inculcate in him the religion of his ancestors and render the Law, the source of this religion, accessible to him.  He was thus inured to the struggle of life, in which his shield was belief in God.  The mother also took part in the rearing of her child.  Her lullabies were often prayers or Biblical hymns, and although the women, as a rule, did not receive a thorough education, they effectually helped to make observant devotees of the Law of their children.\"[13]  Five or six was the age at which Hebrew was begun to be taught to the child, and the occasion was usually celebrated by a picturesque ceremony full of poetic feeling.  On the morning of the Pentecost, the festival which commemorates the giving of the Law on Mt. Sinai, or on the morning of the Rejoicing of the Law, the day devoted above all others to honoring the Law, the child, dressed in his holiday clothes and wrapped in a Tallit, was led"]]]
