It is the language of his hearth and home; many of the most cherished memories of his life are bound up with it; it is for him the language of freedom, whereas standard English is that of constraint. In other words, dialect is the working man’s poetic diction—a poetic diction as full of savour as that of the eighteenth-century poets was flat and insipid.  It is sometimes said that the use of dialect makes the appeal of poetry provincial instead of national or universal. This is only true when the dialect poet is a pedant and obscures his meaning by fantastic spellings. The Lowland Scots element in _Auld Lang Syne_ has not prevented it from becoming the song of friendship of the Anglo-Saxon race all the world over. Moreover, the provincial note in poetry or prose is far from being a bad thing. In the _Idylls_ of Theocritus it gave new life to Greek poetry in the third century before Christ, and it may render the same high service to English poetry to-day or to-morow. The rise of Provincial schools of literature, interpreting local life in local idiom, in all parts of the British Isles and in the Britain beyond the seas, is a goal worth striving for; such a literature, so far from impeding the progress of the literature in the standard tongue, would serve only to enrich it in spirit, substance and form.

A Dalesman’s Litany   From Hull, Halifax, and Hell, good Lord deliver us.                                         _A Yorkshire Proverb_.  It’s hard when fowks can’t finnd their wark     Wheer they’ve bin bred an’ born; When I were young I awlus thowt     I’d bide ’mong t’ roots an’ corn. But I’ve bin forced to work i’ towns,     So here’s my litany: Frae Hull, an’ Halifax, an’ Hell,     Gooid Lord, deliver me!  When I were courtin’ Mary Ann,     T’ owd squire, he says one day: “I’ve got no bield[1] for wedded fowks;     Choose, wilt ta wed or stay?” I couldn’t gie up t’ lass I loved,     To t’ town we had to flee: Frae Hull, an’ Halifax, an’ Hell,     Gooid Lord, deliver me!  I’ve wrowt i’ Leeds an’ Huthersfel’,     An’ addled[2] honest brass; I’ Bradforth, Keighley, Rotherham,     I’ve kept my barns an’ lass. I’ve travelled all three Ridin’s round,     And once I went to sea: Frae forges, mills, an’ coalin’ boats,     Gooid Lord, deliver me!  I’ve walked at neet through Sheffield loans,[3]     ’T were same as bein’ i’ Hell: Furnaces thrast out tongues o’ fire,     An’ roared like t’ wind on t’ fell. I’ve sammed up coals i’ Barnsley pits,     Wi’ muck up to my knee: Frae Sheffield, Barnsley, Rotherham,     Gooid Lord, deliver me!  I’ve seen grey fog creep ower Leeds Brig     As thick as bastile[4] soup; I’ve lived wheer fowks were stowed away     Like rabbits in a coop. I’ve watched snow float down Bradforth Beck     As black as ebiny: Frae Hunslet, Holbeck, Wibsey Slack,     Gooid Lord, deliver me!  But now, when all wer childer’s fligged,[5]     To t’ coontry we’ve coom back. There’s fotty mile o’ heathery moor     Twix’ us an’ t’ coal-pit slack. And when I sit ower t’ fire at neet,     I laugh an’ shout wi’ glee: Frae Bradforth, Leeds, an Huthersfel’, Frae Hull, an’ Halifax, an’ Hell,     T’ gooid Lord’s delivered me!   [1] Shelter.

Cambodunum, Cambodunum,     how I love the sound o’ t’ name! Roman sowdiers belt a fort here,     gave th’ owd place its lastin’ fame.  We’ve bin lords o’ Cambodunum     for well-nigh eight hunderd yeer; Fowk say our fore-elders     bowt it of a Roman charioteer.  Ay, I know we’re nobbut farmers,     mowin’ gerse an’ tentin’ kye, But we’re proud of all we’ve stood for     i’ yon ages that’s gone by;  Proud of all the slacks we’ve drained,     an’ proud of all the walls we’ve belt, Proud to think we’ve bred our childer     on the ground wheer Romans dwelt.  “Niver pairt wi’ Cambodunum,”     that’s what father used to say; “If thou does, thou’ll coom to ruin,     beg thy breead thro’ day to day.”  I’ll noan pairt wi’ Cambodunum,     though its roof lets in the rains, An’ its walls wi’ age are totterin’;     Cambodunum’s i’ my veins.  Ivery stone about the buildin’     has bin dressed by Roman hands, An’ red blooid o’ Roman sowdiers     has bin temmed[1] out on its lands.  Often, when I ploo i’ springtime,     I leet on their buried hoard— Coins an’ pottery, combs an’ glasses;     once I fan’ a rusty sword.  Whisht! I’ll tell thee what I saw here     of a moon-lit winter neet— Ghosts o’ Romans i’ their war-gear,     wheelin’ slow wi’ silent feet;  Pale their faces, proud their bearin’,     an’ a strange gloor i’ their een, As they marched past an’ saluted,     while th’ east wind blew snell an’ keen.  Dalewards, dalewards, iver dalewards,     th’ hill-fowk wander yeer by yeer, An’ they toss their heeads an’ flout me,     when they see me bidin’ here.  I’ve one answer to their fleerin’:     “I’ll noan be a fact’ry slave, Breathin’ poison i’ yon wark-shops,     diggin’ ivery day my grave.”  “You may addle brass i’ plenty,     you’ll noan addle peace o’ mind; That sal bide amang us farmers     on th’ owd hills you’ve left behind.”  See that place down theer i’ t’ valley,     wheer yon chimleys spit out smoke? Huthersfield is what they call it,     wheer fowk live like pigs i’ t’ poke;  Wheer men grind their hearts to guineas,     an’ their mills are awlus thrang, Turnin’ neet-time into day-time,     niver stoppin’ th’ whole yeer lang.  Cambodunum up on th’ hill-tops,     Huthersfield down i’ yon dale; One’s a place for free-born Britons,     t’other’s ommost like a jail.  Here we live i’ t’ leet an’ sunshine,     free as larks i’ t’ sky aboon; Theer men tew[2] like mowdiwarps[3]     that grub up muck by t’ glent o’ t’ moon.  See yon motor whizzin’ past us,     ower th’ owd brig that spans our beck; That’s what fowk call modern progress,     march o’ human intelleck.  Modern progress, modern ruin!     March o’ int’leck, march o’ fooils! All that cooms o’ larnin’ childer     i’ their colleges an’ schooils.  Eddication! Sanitation!!—     teeming brass reight down a sink; Eddication’s nowt but muckment,     sanitation’s just a stink.  Childer mun have books an’ picturs,     bowt at t’ most expensive shops, Teliscowps to go star-gazin’,     michaelscowps to look at lops.[4]  Farmers munnot put their midden     straight afoor their kitchen door; Once a week they’re set spring-cleanin’,     fettlin’ up their shippen[5] floor.  Women-fowk have taen to knackin’,[6]     wilent speyk their mother-tongue, Try to talk like chaps i’ t’ powpit,     chicken-chisted, wake i’ t’ lung.  Some fowk say I’m too owd-feshioned;     mebbe, they are tellin’ true: When you’ve lived wi’ ghosts o’ Romans,     you’ve no call for owt that’s new.  Weel I know I san’t win t’ vict’ry:     son’s agean me, dowters, wife; Yit I’ll hold my ground bout flinchin’,     feight so long as I have life.  An’ if t’ wick uns are agean me,     I sal feight for them that’s deead— Roman sowdiers i’ their trenches,     lapped i’ mail thro’ foot to heead.  Here I stand for Cambodunum,     eagle’s nest on t’ Pennine hills, Wagin’ war wi’ modern notions,     carin’ nowt for forges, mills.  Deeath alone sal call surrender,     stealin’ on me wi’ his hosts, And when Deeath has won his battle,     I’ll go seek my Roman ghosts.  Then I’ll hear their shout o’ welcome     “Here cooms Bob ’o Dick ’o Joe’s, Bred an’ born at Cambodunum,     held th’owd fort agean his foes;  “Fowt for ancient ways an’ customs,     ne’er to feshion bent his knee; Oppen t’ ranks, lads, let him enter;     he’s a Roman same as we.”   [1] Poured.

Telling the Bees   On many Yorkshire farms it was—perhaps still is—the custom to tell the bees when a death had taken place in the family. The hive had to be put into mourning, and when the arval, or funeral feast, was held, after the return from the grave, small portions of everything eaten or drunk had to be given to the bees in a saucer. Failure to do this meant either the death or departure of the bees.  Whisht! laatle bees, sad tidings I bear,     Bees, bees, murmurin’ low ; Cauld i’ his grave ligs your maister dear,     Bees, bees, murmurin’ low. Nea mair he’ll ride to t’ soond o’ t’ horn, Nea mair he’ll fettle his sickle for t’ corn. Nea mair he’ll coom to your skep of a morn,     Bees, bees, murmurin’ low.  Muther sits cryin’ i’ t’ ingle nook,     Bees, bees, murmurin’ low ; Parson’s anent her wi’ t’ Holy Book,     Bees, bees, murmurin’ low.

Look, conny[3] bees, I’s winndin’ black crape,     Bees, bees, murmurin’ low ; Slowly an’ sadly your skep I mun drape,     Bees, bees, murmurin’ low. Else you will sicken an’ dwine[4] reet away, Heart-brokken bees, now your maister is clay ; Or, mebbe, you’l leave us wi’ t’ dawn o’ t’ day,     Bees, bees, murmurin’ low.  Sitha !

The Two Lamplighters   I niver thowt when I grew owd     I’d tak to leetin’ lamps; I sud have said, I’d rayther pad     My hoof on t’ road wi’ tramps. But sin I gate that skelp[1] i’ t’ mine,     I’m wankle[2] i’ my heead; So gaffer said, I’d give ower wark     An’ leet town lamps atsteead.  At first, when I were liggin’ snug     I’ bed, warm as a bee, ’T were hard to rise and get agate     As sooin as t’ clock strake three. An’ I were flaid to hear my steps     Echoin’ on ivery wall; An’ flaider yet when down by t’ church     Ullets would skreek and call.  But now I’m flaid o’ nowt; I love     All unkerd[3] sounds o’ t’ neet, Frae childer talkin’ i’ their dreams     To t’ tramp o’ p’licemen’ feet. But most of all I love to hark     To t’ song o’ t’ birds at dawn; They wakken up afore it gloams,     When t’ dew ligs thick on t’ lawn.  If I feel lonesome, up I look     To t’ sky aboon my heead; An’ theer’s yon stars all glestrin’ breet,     Like daisies in a mead. But sometimes, when I’m glowerin’ up,     I see the Lord hissen; He’s doutin’ all yon lamps o’ Heaven     That shines on mortal men.  He lowps alang frae star to star,     As cobby[4] as can be; Mebbe He reckons fowk’s asleep,     Wi’ niver an eye to see. But I hae catched Him at his wark,     For all He maks no din; He leaves a track o’ powder’d gowd[5]     To show where He has bin.  He’s got big lamps an’ laatle lamps,     An’ lamps that twinkles red; Im capped to see Him dout ’em all     Afore I’m back i’ bed. But He don’t laik about His wark,     Or stop to hark to t’ birds; He minds His business, does the Lord,     An’ wastes no gaumless words.  I grow more like Him ivery day,     For all I walk so lame; An’, happen, there will coom a time     I’ll beat Him at His game. Thrang as Throp’s wife, I’ll dout my lamps     Afore He’s gotten so far; An’ then I’ll shout—“I’ve won my race,     I’ve bet Him by a star.”   [1] Blow.   [2] Unsteady.   [3] Strange, eerie.

Thou’ll travel far for cleaner, ony day.  Clear watter! Why, when t’ sun is up i’ t’ sky,     I’ve seen yon flickerin’ shadows o’ lile trout Glidin’ ower t’ shingly boddom. Step thou nigh,     An’ gloor at t’ minnows dartin’ in an’ out.  Our beck flows straight frae slacks o’ moorland peat,     An’ gethers sweetness out o’ t’ ling an’ gorse; At first its voice sounds weantly[1] saft an’ leet,     But graws i’ strength wi’ lowpin ower yon force.  Then thou sud see the birds alang its banks—     Grey heronsews, that coom to fish at dawn; Dippers, that under t’ watter play sike pranks,     An’ lang-nebbed curlews, swaimish[2] as a fawn.  Soomtimes I’ve seen young otters leave their holes,     An’ laik like kitlins ower the silver dew; An’ I’ve watched squirrels climmin’ up the boles     O’ beech trees, lowpin’ leet frae beugh to beugh.  Fowers! Why, thou’d fill thy skep,[3] lass, in an hour,     Wi’ gowlands, paigles, blobs,[4] an’ sike-like things; We’ve daffydills to deck a bridal bower,     Pansies, wheer lady-cows[5] can dry their wings.  Young childer often bathe, when t’weather’s fine,     Up yonder, wheer t’ owd miller’s bigged his weir; I like to see their lish,[6] nakt bodies shine,     An’ watch ’em dive i’ t’ watter widoot fear.  Ay, yon’s our brig, bent like an archer’s bow,     It’s t’ meetin’ place o’ folk frae near an’ far; Young ’uns coom theer wi’ lasses laughin’ low,     Owd ’uns to talk o’ politics an’ t’ war.  It’s daft when chaps that sit i’ Parliament     Weant tak advice frae lads that talk farm-twang; If t’ coontry goes to t’ dogs, it’s ’cause they’ve sent     Ower mony city folk to mend what’s wrang.  They’ve taen our day-tale men[7] to feight for t’ land,     Then tell us we mun keep our staggarths[8] full. What’s lasses, gauvies,[9] greybeards stark[10] i’ t’ hand,     To strip wer kye, an’ ploo, an’ tew wi’ t’ shool?[11]  But theer, I’ll nurse my threapin’ while it rains,     An’ while my rheumatiz is bad to bide; I mun step heamwards now, through t’ yatts[12] an’ lanes,     Wheer t’ owd lass waits for me by t’ fireside.

I’d walk frae here to Skipton,     Ten mile o’ clarty[1] lanes, If I might see him face to face     An’ thank him for his pains. He’s ta’en me out o’ t’ Bastile,[2]     He’s gi’en me life that’s free: Five shill’n a week for fuglin’[3] Death     Is what Lord George gives me.  He gives me leet an’ firin’,     An’ flour to bak i’ t’ yoon.[4] I’ve tea to mesh for ivery meal     An’ sup all t’ afternoon. I’ve nowt to do but thank him,     An’ mak’ a cross wi’ t’ pen; Five shillin’ a week for nobbut that!     Gow! he’s the jewel o’ men.  I niver mell on pol’tics,     But I do love a lord; He spends his savin’s like a king,     Wheer other fowks ’ll hoard. I know a vast o’ widdies     That’s seen their seventieth year; Lord George, he addles brass for all,     Though lots on ’t goes for beer.  If my owd man were livin’,     He’d say as I spak true; He couldn’t thole them yallow Rads,     But awlus voted blue. An’ parson’s wife, shoo telled me     That we’ll sooin go to t’ poll; I hope shoo’s reight; I’ll vote for George,     Wi’ all my heart an’ soul.  I don’t know wheer he springs frae,     Happen it’s down Leeds way; But ivery neet an’ mornin’     For his lang life I pray. He’s ta’en me out o’ t’ Bastile,     He’s gi’en me life that’s free: Five shill’n a week for fuglin’ Death     Is what Lord George gives me.   [1] Muddy.   [2] Workhouse.   [3] Cheating.

Say, what is thou latin’[2] at dusk ’o day,     When t’ tide cooms hoamin’ in.”  “I’s latin’ waif an’ straif[3] by the feam,     (O! esh an’ yak are good for bield) I’s latin’ timmer to big me a heam,     As t’ tide cooms hoamin’ in.”  “What for is thou latin’ waif an’ straif?

The New Englishman   I’ve lived all my life i’ Keighley,     I’m a Yorkshire artisan; An’ when I were just turned seventy     I became an Englishman.  Nat’ralised German! nay, deng it!     I’m British-born, same as thee! But I niver thowt mich to my country,     While[1] my country thowt mich to me.  I were proud o’ my lodge an’ my union,     An’ proud o’ my town an’ my shire; But all t’ consans o’ t’ nation,     I left to t’ parson an’ t’ squire.
