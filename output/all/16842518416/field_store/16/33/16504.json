It took the      Terrestrials many centuries to develop their exquisite and esoteric      art forms. How can you expect to comprehend them in a few short      years? Expose yourself to their art. Work, study, meditate.       Understanding will come, I promise you.       Helpfully yours,       Senbot Drosmig         *       *       *       *       *       _Paris_       Dear Senbot Drosmig:       _To think that I am enjoying the benefits of Terra while my wife      and little ones are forced to remain on Fizbus makes my heart ache.      Surely it is not fair that I should have so much and they so      little. Imagine the inestimable advantage to the fledgling of even      a short contact with Terrestrial culture!_       _Why cannot my loved ones come to join me so that we can share all      these wonderful spiritual experiences and be enriched by them      together?_       _Poignantly yours,_       _Tpooly N'Ox_         *       *       *       *       *       Dear Mr. N'Ox:       After all, it has been only five years since Fizbian spaceships      first came into contact with Terra. In keeping with our usual      colonial policy--so inappropriate and anachronistic when applied to      a well-developed civilization like Terra's--at first only males are      allowed to go to the new world until it is made certain over a      period of years that the planet is safe for mothers and future      mothers of Fizbus.       But Stet Zarnon himself, the celebrated and capable editor of the      Terran edition of _The Fizbus Times_, has taken up your cause, and      I promise you that eventually your loved ones will be able to join      you.       Meanwhile, work, study, meditate.       Helpfully yours,       Senbot Drosmig         *       *       *       *       *       _Ottawa_       _Dear Senbot Drosmig:_       _Having just completed a two-year tour of duty on Earth as part of      a diplomatic mission, I am regretfully leaving this fair planet.      What books, what objects of art, what, in short, souvenirs shall I      take back to Fizbus which will give our people some small idea of      Earth's rich cultural heritage and, at the same time, serve as      useful and appropriate gifts for my friends and relatives back      Home?_       _Inquiringly yours,_       _Solgus Zagroot_         *       *       *       *       *       Dear Mr. Zagroot:       Take back nothing but your memories. They will be your best      souvenirs.       Out of context, any other mementos might convey little, if      anything, of the true beauty and advanced spirituality of      Terrestrial culture, and you might cheapen them were you to use      them crassly as souvenirs. Furthermore, it is possible that you, in      your ignorance, might unwittingly select some items that give a      distorted and false idea of our extrafizbian friends.       The Fizbian-Earth Cultural Commission, sponsored by _The Fizbian      Times_, in conjunction with the consulate, is preparing a vast      program of cultural interchange. Leave it to them to do the great      work, for you can be sure they will do it well.       And be sure to tell your fellow-laborers in the diplomatic      vineyards that it is wiser not to send unapproved Terran souvenirs      back Home. They might cause a fatal misunderstanding between the      two worlds. Tell them to spend their time on Earth in working,      studying and meditating, rather than shopping.       Helpfully yours,       Senbot Drosmig         *       *       *       *       *  And now she--Tarb Morfatch--herself was going to be the guiding spirit that brought enlightenment and uplift to countless thousands on Terra and millions on Fizbus. Her name wouldn't appear on the columns, but the reward of having helped should be enough. Besides, Drosmig was due to retire soon. If she proved herself competent, she would take over the column entirely and get the byline. Grupe had promised faithfully.  But what, she wondered, had put Drosmig \"out of commission\"?  The taxi drew up before a building with a vulgar number of floors showing above ground.  \"Ah--before we--er--meet the others,\" Stet suggested, twitching his crest, \"I was wondering whether you would care to--er--have dinner with me tonight?\"  This roused Tarb from her speculations. \"Oh, I'd love to!\" _A date with the boss right away!_  Stet fumbled in his garments for appropriate tokens with which to pay the driver. \"You--you're not engaged or anything back Home, Miss Morfatch?\"  \"Why, no,\" she said. \"It so happens that I'm not.\"  \"Splendid!\" He made an abortive gesture with his leg, then let her get out of the taxi by herself. \"It makes the natives stare,\" he explained abashedly.  \"But why shouldn't they?\" she asked, wondering whether to laugh or not. \"How could they help but stare? We are different.\" _He must be joking._ She ventured a smile.  He smiled back, but made no reply.  The pavement was hard under her thinly covered soles. Now that walking looked as if it would present a problem, the ban on wing use loomed more threateningly. She had, of course, walked before--on wet days when her wings were waterlogged or in high winds or when she had surface business. However, the sidewalks on Fizbus were soft and resilient. Now she understood why the Terrestrials wore such crippling foot armor, but that didn't make her feel any better about it.  A box-shaped machine took the two Fizbians up to the twentieth story in twice the time it would have taken them to fly the same distance. Tarb supposed that the offices were in an attic instead of a basement because exchange difficulties forced the _Times_ to such economy. She wondered ruefully whether her own expense account would also suffer.  But it was no time to worry about such sordid matters; most important right now was making a favorable impression on her co-workers. She did want them to like her.  Taking out her compact, she carefully polished her eyeballs. The man at the controls of the machine practically performed a ritual _entrechat_.  \"Don't do that!\" Stet ordered in a harsh whisper.  \"But why not?\" she asked, unable to restrain a trace of belligerence from her voice. He hadn't been very polite himself. \"The handbook said respectable Terran women make up in public. Why shouldn't I?\"  He sighed. \"It'll take time for you to catch on, I suppose. There's a lot the handbook doesn't--can't--cover. You'll find the setup here rather different from on Fizbus,\" he went on as he kicked open the door neatly lettered _THE FIZBUS TIMES_ in both Fizbian and Terran. \"We've found it expedient to follow the local newspaper practice. For instance--\" he indicated a small green-feathered man seated at a desk just beyond the railing that bisected the room horizontally--\"we have a Copy Editor.\"  \"What does he do?\" she asked, confused.  \"He copies news from the other papers, of course.\"  \"And what are _you_ doing tonight, Miss Morfatch?\" the Copy Editor asked, springing up from his desk to execute the three ritual entrechats with somewhat more verve than was absolutely necessary.  \"Having dinner with me,\" Stet said quickly.  \"Pulling rank, eh, old bird? Well, we'll see whether position or sterling worth will win out in the end.\"  As the rest of the staff crowded around Tarb, leaping and booing as appreciatively as any girl could want, she managed to snatch a rapid look around. The place wasn't really so very much different from a Fizbian newsroom, once she got over the oddity of going across, not up and down, with the desks--queerly shaped but undeniably desks--arranged side by side instead of one over the other. There were chairs and stools, no perches, but that was to be expected in a wingless society. And it was noisy. Even though the little machines had stopped clattering when she came in, a distant roaring continued, as if, concealed somewhere close by, larger, more sinister machines continued their work. A peculiar smell hung in the air--not unpleasant, exactly, but strange.  She sniffed inquiringly.  \"Ink,\" Stet said.  \"What's that?\"  \"Oh, some stuff the boys in the back shop use. The feature writers,\" he went on quickly, before she could ask what the \"back shop\" was, \"have private offices where they can perch in comfort.\"  He led the way down a corridor, opening doors. \"Our drama editor.\" He indicated a middle-aged man with faded blue feathers, who hung head downward from his perch. \"On the lobster-trick last night writing a review, so he's catching fifty-one twinkles now.\"  \"Enchanted, Miss Morfatch,\" the critic said, opening one bright eye. \"By a curious chance, it so happens that tonight I have two tickets to--\"  \"Tonight she's going out with me.\"  \"Well, I can get tickets to any play, any night. And you haven't laughed unless you've seen a Terrestrial drama. Just say the word, chick.\"  Stet got Tarb out of the office and slammed the door shut. \"Over here is the office of our food editor,\" he said, breathing hard, \"whom you'll be expected to give a claw to now and then, since your jobs overlap. Can't introduce you to him right now, though, because he's in the hospital with ptomaine poisoning. And this is the office you'll share with Drosmig.\"  Stet opened the door.  Underneath the perch, Senbot Drosmig, dean of Fizbian journalists, lay on the rug in a sodden stupor, letters to the editor scattered thickly over his shriveled person. The whole room reeked unmistakably of caffeine.  Tarb shrank back and twined both feet around Stet's. This time he did not repulse her. \"But how can a--an educated, cultured man like Senbot Drosmig sink to such depths?\"  \"It's hard for anyone with even the slightest inclination toward the stuff to resist it here,\" Stet replied somberly. \"I can't deny it; the sale of caffeine is absolutely unrestricted on Earth. Coffee shops all over the place. Coffee served freely at even the best homes. And not only coffee ... caffeine is insiduously present in other of their"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31644"],["title","Helpfully Yours (#2)"],["body","beverages.\"  Her eyes bulged sideways. \"But how can a so-called civilized people be so depraved?\"  \"Caffeine doesn't seem to affect them the way it does us. Their nervous systems are so very uncomplicated, one almost envies them.\"  Drosmig stirred restlessly under his blanket of correspondence. \"Go back ... Fizbus,\" he muttered. \"Warn you ... 'fore ... too late ... like me.\"  Tarb's rose-pink feathers stood on end. She looked apprehensively at Stet.  \"Senbot can't go back because he's in no shape to take the interstel drive.\" The young editor was obviously annoyed. \"He's old and he's a physical wreck. But that certainly doesn't apply to you, Miss Morfatch.\" He looked long and hard into her eyes.  \"Few years on planet,\" Drosmig groaned, struggling to his wings, \"'ply to anybody.\"  His feathers, Tarb noticed, were an ugly, darkish brown. She had never seen any one that color before, but she'd heard rumors that too much caffeine could do that to you. At least she hoped it was only the caffeine.  \"For your information, he was almost as bad as this when he came!\" Stet snapped. \"Frankly, that's why he was sent here--to get rid of his unfortunate addiction. Grupe had no idea, when he assigned him to Earth, that there was caffeine on the planet.\"  The old man gave a sardonic laugh as he clumsily made his way to the perch and gripped it with quivering toes.  \"That is, I don't _think_ he knew,\" Stet said dubiously.  Tarb reached over and picked a letter off the floor. The Fizbian characters were clumsy and ill-made, as if someone had formed them with his feet. Could there be such poverty here that individuals existed who could not afford a scripto? The letter didn't read like any that had ever been printed in the column--at least none that had been picked up in the Fizbus edition:         *       *       *       *       *       _New York_       _Dear Senbot Drosmig:_       _I am a subaltern clerk in the shipping department of the FizbEarth      Trading Company, Inc. Although I have held this post for only three      months, I have already won the respect and esteem of my superiors      through my diligence and good character. My habits are exemplary: I      do not gamble, sing, or take caffeine._       _Earlier today, while engaged in evening meditation at my modest      apartments, I was aroused by a peremptory knock at the door. I      flung it open. A native stood there with a small case in his hand._       _\"Is the house on fire?\" I asked, wondering which of my few humble      possessions I should rescue first._       _\"No,\" he said. \"I would like to interest you in some brushes.\"_       _\"Are the offices of the FizbEarth Trading Company, Inc., on      fire?\"_       _\"Not to my knowledge,\" he replied, opening his case. \"Now I have      here a very nice hairbrush--\"_       _I wanted to give him every chance. \"Have you come to tell me of      any disaster relative to the FizbEarth Trading Company, to myself,      or to anyone or anything else with whom or with which I am      connected?\"_       _\"Why, no,\" he said. \"I have come to sell you brushes. Now here is      a little number I know you'll like. My company developed it with      you folks specially in mind. It's--\"_       _\"Do you know, sir, that you have wantonly interrupted me in the      midst of my meditations, which constitutes an established act of      privacy violation?\"_       _\"Is that a fact? Now this little item is particularly designed for      brushing the wings--\"_       _At that point, I knocked him down and punched him into      insensibility with my feet. Then I summoned the police. To my      surprise, they arrested me instead of him._       _I am writing this letter from jail. I do not like to ask my      employers to get me out because, even though I am innocent, you      know how a thing like this can leave a smudge on the record._       _What shall I do?_       _Anxiously yours,_       _Fruzmus Bloxx_         *       *       *       *       *  \"What should he do?\" Tarb asked, handing Stet the paper. \"Or is the question academic by now? The letter's five days old.\"  Stet sighed. \"I'll find out whether the consulate has been notified. Native police usually do that, you know. Very thoughtful fellows. If this Bloxx hasn't been bailed out already, I'll see that he is.\"  \"But how will we answer his letter? Advise him to sue for false arrest?\"  Stet smiled. \"But he has no grounds for false arrest. He is guilty of assault. The native was entirely within his rights in trying to sell him a brush. Now--\" he put out a foot--\"brace yourself. Privacy violation is not a crime on Terra. It is perfectly legal. In fact, it does not exist as such!\"  At that point, everything went maroon.  When Tarb came to, she found herself lying upon Drosmig's desk. A skin-faced native woman was offering her water and clucking.  \"Are you all right, Tarb--Miss Morfatch?\" Stet demanded anxiously.  \"Yes. I--I think so,\" she murmured, raising herself to a crouch.  \"Better ... have died,\" Drosmig groaned from his perch. \"Fate worse ... death ... awaits you.\"  Tarb tried to smile. \"Sorry to have been so much trouble.\" She stuck out her tongue at both Stet and the native.  The woman drew in her breath.  \"Miss Morfatch,\" Stet reminded Tarb, \"sticking out the tongue is not an apology on Terra; it is an insult. Fortunately, Miss Snow happens to be perhaps the only Terran who would not be offended. She has become thoroughly acquainted with us and our odd little customs. She even--\" he beamed at the Terran female--\"has learned to speak our language.\"  \"Hail to thee, O visitor from the stars,\" Miss Snow said in Fizbian. \"May thy sojourn upon Earth be an incessant delight and may peace and plenty shower their gifts in abundance upon thee.\"  Tarb put her hand to her aching head. \"I'm very glad to meet you,\" she said, glad she did not have to get up to make the ritual _entrechats_.  \"Miss Snow is my right foot,\" Stet said, \"but I'm going to be noble and let her act as your secretary until you can learn to operate a typewriter.\"  \"Secretary? Typewriter?\"  \"Well, you see, there are no scriptos or superscriptos on Earth and we can't import any from Home because the natives--\" Miss Snow smiled--\"don't have the right kind of power here to run psychic installations. All prosifying has to be done directly on prosifying machines or--\" he paused--\"by foot.\"  \"Catch her!\" Miss Snow exclaimed in Terran.  Everything had gone maroon for Tarb again. As she fell, she could hear a sudden thump. It was, she later discovered, Drosmig falling off his perch again--the result of insecure grip, she was given to understand, rather than excessive empathy.         *       *       *       *       *  \"I didn't mean, of course, to give you the impression that we actually produce the individual copies of the papers ourselves,\" Stet explained over the dinner table that night. \"We have native printers who do that. They've turned out some really remarkable Fizbian type fonts.\" \"Very clever of them,\" Tarb said, knowing that was what she was expected to say. She glanced around the restaurant. In their low-cut evening garments, the Terrestrial females looked much less Fizboid than they had during the day. All that naked-looking skin; one would think they'd want to cover it. Probably they were sick with jealousy of her beautiful rose-colored down--what they could see of it, anyway.  \"Of course, our real problem is getting proofreaders. The proofing machines won't operate here either, of course, and so we need human personnel. But what Fizbian would do such degrading work? We had thought of convict labor, but--\"  \"Why mustn't I take off my wrap?\" Tarb interrupted. \"No one else is wearing one.\"  Stet coughed. \"You'll feel much less self-conscious about your wings if you keep it on. And try not to use your feet so conspicuously. I'm sure everyone understands you need them to eat with, but--\"  \"But I'm not in the least self-conscious about my wings. On Fizbus, they were considered rather nice-looking, if I do say so myself.\"  \"It's better,\" he said firmly, \"not to emphasize the differences between the natives and ourselves. You didn't object to wearing a Terrestrial costume, did you?\"  \"No, I realize I must make some concessions to native prudery, but--\"  \"Matter of fact, I've been thinking it would be a good idea for you to wear a stole or a cape or something in the daytime when you go to and from the office. You wouldn't want to make yourself or the _Times_ conspicuous, I'm sure.... No, waiter, no coffee. We'll take champagne.\"  \"I want to try coffee,\" Tarb said mutinously. \"Champagne! You'd think I was a fledgling, giving me that bubbly stuff!\"  He looked at her. \"Now don't be silly, Miss Morfatch ... Tarb. I can't let you indulge in such rash experiments. You realize I am responsible for you.\"  Tarb muttered darkly into her _coupe maison_.  Stet raised his eyebrows. \"What did you say?\"  \"I was only wondering whether you'd remembered to check on whether that young man--Bloxx--ever did get out of jail.\"  Stet snapped his toes. \"Glad you reminded me. Completely slipped my mind. Let's go and see what happened to him, shall we?\"         *       *       *       *       *  As they rose to leave, a dumpy Earthwoman rushed up to them, enthusiastically babbling in Terran. Seizing Tarb's foot, she clung to it before the Fizbian girl could do anything to prevent her. Tarb had to spread her wings wide to retain her balance. Her cloak flew off and an adjoining table of diners disappeared beneath it.  [Illustration]  Stet and the headwaiter rushed to the rescue with profuse apologies, Stet's crest undulating as if it concealed a nest of snakes. But Tarb was too much frightened to be calmed.  \"Is this a hostile attack?\" she shrieked frantically at Stet. \"Because the handbook never said shaking feet was an Earth custom!\"  \"No, no, she's a friend!\" Stet yelled, leaving the diners still struggling with the cloak as he sped back to her.
