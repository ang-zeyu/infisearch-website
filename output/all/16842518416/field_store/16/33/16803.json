They then found their way to the club-room, held a council, and without a great deal of deliberation, it was resolved, every man for himself:  That, to prevent the future possibility of all the members of the club having black eyes at the same time, the members would, from this time forth, pursue their investigations singly, or in pairs--the optical adornment of a single person being bearable, but for all the club to be simultaneously thus affected, was a phenomenon not down in the bills.  The club then adjourned for convalescence.     FIRST EVENING WITH THE CLUB.  \"Dogs bark.\"--SHAKESPEARE.   As soon as the members of the Elephant Club had recovered their normal appearance, each issued forth alone to catch further glimpses of the colossal quadruped of the metropolis. Each was assiduous in pursuing his investigations, and all manifested a spirit of self-denial worthy of martyrs in the cause of scientific research. The quantity of bad liquors they drank in forming new acquaintances, it were useless to estimate; the horrible cigars they smoked with those acquaintances are beyond computation, and yet they never flagged for a moment. After a few days, thus passed, the Higholdboy thought it time the club should hear the reports of its members. He, accordingly, put up on the bulletin a notice, stating that he expected the attendance of every member on a certain evening.  The evening came, and with it came the members. The weather was sufficiently warm to admit of the windows being up, and a fine, cooling draught of air passed through the apartment. The gentlemen filled their pipes and proceeded to take it easy. Mr. Dropper hung himself upon two chairs; Boggs stretched himself upon a sofa; Van Dam took off his coat, rolled it up for a pillow, and laid himself out on the floor. Quackenbush put an easy-chair by the door, and seated himself there to act as sentinel. Mr. Spout, the Higholdboy, moved his official chair up to one of the windows, turned the back upon his fellow-members, seated himself, raised his feet to the window-casing, and said that, with his eyes looking out between the toes of his boots upon the tiles and chimney-pots, it could not be said he had seen any disorderly conduct, if the members should see fit to vary the monotony of the proceedings by getting up an extemporized row among themselves. Johnny Cake alone seemed aware that a necessity existed for the exhibition of proper dignity on the part of the meeting. He sat by the table proudly erect. His standing collar, neatly-tied cravat, and scrupulously clean exterior, corresponded with his prim deportment.  It became a serious question who should open his budget of experience first. There was no rule to coerce a member to commence; consequently, appeals were made to the magnanimity of each other. These were irresistible, and all suddenly became willing and even anxious to make the beginning.  Mr. Dropper, however, got the floor first. He insisted that he was not in the habit of appearing in large assemblies as a prominent participant in the proceedings, and, in consideration of this fact, he ventured to hope that his incipient efforts would not be judged of harshly.  Mr. Dropper's spasmodic modesty excited the boisterous mirth of his fellow-members.  Mr. Remington Dropper commenced:  \"Gentlemen of the Elephant Club,\" said he, \"the subject which I have to present for your consideration this evening is a remarkable instance of the _genus homo_ which I accidentally came across in my peregrinations a few evenings since. I was returning home from the theatre, and in passing a door-way in Broadway, I discovered a man seated on the stone step, with his form reclining against the door-casing. The gas-light shone directly in his face, which revealed to me the fact that he was asleep. The singularity of his personal appearance could not fail to attract my attention, and I stopped to study his form, features, and dress, to determine, if I could, who and what he was. His face had evidently been put up askew. The corner of his mouth, the eye and eyebrow on one side were inclined downward, giving him a demure and melancholy look; but on the other side they were inclined upwards, which made that side show a continued grin. A front view of his face was suggestive of both joy and melancholy, which was equal to no expression at all, as the expression on one side offset that of the other. His coat, which was buttoned tightly about him, was neither a dress nor a frock, but the skirts were rounded off in front, making it a compromise between the two. His pants were also a go-between; they were neither white nor black, but in point of color, were a pepper-and-salt formation. The leg on one side was rolled up. On one foot was a boot, on the other a shoe. He wore a very dirty collar, which, on the laughing side of his face was Byronic, and on the solemn side, uncompromisingly erect. His hat was an antiquated shanghae--black on the crown and light underneath the brim. If a noun, he was certainly a very uncommon, but not strictly a proper noun. If a verb, he seemed to be passive. The tense of his general appearance it would be difficult to determine. Strictly, it was neither past nor present, nor was it in accordance with my ideas of the future. To a certain extent it was all three. His seedy exterior was the remains of the past, existing in the present, and existing prospectively in the future. His mood was subjunctive, full of doubt and uncertainty. Judging from his entire appearance, I could come to no other conclusion as respects his character, than that he was a combination of ups and downs, a concentration of small differences, a specimen of non-committalism in everything except an entire abstinence from water used as a means of purifying his body externally, and his clothing. His red nose led me to suspect that he did not bathe with cold water to an alarming extent inwardly. The individual was remarkable, not for what he was, but for what he was not.  \"Such were my thoughts, gentlemen, and I determined to awake the unconscious sleeper, to see how far my conclusions were right. I shook him well, and accompanied my act with a peremptory order to 'get up.' After a moment he roused himself and looked at me, but immediately dropped his eyes. I commenced a dialogue with him, which, as near as I can recollect, was as follows:  \"'What are you doing here?' said I.  \"'Dun'no,' was the response.  \"'You're certainly quite drunk.'  \"'Likely.'  \"'That is an offence against the law.'  \"'Des'say.'  \"'You've been arrested for drunkenness before.'  \"'Werry like. But I 'aven't been a doin' nuthin' helse.'  \"'But I've arrested you before,' said I, playing the policeman, in order to continue the conversation.  \"'Des'say, hofficer; but did I hoffer any resistance?'  \"'Your weight did.'  \"'Vas it wiolent?'  \"'You were too drunk to make any violent resistance.'  \"'Des'say; I honly inquired for hinformation.'  \"'What's your name?'  \"'Vich name do you vant to know?'  \"'Your whole name, of course.'  \"'Bobinger Thomas.'  \"'Where were you born, Thomas?'  \"'Hingland.'  \"'What is your business?'  \"'My perwession?'  \"'Yes.'  \"'It's warious. I never dabbled with law, physic, or diwinity.'  \"'I asked you what your profession is--not what it isn't.'  \"'My perwession now, or vot it used to vos?'  \"'Your present profession, of course.'  \"'Vell--nuthin'.'  \"'Well, what was your profession in the past?'  \"'Vot do you vant to know for?'  \"'I shall answer no questions; but you must. Now tell me what your past profession was.'  [Illustration]  \"'Dogs.'  \"'Are you a dog-fancier?'  \"'Poss'bly; I fancies dogs.'  \"'What breed of dogs do you fancy?'  \"'Them as I gets in Jersey.'  \"'What do you do with the dogs that you get there?'  \"'I vouldn't go into the business if I vos in your sitivation. It don't pay any more, 'cause there's so many coves as has inwested. I left 'cause it vos hoverdid.'  \"'I hadn't the slightest intention of going into the business. I asked you for information.'  \"'Glad to 'ear you say so. I vos halmost hutterly ruined in it.'  \"'Well, what do you do with the dogs?'  \"'I doesn't follow the perwession no more.'  \"'I asked you what you did with the dogs you picked up in New Jersey.'  \"'They muzzles dogs now more than they did vonce.'  \"'Tell me what you did with the dogs.'  \"'If you nab a cove for gettin' drunk vot do they do vith 'im?'  \"'Are you going to answer my question?'  \"'Vill they let me off if I tell vere I got the liquor?'  \"'Look here, Thomas, answer my question.'  \"'Vot do they do vith the coves as sells?'  \"'I shan't trifle with you any longer. If you don't tell me what you do with the dogs, I shall enter a charge of vagrancy against you.'  \"'Vell, I didn't sell 'em for sassengers.'  \"'What did you sell them for?'  \"'I didn't sell 'em.'  \"'How did you dispose of them?'  \"'Is old Keene varden of the penitentiary now?'  \"'Tell me, now, what you did with the dogs.'  \"'I took 'em to the dog pound.'  \"'What did you do with them there?'  \"'Vy, doesn't they muzzle cats the same as dogs?'  \"'Look here, Thomas, you must answer my question without equivocation. I want to understand the details of this dog-business. What did you do with them at the dog-pound?'  \"'For hevery dog as ve takes to the pound ve gets an 'arf a slum.'  \"'Then it seems you caught your dogs in New Jersey, brought them to the New York dog-pound, and claimed for your philanthropic exertions the reward of a half a dollar, offered by ordinance for every dog caught within the limits of New York?'  \"'Vell, if you'd been born into the perwession, you couldn't have understood its vays better.'  \"'You are a sweet subject, certainly.'  \"'Des'say.'  \"'Are you not"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32285"],["title","Adventures of Bindle (#0)"],["body","OF BINDLE                          WHAT THIS BOOK IS ABOUT  This Bindle Book deals with the further adventures of Joseph Bindle, furniture remover. One of the criticisms levelled at \"The Night Club\" was that there was not enough of Bindle in it. In the new volume Bindle is there all the time.  The story is told of how he helped Mr. Hearty to advertise his new shop; how Lady Knob-Kerrick's drawing-room was, without her knowledge, turned into billets for soldiers; how Mrs. Bindle decided to take a lodger and what came of it; how Bindle became a porter at the Fulham Square Mansions and let the same flat to two people, and the complications that ensued; how he discouraged the Rev. Andrew MacFie's attentions to his niece, Millie Hearty.  In this volume reappear practically all those in the previous volume, including the gloomy Ginger, Wilkes, Huggles, Lady Knob-Kerrick, Dick Little, \"Guggers,\" Mr. and Mrs. Hearty, \"Millikins,\" together with a number of new characters.                            _BY THE SAME AUTHOR_    THE BINDLES ON THE ROCKS   BINDLE   THE NIGHT CLUB   JOHN DENE OF TORONTO   MALCOLM SAGE, DETECTIVE   MRS.

Even Bindle was startled by the emphasis with which Mrs. Bindle placed upon the supper-table a large pie-dish containing a savoury-smelling stew.  \"Anythink wrong?\" he enquired solicitously, gazing at Mrs. Bindle over the top of the evening paper.  \"Wrong!\" she cried. \"Is there anything right?\"  \"Well, there's beer, an' Beatty, an' the boys wot's fightin',\" began Bindle suggestively.  \"Don't talk to me!\" Mrs. Bindle banged a plate of stew in front of Bindle, to which he applied himself earnestly.  For some minutes the only sound was that occasioned by Bindle's enjoyment of his supper, as he proceeded to read the newspaper propped up in front of him.  \"You're nice company, aren't you?\" cried Mrs. Bindle, making a dive with the spoon at a potato, which she transferred to her plate. \"I might be on a desert island for all the company you are.\"  Bindle gazed at Mrs. Bindle over the small bone from which he was detaching the last vestiges of nutriment by means of his teeth. He replaced the bone on the edge of his plate in silence.  \"You think of nothing but your stomach,\" Mrs. Bindle continued angrily. \"Look at you now!\"  \"Well, now, ain't you funny!\" remarked Bindle, as he replaced his glass upon the table. \"If I'm chatty, you say, ''Old your tongue!' If I ain't chatty, you ask why I ain't a-makin' love to you.\"  After a moment's silence he continued meditatively: \"I kept rabbits, silkworms, an' a special kind o' performin' flea, an' I seemed to get to understand 'em all; but women--well, you may search me!\" and he pushed his plate from him as a sign of repletion.  Mrs. Bindle rose from the table. Bindle watched her curiously; it was never wise to enquire what course was to follow.  \"I answered an advertisement to-day,\" she announced, as she banged an apple-pie on the table.  With difficulty Bindle withdrew his interest from the pie to Mrs. Bindle's statement.  \"You don't say so,\" he remarked pleasantly.  \"And about time, I should think, with food going up as it is,\" she continued, as she hacked out a large V-shaped piece of pie-crust which she transferred to a plate, and proceeded to dab apple beside it.  Bindle regarded her uncomprehendingly.  \"In _The Gospel Sentinel_.\" She vouchsafed the information grudgingly and, rising, she fetched a paper from the dresser and threw it down in front of Bindle, indicating a particular part of the page with a vicious stab of her fore-finger.  Bindle picked up the paper. The spot indicated was the column headed \"Wanted.\" He read:      \"CHRISTIAN HOME wanted by a single gentleman, chapel-goer,     temperance, quiet, musical, home-comforts, good-cooking,     moderate terms. References given and required. Apply Lonely,     c/o _The Gospel Sentinel_.\"  Bindle looked up from the paper at Mrs. Bindle.  \"Well?\" she challenged.  He turned once more to the paper and re-read the advertisement with great deliberation, forgetful of his fast-cooling plate.  \"Well,\" remarked Bindle judicially, \"this is a Christian 'ome right enough, plenty of soap an' water, with an 'ymn or two thrown in so as you won't notice the smell. Cookin's good likewise, an' as for 'ome-comforts, if we ain't got 'em, who 'as? There's sweepin' an' scrubbin' an' mats everywhere, mustn't smoke in the parlour unless you 'appen to be the chimney, and of course there's you, the biggest 'ome-comfort of all. Yes! Mrs. B.,\" he concluded, shaking his head with gloomy conviction, \"we got enough 'ome comforts to start a colony, I'm always trippin' over 'em.\"  \"Eat your pie,\" snapped Mrs. Bindle, \"perhaps it'll stop your mouth.\"  Bindle applied himself to the apple-pie with obvious relish, glancing from time to time at _The Gospel Sentinel_.  \"Well?\" demanded Mrs. Bindle once more.  \"I was jest wonderin',\" said Bindle.  \"What about?\"  \"I was jest wonderin',\" continued Bindle, \"why we want a lodger, us like two love-birds a-singin' an' a-cooin' all day long.\"  \"What about the housekeeping?\" demanded Mrs. Bindle aggressively.  \"The 'ousekeepin'?\" enquired Bindle innocently.  \"Yes, the housekeeping,\" repeated Mrs. Bindle with rising wrath, as if Bindle were directly responsible, \"the housekeeping, I said, and food going up like--like----\"  \"'Ell,\" suggested Bindle helpfully.  \"How am I to make both ends meet?\" she demanded.  \"I suppose they must meet?\" he enquired tentatively.  \"Don't be a fool, Bindle!\" was the response.  \"I ain't goin' to be a fool with that there lodger 'angin' about,\" retorted Bindle. \"If 'e starts a-playin' about wi' my 'Ome Comfort, 'e'll find 'is jaw closed for alterations. I'm a desperate feller where my 'eart's concerned. There was poor 'ole 'Orace only the other day. Jest back from the front 'e was.\"  Bindle paused and shook his head mournfully.  \"Horace who?\" demanded Mrs. Bindle.  \"'Orace Gaze,\" replied Bindle. \"Nice cove too, 'e is.  \"''Ullo! 'Orace,' I calls out, when I see 'im jest a-comin' from the station with all 'is kit.  \"'Cheerio,' says 'e.  \"'The missis'll be glad to see you,' I says.  \"'She don't know I'm 'ere yet,' 'e says.  \"'Didn't you send 'er a telegram?' I asks.  \"'Telegram!' says 'e, 'not 'arf.'  \"'Why not?'  \"'Lord! ain't you a mug, Joe!' says 'e; 'you don't catch me a-trustin' women, I got my own way, I 'ave,' says 'e, mysterious like.  \"'What is it?' I asks 'im.  \"'Well, I goes 'ome,' says 'e, ''er thinkin' me at the front, rattles my key in the front door, then I nips round to the back, an' catches the blighter every time!'\"  \"I won't listen to your disgusting stories,\" said Mrs. Bindle angrily.  \"Disgustin'?\" said Bindle incredulously.  \"You've a lewd mind, Bindle.\"  \"Well, well!\" remarked Bindle, \"it's somethink to 'ave a mind at all, it's about the only thing they don't tax as war profits.\"  \"You'll have to be careful when the lodger comes.\" There was a note of grim warning in Mrs. Bindle's voice.  \"Lodgers ain't to be trusted,\" said Bindle oracularly. \"If you expects 'em to pinch your money-box, orf they goes with your missis; an' if you're 'opin' it'll be your missis, blowed if they don't pouch the canary. No!\" he concluded with conviction, \"lodgers ain't to be depended on.\"  \"That's right, go on; but you're not hurting me,\" snapped Mrs. Bindle, rising to clear away. \"You always oppose me, perhaps you'll tell me how I'm to feed you on your wages.\" She stood, her hands on her hips, looking down upon Bindle with challenge in her eye.  \"My wages! why, I'm gettin'----\"  \"Never mind what you're getting,\" interrupted Mrs. Bindle. \"You eat all you get and more, and you know it. Look at the price of food, and me"]]]
