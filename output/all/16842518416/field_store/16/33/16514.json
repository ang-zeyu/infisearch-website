Meir of Rameru, later the son-in-law of Rashi, also studied at the academies of Lorraine, though probably not at the same time as Rashi, but a short while after.  As is natural, it was of his teachers that Rashi preserved the most faithful recollections, and he refers to them as authoritative even after he had surpassed them in knowledge and reputation.  He does not always mention their names in repeating their opinions.  If it were possible to make a distinction and decide the authorship of each sentence, it would be found that we are not far from the truth in asserting that the greater part of the pupil's work was the work of his masters.[20]  But in literature, as elsewhere, honor does not redound to the workmen who have gotten the material together, but to the architect,  wise and skilful [skillful sic], who conceives and carries out the plan for the entire edifice, and, with the stones others have brought, constructs a monument of vast proportions.                             CHAPTER III                     RASHI AT TROYES-LAST YEARS  The youth Rashi has now completed his apprenticeship; in his studies and travels he has amassed a vast store of information, which he will use for the profit of his contemporaries and of posterity; and he now believes himself in possession of sufficient knowledge and experience to strike out for himself. Moreover, he must now provide for his family-we have seen that he married while still a student.  But he does not give up his studies.  His change of abode was the only change in his life, a life of remarkable unity, the life of a student.  Rashi gave himself up entirely to study, to study without cessation, and to teaching; but teaching is only a form of pursuing one's studies and summing them up.                                  I  Detailed and comprehensive though the Talmudic studies were, nevertheless the student, especially if he was gifted, completed the course when he was not much more than twenty years of age. Rashi, then, was probably close to twenty-five years old when he returned from Mayence.  This return marks an epoch in the history of rabbinical literature.  From that time, the study of the Talmud was cultivated not alone upon the banks of the Rhine, but also in Champagne, which came to rival and soon supplant Lorraine, and having freed itself from the subjection of the Rhenish schools, radiated the light of science.  Jews from all over Christian Europe gathered there to bask in the warmth of the new home of Jewish learning.  Less than ten centuries earlier, the same thing had happened when Rab transplanted the teaching of the Law from Palestine to Babylonia, and founded an academy at Sura, which, for a while rivalling [rivaling sic] the Palestinian schools, soon eclipsed them, and finally became the principal centre [center sic] of Jewish science.  The Kabbalist was not so very far from the truth when he believed that the soul of Rab had passed into the body of Rashi.  It is noteworthy that this upgrowth of Talmudic schools in Champagne coincides with the literary movement then beginning in Christian France.  In emerging from the barbarous state of the early middle ages, it seems that the same breath of life quickened the two worlds.  The city of Troyes played an especially important role in matters intellectual and religious.  A number of large councils were held there, and the ecclesiastical school of Troyes enjoyed a brilliant reputation, having trained scholars such as Olbert, Pierre Comestor, Pierre de Celle, and William of the White Hands.  And it was near Troyes that the mighty voices of Abelard and Saint Bernard resounded.  There is a curious reminder of Rashi's sojourn at Troyes.  As late as 1840 an ancient butcher shop was still standing, into which, it was remarked, flies never entered.  Jewish tradition has it that the shop was built on the spot previously occupied by Rashi's dwelling-hence its miraculous immunity.  The same legend is found among the Christians, but they ascribe the freedom from flies to the protection of Saint Loup, the patron saint of the city, who himself worked the miracle.  Rashi is linked with Troyes in ways more natural as well.  As I have said, certain expressions occur in his works which he himself says refer to his city.  Some scholars have even stated that they recognized in the language he used the dialect of Troyes, a variety of the speech of Champagne, itself a French patois.  It is probable that Rashi-who was never at the head of the Talmudic schools of Worms or Prague, as the legends go-exercised the functions of a rabbi at Troyes, that he never kept himself exclusively within the confines of his school, 'and that he felt it his duty to instruct all his fellow-Jews.  In conjunction with his intellectual endowments, he possessed faith and charity, the true sources of strength in religious leadership.  He was the natural champion of the weak,[21] the judge and supervisor of all acts.  He pronounced judgment in cases more or less distantly connected with religion, that is, in nearly all cases at a period so thoroughly religious in character.  Either because he had been appointed their rabbi by the faithful, or because he enjoyed great prestige, Rashi was the veritable spiritual chief of the community, and even exercised influence upon the surrounding communities.  The man to preside over the religious affairs of the Jews was chosen not so much for his birth and breeding as for his scholarship and piety, since the rabbi was expected to distinguish himself both in learning and in character.  \"He who is learned, gentle, and modest,\" says the Talmud, \"and who is beloved of men, he should be judge in his city.\" As will soon be made clear, Rashi fulfilled this ideal.  His piety and amiability, in as great a degree as his learning, won for him the admiration of his contemporaries and of posterity.  At Troyes there was no room for another at the head of the community.  Like most of the rabbis of the time, Rashi accepted no compensation from the community for his services, and he probably lived from what he earned by viticulture.  Once he begs a correspondent to excuse the shortness of his letter, because he and his family were busy with the vintage.  \"All the Jews,\" he said, \"are at this moment engaged in the vineyards.\" In a letter to his son-in-law Meir, he gives a description of the wine- presses of Troyes, in the installation of which a change had been made.  It was deemed fitting that the scholar should provide for the needs of his family; the law in fact imposed it upon him as a duty.  \"Religious study not accompanied by work of the hands is barren and leads to sin.\" The functions of a rabbi were purely honorific in character, dignifying, and unrelated in kind to' mercantile goods, for which one receives pay.  It was forbidden to make the law a means of earning one's living or a title to glory. \"He who profits by his studies or who studies for his own interest, compromises his salvation.\"  When the religious representative showed such devotion and disinterestedness, the pious willingly submitted themselves to his authority.  The spiritual heads of the communities had as great ascendency [ascendancy sic] over believing Jews as a king had over his subjects; they were sovereigns in the realm of the spirit.  And Rashi in his time, because of his learning and piety, exercised the most undisputed authority.  His influence though not so great was comparable, in the sphere in which it could be exercised, with that of the great Saint Bernard upon the entire Christian world, or with that of Maimonides upon Judaism in the Arabic countries.  People in all circumstances and from all the surrounding countries addressed themselves to him; and to the list of his correspondents in Lorraine may be added the names of several French rabbis, the \"wise men\" of Auxerre, the scholar Solomon of Tours, whom Rashi calls his dear friend, his kinsman Eleazar, and R. Aaron the Elder.  His correspondence on learned questions was so large that sometimes, as when he was ill, for instance, he would have his disciples or relatives help him out with it.[22]  About 1070 Rashi founded a school at Troyes, which soon became the centre [center sic] of instruction in the Talmud for the whole region.  As we have seen, Gershom trained a number of disciples who directed schools, each of which pursued a particular course.  Rashi united these various tendencies, as, later, his work put an end to the activity of the commentators of the Talmud.  An explanation is thus afforded of the legend repeated by Basnage in these words: \"He made a collection of the difficulties he had heard decided during his travels.  On his return to Europe he went to all the academies and disputed with the professors about the questions which they were discussing; then he threw to the floor a page of his collections, which gave a solution of the problem, and so ended the controversy, without, however, mentioning the name of the author of the decision.  It is alleged that these leaves scattered in thousands of places were gathered together, and that from them was composed the commentary on the Talmud.\"  The legend attests Rashi's great reputation.  While he was still quite young, his renown had rapidly spread.  When in Lorraine, he had from time to time paid a visit to Troyes, and so, later, when definitely established in Champagne, he maintained relations with his masters, especially with Isaac ha-Levi, whom he visited and with whom he corresponded in the interim of his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31664"],["title","Once a Greech (#0)"],["body","a Greech                                  By EVELYN E.

S. Herringbone_ of the Interstellar Exploration, Examination (and Exploitation) Service was due to start her return journey to Earth, one of her scouts disconcertingly reported the discovery of intelligent life in the Virago System.  \"Thirteen planets,\" Captain Iversen snarled, wishing there were someone on whom he could place the blame for this mischance, \"and we spend a full year here exploring each one of them with all the resources of Terrestrial science and technology, and what happens? On the nineteenth moon of the eleventh planet, intelligent life is discovered. And who has to discover it? Harkaway, of all people. I thought for sure all the moons were cinders or I would never have sent him out to them just to keep him from getting in my hair.\"  \"The boy's not a bad boy, sir,\" the first officer said. \"Just a thought incompetent, that's all--which is to be expected if the Service will choose its officers on the basis of written examinations. I'm glad to see him make good.\"  Iversen would have been glad to see Harkaway make good, too, only such a concept seemed utterly beyond the bounds of possibility. From the moment the young man had first set foot on the _S. S. Herringbone_, he had seemed unable to make anything but bad. Even in such a conglomeration of fools under Captain Iverson, his idiocy was of outstanding quality.  The captain, however, had not been wholly beyond reproach in this instance, as he himself knew. Pity he had made such an error about the eleventh planet's moons. It was really such a small mistake. Moons one to eighteen and twenty to forty-six still appeared to be cinders. It was all too easy for the spectroscope to overlook Flimbot, the nineteenth.  But it would be Flimbot which had turned out to be a green and pleasant planet, very similar to Earth. Or so Harkaway reported on the intercom.  \"And the other forty-five aren't really moons at all,\" he began. \"They're--\"  \"You can tell me all that when we reach Flimbot,\" Iversen interrupted, \"which should be in about six hours. Remember, that intercom uses a lot of power and we're tight on fuel.\"  But it proved to be more than six _days_ later before the ship reached Flimbot. This was owing to certain mechanical difficulties that arose when the crew tried to lift the mother ship from the third planet, on which it was based. For sentimental reasons, the IEE(E) always tried to establish its prime base on the third planet of a system. Anyhow, when the _Herringbone_ was on the point of takeoff, it was discovered that the rock-eating species which was the only life on the third planet had eaten all the projecting metal parts on the ship, including the rocket-exhaust tubes, the airlock handles and the chromium trim.  \"I had been wondering what made the little fellows so sick,\" Smullyan, the ship's doctor, said. \"They went wump, wump, wump all night long, until my heart bled for them. Ah, everywhere it goes, humanity spreads the fell seeds of death and destruction--\"  \"Are you a doctor or a veterinarian?\" Iversen demanded furiously. \"By Betelgeuse, you act as if I'd crammed those blasted tubes down their stinking little throats!\"  \"It was you who invaded their paradise with your ship. It was you--\"  \"Shut up!\" Iversen yelled. \"Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!\"  So Dr. Smullyan went off, like many a ship's physician before him, and got good and drunk on the medical stores.         *       *       *       *       *  By the time they finally arrived on Flimbot, Harkaway had already gone native. He appeared at the airlock wearing nothing but a brief, colorful loincloth of alien fabric and a wreath of flowers in his hair. He was fondling a large, woolly pink caterpillar.  [Illustration]  \"Where is your uniform, sir!\" Captain Iversen barked, aghast. If there was one thing he was intolerant of in his command, it was sloppiness.  \"This is the undress uniform of the Royal Flimbotzi Navy, sir. I was given the privilege of wearing one as a great _msu'gri_--honor--to our race. If I were to return to my own uniform, it might set back diplomatic relations between Flimbot and Earth as much as--\"  \"All right!\" the captain snapped. \"All right, all right, all right!\"  He didn't ask any questions about the Royal Flimbotzi Navy. He had deduced its nature when, on nearing Flimbot, he had discovered that the eleventh planet actually had only one moon. The other forty-five celestial objects were spacecraft, quaint and primitive, it was true, but spacecraft nonetheless. Probably it was their orbital formation that had made him think they were moons. Oh, the crew must be in great spirits; they did so enjoy having a good laugh at his expense!  He looked for something with which to reproach Harkaway, and his eye lighted on the caterpillar. \"What's that thing you're carrying there?\" he barked.  Raising itself on its tail, the caterpillar barked right back at him.  Captain Iversen paled. First he had overlooked the spacecraft, and now, after thirty years of faithful service to the IEE(E) in the less desirable sectors of space, he had committed the ultimate error in his first contact with a new form of intelligent life!  \"Sorry, sir,\" he said, forgetting that the creature--whatever its mental prowess--could hardly be expected to understand Terran yet. \"I am just a simple spaceman and my ways are crude, but I mean no harm.\" He whirled on Harkaway. \"I thought you said the natives were humanoid.\"  The young officer grinned. \"They are. This is just a greech. Cuddly little fellow, isn't he?\" The greech licked Harkaway's face with a tripartite blue tongue. \"The Flimbotzik are mad about pets. Great animal-lovers. That's how I knew I could trust them right from the start. Show me a life-form that loves animals, I always say, and--\"  \"I'm not interested in what you always say,\" Iversen interrupted, knowing Harkaway's premise was fundamentally unsound, because he himself was the kindliest of all men, and he hated animals. And, although he didn't hate Harkaway, who was not an animal, save in the strictly Darwinian sense, he could not repress unsportsmanlike feelings of bitterness.  Why couldn't it have been one of the other officers who had discovered the Flimbotzik? Why must it be Harkaway--the most inept of his scouts, whose only talent seemed to be the egregious error, who always rushed into a thing half-cocked, who mistook superficialities for profundities, Harkaway, the blundering fool, the blithering idiot--who had stumbled into this greatest discovery of Iversen's career? And, of course, Harkaway's, too. Well, life was like that and always had been.  \"Have you tested those air and soil samples yet?\" Iversen snarled into his communicator, for his spacesuit was beginning to itch again as the gentle warmth of Flimbot activated certain small and opportunistic life-forms which had emigrated from a previous system along with the Terrans.  \"We're running them through as fast as we can, sir,\" said a harried voice. \"We can offer you no more than our poor best.\"  \"But why bother with all that?\" Harkaway wanted to know. \"This planet is absolutely safe for human life. I can guarantee it personally.\"  \"On what basis?\" Iversen asked.  \"Well, I've been here two weeks and I've survived, haven't I?\"  \"That,\" Iversen told him, \"does not prove that the planet can sustain human life.\"  Harkaway laughed richly. \"Wonderful how you can still keep that marvelous sense of humor, Skipper, after all the things that have been going wrong on the voyage. Ah, here comes the _flim'tuu_--the welcoming committee,\" he said quickly. \"They were a little shy before. Because of the rockets, you know.\"  \"Don't their ships have any?\"  \"They don't seem to. They're really very primitive affairs, barely able to go from planet to planet.\"  \"If they _go_,\" Iversen said, \"stands to reason _something_ must power them.\"  \"I really don't know what it is,\" Harkaway retorted defensively. \"After all, even though I've been busy as a beaver, three weeks would hardly give me time to investigate every aspect of their culture.... Don't you think the natives are remarkably humanoid?\" he changed the subject.  They were, indeed. Except for a somewhat greenish cast of countenance and distinctly purple hair, as they approached, in their brief, gay garments and flower garlands, the natives resembled nothing so much as a group of idealized South Sea Islanders of the nineteenth century.  Gigantic butterflies whizzed about their heads. Countless small animals frisked about their feet--more of the pink caterpillars; bright blue creatures that were a winsome combination of monkey and koala; a kind of large, merry-eyed snake that moved by holding its tail in its mouth and rolling like a hoop. All had faces that reminded the captain of the work of the celebrated twentieth-century artist W. Disney.  \"By Polaris,\" he cried in disgust, \"I might have known you'd find a _cute_ planet!\"  \"Moon, actually,\" the first officer said, \"since it is in orbit around Virago XI, rather than Virago itself.\"  \"Would you have _wanted_ them to be hostile?\" Harkaway asked peevishly. \"Honestly, some people never seem to be satisfied.\"  From his proprietary airs, one would think Harkaway had created the natives himself. \"At least, with hostile races, you know where you are,\" Iversen said. \"I always suspect friendly life-forms. Friendliness simply isn't a natural instinct.\"  \"Who's being anthropomorphic now!\" Harkaway chided.  Iversen flushed, for he had berated the young man for that"]]]
