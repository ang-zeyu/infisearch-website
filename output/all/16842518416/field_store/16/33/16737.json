The poor ignorant people on the Shrine had to be coddled, like the children they were. Damn!  Karnes crumpled the sheets of paper in his hands, twisting them savagely. Then he methodically tore them into bits.         *       *       *       *       *  When the first dawnlight touched the sea, Karnes was watching it out the east window. It had been twenty-four hours since he had seen the superman walk into his gray globe and vanish.  All night, he had been searching his brain for some clue that would tell him which of the two choices he should believe in. And he couldn't bring himself to believe in either.  Once he had thought: _Why do I believe, then, what the impressor said? Why not just forget it?_  But that didn't help. He _did_ believe it. That alien instrument had impressed his mind, not only with the facts themselves, but with an absolute faith that they _were_ facts. There was no room for doubt; the knowledge imparted to his mind was true, and he knew it.  For a time, he had been comforted by the thought that the gray globe must be a time machine because of the way it had vanished. It was very comforting until he realized that travel to the stars and beyond didn't necessarily mean a spaceship as he knew spaceships. Teleportation--  Now, with the dawn, Karnes knew there was only one thing he could do.  Somehow, somewhere, there would be other clues--clues a man who knew what to look for might find. The Galactics couldn't be perfect, or they wouldn't have let him get the mind impressor in his hands. Ergo, somewhere they would slip again.  Karnes knew he would spend the rest of his life looking for that one slip. He had to know the truth, one way or another.  Or he might not stay sane.         *       *       *       *       *  Lansberg picked him up at eight in a police copter. As they floated toward New York, Karnes' mind settled itself into one cold purpose; a purpose that lay at the base of his brain, waiting.  Lansberg was saying: \"--and one of Brittain's men got the stuff last night. He hadn't passed it on to Brittain himself yet this morning, but he very probably will have by the time we get there.  \"We've rigged it up so that Brittain will have to pass it to his superior by tomorrow or it will be worthless. When he does, we'll follow it right to the top.\"  \"If we've got every loophole plugged,\" said Karnes, \"we ought to take them easy.\"  \"Brother, I hope so! It took us eight months to get Brittain all hot and bothered over the bait, and another two months to give it to him in a way that wouldn't make him suspicious.  \"It's restricted material, of course, so that we can pin a subversive activities rap on them, at least, if not espionage. But we had to argue like hell to keep it restricted; the Spatial Commission was ready to release it, since it's really relatively harmless.\"  Karnes looked absently at the thin line of smoke wiggling from Lansberg's cigarette.  \"You know,\" he said, \"there are times when I wish this war would come right out in the open. Actually, we've been fighting the League for years, but we don't admit it. There have been little disagreements and incidents until the devil won't have it. But it's still supposed to be a 'worry war'.\"  Lansberg shrugged. \"It will get hot just as soon as the Eurasian League figures they are far enough along in spacecraft construction to get the Martian colonies if they win. Then they'll try to smash us before we can retaliate; then, and not before.  \"We can't start it. Our only hope is that when they start, they'll underestimate us. Say, what's that you're fooling with?\"  The sudden change of subject startled Karnes for an instant. He looked at the mind impressor in his hands. He had been toying with it incessantly, hoping it would repeat its performance, or perhaps give additional information.  \"This?\" He covered quickly. \"It's a--a puzzle. One of those plastic puzzles.\" _Maybe it doesn't work on the same person twice. If I can get George to fool around with it, he might hit the right combination again._  \"Hmmm. How does it work?\" George seemed interested.  Karnes handed it to him. \"It has a couple of little sliding weights inside it. You have to turn the thing just right to unlock it, then it comes apart when you slide out a section of the surface. Try it.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Lansberg took it, turned it this way and that, moving his hands over the surface. Karnes watched him for several minutes, but there didn't seem to be any results.  Lansberg looked up from his labors. \"I give up. I can't even see where it's supposed to come apart, and I can't feel any weights sliding inside it. Show me how it works.\"  Karnes thought fast. \"Why do you think I was fiddling with it? I don't know how it works. A friend of mine bet me a ten spot that I couldn't figure out the combination.\"  Lansberg looked back at the impressor in his hands. \"Could he do it?\"  \"A snap. I watched him twice, and I still didn't get it.\"  \"Mmm. Interesting.\" George went back to work on the \"puzzle.\"  Just before they landed on the roof of the UN annex, Lansberg handed the impressor back to Karnes. It had obviously failed to do what either of them had hoped it would.  \"It's your baby,\" Lansberg said, shaking his head. \"All I have to say is it's a hell of a way to earn ten bucks.\"  Karnes grinned and dropped the thing back in his coat pocket.  By the time that evening had rolled around, Karnes was beginning to get just a little bored. He and Lansberg had been in and out of the New York office in record time. Then they had spent a few hours with New York's Finest and the District Attorney, lining up a net to pick up all the little rats involved.  After that, there was nothing to do but wait.  Karnes slept a couple of hours to catch up, read two magazines from cover to cover, and played eight games of solitaire. He was getting itchy.  His brain kept crackling. _What's the matter with me? I ought to be thinking about this Brittain fellow instead of--_  But, after all, what did Brittain matter? According to the records, he was born Alex Bretinov, in Marseilles, France, in nineteen sixty-eight. His father, a dyed-in-the-wool Old Guard Communist, had been born in Minsk in nineteen forty.  _Or had he been wound up, and his clockwork started in January of nineteen fifty-three?_  The radio popped. \"Eighteen. Alert. Brittain just left his place on foot. Carson, Reymann following. Over.\"  Lansberg dropped his magazine. \"He seems to be heading for the Big Boy--I hope.\"  The ground car followed him to a subway, and two men on foot followed him in from Flatbush Avenue.         *       *       *       *       *  Some hours later, after much devious turning, dodging, and switching, Brittain climbed into a taxi on the corner of Park Avenue and Forty-seventh Street, evidently feeling he had ditched any tails he might have had.  Karnes and Lansberg were right behind him in a radio car.  The cab headed due south on Park Avenue, following it until it became Fourth, swung right at Tenth Street, past Grace Church, across Broadway. At Sixth, it angled left toward Greenwich Village.  \"Somewhere in the Village, nickels to knotholes,\" Lansberg guessed as he turned to follow.  Karnes, at the radio, was giving rapid-fire directions over the scrambler-equipped transceiver. By this time, several carloads of agents and police were converging on the cab from every direction. From high above, could be heard the faint hum of 'copters.  Lansberg was exultant. \"We've got them for once! And the goods on every essobee in the place.\"  The cars hummed smoothly through the broad streets, past the shabby-genteel apartment neighborhood. Back in the early sixties, some of these buildings had been high-priced hotels, but the Village had gone to pot since the seventies.  A few minutes later, the cab pulled up in front of an imposing looking building of slightly tarnished aluminum paneling. Brittain got out, paid his fare, and went inside.  As the cab pulled away, Karnes gave orders for it to be picked up a few blocks away, just in case.  The rest of the vehicles began to surround the building.  Karnes, meanwhile, followed Brittain into the foyer of the apartment hotel. It was almost a mistake. Brittain hadn't gone in. Evidently attracted by the footsteps following him, he turned and looked back out. Karnes wasn't more than ten feet away.  _Just pretend you live here_, thought Karnes, _and bully-boy will never know the difference_.  He walked right on up to the doorway, pretending not to notice Brittain. Evidently, the saboteur was a little flustered, not quite knowing who Karnes was. He, too, pretended that he had no suspicions. He pressed a buzzer on the panel to announce himself to a guest. Karnes noticed it was 523; a fifth floor button.  The front door, inside the foyer, was one of those gadgets with an electric lock that doesn't open unless you either have a key to the building or can get a friend who lives there to let you in.  When Karnes saw Brittain press the buzzer, he waited a second and took a chance.  \"Here,\" he said, fishing in his pocket, \"I'll let you in.\" _That ought to give him the impression I live here._  Brittain smiled fetchingly. \"Thanks, but I--\"  Bzzzz! The old-fashioned lock announced that it was open. Karnes stopped fishing and opened the door, letting Brittain follow him in. He stayed in the lead to the elevator, and pushed the button marked \"4.\"  \"You getting off before four?\" he asked conversationally.  \"No.\"  The elevator slid on up to four without another word being said by either man.  Karnes was judging the speed of the elevator, estimating the time it took for the doors to open as they did so, and making quick mental comparisons with his own ability to climb stairs at a run. The elevator was an old one, and fairly slow--  When the doors slid open, he stepped out and began to walk easily down the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32088"],["title","Instant of Decision (#3)"],["body","toward the stairway. When the elevator clicked shut, he broke into a run and hit the stairway at top speed, his long legs taking the steps three at a time.  The stairway was poorly lit, since it was hardly ever used, and, at the fifth floor, he was able to conceal himself in the darkness as Brittain turned up the hall toward 523.  Karnes looked closely at his surroundings for the first time. There was a well-worn, but not ragged, nylon carpet on the floor, dull chrome railing on the stair bannisters, and the halls were lit by old-fashioned glo-plates in the ceiling. The place was inexpensive, but not cheap.  Having made sure that Brittain actually had entered 523, he stepped back toward the elevator in order to notify Lansberg.  A sudden voice said: \"You lookin' for-a somebody, meester?\"  Karnes turned. An elderly man with a heavy mustache and a heavy body stood partway up the stairs, clad in slacks and shirt.  \"Who are you?\" frowned Karnes.  \"I'm Amati, the supratendent. Why?\" The scowl was heavy.  Karnes couldn't take any chances. The man might be perfectly okay, but--         *       *       *       *       *  Lansberg's steps sounded, coming up the stairs. With him was a Manhattan Squad officer of the Police Department.  \"Shhh, Mr. Amati. C'mere a minute,\" said the cop.  \"Oh. Lootenant Carnotti. Whatsa--\"  \"Shhhhhh! C'mere, I said, and be quiet!\"  \"You know this man?\" Lansberg asked the policeman softly, indicating Amati.  \"Sure. He's okay.\"  Lansberg turned to the superintendent. \"What do you know about the guy who just came in?\"  Amati seemed to have realized that something serious was going on, for his voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper. \"I dunno. I don't-a see who it is. Whatsa goin' on, Lootenant Carnotti?\"  \"What about Apartment 523? Who lives there?\" asked Karnes.  \"Oh, them? Meester and Meeses Seigert. Artists. Sheesa paint pictures, heesa make statues.\" Then Amati's eyes widened knowingly. \"Ohhh! You guys da Vice Squad, eh? I _theenk_ theresa someteeng fonny about them!\"  Footsteps sounded coming down the stairs from above.  \"We watched the indicator needle on the elevator door in the lobby, and I signalled the 'copters on the roof,\" Lansberg whispered.  The hallway began to fill quietly with police.  Lieutenant Carnotti assigned one of the men to watch Amati, mainly in order to keep him out of the way, and Karnes led the men down the hall towards 523, guns drawn.  Karnes knocked boldly on the door.  \"Yeah? Who is it?\" asked someone inside.  Karnes pitched his voice a little lower than normal, and said: \"It's-a me, Meester Amati, only me, the soopratendant.\"  The imitation wasn't perfect, but the muffling effect of the door would offset any imperfections.  \"Oh, sure, Mr. Amati. Just a sec.\" There was a short pause, filled with muffled conversation, then somebody was unlocking the door.         *       *       *       *       *  Things began to happen fast. As the door came open, Karnes saw that it had one of those inside chain locks on it that permit the door to be opened only a few inches. Without hesitation, he threw his weight against the door. Lansberg was right behind him.  Under the combined weight of the two men, the chain ripped out of the woodwork, permitting the door to swing free. As it did so, it slammed into the face of the man who had opened it, knocking him backwards.  There were seven or eight other men and two women in the room. One of the men already had a heavy pistol out and was aiming it at the doorway. Karnes dropped to the floor and fired just as the other's pistol went off.  The high-velocity three millimeter slug whined through the air above Karnes' head and buried itself in Lansberg's shoulder. Lansberg dropped, spun halfway around from the shock. His knees hit Karnes in the back.  Karnes lurched forward a little, and regained his balance. Something flew out of his coat pocket and skittered across the floor. Karnes didn't notice what it was until one of the men across the room picked it up.  Brittain had picked up the mind impressor!  Karnes was aware that there were more men behind him firing at another of the conspirators who had made the mistake of drawing a weapon, but he wasn't interested too much. He was watching Brittain.  It only took seconds, but to Karnes it seemed like long minutes. Brittain had evidently thought the impressor was a weapon when he picked it up, and, after seeing his mistake, had started to throw it at the door. Then the impressor shimmered slightly, as though there were a hot radiator between the observor and the object. Brittain stopped, paralyzed, his eyes widening.  Then he gasped and threw the impressor against the floor as hard as he could.  \"_NO!_\" he screamed, \"_IT'S A LIE!_\"  The impressor struck the floor and broke. From its shattered interior came a blinding multi-colored glare. Then there was darkness. Karnes fainted.  When Karnes awoke, one of the policemen was shaking him.  \"Wake up, Mr. Karnes, wake up!\"  Karnes sat up abruptly. \"What happened?\" He had no time to be original.  \"I don't know for sure. One of the Leaguers threw a gas bomb of some sort, and it knocked out everyone in the room. Funny, though, it even knocked out all the Leaguers. When the rest of the boys came in, everybody was out cold on the floor. Most of them are coming out of it now, except for two of the Leaguers. They got some lead in them, though, not gas.\"  Karnes stood up. He felt a little dizzy, but otherwise there wasn't anything wrong. He surveyed the room.  On the floor was a slightly yellowed spot where the impressor had flared and vanished. Lansberg was unconscious with a copiously bleeding right shoulder. Two other men were rapidly being brought around by the police. Three of the League agents were still out; nobody tried to wake them up, they were being handcuffed.  One of the women was crying and cursing the \"damned filthy Nations police\" over one of the bodies, and the other woman was sitting stonily, staring at her handcuffs with a faint sneer.  \"Where's Brittain?\" roared Karnes. The man was nowhere in the room.  \"Gone,\" said one of the cops. \"Evidently he skipped out while the rest of us were unconscious. He was the guy who threw the bomb.\"  Karnes glanced at his watch. One sixteen in the morning. They had been out about twelve or thirteen minutes.  \"Where the devil did he go? How in--\"  Lieutenant Carnotti came up to him, a look of self-disgust on his face. \"I know how he got away, Mr. Karnes; I just talked to the boys on the roof. He grabbed a uniform coat and cap off Sergeant Joseph while he was out and commandeered a 'copter on the roof.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Karnes didn't wait for further information. He ran out into the hall and into the open elevator. Within less than a minute, he was on the roof.  One cop was speaking rapidly into a transmitter.  \"--number 3765. Left about ten minutes ago, supposedly for the hospital. Officer Powers in the 'copter with him.\"  He cut off and looked at Karnes, who was standing over him. His gun was out before he spoke. \"Who are you, buddy.\"  Karnes told him who he was. The cop looked skeptical. Karnes didn't have his hat on, and his clothes were a bit rumpled after his nap on the floor.  Karnes didn't need to say anything; another policeman was going through his pockets, and he found the billfold. As soon as they saw the forgeproof identity card, they relaxed.  \"Sorry, Mr. Karnes,\" said the man at the transceiver, \"but we've already let one man get away.\"  Karnes nodded. \"I know. Pure blind luck that his suit was almost the same shade as that gray uniform you guys wear, or he'd never have got away with it. All he needed was the jacket and cap.\"  \"Have any idea which way he went?\"  The cop shrugged. \"He came up here and told us that three men had been shot down below and some more gassed. He said Mr. Lansberg had sent him for a hospital call. Then he jumped in a 'copter with Powers and headed northeast. We didn't pay much attention. After all, he was wearing a sergeant's stripes.\"  Northeast. That would be toward Long Island. But, naturally, he would circle; he wouldn't be dumb enough to head in the right direction until he was out of sight. Or would he?  \"Get on that radio again,\" he told the radioman, \"--and tell them I want that man alive. Get that--_alive!_\"  \"Right.\" The officer switched on his microphone and began to talk.  Karnes pinched the bridge of his nose and closed his eyes in an attempt to concentrate. With Lansberg shot up, that put the Brittain case in his hands. Theoretically, he should be pumping the prisoners down below to find out how much higher the spy ring went.         *       *       *       *       *  But his real interest lay in Brittain, himself. There was no doubt that he had received another message from the impressor before he had thrown it down.  Evidently, when the thing broke, the unknown energies which powered it had short-circuited, paralyzing everyone in the room with their mind-impressing effect.  Then why hadn't it affected Brittain? Perhaps his recent exposure to a normal dosage had immunized him. There was no way of knowing--there never would be.  But what was the message Brittain had received from the impressor that would make him react so violently? It couldn't be the same one that he, Karnes, had received.  Continued on Stratum Two!  Sure; that was it! Like the pages in a book. He, himself, had been hit with page one; Brittain had page two. Page three? Lost forever.  Why hadn't they found that 'copter by now? It ought to be easy enough to spot.  He walked over to the edge of the building and looked down. The police were herding the prisoners into the ground cars. Presently, they were gone. One of the police officers touched his shoulder.  \"Ready to go, Mr. Karnes?\"  Karnes nodded and climbed into the 'copter. The machine lifted and headed toward the Central Police Station.  He was still trying to think when the phone rang. The"]]]
