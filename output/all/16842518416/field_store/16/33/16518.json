[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31665"],["title","Skin Game (#1)"],["body",", for the grouped huts were unimpressive, looking somewhat like a primitive African village back on Earth. But the Earthling would have preferred the most primitive Earth native to these serpents. In the distance, the slim nose of the rocket ship pointed the way to freedom, and Sheckly looked longingly at it.  At one end of the village was a small mountain of what appeared to be plastic clothing, milkily translucent--which was strange, since these creatures wore no clothing. The Earthling wondered at this but did not ask about it. Other thoughts more important troubled him.  \"In here,\" the interpreter told him, stopping before the largest hut.  Hesitating briefly, Sheckly entered and the creature followed him in. Seated on the floor were the leader and his mate and several smaller reptiles that evidently were the children. Between them lay several bowls of food. Sheckly grimaced and turned hastily away as he saw small crawling insects in one bowl.  \"Sit down,\" the interpreter directed.  Harding was not in evidence. \"Where is my companion?\" he asked.  The interpreter conferred briefly with the leader, then told Sheckly, \"He could not come. Sit down--eat.\"  Sheckly sat down, but he didn't feel like eating. He wondered _why_ Harding could not come. At a sudden thought, he said, \"I have rations on my ship--\"  \"Eat,\" the interpreter said, gripping his sword.  Sheckly nodded weakly and reached out for the bowl of fruit, taking one that resembled that which Harding had eaten the previous night. It wasn't bad. The leader stuffed a fistful of squirming insects in his mouth and offered the bowl to Sheckly, who shook his head as politely as he could and indicated the fruit in his hand.  Fortunately, the serpentman did not insist on his taking anything other than fruit, so the meal passed without physical discomfort.  When they were through, the leader hissed several syllables to the interpreter, who said, \"The leader wishes to see your games. You will set them up now.\"  Sheckly ran his tongue over dry lips. \"They're in the ship,\" he said, and eagerness crept into his voice. \"I'll have to get them.\" Once inside the ship, he'd never come back. He'd slam the airlock door and bolt it and then blast off as fast as he could get the motors going, Harding or no Harding. He got up.  \"We will help you,\" the interpreter said.  \"No. I can do it myself.\"  \"We will help you,\" the interpreter insisted firmly. His eyes bored into the Earthling, as though daring him to refuse again.  Sheckly's mouth felt dry once more. \"Where's Harding?\" he demanded. \"Where's the other Earth man? What have you done with him?\"  The interpreter looked at the leader, who nodded. The interpreter said gravely, \"It is too bad. It is the season for the shedding of skins. At the shedding feast last night--\"  \"The shedding of skins!\" Sheckly said, remembering the pile he'd seen at one corner of the village; \"those translucent things were your cast-off skins.\" He recalled that some reptiles back on Earth had regular seasons of shedding. That intelligent creatures should do it made him feel slightly sick.  \"Your friend joined us last night,\" the serpentman went on. \"But he could not shed properly, so--\"  Sheckly felt his blood turn to ice.  \"--so we helped him.\"  \"You _what_?\"  \"We helped him out of his skin,\" the serpentman went on calmly. \"We try to help those who are friends with us. Your friend had trouble getting his skin off, but with our help--\"  \"No!\" the Earthling cried, trying to reject the thought.  The full realization of what had happened struck him at once. Despite himself, he could picture Harding struggling, trying to convince these creatures that Earthlings don't shed their skins. His struggles must have convinced them only that he was having trouble shedding, so they \"helped him.\" They had come to skin the natives, but the reverse was happening--only literally.  \"Where--where is he?\" he asked finally, though he knew it didn't really matter.  \"We will take you to him,\" the interpreter said.  \"No,\" Sheckly cried. \"No, I--I'd rather not.\"  The serpentman nodded. \"As you wish. He does not look pretty. I hope that tonight you do not have as much trouble.\"  Sheckly's eyes went wide. \"What do you mean?\"  \"In your shedding,\" the serpentman explained. \"We will try to help you all we can, of course.\"  \"Of course,\" the Earthling agreed weakly, licking cottony lips. He wondered how he could just stand there so apparently calm, instead of letting out a shriek and running as fast as he could for the rocket ship. He decided it was some sort of paralysis, the shock of finding himself in the middle of something so alien his mind told him it couldn't possibly be.         *       *       *       *       *  Knees wobbling, Sheckly went to the door and out into the morning. That he had gotten that far surprised him pleasantly. The tall rocket ship was in a clearing several yards beyond the edge of the village. He headed for it. He thought of running, but his legs felt like rubber, his blood like ice. He walked past the pile of drying skins on the ground without looking at them, and he was followed by the interpreter and several others whom the serpentman had motioned to join them. Except for their swords, they had no weapons, he noticed. Poor Harding, he thought, and wondered if the Earthling's skin were somewhere in the pile; he felt sick, thinking about it.  \"You'd better stay outside the ship,\" he suggested testily. \"I'll lower the equipment to you.\"  \"I will go aboard with you,\" the serpentman said.  \"But--\"  \"I will go aboard with you.\"  Sheckly shrugged, but he hardly felt complacent. He felt as though a giant icy hand held onto his spine with a firm paralyzing grip. He trembled visibly. Got to think, he told himself desperately, got to plan this out. But fear jumbled his thoughts, and he could only think of Harding back in the village minus his skin, and of what was going to happen that night if all went as these creatures planned.  The second thought was the more terrifying, and when they were within a hundred feet of the rocket ship, Sheckly broke into a frantic run.  \"Stop,\" the interpreter cried.  Sheckly had no intentions of stopping. His glands told him to run, and he ran. He ran as fast as he could and didn't look back. He imagined the serpentman was on his heels, knife poised, and he ran even faster. He reached the rocket ship and went up the ladder, scrambling, missing his foothold, pulling himself up with clutching hands. He threw himself through the airlock and slammed the massive door behind him.  He ran through the metal corridors to the control room. They must be on the ladder, he thought, prying at the airlock with their metal swords. He pressed switches, slammed down on the throttle, and the sweet music of the rockets came and pressed him into his seat.  He looked down at the planet dwindling into space below him and he laughed hysterically, thinking of the narrow escape he'd had. No more planets for him, no more trying to skin anyone.         *       *       *       *       *  \"There it goes,\" the Space Patrolman said, watching the rocket rise.  Harding trembled with helpless rage. \"That blasted fool Sheckly'll lead you right to the money, too,\" he complained.  \"That's the way we planned it,\" the Patrolman smiled. \"I must compliment our native friends on their fine acting. Your pal took off like a scared rabbit.\"  \"Yeah,\" Harding grimaced, clenching his fists as though wishing he had someone's neck in them.  \"Don't blame your friend too much,\" the Patrolman advised. \"Whether you realize it or not, the fact that you were consciously avoiding our schedules caused you to follow a pattern in your visits to these outerspace planets; we just figured a bit ahead of you and posted hidden patrols on all the inhabited planets in this sector, knowing that sooner or later you'd land on one of them. We spotted your ship last night and hurried over by 'copter so we wouldn't be seen.\"  \"Forget the synopsis,\" Harding growled. \"You walked in when these blasted lizards were making believe they were going to skin me alive. They didn't have to act so realistic about it.\"  \"You're wrong about one thing,\" the Patrolman said. \"The act didn't start until after we arrived to direct it.\"  Harding looked at him, puzzled. \"What do you mean by that?\"  \"We arrived, as the books say, just in time,\" the Patrolman told him. \"They _weren't_ making believe.\" He offered a bowl of fruit to his prisoner. \"We'll be here for another hour yet. Eat something.\"  Weakly, Harding shook his head no. He sat down, suddenly pale at what the officer had said.  He didn't feel very hungry.                                                             ...

For many years I have wished that some able pen would place before the community at large the knowledge contained in the following pages. Some of this information has appeared from time to time in such books as \"Graham's Lectures on Chastity,\" \"Todd's Students' Manual,\" and a few popular works of a similar kind, which have been of immense service to the human race in preserving chastity and in reclaiming the unchaste. But all these are now inadequate to the growing demand for more light on these vital topics. It has been too much the custom for everyone, parents included, to shrink from instructing their own children, or those entrusted to their care, on these points; consequently, many young people _solely from their ignorance_ fall into the direst evils of a sexual nature and are thereby much injured and sometimes wholly ruined for life's important duties.  An experience of forty years in my professional career has afforded me thousands of opportunities for sympathizing with young men, and young women too, who had unconsciously sunk into these very evils merely for want of an able writer to place this whole subject truthfully and squarely before them, or for some wise friend to perform the same kind office verbally. The perusal of a work by Wm. Acton, M. R. C. S., of London, on \"The Functions and Disorders of the Reproductive Organs in Childhood, Youth, Adult Age, and Advanced Life,\" has, by his purity of sentiments, which have ever been identical with my own, both inspired and emboldened me to write a work of similar import. But his is for the profession while mine is for the profession and the laity, of both sexes and of any age. May its perusal inspire the readers with a higher appreciation of the matters herein treated, and with a greater effort to reformatory measures everywhere. Whenever I advise the consulting of a \"judicious\" (a term I use many times) physician, I mean one fully and practically qualified, both by inherent qualities and education, for the fullest confidence of his patients.  I am indebted to my son, Joseph C. Guernsey, M. D., for assistance in editing and carrying this work through the press.                                 Henry N.

In the creation of the world and all that therein is, we should consider it an axiom that \"Everything was created for use.\" All individual substances, or beings, that come to our notice bear certain relations to one another, have connection one with another, and are dependent upon and useful to each other; and nothing could possibly exist or subsist without this co-relation: connection with and use to each other. This is a law which needs only a little reflection to be accepted as a truth in every particular--in the greatest as well as in the least created form. This is more plainly seen in the animal kingdom than in the mineral or vegetable, because its members associate and finally become conjoined in pairs. Man and woman, who represent the crown and glory of all created beings, in whom are embodied all the lower orders, were and are still created to associate in pairs--each created for the other, the one to help the other; the two to love and to belong to one another. This principle, fully carried out, justifies and shows the necessity for the creation of man and woman precisely as they are, having bodies, parts and passions, will and understanding. It is my intention in the following pages to explain the relations existing between the sexes, for the purpose of showing that the greatest happiness to the human race will be found in living a life in full accord with these relations. In order that the subject may be fully understood, let us examine the physical development of man and woman in detail, particularizing the different organs of the body as they appear in their order of formation, from the very inmost or beginning, to the ultimate or end, in their respective natures.  Ever since the primal creation of man and woman, the human race has been perpetuated by a series of births. Children have been conceived in harmony with the natural order of events, in such matters, and have been born boys and girls. A boy is a boy to all intents and purposes from his very conception, from the very earliest moment of his being; begotten by his father he is a boy in embryo within the ovule of his mother. The converse is true of the opposite sex. At this very early age of reproduction the embryo has all the elements of the future man or woman, mentally and physically, even before any form becomes apparent; and so small is the human being at the earliest stage of its existence that no material change is observable between the ovule that contains the product of conception and a fully developed ovule unimpregnated.[A]    [A] For fuller particulars see Guernsey's Obstetrics, 3d edition,   pages 79-89, inclusive.  It is about twelve days after conception before the impregnated ovule, which undergoes many changes during this time, makes its escape from the ovary where it became impregnated and enters one of the Fallopian tubes, thence gradually descending into the cavity of the womb. Here it begins to mature and become fitted for its birth into the outer world. Soon now the embryo (for such it is called at this early stage) begins to assume form. The first indication of formation that it is possible to discover, even by the help of the microscope, consists of an oblong figure, obtuse at one extremity, swollen in the middle, blunt-pointed at the other extremity. The rudimentary embryo is slightly curved forward, is of a grayish white color, of a gelatinous consistence, from two to four lines long and weighs one or two grains. A slight depression representing the neck, enables us to distinguish the head; the body is marked by a swollen centre, but there are as yet no traces of the extremities. So much can be observed about the end of the third week after conception.  At about the _fifth week_ the embryo presents more distinctions. The head is very large in proportion to the rest of the body, the eyes are represented by two black spots, and the upper extremities by small protuberances on the sides of the trunk. The embryo at this stage is nearly two-thirds of an inch in length and weighs about fifteen grains. The lower extremities now begin to appear in the shape of two minute rounded tubercles. Till about this time a straight artery has been observed to beat with the regularity of the pulse; but now it appears doubled somewhat into the shape of an adult heart, although as yet it has but one auricle and one ventricle. As time advances we find the perfect heart with its two ventricles and two auricles, all developed from the original straight artery. At this period the lungs appear to exist in five or six different lobes and we can barely distinguish the bronchial tubes; about the same time the ears and face are distinctly outlined, and after awhile the nose is also faintly and imperfectly perceived.  At about the _seventh week_ a little bony deposit is found in the lower jaw. The kidneys now begin to be formed, and a little later the genital organs. The embryo averages one inch in length.  At _two months_ the rudiments of the extremities become more prominent. The forearm and hand can be"]]]
