In this stage--\"  Reinhart moved away. It was hard to believe only two days had passed since the mobilization order had been sent out. The whole system was alive, functioning with feverish activity. Countless problems were being solved--but much remained.  He entered the lift and ascended to the SRB room, curious to see if there had been any change in the machines' reading. He found it the same. So far so good. Did the Centaurans know about Icarus? No doubt; but there wasn't anything they could do about it. At least, not in eight days.  Kaplan came over to Reinhart, sorting a new batch of data that had come in. The lab organizer searched through his data. \"An amusing item came in. It might interest you.\" He handed a message plate to Reinhart.  It was from histo-research:                              May 9, 2136      This is to report that in bringing the research time bubble up     to the present the manual return was used for the first time.     Therefore a clean break was not made, and a quantity of     material from the past was brought forward. This material     included an individual from the early twentieth century who     escaped from the lab immediately. He has not yet been taken     into protective custody. Histo-research regrets this incident,     but attributes it to the emergency.                                                          E. Fredman  Reinhart handed the plate back to Kaplan. \"Interesting. A man from the past--hauled into the middle of the biggest war the universe has seen.\"  \"Strange things happen. I wonder what the machines will think.\"  \"Hard to say. Probably nothing.\" Reinhart left the room and hurried along the corridor to his own office.  As soon as he was inside he called Sherikov on the vidscreen, using the confidential line.  The Pole's heavy features appeared. \"Good day, Commissioner. How's the war effort?\"  \"Fine. How's the turret wiring proceeding?\"  A faint frown flickered across Sherikov's face. \"As a matter of fact, Commissioner--\"  \"What's the matter?\" Reinhart said sharply.  Sherikov floundered. \"You know how these things are. I've taken my crew off it and tried robot workers. They have greater dexterity, but they can't make decisions. This calls for more than mere dexterity. This calls for--\" He searched for the word. \"--for an _artist_.\"  Reinhart's face hardened. \"Listen, Sherikov. You have eight days left to complete the bomb. The data given to the SRB machines contained that information. The 7-6 ratio is based on that estimate. If you don't come through--\"  Sherikov twisted in embarrassment. \"Don't get excited, Commissioner. We'll complete it.\"  \"I hope so. Call me as soon as it's done.\" Reinhart snapped off the connection. If Sherikov let them down he'd have him taken out and shot. The whole war depended on the ftl bomb.  The vidscreen glowed again. Reinhart snapped it on. Kaplan's face formed on it. The lab organizer's face was pale and frozen. \"Commissioner, you better come up to the SRB office. Something's happened.\"  \"What is it?\"  \"I'll show you.\"  Alarmed, Reinhart hurried out of his office and down the corridor. He found Kaplan standing in front of the SRB machines. \"What's the story?\" Reinhart demanded. He glanced down at the reading. It was unchanged.  Kaplan held up a message plate nervously. \"A moment ago I fed this into the machines. After I saw the results I quickly removed it. It's that item I showed you. From histo-research. About the man from the past.\"  \"What happened when you fed it?\"  Kaplan swallowed unhappily. \"I'll show you. I'll do it again. Exactly as before.\" He fed the plate into a moving intake belt. \"Watch the visible figures,\" Kaplan muttered.  Reinhart watched, tense and rigid. For a moment nothing happened. 7-6 continued to show. Then--  The figures disappeared. The machines faltered. New figures showed briefly. 4-24 for Centaurus. Reinhart gasped, suddenly sick with apprehension. But the figures vanished. New figures appeared. 16-38 for Centaurus. Then 48-86. 79-15 in Terra's favor. Then nothing. The machines whirred, but nothing happened.  Nothing at all. No figures. Only a blank.  \"What's it mean?\" Reinhart muttered, dazed.  \"It's fantastic. We didn't think this could--\"  \"_What's happened?_\"  \"The machines aren't able to handle the item. No reading can come. It's data they can't integrate. They can't use it for prediction material, and it throws off all their other figures.\"  \"Why?\"  \"It's--it's a variable.\" Kaplan was shaking, white-lipped and pale. \"Something from which no inference can be made. The man from the past. The machines can't deal with him. The variable man!\"     II   Thomas Cole was sharpening a knife with his whetstone when the tornado hit.  The knife belonged to the lady in the big green house. Every time Cole came by with his Fixit cart the lady had something to be sharpened. Once in awhile she gave him a cup of coffee, hot black coffee from an old bent pot. He liked that fine; he enjoyed good coffee.  The day was drizzly and overcast. Business had been bad. An automobile had scared his two horses. On bad days less people were outside and he had to get down from the cart and go to ring doorbells.  But the man in the yellow house had given him a dollar for fixing his electric refrigerator. Nobody else had been able to fix it, not even the factory man. The dollar would go a long way. A dollar was a lot.  He knew it was a tornado even before it hit him. Everything was silent. He was bent over his whetstone, the reins between his knees, absorbed in his work.  He had done a good job on the knife; he was almost finished. He spat on the blade and was holding it up to see--and then the tornado came.  All at once it was there, completely around him. Nothing but grayness. He and the cart and horses seemed to be in a calm spot in the center of the tornado. They were moving in a great silence, gray mist everywhere.  And while he was wondering what to do, and how to get the lady's knife back to her, all at once there was a bump and the tornado tipped him over, sprawled out on the ground. The horses screamed in fear, struggling to pick themselves up. Cole got quickly to his feet.  _Where was he?_  The grayness was gone. White walls stuck up on all sides. A deep light gleamed down, not daylight but something like it. The team was pulling the cart on its side, dragging it along, tools and equipment falling out. Cole righted the cart, leaping up onto the seat.  And for the first time saw the people.  Men, with astonished white faces, in some sort of uniforms. Shouts, noise and confusion. And a feeling of danger!  Cole headed the team toward the door. Hoofs thundered steel against steel as they pounded through the doorway, scattering the astonished men in all directions. He was out in a wide hall. A building, like a hospital.  The hall divided. More men were coming, spilling from all sides.  Shouting and milling in excitement, like white ants. Something cut past him, a beam of dark violet. It seared off a corner of the cart, leaving the wood smoking.  Cole felt fear. He kicked at the terrified horses. They reached a big door, crashing wildly against it. The door gave--and they were outside, bright sunlight blinking down on them. For a sickening second the cart tilted, almost turning over. Then the horses gained speed, racing across an open field, toward a distant line of green, Cole holding tightly to the reins.  Behind him the little white-faced men had come out and were standing in a group, gesturing frantically. He could hear their faint shrill shouts.  But he had got away. He was safe. He slowed the horses down and began to breathe again.  The woods were artificial. Some kind of park. But the park was wild and overgrown. A dense jungle of twisted plants. Everything growing in confusion.  The park was empty. No one was there. By the position of the sun he could tell it was either early morning or late afternoon. The smell of the flowers and grass, the dampness of the leaves, indicated morning. It had been late afternoon when the tornado had picked him up. And the sky had been overcast and cloudy.  Cole considered. Clearly, he had been carried a long way. The hospital, the men with white faces, the odd lighting, the accented words he had caught--everything indicated he was no longer in Nebraska--maybe not even in the United States.  Some of his tools had fallen out and gotten lost along the way. Cole collected everything that remained, sorting them, running his fingers over each tool with affection. Some of the little chisels and wood gouges were gone. The bit box had opened, and most of the smaller bits had been lost. He gathered up those that remained and replaced them tenderly in the box. He took a key-hole saw down, and with an oil rag wiped it carefully and replaced it.  Above the cart the sun rose slowly in the sky. Cole peered up, his horny hand over his eyes. A big man, stoop-shouldered, his chin gray and stubbled. His clothes wrinkled and dirty. But his eyes were clear, a pale blue, and his hands were finely made.  He could not stay in the park. They had seen him ride that way; they would be looking for him.  Far above something shot rapidly across the sky. A tiny black dot moving with incredible haste. A second dot followed. The two dots were gone almost before he saw them. They were utterly silent.  Cole frowned, perturbed. The dots made him uneasy. He would have to keep moving--and looking for food. His stomach was already beginning to rumble and groan.  Work. There was plenty he could do: gardening, sharpening, grinding, repair work on machines and clocks, fixing all kinds of household things. Even painting and odd jobs and carpentry and chores.  He could do anything. Anything people wanted done. For a meal and pocket money.  Thomas Cole urged the team into life, moving forward. He sat hunched over in the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32154"],["title","The Variable Man (#3)"],["body",", watching intently, as the Fixit cart rolled slowly across the tangled grass, through the jungle of trees and flowers.         *       *       *       *       *  Reinhart hurried, racing his cruiser at top speed, followed by a second ship, a military escort. The ground sped by below him, a blur of gray and green.  The remains of New York lay spread out, a twisted, blunted ruin overgrown with weeds and grass. The great atomic wars of the twentieth century had turned virtually the whole seaboard area into an endless waste of slag.  Slag and weeds below him. And then the sudden tangle that had been Central Park.  Histo-research came into sight. Reinhart swooped down, bringing his cruiser to rest at the small supply field behind the main buildings.  Harper, the chief official of the department, came quickly over as soon as Reinhart's ship landed.  \"Frankly, we don't understand why you consider this matter important,\" Harper said uneasily.  Reinhart shot him a cold glance. \"I'll be the judge of what's important. Are you the one who gave the order to bring the bubble back manually?\"  \"Fredman gave the actual order. In line with your directive to have all facilities ready for--\"  Reinhart headed toward the entrance of the research building. \"Where is Fredman?\"  \"Inside.\"  \"I want to see him. Let's go.\"  Fredman met them inside. He greeted Reinhart calmly, showing no emotion. \"Sorry to cause you trouble, Commissioner. We were trying to get the station in order for the war. We wanted the bubble back as quickly as possible.\" He eyed Reinhart curiously. \"No doubt the man and his cart will soon be picked up by your police.\"  \"I want to know everything that happened, in exact detail.\"  Fredman shifted uncomfortably. \"There's not much to tell. I gave the order to have the automatic setting canceled and the bubble brought back manually. At the moment the signal reached it, the bubble was passing through the spring of 1913. As it broke loose, it tore off a piece of ground on which this person and his cart were located. The person naturally was brought up to the present, inside the bubble.\"  \"Didn't any of your instruments tell you the bubble was loaded?\"  \"We were too excited to take any readings. Half an hour after the manual control was thrown, the bubble materialized in the observation room. It was de-energized before anyone noticed what was inside. We tried to stop him but he drove the cart out into the hall, bowling us out of the way. The horses were in a panic.\"  \"What kind of cart was it?\"  \"There was some kind of sign on it. Painted in black letters on both sides. No one saw what it was.\"  \"Go ahead. What happened then?\"  \"Somebody fired a Slem-ray after him, but it missed. The horses carried him out of the building and onto the grounds. By the time we reached the exit the cart was half way to the park.\"  Reinhart reflected. \"If he's still in the park we should have him shortly. But we must be careful.\" He was already starting back toward his ship, leaving Fredman behind. Harper fell in beside him.  Reinhart halted by his ship. He beckoned some Government guards over. \"Put the executive staff of this department under arrest. I'll have them tried on a treason count, later on.\" He smiled ironically as Harper's face blanched sickly pale. \"There's a war going on. You'll be lucky if you get off alive.\"  Reinhart entered his ship and left the surface, rising rapidly into the sky. A second ship followed after him, a military escort. Reinhart flew high above the sea of gray slag, the unrecovered waste area. He passed over a sudden square of green set in the ocean of gray. Reinhart gazed back at it until it was gone.  Central Park. He could see police ships racing through the sky, ships and transports loaded with troops, heading toward the square of green. On the ground some heavy guns and surface cars rumbled along, lines of black approaching the park from all sides.  They would have the man soon. But meanwhile, the SRB machines were blank. And on the SRB machines' readings the whole war depended.  About noon the cart reached the edge of the park. Cole rested for a moment, allowing the horses time to crop at the thick grass. The silent expanse of slag amazed him. What had happened? Nothing stirred. No buildings, no sign of life. Grass and weeds poked up occasionally through it, breaking the flat surface here and there, but even so, the sight gave him an uneasy chill.  Cole drove the cart slowly out onto the slag, studying the sky above him. There was nothing to hide him, now that he was out of the park. The slag was bare and uniform, like the ocean. If he were spotted--  A horde of tiny black dots raced across the sky, coming rapidly closer. Presently they veered to the right and disappeared. More planes, wingless metal planes. He watched them go, driving slowly on.  Half an hour later something appeared ahead. Cole slowed the cart down, peering to see. The slag came to an end. He had reached its limits. Ground appeared, dark soil and grass. Weeds grew everywhere. Ahead of him, beyond the end of the slag, was a line of buildings, houses of some sort. Or sheds.  Houses, probably. But not like any he had ever seen.  The houses were uniform, all exactly the same. Like little green shells, rows of them, several hundred. There was a little lawn in front of each. Lawn, a path, a front porch, bushes in a meager row around each house. But the houses were all alike and very small.  Little green shells in precise, even rows. He urged the cart cautiously forward, toward the houses.  No one seemed to be around. He entered a street between two rows of houses, the hoofs of his two horses sounding loudly in the silence. He was in some kind of town. But there were no dogs or children. Everything was neat and silent. Like a model. An exhibit. It made him uncomfortable.  A young man walking along the pavement gaped at him in wonder. An oddly-dressed youth, in a toga-like cloak that hung down to his knees. A single piece of fabric. And sandals.  Or what looked like sandals. Both the cloak and the sandals were of some strange half-luminous material. It glowed faintly in the sunlight. Metallic, rather than cloth.  A woman was watering flowers at the edge of a lawn. She straightened up as his team of horses came near. Her eyes widened in astonishment--and then fear. Her mouth fell open in a soundless _O_ and her sprinkling can slipped from her fingers and rolled silently onto the lawn.  Cole blushed and turned his head quickly away. The woman was scarcely dressed! He flicked the reins and urged the horses to hurry.  Behind him, the woman still stood. He stole a brief, hasty look back--and then shouted hoarsely to his team, ears scarlet. He had seen right. She wore only a pair of translucent shorts. Nothing else. A mere fragment of the same half-luminous material that glowed and sparkled. The rest of her small body was utterly naked.  He slowed the team down. She had been pretty. Brown hair and eyes, deep red lips. Quite a good figure. Slender waist, downy legs, bare and supple, full breasts--. He clamped the thought furiously off. He had to get to work. Business.  Cole halted the Fixit cart and leaped down onto the pavement. He selected a house at random and approached it cautiously. The house was attractive. It had a certain simple beauty. But it looked frail--and exactly like the others.  He stepped up on the porch. There was no bell. He searched for it, running his hand uneasily over the surface of the door. All at once there was a click, a sharp snap on a level with his eyes. Cole glanced up, startled. A lens was vanishing as the door section slid over it. He had been photographed.  While he was wondering what it meant, the door swung suddenly open. A man filled up the entrance, a big man in a tan uniform, blocking the way ominously.  \"What do you want?\" the man demanded.  \"I'm looking for work,\" Cole murmured. \"Any kind of work. I can do anything, fix any kind of thing. I repair broken objects. Things that need mending.\" His voice trailed off uncertainly. \"Anything at all.\"  \"Apply to the Placement Department of the Federal Activities Control Board,\" the man said crisply. \"You know all occupational therapy is handled through them.\" He eyed Cole curiously. \"Why have you got on those ancient clothes?\"  \"Ancient? Why, I--\"  The man gazed past him at the Fixit cart and the two dozing horses. \"What's that? What are those two animals? _Horses?_\" The man rubbed his jaw, studying Cole intently. \"That's strange,\" he said.  \"Strange?\" Cole murmured uneasily. \"Why?\"  \"There haven't been any horses for over a century. All the horses were wiped out during the Fifth Atomic War. That's why it's strange.\"  Cole tensed, suddenly alert. There was something in the man's eyes, a hardness, a piercing look. Cole moved back off the porch, onto the path. He had to be careful. Something was wrong.  \"I'll be going,\" he murmured.  \"There haven't been any horses for over a hundred years.\" The man came toward Cole. \"Who are you? Why are you dressed up like that? Where did you get that vehicle and pair of horses?\"  \"I'll be going,\" Cole repeated, moving away.  The man whipped something from his belt, a thin metal tube. He stuck it toward Cole.  It was a rolled-up paper, a thin sheet of metal in the form of a tube. Words, some kind of script. He could not make any of them out. The man's picture, rows of numbers, figures--  \"I'm Director Winslow,\" the man said. \"Federal Stockpile Conservation. You better talk fast, or there'll be a Security car here in five minutes.\"  Cole moved--fast. He raced, head down, back along the path to the cart, toward the street.  Something hit him. A wall of force, throwing him down on his face. He sprawled in a heap, numb and dazed. His body ached, vibrating wildly, out of control. Waves of shock rolled over him, gradually diminishing.  He got shakily to his feet. His head spun. He was weak, shattered, trembling violently. The man was coming "]]]
