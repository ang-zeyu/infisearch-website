That is, if she was a good cow.\"  \"You just don't understand,\" Harkaway said. \"Not that you could be expected to.\"  \"He's a clod,\" the radio operator agreed. \"Forgive me, sir,\" he apologized as Iversen turned to glare incredulously at him, \"but, according to _mpoola_, candor is a Step Upward.\"  \"Onward and Upward,\" Harkaway commented, and Iversen was almost sure that, had he not been there, the men would have bowed their heads in contemplation, if not actual prayer.         *       *       *       *       *  As time went on, the greech thrived and grew remarkably stout on the Earth viands, which it consumed in almost improbable quantities. Then, one day, it disappeared and its happy squeal was heard no longer.  There was much mourning aboard the _Herringbone_--for, with its lovable personality and innocently engaging ways, the little fellow had won its way into the hearts of all the spacemen--until the first officer discovered a substantial pink cocoon resting on the ship's control board and rushed to the intercom to spread the glad tidings. That was a breach of regulations, of course, but Iversen knew when not to crowd his fragile authority.  \"I should have known there was some material basis for the spiritual doctrine of _mpoola_,\" Harkaway declared with tears in his eyes as he regarded the dormant form of his little pet. \"Was it not the transformation of the caterpillar into the butterfly that first showed us on Earth how the soul might emerge winged and beautiful from its vile house of clay? Gentlemen,\" he said, in a voice choked with emotion, \"our little greech is about to become a zkoort. Praised be the Impersonal Being who has allowed such a miracle to take place before our very eyes. _J'goona lo mpoona_.\"  \"Amen,\" said the first officer reverently.  All those in the control room bowed their heads except Iversen. And even he didn't quite have the nerve to tell them that the cocoon was pushing the _Herringbone_ two points off course.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Take that thing away before I lose my temper and clobber it,\" Iversen said impatiently as the zkoort dived low to buzz him, then whizzed just out of its reach on its huge, brilliant wings, giggling raucously.  [Illustration]  \"He was just having his bit of fun,\" the first officer said with reproach. \"Have you no tolerance, Captain, no appreciation of the joys of golden youth?\"  \"A spaceship is no place for a butterfly,\" Iversen said, \"especially a four-foot butterfly.\"  \"How can you say that?\" Harkaway retorted. \"The _Herringbone_ is the only spaceship that ever had one, to my knowledge. And I think I can safely say our lives are all a bit brighter and better and _m'poo'p_ for having a zkoort among us. Thanks be to the Divine Nonentity for--\"  \"Poor little butterfly,\" Dr. Smullyan declared sonorously, \"living out his brief life span so far from the fresh air, the sunshine, the pretty flowers--\"  \"Oh, I don't know that it's as bad as all that,\" the first officer said. \"He hangs around hydroponics a lot and he gets a daily ration of vitamins.\" Then he paled. \"But that's right--a butterfly does live only a day, doesn't it?\"  \"It's different with a zkoort,\" Harkaway maintained stoutly, though he also, Iversen noted, lost his ruddy color. \"After all, he isn't really a butterfly, merely an analogous life-form.\"  \"My, my! In four weeks, you've mastered their entomology as well as their theology and language,\" Iversen jeered. \"Is there no end to your accomplishments, Lieutenant?\"  Harkaway's color came back twofold. \"He's already been around half a _thubb_,\" he pointed out. \"Over two weeks.\"  \"Well, the thing _is_ bigger than a Terrestrial butterfly,\" Iversen conceded, \"so you have to make some allowances for size. On the other hand--\"  Laughing madly, the zkoort swooped down on him. Iversen beat it away with a snarl.  \"Playful little fellow, isn't he?\" the first officer said, with thoroughly annoying fondness.  \"He likes you, Skipper,\" Harkaway explained. \"_Urg'h n gurg'h_--or, to give it the crude Terran equivalent, living is loving. He can tell that beneath that grizzled and seemingly harsh exterior of yours, Captain--\"  But, with a scream of rage, Iversen had locked himself into his cabin. Outside, he could hear the zkoort beating its wings against the door and wailing disappointedly.         *       *       *       *       *  Some days later, a pair of rapidly dulling wings were found on the floor of the hydroponics chamber. But of the zkoort's little body, there was no sign. An air of gloom and despondency hung over the _Herringbone_ and even Iversen felt a pang, though he would never admit it without brainwashing.  During the next week, the men, seeking to forget their loss, plunged themselves into _mpoola_ with real fanaticism. Harkaway took to wearing some sort of ecclesiastical robes which he whipped up out of the recreation room curtains. Iversen had neither the heart nor the courage to stop him, though this, too, was against regulations. Everyone except Iversen gave up eating fish and eggs in addition to meat.  Then, suddenly, one day a roly-poly blue animal appeared at the officers mess, claiming everyone as an old friend with loud squeals of joy. This time, Iversen was the only one who was glad to see him--really glad.  \"Aren't you happy to see your little friend again, Harkaway?\" he asked, scratching the delighted animal between the ears.  \"Why, sure,\" Harkaway said, putting his fork down and leaving his vegetable _mac√©doine_ virtually untasted. \"Sure. I'm very happy--\" his voice broke--\"very happy.\"  \"Of course, it does kind of knock your theory of the transmigration of souls into a cocked hat,\" the captain grinned. \"Because, in order for the soul to transmigrate, the previous body's got to be dead, and I'm afraid our little pal here was alive all the time.\"  \"Looks it, doesn't it?\" muttered Harkaway.  \"I rather think,\" Iversen went on, tickling the creature under the chin until it squealed happily, \"that you didn't _quite_ get the nuances of the language, did you, Harkaway? Because I gather now that the whole difficulty was a semantic one. The Flimbotzik were explaining the zoology of the native life-forms to you and you misunderstood it as their theology.\"  \"Looks it, doesn't it?\" Harkaway repeated glumly. \"It certainly looks it.\"  \"Cheer up,\" Iversen said, reaching over to slap the young man on the back--a bit to his own amazement. \"No real harm done. What if the Flimbotzik are less primitive than you fancied? It makes our discovery the more worthwhile, doesn't it?\"  At this point, the radio operator almost sobbingly asked to be excused from the table. Following his departure, there was a long silence. It was hard, Iversen realized in a burst of uncharacteristic tolerance, to have one's belief, even so newly born a credo, annihilated with such suddenness.  \"After all, you did run across the Flimbotzik first,\" he told Harkaway as he spread gooseberry jam on a hard roll for the ravenous ex-zkoort (now a chu-wugg, he had been told). \"That's the main thing, and a life-form that passes through two such striking metamorphoses is not unfraught with interest. You shall receive full credit, my boy, and your little mistake doesn't mean a thing except--\"  \"Doom,\" said Dr. Smullyan, sopping up the last of his gravy with a piece of bread. \"Doom, doom, doom.\" He stuffed the bread into his mouth.  \"Look, Smullyan,\" Iversen told him jovially, \"you better watch out. If you keep talking that way, next voyage out we'll sign on a parrot instead of a medical officer. Cheaper and just as efficient.\"  Only the chu-wugg joined in his laughter.  \"Ever since I can remember,\" the first officer said, looking gloomily at the doctor, \"he's never been wrong. Maybe _he_ has powers beyond our comprehension. Perhaps we sought at the end of the Galaxy what was in our own back yard all the time.\"  \"Who was seeking what?\" Iversen asked as all the officers looked at Smullyan with respectful awe. \"I demand an answer!\"  But the only one who spoke was the doctor. \"Only Man is vile,\" he said, as if to himself, and fell asleep with his head on the table.  \"Make a cult out of Smullyan,\" Iversen warned the others, \"and I'll scuttle the ship!\"  Later on, the first officer got the captain alone. \"Look here, sir,\" he began tensely, \"have you read Harkaway's book about _mpoola_?\"  \"I read part of the first chapter,\" Iversen told him, \"and that was enough. Maybe to Harkaway it's eschatology, but to me it's just plain scatology!\"  \"But--\"  \"Why in Zubeneschamali,\" Iversen said patiently, \"should I waste my time reading a book devoted to a theory which has already been proved erroneous? Answer me that!\"  \"I think you should have a look at the whole thing,\" the first officer persisted.  \"Baham!\" Iversen replied, but amiably enough, for he was in rare good humor these days. And he needed good humor to tolerate the way his officers and men were behaving. All right, they had made idiots of themselves; that was understandable, expected, familiar. But it wasn't the chu-wugg's fault. Iversen had never seen such a bunch of soreheads. Why did they have to take their embarrassment and humiliation out on an innocent little animal?  For, although no one actually mistreated the chu-wugg, the men avoided him as much as possible. Often Iversen would come upon the little fellow weeping from loneliness in a corner with no one to play with and, giving in to his own human weakness, the captain would dry the creature's tears and comfort him. In return, the chu-wugg would laugh at all his jokes, for he seemed to have acquired an elementary knowledge of Terran.         *       *       *       *       *  \"By Vindemiatrix, Lieutenant,\" the captain roared as Harkaway, foiled in his attempt to scurry off unobserved, stood quivering before him, \"why have you been avoiding me like this?\"  \"I didn't think I was avoiding you any particular way, sir,\" Harkaway said. \"I mean does it appear"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31664"],["title","Once a Greech (#4)"],["body","that, sir? It's only that I've been busy with my duties, sir.\"  \"I don't know what's the matter with you! I told you I handsomely forgave you for your mistake.\"  \"But I can never forgive myself, sir--\"  \"Are you trying to go over my head?\" Iversen thundered.  \"No, sir. I--\"  \"If I am willing to forgive you, you will forgive yourself. That's an order!\"  \"Yes, sir,\" the young man said feebly.  Harkaway had changed back to his uniform, Iversen noted, but he looked unkempt, ill, harrowed. The boy had really been suffering for his precipitance. Perhaps the captain himself had been a little hard on him.  Iversen modulated his tone to active friendliness. \"Thought you might like to know the chu-wugg turned into a hoop-snake this morning!\"  But Harkaway did not seem cheered by this social note. \"So soon!\"  \"You knew there would be a fourth metamorphosis!\" Iversen was disappointed. But he realized that Harkaway was bound to have acquired such fundamental data, no matter how he interpreted them. It was possible, Iversen thought, that the book could actually have some value, if there were some way of weeding fact from fancy, and surely there must be scholars trained in such an art, for Earth had many wholly indigenous texts of like nature.  \"He's a thor'glitch now,\" Harkaway told him dully.  \"And what comes next?... No, don't tell me. It's more fun not knowing beforehand. You know,\" Iversen went on, almost rubbing his hands together, \"I think this species is going to excite more interest on Earth than the Flimbotzik themselves. After all, people are people, even if they're green, but an animal that changes shape so many times and so radically is really going to set biologists by the ears. What did you say the name of the species as a whole was?\"  \"I--I couldn't say, sir.\"  \"Ah,\" Iversen remarked waggishly, \"so there are one or two things you don't know about Flimbot, eh?\"  Harkaway opened his mouth, but only a faint bleating sound came out.         *       *       *       *       *  As the days went on, Iversen found himself growing fonder and fonder of the thor'glitch. Finally, in spite of the fact that it had now attained the dimensions of a well-developed boa constrictor, he took it to live in his quarters.  Many was the quiet evening they spent together, Iversen entering acid comments upon the crew in the ship's log, while the thor'glitch looked over viewtapes from the ship's library.  The captain was surprised to find how much he--well, enjoyed this domestic tranquility. I must be growing old, he thought--old and mellow. And he named the creature Bridey, after a twentieth-century figure who had, he believed, been connected with another metempsychotic furor.  When the thor'glitch grew listless and began to swell in the middle, Iversen got alarmed and sent for Dr. Smullyan.  \"Aha!\" the medical officer declaimed, with a casual glance at the suffering snake. \"The day of reckoning is at hand! Reap the fruit of your transgression, scurvy humans! Calamity approaches with jets aflame!\"  Iversen clutched the doctor's sleeve. \"Is he--is he going to die?\"  \"Unhand me, presumptuous navigator!\" Dr. Smullyan shook the captain's fingers off his arm. \"I didn't say he was going to die,\" he offered in ordinary bedside tones. \"Not being a specialist in this particular sector, I am not qualified to offer an opinion, but, strictly off the record, I would hazard the guess that he's about to metamorphose again.\"  \"He never did it in public before,\" Iversen said worriedly.  \"The old order changeth,\" Smullyan told him. \"You'd better call Harkaway.\"  \"What does _he_ know!\"  \"Too little and, at the same time, too much,\" the doctor declaimed, dissociating himself professionally from the case. \"Too much and too little. Eat, drink, be merry, iniquitous Earthmen, for you died yesterday!\"  \"Oh, shut up,\" Iversen said automatically, and dispatched a message to Harkaway with the information that the thor'glitch appeared to be metamorphosing again and that his presence was requested in the captain's cabin.  [Illustration]  The rest of the officers accompanied Harkaway, all of them with the air of attending a funeral rather than a rebirth, Iversen noted nervously. They weren't armed, though, so Bridey couldn't be turning into anything dangerous.         *       *       *       *       *  Now it came to pass that the thor'glitch's mid-section, having swelled to unbearable proportions, began to quiver. Suddenly, the skin split lengthwise and dropped cleanly to either side, like a banana peel.  Iversen pressed forward to see what fresh life-form the bulging cavity had held. The other officers all stood in a somber row without moving, for all along, Iversen realized, they had known what to expect, what was to come. And they had not told him. But then, he knew, it was his own fault; he had refused to be told.  Now, looking down at the new life-form, he saw for himself what it was. Lying languidly in the thor'glitch skin was a slender youth of a pallor which seemed excessive even for a member of a green-skinned race. He had large limpid eyes and a smile of ineffable sweetness.  \"By Nopus Secundus,\" Iversen groaned. \"I'm sunk.\"  \"Naturally the ultimate incarnation for a life-form would be humanoid,\" Harkaway said with deep reproach. \"What else?\"  \"I'm surprised you didn't figure that out for yourself, sir,\" the first officer added. \"Even if you did refuse to read Harkaway's book, it seems obvious.\"  \"Does it?\" Smullyan challenged. \"Does it, indeed? Is Man the highest form of life in an irrational cosmos? Then all causes are lost ones!... So many worlds,\" he muttered in more subdued tones, \"so much to do, so little done, such things to be!\"  \"The Flimbotzik were telling Harkaway about their _own_ life cycle,\" Iversen whispered as revelation bathed him in its murky light. \"The human embryo undergoes a series of changes _inside_ the womb. It's just that the Flimbotzik fetus develops _outside_ the womb.\"  \"Handily bypassing the earliest and most unpleasant stages of humanity,\" Smullyan sighed. \"Oh, idyllic planet, where one need never be a child--where one need never see a child!\"  \"Then they were trying to explain their biology to you quite clearly and coherently, you lunkhead,\" Iversen roared at Harkaway, \"and you took it for a religious doctrine!\"  \"Yes, sir,\" Harkaway said weakly. \"I--I kind of figured that out myself in these last few weeks of intensive soul-searching. I--I'm sorry, sir. All I can say is that it was an honest mistake.\"  \"Why, they weren't necessarily pet-lovers at all. Those animals they had with them were.... By Nair al Zaurak!\" The captain's voice rose to a shriek as the whole enormity of the situation finally dawned upon him. \"You went and kidnaped one of the children!\"  \"That's a serious charge, kidnaping,\" the first officer said with melancholy pleasure. \"And you, as head of this expedition, Captain, are responsible. Ironic, isn't it?\"  \"Told you all this spelled doom and disaster,\" the doctor observed cheerfully.  Just then, the young humanoid sat up--with considerable effort, Iversen was disturbed to notice. But perhaps that was one of the consequences of being born. A new-born infant was weak; why not a new-born adult, then?  \"Why doom?\" the humanoid asked in a high, clear voice. \"Why disaster?\"  \"You--you speak Terran?\" the captain stammered.  Bridey gave his sad, sweet smile. \"I was reared amongst you. You are my people. Why should I not speak your tongue?\"  \"But we're not your people,\" Iversen blurted, thinking perhaps the youth did not remember back to his greechi days. \"We're an entirely different species--\"  \"Our souls vibrate in unison and that is the vital essence. But do not be afraid, shipmates; the Flimbotzik do not regard the abduction of a transitory corporeal shelter as a matter of any great moment. Moreover, what took place could not rightly be termed abduction, for I came with you of my own volition--and the Flimbotzik recognize individual responsibility from the very first moment of the psyche's drawing breath in any material casing.\"  Bridey talked so much like Harkaway's book that Iversen was almost relieved when, a few hours later, the alien died. Of course the captain was worried about possible repercussions from the governments of both Terra and Flimbot, in spite of Bridey's assurances.  And he could not help but feel a pang when the young humanoid expired in his arms, murmuring, \"Do not grieve for me, soul-mates. In the midst of life, there is life....\"  \"Funny,\" Smullyan said, with one of his disconcerting returns to a professional manner, \"all the other forms seemed perfectly healthy. Why did this one go like that? Almost as if he _wanted_ to die.\"  \"He was too good for this ship, that's what,\" the radio operator said, glaring at the captain. \"Too fine and brave and--and noble.\"  \"Yes,\" Harkaway agreed. \"What truly sensitive soul could exist in a stultifying atmosphere like this?\"  All the officers glared at the captain. He glared back with right good will. \"How come you gentlemen are still with us?\" he inquired. \"One would have thought you would have perished of pure sensibility long since, then.\"  \"It's not nice to talk that way,\" the chief petty officer burst out, \"not with him lying there not yet cold.... Ah,\" he heaved a long sigh, \"we'll never see his like again.\"  \"Ay, that we won't,\" agreed the crew, huddled in the corridor outside the captain's cabin.  Iversen sincerely hoped not, but he forbore to speak.         *       *       *       *       *  Since Bridey had reached the ultimate point in his life cycle, it seemed certain that he was not going to change into anything else and so he was given a spaceman's burial. Feeling like a put-upon fool, Captain Iversen read a short prayer as Bridey's slight body was consigned to the vast emptiness of space.  Then the airlock clanged shut behind the last mortal remains of the ill-fated extraterrestrial and that was the end of it.  But the funereal"]]]
