O, we went to twenty places that night, I suppose! We went to the grandest places in Boston, and we went to the meanest. Everywhere they wished us a merry Christmas, and we them. Everywhere a little crowd gathered round us, and then we dashed away far enough to gather quite another crowd; and then back, perhaps, not sorry to double on our steps if need were, and leaving every crowd with a happy thought of      \"The star, the manger, and the Child!\"  At nine we brought up at my house, D Street, three doors from the corner, and the children picked their very best for Polly and my six little girls to hear, and then for the first time we let them jump out and run in. Polly had some hot oysters for them, so that the frolic was crowned with a treat. There was a Christmas cake cut into sixteen pieces, which they took home to dream upon; and then hoods and muffs on again, and by ten o'clock, or a little after, we had all the girls and all the little ones at their homes. Four of the big boys, our two flankers and Harry's right and left hand men, begged that they might stay till the last moment. They could walk back from the stable, and \"rather walk than not, indeed.\" To which we assented, having gained parental permission, as we left younger sisters in their respective homes.   II.  Lycidas and I both thought, as we went into these modest houses, to leave the children, to say they had been good and to wish a \"Merry Christmas\" ourselves to fathers, mothers, and to guardian aunts, that the welcome of those homes was perhaps the best part of it all. Here was the great stout sailor-boy whom we had not seen since he came back from sea. He was a mere child when he left our school years on years ago, for the East, on board Perry's vessel, and had been round the world. Here was brave Mrs. Masury. I had not seen her since her mother died. \"Indeed, Mr. Ingham, I got so used to watching then, that I cannot sleep well yet o' nights; I wish you knew some poor creature that wanted me to-night, if it were only in memory of Bethlehem.\" \"You take a deal of trouble for the children,\" said Campbell, as he crushed my hand in his; \"but you know they love you, and you know I would do as much for you and yours,\"--which I knew was true. \"What can I send to your children?\" said Dalton, who was finishing sword-blades. (Ill wind was Fort Sumter, but it blew good to poor Dalton, whom it set up in the world with his sword-factory.) \"Here's an old-fashioned tape-measure for the girl, and a Sheffield wimble for the boy. What, there is no boy? Let one of the girls have it then; it will count one more present for her.\" And so he pressed his brown-paper parcel into my hand. From every house, though it were the humblest, a word of love, as sweet, in truth, as if we could have heard the voice of angels singing in the sky.  I bade Harry good-night; took Lycidas to his lodgings, and gave his wife my Christmas wishes and good-night; and, coming down to the sleigh again, gave way to the feeling which I think you will all understand, that this was not the time to stop, but just the time to begin. For the streets were stiller now, and the moon brighter than ever, if possible, and the blessings of these simple people and of the grand people, and of the very angels in heaven, who are not bound to the misery of using words when they have anything worth saying,--all these wishes and blessings were round me, all the purity of the still winter night, and I didn't want to lose it all by going to bed to sleep. So I put the boys all together, where they could chatter, took one more brisk turn on the two avenues, and then, passing through Charles Street, I believe I was even thinking of Cambridge, I noticed the lights in Woodhull's house, and, seeing they were up, thought I would make Fanny a midnight call. She came to the door herself. I asked if she were waiting for Santa Claus, but saw in a moment that I must not joke with her. She said she had hoped I was her husband. In a minute was one of these contrasts which make life, life. God puts us into the world that we may try them and be tried by them. Poor Fanny's mother had been blocked up on the Springfield train as she was coming on to Christmas. The old lady had been chilled through, and was here in bed now with pneumonia. Both Fanny's children had been ailing when she came, and this morning the doctor had pronounced it scarlet fever. Fanny had not undressed herself since Monday, nor slept, I thought, in the same time. So while we had been singing carols and wishing merry Christmas, the poor child had been waiting, and hoping that her husband or Edward, both of whom were on the tramp, would find for her and bring to her the model nurse, who had not yet appeared. But at midnight this unknown sister had not arrived, nor had either of the men returned. When I rang, Fanny had hoped I was one of them. Professional paragons, dear reader, are shy of scarlet fever. I told the poor child that it was better as it was. I wrote a line for Sam Perry to take to his aunt, Mrs. Masury, in which I simply said: \"Dear mamma, I have found the poor creature who wants you to-night. Come back in this carriage.\" I bade him take a hack at Barnard's, where they were all up waiting for the assembly to be done at Papanti's. I sent him over to Albany Street; and really as I sat there trying to soothe Fanny, it seemed to me less time than it has taken me to dictate this little story about her, before Mrs. Masury rang gently, and I left them, having made Fanny promise that she would consecrate the day, which at that moment was born, by trusting God, by going to bed and going to sleep, knowing that her children were in much better hands than hers. As I passed out of the hall, the gas-light fell on a print of Correggio's Adoration, where Woodhull had himself written years before,      \"Ut appareat iis qui in tenebris et umbra mortis positi sunt.\"  \"Darkness and the shadow of death\" indeed, and what light like the light and comfort such a woman as my Mary Masury brings!  And so, but for one of the accidents, as we call them, I should have dropped the boys at the corner of Dover Street, and gone home with my Christmas lesson.  But it happened, as we irreverently say,--it happened as we crossed Park Square, so called from its being an irregular pentagon of which one of the sides has been taken away, that I recognized a tall man, plodding across in the snow, head down, round-shouldered, stooping forward in walking, with his right shoulder higher than his left; and by these tokens I knew Tom Coram, prince among Boston princes. Not Thomas Coram that built the Foundling Hospital, though he was of Boston too; but he was longer ago. You must look for him in Addison's contribution to a supplement to the Spectator,--the old Spectator, I mean, not the Thursday Spectator, which is more recent. Not Thomas Coram, I say, but Tom Coram, who would build a hospital to-morrow, if you showed him the need, without waiting to die first, and always helps forward, as a prince should, whatever is princely, be it a statue at home, a school at Richmond, a newspaper in Florida, a church in Exeter, a steam-line to Liverpool, or a widow who wants a hundred dollars. I wished him a merry Christmas, and Mr. Howland, by a fine instinct, drew up the horses as I spoke. Coram shook hands; and, as it seldom happens that I have an empty carriage while he is on foot, I asked him if I might not see him home. He was glad to get in. We wrapped him up with spoils of the bear, the fox, and the bison, turned the horses' heads again,--five hours now since they started on this entangled errand of theirs,--and gave him his ride. \"I was thinking of you at the moment,\" said Coram,--\"thinking of old college times, of the mystery of language as unfolded by the Abb√© Faria to Edmond Dantes in the depths of the Chateau d'If. I was wondering if you could teach me Japanese, if I asked you to a Christmas dinner.\" I laughed. Japan was really a novelty then, and I asked him since when he had been in correspondence with the sealed country. It seemed that their house at Shanghae had just sent across there their agents for establishing the first house in Edomo, in Japan, under the new treaty. Everything looked promising, and the beginnings were made for the branch which has since become Dot and Trevilyan there. Of this he had the first tidings in his letters by the mail of that afternoon. John Coram, his brother, had written to him, and had said that he enclosed for his amusement the Japanese bill of particulars, as it had been drawn out, on which they had founded their orders for the first assorted cargo ever to be sent from America to Edomo. Bill of particulars there was, stretching down the long tissue-paper in exquisite chirography. But by some freak of the \"total depravity of things,\" the translated order for the assorted cargo was not there. John Coram, in his care to fold up the Japanese writing nicely, had left on his own desk at Shanghae the more intelligible English. \"And so I must wait,\" said Tom philosophically, \"till the next East India mail for my orders, certain that seven English houses have had less enthusiastic and philological correspondents than my brother.\"  I said I did not see that. That I could not teach him to speak the Taghalian dialects so well, that he could read them with facility before Saturday. But I could do a good deal better. Did he remember writing a note to old Jack Percival for me five years ago? No, he remembered no such thing; he knew Jack Percival, but never wrote a note to him in his life. Did he remember giving me fifty dollars, because I had taken a delicate boy, whom I was going to send to sea, and I was not quite satisfied with the government outfit? No, he did not remember that, which was not strange, for that was a thing he was doing every day. \"Well, I don't care how much you remember, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32455"],["title","Christmas Eve and Christmas Day: Ten Christmas stories (#8)"],["body","the boy about whom you wrote to Jack Percival, for whose mother's ease of mind you provided the half-hundred, is back again,--strong, straight, and well; what is more to the point, he had the whole charge of Perry's commissariat on shore at Yokohama, was honorably discharged out there, reads Japanese better than you read English; and if it will help you at all, he shall be here at your house at breakfast.\" For as I spoke we stopped at Coram's door. \"Ingham,\" said Coram, \"if you were not a parson, I should say you were romancing.\" \"My child,\" said I, \"I sometimes write a parable for the Atlantic; but the words of my lips are verity, as all those of the Sandemanians. Go to bed; do not even dream of the Taghalian dialects; be sure that the Japanese interpreter will breakfast with you, and the next time you are in a scrape send for the nearest minister. George, tell your brother Ezra that Mr. Coram wishes him to breakfast here to-morrow morning at eight o'clock; don't forget the number, Pemberton Square, you know.\" \"Yes, sir,\" said George; and Thomas Coram laughed, said \"Merry Christmas,\" and we parted.  It was time we were all in bed, especially these boys. But glad enough am I as I write these words that the meeting of Coram set us back that dropped-stitch in our night's journey. There was one more delay. We were sweeping by the Old State House, the boys singing again, \"Carol, carol, Christians,\" as we dashed along the still streets, when I caught sight of Adams Todd, and he recognized me. He had heard us singing when we were at the Advertiser office. Todd is an old fellow-apprentice of mine,--and he is now, or rather was that night, chief pressman in the Argus office. I like the Argus people,--it was there that I was South American Editor, now many years ago,--and they befriend me to this hour. Todd hailed me, and once more I stopped. \"What sent you out from your warm steam-boiler?\" \"Steam-boiler, indeed,\" said Todd. \"Two rivets loose,--steam-room full of steam,--police frightened,--neighborhood in a row,--and we had to put out the fire. She would have run a week without hurting a fly,--only a little puff in the street sometimes. But there we are, Ingham. We shall lose the early mail as it stands. Seventy-eight tokens to be worked now.\" They always talked largely of their edition at the Argus. Saw it with many eyes, perhaps; but this time, I am sure, Todd spoke true. I caught his idea at once. In younger and more muscular times, Todd and I had worked the Adams press by that fly-wheel for full five minutes at a time, as a test of strength; and in my mind's eye, I saw that he was printing his paper at this moment with relays of grinding stevedores. He said it was so. \"But think of it to-night,\" said he. \"It is Christmas eve, and not an Irishman to be hired, though one paid him ingots. Not a man can stand the grind ten minutes.\" I knew that very well from old experience, and I thanked him inwardly for not saying \"the demnition grind,\" with Mantilini. \"We cannot run the press half the time,\" said he; \"and the men we have are giving out now. We shall lose all our carrier delivery.\" \"Todd,\" said I, \"is this a night to be talking of ingots, or hiring, or losing, or gaining? When will you learn that Love rules the court, the camp, and the Argus office.\" And I wrote on the back of a letter to Campbell: \"Come to the Argus office, No. 2 Dassett's Alley, with seven men not afraid to work\"; and I gave it to John and Sam, bade Howland take the boys to Campbell's house,--walked down with Todd to his office,--challenged him to take five minutes at the wheel, in memory of old times,--made the tired relays laugh as they saw us take hold; and then,--when I had cooled off, and put on my Cardigan,--met Campbell, with his seven sons of Anak, tumbling down the stairs, wondering what round of mercy the parson had found for them this time. I started home, knowing I should now have my Argus with my coffee.   III.  And so I walked home. Better so, perhaps, after all, than in the lively sleigh, with the tinkling bells.      \"It was a calm and silent night!--       Seven hundred years and fifty-three     Had Rome been growing up to might,       And now was queen of land and sea!     No sound was heard of clashing wars,--       Peace brooded o'er the hushed domain;     Apollo, Pallas, Jove, and Mars       Held undisturbed their ancient reign         In the solemn midnight,           Centuries ago!\"  What an eternity it seemed since I started with those children singing carols. Bethlehem, Nazareth, Calvary, Rome, Roman senators, Tiberius, Paul, Nero, Clement, Ephrem, Ambrose, and all the singers,--Vincent de Paul, and all the loving wonder-workers, Milton and Herbert and all the carol-writers, Luther and Knox and all the prophets,--what a world of people had been keeping Christmas with Sam Perry and Lycidas and Harry and me; and here were Yokohama and the Japanese, the Daily Argus and its ten million tokens and their readers,--poor Fanny Woodhull and her sick mother there, keeping Christmas too! For a finite world, these are a good many \"waits\" to be singing in one poor fellow's ears on one Christmas tide.      \"'Twas in the calm and silent night!--       The senator of haughty Rome,     Impatient urged his chariot's flight,       From lordly revel, rolling home.     Triumphal arches gleaming swell       His breast, with thoughts of boundless sway.     What recked the _Roman_ what befell       A paltry province far away,         In the solemn midnight,           Centuries ago!      \"Within that province far away       Went plodding home a weary boor;     A streak of light before him lay,       Fallen through a half-shut stable door     Across his path. He passed,--for naught       Told _what was going on within_;     How keen the stars, his only thought,       The air how calm and cold and thin,         In the solemn midnight,           Centuries ago!\"  \"Streak of light\"--Is there a light in Lycidas's room? They not in bed! That is making a night of it! Well, there are few hours of the day or night when I have not been in Lycidas's room, so I let myself in by the night-key he gave me, ran up the stairs,--it is a horrid seven-storied, first-class lodging-house. For my part, I had as lief live in a steeple. Two flights I ran up, two steps at a time,--I was younger then than I am now,--pushed open the door which was ajar, and saw such a scene of confusion as I never saw in Mary's over-nice parlor before. Queer! I remember the first thing that I saw was wrong was a great ball of white German worsted on the floor. Her basket was upset. A great Christmas-tree lay across the rug, quite too high for the room; a large sharp-pointed Spanish clasp-knife was by it, with which they had been lopping it; there were two immense baskets of white papered presents, both upset; but what frightened me most was the centre-table. Three or four handkerchiefs on it,--towels, napkins, I know not what,--all brown and red and almost black with blood! I turned, heart-sick, to look into the bedroom,--and I really had a sense of relief when I saw somebody. Bad enough it was, however. Lycidas, but just now so strong and well, lay pale and exhausted on the bloody bed, with the clothing removed from his right thigh and leg, while over him bent Mary and Morton. I learned afterwards that poor Lycidas, while trimming the Christmas-tree, and talking merrily with Mary and Morton,--who, by good luck, had brought round his presents late, and was staying to tie on glass balls and apples,--had given himself a deep and dangerous wound with the point of the unlucky knife, and had lost a great deal of blood before the hemorrhage could be controlled. Just before I entered, the stick tourniquet which Morton had improvised had slipped in poor Mary's unpractised hand, at the moment he was about to secure the bleeding artery, and the blood followed in such a gush as compelled him to give his whole attention to stopping its flow. He only knew my entrance by the \"Ah, Mr. Ingham,\" of the frightened Irish girl, who stood useless behind the head of the bed.  \"O Fred,\" said Morton, without looking up, \"I am glad you are here.\"  \"And what can I do for you?\"  \"Some whiskey,--first of all.\"  \"There are two bottles,\" said Mary, who was holding the candle,--\"in the cupboard, behind his dressing-glass.\"  I took Bridget with me, struck a light in the dressing-room (how she blundered about the match), and found the cupboard door locked! Key doubtless in Mary's pocket,--probably in pocket of \"another dress.\" I did not ask. Took my own bunch, willed tremendously that my account-book drawer key should govern the lock, and it did. If it had not, I should have put my fist through the panels. Bottle of bedbug poison; bottle marked \"bay rum\"; another bottle with no mark; two bottles of Saratoga water. \"Set them all on the floor, Bridget.\" A tall bottle of Cologne. Bottle marked in MS. What in the world is it? \"Bring that candle, Bridget.\" \"Eau destill√©e. Marron, Montreal.\" What in the world did Lycidas bring distilled water from Montreal for? And then Morton's clear voice in the other room, \"As quick as you can, Fred.\" \"Yes! in one moment. Put all these on the floor, Bridget.\" Here they are at last. \"Bourbon whiskey.\" \"Corkscrew, Bridget.\"  \"Indade, sir, and where is it?\" \"Where? I don't know. Run down as quick as you can, and bring it. His wife cannot leave him.\" So Bridget ran, and the first I heard was the rattle as she pitched down the last six stairs of the first flight headlong. Let us hope she has not broken her leg. I meanwhile am driving a silver pronged fork into the Bourbon corks, and the blade of my own penknife on the other side.  \"Now, Fred,\" from George within. (We all call Morton \"George.\") \"Yes, in one moment,\" I replied. Penknife blade breaks off, fork pulls right out, two crumbs of cork come with it. Will that girl never come?  I turned round; I found a goblet on the washstand; I took"]]]
