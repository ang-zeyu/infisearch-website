They were ghosts in the background of his mind. Yet, pale and ectoplasmic as they were, they were easily identifiable. Mapfarity loomed above the others, a transparent Colossus radiating streamers of confidence in his clumsy strength. A meat-eater, uncertain about the future, with a hope and trust in Rastignac to show him the right way. And with a strong current of anger against the conqueror who had inflicted the Skin upon him.  Archambaud was a shorter phantom, rolypoly even in his psychic manifestations, emitting bursts of impatience because other people did not talk fast enough to suit him, his mind leaping on ahead of their tongues, his fingers wriggling to wrap themselves around something valuable--preferably the eggs of the golden goose--and a general eagerness to be up and about and onwards. He was one round fidget on two legs, yet a good man for any project requiring action.  Faintly, Rastignac detected the slumbering guard as if he were the tendrils of some plant at the sea-bottom, floating in the green twilight, at peace and unconscious.  And even more faintly he felt Lusine's presence, shielded by the walls of the shaft. Hers was a pale and light hand, one whose fingers tapped a barely heard code of impotent rage and voiceless screaming fear. Yet beneath that anguish was a base of confidence and mockery at others. She might be temporarily upset, but when the chance came for her to do something she would seize it with every ability at her command.  Another radiation dipped into the general picture and out. A wild glowworm had swooped over them and disturbed the smooth reflection built up by the Skins.  This was the way the Skins worked. They penetrated into you and found out what you were feeling and emoting, and then they broadcast it to other closeby Skins, which then projected their hosts' psychosomatic responses. The whole was then integrated so that each Skin-wearer could detect the group-feeling and at the same time, though in a much duller manner, the feeling of the individuals of the _gestalt_.  That wasn't the only function of the Skin. The parasite, created in the bio-factories, had several other social and biological uses.  Rastignac almost fell into a reverie at that point. It was nothing unusual. The effect of the Skins was a slowing-down one. The wearer thought more slowly, acted more leisurely, and was much more contented.  But now, by a deliberate wrenching of himself from the feeling-pattern, Rastignac woke up. There were things to do, and standing around and drinking in the lotus of the group-rapport was not one of them.  He gestured at the prostrate form of the mucketeer. \"You didn't hurt him?\"  The Ssassaror rumbled, \"No. I scratched him with a little venom of the dream-snake. He will sleep for an hour or so. Besides, I would not be allowed to hurt him. You forget that all this is carefully staged by the King's Official Jail-breaker.\"  \"_Me'dt!_\" swore Rastignac.  Alarmed, Archambaud said, \"What's the matter, Jean-Jacques?\"  \"Can't we do anything on our own? Must the King meddle in everything?\"  \"You wouldn't want us to take a chance and have to shed _blood_, would you?\" breathed Archambaud.  \"What are you carrying those swords for? As a decoration?\" Rastignac snarled.  \"_Seelahs, m'fweh_,\" warned Mapfarity. \"If you alarm the other guards, you will embarrass them. They will be forced to do their duty and recapture you. And the Jail-breaker would be reprimanded because he had fallen down on his job. He might even get a demotion.\"  Rastignac was so upset that his Skin, reacting to the negative fields racing over the Skin and the hormone imbalance of his blood, writhed away from his back.  \"What are we, a bunch children playing war?\"  Mapfarity growled, \"We are all God's children, and we mustn't hurt anyone if we can help it.\"  \"Mapfarity, you eat meat!\"  \"_Voo zavf w'zaw m'fweh_,\" admitted the Giant. \"But it is the flesh of unintelligent creatures. I have not yet shed the blood of any being that can talk with the tongue of Man.\"  Rastignac snorted and said, \"If you stick with me you will some day do that, _m'fweh_ Mapfarity. There is no other course. It is inevitable.\"  \"Nature spare me the day! But if it comes it will find Mapfarity unafraid. They do not call me Giant for nothing.\"  Rastignac sighed and walked ahead. Sometimes he wondered if the members of his underground--or anybody else for that matter--ever realized the grim conclusions formed by the Philosophy of Violence.  The Amphibians, he was sure, did. And they were doing something positive about it. But it was the Amphibians who had driven Rastignac to adopt a Philosophy of Violence.  \"_Law_,\" he said again. \"Let's go.\"  The three of them walked out of the huge courtyard and through the open gate. Nearby stood a short man whose Skin gleamed black-red in the light shed by the two glowworms attached to his shoulders. The Skin was oversized and hung to the ground.  The King's man, however, did not think he was a comic figure. He sputtered, and the red of his face matched the color of the skin on his back.  \"You took long enough,\" he said accusingly and then, when Rastignac opened his mouth to protest, the Jail-breaker said, \"Never mind, never mind. _Sa n'apawt_. The thing is that we get you away fast. The Minister of Ill-Will has doubtless by now received word that an official jail-break is planned for tonight. He will send a company of his mucketeers to intercept you. By coming in advance of the appointed time we shall have time to escape before the official rescue party arrives.\"  \"How much time do we have?\" asked Rastignac.  The King's man said, \"Let's see. After I escort you through the rooms of the Duke, the King's foster-brother--he is most favorable to the Violent Philosophy, you know, and has petitioned the King to become your official patron, which petition will be considered at the next meeting of the Chamber of Deputies in three months--let's see, where was I? Ah, yes, I escort you through the rooms of the King's brother. You will be disguised as His Majesty's mucketeers, ostensibly looking for the escaped prisoners. From the rooms of the Duke you will be let out through a small door in the wall of the palace itself. A car will be waiting.  \"From then on it will be up to you. I suggest, however, that you make a dash for Mapfarity's castle. Follow the _Rue des Nues_; that is your best chance. The mucketeers have been pulled off that boulevard. However, it is possible that Auverpin, the Ill-Will Minister, may see that order and will rescind it, realizing what it means. If he does, I suppose I will see you back in your cell, Rastignac.\"  He bowed to the Ssassaror and Archambaud and said, \"And you two gentlemen will then be with him.\"  \"And then what?\" rumbled Mapfarity.  \"According to the law, you will be allowed one more jail-break. Any more after that will, of course, be illegal. That is, unthinkable.\"  Rastignac unsheathed his épée and slashed it at the air. \"Let the mucketeers stand in my way,\" he said fiercely. \"I will cut them down with this!\"  The Jail-breaker staggered back, hands outthrust.  \"Please, Monsieur Rastignac! Please! Don't even talk about it! You know that your philosophy is, as yet, illegal. The shedding of blood is an act that will be regarded with horror throughout the sentient planet. People would think you are an Amphibian!\"  \"The Amphibians know what they're doing far better than we do,\" answered Rastignac. \"Why do you think they're winning against us Humans?\"  Suddenly, before anybody could answer, the sound of blaring horns came from somewhere on the ramparts. Shouts went up; drums began to beat, calling the mucketeers to alert.  And above it all came the roar of a giant Ssassaror voice: \"_An Earthship has landed in the sea! And the pilot of the ship is in the hands of the Amphibians!_\"  As the meaning of the words seeped into Rastignac's consciousness he made a sudden violent movement--and began to tear the Skin from his body!   VI  Rastignac ran down the steps, out into the courtyard. He seized the Jail-breaker's arm and demanded the key to the grilles. Dazed, the white-faced official meekly and silently handed it to him. Without his Skin Rastignac was no longer fearfully inhibited. If you were forceful enough and did not behave according to the normal pattern you could get just about anything you wanted. The average Man or Ssassaror did not know how to react to his violence. By the time they had recovered from their confusion he could be miles away.  Such a thought flashed through his head as he ran towards the prison wells. At the same time he heard the horn-blasts of the king's mucketeers and knew that he shortly would have a different type of Man to deal with. The mucketeers, closest approach to soldiers in this pacifistic land, wore Skins that conditioned them to be more belligerent than the common citizen. They carried épées and, while it was true that their points were dull and their wielders had never engaged in serious swordsmanship, the mucketeers could be dangerous from a viewpoint of numbers alone.  Mapfarity bellowed, \"Jean-Jacques, what are you doing?\"  He called back over his shoulder, \"I'm taking Lusine with us! She can help us get the Earthman from the Amphibians!\"  The Giant lumbered up behind him, threw a rope down to the eager hands of Lusine and pulled her up without effort to the top of the well. A second later, Rastignac leaped upon Mapfarity's back, dug his hands under the upper fringe of the huge Skin and, ignoring its electrical blasts, ripped downwards.  Mapfarity cried out with shock and surprise as his skin flopped on the stones like a devilfish on dry land.  Archambaud ran up then and, without bothering to explain, the Ssassaror and the Man seized him and peeled off _his_ artificial hide.  \"Now we're all free men!\" panted Rastignac. \"And the mucketeers have no way of locating us if"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31262"],["title","Rastignac the Devil (#5)"],["body","hide, nor can they punish us with shocks.\"  He put the Giant on his right side, Lusine on his left, and the egg-stealer behind him. He removed the Jail-breaker's rapier from his sheath. The official was too astonished to protest.  \"_Law, m'zawfa!_\" cried Rastignac, parodying in his grotesque French the old Gallic war cry of \"_Allons, mes enfants!_\"  The King's official came to life and screamed orders at the group of mucketeers who had poured into the courtyard. They halted in confusion. They could not hear him above the roar of horns and thunder of drums and the people sticking their heads out of windows and shouting.  Rastignac scooped up with his épée one of the abandoned Skins flopping on the floor and threw it at the foremost guard. It descended upon the man's head, knocking off his hat and wrapping itself around the head and shoulders. The guard dropped his sword and staggered backwards into the group. At the same time the escapees charged and bowled over their feeble opposition.  It was here that Rastignac drew first blood. The tip of his épée drove past a bewildered mucketeer's blade and entered the fellow's throat just below the chin. It did not penetrate very far because of the dullness of the point. Nevertheless, when Rastignac withdrew his sword he saw blood spurt.  It was the first flower of violence, this scarlet blossom set against the whiteness of a Man's skin.  It would, if he had worn his Skin, have sickened him. Now, he exulted with a shout of triumph.  Lusine swooped up from behind him, bent over the fallen man. Her fingers dipped into the blood and went to her mouth. Greedily, she sucked her fingers.  Rastignac struck her cheek hard with the flat of his hand. She staggered back, her eyes narrow, but she laughed.  The next moments were busy as they entered the castle, knocked down two mucketeers who tried to prevent their passage to the Duke's rooms, then filed across the long suite.  The Duke rose from his writing-desk to greet them. Rastignac, determined to sever all ties and impress the government with the fact that he meant a real violence, snarled at his benefactor, \"_Va t'feh fout!_\"  The Duke was disconcerted at this harsh command, so obviously impossible to carry out. He blinked and said nothing. The escapees hurried past him to the door that gave exit to the outside. They pushed it open and stepped out into the car that waited for them. A chauffeur leaned against its thin wooden body.  Mapfarity pushed him aside and climbed in. The others followed. Rastignac was the last to get in. He examined in a glance the vehicle they were supposed to make their flight in.  It was as good a car as you could find in the realm. A Renault of the large class, it had a long boat-shaped scarlet body. There wasn't a scratch on it. It had seats for six. And that it had the power to outrun most anything was indicated by the two extra pairs of legs sticking out from the bottom. There were twelve pairs of legs, equine in form and shod with the best steel. It was the kind of vehicle you wanted when you might have to take off across the country. Wheeled cars could go faster on the highway, but this Renault would not be daunted by water, plowed fields, or steep hillsides.  Rastignac climbed into the driver's seat, seized the wheel and pressed his foot down on the accelerator. The nerve-spot beneath the pedal sent a message to the muscles hidden beneath the hood and the legs projecting from the body. The Renault lurched forward, steadied, and began to pick up speed. It entered a broad paved highway. Hooves drummed; sparks shot out from the steel shoes.  Rastignac guided the brainless, blind creature concealed within the body. He was helped by the somatically-generated radar it employed to steer it past obstacles. When he came to the _Rue des Nues_, he slowed it down to a trot. There was no use tiring it out. Halfway up the gentle slope of the boulevard, however, a Ford galloped out from a side-street. Its seats bristled with tall peaked hats with outspread glowworm wings and with drawn épées.  Rastignac shoved the accelerator to the floor. The Renault broke into a gallop. The Ford turned so that it would present its broad side. As there was a fencework of tall shrubbery growing along the boulevard, the Ford was thus able to block most of the passage.  But, just before his vehicle reached the Ford, Rastignac pressed the Jump button. Few cars had this; only sportsmen or the royalty could afford to have such a neural circuit installed. And it did not allow for gradations in leaping. It was an all-or-none reaction; the legs spurned the ground in perfect unison and with every bit of the power in them. There was no holding back.  The nose lifted, the Renault soared into the air. There was a shout, a slight swaying as the trailing hooves struck the heads of mucketeers who had been stupid enough not to duck, and the vehicle landed with a screeching lurch, upright, on the other side of the Ford. Nor did it pause.  Half an hour later Rastignac reined in the car under a large tree whose shadow protected them. \"We're well out in the country,\" he said.  \"What do we do now?\" asked impatient Archambaud.  \"First we must know more about this Earthman,\" Rastignac answered. \"Then we can decide.\"   VII  Dawn broke through night's guard and spilled a crimson swath on the hills to the East, and the Six Flying Stars faded from sight like a necklace of glowing jewels dipped into an ink bottle.  Rastignac halted the weary Renault on the top of a hill, looked down over the landscape spread out for miles below him. Mapfarity's castle--a tall rose-colored tower of flying buttresses--flashed in the rising sun. It stood on another hill by the sea shore. The country around was a madman's dream of color. Yet to Rastignac every hue sickened the eye. That bright green, for instance, was poisonous; that flaming scarlet was bloody; that pale yellow, rheumy; that velvet black, funeral; that pure white, maggotty.  \"Rastignac!\" It was Mapfarity's bass, strumming irritation deep in his chest.  \"What?\"  \"What do we do now?\"  Jean-Jacques was silent. Archambaud spoke plaintively.  \"I'm not used to going without my Skin. There are things I miss. For one thing, I don't know what you're thinking, Jean-Jacques. I don't know whether you're angry at me or love me or are indifferent to me. I don't know where other people _are_. I don't feel the joy of the little animals playing, the freedom of the flight of birds, the ghostly plucking of the growing grass, the sweet stab of the mating lust of the wild-horned apigator, the humming of bees working to build a hive, and the sleepy stupid arrogance of the giant cabbage-eating _deuxnez_. I can feel nothing without the Skin I have worn so long. I feel alone.\"  Rastignac replied, \"You are not alone. I am with you.\"  Lusine spoke in a low voice, her large brown eyes upon his.  \"I, too, feel alone. My Skin is gone, the Skin by which I knew how to act according to the wisdom of my father, the Amphib King. Now that it is gone and I cannot hear his voice through the vibrating tympanum, I do not know what to do.\"  \"At present,\" replied Rastignac, \"you will do as I tell you.\"  Mapfarity repeated, \"What now?\"  Rastignac became brisk. He said, \"We go to your castle, Giant. We use your smithy to put sharp points on our swords, points to slide through a man's body from front to back. Don't pale! That is what we must do. And then we pick up your goose that lays the golden eggs, for we must have money if we are to act efficiently. After that, we buy--or steal--a boat and we go to wherever the Earthman is held captive. And we rescue him.\"  \"And then?\" said Lusine, her eyes shining with emotion.  \"What you do then will be up to you. But I am going to leave this planet and voyage with the Earthman to other worlds.\"  Silence. Then Mapfarity said, \"Why leave here?\"  \"Because there is no hope for this land. Nobody will give up his Skin. _Le Beau Pays_ is doomed to a lotus-life. And that is not for me.\"  Archambaud jerked a thumb at the Amphib girl. \"What about her people?\"  \"They may win, the water-people. What's the difference? It will be just the exchange of one Skin for another. Before I heard of the landing of the Earthman I was going to fight no matter what the cost to me or inevitable defeat. But not now.\"  Mapfarity's rumble was angry. \"Ah, Jean-Jacques, this is not my comrade talking. Are you sure you haven't swallowed your Skin? You talk as if you were inside-out. What is the matter with your brain? Can't you see that it will indeed make a difference if the Amphibs get the upper hand? Can't you see _who_ is making the Amphibs behave the way they have been?\"  Rastignac urged the Renault towards the rose-colored lacy castle high upon a hill. The vehicle trotted tiredly along the rough and narrow forest path.  \"What do you mean?\" he said.  \"I mean the Amphibs got along fine with the Ssassaror until a new element entered their lives--the Earthmen. Then the antagonising began. What is this new element? It's the Changelings--the mixture of Earthmen and Amphibs or Ssassaror and Terran. Add it up. Turn it around. Look at it from any angle. It is the Changelings who are behind this restlessness--the Human element.  \"Another thing. The Amphibs have always had Skins different from ours. Our factories create our Skins to set up an affinity and communication between their wearers and all of Nature. They are designed to make it easier for every Man to love his neighbor.  \"Now, the strange thing about the Amphibs' Skin is that they, too, were once designed to do such things. But in the past thirty or forty years new Skins have been created for one primary purpose--to establish a communication between the Sea-King and his subjects. Not only that, the Skins can be operated at long distances so that the King may punish any disobedient subject. And they are set so that they establish affinity only among the Waterfolk, not between them and"]]]
