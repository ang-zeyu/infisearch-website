Subsequent molts, both from postjuvenal to adult pelage and between adult pelages, are less regular in point, or points, of origin, width of progressing molt, and amount of surface molting at one time. Half or more of the dorsum is oftentimes involved in the same stage of molt at once. In some specimens the molt begins along the lateral line, and in others in several centers on the sides. In some skins distinct lines of molt are visible without parting the hair, and in some others the molt is patchy in appearance. Growth of new hair is apparent at various times of the year as a result of injury such as that caused by bot fly larvae, cuts, scratches, or bites of other mice. Abrasion, wear, irritation by ectoparasites, and other kinds of injury to the skin may play a part in the development of a patchy molt. Both breeding and molting are sources of considerable stress, and the delay of the peak of molting activity until November when breeding activity has decreased seems of benefit to the mice. A change in the ratio of young mice (categories 1, 2, and 3) to old mice (categories 4 and 5) between August and November was noted. In August, 29 per cent of the population is composed of old mice, and in November only 6 per cent. This change results from birth of young as well as death of old mice, but may indicate that a mouse in November has less than one chance in ten of being alive the following November. Some females born early in the reproductive season breed in their first summer or autumn. For example, a female of category 2, taken on August 12, and probably in postjuvenal pelage, had placental scars. Undoubtedly the young of the year contribute to the breeding population, especially late in the season.  [Illustration: FIG. 3. Frequency distributions, according to size, of _Reithrodontomys megalotis_ and _Peromyscus maniculatus_ in three samples taken in August, September, and November. Sexes and pregnancy or nonpregnancy of females are indicated. See discussion in text.]  In Figure 3 the proportion of females bearing embryos in August, September, and November is shown. Of the females trapped in August, 11 of 32 that were more than 144 mm. in total length contained embryos; an additional 14 females were lactating or possessed placental scars or enlarged uteri. Therefore, approximately 80 per cent of the larger females were reproducing in August. In September two females were pregnant and an additional sixteen of the 44 females examined showed other evidence of reproduction; these eighteen females make up 41 per cent of those more than 144 mm. in total length. The only reproductive data available for November pertain to the presence or absence of embryos. No female was pregnant although 35 females more than 144 mm. in total length were examined. Some of the skins show prominent mammae indicative of recent nursing, and juveniles less than a month old were taken. The reproductive activity of deer mice on the Mesa Verde seems to be greatly reduced in autumn.   Peromyscus difficilis nasutus (J.A. Allen) Rock Mouse       _Specimen_: 1 mi. NNW Rock Springs, 7600 ft., 69413, a young      individual completing the molt from juvenal to postjuvenal pelage.   Peromyscus truei truei (Shufeldt) Pinyon Mouse       _Specimens examined._--Total, 42: North end Mesa Verde National      Park, 7000 ft., 76220-76232; Far View Ruins, 7700 ft., 69326-69327,      79222, and 8 uncatalogued specimens in preservative; Far View      Point, 76532-76535; Far View House, 7700 ft., 74416 MVZ; 1/2 mi.      NNW Rock Springs, 7500 ft., 69429-69430; Rock Springs, 7400 ft.,      69431-69435; Park Well, 7450 ft., 69428; Headquarters, MV 7882/507;      back of Museum, MV 7879/507, 7880/507, 7881/507; Square Tower      House, 6700 ft., 69438.  In August three females were pregnant or lactating, or both. None of seven adult females taken in November was pregnant.   Neotoma cinerea arizonae Merriam Bushy-tailed Wood Rat       _Specimen_: Head of Prater Canyon, MV 7873/507. Another, in the      Denver Museum, from Spruce Tree House, was reported by Finley      (1958:270).  _Neotoma cinerea_ prefers vertical crevices in high cliffs but occupies other areas.   Neotoma mexicana inopinata Goldman Mexican Wood Rat       _Specimens examined._--Total, 10: Headquarters, MV 7890/507 and      probably 7861/507, 74421 MVZ; Spruce Tree Lodge, 6950 ft.,      34802-34803; Spruce Tree House, 74419-74420 MVZ; Square Tower      House, MV 7869/507; Cliff Palace, 74422 MVZ; Balcony House, MV      7868/507.  The Mexican wood rat is the most common species of wood rat on the Mesa Verde. The two specimens from Spruce Tree Lodge obtained by R.B. Finley on September 2, 1949, are young individuals.       Another species of the genus, the white-throated wood rat, _Neotoma      albigula_, may occur within the Park, since three specimens      (34757-34759) from the Mesa Verde were trapped on September 15,      1949, by R.B. Finley, approximately 4-1/2 miles south of the Park      [6 mi. E, 17 mi. S Cortez, 5600 ft.--south of the area shown in      Figure 2]. Finley (1958:450) stated that at that locality he      trapped _Neotoma mexicana_ [No. 34801], that _N. albigula_ was      perhaps more common there than _N. mexicana_, that dens of _N.      albigula_ were more common than those of _N. mexicana_ under large      rocks in the talus on the south slope of the Mesa, and that dens of      _N. mexicana_ seemed to be more numerous in crevices of ledges in      the bedrock and cliffs.   Ondatra zibethicus osoyoosensis (Lord) Muskrat  D. Watson (in letter of January 16, 1957) reported that he has seen muskrat tracks many times along the Mancos River. He also relates a report received from Chief Ranger Wade and D.A. Spencer who saw a muskrat, no doubt a wanderer, on the Knife Edge Road on a cold winter night. These men, both reliable observers, stopped and saw the muskrat at a distance of two feet, where it took shelter under a power shovel parked beside the road. Reports of dens seen along the Mancos River are available for 1944, 1945, 1946, and 1947.   Microtus longicaudus mordax (Merriam) Long-tailed Vole       _Specimens examined._--Total, 36: North end Mesa Verde National      Park, 7000 ft., 76233-76237; entrance to Mesa Verde National Park,      5123-5126 in Denver Museum; Prater Canyon, 7600 ft., 76238-76244;      Upper Well, Prater Canyon, 7575 ft., 69441; Morfield Canyon, 7600      ft., 76245-76259, 76261-76263; west bank Mancos River, northeast      side Mesa Verde National Park, 76260.  The vegetation at the above-named localities is a combination of brush and grasses that are both more luxuriant than in areas dominated by pinyon and juniper on the more southern and altitudinally lower part of the top of the Mesa where no _M. longicaudus_ was taken.   Microtus mexicanus mogollonensis (Mearns) Mexican Vole       _Specimens examined._--Total, 22: Prater Canyon, 7600 ft.,      76283-76287; Sect. 27, head of east fork of Navajo Canyon, 7900      ft., 69442; Far View Ruins, 7700 ft., 69443, 79223-79224; 2 mi. NNW      Rock Springs, 7900 ft., 69444-69446; Park Well, 7450 ft.,      69447-69453; rock ledge at head of Spruce Tree Canyon, unnumbered      specimen in Denver Museum; Headquarters, MV 7895/507, 7896/507.  The first specimen of the Mexican vole from Colorado was obtained on the Mesa Verde and has been reported by Rodeck and Anderson (1956:436). Specimens have now been taken at seven localities on the Mesa. Prater Canyon is the only one of these localities at which any other species of vole was taken. There _Microtus longicaudus_ and _Microtus montanus_ were also obtained. Judging from the vegetation at the above localities, _M. mexicanus_ is to be expected in drier areas with less cover than _M. montanus_ inhabits, and in areas having less cover than those inhabited by _M. longicaudus_.   Microtus montanus fusus Hall Montane Vole       _Specimens examined._--Total, 16: Upper Well, 7575 ft.,      69454-69465; 1/4 mi. N Middle Well, 7500 ft., 69466-69469.  The voles were trapped in the dry but dense meadow of grass and sedge covering the floor of the canyon (see Plate 1). _Sorex vagrans_ was trapped in the same places. Four of the females of _M. montanus_ trapped on September 3, 1956, were pregnant.   Erethizon dorsatum couesi Mearns Porcupine       _Specimens examined._--Total, 2: 69470, old [Female], and 69471,      her young male offspring, both obtained on August 28, 1956, in the      canyon of the Mancos River, 6200 feet, along the western side of      the River.  I saw no other porcupine in the Park.  In 1935, C.W. Quaintance took special notice of porcupines because of the possibility, then being considered, of their being detrimental to habitat conditions thought to be favorable to wild turkeys. Porcupines were suspected of killing ponderosa pine, which occurred in only a few places, and which was thought to be necessary for wild turkeys. Porcupines were recorded as follows: one found dead on the road at the North Rim on March 16; one killed in oak brush along the North Rim; one killed between April 15 and May 15; oak brush damaged by porcupines in Soda Canyon below the well; one seen on July 4 on the Poole Canyon Trail; one seen at the foot of the Mesa on June 26; one seen by Lloyd White in Moccasin Canyon on June 27; and one seen by Mrs. Sharon Spencer on July 1 in Prater Canyon. After four months on the Mesa Verde, Quaintance concluded that there were not so many porcupines as had been expected and that there were more ponderosa pines than had been expected.  In 1946, Donald A. Spencer began a study of porcupines on the Mesa Verde and in 1958 deposited, in the University of Colorado Library, his results in manuscript form as a dissertation in partial fulfillment of the requirements for a higher degree (\"Porcupi"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31035"],["title","Mammals of Mesa Verde National Park, Colorado (#6)"],["body","population fluctuations in past centuries revealed by dendrochronology,\" 108 numbered and 13 unnumbered pages, 39 figures, and 13 tables). Dendrochronology, or the dating of trees by studying their rings, is a technique widely used in the southwest by archeologists, climatologists, and others. Spencer found that porcupines damage trees in a characteristic manner, and that damage to a pinyon pine was evident as long as the tree lived. By dating approximately 2000 scars and plotting the year for each scar, Spencer observed three peaks since 1865; these were in about 1885, 1905, and 1935. The increase and decrease each time were at about the same rate. The study did not yield precise population estimates. Some porcupines were destroyed but Spencer is of the opinion that the decline that came in following years was independent of the control measures. Spencer thinks that activities of porcupines on the Mesa Verde are a major factor in maintaining a forest cover of relatively young trees, and also in preventing invasion of trees into areas of brush.  The general policy in regard to porcupines from 1930 to 1946 was to kill them because they eat parts of trees. In at least the following years porcupines were killed: 1930, 1933, 1935, 1940, 1943, 1944, and 1946. The largest number reported killed in one year is 71 in 1933 when a crew of men was employed for this purpose. The amount of effort devoted to killing porcupines varied from year to year. The most frequently voiced alarm was that the scenic value of the areas along the entrance highway and near certain ruins was being impaired. The direst prediction was that all pine trees on the Mesa Verde were doomed to extinction in the near future. The last prediction has not come to pass, nor has this extinction occurred in the past thousand years and more during which pine trees and porcupines have existed together on the Mesa Verde.  In 1946 the studies of Spencer, Wade, and Fitch began. Much effort was expended in obtaining and dating scars for analysis, and the interesting results mentioned above were the reward. Also many porcupines were captured alive and marked with ear-tags so that they could be recognized later. For example, in the winter of 1946 and 1947, 117 were marked in Soda Canyon. A decline in numbers in recent years reduced the impetus for continuation of the study by reducing the results obtained for each day spent searching for porcupines. Information obtained on movements of porcupines relative to season and weather conditions in these studies may be summarized and published later. Data regarding ratio of young to adult animals from year to year are also of interest.  The effect of a porcupine on a single tree is often easy to assess. The effect of a fluctuating population of porcupines on a mixed forest is not so easy to assess, but is of more intrinsic interest. It is desirable that studies designed to evaluate the latter effect continue while the population remains low and also when the next cyclic increase begins. Publication of Spencer's results would be a major step forward.  Cahalane (1948:253) mentions the difficulty that has been experienced in protecting aesthetically desirable trees around cliff dwellings. Perhaps in a local area removal of porcupines is sometimes warranted, but control of the porcupine seems undesirable to me, as a general policy, because one purpose of a National Park is to preserve natural conditions and that implies naturally occurring changes.  What is needed is continued careful study of the ecological relationships of animals and of plants. National parks provide, to the extent that they are not disturbed or \"controlled,\" especially favorable places for studies of this sort.   Mus musculus subsp. House Mouse       _Specimens examined._--Total, 7: North end Mesa Verde National      Park, 7000 ft, 76290; west bank Mancos River northeast side Mesa      Verde National Park, 76291-76296.   Canis latrans mearnsi Merriam Coyote       _Specimens examined._--Total, 3: 69472, skull only of a young      individual, found dead at the top of the bank of the Mancos River,      1-1/2 mi. E Waters Cabin, 6400 ft., August 29, 1956, probably      killed by man; ad. [Male], 76298, taken by J.R. Alcorn, November      10, 1957, on the top of the Mesa at Square Tower House; and skin      and skull, MV 7858/507, without data.  Tracks or scats of the coyote were seen in all parts of the Park visited. Coyotes range throughout the area. On September 3, 1956, 35 coyote scats were found on the dirt roads in Prater and Morfield canyons above 7300 feet elevation and on the road crossing the divide between these canyons. Probably none of these scats was more than a month old. Coyote tracks were seen at some of the fresher scats. Scats associated with fox tracks and scats of small size were not picked up. Nevertheless, a few of the scats studied may have been those of foxes. Judging from the contents of scats that were certainly from foxes, the effect of inadvertent inclusion of fox scats would be to elevate the percentage of scats containing berries (but not more than five percentage points). Each scat was broken up and the percentage of scats containing each of the following items was noted (figures are to the nearest per cent). Remains of deer occurred in 48 per cent of scats, gooseberries (_Ribes_) in 34 per cent, porcupines in 29 per cent, insects in 11 per cent, birds in 11 per cent, unidentified hair in 9 per cent, and unidentified material in 6 per cent. One scat (3 per cent) contained an appreciable amount of plant debris, one contained _Microtus_ along with other items, and one contained only _Sylvilagus_; 14 scats had material of more than one category. The percentage in each category of the volume of each scat was estimated. Data on volume warrant no conclusion other than one that can be drawn from the percentages of occurrence, namely that the major food sources used in August, 1956, by coyotes in these canyons were deer, berries, and porcupines and that other sources, though used, were relatively unimportant. Deer were common in the area. It is fortunate that coyotes remain to help regulate the deer population. Wolves, _Canis lupus_, which at one time occurred in the Park, are now gone. The coyote and mountain lion are the only sizeable predators that remain.   Vulpes vulpes macroura Baird Red Fox  D. Watson (in letter of January 16, 1957) reported that red foxes have been seen on the Mesa by several employees of the Park. These persons know the gray fox, which often is seen in winter feeding at their back doors, and Mr. Watson considers the reports reliable. In the early morning of October 24, 1943, a reddish-yellow fox having a white-tipped tail was observed by three men, one of whom was Chief Ranger Wade, at Park Point. In 1948, 1950, and 1953 black foxes have been reported.   Urocyon cinereoargenteus scottii Mearns Gray Fox       _Specimens examined._--Total, 3: [Male], MV 7867/507, 2 mi. N of      Headquarters, 7400 ft., September 24, 1935, H.P. Pratt; [Male],      76299, November 9, and [Female], 76300, trapped on November 12,      1957, by J.R. Alcorn at Square Tower House.  The gray fox is common on the Mesa.   Ursus americanus amblyceps Baird Black Bear  From 1929 through 1959 at least 151 observations of bears were recorded. Observations were unrecorded in only five years--1952, 1953, 1954, 1956, and 1958. Most observations were in the 1940's and the peak was in 1944 (18 observations) and 1945 (21 observations). Cubs have been recorded in 10 different years. If dated reports are tabulated by months the following figures are obtained for the 12 months beginning with January: 0, 0, 0, 4, 15, 19, 19, 9, 10, 9, 3, 0. The peak in the summer months and the absence of observations in the winter months are significant. Individual bears probably enter and leave the Park in the course of their normal wanderings; however bears probably hibernate, breed, and bear young within the Park and should not be regarded as merely occasionally wandering into the Park.   Procyon lotor pallidus Merriam Raccoon  In December, 1959, three raccoons were seen on Prater Grade and later three were seen in Morfield Canyon near the tunnel. I saw a dead raccoon at the side of the highway 3 mi. WSW of Mancos, 6700 feet, on August 8, 1956. This locality is outside of the Park and not on the Mesa, but is mentioned because it indicates that the raccoon probably occurs along the Mancos River, which forms the eastern boundary of the Park. The raccoon is rare in the area. Some local persons were surprised to hear of its presence; other persons told me that raccoons were present, but rare.   Bassariscus astutus flavus Rhoads Ringtail       _Specimens examined._--Total, 4: MV 7884/507 and 7885/507, trapped      in Balcony House and prepared by D. Watson in 1939; MV 7901/507 and      7902/507, without data.  The cliff dwellings are favored by ringtails and in some years they are common near occupied dwellings in the area of headquarters. Ringtails have been seen in each major habitat within the Park.   Mustela frenata nevadensis Hall Long-tailed Weasel       _Specimens examined._--Total, 5: MV 7891/507, [Male], from the      \"Garden\" [= Indian Cornfield]; [Female], MV 7892/507, also from      the \"Cornfield\"; MV 7859/507, \"Killed by car on Prater Grade\";      [Male], MV 7871/507, in winter pelage, from the North Rim; and      [Male], 83464, killed on the road 1/2 mi. NE of the tunnel,      Morfield Canyon.  C.W. Quaintance in 1935 reported that on January 11, he and Mr. Nelson saw a weasel attack a cottontail, and on March 9, while on the snow plow, Mr. Nelson witnessed another cottontail being killed by a weasel. Weasels in white winter pelage have been recorded in December and January. The brown pelage has been seen as late as November.   Mustela vison energumenos (Bangs) Mink  D.
