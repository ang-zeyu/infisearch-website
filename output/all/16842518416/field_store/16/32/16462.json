The abdomen contains only the rectum and two delicate muscles running into the two appendages, between the bases of which the anus is seated.  _Internal Viscera._--Within the body, in front of the mouth, it was easy to find the stomach (with two pear-shaped cæca at the upper end), running first anteriorly, and then curving back and reaching the anus by a long rectum, difficult to be followed: it appeared, however, to me, that this stomach had more relation to the young Cirripede, of which every part could now generally be traced, than to the larva, with its closed and rudimentary mouth: the fact, however, of its being prolonged to the anus, which is in a different position in the larva and mature state, shows that the stomach serves, at least, as an excretory channel. Besides the stomach, the several muscles already alluded to, and much pulpy and oily matter, the only other internal organs consist of two long, rather thick, gut-formed masses, into the anterior ends of which the cement-ducts running from the prehensile antennæ could be traced. These masses are formed of irregular orange balls, about .001 of an inch in diameter, made up of rather large cells, so to have a grape-like appearance, held together by a transparent pale yellowish substance, but apparently not enclosed in a membrane: these masses lie rather obliquely, and approach each other at their anterior ends; they extend from above the compound eyes, to the cæca of the stomach to which they cohere, but in young specimens, they extend some way beyond the cæca, between the folds of the carapace. The two cement-ducts, at the points where they enter these bodies, expand and are lost; at this point, also, the little orange-coloured masses of cells have the appearance of being broken down into a finer substance. Within the cement-ducts I saw a distinct chord of rather opaque cellular matter. We shall presently see, that these gut-formed masses are the incipient ovaria.  _The Young Cirripede within the Larva._--Several times I succeeded in dissecting off the integuments of the lately-attached larva, and in displaying the young _Lepas australis_ entire. The following description applies to the Cirripede in this state; but for convenience sake, I shall occasionally refer to its condition when a little more advanced. I may premise, and the fact in itself is curious, that the bivalve-like shell of the larva, together with the compound eyes, is first moulted, and some time afterwards, the inner lining of the sack, together with the integuments of the thorax and of the natatory legs: hence, I often found specimens, which externally seemed to have perfected their metamorphoses, but which, within their sacks, retained all the characters of the natatory larva. According to Mr. King, the larva of Lepas throws off its external shell five days after becoming attached. Whilst the young Lepas is closely packed within the larva, the capitulum, as known by the five valves, about equals in length the peduncle. The peduncle occupies the anterior half of the larva; when fully stretched, it becomes narrower and slightly longer than the capitulum; the separation between the capitulum and peduncle is almost arbitrary in the mature animal, and corresponds with no particular line in the larva. Even at this early period, the muscles of the peduncle are quite distinct. No vestige is preserved in the outer integument, of the sternal and dorsal sutures of the larval carapace; but in the corium of the peduncle, three coloured marks which occur near the eyes, and two little curled marks which occur near the acoustic orifices of the larva, are all preserved for some time after maturity. The compound eyes, as we have seen, are attached to apodemes, springing from the sternal surface of the larval carapace, and are consequently cast off with it: whilst the young Cirripede is packed within the larva, the outer integument of its peduncle necessarily forms a deep transverse fold passing over the eyes and apodemes, and this, as we shall presently see, plays an important part in the future position of the animal. The antennæ are not moulted with the carapace, but left cemented to the surface of attachment; their muscles are converted into sinewy fibres, the corium after a short period is absorbed, and they are then preserved in a functionless condition. No trace of the two acoustic sacks can be perceived in the corium of the young Cirripede, excepting the coloured marks above alluded to.  In the young capitulum, the five valves stand some way apart from each other; they are elegant objects under the microscope; they are not calcified, but consist exclusively of chitine; they are rather thick, composed of an outer membrane lined by hexagonal prisms, quite unlike any other membrane in the animal. These valves, which I have called _primordial_ valves, resemble pretty closely in shape the valves of the mature animal; the fork of the carina, however, is indicated only by a slight constriction above the lower end. After the exuviation of the larval integuments, and when calcification commences, the first layer of shell is deposited under, and then round these primordial valves. The latter, in well preserved old specimens, may often be detected on the umbones of the scuta, terga, and carina, but not on the umbones of any other valves.  The _mouth_ seems one of the earliest parts developed: in the youngest larva dissected, I could make out at least points corresponding with each organ; and, at the period when the young Cirripede could be dissected out of its larval envelopes, their general details were quite plain. The labrum, however, had not become bullate. The mouth, as we have seen, is formed under the rudimentary mouth of the larva, and at the same relative spot occupied by the probosciformed mouth of the larva in the second stage. Thus far, in the young Cirripede and larva, there has been no great change in the relative positions of the parts: the rudimentary eyes, however, of the former are developed posteriorly to (or above, as applied to a Cirripede,) the cast-off compound eyes of the larva; but the position of the mouth, of the antennæ, and of the several coloured marks in the corium, prove to demonstration, the correspondence in both of part to part. The case is rather different with what follows.  The _Cirri_ are developed at first of considerable length, so that the young animal may soon provide itself with food; in _Lepas australis_ they are of great length, the sixth pair consisting of seventeen or eighteen obscure segments. The extreme tips of the twenty-four rami of the six pair of cirri, are formed within the twenty-four, corresponding, little, bi-segmental rami of the six pair of natatory legs; but as the cirri are many times longer than these legs, they occupy in a bundle the whole thorax of the larva; no part whatever of the thorax of the Cirripede is formed within the thorax of the larva, but (together with the pedicels of the anterior cirri) within the cephalic cavity. As a consequence of this, the longitudinal axis of the thorax of the young Cirripede lies almost transversely to the longitudinal axis of the larva; and the Cirripede, from this transverse position of its thorax, comes to be, as it were, internally, almost cut in twain, and the sack thus produced. As soon as the young Cirripede is free and can move itself, the cirri are curled up, and the thorax is advanced towards the orifice of the capitulum, its longitudinal axis resuming the position of approximate parallelism to the longitudinal axis of the whole body, which it had in the larval condition. The reader will, perhaps, understand what I mean, if he will look at the mature Cirripede, figured in Pl. IX, fig. 4. In this, he will see that the body or thorax is united to the peduncle only by a small part below the mouth; on the other hand, if he imagines the whole bottom of the body (as high up as the letter _h_) united and blended into the peduncle, he will see the state in which these parts exist in the larva. Now, let him greatly shorten the cirri, so as to resemble the natatory legs of the larva, and then imagine a young Cirripede, with cirri _of full length_, formed within the old one, he will see that the new thorax supporting the cirri will have to be developed in an almost transverse position,--the animal consequently being internally almost separated into twain.  Of the internal organs, whilst the Cirripede is still within the larva, I have already mentioned the stomach with its pair of cæca: from the retracted position of the thorax and rudimentary abdomen, and consequently of the anus, compared with these parts in the larva, the alimentary canal is not above half its former length. There is, as yet, no trace of the filaments supposed by some to act as branchiæ, at the base of the first pair of cirri. Nor could I perceive a trace of the testes or vesiculæ seminales: the penis is represented by a minute, apparently imperforate projection. I have already briefly described the pair of large, gut-formed bodies in the larva, into the anterior ends of which the cement-ducts ran, and evidently derived their slightly opaque, cellular contents. At a very early age, before the young Cirripede can be distinctly made out, the posterior ends of these gut-formed bodies are absorbed, so as not to pass beyond the cæca of the stomach. When the young Cirripede is plainly developed within the larva, these bodies in a relatively reduced condition are still distinct near the cæca, and at the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31558"],["title","A Monograph on the Sub-class Cirripedia (Volume 1 of 2) (#6)"],["body","or anterior end (_i. e._ lower, in the position in which Cirripedes are usually figured), they have branched out into a sheet of delicate inosculating tubes; these could be traced by every stage, until, in the young perfected Cirripede, they filled the peduncle as ordinary ovarian tubes. In the larva, the two gut-formed bodies or incipient ovaria keep of equal thickness from one to the other end, but in the mature Cirripede, the ovarian tubes in the peduncle and the small, glandular, grape-like masses, near the stomach-cæca, are connected only by a delicate tube; this I failed in tracing in specimens in the very immature condition of those now under description.  The larva fixes itself with its sternal surface parallel and close to the surface of attachment, and the antennæ become cemented to it: if the Cirripede, after its metamorphosis had remained in this position, the cirri could not have been exserted, or only against the surface of attachment; but there is a special provision, that the young Cirripede shall immediately assume its proper position at right angles to the position which it held whilst within the larva, namely with its posterior end upwards. This is effected in a singular manner by the exuviation of the great compound eyes, which we have seen are fastened to the outer arms of the double =°UU°=-like, sternal apodemes: these together with the eyes stretch transversely across, and internally far up into, the body of the larva; and, as the whole has to be rejected or moulted, the membrane of the peduncle of the young Cirripede has necessarily to be formed with a wide and deep inward fold, extending transversely across it; this when stretched open, after the exuviation of the larval carapace and apodemes, necessarily causes the sternal side of the peduncle to be longer than the dorsal, and, as a consequence, gives to the young Cirripede its normal position, at right angles to that of the larva when first attached.         *       *       *       *       *  I may here state, that I have examined the larvæ in this the final or perfect stage in four species of Lepas, in _Conchodermavirgata_, _Ibla quadrivalvis_, and, though rather less minutely, in _Balanus balanoides_, and I find all essential points of organisation similar. With the exception of diversities in the proportional sizes of the different parts, and in the patterns on the carapace, the differences, even in the arrangement of the spines on the limbs and antennæ, are less than I should have anticipated.  I have in this abstract treated the metamorphoses at greater length than I should otherwise have done, on account of the great importance of arriving at a correct homological interpretation of the different parts of the mature animal. In Crustacea, according to the ordinary view, there are twenty-one segments; of these I can recognise in the Cirripede, on evidence as good as can generally be obtained, all with the exception of the four terminal abdominal segments; these do not occur in any species known to me, in any stage of its development. If that part of the larva in front of the mouth, bearing the eyes, the prehensile antennæ, and in an earlier stage two pair of antennæ, be formed, as is admitted in all other Crustacea, of three segments, then beyond a doubt, from the absolute correspondence of every part, and even every coloured mark, the peduncle of the Lepadidæ is likewise thus formed. The peduncle being filled by the branching ovarian tubes is no objection to this view, for I am informed on the high authority of Mr. J. D. Dana,[12] that this is the case with the cephalo-thorax in some true Crustaceans, for instance, in Sapphirina. To proceed, the mouth, formed of mandibles, maxillæ, and outer maxillæ, correspond with the fourth, fifth, and sixth segments of the archetype Crustacean. Posteriorly to the mouth, we come, in the larva, to a rather wide interspace without any apparent articulation or organ, and then to the thorax, formed of six segments, bearing the six pair of limbs, of which the first pair differs slightly from the others. The thorax is succeeded by three small segments, differently shaped, with the posterior one alone bearing appendages; these segments, I cannot doubt, from their appearance alone, and from their apparent function of steering the body, are abdominal segments. If this latter view be correct, the thoracic segments are the six posterior ones of the normal seven segments, and there must be two segments missing between the outer maxillæ and first thoracic pair of legs, which latter on this view springs from the ninth segment. Now, in a very singular Cirripede, already alluded to under the name of Proteolepas, the two missing segments are present, the mouth being actually succeeded by eight segments, and these by the three usual abdominal segments,--every segment in the body being as distinct as in an Annelid: hence in Proteolepas, adding the three segments for the mouth and three for the carapace, we have altogether seventeen segments, which, as I stated, is the full number ever observed in any Cirripede, the four missing ones being abdominal, and, I presume, the four terminal segments. That the cavity in which the thorax is lodged, in the larva and therefore in the mature Cirripede, is simply formed by the backward production of the carapace, does not require any discussion. The valves have no homological signification.     [12] This distinguished naturalist has given his opinion in the    ‘American Journal of Science,’ March, 1846, that “the pedicel of    Anatifa corresponds to a pair of antennæ in the young;” although    the peduncle or pedicel is undoubtedly thus terminated, even in    mature individuals, I think it has been shown that it is the    whole of the anterior part of the larva in front of the mouth,    which is directly converted into the peduncle. Professor E.    Forbes, in his Lectures, and Professor Steenstrup, in his    ‘Untersuchungen über das vorkommen des Hermaphroditismus in der    Natur,’ ch. v, have considered the peduncle as a pair of fused    legs. Lovén has taken, judging from a single sentence, the same    view of the homologies of the external parts as I have done; in    his description of _Alepas squalicola_, (Ofversigt of Kongl.    Vetens., &c., Stockholm, 1844, pp. 192-4), he uses the following    words: “Capitis reliquæ partes, ut in Lepadibus semper, in    _pedunculum mutatæ et involucrum_,” &c.; his involucrum is the    same as the capitulum of this work.  As we have just seen that the first pair of natatory legs is borne on the ninth segment of the body, so it must be with the first pair of cirri, which consequently correspond to the outer maxillipods (the two inner pair of maxillipods or pied-machoires being here aborted) of the higher Crustacea, and hence their difference from the five posterior pair, which correspond with the five, ordinary pair of ambulatory legs in these same Crustacea. The part of the body, which I have called the prosoma, that is the protuberant, non-articulated, lower part of the thorax (Pl. IX, fig. 4 _n_), is a special development, either of the ninth segment, bearing the first pair of cirri, or of the segments corresponding with the organs of the mouth. The three abdominal segments of the larva are represented in the mature Cirripede, in the Order containing the Lepadidæ, only by a minute, triangular gusset, let in between the V-shaped tergal arches of the last thoracic segment: in this gusset, small as it is, is seated the anus, and on each side the caudal appendages, often rudimentary and sometimes absent. In another order, I may remark, (including, probably, the Alcippe of Mr. Hancock,) the cirri, of which there are only three pair, are abdominal.  I feel much confidence, that the homologies here given are correct. The cause of their having been generally overlooked arises, I believe, from the peculiar manner, already described, in which the animal, during its last metamorphosis, is internally almost intersected: even for some little time after discovering that the larval antennæ were always embedded in the centre of the surface of attachment, I did not perceive, that this was the anterior end of the whole animal. The accompanying woodcut gives at a glance, a view of the homologies of the external parts: the upper figure (from Milne Edwards) is a Stomapod Crustacean, Leucifer of Vaughan Thompson, and the abdomen, which we know becomes in Cirripedes, after the metamorphosis, rudimentary, and therefore does not fairly enter into the comparison, is given only in faint lines: the lower figure is a mature Lepas, with the antennæ and eyes, which are actually present in the larva, retained and supposed to have gone on growing. All that we externally see of a Cirripede, whether pedunculated or sessile, is the three anterior segments of the head of a Crustacean, with its anterior end permanently cemented to a surface of attachment, and with its posterior end projecting vertically from it.  [Illustration: [_m._--Mouth.]]   CAPITULUM.  I will now proceed to a general description of the different parts and organs in the Lepadidæ. The Capitulum is usually much flattened, but sometimes broadly oval in section. It is generally formed of five or more valves, connected together by very narrow or broad strips of membrane; sometimes the valves are rudimental or absent, when the whole consists of membrane. When the valves are numerous, and they occasionally exceed a hundred in number, they are arranged in whorls, with each valve generally so placed as to cover the interval between the two valves above. Of all the valves, the scuta are the most persistent; then come the terga, and then the carina; the rostrum and latera occur only in Scalpellum and Pollicipes, and in a rudimentary condition in Lithotrya, and, perhaps, in the fossil genus Loricula. The valves are formed sometimes of chitine (as in Ibla and Alepas), but usually of shell, which varies"]]]
