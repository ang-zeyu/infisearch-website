Nonetheless, we-all got to remember, though Miss Magnolia is unquestionably a lady, she is not a woman.\"  Phyllis began to laugh hysterically. \"You're right!\" she gasped. \"I had almost forgotten _she_ was only a tree. And that _it_ is only a little Christmas holly plant that's probably going to die, anyway--they almost always do.\"  \"That's cruel, Phyllis,\" James said, \"and you know it is.\"  \"Do you really think I'm cruel? Are you going to tell the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Vegetables on me? But why am I cruel? I'm giving her the holly. That's what she wants, isn't it? Do you hear that, Miss Magnolia, ma'am? _He_'s all yours. We'll plant _him_ next to you--right away. And I hope _he_ doesn't die. I hope _he_ grows up to make you a good husband.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"She's really quite remarkable,\" Dr. Lakin said to James later that same evening, after the planting ceremonies were over and the rest of the party had gone into the cottage for fresh coffee and more sandwiches and cookies and penuche. \"Quite remarkable. You're a lucky man, Haut.\"  \"Thank you, sir,\" James replied abstractedly. \"I'm sure Phyllis will be pleased to--\"  \"_Phyllis!_ Oh, Mrs. Haut is a very remarkable woman, of course. A handsome, strong girl; she'll make a splendid mother, I'm sure. But I was referring to Miss Magnolia. She's a credit to you, my boy. If for no other reason, your name will go down in the history of our colony as that of the guide and mentor of Miss Magnolia. That's quite a tree you have there.\"  James looked at the dark form of the tree--for the lights had been turned out--silhouetted against the three pale moons and the violet night. \"Yes, she is,\" he said.  \"You're fortunate to be her neighbor ... and her friend.\"  \"Yes, I am.\"  \"Well, I expect I'd better join the rest. Are you coming on in, Jim?\"  \"In a little while, sir. I thought I'd--I wanted to have a word with Magnolia. I won't be long.\"  \"Of course, of course. I'm delighted to see that there is such an excellent relationship between you.... Good night, Miss Magnolia!\" he called.  \"Good night, Dr. Lakin,\" the tree replied, politely enough, but it was obvious that she was preoccupied with her new charge, who stood as close to her as it was possible to plant him and yet allow room for him to grow.         *       *       *       *       *  The door closed. James walked across the lawn until he was quite near Magnolia. \"Maggie,\" he whispered, reaching out to touch her trunk--smooth it was, and hard, but he could feel the vibrant life pulsing inside it. Certainly she was not a plant, not _just_ a plant, even though she was a tree. She was a native of Elysium, neither animal nor vegetable, unique unto the planet, unique unto herself. \"Maggie.\"  \"Yes, Jim. Don't you think his silhouette is so graceful there in the moonlight? He isn't really puny--just frail.\"  \"Maggie, you're not serious about this holly?\"  \"What do you mean?\" And still he didn't have her full attention. Would he ever have it again?  \"Serious about raising him to be your--your--\"  \"Why not, Jim?\"  \"It's impossible.\"  \"Is it? It certainly is far more possible with him, isn't it? That much I understood from your zoology books.\"  \"I suppose so.\"  \"Besides, I have nothing to lose, have I?\"  \"But even if it were possible, wouldn't it be humiliating for you? The creature's mindless!\"  Magnolia's leaves rustled in the darkness. She was laughing--a little bitterly. \"Your Phyllis isn't your intellectual equal, Jim, and yet you say you love her and I suppose you do. Am I not entitled to my follies also?\"  But she couldn't compare Phyllis to a holly plant! It was unreasonable.  \"He may die, of course,\" Magnolia said. \"I've got to be prepared for that. The soil is different, the air is different, the sun is different. But the chances are, if he survives, he'll turn blue. And if he turns blue, who knows what other changes might be brought about? Maybe the plants on your Earth aren't inherently mindless, Jim. Maybe they just didn't have a chance. 'Know ye the land where the cypress and myrtle are emblems of deeds that are done in their clime...?' That land isn't Earth, Jim, so it might just possibly be Elysium.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Again he didn't say anything. What he wanted to say, he had no right to say, so he kept silent.  \"It'll be a chance for me, too, Jim. At least we're both plants, he and I. That gives us a headstart.\"  \"Yes, I suppose it does.\"  \"Intellect doesn't count for much in the propagation of the species. Life goes on without regard for reason, and that's mainly what we're here for, to make sure that life goes on--if we're here for anything at all. Thanks to your kind, Jim, life will continue on this planet; it will certainly be your kind of life--and I hope it can be ours as well.\"  \"Yes,\" he said. \"I hope so, too.\"  And he did, but he wished it didn't have to continue in quite that way. Perhaps it was a trick of the three moons, but the holly plant's leaves seemed to have changed color.. They were no longer green, but almost blue--powder blue.  \"You'd best be getting on to your party, Jim,\" Magnolia said. \"You wouldn't want to be remiss in your duties as host. And please close the door gently when you go inside. The little holly plant's asleep.\"  As he closed the door carefully behind him, he heard a burst of laughter coming from the kitchen, where the guests apparently had assembled--raucous animal laughter--and, rising shrill and noisy above it, Phyllis's company laugh.   --EVELYN E."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31587"],["title","Pursuit (#0)"],["body","Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from Space Science Fiction May 1952.

With almost physical violence, it tightened his throat and knifed at his heart. It darted into his numbed brain, screaming at him.  He was a soft egg in a vast globe of elastic gelatine. Two creatures swam menacingly through the resisting globe toward him. The gelatine fought against them, but they came on. One was near, and made a mystic pass. He screamed at it, and the gelatine grew stronger, throwing them back and away. Suddenly, the creatures drew back. A door opened, and they were gone. But he couldn't let them go. If they escaped....  Hawkes jerked upright in his bed, gasping out a hoarse cry, and the sound of his own voice completed the awakening. He opened his eyes to a murky darkness that was barely relieved by the little night-light. For a second, the nightmare was so strong on his mind that he seemed to see two shadows beyond the door, rushing down the steps. He fought off the illusion, and with straining senses jerked his head around the room. There was nothing there.  Sweat was beading his forehead, and he could feel his pulse racing. He had to get out--had to leave--at once!  He forced the idea aside. There was something cloudy in his mind, but he made reason take over and shove away some of the heavy fear. His fingers found a cigarette and lighted it automatically. The first familiar breath of smoke in his lungs helped. He drew in deeply again, while the tiny sounds in the room became meaningful. There was the insistent ticking of a clock and the soft shushing sound of a tape recorder. He stared at the machine, running on fast rewind, and reversed it to play. But the tape seemed to be blank, or erased.  He crushed the cigarette out on a table-top where other butts lay in disorder. It looked wrong, and his mind leaped up in sudden frantic fear, before he could calm it again. This time, reason echoed his emotional unease.  Hawkes had never smoked before!  But his fingers were already lighting another by old habit. His thoughts lurched, seeking for an answer. There was only a vague sense of something missing--a period of time seemed to have passed. It felt like a long period, but he had no memory of it. There had been the final fight with Irma, when he'd gone stalking out of the house, telling her to get a divorce any way she wanted. He'd opened the mail-box and taken out a letter--a letter from a Professor....  His mind refused to go further. There was only a complete blank after that. But it had been in midwinter, and now he could make out the faint outlines of full-leafed trees against the sky through the window! Months had gone by--and there was no faintest trace of them in his mind.  _They'll get you! You can't escape! Hurry, go, GO!..._  The cigarette fell from his shaking hands, and he was half out of the bed before the rational part of his mind could cut off the fear thoughts. He flipped on the lights, afraid of the dimness. It didn't help. The room was dusty, as if unused for months, and there was a cobweb in one corner by the mirror.  His own face shocked him. It was the same lean, sharp-featured face as ever, under the shock of nondescript, sandy hair. His ears still stuck out too much, and his lips were a trifle too thin. It looked no more than his thirty years; but it was a strained face, now--painted with weeks of fatigue, and grayish with fear, sweat-streaked and with nervous tension in every corded tendon of his throat. His somewhat bony, average-height figure shook visibly as he climbed from the bed.  Hawkes stood fighting himself, trying to get back in the bed, but it was a losing battle. Something seemed to swing up in the corner of the room, as if a shadow moved. He jerked his head toward it, but there was nothing there.  He heard his breath gasping harshly, and his knuckles whitened. There was the taste of blood in the corner of his mouth where he was biting his lips.  _Get out! They'll be here at once! Leave--GO!_         *       *       *       *       *  His hands were already fumbling with his under-clothing. He drew on briefs jerkily, and grabbed for the shirt and suit he had never seen before. He was no longer thinking, now. Blind panic was winning. He thrust his feet into shoes, not bothering with socks.  A slip of paper fell from his coat, with big sprawled Greek letters. He saw only the last line as it fell to the floor--some equation that ended with an infinity sign. Then psi and alpha, connected by a dash. The alpha sign had been scratched out, and something written over it. He tried to reach it, and more papers spilled from his coat pocket. The fear washed up more strongly. He forgot the papers. Even the cigarettes were too far away for him to return to them. His wallet lay on the chair, and he barely grabbed it before the urge overpowered him completely.  The doorknob slipped in his sweating hands, but he managed to turn it. The elevator wasn't at his floor, and he couldn't stop for it. His feet pounded on the stairs, taking him down the three floors to the street at a breakneck pace. The walls of the stairway seemed to be rushing together, as if trying to close the way. He screamed at them, until they were behind, and he was charging out of the front door.  A half-drunken couple was coming in--a fat, older man and a slim girl he barely saw. He hit them, throwing them aside. He jerked from the entrance. Cars were streaming down West End Avenue. He dashed across, paying no attention to them. His rush carried him onto the opposite sidewalk. Then, finally, the blind panic left him, and he was leaning against a building, gasping for breath, and wondering whether his heart could endure the next beat.  Across the street, the fat man he had hit was coming after him. Hawkes gathered himself together to apologize, but the words never came. A second blinding horror hit at him, and his eyes darted up towards the windows of his apartment.  It was only a tiny glow, at first, like a drop from the heart of a sun. Then, before he could more than blink, it spread, until the whole apartment seemed to blaze. A gout of smoke poured from the shattering window, and a dull concussion struck his ears.  The infernally bright flame flickered, leaped outward from the window, and died down almost as quickly as it had come, leaving twisted, half-molten metal where the window frames had been.  They'd almost gotten him! Hawkes felt his legs weaken and quiver, while his eyes remained glued to the spot that had lighted the whole street a second before. They'd tried--but he'd escaped in time.  It must have been a thermite bomb--nothing but thermite could be that hot. He had never imagined that even such a bomb could give so much heat so quickly. Where? In the tape-recorder?  He waited numbly, expecting more fire, but the brief flame seemed to have died out completely. He shook his head, unbelieving, and started to cross the street again, to survey the damage or to join the crowd that was beginning to collect.         *       *       *       *       *  The fear surged up in him again, halting his step as if he'd struck a physical barrier. With it came the sound of an auto-horn, the button held down permanently. His eyes darted down the street, to see a long, gray sedan with old-fashioned running-boards come around the corner on two wheels. Its brakes screeched, and it skidded to a halt beside Hawkes' apartment building.  A slim young man in gray tweeds leaped out of it and came to a stop. He threw back heavy black hair with a toss of his head and ran into the crowd that parted to let him through. Someone began pointing towards Hawkes.  Hawkes tried to slide around the corner without being seen, but a flashlight in the young man's hands pinpointed him. A yell went up.  \"There he goes!\"  His feet sounded hopelessly on the sidewalk as he dashed up toward Broadway, but behind came the sound of others in pursuit, and the shouting was becoming a meaningless babble as others took it up. There was no longer any doubt. Someone was certainly after him--there'd been no time to turn in an alarm over the fire in his apartment. They'd been coming for him before that started.  What hideous crime could he have committed during the period he couldn't remember? Or what spy-ring had encircled him?  He had no time to think of the questions, even. He ducked into the thin swarm of a few people leaving a theater just as the pursuing group rounded the corner, with the slim young man in the lead.  Their cries were enough. Hands reached for him from the theater crowd, and a foot stretched out to trip him up. Terror lent speed to his legs, but he could never outdistance them, as long as others picked up the chase.  A sudden blast of heat struck down, and the air was golden and hazy above him. He staggered sideways, blinded by the glare. The crowd was screaming in fear now, no longer holding him back. He felt the edge of a subway entrance. There was no other choice. He ducked down the steps, while his vision slowly returned, and risked a glance back at the street--just as the whole entrance came down in a wreck of broken wood and metal.  A clap of thundering noise sounded above him, drowning the hoarse screams of the people. The few persons in the station rushed for the fallen entrance, to mill about it crazily, just as a train pulled in. Hawkes started toward it, and then realized his pursuers would suspect that. Whatever frightful weapon had been used against him had back-fired on them--but they'd catch"]]]
