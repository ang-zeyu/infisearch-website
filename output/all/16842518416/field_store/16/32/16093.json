The average client no more wants an original house than he wants an original hat; he wants something he won't feel a fool in. I've often thought, old man, that perhaps the reason why you haven't got on----you don't mind my speaking candidly, do you?\"  \"Not a bit,\" said Ventimore, cheerfully. \"Candour's the cement of friendship. Dab it on.\"  \"Well, I was only going to say that you do yourself no good by all those confoundedly unconventional ideas of yours. If you had your chance to-morrow, it's my belief you'd throw it away by insisting on some fantastic fad or other.\"  \"These speculations are a trifle premature, considering that there doesn't seem the remotest prospect of my ever getting a chance at all.\"  \"I got mine before I'd set up six months,\" said Beevor. \"The great thing, however,\" he went on, with a flavour of personal application, \"is to know how to use it when it _does_ come. Well, I must be off if I mean to catch that one o'clock from Waterloo. You'll see to anything that may come in for me while I'm away, won't you, and let me know? Oh, by the way, the quantity surveyor has just sent in the quantities for that schoolroom at Woodford--do you mind running through them and seeing they're right? And there's the specification for the new wing at Tusculum Lodge--you might draft that some time when you've nothing else to do. You'll find all the papers on my desk. Thanks awfully, old chap.\"  And Beevor hurried back to his own room, where for the next few minutes he could be heard bustling Harrison, the clerk, to make haste; then a hansom was whistled for, there were footsteps down the old stairs, the sounds of a departing vehicle on the uneven stones, and after that silence and solitude.  It was not in Nature to avoid feeling a little envious. Beevor had work to do in the world: even if it chiefly consisted in profaning sylvan retreats by smug or pretentious villas, it was still work which entitled him to consideration and respect in the eyes of all right-minded persons.  And nobody believed in Horace; as yet he had never known the satisfaction of seeing the work of his brain realised in stone and brick and mortar; no building stood anywhere to bear testimony to his existence and capability long after he himself should have passed away.  It was not a profitable train of thought, and, to escape from it, he went into Beevor's room and fetched the documents he had mentioned--at least they would keep him occupied until it was time to go to his club and lunch. He had no sooner settled down to his calculations, however, when he heard a shuffling step on the landing, followed by a knock at Beevor's office-door. \"More work for Beevor,\" he thought; \"what luck the fellow has! I'd better go in and explain that he's just left town on business.\"  But on entering the adjoining room he heard the knocking repeated--this time at his own door; and hastening back to put an end to this somewhat undignified form of hide-and-seek, he discovered that this visitor at least was legitimately his, and was, in fact, no other than Professor Anthony Futvoye himself.  The Professor was standing in the doorway peering short-sightedly through his convex glasses, his head protruded from his loosely-fitting great-coat with an irresistible suggestion of an inquiring tortoise. To Horace his appearance was more welcome than that of the wealthiest client--for why should Sylvia's father take the trouble to pay him this visit unless he still wished to continue the acquaintanceship? It might even be that he was the bearer of some message or invitation.  So, although to an impartial eye the Professor might not seem the kind of elderly gentleman whose society would produce any wild degree of exhilaration, Horace was unfeignedly delighted to see him.  \"Extremely kind of you to come and see me like this, sir,\" he said warmly, after establishing him in the solitary armchair reserved for hypothetical clients.  \"Not at all. I'm afraid your visit to Cottesmore Gardens some time ago was somewhat of a disappointment.\"  \"A disappointment?\" echoed Horace, at a loss to know what was coming next.  \"I refer to the fact--which possibly, however, escaped your notice\"--explained the Professor, scratching his scanty patch of grizzled whisker with a touch of irascibility, \"that I myself was not at home on that occasion.\"  \"Indeed, I was greatly disappointed,\" said Horace, \"though of course I know how much you are engaged. It's all the more good of you to spare time to drop in for a chat just now.\"  \"I've not come to chat, Mr. Ventimore. I never chat. I wanted to see you about a matter which I thought you might be so obliging as to---- But I observe you are busy--probably too busy to attend to such a small affair.\"  It was clear enough now; the Professor was going to build, and had decided--could it be at Sylvia's suggestion?--to entrust the work to him! But he contrived to subdue any self-betraying eagerness, and reply (as he could with perfect truth) that he had nothing on hand just then which he could not lay aside, and that if the Professor would let him know what he required, he would take it up at once.  \"So much the better,\" said the Professor; \"so much the better. Both my wife and daughter declared that it was making far too great a demand upon your good nature; but, as I told them, 'I am much mistaken,' I said, 'if Mr. Ventimore's practice is so extensive that he cannot leave it for one afternoon----'\"  Evidently it was not a house. Could he be needed to escort them somewhere that afternoon? Even that was more than he had hoped for a few minutes since. He hastened to repeat that he was perfectly free that afternoon.  \"In that case,\" said the Professor, beginning to fumble in all his pockets--was he searching for a note in Sylvia's handwriting?--\"in that case, you will be conferring a real favour on me if you can make it convenient to attend a sale at Hammond's Auction Rooms in Covent Garden, and just bid for one or two articles on my behalf.\"  Whatever disappointment Ventimore felt, it may be said to his credit that he allowed no sign of it to appear. \"Of course I'll go, with pleasure,\" he said, \"if I can be of any use.\"  \"I knew I shouldn't come to you in vain,\" said the Professor. \"I remembered your wonderful good nature, sir, in accompanying my wife and daughter on all sorts of expeditions in the blazing hot weather we had at St. Luc--when you might have remained quietly at the hotel with me. Not that I should trouble you now, only I have to lunch at the Oriental Club, and I've an appointment afterwards to examine and report on a recently-discovered inscribed cylinder for the Museum, which will fully occupy the rest of the afternoon, so that it's physically impossible for me to go to Hammond's myself, and I strongly object to employing a broker when I can avoid it. Where did I put that catalogue?... Ah, here it is. This was sent to me by the executors of my old friend, General Collingham, who died the other day. I met him at Nakada when I was out excavating some years ago. He was something of a collector in his way, though he knew very little about it, and, of course, was taken in right and left. Most of his things are downright rubbish, but there are just a few lots that are worth securing, at a reasonable figure, by some one who knew what he was about.\"  \"But, my dear Professor,\" remonstrated Horace, not relishing this responsibility, \"I'm afraid I'm as likely as not to pick up some of the rubbish. I've no special knowledge of Oriental curios.\"  \"At St. Luc,\" said the Professor, \"you impressed me as having, for an amateur, an exceptionally accurate and comprehensive acquaintance with Egyptian and Arabian art from the earliest period.\" (If this were so, Horace could only feel with shame what a fearful humbug he must have been.) \"However, I've no wish to lay too heavy a burden on you, and, as you will see from this catalogue, I have ticked off the lots in which I am chiefly interested, and made a note of the limit to which I am prepared to bid, so you'll have no difficulty.\"  \"Very well,\" said Horace; \"I'll go straight to Covent Garden, and slip out and get some lunch later on.\"  \"Well, perhaps, if you don't mind. The lots I have marked seem to come on at rather frequent intervals, but don't let that consideration deter you from getting your lunch, and if you _should_ miss anything by not being on the spot, why, it's of no consequence, though I don't say it mightn't be a pity. In any case, you won't forget to mark what each lot fetches, and perhaps you wouldn't mind dropping me a line when you return the catalogue--or stay, could you look in some time after dinner this evening, and let me know how you got on?--that would be better.\"  Horace thought it would be decidedly better, and undertook to call and render an account of his stewardship that evening. There remained the question of a deposit, should one or more of the lots be knocked down to him; and, as he was obliged to own that he had not so much as ten pounds about him at that particular moment, the Professor extracted a note for that amount from his case, and handed it to him with the air of a benevolent person relieving a deserving object. \"Don't exceed my limits,\" he said, \"for I can't afford more just now; and mind you give Hammond your own name, not mine. If the dealers get to know I'm after the things, they'll run you up. And now, I don't think I need detain you any longer, especially as time is running on. I'm sure I can trust you to do the best you can for me. Till this evening, then.\"  A few minutes later Horace was driving up to Covent Garden behind the best-looking horse he could pick out.

After all, he was Sylvia's parent.  \"Even with _my_ luck,\" he was thinking, \"I ought to succeed in getting at least one or two of the lots he's marked; and if I can only please him, something may come of it.\"  And in this sanguine mood Horace entered Messrs. Hammond's well-known auction rooms.     CHAPTER II  A CHEAP LOT   In spite of the fact that it was the luncheon hour when Ventimore reached Hammond's Auction Rooms, he found the big, skylighted gallery where the sale of the furniture and effects of the late General Collingham was proceeding crowded to a degree which showed that the deceased officer had some reputation as a _connoisseur_.  The narrow green baize tables below the auctioneer's rostrum were occupied by professional dealers, one or two of them women, who sat, paper and pencil in hand, with much the same air of apparent apathy and real vigilance that may be noticed in the Casino at Monte Carlo. Around them stood a decorous and businesslike crowd, mostly dealers, of various types. On a magisterial-looking bench sat the auctioneer, conducting the sale with a judicial impartiality and dignity which forbade him, even in his most laudatory comments, the faintest accent of enthusiasm.  The October sunshine, striking through the glazed roof, re-gilded the tarnished gas-stars, and suffused the dusty atmosphere with palest gold. But somehow the utter absence of excitement in the crowd, the calm, methodical tone of the auctioneer, and the occasional mournful cry of \"Lot here, gentlemen!\" from the porter when any article was too large to move, all served to depress Ventimore's usually mercurial spirits.  For all Horace knew, the collection as a whole might be of little value, but it very soon became clear that others besides Professor Futvoye had singled out such gems as there were, also that the Professor had considerably under-rated the prices they were likely to fetch.  Ventimore made his bids with all possible discretion, but time after time he found the competition for some perforated mosque lantern, engraved ewer, or ancient porcelain tile so great that his limit was soon reached, and his sole consolation was that the article eventually changed hands for sums which were very nearly double the Professor's estimate.  Several dealers and brokers, despairing of a bargain that day, left, murmuring profanities; most of those who remained ceased to take a serious interest in the proceedings, and consoled themselves with cheap witticisms at every favourable occasion.  The sale dragged slowly on, and, what with continual disappointment and want of food, Horace began to feel so weary that he was glad, as the crowd thinned, to get a seat at one of the green baize tables, by which time the skylights had already changed from livid grey to slate colour in the deepening dusk.  A couple of meek Burmese Buddhas had just been put up, and bore the indignity of being knocked down for nine-and-sixpence the pair with dreamy, inscrutable simpers; Horace only waited for the final lot marked by the Professor--an old Persian copper bowl, inlaid with silver and engraved round the rim with an inscription from Hafiz.  The limit to which he was authorised to go was two pounds ten; but, so desperately anxious was Ventimore not to return empty-handed, that he had made up his mind to bid an extra sovereign if necessary, and say nothing about it.  However, the bowl was put up, and the bidding soon rose to three pounds ten, four pounds, four pounds ten, five pounds, five guineas, for which last sum it was acquired by a bearded man on Horace's right, who immediately began to regard his purchase with a more indulgent eye.  Ventimore had done his best, and failed; there was no reason now why he should stay a moment longer--and yet he sat on, from sheer fatigue and disinclination to move.  \"Now we come to Lot 254, gentlemen,\" he heard the auctioneer saying, mechanically; \"a capital Egyptian mummy-case in fine con---- No, I beg pardon, I'm wrong. This is an article which by some mistake has been omitted from the catalogue, though it ought to have been in it. Everything on sale to-day, gentlemen, belonged to the late General Collingham. We'll call this No. 253_a_. Antique brass bottle. Very curious.\"  One of the porters carried the bottle in between the tables, and set it down before the dealers at the farther end with a tired nonchalance.  It was an old, squat, pot-bellied vessel, about two feet high, with a long thick neck, the mouth of which was closed by a sort of metal stopper or cap; there was no visible decoration on its sides, which were rough and pitted by some incrustation that had formed on them, and been partially scraped off. As a piece of _bric-à-brac_ it certainly possessed few attractions, and there was a marked tendency to \"guy\" it among the more frivolous brethren.  \"What do you call this, sir?\" inquired one of the auctioneer, with the manner of a cheeky boy trying to get a rise out of his form-master. \"Is it as 'unique' as the others?\"  \"You're as well able to judge as I am,\" was the guarded reply. \"Any one can see for himself it's not modern rubbish.\"  \"Make a pretty little ornament for the mantelpiece!\" remarked a wag.  \"Is the top made to unscrew, or what, sir?\" asked a third. \"Seems fixed on pretty tight.\"  \"I can't say. Probably it has not been removed for some time.\"  \"It's a goodish weight,\" said the chief humorist, after handling it. \"What's inside of it, sir--sardines?\"  \"I don't represent it as having anything inside it,\" said the auctioneer. \"If you want to know my opinion, I think there's money in it.\"  \"'Ow much?\"  \"Don't misunderstand me, gentlemen. When I say I consider there's money in it, I'm not alluding to its contents. I've no reason to believe that it contains anything. I'm merely suggesting the thing itself may be worth more than it looks.\"  \"Ah, it might be _that_ without 'urting itself!\"  \"Well, well, don't let us waste time. Look upon it as a pure speculation, and make me an offer for it, some of you. Come.\"  \"Tuppence-'ap'ny!\" cried the comic man, affecting to brace himself for a mighty effort.  \"Pray be serious, gentlemen. We want to get on, you know. Anything to make a start. Five shillings? It's not the value of the metal, but I'll take the bid. Six. Look at it well. It's not an article you come across every day of your lives.\"  The bottle was still being passed round with disrespectful raps and slaps, and it had now come to Ventimore's right-hand neighbour, who scrutinised it carefully, but made no bid.  \"That's all _right_, you know,\" he whispered in Horace's ear. \"That's good stuff, that is. If I was you, I'd _'ave_ that.\"  \"Seven shillings--eight--nine bid for it over there in the corner,\" said the auctioneer.  \"If you think it's so good, why don't you have it yourself?\" Horace asked his neighbour.  \"Me? Oh, well, it ain't exactly in my line, and getting this last lot pretty near cleaned me out. I've done for to-day, I 'ave. All the same, it is a curiosity; dunno as I've seen a brass vawse just that shape before, and it's genuine old, though all these fellers are too ignorant to know the value of it. So I don't mind giving you the tip.\"  Horace rose, the better to examine the top. As far as he could make out in the flickering light of one of the gas-stars, which the auctioneer had just ordered to be lit, there were half-erased scratches and triangular marks on the cap that might possibly be an inscription. If so, might there not be the means here of regaining the Professor's favour, which he felt that, as it was, he should probably forfeit, justly or not, by his ill-success?  He could hardly spend the Professor's money on it, since it was not in the catalogue, and he had no authority to bid for it, but he had a few shillings of his own to spare. Why not bid for it on his own account as long as he could afford to do so? If he were outbid, as usual, it would not particularly matter.  \"Thirteen shillings,\" the auctioneer was saying, in his dispassionate tones. Horace caught his eye, and slightly raised his catalogue, while another man nodded at the same time. \"Fourteen in two places.\" Horace raised his catalogue again. \"I won't go beyond fifteen,\" he thought.  \"Fifteen. It's _against_ you, sir. Any advance on fifteen? Sixteen--this very quaint old Oriental bottle going for only sixteen shillings.  \"After all,\" thought Horace, \"I don't mind anything under a pound for it.\" And he bid seventeen shillings. \"Eighteen,\" cried his rival, a short, cheery, cherub-faced little dealer, whose neighbours adjured him to \"sit quiet like a good little boy and not waste his pocket-money.\"  \"Nineteen!\" said Horace. \"Pound!\" answered the cherubic man.  \"A pound only bid for this grand brass vessel,\" said the auctioneer, indifferently. \"All done at a pound?\"  Horace thought another shilling or two would not ruin him, and nodded.  \"A guinea. For the last time. You'll _lose_ it, sir,\" said the auctioneer to the little man.  \"Go on, Tommy. Don't you be beat. Spring another bob on it, Tommy,\" his friends advised him ironically; but Tommy shook his head, with the air of a man who knows when to draw the line. \"One guinea--and that's not half its value! Gentleman on my left,\" said the auctioneer, more in sorrow than in anger--and the brass bottle became Ventimore's property.  He paid for it, and, since he could hardly walk home nursing a large metal bottle without attracting an inconvenient amount of attention, directed that it should be sent to his lodgings at Vincent Square.  But when he was out in the fresh air, walking westward to his club, he found himself wondering more and more what could have possessed him to throw away a guinea--when he had few enough for legitimate expenses--on an article of such exceedingly problematical value.
