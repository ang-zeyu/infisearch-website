OVER THE MOUNTAIN   I inscribe this history to ANDREW LANG in token of personal regard and of my sincere admiration for his learning and his works           SHE      INTRODUCTION         In giving to the world the record of what, looked at as an       adventure only, is I suppose one of the most wonderful and       mysterious experiences ever undergone by mortal men, I feel it       incumbent on me to explain what my exact connection with it is.       And so I may as well say at once that I am not the narrator but       only the editor of this extraordinary history, and then go on to       tell how it found its way into my hands.        Some years ago I, the editor, was stopping with a friend, “_vir       doctissimus et amicus meus_,” at a certain University, which for       the purposes of this history we will call Cambridge, and was one       day much struck with the appearance of two persons whom I saw       going arm-in-arm down the street. One of these gentlemen was I       think, without exception, the handsomest young fellow I have ever       seen. He was very tall, very broad, and had a look of power and a       grace of bearing that seemed as native to him as it is to a wild       stag. In addition his face was almost without flaw—a good face as       well as a beautiful one, and when he lifted his hat, which he did       just then to a passing lady, I saw that his head was covered with       little golden curls growing close to the scalp.        “Good gracious!” I said to my friend, with whom I was walking,       “why, that fellow looks like a statue of Apollo come to life.       What a splendid man he is!”        “Yes,” he answered, “he is the handsomest man in the University,       and one of the nicest too. They call him ‘the Greek god’; but       look at the other one, he’s Vincey’s (that’s the god’s name)       guardian, and supposed to be full of every kind of information.       They call him ‘Charon.’” I looked, and found the older man quite       as interesting in his way as the glorified specimen of humanity       at his side. He appeared to be about forty years of age, and was       I think as ugly as his companion was handsome. To begin with, he       was shortish, rather bow-legged, very deep chested, and with       unusually long arms. He had dark hair and small eyes, and the       hair grew right down on his forehead, and his whiskers grew right       up to his hair, so that there was uncommonly little of his       countenance to be seen. Altogether he reminded me forcibly of a       gorilla, and yet there was something very pleasing and genial       about the man’s eye. I remember saying that I should like to know       him.        “All right,” answered my friend, “nothing easier. I know Vincey;       I’ll introduce you,” and he did, and for some minutes we stood       chatting—about the Zulu people, I think, for I had just returned       from the Cape at the time. Presently, however, a stoutish lady,       whose name I do not remember, came along the pavement,       accompanied by a pretty fair-haired girl, and these two Mr.       Vincey, who clearly knew them well, at once joined, walking off       in their company. I remember being rather amused because of the       change in the expression of the elder man, whose name I       discovered was Holly, when he saw the ladies advancing. He       suddenly stopped short in his talk, cast a reproachful look at       his companion, and, with an abrupt nod to myself, turned and       marched off alone across the street. I heard afterwards that he       was popularly supposed to be as much afraid of a woman as most       people are of a mad dog, which accounted for his precipitate       retreat. I cannot say, however, that young Vincey showed much       aversion to feminine society on this occasion. Indeed I remember       laughing, and remarking to my friend at the time that he was not       the sort of man whom it would be desirable to introduce to the       lady one was going to marry, since it was exceedingly probable       that the acquaintance would end in a transfer of her affections.       He was altogether too good-looking, and, what is more, he had       none of that consciousness and conceit about him which usually       afflicts handsome men, and makes them deservedly disliked by       their fellows.        That same evening my visit came to an end, and this was the last       I saw or heard of “Charon” and “the Greek god” for many a long       day. Indeed, I have never seen either of them from that hour to       this, and do not think it probable that I shall. But a month ago       I received a letter and two packets, one of manuscript, and on       opening the first found that it was signed by “Horace Holly,” a       name that at the moment was not familiar to me. It ran as       follows:—        “—— College, Cambridge, May 1, 18—        “My dear Sir,—You will be surprised, considering the very slight       nature of our acquaintance, to get a letter from me. Indeed, I       think I had better begin by reminding you that we once met, now       some five years ago, when I and my ward Leo Vincey were       introduced to you in the street at Cambridge. To be brief and       come to my business. I have recently read with much interest a       book of yours describing a Central African adventure. I take it       that this book is partly true, and partly an effort of the       imagination. However this may be, it has given me an idea. It       happens, how you will see in the accompanying manuscript (which       together with the Scarab, the ‘Royal Son of the Sun,’ and the       original sherd, I am sending to you by hand), that my ward, or       rather my adopted son Leo Vincey and myself have recently passed       through a real African adventure, of a nature so much more       marvellous than the one which you describe, that to tell the       truth I am almost ashamed to submit it to you lest you should       disbelieve my tale. You will see it stated in this manuscript       that I, or rather we, had made up our minds not to make this       history public during our joint lives. Nor should we alter our       determination were it not for a circumstance which has recently       arisen. We are for reasons that, after perusing this manuscript,       you may be able to guess, going away again this time to Central       Asia where, if anywhere upon this earth, wisdom is to be found,       and we anticipate that our sojourn there will be a long one.       Possibly we shall not return. Under these altered conditions it       has become a question whether we are justified in withholding       from the world an account of a phenomenon which we believe to be       of unparalleled interest, merely because our private life is       involved, or because we are afraid of ridicule and doubt being       cast upon our statements. I hold one view about this matter, and       Leo holds another, and finally, after much discussion, we have       come to a compromise, namely, to send the history to you, giving       you full leave to publish it if you think fit, the only       stipulation being that you shall disguise our real names, and as       much concerning our personal identity as is consistent with the       maintenance of the _bona fides_ of the narrative.        “And now what am I to say further? I really do not know beyond       once more repeating that everything is described in the       accompanying manuscript exactly as it happened. As regards _She_       herself I have nothing to add. Day by day we gave greater       occasion to regret that we did not better avail ourselves of our       opportunities to obtain more information from that marvellous       woman. Who was she? How did she first come to the Caves of Kôr,       and what was her real religion? We never ascertained, and now,       alas! we never shall, at least not yet. These and many other       questions arise in my mind, but what is the good of asking them       now?        “Will you undertake the task? We give you complete freedom, and       as a reward you will, we believe, have the credit of presenting       to the world the most wonderful history, as distinguished from       romance, that its records can show. Read the manuscript (which I       have copied out fairly for your benefit), and let me know.        “Believe me, very truly yours, “L. Horace Holly.[1]        “P.S.—Of course, if any profit results from the sale of the       writing should you care to undertake its publication, you can do       what you like with it, but if there is a loss I will leave       instructions with my lawyers, Messrs. Geoffrey and Jordan, to       meet it. We entrust the sherd, the scarab, and the parchments to       your keeping, till such time as we demand them back again. —L. H.       H.”   [1] This name is varied throughout in accordance with the writer’s  request.—Editor.        This letter, as may be imagined, astonished me considerably, but       when I came to look at the MS., which the pressure of other work       prevented me from doing for a fortnight, I was still more       astonished, as"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3155"],["title","She (#1)"],["body"," think the reader will be also, and at once made       up my mind to press on with the matter. I wrote to this effect to       Mr. Holly, but a week afterwards received a letter from that       gentleman’s lawyers, returning my own, with the information that       their client and Mr. Leo Vincey had already left this country for       Thibet, and they did not at present know their address.        Well, that is all I have to say. Of the history itself the reader       must judge. I give it him, with the exception of a very few       alterations, made with the object of concealing the identity of       the actors from the general public, exactly as it came to me.       Personally I have made up my mind to refrain from comments. At       first I was inclined to believe that this history of a woman on       whom, clothed in the majesty of her almost endless years, the       shadow of Eternity itself lay like the dark wing of Night, was       some gigantic allegory of which I could not catch the meaning.       Then I thought that it might be a bold attempt to portray the       possible results of practical immortality, informing the       substance of a mortal who yet drew her strength from Earth, and       in whose human bosom passions yet rose and fell and beat as in       the undying world around her the winds and the tides rise and       fall and beat unceasingly. But as I went on I abandoned that idea       also. To me the story seems to bear the stamp of truth upon its       face. Its explanation I must leave to others, and with this       slight preface, which circumstances make necessary, I introduce       the world to Ayesha and the Caves of Kôr.—The Editor.        P.S.—There is on consideration one circumstance that, after a       reperusal of this history, struck me with so much force that I       cannot resist calling the attention of the reader to it. He will       observe that so far as we are made acquainted with him there       appears to be nothing in the character of Leo Vincey which in the       opinion of most people would have been likely to attract an       intellect so powerful as that of Ayesha. He is not even, at any       rate to my view, particularly interesting. Indeed, one might       imagine that Mr. Holly would under ordinary circumstances have       easily outstripped him in the favour of _She_. Can it be that       extremes meet, and that the very excess and splendour of her mind       led her by means of some strange physical reaction to worship at       the shrine of matter? Was that ancient Kallikrates nothing but a       splendid animal loved for his hereditary Greek beauty? Or is the       true explanation what I believe it to be—namely, that Ayesha,       seeing further than we can see, perceived the germ and       smouldering spark of greatness which lay hid within her lover’s       soul, and well knew that under the influence of her gift of life,       watered by her wisdom, and shone upon with the sunshine of her       presence, it would bloom like a flower and flash out like a star,       filling the world with light and fragrance?        Here also I am not able to answer, but must leave the reader to       form his own judgment on the facts before him, as detailed by Mr.       Holly in the following pages.     I. MY VISITOR         There are some events of which each circumstance and surrounding       detail seems to be graven on the memory in such fashion that we       cannot forget it, and so it is with the scene that I am about to       describe. It rises as clearly before my mind at this moment as       though it had happened but yesterday.        It was in this very month something over twenty years ago that I,       Ludwig Horace Holly, was sitting one night in my rooms at       Cambridge, grinding away at some mathematical work, I forget       what. I was to go up for my fellowship within a week, and was       expected by my tutor and my college generally to distinguish       myself. At last, wearied out, I flung my book down, and, going to       the mantelpiece, took down a pipe and filled it. There was a       candle burning on the mantelpiece, and a long, narrow glass at       the back of it; and as I was in the act of lighting the pipe I       caught sight of my own countenance in the glass, and paused to       reflect. The lighted match burnt away till it scorched my       fingers, forcing me to drop it; but still I stood and stared at       myself in the glass, and reflected.        “Well,” I said aloud, at last, “it is to be hoped that I shall be       able to do something with the inside of my head, for I shall       certainly never do anything by the help of the outside.”        This remark will doubtless strike anybody who reads it as being       slightly obscure, but I was in reality alluding to my physical       deficiencies. Most men of twenty-two are endowed at any rate with       some share of the comeliness of youth, but to me even this was       denied. Short, thick-set, and deep-chested almost to deformity,       with long sinewy arms, heavy features, deep-set grey eyes, a low       brow half overgrown with a mop of thick black hair, like a       deserted clearing on which the forest had once more begun to       encroach; such was my appearance nearly a quarter of a century       ago, and such, with some modification, it is to this day. Like       Cain, I was branded—branded by Nature with the stamp of abnormal       ugliness, as I was gifted by Nature with iron and abnormal       strength and considerable intellectual powers. So ugly was I that       the spruce young men of my College, though they were proud enough       of my feats of endurance and physical prowess, did not even care       to be seen walking with me. Was it wonderful that I was       misanthropic and sullen? Was it wonderful that I brooded and       worked alone, and had no friends—at least, only one? I was set       apart by Nature to live alone, and draw comfort from her breast,       and hers only. Women hated the sight of me. Only a week before I       had heard one call me a “monster” when she thought I was out of       hearing, and say that I had converted her to the monkey theory.       Once, indeed, a woman pretended to care for me, and I lavished       all the pent-up affection of my nature upon her. Then money that       was to have come to me went elsewhere, and she discarded me. I       pleaded with her as I have never pleaded with any living creature       before or since, for I was caught by her sweet face, and loved       her; and in the end by way of answer she took me to the glass,       and stood side by side with me, and looked into it.        “Now,” she said, “if I am Beauty, who are you?” That was when I       was only twenty.        And so I stood and stared, and felt a sort of grim satisfaction       in the sense of my own loneliness; for I had neither father, nor       mother, nor brother; and as I did so there came a knock at my       door.        I listened before I went to open it, for it was nearly twelve       o’clock at night, and I was in no mood to admit any stranger. I       had but one friend in the College, or, indeed, in the       world—perhaps it was he.        Just then the person outside the door coughed, and I hastened to       open it, for I knew the cough.        A tall man of about thirty, with the remains of great personal       beauty, came hurrying in, staggering beneath the weight of a       massive iron box which he carried by a handle with his right       hand. He placed the box upon the table, and then fell into an       awful fit of coughing. He coughed and coughed till his face       became quite purple, and at last he sank into a chair and began       to spit up blood. I poured out some whisky into a tumbler, and       gave it to him. He drank it, and seemed better; though his better       was very bad indeed.        “Why did you keep me standing there in the cold?” he asked       pettishly. “You know the draughts are death to me.”        “I did not know who it was,” I answered. “You are a late       visitor.”        “Yes; and I verily believe it is my last visit,” he answered,       with a ghastly attempt at a smile. “I am done for, Holly. I am       done for. I do not believe that I shall see to-morrow.”        “Nonsense!” I said. “Let me go for a doctor.”        He waved me back imperiously with his hand. “It is sober sense;       but I want no doctors. I have studied medicine and I know all       about it. No doctors can help me. My last hour has come! For a       year past I have only lived by a miracle. Now listen to me as you       have never listened to anybody before; for you will not have the       opportunity of getting me to repeat my words. We have been       friends for two years; now tell me how much do you know about       me?”        “I know that you are rich, and have had a fancy to come to       College long after the age that most men leave it. I know that       you have been married, and that your wife died; and that you have       been the best, indeed almost the only friend I ever had.”        “Did you know that I have a son?”        “No.”        “I have. He is five years old. He cost me his mother’s life, and       I have never been able to bear to look upon his face in       consequence. Holly, if you will accept the trust, I am going to       leave you that boy’s sole guardian.”        I sprang almost out of my chair. “_Me!_” I said.  “Yes, you. I have not studied you for two years for nothing. I have known for some time that I could not last, and since I realised the fact I have been searching for some one to whom I could confide the boy and this,” and he tapped the iron box. “You are the man, Holly; for, like a rugged tree, you are hard and sound at core. Listen; the boy will be the only representative of one of the most ancient families in the world, that is, so far as families can be traced. You "]]]
