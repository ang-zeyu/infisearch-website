Cheeses have I and dried fish; take what ye will thereof.  But as to my neat and sheep, if ye have sore need of any, and will have them, I may not say you nay: but I pray you if ye may do without them, not to take my milch-beasts or their engenderers; for, as ye have heard me say, the Bear-folk have been here but of late, and they have had of me all I might spare: but now let me tell you, if ye long after flesh-meat, that there is venison of hart and hind, yea, and of buck and doe, to be had on this plain, and about the little woods at the feet of the rock-wall yonder: neither are they exceeding wild; for since I may not take them, I scare them not, and no other man do they see to hurt them; for the Bear- folk come straight to my house, and fare straight home thence.  But I will lead you the nighest way to where the venison is easiest to be gotten.  As to the wares in your ship, if ye will give me aught I will take it with a good will; and chiefly if ye have a fair knife or two and a roll of linen cloth, that were a good refreshment to me.  But in any case what I have to give is free to you and welcome.\"  The shipmaster laughed: \"Friend,\" said he, \"we can thee mickle thanks for all that thou biddest us.  And wot well that we be no lifters or sea-thieves to take thy livelihood from thee.  So to-morrow, if thou wilt, we will go with thee and upraise the hunt, and meanwhile we will come aland, and walk on the green grass, and water our ship with thy good fresh water.\"  So the old carle went back to his house to make them ready what cheer he might, and the shipmen, who were twenty and one, all told, what with the mariners and Arnold and Walter's servants, went ashore, all but two who watched the ship and abode their turn.  They went well-weaponed, for both the master and Walter deemed wariness wisdom, lest all might not be so good as it seemed.  They took of their sail-cloths ashore and tilted them in on the meadow betwixt the house and the ship, and the carle brought them what he had for their avail, of fresh fruits, and cheeses, and milk, and wine, and cyder, and honey, and there they feasted nowise ill, and were right fain.     CHAPTER VI: THE OLD MAN TELLS WALTER OF HIMSELF.  WALTER SEES A SHARD IN THE CLIFF-WALL   But when they had done their meat and drink the master and the shipmen went about the watering of the ship, and the others strayed off along the meadow, so that presently Walter was left alone with the carle, and fell to speech with him and said: \"Father, meseemeth thou shouldest have some strange tale to tell, and as yet we have asked thee of nought save meat for our bellies: now if I ask thee concerning thy life, and how thou camest hither, and abided here, wilt thou tell me aught?\"  The old man smiled on him and said: \"Son, my tale were long to tell; and mayhappen concerning much thereof my memory should fail me; and withal there is grief therein, which I were loth to awaken: nevertheless if thou ask, I will answer as I may, and in any case will tell thee nought save the truth.\"  Said Walter: \"Well then, hast thou been long here?\"  \"Yea,\" said the carle, \"since I was a young man, and a stalwarth knight.\"  Said Walter: \"This house, didst thou build it, and raise these garths, and plant orchard and vineyard, and gather together the neat and the sheep, or did some other do all this for thee?\"  Said the carle: \"I did none of all this; there was one here before me, and I entered into his inheritance, as though this were a lordly manor, with a fair castle thereon, and all well stocked and plenished.\"  Said Walter: \"Didst thou find thy foregoer alive here?\"  \"Yea,\" said the elder, \"yet he lived but for a little while after I came to him.\"  He was silent a while, and then he said: \"I slew him: even so would he have it, though I bade him a better lot.\"  Said Walter: \"Didst thou come hither of thine own will?\"  \"Mayhappen,\" said the carle; \"who knoweth?  Now have I no will to do either this or that.  It is wont that maketh me do, or refrain.\"  Said Walter: \"Tell me this; why didst thou slay the man? did he any scathe to thee?\"  Said the elder: \"When I slew him, I deemed that he was doing me all scathe: but now I know that it was not so.  Thus it was: I would needs go where he had been before, and he stood in the path against me; and I overthrew him, and went on the way I would.\"  \"What came thereof?\" said Walter.  \"Evil came of it,\" said the carle.  Then was Walter silent a while, and the old man spake nothing; but there came a smile in his face that was both sly and somewhat sad.  Walter looked on him and said: \"Was it from hence that thou wouldst go that road?\"  \"Yea,\" said the carle.  Said Walter: \"And now wilt thou tell me what that road was; whither it went and whereto it led, that thou must needs wend it, though thy first stride were over a dead man?\"  \"I will not tell thee,\" said the carle.  Then they held their peace, both of them, and thereafter got on to other talk of no import.  So wore the day till night came; and they slept safely, and on the morrow after they had broken their fast, the more part of them set off with the carle to the hunting, and they went, all of them, a three hours' faring towards the foot of the cliffs, which was all grown over with coppice, hazel and thorn, with here and there a big oak or ash-tree; there it was, said the old man, where the venison was most and best.  Of their hunting need nought be said, saving that when the carle had put them on the track of the deer and shown them what to do, he came back again with Walter, who had no great lust for the hunting, and sorely longed to have some more talk with the said carle.  He for his part seemed nought loth thereto, and so led Walter to a mound or hillock amidst the clear of the plain, whence all was to be seen save where the wood covered it; but just before where they now lay down there was no wood, save low bushes, betwixt them and the rock-wall; and Walter noted that whereas otherwhere, save in one place whereto their eyes were turned, the cliffs seemed wellnigh or quite sheer, or indeed in some places beetling over, in that said place they fell away from each other on either side; and before this sinking was a slope or scree, that went gently up toward the sinking of the wall.  Walter looked long and earnestly at this place, and spake nought, till the carle said: \"What! thou hast found something before thee to look on.  What is it then?\"  Quoth Walter: \"Some would say that where yonder slopes run together up towards that sinking in the cliff-wall there will be a pass into the country beyond.\"  The carle smiled and said: \"Yea, son; nor, so saying, would they err; for that is the pass into the Bear-country, whereby those huge men come down to chaffer with me.\"  \"Yea,\" said Walter; and therewith he turned him a little, and scanned the rock-wall, and saw how a few miles from that pass it turned somewhat sharply toward the sea, narrowing the plain much there, till it made a bight, the face whereof looked wellnigh north, instead of west, as did the more part of the wall.  And in the midst of that northern-looking bight was a dark place which seemed to Walter like a downright shard in the cliff.  For the face of the wall was of a bleak grey, and it was but little furrowed.  So then Walter spake: \"Lo, old friend, there yonder is again a place that meseemeth is a pass; whereunto doth that one lead?\"  And he pointed to it: but the old man did not follow the pointing of his finger, but, looking down on the ground, answered confusedly, and said:  \"Maybe: I wot not.  I deem that it also leadeth into the Bear-country by a roundabout road.  It leadeth into the far land.\"  Walter answered nought: for a strange thought had come uppermost in his mind, that the carle knew far more than he would say of that pass, and that he himself might be led thereby to find the wondrous three.  He caught his breath hardly, and his heart knocked against his ribs; but he refrained from speaking for a long while; but at last he spake in a sharp hard voice, which he scarce knew for his own: \"Father, tell me, I adjure thee by God and All-hallows, was it through yonder shard that the road lay, when thou must needs make thy first stride over a dead man?\"  The old man spake not a while, then he raised his head, and looked Walter full in the eyes, and said in a steady voice: \"NO, IT WAS NOT.\" Thereafter they sat looking at each other a while; but at last Walter turned his eyes away, but knew not what they beheld nor where he was, but he was as one in a swoon.  For he knew full well that the carle had lied to him, and that he might as well have said aye as no, and told him, that it verily was by that same shard that he had stridden over a dead man. Nevertheless he made as little semblance thereof as he might, and presently came to himself, and fell to talking of other matters, that had nought to do with the adventures of the land.  But after a while he spake suddenly, and said: \"My master, I was thinking of a thing.\"  \"Yea, of what?\" said the carle.  \"Of this,\" said Walter; \"that here in this land be strange adventures toward, and that if we, and I in especial, were to turn our backs on them, and go home with nothing done, it were pity of our lives: for all will be dull and deedless there.  I was deeming it were good if we tried the adventure.\"  \"What adventure?\" said the old man, rising up on his elbow and staring sternly on him.  Said Walter: \"The wending yonder pass to the eastward, whereby the huge men come to thee from out of the Bear-country;"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3055"],["title","The Wood Beyond the World (#4)"],["body"," we might see what should come thereof.\"  The carle leaned back again, and smiled and shook his head, and spake: \"That adventure were speedily proven: death would come of it, my son.\"  \"Yea, and how?\" said Walter.  The carle said: \"The big men would take thee, and offer thee up as a blood-offering to that woman, who is their Mawmet.  And if ye go all, then shall they do the like with all of you.\"  Said Walter: \"Is that sure?\"  \"Dead sure,\" said the carle.  \"How knowest thou this?\" said Walter.  \"I have been there myself,\" said the carle.  \"Yea,\" said Walter, \"but thou camest away whole.\"  \"Art thou sure thereof?\" said the carle.  \"Thou art alive yet, old man,\" said Walter, \"for I have seen thee eat thy meat, which ghosts use not to do.\"  And he laughed.  But the old man answered soberly: \"If I escaped, it was by this, that another woman saved me, and not often shall that befall.  Nor wholly was I saved; my body escaped forsooth.  But where is my soul?  Where is my heart, and my life?  Young man, I rede thee, try no such adventure; but go home to thy kindred if thou canst.  Moreover, wouldst thou fare alone? The others shall hinder thee.\"  Said Walter: \"I am the master; they shall do as I bid them: besides, they will be well pleased to share my goods amongst them if I give them a writing to clear them of all charges which might be brought against them.\"  \"My son! my son!\" said the carle, \"I pray thee go not to thy death!\"  Walter heard him silently, but as if he were persuaded to refrain; and then the old man fell to, and told him much concerning this Bear-folk and their customs, speaking very freely of them; but Walter's ears were scarce open to this talk: whereas he deemed that he should have nought to do with those wild men; and he durst not ask again concerning the country whereto led the pass on the northward.     CHAPTER VII: WALTER COMES TO THE SHARD IN THE ROCK-WALL   As they were in converse thus, they heard the hunters blowing on their horns all together; whereon the old man arose, and said: \"I deem by the blowing that the hunt will be over and done, and that they be blowing on their fellows who have gone scatter-meal about the wood.  It is now some five hours after noon, and thy men will be getting back with their venison, and will be fainest of the victuals they have caught; therefore will I hasten on before, and get ready fire and water and other matters for the cooking.  Wilt thou come with me, young master, or abide thy men here?\"  Walter said lightly: \"I will rest and abide them here; since I cannot fail to see them hence as they go on their ways to thine house.  And it may be well that I be at hand to command them and forbid, and put some order amongst them, for rough playmates they be, some of them, and now all heated with the hunting and the joy of the green earth.\"  Thus he spoke, as if nought were toward save supper and bed; but inwardly hope and fear were contending in him, and again his heart beat so hard, that he deemed that the carle must surely hear it.  But the old man took him but according to his outward seeming, and nodded his head, and went away quietly toward his house.  When he had been gone a little, Walter rose up heedfully; he had with him a scrip wherein was some cheese and hard-fish, and a little flasket of wine; a short bow he had with him, and a quiver of arrows; and he was girt with a strong and good sword, and a wood-knife withal.  He looked to all this gear that it was nought amiss, and then speedily went down off the mound, and when he was come down, he found that it covered him from men coming out of the wood, if he went straight thence to that shard of the rock-wall where was the pass that led southward.  Now it is no nay that thitherward he turned, and went wisely, lest the carle should make a backward cast, and see him, or lest any straggler of his own folk might happen upon him.  For to say sooth, he deemed that did they wind him, they would be like to let him of his journey.  He had noted the bearings of the cliffs nigh the shard, and whereas he could see their heads everywhere except from the depths of the thicket, he was not like to go astray.  He had made no great way ere he heard the horns blowing all together again in one place, and looking thitherward through the leafy boughs (for he was now amidst of a thicket) he saw his men thronging the mound, and had no doubt therefore that they were blowing on him; but being well under cover he heeded it nought, and lying still a little, saw them go down off the mound and go all of them toward the carle's house, still blowing as they went, but not faring scatter-meal.  Wherefore it was clear that they were nought troubled about him.  So he went on his way to the shard; and there is nothing to say of his journey till he got before it with the last of the clear day, and entered it straightway.  It was in sooth a downright breach or cleft in the rock- wall, and there was no hill or bent leading up to it, nothing but a tumble of stones before it, which was somewhat uneasy going, yet needed nought but labour to overcome it, and when he had got over this, and was in the very pass itself, he found it no ill going: forsooth at first it was little worse than a rough road betwixt two great stony slopes, though a little trickle of water ran down amidst of it.  So, though it was so nigh nightfall, yet Walter pressed on, yea, and long after the very night was come.  For the moon rose wide and bright a little after nightfall. But at last he had gone so long, and was so wearied, that he deemed it nought but wisdom to rest him, and so lay down on a piece of greensward betwixt the stones, when he had eaten a morsel out of his satchel, and drunk of the water out of the stream.  There as he lay, if he had any doubt of peril, his weariness soon made it all one to him, for presently he was sleeping as soundly as any man in Langton on Holm.     CHAPTER VIII: WALTER WENDS THE WASTE   Day was yet young when he awoke: he leapt to his feet, and went down to the stream and drank of its waters, and washed the night off him in a pool thereof, and then set forth on his way again.  When he had gone some three hours, the road, which had been going up all the way, but somewhat gently, grew steeper, and the bent on either side lowered, and lowered, till it sank at last altogether, and then was he on a rough mountain-neck with little grass, and no water; save that now and again was a soft place with a flow amidst of it, and such places he must needs fetch a compass about, lest he be mired.  He gave himself but little rest, eating what he needs must as he went.  The day was bright and calm, so that the sun was never hidden, and he steered by it due south.  All that day he went, and found no more change in that huge neck, save that whiles it was more and whiles less steep.  A little before nightfall he happened on a shallow pool some twenty yards over; and he deemed it good to rest there, since there was water for his avail, though he might have made somewhat more out of the tail end of the day.  When dawn came again he awoke and arose, nor spent much time over his breakfast; but pressed on all he might; and now he said to himself, that whatsoever other peril were athwart his way, he was out of the danger of the chase of his own folk.  All this while he had seen no four-footed beast, save now and again a hill-fox, and once some outlandish kind of hare; and of fowl but very few: a crow or two, a long-winged hawk, and twice an eagle high up aloft.  Again, the third night, he slept in the stony wilderness, which still led him up and up.  Only toward the end of the day, himseemed that it had been less steep for a long while: otherwise nought was changed, on all sides it was nought but the endless neck, wherefrom nought could be seen, but some other part of itself.  This fourth night withal he found no water whereby he might rest, so that he awoke parched, and longing to drink just when the dawn was at its coldest.  But on the fifth morrow the ground rose but little, and at last, when he had been going wearily a long while, and now, hard on noontide, his thirst grieved him sorely, he came on a spring welling out from under a high rock, the water wherefrom trickled feebly away.  So eager was he to drink, that at first he heeded nought else; but when his thirst was fully quenched his eyes caught sight of the stream which flowed from the well, and he gave a shout, for lo! it was running south.  Wherefore it was with a merry heart that he went on, and as he went, came on more streams, all running south or thereabouts.  He hastened on all he might, but in despite of all the speed he made, and that he felt the land now going down southward, night overtook him in that same wilderness.  Yet when he stayed at last for sheer weariness, he lay down in what he deemed by the moonlight to be a shallow valley, with a ridge at the southern end thereof.  He slept long, and when he awoke the sun was high in the heavens, and never was brighter or clearer morning on the earth than was that.  He arose and ate of what little was yet left him, and drank of the water of a stream which he had followed the evening before, and beside which he had laid him down; and then set forth again with no great hope to come on new tidings that day.  But yet when he was fairly afoot, himseemed that there was something new in the air which he breathed, that was soft and bore sweet scents home to him; whereas heretofore, and that especially for the last three or four days, it had been harsh and void, like the face of the desert itself.  So on he went, and presently was mounting the ridge aforesaid, and, as oft happens when one climbs a steep place, he kept his eyes on the ground, till he felt he was on the top of the ridge.  Then he stopped to take breath, and raised his head and looked, and lo! he was verily on the brow of the great mountain-neck, and down below him was the hanging of the great"]]]
