At six hundred yards the Eleventh opened with shell. The men worked like tigers in their desperate resolve that their beloved guns would never again feel the insult of a rebel touch.  Three times they charged and three times they were repulsed. Each time they came so close that we resorted to double charges of canister and never a rebel reached the muzzles of our guns. By four o'clock the Confederates were staggering back or surrendering in squads.  From some prisoners taken at Corinth it was learned that they were still unnerved from the moral effect of their assaults at Iuka. Those prisoners stated that, as they went into the assault, they recognized the bark of the guns of the Eleventh Ohio. Before these guns they had seen hundreds of their comrades fall like wheat before the harvester. They felt that they could not again silence the guns of the Eleventh. It had taken five assaults to do so when the odds were many to one.  At daylight of October 5th, after a night spent in convoying prisoners and caring for the wounded, we started in pursuit of the remains of Price's and Van Dorn's armies. During that day's march our army simply gathered in throngs of rebels. The retreating force had been three days without regular rations and were too weak to escape.  For two long days and nights we pressed our foes until our condition was hardly better than theirs. At one A. M. on the second night's march, we were stumbling along, almost dead with fatigue, when suddenly a band struck up the familiar song--John Brown's Body. Other bands joined; we all woke up and were soon swinging along without a thought of our condition. I have often wondered what moral effect this musical demonstration, at dead of night, had upon our quarry.  It took us three days to return to Corinth, horses stumbling with weariness, men asleep in their saddles, tired but happy, a victory won against odds.     \"AN ARMY EXPERIENCE\"   The following appreciative remembrance of the action of the Eleventh Ohio Battery at battles of Iuka, September 19, 1862, and Corinth, October 4, 1862, appeared in the columns of the St. Paul (Minnesota) Pioneer Press in 1884. Having been preserved by a Companion of the Ohio Commandery, it was read by the Recorder, Major Thrall, at the Commandery monthly meeting of October 6, 1909, as the Recorder's contribution to the discussion of an account of the part of the Eleventh Ohio in those battles, which had just been presented by Captain Neil, and by general request is published by the Commandery, without the advice or consent of Companion Neil.    GEO. A. THAYER,   A. B. ISHAM,   L. M. HOSEA,   _Publication Committee_.     \"AN ARMY EXPERIENCE.   \"No scenes of life are so deeply and indelibly impressed upon the memory as those which occur in war and battle. All the mental faculties seem to be melted into a fused condition by the excitement of the occasion, so that a full and deep impression of all the principal events is made and then to be suddenly turned to adamant so that the impression must remain as long as the faculties endure. There is not a soldier of the late war, who took part in any engagement, who does not have impressed upon his mind some event or scene which then transpired that is just as vivid and fresh today as on the day it was made. And when the memory is turned toward it by the suggestion of any other faculty--by the sight of some party connected therewith, or hearing kindred sounds, or by those more hidden spiritual influences less understood that at times cause to form in order and pass in review before the mind all the leading and exciting incidents of past life, these events and scenes are again displayed with all the vividness and strength of first impression. These thoughts were suggested to the writer upon meeting Lieutenant H. M. Neil of the Eleventh Ohio Battery at the meeting of the Society of the Army of the Tennessee at St. Louis, in 1882. Twenty years had passed since I had seen his face, and I had reckoned him among the brave spirits of the war which had gone to rest. When I saw him last before this, he was commanding his battery in the thickest of the fight at the battle of Corinth about 11 o'clock in the forenoon of October 4, 1862. His rank was that of Second Lieutenant. All officers of higher grade were absent in hospital from wounds received fifteen days before at Iuka, in which battle this battery of a few more than 100 men had eighteen killed and fifty-two wounded, and out of 148 horses had but three left standing at the close of the engagement. The battery was captured by the rebels and recaptured by our troops. Lieutenant Neil was the only commissioned officer on duty at the close of the engagement, and he had been wounded twice with shell and twice with bullets--severe flesh wounds. He was besmeared with blood. The Lieutenant was, notwithstanding full of pluck. He said the next morning, \"If I can have one hundred men detailed from the infantry and horses furnished, I will have the battery in fighting trim again in two weeks.\" Infantry soldiers readily volunteered upon call to man the battery, and horses were furnished by the Quartermaster, and on the afternoon of the 3d of October--fourteen days from the annihilation of the battery the battle of Corinth was fought and the Lieutenant having marched up from Iuka without escort, came upon the field with his battery fully manned, equipped and drilled, amid the hurrahs and tears of the infantry that had seen it destroyed under the terrible fire of the 19th of September, and who now seemed to feel that the battery men, horses and all, had come back from the regions of the dead to aid in the terrible struggle now going on between the same armies.  \"The Lieutenant received the heartiest congratulations of all officers who had been with him in the battle of Iuka. While receiving those of the writer he said: \"I want you to stay right by my battery with your regiment when it goes into action here, and if you will no rebel battalions can take it this time.\" There was a promise to comply with his request. On the following morning when the irresistible assault of the rebel army came, the Eleventh Ohio Battery was in position commanding the whole rebel line and the Fourth Minnesota Infantry in line flat upon the ground close in its rear. Lieutenant Neil was seated on his thoroughbred from twenty to forty feet in front of the battery, between the line of fire of the guns of the middle section. He requested the Colonel of the infantry to keep his eye upon him and whenever he beckoned with his saber, to have the infantry rise up and deliver their fire.  \"Now the assaulting lines of the rebel armies come on like a wave of the sea, rolling along over breastworks and batteries. He orders the men to open fire and, still in his advanced position, waves his hat constantly to the advancing lines of rebels, and shouts, 'Come on! Come on! if you think you can play Iuka over again.' A strange coincidence was that the same rebel battalions came against this battery that had captured it on the 19th of September. But they could not come on here. Three times the Lieutenant signaled the infantry to rise and fire, and each time they rose to hear him say, 'No, no, they have broke again.'  \"For a half mile in front of this battery, after the battle, were large areas covered with the dead and dying, which told with what terrible effect it had been served during the assault.  \"The sight of the Lieutenant, after twenty years, brought up these occurrences--this whole scene, and made it as fresh as if it had transpired yesterday, and made me resolve to commit it to writing before I died, feeling that none of us had done him justice in our reports of these battles.  \"The scene at Corinth, if it could be placed on canvas, would be thrilling even to strangers. An elegant thoroughbred Kentucky horse fully caparisoned, on which the Lieutenant is sitting erectly, with his hat in his hand, is standing out in front of the battery between the lines of fire of the two center guns, seemingly conscious that if he moved to the right or left he would be torn to atoms, and trusting himself wholly to his rider, the Lieutenant is waving his hat in the air, and bidding defiance to the foe; advancing in masses and lines upon his positions, the artillerymen with superhuman power and skill, amid the smoke that rolled incessantly from the muzzles of every gun, loading and firing, is a picture before the mind at this distance plainer than can be placed on canvas by the most skillful artist. It is such men and such services that saved this nation in the war. They were not conspicuous nor vain-glorious, perhaps not heard of before the war, nor afterwards; but in the midst of it, meeting the full demands of the great occasion and leaving the reward to posterity.  \"What this officer did after this battle in the war, I know not. He passed from my sight when we withdrew from that line of battle, and twenty years passed before I saw his face again, and during all this time never heard a word concerning him. When I met him it was my privilege to name him as one of the vice presidents of our society, showing that time had in no respect obliterated or dimmed the memory of his services.   JOHN B.

EATON, JR., AND PEGGY LOU STEWART  INTRODUCTION   A slab of shale obtained in 1955 by Mr. Russell R. Camp from a Pennsylvanian lagoon-deposit in Anderson County, Kansas, has yielded in the laboratory a skeleton of the small amphibian _Hesperoherpeton garnettense_ Peabody (1958). This skeleton provides new and surprising information not available from the holotype, No. 9976 K. U., which consisted only of a scapulocoracoid, neural arch, and rib fragment. The new specimen, No. 10295 K. U., is of the same size and stage of development as the holotype and it is thought that both individuals are adults.  The quarry, University of Kansas Museum of Natural History Locality KAN 1/D, is approximately six miles northwest of Garnett, Anderson County, Kansas, in Sec. 5, T. 19S, R. 19E, 200 yards southwest of the place where _Petrolacosaurus kansensis_ Lane was obtained (see Peabody, 1952). The Rock Lake shale, deposited under alternately marine and freshwater lagoon conditions, is a thin member of the Stanton limestone formation, Lansing group, Missourian series, and thus is in the lower part of the Upper Pennsylvanian.  Peabody (1958) placed _Hesperoherpeton_ in the order Anthracosauria, suborder Embolomeri, family Cricotidae. Study of the second and more complete specimen reveals that _Hesperoherpeton_ is unlike the known Embolomeri in many important features. The limbs and braincase are more primitive than those so far described in any amphibian. The vertebrae are comparable to those of Ichthyostegalia (Jarvik, 1952), as well as to those of Embolomeri. The forelimb is transitional between the pectoral fin of Rhipidistia and the limb of early Amphibia. The pattern of the bones of the forelimb closely resembles, but is simpler than, that of the hypothetical transitional type suggested by Eaton (1951). The foot seemingly had only four short digits. The hind limb is not known.  The new skeleton of _Hesperoherpeton_ lies in an oblong block of limy shale measuring approximately 100 × 60 mm. After preparation of the entire lower surface, the exposed bones and matrix were embedded in Bioplastic, in a layer thin enough for visibility but giving firm support. Then the specimen was inverted and the matrix removed from the opposite side; this has not been covered with Bioplastic. The bones lie in great disorder, except that some parts of the roof of the skull are associated, and the middle section of the vertebral column is approximately in place. The bones of the left forelimb are close together but not in a natural position. The tail, pelvis, hind limbs and right forelimb are missing. Nearly all the bones present are broken, distorted by crushing, incomplete and scattered out of place, probably by the action of currents. The complete skeleton, in life, probably measured between 150 and 200 mm. in length.  The specimen was studied at the Museum of Natural History, University of Kansas, with the help of a grant from the National Science Foundation, number NSF-G8624. The specimen was discovered in the slab by Miss Sharon K. Moriarty, and was further cleaned by the authors. Mr. Merton C. Bowman assisted with the illustrations. We are indebted to Dr. Robert W. Wilson for critical comments.   SKULL  _Dorsal Aspect_ (Figs. 1, 2)  In reconstruction, the skull measures approximately 8.0 mm. dorsoventrally at the posterior end. The height diminishes anteriorly to about 1.5 mm. at the premaxillary. The length is about 15.5 mm. in the median line, or 24.0 mm. to the tip of the tabular, and the width about 16.0 mm. posteriorly. The snout is blunt, continuing about 1-2 mm. anterior to the external nares. Each of the tabulars has a slender posterior process 5.0 mm. long, which probably met the supracleithrum; the intertabular space is about 8.5 mm. wide. The orbits are approximately 5.5 mm. in diameter and extend from the maxillary to within about 3.0 mm. of the midline dorsally. The pineal opening is 1.8 mm. anterior to the occipital margin of the skull.  Reduction of bones at the back of the skull seems to have eliminated any dermal elements posterior to the squamosal, while enlargement of the orbit has removed most of the postorbital series, leaving the squamosal as the only cheekbone. There is apparently no jugal or postfrontal.  The squamosal of _Acanthostega_ (Jarvik, 1952) is articulated under the tabular and reaches forward and down, much as if it were an opercular in reversed position. Internally, it must lie against the otic capsule below the tabular, partially concealing the stapes. The bone that we suppose to be the squamosal of _H. garnettense_ is of similar shape, of about the same size and has internally an articular surface at one corner, bounded by a pair of ridges in the shape of a V. This articular surface probably fitted on a lateral process extending from the roof of the neurocranium, over the front of the otic capsule.  The premaxillary extends posterolaterally to a distance 5.5 mm. from the midline and attains a width at its broadest point of about 1.5 mm. The posterior edge is slightly concave and in part forms the anterior border of the naris.  [Illustration: FIG. 1. _Hesperoherpeton garnettense_ Peabody. Skull, dorsal view. Postorbital processes of the neurocranium are shown in dotted outline. KU 10295, × 4.]  The nasal is triangular and, with the lacrimal, forms the medial border of the naris. The length of the medial side of the nasal bone is approximately 5.0 mm., the transverse width is 3.8 mm., and the extent of the posterolateral border is 5.5 mm.  The maxillary meets the premaxillary lateral to the naris, borders the naris posteroventrally, and continues posteriorly beneath the orbit, of which it forms the external border. The maxillary is about 8.5 mm. long, and immediately anterior to the orbit has a maximum width of 1.3 mm.  The lacrimal fills the remaining rim of the narial opening between the nasal and maxillary, and extends to the anterior edge of the orbit. The length, from naris to orbit, is 4.2 mm.; the width ranges from 1.0 mm. anteriorly to 2.5 mm. posteriorly.  [Illustration: FIG. 2. _Hesperoherpeton garnettense_ Peabody. Skull, lateral view, showing relatively large orbit and absence of smaller circumorbital bones. KU 10295, × 4.]  The external naris is approximately 1.0 mm. in diameter. It is slightly anterodorsal to the internal naris and 4.0 mm. lateral to the midline.  The dorsal margin of the orbit appears to be formed by the frontal. The anterior part of this margin, however, may be formed by a prefrontal, which is not clearly set off by a suture. The frontal extends 3.8 mm. in the midline, and anteriorly and laterally borders the nasal and lacrimal, respectively. A faint pattern of pitting radiates on the surface from the center of ossification of the frontal. There is also a pit indicating the presence of a supraorbital sensory pore.  The parietal bones enclose the pineal opening, approximately 2.5 mm. posterior to the suture with the frontal. The foramen is about 0.5 mm. in diameter. Laterally the parietal meets the medial angle of the postorbital and the medial border of the supratemporal. No bone of this animal shows the deep pitting and heavy ornamentation characteristic of many primitive Amphibia.  The postorbital meets the anterolateral corner of the parietal for a distance of 0.5 mm., the anterior edge bordering the frontal bone and the orbit for a combined distance of about 3.0 mm. The lateral margin is slightly convex, and is probably interrupted behind by the anterior point of the tabular. Medially, the concave margin of the postorbital meets the supratemporal for about 3.5 mm.  The supratemporal is thus wedge-shaped and located between the parietal and the postorbital. The posterior edge of the supratemporal protrudes as a convex border slightly behind the end of the parietal, and measures 3.0 mm. around the curve to the parietal suture.  [Illustration: FIG. 3. _Hesperoherpeton garnettense_ Peabody. A, left squamosal, internal surface. B, left squamosal, external surface. C, right tabular internal surface. D, right tabular, external surface. KU 10295, all × 4.]  The squamosal (Fig. 3 A, B) is a large, somewhat rectangular bone extending from the back of the orbit to the posterior extremity of the cheek. It outlines almost entirely the posterior border of the orbit, the ventrolateral portion of the cheek region, and the lateral border of the top of the skull behind the orbit. Dorsally, the squamosal meets the anterior half of the tabular and the lateral border of the supratemporal. Near the anteroventral edge of the squamosal there is a small pit, probably related to a postorbital sensory pore in the skin.  The tabular (Fig. 3 C, D) is pointed anteriorly, where it probably fits against the lateroposterior edge of the postorbital. The dorsal part of the bone flares out and down, forming a small otic notch at a point halfway back. Posteriorly, the flange attains a dorsoventral width of 2.0 mm. at the edge of the notch. The slender posterior process of the tabular which continues beyond the flange is approximately 0.5 mm. in diameter and 5.0 mm. long.  _Ventral Aspect_ (Fig. 4)  The palatal view of the skull shows the paired premaxillary, maxillary, palatine,"]]]
