Mr. Tomlinson, who first    acquainted me with it, told me that Mrs. Collins should be glad to    have them, and I made them over to her; whereupon she was pleased to    present me with fifty guineas. I desired her at the same time to take    care they should be kept safe and unhurt, which she promised to do.    This was done the 25th of last month. Mr. Tomlinson, who managed all    this affair, was present.     Now, having further considered that matter, I find that I have done a    most wicked thing. I am persuaded that I have betrayed the trust of a    person who, for twenty-six years, had given me continual instances of    his friendship and confidence. I am convinced that I have acted    contrary to the will and intention of my dear deceased friend; showed    a disregard to the particular mark of esteem he gave me on that    occasion; in short, that I have forfeited what is dearer to me than    my own life--honour and reputation.     These melancholy thoughts have made so great an impression upon me,    that I protest to you I can enjoy no rest; they haunt me everywhere,    day and night. I earnestly beseech you, sir, to represent my unhappy    case to Mrs. Collins. I acted with all the simplicity and uprightness    of my heart; I considered that the MSS. would be as safe in Mrs.    Collins's hands as in mine; that she was no less obliged to preserve    them than myself; and that, as the library was left to her, they    might naturally go along with it. Besides, I thought I could not too    much comply with the desire of a lady to whom I have so many    obligations. But I see now clearly that this is not fulfilling Mr.    Collins's will, and that the duties of our conscience are superior to    all other regards. But it is in her power to forgive and mend what I    have done imprudently, but with a good intention. Her high sense of    virtue and generosity will not, I am sure, let her take any advantage    of my weakness; and the tender regard she has for the memory of the    best of men, and the tenderest of husbands, will not suffer that his    intentions should be frustrated, and that she should be the    instrument of violating what is most sacred. If our late friend had    designed that his MSS. should remain in her hands, he would certainly    have left them to her by his last will and testament; his acting    otherwise is an evident proof that it was not his intention.     All this I proposed to represent to her in the most respectful    manner; but you will do it infinitely better than I can in this    present distraction of mind; and I flatter myself that the mutual    esteem and friendship which has continued so many years between Mr.    Collins and you, will make you readily embrace whatever tends to    honour his memory.     I send you the fifty guineas I received, which I do now look upon as    the wages of iniquity; and I desire you to return them to Mrs.    Collins, who, as I hope it of her justice, equity, and regard to Mr.    Collins's intentions, will be pleased to cancel my paper.       I am, &c.,         P. DES MAIZEAUX.  The manuscripts were never returned to Des Maizeaux; for seven years afterwards Mrs. Collins, who appears to have been a very spirited lady, addressed to him the following letter on the subject of a report, that she had permitted transcripts of these very manuscripts to get abroad. This occasioned an animated correspondence from both sides.      SIR,                                       _March 10, 1736-37_.     I have thus long waited in expectation that you would ere this have    called on Dean Sykes, as Sir B. Lucy said you intended, that I might    have had some satisfaction in relation to a very unjust    reproach--viz., that I, or somebody that I had trusted, had    _betrayed_ some of the transcripts, or MSS., of Mr. Collins into the    Bishop of London's hands. I cannot, therefore, since you have not    been with the dean as was desired, but call on you in this manner, to    know what authority you had for such a reflection; or on what grounds    you went for saying that these transcripts are in the Bishop of    London's hands. I am determined to trace out the grounds of such a    report; and you can be no friend of mine, no friend of Mr. Collins,    no friend to common justice, if you refuse to acquaint me, what    foundation you had for such a charge. I desire a very speedy answer    to this, who am, Sir,       Your servant,         ELIZ. COLLINS.     _To Mr. Des Maizeaux, at his lodgings next door to the Quakers'    burying-ground, Hanover-street, out of Long-Acre._      TO MRS. COLLINS.                                                _March 14, 1737._     I had the honour of your letter of the 10th inst., and as I find that    something has been misapprehended, I beg leave to set this matter    right.     Being lately with some honourable persons, I told them it had been    reported that some of Mr. C.'s MSS. were fallen into the hands of    strangers, and that I should be glad to receive from you such    information as might enable me to disprove that report. What    occasioned this surmise, or what particular MSS. were meant, I was    not able to discover; so I was left to my own conjectures, which,    upon a serious consideration, induced me to believe that it might    relate to the MSS. in eight volumes in 8vo, of which there is a    transcript. But as the original and the transcript are in your    possession, if you please, madam, to compare them together, you may    easily see whether they be both entire and perfect, or whether there    be anything wanting in either of them. By this means you will assure    yourself, and satisfy your friends, that several important pieces are    safe in your hands, and that the report is false and groundless. All    this I take the liberty to offer out of the singular respect I always    professed for you, and for the memory of Mr. Collins, to whom I have    endeavoured to do justice on all occasions, and particularly in the    memoirs that have been made use of in the General Dictionary; and I    hope my tender concern for his reputation will further appear when I    publish his life.      SIR,                                       _April 6, 1737_.     My ill state of health has hindered me from acknowledging sooner the    receipt of yours, from which I hoped for some satisfaction in    relation to your charge, in which I cannot but think myself very    deeply concerned. You tell me now, that you was left to your own    conjectures what particular MSS. were reported to have fallen into    the hands of strangers, and that upon a serious consideration you was    induced to believe that it might relate to the MSS. in eight vols.    8vo, of which there was a transcript.     I must beg of you to satisfy me very explicitly who were the persons    that reported this to you, and from whom did you receive this    information? You know that Mr. Collins left several MSS. behind him;    what grounds had you for your conjecture that it related to the MSS.    in eight vols., rather than to any other MSS. of which there was a    transcript? I beg that you will be very plain, and tell me what    strangers were named to you; and why you said the Bishop of London,    if your informer said stranger to you. I am so much concerned in    this, that I must repeat it, if you have the singular respect for Mr.    Collins which you profess, that you would help me to trace out this    reproach, which is so abusive to, Sir,       Your servant,          ELIZ. COLLINS.      TO MRS. COLLINS.     I flattered myself that my last letter would have satisfied you, but    I have the mortification to see that my hopes were vain. Therefore I    beg leave once more to set this matter right. When I told you what    had been reported, I acted, as I thought, the part of a true friend,    by acquainting you that some of your MSS. had been purloined, in    order that you might examine a fact which to me appeared of the last    consequence; and I verily believe that everybody in my case would    have expected thanks for such a friendly information. But instead of    that I find myself represented as an enemy, and challenged to produce    proofs and witnesses of a thing dropt in conversation, a hearsay, as    if in those cases people kept a register of what they hear, and    entered the names of the persons who spoke, the time, place, &c., and    had with them persons ready to witness the whole, &c. I did own I    never thought of such a thing, and whenever I happened to hear that    some of my friends had some loss, I thought it my duty to acquaint    them with such report, that they might inquire into the matter, and    see whether there was any ground for it. But I never troubled myself    with the names of the persons who spoke, as being a thing entirely    needless and unprofitable.     Give me leave further to observe, that you are in no ways _concerned_    in the matter, as you seem to be apprehensive you are. Suppose some    MSS. have been taken out of your library, who will say you ought to    bear the guilt of it? What man in his senses, who has the honour to    know you, will say you gave your consent to such thing--that you was    privy to it? How can you then take upon yourself an action to which    you was neither privy and consenting? Do not such things happen every    day, and do the losers think themselves injured or _abused_ when they    are talked of? Is it impossible to be betrayed by a person we    confided in?     You call what I told you was a report, a surmise; you call it, I say,    an _information_, and speak of _informers_ as if there was a plot    laid wherein I received the information: I thought I had the honour    to be better known to you. Mr. Collins loved me and esteemed me for    my integrity and sincerity, of which he had several proofs; how I    have been drawn in to injure"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31078"],["title","Curiosities of Literature, Vol. 3 (#6)"],["body","im, to forfeit the good opinion he had    of me, and which, were he now alive, would deservedly expose me to    his utmost contempt, is a grief which I shall carry to the grave. It    would be a sort of comfort to me, if those who have consented I    should be drawn in were in some measure sensible of the guilt towards    so good, kind, and generous a man.   Thus we find that, _seven years_ after Des Maizeaux had inconsiderately betrayed his sacred trust, his remorse was still awake; and the sincerity of his grief is attested by the affecting style which describes it: the spirit of his departed friend seemed to be hovering about him, and, in his imagination, would haunt him to the grave.  The nature of these manuscripts; the cause of the earnest desire of retaining them by the widow; the evident unfriendliness of her conduct to Des Maizeaux; and whether these manuscripts, consisting of eight octavo volumes with their transcripts, were destroyed, or are still existing, are all circumstances which my researches have hitherto not ascertained.   FOOTNOTES:    [14] _Van Effen_ was a Dutch writer of some merit, and one of a     literary knot of ingenious men, consisting of Sallengre, St.     Hyacinthe, Prosper Marchand, &c., who carried on a smart review for     those days, published at the Hague under the title of \"Journal     Littéraire.\" They all composed in French; and Van Effen gave the     first translations of our \"Guardian,\" \"Robinson Crusoe,\" and the     \"Tale of a Tub,\" &c. He did something more, but not better; he     attempted to imitate the \"Spectator,\" in his \"Le Misanthrope,\" 1726,     which exhibits a picture of the uninteresting manners of a nation     whom he could not make very lively.      _De Limiers_ has had his name slipped into our biographical     dictionaries. An author cannot escape the fatality of the alphabet;     his numerous misdeeds are registered. It is said, that if he had not     been so hungry, he would have given proofs of possessing some     talent.    [15] I find that the nominal pension was 3_s._ 6_d._ per diem on the     Irish civil list, which amounts to above 63_l._ per annum. If a     pension be granted for reward, it seems a mockery that the income     should be so grievously reduced, which cruel custom still prevails.    [16] This letter, or petition, was written in 1732. In 1743 he     procured his pension to be placed on his wife's life, and he died in     1745.      He was sworn in as gentleman of his majesty's privy chamber in     1722--_Sloane MSS._ 4289.    [17] There is a printed catalogue of his library.    [18] This information is from a note found among Des Maizeaux's     papers; but its truth I have no means to ascertain.     HISTORY OF NEW WORDS.   Neology, or the novelty of words and phrases, is an innovation, which, with the opulence of our present language, the English philologer is most jealous to allow; but we have puritans or precisians of English, superstitiously nice! The fantastic coinage of affectation or caprice will cease to circulate from its own alloy; but shall we reject the ore of fine workmanship and solid weight? There is no government mint of words, and it is no statutable offence to invent a felicitous or daring expression unauthorised by Mr. Todd! When a man of genius, in the heat of his pursuits or his feelings, has thrown out a peculiar word, it probably conveyed more precision or energy than any other established word, otherwise he is but an ignorant pretender!  Julius Cæsar, who, unlike other great captains, is authority on words as well as about blows, wrote a large treatise on \"Analogy,\" in which that fine genius counselled to \"avoid every unusual word as a rock!\"[19] The cautious Quintilian, as might be expected, opposes all innovation in language. \"If the new word is well received, small is the glory; if rejected, it raises laughter.\"[20] This only marks the penury of his feelings in this species of adventure. The great legislator of words, who lived when his own language was at its acmé, seems undecided, yet pleaded for this liberty. \"Shall that which the Romans allowed to Cæcilius and to Plautus be refused to Virgil and Varius?\" The answer to the question might not be favourable to the inquirer. While a language is forming, writers are applauded for extending its limits; when established, for restricting themselves to them. But this is to imagine that a perfect language can exist! The good sense and observation of Horace perceived that there may be occasions where necessity must become the mother of invented words:--                 ----Si forte necesse est   Indiciis monstrare recentibus abdita rerum.    If you write of things abstruse or new,   Some of your own inventing may be used,   So it be seldom and discreetly done.      ROSCOMMON.  But Horace's canon for deciding on the legality of the new invention, or the standard by which it is to be tried, will not serve to assist the inventor of words:--                  ----licuit, semperque licebit,   Signatum præsente nota procudere nummum.[21]  This _præsens nota_, or public stamp, can never be affixed to any new coinage of words: for many received at a season have perished with it.[22] The privilege of stamping words is reserved for their greatest enemy--Time itself! and the inventor of a new word must never flatter himself that he has secured the public adoption, for he must lie in his grave before he can enter the dictionary.  In Willes' address to the reader, prefixed to the collection of Voyages published in 1577, he finds fault with Eden's translation from Peter Martyr, for using words that \"smelt too much of the Latine.\" We should scarcely have expected to find among them _ponderouse_, _portentouse_, _despicable_, _obsequious_, _homicide_, _imbibed_, _destructive_, _prodigious_. The only words he quotes, not thoroughly naturalised, are _dominators_, _ditionaries_, (subjects), _solicitute_ (careful).  The Tatler, No. 230, introduces several polysyllables introduced by military narrations, \"which (he says), if they attack us too frequently, we shall certainly put them to flight, and cut off the rear;\" every one of them still keep their ground.  Half the French words used affectedly by Melantha, in Dryden's _Marriage à-la-Mode_, as innovations in our language, are now in common use, _naïveté_, _foible_, _chagrin_, _grimace_, _embarras_, _double entendre_, _equivoque_, _eclaircissement_, _ridicule_, all these words, which she learns by heart to use occasionally, are now in common use. A Dr. Russel called Psalm-singers _Ballad-singers_, having found the Song of Solomon in an old translation, the _Ballad of Ballads_, for which he is reproached by his antagonist for not knowing that the signification of words alters with time; should I call him _knave_, he ought not to be concerned at it, for the Apostle Paul is also called a _knave of Jesus Christ_.[23]  Unquestionably, NEOLOGY opens a wide door to innovation; scarcely has a century passed since our language was patched up with Gallic idioms, as in the preceding century it was piebald with Spanish, and with Italian, and even with Dutch. The political intercourse of islanders with their neighbours has ever influenced their language. In Elizabeth's reign Italian phrases[24] and Netherland words were imported; in James and Charles the Spanish framed the style of courtesy; in Charles the Second the nation and the language were equally Frenchified. Yet such are the sources from whence we have often derived some of the wealth of our language!  There are three foul corruptors of a language: caprice, affectation, and ignorance! Such fashionable cant terms as \"theatricals,\" and \"musicals,\" invented by the flippant Topham, still survive among his confraternity of frivolity. A lady eminent for the elegance of her taste, and of whom one of the best judges, the celebrated Miss Edgeworth, observed to me, that she spoke the purest and most idiomatic English she had ever heard, threw out an observation which might be extended to a great deal of our present fashionable vocabulary. She is now old enough, she said, to have lived to hear the vulgarisms of her youth adopted in drawing-room circles.[25] To _lunch_, now so familiar from the fairest lips, in her youth was only known in the servants' hall. An expression very rife of late among our young ladies, _a nice man_, whatever it may mean, whether that the man resemble a pudding or something more nice, conveys the offensive notion that they are ready to eat him up! When I was a boy, it was an age of _bon ton_; this _good tone_ mysteriously conveyed a sublime idea of fashion; the term, imported late in the eighteenth century, closed with it. _Twaddle_ for a while succeeded _bore_; but _bore_ has recovered the supremacy. We want another Swift to give a new edition of his \"Polite Conversation.\" A dictionary of barbarisms too might be collected from some wretched neologists, whose pens are now at work! Lord Chesterfield, in his exhortations to conform to Johnson's Dictionary, was desirous, however, that the great lexicographer should add as an appendix, \"_A neological dictionary_, containing those polite, though perhaps not strictly grammatical, words and phrases commonly used, and sometimes understood by the _beau-monde_.\"[26] This last phrase was doubtless a contribution! Such a dictionary had already appeared in the French language, drawn up by two caustic critics, who in the _Dictionnaire néologique à l'usage des beaux Esprits du Siècle_ collected together the numerous unlucky inventions of affectation, with their modern authorities! A collection of the fine words and phrases, culled from some very modern poetry, might show the real amount of the favours bestowed on us.  The attempts of neologists are, however, not necessarily to be condemned; and we may join with the commentators of Aulus Gellius, who have lamented the loss of a chapter of which the title only has descended to us.
