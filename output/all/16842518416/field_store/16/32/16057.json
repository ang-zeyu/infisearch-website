You'll repeat them to the other robots, understand?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said the robot.  \"All right, then,\" said the Eldest. \"First, you take a run up that hill and look into that clearing. You'll see those creatures in there all right.\"  \"Yes, sir. I've seen those creatures in there.\"  The Eldest Keeper exploded. \"Then get in there and obey your orders! Don't you realize that their very existence threatens the life of all of us? They must be eliminated before our whole culture is destroyed! Do you understand? Obey!\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said the robot. His voice sounded odd, but he spun around and went to pass the word on to the other robots. Within minutes, more and more of the pesticide robots were swarming towards and into the clearing. They could hear rumbling noises from the clearing--low grunts that were evidently made by animals who were trapped by the encircling robots.  And then there was a vast silence.  Dodeth and the Keepers waited.  Not a shot was fired.  It was as though a great, sound-proof blanket had been flung over the whole area.         *       *       *       *       *  \"What in the Unknown Name of the Universal Motivator is going on around here?\" said Dodeth in a hushed tone. He wondered how many times he had asked himself that.  \"We may as well take a look,\" said the Eldest Keeper.  Two hundred pesticide robots were ranged around the perimeter of the clearing, their weapons facing inward. Not a one of them moved.  Inside the circle of machines, the twenty wygorex stood motionless, watching the ring of robots. Now and then, one of them gave a deep, coughing rumble, but otherwise they made no noise.  Dodeth Pell could stand it no longer. \"Robots!\" He shouted as loudly as he could, his voice shrill with urgency. \"I order you to fire!\"  It was as though he hadn't said a word. Both robots and wygorex ignored him completely.  Dodeth turned and yelled to one of the patrol robots that was standing nearby. \"You! What's your name?\"  \"Arvam, sir.\"  \"Arvam, can you tell what it is those things have done to the robots?\"  \"They haven't done anything, sir.\"  \"Then why don't the robots fire as they've been told?\" Dodeth didn't want to admit it, even to himself, but he was badly frightened. He had never heard of a robot behaving this way before.  \"They can't, sir.\"  \"They _can't_? Don't they realize that if those things aren't killed, we may all die?\"  \"I didn't know that,\" said the patrol robot. \"If we do not kill them, then you may be killed, and you have ordered us to kill them, but if we obey your orders, then we will kill them, and that will mean that you won't be killed, but they will, so we can't do that, but if we don't then you _will_ be killed, and we must obey, and that means we must, but we can't, but if we don't we will, and we can't so we must but we can't but if we don't you will so we must but we can't but we--\" He kept repeating it over and over again, on and on and on.  \"Stop that!\" snapped Dodeth.  But the robot didn't even seem to hear.  Dodeth was really frightened now. He looked back at the five keepers and scuttled toward them.  \"What's wrong with the robots?\" he asked shrilly. \"They've never failed us before!\"  The Elder Keeper looked at him. \"What makes you think they've failed us now?\" he asked softly.  Dodeth gaped speechlessly. The Eldest didn't seem to be making any more sense than the patrol robot had.  \"No,\" the Keeper went on, \"they haven't failed us. They have served us well. They have pointed out to us something which we have failed to see, and, in doing so, have saved us from making a catastrophic error.\"  \"I don't understand,\" said Dodeth.  \"I'll explain,\" the Elder Keeper said, \"but first go over to that patrol robot and tell him quietly that the situation has changed. Tell him that we are no longer in any danger from the wygorex. Then bring him over here.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Dodeth did as he was told, without understanding at all.  \"I still don't understand, sir,\" he said bewilderedly.  \"Dodeth, what would happen if I told Arvam, here, to fire on you?\"  \"Why ... why, he'd _refuse_.\"  \"Why should he?\"  \"Because I'm _human_! That's the most basic robot command.\"  \"I don't know,\" the Eldest said, eying Dodeth shrewdly. \"You might not be a human. You might be a snith. You _look_ like a snith.\"  Dodeth swallowed the insult, wondering what the Eldest meant.  \"Arvam,\" the Eldest Keeper said to the robot, \"doesn't he look like a snith to you?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" Arvam agreed.  Dodeth swallowed that one, too.  \"Then how do you know he _isn't_ a snith, Arvam?\"  \"Because he behaves like a human, sir. A snith does not behave like a human.\"  \"And if something does behave like a human, what then?\"  \"Anything that behaves like a human is human, sir.\"  Dodeth suddenly felt as though his eyes had suddenly focused after being unfocused for a long time. He gestured toward the clearing. \"You mean those ... those _things_ ... are ... _human_?\"  \"Yes sir,\" said Arvam solidly.  \"But they don't even _talk_!\"  \"Pardon me for correcting you sir, but they do. I cannot understand their speech, but the pattern is clearly recognizable as speech. Most of their conversation is carried on in tones of subsonic frequency, so your ears cannot hear it. Apparently, your voices are supersonic to them.\"  \"Well, I'll be fried,\" said Dodeth. He looked at the Elder Keeper. \"That's why the robots reported they couldn't find any _animal_ of that description in the vicinity.\"  \"Certainly. There weren't any.\"  \"And we were so fooled by their monstrous appearance that we didn't pay any attention to their actions,\" said Dodeth.  \"Exactly.\"  \"But this makes the puzzle even _worse_,\" said Dodeth. \"How could such a creature evolve?\"  \"Look!\" interrupted one of the other Keepers, pointing. \"Up there in the sky!\"  All eyes turned toward the direction the finger pointed.  It was a silvery speck in the sky that moved and became larger.  \"I don't think they're from our World at all,\" said the Eldest Keeper. He turned to the patrol robot. \"Arvam, go down and tell the pesticide robots that there is no danger to us. They're still confused, and I have a feeling that the humans in that ship up there might not like it if we are caught pointing guns at their friends.\"  As Arvam rolled off, Dodeth said \"Another World?\"  \"Why not?\" asked the Eldest. \"The Moon, after all, is another World, smaller than ours, to be sure, and airless, but still another World. We haven't thought too much about other Worlds because we have our own World to take care of. But there was a time, back in the days of the builders of the surface cities, when our people dreamed such things. But our Moon was the only one close enough, and there was no point in going to a place which is even more hellish than our Brightside.  \"But suppose the Yellow Sun also has a planet--or maybe even one of the more distant suns, which are hardly more than glimmers of light. They came, and they landed a few of their party to make a small clearing. Then the ship went somewhere else--to the dark side of our Moon, maybe, I don't know. But they were within calling range, for the ship was called as soon as trouble appeared.  \"We don't know anything about them yet, but we will. And we've got to show them that we, too, are human. We have a job ahead of us--a job of communication.  \"But we also have a great future if we handle things right.\"  Dodeth watched the ship, now grown to a silvery globe of tremendous size, drift slowly downward toward the clearing. He felt an inward glow of intense anticipation, and he fidgeted impatiently as he waited to see what would happen next.  He rippled a stomp.

General Bramble's Return      GENERAL BRAMBLE     CHAPTER I  PORTRAITS    \"As to what the picture represents, that depends upon who looks    at it.\"--Whistler.   The French Mission in its profound wisdom had sent as liaison officer to the Scottish Division a captain of Dragoons whose name was Beltara.  \"Are you any relation to the painter, sir?\" Aurelle, the interpreter, asked him.  \"What did you say?\" said the dragoon. \"Say that again, will you? You _are_ in the army, aren't you? You are a soldier, for a little time at any rate? and you claim to know that such people as painters exist? You actually admit the existence of that God-forsaken species?\"  And he related how he had visited the French War Office after he had been wounded, and how an old colonel had made friends with him and had tried to find him a congenial job.  \"What's your profession in civilian life, _capitaine_?\" the old man had asked as he filled in a form.  \"I am a painter, sir.\"  \"A painter?\" the colonel exclaimed, dumbfounded. \"A painter? Why, damn it all!\"  And after thinking it over for a minute he added, with the kindly wink of an accomplice in crime, \"Well, let's put down _nil_, eh? It won't look quite so silly.\"    *  *  *  *  *  Captain Beltara and Aurelle soon became inseparable companions. They had the same tastes and different professions, which is the ideal recipe for friendship. Aurelle admired the sketches in which the painter recorded the flexible lines of the Flemish landscape; Beltara was a kindly critic of the young man's rather feeble verses.  \"You would perhaps be a poet,\" he said to him, \"if you were not burdened with a certain degree of culture. An artist must be an idiot. The only perfect ones are the sculptors; then come the landscape painters; then painters in general; after them the writers. The critics are not at all stupid; and the really intelligent men never do anything.\"  \"Why shouldn't intelligence have an art of its own, as sensibility has?\"  \"No, my friend, no. Art is a game; intelligence is a profession. Look at me, for instance; now that I no longer touch my brushes, I sometimes actually catch myself thinking; it's quite alarming.\"  \"You ought to paint some portraits here, _mon capitaine_. Aren't you tempted? These sunburnt British complexions----\"  \"Of course, my boy, it is tempting; but I haven't got my things with me. Besides, would they consent to sit?\"  \"Of course they would, for as long as you like. To-morrow I'll bring round young Dundas, the aide-de-camp. He's got nothing to do; he'll be delighted.\"    *  *  *  *  *  Next day Beltara made a three-crayon sketch of Lieutenant Dundas. The young aide-de-camp turned out quite a good sitter; all he asked was to be allowed to do something, which meant shouting his hunting cries, cracking his favourite whip and talking to his dog.  \"Ah,\" said Aurelle, at the end of the sitting, \"I like that immensely--really. It's so lightly touched--it's a mere nothing, and yet the whole of England is there.\"  And, waving his hands with the ritual gestures of the infatuated picture-lover, he praised the artlessness of the clear, wide eyes, the delightful freshness of the complexion, and the charming candour of the smile.  But the Cherub planted himself in front of his portrait, struck the classical pose of the golfer, and, poising his arms and hitting at an imaginary ball, pronounced judgment on the work of art with perfect frankness.  \"My God,\" he said, \"what an awful thing! How the deuce did you see, old man, that my breeches were laced at the side?\"  \"What on earth can that matter?\" asked Aurelle, annoyed.  \"Matter! Would _you_ like to be painted with your nose behind your ear? My God! It's about as much like me as it is like Lloyd George.\"  \"Likeness is quite a secondary quality,\" said Aurelle condescendingly. \"The interesting thing is not the individual; it is the type, the synthesis of a whole race or class.\"  \"In the days when I was starving in my native South,\" said the painter, \"I used to paint portraits of tradesmen's wives for a fiver. When I had done, the family assembled for a private view. 'Well,' said the husband, 'it's not so bad; but what about the likeness, eh? You put it in afterwards, I suppose?' 'The likeness?' I indignantly replied. 'The likeness? My dear sir, I am a painter of ideals; I don't paint your wife as she is, I paint her as she ought to be. Your wife? Why, you see her every day--she cannot interest you. But my painting--ah, you never saw anything like my painting!' And the tradesman was convinced, and went about repeating in every café on the Cannebière, 'Beltara, _mon bon_, is the painter of ideals; he does not paint my wife as she is, he paints her as she ought to be.'\"  \"Well,\" interrupted young Lieutenant Dundas, \"if you can make my breeches lace in front, I should be most grateful. I look like a damned fool as it is now!\"    *  *  *  *  *  The following week Beltara, who had managed to get hold of some paints, made excellent studies in oil of Colonel Parker and Major Knight. The major, who was stout, found his corporation somewhat exaggerated.  \"Yes,\" said the painter, \"but with the varnish, you know----\"  And with an expressive movement of his hands he made as if to restore the figure to more normal dimensions.  The colonel, who was lean, wanted to be padded out.  \"Yes,\" said Beltara, \"but with the varnish, you know----\"  And his hands, moving back again, gave promise of astonishing expansions.  Having regained a taste for his profession, he tried his hand at some of the finest types in the Division. His portraits met with various verdicts; each model thought his own rotten and the others excellent.  The Divisional Squadron Commander found his boots badly polished. The C.R.E. commented severely on the important mistakes in the order of his ribbons; the Legion of Honour being a foreign order should not have preceded the Bath, and the Japanese Rising Sun ought to have followed the Italian Order for Valour.  The only unqualified praise came from the sergeant-major who acted as chief clerk to General Bramble. He was a much-beribboned old warrior with a head like a faun and three red hairs on top of it. He had the respectful familiarity of the underling who knows he is indispensable, and he used to come in at all times of the day and criticize the captain's work.  \"That's fine, sir,\" he would say, \"that's fine.\"  After some time he asked Aurelle whether the captain would consent \"to take his photo.\" The request was accepted, for the old N.C.O.'s beacon-like countenance tempted the painter, and he made a kindly caricature.  \"Well, sir,\" the old soldier said to him, \"I've seen lots of photographer chaps the likes of you--I've seen lots at fairs in Scotland--but I've never seen one as gives you a portrait so quick.\"  He soon told General Bramble of the painter's prowess; and as he exercised a respectful but all-powerful authority over the general, he persuaded him to come and give the French liaison officer a sitting.  The general proved an admirable model of discipline. Beltara, who was very anxious to be successful in this attempt, demanded several sittings. The general arrived punctually, took up his pose with charming deliberation, and when the painter had done, said \"Thank you,\" with a smile, and went away without saying another word.  \"Look here,\" Beltara said to Aurelle, \"does this bore him or not? He hasn't come one single time to look at what I have done. I can't understand it.\"  \"He'll look at it when you've finished,\" Aurelle replied. \"I'm sure he's delighted, and he'll let you see it when the time comes.\"  As a matter of fact after the last sitting, when the painter had said \"Thank you, sir, I think I could only spoil it now,\" the general slowly descended from the platform, took a few solemn steps round the easel, and stared at his portrait for some minutes.  \"Humph!\" he said at length, and left the room.    *  *  *  *  *  Dr. O'Grady, who was a man of real artistic culture, seemed somehow to understand that keeping decorations in their correct order is not the only criterion of the beauty of a portrait. The grateful Beltara proposed to make a sketch of him, and during the sitting was pleased to find himself in agreement with the doctor upon many things.  \"The main point,\" said the painter, \"is to see simply--outlines, general masses. The thing is not to copy nature with childish minuteness.\"  \"No, of course not,\" replied the doctor. \"Besides, it can't be done.\"  \"Of course it can't, because nature is so endlessly full of details which can never all be considered. The thing is to suggest their presence.\"  \"Quite so,\" said the doctor.  But when he came to gaze upon the face he loved so well, and saw it transformed into outlines and general masses, he seemed a little surprised.  \"Well, of course,\" he said, \"it is excellent--oh, it's very, very good--but don't you think you have made me a little too old? I have no lines at the corner of my mouth, and my hair is not quite so thin.\"  He appealed to the aide-de-camp who was just then passing by.  \"Dundas, is this like me?\"  \"Certainly, Doc;"]]]
