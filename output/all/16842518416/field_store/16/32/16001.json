It does not require a room to itself, and the worker may leave it at any moment between two stitches when called to other duties. Nunneries produced the finest work of the dark and middle ages; and their teaching inaugurated the workrooms in the palaces and castles, where young girls, whether royal, noble, or gentle, were trained in embroidery as an accomplishment and a household duty.  The history of domestic embroidery ought to be looked upon as that of an important factor in the humanizing effect of æsthetic culture.  The woman of the house has always been strong to fulfil her part in this civilizing influence with the implement which custom has awarded to her. Every man in the ancient East began his life under the tent or in the palace adorned by the hands of his mother and her maidens, and his home was made beautiful by his wife and his sisters and their slaves. There, as in mediæval homes, lessons of morality and religion, and the love and fame of noble deeds, were taught by the painting of the needle to the minds of the young men, who would have scorned more direct teaching; and the children felt the influence, as the women wove what the bards sang.  Alas! we have but few specimens of embroideries of which we know the history, earlier than the tenth and eleventh centuries.[10] Yet from the days of the books of the Old Testament and the song of the siege of Troy, down to the present time, the woman of the house has adorned not only herself and her dear lord, but she has hung the walls, the seats, the bed, and the tables with her beautiful creations.  Homer's women were all artists with the needle. Venus seeking Helen,--      \"Like fair Laodice in form and face,     The loveliest nymph of Priam's royal race,     Here in the palace at her loom she found:     The golden web her own sad story crown'd.     The Trojan wars she weaved (herself the prize),     And the dire triumph of her fatal eyes.\"[11]  This must have been intended for hangings.  Hecuba's wardrobe is thus described:--      \"The Phrygian queen to her rich wardrobe went,     Where treasured odours breathed a costly scent;     There lay the vestures of no vulgar art,     Sidonian maids embroider'd every part.     Here, as the queen revolved with careful eyes     The various textures and the various dyes     She chose a web that shone superior far,     And glow'd refulgent as the morning star.\"[12]  The women of the Middle Ages were great at the loom and frame. From the Kleine Heldenbuch of the thirteenth century, Rock quotes these lines:--      \"Who taught me to embroider in a frame with silk,     And to sketch and design the wild and tame     Beasts of the forest and field?     Also to picture on plain surfaces;     Round about to place golden borders--     narrow and a broad one--     With stags and hinds, lifelike.\"  Gudrun, like the women of Homer, embroidered history--that of the ancestors of Siegfried.  But in the Middle Ages the embroiderers were ambitious artists. The deeds of Roland and the siege of Troy, all romantic and classical lore, provided subjects for the needle.  Shakespeare gives a pretty picture of the graceful weaver and embroiderer:--      * * * \"Would ever with Marina be:--     Be't when she weaves the sleided silk,     With fingers long, small, white as milk;     Or when she would with sharp neeld wound     The cambric, which she makes more sound     By hurting it....     Deep clerks she dumbs; and with her neeld composes     Nature's own shape, of bud, bird, branch, or berry,     That even her art sisters the natural roses.\"[13]  Before closing this Introduction, I will take the opportunity to protest against the abuse of the phrase \"High Art.\" It is generally appropriated by that which is the lowest and most feeble.  An old design for a chair or table, by no means remarkable originally, but cheaply copied, and covered with a quaint and dismal cretonne or poorly worked pattern, of which the design is neither new nor artistic, is introduced by the upholsterer as belonging to \"High Art furniture.\" The epithet has succeeded to what was once \"fashionable\" and \"elegant.\" To get rid of carpets, and put down rugs, to hang up rows of plates instead of family portraits--this also is \"high art.\" Likewise gowns lumped upon the shoulders, with all the folds drawn across, instead of hanging draperies. The term is never used when we speak of the great arts--painting, sculpture, and architecture. It is, in fact, only the slang of the cabinet-maker, the upholsterer, and milliner.  All true Art is very high indeed and apparent; and needs not to be introduced with a puff. It sits enthroned between Poetry and History. Even those who are ignorant of its laws feel its influence, and the soothing grace which it sheds, falling like the rain, equally upon the just and the unjust. Man's nature always responds to the truly high and beautiful; only the most degraded are deprived of this source of happiness. And there are but few women, till debased by cruelty, misery, or drink, that do not try in some humble way (but especially with their needle) to adorn their own persons, their children, and their homes; and if their art is not high, it yet has the power to elevate them.[14] While the most ambitious women try a higher flight, into the regions of poetry, literature, painting, and even sculpture (why has no woman ever been an architect?), millions have enjoyed the art of the needle for thousands of years, and it will continue to be a solace and a delight as long as the world lasts, for, like all art, it gives the ever new joy of creation.   FOOTNOTES:      [3] See Duke of Argyll's \"Unity of Nature.\"      [4] Walls, pillars, and roofs were certainly hung with     textile ornament before they were carved or painted.     This is Semper's theory, and though Woltmann and     Woermann (\"History of Painting,\" Eng. Trans., Sidney     Colvin, p. 38) hardly accept this view, they do not     gainsay it. The women who wove hangings for the grove,     or more literally, \"coverings for the houses\" of the     grove, were probably the priestesses of Astarte, and     wove and worked the hangings of various colours. 2 Kings     xxii.; Ezek. xvi. 16-18.      \"It is probable that the earliest kind of pictures were     either woven or embroidered upon figured stuffs of     various colours; and that in these decorations the     Greeks in the first instance imitated the Semitic races,     who had practised them from time immemorial.\" See     Woltmann and Woermann's \"History of Painting\" (Eng.     Trans.), p. 38.      [5] Joshua vii.      [6] Ezek. xxvii. 23.

[14] Surely it is a humanizing and Christian principle     which in Italy permits artistic work to be done in the     prisons where criminals are confined for life. Sisters     of Mercy teach lace-making to the wretched women who,     having committed great crimes, may never be seen again.     The produce of the work helps to pay the expense of the     prison, and at the same time a very small percentage is     given to the prisoners to send to their friends, or to     spend on little comforts, thus encouraging the poor     human creatures to exercise their best powers. We     believe this is sometimes allowed also in England and     France.     CHAPTER I.  STYLE.   In venturing to approach so great a subject as the history of style, I would beg my readers to believe how well I am aware that on each point much more has been already carefully treated by previous writers, than will fall within the limits of a chapter that is intended only to throw light on textile art, and especially on embroidery.  I suppose it is the same in all subjects of human speculation which are worthy of serious study; and therefore I ought not to have been surprised to find how much has already been written on needlework and embroidery, and how unconsciously I, at least, have passed by and ignored these notices, till it struck me that I ought to know something of the history and principles of the art which with others, I was striving to revive and improve.  Then new and old facts crowded round me, and became significant and interesting. I longed to know something of the first worker and the first needle; and behold the needle has been found!--among the débris of the life of the Neolithic cave-man, made of bone and very neatly fashioned.  Alas! the workwoman and her work are gone to dust; but _there_ is the needle!--proof positive that the craft existed before the last glacial period in Britain.[15] How long ago this was, we may conjecture, but can never finally ascertain. Then I find embroidery named by the earliest historians, by every poet of antiquity, and by the first travellers in the East; and it has been the subject of laws and enactments from the date of the Code of Manu in India, to the present century. One becomes eager to systematize all this information, and to share with the workers and thinkers of the craft, the pleasure found in its study.  Perhaps what is here collected may appear somewhat bald and disjointed; but antiquity, both human and historical, is apt to be bald; and its dislocation and disjointed condition are owing to the frequent"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30472"],["title","Needlework As Art (#6)"],["body","aclysms, physical, political, and social, which needlework has survived, bringing down to us the same stitches which served the same purposes for decoration under the Code of Manu, and adorned the Sanctuary in the wilderness; and those stitches probably were not new then.  I propose to give a slight sketch of the origin of the styles[16] that have followed each other, noting the national influences that have displaced or altered them, and the overlap of style caused by outside events.  First, I would define what \"STYLE\" means.  Style is the mark impressed on art by a national period, short or long. It fades, it wanes, and then some historical element enters on the scene, which carries with it new materials, needs, and tastes (either imported or springing up under the new conditions). The style of the day in art and literature alters so perceptibly, that all who have had any artistic training are at once aware of the difference.  Of late years, the science of history has been greatly assisted by the science of language. When the mute language of art shall have been patiently deciphered, the historian will be furnished with new powers in his researches after truth.  The first \"ineffaceable\" is a _word_; the second a _pattern_. This is proved by the history of needlework.  As the world grows old, its youth becomes more interesting. Alas! the childhood of mankind is so distant, and it was so long before it learned its letters, that but few facts have come down to us, on which we may firmly build our theories; yet we must acknowledge the great stride that has been made in the last few years, in the scientific mode of extracting history from the ruins and tombs, and even the dust-heaps, of the past. Whole epochs, which fifty years ago were as blank as the then maps of Central Africa, are being now gradually covered with landmarks.  Layard, Rawlinson, C. T. Newton, Botta, Rassam, Schliemann, Birch, G. Smith, and a crowd of archæologists, and even unscientific explorers, are collecting the materials from which the history of mankind is being reconstructed.  From them I have sought information about the art of embroidery, and I find that Semper gives it a high pre-eminence as to its antiquity, making it the foundation and starting-point of all art. He clothes not only man, but architecture, with the products of the loom and the needle; and derives from them in succession, painting, bas-relief, and sculpture.[17]         *       *       *       *       *  Style has to be considered in two different aspects, from two different standpoints. First, historically and archæologically, distinguishing and dating the forms which follow upon each other; and tracing them back in the order of their natural sequence; so as to guide us to the root, nay, to the seed[18] of each and all art.  The subsidiary art of embroidery, in its highest form the handmaid of architecture, is full of suggestion, and may assist us greatly in the search which culminates in the text of \"In the beginning.\"  The other point of view from which style should be considered is the æsthetic. This enables us to criticize the works of different periods; extracting, as far as we may, rules for the beautiful and the commendable, and seeking to find the \"why?\" also observing the operation of the law by which decay follows too soon after the best and highest efforts of genius, thought, and invention in art.  My present object is the history of consecutive styles, in so far as they concern needlework.  Alas! nothing endures. This law is acknowledged by Goethe, when he makes Jove answer Venus, who bewailed that all that is beautiful must die,--that he had only bestowed beauty on the evanescent.  It seems as if the moment the best is attained, men, ceasing to struggle for the better, fall back at once hopelessly and become mere imitators. They no longer follow a type, but copy a model, and then copy the copy. Imitation is a precipice, a swift descent through poverty of thought into the chaos of mannerism, in the place of style.  The imitative tendency, as existing in all human minds, cannot be ignored or despised. In individuals it accompanies enthusiasm for the beautiful, and the graceful charm of sympathy. It maintains continuity between specimen and specimen, between artist and artist, between century and century; and it is this which enables an adept to say with certainty of consecutive styles, \"This is Spanish work of the sixteenth century; that is Flemish or German work of the seventeenth century.\"  The theory of development and of the survival of the fittest has been worked so hard, that it sometimes breaks down under the task imposed upon it. It would need to include Death in its procedure. In our creed, Death, means the moment of entrance into a higher existence; but in art it means extinction, leaving behind neither a history nor an artisan--only, perhaps, an infinitely small tradition, like the grain of corn preserved in the wrappings of a mummy, from which at first accident, and then care and culture, may evoke a future life.  The various ways in which art has appeared at the beginning cannot here be discussed; nor how the Chinese and Hindu may have leapt into a perfection which has stood still for thousands of years, protected alike from expansion as from destruction, by the swaddling bands of codified custom; while Greek art rose like the sun, shone over the civilized world, and set--never again to see another epoch of glory. These subjects must be left for the study of the anthropological philosopher, who is working for the assistance and guidance of the future historian of art.  Style in needlework has passed through many phases since the aboriginal, prehistoric woman, with the bone needle, drew together the edges of the skins of the animals she had prepared for food.  For absolute necessity, in forming the garments and covering the tent, needlework need go no further than the seam. This, however, in the woven or plaited material, must fray where it is shaped, and become fringed at the edges. Every long seam is a suggestion, and every shaped edge a snare.  The fringe lends itself to the tassel, and the shaped seam suggests a pattern; up-stitches are needed for binding the web, and before she is aware of it, the worker finds herself adorning, _embroidering_; and the craft enters the outskirts of the region of art.  The humble early efforts at decoration, called by the French \"primitif,\" are the first we know and class, and are found in all savage attempts at ornament. This style consists mainly of straight lines, zigzags, wavy lines, dots, and little discs.[19]  Gold discs of many sizes, and worked with a variety of patterns, are found equally in the tomb of the warrior at Mycenæ, and in Ashantee, accompanied in both cases with gold masks covering the faces of the dead. The discs or buttons remind us of those found in Etruscan tombs, though the execution of these last is more advanced. They appear to be the origin of the \"clavus\" or nail-headed pattern woven into silks in the Palace of the Cæsars. The last recorded survival of this pattern is in woven materials for ecclesiastical purposes in the Middle Ages.  Of very early needlework we only find here and there a fragment, illustrated occasionally by passing allusions in poetry and history.  The ornamental art of Hissarlik[20] is so primitive that we cannot feel that it has any resemblance to that described as Trojan by Homer, who probably adorned his song with the art he had known elsewhere.[21]  We know not what the actual heroes of the Iliad and Odyssey wore; but we do know that what Homer describes, he must have seen. Was Homer, therefore, the contemporary of the siege of Troy?--or does he not rather speak of the customs and costumes of his own time, and apply them to the traditions of the heroic ages of Greece? Whatever be the date of Homer himself, we can, with the help of contemporary survivals, reconstruct the house and the hall, and even furnish them, and clothe the women and the princes, the beggars and the herdsmen.  From the remains of Egyptian, Babylonian, and Assyrian art we can perceive their differences and their affinities. It is from textile fragments, found mostly in tombs, that we obtain dates, and can suggest them for other specimens.  The funeral tent of Shishak's mother-in-law, at Boulac, is most valuable as showing what was the textile art of that early period.[22]    [Illustration: Fig. 1.     Egyptian corselet. (Wilkinson's \"Ancient Egyptians.\")]  The corselet which, according to Herodotus, was given by Amasis, King of Egypt, to the Temple of Minerva at Lindos, in Rhodes, was possibly worked in this style; for Babylonian embroidery was greatly prized in Egypt, and imitated.  The second corselet given by Amasis to the Lacædemonians was worked in gold and colours, with animals and other decorations. This was of the seventh century B.C.[23]  Amongst the arms painted on the wall of the tomb of Rameses, at Thebes (in Egypt), is a corselet, apparently of rich stuff,[24] embroidered with lions and other devices. (Fig. 1.)  The Phœnicians imbibed and reproduced the styles they met with in their voyages. The bowls found in Cyprus described and engraved in the September number of the \"Magazine of Art\" (1883), are most interesting illustrations of the meeting of two national styles, the Assyrian and the Egyptian.[25]  Homer's \"Shield of Achilles\"[26] must, in general design, have resembled these bowls (see Pl. 5). They also recall the description by Josephus of the Temple veils at Jerusalem, which were Babylonian.[27]  Phœnicia, which was the carrier of all art, dropped specimens here and there, for many hundred years, along the borders of the Mediterranean and the coasts of Spain. We fancy we can trace her ocean-path by the western shores of Africa, and even to America; otherwise, how could it happen that a mummy-wrapping in Peru should so nearly resemble some of those wrappings found at "]]]
