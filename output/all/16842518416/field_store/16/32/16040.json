The ULNA articulates with the humerus at the elbow, and forms a perfect hinge-joint. This bone is situated on the inner side of the fore-arm.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  What is represented by fig. 13? By fig. 14? 100. Describe the ulna.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  101. The RADIUS articulates with the bones of the carpus and forms the wrist-joint. This bone is situated on the outside of the fore-arm, (the side on which the thumb is placed.) The ulna and radius, at their extremities, articulate with each other, by which union the hand is made to rotate, permitting its complicated and varied movements.  102. The CARPUS is composed of eight bones, ranged in two rows, and so firmly bound together, as to permit only a small amount of movement.  [Illustration: Fig. 15. U, The ulna. R, The radius.

The METACARPUS is composed of five bones, upon four of which the first range of the finger-bones is placed; and upon the other, the first bone of the thumb. The five metacarpal bones articulate with the second range of carpal bones.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  101. The radius. 102. How many bones in the carpus? How are they ranged? 103. Describe the metacarpus.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  104. The PHALANGES of the fingers have three ranges of bones, while the thumb has but two.  _Observation._ The wonderful adaptation of the hand to all the mechanical offices of life, is one cause of man's superiority over the rest of creation. This arises from the size and strength of the thumbs, and the different lengths of the fingers.  105. The LOWER EXTREMITIES contain sixty bones--the _Fe´mur_, (thigh-bone;) the _Pa-tel´la_, (knee-pan;) the _Tib´i-a_, (shin-bone;) the _Fib´u-la_, (small bone of the leg;) the _Tar´sus_, (instep;) the _Met-a-tar´sus_, (middle of the foot;) and the _Pha-lan´ges_, (toes.)  106. The FEMUR is the longest bone in the system. It supports the weight of the head, trunk, and upper extremities. The large, round head of this bone is placed in the acetabulum. This articulation is a perfect specimen of the ball and socket joint.  107. The PATELLA is a small bone connected with the tibia by a strong ligament. The tendon of the _ex-tens´or_ muscles of the leg is attached to its upper edge. This bone is placed on the anterior part of the lower extremity of the femur, and acts like a pulley, in the extension of the limb.  108. The TIBIA is the largest bone of the leg. It is of a triangular shape, and enlarged at each extremity.  109. The FIBULA is a smaller bone than the tibia, but of similar shape. It is firmly bound to the tibia, at each extremity.  110. The TARSUS is formed of seven irregular bones, which are so firmly bound together as to permit but little movement.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  104.

Explain fig. 18.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  111. The METATARSAL bones are five in number. They articulate at one extremity with one range of tarsal bones; at the other extremity, with the first range of the toe-bones.  [Illustration: Fig. 19.

These bones are so united as to secure a great degree of elasticity, or spring.]  _Observation._ The tarsal and metatarsal bones are united so as to give the foot an arched form, convex above, and concave below. This structure conduces to the elasticity of the step, and the weight of the body is transmitted to the ground by the spring of the arch, in a manner which prevents injury to the numerous organs.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  111. Describe the metatarsal bones. Explain fig. 19. What is represented by fig. 20? What is said of the arrangement of the bones of the foot?    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  112. The PHALANGES (fig. 19) are composed of fourteen bones; each of the small toes has three ranges of bones, while the great toe has but two.  113. The JOINTS form an interesting part of the body. In their construction, every thing shows the regard that has been paid to the security and the facility of motion of the parts thus connected together. They are composed of the extremities of two or more bones, _Car´ti-lages_, (gristles,) _Syn-o´vi-al_ membrane, and _Lig´a-ments_.  [Illustration: Fig. 21 The relative position of the bones, cartilages, and synovial membrane. 1, 1, The extremities of two bones that concur to form a joint. 2, 2, The cartilages that cover the end of the bones. 3, 3, 3, 3, The synovial membrane which covers the cartilage of both bones, and is then doubled back from one to the other; it is represented by the dotted lines.]  [Illustration: Fig. 22.

CARTILAGE is a smooth, solid, elastic substance, of a pearly whiteness, softer than bone. It forms upon the articular surfaces of the bones a thin incrustation, not more than the sixteenth of an inch in thickness. Upon convex surfaces it is the thickest in the centre, and thin toward the circumference; while upon concave surfaces, an opposite arrangement is presented.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  112. Describe the phalanges. 113-118. _Give the anatomy of the joints._ 113. What is said of the joints? Of what are the joints composed? What is illustrated by fig. 21? By fig. 22? 114. Define cartilage.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  115. The SYNOVIAL MEMBRANE is a thin, membranous layer, which covers the cartilages, and is thence bent back, or reflected upon the inner surfaces of the ligaments which surround and enter into the composition of the joints. This membrane forms a closed sac, like the membrane that lines an egg-shell.  [Illustration: Fig. 23. The anterior ligaments of the knee-joint. 1, The tendon of the muscle that extends the leg. 2, The patella. 3, The anterior ligament of the patella, near its insertion. 4, 4, The synovial membrane. 5, The internal lateral ligament. 6, The long external lateral ligament. 7, The anterior and superior ligament that unites the fibula to the tibia.]  [Illustration: Fig. 24. 2, 3, The ligaments that extend from the clavicle (1) to the scapula (4.) The ligaments 5, 6, extend from the scapula to the first bone of the arm.]  116. Beside the synovial membrane, there are numerous smaller sacs, called _bur´sæ mu-co´sæ_. These are often associated with the articulation. In structure, they are analogous to synovial membranes, and secrete a similar fluid.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  115. Describe the synovial membrane. 116. Describe the bursæ mucosæ. What is represented by fig. 23? By fig. 24?    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  117. The LIGAMENTS are composed of numerous straight fibres, collected together, and arranged into short bands of various breadths, or so interwoven as to form a broad layer, which completely surrounds the articular extremities of the bones, and constitutes a capsular ligament. These connecting bands are white, glistening, and inelastic. Most of the ligaments are found exterior to the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30541"],["title","A Treatise on Anatomy, Physiology, and Hygiene (Revised Edition) (#7)"],["body","membrane.  118. The bones, cartilages, ligaments, and synovial membrane are insensible when in health; yet they are supplied with organic nerves, as well as with arteries, veins, and lymphatics.  _Observation._ The joints of the domestic animals are similar in their construction to those of man. To illustrate this part of the body, a fresh joint of the calf or sheep may be used. After divesting the joints of the skin, the satin-like bands, or ligaments, will be seen passing from one bone to the other, under which may be observed the membranous bag, called the capsular ligament. This is very smooth, as it is lined with the soft synovial membrane, beneath which will be seen the cartilage, that may be cut with a knife, and under this the rough extremity of the ends of the bones.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  117. Of what are ligaments composed? What is the appearance of these bands? Where are they found? 118. With what vessels are the cartilages and ligaments supplied? How can the structure of the joints be explained?    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=     CHAPTER VI.  PHYSIOLOGY OF THE BONES.   119. The bones are the framework of the system. By their solidity and form, they not only retain every part of the fabric in its proper shape, but afford a firm surface for the attachment of the muscles and ligaments. By means of the bones, the human frame presents to the eye a wonderful piece of mechanism, uniting the most finished symmetry of form with freedom of motion, and also giving security to many important organs.  120. To give a clear idea of the relative uses of the bones and muscles, we will quote the comparison of another, though, as in other comparisons, there are points of difference. The \"bones are to the body what the masts and spars are to the ship,--they give support and the power of resistance. The muscles are to the bones what the ropes are to the masts and spars. The bones are the levers of the system; by the action of the muscles their relative positions are changed. As the masts and spars of a vessel must be sufficiently firm to sustain the action of the ropes, so the bones must possess the same quality to sustain the action of the muscles in the human body.\"  121. Some of the bones are designed exclusively for the protection of the organs which they enclose. Of this number are those that form the skull, the sockets of the eye, and the cavity of the nose. Others, in addition to the protection they give to important organs, are useful in movements of certain kinds. Of this class are the bones of the spinal column, and ribs. Others are subservient to motion. Of this class are the upper and lower extremities.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  119-128. _Give the physiology of the bones._ 119. How may the bones be considered? 120. To what may the bones be compared? 121. Give the different offices of the bones.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  122. The bones are subject to growth and decay; to removal of old, useless matter, and the deposit of new particles, as in other tissues. This has been tested by the following experiment. Some of the inferior animals were fed with food that contained madder. In a few days, some of the animals were killed, and their bones exhibited an unusually reddish appearance. The remainder of the animals were, for a few weeks, fed on food that contained no coloring principle. When they were killed, their bones exhibited the usual color of such animals. The coloring matter, which had been deposited, had been removed by the action of the lymphatics.  123. The extremities of the bones that concur in forming a joint, correspond by having their respective configurations reciprocal. They are, in general, the one convex, and the other concave. In texture they are porous, and consequently more elastic than if more compact. These are covered with a cushion of cartilage. The elastic character of these parts acts as so many springs, in diminishing the jar which important organs of the system would otherwise receive.  124. The synovial membrane secretes a viscous fluid, which is called _syn-o´vi-a_. This lubricating fluid of the joints enables the surfaces of the bones and tendons to move smoothly upon each other, thus diminishing the friction consequent on their action.  _Observations._ 1st. In this secretion is manifested the skill and omnipotence of the Great Architect; for no machine of human invention supplies to itself, by its own operations, the necessary lubricating fluid. But, in the animal frame, it is supplied in proper quantities, and applied in the proper place, and at the proper time.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  122. What is said of the change in bones? How was it proved that there was a constant change in the osseous fabric? 123. What is said of the extremities of the bones that form a joint? 124. What is synovia? Its use? What is said of this lubricating fluid?    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  2d. In some cases of injury and disease, the synovial fluid is secreted in large quantities, and distends the sac of the joint. This affection is called dropsy of the joint, and occurs most frequently in that of the knee.  125. The function of the ligaments is to connect and bind together the bones of the system. By them the small bones of the wrist and foot, as well as the large bones, are as securely fastened as if retained by clasps of steel. Some of them are situated within the joints, like a central cord, or pivot, (3, fig. 26.) Some surround it like a hood, and contain the lubricating synovial fluid, (8, 9, fig. 25,) and some in the form of bands at the side, (5, 6, fig. 23.)  [Illustration: Fig. 25. 8, 9, The ligaments that extend from the hip-bone (6) to the femur, (5.)]  [Illustration: Fig. 26. 2, The socket of the hip-joint. 5, The head of the femur, which is lodged in the socket. 3, The ligament within the socket.]  126. By the ligaments the lower jaw is bound to the temporal bones, and the head to the neck. They extend the whole length of the spinal column, in powerful bands, on the outer surface, between the spinal bones, and from one spinous process to another. They bind the ribs to the vertebræ, to the transverse process behind, and to the sternum in front; and this to the clavicle; and this to the first rib and scapula; and this last to the humerus.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  What is the effect when the synovial fluid is secreted in large quantities? 125. What is the function of the ligaments? 126. Mention how the bones of the system are connected.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  127. They also bind the two bones of the fore-arm at the elbow-joint; and these to the wrist; and these to each other and to those of the hand; and these last to each other and to those of the fingers and thumb. In the same manner, they bind the bones of the pelvis together; and these to the femur; and this to the two bones of the leg and patella; and so on, to the ankle, foot, and toes, as in the upper extremities.  [Illustration: Fig. 27. 1, A front view of the lateral ligaments of the finger-joints. 2, A view of the anterior ligaments (_a_, _b_,) of the finger-joints. 3, A side view of the lateral ligaments of the finger joints.]  128. The different joints vary in range of movement, and in complexity of structure. Some permit motions in all directions, as the shoulder; some move in two directions, permitting only flexion and extension of the part, as the elbow; while others have no movement, as the bones of the head in the adult.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  Explain fig. 27. 128. Describe the variety of movements in the different joints.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  [Illustration: Fig. 28. 1, 1, The spinal column. 2, The skull. 3, The lower jaw. 4, The sternum. 5, The ribs. 6, 6, The cartilages of the ribs. 7, The clavicle. 8, The humerus. 9, The shoulder-joint. 10, The radius. 11, The ulna. 12, The elbow joint. 13, The wrist. 14, The hand. 15, The haunch-bone. 16, The sacrum. 17, The hip-joint. 18, The thigh-bone. 19, The patella. 20, The knee-joint. 21, The fibula. 22, The tibia. 23, The ankle-joint. 24, The foot. 25, 26, The ligaments of the clavicle, sternum, and ribs. 27, 28, 29, The ligaments of the shoulder, elbow, and wrist. 30, The large artery of the arm. 31, The ligaments of the hip-joint. 32, The large blood-vessels of the thigh. 33, The artery of the leg. 34, 35, 36, The ligaments of the patella, knee, and ankle.]  _Note._ Let the pupil, in form of topics, review the anatomy and physiology of the bones from fig. 28, or from anatomical outline plates No. 1 and 2.     CHAPTER VII  HYGIENE OF THE BONES.   129. _The bones increase in size and strength by use, while they are weakened by inaction._ Exercise favors the deposition of both animal and earthy matter, by increasing the circulation and nutrition in this texture. For this reason, the bones of the laborer are dense and strong, while those who neglect exercise, or are unaccustomed to manual employment, are deficient in size, and have not a due proportion of earthy matter to give them the solidity and strength of the laboring man.  _Observation._ The tendons of the muscles are attached near the extremities of the bones. Exercise of the muscles increases the action of the vessels of that part to which the tendons are attached, and thus increases the nutrition and size of this portion of the bone. Hence the joints of an industrious mechanic or farmer are larger than those of an individual who has not pursued manual vocations.  130. _The gelatinous bones of the child are not so well adapted for labor and severe exercise as those of an adult._ 1st. They are liable to become distorted. 2d. They are consolidated by the deposition of earthy material before they are fully and properly developed. If a young animal, as the colt, be put to severe, continued labor, the deposition of earthy matter is hastened, and the bones are consolidated before they attain full growth. Such colts make small and inferior animals. Similar results follow, if a youth"]]]
