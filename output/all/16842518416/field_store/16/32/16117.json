At the same moment, a blast of intense, fiery, almost unbearable pain shot up his own arm. As he grasped his arm, sweat spurting out on his face, he heard screams from the box on his left and realized it was Director Cornelius who screamed.  There were answering screams from around the hall.  [Illustration]  Then the pain suddenly subsided.         *       *       *       *       *  Menesee started about, breathing raggedly. The pain-reaction had been severe enough to affect his vision; the great hall looked momentarily darker than it should have been. And although the actual pain had ended, the muscles of his arm and shoulder were still trying to cramp into knots.  There was no more screaming. From the right came Director Ojeda's gasping voice. \"What happened? Did something go wrong with the stimulating devices? We might all have been killed--!\"  Menesee didn't reply. Wherever he looked, he saw faces whitened with shock. Apparently everyone in the Tribunal Hall, from the administrator and Spokesman Dorn on down to the directors' attendants and the two guards flanking the prisoner's area, had felt the same thing. Here and there, men who had collapsed were struggling awkwardly back to their feet. He heard a hoarse whisper behind him. \"Sir, Director Cornelius appears to have fainted!\"  Menesee glanced around, saw Cornelius' attendant behind the box, then Cornelius himself, slumped forward, face down and motionless, sprawling half across his table. \"Let him lie there and keep quiet, fool!\" Menesee ordered the man sharply. He returned his attention to the center of the hall as Spokesman Dorn announced in a voice which held more of an edge than was normal but had lost none of its strength and steadiness, \"Before any moves are suggested, I shall tell you what has been done.  \"The Tribunal Hall has been sealed and further events in it will be monitored from without. No one will be able to leave until the matter with which we are now concerned here has been settled to the satisfaction of the Machine.  \"Next, any of you who believe that an instrument failure was involved in the experience we shared can disabuse themselves. The same effect was reported immediately from two other auditoriums on the Great Circuit, and it is quite possible that it was repeated in all of them.\"  Rainbolt, grimacing and massaging his right arm vigorously, nodded. \"It was repeated in all of them, sir!\"  The spokesman ignored him, went on. \"The Tribunal Hall has, therefore, been cut out of the Grand Assembly Circuit. How circuit energies could have been employed to transmit such physical sensations is not clear. But they will not be used in that manner again.\"  Menesee felt a flash of admiration. His own thoughts had been turning in the same direction, but he couldn't have approached Spokesman Dorn's decisive speed of action.  Dorn turned his attention now to Rainbolt. \"What happened,\" he said, \"apparently was caused by yourself.\"  Rainbolt nodded. \"Yes, sir. It was. It was an application of Oneness. At present, I'm acting as a focal point of Oneness. Until that condition is changed, whatever I experience here will be simultaneously experienced by yourselves.\"  Menesee thought that the effects of the Machine's discipline became splendidly apparent at that point. No one stirred in the great hall though it must have been obvious to every man present that Rainbolt's words might have doomed them along with himself.  Rainbolt went on, addressing Spokesman Dorn.  \"There is only one mistake in your reasoning, sir. The demonstrated effect of Oneness is not carried by the energies of the Grand Assembly Circuit, though I made use of those energies in establishing an initial connection with the other auditoriums and the people in them.  \"You see, sir, we learned from the two men captured on Mars about your practice of having the two highest echelons of your organization attend significant hearings in the Tribunal Hall through the Assembly Circuit. Our plan was based on that. We knew that if anything was to be accomplished with the Oneness principles on Earth, it would have to be through a situation in which they could be applied simultaneously to the entire leadership of the Machine. That has now been done, and the fact that you had the Tribunal Hall taken out of the Assembly Circuit did not change the Oneness contact. It remains in full effect.\"  Spokesman Dorn stared at him for an instant, said, \"We can test the truth of that statement immediately, of course; and we shall!\" His hand moved on the desk.         *       *       *       *       *  Menesee felt pain surge through his left arm. It was not nearly as acute a sensation as the previous pulse had been, but it lasted longer--a good ten seconds. Menesee let his breath out carefully as it again ebbed away.  He heard the spokesman saying, \"Rainbolt's claim appears to be verified. I've received a report that the pulse was being experienced in one of the auditoriums ... and, yes ... now in several.\"  Rainbolt nodded. \"It was a valid claim, believe me, sir!\" he said earnestly. \"The applications of our principles have been very thoroughly explored, and the effects are invariable. Naturally, our strategem would have been useless if I'd been able to maintain contact only long enough to provide you with a demonstration of Oneness. Such a contact can be broken again, of course. But until I act deliberately to break it, it maintains itself automatically.  \"To make that clear, I should explain that distance, direction and intervening shielding materials do not change the strength of the contact. Distance at least does not until it is extended to approximately fifty thousand miles.\"  \"And what happens then?\" the spokesman asked, watching him.  \"At that point,\" Rainbolt acknowledged, \"Oneness contacts do become tenuous and begin to dissolve.\" He added, almost apologetically, \"However, that offers you no practical solution to your problem.\"  \"Why not?\" Dorn asked. He smiled faintly. \"Why shouldn't we simply lock you into a spaceship and direct the ship through the defense fields and out into the solar system on automatic control?\"  \"I sincerely hope you don't try it, sir! Experiments in dissolving contacts in that manner have been invariably fatal to all connected individuals.\"  The spokesman hesitated. \"You and every member of the Machine with whom you are now in contact would die together if that were done?\"  \"Yes, sir. That is certain what the results of those experiments show.\"  Administrator Bradshaw, who had been staring coldly at Rainbolt, asked in a hard, flat voice, \"If you do nothing to break the contact, how long will this situation continue?\"  Rainbolt looked at him. \"Indefinitely, sir,\" he said. \"There is nothing I need to do about it. It is a static condition.\"  \"In that case,\" Bradshaw said icily, \"_this_ should serve to break the contact through you!\"  As his hand came up, leveling a gun, Menesee was half out of his chair, hands raised in alarmed protest. \"Stop him!\" Menesee shouted.  But Administrator Bradshaw already was sagging sideways over the armrest of this chair, head lolling backwards. The gun slid from his hand, dropped to the platform.  \"Director Menesee,\" Dorn said coolly from beside Bradshaw, \"I thank you for your intended warning! Since the administrator and the spokesman are the only persons permitted to bear arms in the Tribunal Hall, I was naturally prepared to paralyze Administrator Bradshaw if he showed intentions of resorting to thoughtless action.\" He looked down at Rainbolt. \"Are Director Menesee and I correct in assuming that if you died violently the persons with whom you are in contact would again suffer the same experience?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" Rainbolt said. \"That is implicit in the principles of Oneness.\" He shrugged. \"Under most circumstances, it is a very undesirable effect. But here we have made use of it--\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"The situation,\" Spokesman Dorn told the directors in the Tribunal Hall some minutes later, \"is then this. There has been nothing haphazard about the Mars Convicts' plan to coerce us into accepting their terms. Considering the probable quality of the type of minds which developed both the stardrive and the extraordinary 'philosophy' we have encountered today, that could be taken for granted from the start. We cannot kill their emissary here, or subject him to serious pain or injury, since we would pay a completely disproportionate penalty in doing it.  \"However, that doesn't mean that we should surrender to the Mars Convicts. In fact, for all their cleverness, they appear to be acting out of something very close to desperation. They have gained no essential advantage through their trick, and we must assume they made the mistake of underestimating us. This gentleman they sent to Earth has been given thorough physical examinations. They show him to be in excellent health. He is also younger by many years than most of us.  \"So he will be confined to quarters where he will be comfortable and provided with whatever he wishes ... but where he will not be provided with any way of doing harm to himself. And then, I believe, we can simply forget about him. He will receive the best of attention, including medical care. Under such circumstances, we can expect his natural life span to exceed our own.  \"Meanwhile, we shall continue our program of developing our own spacedrive. As the Mars Convicts themselves foresee, we'll gain it eventually and will then be more than a match for them. Until then the defense fields around Earth will remain closed. No ship will leave Earth and no ship will be admitted to it. And in the long run we will win.\"  The spokesman paused, added, \"If there are no other suggestions, this man will now be conducted to the hospital of the Machine where he is to be detained for the remainder of his days.\"  Across the hall from Menesee,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30728"],["title","Oneness (#3)"],["body"," a figure arose deliberately in one of the boxes. A heavy voice said, \"Spokesman Dorn, I very definitely do have a suggestion.\"  Dorn looked over, nodded warily. \"Go ahead, Director Squires!\"  Menesee grimaced in distaste. He had no liking for Squires, a harsh, arrogant man, notorious for his relentless persecution of any director or officer who, in Squires' opinion, had become slack in his duties to the Machine. But he had a large following in the upper echelons, and his words carried weight.  Squires folded his arms, said unhurriedly as if savoring each word, \"As you pointed out, Spokesman Dorn, we cannot hurt the person of this prisoner. His immediate accomplices also remain beyond our reach at present. However, our hands are not--as you seem to imply--so completely tied that we cannot strike back at these rascals at once. There are camps on Earth filled with people of the same political stripe--potential supporters of the Mars Convicts who would be in fullest sympathy with their goals if they learned of them.  \"I suggest that these people serve now as an object lesson to show the Mars Convicts the full measure of our determination to submit to no threats of force! Let this prisoner and the other convicts who doubtless are lurking in nearby space beyond Earth's defense fields know that _for every day_ their obscene threat against the high officers of the Machine continues hundreds of malcontents who would welcome them on Earth will be painfully executed! Let them--\"  Pain doubled Menesee abruptly over the table before him. A savage, compressing pain, very different from the fiery touch of the nerve stimulators, which held him immobile, unable to cry out or draw breath.  It relaxed almost as instantaneously as it had come on. Menesee slumped back in his chair, shaken and choking, fighting down bitter nausea. His eyes refocused painfully on Rainbolt, gray-faced but on his feet, in the prisoner's area.  \"You will find,\" Rainbolt was saying, \"that Director Squires is dead. And so, I'm very much afraid, is every other member of the upper echelons whose heart was in no better condition than his. This was a demonstration I had not intended to give you. But since it has been given, it should serve as a reminder that while it is true we could not force you directly to do as we wish, there are things we are resolved not to tolerate.\"  Ojeda was whispering shakily near Menesee, \"He controls his body to the extent that he was able to bring on a heart attack in himself and project it to all of us! He counted on his own superb physical condition to pull him through it unharmed. _That_ is why he didn't seem frightened when the administrator threatened him with a gun. Even if the spokesman hadn't acted, that gun never would have been fired.  \"Menesee, no precautions we could take will stop that monster from killing us all whenever he finally chooses--simply by committing suicide through an act of will!\"  Spokesman Dorn's voice seemed to answer Ojeda.  \"Director Squires,\" Dorn's voice said, still thinned by pain but oddly triumphant, \"became a victim of his own pointless vindictiveness. It was a mistake which, I am certain, no member of the Machine will care to repeat.  \"Otherwise, this incident has merely served to confirm that the Mars Convicts operate under definite limitations. They _could_ kill us but can't afford to do it. If they are to thrive in space, they need Earth, and Earth's resources. They are aware that if the Machine's leadership dies, Earth will lapse into utter anarchy and turn its tremendous weapons upon itself.  \"The Mars Convicts could gain nothing from a ruined and depopulated planet. Therefore, the situation as it stands remains a draw. We shall devote every effort to turn it into a victory for us. The agreement we come to eventually with the Mars Convicts will be on our terms--and there is essentially nothing they or this man, with all his powers, can do to prevent it.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The Missionary of Oneness swung his bronzed, well-muscled legs over the side of the hammock and sat up. With an expression of great interest, he watched Spokesman Dorn coming across the sun room towards him from the entrance corridor of his hospital suite. It was the first visit he'd had from any member of the organization of the Machine in the two years he had been confined here.  For Spokesman Dorn it had been, to judge by his appearance, a strenuous two years. He had lost weight and there were dark smudges of fatigue under his eyes. At the moment, however, his face appeared relaxed. It might have been the relaxation a man feels who has been emptied out by a hard stint of work, but knows he has accomplished everything that could possibly have been done.  Dorn came to a stop a dozen feet from the hammock. For some seconds, the two men regarded each other without speaking.  \"On my way here,\" Dorn remarked then, \"I was wondering whether you mightn't already know what I've come to tell you.\"  Rainbolt shook his head.  \"No,\" he said. \"I think I could guess what it is--I pick up generalized impressions from outside--but I don't really know.\"  Spokesman Dorn considered that a moment, chewing his lower lip reflectively. Then he shrugged.  \"So actual mind-reading doesn't happen to be one of your talents,\" he said. \"I was rather sure of that, though others had a different opinion. Of course, considering what you are able to do, it wouldn't really make much difference.  \"Well ... this morning we sent out a general call by space radio to any Mars Convict ships which might be in the Solar System to come in. The call was answered. Earth's defense fields have been shut down, and the first FTL ships will land within an hour.\"  \"For what purpose?\" Rainbolt said curiously.  \"There's a strong popular feeling,\" Spokesman Dorn said, \"that your colleagues should take part in deciding what pattern Earth's permanent form of government will take. In recent months we've handled things in a rather provisional and haphazard manner, but the situation is straightened out well enough now to permit giving attention to such legalistic details. Incidentally, you will naturally be free to leave when I do. Transportation is available for you if you wish to welcome your friends at the spaceport.\"  \"Thank you,\" said Rainbolt. \"I believe I will.\"  Spokesman Dorn shrugged. \"What could we do?\" he said, almost disinterestedly. \"You never slept. In the beginning you were drugged a number of times, as you probably know, but we soon discovered that drugging you seemed to make no difference at all.\"  \"It doesn't,\" Rainbolt agreed.  \"Day after day,\" Dorn went on, \"we'd find thoughts and inclinations coming into our minds we'd never wanted there. It was an eerie experience--though personally I found it even more disconcerting to awaken in the morning and discover that my attitudes had changed in some particular or other, and as a rule changed irrevocably.\"  Rainbolt said, \"In a sense, those weren't really your attitudes, you know. They were results of the conditioning of the Machine. It was the conditioning I was undermining.\"  \"Perhaps it was that,\" Dorn said. \"It seems to make very little difference now.\" He paused, frowned. \"When the first talk of initiating change began in the councils, there were numerous executions. I know now that we were badly frightened men. Then those of us who had ordered the executions found themselves wanting similar changes. Presently we had a majority, and the changes began to be brought about. Reforms, you would call them--and reforms I suppose they actually were. There was considerable general disturbance, of course, but we retained the organization to keep that within reasonable bounds.\"  \"We expected that you would,\" Rainbolt said.  \"It hasn't really been too bad,\" Spokesman Dorn said reflectively. \"It was simply an extraordinary amount of work to change the structure of things that had been imposed on Earth by the Machine for the past century and a half. And the curious part of it is, you know, that now it's done we don't even feel resentment! We actually wouldn't want to go back to what we had before. You've obtained an incredible hold on our minds--and frankly I expect that when at last you do relinquish your control, we'll commit suicide or go mad.\"  Rainbolt shook his head. \"There's been just one mistake in what you've said,\" he remarked.  Spokesman Dorn looked at him with tired eyes. \"What's that?\" he asked.  \"I said I was undermining the conditioning of the Machine. I did--and after that I did nothing. You people simply have been doing what most of you always would have preferred to do, Spokesman. I relinquished control of the last of you over six months ago.\"         *       *       *       *       *"]]]
