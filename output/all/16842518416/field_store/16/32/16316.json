And I now bid you farewell;--here is my card--I live on the sunny side of the street, and am always at home in rainy weather!\" And so away went the shadow.  \"That was most extraordinary!\" said the learned man.  Years and days passed away, then the shadow came again.  \"How goes it?\" said the shadow.  \"Alas!\" said the learned man, \"I write about the true, and the good, and the beautiful, but no one cares to hear such things; I am quite desperate, for I take it so much to heart!\"  \"But I don't!\" said the shadow, \"I become fat, and it is that one wants to become! You do not understand the world. You will become ill by it. You must travel! I shall make a tour this summer; will you go with me?--I should like to have a travelling companion! will you go with me, as shadow? It will be a great pleasure for me to have you with me; I shall pay the travelling expenses!\"  \"Nay, this is too much!\" said the learned man.  \"It is just as one takes it!\"--said the shadow. \"It will do you much good to travel!--will you be my shadow?--you shall have everything free on the journey!\"  \"Nay, that is too bad!\" said the learned man.  \"But it is just so with the world!\" said the shadow,--\"and so it will be!\"--and away it went again.  The learned man was not at all in the most enviable state; grief and torment followed him, and what he said about the true, and the good, and the beautiful, was, to most persons, like roses for a cow!--he was quite ill at last.  \"You really look like a shadow!\" said his friends to him; and the learned man trembled, for he thought of it.  \"You must go to a watering-place!\" said the shadow, who came and visited him; \"there is nothing else for it! I will take you with me for old acquaintance' sake; I will pay the travelling expenses, and you write the descriptions--and if they are a little amusing for me on the way! I will go to a watering-place,--my beard does not grow out as it ought--that is also a sickness--and one must have a beard! Now you be wise and accept the offer; we shall travel as comrades!\"  And so they travelled; the shadow was master, and the master was the shadow; they drove with each other, they rode and walked together, side by side, before and behind, just as the sun was; the shadow always took care to keep itself in the master's place. Now the learned man didn't think much about that; he was a very kind-hearted man, and particularly mild and friendly, and so he said one day to the shadow: \"As we have now become companions, and in this way have grown up together from childhood, shall we not drink '_thou_' together, it is more familiar?\"  \"You are right,\" said the shadow, who was now the proper master. \"It is said in a very straight-forward and well-meant manner. You, as a learned man, certainly know how strange nature is. Some persons cannot bear to touch grey paper, or they become ill; others shiver in every limb if one rub a pane of glass with a nail: I have just such a feeling on hearing you say _thou_ to me; I feel myself as if pressed to the earth in my first situation with you. You see that it is a feeling; that it is not pride: I cannot allow you to say _thou_ to me, but I will willingly say _thou_ to you, so it is half done!\"  So the shadow said _thou_ to its former master.  \"This is rather too bad,\" thought he, that I must say _you_ and he say \"thou,\" but he was now obliged to put up with it.  So they came to a watering-place where there were many strangers, and amongst them was a princess, who was troubled with seeing too well; and that was so alarming!  She directly observed that the stranger who had just come was quite a different sort of person to all the others;--\"He has come here in order to get his beard to grow, they say, but I see the real cause, he cannot cast a shadow.\"  She had become inquisitive; and so she entered into conversation directly with the strange gentleman, on their promenades. As the daughter of a king, she needed not to stand upon trifles, so she said, \"Your complaint is, that you cannot cast a shadow?\"  \"Your Royal Highness must be improving considerably,\" said the shadow,--\"I know your complaint is, that you see too clearly, but it has decreased, you are cured. I just happen to have a very unusual shadow! Do you not see that person who always goes with me? Other persons have a common shadow, but I do not like what is common to all. We give our servants finer cloth for their livery than we ourselves use, and so I had my shadow trimmed up into a man: yes, you see I have even given him a shadow. It is somewhat expensive, but I like to have something for myself!\"  \"What!\" thought the princess, \"should I really be cured! These baths are the first in the world! In our time water has wonderful powers. But I shall not leave the place, for it now begins to be amusing here. I am extremely fond of that stranger: would that his beard should not grow! for in that case he will leave us.\"  In the evening, the princess and the shadow danced together in the large ball-room. She was light, but he was still lighter; she had never had such a partner in the dance. She told him from what land she came, and he knew that land; he had been there, but then she was not at home; he had peeped in at the window, above and below--he had seen both the one and the other, and so he could answer the princess, and make insinuations, so that she was quite astonished; he must be the wisest man in the whole world! she felt such respect for what he knew! So that when they again danced together she fell in love with him; and that the shadow could remark, for she almost pierced him through with her eyes. So they danced once more together; and she was about to declare herself, but she was discreet; she thought of her country and kingdom, and of the many persons she would have to reign over.  \"He is a wise man,\" said she to herself--\"It is well; and he dances delightfully--that is also good; but has he solid knowledge?--that is just as important!--he must be examined.\"  So she began, by degrees, to question him about the most difficult things she could think of, and which she herself could not have answered; so that the shadow made a strange face.  \"You cannot answer these questions?\" said the princess.  \"They belong to my childhood's learning,\" said the shadow. \"I really believe my shadow, by the door there, can answer them!\"  \"Your shadow!\" said the princess; \"that would indeed be marvellous!\"  \"I will not say for a certainty that he can,\" said the shadow, \"but I think so; he has now followed me for so many years, and listened to my conversation--I should think it possible. But your royal highness will permit me to observe, that he is so proud of passing himself off for a man, that when he is to be in a proper humor--and he must be so to answer well--he must be treated quite like a man.\"  \"Oh! I like that!\" said the princess.  So she went to the learned man by the door, and she spoke to him about the sun and the moon, and about persons out of and in the world, and he answered with wisdom and prudence.  \"What a man that must be who has so wise a shadow!\" thought she; \"It will be a real blessing to my people and kingdom if I choose him for my consort--I will do it!\"  They were soon agreed, both the princess and the shadow; but no one was to know about it before she arrived in her own kingdom.  \"No one--not even my shadow!\" said the shadow, and he had his own thoughts about it!  Now they were in the country where the princess reigned when she was at home.  \"Listen, my good friend,\" said the shadow to the learned man. \"I have now become as happy and mighty as any one can be; I will, therefore, do something particular for thee! Thou shalt always live with me in the palace, drive with me in my royal carriage, and have ten thousand pounds a year; but then thou must submit to be called shadow by all and every one; thou must not say that thou hast ever been a man; and once a-year, when I sit on the balcony in the sunshine, thou must lie at my feet, as a shadow shall do! I must tell thee: I am going to marry the king's daughter, and the nuptials are to take place this evening!\"  \"Nay, this is going too far!\" said the learned man; \"I will not have it; I will not do it! it is to deceive the whole country and the princess too! I will tell every thing!--that I am a man, and that thou art a shadow--thou art only dressed up!\"  \"There is no one who will believe it!\" said the shadow; \"be reasonable, or I will call the guard!\"  \"I will go directly to the princess!\" said the learned man.  \"But I will go first!\" said the shadow, \"and thou wilt go to prison!\" and that he was obliged to do--for the sentinels obeyed him whom they knew the king's daughter was to marry.  \"You tremble!\" said the princess, as the shadow came into her chamber; \"has anything happened? You must not be unwell this evening, now that we are to have our nuptials celebrated.\"  \"I have lived to see the most cruel thing that any one can live to see!\" said the shadow. \"Only imagine--yes, it is true, such a poor shadow-skull cannot bear much--only think, my shadow has become mad; he thinks that he is a man, and that I--now only think--that I am his shadow!\"  \"It is terrible!\" said the princess; \"but he is confined, is he not?\"  \"That he is. I am afraid that he will never recover.\"  \"Poor shadow!\" said the princess, \"he is very unfortunate; it would be a real work of charity to deliver him from the little life he has, and, when I think properly over the matter, I am of opinion that it will be necessary to do away with him in all stillness!\"  \"It is certainly hard!\" said the shadow, \"for he was a faithful servant!\" and then he gave a sort of sigh.  \"You are a noble character!\" said the princess.  The whole city was illuminated in the evening, and the cannons went off with a bum! bum! and the soldiers presented arms. That was a marriage! The princess and the shadow went out on "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31103"],["title","A Christmas Greeting: A Series of Stories (#7)"],["body","balcony to show themselves, and get another hurrah!  The learned man heard nothing of all this--for they had deprived him of life.   ------------    THE OLD STREET-LAMP.  Have you heard the story about the old street lamp? It is not so very amusing, but one may very well hear it once. It was such a decent old street-lamp, that had done its duty for many, many years, but now it was to be condemned. It was the last evening,--it sat there on the post and lighted the street; and it was in just such a humor as an old figurante in a ballet, who dances for the last evening, and knows that she is to be put on the shelf to-morrow. The lamp had such a fear of the coming day, for it knew that it should then be carried to the town-hall for the first time, and examined by the authorities of the city, who should decide if it could be used or not. It would then be determined whether it should be sent out to one of the suburbs, or in to the country to a manufactory; perhaps it would be sent direct to the ironfounder's and be re-cast; in that case it could certainly be all sorts of things: but it pained it not to know whether it would then retain the remembrance of its having been a street-lamp.  However it might be, whether it went into the country or not, it would be separated from the watchman and his wife, whom it regarded as its family. It became a street-lamp when he became watchman. His wife was a very fine woman at that time; it was only in the evening when she went past the lamp that she looked at it, but never in the daytime. Now, on the contrary, of late years, as they had all three grown old,--the watchman, his wife, and the lamp,--the wife had always attended to it, polished it up, and put oil in it. They were honest folks that married couple, they had not cheated the lamp of a single drop. It was its last evening in the street, and to-morrow it was to be taken to the town-hall; these were two dark thoughts in the lamp, and so one can know how it burnt. But other thoughts also passed through it; there was so much it had seen, so much it had a desire for, perhaps just as much as the whole of the city authorities; but it didn't say so, for it was a well-behaved old lamp--it would not insult any one, least of all its superiors. It remembered so much, and now and then the flames within it blazed up,--it was as if it had a feeling of--yes, they will also remember me! There was now that handsome young man--but that is many years since,--he came with a letter, it was on rose-colored paper; so fine--so fine! and with a gilt edge; it was so neatly written, it was a lady's hand; he read it twice, and he kissed it, and he looked up to me with his two bright eyes--they said, \"I am the happiest of men!\" Yes, only he and I knew what stood in that first letter from his beloved.  I also remember two other eyes--it is strange how one's thoughts fly about!--there was a grand funeral here in the street, the beautiful young wife lay in the coffin on the velvet-covered funeral car; there were so many flowers and wreaths, there were so many torches burning, that I was quite forgotten--out of sight; the whole footpath was filled with persons; they all followed in the procession; but when the torches were out of sight, and I looked about, there stood one who leaned against my post and wept. I shall never forget those two sorrowful eyes that looked into me. Thus there passed many thoughts through the old street-lamp, which this evening burnt for the last time. The sentinel who is relieved from his post knows his successor, and can say a few words to him, but the lamp knew not its successor; and yet it could have given him a hint about rain and drizzle, and how far the moon shone on the footpath, and from what corner the wind blew.  Now, there stood three on the kerb-stone; they had presented themselves before the lamp, because they thought it was the street-lamp who gave away the office; the one of these three was a herring's head, for it shines in the dark, and it thought that it could be of great service, and a real saving of oil, if it came to be placed on the lamp-post. The other was a piece of touchwood, which also shines, and always more than a stock-fish; besides, it said so itself, it was the last piece of a tree that had once been the pride of the forest. The third was a glow-worm; but where it had come from the lamp could not imagine; but the glow-worm was there, and it also shone, but the touchwood and the herring's head took their oaths that it only shone at certain times, and therefore it could never be taken into consideration.  The old lamp said that none of them shone well enough to be a street-lamp; but not one of them thought so; and as they heard that it was not the lamp itself that gave away the office, they said that it was a very happy thing, for that it was too infirm and broken down to be able to choose.  At the same moment the wind came from the street corner, it whistled through the cowl of the old lamp, and said to it, \"What is it that I hear, are you going away to-morrow? Is it the last evening I shall meet you here? Then you shall have a present!--now I will blow up your brain-box so that you shall not only remember, clearly and distinctly, what you have seen and heard, but when anything is told or read in your presence, you shall be so clear-headed that you will also see it.\"  \"That is certainly much!\" said the old street-lamp; \"I thank you much; if I be only not re-cast.\"  \"It will not happen yet awhile,\" said the wind; \"and now I will blow up your memory; if you get more presents than that you may have quite a pleasant old age.\"  \"If I be only not re-cast,\" said the lamp; \"or can you then assure me my memory?\"  \"Old lamp, be reasonable!\" said the wind, and then it blew. The moon came forth at the same time. \"What do you give?\" asked the wind.  \"I give nothing!\" said the moon; \"I am waning, and the lamps have never shone for me, but I have shone for the lamps.\"* So the moon went behind the clouds again, for it would not be plagued. A drop of rain then fell straight down on the lamp's cowl, it was like a drop of water from the eaves, but the drop said that it came from the grey clouds, and was also a present,---and perhaps the best of all. \"I penetrate into you, so that you have the power, if you wish it, in one night to pass over to rust, so that you may fall in pieces and become dust.\" But the lamp thought this was a poor present, and the wind thought the same. \"Is there no better--is there no better?\" it whistled, as loud as it could. A shooting-star then fell, it shone in a long stripe.  ------  * It is the custom in Denmark, and one deserving the severest censure, that, on those nights in which the moon shines; or, according to almanac authority, ought to shine, the street lamps are not lighted; so that, as it too frequently happens, when the moon is overclouded, or on rainy evenings when she is totally obscured, the streets are for the most part in perfect darkness. This petty economy is called \"the magistrates' light,\" they having the direction of the lighting, paving, and cleansing of towns.  The same management may be met with in some other countries besides Denmark.  ------  \"What was that?\" exclaimed the herring's head; \"did not a star fall right down? I think it went into the lamp! Well, if persons who stand so high seek the office, we may as well take ourselves off.\"  And it did so, and the others did so too; but the old lamp shone all at once so singularly bright.  \"That was a fine present!\" it said; \"the bright stars which I have always pleased myself so much about, and which shine so beautifully,--as I really have never been able to shine, although it was my whole aim and endeavor,--have noticed me, a poor old-lamp, and sent one down with a present to me, which consists of that quality, that everything I myself remember and see quite distinctly, shall also be seen by those I am fond of; and that is, above all, a true pleasure, for what one cannot share with others is but a half delight.\"  \"It is a very estimable thought,\" said the wind; \"but you certainly don't know that there must be wax-candles; for unless a wax-candle be lighted in you there are none of the others that will be able to see anything particular about you. The stars have not thought of that; they think that everything which shines has, at least, a wax-candle in it. But now I am tired,\" said the wind, \"I will now lie down;\" and so it lay down to rest.  The next day--yes, the next day we will spring over: the next evening the lamp lay in the arm chair,--and where? At the old watchman's. He had, for his long and faithful services, begged of the authorities that he might be allowed to keep the old lamp; they laughed at him when he begged for it, and then gave him it; and now the lamp lay in the arm-chair, close by the warm stove, and it was really just as if it had become larger on that account,--it almost filled the whole chair. The old folks now sat at their supper, and cast mild looks at the old lamp, which they would willingly have given a place at the table with them. It is true they lived in a cellar, a yard or so below ground: one had to go through a paved front-room to come into the room they lived in; but it was warm here, for there was list round the door to keep it so. It looked clean and neat, with curtains round the bed and over the small windows, where two strange-looking flowerpots stood on the sill. Christian, the sailor, had brought them from the East or West Indies; they were of clay in the form of two elephants, the backs of which were wanting: but in their place there came flourishing plants out of the earth that was in them; in the one was the finest chive,--It was the old folks' kitchen-garden,--and in the other was a large flowering geranium--this was their flower-garden. On the wall hung a large colored print of \"The Congress of Vienna;\" there they had all the kings and emperors at once. A Bornholm*"]]]
