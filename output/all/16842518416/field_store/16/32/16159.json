But as to their course when once in the open--that had seemed something so far in the distance, so difficult to contemplate, so very unlikely, that they had given it but the smallest consideration.  And now they were face to face with the difficulty and must act promptly.  \"Of course the town's out of the question,\" said Henri, taking upon himself to guide the party, for, indeed, as we have mentioned already, he knew his Germany well, just as well almost as he could speak the language, and both he and Jules were fluent.  We have described them earlier as typical Englishmen when taking a first glance at them; and we have to declare that they were just as typically French when one had the pleasure of making their acquaintance; but in the darkness, when no one could see their spruce and dapper appearance--and how many German youths can boast of being spruce and dapper?--when the voice alone could give an indication of the nationality of the speaker, then both Henri and Jules could pass muster as Germans with the greatest ease and security.  But Stuart, this big, raw-boned, healthy, red-faced individual, was typically British in build, in gesture, and in action, and when he spoke just as typically an offspring of the British peoples.  Blunt, direct, uncouth almost at times in his speech, he couldn't, had he attempted to speak German--which he did at times, and could make himself understood--have aped the guttural accents of the Teuton.  He despised the German thoroughly, detested him most cordially, and perhaps it was characteristic of his bluntness that he thoroughly detested his language.  Thus, while in the darkness Henri and Jules might hope to pass muster, in the case of Stuart there was not the smallest prospect of this.  \"We have got to keep clear of the towns, that's the first thing to be remembered,\" continued Henri; \"and my advice is that we stay in the open, right in the country, hiding up in woods in the daytime and marching during the night.  For food we shall have to do just as best we can; beg it if possible, steal it if necessary.  As to our course, it's not the time now, nor the place, in which to discuss the matter, for the first thing to do is to put as great a distance as possible between us and the camp.  To-morrow, when the light comes, our guards will send out a report broadcast, and it may be that they'll put bloodhounds on our track and endeavour to follow us.  So let's put the best foot forward and march on.  Any direction's good enough, so long as it takes us away from Ruhleben.\"  Certainly any direction was good enough which would take them away from the babel of shouts and noise which had now broken out in the camp outside which they were lying, and which told plainly enough that another alarm had been given.  Indeed, if the noise created by the discovery of the two prisoners in the depths of their tunnel had upset Ruhleben, had broken in a moment, as it were, the monotony of the existence of the unlucky individuals interned there now for so many months, the commotion at that time, which had drawn Henri and Jules and Stuart and many another to that hovel, termed a hut, in the corner beneath which was the entrance to the tunnel, was nothing to the uproar which now arose, to the shouts which echoed across the dreary camp, to the reports of rifles which men, almost too aged to work, and employed as guards, let off in every direction.  There was the twang of bullets in the air, while the darkness was punctuated by many a spot of flame, which showed where the sentries were doing duty.  That commotion brought the Commandant flaring out of his quarters again, stamping his feet with anger, bellowing with passion.  It would also have brought every one of the interned people out of his hut had not exit from them after darkness been strictly prohibited, and almost certain to be rewarded by a bullet.  But guards were free to move about--those on duty and their reliefs waiting in their barracks--and fifty or more Germans can create quite a pandemonium when sufficiently excited.  As for sounds nearer to hand, they came in plenty from the corner of the camp just within the barbed-wire fencing; for there the sentry who had challenged, and who had been heavily struck by the missiles flung by Jules and Henri, screamed with pain and terror.  Indeed, he was rather more frightened than hurt, though being hurt he made that an excuse for his outcry.  But it was from the depths of the tunnel that the most ominous sounds were emitted.  Shaken by the manner in which the lusty Stuart had thrown him through the opening, half-stunned, and not a little sick from the violent thump with which he had struck the ground, yet clinging to his senses, stung to action by fierce resentment of the treatment accorded him, and more still by the knowledge that he had been outwitted, the under-officer--that short, spare, dried-up individual who had snapped so vixenishly at the sergeant--was spluttering with wrath, was mingling his shouts with those of the sentry, and, as if that were not enough, had drawn his revolver and was blazing away at nothing.  \"Time to be going,\" said Henri, tapping Stuart on the back; for that huge individual was leaning over the ragged opening leading into the tunnel, ready to make another attack upon the German if need be.  \"Time to be going, for in a little while men will be sent all round, and may cut us off.  Come along.\"  \"Which way?  Where?  You'll lead, eh?\" asked Stuart.  \"Certainly!  This way--any way--straight in front of us--follow our noses,\" whispered Henri.  \"Certainly!  Catch hold of my coat; Jules, take hold of Stuart, and let's push on.\"  One doesn't live in a camp like Ruhleben, or, indeed, in any other camp, without taking stock of one's immediate surroundings, without spending whole hours in contemplating the scenery outside, in watching things usually of little or no interest, and in finding relaxation in beholding perhaps some figure in the distance, and wondering for minutes together who it might be, where he or she had come from, and whither the same individual was going.  Thus it happened that without any special effort Henri had noticed that a road passed near the camp at the very corner where they had made their escape, and ran right across the open into the distance.  Where precisely it went, why individuals made their way along it, and what was the destination of those who traversed the route he was unable even to guess, and questions to the sentry had received the usual gruff, if not emphatic, refusals to answer.  \"Bang straight on!  We get on to the road in a little while,\" Henri told his friends, speaking over his shoulder; \"we should, of course, keep to the open fields and make our way right across country, but it would be precious difficult during the darkness, and we should get along very much faster if we follow the road.\"  \"Half a mo'--just wait a second,\" said Stuart, now that they had gained the road.  \"Of course I am quite ready to trust myself to you, Henri, for you and Jules are sensible sort of chaps, and we know each other now thoroughly; besides, you've backed me up splendidly in this little business.  But put yourselves in the position of the Camp Commandant and of his men.  A bolt-hole has been discovered in the corner of the camp, and there's a road near; now put two and two together, and it isn't very difficult--even a German can do that,\" he added satirically, contemptuously, if you like, for, as we have said before, the lusty Stuart had but the lowest opinion of most Teutons.  \"What follows? Just this: prisoners escaping find a road, and, knowing themselves to be pursued, follow it.  First moral, keep off the road; second moral, find another; better still--make our escape in the very opposite direction.\"  It was only solid sense, British sense, horse sense as they term it in America, and, hearing him speak, Henri realized that fact immediately.  \"Splendid!\" he exclaimed enthusiastically, for he had a great opinion of the Englishman; \"of course that's the thing to do.  Well then, I've noticed that there's a road which turns away from this one a little distance ahead, and no doubt there'll be another one breaking away from that one.  Let's sprint.  A good fast run after life in a camp will be no disadvantage.\"  As a matter of fact, they were not in such soft condition as one might have anticipated, seeing that they had been confined within the barbed-wire entanglements about Ruhleben for many months past.  The keenness and energy of youth, the fact that they had many companions, had helped them to keep their muscles in tolerable order, for games had been possible and football was quite a favourite.  Hence a sprint along that road was not beyond them, and, doubling their arms and setting off at a good steady pace, they had soon contrived to put a mile between them and their late prison; then, slowing down a little till they discovered the other road, they turned into it and continued to run, and in a little while were well away from Ruhleben.  Half an hour later they turned sharply to their left again, and, alternately running and walking, covered some fifteen miles before the morning dawned.  Waiting till they had gained the top of a wooded hill, they plunged into a thick copse which offered cover, and there, as the light came, they lay down on its edge, able to survey the country all about them, feeling tolerably secure, and, let us add, amazingly hungry.     CHAPTER IV  The Heart of Germany  \"A farm, I think, and a big one by the look of it.  There should be food, and plenty of it, down there,\" said Jules, moistening his lips and springing eagerly out from the cover into the open.  Indeed, down below them, on that side of the hill where the copse was situated, a scene was spread out than which there could have been none more pleasant in France or in old England, or indeed in any other part of the world.  A"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30791"],["title","With Joffre at Verdun: A Story of the Western Front (#8)"],["body","ing, wooded landscape stretched into the far distance, broken into plots of neatly tilled fields, and intersected at one point by a river, which, winding between the hills and flowing sluggishly through forest country, disappeared in the distance, carrying on one of its banks the broad track of a railway.  In the foreground, perhaps five hundred yards away only, there was that farm to which Jules had pointed--a typical German farm, its outhouses clustered about it, cattle in its yard, and poultry feeding round it. Smoke was issuing from one of the chimneys, and it required no great imagination on the part of those three to visualize the kitchen at the other end of the chimney--a broad, stone-flagged kitchen maybe, with a deep, old-fashioned ingle-nook, and pots and pans about it.  \"Phew!  It makes a fellow's mouth water,\" declared Stuart, looking hungrily at the farm.  \"To think that there are people down there who have got plenty to eat, and here are we up here simply longing for it. I suppose it wouldn't do to venture down?\"  Henri shook his head emphatically.  \"Not as we are, certainly not,\" he declared.  \"For residence in Ruhleben hasn't exactly improved our appearance.  To begin with, Stuart--no offence, of course--you'll quite understand, a shave and haircut wouldn't come amiss, would it?  As for Jules--our dandy Jules, whose socks and turn-out were the envy of all the youth of Paris--not to mention Berlin, before the war broke out--he's hardly 'it', is he?\"  \"Oh!\"  There came an exclamation from Jules, while he grimaced at Henri.  \"Not 'it',\" he cried, and then laughed as he glanced at his own person and then back at Henri.  \"Well, a fellow has to admit that there's not one of us fit to enter decent society; but it ain't our fault, is it? Not exactly.  Only, as Henri says, it would give us away badly if we went down to the farm and demanded victuals.  Still, the fact remains that a chap can't help feeling hungry, particularly when he looks at that smoke coming from the chimney, and the fowls all round.  Couldn't a fellow slink down, knock one of them over with a stone, and bring it back?\"  Even that was out of the question, and each one of them realized it. Their only safe course, indeed, was to remain hidden as they were in that cover till the night came again, when, tramp-like, they would take to the road once more, and, tramp-like, might rob some hen-roost to provide a meal for the morrow.  Yet it was hard, and became harder still as the hours went by, to put up without even those scanty meals which had been accorded them at Ruhleben.  However, they had other things to occupy their attention when the afternoon had come, for a messenger mounted on a motor-bicycle dashed along the road, a soldier, who drew up at the farm beneath them, and, having given some message, went on his way, and could be seen calling at other farms in the far distance.  Later in the evening, other sounds from the road attracted the ears of the fugitives, and, as the dusk was settling over the country, they watched a party of weary soldiers marching by, dragging behind them a couple of bloodhounds.  These halted at the farm and presently entered it.  \"Taken up their quarters there for the night,\" said Henri, \"and I should say without a doubt that the cyclist messenger was sent to warn the farmers all round, while parties of men have been sent in various directions to try to trace us with hounds.  Not a very pleasant outlook, is it?\"  \"I shouldn't care a rap,\" declared Stuart, \"if it weren't for the hounds.  Somehow or other we will obtain food and drink, and so long as we get that we can keep on marching at night-time and can hide up during the day; but hounds can track us anywhere, and will soon drive us out of cover.  We have got to set ourselves to work to beat them. But how?  It bothers me, and I can't see a way out of the difficulty.\"  Jules whistled; he often did that when he was rather bothered.  \"Beastly idea being tracked by hounds,\" he said; \"sends a chill down a fellow's spine, and makes one's hair feel like rising.  But isn't there a way out?  If those hounds are put on our track--and it beats me how it is that they didn't discover that we had passed along the road--they'll soon trace us into this cover, unless we can, as the British say, contrive to draw a line across it which will break the scent and take them off in another direction.  What about the river?\"  \"The river, of course,\" exclaimed Henri.  \"I never gave it a thought; but of course it's the thing for us.  Why not start now; it's dark enough, and we can make our way straight down to it.  As for food, once we get across, there's a farm yonder, just behind the railway, which might easily provide something.\"  They were up on their legs by now, staring into the dusk which now covered the country, and, having discussed the matter for a few moments, and seen the wisdom of an instant move, they left the trees and trudged off across the open fields till they gained a field track, and, following that, reached the bank of the river.  Stepping in, they soon found themselves wading into deep water, and presently were forced to swim.  \"Hold on a minute,\" spluttered Henri, who was leading the party, \"don't let's go straight across; let the stream carry us downwards.\"  Flat on their backs, and keeping close together by holding hands, the trio were swept slowly down the stream till they had floated almost half a mile from the point where they had entered the water; then they struggled ashore, and, clambering up the bank and crossing the railroad, sought for the farm which they had observed from the hill-top.  Twinkling lights in the windows attracted their attention, and within half an hour they were close to it.  \"Better sit down for a moment and talk things over,\" said the cautious Stuart.  \"It wouldn't do for the whole three of us to go up to the place and demand food, and I'm rather doubtful if it 'ud do for even one of us.  You said this morning, Henri, that not one of us was over presentable, while I should say that now that our clothing is soaked we are very much more dilapidated and unpresentable.\"  \"Then suppose I go and skirmish about the place,\" Henri suggested.  \"If I happen to bump into someone, I speak German like a native and may easily be able to pass muster.  On the other hand, if I don't happen to meet anyone, I can pry about the place, and I should say that I am just as likely to be able to rob a hen-roost as you or Jules.  You stay here, and when I whistle, answer, for otherwise it will be a dickens of a job to find you.\"  Gaining a road which ran beside the railway, and from which a track led up to the farm where the lights twinkled, Henri proceeded at a rapid rate till he was within a few yards of the residence, when he made a cautious circle of it and gathered the information that one of the front rooms was illuminated, while at the back of the house there was but a feeble glimmer, and from that front room came, as he listened, the sounds of music--the notes of an organ and the deep voice of a man singing.  \"Fortunate,\" he told himself, \"for it'll drown any sounds that I may make.  First thing will be to investigate the back of the house, where there's that glimmer.  I shouldn't wonder if it was the kitchen.\"  Stealing round towards the back of the house, and passing through a wicket-gate which gave entrance to the farm-yard, he tiptoed across the cobbles of the latter, and was brought up sharply by cannoning into a barrel, which fell over with a crash.  Instantly Henri leapt against the wall and crouched in the deep shadow, fearful lest the noise should have alarmed the inmates, or, worse still, should have set some watch-dog barking; but no noise followed to tell him that his presence was detected, while, as if to give him greater assurance, the notes of the organ and that deep, manly voice came even louder to his ears, proving that those within the house had heard nothing.  \"It's a chance in a hundred,\" he told himself.  \"Here's the back door--shut and locked--eh?  No, not locked--opens easily, and--and--ah!--the twinkling light is caused by a fire--a kitchen, right enough--that looks like food; now where is it?\"  Entering the place without hesitation, he groped about till his fingers lit upon a dresser, and then upon a candle, which he lit by bending over the flames of the fire and igniting the wick.  Then he made a thorough search of the place, only to discover that there was not a scrap of food present.  However, there was a door leading out of the back of the kitchen into a small outhouse, and there he found a larder well stocked with provisions.  \"All's fair in love and war,\" he said, as he looked about him.  \"A sausage--eh, that's something--and a round of beef, which is something better.  Here's a loaf of bread, and, 'pon my word, a basket and some bottles of beer--what more does a fellow want?\"  To appropriate the articles, to pop them into the basket, to blow out the candle, and to march from the kitchen were the work of a few moments.  He slunk away from the farm, out through the wicket-gate, along the path which he had pursued, back towards the river, and then gave vent to a whistle.  There came at once an answering whistle, and, getting his direction from the sound, Henri soon found himself by his companions.  \"W--w--what have you got?\" said Jules, his teeth chattering, his words broken and shredded by the cold from which he was suffering.  Even the stalwart and healthy Stuart was no better.  \"Y--y--yes?\" he demanded, though there was no fire in his question, and but little eagerness.  \"W--w--what the d--d--dickens have you got in that b--b--basket?  Lor!  W--w--what a weight it is, and, by all the saints! b--b--beer bottles--well I'm b--b--b--blest!\"  \"You're beastly cold at any rate,\" said Henri; \"too cold by far to enjoy cold bottled beer, cold beef, and cold sausage, while I'm beautifully warm, thanks to the exercise I've been"]]]
