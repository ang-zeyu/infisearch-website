Farrel said, \"How do you feel?\"  Ralph Pornsen said, \"I feel fine.\"  Mary Pornsen said, \"Oh, I feel _wonderful_!\"  Deliberately Farrel pressed another button below his desk-top.  The dull eyes cleared instantly.  \"Oh, you've given it some thought, Doc?\" Mary said sweetly. \"And what have you decided?\"  \"You'll see,\" Farrel said. \"Eventually.\"  He rose. \"That's all for now, kids. I'd like to see you again in one month--for a routine check-up.\"  Mary nodded and got up. \"You'll still have to wait, Doc. Why not admit you're licked?\"  Ralph got up too, and looked puzzled.  \"Wow,\" he said. \"I'm tired.\"  \"Perhaps just coming here,\" Farrel said, \"discharged some of the tension you've been carrying around.\"  The Pornsens left.  Farrel brought out some papers from his desk and studied them. Then, from the file drawer, he selected the record of Hugh and Alice Farrel. Alice would be at the perfect time of her menstrual cycle tomorrow....  Farrel flipped his communicator.  \"MacGuire,\" he said. \"Tomorrow it's me.\"  MacGuire chuckled. Farrel could have kicked him. He put his chin in his hands and stared out the port. Danny Stern had the log in place in the barricade. The bulldozer was moving on to a new task. His momentary doubt stilled, Farrel went back to work.         *       *       *       *       *  Twenty-one years later, when the ships from Earth began arriving, the log had been replaced by a stone monument erected to the memory of the Exodus VII, which had been cut apart for its valuable steel. Around the monument was a park, and on three sides of the park was a shining town--not really large enough to be called a city--of plastic and stone, for New Earth had no iron ore, only zinc and a little copper. This was often cause for regret.  Still it was a pretty good world. The monster problem had been licked by high-voltage cannon. Now in their third generation since the landing, the monsters kept their distance. And things grew--things good to eat.  And even without steel, the graceful, smoothly-functioning town looked impressive--quite a thing to have been built by a handful of beings with two arms and two legs each.  It hadn't been, entirely. But nobody thought much about that any more. Even the newcomers got used to it. Things change.

INTRODUCTION.  The fifth part of a century almost has sped with the flight of time since the outbreak of the Slaveholder's Rebellion against the United States. The young men of to-day were then babes in their cradles, or, if more than that, too young to be appalled by the terror of the times.  Those now graduating from our schools of learning to be teachers of youth and leaders of public thought, if they are ever prepared to teach the history of the war for the Union so as to render adequate honor to its martyrs and heroes, and at the same time impress the obvious moral to be drawn from it, must derive their knowledge from authors who can each one say of the thrilling story he is spared to tell: “All of which I saw, and part of which I was.”  The writer is honored with the privilege of introducing to the reader a volume written by an author who was an actor and a sufferer in the scenes he has so vividly and faithfully described, and sent forth to the public by a publisher whose literary contributions in support of the loyal cause entitle him to the highest appreciation.  Both author and publisher have had an honorable and efficient part in the great struggle, and are therefore worthy to hand down to the future a record of the perils encountered and the sufferings endured by patriotic soldiers in the prisons of the enemy.  The publisher, at the beginning of the war, entered, with zeal and ardor upon the work of raising a company of men, intending to lead them to the field.  Prevented from carrying out this design, his energies were directed to a more effective service.  His famous “Nasby Letters” exposed the absurd and sophistical argumentations of rebels and their sympathisers, in such broad, attractive and admirable burlesque, as to direct against them the “loud, long laughter of a world!”  The unique and telling satire of these papers became a power and inspiration to our armies in the field and to their anxious friends at home, more than equal to the might of whole battalions poured in upon the enemy.  An athlete in logic may lay an error writhing at his feet, and after all it may recover to do great mischief.  But the sharp wit of the humorist drives it before the world's derision into shame and everlasting contempt.  These letters were read and shouted over gleefully at every camp-fire in the Union Army, and eagerly devoured by crowds of listeners when mails were opened at country post-offices.  Other humorists were content when they simply amused the reader, but “Nasby's” jests were arguments--they had a meaningthey were suggested by the necessities and emergencies of the Nation's peril, and written to support, with all earnestness, a most sacred cause.  The author, when very young, engaged in journalistic work, until the drum of the recruiting officer called him to join the ranks of his country's defenders.  As the reader is told, he was made a prisoner.  He took with him into the terrible prison enclosure not only a brave, vigorous, youthful spirit, but invaluable habits of mind and thought for storing up the incidents and experiences of his prison life.  As a journalist he had acquired the habit of noticing and memorizing every striking or thrilling incident, and the experiences of his prison life were adapted to enstamp themselves indelibly on both feeling and memory.  He speaks from personal experience and from the stand-paint of tender and complete sympathy with those of his comrades who suffered more than he did himself.  Of his qualifications, the writer of these introductory words need not speak. The sketches themselves testify to his ability with such force that no commendation is required.  This work is needed.  A generation is arising who do not know what the preservation of our free government cost in blood and suffering.  Even the men of the passing generation begin to be forgetful, if we may judge from the recklessness or carelessness of their political action.  The soldier is not always remembered nor honored as he should be.  But, what to the future of the great Republic is more important, there is great danger of our people under-estimating the bitter animus and terrible malignity to the Union and its defenders cherished by those who made war upon it.  This is a point we can not afford to be mistaken about.  And yet, right at this point this volume will meet its severest criticism, and at this point its testimony is most vital and necessary.  Many will be slow to believe all that is here told most truthfully of the tyranny and cruelty of the captors of our brave boys in blue.  There are no parallels to the cruelties and malignities here described in Northern society.  The system of slavery, maintained for over two hundred years at the South, had performed a most perverting, morally desolating, and we might say, demonizing work on the dominant race, which people bred under our free civilization can not at once understand, nor scarcely believe when it is declared unto them.  This reluctance to believe unwelcome truths has been the snare of our national life.  We have not been willing to believe how hardened, despotic, and cruel the wielders of irresponsible power may become.  When the anti-slavery reformers of thirty years ago set forth the cruelties of the slave system, they were met with a storm of indignant denial, villification and rebuke.  When Theodore D. Weld issued his “Testimony of a Thousand Witnesses,” to the cruelty of slavery, he introduced it with a few words, pregnant with sound philosophy, which can be applied to the work now introduced, and may help the reader better to accept and appreciate its statements.  Mr. Weld said:  “Suppose I should seize you, rob you of your liberty, drive you into the field, and make you work without pay as long as you lived.  Would that be justice?  Would it be kindness?  Or would it be monstrous injustice and cruelty?  Now, is the man who robs you every day too tender-hearted ever to cuff or kick you?  He can empty your pockets without remorse, but if your stomach is empty, it cuts him to the quick.  He can make you work a life-time without pay, but loves you too well to let you go hungry. He fleeces you of your rights with a relish, but is shocked if you work bare-headed in summer, or without warm stockings in winter.  He can make you go without your liberty, but never without a shirt.  He can crush in you all hope of bettering your condition by vowing that you shall die his slave, but though he can thus cruelly torture your feelings, he will never lacerate your back--he can break your heart, but is very tender of your skin.  He can strip you of all protection of law, and all comfort in religion, and thus expose you to all outrages, but if you are exposed to the weather, half-clad and half-sheltered, how yearn his tender bowels! What! talk of a man treating you well while robbing you of all you get, and as fast as you get it?  And robbing you of yourself, too, your hands and feet, your muscles, limbs and senses, your body and mind, your liberty and earnings, your free speech and rights of conscience, your right to acquire knowledge, property and reputation, and yet you are content to believe without question that men who do all this by their slaves have soft hearts oozing out so lovingly toward their human chattles that they always keep them well housed and well clad, never push them too hard in the field, never make their dear backs smart, nor let their dear stomachs get empty!”  In like manner we may ask, are not the cruelties and oppressions described in the following pages what we should legitimately expect from men who, all their lives, have used whip and thumb-screw, shot-gun and bloodhound, to keep human beings subservient to their will?  Are we to expect nothing but chivalric tenderness and compassion from men who made war on a tolerant government to make more secure their barbaric system of oppression?  These things are written because they are true.  Duty to the brave dead, to the heroic living, who have endured the pangs of a hundred deaths for their country's sake; duty to the government which depends on the wisdom and constancy of its good citizens for its support and perpetuity, calls for this “round, unvarnished tale” of suffering endured for freedom's sake.  The publisher of this work urged his friend and associate in journalism to write and send forth these sketches because the times demanded just such an expose of the inner hell of the Southern prisons.  The tender mercies of oppressors are cruel.  We must accept the truth and act in view of it.  Acting wisely on the warnings of the"]]]
