So much reason is there for what St. James says of the tongue, _It is a fire_, _a world of iniquity_, _it defileth the whole body_, _setteth on fire the course of nature_, _and is itself set on fire of hell_. {8}  This is the faculty or disposition which we are required to keep a guard upon: these are the vices and follies it runs into when not kept under due restraint.  II.  Wherein the due government of the tongue consists, or when it may be said of any one in a moral and religious sense that he _bridleth his tongue_, I come now to consider.  The due and proper use of any natural faculty or power is to be judged of by the end and design for which it was given us.  The chief purpose for which the faculty of speech was given to man is plainly that we might communicate our thoughts to each other, in order to carry on the affairs of the world; for business, and for our improvement in knowledge and learning.  But the good Author of our nature designed us not only necessaries, but likewise enjoyment and satisfaction, in that being He hath graciously given, and in that condition of life He hath placed us in.  There are secondary uses of our faculties: they administer to delight, as well as to necessity; and as they are equally-adapted to both, there is no doubt but He intended them for our gratification as well as for the support and continuance of our being.  The secondary use of speech is to please and be entertaining to each other in conversation. This is in every respect allowable and right; it unites men closer in alliances and friendships; gives us a fellow-feeling of the prosperity and unhappiness of each other; and is in several respects servicable to virtue, and to promote good behaviour in the world.  And provided there be not too much time spent in it, if it were considered only in the way of gratification and delight, men must have strange notion of God and of religion to think that He can be offended with it, or that it is any way inconsistent with the strictest virtue.  But the truth is, such sort of conversation, though it has no particular good tendency, yet it has a general good one; it is social and friendly, and tends to promote humanity, good-nature, and civility.  As the end and use, so likewise the abuse of speech, relates to the one or other of these: either to business or to conversation.  As to the former: deceit in the management of business and affairs does not properly belong to the subject now before us: though one may just mention that multitude, that heedless number of words with which business is perplexed, where a much fewer would, as it should seem, better serve the purpose; but this must be left to those who understand the matter.  The government of the tongue, considered as a subject of itself, relates chiefly to conversation; to that kind of discourse which usually fills up the time spent in friendly meetings and visits of civility.  And the danger is, lest persons entertain themselves and others at the expense of their wisdom and their virtue, and to the injury or offence of their neighbour.  If they will observe and keep clear of these, they may be as free and easy and unreserved as they can desire.  The cautions to be given for avoiding these dangers, and to render conversation innocent and agreeable, fall under the following particulars: silence; talking of indifferent things; and, which makes up too great a part of conversation, giving of characters, speaking well or evil of others.  The Wise Man observes that \"there is a time to speak, and a time to keep silence.\"  One meets with people in the world who seem never to have made the last of these observations.  And yet these great talkers do not at all speak from their having anything to say, as every sentence shows, but only from their inclination to be talking.  Their conversation is merely an exercise of the tongue: no other human faculty has any share in it.  It is strange these persons can help reflecting, that unless they have in truth a superior capacity, and are in an extraordinary manner furnished for conversation if they are entertaining, it is at their own expense.  Is it possible that it should never come into people's thoughts to suspect whether or no it be to their advantage to show so very much of themselves?  \"O that you would altogether hold your peace, and it should be your wisdom.\" {9}  Remember likewise there are persons who love fewer words, an inoffensive sort of people, and who deserve some regard, though of too still and composed tempers for you.  Of this number was the Son of Sirach: for he plainly speaks from experience when he says, \"As hills of sand are to the steps of the aged, so is one of many words to a quiet man.\"  But one would think it should be obvious to every one, that when they are in company with their superiors of any kind--in years, knowledge, and experience--when proper and useful subjects are discoursed of, which they cannot bear a part in, that these are times for silence, when they should learn to hear, and be attentive, at least in their turn. It is indeed a very unhappy way these people are in; they in a manner cut themselves out from all advantage of conversation, except that of being entertained with their own talk: their business in coming into company not being at all to be informed, to hear, to learn, but to display themselves, or rather to exert their faculty, and talk without any design at all.  And if we consider conversation as an entertainment, as somewhat to unbend the mind, as a diversion from the cares, the business, and the sorrows of life, it is of the very nature of it that the discourse be mutual.  This, I say, is implied in the very notion of what we distinguish by conversation, or being in company.  Attention to the continued discourse of one alone grows more painful, often, than the cares and business we come to be diverted from.  He, therefore, who imposes this upon us is guilty of a double offence--arbitrarily enjoining silence upon all the rest, and likewise obliging them to this painful attention.  I am sensible these things are apt to be passed over, as too little to come into a serious discourse; but in reality men are obliged, even in point of morality and virtue, to observe all the decencies of behaviour. The greatest evils in life have had their rise from somewhat which was thought of too little importance to be attended to.  And as to the matter we are now upon, it is absolutely necessary to be considered.  For if people will not maintain a due government over themselves, in regarding proper times and seasons for silence, but _will_ be talking, they certainly, whether they design it or not at first, will go on to scandal and evil-speaking, and divulging secrets.  If it were needful to say anything further to persuade men to learn this lesson of silence, one might put them in mind how insignificant they render themselves by this excessive talkativeness: insomuch that, if they do chance to say anything which deserves to be attended to and regarded, it is lost in the variety and abundance which they utter of another sort.  The occasions of silence then are obvious, and one would think should be easily distinguished by everybody: namely, when a man has nothing to say; or nothing but what is better unsaid: better, either in regard to the particular persons he is present with; or from its being an interruption to conversation itself; or to conversation of a more agreeable kind; or better, lastly, with regard to himself.  I will end this particular with two reflections of the Wise Man; one of which, in the strongest manner, exposes the ridiculous part of this licentiousness of the tongue; and the other, the great danger and viciousness of it.  _When he that is a fool walketh by the way side_, _his wisdom faileth him_, _and he saith to every one that he is a fool_. {10}  The other is, _In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin_. {11}  As to the government of the tongue in respect to talking upon indifferent subjects: after what has been said concerning the due government of it in respect to the occasions and times for silence, there is little more necessary than only to caution men to be fully satisfied that the subjects are indeed of an indifferent nature; and not to spend too much time in conversation of this kind.  But persons must be sure to take heed that the subject of their discourse be at least of an indifferent nature: that it be no way offensive to virtue, religion, or good manners: that it be not of a licentious, dissolute sort, this leaving always ill impressions upon the mind; that it be no way injurious or vexatious to others; and that too much time be not spent this way, to the neglect of those duties and offices of life which belong to their station and condition in the world.  However, though there is not any necessity that men should aim at being important and weighty in every sentence they speak: yet since useful subjects, at least of some kinds, are as entertaining as others, a wise man, even when he desires to unbend his mind from business, would choose that the conversation might turn upon somewhat instructive.  The last thing is, the government of the tongue as relating to discourse of the affairs of others, and giving of characters.  These are in a manner the same; and one can scarce call it an indifferent subject, because discourse upon it almost perpetually runs into somewhat criminal.  And, first of all, it were very much to be wished that this did not take up so great a part of conversation; because it is indeed a subject of a dangerous nature.  Let any one consider the various interests, competitions, and little misunderstandings which arise amongst men; and he will soon see that he is not unprejudiced and impartial; that he is not, as I may speak, neutral enough to trust "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3150"],["title","Human Nature, and Other Sermons (#8)"],["body","with talking of the character and concerns of his neighbour, in a free, careless, and unreserved manner.  There is perpetually, and often it is not attended to, a rivalship amongst people of one kind or another in respect to wit, beauty, learning, fortune, and that one thing will insensibly influence them to speak to the disadvantage of others, even where there is no formed malice or ill-design.  Since therefore it is so hard to enter into this subject without offending, the first thing to be observed is that people should learn to decline it; to get over that strong inclination most have to be talking of the concerns and behaviour of their neighbour.  But since it is impossible that this subject should be wholly excluded conversation; and since it is necessary that the characters of men should be known: the next thing is that it is a matter of importance what is said; and, therefore, that we should be religiously scrupulous and exact to say nothing, either good or bad, but what is true.  I put it thus, because it is in reality of as great importance to the good of society, that the characters of bad men should be known, as that the characters of good men should.  People who are given to scandal and detraction may indeed make an ill-use of this observation; but truths, which are of service towards regulating our conduct, are not to be disowned, or even concealed, because a bad use may be made of them.  This however would be effectually prevented if these two things were attended to.  First, That, though it is equally of bad consequence to society that men should have either good or ill characters which they do not deserve; yet, when you say somewhat good of a man which he does not deserve, there is no wrong done him in particular; whereas, when you say evil of a man which he does not deserve, here is a direct formal injury, a real piece of injustice done him.  This therefore makes a wide difference; and gives us, in point of virtue, much greater latitude in speaking well than ill of others. Secondly, A good man is friendly to his fellow-creatures, and a lover of mankind; and so will, upon every occasion, and often without any, say all the good he can of everybody; but, so far as he is a good man, will never be disposed to speak evil of any, unless there be some other reason for it, besides, barely that it is true.  If he be charged with having given an ill character, he will scarce think it a sufficient justification of himself to say it was a true one, unless he can also give some further account how he came to do so: a just indignation against particular instances of villainy, where they are great and scandalous; or to prevent an innocent man from being deceived and betrayed, when he has great trust and confidence in one who does not deserve it.  Justice must be done to every part of a subject when we are considering it.  If there be a man, who bears a fair character in the world, whom yet we know to be without faith or honesty, to be really an ill man; it must be allowed in general that we shall do a piece of service to society by letting such a one's true character be known.  This is no more than what we have an instance of in our Saviour himself; {12} though He was mild and gentle beyond example.  However, no words can express too strongly the caution which should be used in such a case as this.  Upon the whole matter: If people would observe the obvious occasions of silence, if they would subdue the inclination to tale-bearing, and that eager desire to engage attention, which is an original disease in some minds, they would be in little danger of offending with their tongue; and would, in a moral and religious sense, have due government over it.  I will conclude with some precepts and reflections of the Son of Sirach upon this subject.  _Be swift to hear_; _and_, _if thou hast understanding_, _answer thy neighbour_; _if not_, _lay thy hand upon thy mouth_.  _Honour and shame is in talk_.  _A man of an ill tongue is dangerous in his city_, _and he that is rash in his talk shall be hated_. _A wise man wilt hold his tongue till he see opportunity_; _but a babbler and a fool will regard no time_.  _He that useth many words shall be abhorred_; _and he that taketh to himself authority therein shall be hated_.  _A backbiting tongue hath disquieted many_; _strong cities hath it pulled down_, _and overthrown the houses of great men_.  _The tongue of a man is his fall_; _but if thou love to hear_, _thou shall receive understanding_.     SERMON V.  UPON COMPASSION.      ROM. xii. 15.     _Rejoice with them that do rejoice_, _and weep with them that weep_.  Every man is to be considered in two capacities, the private and public; as designed to pursue his own interest, and likewise to contribute to the good of others.  Whoever will consider may see that, in general, there is no contrariety between these; but that from the original constitution of man, and the circumstances he is placed in, they perfectly coincide, and mutually carry on each other.  But, among the great variety of affections or principles of actions in our nature, some in their primary intention and design seem to belong to the single or private, others to the public or social capacity.  The affections required in the text are of the latter sort.  When we rejoice in the prosperity of others, and compassionate their distresses, we as it were substitute them for ourselves, their interest for our own; and have the same kind of pleasure in their prosperity, and sorrow in their distress, as we have from reflection upon our own.  Now there is nothing strange or unaccountable in our being thus carried out, and affected towards the interests of others.  For, if there be any appetite, or any inward principle besides self-love; why may there not be an affection to the good of our fellow- creatures, and delight from that affection's being gratified, and uneasiness from things going contrary to it? {13}  Of these two, delight in the prosperity of others, and compassion for their distresses, the last is felt much more generally than the former. Though men do not universally rejoice with all whom they see rejoice, yet, accidental obstacles removed, they naturally compassionate all, in some degree, whom they see in distress; so far as they have any real perception or sense of that distress: insomuch that words expressing this latter, pity, compassion, frequently occur: whereas we have scarce any single one by which the former is distinctly expressed.  Congratulation indeed answers condolence: but both these words are intended to signify certain forms of civility rather than any inward sensation or feeling. This difference or inequality is so remarkable that we plainly consider compassion as itself an original, distinct, particular affection in human nature; whereas to rejoice in the good of others is only a consequence of the general affection of love and good-will to them.  The reason and account of which matter is this: when a man has obtained any particular advantage or felicity, his end is gained; and he does not in that particular want the assistance of another: there was therefore no need of a distinct affection towards that felicity of another already obtained; neither would such affection directly carry him on to do good to that person: whereas men in distress want assistance; and compassion leads us directly to assist them.  The object of the former is the present felicity of another; the object of the latter is the present misery of another.  It is easy to see that the latter wants a particular affection for its relief, and that the former does not want one because it does not want assistance.  And upon supposition of a distinct affection in both cases, the one must rest in the exercise of itself, having nothing further to gain; the other does not rest in itself, but carries us on to assist the distressed.  But, supposing these affections natural to the mind, particularly the last; \"Has not each man troubles enough of his own? must he indulge an affection which appropriates to himself those of others? which leads him to contract the least desirable of all friendships, friendships with the unfortunate?  Must we invert the known rule of prudence, and choose to associate ourselves with the distressed? or, allowing that we ought, so far as it is in our power to relieve them, yet is it not better to do this from reason and duty?  Does not passion and affection of every kind perpetually mislead us?  Nay, is not passion and affection itself a weakness, and what a perfect being must be entirely free from?\"  Perhaps so, but it is mankind I am speaking of; imperfect creatures, and who naturally and, from the condition we are placed in, necessarily depend upon each other.  With respect to such creatures, it would be found of as bad consequence to eradicate all natural affections as to be entirely governed by them.  This would almost sink us to the condition of brutes; and that would leave us without a sufficient principle of action.  Reason alone, whatever any one may wish, is not in reality a sufficient motive of virtue in such a creature as man; but this reason joined with those affections which God has impressed upon his heart, and when these are allowed scope to exercise themselves, but under strict government and direction of reason, then it is we act suitably to our nature, and to the circumstances God has placed us in.  Neither is affection itself at all a weakness; nor does it argue defect, any otherwise than as our senses and appetites do; they belong to our condition of nature, and are what we cannot be without.  God Almighty is, to be sure, unmoved by passion or appetite, unchanged by affection; but then it is to be added that He neither sees nor hears nor perceives things by any senses like ours; but in a manner infinitely more perfect.  Now, as it is an absurdity almost too gross to be mentioned, for a man to endeavour to get rid of his senses, "]]]
