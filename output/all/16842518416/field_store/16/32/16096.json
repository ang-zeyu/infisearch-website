I--ah--have a tolerable acquaintance with all that is going on in the art world, and I have come to the conclusion, Mr.--eh--ah--Ventimore, I repeat, the deliberate and unassisted conclusion, that you are the one man living who can do what I want.\"  \"Delighted to hear it,\" said Horace, genuinely gratified. \"When did you see any of my designs?\"  \"Never mind, sir. I don't decide without very good grounds. It doesn't take me long to make up my mind, and when my mind is made up, I act, sir, I act. And, to come to the point, I have a small commission--unworthy, I am quite aware, of your--ah--distinguished talent--which I should like to put in your hands.\"  \"Is _he_ going to ask me to attend a sale for him?\" thought Horace. \"I'm hanged if I do.\"  \"I'm rather busy at present,\" he said dubiously, \"as you may see. I'm not sure whether----\"  \"I'll put the matter in a nutshell, sir--in a nutshell. My name is Wackerbath, Samuel Wackerbath--tolerably well known, if I may say so, in City circles.\" Horace, of course, concealed the fact that his visitor's name and fame were unfamiliar to him. \"I've lately bought a few acres on the Hampshire border, near the house I'm living in just now; and I've been thinking--as I was saying to a friend only just now, as we were crossing Westminster Bridge--I've been thinking of building myself a little place there, just a humble, unpretentious home, where I could run down for the weekend and entertain a friend or two in a quiet way, and perhaps live some part of the year. Hitherto I've rented places as I wanted 'em--old family seats and ancestral mansions and so forth: very nice in their way, but I want to feel under a roof of my own. I want to surround myself with the simple comforts, the--ah--unassuming elegance of an English country home. And you're the man--I feel more convinced of it with every word you say--you're the man to do the job in style--ah--to execute the work as it should be done.\"  Here was the long-wished-for client at last! And it was satisfactory to feel that he had arrived in the most ordinary and commonplace course, for no one could look at Mr. Samuel Wackerbath and believe for a moment that he was capable of floating through an upper window; he was not in the least that kind of person.  \"I shall be happy to do my best,\" said Horace, with a calmness that surprised himself. \"Could you give me some idea of the amount you are prepared to spend?\"  \"Well, I'm no Croesus--though I won't say I'm a pauper precisely--and, as I remarked before, I prefer comfort to splendour. I don't think I should be justified in going beyond--well, say sixty thousand.\"  \"Sixty thousand!\" exclaimed Horace, who had expected about a tenth of that sum. \"Oh, not _more_ than sixty thousand? I see.\"  \"I mean, on the house itself,\" explained Mr. Wackerbath; \"there will be outbuildings, lodges, cottages, and so forth, and then some of the rooms I should want specially decorated. Altogether, before we are finished, it may work out at about a hundred thousand. I take it that, with such a margin, you could--ah--run me up something that in a modest way would take the shine out of--I mean to say eclipse--anything in the adjoining counties?\"  \"I certainly think,\" said Horace, \"that for such a sum as that I can undertake that you shall have a home which will satisfy you.\" And he proceeded to put the usual questions as to site, soil, available building materials, the accommodation that would be required, and so on.  \"You're young, sir,\" said Mr. Wackerbath, at the end of the interview, \"but I perceive you are up to all the tricks of the--I _should_ say, versed in the _minutiæ_ of your profession. You would like to run down and look at the ground, eh? Well, that's only reasonable; and my wife and daughters will want to have _their_ say in the matter--no getting on without pleasing the ladies, hey? Now, let me see. To-morrow's Sunday. Why not come down by the 8.45 a.m. to Lipsfield? I'll have a trap, or a brougham and pair, or something, waiting for you--take you over the ground myself, bring you back to lunch with us at Oriel Court, and talk the whole thing thoroughly over. Then we'll send you up to town in the evening, and you can start work the first thing on Monday. That suit you? Very well, then. We'll expect you to-morrow.\"  With this Mr. Wackerbath departed, leaving Horace, as may be imagined, absolutely overwhelmed by the suddenness and completeness of his good fortune. He was no longer one of the unemployed: he had work to do, and, better still, work that would interest him, give him all the scope and opportunity he could wish for. With a client who seemed tractable, and to whom money was clearly no object, he might carry out some of his most ambitious ideas.  Moreover, he would now be in a position to speak to Sylvia's father without fear of a repulse. His commission on £60,000 would be £3,000, and that on the decorations and other work at least as much again--probably more. In a year he could marry without imprudence; in two or three years he might be making a handsome income, for he felt confident that, with such a start, he would soon have as much work as he could undertake.  He was ashamed of himself for ever having lost heart. What were the last few years of weary waiting but probation and preparation for this splendid chance, which had come just when he really needed it, and in the most simple and natural manner?  He loyally completed the work he had promised to do for Beevor, who would have to dispense with his assistance in future, and then he felt too excited and restless to stay in the office, and, after lunching at his club as usual, he promised himself the pleasure of going to Cottesmore Gardens and telling Sylvia his good news.  It was still early, and he walked the whole way, as some vent for his high spirits, enjoying everything with a new zest--the dappled grey and salmon sky before him, the amber, russet, and yellow of the scanty foliage in Kensington Gardens, the pungent scent of fallen chestnuts and acorns and burning leaves, the blue-grey mist stealing between the distant tree-trunks, and then the cheery bustle and brilliancy of the High Street. Finally came the joy of finding Sylvia all alone, and witnessing her frank delight at what he had come to tell her, of feeling her hands on his shoulders, and holding her in his arms, as their lips met for the first time. If on that Saturday afternoon there was a happier man than Horace Ventimore, he would have done well to dissemble his felicity, for fear of incurring the jealousy of the high gods.  When Mrs. Futvoye returned, as she did only too soon, to find her daughter and Horace seated on the same sofa, she did not pretend to be gratified. \"This is taking a most unfair advantage of what I was weak enough to say last night, Mr. Ventimore,\" she began. \"I thought I could have trusted you!\"  \"I shouldn't have come so soon,\" he said, \"if my position were what it was only yesterday. But it's changed since then, and I venture to hope that even the Professor won't object now to our being regularly engaged.\" And he told her of the sudden alteration in his prospects.  \"Well,\" said Mrs. Futvoye, \"you had better speak to my husband about it.\"  The Professor came in shortly afterwards, and Horace immediately requested a few minutes' conversation with him in the study, which was readily granted.  The study to which the Professor led the way was built out at the back of the house, and crowded with Oriental curios of every age and kind; the furniture had been made by Cairene cabinet-makers, and along the cornices of the book-cases were texts from the Koran, while every chair bore the Arabic for \"Welcome\" in a gilded firework on its leather back; the lamp was a perforated mosque lantern with long pendent glass tubes like hyacinth glasses; a mummy-case smiled from a corner with laboured _bonhomie_.  \"Well,\" began the Professor, as soon as they were seated, \"so I was not mistaken--there was something in the brass bottle after all, then? Let's have a look at it, whatever it is.\"  For the moment Horace had almost forgotten the bottle. \"Oh!\" he said, \"I--I got it open; but there was nothing in it.\"  \"Just as I anticipated, sir,\" said the Professor. \"I told you there couldn't be anything in a bottle of that description; it was simply throwing money away to buy it.\"  \"I dare say it was, but I wished to speak to you on a much more important matter;\" and Horace briefly explained his object.  \"Dear me,\" said the Professor, rubbing up his hair irritably, \"dear me! I'd no idea of this--no idea at all. I was under the impression that you volunteered to act as escort to my wife and daughter at St. Luc purely out of good nature to relieve me from what--to a man of my habits in that extreme heat--would have been an arduous and distasteful duty.\"  \"I was not wholly unselfish, I admit,\" said Horace. \"I fell in love with your daughter, sir, the first day I met her--only I felt I had no right, as a poor man with no prospects, to speak to her or you at that time.\"  \"A very creditable feeling--but I've yet to learn why you should have overcome it.\"  So, for the third time, Ventimore told the story of the sudden turn in his fortunes.  \"I know this Mr. Samuel Wackerbath by name,\" said the Professor; \"one of the chief partners in the firm of Akers and Coverdale, the great estate agents--a most influential man, if you can only succeed in satisfying him.\"  \"Oh, I don't feel any misgivings about that, sir,\" said Horace. \"I mean to build him a house that will be beyond his wildest expectations, and you see that in a year I shall have earned several thousands, and I need not say that I will make any settlement you think proper when I marry----\"  \"When you are in possession of those thousands,\" remarked the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30689"],["title","The Brass Bottle (#8)"],["body","essor, dryly, \"it will be time enough to talk of marrying and making settlements. Meanwhile, if you and Sylvia choose to consider yourselves engaged, I won't object--only I must insist on having your promise that you won't persuade her to marry you without her mother's and my consent.\"  Ventimore gave this undertaking willingly enough, and they returned to the drawing-room. Mrs. Futvoye could hardly avoid asking Horace, in his new character of _fiancé_, to stay and dine, which it need not be said he was only too delighted to do.  \"There is one thing, my dear--er--Horace,\" said the Professor, solemnly, after dinner, when the neat parlourmaid had left them at dessert, \"one thing on which I think it my duty to caution you. If you are to justify the confidence we have shown in sanctioning your engagement to Sylvia, you must curb this propensity of yours to needless extravagance.\"  \"Papa!\" cried Sylvia. \"What _could_ have made you think Horace extravagant?\"  \"Really,\" said Horace, \"I shouldn't have called myself particularly so.\"  \"Nobody ever _does_ call himself particularly extravagant,\" retorted the Professor; \"but I observed at St. Luc that you habitually gave fifty centimes as a _pourboire_ when twopence, or even a penny, would have been handsome. And no one with any regard for the value of money would have given a guinea for a worthless brass vessel on the bare chance that it might contain manuscripts, which (as any one could have foreseen) it did not.\"  \"But it's not a bad sort of bottle, sir,\" pleaded Horace. \"If you remember, you said yourself the shape was unusual. Why shouldn't it be worth all the money, and more?\"  \"To a collector, perhaps,\" said the Professor, with his wonted amiability, \"which you are not. No, I can only call it a senseless and reprehensible waste of money.\"  \"Well, the truth is,\" said Horace, \"I bought it with some idea that it might interest _you_.\"  \"Then you were mistaken, sir. It does _not_ interest me. Why should I be interested in a metal jar which, for anything that appears to the contrary, may have been cast the other day at Birmingham?\"  \"But there _is_ something,\" said Horace; \"a seal or inscription of some sort engraved on the cap. Didn't I mention it?\"  \"You said nothing about an inscription before,\" replied the Professor, with rather more interest. \"What is the character--Arabic? Persian? Kufic?\"  \"I really couldn't say--it's almost rubbed out--queer little triangular marks, something like birds' footprints.\"  \"That sounds like Cuneiform,\" said the Professor, \"which would seem to point to a Phoenician origin. And, as I am acquainted with no Oriental brass earlier than the ninth century of our era, I should regard your description as, _à priori_, distinctly unlikely. However, I should certainly like to have an opportunity of examining the bottle for myself some day.\"  \"Whenever you please, Professor. When can you come?\"  \"Why, I'm so much occupied all day that I can't say for certain when I can get up to your office again.\"  \"My own days will be fairly full now,\" said Horace; \"and the thing's not at the office, but in my rooms at Vincent Square. Why shouldn't you all come and dine quietly there some evening next week, and then you could examine the inscription comfortably afterwards, you know, Professor, and find out what it really is? Do say you will.\" He was eager to have the privilege of entertaining Sylvia in his own rooms for the first time.  \"No, no,\" said the Professor; \"I see no reason why you should be troubled with the entire family. I may drop in alone some evening and take the luck of the pot, sir.\"  \"Thank you, papa,\" put in Sylvia; \"but _I_ should like to come too, please, and hear what you think of Horace's bottle. And I'm dying to see his rooms. I believe they're fearfully luxurious.\"  \"I trust,\" observed her father, \"that they are far indeed from answering that description. If they did, I should consider it a most unsatisfactory indication of Horace's character.\"  \"There's nothing magnificent about them, I assure you,\" said Horace. \"Though it's true I've had them done up, and all that sort of thing, at my own expense--but quite simply. I couldn't afford to spend much on them. But do come and see them. I must have a little dinner, to celebrate my good fortune--it will be so jolly if you'll all three come.\"  \"If we do come,\" stipulated the Professor, \"it must be on the distinct understanding that you don't provide an elaborate banquet. Plain, simple, wholesome food, well cooked, such as we have had this evening, is all that is necessary. More would be ostentatious.\"  \"My _dear_ dad!\" protested Sylvia, in distress at this somewhat dictatorial speech. \"Surely you can leave all that to Horace!\"  \"Horace, my dear, understands that, in speaking as I did, I was simply treating him as a potential member of my family.\" Here Sylvia made a private little grimace. \"No young man who contemplates marrying should allow himself to launch into extravagance on the strength of prospects which, for all he can tell,\" said the Professor, genially, \"may prove fallacious. On the contrary, if his affection is sincere, he will incur as little expense as possible, put by every penny he can save, rather than subject the girl he professes to love to the ordeal of a long engagement. In other words, the truest lover is the best economist.\"  \"I quite understand, sir,\" said Horace, good-temperedly; \"it would be foolish of me to attempt any ambitious form of entertainment--especially as my landlady, though an excellent plain cook, is not exactly a _cordon bleu_. So you can come to my modest board without misgivings.\"  Before he left, a provisional date for the dinner was fixed for an evening towards the end of the next week, and Horace walked home, treading on air rather than hard paving-stones, and \"striking the stars with his uplifted head.\"  The next day he went down to Lipsfield and made the acquaintance of the whole Wackerbath family, who were all enthusiastic about the proposed country house. The site was everything that the most exacting architect could desire, and he came back to town the same evening, having spent a pleasant day and learnt enough of his client's requirements, and--what was even more important--those of his client's wife and daughters, to enable him to begin work upon the sketch-plans the next morning.  He had not been long in his rooms at Vincent Square, and was still agreeably engaged in recalling the docility and ready appreciation with which the Wackerbaths had received his suggestions and rough sketches, their compliments and absolute confidence in his skill, when he had a shock which was as disagreeable as it was certainly unexpected.  For the wall before him parted like a film, and through it stepped, smiling benignantly, the green-robed figure of Fakrash-el-Aamash, the Jinnee.     CHAPTER VI  EMBARRAS DE RICHESSES   Ventimore had so thoroughly convinced himself that the released Jinnee was purely a creature of his own imagination, that he rubbed his eyes with a start, hoping that they had deceived him.  \"Stroke thy head, O merciful and meritorious one,\" said his visitor, \"and recover thy faculties to receive good tidings. For it is indeed I--Fakrash-el-Aamash--whom thou beholdest.\"  \"I--I'm delighted to see you,\" said Horace, as cordially as he could. \"Is there anything I can do for you?\"  \"Nay, for hast thou not done me the greatest of all services by setting me free? To escape out of a bottle is pleasant. And to thee I owe my deliverance.\"  It was all true, then: he had really let an imprisoned Genius or Jinnee, or whatever it was, out of that bottle! He knew he could not be dreaming now--he only wished he were. However, since it was done, his best course seemed to be to put a good face on it, and persuade this uncanny being somehow to go away and leave him in peace for the future.  \"Oh, that's all right, my dear sir,\" he said, \"don't think any more about it. I--I rather understood you to say that you were starting on a journey in search of Solomon?\"  \"I have been, and returned. For I visited sundry cities in his dominions, hoping that by chance I might hear news of him, but I refrained from asking directly lest thereby I should engender suspicion, and so Suleyman should learn of my escape before I could obtain an audience of him and implore justice.\"  \"Oh, I shouldn't think that was likely,\" said Horace. \"If I were you, I should go straight back and go on travelling till I _did_ find Suleyman.\"  \"Well was it said: 'Pass not any door without knocking, lest haply that which thou seekest should be behind it.'\"  \"Exactly,\" said Horace. \"Do each city thoroughly, house by house, and don't neglect the smallest clue. 'If at first you don't succeed, try, try, try, again!' as one of our own poets teaches.\"  \"'Try, try, try again,'\" echoed the Jinnee, with an admiration that was almost fatuous. \"Divinely gifted truly was he who composed such a verse!\"  \"He has a great reputation as a sage,\" said Horace, \"and the maxim is considered one of his happiest efforts. Don't you think that, as the East is rather thickly populated, the less time you lose in following the poet's recommendation the better?\"  \"It may be as thou sayest. But know this, O my son, that wheresoever I may wander, I shall never cease to study how I may most fitly reward thee for thy kindness towards me. For nobly it was said: 'If I be possessed of wealth and be not liberal, may my head never be extended!'\"  \"My good sir,\" said Horace, \"do please understand that if you were to offer me any reward for--for a very ordinary act of courtesy, I should be obliged to decline it.\"  \"But didst thou not say that thou wast sorely in need of a client?\"  \"That was so at the time,\" said Horace; \"but since I last had the pleasure of seeing you, I have met with one who is all I could possibly wish for.\"  \"I am indeed rejoiced to hear it,\" returned the Jinnee, \"for thou showest me that I have succeeded in performing"]]]
