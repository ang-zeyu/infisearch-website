The openings for the internal nares, the ventral orbital fenestrae, and the subtemporal fossae are readily recognized. The quadrate processes extend posteriorly leaving a large gap medially at the posterior end of the skull.  [Illustration: FIG. 4. _Hesperoherpeton garnettense_ Peabody. Palate reconstructed; ventral aspect at left, showing teeth, dorsal aspect at right. KU 10295, × 4.]  The left quadrate appears to be in place on the posterior prong of the pterygoid. The dorsal side of the quadrate is grooved between two anterolaterally directed ridges. The groove, which probably held the end of the stapes, extends about half the width of the quadrate itself. The width of the quadrate is 4.0 mm., the length is 4.5 mm. medially and about 2.0 mm. laterally. In ventral view the quadrate appears to project laterally, but is incomplete and its shape uncertain. The distance from the posterior end of the quadrate to the visible posterior edge of the orbital fenestra, which opens ventrally, is 10.0 mm.  This region between the quadrate and the orbit is occupied by a pterygoid with three projections. Anteriorly, the pterygoid outlines most of the posterior edge of the orbit (a distance of about 6.5 mm.). A lateral process separates the orbit from the subtemporal fossa. A posteriorly directed edge defines the fossa, which extends about 6.5 mm. anteroposteriorly. The lateral process of the pterygoid terminates 10.0 mm. from the midline. Both the lateral and posterior pterygoid processes are approximately 2.0 mm. wide. The greatest width of the subtemporal fossa is about 2.0 mm. The medial border of the orbital fenestra is missing, but apparently consisted of the pterygoid for at least the posterior half.  Along the posterior edge of the orbital fenestra, there is a narrow, dorsally projecting flange of the pterygoid. The lateral opening of the orbit is approximately 7.5 mm. wide.  The remaining border of the orbital fenestra on the anterior and medial sides is formed by a bone occupying the position of palatine and vomer; for convenience we designate this as palatine. When reconstructed in its probable position in relation to the pterygoid, the left palatine lacks a section, on its medial and posterior edges, measuring about 2.5 mm. by 9.0 mm. The lateral margin of the palatine is convex; about 5.5 mm. anterior to the orbit this margin curves into a strong anteriorly pointing projection, medial to which is seen the internal narial opening. The remaining anterior edge is slightly convex, smoothly rounded, and meets the midline about 9.0 mm. anterior to the pterygoid.  The void area medial to the palatine and anterior to the pterygoid does not fit any bone which we can recognize as the parasphenoid. It is thus suspected that this area is covered in part by the missing edge of the palatine and partly by an anteromedial extension of the pterygoid. Of course a parasphenoid may also have been present.  The position, length, and shape of the premaxillary shown in palatal view (Fig. 4) are primarily based upon the dorsal appearance since ventrally most of it cannot be seen. At the point where it forms the anterior border of the internal naris, the premaxillary is slightly wider than the maxillary and seems to become narrower as it approaches the midline.  The ethmosphenoid, which we cannot identify, may have been exposed in a gap between the premaxillary and the palatine. The gap measures approximately 8.0 mm. wide and ranges up to 1.0 mm. anteroposteriorly.  The maxillary begins at a suture with the premaxillary lateral to the naris and continues posteriorly, bordering the orbit with a width of about 1.2 mm. It then tapers to a point approximately 2.0 mm. anterior to the lateral projection of the pterygoid. The width of the maxillary at this point is 0.8 mm. and the posterior end is broken; probably when complete it approached the pterygoid, and either met the latter or had a ligamentous connection with it. As nearly as can be determined, the total length of the maxillary is approximately 12.0 mm.  The teeth on the maxillary are small and seem to be in two longitudinal rows. The palatine bears two large, grooved teeth anteriorly; the first is approximately 1.0 mm. posteromedial to the naris and the second is about 3.0 mm. posterior and slightly lateral to the naris. The flat ventral surfaces of the palatine and pterygoid bear numerous small teeth distributed as shown in Fig. 4.  _Braincase and Occipital Region_ (Fig. 5)  The parts of the neurocranium are scattered, disconnected and incomplete, but it is possible to make out a number of features of the otico-occipital section with fair assurance. In posterior view the notochordal canal and foramen magnum are confluent with each other, and of great size relative to the skull as a whole. The notochordal canal measures 2.8 mm. in diameter, and the foramen magnum about 4.0 mm. The crescent-shaped supraoccipital rests on the upright ends of the exoccipitals, but between the latter and the basioccipital no sutures can be seen. Probably the whole posterior surface of the braincase slanted posteroventrally; consequently the rim of the notochordal canal was about 3.0 mm. behind the margin of the parietals.  The U-shaped border of the notochordal canal is a thick, rounded bone, comparable in appearance to the U-shaped intercentra of the vertebrae. This bone apparently rested upon a thinner, troughlike piece (Fig. 5 B) forming the floor of the braincase. The latter is broad, shallow, concave, open midventrally and narrowing anteriorly to form a pair of articular processes. Since no sutures can be seen in this structure, it probably is the ventral, ossified portion of the basioccipital. Watson (1926, Fig. 4 B) illustrates the floor of the braincase in _Eusthenopteron_, with its more lateral, anterior portion labelled prootic, but in our specimen the corresponding part could scarcely have formed the anterior wall of the otic capsule, being entirely in the plane of the floor. The two articular surfaces anteriorly near the midline suggest that a movable joint existed between the otico-occipital part of the braincase and the ethmosphenoid part, as in Rhipidistia (Romer, 1937). We have found nothing in the specimen that could be referred to the ethmosphenoid; it may have been unossified.  [Illustration: FIG. 5. _Hesperoherpeton garnettense_ Peabody, KU 10295, × 4. A, occipital view of skull; B, basioccipital bone in dorsal (internal) view.]  The otic capsules appear to have rested against lateral projections of the basioccipital. The single otic capsule that can be seen (the right) is massively built, apparently ossified in one piece, with a shallow dorsomedial excavation, probably the vestige of a supratemporal fossa. On the lateral face is a broad, shallow depression dorsally, and a narrower, deeper one anteroventrally; these we suppose to have received the broader and narrower heads of the stapes, respectively. The posterior wall of the otic capsule we have designated opisthotic in the figure. Anterior to the otic capsule the lateral wall of the braincase cannot be seen, and may not have been ossified.  The roof of the braincase is visible in its ventral aspect, extending from approximately the occipital margin to a broken edge in front of the parietal foramen, and laterally to paired processes which overlie the otic capsules directly behind the orbits (see dotted outlines in Fig. 1). Each of these postorbital processes, seen from beneath, appears to be the lateral extension of a shallow groove beginning near the midline. Presumably this section of the roof is an ossification of the synotic tectum. It should be noted that the roof of the braincase proper is perfectly distinct from the overlying series of dermal bones, and that the parietal foramen can be seen in both. The roof of the braincase in our specimen seems to have been detached from the underlying otic capsules and the occipital wall.  The bone that we take to be the stapes is blunt, flattened (perhaps by crushing), 5.0 mm. in length, and has two unequal heads; its width across both of these is 4.0 mm. The length is appropriate to fit between the lateral face of the otic capsule and the dorsal edge of the quadrate; the wider head rests on a posterodorsal concavity on the otic capsule, and the smaller fits a lower, more anterior pit. Laterally the stapes carries a short, broad process that probably made contact with a dorsally placed tympanic membrane. Thus the bone was a hyomandibular in the sense that it articulated with the quadrate, but it may also have served as a stapes in sound-transmission. It contains no visible canal or foramen.  _Mandible_ (Fig. 6)  The crushed inner surface of the posterior part of the left mandible and most of the external surface of the right mandible are preserved in close proximity. Although the whole length of the tooth-bearing margins is missing, some parts of six elements of the right mandible can be seen. The pattern of sutures and the general contour closely resemble those of _Megalichthys_ (Watson, 1926, Figs. 37, 38) and other known Rhipidistia.  The anteroposterior length of the mandible is about 23.8 mm., and the depth is 3.8 mm. The dentary extends approximately 17.6 mm. back from the symphysis, and its greatest width is probably 2.0 mm. Its lower edge meets all the other lateral bones of the jaw. The splenial and postsplenial form the curved anteroventral half of the jaw for a distance of about 9.0 mm. The fragmented articular, on the posterior end of the jaw, is 4.0 mm. long and 2.0 mm. deep, exhibiting a broken upper edge; presumably the surface for articulation with the quadrate was a shallow concavity, above the end of the articular.

It is possible, nevertheless, to see that the trunk vertebrae resemble those of Ichthyostegalia (Jarvik, 1952, Fig. 13 A, B), except that the pleurocentra are much larger. A few parts of additional vertebrae can be seen, but they are so scattered that it is impossible to be sure of their original location. Therefore comparisons between different regions cannot yet be made.  The U-shaped intercentrum encloses the notochord and occupies an anteroventral position in the vertebra. Anteriorly, each intercentrum articulates with the pleurocentra of the next preceding vertebra by slightly concave surfaces. Dorsolaterally there is an articular surface for the capitulum of the rib.  The two pleurocentra of each vertebra are separate ventrally as well as dorsally, but form thin, broad plates of about the same height as the notochord. The lateral surface appears to be depressed, allowing, perhaps, for movement of the rib. Above each pleurocentrum, on the lateral surface of the neural arch, there is a short diapophysis for articulation with the tuberculum of the rib.  The margin of the neural spine is convex anteriorly and concave posteriorly, the tip reaching a point vertically above the postzygapophysis. The prezygapophysis of each vertebra articulates with the preceding postzygapophysis by a smooth dorsal surface. One nearly complete neural arch shows (Fig. 7 B) a pit above the neural canal, clearly corresponding to the canal for a dorsal ligament shown by Jarvik in _Ichthyostega_. Indeed this view of the neural arch and intercentrum together brings out the striking resemblance between the vertebrae of _Hesperoherpeton_ and those of the Ichthyostegids. The rounded intercentrum in both is an incomplete ring enclosing the notochordal canal.  [Illustration: FIG. 7. _Hesperoherpeton garnettense_ Peabody.

The dorsal portion of this neural arch is not present (either broken or not yet ossified), but the opening of the neural canal is comparable in width to the foramen magnum. Hence this vertebra may be one of the most anterior in the column. In comparison with the trunk vertebrae seen farther posteriorly it appears that there may be a progressive ossification of neural arches toward their dorsal ends, and of intercentra around the notochord, with probable fusion of the intercentra and neural arches in the posterior part of the trunk. The notochord seems to have been slightly constricted by the intercentra, but not interrupted.   RIBS  The proximal ends of the ribs expand dorsoventrally to a width approximately four times that of their slender shafts. The tuberculum and capitulum on each of the trunk ribs are separated only by a shallow concavity. These two articular surfaces are so situated that the rib must tilt downward from the horizontal plane. The shaft flares terminally in some ribs, and the distal end is convex. Ribs in the trunk region differ little if any in size. Five that can be measured vary in length from 5.0 to 7.0 mm. One short, bent rib 3.5 mm. long perhaps is sacral or caudal.   PECTORAL GIRDLE (Figs. 8, 9, 10)  The right scapulocoracoid is almost complete, and the left one is present but partly broken into three pieces, somewhat pushed out of position. With the advantage of this new material, we may comment on the scapulocoracoid of _H. garnettense_ as described by Peabody (1958). In size and contour, the slight differences between the type (KU 9976) and the new skeleton (KU 10295) are considered to be no more than individual variation. We have redrawn the type (Fig. 8) in order to show the resemblances more clearly.  The small sections that were missing from the type are present in KU 10295. The jagged edge directly posterior to the area occupied by the neural arch in the type extends 0.5 mm. farther back in our specimen. The angle formed between the recurved dorsal ramus and the edge of the ventral flange is seen in our specimen to be less than 90°. The glenoid fossa, appearing as a concave articular surface for the cap of the humerus, was in part covered by cartilage and shows as \"unfinished\" bone (Peabody, 1958, p. 572); this area is more oval than triangular, as Peabody thought. The obstruction of a clear view of this part of the type is the result of the accidental position of a neural arch. The raised portion immediately dorsal to the glenoid fossa exhibits an unfinished surface, suggesting the presence of either cartilage or a ligament.  [Illustration: FIG. 8. _Hesperoherpeton garnettense_ Peabody. Type specimen redrawn. Right scapulocoracoid in external view (at left), and internal view (at right). KU 9976, × 4.]   [Illustration: FIG. 9. _Hesperoherpeton garnettense_ Peabody. Right scapulocoracoid in external view, showing part of interclavicle, and position occupied by clavicle. The specimen is flattened and lies entirely in one plane. KU 10295, × 4.]   [Illustration: FIG. 10. _Hesperoherpeton garnettense_ Peabody. Right clavicle in external view. Anterior edge to right. KU 10295, × 4.]  The right clavicle is complete, and resembles a spoon having a slender handle. The dorsal tip of the handle is L-shaped. The expanded ventral part is convex externally, and rested upon the anteroventral surface of the scapulocoracoid. The lateral edge next to the \"stem\" is distinctly concave, abruptly becoming similar in contour to the opposite edge, and giving the impression of an unsymmetrical spoon. The left clavicle is present in scattered fragments, its dorsal hooklike end being intact.  The posterior end of the interclavicle lies in contact with the right scapulocoracoid. There are short lateral processes at the point where the interclavicle was overlapped by the clavicles, but we cannot be sure of the extent of this bone anteriorly or posteriorly.  The presumed left cleithrum, a long rectangle, is approximately equal in length to the rodlike stem of the clavicle, and is about as wide as the dorsal L-shaped tip of the clavicle. The posterior end of the cleithrum presumably met the tip of the clavicle, while the rest of it was directed anteriorly and a little dorsally. There seems to be a small articular surface near the anterior extremity which suggests the presence of a supracleithrum. The upper border of the cleithrum is slightly convex and the lower concave.   FORELIMB (Fig. 11)  The left forelimb is the only one present and appears to be nearly complete, although the elements are scattered almost at random. The only parts of the forelimb known to be missing are two subterminal and two terminal phalanges, probably of the first and third digits, and the proximal end of the second metacarpal. The smooth and relatively flat surfaces suggest an aquatic rather than terrestrial limb; only the proximal half of the humerus bears any conspicuous ridges or depressions. As we restore the skeleton of the limb, several features are remarkable: The humerus, ulna, and ulnare align themselves as the major axis of the limb, each carrying on its posterior edge a process or flange comparable to those in the axial series of a rhipidistian fin. The remaining elements take positions comparable to the diagonally placed preaxial radials in such a fin. The digits appear to have been short, perhaps with no more than two phalanges. There is only one row of carpals present (the proximal row of other tetrapods). A second and third row would be expected in primitive Amphibia; if they existed in _Hesperoherpeton_ they must either have been wholly cartilaginous or washed away from the specimen. Neither of these alternatives seems at all likely to us in view of the well-ossified condition of the elements that are present, and the occurrence of both the proximal carpals and the metacarpals. The space available for metacarpals probably could not have contained more than the four that are recognized.  [Illustration: FIG. 11. _Hesperoherpeton garnettense_ Peabody. Left forelimb, showing characters of both a crossopterygian fin and an amphibian foot. KU 10295, × 4.]  The proximal end of the humerus is more rounded anteriorly than posteriorly, and has a thin articular border that bore a cartilaginous cap as the primary surface for articulation with the scapulocoracoid. Although the unfinished surface of the head extends down the anterior margin about a third the length of the humerus, the shaft has been broken and so twisted that the distal part is not in the same plane as the proximal."]]]
