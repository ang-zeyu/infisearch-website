It is of more than passing interest to realize that these structural principles of music were worked out in the same locality--Northern France and the Netherlands, and by kindred intellects--as witnessed the growth of Gothic architecture; and there is a fundamental affinity between the interweavings of polyphonic or, as it is often called, _contrapuntal_[14] music and the stone traceries in medieval cathedrals. During the 13th and 14th centuries northern France, with Paris as its centre, was the most cultivated part of Europe, and the Flemish cities of Cambrai, Tournai, Louvain and Antwerp will always be renowned in the history of art, as the birthplace of Gothic architecture, of modern painting and of polyphonic music.[15] A great deal of the impetus towards the systematic repetition of the voice parts must have been caused by practical necessity (thus justifying the old adage); for, before the days of printed music, or even of a well-established tradition--when everything had to be laboriously written out or transmitted orally--whole compositions could be rendered by the singers through the simple device of remembering the introductory theme and joining in from memory whenever their turn came. Compositions in fact were often so recorded.[16] The following old English round (circa 1609) shows clearly how the voices entered in rotation.  [Music:  1 Three blind mice, three blind mice  2 ran around thrice, ran around thrice; The  3 miller and his merry old wife ne'er laugh'd so much in all their life.]  For a Round in strict canonic imitation by the famous English composer William Byrd (1542-1623) see the Supplement, Example No. 2. In due time singers of that period became likewise very proficient in improvising free parts about a given melody or _cantus firmus_, a practice indicated by the term \"musica ficta\" which was beneficial in stimulating the imagination to a genuine musical activity.  [Footnote 10: In comparatively recent times the term has been widened to include music in which there is one _chief_ melody to which other portions of the musical texture are subordinate; _e.g._, the homophonic style of Chopin in whose works the chief melody, often in the upper voice, seems to float on underlying waves of sound.]  [Footnote 11: For a complete account of these early attempts which finally led to part-writing see Chapter IV in the first volume of the _Oxford History of Music_.]  [Footnote 12: An historical account of this development as far as it is ascertainable may be found in the fifth chapter of Pratt's _History of Music_.]  [Footnote 13: Consult the article on the Round in _Grove's Dictionary_.]  [Footnote 14: A rather crude English adaptation of the Latin term \"Punctus contra punctum\" which refers to the notes as punct[=u]s (plural) or dots which were pricked with a stylus into the medieval manuscripts. In this phrase the emphasis is on the _contra_, signifying a combination of _different_ melodies and rhythms, and calling attention to that higher importance which, everywhere in art, is caused by contrasted elements.]  [Footnote 15: For an interesting account of this tripartite activity see Naumann's _History of Music_.]  [Footnote 16: See the facsimile of the original manuscript of \"_Sumer is icumen in_\" cited in the first volume of the _Oxford History of Music_, pp. 326-332.]  We can now begin to realize the importance of polyphonic music. In fact, it is not too much to assert that _systematic repetition_ in some form or other (several aspects of which we shall describe in due season) is the most important constructive principle in music, necessitated by the very nature of the material. This statement can be corroborated by a glance at almost any page of music considered merely as a _pattern_, quite regardless how the notes sound. We observe at once that some portions of the page look much or exactly like other portions. Frequently whole movements or long parts of a work are based entirely upon some terse and characteristic motive. Famous examples of this practise are the first movement of Beethoven's _Fifth Symphony in C minor_ which, with certain subsidiary themes to afford contrast, is entirely based on the motive:  [Music]  the Finale of Wagner's opera _The Valkyrie_ (see Supplement, Example No. 3) the chief motive of which  [Music]  is presented in every phase of modulatory and rhythmic development, and the middle portion of the _Reconnaissance_ from Schumann's _Carnaval_ (see Supplement, Example No. 4.)  Music, just because its substance is so elusive and requires such alert attention on the part of the listener, cannot continually present new material[17] without becoming diffuse; but instead, must make its impression by varied emphasis upon the main thought. Otherwise it would become so discursive that one could not possibly follow it. From these historical facts as to the structure of music certain inferences may be drawn; the vital importance of which to the listener can hardly be exaggerated. As polyphonic treatment (the imitation and interweaving of independent melodic lines) is the foundation of any large work of music, be it symphony, symphonic poem or string quartet, so the listener must acquire what may be called a _polyphonic ear_. For with the majority of listeners, the whole difficulty and the cause of their dissatisfaction with so-called \"classic music\" is merely lack of equipment. Everyone can hear the tune in the soprano or upper voice, for the intensity of pitch makes it stand out with telling effect; and, as a fact, many of the best tunes in musical literature are so placed. But how about the tune when it is in the _bass_ as is the case so frequently in Beethoven's Symphonies or in Wagner's Operas? Some of the most eloquent parts of the musical message are, indeed, often in the bass, the foundation voice, and yet these are entirely ignored by the average listener. Then what of the inner voices; and what--most important of all--when there are beautiful melodies in _all parts_ of the musical fabric, often sounding simultaneously, as in such well-known works as César Franck's _Symphony in D minor_ and Wagner's _Prelude to the Mastersingers_! As we face these questions squarely the need for the listener of special training in alertness and concentration is self-evident. A very small proportion of those who attend a symphony concert begin to get their money's worth--to put the matter on a perfectly practical plane--for at least 50% of the musical structure is presented to ears without capacity for receiving it. In regard to any work of large dimensions the final test is this: can we sing all the themes and follow them in their polyphonic development? Then only are we really acquainted with the work; then only, in regard to personal like or dislike, have we any right to pass judgment upon it. The absurd attitude, far too common, of hasty, ill-considered criticism is illustrated by the fact that while Brahms is said to have worked for ten years on that Titanic creation, his _First Symphony_, yet persons will hear it _once_ and have the audacity to say they do not like it. As well stroll through Chartres Cathedral and say they did not think much of it!  [Footnote 17: For a simple, charming example of persistent use of a motive see Schumann's pianoforte piece _Kind im Einschlummern_, No. 12 of the _Kinderscenen_.]  We must now speak of the two other manifestations of the principle of _repetition_. Fundamentally, to be sure, they are not connected with polyphonic music; the third type, in fact,--restatement after contrast--being instinctively worked out in the Folk-Song (as will be made plain later) and definitely ratified as a structural principle by the Italian opera composer Alessandro Scarlatti in the well-known Aria da capo. These further applications of the principle of imitation are _Transposition_, _i.e._, the repetition of the melodic outline, and often of the whole harmonic fabric, by shifting it up or down the scale; and the _Restatement_ of the original melody after an intervening part in contrast, thus making a piece of music, the formula for which may be indicated by A, B, Á. Anyone at all familiar with musical literature must have observed both of these devices for securing coherence and organic unity; in fact, the principle of restatement after contrast is at the foundation of any large work, and supplies the connecting link between the structure of the Folk-Song and that of the most elaborate modern music. A convincing illustration of the use of Transposition may be found in Schumann's _Arabesque_,  [Music]  and in the opening theme of Beethoven's _Waldstein Sonata_, op. 53.  [Music]  It was a favorite device of Beethoven to impress the main theme upon the hearer by definite repetitions on various degrees of the scale.[18] For an elaborate example of Transposition nothing can surpass the opening movement of César Franck's _D Minor Symphony_, the entire first part of which consists of a literal repetition in F minor of what has been previously announced in D minor.  [Footnote 18: Another well-known example is the first theme of the first movement of the _Sonata in F minor_ (_Appassionata_) op. 57. This the student can look up for himself.]  Pieces of music which embody the principle of _Restatement after Contrast_ are so numerous that the question is merely one of selecting the clearest examples. In the Folk-Songs of every nation, as soon as they had passed beyond the stage of a monotonous reiteration of some phrase which pleased the fancy, _e.g._  [Music: _ad infinitum!_]  we find hardly one in which there is not a similarity between the closing measures and something which had gone before. (See Supplement, Example No. 5.) For the most elementary artistic experience would establish the fact that the only way to avoid a monotonous repetition of the same theme is to change"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30560"],["title","Music: An Art and a Language (#4)"],["body"," a different one. And the next step is equally axiomatic--that, presupposing the first theme gives pleasure on its initial appearance, it will be heard with heightened pleasure at its reappearance after intervening contrast. A psychological principle is herein involved which cannot be proved but which is self-justified by its own reasonableness and is further exemplified by many experiences in daily life. Sweet things taste the sweeter after a contrast with something acid; we like to revisit old scenes and to return home after a vacation. No delight is keener than the _renewal_ of some aesthetic experience after its temporary effacement through a change of appeal.[19] This practice is associated with the inherent demand, spoken of above, for Variety in Unity. No theme is of sufficient import to bear constant repetition; in fact, the more eloquent it is, the more sated should we become if it were continued overlong. Monotony, furthermore, is less tolerable in music than in the other arts because music cuts deeper, because the ear is so sensitive an organ and because we have no way of shutting off sound. If a particular sight or scene displeases, we can close our eyelids; but the ear is entirely unprotected and the only way to escape annoying sounds is to take to flight.[20] We inevitably crave contrast, change of sensation; and nothing gives more organic unity than a return to whatever impressed us at the outset. This cyclic form of musical expression, early discovered through free experimentation, has remained the leading principle in all modern works, and--because derived directly from life and nature--must be permanent. We return whence we came; everything goes in circles. We can now understand still more the need of a strong and accurate memory; for if we do not know whether or not we have ever heard a theme, obviously the keen pleasure of welcoming it anew is lost to us. Furthermore, this principle of Restatement has in modern music some very subtle uses, and presupposes the acquisition of a real power of reminiscence. For example, Wagner's tone-drama of _Tristan and Isolde_ begins with this haunting motive  [Music]  which, with its dual melodic lines, typifies the passionate love of the two chief characters in the story. After three hours or more of tragic action and musical development this motive is again introduced in the very closing measures of the drama, to show that even in the presence of transfiguring death this love is still their guiding power.  [Music]  [Footnote 19: For some additional comments on this broad principle see the first Chapter (passim) of Parry's _Evolution of the Art of Music_.]  [Footnote 20: Everyone has experienced the agony of hearing the beginner practice, in an adjoining room, the same piece for hours at a time!]  For those who can appreciate the significance of such treatment, this reminiscence is one of the most sublime touches in all musical drama. The fascinating orchestral Scherzo of Richard Strauss's _Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks_ likewise begins with a characteristic motto,  [Music]  which says, in the language of music--I now have a story to tell you of a certain freakish character; and then we are regaled with the musical portrayal of a series of Till's pranks. As an Epilogue, Strauss improvises on this opening theme as much as to say--you have listened to my musical story, now let us indulge in some reflections as to the fate of poor Till, for after all he was a good fellow. (See Supplement, Example No. 6.)  It is evident, therefore, from the foregoing examples that the basic principles of musical structure are coherence, refreshing variety and such unity of general impression as may be gained chiefly by a restatement, after contrast, of themes previously heard. Our subsequent study will simply illustrate these natural laws of music in their wider application.     CHAPTER II  THE FOLK-SONG   In the preceding chapter we made some general inquiries into the nature of music and of those methods by which emotion and thought are expressed. We shall assume therefore that the following facts are established: that in music, by reason of the intangibility and elusiveness of the material, sound and rhythm, the principle of Unity in Variety is of paramount importance; and that the hearer, if he would grasp the message expressed by these sounds and rhythms, must make a _conscious_ effort of coöperation and not be content with mere dreamy apathy. Furthermore, that Unity and Coherence are gained in music by applying the principle of systematic Repetition or Imitation. (We shall see, as we continue, how Variety has been secured by contrasting themes, by episodical passages and by various devices of rhythmic and harmonic development.)  We may now investigate the growth of musical structure and expression, as manifested in the fields of the Folk-Song and of Polyphonic music, beginning with the Folk-Song--historically the older and more elemental in its appeal. We cannot imagine the time when human beings did not use their voices in some form of emotional outpouring; and, as far back as there are any historical records, we find traces of such activity. For many centuries these rude cries of savage races were far removed from anything like artistic design, but the advance towards coherence and symmetry was always the result of free experimentation--hence vitally connected with the emotions and mental processes of all human effort. One of the most significant of the many sayings attributed to Daniel Webster is that \"Sovereignty rests with the people\"; and it is an interesting inquiry to see what wider application may be made of this statement in the field of art. For it is a fact that there has seldom been an important school of music, so-called--in any given place and period--which was not founded on the emotional traits, the aspirations and the ideals of the people. Surely one of the distinct by-products of the Great War is to be the emancipation of the art of music, along with that of all the other arts. Such a realization of its nature and powers will result that it shall no longer be a mere exotic amusement of the leisure and wealthy classes, but shall be brought into direct touch with the rank and file of the people; even, if you will, with the so-called \"lower classes\"--that part of humanity from which, indeed, it sprung and with which it really belongs--just human beings, just people. So in music also we may assert that \"Sovereignty rests with the people.\" Although all art reflects popular sentiment to a certain extent, in no one of the arts--as painting, sculpture and architecture--is there such a vital record of the emotions and artistic instincts of humanity as we find in the realm of folk-song.[21] During the early period of Church music, while theorists and scholars were struggling with the intricate problems of polyphonic style, the people in their daily secular life were finding an outlet for their emotions, for their joys and sorrows, in song and in dance. This instinct for musical expression is universal, and just because the products of such activity were unfettered by rules, they exercised in process of time much influence upon the development of modern style. Folk-songs are characterized by a freshness and simplicity, a directness of utterance, which are seldom attained by the conscious efforts of genius. \"Listen carefully to all folk-songs,\" says Schumann. \"They are a storehouse of beautiful melody, and unfold to the mind the innate character of the different peoples.\" They are like wild flowers blooming unheeded by the wayside, the product of the race rather than the individual, and for centuries were only slightly known to cultivated musicians. It should be understood that words and music were inextricably bound together and that, with both, dancing was naturally associated; the very essence of a people's life being expressed by this tripartite activity. Tonal variety is a marked feature in folk-songs, many of them being in the old Gregorian modes, while others show a decided inclination to our modern major and minor scales. Great is the historical importance of Folk-music, because in it we see a dawning recognition of the principles of instrumental form, _i.e._, the need of balanced phrases, caused in the songs by the metrical structure of the words, and in the dances by the symmetrical movements of the body; a recognition above all, of the application of a definite system of tonal-centres, and of repetition after contrast. In fact, as we look back it is evident that the outlines of our most important design, that known as the Sonata Form are--in a rudimentary state--found in folk-music. Folk-melodies and rhythms play a large part in the music of Haydn, Schubert, Chopin, Liszt, Brahms, Grieg, Tchaikowsky and Dvo[vr]ák. It seems as if modern composers were doing for music what Luther Burbank has done for plant life; for by grafting modern thought and feeling on to the parent stock of popular music, they have secured a vigor attainable in no other way. Thus some of the noblest melodies of Brahms, Grieg, and Tchaikowsky are actual folk-tunes with slight variation or original melodies conceived in a folk-song spirit.[22]  [Footnote 21: For an eloquent presentation of the significance of Folk-music see the article by Henry F. Gilbert in the _Musical Quarterly_ for October, 1917.]  [Footnote 22: For an able account of the important role that folk-melodies are taking in modern music see Chapter V of _La Chanson Populaire en France_ by Julian Tiersot.]  As music, unlike the other arts, lacks any model in the realm of nature, it has had to work out its own laws, and its spontaneity and directness are the result. It has not become imitative, utilitarian or bound by arbitrary conventions. As Berlioz says in the _Grotesques de la Musique_: \"Music exists by itself; it has no need of poetry, and if every human language were to perish, it would be none the less the"]]]
