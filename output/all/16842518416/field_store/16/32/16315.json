It was starched, hung over the back of a chair in the sunshine, and was then laid on the ironing-blanket; then came the warm box-iron. \"Dear lady!\" said the collar. \"Dear widow-lady! I feel quite hot. I am quite changed. I begin to unfold myself. You will burn a hole in me. Oh! I offer you my hand.\"  \"Rag!\" said the box-iron; and went proudly over the collar: for she fancied she was a steam-engine, that would go on the railroad and draw the waggons. \"Rag!\" said the box-iron.  The collar was a little jagged at the edge, and so came the long scissors to cut off the jagged part.  \"Oh!\" said the collar, \"you are certainly the first opera dancer. How well you can stretch your legs out! It is the most graceful performance I have ever seen. No one can imitate you.\"  \"I know it,\" said the scissors.  \"You deserve to be a baroness,\" said the collar. \"All that I have is a fine gentleman, a boot-jack, and a hair-comb. If I only had the barony!\"  \"Do you seek my hand?\" said the scissors; for she was angry; and without more ado, she _cut him_, and then he was condemned.  \"I shall now be obliged to ask the hair-comb. It is surprising how well you preserve your teeth, Miss,\" said the collar. \"Have you never thought of being betrothed?\"  \"Yes, of course! you may be sure of that,\" said the hair comb. \"I _am_ betrothed--to the boot-jack!\"  \"Betrothed!\" exclaimed the collar. Now there was no other to court, and so he despised it.  A long time passed away, then the collar came into the rag chest at the paper mill; there was a large company of rags, the fine by themselves, and the coarse by themselves, just as it should be. They all had much to say, but the collar the most; for he was a real boaster.  \"I have had such an immense number of sweet-hearts!\" said the collar, \"I could not be in peace! It is true, I was always a fine starched-up gentleman! I had both a bootjack and a hair-comb, which I never used! You should have seen me then, you should have seen me when I lay down!--I shall never forget _my first love_--she was a girdle, so fine, so soft, and so charming, she threw herself into a tub of water for my sake! There was also a widow, who became glowing hot, but I left her standing till she got black again; there was also the first opera dancer, she gave me that cut which I now go with, she was so ferocious! my own hair-comb was in love with me, she lost all her teeth from the heart-ache; yes, I have lived to see much of that sort of thing; but I am extremely sorry for the garter--I mean the girdle--that went into the water-tub. I have much on my conscience, I want to become white paper!\"  And it became so, all the rags were turned into white paper; but the collar came to be just this very piece of white paper we here see, and on which the story is printed; and that was because it boasted so terribly afterwards of what had never happened to it. It would be well for us to beware, that we may not act in a similar manner, for we can never know if we may not, in the course of time, also come into the rag chest, and be made into white paper, and then have our whole life's history printed on it, even the most secret, and be obliged to run about and tell it ourselves, just like this collar.   ------------    THE SHADOW.  It is in the hot lands that the sun burns, sure enough!--there the people become quite a mahogany brown, ay, and in the _hottest_ lands they are burnt to negroes. But now it was only to the _hot_ lands that a learned man had come from the cold; there he thought that he could run about just as when at home, but he soon found out his mistake.  He, and all sensible folks, were obliged to stay within doors,--the window-shutters and doors were closed the whole day; it looked as if the whole house slept, or there was no one at home.  The narrow street with the high houses, was built so that the sunshine must fall there from morning till evening--it was really not to be borne.  The learned man from the cold lands--he was a young man, and seemed to be a clever man--sat in a glowing oven; it took effect on him, he became quite meagre--even his shadow shrunk in, for the sun had also an effect on it. It was first towards evening when the sun was down, that they began to freshen up again.  In the warm lands every window has a balcony, and the people came out on all the balconies in the street--for one must have air, even if one be accustomed to be mahogany!* It was lively both up and down the street. Tailors, and shoemakers, and all the folks, moved out into the street--chairs and tables were brought forth--and candles burnt--yes, above a thousand lights were burning--and the one talked and the other sung; and people walked and church-bells rang, and asses went along with a dingle-dingle-dong! for they too had bells on. The street boys were screaming and hooting, and shouting and shooting, with devils and detonating balls:--and there came corpse bearers and hood wearers,--for there were funerals with psalm and hymn,--and then the din of carriages driving and company arriving:--yes, it was, in truth, lively enough down in the street. Only in that single house, which stood opposite that in which the learned foreigner lived, it was quite still; and yet some one lived there, for there stood flowers in the balcony--they grew so well in the sun's heat--and that they could not do unless they were watered--and some one must water them--there must be somebody there. The door opposite was also opened late in the evening, but it was dark within, at least in the front room; further in there was heard the sound of music. The learned foreigner thought it quite marvellous, but now--it might be that he only imagined it--for he found everything marvellous out there, in the warm lands, if there had only been no sun. The stranger's landlord said that he didn't know who had taken the house opposite, one saw no person about, and as to the music, it appeared to him to be extremely tiresome. \"It is as if some one sat there, and practised a piece that he could not master--always the same piece. 'I shall master it!' says he; but yet he cannot master it, however long he plays.\"  ------  * The word _mahogany_ can be understood, in Danish, as having two meanings. In general, it means the reddish-brown wood itself; but in jest, it signifies \"excessively fine,\" which arose from an anecdote of Nyboder, in Copenhagen, (the seamen's quarter.) A sailor's wife, who was always proud and fine, in her way, came to her neighbor, and complained that she had got a splinter in her finger. \"What of?\" asked the neighbor's wife. \"It is a mahogany splinter;\" said the other. \"Mahogany! it cannot be less with you!\" exclaimed the woman;--and thence the proverb, \"It is so mahogany!\"--(that is, so excessively fine)--is derived.  ------  One night the stranger awoke--he slept with the doors of the balcony open--the curtain before it was raised by the wind, and he thought that a strange lustre came from the opposite neighbor's house; all the flowers shone like flames, in the most beautiful colors, and in the midst of the flowers stood a slender, graceful maiden,--it was as if she also shone; the light really hurt his eyes. He now opened them quite wide--yes, he was quite awake; with one spring he was on the floor; he crept gently behind the curtain but the maiden was gone; the flowers shone no longer, but there they stood, fresh and blooming as ever; the door was ajar, and, far within, the music sounded so soft and delightful, one could really melt away in sweet thoughts from it. Yet it was like a piece of enchantment. And who lived there? Where was the actual entrance? The whole of the ground-floor was a row of shops, and there people could not always be running through.  One evening the stranger sat out on the balcony. The light burnt in the room behind him; and thus it was quite natural that his shadow should fall on his opposite neighbor's wall. Yes! there it sat, directly opposite, between the flowers on the balcony; and when the stranger moved, the shadow also moved: for that it always does.  \"I think my shadow is the only living thing one sees over there,\" said the learned man. \"See! how nicely it sits between the flowers. The door stands half-open: now the shadow should be cunning, and go into the room, look about, and then come and tell me what it had seen. Come, now! be useful, and do me a service,\" said he, in jest. \"Have the kindness to step in. Now! art thou going?\" and then he nodded to the shadow, and the shadow nodded again. \"Well then, go! but don't stay away.\"  The stranger rose, and his shadow on the opposite neighbor's balcony rose also; the stranger turned round and the shadow also turned round. Yes! if any one had paid particular attention to it, they would have seen, quite distinctly, that the shadow went in through the half-open balcony-door of their opposite neighbor, just as the stranger went into his own room, and let the long curtain fall down after him.  Next morning, the learned man went out to drink coffee and read the newspapers.  \"What is that?\" said he, as he came out into the sunshine. \"I have no shadow! So then, it has actually gone last night, and not come again. It is really tiresome!\"  This annoyed him: not so much because the shadow was gone, but because he knew there was a story about a man without a shadow.* It was known to everybody at home, in the cold lands; and if the learned man now came there and told his story, they would say that he was imitating it, and that he had no need to do. He would, therefore, not talk"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31103"],["title","A Christmas Greeting: A Series of Stories (#5)"],["body","it at all; and that was wisely thought.  ------  * Peter Schlemihl, the shadowless man.  ------  In the evening he went out again on the balcony. He had placed the light directly behind him, for he knew that the shadow would always have its master for a screen, but he could not entice it. He made himself little; he made himself great: but no shadow came again. He said, \"Hem! hem!\" but it was of no use.  It was vexatious; but in the warm lands every thing grows so quickly; and after the lapse of eight days he observed, to his great joy, that a new shadow came in the sunshine. In the course of three weeks he had a very fair shadow, which, when he set out for his home in the northern lands, grew more and more in the journey, so that at last it was so long and so large, that it was more than sufficient.  The learned man then came home, and he wrote books about what was true in the world, and about what was good and what was beautiful; and there passed days and years,--yes! many years passed away.  One evening, as he was sitting in his room, there was a gentle knocking at the door.  \"Come in!\" said he; but no one came in; so he opened the door, and there stood before him such an extremely lean man, that he felt quite strange. As to the rest, the man was very finely dressed,--he must be a gentleman.  \"Whom have I the honor of speaking to?\" asked the learned man.  \"Yes! I thought as much,\" said the fine man. \"I thought you would not know me. I have got so much body. I have even got flesh and clothes. You certainly never thought of seeing me so well off. Do you not know your old shadow? You certainly thought I should never more return. Things have gone on well with me since I was last with you. I have, in all respects, become very well off. Shall I purchase my freedom from service? If so, I can do it;\" and then he rattled a whole bunch of valuable seals that hung to his watch, and he stuck his hand in the thick gold chain he wore around his neck;--nay! how all his fingers glittered with diamond rings; and then all were pure gems.  \"Nay; I cannot recover from my surprise!\" said the learned man: \"what is the meaning of all this?\"  \"Something common, is it not,\" said the shadow: \"but you yourself do not belong to the common order; and I, as you know well, have from a child followed in your footsteps, As soon as you found I was capable to go out alone in the world, I went my own way. I am in the most brilliant circumstances, but there came a sort of desire over me to see you once more before you die; you will die, I suppose? I also wished to see this land again,--for you know we always love our native land. I know you have got another shadow again; have I anything to pay to it or you? If so, you will oblige me by saying what it is.\"  \"Nay, is it really thou?\" said the learned man: \"it is most remarkable: I never imagined that one's old shadow could come again as a man.\"  \"Tell me what I have to pay,\" said the shadow; \"for I don't like to be in any sort of debt.\"  \"How canst thou talk so?\" said the learned man; \"what debt is there to talk about? Make thyself as free as any one else. I am extremely glad to hear of thy good fortune: sit down, old friend, and tell me a little how it has gone with thee, and what thou hast seen at our opposite neighbor's there--in the warm lands.\"  \"Yes, I will tell you all about it,\" said the shadow, and sat down: \"but then you must also promise me, that, wherever you may meet me, you will never say to any one here in the town that I have been your shadow. I intend to get betrothed, for I can provide for more than one family.\"  \"Be quite at thy ease about that,\" said the learned man; \"I shall not say to any one who thou actually art: here is my hand--I promise it, and a man's bond is his word.\"  \"A word is a shadow,\" said the shadow, \"and as such it must speak.\"  It was really quite astonishing how much of a man it was. It was dressed entirely in black, and of the very finest cloth; it had patent leather boots, and a hat that could be folded together, so that it was bare crown and brim; not to speak of what we already know it had--seals, gold neck-chain, and diamond rings; yes, the shadow was well-dressed, and it was just that which made it quite a man.  \"Now I shall tell you my adventures,\" said the shadow; and then he sat, with the polished boots, as heavily as he could, on the arm of the learned man's new shadow, which lay like a poodle-dog at his feet. Now this was perhaps from arrogance; and the shadow on the ground kept itself so still and quiet, that it might hear all that passed: it wished to know how it could get free, and work its way up, so as to become its own master.  \"Do you know who lived in our opposite neighbor's house?\" said the shadow; \"it was the most charming of all beings, it was Poesy! I was there for three weeks, and that has as much effect as if one had lived three thousand years, and read all that was composed and written; that is what I say, and it is right. I have seen everything and I know everything!\"  \"Poesy!\" cried the learned man; \"yes, yes, she often dwells a recluse in large cities! Poesy! yes, I have seen her,--a single short moment, but sleep came into my eyes! She stood on the balcony and shone as the aurora borealis shines. Go on, go on!--thou wert on the balcony, and went through the doorway, and then------\"  \"Then I was in the antechamber,\" said the shadow. \"You always sat and looked over to the antechamber. There was no light; there was a sort of twilight, but the one door stood open directly opposite the other through a long row of rooms and saloons, and there it was lighted up. I should have been completely killed if I had gone over to the maiden; but I was circumspect, I took time to think, and that one must always do.\"  \"And what didst thou then see?\" asked the learned man.  \"I saw everything, and I shall tell all to you: but,--it is no pride on my part,--as a free man, and with the knowledge I have, not to speak of my position in life, my excellent circumstances,--I certainly wish that you would say _you_* to me!\"  ------  * It is the custom in Denmark for intimate acquaintances to use the second person singular, \"Du,\" (thou) when speaking to each other. When a friendship is formed between men, they generally affirm it, when occasion offers, either in public or private, by drinking to each other and exclaiming, \"_thy health_,\" at the same time striking their glasses together.--This is called drinking \"_Duus_:\"--they are then, \"_Duus Brodre_,\" (thou brothers,) and ever afterwards use the pronoun \"_thou_,\" to each other, it being regarded as more familiar than \"De,\" (you). Father and mother, sister and brother, say _thou_ to one another--without regard to age or rank. Master and mistress say _thou_ to their servants--the superior to the inferior. But servants and inferiors do not use the same term to their masters, or superiors--nor is it ever used when speaking to a stranger, or any one with whom they are but slightly acquainted--they then say as in English--_you._  ------  \"I beg your pardon,\" said the learned man; \"it is an old habit with me. _You_ are perfectly right, and I shall remember it; but now _you_ must tell me all _you_ saw!\"  \"Everything!\" said the shadow, \"for I saw everything, and I know everything!\"  \"How did it look in the furthest saloon?\" asked the learned man. \"Was it there as in the fresh woods? Was it there as in a holy church? Were the saloons like the starlit firmament when we stand on the high mountains?\"  \"Everything was there!\" said the shadow. \"I did not go quite in, I remained in the foremost room, in the twilight, but I stood there quite well; I saw everything, and I know everything! I have been in the antechamber at the court of Poesy.\"  \"But _what did_ you see? Did all the gods of the olden times pass through the large saloons? Did the old heroes combat there? Did sweet children play there, and relate their dreams?\"  \"I tell you I was there, and you can conceive that I saw everything there was to be seen. Had you come over there, you would not have been a man; but I became so! And besides, I learned to know my inward nature, my innate qualities, the relationship I had with Poesy. At the time I was with you, I thought not of that, but always--you know it well--when the sun rose, and when the sun went down, I became so strangely great; in the moonlight I was very near being more distinct than yourself; at that time I did not understand my nature; it was revealed to me in the antechamber! I became a man!--I came out matured; but you were no longer in the warm lands;--as a man I was ashamed to go as I did. I was in want of boots, of clothes, of the whole human varnish that makes a man perceptible. I took my way--I tell it to you, but you will not put it in any book--I took my way to the cake woman--I hid myself behind her; the woman didn't think how much she concealed. I went out first in the evening; I ran about the streets in the moonlight; I made myself long up the walls--it tickles the back so delightfully! I ran up, and ran down, peeped into the highest windows, into the saloons, and on the roofs, I peeped in where no one could peep, and I saw what no one else saw, what no one else should see! This is, in fact, a base world! I would not be a man if it were not now once accepted and regarded as something to be so! I saw the most unimaginable things with the women, with the men, with parents, and with the sweet, matchless children; I saw,\" said the shadow \"what no human being must know, but what they would all so willingly know--what is bad in their neighbor. Had I written a newspaper, it would have been read! but I wrote direct to the persons themselves, and there was consternation in all the towns where I came. They were so afraid of me, and yet they were so excessively fond of me. The professors made a professor of me; the tailors gave me new clothes--I am well furnished; the master of the mint struck new"]]]
