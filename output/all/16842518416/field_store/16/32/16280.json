In Morfield Canyon the colony had decreased. Occupied burrows were found on the west side of the canyon near the fence and above the well (17 burrows), and below the well on the west side (estimated 30 burrows). The total population in both canyons was estimated to be 100, compared with 800 in the preceding year. The ground-water table was thought to be rising, and vegetation was increasing.  On August 12, 1946, two prairie dogs were observed in Prater Canyon, one near the Maintenance Camp, and the other a mile to the south. In Morfield Canyon 18 occupied burrows were found north of the fence and 36 below the well, in the same two areas occupied in 1945.  On August 12, 1947, two animals were seen at one of the localities occupied a year earlier in Prater Canyon, and three burrows were occupied. In Morfield Canyon 119 occupied burrows were counted. At least 12 dens occupied by badgers were present in 1946, and four in 1947.  On August 9, 1948, no evidence of living prairie dogs was found in Prater Canyon. In Morfield Canyon 45 burrows were counted north of the fence. The grass had been increasing in abundance for several years.  On August 18, 1949, no evidence of living prairie dogs was found in either canyon. In 1951 five prairie dogs were said to have been seen in Prater Canyon in June and July. No other observations have been recorded.  On June 22, 1956, 13 pups and 7 adult prairie dogs were released in an enclosure in Morfield Canyon. Periodic inspections in the summer revealed that the colony was surviving and healthy. By the following spring no prairie dogs remained. Another reintroduction is planned this year (1960).  Both the history of the prairie dogs and the history of the viewpoint of people toward them are interesting. Individual views have ranged from a desire to exterminate all the prairie dogs to a desire to leave them undisturbed by man.  In review: The early history of prairie dogs on the Mesa Verde is not well documented but reports are available of the absence of prairie dogs before settlement by white men, and of introductions of prairie dogs. Other reports indicate that prairie dogs have been observed far from established colonies; therefore natural invasion may account for the establishment of prairie dogs on the Mesa. Grazing of moderate to heavy intensity by livestock continued in Morfield Canyon until 1941. Cessation of grazing and above average precipitation were accompanied by increased growth of vegetation in the colonies of prairie dogs. Mr. Wade has suggested that flooding of burrows by ground water drove prairie dogs from some lower parts of the floors of the canyons, and that increased vegetation favored predators, primarily badgers and coyotes, which further reduced the population. The abruptness of the decline, especially in Prater Canyon, is consistent with the theory that some epidemic disease occurred. This possibility was considered at the time of the decline, and a Mobile Laboratory of the United States Public Health Service spent from June 5 to June 25, 1947, in the Park collecting rodents and their fleas for study. The primary concern was plague, which had been detected in neighboring states. No evidence of plague or of tularemia was reported after study of 494 small rodents obtained from 13 localities in the Park. Only six prairie dogs (all from Morfield Canyon) were studied. The negative report does not prove that tularemia or some other disease was not a factor in the decimation of the colony in Prater Canyon the year before.  If prairie dogs were able to survive primarily because of over-grazing by domestic animals, future introductions may fail. If disease was the major factor in their disappearance, reintroductions may succeed.   Spermophilus lateralis lateralis (Say) Golden-mantled Ground Squirrel       _Specimens examined._--Total, 10: highway at School Section Canyon,      MV 7894/507; Sect. 27, head of east fork of Navajo Canyon, 7900      ft., 69265; and Prater Canyon, 7600 to 7800 ft., MV 7835/507,      7837/507, 7846/507, 7874/507, 7875/507, MVZ 74411-74413.  In 1956, I observed _S. lateralis_ 1/2 mi. W of Park Point, 3/4 mi. WSW Park Point, in the public campground at Park Headquarters, at the lower well in Prater Canyon, and at two other places on the North Rim. Other observations on file were made at Prater Grade, Park Point, \"D\" cut (on North Rim 1 mi. WSW Park Point), and Morfield Canyon. A juvenile was noted at Park Point on June 28, 1952, by Jean Pinkley, and five young were seen together at \"D\" cut on July 3, 1935. The earliest observation, also recorded by Jean Pinkley, was on February 1, 1947. All of the localities with the exception of Park Headquarters are above 7500 feet, and most of the localities are in vegetation that is predominantly oak-brush.   Spermophilus variegatus grammurus (Say) Rock Squirrel       _Specimens examined._--Total, 6: Head of Prater Canyon, MV      7876/507; Chickaree Draw, Prater Canyon, MV 7843/507, 7844/507;      Headquarters Area, MV 7888/507; Ruins Road 1/2 mi. NE of Cliff      Palace, MV 7893/507; and Spruce Tree House, 4334 in Denver Museum.  Specimen number 7893/507 had 360 Purshia seeds in its cheek-pouches according to a note on the label. On July 18, 1960, I found a young male rock squirrel dead on the road a mile north of headquarters that had 234 pinyon seeds in its cheek-pouches. Young, recorded as \"half-grown,\" have been observed in May and July. The first appearance may be as early as January. In 1950, D. Watson thought that they did not hibernate, except for a few days when the weather was stormy. I observed a rock squirrel in August in the public campground at Park Headquarters sitting on its haunches on a branch of a juniper some twelve feet from the ground and eating an object held in its forefeet. The rock squirrel ranges throughout the Park in all habitats.   Eutamias minimus operarius Merriam Least Chipmunk       _Specimens examined._--Total, 17: North Rim above Morfield Canyon,      MV 7856/507; Morfield Canyon, 7600 ft. (obtained on Nov. 4, 1957),      75976; Middle Well in Prater Canyon, 7500 ft, MV 7855/507; Prater      Canyon, 7600 ft., MVZ 74414; Park Point, 8525 ft., 69267-69270; 1/4      mi. S, 3/4 mi.

N Rock Springs, 8200 ft., 69276-69277.  Five of the fourteen specimens of known sex are females, all of which were taken in August and September, and none of which is recorded as having contained embryos. The skulls of the eight August-taken specimens also suggest that young are born in late spring or early summer: the largest skull had well-worn teeth that might indicate an age of more than one year; four others had complete adult dentitions that were barely worn; and three had not yet acquired complete adult dentitions.  The records of _E. minimus_, like those of _Spermophilus lateralis_, indicate greatest abundance in the higher parts of the Mesa Verde and in areas of predominantly brushy vegetation.   Eutamias quadrivittatus hopiensis Merriam Colorado Chipmunk       _Specimens examined._--Total, 13: Prater Canyon, 7600 ft., MV      7838/507; Lower Well, Prater Canyon, 69278; Park Headquarters, MV      7889/507; near the old Park Well, 7300 ft., 5468 in Univ. of      Colorado collection; Utility Area, 5469 and 5470 in Univ. of      Colorado collection; Spruce Tree House, 4352-4355 in Denver Museum;      Mesa Verde, 25 mi. [by road] SW Mancos, 149080-149081 USNM; Square      Tower House, 7000 ft., 5467 in Univ. of Colorado collection.  Although both species occur in some of the same areas, _E. q. hopiensis_ is more abundant than is _E. minimus_ in stands of pinyon and juniper, along cliffs, and at low elevations. (A specimen of _hopiensis_, MV 7849/507, from 3 mi. S of the Park boundary where the 6000 foot contour line cross the Mancos River is indicative of the occurrence at low elevations.)   Thomomys bottae aureus J.A. Allen Botta's Pocket Gopher       _Specimens examined._--Total, 35: Prater Canyon, 7600 ft.,      74408-74410 MVZ; Upper Well, Prater Canyon, 7575 ft., 69279; 1/4      mi.

NNW Rock Springs, 69305; Mesa Verde, northern end,      8100 ft., 149087 USNM.  The pocket gophers of the Mesa Verde and vicinity are of one species, _Thomomys bottae_. The distribution and variation of this species in Colorado have been studied recently by Youngman (1958) who referred all specimens from the Mesa Verde to _T. b. aureus_. He noted that some specimens have dark diffuse dorsal stripes that are wide in specimens from the Mancos River Valley. The generally darker color of the specimens from the Mancos Valley as compared with that of specimens from on the Mesa was noticed in the field, and is another example of the local variability of pocket gophers. The nine specimens listed by Youngman (1958:372) as from \"Mesa Verde National Park,\" Mancos River, 6200 ft., are not here listed among \"specimens examined\" because possibly some, or"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31035"],["title","Mammals of Mesa Verde National Park, Colorado (#4)"],["body",", of the nine were trapped on the east side of the River and therefore outside the Park. None was, however, farther than 30 yards east of the Park.  In the Park, pocket gophers occur both on mesa tops and in canyons. Most of the localities listed above and others at which mounds were seen are areas of disturbance such as the old burn on Wetherill Mesa, the rights of way for roads, the river valley, and the grazed floor of Prater Canyon. Little evidence of pocket gophers was found on unusually rocky slopes, steep slopes, or in stands of pinyon and juniper or in relatively pure stands of oak-brush. In addition to workability of the soil, the presence of herbaceous plants, many of them weedy annuals, is probably the most important factor governing the success of pocket gophers in a local area. No female was recorded to have contained embryos, but two had enlarged uteri or placental scars. This fact and the capture of nine half-grown individuals indicate breeding prior to late August when most specimens were trapped.   Dipodomys ordii longipes (Merriam) Ord's Kangaroo Rat  Kangaroo rats have been seen crossing the highway in the Park less than one mile from the Park entrance by Jean Pinkley.   Castor canadensis concisor Warren and Hall Beaver  In 1935 Quaintance and White spent June 16 to June 20 in the Mancos River Bottoms at the mouth of Weber Canyon, looking for sign of fresh beaver work. They found none. Annual Animal Census Reports include the following information based on patrols along the Mancos River at the east boundary of the Park: 1937--estimate 4 beaver present, 1938--8, 1941--numerous bank burrows, 1942--uncommon, 1944--uncommon, 1945--most concentrated at southeast corner, 1946--runs and two small dams seen (flood had washed out larger dams), 1947--only in 1-1/2 miles north of boundary with Ute Reservation, 1949--two separate colonies (each with dams and one with a large house), 1950--none, owing to drouth and diversion of water upstream completely drying the river at times, 1951--none, 1953--present, 1955--present. On the Mancos River, 6200 ft., in late August, 1956, sign of beaver was abundant, numerous trees had been cut but none within a week, and a bank den was found on the west side of the river extending back 50 feet from the stream and caved in at three places. In 1959 dens were still present.   Reithrodontomys megalotis aztecus J.A. Allen Western Harvest Mouse       _Specimens examined._--Total, 38: North end Mesa Verde National      Park, 7000 ft, 75984-75986; Park Point, 8525 ft., 69316-69317; Far      View Ruins, 7700 ft, 69318-69319, 79220, MV 7897/507, and 23      uncatalogued specimens in preservative; 3 mi. N Rock Springs, 8200      ft., 69320-69321; 2 mi. NNW Rock Springs, 7900 ft., 69322-69323; 1      mi. NNW Rock Springs, 7600 ft., 69324; 1/2 mi. NNW Rock Springs,      7500 ft., 69325.  The specimen listed last (69325) was an adult male recovered from the stomach of a small (snout-vent length 334 mm., wt. 26.0 gms.) _Crotalus viridus_ that was trapped in a Museum Special mouse-trap on a rocky slope mostly barren of vegetation. The availability of samples taken in August (by Anderson in 1956), in September (by Shepherd in 1958), and in November (by Alcorn in 1957) makes the following comparison of age and reproductive condition possible. The sample from November includes some specimens from outside the Park as follows: 1 mi. W Mancos, Colorado, 75979-75983, and 2 mi. N La Plata [not shown on Fig. 2], San Juan County, New Mexico, some 18 miles southeast of the Park, 75987-76000. The data shown in Figure 3 indicate that females are pregnant at least from in August into November. A smaller percentage of females was pregnant in November than in August or September. The fact that all females more than 130 mm. long were pregnant in September suggests an autumnal peak in breeding activity. A change in the ratio of small individuals (less than 130 mm. in length) to large individuals (130 mm. or more in length) is indicative of a sustained breeding period throughout the time shown. In August the ratio was 1 to 2.3, in September the ratio was 1 to 1.2, and the ratio was 1 to 0.7 in November. The western harvest mouse is found usually in grassy areas.

[by road] SW      Mancos, 149093 USNM; Cornfield, MV 7878/507.  The most abundant mammal is the ubiquitous deer mouse. Series of specimens taken in August (by Anderson in 1956), in September (by Shepherd in 1958 and 1959), and in November (by Alcorn in 1957) make possible the following comparisons of age, reproductive conditions, and molts.  The specimens obtained in August and November were placed in five categories according to age (as judged by wear on the teeth). These categories correspond in general to those used by Hoffmeister (1951:1) in studies of _Peromyscus truei_. From his descriptions I judge that wear in _Peromyscus maniculatus_ differs from wear in _Peromyscus truei_ in that the last upper molar is not worn smooth before appreciable wear appears on the first two molars, and the lingual and labial cusps wear more nearly concurrently. The five categories differ as follows: category 1, last upper molar in process of erupting, showing no wear; category 2, some wear apparent on all teeth, but most cusps little worn; category 3, greater wear on all teeth, lingual cusps becoming rounded or flattened; category 4, lingual cusps worn smooth, labial cusps show considerable wear; category 5, all cusps worn smooth. The condition of the pelage was noted for each prepared skin. Hoffmeister (_op. cit._: 4) summarized changes in pelage that he observed in _Peromyscus truei_, and he summarized earlier work by Collins with _Peromyscus maniculatus_. In _P. maniculatus_ a grayish juvenal pelage is replaced by a postjuvenal pelage in which the hairs are longer and have longer, pale, terminal or subterminal bands giving a paler and more buffy or ochraceous hue to the dorsal pelage. The postjuvenal pelage is replaced by an adult pelage that is either brighter or, in some cases, is not distinguishable with certainty from the postjuvenal pelage. Not only is the juvenal pelage distinguishable from the postjuvenal pelage, but the sequence of ingrowth of postjuvenal pelage follows a regular pattern that is usually different from that of subsequent molts. The loss of juvenal hair is less readily observed than the ingrowth of new postjuvenal hair on account of the greater time required for the growth of any individual hair than for the sudden loss of a hair.  Molt was observed in some individuals no longer having juvenal pelage; some new pelage was observed on the skins of seven mice collected in August. Each of these was in category 4 or 5 and probably had been born in the previous calendar year. These seven molting individuals make up nearly 17 per cent of 42 individuals that had completed the juvenal to postjuvenal molt. In November, 80 per cent of individuals (92 of 115) that had previously obtained their postjuvenal or adult pelage were molting. These mice were in age-categories 3, 4, and 5. Some of the individuals in category 3 were developing new hair beneath a relatively unworn bright pelage that I judge to be an adult pelage rather than a postjuvenal pelage. If this judgment be correct and if the relatively unworn dentition (category 3) means that these animals are young of the year, we must conclude that individuals born in early summer may molt from juvenal to postjuvenal, then to adult pelage, and finally in the autumn into another adult pelage. Other individuals, six in number and of categories 2 and 3, are simultaneously completing the juvenal to postjuvenal molt and beginning the postjuvenal to adult molt. The juvenal to postjuvenal molt begins, as has been described by various authors, along the lateral line and proceeds dorsally and ventrally and anteriorly and posteriorly, and the last patch to lose the gray juvenal color is the top of head and nape, or less frequently the rump. In some individuals a gray patch on the nape remained but emerging hair was not apparent; perhaps the molt had been halted just prior to completion. The"]]]
