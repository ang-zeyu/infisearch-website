I have not seen the specimen from 9 mi. NW of Lincoln; however, another specimen from there, two others from Lancaster County, and one from Seward County (see above), are here referred to _P. h. spilotus_, rather than _P. h. paradoxus_, on the basis of notably darker dorsal coloration and smaller external and cranial measurements. The range of _P. h. spilotus_ in Nebraska, as presently known, therefore, is limited to the eastern, more humid part of the State, south of the Platte River.  =Peromyscus maniculatus osgoodi= Mearns. DEER MOUSE.--Swenk (1908:95) reported this subspecies, under the name _Peromyscus nebrascensis_, from Glen, and Dice (1941:17) reported the subspecies from Agate, both localities being in Sioux County in the northwestern part of the State. Osgood (1909), however, did not mention Nebraskan specimens of this subspecies and excluded it from the State on his (_op. cit._) distribution map of the subspecies of _P. maniculatus_. In addition, Quay (1948:181) reports, as _P. m. nebrascensis_, deer mice obtained by him in the badlands of northern Sioux County and adjacent Niobrara County, Wyoming. Four deer mice referable to _P. m. osgoodi_ have been obtained from several localities on the Pine Ridge in Dawes County as follows: 3 mi. E of Chadron, 2; Chadron State Park, 1; 3 mi. SW of Crawford, 1. When compared with specimens of _P. m. nebrascensis_, geographically adjacent to the east, these mice are seen to be notably darker and less buffy than _nebrascensis_ and to average significantly larger in both external and cranial measurements. All deer mice from the Pine Ridge and adjacent badlands of extreme northwestern Nebraska probably are best referred to _P. m. osgoodi_. External measurements of two adult females are respectively: Total length, 180, 175; length of tail-vertebrae, 78, 74; length of hind foot, 19, 20; length of ear, 17, 16.  =Neotoma floridana campestris= J. A. Allen. FLORIDA WOOD RAT.--Five wood rats from 5 mi. N, 2 mi. W of Parks, Dundy County, in extreme southwestern Nebraska, provide the first record of occurrence of this subspecies in Nebraska. These animals were trapped in outlying sheds at the Rock Creek State Fish Hatchery. Two large wood-rat houses were in a dense thicket of brush and young trees in a small draw on the west side of the most westwardly hatchery lake. Brown rats (_Rattus norvegicus_) inhabited a combination garage-storage barn at the hatchery and no wood rats were taken there.  =Microtus pennsylvanicus pennsylvanicus= (Ord). PENNSYLVANIA MEADOW MOUSE.--This subspecies occurs in eastern and central Nebraska (see Bailey, 1900:18 and Swenk, 1908:104). Additional records of occurrence are as follows: 5 mi. E of Rising City, Butler County, 5; 4 mi. SE of Laurel, Cedar County, 1; Wayne, 2, and 2-1/2 mi. E of Wayne, 1, Wayne County; 2-1/2 mi. N of Ord, Valley County, 4.  =Synaptomys cooperi gossii= (Coues). COOPER LEMMING MOUSE.--Fichter and Hanson (1947:1-8) reported the first known occurrence of this microtine in Nebraska, recording specimens from several localities in Lancaster County and one from near Valentine, Cherry County. Recent records of this mouse which help to clarify its distribution in Nebraska are as follows: 4 mi. N, 1/2 mi. E of Octavia, Butler County, 1; 5 mi. N, 2 mi. W of Parks, Dundy County, 1; 1 mi. N of Pleasant Dale, Seward County, 1.  An adult female from Dundy County provides the westernmost record of distribution of the species in North America. The animal was trapped on November 1, 1952, in association with _Microtus pennsylvanicus modestus_ in a marshy area at the Rock Creek State Fish Hatchery on spring-fed Rock Creek. The pelage on the back is notably darker than in _S. c. gossii_, and resembles _S. c. paludis_ from the Cimarron River drainage in Meade County, Kansas, but in the sum total of its characters it most closely resembles _S. c. gossii_ among named subspecies.  =Mustela rixosa campestris= Jackson. LEAST WEASEL.--The least weasel occurs in eastern and central Nebraska (see Swenk, 1926:313-330 and Hall, 1951:192) but is known by only a single specimen from each locality of record save for the area around Inland, Clay County (Swenk, _op. cit._). Additional records of the distribution of this mustelid in Nebraska are: Hastings, Adams County, 1 (HM); Schuyler, Colfax County, 1 (NGFPC); Goehner, Seward County, 1 (NSM); 10 mi. S of Ord, Valley County, 1 (NGFPC). The last mentioned specimen, a skull only, was obtained from a pellet of an unidentified raptorial bird.   LITERATURE CITED  BAILEY, V.     1900.

RAYMOND HALL   A single specimen of little brown bat from the northern part of the state of Veracruz seems to be of an heretofore unrecognized species. It is named and described below.       =_Myotis elegans_= new species       _Holotype._--Female, adult, skin and skull, No. 88398 Museum of      Natural History, The University of Kansas; 12-1/2 mi. N. Tihuatlán,      300 ft. elevation, Veracruz, Mexico; obtained on September 24,      1961, by Percy L. Clifton, original No. 985.       _Geographic distribution._--Known only from the type locality.       _Diagnosis._--A small-footed species having a short tail and small      skull. Pelage on upper parts near (16' _l_) Prout's Brown      (capitalized color terms after Ridgway, Color Standards and Color      Nomenclature, Washington, D. C., 1912), and more golden on      underparts; ears pale brownish and flight-membranes only slightly      darker; thumb small (7.5 mm. including wrist); tragus slender but      deeply notched. Longitudinal, dorsal profile of skull relatively      straight but frontal region elevated from rostrum and lambdoidal      region elevated from posterior part of parietal region; posterior      margin of P4 (in occlusal view) notched.       _Comparisons._--Among named kinds of _Myotis_, _M. elegans_ shows      most resemblance to the species _M. californicus_ and _M.      subulatus_. Differences from the latter include shorter tail and      ear, more golden color on underparts, pale (not blackish) lips,      ears and flight membranes, more slender tragus, shorter skull,      posterior border of P4 (in occlusal view) more deeply notched, and      longitudinal dorsal profile of skull higher in frontal and      lambdoidal regions.       Differences from _M. californicus_ include shorter tail, more      golden color on underparts, deeper notch in tragus, shorter skull,      notched instead of smooth posterior border of P4 (in occlusal      view), longitudinal, dorsal profile of skull less abruptly elevated      in frontal region and with (instead of without) prelambdoidal      depression. From _M. c. mexicanus_ that occurs to the north, west,      and south of the type locality of _M. elegans_ the latter further      differs in darker color, paler ears, paler flight membranes, and      lesser size, including skull.       Differences from _M. nigricans_ of the same region include reddish      instead of black pelage, smaller hind foot, smaller skull, rostrum      smaller in relation to remainder of skull, narrower interorbital      region, and absence of a sagittal crest.       _Measurements._--Total length, 79; length of tail, 34; length of      hind foot, 7.5; length of ear from notch, 12; length of tragus,      6.5; weight, 4 grams; length of forearm, 33.0; greatest length of      skull, 12.4; condylobasal length, 11.9; interorbital constriction,      3.2; breadth of braincase, 6.1; occipital depth, 4.5; length of      mandible, 8.9; length of maxillary tooth-row, 4.6; maxillary      breadth at M3, 4.9; length of mandibular tooth-row, 5.0. Degree of      wear on teeth, stage 2 (in terminology of Miller and Allen, Bull.      U. S. Nat. Mus., 144, May 25, 1928).  _Remarks._--The longitudinal dorsal profile of the skull and the deeply notched posterior border of P4 seem to be distinctive of _elegans_. When the characters of _elegans_ first were tabulated it was felt that it probably was only subspecifically different from some previously named species. But further study of the distinctive characters indicates that they are outside the range of variation of any near relative of _elegans_ and it, therefore, is here accorded specific rank.
