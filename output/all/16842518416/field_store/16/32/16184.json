He insists on talking to you.\"  \"Bring him in,\" I said. \"I'll talk to him. And get hold of Dr. Brownlee.\"  \"Excuse me,\" I said to the Duke. \"Business.\" He started to get up, but I said, \"That's all right, Your Grace; you might as well sit in on it.\" He relaxed back into the chair.  Two cops brought in Manewiscz, a short, nervous man with a big nose and frightened brown eyes.  \"What's the trouble, Manny?\" I asked.  \"Nothing, Inspector; I'm telling you, I didn't do nothing. I'm walking along Fifth Avenoo when all of a sudden these cops pull up in a squad-car and some fat jerk in the back seat is hollering that I am the guy he seen get out of a smashup on 99th Street, which is a good three blocks from where I am walking. Besides which, I have not driven a car for over a year now, and I have been in all ways a law-abiding citizen and a credit to the family and the community.\"  \"Do you know the fat guy?\" I asked. \"The guy who fingered you for the boys?\"  \"I never had the pleasure of seeing him before,\" said Manny the Moog, \"but, on the other hand, I do not expect to forget his fat face between now and the next time we meet.\"  At that point, Dr. Brownlee came through the door.  \"Hello, Inspector,\" he said with a quick smile. He saw Manewiscz then, and his eyebrows went up. \"What are you doing here, Manny?\"  \"I am here, Doc, because the two gentlemen in uniform whom you see standing on both sides of me extend a polite invitation to accompany them here, although I am not in the least guilty of the thing they say I do which causes them to issue this invitation.\"  I explained what had happened and Brownlee shook his head slowly without saying anything for a moment. Then he said, \"Come on in my office, Manny; I want to talk to you for a few minutes. O.K., Inspector?\" He glanced at me.  \"Sure.\" I waved him and Manny away. \"You boys stay here,\" I told the patrolmen, \"Manny will be all right.\" As soon as the door closed behind Dr. Brownlee and Manewiscz I said: \"You two brought the witness in, too, didn't you?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said one. The other nodded.  \"You'd better do a little more careful checking on him. He may be simply mistaken, or he may have been the actual driver. See if he's been in any trouble before.\"  \"The sergeant's already doing that, sir,\" said the one who had spoken before. \"Meanwhile, maybe we better go out and have a little talk with the guy.\"  \"Take it easy, he may be a perfectly respectable citizen.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" he said. \"We'll just ask him a few questions.\"  They left, and I noticed that the Duke was looking rather puzzled, but he didn't ask any questions, so I couldn't answer any.  The intercom lit up, and I flipped the switch. \"Yes?\"  \"I just checked up on the witness,\" said the sergeant. \"No record. His identification checks out O.K. Thomas H. Wilson, an executive at the City-Chemical Bank; lives on Central Park West. The lab says that the driver of the car wore gloves.\"  \"Thank Wilson for his information, let him go, and tell him we'll call him if we need him. Lay it on thick about what a good citizen he is. Make him happy.\"  \"Right.\"  I switched off and started to say something to my guest, but the intercom lit up again. \"Yeah?\"  \"Got a call-in from Officer McCaffery, the beat man on Broadway between 108th and 112th. He's got a lead on the guy you're looking for.\"  \"Tell him we'll be right over. Where is he?\"  The sergeant told me, and I cut off.  I took out my gun and spun the cylinder, checking it from force of habit more than anything else, since I always check and clean it once a day, anyhow. I slid it back into its holster and turned to the Duke, who was already on his feet.  \"Did the Commissioner give you a Special Badge?\" I asked him.  \"Yes, he did.\" He pulled it out of his inside pocket and showed it to me.  \"Good. I'll have the sergeant fill out a temporary pistol permit, and--\"  \"I don't have a pistol, Inspector,\" he said. \"I--\"  \"That's all right; we'll issue you one. We can--\"  He shook his head. \"Thanks, I'd rather not. I've never used a pistol except when I've gone out after a criminal who is known to be armed and dangerous. I don't think Lawrence Nestor is very dangerous to adult males, and I doubt that he's armed.\" He hefted the walking stick he'd been carrying. \"This will do nicely, thank you.\"  The way he said it was totally inoffensive, but it made me feel as though I were about to go out rabbit hunting with an elephant gun. \"Force of habit,\" I said. \"In New York, a cop would feel naked without a gun. But I assure you that I have no intention of shooting Mr. Nestor unless he takes a shot at me first.\"  Just as we were leaving, Dr. Brownlee met us in the outer room.  [Illustration] \"All right if I let Manny the Moog go, Roy?\"  [Illustration]  \"Sure, Doc; if you say so.\" I didn't have any time for introductions just then; Chief Inspector the Duke of Acrington and I kept going.         *       *       *       *       *  Eight minutes later, I pulled up to the post where Officer McCaffery was waiting. Since I'd already talked to him over the radio, all he did was stroll off as soon as we pulled up. I didn't want everyone in the neighborhood to know that there was something afoot. His Grace and I climbed out of the car and walked up toward a place called Flanagan's Bar.  It was a small place, the neighborhood type, with an old-fashioned air about it. Two or three of the men looked up as we came in, and then went back to the more important business of drinking. We went back to the far end of the bar, and the bartender came over, a short, heavy man, with the build of a heavyweight boxer and hands half again as big as mine. He had dark hair, a square face, a dimpled chin, and calculating blue eyes.  \"What'll it be?\" he said in a friendly voice.  \"Couple of beers,\" I told him.  I waited until he came back before I identified myself. Officer McCaffery had told me that the bartender was trustworthy, but I wanted to make sure I had the right man.  \"You Lee Darcey?\" I asked when he brought back the beers.  \"That's right.\"  I flashed my badge. \"Is there anywhere we can talk?\"  \"Sure. The back room, right through there.\" He turned to the other bartender. \"Take over for a while, Frankie.\" Then he ducked under the bar and followed the Duke and me into the back room.  We sat down, and I showed him the picture of Lawrence Nestor. \"I understand you've seen this guy.\"  He picked up the picture and cocked an eyebrow at it. \"Well, I wouldn't swear to it in court, Inspector, but it sure looks like the fellow who was in here this afternoon--this evening, rather, from six to about six-thirty. I don't come on duty until six, and he was here when I got here.\"  It was just seven o'clock. If the man was Nestor, we hadn't missed him by more than half an hour.  \"Notice anything about his voice?\"  \"I noticed the lisp, if that's what you mean.\"  \"Did he talk much?\"  Darcey shook his head. \"Not a lot. Just sat there and drank, mostly. Had about three after I came on.\"  \"What was he drinking?\"  \"Whisky. Beer chaser.\" He grinned. \"He tips pretty well.\"  \"Has he ever been in here before?\"  \"Not that I know of. He might've come in in the daytime. You'd have to check with Mickey, the day man.\"  \"Was he drunk?\"  \"Not that I could tell. I wouldn't have served him if he was,\" he said righteously.  I said, \"Darcey, if he comes back in here ... let's see--Can you shut off that big sign out front from behind the bar?\"  \"Sure.\"  \"O.K. If he comes in, shut off the sign. We'll have men here in less than a minute. He isn't dangerous or anything, so just act natural and give him whatever he orders. I don't want him scared off. Understand?\"  \"I got you.\"  His Grace and I went outside, and I used my pocket communicator to instruct a patrol car to cover Flanagan's Bar from across the street, and I called for extra plainclothesmen to cover the area.  \"Now what?\" asked His Grace.  \"Now we go barhopping,\" I said. \"He's probably still drinking, but it isn't likely that he'll find many little girls at this time of night. He's probably got a room nearby.\"  At that point, a blue ElectroFord pulled up in front of us. Stevie stuck his head out and said: \"Your office said you'd be around here somewhere. Remember me, Dad?\"  I covered my eyes with one hand in mock horror. \"My God, the fifty!\" Then I dropped the hand toward my billfold. \"I'm sorry, son; I got wrapped up in this thing and completely forgot.\" That made two apologies in two minutes, and I began to have the uneasy feeling that I had suddenly become a vaguely repellant mass of thumbs and left feet.  I handed him the fifty, and, at the same time, said: \"Son, I want you to meet His Grace, Chief Inspector the Duke of Acrington. Your Grace, this is my son, Steven Royall.\"  As they shook hands, Steve said: \"It's a pleasure to meet Your Grace. I read about the job you did in the Camberwell poisoning case. That business of winding the watch was wonderful.\"  \"I'm flattered, Mr. Royall,\" said the Duke, \"but I must admit that I got a great deal more credit in that case than was actually due me. Establishing the time element by winding the watch was suggested to me by another man, who wouldn't allow his name to be mentioned in the press.\"  I reminded myself to read up on the Duke's cases. Evidently he was better known than I had realized. Sometimes a man gets too wrapped up in his own work.  \"I'm sorry,\" Stevie said, \"but I've got to get going. I hope to see you again, Your Grace. So long, Dad--and thanks.\"  \"So long, son,\" I said. \"Take it easy.\"  His car moved off down the street, gathering speed.  \"Fine boy you have there,\" the Duke said.  \"Thanks. Shall we go on with our pub crawling?\"  \"Let's.\"         *       *       *       *       *  By two o'clock in the morning, we had heard nothing, found nothing. The Duke looked tired, and I knew that I was.  \"A few hours sleep wouldn't hurt either one of us,\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30832"],["title","Nor Iron Bars a Cage.... (#5)"],["body"," told His Grace. \"It's a cinch that Nestor won't be able to find any little girls at this hour of the morning, and I have a feeling that he probably bought himself a bottle and took it up to his room with him.\"  \"You're probably right,\" the Duke said wearily.  \"Look,\" I said, \"there's no point in your going all the way down to your hotel. My place is just across town, I have plenty of room, it will be no trouble to put you up, and we'll be ready to go in the morning. O.K.?\"  He grinned. \"Worded that way, the invitation is far too forceful to resist. I'm sold. I accept.\"  By that time, we had left several dollars worth of untasted beers sitting around in various bars on the West Side, so when I arrived at my apartment on the East Side, I decided that it was time for two tired cops to have a decent drink. The Duke relaxed on the couch while I mixed a couple of Scotch-and-waters. He lit a cigarette and blew out a cloud of smoke with a sigh.  \"Here, this will put sparks in your blood. Just a second, and I'll get you an ash tray.\" I went into the kitchen and got one of the ash trays from the top shelf and brought it back into the living room. Just as I put it down on the arm of the couch next to His Grace, the buzzer announced that there was someone at the front door downstairs.  I went over to the peeper screen and turned it on. The face was big-jawed and hard-mouthed, and there was scar tissue in the eyebrows and on the cheeks. He looked tough, but he also looked worried and frightened.  I could see him, but he couldn't see me, so I said: \"What's the trouble, Joey?\"  A look of relief came over his face. \"Can I see ya, Inspector? I saw your light was on. It's important.\" He glanced to his right, toward the doorway. \"Real important.\"  \"What's it all about, Joey?\"  \"Take a look out your window, Inspector. Across the street. They're friends of Freddy Velasquez. They been following me ever since I got off work.\"  \"Just a second,\" I said. I went over to the window that overlooks the street and looked down. There were two men there, all right, looking innocently into a delicatessen window. But I knew that Joey Partridge wasn't kidding, and that he knew who the men were. I went back to the peeper screen just as Joey buzzed my signal again. \"I buzzed again so they won't know you're home,\" he said before I could ask any questions. \"Freddy must've found out about my hands, Inspector. According to the word I got, they ain't carrying guns--just blackjacks and knucks.\"  \"O.K., Joey. Come on up, and I'll call a squad car to take you home.\"  He gave me a bitter grin. \"And have 'em coming after me again and again until they catch me? No, thanks, Inspector. In one minute, I'm going to walk across and ask 'em what they're following me for.\"  \"You can't do that, Joey!\"  He looked hurt. \"Inspector, since when it is against the law to ask a couple of guys how come they're following you? I just thought I oughta tell ya, that's all. So long.\"  I knew there was no point in arguing with Joey Partridge. I turned and said: \"Want some action, Your Grace?\"  But he was already on his feet, holding that walking stick of his. \"Anything you say.\"  \"Come on, then. We'll take the fire escape; the elevator is too slow. The fire escape will let us out in the alley, and we won't by outlined by the light in the foyer.\"  I already had the bedroom door open. I ran over to the window, opened it, and started down the steel stairway. The Duke was right behind me. It was only three floors down.  \"That Joey is too smart for his own good,\" I said, \"but he's right. This is the only way to work it. Otherwise, they'd have him in the hospital eventually--or maybe dead.\"  \"He looked like a man who could take care of himself,\" the Duke said.  \"That's just it. He can't. Come on.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The ladder to the street slid down smoothly and silently, and I thanked God for modern fire prevention laws. When we reached the street, I wondered where they could have gone to so quickly. Then the Duke said: \"There! In that darkened area-way next to the little shop!\" And he started running. His legs were longer than mine, and he reached the area-way a good five yards ahead of me.  Joey had managed to evade them for a short while, but they had cornered him, and one of them knocked him down just as the Duke came on the scene. The other had swung at his ribs with a blackjack as he dropped, and the first aimed a kick at Joey's midriff, but Joey rolled away from it.  Then the two thugs heard our footsteps and turned to meet us. If we'd been in uniform, they might have run; as it was, they stood their ground.  But not for long.  The Duke didn't use that stick as though it were a club, swinging it like a baseball bat. That would be as silly as using an overhand stab with a dagger. He used it the way a fencer would use a foil, and the hard, blunt end of it sank into the first thug's solar plexus with all the drive of the Duke's right arm and shoulder behind it. The thug gave a hoarse scream as all the air was driven from his lungs, and he dropped to the pavement.  The second man came in with his blackjack swinging. His hand stopped suddenly as his wrist met the deadly stick, but the blackjack kept on going, bouncing harmlessly off the nearby wall as it flew from nerveless fingers.  That stick never stopped moving. On the backswing, it thwacked resoundingly against the thug's ribcage. He grunted in pain and tried to charge forward to grapple with the Englishman. But His Grace was grace itself as he leaped backwards and then thrust forward with that wooden snake-tongue. The thug practically impaled himself on it. He stopped and twisted and was suddenly sick all over the pavement. Almost gently, the Duke tapped him across the side of his head, and he fell into his own mess.  It was all over before I'd even had a chance to mix in. I stood there, holding an eleven millimeter Magnum revolver in my hand and feeling vaguely foolish.  I reholstered the thing and walked over to where Joey Partridge was propping himself up to a sitting position. His right eye was bruised, and there was a trickle of blood running from the corner of his mouth, but he was grinning all the way across his battered face. And he wasn't looking at me; he was looking at the Duke.  \"You hurt, Joey?\" I asked. I knew he wasn't hurt badly; he'd taken worse punishment than that in his life.  He looked at me still grinning. \"Hurt? You're right I'm hurt, Inspector! Them goons tried to kill me. Let's see--assault and battery, assault with a deadly weapon, assault with intent to kill, assault with intent to maim, attempted murder, and--\" He paused. \"What else we got, Inspector?\"  \"We'll think on plenty,\" I said. \"Can you stand up?\"  \"Sure I can stand up. I want to shake the hand of your buddy, there. Geez! I ain't seen anything like that since I used to watch Bat Masterson on TV, when I was a little kid!\"  \"Joey, this is Chief Inspector the Duke Acrington, of Scotland Yard. Inspector, this is Joey Partridge, the greatest amateur boxer this country has ever produced.\"  Amazingly enough, Joey extended his hand. \"Pleased t'meetcha, Inspector! Uh--watch the hand. Sorta tender. That was great! Duke, did you say?\" He looked at me. \"You mean he's a real English Duke?\" He looked back at Acrington. \"I never met a Duke before!\" But by that time he had taken his hand away from the Duke's grasp.  \"It's a pleasure to meet you, Joey,\" the Duke said warmly. \"I liked the way you cleaned up on that Russian during the '72 Olympics.\"  Joey said to me, \"He remembers me! How d'ya like that?\"  One of the downed thugs began to groan, and I said, \"We'd better get the paddy wagon around to pick these boys up. You'll prefer charges, Joey?\"  \"Damn right I will! I didn't let myself get slugged for nothing!\"  It was nearly forty-five minutes later that the Duke and I found ourselves in my apartment again. The ice in our drinks had melted, so I dumped them and prepared fresh ones. The Duke took his, drained half of it in three fast swallows, and said: \"Ahhhhhh! I needed that.\"  We heard a key in the door, and His Grace looked at me.  \"That's my son,\" I said. \"Back from his date.\"  Steve came in looking happy. \"You still awake, Dad? A cop ought to get his sleep. Good morning, Your Grace. Both of you look sleepy.\"  Stevie didn't. He'd danced with Mary Ellen until four, and he still looked as though he could walk five miles without tiring. Me, I felt about as full of snap as a soda cracker in a Turkish bath. The three of us talked for maybe ten minutes, and then we hit the hay.         *       *       *       *       *  Three and a half hours of sleep isn't enough for anybody, but it was all we could afford to take. By eight-thirty, the Duke and I were in my office, sloshing down black coffee, and, half an hour after that, we were cruising up Amsterdam Avenue on the second day of our hunt for Mr. Lawrence Nestor.  Since we were now reasonably sure that our man was in the area, I ordered the next phase of the search into operation. There were squads of men making a house-to-house canvass of every hotel, apartment house, and rooming house in the area--and there are thousands of them. A flying squad took care of the hotels first; they were the most likely. Since we knew exactly what day Nestor had arrived, we narrowed our search down to the records for that day. Nestor might not use his own name; of course, but the photograph and description ought to help. And, since Nestor didn't have a job, his irregular schedule and his drinking habits might make him stand out, though there were plenty of places where those traits would simply make him one of the boys. It still looked like a long, hard search.  And then we got our break.  At 9:17 am, Lieutenant Holmquist's voice snapped over my car phone: \"Inspector Royall; Holmquist here. Child missing in Riverside Park. Officer Ramirez just called in from 111th and Riverside.\"  \"Got it!\"  I cut"]]]
