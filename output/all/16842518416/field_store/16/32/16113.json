Our esteemed friends of the Sixty-fourth Virginia, who were in camp at the little town of Jonesville, about 40 miles from the Gap, had learned of our starting up the Valley to drive them out, and they showed that warm reciprocity characteristic of the Southern soldier, by mounting and starting down the Valley to drive us out.  Nothing could be more harmonious, it will be perceived.  Barring the trifling divergence of yews as to who was to drive and who be driven, there was perfect accord in our ideas.  Our numbers were about equal.  If I were to say that they considerably outnumbered us, I would be following the universal precedent. No soldier-high or low-ever admitted engaging an equal or inferior force of the enemy.  About 9 o'clock in the morning--Sunday--they rode through the streets of Jonesville on their way to give us battle.  It was here that most of the members of the Regiment lived.  Every man, woman and child in the town was related in some way to nearly every one of the soldiers.  The women turned out to wave their fathers, husbands, brothers and lovers on to victory.  The old men gathered to give parting counsel and encouragement to their sons and kindred.  The Sixty-fourth rode away to what hope told them would be a glorious victory.  At noon we are still straggling along without much attempt at soldierly order, over the rough, frozen hill-sides.  It is yet bitterly cold, and men and horses draw themselves together, as if to expose as little surface as possible to the unkind elements.  Not a word had been spoken by any one for hours.  The head of the column has just reached the top of the hill, and the rest of us are strung along for a quarter of a mile or so back.  Suddenly a few shots ring out upon the frosty air from the carbines of the advance.  The general apathy is instantly, replaced by keen attention, and the boys instinctively range themselves into fours--the cavalry unit of action.  The Major, who is riding about the middle of the first Company--I--dashes to the front.  A glance seems to satisfy him, for he turns in his saddle and his voice rings out:  “Company I!  FOURS LEFT INTO LINE!--MARCH!!”  The Company swings around on the hill-top like a great, jointed toy snake.  As the fours come into line on a trot, we see every man draw his saber and revolver.  The Company raises a mighty cheer and dashes forward.  Company K presses forward to the ground Company I has just left, the fours sweep around into line, the sabers and revolvers come out spontaneously, the men cheer and the Company flings itself forward.  All this time we of Company L can see nothing except what the companies ahead of us are doing.  We are wrought up to the highest pitch.  As Company K clears its ground, we press forward eagerly.  Now we go into line just as we raise the hill, and as my four comes around, I catch a hurried glimpse through a rift in the smoke of a line of butternut and gray clad men a hundred yards or so away.  Their guns are at their faces, and I see the smoke and fire spurt from the muzzles.  At the same instant our sabers and revolvers are drawn.  We shout in a frenzy of excitement, and the horses spring forward as if shot from a bow.  I see nothing more until I reach the place where the Rebel line stood. Then I find it is gone.  Looking beyond toward the bottom of the hill, I see the woods filled with Rebels, flying in disorder and our men yelling in pursuit.  This is the portion of the line which Companies I and K struck.  Here and there are men in butternut clothing, prone on the frozen ground, wounded and dying.  I have just time to notice closely one middle-aged man lying almost under my horse's feet.  He has received a carbine bullet through his head and his blood colors a great space around him.  One brave man, riding a roan horse, attempts to rally his companions. He halts on a little knoll, wheels his horse to face us, and waves his hat to draw his companions to him.  A tall, lank fellow in the next four to me--who goes by the nickname of “'Leven Yards”--aims his carbine at him, and, without checking his horse's pace, fires.  The heavy Sharpe's bullet tears a gaping hole through the Rebel's heart.  He drops from his saddle, his life-blood runs down in little rills on either side of the knoll, and his riderless horse dashes away in a panic.  At this instant comes an order for the Company to break up into fours and press on through the forest in pursuit.  My four trots off to the road at the right.  A Rebel bugler, who hag been cut off, leaps his horse into the road in front of us.  We all fire at him on the impulse of the moment.  He falls from his horse with a bullet through his back.  Company M, which has remained in column as a reserve, is now thundering up close behind at a gallop.  Its seventy-five powerful horses are spurning the solid earth with steel-clad hoofs.  The man will be ground into a shapeless mass if left where he has fallen.  We spring from our horses and drag him into a fence corner; then remount and join in the pursuit.  This happened on the summit of Chestnut Ridge, fifteen miles from Jonesville.  Late in the afternoon the anxious watchers at Jonesville saw a single fugitive urging his well-nigh spent horse down the slope of the hill toward town.  In an agony of anxiety they hurried forward to meet him and learn his news.  The first messenger who rushed into Job's presence to announce the beginning of the series of misfortunes which were to afflict the upright man of Uz is a type of all the cowards who, before or since then, have been the first to speed away from the field of battle to spread the news of disaster.  He said:       “And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have      slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped      alone to tell thee.”  So this fleeing Virginian shouted to his expectant friends:  “The boys are all cut to pieces; I'm the only one that got away.”  The terrible extent of his words was belied a little later, by the appearance on the distant summit of the hill of a considerable mob of fugitives, flying at the utmost speed of their nearly exhausted horses. As they came on down the hill as almost equally disorganized crowd of pursuers appeared on the summit, yelling in voices hoarse with continued shouting, and pouring an incessant fire of carbine and revolver bullets upon the hapless men of the Sixty-fourth Virginia.  The two masses of men swept on through the town.  Beyond it, the road branched in several directions, the pursued scattered on each of these, and the worn-out pursuers gave up the chase.  Returning to Jonesville, we took an account of stock, and found that we were “ahead” one hundred and fifteen prisoners, nearly that many horses, and a considerable quantity of small arms.  How many of the enemy had been killed and wounded could not be told, as they were scattered over the whole fifteen miles between where the fight occurred and the pursuit ended.  Our loss was trifling.  Comparing notes around the camp-fires in the evening, we found that our success had been owing to the Major's instinct, his grasp of the situation, and the soldierly way in which he took advantage of it.  When he reached the summit of the hill he found the Rebel line nearly formed and ready for action.  A moment's hesitation might have been fatal to us. At his command Company I went into line with the thought-like celerity of trained cavalry, and instantly dashed through the right of the Rebel line.  Company K followed and plunged through the Rebel center, and when we of Company L arrived on the ground, and charged the left, the last vestige of resistance was swept away.  The whole affair did not probably occupy more than fifteen minutes.  This was the way Powell's Valley was opened to our foragers.     CHAPTER III.  LIVING OFF THE ENEMY--REVELING IN THE FATNESS OF THE COUNTRY--SOLDIERLY PURVEYING AND CAMP COOKERY--SUSCEPTIBLE TEAMSTERS AND THEIR TENDENCY TO FLIGHTINESS--MAKING SOLDIER'S BED.  For weeks we rode up and down--hither and thither--along the length of the narrow, granite-walled Valley; between mountains so lofty that the sun labored slowly over them in the morning, occupying half the forenoon in getting to where his rays would reach the stream that ran through the Valley's center.  Perpetual shadow reigned on the northern and western faces of these towering Nights--not enough warmth and sunshine reaching them in the cold months to check the growth of the ever-lengthening icicles hanging from the jutting cliffs, or melt the arabesque frost-forms with which the many dashing cascades decorated the adjacent rocks and shrubbery.  Occasionally we would see where some little stream ran down over the face of the bare, black rocks for many hundred feet, and then its course would be a long band of sheeny white, like a great rich, spotless scarf of satin, festooning the war-grimed walls of some old castle.  Our duty now was to break up any nuclei of concentration that the Rebels might attempt to form, and to guard our foragers--that is, the teamsters and employee of the Quartermaster's Department--who were loading grain into wagons and hauling it away.  This last was an arduous task.  There is no man in the world that needs as much protection as an Army teamster.  He is worse in this respect than a New England manufacturer, or an old maid on her travels.  He is given to sudden fears and causeless panics.  Very innocent cedars have a fashion of assuming in his eyes the appearance of desperate Rebels armed with murderous guns, and there is no telling what moment a rock may take such a form as to freeze his young blood, and make each particular hair stand on end like quills upon the fretful porcupine.  One has to be particular about snapping caps in his neighborhood, and give to him careful warning before discharging a carbine to clean it.  His first impulse, when anything occurs to jar upon his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3072"],["title","Andersonville: A Story of Rebel Military Prisons (#4)"],["body","nerves, is to cut his wheel-mule loose and retire with the precipitation of a man having an appointment to keep and being behind time.  There is no man who can get as much speed out of a mule as a teamster falling back from the neighborhood of heavy firing.  This nervous tremor was not peculiar to the engineers of our transportation department.  It was noticeable in the gentry who carted the scanty provisions of the Rebels.  One of Wheeler's cavalrymen told me that the brigade to which he belonged was one evening ordered to move at daybreak.  The night was rainy, and it was thought best to discharge the guns and reload before starting.  Unfortunately, it was neglected to inform the teamsters of this, and at the first discharge they varnished from the scene with such energy that it was over a week before the brigade succeeded in getting them back again.  Why association with the mule should thus demoralize a man, has always been a puzzle to me, for while the mule, as Col. Ingersoll has remarked, is an animal without pride of ancestry or hope of posterity, he is still not a coward by any means.  It is beyond dispute that a full-grown and active lioness once attacked a mule in the grounds of the Cincinnati Zoological Garden, and was ignominiously beaten, receiving injuries from which she died shortly afterward.  The apparition of a badly-scared teamster urging one of his wheel mules at break-neck speed over the rough ground, yelling for protection against “them Johnnies,” who had appeared on some hilltop in sight of where he was gathering corn, was an almost hourly occurrence.  Of course the squad dispatched to his assistance found nobody.  Still, there were plenty of Rebels in the country, and they hung around our front, exchanging shots with us at long taw, and occasionally treating us to a volley at close range, from some favorable point. But we had the decided advantage of them at this game.  Our Sharpe's carbines were much superior in every way to their Enfields.  They would shoot much farther, and a great deal more rapidly, so that the Virginians were not long in discovering that they were losing more than they gained in this useless warfare.  Once they played a sharp practical joke upon us.  Copper River is a deep, exceedingly rapid mountain stream, with a very slippery rocky bottom. The Rebels blockaded a ford in such a way that it was almost impossible for a horse to keep his feet.  Then they tolled us off in pursuit of a small party to this ford.  When we came to it there was a light line of skirmishers on the opposite bank, who popped away at us industriously. Our boys formed in line, gave the customary, cheer, and dashed in to carry the ford at a charge.  As they did so at least one-half of the horses went down as if they were shot, and rolled over their riders in the swift running, ice-cold waters.  The Rebels yelled a triumphant laugh, as they galloped away, and the laugh was re-echoed by our fellows, who were as quick to see the joke as the other side.  We tried to get even with them by a sharp chase, but we gave it up after a few miles, without having taken any prisoners.  But, after all, there was much to make our sojourn in the Valley endurable.  Though we did not wear fine linen, we fared sumptuously--for soldiers--every day.  The cavalryman is always charged by the infantry and artillery with having a finer and surer scent for the good things in the country than any other man in the service.  He is believed to have an instinct that will unfailingly lead him, in the dankest night, to the roosting place of the most desirable poultry, and after he has camped in a neighborhood for awhile it would require a close chemical analysis to find a trace of ham.  We did our best to sustain the reputation of our arm of the service. We found the most delicious hams packed away in the ash-houses. They were small, and had that; exquisite nutty flavor, peculiar to mast-fed bacon.  Then there was an abundance of the delightful little apple known as “romanites.”  There were turnips, pumpkins, cabbages, potatoes, and the usual products of the field in plenty, even profusion. The corn in the fields furnished an ample supply of breadstuff.  We carried it to and ground it in the quaintest, rudest little mills that can be imagined outside of the primitive affairs by which the women of Arabia coarsely powder the grain for the family meal.  Sometimes the mill would consist only of four stout posts thrust into the ground at the edge of some stream.  A line of boulders reaching diagonally across the stream answered for a dam, by diverting a portion of the volume of water to a channel at the side, where it moved a clumsily constructed wheel, that turned two small stones, not larger than good-sized grindstones.  Over this would be a shed made by resting poles in forked posts stuck into the ground, and covering these with clapboards held in place by large flat stones.  They resembled the mills of the gods--in grinding slowly. It used to seem that a healthy man could eat the meal faster than they ground it.  But what savory meals we used to concoct around the campfires, out of the rich materials collected during the day's ride!  Such stews, such soups, such broils, such wonderful commixtures of things diverse in nature and antagonistic in properties such daring culinary experiments in combining materials never before attempted to be combined.  The French say of untasteful arrangement of hues in dress “that the colors swear at each other.”  I have often thought the same thing of the heterogeneities that go to make up a soldier's pot-a feu.  But for all that they never failed to taste deliciously after a long day's ride.  They were washed down by a tincupful of coffee strong enough to tan leather, then came a brier-wood pipeful of fragrant kinnikinnic, and a seat by the ruddy, sparkling fire of aromatic cedar logs, that diffused at once warmth, and spicy, pleasing incense.  A chat over the events of the day, and the prospect of the morrow, the wonderful merits of each man's horse, and the disgusting irregularities of the mails from home, lasted until the silver-voiced bugle rang out the sweet, mournful tattoo of the Regulations, to the flowing cadences of which the boys had arranged the absurdly incongruous words:            “S-a-y--D-e-u-t-c-h-e-r-will-you fight-mit Sigel!           Zwei-glass of lager-bier, ja! ja! JA!”  Words were fitted to all the calls, which generally bore some relativeness to the sigmal, but these were as, destitute of congruity as of sense.  Tattoo always produces an impression of extreme loneliness.  As its weird, half-availing notes ring out and are answered back from the distant rocks shrouded in night, and perhaps concealing the lurking foe, the soldier remembers that he is far away from home and friends--deep in the enemy's country, encompassed on every hand by those in deadly hostility to him, who are perhaps even then maturing the preparations for his destruction.  As the tattoo sounds, the boys arise from around the fire, visit the horse line, see that their horses are securely tied, rub off from the fetlocks and legs such specks of mud as may have escaped the cleaning in the early evening, and if possible, smuggle their faithful four-footed friends a few ears of corn, or another bunch of hay.  If not too tired, and everything else is favorable, the cavalryman has prepared himself a comfortable couch for the night.  He always sleeps with a chum.  The two have gathered enough small tufts of pine or cedar to make a comfortable, springy, mattress-like foundation.  On this is laid the poncho or rubber blanket.  Next comes one of their overcoats, and upon this they lie, covering themselves with the two blankets and the other overcoat, their feet towards the fire, their boots at the foot, and their belts, with revolver, saber and carbine, at the sides of the bed. It is surprising what an amount of comfort a man can get out of such a couch, and how, at an alarm, he springs from it, almost instantly dressed and armed.  Half an hour after tattoo the bugle rings out another sadly sweet strain, that hath a dying sound.     CHAPTER IV.  A BITTER COLD MORNING AND A WARM AWAKENING--TROUBLE ALL ALONG THE LINE --FIERCE CONFLICTS, ASSAULTS AND DEFENSE--PROLONGED AND DESPERATE STRUGGLE ENDING WITH A SURRENDER.  The night had been the most intensely cold that the country had known for many years.  Peach and other tender trees had been killed by the frosty rigor, and sentinels had been frozen to death in our neighborhood.  The deep snow on which we made our beds, the icy covering of the streams near us, the limbs of the trees above us, had been cracking with loud noises all night, from the bitter cold.  We were camped around Jonesville, each of the four companies lying on one of the roads leading from the town.  Company L lay about a mile from the Court House.  On a knoll at the end of the village toward us, and at a point where two roads separated,--one of which led to us,--stood a three-inch Rodman rifle, belonging to the Twenty-second Ohio Battery. It and its squad of eighteen men, under command of Lieutenant Alger and Sergeant Davis, had been sent up to us a few days before from the Gap.  The comfortless gray dawn was crawling sluggishly over the mountain-tops, as if numb as the animal and vegetable life which had been shrinking all the long hours under the fierce chill.  The Major's bugler had saluted the morn with the lively, ringing tarr-r-r-a-ta-ara of the Regulation reveille, and the company buglers, as fast as they could thaw out their mouth-pieces, were answering him.  I lay on my bed, dreading to get up, and yet not anxious to lie still. It was a question which would be the more uncomfortable.  I turned over, to see if there was not another position in which it would be warmer, and began wishing for the thousandth time that the efforts for the amelioration of the horrors of warfare would"]]]
