Why not?\" the latter asked.  \"Don't understand.\"  \"Why not complete the work?  Those fellows have done precisely what we should have done--they've dug a hole and have run a tunnel from the bottom of it out below the open and below the entanglements.  It's there--ready for anyone who wants to get out of this place.  Anyone, Jules!  Don't you understand?\"  Stuart grabbed at Henri, and thrust his big, healthy face close up to his.  He was breathing deeply, in heavy gusts, and, but for the gathering darkness, it would have been seen that his eyes were shining, while he showed every sign of excitement.  \"Why not?  You fellows were thinking of making an escape?\" he asked.  \"Certainly,\" Henri told him; \"we've been saving our grub, and what money we could get.  We were ready but for the method, and now it's there--there in that hut--quite close to us, and it's dark enough, and--and--and there's no one about--why not?\"  \"Come on,\" said Stuart abruptly, in that resolute way he had.  \"I'm with you fellows, if you'll have me.\"  Without another word the trio turned promptly, and, looking round to make sure that no one had observed them, they bolted back to the hut from which those unfortunate prisoners had been dragged, and, closing the door behind them, leapt into the pit and made their way into the tunnel.  Freedom lay before them--freedom for which they pined--freedom to be had if only they could break their way into the open.     CHAPTER III  The Road to Freedom  \"What's this?  An old shovel, by the feel of it--the thing they've dug the tunnel with,\" Henri told his comrades as they stood at the entrance of the tunnel in the dense darkness, and felt all about them.  \"My fingers dropped upon it as I bent at the entrance, and, yes--here's a basket with a rope attached to it, into which, no doubt, one of them shovelled the earth at the far end of the tunnel, while his comrade dragged it to the bottom of the pit by means of the rope.  Poor chaps! How hard they must have worked, and what a disappointment it must have been to have failed just at the last moment.\"  \"That's just what we have got to look to,\" Stuart told them in a hoarse whisper.  \"They've done the work and have failed; let's look to it that we get out promptly.  Come along now.  Give me the spade, Henri, for I'm bigger and stronger than you, and, if there's only a foot of earth above our heads when we get to the far end of the tunnel, I'll bash a way through it without difficulty.  George!  What a narrow space it is! It hardly lets my shoulders through.\"  That tunnel, indeed, was hardly better than a rabbit burrow.  Perhaps four to five feet in height, it was scarcely two in breadth, cold and dark and winding.  Let us admit at once that it required no small stock of courage on the part of Stuart and his friends to force their way along it, particularly so in the case of the Englishman, whose frame was such a close fit to the damp earthen sides, that failure to break a way out at the far end would have left him in a difficult position--one from which he would undoubtedly have found it hard to extricate himself.  Yet there was liberty beyond, escape from this dreary Ruhleben with its monotonous routine, with its bullying Commandant and guards, with its sordid surroundings, and its sorry accommodation and short commons.  Thrusting on, therefore, pushing his way along the tunnel, squeezing himself into as small a compass as possible, Stuart forced a passage deeper into it, one hand feeling his way, while the other gripped the implement which Henri had discovered.  Ten yards, twenty, perhaps thirty were covered before a growl came from the leader.  \"The end!\" they heard him say.  \"I'm up against the far end of the tunnel, and that officer was quite right when he stated that it rose toward this end.  Now, hold your breath for a moment and listen while I thump the roof.  There--hollow--eh?  Not much earth above us.  Then stand back a little whilst I make a stroke for the open.\"  They heard the thuds as the shovel was dashed against the roof, and listened to clods of earth and debris falling.  It was precisely at the fifth stroke that a grunt escaped Stuart, while an instant later Henri felt a breath of fresh air, a cold gust sweeping past him.  \"The open!\" he exclaimed.  \"Go easy, Stuart, for it might not be dark enough yet, and impatience on our part might lead to our instant discovery.  Put your head up quietly as soon as you've made room.\"  There were more grunts in front, while from behind came a low, warning exclamation from Jules.  \"S--s--sh!\" he said.  \"I can hear someone in the hut behind us, for the sounds are travelling down the tunnel.  Push on into the open as fast as you can go, while I turn back and see what's happening.\"  There were more sounds then, as Jules, less bulky than Stuart, yet of formidable size when it came to free movement in this narrow tunnel, contrived by some acrobatic feat to turn himself about and face the pit from which they had started this adventure.  Then he crawled back towards the hut on all fours, listening to the suspicious sounds which he had heard, wondering who caused them, fearing that the German guards had come to make a nearer investigation of the pit and tunnel.  Yes, it was that, without a doubt; for there came to his ears now the sound of a man's two feet alighting at the bottom of the pit, a heavy thud, and the fall of earth as it tumbled from the sides of the pit to the bottom.  Then rays of light reached him as the person who had dropped into the pit switched on an electric torch and surveyed his surroundings.  Once more then Jules performed that acrobatic feat, and, twisting himself round with furious energy, hastened back to warn his comrades.  \"There's a fellow at the bottom of the pit already, and no doubt he'll be coming into the tunnel,\" he told them in a whisper.  \"He's got an electric torch, and that will be far worse than the light outside, for it'll show us up directly.  Shove on into the open.  Push your way through.  Hang the sentries!  We'll have to chance their seeing us.\"  More blows came from Stuart, lusty blows, and the sound of heavy breathing, then an exclamation, an exclamation of delight, of triumph, and later the sound of more earth falling.  That fresh breath of air which had swept into the tunnel became almost keen, while intuitively, for they could not see, Henri and Jules both realized that Stuart had already clambered from the place into the open.  \"Come now,\" they heard a voice.  \"Come up, quick, and lie down flat as soon as you are beside me.\"  Henri stumbled on till he was right at the end of the tunnel, and, standing upright, felt a hand stretched down towards him.  Gripping it, digging his toes into the sides of the tunnel, and seizing the edge above with his other hand, he was half dragged, and half forced his way upward, then, flinging himself on the ground beside Stuart, he leant over the ragged hole and helped to extricate his comrade.  They were free!  They were in the open!  They were beyond the wire entanglements!  And Germany lay before them--Germany, an enemy country, where every man's hand, aye, and every woman's too, would be against them.  Yet they were free, and what did it matter how many enemies they had to face, how many difficulties were before them?  For freedom, however much it might be embarrassed, however adventurous it might become, was freedom after all--a godsend compared with the privations, the gibes, the cruel treatment they had suffered in their prison.  If anyone had ever a doubt as to this, if, when this ghastly war which is now in progress is finished, a reader happen to think that there has been exaggeration in these statements, let him but look to facts, let him but consult the known history of the treatment of interned aliens and prisoners of war in the Kaiser's country.  Though war itself, and this one in particular with its long and terrible tale of casualties, is a ghastly business, the deliberate ill-treatment, the calculated starvation, and the wilful abandonment to misery and death from preventable disease of prisoners of war is a still more ghastly affair--an episode frequently repeated in the case of Germany.  \"Out!  Hurrah!  Mon Dieu!  Out of that awful hole,\" coughed Henri, shaking the dirt out of his hair and brushing it from behind his ears. \"Out, my boys!  Away from those German guards, and away from that Commandant and the whole breed of 'em.\"  Jules giggled.  He was possessed of a lighter nature altogether, was perhaps of more flippant disposition than his chum, and had less stamina about him.  Not that he was lacking in courage, or in dash, or in that Ã©lan which the French generally have displayed so magnificently in this conflict, only Jules was, perhaps, just a trifle effeminate, and giggles seemed to come almost naturally from him.  Now, as he lay close to the ragged edge of the opening through which he had been forcibly dragged by Stuart and Henri, and as he spluttered and blew dirt which had introduced itself into his mouth from his discoloured lips, he gave vent to a laugh, a smothered sound of merriment, perhaps a semi-hysterical giggle, in any case to a sound which grated on the senses of the Englishman terribly.  \"Burr!  Stop that!\" he commanded, and somehow, for some unascertained reason, Henri and Jules, who would have resented such tones from him on any other occasion, accepted them now without a murmur.  \"Shut up!\" growled Stuart.  \"Hist!  There's one of those beastly sentries coming near the entanglements--and what's that?\"  There were other sounds than those of steps within Ruhleben camp, that odious place of misery out of which they had broken, other noises than the heavy tramp of a ponderous Landsturm guard as he strode from behind the hut till the barbed-wire entanglements stopped his progress and he rattled his bayonet upon it, sounds which came from another "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30791"],["title","With Joffre at Verdun: A Story of the Western Front (#6)"],["body","from beneath the ground, from the tunnel in fact from which Henri and his friends had so recently emerged.  \"Hist!\" exclaimed Stuart in warning tones.  \"Keep as low and as flat as you can.  Thank goodness!  That sentry fellow, after making enough noise to drown the sound of our voices, has turned away without seeing us; but--but--what's that?\"  Henri stretched out a hand and gripped him by the sleeve.  \"Down there,\" he whispered, \"down there in the tunnel from which we have just come, there's someone stumbling along.  And cast your eye into the opening; isn't that the gleam of a torch?  Isn't that light being thrown in this direction?\"  It was, without the shadow of doubt.  For, as all three peered over the edge of the hole they had made so rapidly, thanks to the strength of Stuart, the depths below were illuminated for just a few seconds, and then were hidden in pitch-black darkness, which within a few moments was again lit up by a brilliant beam of light coming from a distance up the tunnel--that long path which they had followed, which had fitted the burly Stuart's shoulders so narrowly, and had made turning in his case an impossibility.  It acted now as a tube, and sent sounds along towards them, accentuated them, indeed, until there was no difficulty in deciding that a man was struggling and pushing his way towards them--a man armed with an electric torch, a fellow who breathed heavily, who swore beneath his breath and then out loud, and who set masses of earth tumbling down about him.  \"Better go,\" whispered Henri, when the cause of the sounds was quite certain, \"better slip away at once before the fellow finds the opening and shouts an alarm.\"  \"Wait!\"  Stuart stretched a hand out and gripped him with a grip of iron, a grip which held the vivacious Frenchman to the ground.  \"Not yet, for that bounder of a sentry is again coming towards us.  Lie low!\" he cautioned them; \"lie low, or he will see us.\"  \"But the man below with the light--he is nearer, far nearer,\" said Jules, who lay with his head well over the opening.  \"He'll be here in next to no time--then what?\"  Stuart dragged himself a little closer to that opening, and, keeping one eye on the sentry, glanced down to the bottom of the tunnel.  \"Leave the beggar to me,\" he said.  \"Look here, Henri, grope about for a stone--a brick--anything that's hard and will hurt, and can be thrown easily.  Ah! here's one--a big 'un too; you try the same, Jules, and get ready to heave at that sentry.  When I bash my fist against the fellow below, you throw your stones as hard as you can at the German inside the entanglements, and so put out his aim; not that there's much to be feared, seeing how dark it is at this moment.\"  Quick as thought, Henri grabbed the big stone which Stuart thrust into his hand, and, groping about, quickly secured another.  Then he slowly raised himself into a kneeling position, ready to spring to his feet and carry out the duty Stuart had given him.  Nor was it likely to be a very difficult matter to strike the sentry at that moment hammering again on the barbed wire which formed the fences about the camp at Ruhleben, for though without doubt Henri and his friends lay invisible, close to the ground, the burly figure of the German stood out, huge and broad and solid, silhouetted faintly in the darkness by lights flickering from the range of shelters on the far side of the camp.  As for Jules, he, too, quickly secured missiles with which to bombard the sentry, and, as if to show how ready he was for the work in hand, gave vent again to one of those subdued giggles; whereat Stuart growled--a fierce growl--and nudged him violently.  Then, of a sudden, the attention of all three was fixed on the hole through which they had emerged, and upon the depths below it.  The rough sides of the tunnel, the debris and earth which they themselves had dragged down to the foot of it as they cut their path upward, every stone, every clod, was visible, as the torch--now closer at hand--lit up every crevice.  Then the torch itself came into view, the hand which gripped it, the sleeve about the wrist, and finally the shoulders and the head of the individual stumbling and forcing his way towards them.  \"Ach, Himmel!  What a find!  The wretches were almost escaping.  What perseverance, though; what hard work; and, yes, what hard luck to have been discovered just on the eve of breaking out of their prison!\"  It was the small, snappy under-officer who had appeared on the scene outside the hut but a few minutes earlier, and who, discovering the Sergeant there browbeating the unfortunate sentry, had turned upon him like a dog, had snapped at his heels as it were, had changed the aspect of affairs entirely, and had ended in putting the non-commissioned officer under arrest, and in himself capturing those unlucky prisoners who were hiding in the tunnel.  Doubtless it was a brilliant evening's work for him--work which might even bring him reward--who knows?--might even, in the end, bring him that Iron Cross which the Kaiser has been so fond of distributing.  Men in the ranks of the German army had received that reward for lesser acts than that of the under-officer this evening; there are heroes in the armies of the All-Highest Kaiser who have been decorated with that Iron Cross for valour, and others who wear the emblem for deeds which make the rest of civilization shudder.  Yes, indeed, the under-officer might well earn such reward, for he had shown acuteness, promptitude, and dispatch in carrying out his duties.  \"But what's this?\" Henri and Stuart and Jules heard him say, a second later, as his other hand came into view, groping along the floor of the tunnel and plunging deep into the loose soil so recently pulled from the roof above.  \"The tunnel ends abruptly, and above--what's this?--above, the ruffians were making a hole.  But this is strange, for when I entered before there was no sign of such a thing.  The tunnel ended just here, as it does now, and the earth at its foot was hard and beaten, while above it was hard as well, but shook and gave out a hollow sound.  What's this?  Ah!  A hole.\"  It was with amazement that his eyes fell upon the ragged edge of the opening above, as the beams from his electric torch fell upon it.  He stumbled and struggled forward, and, rising to his feet, shot his hands upward to grip the edge above him.  He would, perhaps, have given vent to a shout had not Stuart, lying immediately over the tunnel, in fact right above the figure of the German, leaned down, and, stretching his hands below him, gripped the German by the nape of the neck with one hand, and the electric torch with the other, jerking the latter back into the tunnel, where it lay with its beams flashing in the opposite direction.  He then proceeded to draw the German up towards him as one draws the cork out of the neck of a bottle, to extricate him in spite of his kicks and struggles; while that other hand, set free from the torch, was clapped over his mouth, smothering any sounds of which the under-officer was capable.  Not that it was an easy matter to give vent to a shout of alarm in such a position, for Stuart's huge fingers and thumb gripped the German so fiercely and firmly about the neck, just below his jaws, that movement of the latter was impossible, and the very attempt to make a sound was excessively painful.  Up then he came slowly, struggling, his hands beating the earth and reaching up in the endeavour to grip his assailant, his heavily shod feet lashing to and fro and kicking clods of earth from the sides of the tunnel; up till his head was clear of the opening, till almost half his body had been extricated; and then, when Stuart, now on his feet and half upright, had placed himself in a favourable position, suddenly the German was shot back into the place from which he had just been dragged, shot back with unexpectedness and violence, till he came with a crash against the bottom of the tunnel, and, collapsing there, rolled backwards into it.  As one can imagine, though the under-officer had given vent to no sound--no shout of warning--the noise of his coming through the tunnel, the flash of his torch and its beams sweeping through the opening above, had attracted the attention of the sentry.  The man faced that direction promptly, and brought his rifle to the ready.  Then for a while he waited, while Stuart was dragging the German upward, and, indeed, until there came the heavy thud which told of the under-officer's arrival at the bottom of the tunnel.  \"What's that?\" challenged the sentry.  \"Who goes there?  Halt, and declare yourself!\"  \"Fire!\" whispered Henri, and, standing up, he cast first one stone and then the other at the sentry, while Jules followed suit without waiting, a loud cry of pain and the dull sound of a blow telling that one of the missiles at least had hit the German.  \"Now come!\" said Stuart.  \"We're lucky in the fact that the fellow hasn't fired his rifle, though he's shouting hard enough to rouse every man in the camp, and will soon have them all about him.  Which way, you fellows?  You know more about the business and the place than I do, for I'm a stranger in these parts, and, bad luck to it, know precious little of Germany and the Germans.  Bad luck, did I say? when I've seen far too much of them in these months past since I came to Ruhleben. But what's the move?  Which way do we turn?  Where do we go?  And how are we going to get on for victuals?\"  That was the worst of this sudden escape, this movement out of the camp without calm thought and contemplation of the future.  They had no plans--not a single one--and they had no idea whither to go, or which way to turn, nor where they might seek safety.  True, Henri and Jules had discussed the matter on many an occasion, and had, indeed, as we know, been diligently, and with much self-sacrifice, hoarding up what food they could--and in all conscience they had little enough "]]]
