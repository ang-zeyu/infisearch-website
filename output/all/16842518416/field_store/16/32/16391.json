The query is abnormal, when “precept upon precept; [10] line upon line” are to be found in the Scriptures, and in my books, on this very subject.  In Mark, ninth chapter, commencing at the thirty- third verse, you will find my views on this subject; love alone is admissible towards friend and foe. My sym- [15] pathies extend to the above-named class of students more than to many others. If I had the time to talk with all students of Christian Science, and correspond with them, I would gladly do my best towards helping those un- fortunate seekers after Truth whose teacher is straying [20] from the straight and narrow path. But I have not mo- ments enough in which to give to my own flock all the time and attention that they need,—and charity must begin at home.  Distinct denominational and social organizations and [25] societies are at present necessary for the individual, and for our Cause. But all people can and should be just, merciful; they should never envy, elbow, slander, hate, or try to injure, but always should try to bless their fellow-mortals. [30]  To the query in regard to some clergyman’s com-  [Page 33.]  ments on my illustrated poem, I will say: It is the righteous [1] prayer that avails with God. Whatever is wrong will receive its own reward. The high priests of old caused the crucifixion of even the great Master; and thereby they lost, and he won, heaven. I love all ministers and [5] ministries of Christ, Truth.  All clergymen may not understand the illustrations in “Christ and Christmas;” or that these refer not to personality, but present the type and shadow of Truth’s appearing in the womanhood as well as in the manhood [10] of God, our divine Father and Mother.  _Must I have faith in Christian Science in order to be_ _healed by it?_  This is a question that is being asked every day. It has not proved impossible to heal those who, when they [15] began treatment, had no faith whatever in the Science, —other than to place themselves under my care, and follow the directions given. Patients naturally gain con- fidence in Christian Science as they recognize the help they derive therefrom. [20]  _What are the advantages of your system of healing, over_ _the ordinary methods of healing disease?_  Healing by Christian Science has the following advantages:—  _First_: It does away with all material medicines, and [25] recognizes the fact that, as mortal mind is the cause of all “the ills that flesh is heir to,” the antidote for sickness, as well as for sin, may and must be found in mortal mind’s opposite,—the divine Mind.  _Second_: It is more effectual than drugs; curing where [30]  [Page 34.]  these fail, and leaving none of the harmful “after effects” [1] of these in the system; thus proving that metaphysics is above physics.  _Third:_ One who has been healed by Christian Sci- ence is not only healed of the disease, but is improved [5] morally. The body is governed by mind; and mortal mind must be improved, before the body is renewed and harmonious,—since the physique is simply thought made manifest.  _Is spiritualism or mesmerism included in Christian_ [10] _Science?_  They are wholly apart from it. Christian Science is based on divine Principle; whereas spiritualism, so far as I understand it, is a mere speculative opinion and human belief. If the departed were to communicate [15] with us, we should see them as they were before death, and have them with us; after death, they can no more come to those they have left, than we, in our present state of existence, can go to the departed or the adult can re- turn to his boyhood. We may pass on to their state [20] of existence, but they cannot return to ours. Man is _im_-mortal, and there is not a moment when he ceases to exist. All that are called “communications from spirits,” lie within the realm of mortal thought on this present plane of existence, and are the antipodes of Christian Science; [25] the immortal and mortal are as direct opposites as light and darkness.  _Who is the Founder of mental healing?_  The author of “Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,” who discovered the Science of healing em- [30]  [Page 35.]  bodied in her works. Years of practical proof, through [1] homœopathy, revealed to her the fact that Mind, in- stead of matter, is the Principle of pathology; and subsequently her recovery, through the supremacy of Mind over matter, from a severe casualty pronounced [5] by the physicians incurable, sealed that proof with the signet of Christian Science. In 1883, a million of peo- ple acknowledge and attest the blessings of this mental system of treating disease. Perhaps the following words of her husband, the late Dr. Asa G. Eddy, [10] afford the most concise, yet complete, summary of the matter:—  “Mrs, Eddy’s works are the outgrowths of her life. I never knew so unselfish an individual.”  _Will the book Science and Health, that you offer for sale_ [15] _at three dollars, teach its readers to heal the sick,—or is_ _one obliged to become a student under your personal in-_ _struction? And if one is obliged to study under you, of_ _what benefit is your book?_  Why do we read the Bible, and then go to church to [20] hear it expounded? Only because both are important. Why do we read moral science, and then study it at college?  You are benefited by reading Science and Health, but it is greatly to your advantage to be taught its Science [25] by the author of that work, who explains it in detail.  _What is immortal Mind?_  In reply, we refer you to “Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,”(2) Vol. I. page 14: “That which  [Page 36.]  is erring, sinful, sick, and dying, termed material or [1] mortal man, is neither God’s man nor Mind; but to be understood, we shall classify evil and error as mortal mind, in contradistinction to good and Truth, or the Mind which is immortal.” [5]  _Do animals and beasts have a mind?_  Beasts, as well as men, express Mind as their origin; but they manifest less of Mind. The first and only cause is the eternal Mind, which is God, and there is but one God. The ferocious mind seen in the beast is [10] mortal mind, which is harmful and proceeds not from God; for His beast is the lion that lieth down with the lamb. Appetites, passions, anger, revenge, subtlety, are the animal qualities of sinning mortals; and the beasts that have these propensities express the lower [15] qualities of the so-called animal man; in other words, the nature and quality of mortal mind,—not immortal Mind.  _What is the distinction between mortal mind and immortal_ _Mind?_ [20]  Mortal mind includes all evil, disease, and death; also, all beliefs relative to the so-called material laws, and all material objects, and the law of sin and death.  The Scripture says, “The carnal mind [in other words, mortal mind] is enmity against God; for it is not sub- [25] ject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.” Mortal mind is an illusion; as much in our waking moments as in the dreams of sleep. The belief that intelligence, Truth, and Love, are in matter and separate from God, is an error; for there is no intelligent evil, and no power [30]  [Page 37.]  besides God, good. God would not be omnipotent if [1] there were in reality another mind creating or governing man or the universe.  Immortal Mind is God; and this Mind is made manifest in all thoughts and desires that draw man- [5] kind toward purity, health, holiness, and the spiritual facts of being.  Jesus recognized this relation so clearly that he said, “I and my Father are one.” In proportion as we oppose the belief in material sense, in sickness, sin, and death, [10] and recognize ourselves under the control of God, spiritual and immortal Mind, shall we go on to leave the animal for the spiritual, and learn the meaning of those words of Jesus, “Go ye into all the world ... heal the sick.” [15]  _Can your Science cure intemperance?_  Christian Science lays the axe at the root of the tree. Its antidote for all ills is God, the perfect Mind, which corrects mortal thought, whence cometh all evil. God can and does destroy the thought that leads to moral [20] or physical death. Intemperance, impurity, sin of every sort, is destroyed by Truth. The appetite for alcohol yields to Science as directly and surely as do sickness and sin.  _Does Mrs. Eddy take patients?_ [25]  She now does not. Her time is wholly devoted to in- struction, leaving to her students the work of healing; which, at this hour, is in reality the least difficult of the labor that Christian Science demands.  [Page 38.]  _Why do you charge for teaching Christian Science, when_ [1] _all the good we can do must be done freely?_  When teaching imparts the ability to gain and main- tain health, to heal and elevate man in every line of life,—as this teaching certainly does,—is it un- [5] reasonable to expect in return something to support one’s self and a Cause? If so, our whole system of education, secular and religious, is at fault, and the instructors and philanthropists in our land should ex- pect no compensation. “If we have sown unto you [10] spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?”  _How happened you to establish a college to instruct in_ _metaphysics, when other institutions find little interest in_ _such a dry and abstract subject?_ [15]  Metaphysics, as taught by me at the Massachusetts Metaphysical College, is far from dry and abstract. It is a Science that has the animus of Truth. Its practical application to benefit the race, heal the sick, enlighten and reform the sinner, makes divine metaphysics need- [20] ful, indispensable. Teaching metaphysics at other col- leges means, mainly, elaborating a man-made theory, or some speculative view too"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31427"],["title","Miscellaneous Writings, 1883-1896 (#7)"],["body","and hypothetical for questions of practical import.  _Is it necessary to study your Science in order to be healed_ [25] _by it and keep well?_  It is not necessary to make each patient a student in order to cure his present disease, if this is what you mean. Were it so, the Science would be of less  [Page 39.]  practical value. Many who apply for help are not [1] prepared to take a course of instruction in Christian Science.  To avoid being _subject_ to disease, would require the understanding of how you are healed. In 1885, this [5] knowledge can be obtained in its genuineness at the Massachusetts Metaphysical College. There are abroad at this early date some grossly incorrect and false teachers of what they term Christian Science; of such beware. They have risen up in a day to make this claim; [10] whereas the Founder of genuine Christian Science has been all her years in giving it birth.  _Can you take care of yourself?_  God giveth to every one this _puissance_; and I have faith in His promise, “Lo, I am with you alway”— [15] _all the way_. Unlike the M. D.’s, Christian Scientists are not afraid to take their own medicine, for this medicine is divine Mind; and from this saving, ex- haustless source they intend to fill the human mind with enough of the leaven of Truth to leaven the whole lump. [20] There may be exceptional cases, where one Christian Scientist who has more to meet than others needs support at times; then, it is right to bear “one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.”  _In what way is a Christian Scientist an instrument by_ [25] _which God reaches others to heal them, and what most_ _obstructs the way?_  A Christian, or a Christian Scientist, assumes no more when claiming to work with God in healing the sick, than in converting the sinner. Divine help is as neces-  [Page 40.]  sary in the one case as in the other. The scientific Prin- [1] ciple of healing demands such cooperation; but this unison and its power would be arrested if one were to mix material methods with the spiritual,—were to min- gle hygienic rules, drugs, and prayers in the same pro- [5] cess,—and thus serve “other gods.” Truth is as effectual in destroying sickness as in the destruction of sin.  It is often asked, “If Christian Science is the same method of healing that Jesus and the apostles used, [10] why do not its students perform as instantaneous cures as did those in the first century of the Christian era?”  In some instances the students of Christian Science equal the ancient prophets as healers. All true healing is governed by, and demonstrated on, the same Princi- [15] ple as theirs; namely, the action of the divine Spirit, through the power of Truth to destroy error, discord of whatever sort. The reason that the same results fol- low not in every ease, is that the student does not in every case possess sufficiently the Christ-spirit and its [20] power to cast out the disease. The Founder of Chris- tian Science teaches her students that they must possess the spirit of Truth and Love, must gain the power over sin in themselves, or they cannot be instantaneous healers. [25]  In this Christian warfare the student or practitioner has to master those elements of evil too common to other minds. If it is hate that is holding the purpose to kill his patient by mental means, it requires more divine understanding to conquer this sin than to nullify either [30] the disease itself or the ignorance by which one unin- tentionally harms himself or another. An element of  [Page 41.]  brute-force that only the cruel and evil can send forth, is [1] given vent in the diabolical practice of one who, having learned the power of liberated thought to do good, per- verts it, and uses it to accomplish an evil purpose. This mental malpractice would disgrace Mind-healing, were it [5] not that God overrules it, and causes “the wrath of man” to praise Him. It deprives those who practise it of the power to heal, and destroys their own possibility of progressing.  The honest student of Christian Science is purged [10] through Christ, Truth, and thus is ready for victory in the ennobling strife. The good fight must be fought by those who keep the faith and finish their course. Mental purgation must go on: it promotes spiritual growth, scales the mountain of human endeavor, and gains the [15] summit in Science that otherwise could not be reached, —where the struggle with sin is forever done.  _Can all classes of disease be healed by your method?_  We answer, Yes. Mind is the architect that builds its own idea, and produces all harmony that appears. [20] There is no other healer in the case. If mortal mind, through the action of fear, manifests inflammation and a belief of chronic or acute disease, by removing the cause in that so-called mind the effect or disease will disappear and health will be restored; for health, _alias_ harmony, [25] is the normal manifestation of man in Science. The divine Principle which governs the universe, including man, if demonstrated, is sufficient for all emergencies. But the practitioner may not always prove equal to bringing out the result of the Principle that he knows to [30] be true.  [Page 42.]  _After the change called death takes place, do we meet_ [1] _those gone before?—or does life continue in thought only_ _as in a dream?_  Man is not annihilated, nor does he lose his identity, by passing through the belief called death. After the [5] momentary belief of dying passes from mortal mind, this mind is still in a conscious state of existence; and the in- dividual has but passed through a moment of extreme mortal fear, to awaken with thoughts, and being, as material as before. Science and Health clearly states [10] that spiritualization of thought is not attained by the death of the body, but by a conscious union with God. When we shall have passed the ordeal called death, or destroyed this last enemy, and shall have come upon the same plane of conscious existence with those gone before, then we [15] shall be able to communicate with and to recognize them.  If, before the change whereby we meet the dear de- parted, our life-work proves to have been well done, we shall not have to repeat it; but our joys and means of ad- vancing will be proportionately increased. [20]  The difference between a belief of material existence and the spiritual fact of Life is, that the former is a dream and unreal, while the latter is real and eternal. Only as we understand God, and learn that good, not evil, lives and is immortal, that immortality exists only in [25] spiritual perfection, shall we drop our false sense of Life in sin or sense material, and recognize a better state of existence.  _Can I be treated without being present during treatment?_  Mind is not confined to limits; and nothing but our [30] own false admissions prevent us from demonstrating this  [Page 43.]  great fact. Christian Science, recognizing the capabili- [1] ties of Mind to act of itself, and independent of matter, enables one to heal cases without even having seen the individual,—or simply after having been made ac- quainted with the mental condition of the patient. [5]  _Do all who at present claim to be teaching Christian_ _Science, teach it correctly?_  By no means: Christian Science is not sufficiently un- derstood for that. The student of this Science who under- stands it best, is the one least likely to pour into other [10] minds a trifling sense of it as being adequate to make safe and successful practitioners. The simple sense one gains of this Science through careful, unbiased, contemplative reading of my books, is far more advantageous to the sick and to the learner than is or can be the spurious [15] teaching of those who are spiritually unqualified. The sad fact at this early writing is, that the letter is gained sooner than the spirit of Christian Science: time is re- quired thoroughly to qualify students for the great ordeal of this century. [20]  If one student tries to undermine another, such sinister rivalry does a vast amount of injury to the Cause. To fill one’s pocket at the expense of his conscience, or to build on the downfall of others, incapacitates one to practise or teach Christian Science. The occasional tem- [25] porary success of such an one is owing, in part, to the im- possibility for those unacquainted with the mighty Truth of _Christian_ Science to recognize, as such, the barefaced errors that are taught—and the damaging effects these leave on the practice of the learner, on the Cause, and [30] on the health of the community.  [Page 44.]  Honest students speak the truth “according to the [1] pattern showed to thee in the mount,” and live it: these are not working for emoluments, and may profitably teach people, who are ready to investigate this subject, the rudiments of Christian Science. [5]  _Can Christian Science cure acute cases where there is_ _necessity for immediate relief, as in membranous croup?_  The remedial power of Christian Science is positive, and its application direct. It cannot fail to heal in every case of disease, when conducted by one who un- [10] derstands this Science sufficiently to demonstrate its highest possibilities.  _If I have the toothache, and nothing stops it until I_ _have the tooth extracted, and then the pain ceases, has_ _the mind, or extracting, or both, caused the pain to_ [15] _cease?_  What you thought was pain in the bone or nerve, could only have been a belief of pain in matter; for matter has no sensation. It was a state of mortal thought made manifest in the flesh. You call this body matter, when [20] awake, or when asleep in a dream. That matter can re- report pain, or that mind is _in_ matter, reporting sensa- tions, is but a dream at all times. You believed that if the tooth were extracted, the pain would cease: this de- mand of mortal thought once met, your belief assumed [25] a new form, and said, There is no more pain.
