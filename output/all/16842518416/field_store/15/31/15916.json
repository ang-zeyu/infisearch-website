Fredrick, the _maître de hôtel_, however, was able to greet them both by name. “Monsieur Hackett, Monsieur Woolford,” he bowed. He obviously didn’t approve of La Calvados being used as a hangout where counterfeiters were picked up the authorities.  “Where is she?” Steve said, looking out over the public dining room.  Fredrick said, unprofessionally agitated, “See here, Monsieur Hackett, you didn’t expect to, ah, arrest the young lady _here_ during our lunch hour?”  Steve looked at him impatiently. “We don’t exactly beat them over the head with blackjacks, slip the bracelets on and drag them screaming to the paddywagon.”  “Of course not, monsieur, but—”  Larry Woolford’s chief dined here several times a week and was probably on the best of terms with Fredrick whose decisions on tables and whose degree of servility had a good deal of influence on a man’s status in Greater Washington. Larry said wearily, “We can wait until she leaves. Where is she?”  Fredrick had taken them to one side.  “Do you see the young lady over near the window on the park? The rather gauche appearing type?”  It was a teenager, all right. A youngster up to her eyebrows in the attempt to project sophistication.  Steve said, “Do you know who she is?”  “No,” Fredrick said. “Hardly our usual clientele.”  “Oh?” Larry said. “She looks like money.”  Fredrick said, “The dress appears as though it is of Chez Marie, but she wears it as though it came from Klein’s. Her perfume is Chanel, but she has used approximately three times the quantity one would expect.”  “That’s our girl, all right,” Steve murmured. “Where can we keep an eye on her until she leaves?”  “Why not at the bar here, Messieurs?”  “Why not?” Larry said. “I could use a drink.”  Fredrick cleared his throat. “Ah, Messieurs, that fifty I turned over you. I suppose it turned out to be spurious?”  Steve grinned at him. “Afraid so, Fredrick. The department is holding it.”  Larry took out his wallet. “However, we have a certain leeway on expenses on this assignment and appreciate your co-operation.” He handed two twenties and a ten to the _maître d’_. Fredrick bowed low, the money disappearing into his clothes magically. “_Merci bien_, monsieur.”  At the bar, Steve scowled at his colleague. “Ha!” he said. “Why didn’t I think of that first? He’ll get down on his knees and bump his head each time he sees you in the joint from now on.”  Larry Woolford waggled a finger at the other. “This is a status conscious town, my boy. Prestige means everything. When I take over my Boss’ job, maybe we can swing a transfer and I’ll give you a position suitable to your attainments.” He pursed his lips judiciously. “Although, come to think of it, that might mean a demotion from the job you’re holding now.”  “Vodka martini,” Steve told the bartender. “Polish vodka, of course.”  “Of course, sir.”  Larry said, “Same for me.”  The bartender left and Steve muttered, “I hate vodka.”  “Yeah,” Larry said, “But what’re you going to do in a place like this, order some weird drink?”  Steve dug into his pocket for money. “We’re not going to have to drink them. Here she comes.”  She walked with her head held high, hauteur in every step. Ignoring the peasants at the tables she passed.  “Holy smokes,” Steve grunted. “It’s a wonder Fredrick let her in.”  She hesitated momentarily before the doorway of the prestige restaurant allowing the passers-by to realize she’d just emerged, and then turned to her right to promenade along the shopping street.  Fifty feet below La Calvados, Steve said, “Let’s go, Woolford.”  One stepped to one elbow, the other to the other. Steve said quietly, “I wonder if we could ask you a few questions?”  Her eyebrows went up, “I _beg_ your pardon!”  Steve sighed and displayed the badge pinned to his wallet, keeping it inconspicuous. “Secret Service, Miss,” he murmured.  “Oh, devil,” she said. She looked up at Larry Woolford, and then back at Steve.  Steve said, “Among other things, we’re in charge of counterfeit money.”  She was about five foot four in her heels, had obviously been on a round of beauty shops and had obviously instructed them to glamorize her. It hadn’t come off. She still looked as though she’d be more at home as cheerleader of the junior class in small town high school. She was honey blond, green-blue of eye, and had that complexion they seldom carry even into the twenties.  “I ... I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Her chin began to tremble.  Larry said gently, “Don’t worry. We just want to ask you some questions.”  “Well ... like what?” She was going to be blinking back tears in a moment. At least Larry hoped she’d blink them back. He’d hate to have her start howling here in public.  Larry said, “We think you can be of assistance to the government, and we’d like your help.”  Steve rolled his eyes upward, but turned and waved for a street level cab.  In the cab, Larry said, “Suppose we go over to my office, Steve?”  “O.K. with me,” Steve muttered, “but by the looks of the young lady here, I think it’s a false alarm from your angle. She’s obviously an American. What’s your name, Miss?”  “It’s Zusanette. Well, really, Susan.”  “Susan what?”  “I ... I’m not sure I want to tell you. I ... I want a lawyer.”  “A lawyer!” Steve snorted. “You mean you want the juvenile authorities, don’t you?”  “Oh, what a mean thing to say,” she sputtered.                    -------------------------------------  In the corridor outside the Boss’ suite of offices, Larry said to Steve, “You take Miss ... ah, Zusanette to my office, will you Steve. I’ll be there in a minute.”  He opened the door to the anteroom and said, “LaVerne, we’ve got a girl in my office—”  “Why, Larry!”  He glowered at her. “A suspect. I want a complete tape of everything said. As soon as we’re through, have copies made, at least three or four.”  “And, who, Mr. Woolford, was your girl Friday last year?”  “This is important, honey. I suppose you’ve supplied me with a secretary but I haven’t even met her yet. Take care of it, will you?”  “Sure enough, Larry.”  He followed Steve and the girl to his office.  Once seated, the girl and Steve in the only two extra chairs the cubicle boasted and Larry behind his desk, he looked at her in what he hoped was reassurance. “Just tell us where you got the money, Zusanette.”  Steve reached out a hand suddenly and took her bag from her lap. She gasped and snatched at it, but he eluded her and she sat back, her chin trembling again.  Steve came up with a thick sheaf of bills, the top ones, at least, all fifties and tossed them to Larry’s desk. He took out a school pass and read, “Susan Self, Elwood Avenue.” He looked up at Larry and said, “That’s right off Eastern, near Paterson Park in the Baltimore section of town, isn’t it?”  Larry said to her, “Zusanette, I think you’d better tell us where you got all this money.”  “I found it,” she said defiantly. “You can’t do anything to me if I simply found it. Anybody can find money. Finders keepers—”  “But if it’s counterfeit,” Steve interrupted dryly, “it might also be, finders weepers.”  “Where did you find it, Zusanette?” Larry said gently.  She tightened her lips, and the trembling of her chin disappeared. “I ... I can’t tell you that. But it’s not counterfeit. Daddy ... my father said it was as good as any money the government prints.”  “That it is,” Steve said sourly. “But it’s still counterfeit, which makes it very illegal indeed to spend, Miss Self.”  She looked from one of them to the other, not clear about her position. She said to Larry, “You mean it’s not _real_ money?”  He kept his tone disarming, but shook his head, “I’m afraid not, Zusanette. Now, tell us, where did you find it?”  “I can’t. I promised”  “I see. Then you don’t know to whom it originally belonged?”  “It didn’t belong to anybody.”  Steve Hackett made with a disbelieving whistle. He was taking the part of the tough, suspicious cop; Larry the part of the understanding, sympathetic officer, trying to give the suspect a break.  Susan Self turned quickly on Steve. “Well, it didn’t. You don’t even know.”  Larry said, “I think she’s telling the truth, Steve. Give her a chance. She’s playing fair.” He looked back at the girl, and frowned his puzzlement. “All money belongs to _somebody_ doesn’t it?”  She had them now. She said superiorly. “Not necessarily to some_body_. It can belong to, like, an organization.”  Steve grunted skepticism. “I think we ought to arrest her,” he said.  Larry held up a hand, his face registering opposition. “I’ll handle this,” he said sharply. “Zusanette is doing everything she can to co-operate.” He turned back to the girl. “Now, the question is, what organization did this money belong to?”  She looked triumphantly at Steve Hackett. “It belonged to the Movement.”  They both looked at her.  Steve said finally, “What movement?”  She pouted in thought. “That’s the only name they call it.”  “Who’s they?” Steve snapped nastily.  “I ... I don’t know.”  Larry said, “Well, you already told us your father was a member, Zusanette.”  Her eyes went wide. “I did? I shouldn’t have said that.” But she evidently took him at his word.  Larry said encouragingly, “Well, we might as well go on. Who else is a member of this Movement besides your father?”  She shifted in her chair uncomfortably. “I don’t know any of their names.”  Steve looked down at the school pass in his hands. He said to Larry, “I’d better make a phone call.”  He left.                    -------------------------------------  Larry said, “Don’t worry about him, Zusanette. Now then, this _movement_. That’s kind of a funny name, isn’t it? What does it mean?”  She was evidently glad that the less than handsome Steve Hackett had left the room. Her words flowed more freely. “Well, Daddy says that they call it the Movement rather than a revolution....”  An ice cube manifested itself in the stomach of Lawrence Woolford.  “... Because people get conditioned, like,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30339"],["title","Status Quo (#3)"],["body"," to words. Like revolution. Everybody is against the word because they all think of killing and everything, and, Daddy says, there doesn’t have to be any shooting or killing or anything like that at all. It just means a fundamental change in society. And, Daddy says, take the word propaganda. Everybody’s got to thinking that it automatically means lies, but it doesn’t at all. It just means, like, the arguments you use to convince people that what you stand for is right and it might be lies or it might not. And, Daddy says, take the word socialism. So many people have the wrong idea of what it means that the socialists ought to scrap the word and start using something else to mean what they stand for.”  Larry said gently, “Your father is a socialist?”  “Oh, no.”  He nodded in understanding. “Oh, a Communist, eh?”  Susan Self was indignant. “Daddy thinks the Communists are strictly awful, really weird.”  Steve Hackett came back into the office. He said to Larry, “I sent a couple of the boys out to pick him up.”  Susan was on her feet, a hand to mouth. “You mean my father! You’re going to arrest him!”  Larry said soothingly, “Sit down, Zusanette. There’s a lot of things about this that I’m sure your father can explain.” He said to Steve, “She tells me that the money belonged to a movement. A revolutionary movement which doesn’t use the term revolutionary because people react unfavorably to that word. It’s not Commie.”  Susan said indignantly, “It’s American, not anything foreign!”  Steve growled, “Let’s get back to the money. What’s this movement doing with a lot of counterfeit bills and where did you find them?”  She evidently figured she’d gone too far now to take a stand. “It’s not Daddy’s fault,” she said. “He took me to headquarters twice.”  “Where’s headquarters?” Larry said trying to keep his voice soothing.  “Well ... I don’t know. Daddy was awfully silly about it. He tied his handkerchief around my eyes near the end. But the others complained about me anyway, and Daddy got awfully mad and said something about the young people of the country participating in their emancipation and all, but the others got mad too, and said there wasn’t any kind of help I could do around headquarters anyway, and I’d be better off in school. Everybody got awfully mad, but after the second time Daddy promised not to take me to headquarters any more.”  “But where did you find the money, Zusannette?” Larry said.  “At headquarters. There’s tons and tons of it there.”  Larry cleared his throat and said, “When you say tons and tons, you mean a great deal of it, eh?”  She was proudly definite. “I mean tons and tons. A ton is two thousand pounds.”  “Look, Zusanette,” Larry said reasonably. “I don’t know how much money weighs, exactly, but let’s say a pound would be, say, a thousand bills.” He took up a pencil and scribbled on a pad before him. “A pound of fifties would be $50,000. Then if you multiply that by 2,000 pounds to make a ton, you’d have $100,000,000. And you say there’s tons and tons?”  “And that’s just the fifties,” Susan said triumphantly. “So you can see the two little packages I picked up aren’t really important at all. It’s just like I found them.”  “I don’t think there’s quite a thousand bills in a pound,” Steve said weakly.  Larry said, “How much other money is there?”  “Oh, piles. Whole rooms. Rooms after rooms. And hundred dollar bills, and twenties, and fives, and tens—”  Larry said, “Look, Zusanette, I don’t think you’re in any position to be telling us whoppers. This whole story doesn’t make much sense, does it?”  Her mouth tightened. “I’m not going to say anything more until Daddy gets here, anyway,” she said.  Which was when the phone rang.  “I have an idea that’s for me,” Steve said.  The screen lit up and LaVerne Polk said, “Call for Steve Hackett, Larry.”  Larry pushed the phone around so Steve could look into it. LaVerne flicked off and was replaced by a stranger in uniform. Steve said, “Yeah?”  The cop said, “He’s flown the coop, sir. Must have got out just minutes before we arrived. Couldn’t have taken more than a suitcase. Few papers scattered around the room he used for an office.”  Susan gasped, “You mean Daddy?”  Steve Hackett rubbed a hand over his flattened nose. “Holy Smokes,” he said. He thanked the cop and flicked off.  Larry said, “Look Zusanette, everything’s going to be all right. Nothing will happen to you. You say you managed to pick up two packets of all this money they have at headquarters. O.K. So you thought it wouldn’t be missed and you’ve always wanted to spend money the way you see the stars do on TriD and in the movies.”  She looked at him, taken back. “How did you know?”  Larry said dryly, “I’ve always wanted to myself. But I would like to know one more thing. The Movement. What was it going to do with all this money?”  That evidently puzzled her. “The Professor said they were going to spend it on chorus girls. I guess ... I guess he was joking or something. But Daddy and I’d just been up to New York and we saw those famous precision dancers at the New Roxy Theatre and all and then when we got back the Professor and Daddy were talking and I heard him say it.”  Steve said, carefully, “Professor who?”  Susan said, “Just the Professor. That’s all we ever call him.” Her chin went to trembling still again.                    -------------------------------------  Larry summed it up for the Boss later.  His chief scoffed his disbelief. “The child is full of dreams, Lawrence. It comes from seeing an over-abundance of these TriD shows. I have a girl the same age. I don’t know what is happening to the country. They have no sense of reality.”  Larry Woolford said mildly, “Well, she might be full of nonsense, but she did have the fifties, and she’s our only connection with whoever printed them whether it’s a movement to overthrow the government, or what.”  The Boss said tolerantly, “Movement, indeed. Obviously, her father produced them and she purloined a quantity before he was ready to attempt to pass them. Have you a run down on him yet?”  “Susan Self says her father, Ernest Self, is an inventor. Steve Hackett is working on locating him.”  “He’s an inventor indeed. Evidently, he has invented a perfect counterfeiting device. However, that is the Secret Service’s headache, not ours. Do you wish to resume that vacation of yours, Lawrence?”  His operative twisted his face in a grimace. “Sure, I do, but I’m not happy about this, sir. What happens if there really is an organization, a Movement, like she said?  That brings it back under our jurisdiction, anti-subversion.”  The other shook his head tolerantly. “See here, Lawrence, when you begin scheming a social revolution you can’t plan on an organization composed of a small number of persons who keep their existence secret. In spite of what a good many persons seem to believe, revolutions are not accomplished by handfuls of conspirators hiding in cellars and eventually overthrowing society by dramatically shooting the President, or King, or Czar, or whoever. Revolutions are precipitated by masses of people. People who have ample cause to be against whatever the current government happens to be. Usually, they are on the point of actual starvation. Have you ever read Machiavelli?”  Niccolo Machiavelli was currently _the thing_ to read. Larry said with a certain dignity, “I’ve gone through ‘The Prince,’ the ‘Discourses’ and currently I’m amusing myself with his ‘History of Florence.’ ”  “Anybody who can amuse himself reading Machiavelli,” the Boss said dryly, “has a macabre sense of humor. At any rate, what I was alluding to was where he stated that the Prince cannot rule indefinitely in the face of the active opposition of his people. Therefore, the people always get a government that lies within the limits of their tolerance. It may be on one edge or the other of their limits of tolerance—but it’s always within their tolerance zone.”  Larry frowned and said, “Well, what’s your point, sir?”  The Boss said patiently, “I’m just observing that cultures aren’t overthrown by little handfuls of secret conspirators. You might eliminate a few individuals in that manner, in other words change the personnel of the government, but you aren’t going to alter a socio-economic system. That can’t be done until your people have been pushed outside their limits of tolerance. Very well then. A revolutionary organization must get out and propagandize. It has got to convince the people that they are being pushed beyond endurance. You have got to get the _masses_ to moving. You have to give speeches, print newspapers, books, pamphlets, you have got to send your organizers out to intensify interest in your program.”  Larry said, “I see what you mean. If this so-called Movement actually existed it couldn’t expect to get anywhere as long as remained secret.”  The Boss nodded. “That is correct. The _leaders_ of a revolutionary movement might be intellectuals, social scientists, scholars—in fact they usually are—take our own American Revolution with Jefferson, Madison, Franklin, Washington. Or the French Revolution with Robespierre, Danton, Marat, Engels and Lenin. All were well educated intellectuals from the middle class. But the revolution itself, once it starts, comes from below, from the mass of people pushed beyond tolerance.”  It came to Lawrence Woolford that his superior had achieved to his prominent office not through any fluke. He knew what he was talking about.  The Boss wound it up. “If there was such an organization as this Movement, then this department would know about it. You don’t keep a revolutionary movement secret. It doesn’t make sense to even try. Even if it is forced underground, it makes as much noise as it can.”  His trouble shooter cleared his throat. “I suppose you’re right, sir.” He added hesitantly. “We could always give Susan Self a few drops of Scop-Serum, sir.”  The Boss scowled disapprovingly. “You know how the Supreme Court ruled on"]]]
