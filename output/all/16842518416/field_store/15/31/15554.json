He, thereupon, decided to pay a visit of two weeks, going in August. The attitude of the North overwhelmed him. At Fulton, Kentucky, while he was on the train a white man was sitting in front of him. He wanted to ask him a question but hesitated fearing that he would be rebuffed. He finally addressed the stranger, who answered him courteously and kindly, calling his attention to other points of interest in the North. At Gary, Indiana, he met a gentleman who said he had been mayor of Gary for seven years. He described the Gary school system and promised him an education for his children. He was assured employment at $4 a day for eight hours' work.[33]  A still more powerful, though insidious factor, was the work of public speakers who hid their intentions behind their unique method of presentation. In a lecture on the question of migration a speaker, who is a widely known character, made these remarks:      So many of my folks are leaving that I thought I'd go up and     see whether or not they had made a mistake. I found thousands     of old friends up there making more money than they'd ever     made in their lives. I said to one woman in Chicago, \"Well,     Sister ----, I see you're here.\" \"Yes, Brother ----, I'm here,     thank the Lord.\" \"Do you find it any colder up here than it     was in Mississippi?\" \"Did I understand you correctly to say     cold? Honey, I mean it's cold. It is _some_ cold.\" \"But you     expect to return, don't you?\" \"Don't play with me, chile. What     am I going to return for? I should say not. Up here you see     when I come out on the street I walk on nice smooth pavements.     Down home I got to walk home through the mud. Up here at     nights it don't matter much about coming home from church.     Down home on my street there ain't a single lamp post. And     say, honey, I got a bath tub!\"[34]  He related the instance of his visit to an automobile plant where he was met at the door by a \"stalwart, handsome, six-footer as black as midnight.\" He asked his companion the name of this \"potentate.\" He was told that this man was an experienced machinist. Every car that passed out of that plant must have his O.K. He added further that his salary was something like $100 a week and that the incident showed the unlimited chance for expansion in the North. When he began to enumerate some of the positions which \"men of the race\" were holding, the audience became enthusiastic beyond control. One man in the audience, who had been to Detroit, could restrain himself no longer and stood up to inform the audience that there were also colored street car conductors and motormen and that he had seen them with his own eyes. The speaker paid no attention to this interruption and the audience appeared not to notice it, but began to exchange reports among themselves. The speaker added that he had found negroes in the North, well dressed and looking like men--for the first time in their lives--men who were simply \"bums\" at home. In excusing the indisposition of some negroes toward work, he said, \"How in the world can you expect a man to work faithfully all day long for fifty cents?\"[35]  Among the important stimuli were the rumors in circulation. When a community is wrought up, it is less difficult to believe remarkable tales. To persons beyond the influence of this excitement it is somewhat difficult to conceive how the rumor that the Germans were on their way through Texas to take the southern States could have been believed. And yet it is reported that this extravagant fiction was taken seriously in some quarters. On the outskirts of Meridian, Mississippi, a band of gypsies was encamped. The rumor gained circulation that the Indians were coming back to retake their land lost years ago. It was further rumored that the United States Government was beginning a scheme to transport all negroes from the South to break up the Black Belt. Passed from mouth to mouth, unrestrainedly these reports became verities.  It was further asserted on the word and honor \"of one in position to know\" that the Chicago packing houses needed and would get fifty thousand negroes before the end of the year. One explanation of the belief that the South was overrun with labor agents was the fact that every strange face came to be recognized as a man from the North looking for laborers. If he denied it, they simply thought he was concealing his identity from the police, and if he said nothing, his silence was regarded as sufficient affirmation. Hundreds of disappointments are to be traced to the rumor that a train would leave on a certain date. Hundreds would come to the station prepared to leave and, when no agent appeared, purchased their own tickets.  The questions of wages and privileges were grossly featured. Some men, on being questioned, supposed that it was possible for every common laborer to receive from $4 to $10 a day, and that $50 a week was not an unusual wage. The strength of this belief has been remarked by several social agencies in the North which attempted to supply the immigrants with work. The actual wages paid, though much in excess of those they had been receiving, were often disappointing. Similarly in the matter of privilege and \"rights\" it was later revealed that unbounded liberty was not to be found in the North. The singular cases of misconduct, against which the more sober minded preached, possibly had their root in the beautiful and one-sided pictures of the North which came to the South.  The _Chicago Defender_, a weekly negro newspaper, with its pronounced radical utterances, its criticism of the South, its policy of retaliation, etc., contributed greatly to the exodus.[36] Its influence can be imagined when, after reading the southern white papers with only occasional references to the negroes which might be called commendable and numerous articles which were for the most part distasteful, negroes could read the things they wanted to hear most, expressed in a manner in which they would not dare express them. It voiced the unexpressed thoughts of many and made accusations for which they themselves would have been severely handled. Freud's theory of the suppressed wish finds a happy illustration in this rage over the _Chicago Defender_. Expressed in terms of figures, the circulation of the paper at the beginning of the movement was something like 50,000. In 1918 it had grown to 125,000. It had a large circulation in Mississippi and the supply was usually bought up on the first day of its arrival. Copies were passed around until worn out. One prominent negro asserted that \"negroes grab the _Defender_ like a hungry mule grabs fodder.\" In Gulfport, Mississippi, a man was regarded \"intelligent\" if he read the _Defender_. It was said that in Laurel, Mississippi, old men who did not know how to read would buy it because it was regarded as precious.  It was this paper that named the exodus \"The Great Northern Drive,\" and set the date May 15th, announced the arrivals and took responsibility for inducing \"the poor brethren\" from the South. It was accused of ruining Hattiesburg, Mississippi, by promoting this rush to the North. The sale of this paper was, therefore, forbidden in several towns in the South. A correspondent said: \"White people are paying more attention to the race in order to keep them in the South, but the _Chicago Defender_ has emblazoned upon their minds 'Bound for the Promised Land.'\"  In answer to the warnings of the South against the rigors of the northern winters, the _Defender_ said:      To die from the bite of frost is far more glorious than at the     hands of a mob. I beg you, my brother, to leave the benighted     land. You are a free man. Show the world that you will not let     false leaders lead you. Your neck has been in the yoke. Will     you continue to keep it there because some \"white folks'     nigger\" wants you to? Leave for all quarters of the globe. Get     out of the South. Your being there in the numbers in which you     are gives the southern politician too strong a hold on your     progress.... So much has been said through the white papers in     the South about the members of the race freezing to death in     the North. They freeze to death down South when they don't     take care of themselves. There is no reason for any human     being staying in the Southland on this bugaboo handed out by     the white press.[37]      If you can freeze to death in the North and be free, why     freeze to death in the South and be a slave, where your     mother, sister and daughter are raped and burned at the stake;     where your father, brother and sons are treated with contempt     and hung to a pole, riddled with bullets at the least mention     that he does not like the way he is treated. Come North     then, all you folks, both good and bad. If you don't behave     yourselves up here, the jails will certainly make you wish you     had. For the hard-working man there is plenty of work--if you     really want it. The _Defender_ says come.[38]   The idea that the South is a bad place, unfit for the habitation of colored folk, was duly emphasized. Conditions most distasteful to negroes were exaggerated and given first prominence. In this the _Defender_ had a clear field, for the local colored newspapers dared not make such unrestrained utterances.[39] In fact, reading the _Chicago Defender_ provided a very good substitute for the knowledge which comes through travel. It had the advantage of bringing the North to them. Without fear of exaggeration it is safe to say its policy was successful in inciting thousands of restless negroes to venture north, where they were assured of its protection and the championship of their cause. There are in Chicago migrants who attribute their presence in the North to its encouraging pictures of relief from conditions at home with which they became more and more dissatisfied,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29501"],["title","Negro Migration during the War (#7)"],["body"," as they read.  The setting of a definite date was another stimulus. The great northern drive was scheduled to begin May 15, 1917. This date, or the week following, singularly corresponds with the date of the heaviest rush to the North, the periods of greatest temporary congestion and the awakening of the North to the presence of their guests. Letters to the _Chicago Defender_ and to the social agencies in the North informed them that they were preparing to come in the great drive. One of many such letters received is presented.      April 24, 1917.      Mr. R.S. Abbott,      Editor, the _Chicago Defender_,      Sir:      I have been reading the _Defender_ for one year or more, and     last February I read about the great northern drive to take     place May 15, on Thursday, and now I can hear so many people     speaking of an excursion to the North on the 15th of May for     $3. My husband is in the North already working, and he wants     us to come up in May, so I want to know if it is true about     the excursion. I am getting ready and, oh, so many others     also, and we want to know is that true so we can be in the     drive. So please answer at once. We are getting ready.      Yours,  This was perhaps the most popular date, but there were others, of which August 15 was one. Usually the dates set were for Wednesday and Saturday nights, following pay days.  Personal appeals in the form of letters have a recognized weight in influencing action. The United States mail was about the most active and efficient labor agent. The manner in which the first negroes left made great opportunities for letter writing. It is to be remembered that the departure of one person was regarded always in the light of an experiment. The understanding existed between a man and his friends that he would honestly inform them of conditions in the North. Letters were passed around and read before large groups. A woman from Hattiesburg is accredited with having sent back a letter which enticed away over 200 persons. A tailor who had settled in a town of white people in the West wrote a letter which was read in a church. It explained the advantages of the free schools open to all, and the privilege to ride and to go where one pleases. The reading of the letter brought forth long and loud applause. A man who had left home, writes back to his friend yet undecided:      Mike, old boy, I was promoted on the first of the month. I was     made first assistant to the head carpenter. When he is out of     place I take everything in charge and was raised to $95 per     month. You know I know my stuff. What's the news generally     around H'burg? I should have been here twenty years ago. I     just begin to feel like a man. It's a great deal of pleasure     in knowing that you have got some privileges. My children are     going to the same school with the whites and I don't have     to humble to no one. I have registered. Will vote the next     election and there isn't any 'yes, sir, and no, sir.' It's all     yes and no, and no, Sam, and Bill.  The man has long since been joined by his friend.  The pastor of a Hattiesburg church received a letter from one of his members with the extravagant assertion that the people whose funerals he had preached were in Chicago (meaning Heaven) because they were good Christians. To give assurance on the question of weather migrants in the North would mention the fact that they were writing with their coats off. A fact which strengthened the belief in the almost incredible wages offered in the North was the money sent back to the families in the South. A man whose wife had preceded him wrote that she was making $3.50 a day in charge of a bluing works in Chicago, and actually sent home $15 every two weeks. Another man wrote that he was in Gary working at his trade making sometimes as much as $7 a day. He sent home $30 every two weeks. Fully one-half, or perhaps even more of those who left, did so at the solicitation of friends through correspondence.[40]  Despite the restraints on loose talk in encouragement of the exodus, there were other means of keeping the subject alive. One method, of course, was the circulation of literature from the North. One of the most novel schemes was that of a negro dentist in a southern town who had printed on the reverse side of his business cards quotations from rather positive assertions by northerners on the migration.[41] The northern press early welcomed the much needed negro laborers to the North and leaders of thought in that section began to upbraid the South for its antagonistic attitude towards the welfare of the negroes, who at last had learned to seek a more congenial home.  A stronger influence than this, though not quite so frequent, was the returned migrant who was a living example of the prosperity of the North. It was a frequent complaint that these men were as effective as labor agents in urging negro laborers to go north. There are reported numerous instances of men who came to visit their families and returned with thirty to forty men. It has been suspected, and with a strong suggestion of truth, that many of these were supplied with funds for the trip by the northern firms which employed them. A woman whose daughter had gone north had been talking of her daughter's success. The reports were so opposite to the record of the girl at home that they were not taken seriously. Soon, however, the daughter came home with apparently unlimited money and beautiful clothes, and carried her mother back with her. This was sufficient. It was remarked afterwards: \"If she can make $2.50 a day as lazy as she was, I know I can make $4.\"[42]  The labor agents were a very important factor in stimulating the movement. The number at work in the South appears to have been greatly exaggerated. Agents were more active in large cities where their presence was not so conspicuous. It was difficult to discover because of the very guarded manner in which they worked. One, for example, would walk briskly down the street through a group of negroes and, without turning his head, would say in a low tone, \"Anybody want to go to Chicago, see me.\" That was sufficient. Many persons were found to remark frequently on the strange silence which negroes _en masse_ managed to maintain concerning the movement of the agents. A white man remarked that it was the first time there had ever happened anything about which he could not get full information from some negro. Agents were reported, at one time or another, in every section from which the migrants went. When the vigilance of the authorities restricted their activities they began working through the mails. Many sections were flooded with letters from the North to persons whose names had been obtained from migrants in the North or through a quiet canvass of the community by unobstructed solicitors.[43]  Poems on the migration were also strong stimuli. In some instances arrests of persons circulating them were made. A bit of poetry which received widespread popularity was one called \"Bound for the Promised Land.\" It was said that this piece of poetry was responsible for much trouble. The _Chicago Defender_ reported on June 1, 1917, that five young men were arraigned before Judge John E. Schwartz of Savannah, Georgia, for reading poetry. The police contended that they were inciting riot in the city and over Georgia. Two of the men were sent for thirty days to Brown Farm, a place not fit for human beings. Tom Amaca was arrested for having \"Bound for the Promised Land,\" a poem which had been recently published in the _Defender_. J.N. Chisholm and A.P. Walker were arrested there because they were said to be the instigators.[44] Another very popular poem widely circulated was entitled \"Farewell! We're Good and Gone.\" It was said that this poem influenced thousands to go. Other poems on the migration were \"Northward Bound,\" \"The Land of Hope\" and \"Negro Migration\" and \"The Reason Why.\"  [Footnote 32: Johnson, _Report on the Migration from Mississippi_.]  [Footnote 33: Ibid.]  [Footnote 34: Johnson, _Report on the Migration from Mississippi_.]  [Footnote 35: Ibid.]  [Footnote 36: Some of the material prepared by the _Defender_ for consumption in the South was as follows:  \"Turn a deaf ear to everybody. You see they are not lifting their laws to help you, are they? Have they stopped their Jim Crow cars? Can you buy a Pullman sleeper where you wish? Will they give you a square deal in court yet? When a girl is sent to prison she becomes the mistress of the guards and others in authority, and women prisoners are put on the streets to work--something they don't do to a white woman. And our leaders will tell you the South is the best place for you. Turn a deaf ear to the scoundrel, and let him stay. Above all, see to it that that jumping-jack preacher is left in the South, for he means you no good here in the North.... Once upon a time we permitted other people to think for us--today we are thinking and acting for ourselves, with the result that our 'friends' are getting alarmed at our progress. We'd like to oblige these unselfish (?) souls and remain slaves in the South; but to other sections of the country we have said, as the song goes, 'I hear you calling me,' and have boarded the train, singing, 'Good-bye, Dixie Land.'\"]  [Footnote 37: The following clippings are taken from these white papers:  \"Aged Negro Frozen to Death--Albany, Ga., February 8.  \"Yesterday the dead body of Peter Crowder, an old negro, was found in an out-of-the-way place where he had been frozen to death during the recent cold snap.\"--_Macon Telegraph_.  \"Dies from Exposure--Spartanburg, S.C., February 6.  \"Marshall Jackson, a negro man, who lived on the farm of J.T.
