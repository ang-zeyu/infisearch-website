Despite my will, it stands confessed, Contentment welleth up no longer in my breast. Yet wherefore must the stream, alas, so soon be dry, That we once more athirst should lie? Full oft this sad experience hath been mine; Nathless the want admits of compensation; For things above the earth we learn to pine, Our spirits yearn for revelation, Which nowhere burns with purer beauty blent,  Than here in the New Testament. To ope the ancient text an impulse strong Impels me, and its sacred lore, With honest purpose to explore, And render into my loved German tongue. (He opens a volume, and applies himself to it.) 'Tis writ, \"In the beginning was the Word!\" I pause, perplex'd! Who now will help afford? I cannot the mere Word so highly prize; I must translate it otherwise, If by the spirit guided as I read. \"In the beginning was the Sense!\" Take heed, The import of this primal sentence weigh, Lest thy too hasty pen be led astray! Is force creative then of Sense the dower? \"In the beginning was the Power!\" Thus should it stand: yet, while the line I trace. A something warns me, once more to efface. The spirit aids! from anxious scruples freed, I write, \"In the beginning was the Deed!\"  Am I with thee my room to share, Poodle, thy barking now forbear, Forbear thy howling! Comrade so noisy, ever growling, I cannot suffer here to dwell. One or the other, mark me well, Forthwith must leave the cell. I'm loath the guest-right to withhold; The door's ajar, the passage clear; But what must now mine eyes behold! Are nature's laws suspended here? Real is it, or a phantom show? In length and breadth how doth my poodle grow! He lifts himself with threat'ning mien, In likeness of a dog no longer seen! What spectre have I harbour'd thus! Huge as a hippopotamus, With fiery eye, terrific tooth! Ah I now I know thee, sure enough! For such a base, half-hellish brood, The key of Solomon is good.  SPIRITS (without) Captur'd there within is one! Stay without and follow none! Like a fox in iron snare, Hell's old lynx is quaking there, But take heed! Hover round, above, below, To and fro, Then from durance is he freed! Can ye aid him, spirits all, Leave him not in mortal thrall! Many a time and oft bath he Served us, when at liberty.  FAUST  The monster to confront, at first, The spell of Four must be rehears'd;  Salamander shall kindle, Writhe nymph of the wave, In air sylph shall dwindle, And Kobold shall slave.  Who doth ignore The primal Four, Nor knows aright Their use and might, O'er spirits will he Ne'er master be!  Vanish in the fiery glow, Salamander! Rushingly together flow. Undine! Shimmer in the meteor's gleam, Sylphide! Hither bring thine homely aid,  Incubus! Incubus! Step forth! I do adjure thee thus! None of the Four Lurks in the beast: He grins at me, untroubled as before; I have not hurt him in the least. A spell of fear Thou now shalt hear. Art thou, comrade fell, Fugitive from hell?  See then this sign, Before which incline The murky troops of Hell! With bristling hair now doth the creature swell.  Canst thou, reprobate, Read the uncreate, Unspeakable, diffused Throughout the heavenly sphere, Shamefully abused, Transpierced with nail and spear!  Behind the stove, tam'd by my spells, Like an elephant he swells; Wholly now he fills the room, He into mist will melt away. Ascend not to the ceiling! Come, Thyself at the master's feet now lay! Thou seest that mine is no idle threat. With holy fire I will scorch thee yet! Wait not the might That lies in the triple-glowing light! Wait not the might Of all my arts in fullest measure!  MEPHISTOPHELES (As the mist sinks, comes forward from behind the stove, in the dress of a travelling scholar)  Why all this uproar? What's the master's pleasure?  FAUST  This then the kernel of the brute! A travelling scholar? Why I needs must smile.  MEPHISTOPHELES  Your learned reverence humbly I salute! You've made me swelter in a pretty style.  FAUST  Thy name?  MEPHISTOPHELES  The question trifling seems from one, Who it appears the Word doth rate so low; Who, undeluded by mere outward show, To Being's depths would penetrate alone.  FAUST  With gentlemen like you indeed The inward essence from the name we read, As all too plainly it doth appear, When Beelzebub, Destroyer, Liar, meets the ear. Who then art thou?  MEPHISTOPHELES  Part of that power which still Produceth good, whilst ever scheming ill.  FAUST  What hidden mystery in this riddle lies?  MEPHISTOPHELES  The spirit I, which evermore denies! And justly; for whate'er to light is brought Deserves again to be reduced to naught; Then better 'twere that naught should be. Thus all the elements which ye Destruction, Sin, or briefly, Evil, name, As my peculiar element I claim.  FAUST  Thou nam'st thyself a part, and yet a whole I see.  MEPHISTOPHELES  The modest truth I speak to thee. Though folly's microcosm, man, it seems, Himself to be a perfect whole esteems: Part of the part am I, which at the first was all, A part of darkness, which gave birth to light, Proud light, who now his mother would enthrall, Contesting space and ancient rank with night. Yet he succeedeth not, for struggle as he will, To forms material he adhereth still; From them he streameth, them he maketh fair, And still the progress of his beams they check; And so, I trust, when comes the final wreck, Light will, ere long, the doom of matter share.  FAUST  Thy worthy avocation now I guess! Wholesale annihilation won't prevail, So thou'rt beginning on a smaller scale.  MEPHISTOPHELES  And, to say truth, as yet with small success. Oppos'd to naught, this clumsy world, The something--it subsisteth still; Not yet is it to ruin hurl'd, Despite the efforts of my will. Tempests and earthquakes, fire and flood, I've tried; Yet land and ocean still unchang'd abide! And then of humankind and beasts, brood,-- Neither o'er them can I extend my sway. What countless myriads have I swept away! Yet ever circulates the fresh young blood. the accursed  It is enough to drive me to despair! As in the earth, in water, and in air, A thousand germs burst forth spontaneously; In moisture, drought, heat, cold, they still appear! Had I not flame selected as my sphere Nothing apart had been reserved for me.  FAUST  So thou with thy cold devil's fist Still clench'd in malice impotent Dost the creative power resist, The active, the beneficent! Henceforth some other task essay, Of Chaos thou the wondrous son!  MEPHISTOPHELES  We will consider what you say, And talk about it more anon! For this time have I leave to go?  FAUST  Why thou shouldst ask, I cannot see. Since thee I now have learned to know, At thy good pleasure, visit me. Here is the window, here the door, The chimney, too, may serve thy need.  MEPHISTOPHELES  I must confess, my stepping o'er Thy threshold a slight hindrance doth impede; The wizard-foot doth me retain.  FAUST  The pentagram thy peace doth mar? To me, thou son of hell, explain, How earnest thou in, if this thine exit bar? Could such a spirit aught ensnare?  MEPHISTOPHELES  Observe it well, it is not drawn with care, One of the angles, that which points without, Is, as thou seest, not quite closed.  FAUST  Chance hath the matter happily dispos'd! So thou my captive art? No doubt! By accident thou thus art caught!  MEPHISTOPHELES  In sprang the dog, indeed, observing naught; Things now assume another shape, The devil's in the house and can't escape.  FAUST  Why through the window not withdraw?  MEPHISTOPHELES  For ghosts and f or the devil 'tis a law. Where they stole in, there they must forth. We're free The first to choose; as to the second, slaves are we.  FAUST  E'en hell hath its peculiar laws, I see! I'm glad of that! a pact may then be made, The which you gentlemen will surely keep?  MEPHISTOPHELES  What e'er therein is promised thou shalt reap, No tittle shall remain unpaid. But such arrangements time require; We'll speak of them when next we meet; Most earnestly I now entreat, This once permission to retire.  FAUST  Another moment prithee here remain, Me with some happy word to pleasure.  MEPHISTOPHELES  Now let me go! ere long I'll come again, Then thou may'st question at thy leisure.  FAUST  'Twas not toy purpose thee to lime; The snare hast entered of thine own free will: Let him who holds the devil, hold him still! So soon he'll catch him not a second time.  MEPHISTOPHELES  If it so please thee, I'm at thy command; Only on this condition, understand; That worthily thy leisure to beguile, I here may exercise my arts awhile.  FAUST  Thou'rt free to do so! Gladly I'll attend; But be thine art a pleasant one!  MEPHISTOPHELES My friend, This hour enjoyment more intense, Shall captivate each ravish'd sense, Than thou could'st compass in the bound Of the whole year's unvarying round; And what the dainty spirits sing, The lovely images they bring, Are no fantastic sorcery. Rich odours shall regale your smell, On choicest sweets your palate dwell, Your feelings thrill with ecstasy.  No preparation do we need, Here we together are. Proceed.  SPIRITS  Hence overshadowing gloom, Vanish from sight! O'er us thine azure dome, Bend, beauteous light! Dark clouds that o'er us spread, Melt in thin air! Stars, your soft radiance shed, Tender and fair. Girt with celestial might, Winging their airy flight, Spirits are thronging. Follows their forms of light Infinite longing! Flutter their vestures bright O'er field and grove! Where in their leafy bower Lovers the livelong hour Vow deathless love. Soft bloometh bud and bower! Bloometh the grove! Grapes from the spreading vine Crown the full measure; Fountains of foaming wine Gush from the pressure. Still where the currents wind, Gems brightly gleam. Leaving the hills behind On rolls the stream; Now into ample seas, Spreadeth the flood; Laying the sunny leas, Mantled with wood.

Hark to the choral strain, Joyfully ringing! While on the grassy plain Dancers are springing; Climbing the steep hill's side, Skimming the glassy tide, Wander they there; Others on pinions wide Wing the blue air; All lifeward tending, upward still wending, Towards yonder stars that gleam, Far, far above; Stars from whose tender beam Rains blissful love.  MEPHISTOPHELES  Well done, my dainty spirits! now he slumbers! Ye have entranc'd him fairly with your numbers! This minstrelsy of yours I must repay,-- Thou art not yet the man to hold the devil fast!-- With fairest shapes your spells around him cast, And plunge him in a sea of dreams! But that this charm be rent, the threshold passed, Tooth of rat the way must clear. I need not conjure long it seems, One rustles hitherward, and soon my voice will hear. The master of the rats and mice, Of flies and frogs, of bugs and lice, Commands thy presence; without fear Come forth and gnaw the threshold here, Where he with oil has smear'd it.--Thou Com'st hopping forth already! Now To work! The point that holds me bound Is in the outer angle found. Another bite--so--now 'tis done-- Now, Faustus, till we meet again, dream on.  FAUST (awaking) Am I once more deluded! must I deem That thus the throng of spirits disappear? The devil's presence, was it but a dream? Hath but a poodle scap'd and left me here?  STUDY FAUST. MEPHISTOPHELES  FAUST  A knock? Come in! Who now would break my rest?  MEPHISTOPHELES  'Tis I!  FAUST  Come in!  MEPHISTOPHELES  Thrice be the words express'd.  FAUST  Then I repeat, Come in!  MEPHISTOPHELES  'Tis well, I hope that we shall soon agree! For now your fancies to expel, Here, as a youth of high degree, I come in gold-lac'd scarlet vest, And stiff-silk mantle richly dress'd, A cock's gay feather for a plume, A long and pointed rapier, too; And briefly I would counsel you To don at once the same costume, And, free from trammels, speed away, That what life is you may essay.  FAUST  In every garb I needs must feel oppress'd, My heart to earth's low cares a prey. Too old the trifler's part to play, Too young to live by no desire possess'd. What can the world to me afford? Renounce! renounce! is still the word; This is the everlasting song In every ear that ceaseless rings, And which, alas, our whole life long, Hoarsely each passing moment sings. But to new horror I awake each morn, And I could weep hot tears, to see the sun Dawn on another day, whose round forlorn Accomplishes no wish of mine--not one. Which still, with froward captiousness, impains E'en the presentiment of every joy, While low realities and paltry cares The spirit's fond imaginings destroy. Then must I too, when falls the veil of night, Stretch'd on my pallet languish in despair, Appalling dreams my soul affright; No rest vouchsafed me even there. The god, who throned within my breast resides, Deep in my soul can stir the springs; With sovereign sway my energies he guides, He cannot move external things; And so existence is to me a weight. Death fondly I desire, and life I hate.  MEPHISTOPHELES  And yet, methinks, by most 'twill be confess'd That Death is never quite a welcome guest.  FAUST  Happy the man around whose brow he binds The bloodstain'd wreath in conquest's dazzling hour; Or whom, excited by the dance, he finds Dissolv'd in bliss, in love's delicious bower! O that before the lofty spirit's might, Enraptured, I had rendered up my soul!  MEPHISTOPHELES  Yet did a certain man refrain one night, Of its brown juice to drain the crystal bowl.  FAUST  To play the spy diverts you then?  MEPHISTOPHELES  I own, Though not omniscient, much to me is known.  FAUST  If o'er my soul the tone familiar, stealing, Drew me from harrowing thought's bewild'ring maze, Touching the ling'ring chords of childlike feeling, With sweet harmonies of happier days: So curse I all, around the soul that windeth Its magic and alluring spell, And with delusive flattery bindeth Its victim to this dreary cell! Curs'd before all things be the high opinion, Wherewith the spirit girds itself around! Of shows delusive curs'd be the dominion, Within whose mocking sphere our sense is bound! Accurs'd of dreams the treacherous wiles, The cheat of glory, deathless fame! Accurs'd what each as property beguiles, Wife, child, slave, plough, whate'er its name! Accurs'd be mammon, when with treasure He doth to daring deeds incite: Or when to steep the soul in pleasure, He spreads the couch of soft delight! Curs'd be the grape's balsamic juice! Accurs'd love's dream, of joys the first! Accurs'd be hope! accurs'd be faith! And more than all, be patience curs'd!  CHORUS OP SPIRITS (invisible)  Woe! woe! Thou hast destroy'd The beautiful world With violent blow; 'Tis shiver'd! 'tis shatter'd! The fragments abroad by a demigod scatter'd! Now we sweep The wrecks into nothingness! Fondly we weep The beauty that's gone! Thou, 'mongst the Sons of earth, Lofty and mighty one, Build it once more! In thine own bosom the lost world restore! Now with unclouded sense Enter a new career; Songs shall salute thine ear, Ne'er heard before!  MEPHISTOPHELES  My little ones these spirits be. Hark! with shrewd intelligence, How they recommend to thee Action, and the joys of sense! In the busy world to dwell, Fain they would allure thee hence: For within this lonely cell, Stagnate sap of life and sense.  Forbear to trifle longer with thy grief, Which, vulture-like, consumes thee in this den. The worst society is some relief, Making thee feel thyself a man with men. Nathless, it is not meant, I trow, To thrust thee 'mid the vulgar throng.  I to the upper ranks do not belong; Yet if, by me companion'd, thou Thy steps through life forthwith wilt take; Upon the spot myself I'll make Thy comrade;-- Should it suit thy need, I am thy servant, am thy slave indeed!  FAUST  And how must I thy services repay?  MEPHISTOPHELES  Thereto thou lengthen'd respite hast!  FAUST  No! No! The devil is an egoist I know: And, for Heaven's sake, 'tis not his way Kindness to any one to show. Let the condition plainly be exprest! Such a domestic is a dangerous guest.  MEPHISTOPHELES  I'll pledge myself to be thy servant here, Still at thy back alert and prompt to be; But when together yonder we appear, Then shalt thou do the same for me.  FAUST  But small concern I feel for yonder world; Hast thou this system into ruin hurl'd, Another may arise the void to fill. This earth the fountain whence my pleasures flow, This sun doth daily shine upon my woe, And if this world I must forego, Let happen then,--what can and will. I to this theme will close mine ears, If men hereafter hate and love,  FAUST  And if there be in yonder spheres A depth below or height above.  MEPHISTOPHELES  In this mood thou mayst venture it. But make The compact! I at once will undertake To charm thee with mine arts. I'll give thee more Than mortal eye hath e'er beheld before.  FAUST  What, sorry Devil, hast thou to bestow? Was ever mortal spirit, in its high endeavour, Fathom'd by Being such as thou? Yet food thou hast which satisfieth never, Hast ruddy gold, that still doth flow Like restless quicksilver away, A game thou hast, at which none win who play, A girl who would, with amorous eyen, E'en from my breast, a neighbour snare, Lofty ambition's joy divine, That, meteor-like, dissolves in air. Show me the fruit that, ere 'tis pluck'd, doth rot, And trees, whose verdure daily buds anew!  MEPHISTOPHELES  Such a commission scares me not, I can provide such treasures, it is true; But, my good friend, a season will come round, When on what's good we may regale in peace.  FAUST  If e'er upon my couch, stretched at my ease, I'm found, Then may my life that instant cease! Me canst thou cheat with glozing wile Till self-reproach away I cast,-- Me with joy's lure canst thou beguile Let that day be for me the last! Be this our wager!  MEPHISTOPHELES  Settled!  FAUST  Sure and fast! When to the moment I shall say, \"Linger awhile! so fair thou art!\" Then mayst thou fetter me straightway, Then to the abyss will I depart! Then may the solemn death-bell sound, Then from thy service thou art free, The index then may cease its round, And time be never more for me!  MEPHISTOPHELES  I shall remember: pause, ere 'tis too late.  FAUST  Thereto a perfect right hast thou. My strength I do not rashly overrate. Slave am I here, at any rate, If thine, or whose, it matters not, I trow.  MEPHISTOPHELES  At thine inaugural feast I will this day Attend, my duties to commence.-- But one thing!--Accidents may happen, hence A line or two in writing grant, I pray.  FAUST  A writing, Pedant! dost demand from me? Man, and man's plighted word, are these unknown to thee? Is't not enough, that by the word I gave, My doom for evermore is cast? Doth not the world in all its currents rave, And must a promise hold me fast? Yet fixed is this delusion in our heart; Who, of his own free will, therefrom would part? How blest within whose breast truth reigneth pure! No sacrifice will he repent when made! A formal deed, with seal and signature, A spectre this from which all shrink afraid. The word its life resigneth in the pen, Leather and wax usurp the mastery then. Spirits of evil! what dost thou require? Brass, marble, parchment, paper, dost desire? Shall I with chisel, pen, or graver write? Thy choice is free; to me 'tis all the same.  MEPHISTOPHELES  Wherefore thy passion so excite And thus thine eloquence inflame? A scrap is for our compact good. Thou under-signest merely with a drop of blood.  FAUST  If this will satisfy thy mind, Thy whim I'll gratify, howe'er absurd.  MEPHISTOPHELES  Blood is a juice of very special kind.  FAUST  Be not afraid that I shall break my word! The scope of all my energy Is in exact accordance with my vow. Vainly I have aspired too high; I'm on a level but with such as thou; Me the great spirit scorn'd, defied; Nature "]]]
