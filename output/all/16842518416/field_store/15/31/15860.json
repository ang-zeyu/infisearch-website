When he reached the fence, he followed it south till he came to the open gate, where he took to the road as confidently as if he knew for a certainty that it would lead him straight to his mate. How eagerly he paddled along, glancing right and left, and increasing his speed at every step! I kept about fifty yards behind him. Presently he met a dog; he paused and eyed the animal for a moment, and then turned to the right along a road which diverged just at that point, and which led to the railroad station. I followed, thinking the drake would soon lose his bearings, and get hopelessly confused in the tangle of roads that converged at the station.  But he seemed to have an exact map of the country in his mind; he soon left the station road, went around a house, through a vineyard, till he struck a stone fence that crossed his course at right angles; this he followed eastward till it was joined by a barbed wire fence, under which he passed and again entered the highway he had first taken. Then down the road he paddled with renewed confidence: under the trees, down a hill, through a grove, over a bridge, up the hill again toward home.  Presently he found his clue cut in two by the railroad track; this was something he had never before seen; he paused, glanced up it, then down it, then at the highway across it, and quickly concluded this last was his course. On he went again, faster and faster.  He had now gone half the distance, and was getting tired. A little pool of water by the roadside caught his eye. Into it he plunged, bathed, drank, preened his plumage for a few moments, and then started homeward again. He knew his home was on the upper side of the road, for he kept his eye bent in that direction, scanning the fields. Twice he stopped, stretched himself up, and scanned the landscape intently; then on again. It seemed as if an invisible cord was attached to him, and he was being pulled down the road.  Just opposite a farm lane which led up to a group of farm buildings, and which did indeed look like his home lane, he paused and seemed to be debating with himself. Two women just then came along; they lifted and flirted their skirts, for it was raining, and this disturbed him again and decided him to take to the farm lane. Up the lane he went, rather doubtingly, I thought.  In a few moments it brought him into a barn-yard, where a group of hens caught his eye. Evidently he was on good terms with hens at home, for he made up to these eagerly as if to tell them his troubles; but the hens knew not ducks; they withdrew suspiciously, then assumed a threatening attitude, till one old \"dominic\" put up her feathers and charged upon him viciously.  Again he tried to make up to them, quacking softly, and again he was repulsed. Then the cattle in the yard spied this strange creature and came sniffing toward it, full of curiosity.  The drake quickly concluded he had got into the wrong place, and turned his face southward again. Through the fence he went into a plowed field. Presently another stone fence crossed his path; along this he again turned toward the highway. In a few minutes he found himself in a corner formed by the meeting of two stone fences. Then he turned appealingly to me, uttering the soft note of the mallard. To use his wings never seemed to cross his mind.  Well, I am bound to confess that I helped the drake over the wall, but I sat him down in the road as impartially as I could. How well his pink feet knew the course! How they flew up the road! His green head and white throat fairly twinkled under the long avenue of oaks and chestnuts.  At last we came in sight of the home lane, which led up to the farmhouse one hundred or more yards from the road. I was curious to see if he would recognize the place. At the gate leading into the lane he paused. He had just gone up a lane that looked like that and had been disappointed. What should he do now? Truth compels me to say that he overshot the mark: he kept on hesitatingly along the highway.  It was now nearly night. I felt sure the duck would soon discover his mistake, but I had not time to watch the experiment further. I went around the drake and turned him back. As he neared the lane this time he seemed suddenly to see some familiar landmark, and he rushed up it at the top of his speed. His joy and eagerness were almost pathetic.  I followed close. Into the house yard he rushed with uplifted wings, and fell down almost exhausted by the side of his mate. A half hour later the two were nipping the grass together in the pasture, and he, I have no doubt, was eagerly telling her the story of his adventures.                                        V                          FACTORS IN ANIMAL LIFE   The question that the Californian schoolchildren put to me, \"Have the birds got sense?\" still \"sticks in my crop.\"  Such extraordinary sense has been attributed to most of the wild creatures by several of our latter day nature-writers, that I have been moved to examine the whole question more thoroughly than ever before, and to find out, as far as I can, just how much and what kind of sense the birds and four-footed beasts have.  In this and in some following chapters I shall make an effort to use my own sense to the best advantage in probing that of the animals, which has, as I think, been so vastly overrated.  When sentiment gets overripe, it becomes sentimentalism. The sentiment for nature which has been so assiduously cultivated in our times is fast undergoing this change, and is softening into sentimentalism toward the lower animals. Many a wholesome feeling can be pushed so far that it becomes a weakness and a sign of disease. Pity for the sufferings of our brute neighbors may be a manly feeling; and then again it may be so fostered and cosseted that it becomes maudlin and unworthy. When hospitals are founded for sick or homeless cats and dogs, when all forms of vivisection are cried down, when the animals are humanized and books are written to show that the wild creatures have schools and kindergartens, and that their young are instructed and disciplined in quite the human way by their fond parents; when we want to believe that reason and not instinct guides them, that they are quite up in some of the simpler arts of surgery, mending or amputating their own broken limbs and salving their wounds,--when, I say, our attitude toward the natural life about us and our feeling for it have reached the stage implied by these things, then has sentiment degenerated into sentimentalism, and our appreciation of nature lost its firm edge.  No doubt there is a considerable number of people in any community that are greatly taken with this improved anthropomorphic view of wild nature now current among us. Such a view tickles the fancy and touches the emotions. It makes the wild creatures so much more interesting. Shall we deny anything to a bird or beast that makes it more interesting, and more worthy of our study and admiration?  This sentimental view of animal life has its good side and its bad side. Its good side is its result in making us more considerate and merciful toward our brute neighbors; its bad side is seen in the degree to which it leads to a false interpretation of their lives. The tendency to which I refer is no doubt partly the result of our growing humanitarianism and feeling of kinship with all the lower orders of creation, and partly due to the fact that we live in a time of impromptu nature study, when birds and plants and trees are fast becoming a fad with half the population, and when the \"yellow\" reporter is abroad in the fields and woods. Never before in my time have so many exaggerations and misconceptions of the wild life about us been current in the popular mind. It is becoming the fashion to ascribe to the lower animals nearly all our human motives and attributes, and often to credit them with plans and devices that imply reason and a fair amount of mechanical knowledge. An illustration of this is the account of the nest of a pair of orioles, as described in the \"North American Review\" for May, 1903, by a writer of popular nature books. These orioles built a nest so extraordinary that it can be accounted for only on the theory that there _is_ a school of the woods, and that these two birds had been pupils there and had taken an advanced course in Strings. Among other things impossible for birds to do, these orioles tied a knot in the end of a string to prevent its fraying in the wind! If the whole idea were not too preposterous for even a half-witted child to believe, one might ask, What in the name of anything and everything but the \"Modern School of Nature Study\" do orioles know about strings fraying in the wind and the use of knots to prevent it? They have never had occasion to know; they have had no experience with strings that hang loose and unravel in the wind. They often use strings, to be sure, in building their nests, but they use them in a sort of haphazard way, weaving them awkwardly into the structure, and leaving no loose ends that would suffer by fraying in the wind. Sometimes they use strings in attaching the nest to the limb, but they never knot or tie them; they simply wind them round and round as a child might. It is possible that a bird might be taught to tie a knot with its foot and beak, though I should have to see it done to be convinced. But the orioles in question not only tied knots; they tied them with a \"reversed double hitch, the kind that a man uses in cinching his saddle\"! More wonderful still, not finding in a New England elm-embowered town a suitable branch from which to suspend their nest, the birds went down upon the ground and tied three twigs together in the form of \"a perfectly measured triangle\" (no doubt working from a plan drawn to a scale). They attached to the three sides of this framework four strings of equal length (eight or ten inches), all carefully doubled,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30255"],["title","The Skull (#0)"],["body","agreed to kill a stranger he had  never seen. But he would make no mistakes  because he had the stranger's skull under  his arm._           THE        SKULL   By Philip K. Dick   \"What is this opportunity?\" Conger asked. \"Go on. I'm interested.\"  The room was silent; all faces were fixed on Conger--still in the drab prison uniform. The Speaker leaned forward slowly.  \"Before you went to prison your trading business was paying well--all illegal--all very profitable. Now you have nothing, except the prospect of another six years in a cell.\"  Conger scowled.  \"There is a certain situation, very important to this Council, that requires your peculiar abilities. Also, it is a situation you might find interesting. You were a hunter, were you not? You've done a great deal of trapping, hiding in the bushes, waiting at night for the game? I imagine hunting must be a source of satisfaction to you, the chase, the stalking--\"  Conger sighed. His lips twisted. \"All right,\" he said. \"Leave that out. Get to the point. Who do you want me to kill?\"  The Speaker smiled. \"All in proper sequence,\" he said softly.         *       *       *       *       *  The car slid to a stop. It was night; there was no light anywhere along the street. Conger looked out. \"Where are we? What is this place?\"  The hand of the guard pressed into his arm. \"Come. Through that door.\"  Conger stepped down, onto the damp sidewalk. The guard came swiftly after him, and then the Speaker. Conger took a deep breath of the cold air. He studied the dim outline of the building rising up before them.  \"I know this place. I've seen it before.\" He squinted, his eyes growing accustomed to the dark. Suddenly he became alert. \"This is--\"  \"Yes. The First Church.\" The Speaker walked toward the steps. \"We're expected.\"  \"Expected? _Here?_\"  \"Yes.\" The Speaker mounted the stairs. \"You know we're not allowed in their Churches, especially with guns!\" He stopped. Two armed soldiers loomed up ahead, one on each side.  \"All right?\" The Speaker looked up at them. They nodded. The door of the Church was open. Conger could see other soldiers inside, standing about, young soldiers with large eyes, gazing at the ikons and holy images.  \"I see,\" he said.  \"It was necessary,\" the Speaker said. \"As you know, we have been singularly unfortunate in the past in our relations with the First Church.\"  \"This won't help.\"  \"But it's worth it. You will see.\"         *       *       *       *       *  They passed through the hall and into the main chamber where the altar piece was, and the kneeling places. The Speaker scarcely glanced at the altar as they passed by. He pushed open a small side door and beckoned Conger through.  \"In here. We have to hurry. The faithful will be flocking in soon.\"  Conger entered, blinking. They were in a small chamber, low-ceilinged, with dark panels of old wood. There was a smell of ashes and smoldering spices in the room. He sniffed. \"What's that? The smell.\"  \"Cups on the wall. I don't know.\" The Speaker crossed impatiently to the far side. \"According to our information, it is hidden here by this--\"  Conger looked around the room. He saw books and papers, holy signs and images. A strange low shiver went through him.  \"Does my job involve anyone of the Church? If it does--\"  The Speaker turned, astonished. \"Can it be that you believe in the Founder? Is it possible, a hunter, a killer--\"  \"No. Of course not. All their business about resignation to death, non-violence--\"  \"What is it, then?\"  Conger shrugged. \"I've been taught not to mix with such as these. They have strange abilities. And you can't reason with them.\"  The Speaker studied Conger thoughtfully. \"You have the wrong idea. It is no one here that we have in mind. We've found that killing them only tends to increase their numbers.\"  \"Then why come here? Let's leave.\"  \"No. We came for something important. Something you will need to identify your man. Without it you won't be able to find him.\" A trace of a smile crossed the Speaker's face. \"We don't want you to kill the wrong person. It's too important.\"  \"I don't make mistakes.\" Conger's chest rose. \"Listen, Speaker--\"  \"This is an unusual situation,\" the Speaker said. \"You see, the person you are after--the person that we are sending you to find--is known only by certain objects here. They are the only traces, the only means of identification. Without them--\"  \"What are they?\"  He came toward the Speaker. The Speaker moved to one side. \"Look,\" he said. He drew a sliding wall away, showing a dark square hole. \"In there.\"  Conger squatted down, staring in. He frowned. \"A skull! A skeleton!\"  \"The man you are after has been dead for two centuries,\" the Speaker said. \"This is all that remains of him. And this is all you have with which to find him.\"  For a long time Conger said nothing. He stared down at the bones, dimly visible in the recess of the wall. How could a man dead centuries be killed? How could he be stalked, brought down?  Conger was a hunter, a man who had lived as he pleased, where he pleased. He had kept himself alive by trading, bringing furs and pelts in from the Provinces on his own ship, riding at high speed, slipping through the customs line around Earth.  He had hunted in the great mountains of the moon. He had stalked through empty Martian cities. He had explored--  The Speaker said, \"Soldier, take these objects and have them carried to the car. Don't lose any part of them.\"  The soldier went into the cupboard, reaching gingerly, squatting on his heels.  \"It is my hope,\" the Speaker continued softly, to Conger, \"that you will demonstrate your loyalty to us, now. There are always ways for citizens to restore themselves, to show their devotion to their society. For you I think this would be a very good chance. I seriously doubt that a better one will come. And for your efforts there will be quite a restitution, of course.\"  The two men looked at each other; Conger, thin, unkempt, the Speaker immaculate in his uniform.  \"I understand you,\" Conger said. \"I mean, I understand this part, about the chance. But how can a man who has been dead two centuries be--\"  \"I'll explain later,\" the Speaker said. \"Right now we have to hurry!\" The soldier had gone out with the bones, wrapped in a blanket held carefully in his arms. The Speaker walked to the door. \"Come. They've already discovered that we've broken in here, and they'll be coming at any moment.\"  They hurried down the damp steps to the waiting car. A second later the driver lifted the car up into the air, above the house-tops.         *       *       *       *       *  The Speaker settled back in the seat.  \"The First Church has an interesting past,\" he said. \"I suppose you are familiar with it, but I'd like to speak of a few points that are of relevancy to us.  \"It was in the twentieth century that the Movement began--during one of the periodic wars. The Movement developed rapidly, feeding on the general sense of futility, the realization that each war was breeding greater war, with no end in sight. The Movement posed a simple answer to the problem: Without military preparations--weapons--there could be no war. And without machinery and complex scientific technocracy there could be no weapons.  \"The Movement preached that you couldn't stop war by planning for it. They preached that man was losing to his machinery and science, that it was getting away from him, pushing him into greater and greater wars. Down with society, they shouted. Down with factories and science! A few more wars and there wouldn't be much left of the world.  \"The Founder was an obscure person from a small town in the American Middle West. We don't even know his name. All we know is that one day he appeared, preaching a doctrine of non-violence, non-resistance; no fighting, no paying taxes for guns, no research except for medicine. Live out your life quietly, tending your garden, staying out of public affairs; mind your own business. Be obscure, unknown, poor. Give away most of your possessions, leave the city. At least that was what developed from what he told the people.\"  The car dropped down and landed on a roof.  \"The Founder preached this doctrine, or the germ of it; there's no telling how much the faithful have added themselves. The local authorities picked him up at once, of course. Apparently they were convinced that he meant it; he was never released. He was put to death, and his body buried secretly. It seemed that the cult was finished.\"  The Speaker smiled. \"Unfortunately, some of his disciples reported seeing him after the date of his death. The rumor spread; he had conquered death, he was divine. It took hold, grew. And here we are today, with a First Church, obstructing all social progress, destroying society, sowing the seeds of anarchy--\"  \"But the wars,\" Conger said. \"About them?\"  \"The wars? Well, there were no more wars. It must be acknowledged that the elimination of war was the direct result of non-violence practiced on a general scale. But we can take a more objective view of war today. What was so terrible about it? War had a profound selective value, perfectly in accord with the teachings of Darwin and Mendel and others. Without war the mass of useless, incompetent mankind, without training or intelligence, is permitted to grow and expand unchecked. War acted to reduce their numbers; like storms and earthquakes and droughts, it was nature's way of eliminating the unfit.  \"Without war the lower elements of mankind have increased all out of proportion. They threaten the educated few, those with scientific knowledge and training, the ones equipped to direct society. They have no regard for science or a scientific society, based on reason. And this Movement seeks to aid and abet them. Only when scientists are in full control can the--\"         *       *       *       *       *  He looked at his watch and then kicked the car door open. \"I'll tell you the rest as we walk.\"  They"]]]
