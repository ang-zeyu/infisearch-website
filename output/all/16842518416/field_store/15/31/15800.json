It is disagreeable to think of, but it is none the less true, and for one I think we should face the facts.  I ask the careful student of school literature to compare the following selection, which I have written myself with great care, and arranged with special reference to the matter of choice and difficult words, with the flippant and commonplace terms used in the average school book of to-day.  One day as George Pillgarlic was going to his tasks, and while passing through the wood, he spied a tall man approaching in an opposite direction along the highway.  \"Ah!\" thought George, in a low, mellow tone of voice, \"whom have we here?\"  \"Good morning, my fine fellow,\" exclaimed the stranger, pleasantly. \"Do you reside in this locality?\"  \"Indeed I do,\" retorted George, cheerily, doffing his cap. \"In yonder cottage, near the glen, my widowed mother and her thirteen children dwell with me.\"  \"And is your father dead?\" exclaimed the man, with a rising inflection.  \"Extremely so,\" murmured the lad, \"and, oh, sir, that is why my poor mother is a widow.\"  \"And how did your papa die?\" asked the man, as he thoughtfully stood on the other foot awhile.  \"Alas! sir,\" said George, as a large hot tear stole down his pale cheek, and fell with a loud report on the warty surface of his bare foot, \"he was lost at sea in a bitter gale. The good ship foundered two years ago last Christmastide, and father was foundered at the same time. No one knew of the loss of the ship and that the crew was drowned until the next spring, and it was then too late.\"  \"And what is your age, my fine fellow?\" quoth the stranger.  \"If I live till next October,\" said the boy, in a declamatory tone of voice suitable for a Second Reader. \"I will be seven years of age.\"  \"And who provides for your mother and her large family of children?\" queried the man.  \"Indeed, I do, sir,\" replied George, in a shrill tone. \"I toil, oh, so hard, sir, for we are very, very poor, and since my elder sister, Ann, was married and brought her husband home to live with us, I have to toil more assiduously than heretofore.\"  \"And by what means do you obtain a livelihood?\" exclaimed the man, in slowly measured and grammatical words.  \"By digging wells, kind sir,\" replied George, picking up a tired ant as he spoke and stroking it on the back. \"I have a good education, and so I am able to dig wells as well as a man. I do this day-times and take in washing at night. In this way I am enabled barely to maintain our family in a precarious manner; but, oh, sir, should my other sisters marry, I fear that some of my brothers-in-law would have to suffer.\"  \"And do you not fear the deadly fire-damp?\" asked the stranger in an earnest tone.  \"Not by a damp sight,\" answered George, with a low gurgling laugh, for he was a great wag.  \"You are indeed a brave lad,\" exclaimed the stranger, as he repressed a smile. \"And do you not at times become very weary and wish for other ways of passing your time?\"  \"Indeed, I do, sir,\" said the lad. \"I would fain run and romp and be gay like other boys, but I must engage in constant manual exercise, or we will have no bread to eat, and I have not seen a pie since papa perished in the moist and moaning sea.\"  \"And what if I were to tell you that your papa did not perish at sea, but was saved from a humid grave?\" asked the stranger in pleasing tones.  \"Ah, sir,\" exclaimed George, in a genteel manner, again doffing his cap, \"I am too polite to tell you what I would say, and beside, sir, you are much larger than I am.\"  \"But, my brave lad,\" said the man in low musical tones, \"do you not know me, Georgie? Oh, George!\"  \"I must say,\" replied George, \"that you have the advantage of me. Whilst I may have met you before, I cannot at this moment place you, sir.\"  \"My son! oh, my son!\" murmured the man, at the same time taking a large strawberry mark out of his valise and showing it to the lad. \"Do you not recognize your parent on your father's side? When our good ship went to the bottom, all perished save me. I swam several miles through the billows, and at last utterly exhausted, gave up all hope of life. Suddenly I stepped on something hard. It was the United States.  \"And now, my brave boy,\" exclaimed the man with great glee, \"see what I have brought for you.\" It was but the work of a moment to unclasp from a shawl-strap which he held in his hand and present to George's astonished gaze a large 40-cent water-melon, which until now had been concealed by the shawl-strap.  [Illustration]     [Illustration: Craqueodoom.]        The Crankadox leaned o'er the edge of the moon        And wistfully gazed on the sea      Where the Gryxabodill madly whistled a tune        To the air of Ti-fol-de-ding-dee.      The quavering shriek of the Fliupthecreek        Was fitfully wafted afar      To the Queen of the Wunks as she powdered her cheek        With the pulverized rays of a star.       The Gool closed his ear on the voice of the Grig,        And his heart it grew heavy as lead      As he marked the Baldekin adjusting his wig        On the opposite side of his head;      And the air it grew chill as the Gryxabodill        Raised his dank, dripping fins to the skies,      To plead with the Plunk for the use of her bill        To pick the tears out of his eyes.       The ghost of the Zhack flitted by in a trance;        And the Squidjum hid under a tub      As he heard the loud hooves of the Hooken advance        With a rub-a-dub-dub-a-dub dub!      And the Crankadox cried as he laid down and died,        \"My fate there is none to bewail!\"      While the Queen of the Wunks drifted over the tide        With a long piece of crape to her tail.     The Chemist of the Carolinas   Asheville, N. C., Dec. 13--Last week I went out into the mountains for the purpose of securing a holly tree with red berries on it for Yuletide. I had noticed in all my pictures of Christmas festivities in England that the holly, with cranberries on it, constituted the background of Yuletide. A Yuletide in England without a holly bough and a little mistletoe in it wouldn't be worth half price. Here these vegetables grow in great confusion, owing to the equable climate, and so the holly tree is within the reach of all.  I resolved to secure one personally, so I sped away into the mountains where, in less than the time it takes to tell it, I had succeeded in finding a holly tree and losing myself. It is a very solemn sensation to feel that you are lost, and that before you can be found something is liable to happen to the universe.  I wandered aimlessly about for half an hour, hoping that I would be missed in society and some one sent in search of me. I was just about to give up in despair and sink down on a bed of moss with the idea of shuffling off six or seven feet of mortal coil when, a few rods away, I saw a blue smoke issuing from the side of the mountain and rising toward the sky. I went rapidly towards it and found it to be a plain dugout with a dirt floor. I entered and cast myself upon a rude nail keg, allowing my feet to remain suspended at the lower end of my legs, an attitude which I frequently affect when fatigued.  [Illustration]  The place was not occupied at the time I entered, though there was a fire and things looked as though the owner had not been long absent. It seemed to be a kind of laboratory, for I could see here and there the earmarks of the chemist. I feared at first that it was a bomb factory, but as I could not see any of these implements in a perfected state I decided that it was safe and waited for the owner to arrive.  After a time I heard a low guttural footstep approaching up the hill. I went to the door and exclaimed to the proprietor as he came, \"Merry Christmas, Colonel.\"  \"Merry Christmas be d----d!\" said he in the same bantering tone. \"What in three dashes, two hyphens and an astonisher do you want here, you double-dashed and double-blanketed blank to dash and return!!\"  The wording here is my own, but it gives an idea of the way the conversation was drifting. You can see by his manner that literary people are not alone in being surly, irritable and unreasonable.  So I humored him and spoke kindly to him and smoothed down his ruffled plumage with my gay badinage, for he wore a shawl and you can never tell whether a man wearing a shawl is armed or not. I give herewith a view of this chemist as he appeared on the morning I met him.  It will be noticed that he was a man about medium height with clear-cut features and hair and retreating brisket. His hair was dark and hung in great waves which seemed to have caught the sunlight and retained it together with a great many other atmospheric phenomena. He wore a straw hat, such as I once saw Horace Greeley catch grasshoppers in, on the banks of the Kinnickinnick, just before he caught a small trout.  I spent some time with him watching him as he made his various experiments. Finally, he showed me a new beverage that he had been engaged in perfecting. It was inclosed in a dark brown stone receptacle and was held in place by a common corn-cob stopper. I took some of it in order to show that I confided in him. I do not remember anything else distinctly. The fumes of this drink went at once to my brain, where it had what might be termed a complete walkover.  I now have no hesitation in saying that the fluid must have been alcoholic in its nature, for when I regained my consciousness I was extremely elsewhere. I found myself on a road which seemed to lead in two opposite directions, and my mind was very much confused.  I hardly know how I got home, but I finally did get there, accompanied by a strong leaning towards Prohibition. A few days ago I received the following letter:  Sir:--I at first thought when I saw you at my laboratory the other day that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3014"],["title","The Old Northwest: A Chronicle of the Ohio Valley and Beyond (#0)"],["body","Old Northwest  By Frederic Austin Ogg  A Chronicle of the Ohio Valley and Beyond  Volume 19 of the Chronicles of America Series ∴ Allen Johnson, Editor Assistant Editors Gerhard R.

Pontiac's Conspiracy  The fall of Montreal, on September 8, 1760, while the plains about the city were still dotted with the white tents of the victorious English and colonial troops, was indeed an event of the deepest consequence to America and to the world. By the articles of capitulation which were signed by the Marquis de Vaudreuil, Governor of New France, Canada and all its dependencies westward to the Mississippi passed to the British Crown. Virtually ended was the long struggle for the dominion of the New World. Open now for English occupation and settlement was that vast country lying south of the Great Lakes between the Ohio and the Mississippi--which we know as the Old Northwest--today the seat of five great commonwealths of the United States.  With an ingenuity born of necessity, the French pathfinders and colonizers of the Old Northwest had chosen for their settlements sites which would serve at once the purposes of the priest, the trader, and the soldier; and with scarcely an exception these sites are as important today as when they were first selected. Four regions, chiefly, were still occupied by the French at the time of the capitulation of Montreal. The most important, as well as the most distant, of these regions was on the east bank of the Mississippi, opposite and below the present city of St. Louis, where a cluster of missions, forts, and trading-posts held the center of the tenuous line extending from Canada to Louisiana. A second was the Illinois country, centering about the citadel of St. Louis which La Salle had erected in 1682 on the summit of \"Starved Rock,\" near the modern town of Ottawa in Illinois. A third was the valley of the Wabash, where in the early years of the eighteenth century Vincennes had become the seat of a colony commanding both the Wabash and the lower Ohio. And the fourth was the western end of Lake Erie, where Detroit, founded by the doughty Cadillac in 1701, had assumed such strength that for fifty years it had discouraged the ambitions of the English to make the Northwest theirs.  Sir Jeffrey Amherst, to whom Vaudreuil surrendered in 1760, forthwith dispatched to the western country a military force to take possession of the posts still remaining in the hands of the French. The mission was entrusted to a stalwart New Hampshire Scotch-Irishman, Major Robert Rogers, who as leader of a band of intrepid \"rangers\" had made himself the hero of the northern frontier. Two hundred men were chosen for the undertaking, and on the 13th of September the party, in fifteen whaleboats, started up the St. Lawrence for Detroit.  At the mouth of the Cuyahoga River, near the site of the present city of Cleveland, the travelers were halted by a band of Indian chiefs and warriors who, in the name of their great ruler Pontiac, demanded to know the object of their journeying. Parleys followed, in which Pontiac himself took part, and it was explained that the French had surrendered Canada to the English and that the English merely proposed to assume control of the western posts, with a view to friendly relations between the red men and the white men. The rivers, it was promised, would flow with rum, and presents from the great King would be forthcoming in endless profusion. The explanation seemed to satisfy the savages, and, after smoking the calumet with due ceremony, the chieftain and his followers withdrew.  Late in November, Rogers and his men in their whaleboats appeared before the little palisaded town of Detroit. They found the French commander, Belêtre, in surly humor and seeking to stir up the neighboring Wyandots and Potawatomi against them. But the attempt failed, and there was nothing for Belêtre to do but yield. The French soldiery marched out of the fort, laid down their arms, and were sent off as prisoners down the river. The fleur-de-lis, which for more than half a century had floated over the village, was hauled down, and, to the accompaniment of cheers, the British ensign was run up. The red men looked on with amazement at this display of English authority and marveled how the conquerors forbore to slay their vanquished enemies on the spot.  Detroit in 1760 was a picturesque, lively, and rapidly growing frontier town. The central portions of the settlement, lying within the bounds of the present city, contained ninety or a hundred small houses, chiefly of wood and roofed with bark or thatch. A well-built range of barracks afforded quarters for the soldiery, and there were two public buildings--a council house and a little church. The whole was surrounded by a square palisade twenty-five feet high, with a wooden bastion at each corner and a blockhouse over each gateway. A broad passageway, the chemin du ronde, lay next to the palisade, and on little narrow streets at the center the houses were grouped closely together.  Above and below the fort the banks of the river were lined on both sides, for a distance of eight or nine miles, with little rectangular farms, so laid out as to give each a water-landing. On each farm was a cottage, with a garden and orchard, surrounded by a fence of rounded pickets; and the countryside rang with the shouts and laughter of a prosperous and happy peasantry. Within the limits of the settlement were villages of Ottawas, Potawatomi, and Wyandots, with whose inhabitants the French lived on free and easy terms. \"The joyous sparkling of the bright blue water,\" writes Parkman; \"the green luxuriance of the woods; the white dwellings, looking out from the foliage; and in the distance the Indian wigwams curling their smoke against the sky--all were mingled in one broad scene of wild and rural beauty.\"  At the coming of the English the French residents were given an opportunity to withdraw. Few, however, did so, and from the gossipy correspondence of the pleasure-loving Colonel Campbell, who for some months was left in command of the fort, it appears that the life of the place lost none of its gayety by the change of masters. Sunday card parties at the quarters of the commandant were festive affairs; and at a ball held in celebration of the King's birthday the ladies presented an appearance so splendid as to call forth from the impressionable officer the most extravagant praises. A visit in the summer of 1761 from Sir William Johnson, general supervisor of Indian affairs on the frontier, became the greatest social event in the history of the settlement, if not of the entire West. Colonel Campbell gave a ball at which the guests danced nine hours. Sir William reciprocated with one at which they danced eleven hours. A round of dinners and calls gave opportunity for much display of frontier magnificence, as well as for the consumption of astonishing quantities of wines and cordials. Hundreds of Indians were interested spectators, and the gifts with which they were generously showered were received with evidences of deep satisfaction.  No amount of fiddling and dancing, however, could quite drown apprehension concerning the safety of the post and the security of the English hold upon the great region over which this fort and its distant neighbors stood sentinel. Thousands of square miles of territory were committed to the keeping of not more than six hundred soldiers. From the French there was little danger. But from the Indians anything might be expected. Apart from the Iroquois, the red men had been bound to the French by many ties of friendship and common interest, and in the late war they had scalped and slaughtered and burned unhesitatingly at the French command. Hardly, indeed, had the transfer of territorial sovereignty been made before murmurs of discontent began to be heard.  Notwithstanding outward expressions of assent to the new order of things, a deep-rooted dislike on the part of the Indians for the English grew after 1760 with great rapidity. They sorely missed the gifts and supplies lavishly provided by the French, and they warmly resented the rapacity and arrogance of the British traders. The open contempt of the soldiery at the posts galled the Indians, and the confiscation of their lands drove them to desperation. In their hearts hope never died that the French would regain their lost dominion; and again and again rumors were set afloat that this was about to happen. The belief in such a reconquest was adroitly encouraged, too, by the surviving French settlers and traders. In 1761 the tension among the Indians was increased by the appearance of a \"prophet\" among the Delawares, calling on all his race to purge itself of foreign influences and to unite to drive the white man from the land.  Protests against English encroachments were frequent and, though respectful, none the less emphatic. At a conference in Philadelphia in 1761, an Iroquois sachem declared, \"We,"]]]
