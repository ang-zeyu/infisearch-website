They had serviced and checked the fighters and now their Pratt and Whitney twin bank radial engines were turning over smoothly. Exhausts flared blue flames which sent wavering shadows across the wet cement of the apron. Flight Officer Mickle was running about like an old hen with a scattered brood of chicks.  Stan glanced down the wet and gleaming runway. An Aldis lamp winked down toward the shadow bar. Stan eased himself back against the shock pad. He glanced at his temperature gauge and across his instrument board. The throb of his Pratt and Whitney engine hinted at power, though it was rolling over smoothly and effortlessly. Stan remembered other nights many months past when he had sat in a Hurricane waiting for the flash of the lamp and the order from the tower to go up through the blind alley between the barrage balloon cables to wage unequal war against invading Germans. Things had changed a lot since then. Now he was a part of the Eighth Air Force of the United States Army and was fighting for his own country as well as Britain.  \"Red Flight, check your temperatures.\" That was the voice of Flight Leader Sim Jones.  The boys checked in one at a time.  \"Up to fifteen thousand. Stay in close,\" Sim ordered.  Suddenly a motor burst into full-throated roar. A dark form hurtled down the runway and lifted like a flash. Another ship darted away, and then another. Stan slammed his hatch cover shut and opened up his throttle. He jammed down hard on one brake and the Thunderbolt swept around. She poised an instant, then knifed down the slippery runway. Stan hoiked her tail with a blast of prop pressure and hopped her off. He went roaring out over a mobile floodlight and up into the dark sky for the rendezvous with Red Flight.  High above the channel, the ships of his flight tucked in and circled. Soon they picked up the flight of Liberators and Fortresses. At twenty-five thousand feet the big bombers left broad vapor trails behind them. Stan looked down upon the killers from his perch in the sky. Dawn was breaking and the scene was no longer drab.  Red Flight was covering the flank of Second High Squadron. Stan could clearly see Third Low Squadron and First Lead Squadron. Each squadron was composed of a first flight of three bombers and a second flight of three bombers. Stan grinned. He knew exactly where his pal March Allison was flying. He was in left-hand slot, second flight, Second High Squadron, the hottest spot in a bomber formation.  Stan eased over a bit and shook O'Malley off his wing. Sim was waggling his wings, ordering the boys to spread out and get set for interception. Red Flight spread out but stayed in position like a football team moving into formation for a screen pass. The bombers roared on toward Germany, keeping tight formation so as to be able to lay out a deadly cross fire from their fifty-caliber guns. Each Fort and each Lib was a bristling pillbox with nose guns, waist guns, belly guns, and ball turret guns. Stan wondered if he would not be flying one of the big fellows very soon.  Everything went off smoothly and according to plan, except that for once Weather had missed a bet. As the flight neared the point over Germany where the Thunderbolts were to turn back, a cold wind washed the sky clear of clouds and a cold sun shone upon the raiders.  \"In the good auld summertime.\" Stan heard O'Malley humming.  \"Shut up, O'Malley,\" Sim grated.  Suddenly flak began to blossom out from the countryside below. It blossomed in the sky over the bombers and in the middle of Red Flight. Thunderbolts ducked and dipped but went roaring on.  Down below, the bomber boys were scanning the skies.  In his Fort, Allison drawled over the intercom, \"Pilot to navigator.\"  \"Go ahead, pilot.\"  \"Everybody set?\"  \"Navigator to pilot, hot stuff coming up.\"  \"Right waist gunner to pilot, sir. 190's at eleven o'clock. They're after the flight ahead.\"  \"Rear gunner Roger, sir. Flock of Focke-Wulfs at six o'clock. Coming in on our tail.\"  \"I say, old man, don't get itchy fingers. No ammo to waste.\" Allison's voice was calm and unruffled.  O'Malley's voice broke in over Stan's headset. \"Hey, sure an' we ought to go down an' bust that up.\"  \"Stay where you are, O'Malley,\" Sim snapped. \"We have plenty of Me's coming in at twelve o'clock.\"  Stan had been so busy watching the bombers he had not checked his own part of the sky. A glance showed him Sim was correct. A flight of some twenty Me fighters were diving and circling above.  \"Keep them up there,\" Sim ordered. \"But stay in your slot. You happen to be outnumbered and you also happen to have the job of seeing that those Me's stay up there away from the bombers.\"  Red Flight knifed along through the thin air, ready to smash any Me daring to go down the chute upon the bombers.  \"Come on down and fight, ye spalpeens!\" O'Malley was yelling.  Stan saw that the Forts and Libs were slamming lead at the Focke-Wulfs in a blaze that rivaled a Fourth of July celebration. He kept an eye on Allison's Fort and saw an FW go down flaming after a thrust at the bomber. Stan chuckled softly.  \"Allison got one!\" O'Malley yelled. \"'Tis a sad day, this, for Mrs. O'Malley's son.\"  Allison's Fort got another FW and O'Malley's flow of abuse against the Me's increased. He was in a towering Irish rage. But it did no good. The Me's hung on, waiting for the Thunderbolts to turn back. It was a case of who ran short of gas first. Now \"lace-panty\" flak was blossoming all over the sky. It exploded in pretty pink bursts and that was why the boys gave it such a fancy name.  \"We have to go in,\" Sim ordered grimly.  \"Go in!\" O'Malley bellowed. \"Why not give them birds a scare anyway?\"  \"We'll zoom up and scatter them,\" Sim said. \"But any man who stays to put on a show will have to walk back.\"  Stan eased over and kicked on a bit more power. The Germans had the attack route well charted. They knew just how far the Thunderbolts would be able to penetrate. With a burst of speed Stan went up and over. Every Thunderbolt did the same, but O'Malley beat them all to it. He roared over Stan's head, almost ripping away his hatch cover.  The Me's ducked gracefully and scattered. They looped and dived for it. Stan saw at once the chase was hopeless. The Jerries meant to tease the Thunderbolts deeper into Germany so that they would be sure to run out of gas. It was infuriating, but there just was nothing that could be done about it. Stan watched O'Malley as he roared after a Jerry.  \"Come back, Irisher. They're just tricking you out of gas,\" he called.  \"The spalpeens!\" O'Malley roared, but he zoomed up and over, then tailed in after Red Flight which was heading for home.  Stan saw the Me's dive down to overtake and attack the Forts and Libs. He had a cold, sick feeling in the pit of his stomach. He still was not convinced that the big fellows could take care of themselves. They had a hundred miles more to cover before reaching their targets, and then another hundred to return before fighters could meet them.  Red Flight slid in on its home field, a sleek flight group in fine trim, except for one slight wound. Sim's ship had picked up a small piece of flak, but it had done no damage. Sim had it in his hand when he climbed down and joined his men.  \"A foine battle!\" O'Malley fumed.  \"I was hit,\" Sim said, grinning.  \"'Tis the fillin' out o' one o' yer teeth,\" O'Malley answered.  \"I counted eight fighters shot down by the big boys,\" a pilot remarked.  \"Check in all kills you observed,\" Sim said. \"It will help the bomber boys get credit.\"  O'Malley stared gloomily up into the sky. Stan nudged him. \"How about some breakfast?\" he asked.  O'Malley brightened a bit. \"I ordered a pie for breakfast,\" he said. \"If that cook forgot my pie, he'll be no more than a grease spot when I get through with him.\"  O'Malley got his pie, a thick apple pie dripping with juice. He cut it into quarters, slid one slab out on his fist and began munching, paying no attention to the dripping juice. Stan stared into his coffee cup. He was thinking.  O'Malley finished his second quarter of pie. He looked at Stan.  \"What you dreamin' up now?\" he asked.  Stan smiled faintly. \"You know, I have a hunch we might fool those Jerries. They have this all down to a science. A flight is reported to their head man and he figures out just how far we can fly. If we could do say a hundred miles more, we'd have some fun.\"  \"So you're goin' to order planes with a hundred more miles gas supply.\" O'Malley grunted and attacked his third piece of pie.  \"We could take along emergency tanks and drop them,\" Stan said.  O'Malley halted the movement of his hand. His mouth was open like a cavern. He closed it.  \"Sure, an' 'tis a brilliant idea. We'll see the general about it as soon as I've finished me pie.\"  \"No, we'll see Holt. He's our superior officer. Let him have the credit.\" Stan leaned back.  \"If we tell a lot o' brass hats, the Jerries will sure hear about it,\" O'Malley said sourly.  \"I think not. We have to get permission to install the tanks, you know. This isn't the South Pacific where you just go to your ground crew and ask them to rig up something for you.\" Stan laughed as O'Malley screwed his face into a frown.  \"I'll say it's not the South Pacific,\" he agreed. \"We got so many rules here a fellow gets tangled up before he takes off.\"  \"We have lots of time on our hands. We'll barge over and have Allison tell us what happened. He'll be back after a bit.\"  O'Malley gave Stan a suspicious look. \"You're not thinkin' o' askin' fer one o' them crates full o' guns?\"  \"No,\" Stan answered. \"If I did, I doubt that they'd take me. I've been a fighter pilot too long.\"  \"They took Allison,\" O'Malley said.  \"Allison is a natural for bombers, he has no nerves and he can handle a crew.\" Stan got to his feet. \"Finish your pie and we'll be on our way.\"     CHAPTER II  ACTION   Stan and O'Malley found Allison in his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29774"],["title","A Yankee Flier Over Berlin (#2)"],["body","quarters, an old English mansion set on a little hill. It stood in the middle of well-kept grounds. As they drove up in their borrowed jeep, O'Malley scowled at the house.  \"A blinking castle,\" he said in mock cockney British.  They parked the jeep and went inside. The boys were gathered around an open fire lounging in easy chairs. Allison moved out of a huddle and crossed the room.  \"Welcome, you wallflowers,\" he said with a big smile.  \"Sure, an' yer a disgrace to the both of us, lollin' in the lap o' luxury,\" O'Malley answered with a big grin.  \"How was it?\" Stan asked.  \"Very rugged,\" Allison admitted. \"Sit down while I order a pie for O'Malley.\"  The boys seated themselves and Allison described the mission. He loaded his pipe and sat staring into the fire.  \"Not much like pushing a Spitfire or a Thunderbolt. You just plow along through the muck and hope the boys will bat down all of the fighters coming at you from every angle.\"  \"How many did you get?\" O'Malley asked.  \"Six for sure,\" Allison answered. \"The real fun started when we headed for home. We had been plowing through flak as thick as a swarm of bees but we had been lucky. Two of our flight went down flaming and we saw the boys bail out. I thought we were slipping through pretty nicely when an Me winged us with an explosive cannon shell. After that we got hit plenty. We picked up a shell which went off inside our outboard engine. It started rolling smoke but no flames. Then a shell smashed the intercom system and communications went dead.\" Allison bit down hard on his pipe.  \"Must have been tough,\" Stan said.  \"We couldn't hold our altitude. We lost about a thousand feet a minute and nothing the copilot and I could do would hold her up.\"  \"Sure, an' you did a good job of it gettin' in,\" O'Malley praised.  \"When I couldn't talk to the crew I turned the controls over to the copilot and went aft. I got to the top turret man and told him to get the gunners together in the radio compartment. I figured we'd smack right down into the channel.\" Allison fingered his pipe and stared into the fire.  \"I went back to the copilot and we fought her head. She sagged in over the coast and came right on home, smoking like a torch. As we came in, we found we had a belly landing on our hands, so we skidded her in. Poor Old Sal is a mess right now.\"  \"Anybody hurt?\" Stan asked.  \"Bombardier got a piece of flak in his leg. The tail gunner had his greenhouse blown into his face and is in the hospital. I forgot to say we dumped our guns and everything else we could pry loose. I guess that saved us.\" Allison leaned back. \"When you fellows going to shift over? This is the real thing.\"  \"Sitting duck stuff,\" O'Malley snorted. \"You jest sit there an' take it. You never fired a gun on the whole trip.\"  \"No,\" Allison admitted. \"But we bagged six Jerries and there was plenty of shooting. You should see my boys work those 50's.\"  \"We aim to stir up a bit of excitement,\" Stan said.  Allison frowned at him. \"You birds better remember this is modern warfare, not the Battle of Britain or the Pacific. They'll bounce you high and quick for breaking rules. This Eighth Air Force is big stuff now.\"  \"Thanks for the warning,\" Stan answered. \"But we plan to go through proper channels.\"  \"And it's a deep secret,\" O'Malley added.  O'Malley's pie arrived and he dropped out of the talk for a time. Stan and Allison chatted about the changes and the amazing way the Eighth had grown up until it took a large section of British farmland to house it.  Stan and O'Malley left early and hurried back to their own mess. They wanted to corner Colonel Holt. They found him in the mess looking very dour and gloomy. He was alone. None of the other men seemed to care about trying to cheer him up. Stan and O'Malley barged over to his table.  \"May we sit down, sir?\" Stan asked.  \"Sure.\" Holt motioned to two chairs.  The boys sat down. Stan ordered coffee and O'Malley ordered pie.  \"I need just a bite to get me in shape for supper,\" he said when Stan glared at him as he gave his order.  \"Lousy show today,\" Holt grumbled. \"I don't mean the way you fellows flew it, but the way the Germans have everything figured out so neatly. We lost eleven bombers.\"  \"We might fool Jerry,\" Stan suggested.  \"How?\"  \"Suppose we just toted along some extra tanks of gas and cut them loose about the time the show should start. We know their tactics and pattern. We'd have a lot of fun.\" Stan leaned forward.  \"Can't do that,\" Holt said. \"You fellows might have to get busy as soon as you hit the coast. Kicking off a tank can't be done with an FW dropping out of a cloud on your tail.\"  \"Just half of us will go with extra loads. The others can cover for us. We'd sure surprise Jerry.\" Stan spoke eagerly.  \"Foine idea an' one I'd have been proud to have thought up,\" O'Malley broke in.  Colonel Holt began to smile. \"I believe you have something there. The element of surprise and all that sort of thing. We'll take a crack at it.\"  \"Elegant,\" O'Malley said. \"I'm speaking for extra gas.\"  \"You and O'Malley get extra tanks. You're both old heads at lone wolf tactics. I'm beginning to think we have too much handling out of the control room.\" He bent forward and his smile faded. \"But, remember this, I'm under a general who's a stickler for the book, so be careful.\"  \"We won't let you down, sir,\" Stan promised.  O'Malley just grinned wolfishly. \"I got a date with that Jerry with the red beard.\"  \"You boys tend to the installing yourselves. Oversee it yourselves. I'll put through an order clearing everything for you.\"  \"Thanks, Colonel,\" Stan said. \"Now we'll run along and get busy.\"  \"First you come with me and we'll figure out how much tank capacity you'll need and how many men will go along.\" The colonel got to his feet.  \"If you don't mind, sir, we'd like to have you sponsor the idea. We intended to take it up with Lieutenant Sim Jones first. Wouldn't want to be going over his head.\" Stan spoke quickly.  Holt looked at him and nodded. \"That's fine of you boys. Mind if I claim the idea for the present?\"  \"Not in the least,\" Stan answered.  \"In that case you'll hear from me later through regular channels. I see you men know your way around in this army.\"  Stan and O'Malley saluted and moved off. O'Malley grinned. \"Slick work, Stan,\" he said. \"Now we won't get blamed for anything.\"  \"And we won't get a medal, either,\" Stan remarked as he matched O'Malley's grin.  Returning to their Nissen hut the boys policed their living quarters and got things in order. The hut was such a primitive affair that little could be done to keep it in order. The round wood stove leaked ashes on the floor which was always tracked deep with mud. There was a little wash bowl and a table which O'Malley used to stack his laundry upon. The cots were GI with GI mattresses.  After they had cleaned up, the boys went over to the huge sheds where the mechanics worked over the planes. They learned from the chief mechanic that Colonel Holt's order had come through.  \"I have the boys on your ships,\" the sergeant said. He did not seem to approve of the idea.  \"I'll be after lookin' out fer me own ship,\" O'Malley said and hurried away.  \"You don't seem to like the colonel's idea,\" Stan said.  \"We've tried it before, sir,\" the sergeant replied.  \"What happened?\"  \"The boys got jumped out of cloud cover and were sitting ducks for the Jerries,\" the sergeant said sourly. \"Too much cloud cover and too many Jerries for that stuff.\"  Stan grinned. \"I'll drop around and let you know how it works this time.\"  Walking back to his ship he watched the boys working on her. He was soon satisfied that they knew just what should be done and made off. O'Malley did not show up at mess and Stan began to wonder where he had gone. He finally sauntered into the rest room where he found O'Malley shooting the breeze with a group of fliers.  \"You missed a steak dinner,\" Stan greeted him.  O'Malley grinned, \"That's what you think,\" he said. \"I had me a steak dinner with the corporal that fixed up me ship. You know that feller hadn't had a steak for a month. He sure went for it.\" O'Malley seated himself and elevated his feet to the top of the radio. In this position he promptly went to sleep.  Stan talked with the boys until time to turn in. He wakened O'Malley and they sloshed through the mud to their hut. During their absence, two other boys, replacement men, had been quartered in the hut. They greeted the two old heads eagerly.  They were Bugs Monahan and Splinters Wright, both from Toledo, Ohio. They had just finished flight combat school and were eager for action. Someone had given them the records of Stan and O'Malley. They were both eager to talk to the veterans. Splinters was a tall, thin youth with a little mustache. Bugs was short and fat with a round beaming face and a quick smile.  \"We've heard a lot about you fellows,\" Bugs said.  \"Never believe anything you hear in the army,\" Stan advised with a grin.  \"Sure, an' ye've been taken in by me auld pal Goebbels,\" O'Malley added.  \"I'm turning in. We'll get a call along about four in the morning,\" Stan said. \"See you boys over at the rest room. That's where we shoot the breeze.\"  \"See you at midnight when we get up to poke wood into that stove,\" O'Malley contradicted.  \"We'll keep the fire going. We're not sleepy,\" Splinters said. They were both disappointed that the old heads did not want to go into a gabfest.  Stan and O'Malley turned in. They had learned to get as much sleep as possible. The two replacements kept the fire going as they had promised, and the boys did not waken until they were called at three-fifty the next morning. Bugs and Splinters had gotten a little sleep. They were up instantly and eager to trail along and see what was going to happen.  \"Ye'll soon learn to sleep when ye get a chance,\" O'Malley said.  They sloshed across to the operations room and joined their flight. Maps were ready and Colonel Holt was standing with his"]]]
