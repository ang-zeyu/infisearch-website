No ...                      no, he whispered. Don't you                            understand...._                              WE'RE FRIENDS, NOW                               By HENRY HASSE                             ILLUSTRATED by VARGA         *       *       *       *       *     Today more than other days Raoul Beardsley felt the burden, the dragging sense of inevitability. He frowned; he glanced at his watch; he leaned forward to speak to the copter pilot and then changed his mind. He settled back, and from idle habit adjusted his chair-scope to the familiar broad-spoked area of Washington just below.  \"I'll _not_ have it happening again today!\" he told himself grimly ... and at once his thoughts quavered off into many tangles of self-reproach. \"Blasted nonsense the way I've been acting. A _machine_, a damned gutless machine like that! Why do I persist in letting it get to me?\"  He pondered that and found no solace. \"Delusion,\" he snorted. \"Hyper synapse-disorder ... that's how Jeff Arnold would explain _me_. I wish he'd confine his diagnostics to the Mechanical Division where it belongs! He's amused, they're all amused at me--but damn it they just don't know!\"  Beardsley's rotund body sagged at the thought. Adjusting the chair-scope, he fixed his gaze on the broad facade of Crime-Central Building far across the city; again he felt the burgeoning embarrassment and foreboding, but he put it down with an effort before it reached the edge of fear. _Not today_, he thought fiercely. _No, by God, I just won't permit it to happen._  There. So! He felt much better already. And he had really made good time this morning. Today of _all_ days he mustn't keep ECAIAC waiting.  [Illustration: Beardsley was the only one _not_ to panic when the infallible machine broke down.]  Mustn't.... Something triggered in Beardsley, and he was assailed with a perverse rebellion at the thought.         *       *       *       *       *  Must not? But why not? Why shouldn't he just _once_ keep ECAIAC and Jeff Arnold and his clique stewing in their own tangle of tubes and electronic juice? And wouldn't _this_, he gloated, be the perfect day for it! Arnold especially--just once to shatter that young man's complacent routine....  No. Beardsley savored the thought tastily, and let it trickle away, and the look of glee on his cherubic face was gone. For too many years his job as serological \"coördinator\" (Crime-Central) had kept him pinned to the concomitant routine. Pinned or crucified, it was all the same; in crime analysis as in everything these days, personal sense of achievement had been too unsubtly annihilated. Recalling his just completed task--the Citizen Files and _persona-tapes_ and the endless annotating--Beardsley felt himself sinking still further into that mire of futility that encompassed neither excitement nor particular pride.  He brought himself back with a grimace, aware that he was clutching the briefcase of tapes possessively from long habit. The pilot had touched the news-stat, and abruptly one of the new \"commerciappeals\" grated on Beardsley's senses:  \"... we repeat, yes, PROT-O-SUDS is now available in _flake_ or _cake_ or the new attachable _luxury-spray_. Remember, PROT-O-SUDS has _never_ been laboratory-tested, it contains _no_ miracle ingredients, _no_ improved scientific formula, and NO LANOLIN. Then what is the new PROT-O-SUDS? I tell you frankly, friends, it is nothing but a lot of pure soft soap! Remember ... we make no fabulous claims for PROT-O-SUDS ... we assume that you are reasonably clean to start with! And now for your late breakfast news, PROT-O-SUDS takes you direct to the Central News Bureau for a final survey on the Carmack murder case....\"  Beardsley groaned. New voice in the background, while the screen presented a slow montage. Cine-runs of the great Carmack himself, including those at the International Cybernetics Congress a year ago ... survey of the murder scene, the Carmack mansion ... close-up of ECAIAC ... diagrammatic detail of ECAIAC ... then dramatically, the grim and imposing figure of George Mandleco, Minister of Justice.  And then the news-caster's voice: \"... certain that final processing will go forward today. It would be a gross understatement to say that the Carmack Case has captured the attention of the nation, both officialdom and public alike! _Never_ in the history of Crime-Central has there been such an undercurrent of speculation and excitement....\"  \"Excitement?\" murmured Beardsley.  \"And now it is heightened, by no less an authority than the Minister of Justice himself, who brought both plaudits and censure upon himself today with the outright statement that _deep-rooted political issues_ may well be involved. As you must know by now, it was the murdered man himself--Amos Carmack--who some years ago carried on the incessant lobbying that resulted in ECAIAC being accepted _pro bono publico_ by Crime-Central. What devastating irony! For now it is ECAIAC itself that must weigh each detail, correlate all factors, probe every motive and machination leading to the _murder of its creator_....\"  \"That's not entirely true, you know,\" muttered Beardsley.  Quick flicker, again a close-up of ECAIAC, and the drama-laden voice: \"ECAIAC! Electronic Analysis Integrator and Computor. And now--an exclusive! From a very reliable source this reporter has learned that _three Primes_ are involved....\"  \"Ha!\" grated Beardsley.  \"... and they will be broken down in quotient. Two must ultimately be eliminated--barring, of course, the possible emergence of any minor factor to status of Prime, which at this stage seems unlikely. It is estimated that by today or tomorrow at the latest Carmack's murderer will be brought to justice....\"  Beardsley had taken as much as he could of this pseudo-factual mush. He jerked forward violently, rapped the pilot on the shoulder. \"DAMN IT! WILL YOU SHUT THE DAMN THING OFF!\"         *       *       *       *       *  He was immediately appalled at his outburst, and by the pilot's startled glance, but the stat went off immediately.  Beardsley leaned back muttering to himself. Carmack, Carmack! For seven weeks now he had lived with it intricately and intimately, as the case shoved everything else right off the news-stat. People took the latest echoes to bed with them, commuters gobbled it with their breakfast cereal. Thank God today would see the end, and they could once more have the hot South Polar crisis with their cereal.         *       *       *       *       *  Seven weeks! He clutched the bulging briefcase with a wearisome horror. Twenty-two persona-tapes from Central File, all neatly processed and ready for ECAIAC. End result of the endless chart sifts, emphasis (as always!) on parietosomatic recession, the slow emergence of minor constants, the inexorable trend toward Price Factor and then _verification_, _verification_, to each his own, with all the subtle and shaded values of the Augment Index brought finally to focus on the relevance-graph _Carmack_.  Sure, thought Beardsley. A thing of augment-indexing and psych-tapes, quite without possibility of error. Now in the _old_ days of crime detection--it might have taken them seven months instead of weeks, not to mention frustration and leg-work and false-leads and sweat, but--  His mouth pulled down bitterly. _Serological Coördinator. Glorified file-clerk is more like it. High-salaried errand-boy._  \"Here we are, sir!\" The pilot's voice jarred him to reality as the copter berthed.  Beardsley hurried toward the roof entrance. His faded blue suit, a size too large, flapped about him, and the outmoded felt hat seemed to sink to the level of his thick-lensed glasses. The guard greeted him, but suppressed a smile as the cherubic little man flashed his official pass.  For there was something about Raoul Beardsley that eternally evoked amusement--an air of vacuous innocence and a remote forlornness. He gave the appearance of a person who sold shoes during the day, washed his wife's dishes at night and then solved two or three galacti-gram puzzles before turning off the light precisely at ten. Few, if any, remembered that this nervous little man had once been top Inspector of New York City's Homicide Bureau ... but that was a dozen long years ago. Since then he had seen the antiquated detective methods of 1960 disappear, and he had died a little, too, seeing his Homicide Bureau relegated to a mere subsidiary with the growth of the Coördinate and Mechanical Divisions. His appointment to Chief of Co-ördinants, Federal, was automatic and unquestioned; and Beardsley would have been the last to know, or to care, that he had correlated some eight million miles of serological data for the entrains of ECAIAC, a perfect record of not a single unsolved case.  And the penalty was in his eyes, if one cared to look beyond the thick-lensed glasses. No one ever did. They were remote eyes, a little bewildered, a little hurt ... a mirror gone dull from times remembered but irretrievably lost.         *       *       *       *       *  Beardsley stepped onto the corridor slidewalk, coasted to the escalator and rode it down. Still immersed in his thoughts, he pushed into ECAIAC's room ... _and again it happened_.  So shockingly sudden, there was not even time for remonstrance at himself. The feeling hit him as always before, straight and unerring, a surging impact that smashed forward and stopped him in his tracks, literally paralyzed.  He caught his breath convulsively. How often had he come here? And how often had this happened, even when he'd sworn he wouldn't let it? There"]]]
