[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Softening ends of two pieces of tubing.]  [Illustration: FIG. 6.--Joining two pieces of tubing end to end--first method.]  As the tube softens and tends to shrink, the two ends are pressed together a little and the walls allowed to thicken slightly, as in _c_. It is then quickly removed from the flame and gently blown as indicated in _d_, continuing the rotation of the tube during the blowing, and at the same time pressing the ends of the tube together a little so as to make a _short_ thick-walled bulb. The joint is then returned to the flame and reheated, rotating as before, shrinking to about the shape of _e_. When this stage is reached, the glass should be very hot and fluid, and the mass of hot glass thick enough to remain at its working temperature for about five seconds after removal from the flame. The glass is now reblown as indicated in _f_, to form a bulb having walls of practically the same thickness as the original tube. As soon as the bulb is blown, the tube is removed from the mouth, held horizontally in front of the worker, and gently drawn out to form one continuous tube, as indicated in _g_. During both the blowing and drawing of this bulb the rotation must be continued, and both blowing and drawing must be carefully regulated so that the resulting tube may have the same internal and external diameter at the joint as elsewhere.  =Discussion.=--In making the original joint, (_a_, Fig. 6), care should be taken that the lump formed is as small as possible so that it may be entirely removed during the subsequent operations. For this reason, only the very tip ends of the two pieces of tubing are held in the flame, and the softening should not extend more than 1/16 inch down the tube. As soon as the ends are sufficiently soft to stick together, they are made to do so. The first drawing of the tube (_b_) should take place immediately, and reduce the lump as much as possible without making the adjacent walls of the tube thin. The whole purpose of the rest of the manipulation is to absorb or \"iron out\" the lump at the joint. For this reason, care is taken that this lump is always in the center of the flame while the joint is being heated, and a small flame is used so that little of the main tube may be softened. During the first shrinking of the joint (_c_) the walls next the lump, being thinner than it is, reach the softening temperature first and are thickened by the slight pushing together of the ends, so that they taper from the lump to the unchanged wall. Upon blowing this joint, these thickened walls blow out with the lump, but as they are thinnest next the unchanged tube, they stiffen there first. Then as the thicker parts are still hot, these blow out more, and with the lump make a more or less uniform wall. By this first operation most of the lump will have been removed, provided it was not too large at first, and the tube was hot enough when it was blown. Beginners almost invariably have the glass too cool here, and find difficulty in blowing out a satisfactory bulb. Under such circumstances the lump will be scarcely affected by the operation.  During the shrinking of this bulb, the thinner parts of course are the first to reach the softening point, and thus contract more than the thick parts, so that practically all of the lump can be absorbed, and a uniformly thickened part of the tube left as in _e_. When this is just accomplished, the second bulb must be blown during one or two seconds, and the tube then drawn out as described, so as to change the bulb to a tube. The drawing must proceed with care: portions nearest the unchanged tubes are the first to reach the proper diameter, and must be given time to just set at that point before the center of the bulb is finally drawn into shape. The drawing is perhaps best done intermittently in a series of quick pulls, each drawing the tube perhaps 1/16 inch, and each taking place as the thumbs and first fingers grasp the tube for a new turn in the rotation. If the tube is not rotated during the blowing, the bulbs will be lop-sided and it will be impossible to get a joint of uniform wall-thickness; if rotation is omitted during the drawing, the tube will almost invariably be quite crooked.  If the lump still shows distinctly after the operations described, the cross-section of the tube will be as in _h_, and the tube will be likely to break if ever reheated at this point after it becomes cold. The operations _d_, _e_, _f_, and _g_ may be repeated upon it, and it may be possible to get it to come out all right.  Care must be taken not to blow the bulbs _d_ and _f_ too thin as they then become very difficult to handle, and the joint is usually spoiled. The wall-thickness of these bulbs must never be much less than that of the original tube. If the joint as completed has thinner walls than the rest of the tube, it will be more easily broken. It should be remembered that the length of the finished tube must be exactly the same as that of the original piece, if the walls of the joint are to be of their original thickness. Therefore the pushing together during the two operations _c_ and _d_ must shorten the tube just as much as the final drawing (_f_ to _g_) lengthens it.  The interval between the removal of the work from the flame and the beginning of the blowing must be made as short as possible, or else the portions next the main parts of the tube will set before they can be blown out, and cause irregular shrunken areas.   EXERCISE NO. 2  JOINING TWO TUBES END TO END--SECOND METHOD  The method described in Exercise No. 1 is very satisfactory for joining short lengths of straight tubing, but becomes inconvenient or impossible when the pieces are long or bent, on account of the difficulty in uniformly rotating such work. In such cases, this second method is used. It does not usually give as smooth and pretty a joint as the first method, and takes a little longer.  The joint is begun exactly as in the first method, and the manipulation is the same until after the preliminary tight joint (_b_, Fig. 6) is made. The flame is reduced as usual, but instead of rotating the tube in the flame, only one part of the circumference is heated, and this is allowed to shrink thoroughly before blowing. It is then blown gently so that it becomes a slight swelling on the tube, and the operation repeated on an adjoining part of the joint. Three or four repetitions of the operation will usually cover the whole circumference of the joint, in a small tube, the result being a swelling roughly similar to the first thick bulb in the first method (_d_, Fig. 6). If all the lumps of the original joint have not been removed by this operation, it may now be repeated upon such parts as may require it. The thickness of the wall in the bulb should be about the same as that in the original tube. The whole of the expanded joint is now heated as uniformly as may be until soft enough so that it begins to shrink a little, and the swelling is gently drawn down to the same diameter as the main tube, as in the first case. Any irregularities in the finished joint may be corrected by local reheating, shrinking or blowing as required.  =Discussion.=--In using this method, especially with larger sizes of tubing, it is very important to keep the whole circumference of the joint hot enough during the operation so that it does not crack apart at the part which has not yet been worked. For that reason the first heating, shrinking and blowing should be performed as quickly as possible, leaving the resulting irregularities to be corrected later, rather than attempting to reblow the same part of the joint several times in succession until it is satisfactory. Care must be taken in this as in the first method that the blowing follows immediately upon the completion of the shrinking and removal of the object from the flame: delay in blowing will cause shrunken places where the joint meets the original tubes, on account of the cooling and setting of the glass before it was blown. Most beginners err in being afraid to shrink the part of the joint enough before blowing it. On small tubing, the shrinkage may often extend so far that the inner surface of the shrunken part reaches the center of the tube. Insufficient shrinking results in failure to remove the lump formed at the original joint. It is often of advantage, after blowing out part of the joint, to allow that part a few seconds to set before going on with the rest, keeping the whole joint warm meanwhile in or near the smoky flame. This helps to prevent the twisting of the joint, or other distortion incident to the handling of a piece of work of awkward shape.  In making a joint on a very long or heavy piece by this method, it is often advantageous to attach a piece of rubber tubing to the open end, hold the other end of this tubing in the mouth during the process, and blow through it, rather than attempt to bring the end of the glass up to the mouth. This enables one to keep closer watch on the joint, and avoid drawing it out or distorting it in handling. On the other hand, the rubber tube is an inconvenience on account of its weight and the consequent pull on the end of the apparatus, and makes rotation difficult.   EXERCISE NO. 3  THE \"TEE\" TUBE  The operations involved are two: the blowing of a short side tube on a piece of tubing, and sealing another piece of tubing on this, by what is essentially the second method as just described.  [Illustration: FIG. 7.--The \"tee\" tube.]  The two pieces of tubing to be used each have one end cut square and the other sealed in the usual manner. The longer of the two is now heated at the point at which the joint is to be made, until it begins to color the flame. A small flame is used, and the tube rotated"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30066"],["title","Laboratory Manual of Glass-Blowing (#4)"],["body","the flame begins to be colored, when the rotation is stopped, and only one spot heated until a spot the diameter of the tube to be sealed on has become red hot and begun to shrink. This is now gently blown out into a small bulb, as in _a_, Fig. 7, and it will be noted that this bulb will have walls tapering from the thick walls of the tube to a very thin wall at the top. The sides of this bulb, below the dotted line, are to form the small side tube to which the main side tube is to be sealed. The top of the bulb is now softened by directing a small flame directly upon it, and as soon as it shrinks to the level indicated by the dotted line, it is removed from the flame and quickly blown out to form a thin bulb, as indicated in _b_, Fig. 7. This will usually be so very thin that a stroke of the file or glass-knife will break it off at the dotted line, leaving the side tube, to which the short piece of tubing is now sealed according to the second method (Exercise No 2). In doing this, care is taken to direct the flame partly on the main tube in the two crotches, so that both tubes blow out a little and give space for the gases to turn in, as indicated in _c_, Fig. 7, and at the same time increase the mechanical strength of the job. On the other hand, care is taken not to deform the main tube, and not to produce such a bulge or bulb at the joint as will prevent the finished tube from lying flat on a table.  =Discussion.=--Most beginners tend to err in the first steps of this operation, by blowing too hard and too long when blowing out the little bulb. The result is a large, very thin bulb, which breaks off in such a way as to leave a hole in the main tube, occupying nearly half the circumference of the tube at that point, instead of the neat side tube which they should have. It is not difficult to seal a tube on this side tube, but it is very difficult to seal a tube into a hole in another tube. Care should be taken here, as in the two previous exercises, that the lump obtained at the joint when the two tubes are put together is made as small as possible, and reduced if possible by gently drawing on the side tube as soon as the tubes have actually joined. It is much easier to prevent the formation of a lump at the joint than it is to remove the lump after it is formed. The remarks previously made about blowing quickly after removing the work from the flame apply here with especial force. A \"tee\" tube, from its very nature, is exposed to a good many strains, so care must be taken that the walls of the joint are of uniform thickness with the rest of the tube.  The beginner will find it easiest to make this tube out of two pieces of the same tube, about 1/4 inch in diameter. Larger or smaller tubing is usually more difficult. If tubing much more than 1/4 inch is used, the whole joint, including part of the main tube, must be heated nearly to the softening point at the close of the operation, and well annealed, as described in Chapter 1 (page 3) or it will be almost certain to crack. In the larger sizes of tube it will be necessary to heat the whole circumference of the main tube frequently during the operation, to prevent it from cracking.  In sealing a small tube on the side of a large one, it is usually advisable, after warming the spot where the joint is to be made, to attach a small drop of glass to the tube at that point, and direct the flame upon that, thus supplying at the same time both a definite point to be heated and an extra supply of glass for the little side tube which is desired. In this way it is also easier to blow out a side tube with a sufficiently small diameter. If the diameter of this tube should be much greater than that of the small tube, the latter may be enlarged with a carbon or a flanging tool.   EXERCISE NO. 4  TO JOIN TWO TUBES OF DIFFERENT DIAMETERS  In this case the first method (Exercise No. 1) is to be used whenever possible, as it gives a much smoother joint than the second method. The directions given will describe the adaptation of this method to the problem: if the second method must be used on account of awkward shape, etc., of the work, the modifications required will be obvious to any one who has learned to make the joint by the first method.  After sealing or corking one end of the larger tube, the other end is drawn out to form a tail as described on page 9, taking care to have the tube uniformly heated, and to draw the tail rapidly enough so that the cone is short, as indicated in _a_, Fig. 8. The tube is now rotated, a small flame directed against the cone at right angles to an element of it, and it is allowed to shrink a little, as indicated in _b_, Fig. 8, so that its walls will thicken. When the tail is cut off, at the dotted line, the diameter of the opening and the thickness of the walls at that point should correspond with the dimensions of the tube to be sealed on. As the glass is hot, the scratch for cutting it must be made with a file (moisten the edge!), and it often will not break square across. Before proceeding to seal on the small tube, any large projections on the cut end are best removed, by warming the cut surface a little, directing the small flame upon each projection in turn and touching it with a warm scrap of glass. It will adhere to this and may then be removed by rotating this scrap a little so as to wind up the projection on it, and then drawing it off, while the flame is still playing on the spot. This must be done rapidly and care taken not to soften the main part of the cone.  [Illustration: FIG. 8.--Joining two tubes of different diameters.]  The large tube is now taken in the left hand, the small one in the right, the ends heated and joined in the usual manner, taking care not to get any larger lump at the joint than necessary. A small flame is now directed on the cone at right angles to its elements as before, and the tube rotated so as to heat the whole circumference. The flame should be just large enough to heat the whole of the cone. As the latter shrinks, the lump at the joint is brought into the edge of the flame, and it and a very little of the small tube allowed to shrink with the cone.  When well shrunk and heated to blowing temperature the joint is removed from the flame and blown gently with careful rotation, pushing the tubes together a little when the blowing is about finished, so that the cone becomes a short thick half-bulb, as shown in _d_, Fig. 8. This corresponds to the first thick bulb in the first method (_d_, Fig. 6), and is treated similarly. It is again heated and shrunk, taking care not to involve either the large tube or the small one in the shrinking, blown quickly to about the same shape as before, (_d_, Fig. 8), and then gently drawn out into a smooth cone (_e_), exactly as in the first exercise. Care should be taken not to draw too rapidly or too far, as then the resulting cone (_f_) is weaker than it should be, and does not look well.  =Discussion.=--The beginner will find that this operation is best learned on two tubes which are not too nearly of the same diameter. A tube about 5/8 inch in diameter and one a little less than 1/4 inch will be suitable. Both should have moderately heavy walls (1/16 inch or a trifle over for the large tube, and a trifle less for the small one) but the large tube should not be too heavy or else it will be hard to prevent melting down too much of the small tube, and getting this drawn out too thin during the process. One of the troublesome features of this exercise is the difficulty of rotating two tubes of different diameters with the same angular velocity, so as not to twist the joint. Another difficulty is found in getting the cone uniformly heated to blowing temperature without overheating and overshrinking the small tube. The reason for this is obviously the much greater circumference of the cone, especially at its large end, so that relatively much less of it is being heated at any time. The beginner is also inclined to start with too long a cone, or else heat so much of the large tube that part of its glass is included in the cone, with the result that in order to get the right wall-thickness the cone must be made too long (_g_, Fig. 8). This does not look well, and usually will be irregular in shape.   EXERCISE NO. 5  TUBE FOR CONDENSING SULPHUR DIOXIDE  This is useful as a test of mastery of the preceding exercise. A piece of 3/16 or 7/32 inch tubing is joined to each end of a piece of tubing 5/8 by about 5 inches, and two constrictions made in the large tube, by the method described on page 10. The small tubes are then bent in the same plane, as shown, and their ends fire-polished (Fig. 9).  [Illustration: FIG. 9.--Tube for condensing sulphur dioxide.]   EXERCISE NO. 6  BULB AT THE END OF A TUBE  For this exercise tubing of 1/4 inch diameter and moderately strong walls is selected. A tail is drawn out on one end of the tube, and a piece of tubing about nine or ten inches long is cut off. The tail should be carefully drawn in the axis of the tube, and in the same straight line with it, as it is to be used as a handle in assembling the glass for the bulb. This tail must be long enough so that it can be conveniently held in the left hand, as described on page 13, and rotated about the same axis as the main tube. Holding the main tube in the right hand and the tail in the left, the tube is rotated in a large flame so that a piece of it, beginning where the tail stops and extending about an inch to the right, may be uniformly heated to the highest temperature at which it can be kept in shape. As soon as this temperature is reached, the tube is removed from the flame, continuing the rotation and taking care not to draw out the heated part, and gently blown. The rotation is carefully continued during the blowing, holding the tube in approximately a horizontal position. As soon as the tube has expanded a little the tail is pushed gently toward the main tube, continuing the"]]]
