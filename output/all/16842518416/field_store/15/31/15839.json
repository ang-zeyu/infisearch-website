KNOX JONES, JR.   Some of the Pleistocene mammals from San Josecito Cave, near Aramberri, Nuevo León, México, collected by field parties of the California Institute of Technology under the direction of the late Professor Chester Stock, have been reported previously (see Furlong, 1943; Cushing, 1945; Stock, 1950; Hooper, 1952; Findley, 1953; Stock, 1953; Handley, 1955; Jackway, 1958). In 1950, Professor Stock loaned a portion of the San Josecito material to the University of Kansas for identification. Included therein were 89 crania and rami of bats, representing three families (Phyllostomidae, Desmodontidae and Vespertilionidae) and five genera, each represented by a single species. One of the species is here described as new. Three of the kinds are known only from the Pleistocene and two are Recent species.  The only previous mention of fossil bats from México known to me concerns material from San Josecito Cave. Cushing (1945:182) mentioned a \"vampire bat\" from the cave (see also Maldonado-Koerdell, 1948:17), and Handley (1955:48) based his description of _Corynorhinus tetralophodon_ on a specimen from San Josecito.  Brief descriptions of the cave have been published by Miller (1943) and Stock (1943). The precise age of the deposits is unknown; stratification data did not accompany the material sent on loan to the University of Kansas. However, most of the micro-fauna is thought to have come from the higher levels in the cave and is probably late Pleistocene.  The San Josecito Cave collections are currently the property of the Los Angeles County Museum.  I am grateful to Dr. E. Raymond Hall for permission to study the bats from San Josecito Cave, to Dr. Robert W. Wilson for criticism of the manuscript, and to Mr. Philip Hershkovitz for permission to use comparative material at the Chicago Natural History Museum. Lucy Rempel made the drawings from photographs by John M. Legler.   _Leptonycteris nivalis_ (Saussure)       _Referred material._--Seventy crania, LACM (CIT) 2951-54,      2956-64, 3114-22, 3124-25, 3127, 3131-35, 3137-41, 3143-55,      3942, 21 unnumbered, of which 35 are nearly complete,      lacking zygomatic arches, auditory bullae and some teeth;      three rami, one right, LACM (CIT) 3126, and two left,      unnumbered.  _Remarks._--The long-nosed bats from San Josecito Cave do not differ appreciably from _Leptonycteris nivalis longala_ Stains, the largest Recent subspecies of the species, and the subspecies that occurs in the same geographic area today. Average and extremes of three cranial measurements of 22 specimens from San Josecito Cave, followed in parentheses by the average and extreme measurements of 23 adult _L. n. longala_ from the type locality, 12 mi. S and 2 mi. E Arteaga, 7500 ft., Coahuila (after Stains, 1957: 356), are: Greatest length of skull, 28.2, 27.2-28.9 (27.5, 26.1-29.0); least interorbital constriction, 5.0, 4.8-5.4 (4.8, 4.1-5.4); breadth of braincase, 11.1, 10.6-11.6 (10.7, 10.1-11.2). The San Josecito specimens average larger than the series of Recent specimens in all of these measurements, especially breadth of braincase, but there is considerable overlap in each case and the extremes of greatest length of skull and of least interorbital constriction do not exceed the extremes in the Recent series.   _Desmodus stocki_, new species       _Holotype._--Cranium, lacking post-incisor dentition on the      left side, zygomatic arches and auditory bullae; Los Angeles      County Museum (CIT) No. 3129; from Pleistocene deposits of      San Josecito Cave, near Aramberri, Nuevo León, México.       _Referred material._--Twelve additional partial crania, LACM      (CIT) 2946-50, 3127-30, 3940-41, 2 unnumbered.       _Diagnosis._--Resembling the Recent _Desmodus rotundus_ but      differing from it as follows: Skull larger (see measurements      and Figs. 1-2), heavier and more massive; rostrum and      braincase relatively as well as actually broader,      interorbital region relatively more constricted; braincase      more rounded (less elongate) as viewed from above; nasals      less concave in lateral view; narial vacuity broader in      relation to greatest length of skull, more nearly      heart-shaped; palate broad, less concave medially;      mesopterygoid fossa relatively and actually broader      anteriorly, the sides nearly parallel; zygomatic arches      (judging from No. 2950, the only specimen with a complete      arch, the left) less rounded in outline, appearing broader      owing to the more constricted interorbital region.       Dentition larger and heavier than that in _rotundus_, but      otherwise differing only slightly from it; upper incisor      less concave on cutting surface (see Figs. 3-4); premolar      and molar slightly less bladelike, with heavier roots.       The peculiar shape of the incisor of _stocki_ is shared to      some extent with Diaemus youngi, a Recent South American      desmodontid. However, _stocki_ does not otherwise resemble      _D. youngi_, differing from it as follows: Skull larger and      heavier; interorbital constriction much narrower; zygomatic      arches less strongly bowed; skull less compact, more      elongate; braincase and rostrum relatively much narrower in      relation to greatest length of skull. Furthermore, specimens      of stocki show no trace of the minute M2 attributed to      _youngi_ by de la Torre (Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 69:      191, 1956). For cranial measurements of _youngi_ see Sanborn      (Jour. Mamm., 30: 283, 1949).  [Illustration: FIGS. 1-4. Fig. 1. Dorsal view of holotype of _Desmodus stocki_, × 1-1/2. Fig. 2.

N Jaumave, Tamaulipas, × 2-1/2.]  _Remarks._--The essential differences between _D. stocki_ and _D. rotundus_ are in size and proportion. I do not doubt that the two species are closely related; possibly _stocki_ is ancestral to _rotundus_.  The species is named in honor of the late Professor Chester Stock, under whose direction the fossil materials from San Josecito Cave were obtained, and who, at the time of his death, was studying the mammalian fauna from the cave.   _Eptesicus cf. grandis_ (Brown)       _Referred material._--One rostrum, with P4-M3 on the right      side and P4 only on the left, LACM (CIT) 2990.  _Remarks._--This specimen is referred provisionally to _E. grandis_. The dentition is larger and heavier, and the ridges and depressions on the dorsal surface of the rostrum are more pronounced than in Recent _E. fuscus_. The P4-M3 length is 6.1 (approximately 6.1 in the holotype of _grandis_, less in _fuscus_); least interorbital constriction, 4.2 (4.3 in the holotype of _grandis_, more in _fuscus_); breadth of rostrum between infraorbital canals, 6.4; breadth across P4, 7.3.

Gidley and Gazin (1938:11) considered it a distinct species. Whether _grandis_ is only a subspecies of _E. fuscus_ or a separate species, _grandis_ is closely related to _fuscus_, and probably is ancestral to it.   _Lasiurus cinereus_ (Palisot de Beauvois)       _Referred material_.--One cranium, lacking basioccipital,      tympanic and mastoid regions, and most of the dentition,      having only M3 on the right side and M2-M3 on the left, LACM      (CIT) 3160.  _Remarks._--The cranium of No. 3160 is inseparable from those of 10 spring-taken specimens of _L. c. cinereus_ from the San Gabriel Mts., Los Angeles Co., California (KU 49727, 49729-37). Measurements of No. 3160, followed by the average and extremes (in parentheses) of the Californian series, are: Condylobasal length, 16.1, 16.5 (15.9-17.2); zygomatic breadth, 12.3, 12.4 (12.0-12.7); least interorbital constriction, 5.2, 5.4 (5.2-5.6); breadth of braincase, 8.7, 9.0 (8.5-9.3); length of palate not including terminal spine, 5.1, 5.3 (4.8-5.9). The teeth of the San Josecito specimen are comparatively unworn. A label with the skull bears the notation \"talus\" in parentheses, which, in so far as I am able to determine, indicates surface talus inside the cave. Therefore, the specimen in question may be of Recent origin.  It is perhaps worthy of note that Lasiurus cinereus is primarily a tree-dwelling bat, although a few Recent specimens have been reported from caves (see Beer, 1954:116).   _Corynorhinus tetralophodon_ Handley  A single cranium of a _Corynorhinus_ LACM (CIT) 2989 was included in the original materials sent to Kansas by Professor Stock. Subsequently, this specimen was loaned to Charles O. Handley, Jr., who described it as a new species, _C. tetralophodon_. The latter is said to differ from all other plecotine bats by the retention of a well-developed fourth commissure (ridge extending posteroexternally from metacone) on the M3 (Handley, 1955:48).
