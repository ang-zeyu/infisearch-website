PEACE                          THE OUTBREAK OF PEACE                                By H. B. FYFE                         Illustrated by van Dongen           _When properly conducted, a diplomatic mission can turn the          most smashing of battle-successes into a fabulous Pyrrhic          victory._         *       *       *       *       *     It was a great pity, Space Marshal Wilbur Hennings reflected, as he gazed through the one-way glass of the balcony door, that the local citizens had insisted upon decorating the square before their capitol with the hulk of the first spaceship ever to have landed on Pollux V.  A hundred and fifty years probably seemed impressive to them, amid the explosive spread of Terran colonies and federations. Actually, in the marshal's opinion, it was merely long enough to reveal such symbols as more than antiquated but less than historically precious.  \"I presume you plan to have me march past that heap!\" he complained, tugging at the extremely \"historical\" sword that completed the effect of his dazzling white and gold uniform.  Commodore Miller, his aide, stiffened nervously.  \"Around to the right of it, sir,\" he gestured. \"As you see, the local military are already keeping the route clear of onlookers. We thought it would be most impressive if your party were to descend the outer stairway from the palace balcony here ... to heighten the importance of--\"  \"To draw out the pomp and circumstance of opening the conference?\"  \"Well, sir ... and then across the square to the conference hall of the capitol, outside which you will pause for a few gracious words to the crowd--\"  \"And that will probably be my last opportunity to enjoy the morning sunlight. Oh, well, it seems much too bright here in any case.\"  The commodore absently reached out to adjust a fold of his chief's sky-blue sash, and the marshal as absently parried the gesture.  \"I shall be hardly less than half an hour crossing the square,\" he predicted sourly. \"With the cheering throngs they have undoubtedly arranged, and the sunlight reflecting from all that imitation marble, it will be no place to collect one's thoughts.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He turned back to the huge chamber constituting the \"office\" of the suite supplied by his Polluxian hosts. The skeleton staff of men and women remaining occupied chairs and benches along only one wall, since the bulk of the delegation had been sent out to make themselves popular with the local populace.  Hennings presumed the bulk of the local populace to consist of Polluxians assigned to making themselves popular with his Ursan Federation delegation. His people would be listening politely to myriad reasons why the Polluxians had a natural right to occupy all the star systems from here to Castor, a dozen light-years farther from Terra. No one would mention the true motive--their illogical choice in naming themselves the Twin Empire.  \"Well, now!\" he said crisply. \"Once more over the main points of the situation! No, commodore, not the schedule of experts that will accompany me to the table; I rely upon you to have perfected that. But have there been any unforeseen developments in the actual fighting?\"  A cluster of aides, mostly in uniform but including a few in discreetly elegant civilian attire, moved forward. Each was somehow followed within arm's reach by an aide of his own, so that the advance presented overtones of a small sortie.  Hennings first nodded to the first, a youngish man whose air suggested technical competence more than the assurance of great authority. The officer placed his brief case upon the glistening surface of a large table and touched a switch on the flap.  \"It's as well to be sure, sir,\" the commodore approved. \"Our men have been unable to detect any devices, but the walls may have ears.\"  \"They won't scan through this scrambler, sir,\" asserted the young officer.  Hennings accepted a seat at the table and looked up to one of the others.  \"Mirelli's Star,\" an older officer reported briskly. \"The same situation prevails, with both sides having landed surface troops in force on Mirelli II, Mirelli III, and Mirelli V, the fourth planet being inhabited by a partly civilized, nonhuman race protected under the Terran Convention.\"  \"Recent engagements?\"  \"No, sir. Maneuvering continues, but actual encounters have declined in frequency. Casualties are modest and evenly matched. General Nilssen on Mirelli III continues to receive Polluxian agents seeking his defection.\"  \"I never thought to ask,\" murmured Hennings. \"Is he really a distant connection of the Polluxian Nilssen family?\"  \"It is improbable, sir, but they are polite enough to accept the pretense. Of course, he rejects every offer in a very high-minded manner, and seems to be making an adequate impression of chivalry.\"  He stepped back at Henning's nod, to be replaced by another officer.  \"One minor space skirmish in the Agohki system to report, sir. The admiral in command appears to have recouped after the error of two days ago, when that Polluxian detachment was so badly mauled. He arranged the capture of three of our cruisers.\"  \"Was that not a trifle rash?\" demanded Hennings.  \"Intelligence is inclined to think not, sir. The ships were armed only with weapons listed as general knowledge items. The crews were not only trained in prisoner-of-war tactics, but also well supplied with small luxuries. The Polluxian fleet in that system is known to have been in space for several months, so a friendly effect is anticipated.\"  Hennings considered the condensed report proffered for his perusal. He noted that the Polluxians had been quite gentlemanly about notifying Ursan headquarters of the capture and of the complete lack of casualties. He also saw that while the message was ostensibly directed to the Federation flagship, it had been beamed in such fashion as to be conveniently intercepted at the secret Ursan Federation headquarters on Agohki VII.  \"That was a bit rude of them,\" he commented. \"We have never dragged their secrets into the open.\"  \"On the other hand, sir,\" the commodore suggested, \"it may be an almost sophisticated method of permitting us to enjoy our superior finesse.\"  \"I am just as pleased to have the reminder,\" said Hennings. \"It will serve to alert us all the more when we sit down with them over there.\"  An elegant civilian, a large man with patient, drooping features, stated that nothing had occurred to change the economic situation. Another reported that unofficial channels of information were holding up as well as could be expected. A uniformed officer summarized the battle situation in two more star systems.  \"Those are positions we actually desire to hold, are they not?\" Hennings asked. \"Is action to be taken there?\"  \"Plans call for local civilian riots at the height of the conference, sir.\"  \"But ... can we lay no groundwork sooner than that? Sometime in the foreseeable future, at least! Take it up with Propaganda, Blauvelt! It seems to me that the briefing mentioned an indigenous race on one of these planets--\"  Blauvelt dropped his eyes momentarily, equivalent in that gathering to a blush of intense embarrassment. Hennings coughed apologetically.  \"Well, now, I should not pry into arrangements I must later be able to deny convincingly with a clear conscience. I can only plead, my dear Blauvelt, the tenseness of the past several days.\"  The officer murmured inaudibly, fumbled with his papers, and edged to the rear rank. Someone, at Commodore Miller's fluttering, obtained a vacuum jug of ice water and a glass for the marshal, but Hennings chose instead to produce a long cigar from a pocket concealed beneath his resplendent collection of medals.  \"My apologies to all of you,\" he said thoughtfully. \"I fear that any of you who may expect contact with the local population had better see Dr. Ibn Talal about the hypnosis necessary to counteract my little indiscretion. And now--what remains?\"  \"Nothing but the prisoner exchange, sir,\" Commodore Miller announced after collecting the eyes of the principal officers.  Hennings got his cigar going. He listened to confirmation of a previous report that a massive exchange of \"sick and wounded\" prisoners had been accomplished, and learned that the Ursans now suspected that they had accepted unknowingly about as many secret agents as they had sent the Polluxians.  \"Oh, well!\" he sighed. \"As long as the amenities were preserved! We must be as friendly as possible about that sort of thing, or run the risk of antagonizing them.\"  Seeing that the commodore was tense with impatience, the marshal rose to his feet. An aide deftly received the cigar for disposal, and the party drifted expectantly toward the balcony doors.  From among that part of the staff which would remain to man headquarters, an officer was dispatched to alert the Polluxian honor guard.         *       *       *       *       *  _One more touch before the die is cast_, thought the marshal, as two young officers opened the balcony doors to admit the blare of trumpets.  Cheers rolled successively across the square, rising like distant waves from somewhere beneath the gigantic banner that draped the capitol opposite with fiery letters spelling out \"PEACE CONFERENCE.\"  With a dramatic gesture, Hennings held up the sheaf of reports they had just reviewed. Smiles disappeared in response to his own serious mien.  \"So much for the hostilities!\" he snapped. He tossed the reports to the officer who would remain in charge. \"_Now for the actual war!_\"  Pivoting on his heel, he led them smartly out to the ornate balcony stairway that curved down into the sea of cheering Polluxians.

SATELLITE                                  SYSTEM                               By H. B. FYFE            _Fyfe's quite right ... there's nothing like a satellite           system for a cold storage arrangement. Keeps things handy,           but out of the way...._                          Illustrated by Summers         *       *       *       *       *     Having released the netting of his bunk, George Tremont floated himself out. He ran his tongue around his mouth and grimaced.  \"Wonder how long I slept ... feels like too long,\" he muttered. \"Well, they would have called me.\"  The \"cabin\" was a ninety-degree wedge of a cylinder hardly eight feet high. From one end of its outer arc across to the other was just over ten feet, so that it had been necessary to bevel two corners of the hinged, three-by-seven bunk to clear the sides of the wedge. Lockers flattened the arc behind the bunk.  Tremont maneuvered himself into a vertical position in the eighteen inches between the bunk and a flat surface that cut off the point of the wedge. He stretched out an arm to remove towel and razor from one of the lockers, then carefully folded the bunk upward and hooked it securely in place.  With room to turn now, he swung around and slid open a double door in the flat surface, revealing a shaft three feet square whose center was also the theoretical intersection of his cabin walls. Tremont pulled himself into the shaft. From \"up\" forward, light leaked through a partly open hatch, and he could hear a murmur of voices as he jackknifed in the opposite direction.  \"At least two of them are up there,\" he grunted.  He wondered which of the other three cabins was occupied, meanwhile pulling himself along by the ladder rungs welded to one corner of the shaft. He reached a slightly wider section aft, which boasted entrances to two air locks, a spacesuit locker, a galley, and a head. He entered the last, noting the murmur of air-conditioning machinery on the other side of the bulkhead.  Tremont hooked a foot under a toehold to maintain his position facing a mirror. He plugged in his razor, turned on the exhauster in the slot below the mirror to keep the clippings out of his eyes, and began to shave. As the beard disappeared, he considered the deals he had come to Centauri to put through.  \"A funny business!\" he told his image. \"Dealing in ideas! Can you really sell a man's thoughts?\"  Beginning to work around his chin, he decided that it actually was practical. Ideas, in fact, were almost the only kind of import worth bringing from Sol to Alpha Centauri. Large-scale shipments of necessities were handled by the Federated Governments. To carry even precious or power metals to Earth or to return with any type of manufactured luxury was simply too expensive in money, fuel, effort, and time.  On the other hand, traveling back every five years to buy up plans and licenses for the latest inventions or processes--_that_ was profitable enough to provide a good living for many a man in Tremont's business. All he needed were a number of reliable contacts and a good knowledge of the needs of the three planets and four satellites colonized in the Centaurian system.  Only three days earlier, Tremont had returned from his most recent trip to the old star, landing from the great interstellar ship on the outer moon of Centauri VII. There he leased this small rocket--the _Annabel_, registered more officially as the AC7-4-525--for his local traveling. It would be another five days before he reached the inhabited moons of Centauri VI.  He stopped next in the galley for a quick breakfast out of tubes, regretting the greater convenience of the starship, then returned the towel and razor to his cabin. He decided that his slightly rumpled shirt and slacks of utilitarian gray would do for another day. About thirty-eight, an inch or two less than six feet and muscularly slim, Tremont had an air of habitual neatness. His dark hair, thinning at the temples, was clipped short and brushed straight back. There were smile wrinkles at the corners of his blue eyes and grooving his lean cheeks.  He closed the cabin doors and pulled himself forward to enter the control room through the partly open hatch. The forward bulkhead offered no more head room than did his own cabin, but there seemed to be more breathing space because this chamber was not quartered. Deck space, however, was at such a premium because of the controls, acceleration couches, and astrogating equipment that the hatch was the largest clear area.  Two men and a girl turned startled eyes upon Tremont as he rose into their view. One of the men, about forty-five but sporting a youngish manner to match his blond crewcut and tanned features, glanced quickly at his wrist watch.  \"Am I too early?\" demanded Tremont with sudden coldness. \"What are you doing with my case there?\"  The girl, in her early twenties and carefully pretty with her long black hair neatly netted for space, snatched back a small hand from the steel strongbox that was shaped to fit into an attaché case. The second man, under thirty but thick-waisted in a gray tee-shirt, said in the next breath, \"Take him!\"  Too late, Tremont saw that the speaker had already braced a foot against the far bulkhead. Then the broad face with its crooked blob of a nose above a ridiculous little mustache shot across the chamber at him. Desperately, Tremont groped for a hold that would help him either to avoid the charge or to pull himself back into the shaft, but he was caught half in and half out.  He met the rush with a fist, but the tangle of bodies immediately became confusing beyond belief as the other pair joined in.  Something cracked across the back of his head, much too hard to have been accidental.  When Tremont began to function again, it took him only a few seconds to realize that life had been going on without him for some little time.  For one thing, the heavy man's nosebleed had stopped, and he was tenderly combing blood from his mustache with a fingertip.  For another, they had managed to stuff Tremont into a spacesuit and haul him down the shaft to the air lock. Someone had noosed the thumbs of the gauntlets together and tied the cord to the harness supporting the air tanks.  Tremont twisted his head around to eye the three of them without speaking. He was trying to decide where he had made his mistake.  Bill Braigh, the elderly youth with the crewcut? Ralph Peters, the pilot who had come with the ship? Dorothy Stauber, the trim brunette who had made the trip from Earth on the same starship as Tremont? He could not make up his mind without more to go on.  Then he remembered with a sinking sensation that _all_ of them had been clustered about his case of papers and microfilms when he had interrupted them.  \"I trust you aren't thinking of making us any trouble, Tremont,\" drawled Braigh. \"Give up the idea; you've been no trouble at all.\"  \"Where do you think this is getting you?\" demanded Tremont.  Braigh chuckled.  \"Wherever it would have gotten you,\" he said. \"Only at less expense.\"  \"Ask him for the combination,\" growled Peters.  Braigh scrutinized Tremont's expression.  \"It would probably take us a while, Ralph,\" he decided regretfully. \"It's simpler to put him outside now and be free to use tools on the box.\"  Tremont opened his mouth to protest, but Braigh clapped the helmet over his head and screwed it fast.  \"You'll never read the code!\" yelled Tremont, struggling to break free. \"Those papers are no good to you without me!\"  Someone slammed him against the bulkhead and held him there with his face to it. He could do nothing with his hands, joined as they were, and very little with his feet. It dawned upon him that they could not hear a word, and he fell silent. Twisting his head to peer out the side curve of his vision band, he caught a glimpse of Peters suiting up.  A few minutes later, they opened the inner hatch of the air lock and shoved Tremont inside. Peters followed, gripping him firmly about the knees from behind.  \"Here we go!\" grunted Peters, and Tremont realized that he could communicate again, over their suit radios.  \"You won't get far, trying to read the code I have those papers written in,\" he warned. \"You'd better talk this over before you make a mistake.\"  \"Ain't no mistake about it,\" said Peters, pressing toward the outer hatch. \"So you chartered the rocket. You felt you oughta go out to see about a heavy dust particle hitting the hull. You fell off an' we never found you.\"  \"How will you explain not going yourself? Or not finding me by instruments?\"  Peters clubbed Tremont's foot from the tank rack he had hooked with the toe.  \"How could I go? Leave the ship without a pilot? An' the screens are for pickin' up meteorites far enough out to mean somethin' at the speeds they travel. So you were too close to register, leastways till it was way too late. You must have suffocated when your air ran out.\"  Tremont scrabbled about with his feet for some kind of hold. The outer hatch began to open. He could see stars out there.  \"Wait!\" shouted Tremont.  It was too late. He felt himself shoot forward as if Peters had thrust a foot into the small of his back and shoved. Tremont tried to grab at the edge of the air lock, but it was gone. A puff of air frosted about him, its human bullet.         *       *       *       *       *  The stars spun slowly before his eyes. After a moment, the gleaming hull of the _Annabel_ swam into his field of view. It was already thirty feet away and the air lock was closing. He caught a glimpse of a spacesuited figure with the light behind it.  Then he was looking at the stars again.  The small, distant brilliance of Alpha Centauri made him squint in the split second before "]]]
