Instead of Madeira wine any other kind may be used.  158. +Rhine Wine Jelly.+-- Dissolve and clarify 2 ounces gelatine and dissolve 1 pound sugar in 1 pint water; add the rind of 2 lemons and the juice of 1; let it stand 1 hour; then strain through a napkin; let the juice of 2 lemons run through filtering paper, add it with 1 pint Rhine wine and the sugar syrup to the clarified gelatine, fill the jelly in a form and set it on ice or in a cool place.  159. +Champagne Jelly.+-- Dissolve and clarify 2 ounces gelatine (see Gelatine), dissolve ¾ pound sugar in 1 pint cold water, strain it through a napkin, add to the gelatine with ½ bottle champagne and the filtered juice of 4 lemons, fill into a form and set it in a cool place or on ice.  160. +Apple Jelly.+-- Grate 1 quart tart apples, put them in a bag and press out the juice, add the juice of 1 orange and let both run through a filtering paper; clarify 2 ounces gelatine, dissolve ¾ pound sugar in 1 pint cold water, strain through a napkin and add it with the apple juice to the clarified gelatine; rinse a mould with cold water, pour in the jelly and set it in a cool place or on ice till firm. Another way is:--Pare, core and quarter some tart apples and boil them in sugar syrup to which the juice of 1 lemon has been added; when the apples are done remove carefully, so as not to break them, lay on a sieve to drain and when cold lay into the mould alternately with the jelly and finish like Orange Jelly.  161. +Cider Jelly.+-- Soak 2 ounces gelatine in ½ pint cold water for 15 minutes; then add ½ pint boiling water, put it over the fire and stir till gelatine is dissolved; add the juice of 1 lemon and the beaten whites of 2 eggs; stir with an egg beater until it boils; then draw to side of stove and let it stand 5 minutes; then strain through a flannel jelly bag; dissolve ¾ pound sugar in 1 quart sweet cider, strain through a jelly bag and add it to the gelatine; pour it into a jelly mould and set in a cool place until firm.  162. +Rose Jelly.+-- Put 1 quart of freshly gathered rose leaves in a glass jar, squeeze the juice of 1 lemon over them, pour over the whole 1 cup boiling water, close the jar tightly and set aside till next day; then press out the juice (by putting the rose leaves in a coarse bag), let the liquid run through filtering paper (see Clarifying Fruit Juice), add 1 pint cold clarified sugar syrup, ½ pint white wine and 2 ounces clarified gelatine; next pour the jelly into a mould and set aside to cool.  163. +Gelée Russe.+-- Clarify 1 ounce gelatine and dissolve ½ pound sugar in ½ pint water; add the grated peel of 2 lemons; let it stand 15 minutes; then strain through a napkin; let ½ pint lemon juice run through filtering paper; mix the clarified gelatine, sugar syrup and lemon juice together; put it in a deep kettle, set into cracked ice and whip the contents until it foams and begins to thicken; then fill it into a form and cover and pack with cracked ice till firm, which will take about 2 hours. Orange and Wine Jelly may be made in the same manner.  164. +Macédoine de Fruit à la Russe.+-- Prepare a Rhine Wine Jelly, set a form into cracked ice, pour in a few spoonfuls jelly and let it get hard; lay over it a layer of fruit, such as strawberries, slices of pineapple or peaches, and pour over sufficient jelly to cover the fruit; put the remaining jelly into a deep kettle, set into cracked ice and beat with an egg beater till it foams and begins to thicken; then mix with 3 or 4 different kinds of fruit, either fresh or preserved, fill into the jelly form, cover closely and let it stand 2 hours; when ready to serve dip the form in hot water, wipe it dry, remove the cover, turn the jelly onto a dish and garnish with sugared fruit.  165. +Calvesfoot Jelly.+-- Choose 4 calves’ feet with the skin on (if without the skin 6 must be taken), crack and wash them well, put over the fire, cover with cold water and boil till they fall apart; strain the liquor through a fine sieve and let it stand in a cool place; next day skim off every particle of fat and remove the sediment; put the jelly over the fire and reduce it down to 2 quarts by boiling; beat up the whites of 4 eggs, add a little cold water, the juice of 2 lemons and the thin peel of one, 6 cloves and a piece of cinnamon; add this to the contents of saucepan, stirring constantly; boil for a few minutes; then move the saucepan to side of stove and let it stand for 5 minutes without boiling; then strain it through a double flannel bag; dissolve 2 cups sugar in 1 pint sherry or Madeira wine, strain through a napkin and add it to the strained jelly; rinse out the moulds with cold water, put in the jelly and set in a cool place. This jelly may be put into tightly corked bottles, and will keep for a long time. When wanted for use set the bottle in hot water until the jelly melts; then pour it into moulds and set in a cool place till firm.  166. +Macédoine de Fruits au vin du Rhine.+-- Prepare a Rhine wine jelly a little stiffer than the ordinary jellies; take large, ripe raspberries, strawberries, currants, peaches (pared and cut into eighths) and pineapples cut into small slices; put them in a dish on ice; next set a form into cracked ice, pour in a few spoonfuls jelly and when hard lay in some of the fruit, either each kind by itself in small clusters or mixed one with the other; pour over this sufficient jelly to cover the fruit; let it get hard and again lay over some fruit; continue alternately with fruit and jelly till form is full; cover and let it remain in ice till firm; in serving dip the form into hot water, wipe it dry and turn the macédoine onto a round dish.

These baskets may also be filled with Gelée Russe.  169. +Orange Quarters Used for Garnishing Jellies and Other Dishes.+-- Take 6 large oranges, cut out a round piece on the side of stem and hollow out so that nothing is left but the outside skin; care must be taken to leave none of the white coating on the inside of skin; after preparing this way put them in a saucepan over the fire with boiling water and boil 5 minutes; rinse with cold water, wipe them dry and fill each one either with clear jelly of different colors or blanc-mange; set them on ice until hard; cut them into quarters and use for garnishing different dishes.
