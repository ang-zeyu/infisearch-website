He would have asked his darling's woe,--   But the harp, again, the minstrel took;   And with such prelude as awoke     Regretful thoughts of an ancient foe   In Thorold's soul,--the minstrel stranger--   In spite of fear, in spite of danger,--   In measures sweet and soft, but quaint,--   Responded thus to Edith's plaint:--   The Minstrel's Response.    What meant that glancing of thine eye,   That softly hushed, yet struggling sigh?     Hast thou a thought of woe or weal,     Which, breathed, my bosom would not feel?     Why should'st thou, then, that thought conceal,   Or hide it from my mind, Love?    Did'st thou e'er breathe a sigh to me,   And I not breathe as deep to thee?     Or hast thou whispered in mine ear     A word of sorrow or of fear,--     Or have I seen thee shed a tear,--   And looked a thought unkind, Love?    Did e'er a gleam of Love's sweet ray   Across thy beaming countenance play,--     Or joy its seriousness beguile,     And o'er it cast a radiant smile,--     And mine with kindred joy, the while,   Not glow as bright as thine, Love?    Why would'st thou, then, that something seek   To hide within thy breast,--nor speak,     Its load of doubt, of grief, or fear,     Of joy, or sorrow, to mine ear,--     Assured this heart would gladly bear   A burthen borne by thine, Love?      *       *       *       *       *    Sir Wilfrid sat in thoughtful mood,     When the youthful minstrel's song was ended;   While Edith by her loved sire stood,     And o'er his chair in sadness bended.   The guests were silent;--for the chaunt,   Where all, of late, were jubilant,   Had kindled quick imagining   Who he might be that thus dared sing--   Breathing of deep and fervent feeling--   His tender passion half-revealing.    Soon, sportive sounds the silence broke:       Saint Leonard's lay-brother,       Who seldom could smother   Conception of mischief, or thought of a joke,   Drew forth his old rebeck from under his cloak,--       And touching the chords       To brain-sick words,--   While he mimicked a lover's phantasy,   Upward rolling his lustrous eye,--       With warblings wild       He flourished and trilled,--   Till mother and maiden aloud 'gan to laugh,   And clown challenged clown more good liquor to quaff.    These freakish rhymes, in freakish measure,   He chaunted, for his wayward pleasure.   The Lay-Brother's Love Song.    The lilies are fair, down by the green grove,     Where the brooklet glides through the dell;   But I view not a lily so fair, while I rove,     As the maid whose name I could tell.    The roses are sweet that blush in the vale,     Where the thorn-bush grows by the well;   But they breathe not a perfume so sweet on the gale     As the maid whose name I could tell.    The lark singeth sweetly up in the sky,--     Over song-birds bearing the bell;   But one bird may for music the skylark defy,--     'Tis the maid whose name I could tell.    The angels all brightly glitter and glow,     In the regions high where they dwell;   But they beam not so bright as one angel below,--     'Tis the maid whose name I could tell.      *       *       *       *       *    Sport may, a while, defy heart-cares,     And woo faint smiles from pain;   Jesting, a while, may keep down tears--     But they will rise, again!    And saddening thoughts of others' care,   Unwelcome, though they be, to share,--   And though self-love would coldly say   \"Let me laugh on, while others bear   Their own grief-fardels as they may!\"--   Yet, while in sadness droops a brother,   No brother-heart can sadness smother:   The tear of fellowship will start--   The tongue seek comfort to impart.    And English hearts, of old, were dull   To quell their yearnings pitiful:--   The guests forgot the jester's strain,   To think upon the harp again,   And of the youth who, to its swell,   So late, his sighs did syllable.    Natheless, no guest was skilled to find,   At once, fit words that might proclaim,--   For one who seemed without a name,--   Their sympathy;--and so, with kind   Intent, they urged some roundelay   The stranger minstrel would essay.    He struck the harp, forthwith, but sung   Of passion still,--and still it clung   To Love--his full, melodious tongue!   The Minstrel's Avowal.    O yes! I hold thee in my heart;   Nor shall thy cherished form depart   From its loved home: though sad I be,--   My heart, my Love, still cleaves to thee!    My dawn of life is dimmed and dark;   Hope's flame is dwindled to a spark;   But, though I live thus dyingly,--   My heart, my Love, still cleaves to thee!    Though short my summer's day hath been,   And now the winter's eve is keen,--   Yet, while the storm descends on me,--   My heart, my Love, still cleaves to thee!    No look of love upon me beams,--   No tear of pity for me streams:--   A thing forlorn--despairingly--   My heart, my Love, still cleaves to thee!    Thine eye would pity wert thou free   To soothe my woe; and though I be   Condemned to helpless misery,   My heart, my Love, still cleaves to thee!      *       *       *       *       *    The maidens wept--the clowns looked glum--   Each rustic reveller was dumb:   Sir Wilfrid struggled hard to hide   Revengeful throes and ireful pride,   That, now, his wounded bosom swelled,--   For in that youth he had beheld   An image which had overcast   His life with sorrow in the Past:--   He struggled,--and besought the youth   To leave his strains of woe and ruth   For some light lay, or merry rhyme,   More fitting Yule's rejoicing time.--   And, though it cost him dear, the while,   He eyed the minstrel with a smile.    The stranger waited not to note   The Baron's speech: like one distraught   He struck the harp--a wild farewell   Thus breathing to its deepest swell:--   The Minstrel's Farewell.    Oh! smile not upon me--my heart is not smiling:   Too long it hath mourned, 'neath reproach and reviling:   Thy smile is a false one: it never can bless me:   It doth not relieve,--but more deeply distress me!    I care not for beauty; I care not for riches:   I am not the slave whom their tinsel bewitches:     A bosom I seek       That is true, like mine own,--     Though pale be the cheek,       And its roses all flown,--   And the wearer be desolate, wretched, forlorn,--   And alike from each soul-soothing solace be torn.    That heart I would choose, which is stricken and slighted;   Whose joys are all fled, and whose hopes are all blighted;     For that heart alone       Would in sympathy thrill     With one like my own       That sorrow doth fill;--   With a heart whose fond breathings have ever been spurned,--   And hath long their rejection in solitude mourned.    The harp of my heart is unstrung; and to gladness   Respond not its chords--but to sorrow and sadness:--   Then speak not of mirth which my soul hath forsaken!   Why would ye my heart-breaking sorrows awaken?      *       *       *       *       *    It is the shriek of deathful danger!   None heed the heart-plaint of the stranger!   All start aghast, with deadly fear,   While they, again, that wild shriek hear!    \"He drowns--Sir Wilfrid!\" cries a hind:     \"The ferryman is weak:   He cannot stem the stream and wind:     Help, help! for Jesu's sake!\"    \"Help one,--help all!\" the Baron cries;     \"Whatever boon he craves,   I swear, by Christ, that man shall win,     My ferryman who saves!\"--    Out rush the guests: but one was forth     Who heard no word of boon:   His manly heart to deeds of worth     Needed no clarion.    He dashed into the surging Trent--     Nor feared the hurricane;   And, ere the breath of life was spent,     He seized the drowning man.--    \"What is thy boon?\" said Torksey's lord,--     But his cheek was deadly pale;   \"Tell forth thy heart,--and to keep his word     De Thorold will not fail.\"--    \"I rushed to save my brother-man,     And not to win thy boon:   My just desert had been Heaven's ban--     If thus I had not done!\"--    Thus spake the minstrel, when the hall     The Baron's guests had gained:   And, now, De Thorold's noble soul     Spoke out, all unrestrained.    \"Then for thy own heart's nobleness     Tell forth thy boon,\" he said;   \"Before thou tell'st thy thought, I guess     What wish doth it pervade.\"--    \"Sweet Edith, his true, plighted love,     Romara asks of thee!   What though my kindred with thee strove,     And wrought thee misery?    \"Our Lord, for whom we keep this day,     When nailed upon the tree;   Did he foredoom his foes, or pray     That they might pardoned be?\"--    \"Son of my ancient foe!\" replied     The Baron to the youth,--   I glad me that my ireful pride     Already bows to truth:    \"Deep zeal to save our brother-man--     Generous self-sacrifice   For other's weal--is nobler than     All blood-stained victories!    \"Take thy fair boon!--for thou hast spoiled     Death,--greedy Death--of prey--   This poor man who for me hath toiled     Full many a stormy day!    \"I feel--to quell the heart's bad flame,     And bless an enemy,   Is richer than all earthly fame--     Though the world should be its fee!    \"My sire was by thy kinsman slain;--     Yet, as thy tale hath told,   Thy kinsman's usurping act was vain--     He died in the dungeon cold.    \"Perish the memory of feud,     And deeds of savage strife!

The remains of this ancient erection (of which a representation is given in the accompanying vignette) form an interesting antiquarian object beside the Trent, twelve miles from Lincoln, and seven from Gainsborough. The entire absence of any authentic record, as to the date of the foundation, or its former possessors, leaves the imagination at full liberty to clothe it with poetic legend. Visits made to it, in my childhood, and the hearing of wild narratives respecting the treasures buried beneath its ruins, and the power of its lords in the times of chivalry, fixed it, very early, in my mind, as the fit site for a tale of romance. In addition to the beautiful fragment of a front on the Trent bank, massive and extensive foundations in the back-ground show that it must have been an important building in by-gone times.  Torksey was, undoubtedly, one of the first towns in Lincolnshire, in the Saxon period. Only three of the towns in the county are classed in Domesday Book, and it is one of them: \"Lincoln mans. 982; Stamford 317: _Terchesey_ 102.\" (Turner's Hist. of the Anglo-Saxons, 1836, vol. iii. page 251.) Writers of parts of the county history,--(for a complete history of Lincolnshire has not yet been written,)--affirm that Torksey is the _Tiovulfingacester_ of Venerable Bede; but Smith, the learned editor of the Cambridge edition of Bede, inclines to the opinion that Southwell is the town indicated by the pious and industrious monastic. The passage in Bede leaves every thing to conjecture: he simply relates that a truth-speaking presbyter and abbot of _Pearteneu_, (most likely, Partney, near Horncastle, in Lincolnshire,) named Deda, said that an old man had told him, that he, with a great multitude, was baptized by Paulinus, in the presence of King Edwin, \"in fluvio Treenta juxta civitatem quæ lingua Anglorum Tiovulfingacaestir vocatur\"--in the river Trent, near the city which in the language of the Angles is called Tiovulfingacaestir (Smith's Bede: Cambr. 1722, page 97.)--This passage occurs immediately after the relation of the Christian mission of Paulinus into Lindsey, and his conversion of Blecca, governor of Lincoln, and his family, while the good King Edwin reigned over East Anglia, to which petty kingdom Lincolnshire seems sometimes to have belonged, though it was generally comprehended in the kingdom of Mercia, during the period of the Heptarchy.  If Stukeley be correct in his supposition that the \"Foss-dyke,\" or canal which connects the Trent here with the Witham at Lincoln, be the work of the Romans,--and I know no reason for doubting it,--Torksey, standing at the junction of the artificial river with the Trent, must have been an important station even before the Saxon times. These are Stukeley's words relative to the commercial use of the Foss-Dyke: \"By this means the corn of Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire, Huntingdonshire, Northamptonshire, Rutland, and Lincolnshire, came in;--from the Trent, that of Nottinghamshire; all easily conveyed northward to the utmost limits of the Roman power there, by the river Ouse, which is navigable to the imperial city of York. This city (York) was built and placed there, in that spot, on the very account of the corn-boats coming thither, and the emperors there resided, on that account; and the great morass on the river Foss was the haven, or bason, where these corn-boats unladed. The very name of the Foss at York, and Foss-dyke between Lincoln and the Trent, are memorials of its being an artificial work, even as the great Foss road, equally the work of the spade, though in a different manner.\" (Stukeley's Palæographia Britannica: Stamford, 1746: No. 2, page 39.)  In the superb edition of Dugdale's Monasticon Anglicanum, edited by Sir Henry Ellis and others (1825), occurs the following note, also evidencing the extent of ancient Torksey:--\"Mr. T. Sympson, who collected for a history of Lincoln, in a letter preserved in one of Cole's manuscript volumes in the British Museum, dated January 20, 1741, says, 'Yesterday, in Atwater's Memorandums, I met with a composition between the prior of St. Leonard's in Torksey and the nuns of the Fosse, by which it appears there were then three parishes in Torksey: viz. All Saints, St. Mary's, and St Peter's.\" (Vol. iv. page 292.)  At what date this \"composition\" took place between the prior and nuns, we are not told: of course, it must have been before the dissolution of the religious houses. Leland's account of Torksey, which is as follows, applies to a period immediately succeeding that event.  \"The olde buildinges of Torkesey wer on the south of the new toune, [that is, at the junction of the Trent with the Fosse] but ther now is litle seene of olde buildinges, more than a chapelle, wher men say was the paroch chirch of olde Torkesey; and on Trent side the Yerth so balkith up that it shewith that there be likelihod hath beene sum waulle, and by it is a hill of yerth cast up: they caulle it the Wynde Mille Hille, but I thinke the dungeon of sum olde castelle was there. By olde Torkesey standith southely the ruines of Fosse Nunnery, hard by the stone-bridge over Fosse Dik; and there Fosse Dike hath his entering ynto Trente. There be 2 smaul paroche chirches in new Torkesey and the Priory of S. Leonard standith on theste [the East] side of it. The ripe [bank] that Torkesey standith on is sumwhat higher ground than is by the west ripe of Trent. Trent there devidith, and a good deale upward, Lincolnshire from Nottinghamshire.\" (Itinerary: Oxon, 1745: vol. i. page 33.)   II.  THOROLD.  The high character for generousness and hospitality assigned to this most ancient of Lincolnshire families, by history and tradition, was my only reason for giving its name to an imaginary lord of Torksey. Ingulphus, the Croyland chronicler, in a passage full of grateful eloquence,--(commencing, \"Tunc inter familiares nostri monasterii, et benevolos amicos, erat præcipuus consiliarius quidam. Vicecomes Lincolniæ, dictus Thoroldus,\"--but too long to quote entire,)--relates, that in a dreadful famine, which occurred in the reign of Edward the Confessor, Thorold, sheriff of Lincolnshire, gave his manor of Bokenhale to the abbey of Croyland, and afterwards bestowed upon it his manor of Spalding, with all its rents and profits. (Gale's Rer. Ang. Script. Vet. Tom. i. page 65. Oxon, 1684.)  Tanner thus briefly notices the latter circumstance: \"Spalding. Thorold de Bukenale, brother to the charitable countess Godiva, gave a place here, A.D. 1052, for the habitation, and lands for the maintenance of a prior and five monks from Croiland.\" (Notitia, page 251. fol. 1744.) The generosity of the female Thorold, Godiva, is matter of notoriety in the traditionary history of Coventry; and her name, and that of her husband, are found in connection with the history of the very ancient town of Stow, in Lincolnshire, as benefactors to its church. \"Leofricus, comes Merciæ, et Godiva ejus uxor ecclesiam de S. Marie Stow, quam Eadnotus, episcopus Lincolniæ, construxit, pluribus ornamentis ditavit\"--Leofric, earl of Mercia, and Godiva his wife, enriched with many adornments the church of St. Mary at Stow, which Eadnoth, bishop of Lincoln, built. (Leland's Collectanea, vol. i. page 158. London, 1770.)  In Kimber and Johnson's Baronetage (vol. i. page 470.) the Thorold of the reign of Edward the Confessor is said to be descended from Thorold, sheriff of Lincolnshire in the reign of Kenelph, king of Mercia. Betham, in his \"Baronetage of England\" (Ipswich, 1801, vol. i. page 476) says the pedigree of the Thorolds is a \"very fine\" one, and enumerates its several branches of Marston, Blankney, Harmston, Morton, and Claythorp, and of the \"High Hall and Low Hall, in Hough, all within the said county of Lincoln.\" Betham, and other writers of his class, enumerate Thorolds, sheriffs of Lincolnshire, in the reigns of Philip and Mary, Elizabeth, James I. and Charles I.; and Sir George Thorold of Harmston was sheriff of London and Middlesex, in 1710,--and afterwards Lord Mayor.  Sir John Thorold of Syston is now the chief representative of this Saxon family; but report says that he delights to live abroad--rather than in the midst of his tenantry and dependants, to gladden the hearts of the poor, and receive happiness from diffusing it among others, after the good example of his ancestors.
