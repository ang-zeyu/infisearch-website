I'll have to now. But that'll be it. Once they've tipped their hand all the way, you'll have about thirty seconds left to make the right move. I hope you remember that!\"  He cleared his throat. \"I--\"  \"NOW!\" Telzey said.  Along the walls of the balcony garden, beside the ornamental flower stands, against the edges of the rock pool, the crest cats appeared. Perhaps thirty of them. None quite as physically impressive as Iron Thoughts who stood closest to the Moderator; but none very far from it. Motionless as rocks, frightening as gargoyles, they waited, eyes glowing with hellish excitement.  \"This is _their_ council, you see,\" Telzey heard herself saying.  The Moderator's face had also paled. But he was, after all, an old shikari and a senior diplomat. He took an unhurried look around the circle, said quietly, \"Accept my profound apologies for doubting you. Miss Amberdon!\" and reached for the desk communicator.  Iron Thoughts swung his demon head in Telzey's direction. For an instant, she picked up the mental impression of a fierce yellow eye closing in an approving wink.  \"... An open transmitter line to Orado,\" the Moderator was saying into the communicator. \"The Council. And snap it up! Some very important visitors are waiting.\"  The offices of Jontarou's Planetary Moderator became an extremely busy and interesting area then. Quite two hours passed before it occurred to anyone to ask Telzey again whether she knew where her aunt was at present.  Telzey smote her forehead.  \"Forgot all about that!\" she admitted, fishing the sportscar's keys out of the pocket of her sunbriefs. \"They're out on the parking platform....\"         *       *       *       *       *  The preliminary treaty arrangements between the Federation of the Hub and the new Affiliated Species of the Planet of Jontarou were formally ratified two weeks later, the ceremony taking place on Jontarou, in the Champagne Hall of the Shikaris' Club.  Telzey was able to follow the event only by news viewer in her ship-cabin, she and Halet being on the return trip to Orado by then. She wasn't too interested in the treaty's details--they conformed almost exactly to what she had read out to Iron Thoughts and his co-chiefs and companions in the park. It was the smooth bridging of the wide language gap between the contracting parties by a row of interpreting machines and a handful of human xenotelepaths which held her attention.  As she switched off the viewer, Halet came wandering in from the adjoining cabin.  \"I was watching it, too!\" Halet observed. She smiled. \"I was hoping to see dear Tick-Tock.\"  Telzey looked over at her. \"Well, TT would hardly be likely to show up in Port Nichay,\" she said. \"She's having too good a time now finding out what life in the Baluit range is like.\"  \"I suppose so,\" Halet agreed doubtfully, sitting down on a hassock. \"But I'm glad she promised to get in touch with us again in a few years. I'll miss her.\"  Telzey regarded her aunt with a reflective frown. Halet meant it quite sincerely, of course, she had undergone a profound change of heart during the past two weeks. But Telzey wasn't without some doubts about the actual value of a change of heart brought on by telepathic means. The learning process the crest cats had started in her mind appeared to have continued automatically several days longer than her rugged teachers had really intended; and Telzey had reason to believe that by the end of that time she'd developed associated latent abilities of which the crest cats had never heard. She'd barely begun to get it all sorted out yet, but ... as an example ... she'd found it remarkably easy to turn Halet's more obnoxious attitudes virtually upside down. It had taken her a couple of days to get the hang of her aunt's personal symbolism, but after that there had been no problem.  She was reasonably certain she'd broken no laws so far, though the sections in the law library covering the use and abuse of psionic abilities were veiled in such intricate and downright obscuring phrasing--deliberately, Telzey suspected--that it was really difficult to say what they did mean. But even aside from that, there were a number of arguments in favor of exercising great caution.  Jessamine, for one thing, was bound to start worrying about her sister-in-law's health if Halet turned up on Orado in her present state of mind, even though it would make for a far more agreeable atmosphere in the Amberdon household.  \"Halet,\" Telzey inquired mentally, \"do you remember what an all-out stinker you used to be?\"  \"Of course, dear,\" Halet said aloud. \"I can hardly wait to tell dear Jessamine how much I regret the many times I....\"  \"Well,\" Telzey went on, still verbalizing it silently. \"I think you'd really enjoy life more if you were, let's say, about halfway between your old nasty self and the sort of sickening-good kind you are now.\"  \"Why, Telzey!\" Halet cried out with dopey amiability. \"What a delightful idea!\"  \"Let's try it,\" Telzey said.  There was silence in the cabin for some twenty minutes then while she went painstakingly about remolding a number of Halet's character traits for the second time. She still felt some misgivings about it; but if it became necessary, she probably could always restore the old Halet _in toto_.  These, she told herself, definitely were powers one should treat with respect! Better rattle through law school first; then, with that out of the way, she could start hunting around to see who in the Federation was qualified to instruct a genius-level novice in the proper handling of psionics.         *       *       *       *       *"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30472"],["title","Needlework As Art (#0)"],["body","Transcriber's Note  A carat (^) is used to indicate superscripted characters.

TO  THE QUEEN.   _Your Majesty's most gracious acceptance of the Dedication of my book on \"Needlework as Art\" casts a light upon the subject that shows its worthiness, and my inability to do it justice. Still, I hope I may fill a gap in the artistic literature of our day, and I venture to lay my work at your Majesty's feet with loyal devotion._                                             MARIAN M. ALFORD.     PREFACE.   In the Preface to the \"Handbook of Art Needlework,\" which I edited for the Royal School at South Kensington in 1880, I undertook to write a second part, to be devoted to design, colour, and the common-sense modes of treating decorative art, as applied especially to embroidered hangings, furniture, dress, and the smaller objects of luxury.  Circumstances have, since then, obliged me to reconsider this intention; and I have found it more practicable to cast the information which I have collected from Eastern and Western sources into the form of a separate work, which in no way supersedes or interferes with the technical instruction supposed to be conveyed in a handbook. I have found so much amusement in learning for myself the history of the art of embroidery, and in tracing the beginnings and the interchanges of national schools, that I cannot but hope that I may excite a similar interest in some of my readers, and so induce those who are capable, to help and lift it to a higher place than it has been allowed in these latter days to occupy. If I have given too important a position to the art of needlework, I would observe that while I have been writing, decorative embroidery has come to the front, and is at this moment one of the hobbies of the day; and I would point out that it contains in itself all the necessary elements of art; it may exercise the imagination and the fancy; it needs education in form, colour, and composition, as well as the craft of a practised hand, to express its language and perfect its beauty.  I confess that when I undertook this task, I did not anticipate the time I have had to spend in collecting and epitomizing the many notices to be found in German, French, and English authors, on what has been considered among us, at least in this century, as merely a secondary art, and therefore, as such, of little importance. Cursory notices of needlework are scattered through almost every book on art; and under the head of textiles it is usual to find embroidery acknowledged as being worthy of notice, though not to be named in company with sculpture, architecture, or painting, however beautifully or thoughtfully its works may be carried out. I have tried to show that it deserves higher estimation.  My first intention was simply to consider STYLE, good or bad, as it influences our embroidery of to-day, and to find some rules by which to guide that of the future in its next phase. But when we search into the fluctuations of style, and their causes, we find they have an historical succession, and that we must begin at the beginning and trace them through the life of mankind.  This led me to attempt a sketch of consecutive styles, their overlap and variations.  I then found that DESIGN, PATTERNS, STITCHES, MATERIALS, each require a separate study.  COLOUR, as applied to dyes, claims to be regarded as differing from pigments on the painter's palette.  HANGINGS, DRESS, and ECCLESIASTICAL EMBROIDERIES each require different rules, and the study of the best examples of past centuries. Finally, it seems natural to dwell on our own proficiency in decorative work. ENGLISH EMBROIDERY has always excelled; and, as we have again returned to this occupation, it is worth while to recollect what we have done of old.  In writing chapters on these subjects, I have found it most convenient to separate the historical and æsthetic questions from the technical rules, and the instruction which naturally belongs to a handbook, of which the purpose should be to teach the easiest and most orthodox manner of executing the simplest, and elaborating the finest works. Such questions ought not to be overlaid with archæological inquiries, or with the information which only profits the designer; though of course it is best that the knowledge of design should be part of the education of the craft.  Perhaps I may be found to have written a book too shallow for the learned, too deep for the frivolous, too technical for the general public, and too diffuse for the specialist of the craft.[1]  I must deprecate these criticisms by saying that I have written it for the benefit of those who know nothing of the art, and are too much engaged to seek information here and there; who yet, being women, have to select and to execute ornamental needlework; or, being artists, are vexed at the incongruities and want of intention in the decorations in daily domestic use; I have also sought to help the designer, that he or she may know something of the history of patterns and stitches.  If my readers should be aware of repetitions, they must forgive them; remembering that the same idea has to be looked at sometimes from a different point of view, according to the use to which it is to be fitted. The same material may be employed for wall-hangings and dress, and then the principles which have been formulated have to be varied. I do not shrink from repetitions if they make my meaning clear, remembering the Duke of Wellington's direction to his private secretary, \"Never mind repetitions; and _dot_ your i's.\"  Portions of these chapters have been already published in No. 49 of the _Nineteenth Century_,[2] in 1881; and more was delivered in three unpublished lectures the same year.  I have acknowledged and noted on each page my authorities for the facts I have quoted. The illustrations that are not original, have been copied from other works by permission of authors and publishers. To all of these I wish to express my obligations and thanks, especially to Mr. Villiers Stuart, Dr. Anderson, Sir G. Birdwood, and Sir H. Layard, for their courtesy in allowing me the use of their plates. To my old and valued friend, Mr. Newton, I wish to express my gratitude for his unstinted gifts of time and trouble, bestowed in criticizing and correcting my book, encouraging me to give it to the public, and making it more worthy of publication.  I have largely quoted Charles Blanc (\"Ornament in Dress,\" English translation), Von Bock (\"Liturgische Gewänder\"), Dr. Rock (\"The Church of our Fathers\" and \"Introduction to Textiles\"), Semper (\"Der Stil\"), Yates (\"Textrinum Antiquorum\"), and Yule (\"Marco Polo\"), besides many others. But these authorities often differ, and, after weighing their arguments, I have ventured to select for my use the facts and theories which accord with my own views. Facts are often so interdependent and closely linked, that it requires great care to distinguish where they have been shaped or coloured (however unintentionally) to fit each other or the writer's preconceived ideas. Certain it is that facts are but useless heaps till the thread of a theory is found on which to hang them. This process, like that of stringing pearls, has to be often repeated, till each occupies its right place. Only those who have adopted and cherished a theory can appreciate the pain of cutting the thread, to displace what appeared to be a pearl, but which, from its false position as to date or place, or its doubtful origin, has proved only an empty manufactured glass bead of error.  This has happened to me more than once; and since I read my lectures I have had to change my opinions in several instances. If, therefore, any of my readers should observe such changes, I hope they will give me credit for trying to convey _now_ what appears to me on each subject a correct impression.   FOOTNOTES:      [1] Besides the art, I have sought to give something of     the archæology of needlework. Now the qualifications for     being a teacher on such subjects are rarely to be met     with, all combined. Mr. Newton, in his \"Essays on Art     and Archæology,\" p. 37, says that \"the archæologist     should combine with the æsthetic culture of the artist,     and the trained judgment of the historian and the     philologist, that critical acumen, required for     classification and interpretation; nor should that     habitual suspicion which must ever attend the scrutiny     and precede the warranty of evidence, give too sceptical     a bias to his mind.\" Such authorities have been     interrogated on each part of my subject.
