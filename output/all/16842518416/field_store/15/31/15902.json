From occasional remarks he had learned that McKay had been in all sorts of places between Buenos Aires and Nome; and from a few intangible hints he suspected that his \"position in life\" had once been much higher socially than at present. But he asked no questions.  \"Some orchestra, all right,\" he responded, casually. \"Plenty of jazz. It'll quiet down after a while.\"  For a time they stood leaning against the wall, staring abstractedly out at the dark. One by one the domestic animals ceased their clamor and settled themselves for the night. The jungle din, too, seemed to diminish, though perhaps this was because the ears of the men had become accustomed to it. At length through the discordant symphony boomed the voice of Tim.  \"By cripes! I know now what folks mean when they talk about a howlin' wilderness. Always thought 'twas one o' them figgers o' speech, but I'll tell the world it ain't no joke! Gosh! Think of all the things that's layin' out there and bellerin' and waitin' for us pore li'l' fellers to come in amongst 'em and git et up.\"  \"You'll find the same things in the cities up home,\" said Knowlton, a bit cynically. \"Different bodies and different methods of attack, but the same merciless animals under the skin. Snakes in silk suits--foul-mouthed alligators in dinner jackets--hunting-cats and vampires, painted and powdered--and all the rest of it.\"  \"Yeah. Ye said a mouthful, Looey. But say, Tommy's shovin' some grub on the table. Mebbe we better hop to it before the flies git it all.\"  After a glance at the vicious attack already begun by the aforesaid flies, the pair adopted Tim's suggestion and hopped to it. Manfully they assailed the rubbery jerked beef, black beans, rice, farinha, and thick, black, unsweetened coffee which comprised the meal. All three were wrestling with chunks of the meat when Tim, facing the door, stopped chewing long enough to mutter:  \"Dutchland overalls. Here's the goose stepper.\"  The heads of the other two involuntarily moved a little. Then their necks stiffened and they continued eating. Tim alone stared straight at a burly, black-whiskered Teuton who had halted in the outer doorway. And Tim alone saw the ugly look crossing the newcomer's visage as he gazed at the khaki shirts, the broad shoulders under them, and the unmistakably Irish--and hostile--face of Tim himself.  Catching the hard stare of the red-haired man, he of the black beard advanced at once, his eyes veering to the door of his own room. Straight to that room he marched with heavy tread. He opened the door with a kick, shut it behind him with a slam. The three at the table glanced at one another.  \"Say what ye like,\" grumbled Tim, \"but me and that guy don't hold no mush party. I don't like his map. I don't like his manners. And he looks too much like the Fritz that shot me in the back with a kamerad gun after surrenderin'. I was in hospital three months. D'ye mind that time, Looey?\"  Knowlton nodded. He remembered also that Tim, shot down from behind and almost killed, had reeled up to his feet and bayoneted his man before falling the second time. Wherefore he replied:  \"He isn't the same one, Tim.\"  \"Nope,\" grimly. \"That one won't never come back. All the same, if you gents want to chew the fat with this feller I'm goin' slummin' with me friend Joey Mouthgargle Nabisco Whoozis. Then I won't be round here to make no sour-caustic remarks and gum up yer party.\"  \"Might be a good idea,\" McKay conceded.  \"There he is now, the li'l' darlin'! Hullo, Joey, old sock! Stick around a minute while I scoop a few more beans. Be with ye toot sweet--vite--presto--P.D.Q.\"  Wherewith he demolished the rest of his meal with military dispatch, proceeded doorward, smote the grinning army of Remate de Males a buffet on the shoulder, and vanished into the night. A moment later his stentorian voice rolled back through the nocturnal racket in an impromptu paraphrase of an old and highly improper army song:      \"We're in the jungle now,     We ain't behind the plow;       We'll never git rich,       We'll die with the itch.     We're in the jungle now!\"     CHAPTER IV.  THE GERMAN   The door of the German's room opened. The German came out and marched to the table. Two paces away he halted and faced the Americans, ready to speak if spoken to, equally ready to sit and ignore them if not greeted. McKay and Knowlton rose.  \"Herr von Schwandorf?\" inquired Knowlton.  \"Schwandorf. Neither Herr nor von. Plain Schwandorf.\"  The reply came in excellent English, though with a slight throaty accent.  \"Knowlton is my name. Mr. McKay. The third member of our party, Mr. Ryan, has just left.\"  Schwandorf bowed stiffly from the waist.  \"It is a pleasure to meet you. White men are all too few here.\"  Seating himself at a place beyond that just vacated by Tim, he continued, \"You stay here for a time?\"  \"Not long.\" They reseated themselves. \"We go up the river as soon as we can arrange transportation.\"  The black brows lifted slightly.  \"It is a dangerous river. You would do well to travel elsewhere unless you have some pressing reason to explore this stream.\"  With an accustomed sweep of the hand he shooed the flies from the bean dish and helped himself to a big portion. Over the legumes he poured farinha in the Brazilian fashion.  \"We have. We are seeking a tribe of people who paint their bones red.\"  Schwandorf's hand, conveying the first mouthful of beans upward, stopped in air. His black eyes fixed the Americans with an astounded stare. He lowered the beans, stabbed absently at a chunk of beef, sawed it apart, popped a piece of it into his mouth, and sat for a time chewing. When the meat was down he spoke bluntly:  \"Are there not ways enough to kill yourselves at home instead of traveling to this place to do it?\"  McKay smiled. The directness of the man amused him.  \"As bad as that?\" asked Knowlton.  \"As bad as that. Blow your head off if you like. Cut your throat. Take poison. Jump into the river among the alligators. Step on a snake. But keep away from the Red Bones.\"  \"Why?\" shot McKay.  \"Cannibals--and worse.\"  \"Worse?\"  \"Truly. Most of the Brazilian savages do not torture. The Red Bones do.\"  \"Pleasant prospect.\"  \"Very. Nothing to be gained among them, either. If you're hunting gold, try the hills over west of the Huallaga. None here.\"  Knowlton filled and lit a pipe. McKay slowly drank the last of his syrupy coffee and rolled a cigarette. Schwandorf continued shoveling food into his capacious mouth.  \"Know anything about the Raposa?\" Knowlton asked.  The Teuton's eyelashes flickered. He ground another chunk of meat between his jaws before answering.  \"Of course,\" he said then. \"Wild dog. Sharp snout, gray hair, bushy tail. I've shot a couple of them.\"  \"This one is a man. Green eyes, streak of white hair over the left ear. Paints himself like the Red Bones, as you call them, but is a white man.\"  \"Oh! That one? Heard of him, yes. Wild man of the jungle. Want to catch him and put him in a circus?\"  \"Maybe. We'd like to see him, anyhow. Heard about him awhile ago. Any way to get him that you know of?\"  \"Might try a steel trap,\" the German suggested, callously. \"But I don't know where you'd set it. Best way to get a wild dog is to shoot him, and he isn't much good dead. Or would this one be worth something--dead?\" A swift sidelong glance accompanied the question.  \"Not a cent!\" snapped McKay.  \"And perhaps he'd be worth nothing alive,\" added Knowlton. \"But we have a healthy curiosity to look him over. Guess the Red Bone country would be the likeliest place. How far is it from here?\"  \"Keep out of it,\" was the stubborn reply.  The Americans rose.  \"We are not going to keep out of it,\" Knowlton declared, coldly. \"We are going straight into it. Thank you for your assistance.\"  \"Not so fast,\" Schwandorf protested. \"If you are determined to go I will help you if I can. Shall we sit on the piazza with a small bottle to aid digestion? So! Thomaz! Bring from my stock the kümmel. Or would you prefer whisky, gentlemen?\"  \"Ginger-ale highballs are my favorite fruit,\" admitted Knowlton. \"Can ginger ale be bought here?\"  \"Indeed yes. At one milrei a bottle.\"  \"Cheap enough. Thomaz, three bottles of ginger ale and one of North American whisky--the best. Cigars also. Out on the piazza.\"  \"Si, senhores.\"  Schwandorf got up.  \"If you will pardon me, I will drink my kümmel. Frankly, I do not like whisky.\"  \"And frankly, we do not like kümmel. All a matter of taste.\"  \"Truly. So let each of us drink his own preference. I will join you in a moment.\"  The Americans sauntered to the door, while the German strode into his room.  \"Blunt sort of cuss,\" Knowlton commented.  \"Ay, blunt. But not candid. Knows more than he's telling.\"  Disposing themselves comfortably, they sat watching the lights of the town and the jungle--the first pouring from windows and open doors, the latter streaking across the darkness where the big fire beetles of the tropics winged their way. As Knowlton had predicted, the night noise of forest and stream had diminished; but now from the village itself rose a new discord--a babel of vocal and instrumental efforts at music emanating from the badly worn records of dozens of cheap phonographs grinding away in the stilt-poled huts.  \"Good Lord!\" groaned McKay. \"Even here at the end of the world one can't get away from those beastly instruments.\"  A throaty chuckle from the doorway followed the words. Schwandorf emerged, carrying a big bottle.  \"Yet there is one thing to be thankful for, gentlemen,\" he said. \"In all this town there is not one man who attempts to play a trombone.\"  The others laughed. Thomaz appeared with bottles and thick cups. Corks were drawn, liquids gurgled, matches flared, cigars glowed. Without warning Schwandorf shot a question through the gloom:  \"Have you seen Cabral--the superintendent?\"  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30324"],["title","The Pathless Trail (#4)"],["body","\"Yes.\"  \"Ask him about the wild man?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Get any information?\"  \"Nothing definite. He suggested that we see you.\"  \"So.\"  A pause, while Schwandorf's cigar end glowed like a flaming eye.  \"The Red Bones live well up the river,\" he began, abruptly. \"Twenty-four days by canoe, five days through the bush on the east shore. That would bring you to their main settlement--if you were not wiped out before then. They're a big tribe, as tribes go. Ever been here before?\"  \"No. Not here,\" Knowlton told him. \"I've been in Rio, and McKay here has knocked around in--\"  A stealthy kick from McKay halted him an instant. Then, deftly shifting the sentence, he concluded, \"--in a number of places.\"  \"So.\" Another pause. \"Then I should explain about tribes. Tribes here generally consist of from fifty to five hundred or more persons living in big houses called '_malocas_.' Unless the tribe is very big, one house holds them all. There may be any number of _malocas_, the inhabitants of which are all of the same racial stock; yet each _maloca_ is, as far as government is concerned, a tribe to itself, controlled by a chief. No _maloca_ owes any duty to any other _maloca_. There is no supreme ruler over all, nor even a federation among them. They live merely as neighbors--distant neighbors. At times they fight like neighbors. You understand.\"  \"'When Greek meets Greek--'\" quoted McKay.  \"Just so. When I say, then, that the Red Bones are a big tribe, I mean that there are about five hundred--maybe more--individuals in their main settlement. They live in huts, not in one big tribe-house like the Mayorunas. They are not Mayorunas, in fact; they paint differently, are darker of skin, and more cruel.  \"The Mayorunas, by the way, are not so debased as you might think. Though cannibals, they do not kill for the sake of eating 'long pig,' like the cannibals of the South Seas. Neither do they eat the whole body. Only the hands and feet of their dead enemies are devoured. These are carefully cooked and eaten as delicacies along with monkey meat, birds, fish, and other things prepared for a feast in honor of a victory. The eating of human flesh seems to be symbolism rather than savagery. Furthermore, they do not range the jungle hunting for victims. They eat only those who come against them as enemies.  \"So it is quite possible, you see, that strangers might go among them and escape death. It would depend largely on the ability of the strangers to convince the savages that they were friends. The difficulty is that the savages consider all strangers to be enemies until friendship is proved.\"  \"A sizable difficulty,\" McKay remarked.  \"Almost insurmountable. Yet it might be done. Mind, I speak now of the Mayorunas, not of the Red Bones. I tell you again that the Red Bone country is closed.\"  \"And where is the Mayoruna region?\"  \"In the same general section. The Mayorunas are much more widely distributed. They are on both banks of the Javary and extend as far west as the Ucayali.  \"Now if I sought to enter the Red Bone region--and again I say I would not--this would be my way of going at it. I would go first among the Mayorunas near the Red Bones and seek to convince them that I was their friend. I would make the Mayoruna chief as friendly to me as possible. I might even take a Mayoruna woman for a time--some of them are handsome, and such a step would make me almost a Mayoruna myself in their eyes. Then I would persuade the chief to send messengers to the Red Bones with word of me and a request that I be allowed to visit their settlement. The request, coming from the Mayoruna chief, probably would be granted. I would then go in with a bodyguard of Mayorunas, do my business, and come out via the Mayoruna route.\"  A thoughtful silence ensued. Bottle necks clinked against the cups.  \"Something in that idea,\" conceded Knowlton. \"A good deal in it. Barring the woman part, of course.\"  \"Ay,\" spoke McKay, his tone casual as ever. \"When you came out what would you do with your woman, _mein Herr_?\"  Schwandorf, tongue loosened a bit by his kümmel, chuckled.  \"Ho-ho! The woman? Leave her, of course, when she had served my purpose. Why bother about a woman here and there?\"  \"I see.\" McKay's face, indistinct in the gloom, was unreadable, but his tone had a caustic edge.  Schwandorf laughed again. \"You are fresh from the woman-worshiping United States and you disapprove. But this is the jungle, and all is different. '_Cada terra com seu uso_,' as these Brazilians say--each land with its own ways. Perhaps when you have met the Mayoruna women, looked on their handsome faces and shapely forms--they wear no clothing, by the way--you will change your ideas. More than one man along this border has risked his life to win one of those women. But that rests with you. And now if you will excuse me, gentlemen, I have an engagement with a man at the other end of town.\"  \"Certainly. We are indebted to you for your interest.\"  \"It is nothing. Remember that I strongly advise you not to go. But if you will go, I shall gladly do whatever lies in my power to aid you in preparing for the trip. Do not hesitate to call on me.\"  He passed into the house, returning almost at once.  \"By the way,\" he added, \"one of you has the room next mine?\"  \"I have it,\" said Knowlton.  \"Yes. Are you a good sleeper? I sometimes snore most atrociously, I am told. So perhaps--\"  \"Don't worry. I can sleep in the middle of a bombardment.\"  \"You are fortunate. Good evening, gentlemen.\"  When he was gone they sat for a time smoking, sipping now and then at their highballs. At length McKay said, \"Humph!\"  \"Amen. Pretty square sort of chap, though, don't you think?\"  \"I'm not saying,\" was the Scot's cautious answer. \"Seems to be trying to discourage us and egg us on at the same time. Something up his sleeve, perhaps.\"  \"Can't tell. But his line of talk rings true so far. Checks up all right with what we've heard about the Mayorunas and so on. And that scheme of working in through the Mayoruna country sounds about as sensible as anything. Desperate chance and all that, but it might work. Say, why did you kick me when I was going to tell him you'd been in British Guiana?\"  \"Don't know exactly. Had a hunch. Seems to me I've seen that fellow before somewhere, but I can't place him. None of his business where I've been, anyhow. We're boobs from the States hunting for a wild man. That's all he needs to know.\"  But it was not enough for Schwandorf to know. At that very moment he was on his way to the home of Superintendent Cabral, with whom he had no engagement whatever, to learn all he could concerning the business of these military-appearing strangers; also to impress on that official the fact that he had sought to dissuade them from starting on their mad quest.  And much later that night, when Knowlton was making good his boast that he was a sound sleeper, a black-bearded face rose silently above the iron partition between his room and that of the German. A hand gripping a small electric flashlight followed. A white ray searched the room, halting on the khaki shirt lying over a box. A tough withe with a barb at one end came over like a slender tentacle, hooked the shirt neatly, drew it stealthily up to the top. Shirt, stick, lamp, hand, face all dissolved into darkness.  After a time they reappeared. The shirt came down, swung slowly back and forth, was dropped deftly where it had previously lain. The breast pocket holding the grain-leather notebook and the photograph of David Dawson Rand was buttoned as it had been, and the notebook bulged the cloth slightly as before. But the contents of that book and the pictured face of Rand now were stamped on the brain of Schwandorf. A sneering, snarling smile curled the heavy mouth of Schwandorf. And softly, so softly that none could hear it but himself, sounded the ironical benediction of Schwandorf:  \"Sleep well, _offizier americanisch_! Dream on, poor fool! In time you will wake up. _Ja_, you will wake up!\"     CHAPTER V.  INTO THE BUSH   Sleepy eyed and frowzy haired, with shirt unbuttoned and breeches and boots unlaced, Tim emerged from his iron-walled cell into the cool-shadowed main room, blinked at McKay and Knowlton lounging over their morning coffee and cigarettes, stretched his hairy arms, and advanced sluggishly to the table.  \"Yow-oo-hum!\" he yawned. \"Ain't they cute! All dressed and shaved like they was goin' to visit the C. O. And here's pore Timmy Ryan lookin' like a 'drunk and dirty' jest throwed into the guardhouse, and feelin' worse. Top o' the mornin' to ye, gents!\"  \"Same to you, Tim,\" McKay nodded.  \"Who hit you?\" asked Knowlton, squinting at bumps and scratches on Tim's forehead.  \"Nobody. Couple fellers tried to, but they was out o' luck. Oh, I see what ye mean! I done that meself while I was gittin' to bed.\"  \"Waves must have been running high on the ocean last night. Better drink some coffee. Thomaz, another cup--big and black.\"  \"Thanks, Looey. 'Twas kind of an active night, at that.\"  \"I heard you come in,\" vouchsafed McKay. \"Were you trying some high diving in your room?\"  \"Faith, I done some divin' without tryin', but 'twas ragged work--I pulled a belly smacker every time. I got to tame that hammick o' mine. It throwed me four times hand-running and the only way I could hold it down was to unhook it and lay it on the floor.\"  \"Sleep well then?\"  \"I did not. Cap, I thought I knowed somethin' about cooties, but I take it back--I never knowed nothin' about them insecks till last night. Where they come from I dunno, but I'll tell the world they come, and if they wasn't half an inch long I'll eat 'em. They darn near dragged me off whole, and all the sleep I got ye could stick in a flea's eye. Lookit here.\"  He extended an arm dotted with swollen red spots.  \"Ants!\" said McKay, after one glance. \"Ants, not cooties. They're everywhere. Especially under the floor. That's one reason why folks sleep in hammocks down here. Even then they're"]]]
