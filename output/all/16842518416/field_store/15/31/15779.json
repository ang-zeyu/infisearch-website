Not to commercialize a beautiful world like Dream Planet.\"  Atkinson stood unmoving, and Loveral could see the way the man's muscles were tight, like steel springs, and the way his eyes burned deep inside their blackness.  \"We've given you everything you need,\" Loveral explained, trying to adjust the smile on his lips again. \"Everybody has everything they want. But, you see, if you sit there and work and make something that someone else doesn't have, then the whole system is destroyed. Then someone will want what you've made. We'll have jealousy and hatred and fighting. This is the stuff of which wars are made, George. You know that. It starts with small things like this, but it grows. When it does, the structure of our life here will collapse. You wouldn't want that, would you, George?\"  \"Yes!\" Atkinson said, his mouth white at the edges. \"I'd like to see the whole rotten thing collapsed and blown to hell!\"  Loveral's teeth snapped together and his lips grew tight. He could feel a muscle jumping along his neck.  Atkinson looked at him with furious eyes. \"What do you think it's like, living this way? You're busy working twenty-four hours a day, while we wander around this damned prison like the breathing dead. You can feel sweat and aches in your bones from a hard day's work. Sleep is like medicine to you, instead of another stretch of torture. You can forget your own brain for a while by doing something with your hands. You can relax because you can get tired. Not us, by God. Not us!\"  \"I envy you, George,\" Loveral said through his teeth.  \"Oh, like hell you do. You treat us like we were helpless infants. You feed and clothe us and do all our work, and you're so happy you damned near split your guts.\"  \"I'll take that, if you don't mind,\" Loveral said, reaching for the hammer, his voice suddenly icy cold.  Atkinson slammed back against the table. \"No, you won't. You won't take anything more at all. You've taken our spirit and our pride and the strength right out of our spines. You won't take anything more!\"  \"George?\" Loveral said, but not moving any further.  Atkinson slid the hammer back of him onto the table, and his hands were searching among a dozen scattered pieces of metal and wood. He watched Loveral as he worked. \"Let me show you what else I've made,\" he said.  \"I'd hate to do it,\" Loveral said, \"but I can stop your food, your water, everything.\"  Atkinson's hands moved swiftly, assembling the pieces. He nodded. \"You can, but you won't.\"  \"I have the only keys to the storage units. I control everything, George.\"  \"Correction,\" said Atkinson, holding an assembled revolver in his hands. \"You _did_.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Loveral looked at what Atkinson had in his hands. He blinked.  \"You're nearly dead,\" Atkinson said.  Loveral looked at Atkinson, into his eyes. \"If you wanted to kill me, you could have done it some other way.\"  Atkinson shook his head. \"Just this way. Just with something that took me dozens of days and nights to make. With something that made me sweat and swear to get. It was difficult--with no tools or proper materials--but that made it all the better. Now I've got it finished,\" he said, pushing a bullet into the chamber, \"and ready to use.\"  Loveral stood frozen, then he turned. \"My dear,\" he said to the woman who moved her mouth as though her voice had been pumped out of her. He reached to touch her shoulder. She recoiled, as though his fingers held poison. \"George,\" he said, turning back to the black-eyed man.  \"This is a great moment,\" Atkinson said, lifting the muzzle of the revolver. \"When I squeeze the trigger, it'll be like blowing the lock off a prison door. I'll go yelling to the others, and we'll smash down the whole goddamned place. We'll smash it down, so we'll have to rebuild it. We'll pull apart every robot you've got. We'll tear apart the food lockers and have a celebration for a week, and when we've gotten sick from too much food, we'll start growing some more with our own hands. We'll make forges for the men and looms for the women. We'll burn our clothes and make new ones. We'll grow corn in the fields. We'll pump water from the ground. You're finished, Loveral.\"  Loveral stared at the revolver. \"George,\" he said, pleading. \"The plans. The beautiful, beautiful plans. All of you, you all wanted peace and contentment. Time to think and dream. You all wanted to get away from the work and the worry and the responsibility. You--\"  Atkinson fired the gun into Loveral's stomach.  Loveral gestured at the air and fell to his knees. Atkinson threw his gun through a window and grabbed his wife by the hand. \"Hurry!\" he said, laughing. \"Hurry!\"  Loveral felt of the blood on his shirt and rested on his knees. He could hear footsteps, racing through the house and out to the yard. He held out his bloody hand and looked at it. Atkinson's voice pealed through the warm clear air. \"He's dead! Loveral's dead!\"  There was a sound of sudden activity, and everywhere went the cry, \"Loveral's dead!\"  Loveral sank to his haunches and opened his lips. The blood was there, too. He could hear the shouts and the laughter, and then the tearing of steel, the smashing of glass. He bent over his knees, trembling with a sudden chill. The sound of destruction grew like thunder. \"Why?\" he said in his dying throat. \"Oh, why? It was what they said they wanted.\"   THE END     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _If Worlds of Science Fiction_     September 1953.

ABBOT  Author of \"The Story of Our Army,\" \"The Story of Our Navy,\" \"The Nations at War\"   _With Eight Color Plates and 100 Other Illustrations_       G. P. Putnam's Sons   New York and London   The Knickerbocker Press   1918    Copyright, 1918   By   WILLIS J. ABBOT    The Knickerbocker Press, New York     PREFACE   Not since gunpowder was first employed in warfare has so revolutionary a contribution to the science of slaughtering men been made as by the perfection of aircraft and submarines. The former have had their first employment in this world-wide war of the nations. The latter, though in the experimental stage as far back as the American Revolution, have in this bitter contest been for the first time brought to so practical a stage of development as to exert a really appreciable influence on the outcome of the struggle.  Comparatively few people appreciate how the thought of navigating the air's dizziest heights and the sea's gloomiest depths has obsessed the minds of inventors. From the earliest days of history men have grappled with the problem, yet it is only within two hundred years for aircraft and one hundred for submarines that any really intelligent start has been made upon its solution. The men who really gave practical effect to the vague theories which others set up--in aircraft the Wrights, Santos-Dumont, and Count Zeppelin; in submarines Lake and Holland--are either still living, or have died so recently that their memory is still fresh in the minds of all.  In this book the author has sketched swiftly the slow stages by which in each of these fields of activity success has been attained. He has collated from the immense mass of records of the activities of both submarines and aircraft enough interesting data to show the degree of perfection and practicability to which both have been brought. And he has outlined so far as possible from existing conditions the possibilities of future usefulness in fields other than those of war of these new devices.  The most serious difficulty encountered in dealing with the present state and future development of aircraft is the rapidity with which that development proceeds. Before a Congressional Committee last January an official testified that grave delay in the manufacture of airplanes for the army had been caused by the fact that types adopted a scant three months before had become obsolete, because of experience on the European battlefields, and later inventions before the first machines could be completed. There may be exaggeration in the statement but it is largely true. Neither the machines nor the tactics employed at the beginning of the war were in use in its fourth year. The course of this evolution, with its reasons, are described in this volume.  Opportunities for the peaceful use of airplanes are beginning to suggest themselves daily. After the main body of this book was in type the Postmaster-General of the United States called for bids for an aÃ«rial mail service between New York and Washington--an act urged upon the Government in this volume. That service contemplates a swift carriage of first-class mail at an enhanced price--the tentative schedule being three hours, and a postage fee of twenty-five cents an ounce. There can be no doubt of the success of the service, its value to the public, and its possibilities of revenue to the post-office. Once its usefulness is established it will be extended to routes of similar length, such as New York and Boston, New York and Buffalo, or New York and Pittsburgh. The mind suggests no limit to the extension of aÃ«rial service, both postal and passenger, in the years of industrial activity that shall follow the war.  In the preparation of this book the author has made use of many records of personal experiences of those who have dared the air's high altitudes and the sea's stilly depths. For permission to use certain of these he wishes to express his thanks to the Century Co., for extracts from _My Airships_ by Santos-Dumont; to Doubleday, Page & Co., for extracts from _Flying for France_, by James R. McConnell; to Charles Scribner's Sons, for material drawn from _With the French Flying Corps_, by Carroll Dana Winslow; to _Collier's Weekly_, for certain extracts from interviews with Wilbur Wright; to _McClure's Magazine_, for the account of Mr. Ray Stannard Baker's trip in a Lake submarine; to Hearst's International Library, and to the _Scientific American_, for the use of several illustrations.
