Barney arranged for the rental of a bungalow in the outskirts of Sweetwater beach, which lay uphill from the old house in which McAllen and Fredericks lived, and provided a good view of the residence and its street entry. He didn't go near the place himself. Operatives of a Los Angeles detective agency went on constant watch in the bungalow, with orders to photograph the two old men in the other house and any visitors at every appearance, and to record the exact times the pictures were taken. At the end of each day the photographs were delivered to an address from where they promptly reached Barney's hands.  A European agency was independently covering the Mallorca cottage in the same manner.  Nearly four weeks passed before Barney obtained the exact results he wanted. He called off the watch at both points, and next day came up the walk to McAllen's home and rang the doorbell. John Fredericks appeared, studied Barney's card and Barney with an air of mild disapproval, and informed him that Dr. McAllen did not receive visitors.  \"So I've been told,\" Barney acknowledged pleasantly. \"Please be so good as to give the doctor this.\"  Fredericks' white eyebrows lifted by the barest trifle as he looked at the sealed envelope Barney was holding out. After a moment's hesitation he took it, instructed Barney to wait, and closed the door firmly.  Listening to Fredericks' footsteps receding into the house, Barney lit a cigarette, and was pleased to find that his hands were as steady as if he had been on the most ordinary of calls. The envelope contained two sets of photographs, dated and indicating the time of day. The date was the same for both sets; the recorded time showed the pictures had been taken within fifteen minutes of one another. The central subject in each case was Dr. McAllen, sometimes accompanied by Fredericks. One set of photographs had been obtained on Mallorca, the other in Sweetwater Beach at McAllen's house.  Barring rocket assists, the two old men had been documented as the fastest moving human beings in all history.  Several minutes passed before Fredericks reappeared. With a face which was now completely without expression, he invited Barney to enter, and conducted him to McAllen's study. The scientist had the photographs spread out on a desk before him. He gestured at them.  \"Just what--if anything--is this supposed to mean, sir?\" he demanded in an unsteady voice.  Barney hesitated aware that Fredericks had remained in the hall just beyond the study. But Fredericks obviously was in McAllen's confidence. His eavesdropping could do no harm.  \"It means this, doctor--\" Barney began, amiably enough; and he proceeded to tell McAllen precisely what the photographs meant. McAllen broke in protestingly two or three times, then let Barney conclude his account of the steps he had taken to verify his farfetched hunch on the pier without further comment. After a few minutes Barney heard Fredericks' steps moving away, and then a door closing softly somewhere, and he shifted his position a trifle so that his right side was now toward the hall door. The little revolver was in the right-hand coat pocket. Even then Barney had no real concern that McAllen or Fredericks would attempt to resort to violence, but when people are acutely disturbed--and McAllen at least was--almost anything can happen.         *       *       *       *       *  When Barney finished, McAllen stared down at the photographs again, shook his head, and looked over at Barney.  [Illustration]  \"If you don't mind,\" he said, blinking behind his glasses, \"I should like to think about this for a minute or two.\"  \"Of course, doctor,\" Barney said politely. McAllen settled back in the chair, removed his glasses and half closed his eyes. Barney let his gaze rove. The furnishings of the house were what he had expected--well-tended, old, declining here and there to the downright shabby. The only reasonably new piece in the study was a radio-phonograph. The walls of the study and of the section of a living room he could see through a small archway were lined with crammed bookshelves. At the far end of the living room was a curious collection of clocks in various types and sizes, mainly antiques, but also some odd metallic pieces with modernistic faces. Vacancies in the rows indicated Fredericks might have begun to dispose discreetly of the more valuable items on his employer's behalf.  McAllen cleared his throat finally, opened his eyes, and settled the spectacles back on his nose.  \"Mr. Chard,\" he inquired, \"have you had scientific training?\"  \"No.\"  \"Then,\" said McAllen, \"the question remains of what your interest in the matter is. Perhaps you'd like to explain just why you put yourself to such considerable expense to intrude on my personal affairs--\"  Barney hesitated perceptibly. \"Doctor,\" he said, \"there is something tantalizing about an enigma. I'm fortunate in having the financial means to gratify my curiosity when it's excited to the extent it was here.\"  McAllen nodded. \"I can understand curiosity. Was that your only motive?\"  Barney gave him his most disarming grin. \"Frankly no. I've mentioned I'm a businessman--\"  \"Ah!\" McAllen said, frowning.  \"Don't misunderstand me. One of my first thoughts admittedly was that here were millions waiting to be picked up. But the investigation soon made a number of things clear to me.\"  \"What were they?\"  \"Essentially, that you had so sound a reason for keeping your invention a secret that to do it you were willing to ruin yourself financially, and to efface yourself as a human being and as a scientist.\"  \"I don't feel,\" McAllen observed mildly, \"that I really have effaced myself, either as a human being or as a scientist.\"  \"No, but as far as the public was concerned you did both.\"  McAllen smiled briefly. \"That strategem was very effective--until now. Very well, Mr. Chard. You understand clearly that under no circumstances would I agree to the commercialization of ... well, of my matter transmitter?\"  Barney nodded. \"Of course.\"  \"And you're still interested?\"  \"Very much so.\"  McAllen was silent for a few seconds, biting reflectively at his lower lip. \"Very well,\" he said again. \"You were speaking of my predilection for fishing. Perhaps you'd care to accompany me on a brief fishing trip?\"  \"Now?\" Barney asked.  \"Yes, now. I believe you understand what I mean ... I see you do. Then, if you'll excuse me for a few minutes--\"         *       *       *       *       *  Barney couldn't have said exactly what he expected to be shown. His imaginings had run in the direction of a camouflaged vault beneath McAllen's house--some massively-walled place with machinery that powered the matter transmitter purring along the walls ... and perhaps something in the style of a plastic diving bell as the specific instrument of transportation.  The actual experience was quite different. McAllen returned shortly, having changed into the familiar outdoor clothing--apparently he had been literal about going on a fishing trip. Barney accompanied the old physicist into the living room, and watched him open a small but very sturdy wall safe. Immediately behind the safe door, an instrument panel had been built in the opening.  Peering over the spectacles, McAllen made careful adjustments on two sets of small dials, and closed and locked the safe again.  \"Now, if you'll follow me, Mr. Chard--\" He crossed the room to a door, opened it, and went out. Barney followed him into a small room with rustic furnishings and painted wooden walls. There was a single, heavily curtained window; the room was rather dim.  \"Well,\" McAllen announced, \"here we are.\"  It took a moment for that to sink in. Then, his scalp prickling eerily, Barney realized he was standing farther from the wall than he had thought. He looked around, and discovered there was no door behind him now, either open or closed.  He managed a shaky grin. \"So that's how your matter transmitter works!\"  \"Well,\" McAllen said thoughtfully, \"of course it isn't really a matter transmitter. I call it the McAllen Tube. Even an educated layman must realize that one can't simply disassemble a living body at one point, reassemble it at another, and expect life to resume. And there are other considerations--\"  \"Where are we?\" Barney asked. \"On Mallorca?\"  \"No. We haven't left the continent--just the state. Look out the window and see for yourself.\"  McAllen turned to a built-in closet, and Barney drew back the window hangings. Outside was a grassy slope, uncut and yellowed by the summer sun. The slope dropped sharply to a quiet lakefront framed by dark pines. There was no one in sight, but a small wooden dock ran out into the lake. At the far end of the dock an old rowboat lay tethered. And--quite obviously--it was no longer the middle of a bright afternoon; the air was beginning to dim, to shift towards evening.  Barney turned to find McAllen's mild, speculative eyes on him, and saw the old man had put a tackle box and fishing rod on the table.  \"Your disclosures disturbed me more than you may have realized,\" McAllen remarked by way of explanation. His lips twitched in the shadow of a smile. \"At such times I find nothing quite so soothing as to drop a line into water for a while. I've got some thinking to do, too. So let's get down to the dock. There ought to be a little bait left in the minnow pail.\"         *       *       *       *       *  When they returned to the cabin some time later, McAllen was in a pensive mood. He started a pot of coffee in the small kitchen, then quickly cleaned the tackle and put it away. Barney sat at the table, smoking and watching him, but made no attempt at conversation.  McAllen poured the coffee, produced sugar and powdered milk, and settled down opposite Barney. He said abruptly, \"Have you had any suspicions about the reason for the secretive mumbo jumbo?\"  \"Yes,\" Barney said, \"I've had "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30140"],["title","Gone Fishing (#3)"],["body","suspicions. But it wasn't until _that_ happened\"--he waved his hand at the wall out of which they appeared to have stepped--\"that I came to a definite conclusion.\"  \"Eh?\" McAllen's eyes narrowed suddenly. \"What was the conclusion?\"  \"That you've invented something that's really a little too good.\"  \"Too good?\" said McAllen. \"Hm-m-m. Go on.\"  \"It doesn't take much power to operate the thing, does it?\"  \"Not,\" said McAllen dryly, \"if you're talking about the kind of power one pays for.\"  \"I am. Can the McAllen Tube be extended to any point on Earth?\"  \"I should think so.\"  \"And you financed the building of this model yourself. Not very expensive. If the secret leaked out, I'd never know who was going to materialize in my home at any time, would I? Or with what intentions.\"  \"That,\" McAllen nodded, \"is about the size of it.\"  Barney crushed out his cigarette, lit a fresh one, blew out a thin streamer of smoke. \"Under the circumstances,\" he remarked, \"it's unfortunate you can't get the thing shut off again, isn't it?\"  McAllen was silent for some seconds. \"So you've guessed that, too,\" he said finally. \"What mistake did I make?\"  \"None that I know of,\" Barney said. \"But you're doing everything you can to keep the world from learning about the McAllen Tube. At the same time you've kept it in operation--which made it just a question of time before somebody else noticed something was going on, as I did. Your plans for the thing appear to have gone wrong.\"  McAllen was nodding glumly. \"They have,\" he said. \"They have, Mr. Chard. Not irreparably wrong, but still--\" He paused. \"The first time I activated the apparatus,\" he said, \"I directed it only at two points. Both of them within structures which were and are my property. It was fortunate I did so.\"  \"That was this cabin and the place on Mallorca?\"  \"Yes. The main operational sections of the Tube are concealed about my California home. But certain controls have to be installed at any exit point to make it possible to return. It wouldn't be easy to keep those hidden in any public place.  \"It wasn't until I compared the actual performance of the Tube with my theoretical calculations that I discovered there was an unforeseen factor involved. To make it short, I could not--to use your phrasing--shut the Tube off again. But that would certainly involve some extremely disastrous phenomena at three different points of our globe.\"  \"Explosions?\" Barney asked.  \"Weee-ll,\" McAllen said judiciously, \"implosions might come a little closer to describing the effect. The exact term isn't contained in our vocabulary, and I'd prefer it _not_ to show up there, at least in my lifetime. But you see my dilemma, don't you? If I asked for help, I revealed the existence of the Tube. Once its existence was known, the research that produced it could be duplicated. As you concluded, it isn't really too difficult a device to construct. And even with the present problem solved, the McAllen Tube is just a little too dangerous a thing to be at large in our world today.\"  \"You feel the problem can be solved?\"  \"Oh, yes.\" McAllen took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes. \"That part of it's only a matter of time. At first I thought I'd have everything worked out within three or four years. Unfortunately I badly underestimated the expense of some of the required experimentation. That's what's delayed everything.\"  \"I see. I had been wondering,\" Barney admitted, \"why a man with something like this on his mind would be putting in _quite_ so much time fishing.\"  McAllen grinned. \"Enforced idleness. It's been very irritating really, Mr. Chard. I've been obliged to proceed in the most inexpensive manner possible, and that meant--very slowly.\"  Barney said, \"If it weren't for that question of funds, how long would it take to wind up the operation?\"  \"A year--perhaps two years.\" McAllen shrugged. \"It's difficult to be too exact, but it certainly wouldn't be longer than two.\"  \"And what would be the financial tab?\"  McAllen hesitated. \"A million is the bottom figure, I'm afraid. It should run closer to a million and a half.\"  \"Doctor,\" Barney said, \"let me make you a proposition.\"         *       *       *       *       *  McAllen looked at him. \"Are you thinking of financing the experiments, Mr. Chard?\"  \"In return,\" Barney said, \"for a consideration.\"  \"What's that?\" McAllen's expression grew wary.  \"When you retired,\" Barney told him, \"I dropped a nice piece of money as a consequence. It was the first beating I'd taken, and it hurt. I'd like to pick that money up again. All right. We're agreed it can't be done on the McAllen Tube. The Tube wouldn't help make the world a safer place for Barney Chard. But the Tube isn't any more remarkable than the mind that created it. Now I know a company which could be top of the heap in electronics precision work--one-shot specialties is what they go in for--if it had your mind as technical advisor. I can buy a controlling interest in that company tomorrow, doctor. And you can have the million and a half paid off in not much more time than you expect to take to get your monster back under control and shut down. Three years of your technical assistance, and we're clear.\"  McAllen's face reddened slowly. \"I've considered hiring out, of course,\" he said. \"Many times. I need the money very badly. But aren't you overlooking something?\"  \"What?\"  \"I went to considerable pains,\" said McAllen, \"to establish myself as a lunatic. It was distasteful, but it seemed necessary to discourage anyone from making too close an investigation of some of my more recent lines of research. If it became known now that I was again in charge of a responsible project--\"  Barney shook his head. \"No problem, doctor. We'd be drawing on outside talent for help in specific matters--very easy to cover up any leads to you personally. I've handled that general sort of thing before.\"  McAllen frowned thoughtfully. \"I see. But I'd have--There wouldn't be so much work that--\"  \"No,\" Barney said. \"I guarantee that you'll have all the time you want for your own problem.\" He smiled. \"Considering what you told me, I'd like to hear that one's been solved myself!\"  McAllen grinned briefly. \"I can imagine. Very well. Ah ... when can you let me have the money, Mr. Chard?\"         *       *       *       *       *  The sun was setting beyond the little lake as Barney drew the shades over the cabin window again. Dr. McAllen was half inside the built-in closet at the moment, fitting a pair of toggle switches to the concealed return device in there.  \"Here we go,\" he said suddenly.  Three feet from the wall of the room the shadowy suggestion of another wall, and of an open door, became visible.  Barney said dubiously, \"We came out of _that_?\"  McAllen looked at him, sad, \"The appearance is different on the exit side. But the Tube's open now--Here, I'll show you.\"  He went up to the apparition of a door, abruptly seemed to melt into it. Barney held his breath, and followed. Again there was no sensory reaction to passing through the Tube. As his foot came down on something solid in the shadowiness into which he stepped, the living room in Sweetwater Beach sprang into sudden existence about him.  \"Seems a little odd from that end, the first time through, doesn't it?\" McAllen remarked.  Barney let out his breath.  \"If I'd been the one who invented the Tube,\" he said honestly, \"I'd never have had the nerve to try it.\"  McAllen grinned. \"Tell you the truth, I did need a drink or two the first time. But it's dead-safe if you know just what you're doing.\"  Which was not, Barney felt, too reassuring. He looked back. The door through which they had come was the one by which they had left. But beyond it now lay a section of the entrance hall of the Sweetwater Beach house.  \"Don't let that fool you,\" said McAllen, following his gaze. \"If you tried to go out into the hall at the moment, you'd find yourself right back in the cabin. Light rays passing through the Tube can be shunted off and on.\" He went over to the door, closed and locked it, dropping the key in his pocket. \"I keep it locked. I don't often have visitors, but if I had one while the door was open it could be embarrassing.\"  \"What about the other end?\" Barney asked. \"The door appeared in the cabin when you turned those switches. What happens now? Suppose someone breaks into the cabin and starts prowling around--is the door still there?\"  McAllen shook his head. \"Not unless that someone happened to break in within the next half-minute.\" He considered. \"Let's put it this way. The Tube's permanently centered on its two exit points, but the effect ordinarily is dissipated over half a mile of the neighborhood at the other end. For practical purposes there is no useful effect. When I'm going to go through, I bring the exit end down to a focus point ... does that make sense? Very well. It remains focused for around sixty or ninety seconds, depending on how I set it; then it expands again.\" He nodded at the locked door. \"In the cabin, that's disappeared by now. Walk through the space where it's been, and you'll notice nothing unusual. Clear?\"  Barney hesitated. \"And if that door were still open here, and somebody attempted to step through after the exit end had expanded--\"  \"Well,\" McAllen said, moving over to a wall buzzer and pressing it, \"that's what I meant when I said it could be embarrassing. He'd get expanded too--disastrously. Could you use a drink, Mr. Chard? I know I want one.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The drinks, served by Fredericks, were based on a rather rough grade of bourbon, but Barney welcomed them. There was an almost sick fascination in what was a certainty now: he was going to get the Tube. That tremendous device was his for the taking. He was well inside McAllen's guard; only carelessness could arouse the old man's suspicions again, and Barney was not going to be careless. No need to hurry anything. He would play the reserved role he had"]]]
