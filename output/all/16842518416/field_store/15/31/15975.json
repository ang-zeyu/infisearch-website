If not, they will produce a landslip on the cliff edge, using power tools and explosives carried for the purpose. That is why the hopper has a crew of three, but the chance of their having to do this is slight.\"  So I should think; ground appearances are supposed to show that _Gilgamesh_ landed using emergency rockets and then toppled over the cliff and this will be exactly what happened.  \"The pilot will carry a one-frequency low-power transmitter activated by the change in magnetic field on leaving the ship. The hopper will remain at five hundred feet until this signal is received. It will then pick up the pilot, check ground appearances, and rendezvous with this ship at two hundred miles up at 18.27 hours.\"  The ship and the hopper both being radar-absorbent will not register on alarm systems, and by keeping to planetary nighttime they should be safe from being seen.  \"Danger (b) will be dealt with as follows. The rocket-mounts being of peltathene will be destroyed by half an hour's immersion in water. The installations in the nose will be destroyed with Andite.\"  Andite produces complete colecular disruption in a very short range, hardly any damage outside it; the effect will be as though the nose broke off on impact; I suppose the Incognitans will waste a lot of time looking for it on the bed of the sea.  \"Four ten-centimeter cartridges will be inserted within the nose installations. The fuse will have two alternative settings. The first will be timed to act at 12.50 hours, seven minutes after the estimated time of landing. It will not be possible to deactivate it before 12.45 hours. This takes care of the possibility of the pilot's becoming incapacitated during the descent.  \"Having switched off the first fuse the pilot will get the ship into position and then activate a second, timed to blow in ten minutes. He will then leave the ship. When the antigrav is destroyed the ship will, of course, fall into the sea.  \"Six. The pilot of _Gilgamesh_ will wear a spacesuit of the pattern used by the original crew and will carry Personal Background Set number 23. Should he fail to escape from the ship the crew of the hopper will on no account attempt to rescue him.\"  The colonel takes up the paper, folds it in half and puts it down one inch further away.  \"The hopper's crew,\" he says, \"will give the whole game away should one of them fall into Incognitan hands, alive or dead. Therefore they don't take any risks of it.\"  He lifts his gaze ceilingwards. \"I'm asking for three volunteers.\"  Silence. Manning the hopper is definitely second best. Then light suddenly bursts on me and I lift my hand and hack B on the ankle.  \"I volunteer,\" I say.  B gives me a most dubious glance and then lifts her hand, too.  Cray on the other side of the table is slowly opening his mouth when there is an outburst of waving on the far side of B.  \"Me too, colonel! I volunteer!\"  Mr. Yardo proceeds to explain that his special job is over and done, he can be more easily spared than anybody, he may be too old to take charge of _Gilgamesh_ but will back himself as a hopper pilot against anybody.  The colonel cuts this short by accepting all three. He then unfolds his paper again.  \"Piloting _Gilgamesh_,\" he says. \"I'm not asking for volunteers now. You'll go to your cabins in four hours' time and those who want to will volunteer, secretly. To a computer hookup, Computer will select on a random basis and notify the one chosen. Give him his final instructions, too. No one need know who it was till it's all over. He can tell anyone he likes, of course.\"  [Illustration]  A very slight note of triumph creeps into the next remark. \"One point. Only men need volunteer.\"  Instant outcry from Kirsty and Dilly: B turns to me with a look of awe.  \"Nothing to do with prejudice,\" says the colonel testily. \"Just facts. The crew of _Gilgamesh_ were all men. Can't risk one solitary woman being found on board. Besides--spacesuits, personal background sets--all designed for men.\"  Kirsty and Dilly turn on me looks designed to shrivel and B whispers \"Lizzie how wonderful you are.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The session dissolves. We three get an intensive session course of instruction on our duties and are ordered off to sleep. After breakfast next morning I run into Cray who says, Before I continue about what is evidently pressing business would I care to kick him, hard?  Not right now I reply, what for anyway?  \"Miss Lee,\" says Cray, dragging it out longer than ever, \"although I have long realized that your brain functions in a way much superior to logic I had not sense enough yesterday to follow my own instinct and do what you do as soon as you did it; therefore that dessicated meat handler got in first.\"  I say: \"So you weren't picked for pilot? It was only one chance in ten.\"  \"Oh,\" says Cray, \"did you really think so?\" He gives me a long look and goes away.  I suppose he noticed that when the colonel came out with his remarks about No women in Gilgamesh I was as surprised as any.  Presently the three of us are issued with protective clothing; we just might have to venture out on the planet's surface and therefore we get white one-piece suits to protect against Cold, heat, moisture, dessication, radioactivity, and mosquitoes, and they are quite becoming, really.  [Illustration]  B and I drag out dressing for thirty minutes; then we just sit while Time crawls asymptotically towards the hour.  Then the speaker calls us to go.  We are out of the cabin before it says two words and racing for the hold; so that we are just in time to see a figure out of an Historical movie--padded, jointed, tin bowl for head and blank reflecting glass where the face should be--stepping through the air lock.  The colonel and Mr. Yardo are there already. The colonel packs us into the hopper and personally closes the door, and for once I know what he is thinking; he is wishing he were not the only pilot in this ship who could possibly rely on bringing the ship off and on Mass-Time at one particular defined spot of Space.  Then he leaves us; half an hour to go.  The light in the hold begins to alter. Instead of being softly diffused it separates into sharp-edged beams, reflecting and crisscrossing but leaving cones of shadow between. The air is being pumped into store.  Fifteen minutes.  The hull vibrates and a hatch slides open in the floor so that the black of Space looks through; it closes again.  Mr. Yardo lifts the hopper gently off its mounts and lets it back again.  Testing; five minutes to go.  I am hypnotized by my chronometer; the hands are crawling through glue; I am still staring at it when, at the exact second, we go off Mass-Time.  No weight. I hook my heels under the seat and persuade my esophagus back into place. A new period of waiting has begun. Every so often comes the impression we are falling head-first; the colonel using ship's drive to decelerate the whole system. Then more free fall.  The hopper drifts very slowly out into the hold and hovers over the hatch, and the lights go. There is only the glow from the visiscreen and the instrument board.  One minute thirty seconds to go.  The hatch slides open again. I take a deep breath.  I am still holding it when the colonel's voice comes over the speaker: \"Calling _Gilgamesh_. Calling the hopper. Good-by and Good luck. You're on your own.\"  The ship is gone.  Yet another stretch of time has been marked off for us. Thirty-seven minutes, the least time allowable if we are not to get overheated by friction with the air. Mr. Yardo is a good pilot; he is concentrating wholly on the visiscreen and the thermometer. B and I are free to look around.  I see nothing and say so.  I did not know or have forgotten that Incognita has many small satellites; from here there are four in sight.         *       *       *       *       *  I am still looking at them when B seizes my arm painfully and points below us.  I see nothing and say so.  B whispers it was there a moment ago, it is pretty cloudy down there--Yes Lizzie there it is _look_.  And I see it. Over to the left, very faint and far below, a pin-prick of light.  Light in the polar wastes of a sparsely inhabited planet, and since we are still five miles up it is a very powerful light too.  No doubt about it, as we descend farther; about fifty miles from our objective there are men, quite a lot of them.  I think it is just then that I understand, _really_ understand, the hazard of what we are doing. This is not an exercise. This is in dead earnest, and if we have missed an essential factor or calculated something wrong the result will be not a bad mark or a failed exam, or even our personal deaths, but incalculable harm and misery to millions of people we never even heard of.  Dead earnest. How in Space did we ever have cheek enough for this?  The lights might be the essential factor we have missed, but there is nothing we can do about them now.  Mr. Yardo suddenly chuckles and points to the screen.  \"There you are, girlies! He's down!\"  There, grayly dim, is the map the colonel showed us; and right on the faint line of the cliff-edge is a small brilliant dot.  The map is expanding rapidly, great lengths of coastline shooting out of sight at the edge of the screen. Mr. Yardo has the cross-hairs centered on the dot which is _Gilgamesh_. The dot is changing shape; it is turning into a short ellipse, a longer one. The gyros are leaning her out over the sea.  I look at my chronometer; 12.50 hours exactly. B looks, too, and grips my hand.  Thirty seconds later the Andite has not blown; first fuse safety turned off. Surely she is leaning far enough out by now?  We are hovering at five hundred feet. I can actually see the white edge of the sea beating at the cliff. Mr. Yardo keeps making small corrections; there is a wind out there trying to blow us away. It is cloudy here: "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30427"],["title","The Lost Kafoozalum (#8)"],["body","can see neither moons nor stars.  Mr. Yardo checks the radio. Nothing yet.  I stare downwards and fancy I can see a metallic gleam.  Then there is a wordless shout from Mr. Yardo; a bright dot hurtles across the screen and at the same time I see a streak of blue flame tearing diagonally downwards a hundred feet away.  The hopper shudders to a flat concussion in the air, we are all thrown off balance, and when I claw my way back to the screen the moving dot is gone.  So is _Gilgamesh_.  B says numbly, \"But it wasn't a meteor. It can't have been.\"  \"It doesn't matter what it was,\" I say. \"It was some sort of missile, I think. They must be even nearer to war than we thought.\"  We wait. What for, I don't know. Another missile, perhaps. No more come.  At last Mr. Yardo stirs. His voice sounds creaky.  \"I guess,\" he says, then clears his throat, and tries again. \"I guess we have to go back up.\"  B says, \"Lizzie, who was it? Do you know?\"  Of course I do. \"Do you think M'Clare was going to risk one of us on that job? The volunteering was a fake. He went himself.\"  B whispers, \"You're just guessing.\"  \"Maybe,\" says Mr. Yardo, \"but I happened to see through that face plate of his. It was the professor all right.\"  He has his hand on the controls when my brain starts working again. I utter a strangled noise and dive for the hatch into the cargo hold. B tries to grab me but I get it open and switch on the light.  Fifty-fifty chance--I've lost.  _No_, this is the one we came in and the people who put in the new cargo did not clear out my fish-boat, they just clamped it neatly to the wall.  I dive in and start to pass up the package. B shakes her head.  \"No, Lizzie. We can't. Don't you remember? If we got caught, it would give everything away. Besides ... there isn't any chance--\"  \"Take a look at the screen,\" I tell her.  Sharp exclamation from Mr. Yardo. B turns to look, then takes the package and helps me back.         *       *       *       *       *  Mr. Yardo maneuvers out over the sea till the thing is in the middle of the screen; then drops to a hundred feet. It is sticking out of the water at a fantastic angle and the waves are hardly moving it. The nose of a ship.  \"The antigrav,\" whispers B. \"The Andite hasn't blown yet.\"  \"Ten minutes,\" says Mr. Yardo thoughtfully. He turns to me with sudden briskness. \"What's that, Lizzie girl? A fish-boat? Good. We may need it. Let's have a look.\"  \"It's mine,\" I tell him.  \"Now look--\"  \"Tailor made,\" I say. \"You might get into it, though I doubt it. You couldn't work the controls.\"  It takes him fifteen seconds to realize there is no way round it; he is six foot three and I am five foot one. Even B would find it hard.  His face goes grayish and he stares at me helplessly. Finally he nods.  \"All right, Lizzie. I guess we have to try it. Things certainly can't be much worse than they are. We'll go over to the beach there.\"  On the beach there is wind and spray and breakers but nothing unmanageable; the cliffs on either side keep off the worst of the force. It is queer to feel moving air after eighteen days in a ship. It takes six minutes to unpack and expand the boat and by that time it is ten minutes since the missile hit and the Andite has not blown.  I crawl into the boat. In my protective clothing it is a fairly tight fit. We agree that I will return to this same point and they will start looking for me in fifty minutes' time and will give up if I have not returned in two hours. I take two Andite cartridges to deal with all eventualities and snap the nose of the boat into place. At first I am very conscious of the two little white cigars in the pouch of my suit, but presently I have other things to think about.  I use the \"limbs\" to crawl the last few yards of shingle into the water and on across the sea bottom till I am beyond the line of breakers; then I turn on the motor. I have already set the controls to \"home\" on _Gilgamesh_ and the radar will steer me off any obstructions. This journey in the dark is as safe as my trip around the reefs before all this started--though it doesn't feel that way.  It takes twelve minutes to reach _Gilgamesh_, or rather the fragment that antigrav is supporting; it is about half a mile from the beach.  The radar stops me six feet from her and I switch it off and turn to Manual and inch closer in.  Lights, a very small close beam. The missile struck her about one third of her length behind the nose. I know, because I can see the whole of that length. It is hanging just above the water, sloping at about 30° to the horizontal. The ragged edge where it was torn from the rest is just dipping into the sea.  If anyone sees this, I don't know what they will make of it but no one could possibly think an ordinary spaceship suffered an ordinary crash, and very little investigation would show up the truth.  I reach up with the forward set of \"limbs\" and grapple on to the break. I now have somehow to get the hind set of \"limbs\" up without losing my grip. I can't.  It takes several minutes to realize that I can just open the nose and crawl out.  Immediately a wave hits me in the face and does its best to drag me into the sea. However the interior of the ship is relatively sheltered and presently I am inside and dragging the boat up out of reach.  I need light. Presently I manage to detach one of the two from the boat. I turn it down to minimum close beam and hang it round my neck; then I start up the black jag-edged tunnel of the ship.  I have to get to the nose, find the fuse, change the setting to twenty minutes--maximum possible--and get out before it blows--out of the water I mean. The fish-boat is not constructed to take explosions even half a mile away. But the first thing is to find the fuse and I cannot make out how _Gilgamesh_ is lying and therefore cannot find the door through this bulkhead; everything is ripped and twisted. In the end I find a gap between the bulkhead itself and the hull, and squeeze through that.  In the next compartment things are more recognizable and I eventually find the door. Fortunately ships are designed so that you can get through doors even when they are in the ceiling; actually here I have to climb up an overhang, but the surface is provided with rungs which make it not too bad. Finally I reach the door. I shall have to use antigrav to get down ... why didn't I just turn it on and jump? I forgot I had it.  The door was a little way open when the missile struck; it buckled in its grooves and is jammed fast. I can get an arm through. No more. I switch on antigrav and hang there directing the light round the compartment. No rents anywhere, just buckling. This compartment is divided by a partition and the door through that is open. There will be another door into the nose on the other side.  I bring back my feet ready to kick off on a dive through that doorway.  Behind me, something stirs.         *       *       *       *       *  My muscles go into a spasm like the one that causes a falling dream, my hold tears loose and I go tumbling through the air, rebound from a wall, twist, and manage to hook one foot in the frame of the door I was aiming for. I pull myself down and turn off the antigrav; then I just shake for a bit.  The sound was--  This is stupid, with everything torn to pieces in this ship there is no wonder if bits shake loose and drop around--  But it was not a metallic noise, it was a kind of soft dragging, very soft, that ended in a little thump.  Like a--  Like a loose piece of plastic dislodged from its angle of rest and slithering down, pull yourself together Lizzie Lee.  I look through the door into the other half of this level. Shambles. Smashed machinery every which way, blocking the door, blocking everything. No way through at all.  Suddenly I remember the tools. Mr. Yardo loaded the fish-boat with all it would take. I crawl back and return with a fifteen inch expanding beam-lever, and overuse it; the jammed trap door does not slide back in its grooves but flips right out of them, bent double; it flies off into the dark and clangs its way to rest.  I am halfway through the opening when I hear the sound again. A soft slithering; a faint defeated thump.  I freeze where I am, and then I hear the sigh; a long, long weary sound, almost musical.  An air leak somewhere in the hull and wind or waves altering the air pressure below.  All the same I do not seem able to come any farther through this door.  Light might help; I turn the beam up and play it cautiously around. This is the last compartment, right in the nose; a sawn-off cone-shape. No breaks here, though the hull is buckled to my left and the \"floor\"--the partition, horizontal when the ship is in the normal operating position, which holds my trap door--is torn up; some large heavy object was welded to a thin surface skin which has ripped away leaving jagged edges and a pattern of girders below.  There is no dust here; it has all been sucked out when the ship was open to space; nothing to show the beam except the sliding yellow ellipse where it touches the wall. It glides and turns, spiraling down, deformed every so often where it crosses a projection or a dent, till it halts suddenly on a spoked disk, four feet across and standing nearly eighteen inches out from the wall. The antigrav.  I never saw one this size, it is like the little personal affairs as a giant is like a pigmy, not only bigger but a bit different in proportion. I can see an Andite cartridge fastened among the spokes.  The fuse is a \"sympathizer\" but it is probably somewhere close. The ellipse moves again. There is no feeling that I control it; it is hunting on its own. To and fro around the giant wheel. Lower. It halts on a small flat box, also bolted to the wall, a little way below. This is it, I can see the dial.  The ellipse stands still, surrounding the fuse. There is something at the very edge of it.  When _Gilgamesh_ was right way up the antigrav was bolted to one"]]]
