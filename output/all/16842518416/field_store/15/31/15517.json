But to science     fiction writers, that would be practically in the heart of Times     Square. When a man of the future wants solitude he picks a slab of     rock floating in space four light years east of Andromeda. Here is a     gentle little story about a man who sought the solitude of such a     location. And who did he take along for company? None other than     Charles the Robot._   Mark Rogers was a prospector, and he went to the asteroid belt looking for radioactives and rare metals. He searched for years, never finding much, hopping from fragment to fragment. After a time he settled on a slab of rock half a mile thick.  Rogers had been born old, and he didn't age much past a point. His face was white with the pallor of space, and his hands shook a little. He called his slab of rock Martha, after no girl he had ever known.  He made a little strike, enough to equip Martha with an air pump and a shack, a few tons of dirt and some water tanks, and a robot. Then he settled back and watched the stars.  The robot he bought was a standard-model all-around worker, with built-in memory and a thirty-word vocabulary. Mark added to that, bit by bit. He was something of a tinkerer, and he enjoyed adapting his environment to himself.  At first, all the robot could say was \"Yes, sir,\" and \"No, sir.\" He could state simple problems: \"The air pump is laboring, sir.\" \"The corn is budding, sir.\" He could perform a satisfactory salutation: \"Good morning, sir.\"  Mark changed that. He eliminated the \"sirs\" from the robot's vocabulary; equality was the rule on Mark's hunk of rock. Then he dubbed the robot Charles, after a father he had never known.  As the years passed, the air pump began to labor a little as it converted the oxygen in the planetoid's rock into a breathable atmosphere. The air seeped into space, and the pump worked a little harder, supplying more.  The crops continued to grow on the tamed black dirt of the planetoid. Looking up, Mark could see the sheer blackness of the river of space, the floating points of the stars. Around him, under him, overhead, masses of rock drifted, and sometimes the starlight glinted from their black sides. Occasionally, Mark caught a glimpse of Mars or Jupiter. Once he thought he saw Earth.  Mark began to tape new responses into Charles. He added simple responses to cue words. When he said, \"How does it look?\" Charles would answer, \"Oh, pretty good, I guess.\"  At first the answers were what Mark had been answering himself, in the long dialogue held over the years. But, slowly, he began to build a new personality into Charles.  Mark had always been suspicious and scornful of women. But for some reason he didn't tape the same suspicion into Charles. Charles' outlook was quite different.         *       *       *       *       *  \"What do you think of girls?\" Mark would ask, sitting on a packing case outside the shack, after the chores were done.  \"Oh, I don't know. You have to find the right one.\" The robot would reply dutifully, repeating what had been put on its tape.  \"I never saw a good one yet,\" Mark would say.  \"Well, that's not fair. Perhaps you didn't look long enough. There's a girl in the world for every man.\"  \"You're a romantic!\" Mark would say scornfully. The robot would pause--a built-in pause--and chuckle a carefully constructed chuckle.  \"I dreamed of a girl named Martha once,\" Charles would say. \"Maybe if I would have looked, I would have found her.\"  And then it would be bedtime. Or perhaps Mark would want more conversation. \"What do you think of girls?\" he would ask again, and the discussion would follow its same course.  [Illustration]  Charles grew old. His limbs lost their flexibility, and some of his wiring started to corrode. Mark would spend hours keeping the robot in repair.  \"You're getting rusty,\" he would cackle.  \"You're not so young yourself,\" Charles would reply. He had an answer for almost everything. Nothing involved, but an answer.  It was always night on Martha, but Mark broke up his time into mornings, afternoons and evenings. Their life followed a simple routine. Breakfast, from vegetables and Mark's canned store. Then the robot would work in the fields, and the plants grew used to his touch. Mark would repair the pump, check the water supply, and straighten up the immaculate shack. Lunch, and the robot's chores were usually finished.         *       *       *       *       *  The two would sit on the packing case and watch the stars. They would talk until supper, and sometimes late into the endless night.  In time, Mark built more complicated conversations into Charles. He couldn't give the robot free choice, of course, but he managed a pretty close approximation of it. Slowly, Charles' personality emerged. But it was strikingly different from Mark's.  Where Mark was querulous, Charles was calm. Mark was sardonic, Charles was naive. Mark was a cynic, Charles was an idealist. Mark was often sad; Charles was forever content.  And in time, Mark forgot he had built the answers into Charles. He accepted the robot as a friend, of about his own age. A friend of long years' standing.  \"The thing I don't understand,\" Mark would say, \"is why a man like you wants to live here. I mean, it's all right for me. No one cares about me, and I never gave much of a damn about anyone. But why you?\"  \"Here I have a whole world,\" Charles would reply, \"where on Earth I had to share with billions. I have the stars, bigger and brighter than on Earth. I have all space around me, close, like still waters. And I have you, Mark.\"  \"Now, don't go getting sentimental on me--\"  \"I'm not. Friendship counts. Love was lost long ago, Mark. The love of a girl named Martha, whom neither of us ever met. And that's a pity. But friendship remains, and the eternal night.\"  \"You're a bloody poet,\" Mark would say, half admiringly. \"A poor poet.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Time passed unnoticed by the stars, and the air pump hissed and clanked and leaked. Mark was fixing it constantly, but the air of Martha became increasingly rare. Although Charles labored in the fields, the crops, deprived of sufficient air, died.  Mark was tired now, and barely able to crawl around, even without the grip of gravity. He stayed in his bunk most of the time. Charles fed him as best he could, moving on rusty, creaking limbs.  \"What do you think of girls?\"  \"I never saw a good one yet.\"  \"Well, that's not fair.\"  Mark was too tired to see the end coming, and Charles wasn't interested. But the end was on its way. The air pump threatened to give out momentarily. There hadn't been any food for days.  [Illustration]  \"But why you?\" Gasping in the escaping air. Strangling.  \"Here I have a whole world--\"  \"Don't get sentimental--\"  \"And the love of a girl named Martha.\"  From his bunk Mark saw the stars for the last time. Big, bigger than ever, endlessly floating in the still waters of space.  \"The stars ...\" Mark said.  \"Yes?\"  \"The sun?\"  \"--shall shine as now.\"  \"A bloody poet.\"  \"A poor poet.\"  \"And girls?\"  \"I dreamed of a girl named Martha once. Maybe if--\"  \"What do you think of girls? And stars? And Earth?\" And it was bedtime, this time forever.  Charles stood beside the body of his friend. He felt for a pulse once, and allowed the withered hand to fall. He walked to a corner of the shack and turned off the tired air pump.  The tape that Mark had prepared had a few cracked inches left to run. \"I hope he finds his Martha,\" the robot croaked, and then the tape broke.  His rusted limbs would not bend, and he stood frozen, staring back at the naked stars. Then he bowed his head.  \"The Lord is my shepherd,\" Charles said. \"I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; he leadeth me ...\"     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ Oct.-Nov. 1953.

The fear led to a hate that threatened the lives of   millions and endangered the Galactic peace._     CHAPTER I   The little Med Ship came out of overdrive and the stars were strange and the Milky Way seemed unfamiliar. Which, of course, was because the Milky Way and the local Cepheid marker-stars were seen from an unaccustomed angle and a not-yet-commonplace pattern of varying magnitudes. But Calhoun grunted in satisfaction. There was a banded sun off to port, which was good. A breakout at no more than sixty light-hours from one's destination wasn't bad, in a strange sector of the Galaxy and after three light-years of journeying blind.  [Illustration]  \"Arise and shine, Murgatroyd,\" said Calhoun. \"Comb your whiskers. Get set to astonish the natives!\"  A sleepy, small, shrill voice said;  \"_Chee!_\"  Murgatroyd the _tormal_ came crawling out of his small cubbyhole. He blinked at Calhoun.  \"We're due to land shortly,\" Calhoun observed. \"You'll impress the local inhabitants. I'll be unpopular. According to the records, there's been no Med Ship inspection here for twelve standard years. And that was practically no inspection, to judge by the report.\"  Murgatroyd said;  \"_Chee-chee!_\"  He began to make his toilet, first licking his right-hand whiskers and then his left. Then he stood up and shook himself and looked interestedly at Calhoun. _Tormals_ are companionable small animals. They are charmed when somebody speaks to them. They find great, deep satisfaction in imitating the actions of humans, as parrots and mynahs and parrokets imitate human speech. But _tormals_ have certain useful, genetically transmitted talents which make them much more valuable than mere companions or pets.  Calhoun got a light-reading for the banded sun. It could hardly be an accurate measure of distance, but it was a guide. He said;  \"Hold on to something, Murgatroyd!\"  Calhoun threw the overdrive switch and the Med Ship flicked back into that questionable state of being in which velocities of some hundreds of times that of light are possible. The sensation of going into overdrive was unpleasant. A moment later, the sensation of coming out was no less so. Calhoun had experienced it often enough, and still didn't like it.  The sun Weald burned huge and terrible in space. It was close, now. Its disk covered half a degree of arc.  \"Very neat,\" observed Calhoun. \"Weald Three is our port, Murgatroyd. The plane of the ecliptic would be--Hm....\"  He swung the outside electron telescope, picked up a nearby bright object, enlarged its image to show details, and checked it against the local star-pilot. He calculated a moment. The distance was too short for even the briefest of overdrive hops, but it would take time to get there on solar-system drive.  He thumbed down the communicator-button and spoke into a microphone.  \"Med Ship Aesclipus Twenty reporting arrival and asking coördinates for landing. Purpose of landing, planetary health inspection. Our mass is fifty tons standard. We should arrive at a landing position in something under four hours. Repeat. Med Ship Aesclipus Twenty ...\"  He finished the regular second transmission and made coffee for himself while he waited for an answer. Murgatroyd wanted a cup of coffee too. Murgatroyd adored coffee. He held a tiny cup in a furry small paw and sipped gingerly at the hot liquid.         *       *       *       *       *  A voice came out of the communicator;  \"_Aesclipus Twenty, repeat your identification!_\"  Calhoun went to the control-board.  \"Aesclipus Twenty,\" he said patiently, \"is a Med Ship, sent by the Interstellar Medical Service to make a planetary health inspection on Weald. Check with your public health authorities. This is the first Med Ship visit in twelve standard years, I believe, which is inexcusable. But your health authorities will know all about it. Check with them.\"  The voice said truculently;  \"_What was your last port?_\"  Calhoun named it. This was not his home sector, but Sector Twelve had gotten into a very bad situation. Some of its planets had gone unvisited for as long as twenty years, and twelve between inspections was almost common-place. Other sectors had been called on to help it catch up. Calhoun was one of the loaned Med Ship men, and because of the emergency he'd been given a list of half a dozen planets to be inspected one after another, instead of reporting back to sector headquarters after each visit. He'd had minor troubles before with landing-grid operators in Sector Twelve.  So he was very patient. He named the planet last inspected, the one from which he'd set out for Weald Three. The voice from the communicator said sharply;  \"_What port before that?_\"  Calhoun named the one before the last.  \"_Don't drive any closer,_\" said the voice harshly, \"_or you'll be destroyed!_\"  Calhoun said coldly;  \"Now you listen to me, friend! I'm from the Interstellar Medical Service! You get in touch with planetary health services immediately! Remind them of the Interstellar Medical Inspection Agreement, signed on Tralee two hundred and forty standard years ago. Remind them that if they do not cooperate in medical inspection that I can put your planet under quarantine and your space commerce will be cut off like that! No ship will be cleared for Weald from any other planet in the galaxy until there has been a health inspection! Things have pretty well gone to pot so far as the Med Service in this sector is concerned, but we're trying to straighten it out. You have twenty minutes to clear this and then, I'm coming in. If I'm not landed, a quarantine goes on! Tell your health authorities that!\"  Silence. Calhoun clicked off and poured himself another cup of coffee. Murgatroyd held out his cup for a refill. Calhoun gave it to him.  \"I hate to put on an official hat, Murgatroyd,\" he said annoyedly, \"but there are some people who won't have any other way.\"  Murgatroyd said \"_Chee!_\" and sipped at his cup.         *       *       *       *       *  Calhoun checked the course of the Med Ship. It bored on through space. There were tiny noises from the communicator. There were whisperings and rustlings and the occasional strange and sometimes beautiful musical notes whose origin is yet obscure, but which, since they are carried by electromagnetic radiation of wildly varying wave-lengths, are not likely to be the fabled music of the spheres. He waited.         *       *       *       *       *  In fifteen minutes a different voice came from the speaker.  \"_Med Ship Aesclipus! Med Ship Aesclipus!_\"  Calhoun answered and the voice said anxiously;  \"_'Sorry about the challenge, but we have the blueskin problem always with us. We have to be extremely careful! Will you come in, please?_\"  \"I'm on my way,\" said Calhoun.  \"_The planetary health authorities,_\" said the voice, more anxiously still, \"_are very anxious to be coöperative. We need Med Service help! We lose a lot of sleep over the blueskins! Could you tell us the name of the last Med Ship to land here, and its inspector, and when that inspection was made? We want to look up the record of the event to be able to assist you in every possible way._\"  \"He's lying,\" Calhoun told Murgatroyd, \"but he's more scared than hostile.\"  He picked up the order-folio on Weald Three. He gave the information about the last Med Ship visit. He clicked off.  \"What?\" he asked, \"is a blueskin?\"  He'd read the folio on Weald, of course, but as the ship swam onward through emptiness he went through it again. The last medical inspection had been only perfunctory. Twelve years earlier--instead of three--a Med Ship had landed on Weald. There had been official conferences with health officials. There was a report on the birth-rate, the death-rate, the anomaly-rate, and a breakdown of all reported communicable diseases. But that was all. There were no special comments and no overall picture.  Presently Calhoun found the word in a Sector dictionary, where words of only local usage were to be found.  \"Blueskin; Colloquial term for a person recovered from a plague which left large patches of blue pigment irregularly distributed over the body. Especially, inhabitants of Dara. The condition is said to be caused by a chronic, non-fatal form of Dara plague and has been said to be non-infectious, though this is not certain. The etiology of Dara plague has not fully been worked out. The blueskin condition is hereditary but not a genetic modification, as markings appear in non-Mendellian distributions....\"  Calhoun puzzled over it. Nobody could have read the entire Sector directory, even with unlimited leisure during travel between solar systems. Calhoun hadn't tried. But now he went laboriously through indices and cross-references while the ship continued travel onward. He found no other reference to blueskins. He looked up Dara. It was listed as an inhabited planet, some four hundred years colonized, with a landing-grid and at the time the main notice was written out, a flourishing interstellar commerce. But there was a memo, evidently added to the entry in some change of editions.  \"Since plague, special license from Med Service is required for landing.\"  That was all. Absolutely all.  The communicator said suavely;  \"_Med Ship Aesclipus Twenty! Come in on vision, please!_\"  Calhoun went to the control-board and threw on vision.  \"Well, what now?\" he demanded.  His screen lighted. A bland face looked out at him.  \"_We have--ah--verified your statements,_\" said the third voice from Weald. \"_Just one more item. Are you alone in your ship?_\"  \"Of course,\" said Calhoun, frowning.  \""]]]
