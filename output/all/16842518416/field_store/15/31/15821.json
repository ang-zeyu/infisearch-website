Finally, it is a great characteristic of fungi in general that they are very rapid in growth, and rapid in decay. In a night a puffball will grow prodigiously, and in the same short period a mass of paste may be covered with mould. In a few hours a gelatinous mass of _Reticularia_ will pass into a bladder of dust, or a _Coprinus_ will be dripping into decay. Remembering this, mycophagists will take note that a fleshy fungus which may be good eating at noon may undergo such changes in a few hours as to be anything but good eating at night. Many instances have been recorded of the rapidity of growth in fungi; it may also be accepted as an axiom that they are, in many instances, equally as rapid in decay.  The affinity between lichens and fungi has long been recognized to its full and legitimate extent by lichenologists and mycologists.[I] In the \"Introduction to Cryptogamic Botany,\" it was proposed to unite them in one alliance, under the name of _Mycetales_, in the same manner as the late Dr. Lindley had united allied orders under alliances in his \"Vegetable Kingdom;\" but, beyond this, there was no predisposition towards the theory since propounded, and which, like all new theories, has collected a small but zealous circle of adherents. It will be necessary briefly to summarize this theory and the arguments by which it is supported and opposed, inasmuch as it is intimately connected with our subject.  As recently as 1868, Professor Schwendener first propounded his views,[J] and then briefly and vaguely, that all and every individual lichen was but an algal, which had collected about it a parasitic fungal growth, and that those peculiar bodies which, under the name of _gonidia_, were considered as special organs of lichens, were only imprisoned algæ. In language which the Rev. J. M. Crombie[K] describes as \"pictorial,\" this author gave the general conclusion at which he had arrived, as follows:--\"As the result of my researches, all these growths are not simple plants, not individuals in the usual sense of the term; they are rather colonies, which consist of hundreds and thousands of individuals, of which, however, only one acts as master, while the others, in perpetual captivity, provide nourishment for themselves and their master. This master is a fungus of the order _Ascomycetes_, a parasite which is accustomed to live upon the work of others; its slaves are green algæ, which it has sought out, or indeed caught hold of, and forced into its service. It surrounds them, as a spider does its prey, with a fibrous net of narrow meshes, which is gradually converted into an impenetrable covering. While, however, the spider sucks its prey and leaves it lying dead, the fungus incites the algæ taken in its net to more rapid activity; nay, to more vigorous increase.\" This hypothesis, ushered upon the world with all the prestige of the Professor's name, was not long in meeting with adherents, and the cardinal points insisted upon were--1st. That the generic relationship of the coloured \"gonidia\" to the colourless filaments which compose the lichen thallus, had only been assumed, and not proved; 2nd. That the membrane of the gonidia was chemically different from the membrane of the other tissues, inasmuch as the first had a reaction corresponding to that of algæ, whilst the second had that of fungi; 3rd. That the different forms and varieties of gonidia corresponded with parallel types of algæ; 4th. That as the germination of the spore had not been followed further than the development of a hypothallus, it might be accounted for by the absence of the essential algal on which the new organism should become parasitic; 5th. That there is a striking correspondence between the development of the fruit in lichens and in some of the sporidiiferous fungi (_Pyrenomycetes_).  These five points have been combated incessantly by lichenologists, who would really be supposed by ordinary minds to be the most practically acquainted with the structure and development of these plants, in opposition to the theorists. It is a fact which should have some weight, that no lichenologist of repute has as yet accepted the theory. In 1873 Dr. E. Bornet[L] came to the aid of Schwendener, and almost exhausted the subject, but failed to convince either the practised lichenologist or mycologist. The two great points sought to be established are these, that what we call lichens are compound organisms, not simple, independent vegetable entities; and that this compound organism consists of unicellular algæ, with a fungus parasitic upon them. The coloured gonidia which are found in the substance, or thallus of lichens, are the supposed algæ; and the cellular structure which surrounds, encloses, and imprisons the gonidia is the parasitic fungus, which is parasitic on something infinitely smaller than itself, and which it entirely and absolutely isolates from all external influences.  Dr. Bornet believed himself to have established that every gonidium of a lichen may be referred to a species of algæ, and that the connection between the hypha and gonidia is of such a nature as to exclude all possibility of the one organ being produced by the other. This he thinks is the only way in which it can be accounted for that the gonidia of diverse lichens should be almost identical.  Dr. Nylander, in referring to this hypothesis of an imprisoned algal,[M] writes: \"The absurdity of such an hypothesis is evident from the very consideration that it cannot be the case that an organ (gonidia) should at the same time be a parasite on the body of which it exercises vital functions; for with equal propriety it might be contended that the liver or the spleen constitutes parasites of the mammiferæ. Parasite existence is autonomous, living upon a foreign body, of which nature prohibits it from being at the same time an organ. This is an elementary axiom of general physiology. But observation directly made teaches that the green matter originally arises within the primary chlorophyll- or phycochrom-bearing cellule, and consequently is not intruded from any external quarter, nor arises in any way from any parasitism of any kind. The cellule at first is observed to be empty, and then, by the aid of secretion, green matter is gradually produced in the cavity and assumes a definite form. It can, therefore, be very easily and evidently demonstrated that the origin of green matter in lichens is entirely the same as in other plants.\" On another occasion, and in another place, the same eminent lichenologist remarks,[N] as to the supposed algoid nature of gonidia--\"that such an unnatural existence as they would thus pass, enclosed in a prison and deprived of all autonomous liberty, is not at all consonant with the manner of existence of the other algæ, and that it has no parallel in nature, for nothing physiologically analogous occurs anywhere else. Krempelhuber has argued that there are no conclusive reasons against the assumption that the lichen-gonidia may be self-developed organs of the lichen proper rather than algæ, and that these gonidia can continue to vegetate separately, and so be mistaken for unicellular algæ.\" In this Th. Fries seems substantially to concur. But there is one strong argument, or rather a repetition of an argument already cited, placed in a much stronger light, which is employed by Nylander in the following words:--\"So far are what are called algæ, according to the turbid hypothesis of Schwendener, from constituting true algæ, that on the contrary it may be affirmed that they have a lichenose nature, whence it follows that these pseudo-algæ are in a systematic arrangement to be referred rather to the lichens, and that the class of algæ hitherto so vaguely limited should be circumscribed by new and truer limits.\"  As to another phase in this question, there are, as Krempelhuber remarks, species of lichens which in many countries do not fructify, and whose propagation can only be carried on by means of the soredia, and the hyphæ of such could in themselves alone no more serve for propagation than the hyphæ from the pileus or stalk of an Agaric, while it is highly improbable that they could acquire this faculty by interposition of a foreign algal. On the other hand he argues: \"It is much more conformable to nature that the gonidia, as self-developed organs of the lichens, should, like the spores, enable the hyphæ proceeding from them to propagate the individual.\"[O]  A case in point has been adduced[P] in which gonidia were produced by the hypha, and the genus _Emericella_,[Q] which is allied to _Husseia_ in the _Trichogastres_, shows a structure in the stem exactly resembling _Palmella botryoides_ of Greville, and to what occurs in _Synalyssa_. _Emericella_, with one or two other genera, must, however, be considered as connecting _Trichogastres_ with lichens, and the question cannot be considered as satisfactorily decided till a series of experiments has been made on the germination of lichen spores and their relation to free algæ considered identical with gonidia. Mr. Thwaites was the first to point out[R] the relation of the gonidia in the different sections of lichens to different types of supposed algæ. The question cannot be settled by mere _à priori_ notions. It is, perhaps, worthy of remark that in _Chionyphe Carteri_ the threads grow over the cysts exactly as the hypha of lichens is represented as growing over the gonidia.  Recently, Dr. Thwaites has communicated his views on one phase of this controversy,[S] which will serve to illustrate the question as seen from the mycological side. As is well known, this writer has had considerable experience in the study of the anatomy and physiology of all the lower cryptogamia, and any suggestion of his on such a subject will at least commend itself to a patient consideration.  \"According to our experience,\" he "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30181"],["title","Fungi: Their Nature and Uses (#4)"],["body","writes, \"I think parasitic fungi invariably produce a sad effect upon the tissues they fix themselves upon or in. These tissues become pale in colour, and in every respect sickly in appearance. But who has ever seen the gonidia of lichens the worse for having the 'hypha' growing amongst them? These gonidia are always in the plumpest state, and with the freshest, healthiest colour possible. Cannot it enter into the heads of these most patient and excellent observers, that a cryptogamic plant may have two kinds of tissue growing side by side, without the necessity of one being parasitic upon the other, just as one of the higher plants may have half a dozen kinds of tissue making up its organization? The beautifully symmetrical growth of the same lichens has seemed to me a sufficient argument against one portion being parasitic upon another, but when we see all harmony and robust health, the idea that one portion is subsisting parasitically upon another appears to me to be a perfect absurdity.\"  It appears to us that a great deal of confusion and a large number of errors which creep into our modern generalizations and hypotheses, may be traced to the acceptance of analogies for identities. How many cases of mistaken identity has the improvement of microscopes revealed during the past quarter of a century. This should at least serve as a caution for the future.  Apart, however, from the \"gonidia,\" whatever they may be, is the remainder of the lichen a genuine fungus? Nylander writes, \"The anatomical filamentose elements of lichens are distinguished by various characters from the hyphæ of fungi. They are firmer, elastic, and at once present themselves in the texture of lichens. On the other hand, the hyphæ of fungi are very soft, they possess a thin wall, and are not at all gelatinous, while they are immediately dissolved by the application of hydrate of potash, &c.\"[T]  Our own experience is somewhat to the effect, that there are some few lichens which are doubtful as to whether they are fungi or lichens, but, in by far the majority of cases, there is not the slightest difficulty in determining, from the peculiar firmness and elasticity of the tissues, minute peculiarities which the practised hand can detect rather than describe, and even the general character of the fruit that they differ materially from, though closely allied to fungi. We have only experience to guide us in these matters, but that is something, and we have no experience in fungi of anything like a _Cladonia_, however much it may resemble a _Torrubia_ or _Clavaria_. We have _Pezizæ_ with a subiculum in the section _Tapesia_, but the veriest tyro would not confound them with species of _Parmelia_. It is true that a great number of lichens, at first sight, and casually, resemble species of the _Hysteriacei_, but it is no less strange than true, that lichenologists and mycologists know their own sufficiently not to commit depredations on each other.  Contributions are daily being made to this controversy, and already the principal arguments on both sides have appeared in an English dress,[U] hence it will be unnecessary to repeat those which are modifications only of the views already stated, our own conclusions being capable of a very brief summary: that lichens and fungi are closely related the one to the other, but that they are not identical; that the \"gonidia\" of lichens are part of the lichen-organization, and consequently are not algæ, or any introduced bodies; that there is no parasitism; and that the lichen thallus, exclusive of gonidia, is wholly unknown amongst fungi.  The Rev. J. M. Crombie has therefore our sympathies in the remark with which his summary of the gonidia controversy closes, in which he characterizes it as a \"sensational romance of lichenology,\" of the \"unnatural union between a captive algal damsel and a tyrant fungal master.\"     [A] De Bary, \"Des Myxomycètes,\" in \"Ann. des Sci. Nat.\" 4 sér. xi. p.        153; \"Bot. Zeit.\" xvi. p. 357. De Bary's views are controverted        by M. Wigand in \"Ann. des Sci. Nat.\" 4 sér. (Bot.) xvi. p. 255,        &c.

[H] Gray, \"Notices of Insects which form the Basis of Fungoid        Parasites.\"     [I] On the relation or connection between fungi and lichens, H. C.        Sorby has some pertinent remarks in his communication to the        Royal Society on \"Comparative Vegetable Chromatology\"        (Proceedings Royal Society, vol. xxi. 1873, p. 479), as one        result of his spectroscopic examinations. He says, \"Such being        the relations between the organs of reproduction and the        foliage, it is to some extent possible to understand the        connection between parasitic plants like fungi, which do not        derive their support from the constructive energy of their        fronds, and those which are self-supporting and possess true        fronds. In the highest classes of plants the flowers are        connected with the leaves, more especially by means of        xanthophyll and yellow xanthophyll, whereas in the case of        lichens the apothecia contain very little, if any, of those        substances, but a large amount of the lichenoxanthines so        characteristic of the class. Looking upon fungi from this        chromatological point of view, they bear something like the        same relation to lichens that the petals of a leafless        parasitic plant would bear to the foliage of one of normal        character--that is to say, they are, as it were, the coloured        organs of reproduction of parasitic plants of a type closely        approaching that of lichens, which, of course, is in very        close, if not in absolute agreement with the conclusions drawn        by botanists from entirely different data.\"     [J] Schwendener, \"Untersuchungen über den Flechtenthallus.\"     [K] Crombie (J.

Without some knowledge of the structure of fungi, it is scarcely possible to comprehend the principles of classification, or to appreciate the curious phenomena of polymorphism. Yet there is so great a variety in the structure of the different groups, that this subject cannot be compressed within a few paragraphs, neither do we think that this would be desired if practicable, seeing that the anatomy and physiology of plants is, in itself, sufficiently important and interesting to warrant a rather extended and explicit survey. In order to impart as much practical utility as possible to this chapter, it seems advisable to treat some of the most important and typical orders and suborders separately, giving prominence to the features which are chiefly characteristic of those sections, following the order of systematists as much as possible, whilst endeavouring to render each section independent to a considerable extent, and complete in itself. Some groups naturally present more noteworthy features than others, and will consequently seem to receive more than their proportional share of attention, but this seeming inequality could scarcely have been avoided, inasmuch as hitherto some groups have been more closely investigated than others, are more intimately associated with other questions, or are more readily and satisfactorily examined under different aspects of their life-history.  [Illustration: FIG. 1.--Agaric in Process of Growth.]  AGARICINI.--For the structure that prevails in the order to which the mushroom belongs, an examination of that species will be almost sufficient. Here we shall at once recognize three distinct parts requiring elucidation, viz. the rooting slender fibres that traverse the soil, and termed the _mycelium_, or spawn, the stem and cap or pileus, which together constitute what is called the _hymenophore_, and the plates or gills on the under surface of the cap, which bear the _hymenium_. The earliest condition in which the mushroom can be recognized as a vegetable entity is in that of the \"spawn\" or mycelium, which is essentially an agglomeration of vegetating spores. Its normal form is that of branched, slender, entangled, anastomosing, hyaline threads. At certain privileged points of the mycelium, the threads seem to be aggregated, and become centres of vertical extension. At first only a small nearly globose budding, like a grain of mustard seed, is visible, but this afterwards increases rapidly, and other similar buddings or swellings appear at the base.[A] These are the young hymenophore. As it pushes through the soil, it gradually loses its globose form, becomes more or less elongated, and "]]]
