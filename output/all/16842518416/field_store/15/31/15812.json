The same result is obtained for rays of light advancing in any other direction whatsoever. Of cause this is not surprising, since the equations of the Lorentz transformation were derived conformably to this point of view.   XII.  THE BEHAVIOUR OF MEASURING-RODS AND CLOCKS IN MOTION  Place a metre-rod in the _x′_-axis of _K′_ in such a manner that one end (the beginning) coincides with the point _x′_ = 0 whilst the other end (the end of the rod) coincides with the point _x′_ = 1. What is the length of the metre-rod relatively to the system _K_? In order to learn this, we need only ask where the beginning of the rod and the end of the rod lie with respect to _K_ at a particular time _t_ of the system _K_. By means of the first equation of the Lorentz transformation the values of these two points at the time _t_ = 0 can be shown to be  image006   the distance between the points being  image007   But the metre-rod is moving with the velocity _v_ relative to _K_. It therefore follows that the length of a rigid metre-rod moving in the direction of its length with a velocity _v_ is  image008   of a metre. The rigid rod is thus shorter when in motion than when at rest, and the more quickly it is moving, the shorter is the rod. For the velocity _v_ = _c_ we should have  image009   and for still greater velocities the square-root becomes imaginary. From this we conclude that in the theory of relativity the velocity _c_ plays the part of a limiting velocity, which can neither be reached nor exceeded by any real body.  Of course this feature of the velocity _c_ as a limiting velocity also clearly follows from the equations of the Lorentz transformation, for these became meaningless if we choose values of _v_ greater than _c_.  If, on the contrary, we had considered a metre-rod at rest in the _x_-axis with respect to _K_, then we should have found that the length of the rod as judged from _K′_ would have been  image010   this is quite in accordance with the principle of relativity which forms the basis of our considerations.  _A priori_ it is quite clear that we must be able to learn something about the physical behaviour of measuring-rods and clocks from the equations of transformation, for the magnitudes _z, y, x, t_, are nothing more nor less than the results of measurements obtainable by means of measuring-rods and clocks. If we had based our considerations on the Galileian transformation we should not have obtained a contraction of the rod as a consequence of its motion.  Let us now consider a seconds-clock which is permanently situated at the origin (_x′_ = 0) of _K′_. _t′_ = 0 and _t′_ = 1 are two successive ticks of this clock. The first and fourth equations of the Lorentz transformation give for these two ticks:  _t_ = 0  and  image011   As judged from _K_, the clock is moving with the velocity _v_; as judged from this reference-body, the time which elapses between two strokes of the clock is not one second, but  image012   seconds, _i.e._ a somewhat larger time. As a consequence of its motion the clock goes more slowly than when at rest. Here also the velocity _c_ plays the part of an unattainable limiting velocity.   XIII.  THEOREM OF THE ADDITION OF VELOCITIES. THE EXPERIMENT OF FIZEAU  Now in practice we can move clocks and measuring-rods only with velocities that are small compared with the velocity of light; hence we shall hardly be able to compare the results of the previous section directly with the reality. But, on the other hand, these results must strike you as being very singular, and for that reason I shall now draw another conclusion from the theory, one which can easily be derived from the foregoing considerations, and which has been most elegantly confirmed by experiment.  In Section VI we derived the theorem of the addition of velocities in one direction in the form which also results from the hypotheses of classical mechanics. This theorem can also be deduced readily from the Galilei transformation (Section XI). In place of the man walking inside the carriage, we introduce a point moving relatively to the co-ordinate system _K′_ in accordance with the equation  _x′_ = _wt′_  By means of the first and fourth equations of the Galilei transformation we can express _x′_ and _t′_ in terms of _x_ and _t_, and we then obtain  _x_ = (_v_ + _w_)_t_  This equation expresses nothing else than the law of motion of the point with reference to the system _K_ (of the man with reference to the embankment). We denote this velocity by the symbol _W_, and we then obtain, as in Section VI,  _W_ = _v_ + _w_ . . . . . . . (A).  But we can carry out this consideration just as well on the basis of the theory of relativity. In the equation  _x′_ = _wt′_  we must then express _x′_ and _t′_ in terms of _x_ and _t_, making use of the first and fourth equations of the _Lorentz transformation_. Instead of the equation (A) we then obtain the equation  image013   which corresponds to the theorem of addition for velocities in one direction according to the theory of relativity. The question now arises as to which of these two theorems is the better in accord with experience. On this point we are enlightened by a most important experiment which the brilliant physicist Fizeau performed more than half a century ago, and which has been repeated since then by some of the best experimental physicists, so that there can be no doubt about its result. The experiment is concerned with the following question. Light travels in a motionless liquid with a particular velocity _w_. How quickly does it travel in the direction of the arrow in the tube _T_ (see the accompanying diagram, Fig. 3) when the liquid above mentioned is flowing through the tube with a velocity _v_?  image014   In accordance with the principle of relativity we shall certainly have to take for granted that the propagation of light always takes place with the same velocity _w with respect to the liquid_, whether the latter is in motion with reference to other bodies or not. The velocity of light relative to the liquid and the velocity of the latter relative to the tube are thus known, and we require the velocity of light relative to the tube.  It is clear that we have the problem of Section VI again before us. The tube plays the part of the railway embankment or of the co-ordinate system _K_, the liquid plays the part of the carriage or of the co-ordinate system _K′_, and finally, the light plays the part of the man walking along the carriage, or of the moving point in the present section. If we denote the velocity of the light relative to the tube by _W_, then this is given by the equation (A) or (B), according as the Galilei transformation or the Lorentz transformation corresponds to the facts. Experiment[10] decides in favour of equation (B) derived from the theory of relativity, and the agreement is, indeed, very exact. According to recent and most excellent measurements by Zeeman, the influence of the velocity of flow _v_ on the propagation of light is represented by formula (B) to within one per cent.    [10] Fizeau found   image015   where   image016   is the index of refraction of the liquid. On the other hand, owing to the smallness of   image017   as compared with 1, we can replace (B) in the first place by   image018   or to the same order of approximation by   image019   which agrees with Fizeau’s result.   Nevertheless we must now draw attention to the fact that a theory of this phenomenon was given by H. A. Lorentz long before the statement of the theory of relativity. This theory was of a purely electrodynamical nature, and was obtained by the use of particular hypotheses as to the electromagnetic structure of matter. This circumstance, however, does not in the least diminish the conclusiveness of the experiment as a crucial test in favour of the theory of relativity, for the electrodynamics of Maxwell-Lorentz, on which the original theory was based, in no way opposes the theory of relativity. Rather has the latter been developed trom electrodynamics as an astoundingly simple combination and generalisation of the hypotheses, formerly independent of each other, on which electrodynamics was built.   XIV.  THE HEURISTIC VALUE OF THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY  Our train of thought in the foregoing pages can be epitomised in the following manner. Experience has led to the conviction that, on the one hand, the principle of relativity holds true and that on the other hand the velocity of transmission of light _in vacuo_ has to be considered equal to a constant _c_. By uniting these two postulates we obtained the law of transformation for the rectangular co-ordinates _x, y, z_ and the time _t_ of the events which constitute the processes of nature. In this connection we did not obtain the Galilei transformation, but, differing from classical mechanics, the _Lorentz transformation_.  The law of transmission of light, the acceptance of which is justified by our actual knowledge, played an important part in this process of thought. Once in possession of the Lorentz transformation, however, we can combine this with the principle of relativity, and sum up the theory thus:  Every general law of nature must be so constituted that it is transformed into a law of exactly the same form when, instead of the space-time variables _x, y, z, t_ of the original coordinate system _K_, we introduce new space-time variables _x′, y′, z′, t′_ of a co-ordinate system _K′_. In this connection the relation between the ordinary and the accented magnitudes is given by the Lorentz transformation. Or in brief: General laws of nature are co-variant with respect to Lorentz transformations.  This is a definite mathematical condition that the theory of relativity demands of a natural law, and in virtue of this, the theory becomes a valuable heuristic aid in the search for general laws of nature. If a general law of nature "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30155"],["title","Relativity: The Special and General Theory (#6)"],["body","to be found which did not satisfy this condition, then at least one of the two fundamental assumptions of the theory would have been disproved. Let us now examine what general results the latter theory has hitherto evinced.   XV.  GENERAL RESULTS OF THE THEORY  It is clear from our previous considerations that the (special) theory of relativity has grown out of electrodynamics and optics. In these fields it has not appreciably altered the predictions of theory, but it has considerably simplified the theoretical structure, _i.e._ the derivation of laws, and—what is incomparably more important—it has considerably reduced the number of independent hypothese forming the basis of theory. The special theory of relativity has rendered the Maxwell-Lorentz theory so plausible, that the latter would have been generally accepted by physicists even if experiment had decided less unequivocally in its favour.  Classical mechanics required to be modified before it could come into line with the demands of the special theory of relativity. For the main part, however, this modification affects only the laws for rapid motions, in which the velocities of matter _v_ are not very small as compared with the velocity of light. We have experience of such rapid motions only in the case of electrons and ions; for other motions the variations from the laws of classical mechanics are too small to make themselves evident in practice. We shall not consider the motion of stars until we come to speak of the general theory of relativity. In accordance with the theory of relativity the kinetic energy of a material point of mass _m_ is no longer given by the well-known expression  image020   but by the expression  image021   This expression approaches infinity as the velocity _v_ approaches the velocity of light _c_. The velocity must therefore always remain less than _c_, however great may be the energies used to produce the acceleration. If we develop the expression for the kinetic energy in the form of a series, we obtain  image022   When  image023   is small compared with unity, the third of these terms is always small in comparison with the second, which last is alone considered in classical mechanics. The first term _mc_2 does not contain the velocity, and requires no consideration if we are only dealing with the question as to how the energy of a point-mass; depends on the velocity. We shall speak of its essential significance later.  The most important result of a general character to which the special theory of relativity has led is concerned with the conception of mass. Before the advent of relativity, physics recognised two conservation laws of fundamental importance, namely, the law of the conservation of energy and the law of the conservation of mass these two fundamental laws appeared to be quite independent of each other. By means of the theory of relativity they have been united into one law. We shall now briefly consider how this unification came about, and what meaning is to be attached to it.  The principle of relativity requires that the law of the conservation of energy should hold not only with reference to a co-ordinate system _K_, but also with respect to every co-ordinate system _K′_ which is in a state of uniform motion of translation relative to _K_, or, briefly, relative to every “Galileian” system of co-ordinates. In contrast to classical mechanics; the Lorentz transformation is the deciding factor in the transition from one such system to another.  By means of comparatively simple considerations we are led to draw the following conclusion from these premises, in conjunction with the fundamental equations of the electrodynamics of Maxwell: A body moving with the velocity _v_, which absorbs[11] an amount of energy _E_0 in the form of radiation without suffering an alteration in velocity in the process, has, as a consequence, its energy increased by an amount  image024     [11] _E_0 is the energy taken up, as judged from a co-ordinate system  moving with the body.   In consideration of the expression given above for the kinetic energy of the body, the required energy of the body comes out to be  image025   Thus the body has the same energy as a body of mass  image026   moving with the velocity _v_. Hence we can say: If a body takes up an amount of energy _E_0, then its inertial mass increases by an amount  image027   the inertial mass of a body is not a constant but varies according to the change in the energy of the body. The inertial mass of a system of bodies can even be regarded as a measure of its energy. The law of the conservation of the mass of a system becomes identical with the law of the conservation of energy, and is only valid provided that the system neither takes up nor sends out energy. Writing the expression for the energy in the form  image028   we see that the term _mc_2, which has hitherto attracted our attention, is nothing else than the energy possessed by the body[12] before it absorbed the energy _E_0.    [12] As judged from a co-ordinate system moving with the body.   A direct comparison of this relation with experiment is not possible at the present time (1920; see[Note], p. 48), owing to the fact that the changes in energy _E_0 to which we can subject a system are not large enough to make themselves perceptible as a change in the inertial mass of the system.  image027   is too small in comparison with the mass _m_, which was present before the alteration of the energy. It is owing to this circumstance that classical mechanics was able to establish successfully the conservation of mass as a law of independent validity.    [Note] The equation E = mc2 has been thoroughly proved time and again  since this time.   Let me add a final remark of a fundamental nature. The success of the Faraday-Maxwell interpretation of electromagnetic action at a distance resulted in physicists becoming convinced that there are no such things as instantaneous actions at a distance (not involving an intermediary medium) of the type of Newton’s law of gravitation.  According to the theory of relativity, action at a distance with the velocity of light always takes the place of instantaneous action at a distance or of action at a distance with an infinite velocity of transmission. This is connected with the fact that the velocity _c_ plays a fundamental role in this theory. In Part II we shall see in what way this result becomes modified in the general theory of relativity.   XVI.  EXPERIENCE AND THE SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY  To what extent is the special theory of relativity supported by experience? This question is not easily answered for the reason already mentioned in connection with the fundamental experiment of Fizeau. The special theory of relativity has crystallised out from the Maxwell-Lorentz theory of electromagnetic phenomena. Thus all facts of experience which support the electromagnetic theory also support the theory of relativity. As being of particular importance, I mention here the fact that the theory of relativity enables us to predict the effects produced on the light reaching us from the fixed stars. These results are obtained in an exceedingly simple manner, and the effects indicated, which are due to the relative motion of the earth with reference to those fixed stars are found to be in accord with experience. We refer to the yearly movement of the apparent position of the fixed stars resulting from the motion of the earth round the sun (aberration), and to the influence of the radial components of the relative motions of the fixed stars with respect to the earth on the colour of the light reaching us from them. The latter effect manifests itself in a slight displacement of the spectral lines of the light transmitted to us from a fixed star, as compared with the position of the same spectral lines when they are produced by a terrestrial source of light (Doppler principle). The experimental arguments in favour of the Maxwell-Lorentz theory, which are at the same time arguments in favour of the theory of relativity, are too numerous to be set forth here. In reality they limit the theoretical possibilities to such an extent, that no other theory than that of Maxwell and Lorentz has been able to hold its own when tested by experience.  But there are two classes of experimental facts hitherto obtained which can be represented in the Maxwell-Lorentz theory only by the introduction of an auxiliary hypothesis, which in itself—_i.e._ without making use of the theory of relativity—appears extraneous.  It is known that cathode rays and the so-called β-rays emitted by radioactive substances consist of negatively electrified particles (electrons) of very small inertia and large velocity. By examining the deflection of these rays under the influence of electric and magnetic fields, we can study the law of motion of these particles very exactly.  In the theoretical treatment of these electrons, we are faced with the difficulty that electrodynamic theory of itself is unable to give an account of their nature. For since electrical masses of one sign repel each other, the negative electrical masses constituting the electron would necessarily be scattered under the influence of their mutual repulsions, unless there are forces of another kind operating between them, the nature of which has hitherto remained obscure to us.[13] If we now assume that the relative distances between the electrical masses constituting the electron remain unchanged during the motion of the electron (rigid connection in the sense of classical mechanics), we arrive at a law of motion of the electron which does not agree with experience. Guided by purely formal points of view, H. A. Lorentz was the first to introduce the hypothesis that the form of the electron experiences a contraction in the direction of motion in consequence of that motion. the contracted length being proportional to the expression  image029   This, hypothesis,"]]]
