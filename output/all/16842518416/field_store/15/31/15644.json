JELLIES.   145. +Jellies+ should be as clear as crystal, not too sweet and just firm enough to hold together. Jellies that have to stand any length of time on the buffets must, of course, be firmer. A good plan is to make a trial by putting a little in a tin cup and setting it on ice before the jelly is put into a form.  146. +To Clarify Gelatine.+-- Put 2 ounces gelatine in a saucepan, add ½ pint cold water and let it stand 10 minutes; then add ½ pint boiling water, set the saucepan in a vessel of boiling water and stir until gelatine is dissolved; beat the whites of 2 eggs to a froth, add the juice of 1 large lemon and a little cold water; stir this into the gelatine, continue stirring until it boils, remove to side of stove and let it stand 5 minutes without boiling; then strain through a jelly bag and use as directed in following recipes.  147. +To Clarify Sugar.+-- Put 1 pound sugar in 1 pint cold water and stir till sugar is dissolved; then strain through a napkin.

When all the jelly has run through fill it into a mould and set either on ice or in a cool place.  150. +Orange Jelly.+-- Clarify 2 ounces of gelatine as directed (see Clarifying Gelatine), dissolve 1 pound sugar in 1 pint water, add the thin peel of 2 oranges and let it stand 1 hour; then remove orange peel and strain the sugar syrup through a napkin; remove the peel from 4 oranges, divide them into small quarters and remove the pits without breaking the fruit; next pour the juice of 8 oranges and 2 lemons through filtering paper (see Clarifying Fruit Juice); as soon as the gelatine, fruit juice and sugar are clarified mix the three together, place a jelly form into cracked ice, pour in a few spoonfuls jelly and when firm lay in one-third of the orange quarters, which should be wiped dry with a napkin; add sufficient jelly to cover the fruit and when hard lay over another third; cover again with jelly and continue until all is used up; cover the form, lay some ice on top and let it stand till firm; when ready to serve dip the form into hot water, wipe it dry, remove cover, turn the jelly into a dish and serve with vanilla sauce or sweet cream. NOTE.--If the inside of jelly mould is brushed with pure almond oil the form need not be dipped in hot water, as the jelly will slip out without any trouble. Fine olive oil may also be used, but care should be taken to use only the very best, as otherwise the flavor of the jelly will be spoiled.  151. +Plain Orange Jelly.+-- Dissolve and clarify 1 ounce gelatine in ½ pint water as directed, dissolve 1 cup sugar in ½ pint water, add the thin peel of 1 orange and let it stand 1 hour; then strain through a napkin; let the juice of 5 oranges and 1 lemon run through filtering paper or a fine napkin; mix the gelatine, fruit juice and sugar syrup together, pour it into a jelly mould and set in a cool place to get firm; when ready to serve dip the form into hot water, turn the jelly onto a dish and serve with the following sauce:--Beat 1 egg to a froth, add by degrees 1 cup milk, 2 tablespoonfuls sugar and 1 teaspoonful vanilla extract.  152. +Lemon Jelly.+-- Clarify 2 ounces gelatine as directed, dissolve 1¼ pounds sugar in 1 pint water, add the grated rind of 2 lemons and let it stand ½ hour; then strain through a napkin; let 1 pint of lemon juice run through filtering paper (see Clarifying Fruit Juice); when the three ingredients have been clarified mix them together, fill the jelly into a jelly mould, set it on ice or in a cold place to get firm and serve same as Orange Jelly.  153. +Strawberry Jelly.+-- Put 1 quart ripe strawberries in a colander, rinse them off with cold water and when drained mash them well in a bowl with a silver spoon; dissolve ¾ pound sugar in 1 pint cold water, add the juice of 1 lemon and put it over the fire to boil 5 minutes; strain through a napkin and when cold pour it over the strawberries; let them stand 3 hours; then strain the berries, first through a jelly bag and then through filtering paper; also let the juice of 2 oranges run through filtering paper; clarify 2 ounces gelatine as directed and when cold add it to the fruit juice; then make a trial by filling a few spoonfuls in a tin cup and set it on ice to form; if not firm enough add a little more dissolved gelatine; fill the jelly alternately with large strawberries in a jelly form and finish the same as Orange Jelly; serve with whipped cream.  154. +Pineapple Jelly.+-- Pare and cut a large, ripe pineapple into quarters, remove the hard core from the center and cut the quarters of pineapple into fine slices; dissolve 1 pound sugar in 1 pint cold water and juice of 1 lemon, pour it over the pineapple pieces, cover and let it stand for 2 hours; chop the eyes and hard core of pineapple very fine, put them with 1 pint water in a saucepan over the fire and boil slowly ½ hour; when cold strain them and add the liquid to the pineapple; in the meantime clarify 2 ounces gelatine as directed; then drain the pineapple in a sieve, wipe the slices dry with a napkin and lay them on a plate; let the pineapple syrup run through filtering paper or napkin and mix it with the clarified gelatine; also let the juice of 2 oranges and 1 lemon run through filtering paper and add it to the jelly; then make a trial to see if firm enough; place jelly form in cracked ice, pour a few spoonfuls of jelly into the form and when hard put in a layer of pineapple; cover them with jelly and when firm put in another layer of pineapple; continue until all is used up; then cover the form, put some ice on top of form and let it remain till jelly is firm; serve with or without cream or vanilla sauce. This jelly may also be made of preserved pineapple.  155. +Jelly of Peaches.+-- Pare 8 large, ripe peaches, cut them into halves, remove the stones and cut each half into 3 or 4 pieces; put the fruit into a bowl and pour over it 1 pint of sugar syrup; let them stand well covered for 2 hours; scald the pits, remove the brown skin and put them with the peaches; then let the syrup run through filtering paper, mix it with 2 ounces clarified gelatine, fill the jelly with the peaches and pits in alternate layers in a form and finish the same as Orange Jelly.  156. +Raspberry Jelly.+-- Press the juice from 1 quart ripe raspberries, add the juice of 1 lemon and filter it through filtering paper (see Clarifying Fruit Juice); dissolve ¾ pound sugar in 1 pint water, strain through a napkin and add it to the raspberry juice; add 2 ounces clarified gelatine; set a jelly form into cracked ice and fill the jelly alternately with large, ripe raspberries into the form and finish the same as Orange Jelly.  157. +Wine Jelly.+-- Soak 2 ounces gelatine in ½ pint cold water for 10 minutes; then add ½ pint boiling water and stir the whole over the fire till gelatine is dissolved; add the rind and juice of 1 lemon, 2 whole cloves, a small piece of cinnamon and the well beaten whites of 2 eggs; stir this with an egg beater till it boils; then remove the saucepan with its contents to side of stove and let it remain for 5 minutes without boiling; then strain it through a flannel jelly bag; dissolve ¾ pound sugar in 1 pint cold water, strain it through a napkin and add it with 1 pint Madeira to the gelatine; rinse out a jelly mould with cold water, pour in the jelly and set it on ice or in "]]]
