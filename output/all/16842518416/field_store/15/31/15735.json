Merritt quickly made terms, for the guide, besides being able to converse in French and Flemish, could speak some English, and readily comprehended all that was said in that tongue; especially when the subject of a money contract came under consideration.  \"There's nothing to detain us any longer, boys,\" remarked Merritt. \"We have made up a little pack apiece which we'd like to take along. We travel light on this trip, you know; all but Tubby, and that's something he always gets left on. The balance of our duffle the proprietor of the hotel has promised to keep safely until we show up to claim it again.\"  \"Small loss if we never see any of it again,\" Rob admitted. \"At the same time we hope to come back this way after we've run that person down, and either recover the paper your grandfather wants, or learn that it's lost for good.\"  \"That is,\" corrected Tubby, \"we expect to see Antwerp again if the Germans don't gobble us up.\"  \"I'd like to see them try it,\" remarked Merritt, with a significant look at the ample proportions of the fat chum. \"They'd have their work cut out, as sure as you live, Tubby.\"  \"Now, don't get personal again, Merritt,\" cautioned the other, holding up a warning forefinger, \"but as there are heaps and heaps of queer things I'd like to poke into around this town, I certainly hope to visit it again.\"  Half an hour afterward, mounted on scrubby looking horses, which would have excited the derision of any respectable cowboy in the West, Rob and his two chums, accompanied by Anthony Wallenhout, the Belgian guide, passed out of the city, heading toward the east.  Before they had gone a sixth of a mile they found themselves stopped by a patrol of soldiers, led by a young lieutenant, who, it happened, could speak English.  \"It is no use, messieurs,\" he told them, with a pleasant smile, but a determined shake of the head, \"you must face the other way and go back. The enemy is in force in many places between Brussels and Antwerp, and severe fighting is going on wherever our brave army has thrown up entrenchments. Antwerp is the only safe place for any who speak English, these days.\"     CHAPTER IV.  THE DAY OF THE BOY SCOUT.   \"Now, wouldn't that jar you!\" muttered Tubby, sprawled on the back of his horse very much after the manner of a great toad. \"Here we hardly get started on our wonderful trip over the battlefields of Belgium before we're held up, and told to fade away. Huh! talk to me about luck, we seem to have lost our grip.\"  \"Show him what you've got, Merritt,\" suggested Rob, who did not give up quite so easily, because of a sudden snag in the stream.  \"Oh! why, yes, how about that passport the burgomaster wrote out for us himself? It ought to do the trick!\" exclaimed Tubby, his sad look disappearing like a flash, and an expectant one appearing in its stead.   The officer scanned the paper which Merritt handed him.  \"At a time like this the burgomaster himself is under military orders,\" he told the waiting boys, \"and if it happened to be a matter of much importance I could not honor his request. It chances, however, that in this case there is nothing involved except your safety. And you seem to be willing to take the risk?\"  \"Yes, because we have a very important piece of business to carry out,\" Rob hastened to tell him, seeing which way the wind was blowing, and wishing to take advantage of the flood-tide. \"It means a great deal to one of my friends if we can find a certain man. You will allow us to go on, then, I hope?\"  The lieutenant shrugged his shoulders in real French style as he handed the burgomaster's passport back.  \"Yes, if you are that rash, young messieurs,\" he said. \"We, of the Belgian army, can admire pluck. You certainly have my best wishes.\"  \"Oh! thank you, lieutenant!\" gushed Tubby, who was relieved to know that the enterprise was not fated to be condemned at the start.  Perhaps the time might come ere long when the same Tubby would be secretly lamenting over the fact that it had been given a free swing. But coming events do not always cast their shadows before; and just at that moment none of the venturesome scouts could so much as guess what awaited them in the disturbed country beyond.  They gave the obliging lieutenant a regular scout salute, which he returned in kind. The paper had informed him that Rob and his chums were members of the Boy Scout organization in America, so that the fact of their wearing khaki uniforms was easily understood.  \"I hope we have as good luck in skipping past every obstacle we run up against,\" Merritt was saying, as they moved along the road leading from Antwerp in the direction of the Belgian capital.  \"Oh! we mustn't expect to be always as fortunate as that,\" said Rob. \"I believe in hoping for the best, and preparing for the worst. It's good policy all around.\"  \"Something like we read the Pilgrim Fathers used to do in the good old days when they used to ride to church with the wife back of them,\" Tubby explained, \"and every man carrying his gun along. Their motto was 'trust in the Lord; but keep your powder dry!'\"  \"That's the idea,\" agreed Rob. \"And so far, in all our tramps and wanderings, we've managed to do our part fairly well.\"  \"Let's hope this venture turns out as good,\" Tubby added, with a side glance toward Merritt, for, of course, it concerned him more than either of the others whether success or failure resulted from their trip abroad.  That was only a beginning, for they were soon held up again. This time it came about that the soldier in charge of the detachment could not speak a word of English, so the guide had to exercise his ability in the line of a translator.  So well did he plead, and explain that they were all good friends of the burgomaster of Antwerp, that once again they were allowed to proceed.  Rob could easily see, however, that considerable doubt had arisen in the mind of the officer as to whether he should permit three boys to head into such a disturbed country as that lying beyond.  Like the lieutenant, he shrugged his shoulders, and dismissed the matter of responsibility from his mind. Indeed, there were too many other serious affairs to be considered just then to bother about a party of tourists fairly wild to say they had gazed upon actual battlefields; for, doubtless, he concluded this was the real reason why these venturesome boys elected to take chances in the war zone.  So long as they were not spies in the service of the enemy it was all right; only he wanted to warn them that they were apt to meet with some roving detachment of Germans at almost any time, since they were overrunning most of the country, appearing suddenly at villages, and demanding food and wine, or surprising isolated stations poorly guarded, so as to hold some important bridge for the coming of a column.  \"Look what's coming whizzing along ahead there!\" Tubby called out a short time after this encounter.  There was a little cloud of dust, and they could see that it was caused by someone mounted on a bicycle, who was bending down over the handlebars and working his feet very rapidly.  \"Give him the road, fellows; he seems to be in a big hurry!\" ordered Rob.  A minute later and the bicyclist shot by them. As he did so he straightened up in the saddle, and to their surprise gave them a regulation scout salute. Then he went tearing down the road in that cloud of dust.  \"Did you see that?\" cried Tubby. \"Why, he was a Boy Scout as sure as anything! Now, what in the wide world was he in such a terrible hurry for? He acted like he might be late for his breakfast.\"  \"Just now the Boy Scouts in Belgium have a good many other things to bother them besides missing an occasional meal,\" explained Rob. \"They have been taken over by the military authorities and are doing splendid work in heaps of ways.\"  \"Yes,\" added Merritt, as they rode on again, \"I noticed a number of them while we were in Antwerp, and they seemed to be on the jump constantly. Every fellow had a badge on his left arm with the letters 'S. M.' on it. You remember, Rob, when you asked what they stood for, you were told the letters meant 'Service Militaire,' and showed that the boys were working for the Government.\"  \"What d'ye reckon they find to do?\" asked Tubby, deeply interested.  \"They act as dispatch bearers,\" replied Rob, \"ambulance orderlies, and aids to the police. They told me that in Brussels, now held by the Germans, some scouts daily herded the women who came for their regular ration issued by the Government, and kept order, too. Everybody takes them seriously. This is no time for play among the Boy Scouts of Belgium, when war has gripped their native land.\"  \"When we were over in England,\" Merritt related, \"I made it a point to find out how all the scouts there were being made use of. It gave me a mighty proud feeling to know that I was authorized to wear the uniform of the Eagle Patrol; for there never was a time in the history of the world when boys were of as much use as now.\"  \"But there have been no battles on English soil, up to now, Merritt; tell me how the Boy Scouts of Great Britain could do things, then?\" asked Tubby, who it seems could not have been bothering himself very much when his chums were making all these observations.  Merritt took a slip of paper from his pocket. They were riding slowly at the time, indeed at all times, for the horses did not seem desirous of making any particular speed.  \"Here's an account I clipped from an English paper while we were in London,\" he told Tubby. \"It tells a lot of things the scouts have taken to doing in order to assist; for, during the war, school duties have been mostly dropped.\"  \"Oh! what joy!\" cried Tubby; \"but go and read it out to us, Merritt.\"  \"Here's what the account says, then,\" Merritt told them, as he managed to read from the slip: \"'Acting as guides to troops. Forwarding dispatches dropped from air craft. Coastguard work, such as watching"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29991"],["title","The Boy Scouts on Belgian Battlefields (#5)"],["body",", guiding vessels in unbuoyed channels, and showing lights to friendly vessels!'\"  \"Whew!\" remarked Tubby; \"that sounds fine to me, Merritt. For once I almost wish I happened to be a Johnny Bull boy instead of an Uncle Sam. Is that all?\"  \"It's only the beginning,\" he was told. \"Listen to some more work a scout can do for his country over there. 'Collecting information as to available supplies and transports. Helping the families of men at the front. First aid; fitting up nursing stations, refuges, dispensaries, and kitchens in their own club rooms. Carrying on organized relief of the destitute. Guarding and patrolling bridges, culverts, telegraph lines, and water supplies. Serving as dispatch bearers, telegraph and mail delivery riders; and distributing millions of notices as to billeting, commandeering, safety precautions, and the like,' How's that strike you, Tubby?\"  \"It certainly gives me a thrill,\" the fat boy replied, \"and I envy the lucky Boy Scouts of Great Britain. I reckon they're doing things like that down in France. Yes, and in Germany too. Now people will see what it means to wear the khaki uniform. I'm prouder than ever because I have that right.\"  \"They say,\" remarked Rob, chiming in with what knowledge he had picked up, \"that for once the boys are appreciated in these times. They have at last come into their own. A scout's uniform is regarded in England as a sign of competence and responsibility. It is treated with the same respect given to any other official garb.\"  \"This account goes on to say that the boys have developed a wonderful topographical knowledge,\" Merritt continued, full of the subject as any Boy Scout might well be. \"They pack ambulances systematically with instruments and medical supplies, checking off their lists like experienced quartermasters. Others take charge of the delivery of camp outfits from the stores to the troops about to embark for the seat of war. The bicycle corps and mounted squads can care for their machines and horses, make high speed, and meet emergencies with decision and intelligence. The signal corps can use the telegraph key, semaphore, and flags almost as well as veterans, thanks to their training. They can repair telegraph lines and instruments, and have considerable knowledge of wireless.\"  \"Hurrah!\" exclaimed Tubby. \"This is sure the day of the Boy Scout. I never thought I'd ever live to see him climb to such a dazzling height. Of course, over in America, scouts have never been trained with any idea that they might be soldiers; for we don't have a chip on our shoulder all the time, and feel that we're spoiling for a fight.\"  \"All the same,\" said Rob, \"the time may come when what we've learned will be of great use to our country. Besides, every boy is ten times better off for joining the organization.\"  They had been riding in this fashion for an hour and more, often meeting parties of fugitives on the road, some of them bearing household treasures, leading a mooing cow, or driving a spavined old horse that was attached to a shaky wagon piled up with goods of value to the owners only.  These sights at first struck the boys as pitiful. They would in time become so accustomed to them that such spectacles must be taken as a part of the war game; still, all of them were sure that in this case \"familiarity would not breed contempt.\"  Then at times it happened that houses were scarce, and a stretch of the road, from some reason or other, ahead appeared deserted. Often, in the distance, they heard strange sounds like far-away thunder. It thrilled them to imagine that possibly this was the roar of big guns; perhaps they were even drawing near to an actual battlefield!  About this time the boys noticed that their guide was acting as though excited.  \"What's the matter, Anthony?\" asked Rob, bent on knowing the worst.  In his broken English the Belgian guide tried to tell them his fears.  \"Look you--over thisaways--you see men, horses--they run thisaway, they run thataway--some shake hands at us--I do not know, but it may be they will turn out to be Uhlan cavalrymen--bad men who ride far in advance of the army, to screen movements of troops. If they are Uhlans, we may not go ahead further!\"     CHAPTER V.  UNDER THE BRIDGE.   Of course what Anthony told them caused the boys more or less concern. They had no desire to fall into the hands of the Germans. While it could not be said that they were against the invaders, the terrible stories they had heard in Antwerp, even if only a small part were true, gave them an unpleasant feeling toward the Kaiser's men.  That word Uhlan was dreaded by every Belgian or native of Northern France. While it really stands for the cavalry arm of the German forces, still, ever since the Franco-Prussian war of more than forty years ago, it has possessed a terrible significance all its own. Humble peasants shivered when they pronounced it, and no doubt many an unruly child was threatened with the coming of the terrible Uhlans unless it mended its ways.  \"If that's the case, then,\" Merritt voiced the opinion of himself and chums by saying hurriedly, \"we want to get out of this. It's a case of either run or hide with us.\"  \"But where could we hide?\" asked Tubby, looking all around him helplessly. \"Just now there isn't a single cottage in sight; and the bare fields around don't offer much shelter, seems to me.\"  \"There's a bridge just ahead of us,\" said Rob.  \"And we might manage to get our mounts down underneath,\" added Merritt instantly, grasping the idea that was in the patrol leader's mind. \"The bank slopes easy enough to allow of it.\"  \"Eet could be done, Messieurs!\" allowed the guide, who was even more alarmed, it seemed, than Tubby himself, since the prospect of falling into the hands of the dreaded Uhlan raiders began to assume greater proportions, now that the peril no longer lay in the dim distance, but was close at hand.  \"Then let's hurry and see what it looks like under the bridge,\" advised Rob.  Just as they figured, it proved easy enough to lead their horses down the bank, which was covered with grass and growing weeds, for since the war began all really unnecessary work on roads and railways had been stopped. And those horses would have willingly gone anywhere if there only seemed a prospect that they might rest a spell, for they seemed tired all of the time.  \"Listen to them shouting, will you?\" Tubby complained as they were going down amidst the bushes that promised to screen them from the party on the other side of the little stream across which the massive bridge had been built.  \"I'm afraid they must have seen us,\" Merritt said, \"and that will mean they'll soon be across the bridge again to find out what we're doing, and who we are. What's the program, Rob?\"  \"We must act as though our only object in coming down here was to water our horses,\" replied the patrol leader; this idea having possibly come into his mind as he noticed the way his mount put its ears forward, and commenced to whinny--as horses invariably do when they scent water, and are thirsty.  \"Come on, here, what's ailing you, Dobbin?\" demanded Tubby, jerking at the reins when his animal displayed an inclination to hold back.  \"He acts kind of queer, doesn't he?\" Merritt said when, after considerable fussing, Tubby managed to coax his horse to once more advance, though the animal seemed to be snorting, and trembling. \"If we were on the cattle range right now I'd be half inclined to think he smelled a rattler near by.\"  \"My stars! I hope they don't have such pests over here in Belgium!\" exclaimed Tubby, beginning to himself show immediate signs of nervousness.  \"Not the least danger,\" declared Rob. \"But, all the same, my horse seems trying to hold back, just as yours did, Tubby.\"  \"They're sure a cantankerous lot all through!\" grumbled the fat scout, looking carefully where he expected to plant his foot next; for, in spite of Rob's assurance, he was not quite so certain that the undergrowth beneath the bridge might not harbor some poisonous reptile which might strike unexpectedly.  \"They're still keeping up that shouting!\" announced Merritt, listening. \"Which I take it is a queer thing for them to do. If they're German raiders why don't they come across and interview us, I wonder? I thought I saw uniforms among the bunch. How about that, Rob?\"  \"The sun was in my eyes, and I couldn't say for certain,\" acknowledged the one spoken to, jerking at the bridle of his horse.  \"One thing is sure,\" said Tubby, \"the horses are not at all thirsty; else there's some thing they don't like about this place down here.\"  All of them were really puzzled by the strange actions of their horses. It was no longer simply Tubby's mount that acted so contrary, but the other three also.  \"Guess my nag got cold feet about something; and it's catching as the measles,\" Tubby announced, as he shook his head in the manner of one who finds himself with too hard a nut to crack.  \"Well, that water looks cool and clear,\" said Merritt, \"and I think I could enjoy a few swallows myself, if the horses won't.\"  \"Sure it ain't poisoned, are you, Merritt?\" queried Tubby dubiously.  \"Oh! get that crazy notion out of your poor head, Tubby. Germans don't make war that way. They face the music, and stand up before the guns. What makes you look at me like that, Rob?\" and Merritt as he asked this question stopped short, for he had been in the act of putting his threat into deeds, and getting down beside the stream to take a drink.  \"I smell it too, Rob!\" exclaimed Tubby just then. \"And, oh! let me tell you it's a rank odor. Isn't it in this country they make all that Limburger cheese; or over the border in Holland? Well, if you asked me I'd say it was something like that.\"  \"Smells more like burnt powder to me!\" snapped Rob, showing visible signs of increasing excitement.  With that he commenced looking hurriedly around. Perhaps a sudden tremendous suspicion may have flashed into his mind, and he was"]]]
