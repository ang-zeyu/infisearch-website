The odds are against you, and, if you should get tumbled out of your seat a mile high, I'd hate to be under you when you strike the ground.\"  \"They seem to be maneuvering for position,\" asserted Rob. \"Yes, both are circling around now, and going still higher all the time. Before long the German will be hidden in that cloud bank, and that's what he's aiming to have happen.\"  \"I thought I saw something like a little puff of smoke just then!\" declared Merritt, who had exceptionally good eyes, strong almost as those of an eagle.  \"Then they must be bombarding each other!\" Tubby ventured to say, evidently greatly thrilled by the spectacle that could never have been dreamed of a few generations back.  \"It's likely they are using their automatics, and trying to disable each other,\" admitted Rob, \"though, between us, Merritt, I don't believe the tiny puff of smoke could be seen away down here, unless you had a strong glass. Of course, when moving as fast as they do, the chance of making a shot tell is next door to nix.\"  \"Anyhow, they're chasing the German aëroplane off,\" Tubby declared. \"That is the main object for the brave Belgians going up there.\"  The boys had made up their minds while on the way across that as Americans they must obey the President's appeal and be strictly neutral, if it were possible. They had many good friends who were of German descent, while others had English ancestors and near relatives.  The one country with which they sympathized deeply was Belgium. The stubborn and heroic way in which that seven millions of people had defied seventy millions, and the gallant manner in which their little army had tried to resist the invasion of their beloved country, had aroused the admiration of every one of the scouts.  As they stood there on that afternoon, and watched, they finally saw the German Taube vanish in the clouds, with the leading Belgian aëroplane following suit. Whether the pursuer ever overtook the foreign air-scout or not, the boys never learned.  \"Well, that was a lively little tilt while it lasted,\" remarked Merritt as, the entertainment being over, the crowds again commenced sauntering back and forth, with everybody talking volubly about the spectacle in the heavens.  Soldiers gave them a curious look in passing. Every stranger in Antwerp was under more or less suspicion in those days, for it was becoming known that the German secret service had for years maintained the most wonderful system of spying in France, England and Belgium ever dreamed of. Antwerp had thousands of Teuton residents before the war, some of them leading merchants who owned splendid country places six or seven miles outside the city, where solid cement tennis courts afterward came in very handy as foundations for the immense German siege guns.  \"We'll see plenty more things that will give us a thrill to beat that,\" Rob observed, pushing through the bustling, chattering crowds.  \"Yes, and I'm afraid times may come when danger will hang over our heads,\" Merritt pursued, with a touch of regret in his voice. \"Then you'll both be sorry you didn't let me go off on this wild goose chase, as it may turn out to be, by myself.\"  \"What do you take us for, I want to know?\" demanded Rob. \"Haven't we been through all sorts of tough times together in the past; and why shouldn't we stand by our chum when he needs our help? What's a scout good for if he is ready to desert a comrade when the sky grows dark? That's just the time to show his true colors.\"  \"You're taking the very words out of my mouth when you say that, Rob!\" asserted Tubby valiantly. \"No matter what happens, we're bound by the ties of old friendship. We'll sink or swim together, boys. And Merritt, please don't ever tell us again you're feeling sorry for letting us come along.\"  \"If that man is to be found, we're going to corner him!\" declared Rob, with his lips taking on the firm lines that marked them whenever he was making up his mind to hammer away persistently, like Grant did before Richmond; \"and when we go back to the other side, we hope to be carrying that precious old paper your grandfather let get out of his possession in such a queer way.\"  \"This seems like a pretty warm day to me, even for summer,\" observed Tubby irrelevantly.  \"Now, we can give a pretty good guess, Rob,\" ventured Merritt smilingly, \"that Tubby has a sly meaning back of that remark.\"  \"Yes,\" added the patrol leader, \"and the chances are three to one it has something to do with feeding.\"  \"You are champion guessers, both of you,\" Tubby informed them, without seeming to be in the least ashamed of the confession. \"I'm consumed by a violent thirst right now; and I bet you the milk in that shiny brass can that those two tired dogs have been dragging all over Antwerp this afternoon will have a lump of ice in it. Anyway, I'm going to test it; come along and let me stand treat.\"  Laughing at his earnestness, the others followed the fat scout across the street, where the old woman with her dog team was apparently resting, and observing the remarkably interesting sights around her.  Just then there were loud cheers that attracted the attention of the three boys.  \"Something else coming along that's worth seeing,\" Merritt announced. \"Better curb that fierce thirst of yours for a minute or two, Tubby, while we watch what's passing.\"  \"Oh! well, I guess the milk won't sour while we're waiting,\" admitted the fat boy with a sigh of resignation, as he wheeled so as to face the street.  \"What do you call that, I wonder?\" remarked Merritt, as he looked. \"It's got the wheels of an automobile; but say, notice how the body of the car has been built up with steel sides, will you? And as sure as you live there's a quick firing Maxim mounted behind that bullet shield.\"  \"Now I know what it is,\" Rob hastened to say.  \"Then tell us, please,\" urged Tubby helplessly.  \"They call them armored cars,\" said the patrol leader. \"I've read about how some of these reckless Belgians have fitted up cars in this way. Nearly every day they start out to raid through the country, where they expect to run across detachments of Uhlans, or bicycle squads of the German advance. Then they dart down on them and do some terrible work; before the enemy can recover to smash them, they are off like a flash, and return to town with all sorts of trophies.\"  \"They must have just been coming in,\" ventured Merritt. \"I saw one of the soldiers had a bandage around his head. Another was holding up two helmets which must have been worn by Uhlans. And listen how the crowds roar and cheer. They certainly do hate the Kaiser and his army in Antwerp.\"  \"Well, do you wonder?\" Rob asked. \"After some of their lovely towns have been burnt down, and thousands of houses destroyed, simply because these Belgians dared to stand up for their rights as a neutral nation!\"  \"Well, how about that drink of milk, fellows?\" Tubby wanted to know.  \"Suit yourself, Tubby,\" Rob told him. \"If it tastes good to you, we might join you in a glass.\"  \"Huh! sort of 'trying it on the dog first,' eh?\" Tubby retorted, and then turning toward the owner of the dog team and the milk cart, he made a gesture with his head, and held up three fingers.  Evidently the old woman must have understood what he meant, though she looked a bit \"peeved,\" as Tubby afterward expressed it, at being asked to do a retail business. There were a number of measures dangling from hooks around the top of the shining brass milk can, also several glass \"schooners.\" Taking one of the latter the old Belgian milk vender was in the act of filling it from the contents of the can when something astonishing happened.  Four soldiers who had been passing became excited, and pointed at the group; then they laid violent hands on the owner of the milk cart!     CHAPTER III.  LEAVING FOR THE FRONT.   \"What's this? What's this?\" stammered Tubby, as the schooner of rich milk fell with a crash to the pavement when the soldiers began struggling with the woman vender, who was also the owner of the dog team.  Of course a crowd collected immediately, as it always will in a city when there is the first sign of something doing. Antwerp was fairly seething with half suppressed excitement at that time, and anything of this kind was like putting a match to the powder magazine.  \"Well, I declare but she's a husky old woman, that's right!\" Tubby was heard to say after his astonishment had in a measure abated, and he could catch his breath. \"Why, it takes the whole four soldiers to subdue her. Shame! to hit a poor old woman like that; but my stars, don't she kick and try to land a blow on some of their noses.\"  \"Whew! what do you think!\" exclaimed Rob just then, for he had been listening to some of the chattering on the part of the excited crowd near by. \"It isn't an old woman, after all, but a man. That explains how he comes to fight as he does, and why the Belgians keep on treating him so roughly.\"  \"A man, and dressed up like a woman!\" cried Tubby. \"Well, if that isn't a queer stunt, I want to know. Is he trying to escape military duty, do you think, Rob? I remember they have conscription here in Belgium just like in Germany, Russia and France. Every young fellow has to serve the colors just so long.\"  But Rob shook his head. By now the soldiers had apparently conquered the spirit of the man in woman's garments. His white Belgian cap had been torn off in the struggle, showing that his hair was short underneath. He was also bleeding from having come in contact with some hard object, but he now stood there as straight as any grenadier, and looked his captors contemptuously in the face.  \"They say he's a German spy!\" Rob told his two chums. Tubby again held his breath, and stared as hard as he could at the prisoner.  The crowd became fairly wild to get at the captive, and made all manner of violent threats as they surged around the little group. The milk can "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29991"],["title","The Boy Scouts on Belgian Battlefields (#3)"],["body","upset, and the dogs liberated by some friendly hand ran wildly away, as though knowing that their temporary master had gotten himself in a serious scrape.  The four determined Belgian soldiers guarding their prisoner against the fury of the mob began to work a way along the pavement, meaning, no doubt, to land their prize in the lock-up, where he would be safe until the firing squad was called on to complete the tragedy.  Presently their signals brought another detachment of the guard to the spot, a way was speedily cleared through the dense masses of people, and that was the last the three scouts saw of the spy. They could guess his fate, but at the same time felt positive that he must have met it as a man.  Somehow, the experience gave them a queer feeling. Here they had been rubbing up against some of the tragic happenings of the war, and after being in Antwerp only a few hours. No wonder they all felt convinced that the signs pointed to their having some lively times ahead.  \"And say, I didn't get my drink of milk, either, did I?\" lamented Tubby, after things settled back into the old rut again, with that never-ending procession of citizens, refugees, soldiers, and even a sprinkling of venturesome foreign tourists passing by in both directions.  \"Oh! that doesn't cut much figure in the matter,\" Merritt told him, \"because if you step off this main street into one of the side _gassens_ you'll run across plenty of other milk-venders, who will not turn out to be something else.\"  \"I see one right now,\" announced the persistent Tubby, who did not like to give up anything on which he had set his heart. \"And look at the name of the same, will you: _The Street of the Steen_. Now what does that stand for, Rob? Is it the same as the German word _stein_?\"  \"Oh! no, you're away off there, Tubby,\" he was immediately told by the patrol leader, who had studied his guide book to some advantage. \"This Steen used ages ago to be a terrible prison, where in the days of the Spanish Inquisition they tortured people in all sorts of ways. Just now it's a great museum; and if only we had time, which we don't expect, I'd like nothing better than to explore it.\"  \"You see,\" Merritt told them, \"if only you would let me go on by myself, and try to find Steven Meredith, you might stay around here and have a fairly decent time, unless the Germans do really start to try and capture Antwerp, after all.\"  \"That'll do for you, Merritt,\" Rob informed him severely, \"you forget that incident is closed.\"  \"Yes,\" added Tubby, trying to frown, but as usual making a sorry mess of it, for the lines of his chubby face refused to take on such an air, seeing that they were only adapted for smiling, \"don't let us hear another wheeze from you, Merritt. But please come with me, and let's see if all the old milk-venders of Antwerp are German spies. I hope the milk isn't poisoned.\"  \"That isn't fair talk, Tubby, because you know the Germans would be away and above doing anything like that. They have their faults, but nobody calls them cowards. In fact, they seem to be too brave for their own good, because we hear how they are shot down like ripe grain, pushing along in masses straight into the jaws of death, and singing as they go.\"  This time they were allowed to quaff their mugs of cool, fresh milk without any unpleasant incident to interrupt the ceremony. Tubby did eye the woman who owned the outfit rather suspiciously, and must have aroused her curiosity by the way he turned his head several times after they had walked off.  For another hour the three American scouts tramped back and forth, seeing all they possibly could in so short a time. The quaint Flemish houses, with their many gables, and their red-tiled roofs, interested them greatly. In some of the streets the buildings even seemed to lean toward one another, and Tubby declared two men could almost shake hands by stretching from the upper windows.  \"Now we ought to see the burgomaster,\" said Rob, as the afternoon waned. \"You know you are carrying a letter to him, Merritt, from your grandfather, who happens to be acquainted with him. And we count on getting a guide through his influence who will take us along the roads between here and Brussels.\"  \"Even if a guide is not to be found, because nearly all the men are enlisted in the army,\" Merritt replied, \"we've made up our minds not to hold back. Fellows who have had as much experience in running the gauntlet as the scouts of the Eagle Patrol can point to, needn't worry about how they're going to get along.\"  \"Leave that to us,\" said Tubby, rather pompously; \"and we'll land on our feet all right, just as a cat does if you drop it out of the second-story window.\"  After considerable difficulty, the boys were admitted to an audience with the mayor or burgomaster of Antwerp in his official chambers. Fortunately, he spoke English, so they expected to meet with little difficulty in acquainting him with the nature of their mission to Belgium at a time when nearly all other Americans were only too well pleased to get away from the land of strife and warfare.  The burgomaster looked surprised and even anxious when he heard that they desired an official paper from him, requesting all Belgians to assist them in their search for one Steven Meredith, who was believed to be located in a town not many miles to the west of the capital.  \"I would do much for my old friend, Monsieur Charles Crawford, for whom I have long entertained a sincere affection,\" he told Merritt, after he had read the letter presented to him, and questioned the boys at length, \"but it is a most serious undertaking you have in view. I question the wisdom of my encouraging such a dangerous trip.\"  Rob, seeing that the good burgomaster appeared to be hesitating, and as Tubby expressed it, \"on the fence,\" started in to talk. Rob had a very persuasive way about him, as his chums knew from past experiences. They guessed how it would all turn out as soon as they saw how impressed the Belgian city official seemed to be with the arguments the boy brought forward.  Of course, in the end, the burgomaster yielded, and wrote them out the passport they wanted so badly. This document would possibly permit them to go even beyond the lines where the Belgian army was intrenched, waiting to deal a blow at the enemy in case the Germans turned threateningly toward Antwerp.  \"I do this much against my will,\" he told them, as he was shaking each one by the hand upon their leaving. \"But my old friend has written me so much that is clever about the faculty you boys have shown in taking care of yourselves, that I am in hopes you may get through safely. But I shall be sad indeed if anything overtakes you through my giving way to sentiment. I wish I could influence you to remain here in safety, and send out some messenger in your stead to bring this man to Antwerp.\"  \"We have made up our minds to accompany our friend, the grandson of the Charles Crawford you knew, sir,\" Rob told him, \"and all we can promise is that we mean to be very careful. If the man you will send around to us as a guide does his duty faithfully, we hope to get along fairly well. And believe us, sir, we feel that you have advised and assisted us even more generously than Mr. Crawford expected of you. We thank you a thousand times. Good-bye.\"  That night passed without anything unusual happening to disturb the three boys. Their hotel chanced to be situated in a quiet part of the seething city, so that they were not at all annoyed by patriotic outbursts. And boys as a rule have a happy faculty of losing their troubles in sleep.  With the coming of that next morning all of them were early astir. After breakfast they went in search of mounts, having secured some hints from the proprietor of the hotel.  Horses were certainly at a high premium just then in Flanders. Nearly every animal of any worth at all had been taken by the Belgian field forces for army use. If a few were by accident hidden, and escaped this search, they were apt to be discovered by the advancing Germans.  \"It would be of no use, anyway, getting hold of respectable nags,\" Rob explained, when he saw even Tubby gape at sight of the poor looking animals they had offered to them at exorbitant prices, \"because we'd never have the least chance to get anywhere on their backs. No matter how many passes we had from burgomasters, or even King Albert himself, somebody would be sure to take them away from us.\"  \"I suppose half a loaf _is_ better than no bread at all,\" complained Merritt with vivid recollections of the fine mounts he and his chums had sported on several occasions, notably when on the cattle ranch, and following Mexican war trails.  \"But _such_ a loaf!\" sighed Tubby, as he ran his hand over the bony back of the nearest quadruped, and wondered whether so weak looking a horse could long survive under his rather heavy weight.  \"They may turn out a heap better than they look,\" Rob told them. \"Sometimes it's the bony horses that can hold the pace in a grueling journey. But, after all, it's a case of Hobson's choice with us; either these nags, or walk.\"  \"Whew! better close the bargain then, Merritt; that is, if you think you can afford the price,\" Tubby hastened to say, for as may be easily understood, he was not very much in love with protracted walks, not having been built for a sprinter.  So Merritt bought four horses, and paid cash down for them, receiving a regular bill of sale from the dealer, to show they were his property. With them went old saddles and bridles, good enough for the purpose of the three scouts, but not of a type calculated to incite anyone to steal the same.  All that remained to be looked after now was that promised guide. If the good burgomaster of Antwerp kept his promise, they expected to find a native waiting at the hotel when they got back after their foray into the limited horse market.  And sure enough they found a swarthy Belgian there who said"]]]
