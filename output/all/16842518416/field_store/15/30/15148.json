The streets were broad, and laid out to cut the city into lozenge-shaped sections, instead of the conventional squares. In the center of the city stood a great lozenge-shaped building with a smooth, arched roof. From every section of the city, great swarms of people were flocking in the direction of the spot toward which the _Ertak_ was settling, on foot and in long, slim vehicles of some kind that apparently carried several people.  \"Lots of excitement down there, Mr. Correy,\" I commented. \"Better tell Mr. Kincaide to order up all hands, and station a double guard at the port. Have a landing force, armed with atomic pistols and bombs, and equipped with menores, as an escort.\"  \"And the disintegrator-ray generators--you'll have them in operation, sir, just in case?\"  \"That might be well. But they are not to be used except in the greatest emergency, understand. Hendricks will accompany me, if it seems expeditious to leave the ship, leaving you in command here.\"  \"Very well, sir!\" I knew the arrangement didn't suit him, but he was too much the perfect officer to protest, even with a glance. And besides, at the moment, he was very busy with orders to the men in the control room, forward, as he conned the ship to the place he had selected to set her down.  But busy as he was, he did not forget the order to tune up the disintegrator-ray generators.                       *      *      *      *      *  While the great circular door of the _Ertak_ was backing out ponderously from its threaded seat, suspended by its massive gimbals, I inspected the people of this new world.  My first impression was that they were a soldiery people, for there were no jostling crowds swarming around the ship, such as might have been expected. Instead, the citizenry stood at ease in a sort of military formation of numerous small companies, each apparently in charge of an officer. These companies were arranged to form a long wide avenue, leading to the city, and down this avenue a strange procession was coming toward the ship.  I should make it clear at this point that these Strobians were, in form, very similar to Earth-men, although somewhat shorter in stature, and certainly more delicately formed. Perhaps it would be better to say they resembled the Zenians, save for this marked difference: the Strobians were exceedingly light in color, their skins being nearly translucent, and their hair a light straw color. The darkest hair I saw at any time was a pale gold, and many had hair as colorless as silver--which I should explain is a metal of Earth somewhat resembling aluminum in appearance.  The procession was coming toward the ship slowly, the marchers apparently chanting as they came, for I could see their lips moving. They were dressed in short kirtles of brilliant colors--scarlet, green, orange, purple--and wore brilliant belts suspended about their waists by straps which crossed over their breasts and passed over each shoulder.  Each marcher bore a tall staff from which flew a tiny pennon of the same color as his chief garment. At the top of each staff was a metal ornament, which at first glance I took to be the representation of a fish. As they came closer, I saw that this was not a good guess, for the device was without a tail.                       *      *      *      *      *  \"The exit port is open, sir,\" reported Hendricks. \"The people seem far from hostile, and the air is very good. What are your orders?\"  \"There will be no change, I think,\" I said as I hurried toward the now open door. \"Mr. Kincaide will be in command of the guard at the port. You and I, with a small landing force, will advance to meet this procession. Make sure that there are a number of extra menores carried by the escort; we shall need them.\"  \"Yes, sir!\" Hendricks snapped a command and the landing force fell into place behind us as we passed through the circular doorway, and out onto the rocky ground of Strobus.  The procession stopped instantly, and the chanting died to a murmur. The men forming the living wall on each side bowed their heads and made a quick sign; a peculiar gesture, as though they reached out to shake an invisible hand.  The leader of the procession, a fine-featured man with golden hair, walked forward with bowed head, chanting a single phrase over and over again in a voice as sweet as a woman's: \"_Toma annerson ... toma annerson ... toma annerson...._\"  \"Sounds friendly enough,\" I whispered to Hendricks. \"Hand me an extra menore; I'll see....\"  The chanting stopped, and the Strobian lifted his head.  \"Greetings!\" he said. \"You are welcome here.\"                       *      *      *      *      *  I think nothing ever surprised me more, I stared at the man like a fool, my jaw dropping, and my eyes bulging. For the man spoke in a language of Earth; spoke it haltingly and poorly, but recognizably.  \"You--you speak English?\" I faltered. \"Where--where did you learn to speak this language?\"  The Strobian smiled, his face shining as though he saw a vision.  \"Toma annerson,\" he intoned gravely, and extended his right hand in a greeting which Earth-men have offered each other for untold centuries!  I shook hands with him gravely, wondering if I were dreaming.  \"I thank you for your welcome,\" I said, gathering my wits at last. \"We come as friends, from worlds not unlike your own. We are glad that you meet us as friends.\"  \"It was so ordered. _He_ ordered it so and Artur is His mouthpiece in this day.\" The Strobian weighed every word carefully before he uttered it speaking with a solemn gravity that was most impressive.  \"Artur?\" I questioned him. \"That is your name?\"  \"That is my name,\" he said proudly. \"It came from He Who Speaks who gave it to my father many times removed.\"  There were many questions in my mind, but I could not be outdone in courtesy by this kindly Strobian.  \"I am John Hanson,\" I told him, \"Commander of the Special Patrol Service ship _Ertak_. This is Avery Hendricks, my third officer.\"  \"Much of that,\" said Artur slowly, \"I do not understand. But I am greatly honored.\" He bowed again, first to me, and then to Hendricks, who was staring at me in utter amazement. \"You will come with us now, to the Place?\" Artur added.  I considered swiftly, and turned to Hendricks.  \"This is too interesting to miss,\" I said in an undertone. \"Send the escort back with word for Mr. Correy that these people are very friendly, and we are going on into the city. Let three men remain with us. We will keep in communication with the ship by menore.\"                       *      *      *      *      *  Hendricks gave the necessary orders, and all our escort, save for three men, did a brisk about face and marched back to the ship. The five of us, conducted by Artur, started for the city, the rest of the procession falling in behind us. Behind the double file of the procession, the companies that had formed the living wall marched twenty abreast. Not all the companies, however, for perhaps a thousand men, in all, formed a great hollow square about the _Ertak_, a great motionless guard of honor, clad in kirtles like the pennon-bearers in the procession, save that their kirtles were longer, and pale green in color. The uniform of their officers was identical, save that it was somewhat darker in color, and set of with a narrow black belt, without shoulder straps.  We marched on and on, into the city, down the wide streets, walled with soaring buildings that shone with an iridescent lustre, toward the great domed building I had seen from the _Ertak_.  The streets were utterly deserted, and when we came close to the building I saw why. The whole populace was gathered there; they were drawn up around the building in orderly groups, with a great lane opened to the mighty entrance.  There were women waiting there, thousands of them, the most beautiful I have ever seen, and in my younger days I had eyes that were quick to note a pretty face.  Through these great silent ranks we passed majestically, and I felt very foolish and very much bewildered. Every head was bowed as though in reverence, and the chanting of the men behind us was like the singing of a hymn.                       *      *      *      *      *  At the head of the procession, we entered the great domed, lozenge-shaped building, and I stared around in amazement.  The structure was immense, but utterly without obstructing columns, the roof being supported by great arches buttressed to pilasters along the walls, and furnished with row after row of long benches of some polished, close-grained red wood, so clear that it shone brilliantly.  There were four great aisles, leading from the four angles of the lozenge, and many narrower ones, to give ready access to the benches, all radiating from a raised dais in the center, and the whole building illuminated by bluish globes of light that I recognized from descriptions and visits to scientific museums, as replicas of an early form of the ethon tube.  These things I took in at a glance. It was the object upon the huge central dais that caught and held my attention.  \"Hendricks!\" I muttered, just loud enough to make my voice audible above the solemn chanting. \"Are we dreaming?\"  \"No, sir!\" Hendricks' eyes were starting out of his head, and I have no doubt I looked as idiotic as he did. \"It's there.\"  On the dais was a gleaming object perhaps sixty feet long--which is a length equal to the height of about ten full-sized men. It was shaped like an elongated egg--like the metal object surmounting the staffs of the pennon-bearers!  And, unmistakably, it was a ship for navigating space.                "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28705"],["title","The God in the Box (#2)"],["body","       *      *      *      *      *  As we came closer, I could make out details. The ship was made of some bluish, shining metal that I took to be chromium, or some compound of chromium, and there was a small circular port in the side presented to us. Set into the blunt nose of the ship was a ring of small disks, reddish in color, and deeply pitted, whether by electrical action or oxidization, I could not determine. Around the more pointed stern were innumerable small vents, pointed rearward, and smoothly stream-lined into the body. The body of the ship fairly glistened, but it was dented and deeply scratched in a number of places, and around the stern vents the metal was a dark, iridescent blue, as though stained by heat.  The chanting stopped as we reached the dais, and I turned to our guide. He motioned that Hendricks and I were to precede him up a narrow, curving ramp that led upwards, while the three Zenians who accompanied us were to remain below. I nodded my approval of this arrangement, and slowly we made our way to the top of the great platform, while the pennon-bearers formed a close circle around its base, and the people, who had surrounded the great building filed in with military precision and took seats. In the short space of time that it took us to reach the top of the dais, the whole great building filled itself with humanity.  Artur turned to that great sea of faces and made a sweeping gesture, as of benediction.  \"Toma annerson!\" His voice rang out like the clear note of a bell, filling that vast auditorium. In a great wave, the assembled people seated themselves, and sat watching us, silent and motionless.                       *      *      *      *      *  Artur walked to the edge of the dais, and stood for a moment as though lost in thought. Then he spoke, not in the language which I understood, but in a melodious tongue which was utterly strange. His voice was grave and tender; he spoke with a degree of feeling which stirred me even though I understood no word that he spoke. Now and again I heard one recognizable sequence of syllables, that now familiar phrase, \"toma annerson.\"  \"Wonder what that means, sir?\" whispered Hendricks. \"'Toma annerson?' Something very special, from the way he brings it out. And do you know what we are here for, and what all this means?\"  \"No,\" I admitted. \"I have some ideas, but they're too wild for utterance. We'll just go slow, and take things as they come.\"  As I spoke, Artur concluded his speech, and turned to us.  \"John Hanson,\" he said softly, \"our people would hear your voice.\"  \"But--but what am I to say?\" I stammered. \"I don't speak their language.\"  \"It will be enough,\" he muttered, \"that they have heard your voice.\"  He stood aside, and there was nothing for me to do but walk to the edge of the platform, as he had done, and speak.  My own voice, in that hushed silence, frightened me. I would not have believed that so great a gathering could maintain such utter, deathly silence. I stammered like a school-child reciting for the first time before his class.  \"People of Strobus,\" I said--this is as nearly as I remember it, and perhaps my actual words were even less intelligent--\"we are glad to be here. The welcome accorded us overwhelms us. We have come ... we have come from worlds like your own, and ... and we have never seen a more beautiful one. Nor more kindly people. We like you, and we hope that you will like us. We won't be here long, anyway. I thank you!\"                       *      *      *      *      *  I was perspiring and red-faced by the time I finished, and I caught Hendricks in the very act of grinning at his commander's discomfiture. One black scowl wiped that grin off so quickly, however, that I thought I must have imagined it.  \"How was that, Artur?\" I asked. \"All right?\"  \"Your words were good to hear, John Hanson,\" he nodded gravely. \"In behalf----\"  The hundreds of blue lights hung from the vaulted roof clacked suddenly and went out. Almost instantly they flashed on again--and then clicked out. A third time they left us momentarily in darkness, and, when they came on again, a murmur that was like a vast moan rose from the sea of humanity surrounding the dais. And the almost beautiful features of Artur were drawn and ghastly with pain.  \"They come!\" he whispered. \"At this hour, they come!\"  \"Who, Artur?\" I asked quickly. \"Is there some danger?\"  \"Yes. A very great one. I will tell you, but first--\" He strode to the edge of the dais and spoke crisply, his voice ringing out like the thin cry of military brass. The thousands in the auditorium rose in unison, and swept down the aisles toward the doors.  \"Now,\" cried Artur, \"I shall tell you the meaning of that signal. For three or four generations, we have awaited it with dread. Since the last anniversary of his coming, we have known the time was not far off. And it had to come at this moment! But this tells you nothing.                       *      *      *      *      *  \"The signal warns us that the Neens have at last made good their threat to come down upon us with their great hordes. The Neens were once men like ourselves, who would have none of Him\"--and Artur glanced toward the gleaming ship upon the dais--\"nor His teachings. They did not like the new order, and they wandered off, to join those outcasts who had broken His laws, and had been sent to the smaller land of this world, where it is always warm, and where there are great trees thick with moss, and the earth underfoot steams, and brings forth wriggling life. Neen, we call that land, as this larger land is called Libar.  \"These men of Neen became the enemies of Libar, and of us who call ourselves Libars, and follow His ways. In that warm country they became brown, and their hair darkened. They increased more rapidly than did the Libars, and as they forgot their learning, their bodies developed in strength.  \"Yet they have always envied us; envied us the beauty of our women, and of our cities. Envied us those things which He taught us to make, and which their clumsy hands cannot fashion, and which their brutish brains do not understand.  \"And now they have the overwhelming strength that makes us powerless against them.\" His voice broke, he turned his face away, that I might not see the agony written there.  \"Toma annerson!\" he muttered. \"Ah, toma annerson!\" The words were like a prayer.  \"Just a minute, Artur!\" I said sharply. \"What weapons have they? And what means of travel?\"  He turned with a hopeless gesture.  \"They have the weapons we have,\" he said. \"Spears and knives and short spears shot from bows. And for travel they have vast numbers of monocars they have stolen from us, generation after generation.\"  \"Monocars?\" I asked, startled.  \"Yes. He Who Speaks gave us that secret. Ah, He was wise; to hear His voice was to feel in touch with all the wisdom of all the air!\" He made a gesture as though to include the whole universe.                       *      *      *      *      *  There were a score of questions in my mind, but there was no time for them then. I snatched my menore from its clip on my belt, and adjusted it quickly. It was a huge and cumbersome thing, the menore of that day, but it worked as well as the fragile, bejeweled things of today. Maybe better. The guard posted outside the ship responded instantly.  \"Commander Hanson emanating,\" I shot at him. \"Present my compliments to Mr. Correy, and instruct him as follows: He is to withdraw the outside guard instantly, and proceed with the _Ertak_ to the large domed building in the center of the city. He will bring the _Ertak_ to rest at the lowest possible altitude above the building, and receive further orders at that time. Repeat these instructions.\"  The guard returned the orders almost word for word, and I removed the menore with a little flourish. Oh, I was young enough in those days!  \"Don't worry any more, Artur,\" I said crisply. \"I don't know who _He_ was, but we'll show you some tricks you haven't seen yet! Come!\"  I led the way down the ramp, Hendricks, Artur, and the three Zenians following. As we came out into the daylight, a silent shadow fell across the great avenue that ran before the entrance, and there, barely clearing the shining roof of the auditorium, was the sleek, fat bulk of the _Ertak_. Correy had wasted no time in obeying orders.  Correy could smell a fight further than any man I ever knew.                       *      *      *      *      *  From her emergency landing trap, the _Ertak_ let down the cable elevator, and the six of us, Hendricks, Artur, the three Zenians of the crew, and myself, were shot up into the hull. Correy was right there by the trap to greet me.  \"What are the orders, sir?\" he asked, staring curiously at Artur. \"Is there trouble brewing?\"  \"I gather that there is, but we'll talk about that in a moment--in the navigating room.\" I introduced Artur and Correy as we hurried forward, and as soon as the door of the navigating room had closed on the three of us, I turned to Artur with a question.  \"Now, where will we find the enemy, these Neens? Have you any idea?\"  \"Surely,\" nodded Artur. \"They come from their own country, to the south. The frontier is the narrow strip of land that connects Libar with Neen, and since the alarm has been sounded, the enemy is already at the frontier, and the forces of my people and the enemy are already met.\"  \"I don't know anything about the set-up,\" put in Correy, \"but that sounds like poor management to me. Haven't you any advance guards, or spies, or outposts?\"  Artur shook his head sadly.  \"My people are not warlike. We who spread His teachings have tried to warn the masses, but they would not listen. The land of the Neens was far away. The Neens had never risen against the Libars. They never would. So my people reasoned.\"  \"And you think there is fighting in progress now?\" I asked. \"How did the word come?\"  \"By phone or radio, I presume,\" said Artur. \"We are in communication"]]]
