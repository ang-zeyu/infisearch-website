Gently she patted and stroked on the wound a paste made of ground rose petals, lime water, and egg white, the Sufi remedy he had taught her to make.  Lorenzo had used his knife to open the hole made by the arrow so that he would not tear Daoud's flesh pulling the barbed head out. While Lorenzo worked over him, Daoud drew upon Saadi's final teaching to him to defend himself against the pain. In his mind he began to create the drug called Soma. He envisioned it as a bowl of glowing, silver-colored liquid, and he believed it could form a capsule around any part of his body where there was pain and wall it off from the rest of himself, at the same time filling him with a feeling of well being.  _Once you have experienced the effects of material drugs on your body and learned to master them_, Saadi said to him, _you have the knowledge you need to create a drug of the mind, Soma. This is more powerful and more reliable, and it will not harm your body in any way. Indeed, Soma will make your body stronger. It will calm your mind, fill you with peace, sometimes give you visions. But if you should suddenly need all your faculties, they are yours at once. The drug is gone in an instant._  It was Saadi's teaching that whatever a man could accomplish with drugs, he could accomplish more effectively and reliably with his mind alone. A trained man could envision a drug that would serve any desired purpose. And thus a man could transcend the Hashishiyya reliance on administered drugs.  While he had drunk from the bowl of Soma and it had flooded through his body, Daoud's fingers had gripped the little leather case hung around his neck that contained the Sufi tawidh, the numerological invocation that he believed would speed his healing. A river of blood had poured out of his leg when Lorenzo drew out the arrow, and he had fainted. Sophia had stitched the wound with cotton thread that was now black with congealed blood.  Now Sophia laid a clean, folded linen cloth over the wound, used another strip of linen to tie the poultice to his leg, and then pulled the blanket up over him. Their eyes had not met once during the time she was caring for him. He found to his surprise that he had to know what she was thinking and feeling.  As if sensing his need, she spoke. \"I have wanted to tell you, but you were too sick to understand me. D'Ucello, the podesta, came here the night of the uprising, looking for you and Lorenzo. As we planned, I told him you had both gone to Perugia.\"  Daoud's body went cold. He felt as if he were being stalked, and the hunter was closing in.  \"Did he believe you?\" he asked.  She shrugged. \"He blustered some, but the cardinal ordered him off in the end. I think he must have hoped to find you among the dead or wounded at the Monaldeschi palace.\"  Daoud rolled over in bed, the wooden frame creaking, and the pain tore through his leg like the slash of a scimitar. He groaned through clenched teeth. Despite his ability to shield his mind from pain when it took him unexpectedly like this, it could hurt like the torments of the damned.  \"What are you doing?\"  He gasped. \"Trying to get up. D'Ucello will be back, and he must not see me wounded.\" He tried to sit up, and she laid her hand, firm and cool, on his forehead and pushed him back against the pillows.  \"You are in more danger from fever than you are from d'Ucello,\" she said, letting her hand rest on his forehead.  \"You will be surprised at how quickly the wound heals,\" he said, touching the tawidh at his neck. \"As for fever, it is healthy. It burns out impurities.\" He laughed bitterly. \"I hope it is burning the stupidity out of me.\"  \"You--stupid?\" She laughed.  He did not join her. It pleased him a little, in the midst of his anguish and self-disgust, to see that she thought well of him. But she was wrong about him--and her life depended on him, and that thought made him feel worse.  \"De Gobignon was waiting for me. He knew I was coming for the Tartars. He _knew_.\"  \"How much could he have known?\" she asked. \"No one knew what your plans were.\"  \"Sophia, if de Gobignon had not been there, I would have been able to kill those two barbarian pigs easily. I did my best, with all my skill, all my training, all my experience, and it went for nothing.\"  That was a pain Soma would not shield him from, the pain of failure. It felt like a mace blow to his chest every time he remembered the fight in the blackness of the spice pantry.  To drive away the damnable memory of being routed by the Christians, he had to concentrate on the present and the future.  \"Send someone to fetch Sordello to me.\"  \"You should be resting.\"  He laughed and touched her hand lightly. \"Resting! Our enemies are not resting.\" She sighed, but went.  When Sordello entered Daoud's room, Lorenzo followed him closely, eyes boring into the back of the mercenary's skull. Sophia entered behind Lorenzo.  Trembling, Sordello knelt by Daoud's bed. \"I feared for you, Messer David. I am happy to see you looking so well.\"  Would Sordello give up the pleasures of hashish and the promise of a paradise with beautiful women? What reward could Simon de Gobignon offer him that could be more enticing?  _Yet, I have always known that this man was a two-edged sword that could turn in my hand._  \"The Monaldeschi were prepared for us,\" said Daoud. \"They were armed and on their battlements when we came. Someone warned them.\"  \"You do not suspect me, Messer David?\" Sordello, crouched on the floor by Daoud's bed, looked up slyly sideways at him. \"I would be a fool to injure one who has been so great a benefactor to me.\"  Daoud felt rage boil up inside him at Sordello's false abjectness. He glared at the old bravo and saw a faint tremor in his jaw.  Propping himself up on one elbow, he leaned toward Sordello. \"Your fawning insults me. I think you lie.\"  Hatred briefly twisted Sordello's face. Then a knowing smile made it even uglier.  \"Messer David, if I had told the Count de Gobignon what I know about you, you would surely be dead by now.\"  Daoud forced himself to his feet. The pain shot through him like a lightning bolt, but in his fury he ignored it. He bent down and seized Sordello's throat with his right hand. He fell back sitting on the bed, pulling the popeyed bravo toward him so that his good knee pressed into the Sordello's chest.  Somewhere, nearby, he heard Sophia cry out in protest, but he paid no attention.  \"Confess that it was you, and I will kill you quickly,\" Daoud whispered. \"I have shown you paradise, and I can show you hell. If you do not give yourself up now, and I find out later that it was you, I will inflict torments of mind and body on you beyond your imagining.\"  \"David, stop, you will kill him!\" Sophia screamed. She gripped Daoud's arm, digging her nails into his muscle.  Gradually Daoud released his hold on the corded throat. With his eyes alone, employing the Hashishiyya \"look that imprisons,\" he held Sordello fast. The bravo's eyes were bloodshot and red-rimmed.  He was glad Sophia had stopped him. She must have realized that he would regret it if he killed Sordello in a fit of rage. If Sordello had not betrayed them, his false reports to Simon de Gobignon would still be useful. And in any case his sudden disappearance immediately after the attack on the Monaldeschi palace would draw de Gobignon's attention.  \"If it is not you, then there is another among us who told Simon de Gobignon about my plans. If you want to save your life, you will find out who it is.\"  \"I promise you, Messere.\" Sordello's voice was a hoarse croak. \"Whoever the escremento is, I will deliver his life into your hands.\"  Sordello stood up, then turned to Sophia and bowed.  \"Madonna,\" Sordello gasped. \"My eternal gratitude--\"  \"Just get out,\" Sophia snapped.  Was there a suggestion of a leer in Sordello's lumpy face as he stared at Sophia? But pain spread from the wound in Daoud's leg in great ripples through him, and he lay back and concentrated on the Sufi exercise that detached him from his body.  The heavy oak door closed behind Sordello. They were all three silent for a moment. Then Lorenzo jerked the door open and looked out into the corridor. He nodded, indicating Sordello had truly gone.  \"It might have been wiser to strangle him,\" said Lorenzo. \"He has all our lives in his hands.\"  Daoud held up his hand. \"What he said was true. He could have delivered us to our enemies before the attack. I believe he is still in my power.\"         *       *       *       *       *  When alone with Sophia, Daoud lay back on his cushions. She stood looking down at him, and he wondered if that was pity he saw in her face.  \"You are in such pain,\" she said.  He shook his head. \"It is nothing.\"  \"I do not mean the pain of the body.\"  She understood, then, what he was feeling. He smiled at her and shut his eyes.  She sat in silence on the edge of the bed while he lay there, brooding. Again he escaped into drowsiness. His mind drifted back to the sands of Egypt. He dreamed again of riding as a Mameluke.  When he woke, a short time had passed, and Sophia was still sitting there, gazing down at him.  Hints of a new plan began to come together in his mind. As fever purged him of poison, it had brought him dreams of battle. Not of intrigues with the priests and bishops around the pope. Not of ambushes in narrow streets. Rather, open war.  That was the meaning of those dreams. Perhaps God Himself had sent them. He was called upon to wage jihad against the enemies of Islam as a Mameluke, on horseback, at the head of an army.  He held out his arm to Sophia. \"Help me up. You and Lorenzo and I must meet with Ugolini.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Later that morning, a heavy spring rain hammered on the windows of Ugolini's cabinet. The storm had so darkened the room that the cardinal's servants had lit extra candles. Daoud, Lorenzo, and Sophia sat in a semicircle"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28516"],["title","The Saracen: The Holy War (#3)"],["body","from Ugolini's worktable.  The painted glass eyes of Ugolini's stuffed owl glared disapprovingly down from the bookshelves at Daoud, who had a sense that the cardinal felt as the owl looked. The skull on the table seemed to be laughing at him.  He understood now what he had to do, but would the others, especially Ugolini, go along with it? Over Ugolini's frantic protests he had insisted on inciting the Filippeschi to attack the Palazzo Monaldeschi. That attack having failed of its purpose, would the three of them still accept Daoud's authority? Ugolini, surely, would think that events had proved him right about the futility of the attack on the Monaldeschi. How could he be won over to the idea of a wider war? _Make war utterly on the idolaters_--that, he had decided, was the meaning of his dream.  \"Manfred's supporters, the Ghibellini, must take the pope captive,\" he said. \"I know that you would prefer peace to war, but now that I have tried to kill the Tartars and failed, we do not have that choice.\" It was best, he thought, to admit his failure openly before Ugolini threw it in his face.  The cardinal's eyes were almost as wide and as stark as the owl's. \"You would plunge the whole of Italy into war?\"  \"No,\" said Daoud, \"but that is what is going to happen. The one thing that has kept the French out of Italy is the pope's refusal to give the Christian kings, especially the king of France, permission to ally themselves with the Tartars. But now that Urban is ill, he may give King Louis what he wants. When the pope allows the alliance, Louis will give his brother Charles permission to attack Manfred. It is not I who will plunge Italy into war. I am proposing only that we act before the French do.\"  Ugolini shook his head. \"What do you mean, take the pope captive?\"  \"The Papal States are surrounded by cities ruled by Manfred's Ghibellino supporters. The nearest is Siena. With gold and with timely warnings about the danger from the French, we can persuade Siena to move against the pope.\" He held up his fist. \"And then we can make sure that the next pope elected is favorable to Manfred. And through him, well disposed toward peace with Islam.\"  It was the same sort of plan, Daoud thought, as inciting the Filippeschi against the Monaldeschi. But Lorenzo had already visited Siena and made sure that the Ghibellini of Siena, with Daoud's help, could raise a far greater army than the pope could muster in Orvieto. This time he would succeed.  \"Impossible!\" Ugolini cried. \"No king can control the Papacy. The Hohenstaufen have been trying to rule over the popes for centuries, and for centuries they have failed.\"  \"Perhaps it takes a stranger to see that where the Hohenstaufen failed, the French are about to succeed,\" said Daoud. \"France is now the strongest kingdom in Europe. If Manfred does not get control of the pope and the cardinals, the next pope will be under the protection of the French, and will have to do whatever they want.\"  \"Urban is a sick man,\" said Ugolini. \"There is not a cardinal who would risk a wager that he will live to see the year 1265. He will not call for the French to save him when he knows the angels are coming to get him.\"  \"No, there I must disagree with Your Eminence,\" said Lorenzo, lounging in a large chair facing Ugolini's table. \"Urban is a Frenchman, and he will work to bring the French into Italy until the moment the angels knock at his door.\"  Sophia, who had been sitting quietly in an armless straight-back chair with her hands folded in her lap, said, \"The pope will blame the Ghibellini for the attack on the Monaldeschi. He will want help, and he will ask it from the French even if it means Christians joining the Tartars in a crusade the pope does not really want.\"  \"Very shrewd,\" said Daoud with a smile in her direction. \"Except that the pope had decided before the attack on the Monaldeschi to approve the alliance with the Tartars. As we know from his persuading Fra Tomasso to switch sides. It was because the pope had clearly turned against us that I planned to kill the Tartars.\"  Daoud was tired of sitting. Despite the pain in his leg, he used his stick to push himself to his feet and stepped out of the window recess. He limped over to Ugolini's table.  \"We must send Lorenzo to Siena with enough of our precious stones to raise an army big enough to overwhelm the papal soldiery and the Orvieto militia. It may take time to persuade the Sienese to act. It will take more time to muster an army and march on Orvieto. We must begin as quickly as we can. With the pope in Ghibellino hands, with the Ghibellini in a position to sway the outcome of the next papal election, we may yet keep the French out of Italy.\"  And that, he thought, would keep crusaders and Tartars out of the Dar al-Islam.  Ugolini's shrug spoke more of despair than of acquiescence. \"Certainly the French will come if we do nothing. You are right about that. Do as you will. It is a miracle we have survived this long.\"  Strange, Daoud thought. Ugolini saw their mere survival as miraculous. To Daoud, failure so far to put a final stop to the alliance of Christians and Tartars made him wonder whether God disapproved of him.         *       *       *       *       *  Once he accepted the fact that he had to go, Lorenzo had hoped the rain would continue. Under its cover his leaving the city was less likely to be noticed or impeded. But by mid-afternoon, the hour of None, when he was packed and mounted, a spare horse trotting behind him, a bright, hot sun had come out, and the puddles in the narrow streets were turning to steam.  At the Porta Maggiore he stopped when he saw two clerks seated at tables on either side of the gateway, one questioning each person entering the town, the other examining those leaving. A dozen of the podesta's men in yellow and blue stood by to keep people in line. Each clerk consulted what appeared to be a list on a scroll and on another scroll wrote down the names of those he questioned.  Only two days ago Sophia had told d'Ucello that David of Trebizond and his man Giancarlo were in Perugia. Now, Lorenzo thought, those damned clerks were probably watching for their return. They could have been set at the gate the morning after the attack on the Monaldeschi palace.  He smiled ironically as he remembered how, last summer, he had sat as these clerks did now, at the gateway to Lucera waiting to catch a certain Saracen newly arrived from Egypt.  Now, thought Lorenzo, if he tried to leave Orvieto he would not only be stopped and possibly arrested, he would be as good as telling the podesta that he and David had never been out of the town at all.  Lorenzo clenched his fists. He felt like a tuna caught in a net.  _And if I stand here much longer staring they'll notice me and haul me in._  He quickly turned his horses away from the gate and headed back to Ugolini's mansion.         *       *       *       *       *  At the beginning of the third Nocturn, Lorenzo, David, and a servant of Ugolini's named Riccardo, whom they had chosen for his size and strength, emerged from an alley near the north side of the city wall.  David wore a hood pulled low over his face. He limped and walked with a stick. Lorenzo had advised against his being out in the street at all, but David had answered that the watch did not know he was in Orvieto and would not be looking for him.  Lorenzo was amazed at how rapidly David had gotten better. He had never seen a man walking only two days after taking a bad arrow wound in the leg. The Muslims who taught David the art of healing must be even better than Jewish physicians.  As they walked, Lorenzo made David recite the names of half a dozen prominent Perugian merchants who were supporters of King Manfred. If the podesta were to question David about his whereabouts the night of the Filippeschi uprising, these men would bear witness that David and Lorenzo had been in Perugia.  \"If d'Ucello does question you, how will you explain that you are back in Orvieto without having been seen entering through the gate?\" Lorenzo asked him.  \"I will tell him--with the greatest reluctance--that the line was very long when I arrived and that I was in haste to enter, so I bribed the men on duty to let me by. The more time passes before he discovers my presence in Orvieto, the more believable that will be.\"  \"If he suspects you of anything, he will arrest you no matter how good a story you tell him,\" Lorenzo said.  David stopped walking and rested his hand on Lorenzo's shoulder. \"That is why you must go tonight, my friend. And come back quickly with an army from Siena.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Lorenzo had a pack over his shoulder and wore a long traveling cloak. Riccardo carried a coil of rope. Ahead of them was a small stone shed built against the wall, beside one of the round guard towers.  Lorenzo was not particularly frightened by the ordeal ahead. He had done enough climbing in his younger days. But he was repelled by the thought that through the large opening in the floor of the little house the people of this quarter dumped, not only their garbage, but also the contents of their chamber pots.  They went quietly to the door of the shed. There was a guard in the tower above them, though he would have no reason to watch the garbage chute.  Riccardo put a meaty hand on the rough-hewn door. It gave without a struggle. Not even locked, thought Lorenzo. He supposed the podesta, may his ballocks wrinkle up like prunes, had not thought that anyone would choose this ignominious way to escape from the city.  \"Sophia told me to tell you she would miss you,\" David said.  \"Kiss her for me,\" said Lorenzo.  _Wonder if David has bedded Sophia yet._  Riccardo filled the little room so that Lorenzo felt himself being crowded to the edge of the chute.  \"Hey! Riccardo! Push me down _after_ you have the rope around me.\"  \"Sorry, Messere.\" The burly man tied the rope tightly around Lorenzo's waist,"]]]
