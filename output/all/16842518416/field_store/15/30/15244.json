And there are other serious flaws in the plan. The incentive, of course, lies in the certain knowledge that we are using up the internal heat of Antrid so rapidly that less than a century of life now remains to its peoples. Our power is produced by admitting water to the interior through myriads of tubes that serve the double purpose of introducing the water and conveying the generated steam back to the surface, where it produces electricity by driving great turbine generators. This electricity is distributed by charging the copper shell and the ground beneath at high frequency; it is collected from the air between by the heaters and various machines that use it. But the shortage is ever more serious and Antrid is cooling off. Thus the need for the k-metal and thus the sending of Antazzo. And now for the flaws:  \"The Zara, in killing Antazzo, frustrated her own plans, as he alone, of all her people, knew how to use this marvelous energy producer. Realizing this, she set about to make friends with you two in the hope that the information might be obtained from you. That was a great mistake and raised an unexpected obstacle.\"  \"Well, I'll be damned!\" Blaine exploded. \"No wonder she tried her wiles on me. Tried to make a sucker out of me, didn't she?\"  Dantor smiled knowingly. \"More about Clyone later,\" he said. \"Actually she is enamoured of you, Carson, and besides she is not really responsible for the mad plan herself. But that tale can wait.  \"The basic and most serious flaw in the plan is this: It can not possibly succeed, no matter how successful their attempts. What they do not understand and will not believe when I tell them is that the only result of the mad experiment will be the complete destruction of the solar system, Antrid and themselves included. Complete and horrible annihilation, I say!\" Dantor paused and eyed his visitors solemnly.                       *      *      *      *      *  In his mind's eye, Blaine could not visualize such a thing nor picture the possible explanation. But he saw that Tommy had paled and was clenching his fists. Tommy was more of a scientist; it must be he realized what this enterprise involved.  Dantor was speaking again, in low, intense tones: \"What they are refusing to see is that the delicate balance of the solar system will be disturbed if a body as large as Antrid is moved a half billion miles sunward. All bodies are kept in their orbits by a nice balance of mass attraction and centrifugal force; if a single one is altered all others are affected. What would happen is easy to calculate. First off, when Antrid approached the inner planets all bodies in the system would change their paths and the altered forces would cause severe earthquakes, tidal waves and other natural disturbances of disastrous extent.  \"These would increase in violence as Antrid drew nearer to the sun, and, if she finally took up her position as a new satellite of the Earth, the entire solar system would be in chaos. By this time, even if life still remained on Earth, it would quickly become extinct, for the vastly increased tidal forces on that body would flood the land to the peaks of the highest mountains. Earth would draw in closer to the sun due to loss of velocity and increased mass of the Earth-moon system. Tremendous new forces would rend asunder the Earth, its moon, and Antrid. Venus and Mars, following suit as the forces equalized, we would have a dead universe.\"                       *      *      *      *      *  Tommy believed him. That was apparent from his furrowed brow and grim set jaw. \"I'll never give 'em the secret of the k-metal,\" he grated. \"Nor will Carson; I'll gamble on that. We'll die here before they'll get it out of us.\"  Blaine seconded his remarks fervently. Then, turning to the Rulan scientist, \"Perhaps,\" he suggested, \"we might remain in hiding here for an indefinite period. Perhaps even we might contrive a way of getting to the store of k-metal and regaining possession of it. They'd be licked for sure then.\"  Dantor beamed. \"That is exactly why I sent for you,\" he said. Then sobering anew, he added, \"But I fear that would not be the end. They will not give up. Another emissary would be transmitted to duplicate Antazzo's exploit on Earth and in five of your years the danger would again be faced. They would take infinite precaution to prevent a second failure. We must make it forever impossible--now.\"  \"How can we? My God, it's hopeless!\" Blaine groaned.  \"Nothing is hopeless, my boy. Consider the plight of the Rulans. No, there is still hope and we will leave you to think it over--if you are willing. It is necessary that we Rulans show our faces above before we arouse the suspicions of the guards.\"  \"Of course we're willing. We'll stay as long as you say--and help.\" Blaine was intensely earnest and Tommy chimed in with his old time fervor and enthusiasm. But hope of success seemed remote.  A murmur of approval came from the assembled Rulans, and Dantor wiped a trace of moisture from his tired old eyes. \"Thank you,\" he said simply. \"This chamber is insulated from the searching rays of the crystal spheres. You are safe for the present and will be supplied with everything you need. And I shall return shortly to discuss the matter in further detail.\"                       *      *      *      *      *  The two Earth men were alone then, in the uncanny silence of the underground retreat, regarding each other with awed comprehension. What patient, hopeless creatures these Rulans were! Knowing they were doomed, and without thought of their own safety, they were bending their every effort to the impossible task of saving the universe from the madness of the Llotta.  \"What do you know about that?\" Tommy said, after a while.  \"It's true, what he said?\" Blaine asked. \"What would happen to our world, I mean--and to the rest?\"  \"Not a question of doubt. He's doped it out to a T. Smart guy, this Dantor.\"  \"What do you think? Is there a chance? Think--\"  \"Hush!\" Tommy interrupted him. \"Didn't you hear something?\"  The silence was ghastly; depressing. Blaine heard distinctly the beating of his own heart.  Then it was there again, that sound--a muffled scream from the other side of the stone door. A woman's scream of desperate entreaty. A shuddering, long-drawn moan, trailing off into deathly silence.     CHAPTER VI  _Ulana_   Blaine was tugging at the lever he had seen the Rulans use in opening the stone door from the inside. Tommy, less excited, tried to press one of the invisible cloaks into his free hand.  \"Here,\" he begged. \"Don't be a damn fool! They'll get you, the devils.\"  But the great block of stone was swinging already and the young pilot squeezed through and into the passage. He stumbled over the crumpled figure of a young girl and into the arms of one of the green-bronze guards.  Recovering instantly, he prodded the big fellow's ribs with the ray pistol. \"Stick 'em up!\" he snarled. Then, realizing the words were meaningless to the other, he said, \"Raise your hands--above your head! That's right. Stand still now, or I'll use the ray.\"  The guard, his face ghastly in the dim light, obeyed. But his wary eyes never left Blaine's for an instant.  A short way down the hall was the body of a young Rulan. Blaine shuddered as he saw it was headless. The ray had nearly missed that time, its energy spent before complete disintegration was effected. The girl lay still at his feet. With quick fingers he frisked the guard, finding his ray pistol and one gas grenade. What was he to do with the big fellow? He ought to let him have it, but somehow he couldn't.  Tommy was in the passageway then, invisible. The big guard stifled an amazed cry as his husky voice came out of the nothingness. These devils of Earth men! They had worked their evil magic on the Zara: had she not ordered that their lives be spared? And now there was this! His thoughts were written large on the ordinarily expressionless countenance, and Blaine was tempted to laugh at his affrighted dismay.  \"Come on, you bonehead,\" Tommy was saying in English. \"Bring the big bum inside. I'll carry the girl. Hurry; there'll be a million of them in a minute.\"  The girl's huddled figure was raised by unseen hands. Poised in mid-air for a moment, it floated joggily, unsteadily through the crack of the partly opened stone door. The guard, wide-mouthed and staring, muttered supplication to the war gods of Antrid.                       *      *      *      *      *  Safely inside the secret chamber, the Earth men made haste to truss up the guard and gag him. He was as tractable as a child under the invisible fingers of Tom Farley, with eyes imploring the evil spirits for mercy. And when Tommy's head appeared, drifting, unsupported by a body; to be followed by arms and shoulders that seemed to materialize from nothingness, the big fellow struggled panic-stricken in his bonds, shaking with superstitious terror.  Blaine straightened the girl's limbs where she lay on a low couch. She was breathing in low shuddering gasps, but a swift examination assured him she had not been harmed. Her beautifully chiseled ivory features were fixed in an expression of nameless dread. A mass of red-gold hair tumbled in confusion about her face and shoulders and when the pilot smoothed this back his heart did a most peculiar flip-flop. Sort of jumped into his throat and stuck there. This Rulan maiden was a vision of feminine loveliness if there ever was one; a dream.  Tommy watched him with a cynical smile, and said with mock contempt, \"So you're the guy who swore you'd never tangle up with a femme! Just a month ago, too. Now look: first you get this Zara woman all het up over you, and now this one's got you all het up over her. You make me sick!\"  There was no fitting retort. Besides, this thing that had come to him was too serious; too big. He couldn't kid about it--even with Tom. Why,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28883"],["title","The Copper-Clad World (#7)"],["body","'d always pictured this very girl in his thoughts; had always dreamed of meeting her some day. And here she was: a living, breathing reality. She was stirring, too, now; breathing easier. Her eyes opened wide; frightened, innocent ones like a child's, blue-gray and fringed with long lashes that raised dewy from the smooth ivory of her cheeks.                       *      *      *      *      *  \"Antius, my brother,\" she exclaimed, remembering, \"where is he? I saw--I thought--and the guard; he wanted to take me--oh!\"  Hands fluttering to cover her face, she was sobbing now, and Blaine raised her in his arms, clumsily attempting to comfort her.  \"Your brother,\" he said gently; \"I'm afraid the guard did away with him. He is no more.\"  \"Y-yes. I remember now; I saw.\" She shuddered and became still, her tousled golden head somehow finding a comfortable hollow beneath Blaine's shoulder.  And then, bravely, she sat erect and faced him. \"I--I suppose I shouldn't feel so badly,\" she said. \"We always expect it. But I was so fond of him, and he was the last. I am alone now.\"  \"Not alone,\" said Blaine; \"you have me--us, that is. We are the Earth men, you know. And you are safe here.\"  \"You are Carson?\" she inquired.  \"Yes, and my friend is Farley. That is how your people address us, but we had rather you call us Blaine and Tommy.\"  Tom Farley was grinning like an idiot. Didn't he have any more sense? Blaine thought. The girl would think he was making fun of her.  \"I am Ulana,\" she said simply.  The stone door opened silently and Tiedus slipped in, closing it swiftly behind him. He stared at the girl and at the trussed-up figure of the guard.  \"So!\" he exclaimed; \"this is the explanation.\" He breathed heavily as if he had run a long way, and his face was flushed with excitement.  \"Why? What's wrong?\" Blaine sensed a calamity.  \"The Zara--she must have seen you in the crystal. She is in a murderous rage and has visited her wrath on the Tritu Anu. Even now Dantor is on his way to Ilen-dar in answer to her summons.\"  \"Tiedus! I'm sorry. It is my fault entirely, but--but we heard Ulana cry out.\"  \"You did quite right, Carson. I should have done the same myself. And actually it makes little difference as far as we Rulans are concerned. We had not long to remain in this life, anyway. It is only that your hiding place might be revealed; that our plans to outwit the Llotta will fail.\"  \"You--you think she will make away with Dantor?\"  \"No; he is too valuable as a scientist. But the guards are awaiting her orders to repeat what happened in the Tritu Nogaru. She depends on the work of this laboratory a great deal, though it may be she will stay her hand.\"                       *      *      *      *      *  He was fussing with the controls of the small crystal as he spoke, and it sprang into life with the peculiar shifting milkiness. Then, clearly, they were looking into the council chamber at Ilen-dar. Clyone was there, pacing the floor. Dantor had just arrived with two of the green-bronze guards. The Zara, though nervous, was curiously calm and polite in her greeting of the aged scientist.  \"Dantor,\" she said, \"I want these Earth men.\"  \"I can not produce them, Your Majesty.\"  \"You will not, you mean.\" Clyone dropped her voice. \"For two reasons, Dantor, I must have these Earth men. And they must not be harmed. We need them on account of this k-metal that was brought by Antazzo, whose ugly body I so foolishly destroyed.\"  \"Two reasons, you said, oh Clyone?\" Dantor smiled knowingly.  \"Yes, two!\" said the Zara defiantly. \"I love this Carson, if you must know. And it is the only influence for good that ever has come into my life, Dantor. Oh, can't you see? I _must_ have them.\"  Blaine felt the hot blood mount to his temples. Tommy giggled like a moron. And Ulana drew away, ever so slightly, it was true, but still it was a definite withdrawal. Damn this leopard woman, anyway!  \"He is not for you, oh Clyone,\" Dantor was saying, \"To people of his world the very thought of such a woman as yourself is repulsive. A murderess he would call you! Their reactions to the taking of human life are entirely different from those of the Llotta. They are--you will pardon my saying it--more like those of the Rulans. The Llotta hold life cheap; they hold it dear. To your people you are not a bad woman; only a foolish one who sometimes, in the heat of passion, upsets their plans by the sudden snuffing out of a life that is valuable to those plans. Do you not see my point? He is different; to him you are the wickedest woman whom he has ever encountered--a monster.\"                       *      *      *      *      *  This was strong talk. Blaine drew a quick breath, anticipating another of her black rages and sudden death for poor old Dantor.  But Clyone suddenly was on her knees before the old scientist, pleading with him! Creature of strange caprices! Though humanlike in her emotions when in her softer moods, she was more like the feline to which Blaine had likened her, when those soft moods had passed.  Somewhere overhead, in the chambers of the Tritu Anu, there was the sound of a muffled explosion. Its shock was felt even here in the rock-hewn secret apartment. Tiedus went white. Quickly he manipulated the controls of the crystal sphere.  \"It can't be,\" he exclaimed. \"The guards would not disobey her, and she has ordered no action.\"  Swiftly, then, the searching ray of the apparatus swung back to the Tritu Anu itself, boring into the vast structure above them. One of the chemical laboratories was completely wrecked; maimed and dying Rulans were everywhere in the ruins. And those who staggered to their feet were shot down by the green-bronze guards who stood at the doorway.  Then, floor after floor was revealed in the all-seeing crystal. Everywhere it was the same. Merciless, cold-blooded destruction of the Rulan scientists, the most valuable of all in the Llott scheme of things. The Earth men were speechless with horror. Ulana once more buried her head in Carson's shoulder, moaning helplessly.  The scene shifted again to the council chamber of the palace in Ilen-dar. The Zara had not risen from her knees; she was still pleading with Dantor. She knew nothing of the massacre.  \"Ianito!\" Tiedus gasped. \"It must be he.\"                       *      *      *      *      *  And once more the view was changed. They were in the huge dome through which they had entered this mad world. Near the base of the great telescope a bullet-headed Llott was gazing into the depths of one of the crystal spheres, watching the carnage in the Tritu Anu and shouting his orders to the guards. \"Slay, slay, slay!\" he yelled. \"Not a Rulan shall remain in all Antrid. It is Ianito commanding you, Ianito the Great, master of our destinies, Dictator Supreme. Let not one escape; I command it. Then will come the great day of release; of conquest. A new home, a new world awaits you for the taking.\"  \"It is as I thought,\" Tiedus groaned: \"it is the end. He has taken things in his own hands at last.\"  The sphere went blank at his touch of a lever. His shoulders drooped and he spread his hands in a gesture of resignation.  \"What in the devil!\" Tommy exploded. \"Can this guy overrule the Zara? Is he that powerful?\"  \"He is actual ruler of the world that is Antrid; the power behind the throne. Clyone must do his bidding. He has seen that she is softening and resolved to speed things up himself.\"  A sudden bedlam could be heard in the corridor outside the stone door. This Ianito had gone the Zara one better. He had located them; probably saw the capture of the guard and the rescue of Ulana on the very spot where his minions now hammered for entrance.  \"They will take you!\" Tiedus whispered. \"There is no doubt as to the orders issued by Ianito. They will take you alive and bring you to him. You will be compelled to yield the secret of the metal that energizes.\"  \"Not on your life! We'll refuse.\" Blaine was very positive.  Tiedus smiled sadly. \"There is the pink gas, you know,\" he reminded him. \"No, Carson, there is but one way. You must go out into the jungle and hide for a time. Dantor will return later; it is certain he will be spared. And he will contrive some way of outwitting them. Come; there is a passage.\"  Blaine saw the wisdom of the argument. It was their only chance. There was a blast that shook the ground beneath their feet, and a huge section of the stone door was blown into the room. He drew Ulana close with a possessive encircling arm.                       *      *      *      *      *                     *      *      *      *      *  They were in a dark narrow passage now, following the whispered voice of Tiedus. It was damp and rankly odorous there in the darkness, and slimy things wriggled over the floor, brushing their ankles clammily. Behind them there was the roar of another explosion and the shouting of angry voices. The guards were in the secret chamber and hot on their trail.  Tiedus was fumbling with something ahead of them where they had halted; something that rattled and clanked and finally came free. A door opened into the deep-shadowed green of the jungle.  \"Go now, quickly,\" he warned them. \"Hide yourselves as far in as you dare go. You will be lost, but will later be directed by a mental message from Dantor. I shall advise him from the spirit world. We do that, you know, we Rulans. But I must leave you now; I must hold back the guards to give you time. Go, friends; farewell.\"  In his hand Tiedus held the ray pistol they had taken from the captured guard. He would account for a few of the Llotta at least. Blaine reached for him to restrain him; it was unthinkable that this fine lad should sacrifice himself for them. But Tiedus was gone; he had slipped away into the black depths of the passageway.  \"Come on, snap into it!\" Tommy grated, his voice brittle with suppressed emotion. \"The kid's right; let's go.\" He pushed his way into the matted growth of the jungle.
