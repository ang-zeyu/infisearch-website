To make the \"gilt-band china\" so beloved by the good housewives of the last century, the decorator puts the plate upon a horizontal wheel, holds his brush full of gold against it, and turns the wheel slowly. Sometimes the outlines of a design are printed and the coloring put in by hand. When broad bands of color are desired to be put around a plate or other article, the decorator sometimes brushes on an adhesive oil where the color is to go, and paints the rest of the plate with some water-color and sugar; then when the oil is partly dry, he dusts on the color in the form of powder. A plunge into water will wash away the water-color and leave the oil with the powder sticking to it. Shaded groundwork is made with an atomizer. Indeed, there are almost as many methods of decorating wares of clay as there are persons who work at it. The results are what might be expected from the prices; some articles are so cheap and gaudy that any one will soon tire of them. Others are really artistic and will be a \"joy forever\"--until they break.     VIII  HOW THE WHEELS OF A WATCH GO AROUND   If an electric automobile could be charged in fifteen seconds and then would run for forty hours without recharging, it would be looked upon as a great wonder; but to wind a watch in fifteen seconds and have it run for forty hours is so common that we forget what a wonder it is. When you wind your watch, you put some of the strength of your own right hand into it, and that is what makes it go. Every turn of the key or the stem winds up tighter and tighter a spring from one to two feet long, but so slender that it would take thousands to weigh a pound. This is the main spring. It is coiled up in a cup-shaped piece of metal called a \"barrel\"; and so your own energy is literally barreled up in your watch. The outer end of this spring is held fast by a hook on the inside of the barrel; the inner end is hooked to the hub of a wheel which is called the \"main wheel,\" and around this hub the spring is coiled.  This spring has three things to do. It must send the \"short hand,\" or hour hand, around the dial or face of the watch, once in twelve hours; it must send the \"long hand,\" or minute hand, around once an hour; and it must also send the little \"second hand\" around its own tiny circle once a minute. To do this work requires four wheels. The first or main wheel is connected with the winding arrangements, and sets in motion the second, or center wheel, so called because it is usually in the center of the watch. This center wheel revolves once an hour and turns the minute hand. By a skillful arrangement of cogs it also moves the hour hand around the dial once in twelve hours. The center wheel moves the third wheel. The chief business of the third wheel is to make the fourth turn in the same direction as the center wheel. The fourth wheel revolves once a minute, and with it turns the tiny second hand.  Suppose that a watch has been made with only the main spring, the four wheels, and the three hands, what would happen when it was wound? You can tell very easily by winding up a mechanical mouse or a train of cars or any other toy that goes by a spring. It will go fast at first, then more and more slowly, then it will stop. This sort of motion might do for a mouse, but it would not answer for a watch. A watch must move with steadiness and regularity. To bring this about, there is a fifth wheel. Its fifteen teeth are shaped like hooks, and it has seven accompaniments, the balance wheel, the hair spring, and five others. This wheel, together with its accompaniments, is able to stop the motion of the watch five times a second and start it again so quickly that we do not realize its having been stopped at all. A tiny arm holds the wheel firmly, and then lets it escape. Therefore, the fifth wheel and its accompaniments are called the \"escapement.\" This catching and letting go is what makes the ticking.  A watch made in this way would run very well until a hot day or a cold day came; then there would be trouble. Heat makes metals expand and makes springs less elastic. Therefore in a hot day the watch would go more slowly and so lose time; while in a cold day it would go too fast and would gain time. This fault is corrected by the balance, a wheel whose rim is not one circle, but two half-circles, and so cunningly made that the hotter this rim grows, the smaller its diameter becomes. In the rim of the wheel are tiny holes into which screws may be screwed. By adding screws or taking some away, or changing the position of some of them, the movement of the watch can be made to go faster or slower.  All this would be difficult enough to manage if a watch was as large as a cart wheel, with wheels a foot in diameter; but it does seem a marvel how so many kinds of wheels and screws and springs, one hundred and fifty in all, can be put into a case sometimes not more than an inch in diameter, and can find room to work; and it is quite as much of a marvel how they can be manufactured and handled.  Remembering how accurate every piece must be, it is no wonder that in Switzerland, where all this work used to be done by hand, a boy had to go to a \"watch school\" for fourteen years before he was considered able to make a really fine watch. He began at the beginning and was taught to make, first, wooden handles for his tools, then the tools themselves, such as files, screw drivers, etc. His next work was to make wooden watchcases as large as dinner-plates. After this, he was given the frame to which the various wheels of a watch are fastened and was taught how and where to drill the holes for wheels and screws. After lessons in making the finer tools to be used, he was allowed to make a watch frame. All this took several years, for he had to do the same work over and over until his teachers were satisfied with it. Then he was promoted to the second room. Here he learned to adjust the stem-winding parts, to do fine cutting and filing, and to make watches that would strike the hour and even the minute. Room three was called the \"train room,\" because the wheels of a watch are spoken of as \"the train.\" The model watch in this room was as large as a saucer. The young man had to study every detail of this, and also to learn the use of a delicate little machine doing such fine work that it could cut twenty-four hundred tiny cogs on one of the little wheels of a watch. In the fourth room he learned to make the escapement wheel and some other parts; and he had to make them, not merely passably, but excellently. In the fifth and last room, he must do the careful, patient work that makes a watch go perfectly. There are special little curves that must be given to the hair spring; and the screws on the balance wheel must be carefully adjusted. If the watch ran faster when it was lying down than when it was hanging up, he learned that certain ones of the bearings were too coarse and must be made finer. In short, he must be able to make a watch that, whether hanging up or lying down, and whether the weather was hot or cold, would not vary from correct time more than two and a half seconds a day at the most. Then, and not till then, was the student regarded as a first-class watchmaker.  The graduate of such a school knew how to make a whole watch, but he usually limited his work to some one part. Every part of a watch was made expressly for that watch, but sometimes a hundred different persons worked on it. The very best of the Swiss watches were exceedingly good; the poorest were very bad, and much worse to own than a poor American watch because it costs more to repair a Swiss watch than an American watch.  [Illustration: _Courtesy Waltham Watch Co._  WHERE WATCHES ARE MADE  Once a single man made a whole watch by hand. Now one watch may be the product of a hundred hands, each man doing his particular part.]  Even though in America the parts of watches are made by machinery, an apprentice has to undergo just as careful and just as extended training here as in Switzerland. A poor watch is worse than none at all, and careless work would not be tolerated in any watch factory. Of late even Switzerland has been importing American machinery in order to compete with the United States. These machines do such careful, minute, intricate work that, as you stand and watch them, you feel as if they must know what they are about. One of them takes the frame,--that is, the plates to which the wheels are fastened,--makes it of the proper thinness, cuts the necessary holes in it, and passes it over to the next machine, which is reaching out for it. The feeder gives the first machine another plate; and so the work goes on down a whole line of machines. At length the plate is taken in hand by a machine, or rather a group of machines, which can do almost anything. Before they let it go, they actually perform one hundred and forty-two different operations, each bringing it nearer completion. These machines are automatic, but nevertheless they must be constantly watched by expert machinists to keep them in order and make sure of their turning out perfect work.  While one line of machines has been perfecting the plate, others have been at work on screws and wheels and springs. As many of these as are needed for one watch are put into a little division of a tray and carried to another room for its jewels and the rest of its outfit. The jewels, which are pieces of rubies, sapphires, garnets, or even diamonds, are very valuable to a watch. When you know that the little wheels are in constant motion, and that the balance wheel, for instance, vibrates eighteen thousand times an hour, it is plain that a vast amount of wear comes upon the spot where "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2857"],["title","A Yellow God: An Idol of Africa (#0)"],["body","Illustration]   THE YELLOW GOD   AN IDOL OF AFRICA   By H.

Sir Robert Aylward, Bart., M.P., sat in his office in the City of London. It  was a very magnificent office, quite one of the finest that could be found  within half a mile of the Mansion House. Its exterior was built of Aberdeen  granite, a material calculated to impress the prospective investor with a  comfortable sense of security. Other stucco, or even brick-built, offices might  crumble and fall in an actual or a financial sense, but this rock-like edifice  of granite, surmounted by a life-sized statue of Justice with her scales,  admired from either corner by pleasing effigies of Commerce and of Industry,  would surely endure any shock. Earthquake could scarcely shake its strong  foundations; panic and disaster would as soon affect the Bank of England. That  at least was the impression which it had been designed to convey, and not  without success.    “There is so much in externals,” Mr. Champers-Haswell, Sir Robert’s partner, would say in his cheerful voice. “We are all of us influenced by them, however unconsciously. Impress the public, my dear  Aylward. Let solemnity without suggest opulence within, and the bread, or  rather the granite, which you throw upon the waters will come back to you after  many days.”  Mr. Aylward, for this conversation occurred before his merits or the depth of  his purse had been rewarded by a baronetcy, looked at his partner in the  impassive fashion for which he was famous, and answered:  “You mix your metaphors, Haswell, but if you mean that the public are fools who must be caught by advertisement, I agree with you. Only this particular advertisement is expensive and I do not want to wait many days for  my reward. However, £20,000 one way or the other is a small matter, so tell  that architect to do the thing in granite.”  Sir Robert Aylward sat in his own quiet room at the back of this enduring  building, a very splendid room that any Secretary of State might have envied,  but arranged in excellent taste. Its walls were panelled with figured teak, a  rich carpet made the footfall noiseless, an antique Venus stood upon a marble  pedestal in the corner, and over the mantelpiece hung a fine portrait by  Gainsborough, that of a certain Miss Aylward, a famous beauty in her day, with  whom, be it added, its present owner could boast no connection whatsoever.    Sir Robert was seated at his ebony desk playing with a pencil, and the light  from a cheerful fire fell upon his face.  In its own way it was a remarkable face, as he appeared then in his four and  fortieth year; very pale but with a natural pallor, very well cut and on the  whole impressive. His eyes were dark, matching his black hair and pointed  beard, and his nose was straight and rather prominent. Perhaps the mouth was  his weakest feature, for there was a certain shiftiness about it, also the lips  were thick and slightly sensuous. Sir Robert knew this, and therefore he grew a  moustache to veil them somewhat. To a careful observer the general impression  given by this face was such as is left by the sudden sight of a waxen mask.  “How strong! How lifelike!” he would have said, “but of  course it isn’t real. There may be a man behind, or there may be wood,  but that’s only a mask.” Many people of perception had felt like  this about Sir Robert Aylward, namely, that under the mask of his pale  countenance dwelt a different being whom they did not know or appreciate.    If these had seen him at this moment of the opening of our story, they might  have held that Wisdom was justified of her children. For now in the solitude of  his splendid office, of a sudden Sir Robert’s mask seemed to fall from  him. His face broke up like ice beneath a thaw. He rose from his table and  began to walk up and down the room. He talked to himself aloud.    “Great Heavens!” he muttered, “what a game to have played, and it will go through. I believe that it will go through.”  He stopped at the table, switched on an electric light and made a rapid calculation on the back of a letter with a blue pencil.  “Yes,” he said, “that’s my share, a million and seventeen thousand pounds in cash, and two million in ordinary shares which can  be worked off at a discount—let us say another seven hundred and fifty  thousand, plus what I have got already—put that at only two hundred and  fifty thousand net. Two millions in all, which of course may or may not be  added to, probably not, unless the ordinaries boom, for I don’t mean to  speculate any more. That’s the end of twenty years’ work, Robert  Aylward. And to think of it, eighteen months ago, although I seemed so rich, I  was on the verge of bankruptcy—the very verge, not worth five thousand  pounds. Now what did the trick? I wonder what did the trick?”    He walked down the room and stopped opposite the ancient marble, staring at  it—  “Not Venus, I think,” he said, with a laugh, “Venus never made any man rich.” He turned and retraced his steps to the other end of the room, which was veiled in shadow. Here upon a second marble pedestal stood  an object that gleamed dimly through the gloom. It was about ten inches or a  foot high, but in that place nothing more could be seen of it, except that it  was yellow and had the general appearance of a toad. For some reason it seemed  to attract Sir Robert Aylward, for he halted to stare at it, then stretched out  his hand and switched on another lamp, in the hard brilliance of which the  thing upon the pedestal suddenly declared itself, leaping out of the darkness  into light. It was a terrible object, a monstrosity of indeterminate sex and  nature, but surmounted by a woman’s head and face of extraordinary, if  devilish loveliness, sunk back between high but grotesquely small shoulders,  like to those of a lizard, so that it glared upwards. The workmanship of the  thing was rude yet strangely powerful. Whatever there is cruel, whatever there  is devilish, whatever there is inhuman in the dark places of the world, shone  out of the jewelled eyes which were set in that yellow female face, yellow  because its substance was of gold, a face which seemed not to belong to the  embryonic legs beneath, for body there was none, but to float above them. A  hollow, life-sized mask with two tiny frog-like legs, that was the fashion of  it.    “You are an ugly brute,” muttered Sir Robert, contemplating this effigy, “but although I believe in nothing in heaven above or earth below, except the abysmal folly of the British public, I am bothered if I  don’t believe in you. At any rate from the day when Vernon brought you  into my office, my luck turned, and to judge from the smile on your sweet  countenance, I don’t think it is done with yet. I wonder what those  stones are in your eyes. Opals, I suppose, from the way they change colour.  They shine uncommonly to-day, I never remember them so bright.  I——”  At this moment a knock came on the door. Sir Robert turned off the lamp and  walked back to the fireplace.  “Come in,” he said, and as he spoke once more his pale face grew impassive and expressionless.  The door opened and a clerk entered, an imposing-looking clerk with iron-grey  hair, who wore an irreproachable frock coat and patent leather boots. Advancing  to his master, he stood respectfully silent, waiting to be addressed. For quite  a long while Sir Robert looked over his head as though he did not see him; it  was a way of his. Then his eyes rested on the man dreamily and he remarked in  his cold, clear voice:    “I don’t think I rang, Jeffreys.”  “No, Sir Robert,” answered the clerk, bowing as though he spoke to Royalty, “but there is a little matter about that article in _The Cynic_.”  “Press business,” said Sir Robert, lifting his eyebrows; “you should know by this time that I do not attend to such details. See Mr. Champers-Haswell, or Major Vernon.”  “They are both out at the moment, Sir Robert.”  “Go on, then, Jeffreys,” replied the head of the firm with a resigned sigh, “only be brief. I am thinking.”  The clerk bowed again.  “The _Cynic_ people have just telephoned through about that article we sent them. I think you saw it, sir, and you may remember it begins——” and he read from a typewritten copy in his hand which was headed “Sahara, Limited”:  “‘We are now privileged to announce that this mighty scheme which will turn a desert into a rolling sea bearing the commerce of nations and cause  the waste places of the earth to teem with population and to blossom like the  rose, has been completed in its necessary if dull financial details and will  within a few days be submitted to investors among whom it has already caused so  much excitement. These details we will deal with fully in succeeding articles,  and therefore now need only pause to say that the basis of capitalization  strikes us as wonderfully advantageous to the fortunate public who are asked to  participate in its vast prospective prosperity. Our present object is to speak  of its national and imperial aspects——’”    Sir Robert lifted his eyes in remonstrance:  “How much more of that exceedingly dull and commonplace puff do you propose to read, Jeffreys?” he asked.  “No more, Sir Robert.
