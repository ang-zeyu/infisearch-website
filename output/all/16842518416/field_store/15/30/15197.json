This magnificent young man had a proud and bloodless face which contrasted sharply with his painted lips and cheeks.  In the contour of his protruding mouth showed plainly his negroid ancestry.  His scanty beard, as well as his frizzled hair, was the color of dead grass.  He was sumptuously clothed in white satin worked with silver, and around his cap was a gold chain hung with diamonds.  Now he handed his fringed riding-gloves to Guido to hold.  \"Yes, madonna, I suspect that Eglamore here cares greatly for the fact that you are Lord Balthazar's daughter, and cousin to the late Marquis of Cibo.  For Cibo has many kinsmen at court who still resent the circumstance that the matching of his wits against Eglamore's earned for Cibo a deplorably public demise.  So they conspire against Eglamore with vexatious industry, as an upstart, as a nobody thrust over people of proven descent, and Eglamore goes about in hourly apprehension of a knife-thrust.  If he could make a match with you, though, your father--thrifty man!--would be easily appeased.  Your cousins, those proud, grumbling Castel-Franchi, Strossi and Valori, would not prove over-obdurate toward a kinsman who, whatever his past indiscretions, has so many pensions and offices at his disposal.  Yes, honor would permit a truce, and Eglamore could bind them to his interests within ten days, and be rid of the necessity of sleeping in chain armor. . . . Have I not unraveled the scheme correctly, Eglamore?\"  \"Your highness was never lacking in penetration,\" replied the other in a dull voice.  He stood motionless, holding the gloves, his shoulders a little bowed as if under some physical load.  His eyes were fixed upon the ground.  He divined the change in Graciosa's face and did not care to see it.  \"And so you are Count Eglamore,\" said Graciosa in a sort of whisper. \"That is very strange.  I had thought you were my friend, Guido.  But I forget.  I must not call you Guido any longer.\"  She gave a little shiver here.  He stayed motionless and did not look at her.  \"I have often wondered what manner of man you were.  So it was you--whose hand I touched just now--you who poisoned Duke Cosmo, you who had the good cardinal assassinated, you who betrayed the brave lord of Faenza!  Oh, yes, they openly accuse you of every imaginable crime--this patient Eglamore, this reptile who has crept into his power through filthy passages.  It is very strange you should be capable of so much wickedness, for to me you seem only a sullen lackey.\"  He winced and raised his eyes at this.  His face remained expressionless.  He knew these accusations at least to be demonstrable lies, for as it happened he had never found his advancement to hinge upon the commission of the crimes named.  But even so, the past was a cemetery he did not care to have revivified.  \"And it was you who detected the Marquis of Cibo's conspiracy. Tebaldeo was my cousin, Count Eglamore, and I loved him.  We were reared together.  We used to play here in these woods, and I remember how Tebaldeo once fetched me a wren's nest from that maple yonder.  I stood just here.  I was weeping because I was afraid he would fall.  If he had fallen and been killed, it would have been the luckier for him,\" Graciosa sighed.  \"They say that he conspired.  I do not know.  I only know that by your orders, Count Eglamore, my playmate Tebaldeo was fastened upon a Saint Andrew's cross and his arms and legs were each broken in two places with an iron bar.  Then your servants took Tebaldeo, still living, and laid him upon a carriage-wheel which was hung upon a pivot.  The upper edge of this wheel was cut with very fine teeth like those of a saw, so that his agony might be complete. Tebaldeo's poor mangled legs were folded beneath his body so that his heels touched the back of his head, they tell me.  In such a posture he died very slowly while the wheel turned very slowly there in the sunlit market-place, and flies buzzed greedily about him, and the shopkeepers took holiday in order to watch Tebaldeo die--the same Tebaldeo who once fetched me a wren's nest from yonder maple.\"  Eglamore spoke now.  \"I gave orders for the Marquis of Cibo's execution.  I did not devise the manner of his death.  The punishment for Cibo's crime was long ago fixed by our laws.  Cibo plotted to kill the Duke.  Cibo confessed as much.\"  But the girl waved this aside.  \"And then you plan this masquerade. You plan to make me care for you so greatly that even when I know you to be Count Eglamore I must still care for you.  You plan to marry me, so as to placate Tebaldeo's kinsmen, so as to bind them to your interests.  It was a fine bold stroke of policy, I know, to use me as a stepping-stone to safety--but was it fair to me?\"  Her voice rose now a little.  She seemed to plead with him.  \"Look you, Count Eglamore, I was a child only yesterday.  I have never loved any man.  But you have loved many women, I know, and long experience has taught you many ways of moving a woman's heart.  Oh, was it fair, was it worth while, to match your skill against my ignorance?  Think how unhappy I would be if even now I loved you, and how I would loathe myself. . . .  But I am getting angry over nothing.  Nothing has happened except that I have dreamed in idle moments of a brave and comely lover who held his head so high that all other women envied me, and now I have awakened.\"  Meanwhile, it was with tears in his eyes that the young man in white had listened to her quiet talk, for you could nowhere have found a nature more readily sensitive than his to all the beauty and wonder which life, as if it were haphazardly, produces every day.  He pitied this betrayed child quite ineffably, because in her sorrow she was so pretty.  So he spoke consolingly.  \"Fie, Donna Graciosa, you must not be too harsh with Eglamore.  It is his nature to scheme, and he weaves his plots as inevitably as the spider does her web.  Believe me, it is wiser to forget the rascal--as I do--until there is need of him; and I think you will have no more need to consider Eglamore's trickeries, for you are very beautiful, Graciosa.\"  He had drawn closer to the girl, and he brought a cloying odor of frangipani, bergamot and vervain.  His nostrils quivered, his face had taken on an odd pinched look, for all that he smiled as over some occult jest.  Graciosa was a little frightened by his bearing, which was both furtive and predatory.  \"Oh, do not be offended, for I have some rights to say what I desire in these parts.  For, _Dei gratia_, I am the overlord of these parts, Graciosa--a neglected prince who wondered over the frequent absences of his chief counselor and secretly set spies upon him.  Eglamore here will attest as much.  Or if you cannot believe poor Eglamore any longer, I shall have other witnesses within the half-hour.  Oh, yes, they are to meet me here at noon--some twenty crop-haired stalwart cut-throats.  They will come riding upon beautiful broad-chested horses covered with red velvet trappings that are hung with little silver bells which jingle delightfully.  They will come very soon, and then we will ride back to court.\"  Duke Alessandro touched his big painted mouth with his forefinger as if in fantastic mimicry of a man imparting a confidence.  \"I think that I shall take you with me, Graciosa, for you are very beautiful.  You are as slim as a lily and more white, and your eyes are two purple mirrors in each of which I see a tiny image of Duke Alessandro.  The woman I loved yesterday was a big splendid wench with cheeks like apples.  It is not desirable that women should be so large. All women should be little creatures that fear you.  They should have thin, plaintive voices, and in shrinking from you be as slight to the touch as a cobweb.  It is not possible to love a woman ardently unless you comprehend how easy it would be to murder her.\"  \"God, God!\" said Count Eglamore, very softly, for he was familiar with the look which had now come into Duke Alessandro's face.  Indeed, all persons about court were quick to notice this odd pinched look, like that of a traveler nipped at by frosts, and people at court became obsequious within the instant in dealing with the fortunate woman who had aroused this look, Count Eglamore remembered.  And the girl did not speak at all, but stood motionless, staring in bewildered, pitiable, childlike fashion, and the color had ebbed from her countenance.  Alessandro was frankly pleased.  \"You fear me, do you not, Graciosa? See, now, when I touch your hand it is soft and cold as a serpent's skin, and you shudder.  I am very tired of women who love me, of all women with bold, hungry eyes.  To you my touch will always be a martyrdom, you will always loathe me, and therefore I shall not weary of you for a long while.  Come, Graciosa.  Your father shall have all the wealth and state that even his greedy imaginings can devise, so long as you can contrive to loathe me.  We will find you a suitable husband.  You shall have flattery and titles, gold and fine glass, soft stuffs and superb palaces such as are your beauty's due henceforward.\"  He glanced at the peddler's pack, and shrugged.  \"So Eglamore has been wooing you with jewels!  You must see mine, dear Graciosa.  It is not merely an affair of possessing, as some emperors do, all the four kinds of sapphires, the twelve kinds of emeralds, the three kinds of rubies, and many extraordinary pearls, diamonds, cymophanes, beryls, green peridots, tyanos, sandrastra, and fiery cinnamon-stones\"--he enumerated them with the tender voice of their lover--\"for the value of these may at least be estimated.  Oh, no, I have in my possession gems which have not their fellows in any other collection, gems which have not even a name and the value of which is incalculable--strange"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2880"],["title","A Blot in the 'Scutcheon (#0)"],["body","BLOT IN THE 'SCUTCHEON  By Robert Browning     Transcriber's comments on the preparation of this e-text:  Closing brackets i.e. \"]\" have been added to some of the stage directions.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE   ROBERT BROWNING stands, in respect to his origin and his career, in marked contrast to the two aristocratic poets beside whose dramas his \"Blot in the 'Scutcheon\" is here printed.  His father was a bank clerk and a dissenter at a time when dissent meant exclusion from Society; the poet went neither to one of the great public schools nor to Oxford or Cambridge; and no breath of scandal touched his name. Born in London in 1812, he was educated largely by private tutors, and spent two years at London University, but the influence of his father, a man of wide reading and cultivated tastes, was probably the most important element in his early training.  He drew well, was something of a musician, and wrote verses from an early age, though it was the accidental reading of a volume of Shelley which first kindled his real inspiration.  This indebtedness is beautifully acknowledged in his first published poem, \"Pauline\" (1833).  Apart from frequent visits to Italy, there is little of incident to chronicle in Browning's life, with the one great exception of his more than fortunate marriage in 1846 to Elizabeth Barrett, the greatest of English poetesses.  Browning's dramatic period extended from 1835 to the time of his marriage, and produced some nine plays, not all of which, however, were intended for the stage.  \"Paracelsus,\" the first of the series, has been fairly described as a \"conversational drama,\" and \"Pippa Passes,\" though it has been staged, is essentially a poem to read.  The historical tragedy of \"Strafford\" has been impressively performed, but \"King Victor and King Charles,\" \"The Return of the Druses,\" \"Colombe's Birthday,\" \"A Soul's Tragedy,\" and \"Luria,\" while interesting in many ways, can hardly be regarded as successful stage-plays.  \"A Blot in the 'Scutcheon\" was performed at Drury Lane, but its chances of a successful run were spoiled by the jealousy of Macready, the manager.  The main cause of Browning's weakness as a playwright lay in the fact that he was so much more interested in psychology than in action. But in the present tragedy this defect is less prominent than usual, and in spite of flaws in construction, it reaches a high pitch of emotional intensity, the characters are drawn with vividness, and the lines are rich in poetry.

GERARD, and other retainers of Lord Tresham.       Time, 17--     ACT I            SCENE I.--The Interior of a Lodge in Lord Tresham's Park.           Many Retainers crowded at the window, supposed to command           a view of the entrance to his Mansion.            GERARD, the Warrener, his back to a table on which are flagons,           etc.       FIRST RETAINER.  Ay, do! push, friends, and then you'll push down me!      --What for?  Does any hear a runner's foot      Or a steed's trample or a coach-wheel's cry?      Is the Earl come or his least poursuivant?      But there's no breeding in a man of you      Save Gerard yonder:  here's a half-place yet,      Old Gerard!       GERARD.  Save your courtesies, my friend.  Here is my place.       SECOND RETAINER.  Now, Gerard, out with it!      What makes you sullen, this of all the days      I' the year?  To-day that young rich bountiful      Handsome Earl Mertoun, whom alone they match      With our Lord Tresham through the country-side,      Is coming here in utmost bravery      To ask our master's sister's hand?       GERARD.                             What then?       SECOND RETAINER.  What then?  Why, you, she speaks to, if she meets      Your worship, smiles on as you hold apart      The boughs to let her through her forest walks,      You, always favourite for your no-deserts,      You've heard, these three days, how Earl Mertoun sues      To lay his heart and house and broad lands too      At Lady Mildred's feet:  and while we squeeze      Ourselves into a mousehole lest we miss      One congee of the least page in his train,      You sit o' one side--\"there's the Earl,\" say I--      \"What then?\" say you!       THIRD RETAINER.        I'll wager he has let      Both swans he tamed for Lady Mildred swim      Over the falls and gain the river!       GERARD.                             Ralph,      Is not to-morrow my inspecting-day      For you and for your hawks?       FOURTH RETAINER.             Let Gerard be!      He's coarse-grained, like his carved black cross-bow stock.      Ha, look now, while we squabble with him, look!      Well done, now--is not this beginning, now,      To purpose?       FIRST RETAINER.  Our retainers look as fine--      That's comfort.  Lord, how Richard holds himself      With his white staff!  Will not a knave behind      Prick him upright?       FOURTH RETAINER.  He's only bowing, fool!      The Earl's man bent us lower by this much.       FIRST RETAINER.  That's comfort.  Here's a very cavalcade!       THIRD RETAINER.  I don't see wherefore Richard, and his troop      Of silk and silver varlets there, should find      Their perfumed selves so indispensable      On high days, holidays!  Would it so disgrace      Our family, if I, for instance, stood--      In my right hand a cast of Swedish hawks,      A leash of greyhounds in my left?--       GERARD.                              --With Hugh      The logman for supporter, in his right      The bill-hook, in his left the brushwood-shears!       THIRD RETAINER.  Out on you, crab!  What next, what next?  The Earl!       FIRST RETAINER.  Oh Walter, groom, our horses, do they match      The Earl's?  Alas, that first pair of the six--      They paw the ground--Ah Walter! and that brute      Just on his haunches by the wheel!       SIXTH RETAINER.                     Ay--ay!      You, Philip, are a special hand, I hear,      At soups and sauces:  what's a horse to you?      D'ye mark that beast they've slid into the midst      So cunningly?--then, Philip, mark this further;      No leg has he to stand on!       FIRST RETAINER.             No? that's comfort.       SECOND RETAINER.  Peace, Cook!  The Earl descends.  Well, Gerard, see      The Earl at least!  Come, there's a proper man,      I hope!  Why, Ralph, no falcon, Pole or Swede,      Has got a starrier eye.       THIRD RETAINER.          His eyes are blue:      But leave my hawks alone!       FOURTH RETAINER.           So young, and yet      So tall and shapely!       FIFTH RETAINER.  Here's Lord Tresham's self!      There now--there's what a nobleman should be!      He's older, graver, loftier, he's more like      A House's head.       SECOND RETAINER.  But you'd not have a boy      --And what's the Earl beside?--possess too soon      That stateliness?       FIRST RETAINER.  Our master takes his hand--      Richard and his white staff are on the move--      Back fall our people--(tsh!--there's Timothy      Sure to get tangled in his ribbon-ties,      And Peter's cursed rosette's a-coming off!)      --At last I see our lord's back and his friend's;      And the whole beautiful bright company      Close round them--in they go!           [Jumping down from the window-bench, and making for            the table and its jugs.]                                     Good health, long life,      Great joy to our Lord Tresham and his House!       SIXTH RETAINER.  My father drove his father first to court,      After his marriage-day--ay, did he!       SECOND RETAINER.                     God bless      Lord Tresham, Lady Mildred, and the Earl!      Here, Gerard, reach your beaker!       GERARD.                           Drink, my boys!      Don't mind me--all's not right about me--drink!       SECOND RETAINER [aside].      He's vexed, now, that he let the show escape!           [To GERARD.]      Remember that the Earl returns this way.       GERARD.  That way?       SECOND RETAINER.    Just so.       GERARD.                       Then my way's here.           [Goes.]       SECOND RETAINER.                                   Old Gerard      Will die soon--mind, I said it!  He was used      To care about the pitifullest thing      That touched the House's honour, not an eye      But his could see wherein:  and on a cause      Of scarce a quarter this importance, Gerard      Fairly had fretted flesh and bone away      In cares that this was right, nor that was wrong,      Such point decorous, and such square by rule--      He knew such niceties, no herald more:      And now--you see his humour:  die he will!       SECOND RETAINER.  God help him!  Who's for the great servants' hall      To hear what's going on inside!  They'd follow      Lord Tresham into the saloon.       THIRD RETAINER.                I!--       FOURTH RETAINER.                     I!--      Leave Frank alone for catching, at the door,      Some hint of how the parley goes inside!      Prosperity to the great House once more!      Here's the last drop!       FIRST RETAINER.        Have at you!  Boys, hurrah!             SCENE II.--A Saloon in the Mansion            Enter LORD TRESHAM, LORD MERTOUN, AUSTIN, and GUENDOLEN       TRESHAM.  I welcome you, Lord Mertoun, yet once more,      To this ancestral roof of mine.  Your name      --Noble among the noblest in itself,      Yet taking in your person, fame avers,      New price and lustre,--(as that gem you wear,      Transmitted from a hundred knightly breasts,      Fresh chased and set and fixed by its last lord,      Seems to re-kindle at the core)--your name      Would win you welcome!--       MERTOUN.
