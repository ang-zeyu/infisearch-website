The actual resemblance between the two Deluge narratives has caused a resemblance to be imagined between the two Creation narratives. It has been well brought out in some of the later comments of Assyriologists that, so far from there being any resemblance in the Babylonian legend to the narrative in Genesis, the two accounts differ _in toto_. Mr. T. G. Pinches, for example, points out that in the Babylonian account there is--       \"No direct statement of the creation of the heavens and the      earth;       \"No systematic division of the things created into groups and      classes, such as is found in Genesis;       \"No reference to the Days of Creation;       \"No appearance of the Deity as the first and only cause of the      existence of things.\"[30:1]  Indeed, in the Babylonian account, \"the heavens and the earth are represented as existing, though in a chaotic form, from the first.\"  Yet on this purely imaginary resemblance between the Biblical and Babylonian Creation narratives the legend has been founded \"that the introductory chapters of the Book of Genesis present to us the Hebrew version of a mythology common to many of the Semitic peoples.\" And the legend has been yet further developed, until writers of the standing of Prof. Friedrich Delitzsch have claimed that the Genesis narrative was _borrowed_ from the Babylonian, though \"the priestly scholar who composed Genesis, chapter i. endeavoured of course to remove all possible mythological features of this Creation story.\"[31:1]  If the Hebrew priest did borrow from the Babylonian myth, what was it that he borrowed? Not the existence of sea and land, of sun and moon, of plants and animals, of birds and beasts and fishes. For surely the Hebrew may be credited with knowing this much of himself, without any need for a transportation to Babylon to learn it. \"In writing an account of the Creation, statements as to what are the things created must of necessity be inserted,\"[31:2] whenever, wherever, and by whomsoever that account is written.  What else, then, is there common to the two accounts? _Tiamat_ is the name given to the Babylonian mother of the universe, the dragon of the deep; and in Genesis it is written that \"darkness was upon the face of the _deep_ (_tehōm_).\"  Here, and here only, is a point of possible connection; but if it be evidence of a connection, what kind of a connection does it imply? It implies that the Babylonian based his barbarous myth upon the Hebrew narrative. There is no other possible way of interpreting the connection,--if connection there be.  The Hebrew word would seem to mean, etymologically, \"_surges_,\" \"_storm-tossed waters_,\"--\"Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of Thy waterspouts.\" Our word \"_deep_\" is apt to give us the idea of stillness--we have the proverb, \"Still waters run deep,\"--whereas in some instances _tehōm_ is used in Scripture of waters which were certainly shallow, as, for instance, those passed through by Israel at the Red Sea:--       \"Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath He cast into the sea:      his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red Sea. The      _depths_ have covered them.\"  In other passages the words used in our Authorized Version, \"_deep_\" or \"_depths_,\" give the correct signification.  But deep waters, or waters in commotion, are in either case natural objects. We get the word _tehōm_ used continually in Scripture in a perfectly matter-of-fact way, where there is no possibility of personification or myth being intended. Tiamat, on the contrary, the Babylonian dragon of the waters, is a mythological personification. Now the natural object must come first. It never yet has been the case that a nation has gained its knowledge of a perfectly common natural object by de-mythologizing one of the mythological personifications of another nation. The Israelites did not learn about _tehōm_, the surging water of the Red Sea, that rolled over the Egyptians in their sight, from any Babylonian fable of a dragon of the waters, read by their descendants hundreds of years later.  Yet further, the Babylonian account of Creation is comparatively late; the Hebrew account, as certainly, comparatively early. It is not merely that the actual cuneiform tablets are of date about 700 B.C., coming as they do from the Kouyunjik mound, the ruins of the palace of Sennacherib and Assurbanipal, built about that date. The poem itself, as Prof. Sayce has pointed out, indicates, by the peculiar pre-eminence given in it to Merodach, that it is of late composition. It was late in the history of Babylon that Merodach was adopted as the supreme deity. The astronomical references in the poem are more conclusive still, for, as will be shown later on, they point to a development of astronomy that cannot be dated earlier than 700 B.C.  On the other hand, the first chapter of Genesis was composed very early. The references to the heavenly bodies in verse 16 bear the marks of the most primitive condition possible of astronomy. The heavenly bodies are simply the greater light, the lesser light, and the stars--the last being introduced quite parenthetically. It is the simplest reference to the heavenly bodies that is made in Scripture, or that, indeed, could be made.  There may well have been Babylonians who held higher conceptions of God and nature than those given in the Tiamat myth. It is certain that very many Hebrews fell short of the teaching conveyed in the first chapter of Genesis. But the fact remains that the one nation preserved the Tiamat myth, the other the narrative of Genesis, and each counted its own Creation story sacred. We can only rightly judge the two nations by what they valued. Thus judged, the Hebrew nation stands as high above the Babylonian in intelligence, as well as in faith, as the first chapter of Genesis is above the Tiamat myth.

CHAPTER IV  THE FIRMAMENT   The sixth verse of the first chapter of Genesis presents a difficulty as to the precise meaning of the principal word, viz. that translated _firmament_.       \"And God said, Let there be a _rāqiā‘_ in the midst of the      waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. And God      made the _rāqiā‘_, and divided the waters which were under the      _rāqiā‘_ from the waters which were above the _rāqiā‘_: and it      was so. And God called the _rāqiā‘_ _Shamayim_. And the      evening and the morning were the second day.\"  It is, of course, perfectly clear that by the word _rāqiā‘_ in the preceding passage it is the atmosphere that is alluded to. But later on in the chapter the word is used in a slightly different connection. \"God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven.\"  As we look upward from the earth, we look through a twofold medium. Near the earth we have our atmosphere; above that there is inter-stellar space, void of anything, so far as we know, except the Ether. We are not able to detect any line of demarcation where our atmosphere ends, and the outer void begins. Both therefore are equally spoken of as \"the firmament\"; and yet there is a difference between the two. The lower supports the clouds; in the upper are set the two great lights and the stars. The upper, therefore, is emphatically _reqiā‘ hasshamayim_, \"the firmament of heaven,\" of the \"uplifted.\" It is \"in the face of\"--that is, \"before,\" or \"under the eyes of,\" \"beneath,\"--this higher expanse that the fowls of the air fly to and fro.  The firmament, then, is that which Tennyson sings of as \"the central blue,\" the seeming vault of the sky, which we can consider as at any height above us that we please. The clouds are above it in one sense; yet in another, sun, moon and stars, which are clearly far higher than the clouds, are set in it.  There is no question therefore as to what is referred to by the word \"firmament\"; but there is a question as to the etymological meaning of the word, and associated with that, a question as to how the Hebrews themselves conceived of the celestial vault.  The word _rāqiā‘_, translated \"firmament,\" properly signifies \"an expanse,\" or \"extension,\" something stretched or beaten out. The verb from which this noun is derived is often used in Scripture, both as referring to the heavens and in other connections. Thus in Job xxxvii. 18, the question is asked, \"Canst thou with Him _spread out_ the sky, which is strong as a molten mirror?\" Eleazar, the priest, after the rebellion of Korah, Dathan and Abiram took the brazen censers of the rebels, and they were \"_made broad_ plates for a covering of the altar.\" The goldsmith described by Isaiah as making an idol, \"_spreadeth it over_ with gold\"; whilst Jeremiah says, \"silver _spread_ into plates is brought from Tarshish.\" Again, in Psalm cxxxvi., in the account of creation we have the same word used with reference to the earth, \"To him that _stretched out_ the earth above the waters.\" In this and in many other passages the idea of extension is clearly that which the word is intended to convey. But the Seventy, in making the Greek Version of the Old Testament, were naturally influenced by the views of astronomical science then held in Alexandria, the centre"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28536"],["title","The Astronomy of the Bible (#7)"],["body"," Greek astronomy. Here, and at this time, the doctrine of the crystalline spheres--a misunderstanding of the mathematical researches of Eudoxus and others--held currency. These spheres were supposed to be a succession of perfectly transparent and invisible solid shells, in which the sun, moon, and planets were severally placed. The Seventy no doubt considered that in rendering _rāqiā‘_, by _stereōma_, i. e. firmament, thus conveying the idea of a solid structure, they were speaking the last word of up-to-date science.  There should be no reluctance in ascribing to the Hebrews an erroneous scientific conception if there is any evidence that they held it. We cannot too clearly realize that the writers of the Scriptures were not supernaturally inspired to give correct technical scientific descriptions; and supposing they had been so inspired, we must bear in mind that we should often consider those descriptions wrong just in proportion to their correctness, for the very sufficient reason that not even our own science of to-day has yet reached finality in all things.  There should be no reluctance in ascribing to the Hebrews an erroneous scientific conception if there is any evidence that they held it. In this case, there is no such evidence; indeed, there is strong evidence to the contrary.  The Hebrew word _rāqiā‘_, as already shown, really signifies \"extension,\" just as the word for heaven, _shamayim_ means the \"uplifted.\" In these two words, therefore, significant respectively of a surface and of height, there is a recognition of the \"three dimensions,\"--in other words, of Space.  When we wish to refer to super-terrestrial space, we have two expressions in modern English by which to describe it: we can speak of \"the vault of heaven,\" or of \"the canopy of heaven.\" \"The vault of heaven\" is most used, it has indeed been recently adopted as the title of a scientific work by a well-known astronomer. But the word _vault_ certainly gives the suggestion of a solid structure; whilst the word _canopy_ calls up the idea of a slighter covering, probably of some textile fabric.  The reasons for thinking that the Hebrews did not consider the \"firmament\" a solid structure are, first, that the word does not necessarily convey that meaning; next, that the attitude of the Hebrew mind towards nature was not such as to require this idea. The question, \"What holds up the waters above the firmament?\" would not have troubled them. It would have been sufficient for them, as for the writer to the Hebrews, to consider that God was \"upholding all things by the word of His power,\" and they would not have troubled about the machinery. But besides this, there are many passages in Scripture, some occurring in the earliest books, which expressly speak of the clouds as carrying the water; so that the expressions placing waters \"above the firmament,\" or \"above the heavens,\" can mean no more than \"in the clouds.\" Indeed, as we shall see, quite a clear account is given of the atmospheric circulation, such as could hardly be mended by a modern poet.  It is true that David sang that \"the _foundations_ of heaven moved and shook, because He was wroth,\" and Job says that \"the _pillars_ of heaven tremble and are astonished at His reproof.\" But not only are the references to foundations and pillars evidently intended merely as poetic imagery, but they are also used much more frequently of the earth, and yet at the same time Job expressly points out that God \"stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.\" The Hebrew formed no ideas like those of the Hindus, who thought the earth supported by elephants, the elephants by a tortoise, the tortoise by a snake.  In Scripture, in most cases the word \"earth\" (_eretz_) does not mean the solid mass of this our planet, but only its surface; the \"dry land\" as opposed to the \"seas\"; the countries, the dwelling place of man and beast. The \"pillars\" or \"foundations\" of the earth in this sense are the great systems of the rocks, and these were conceived of as directly supported by the power of God, without any need of intermediary structures. The Hebrew clearly recognized that it is the will of God alone that keeps the whole secure.  Thus Hannah sang--       \"The pillars of the earth are the Lord's,         And He hath set the world upon them.\"  And Asaph represents the Lord as saying:--       \"The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved:         I bear up the pillars of it.\"  Yet again, just as we speak of \"the celestial canopy,\" so Psalm civ. describes the Lord as He \"who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain,\" and Isaiah gives the image in a fuller form,--\"that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in.\" The same expression of \"stretching out the heavens\" is repeatedly used in Isaiah; it is indeed one of his typical phrases. Here, beyond question, extension, spreading out, is the idea sought to be conveyed, not that of solidity.  The prophet Amos uses yet another parallel. \"It is He that buildeth His stories in the heaven.\" While Isaiah speaks of the entire stellar universe as the tent or pavilion of Jehovah, Amos likens the height of the heavens as the steps up to His throne; the \"stories\" are the \"ascent,\" as Moses speaks of the \"ascent of Akrabbim,\" and David makes \"the ascent\" of the Mount of Olives. The Hebrews cannot have regarded the heavens as, literally, both staircase and reservoir.  The firmament, _i. e._ the atmosphere, is spoken of as dividing between the waters that are under the firmament, _i. e._ oceans, seas, rivers, etc., from the waters that are above the firmament, _i. e._ the masses of water vapour carried by the atmosphere, seen in the clouds, and condensing from them as rain. We get the very same expression as this of the \"waters which were above\" in the Psalm of Praise:--       \"Praise Him, ye heavens of heavens,      And ye waters that be above the heavens;\"  and again in the Song of the Three Children:--       \"O all ye waters that be above the heaven, bless ye the Lord.\"  In the later books of the Bible the subject of the circulation of water through the atmosphere is referred to much more fully. Twice over the prophet Amos describes Jehovah as \"He that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth.\" This is not merely a reference to the tides, for the Preacher in the book of Ecclesiastes expressly points out that \"all the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again\"; and Isaiah seems to employ something of the same thought:       \"For as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven, and      returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it      bring forth and bud, and giveth seed to the sower and bread to      the eater.\"  Schiaparelli indeed argues that this very passage from Isaiah \"expressly excludes any idea of an atmospheric circulation of waters\"[41:1] on the ground that the water so falling is thought to be transmuted into seeds and fruits. But surely the image is as true as it is beautiful! The rain is absorbed by vegetation, and is transmuted into seeds and fruit, and it would go hard to say that the same particles of rain are again evaporated and taken up afresh into the clouds. Besides, if we complete the quotation we find that what is stated is that the rain does not return _until_ it has accomplished its purpose:--       \"So shall My word be that goeth forth out of My mouth: it      shall not return unto Me void, but it shall accomplish that      which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I      sent it.\"  Elihu describes the process of evaporation precisely:--       \"Behold, God is great, and we know Him not;       The number of His years is unsearchable.       For He draweth up the drops of water,       Which distil in rain from His vapour:       Which the skies pour down       And drop upon man abundantly.\"  Throughout the books of Holy Scripture, the connection between the clouds and the rain is clearly borne in mind. Deborah says in her song \"the clouds dropped water.\" In the Psalms there are many references. In lxxvii. 17, \"The clouds poured out water;\" in cxlvii. 8, \"Who covereth the heaven with clouds, Who prepareth rain for the earth.\" Proverbs xvi. 15, \"His favour is as a cloud of the latter rain.\" The Preacher says that \"clouds return after the rain\"; and Isaiah, \"I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it\"; and Jude, \"Clouds they are without water, carried about of winds.\"  The clouds, too, were not conceived as being heavy. Nahum says that \"the clouds are the dust of His feet,\" and Isaiah speaks of \"a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.\" The Preacher clearly understood that \"the waters above\" were not pent in by solid barriers; that they were carried by the clouds; for \"if the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth.\" And Job says of Jehovah, \"He bindeth up the waters in His thick clouds, and the cloud is not rent under them;\" and, later, Jehovah Himself asks:--       \"Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds,       That abundance of waters may cover thee?              *       *       *       *       *        Who can number the clouds by wisdom,       Or who can pour out the bottles of heaven?\"  The Hebrews, therefore, were quite aware that the waters of the sea were drawn up into the atmosphere by evaporation, and were carried by it in the form of clouds. No doubt their knowledge in this respect, as in others, was the growth of time. But there is no need to suppose that, even in the earlier stages of their development, the Hebrews thought of the \"waters that be above the heavens\" as contained in a literal cistern overhead. Still less is there reason to adopt Prof. Schiaparelli's strange deduction: \"Considering the spherical and convex shape of the firmament, the upper waters could"]]]
