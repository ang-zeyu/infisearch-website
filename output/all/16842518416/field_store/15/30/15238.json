[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2888"],["title","Yorkshire Dialect Poems (1673-1915) and traditional poems (#3)"],["body"," any wide circulation among the Yorkshire peasantry, but there is abundant evidence that such was the case with these five poems of Thomas Browne.  Early in the nineteenth century enterprising booksellers at York, Northallerton, Bedale, Otley, and ,Knaresborough were turning out little chap-books, generally bearing the title, Specimens of the Yorkshire Dialect, and consisting largely of the dialect poems of Browne.  These circulated widely in the country districts of Yorkshire, and to this day one meets with peasants who take a delight in reciting Browne's songs and eclogues.  Down to the close of the eighteenth century the authors of Yorkshire dialect poetry had been men of education, and even writers by profession. With the coming, of the nineteenth century the composition of such poetry extends to men in a humbler social position.  The working-man poet appears on the scene and makes his presence felt in many ways.  Early in the century, David Lewis, a Knaresborough gardener, published, in one of the chap-books to which reference has just been made, two dialect poems, \"The Sweeper and Thieves\" and \"An Elegy on the Death of a Frog\"; they were afterwards republished, together with some non-dialect verses, in a volume entitled The Landscape and Other Poems (York, 1815) by the same author.  A dialogue poem by Lewis, entitled The Pocket Books,\" appears in later chap-books.  It cannot be claimed for him that his poetic power is of a high standard, but as the first Yorkshire peasant poet to write dialect verse he calls for notice here.  His \"Elegy on the Death of a Frog\" is perhaps chiefly interesting as showing the influence of Burns upon Yorkshire poets at the beginning of the nineteenth century.  In idea, and in the choice of verse, it is directly modelled on the famous \"To a Mouse.\"  The reader will doubtless have noticed that in this historic review of Yorkshire dialect poetry it has always been the life of rural Yorkshire which is depicted, and that the great bulk of the poetry has belonged to the North Riding.  What we have now to trace is the extension of this revival of vernacular poetry to the densely populated West Riding, where a dialect differing radically from that of the, north and east is spoken, and where, an astonishing variety of industries has created an equally varied outlook upon life and habit of thought.  Was the Sheffield cutler, the Barnsley miner, the Bradford handloom-weaver, and the Leeds forge-man to find no outlet in dialect verse for his thoughts and emotions, his hopes and his fears? Or, if dialect poetry must be concerned only with rustic life, was the Craven dalesman to have no voice in the matter? Questions such as these may well have passed through the minds of West Riding men as they saw the steady growth of North Riding poetry in the first forty years of the nineteenth century, and passed from hand to hand the well-thumbed chap-books wherein were included poems like \"Awd Daisy,\" \"The Sweeper and Thieves,\" and the dialect-songs.  The desire to have a share in the movement became more and more urgent, and when the West Riding joined in, it was inevitable that it should widen the scope of dialect poetry both in spirit and in form.  A West Riding dialect literature seems to have arisen first of all in Barnsley and Sheffield in the fourth decade of the nineteenth century. Between 1830 and 1834 a number of prose \"conversations\" entitled, The Sheffield Dialect.' Be a Shevvild Chap, passed through the press.  The author of these also published in 1832 The Wheelswarf Chronicle, and in 1836 appeared the first number of The Shevvild Chap's Annual in which the writer throws aside his nom-de-plume and signs himself Abel Bywater. This annual, which lived for about twenty years, is the first of the many \"Annuals\" or \"Almanacs\" which are the most characteristic product of the West Riding dialect movement.  Their history is a subject to itself, and inasmuch as the contributions to them are largely in prose, they can only be referred to very lightly here.  Their popularity and ever-increasing circulation is a sure proof of their wide appeal, and there can be no doubt that they have done an immense service in endearing the local idiom in which they are written to those who speak it, and also in interpreting the life and thought of the, great industrial communities for whom they are written.  The literary quality of these almanacs varies greatly, but among their pages will be found many poems, and many prose tales and sketches, which vividly portray the West Riding artisan.  Abundant justice is done to his sense of humour, which, if broad and at times even crude, is always good-natured and healthy, as well as to his intense love of the sentimental, which to the stranger lurks hidden beneath a mask of indifference.  Incidentally, these almanacs also present a faithful picture of the social history of the West Riding during the greater part of a century.  As we study their pages, we realise what impression events such as the introduction of the railroad, the Chartist Movement, the Repeal of the Corn Laws, mid-Victorian factory legislation, Trade- Unionism, the Co-operative movement and Temperance reform made upon the minds of nineteenth-century Yorkshiremen; in other words, these almanacs furnish us with just such a mirror of nineteenth-century industrial Yorkshire as the bound volumes of Punch furnish of the nation as a whole.  Among the most famous of these annual productions is The Bairnsla Foak's Annual, an Pogmoor Olmenack, started by Charles Rogers (Tom, Treddlehoyle) in 1838, and The Halifax Original Illuminated Clock Almanac begun by John Hartley in 1867.  The number of these almanacs is very large; most of them are published and circulated chiefly in the industrial districts of the Riding, but not the least interesting among them is The Nidderdill Olminac, edited by \"Nattie Nidds\" at Pateley Bridge; it began in 1864 and ran until 1880.  Wherever published, all of these almanacs conform more or less to the same pattern, as it was first laid down by the founder of the dialect almanac, Abel Bywater of Sheffield, in the year 1836.  Widely popular in the West Riding, the almanac has never obtained foothold in the other Ridings, and is little known outside of the county.  The \"Bibliographical List\" of dialect literature, published by the English Dialect Society' in 1877, mentions only two annuals or almanacs, in addition to those published in the West Riding, and both of these belong to Tyneside.  Abel Bywater finds a place in our anthology by virtue of his \"Sheffield Cutler's Song.\" In its rollicking swing and boisterous humour it serves admirably to illustrate the new note which is heard when we pass from rural Yorkshire to the noisy manufacturing cities.  We exchange the farm, or the country fair, for the gallery of the city music-hall, where the cutler sits armed with stones, red herrings, \"flat-backs,\" and other missiles ready to be hurled at the performers \"if they don't play' Nancy's Fancy' or onay tune we fix.\"  We are not concerned here with the linguistic side of Yorkshire dialect literature, but the reader will notice how different is the phonology, and to a less extent the vocabulary and idiom, of this song from that of the North Riding specimens.  Returning once more to the North Riding, we must first of all draw attention to the poet, John Castillo.  In the country round Whitby and Pickering, and throughout the Hambledon Hills, his name is very familiar. Born near Dublin, in 1792, of Roman Catholic parents, he was brought up at Lealholm Bridge, in the Cleveland country, and learnt the trade of a journeyman stone-mason.  Having abjured the faith of his childhood, he joined, in 1818, the Wesleyan Methodist Society and acquired great popularity in the North Riding as a local preacher.  His well-known poem, \"Awd Isaac,\" seems to have been first printed at Northallerton in 1831. Twelve years later it occupies the first place in a volume of poems published by the author at Whitby under the title, Awd Isaac, The Steeplechase, and Other Poems.  Like most of his other poems, \"Awd Isaac\" is strongly didactic and religious; its homely piety and directness of speach have won for it a warm welcome among the North Yorkshire peasantry, and many a farmer and farm-labourer still living knows much of the poem by heart.  As \"Awd Isaac \" is too long for an anthology, I have chosen \"The Lucky Dream\" as an illustration of Castillo's workmanship. Apart from its narrative interest, this poem calls for attention as a Yorkshire variant of an ancient and widely dispersed folk-tale, the earliest known version of which is to be found in the works of the thirteenth-century Persian poet Jalalu'd-Din.  Castillo died at Pickering in 1845, and five years later a complete edition of his poems was published at Kirkby Moorside.  Less popular than \"Awd Isaac,\" but often met with in collections of dialect verse, is the poem entitled \"The York Minster Screen.\"  This was the work of George Newton Brown, a lawyer by profession, who lived at Nunnington in Ryedale.  The poem, which is in the form of a dialogue between two Yorkshire farmers, was first published at Malton in 1833. The conversation, which is of the raciest description, is supposed to take place in York Minster and turns on the repairs which were made in 1832 to the famous organ-screen which separates the nave and transepts from the chancel.  The question of altering the position of the screen is debated with much humour and vivacity.  Before leaving the North Riding, reference must be made to Elizabeth Tweddell, the gifted poetess of the Cleveland Hills.  Born at Stokesley in 1833, the daughter of Thomas Cole, the parish-clerk of that town, she married George Markham Tweddell, the author of The People's History of Cleveland, and in 1875 she published a slender volume of dialect verse and prose entitled Rhymes and Sketches to Illustrate the Cleveland Dialect."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2888"],["title","Yorkshire Dialect Poems (1673-1915) and traditional poems (#4)"],["body","her modest preface Mrs.  Tweddell declares that the only merit of her work lies in \"the stringing together of a good many Cleveland words and expressions that are fast becoming obsolete\"; but the volume has far deeper claims on our gratitude than this.  There is much homely charm in her rhymes and sketches, and the two extracts which find a place in this collection are models of what simple dialect-poems should be.  Above all, Mrs. Tweddell has the gift of humour; this is well illustrated by the song, \"Dean't mak gam o' me,\" and also by her well-known prose story, \"Awd Gab o' Steers.\" Her most sustained effort in verse is the poem entitled \" T' Awd Cleveland Customs,\" in which she gives us a delightful picture of the festive seasons of the Cleveland year from \" Newery Day,\" with its \"lucky bod,\" to \"Kessamus,\" with its \"sooard dancers.\"  The western portion of the North Riding, including Swale and Wensleydale, has been less fruitful in dialect poetry than the eastern.  Apart from the anonymous \"Wensleydale Lad\" already noticed, it is represented in this anthology only by the spirited poem, \"Reeth Bartle Fair,\" the work of a true lover of dialect speech, Captain John Harland, who published for the English Dialect Society a valuable glossary of Swaledale words (1873).  The Craven country, the dialect of which differs materially from that spoken in the manufacturing districts of the West, Riding, is not without its bards.  These include James Henry Dixon (1803-1876),--a local historian and antiquary of scholarly tastes, who edited for the Percy Society the delightful collection of folk-poetry entitled, Ancient Poems, Ballads, and Songs of the Peasantry of England (1846).  Mr. Dixon wrote comparatively little poetry himself, but his song, \"The Milkin'-time,\" has the lilt of the best Scottish folk-songs and well deserves its inclusion here.  In a longer poem, \"Slaadburn Faar\" (1871), he gives a humorous and racy description of the adventures of a farmer and his wife on their journey from Grassington to Slaidburn to attend the local fair.  In general idea it resembles Harland's \"Reeth Bartle Fair,\" which appeared in the preceding year.  But the typical poet of the Craven country was Tom Twistleton, a farmer near Settle, whose Poems in the Craven, Dialect first appeared in 1869, and soon ran through several editions.  He was a disciple of Burns, and his poem \"The Christmas-Party\" (see below) daringly challenges comparison with the immortal \"Halloween.\" His description of the dancing in the farm-house kitchen, and of the adventures of the pair of lovers who escape from the merry throng, is singularly vivid, and illustrates the author's ready humour and keen observation of rustic life and character.  Reference has already been made to the Nidderdill Olminac which ,vas produced by \"Nattie Nidds\" between 1864 and 1880 and published at Pateley Bridge.  Among the contributors to it was Thomas Blackah, a working miner of Greenhow Hill, who in 1867 published a volume of dialect verse entitled Songs and Poems in the Nidderdale Dialect.  In their truth to life, homely charm and freedom from pretentiousness, these dialect poems resemble those of Mrs. Tweddell, and deserve a wider recognition than they have so far won.  After this excursion into the dales of the North and West Riding, where, apart from mining, the life of the people is largely spent on the farm, we must turn once again to the industrial Yorkshire of the south-west, and see to what extent dialect poetry has flourished in the smoke-laden air of chimney-stacks and blast-furnaces, and with what success the Yorkshire dialect poets of the towns and cities have interpreted the life and thoughts of those who work in the mill or at the forge.  As we have already seen, the first attempts to interpret in dialect poetry the life of industrial Yorkshire were made at Sheffield early in the nineteenth century by Abel Bywater.  As the century advanced, the movement spread northwards, and the great artisan communities of Bradford, Leeds, and Halifax produced their poets.  Among these pre-eminence belongs to Ben Preston, the Bradford poet, who stepped swiftly into local fame by the publication of his well-known poem, \"Natterin' Nan,\" which first appeared in a Bradford journal in 1856.  This is a vigorous piece of dramatic realism, setting forth the character of a Yorkshire scold and grumbler with infinite zest and humour.  But it is in pathos that the genius of Preston chiefly consists.  In poems like \"Owd Moxy,\" \"T' Lancashire Famine,\" and \"I niver can call her my wife,\" he gives us pictures of the struggle that went on in the cottage-homes of the West Riding during the \"hungry forties.\" In \"Owd Moxy\" his subject is the old waller who has to face the pitiless winter wind and rain as he plies his dreary task on the moors; but in most of his poems it is the life of the handloom-weaver that he interprets.  The kindliness of his nature is everywhere apparent and gives a sincerity to the poems in which he portrays with rare discernment and sympathy the sufferings of the artisan, toiling from morning to night on eight shillings a week.  His pathos has dignity and restraint, and in the poem \"I niver can call her my wife\" it rises to the heights of great tragedy.  This is Ben Preston's masterpiece, and, though scarcely known outside of the county, it deserves to take a place side by side with Hood's \" Song of the Shirt\" by reason of the poignancy with which it interprets the tragedy of penury.(5)  The example set by Ben Preston has been followed by other dialect poets living in the district round Bradford.  Mention may be made of James Burnley, whose poem, \"Jim's Letter,\" is a telling illustration of the fine use which can be made of dialect in the service of the dramatic lyric; and of Abraham Holroyd, who not only wrote original verse, but also made a valuable collection of old Yorkshire songs and ballads.(6)  The rivalry between Bradford and Leeds is proverbial, and, though the latter city has lagged behing Bradford in the production of dialect literature, the Yorkshire Songs of J. H. Eccles, published in 1862, is a notable contribution to the movement whose history is here being recorded.  In John Hartley, Halifax possessed the most versatile dialect-writer that Yorkshire has so far produced.  For fifty years this writer, who died in 1915, poured forth lyric song and prose tale in unstinted measure.  Most of his dialect work found a place in the Original Illuminated Clock Almanac, which he edited from 1867 until his death; but from time to time he gathered the best of his work into book form, and his Yorkshire Lyrics, published in 1898, occupy a place of honour in many a Yorkshire home.  The examples from his works here given will serve to illustrate his fine ear for metrical harmony, his imaginative power, and his sympathetic interpretation of Yorkshire character.  Of the younger generation of Yorkshire poets, most of them still alive, I must speak more briefly.  But it must not be overlooked that, so far from there being any falling off in the volume or quality of dialect-verse, it is safe to say that it has never been in so flourishing a condition as at the present day.  Dialect poems are now being written in all parts of the county.  Editors of weekly papers welcome them gladly in their columns; the Yorkshire Dialect Society has recently opened the pages of its annual Transactions to original contributions in verse and prose, and every year the printing presses of London and Yorkshire publish volumes of dialect verse.  Of individual writers, whose work finds illustration in this anthology, mention may be made of the Rev. W. H. Oxley, whose T' Fisher Folk o' Riley Brig (1888) marks, I believe, the first attempt to interpret in verse the hazardous life of the east-coast fisherman.  Farther north, Mr. G. H. Cowling has given us in his A Yorkshire Tyke (1914) a number of spirited and winsome studies of the life and thought of the Hackness peasant.  The wold country of the East Riding has found its interpreter in Mr. J. A. Carill, whose Woz'ls (1913) is full of delightful humour, as readers of \"Love and Pie\" will readily discover for themselves.  \"The File-cutter's L'ament \" (see below), which I have selected from Mr. Downing's volume, Smook thru' a Shevvield Chimla, will show that the Sheffield \"blade\" is doing his best to carry on the tradition set by Abel Bywater eighty years ago.  Airedale still has its poets, among the most ambitious of whom is Mr. Malham-Dembleby, who published in 1912 a volume of verse entitled, Original Tales and Ballads in the Yorkshire Dialect.  Mr. F. J. Newboult has deservedly won fame as a prosewriter in dialect; his dialect sketches which have for some years appeared in The Yorkshire Observer are full of broad humour and dramatic power, and his dainty little lyric \"Spring\" (p. 87) is a sufficient indication that he has also the dower of the poet. In Alderman Ben Turner of Batley Yorkshire possesses a courageous advocate of the social betterment of the working man and woman, and in the midst of a busy life he has, found' time to give utterance to his indignation and his faith in dialect-poems which appeal from the heart to the heart.  Mr.  Walter Hampson, of Normanton, writes in a lighter vein in his Tykes Abrooad (1911); he is our Yorkshire Mark Twain, and his narrative of the adventures of a little party of Yorkshiremen in Normandy and Brittany is full of humour.  Songs are scattered through the story, and one of these, \"Owd England,\" finds a place in this collection.  The Colne Valley and the country round Huddersfield has been somewhat slow in responding to the call of the homely muse of dialect but Mr. E. A. Lodge's little volume of verse and prose.  entitled Odds an' Ends, marks a successful beginning.  In our account of the history of dialect poetry in Yorkshire it will have been noticed that the chief forms of verse to which local poets have"]]]
