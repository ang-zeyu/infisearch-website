To My Pupil.      Beloved pupil! Tamed by thee,      Addish-, Subtrac-, Multiplica-tion,    Division, Fractions, Rule of Three,      Attest thy deft manipulation!     Then onward! Let the voice of Fame      From Age to Age repeat thy story,    Till thou hast won thyself a name      Exceeding even Euclid's glory!     PREFACE.   This Tale originally appeared as a serial in _The Monthly Packet_, beginning in April, 1880. The writer's intention was to embody in each Knot (like the medicine so dexterously, but ineffectually, concealed in the jam of our early childhood) one or more mathematical questions--in Arithmetic, Algebra, or Geometry, as the case might be--for the amusement, and possible edification, of the fair readers of that Magazine.

KNOT I.  EXCELSIOR.   \"Goblin, lead them up and down.\"   The ruddy glow of sunset was already fading into the sombre shadows of night, when two travellers might have been observed swiftly--at a pace of six miles in the hour--descending the rugged side of a mountain; the younger bounding from crag to crag with the agility of a fawn, while his companion, whose aged limbs seemed ill at ease in the heavy chain armour habitually worn by tourists in that district, toiled on painfully at his side.  As is always the case under such circumstances, the younger knight was the first to break the silence.  \"A goodly pace, I trow!\" he exclaimed. \"We sped not thus in the ascent!\"  \"Goodly, indeed!\" the other echoed with a groan. \"We clomb it but at three miles in the hour.\"  \"And on the dead level our pace is----?\" the younger suggested; for he was weak in statistics, and left all such details to his aged companion.  \"Four miles in the hour,\" the other wearily replied. \"Not an ounce more,\" he added, with that love of metaphor so common in old age, \"and not a farthing less!\"  \"'Twas three hours past high noon when we left our hostelry,\" the young man said, musingly. \"We shall scarce be back by supper-time. Perchance mine host will roundly deny us all food!\"  \"He will chide our tardy return,\" was the grave reply, \"and such a rebuke will be meet.\"  \"A brave conceit!\" cried the other, with a merry laugh. \"And should we bid him bring us yet another course, I trow his answer will be tart!\"  \"We shall but get our deserts,\" sighed the elder knight, who had never seen a joke in his life, and was somewhat displeased at his companion's untimely levity. \"'Twill be nine of the clock,\" he added in an undertone, \"by the time we regain our hostelry. Full many a mile shall we have plodded this day!\"  \"How many? How many?\" cried the eager youth, ever athirst for knowledge.  The old man was silent.  \"Tell me,\" he answered, after a moment's thought, \"what time it was when we stood together on yonder peak. Not exact to the minute!\" he added hastily, reading a protest in the young man's face. \"An' thy guess be within one poor half-hour of the mark, 'tis all I ask of thy mother's son! Then will I tell thee, true to the last inch, how far we shall have trudged betwixt three and nine of the clock.\"  A groan was the young man's only reply; while his convulsed features and the deep wrinkles that chased each other across his manly brow, revealed the abyss of arithmetical agony into which one chance question had plunged him.     KNOT II.  ELIGIBLE APARTMENTS.     \"Straight down the crooked lane,    And all round the square.\"   \"Let's ask Balbus about it,\" said Hugh.  \"All right,\" said Lambert.  \"_He_ can guess it,\" said Hugh.  \"Rather,\" said Lambert.  No more words were needed: the two brothers understood each other perfectly.  [Illustration: \"BALBUS WAS ASSISTING HIS MOTHER-IN-LAW TO CONVINCE THE DRAGON.\"]  Balbus was waiting for them at the hotel: the journey down had tired him, he said: so his two pupils had been the round of the place, in search of lodgings, without the old tutor who had been their inseparable companion from their childhood. They had named him after the hero of their Latin exercise-book, which overflowed with anecdotes of that versatile genius--anecdotes whose vagueness in detail was more than compensated by their sensational brilliance. \"Balbus has overcome all his enemies\" had been marked by their tutor, in the margin of the book, \"Successful Bravery.\" In this way he had tried to extract a moral from every anecdote about Balbus--sometimes one of warning, as in \"Balbus had borrowed a healthy dragon,\" against which he had written \"Rashness in Speculation\"--sometimes of encouragement, as in the words \"Influence of Sympathy in United Action,\" which stood opposite to the anecdote \"Balbus was assisting his mother-in-law to convince the dragon\"--and sometimes it dwindled down to a single word, such as \"Prudence,\" which was all he could extract from the touching record that \"Balbus, having scorched the tail of the dragon, went away.\" His pupils liked the short morals best, as it left them more room for marginal illustrations, and in this instance they required all the space they could get to exhibit the rapidity of the hero's departure.  Their report of the state of things was discouraging. That most fashionable of watering-places, Little Mendip, was \"chockfull\" (as the boys expressed it) from end to end. But in one Square they had seen no less than four cards, in different houses, all announcing in flaming capitals \"ELIGIBLE APARTMENTS.\" \"So there's plenty of choice, after all, you see,\" said spokesman Hugh in conclusion.  \"That doesn't follow from the data,\" said Balbus, as he rose from the easy chair, where he had been dozing over _The Little Mendip Gazette_. \"They may be all single rooms. However, we may as well see them. I shall be glad to stretch my legs a bit.\"  An unprejudiced bystander might have objected that the operation was needless, and that this long, lank creature would have been all the better with even shorter legs: but no such thought occurred to his loving pupils. One on each side, they did their best to keep up with his gigantic strides, while Hugh repeated the sentence in their father's letter, just received from abroad, over which he and Lambert had been puzzling. \"He says a friend of his, the Governor of----_what_ was that name again, Lambert?\" (\"Kgovjni,\" said Lambert.) \"Well, yes. The Governor of----what-you-may-call-it----wants to give a _very_ small dinner-party, and he means to ask his father's brother-in-law, his brother's father-in-law, his father-in-law's brother, and his brother-in-law's father: and we're to guess how many guests there will be.\"  There was an anxious pause. \"_How_ large did he say the pudding was to be?\" Balbus said at last. \"Take its cubical contents, divide by the cubical contents of what each man can eat, and the quotient----\"  \"He didn't say anything about pudding,\" said Hugh, \"--and here's the Square,\" as they turned a corner and came into sight of the \"eligible apartments.\"  \"It _is_ a Square!\" was Balbus' first cry of delight, as he gazed around him. \"Beautiful! Beau-ti-ful! Equilateral! _And_ rectangular!\"  The boys looked round with less enthusiasm. \"Number nine is the first with a card,\" said prosaic Lambert; but Balbus would not so soon awake from his dream of beauty.  \"See, boys!\" he cried. \"Twenty doors on a side! What symmetry! Each side divided into twenty-one equal parts! It's delicious!\"  \"Shall I knock, or ring?\" said Hugh, looking in some perplexity at a square brass plate which bore the simple inscription \"RING ALSO.\"  \"Both,\" said Balbus. \"That's an Ellipsis, my boy. Did you never see an Ellipsis before?\"  \"I couldn't hardly read it,\" said Hugh, evasively. \"It's no good having an Ellipsis, if they don't keep it clean.\"  \"Which there is _one_ room, gentlemen,\" said the smiling landlady. \"And a sweet room too! As snug a little back-room----\"  \"We will see it,\" said Balbus gloomily, as they followed her in. \"I knew how it would be! One room in each house! No view, I suppose?\"  \"Which indeed there _is_, gentlemen!\" the landlady indignantly protested, as she drew up the blind, and indicated the back garden.  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29042"],["title","A Tangled Tale (#1)"],["body","\"Cabbages, I perceive,\" said Balbus. \"Well, they're green, at any rate.\"  \"Which the greens at the shops,\" their hostess explained, \"are by no means dependable upon. Here you has them on the premises, _and_ of the best.\"  \"Does the window open?\" was always Balbus' first question in testing a lodging: and \"Does the chimney smoke?\" his second. Satisfied on all points, he secured the refusal of the room, and they moved on to Number Twenty-five.  This landlady was grave and stern. \"I've nobbut one room left,\" she told them: \"and it gives on the back-gyardin.\"  \"But there are cabbages?\" Balbus suggested.  The landlady visibly relented. \"There is, sir,\" she said: \"and good ones, though I say it as shouldn't. We can't rely on the shops for greens. So we grows them ourselves.\"  \"A singular advantage,\" said Balbus: and, after the usual questions, they went on to Fifty-two.  \"And I'd gladly accommodate you all, if I could,\" was the greeting that met them. \"We are but mortal,\" (\"Irrelevant!\" muttered Balbus) \"and I've let all my rooms but one.\"  \"Which one is a back-room, I perceive,\" said Balbus: \"and looking out on--on cabbages, I presume?\"  \"Yes, indeed, sir!\" said their hostess. \"Whatever _other_ folks may do, _we_ grows our own. For the shops----\"  \"An excellent arrangement!\" Balbus interrupted. \"Then one can really depend on their being good. Does the window open?\"  The usual questions were answered satisfactorily: but this time Hugh added one of his own invention--\"Does the cat scratch?\"  The landlady looked round suspiciously, as if to make sure the cat was not listening, \"I will not deceive you, gentlemen,\" she said. \"It _do_ scratch, but not without you pulls its whiskers! It'll never do it,\" she repeated slowly, with a visible effort to recall the exact words of some written agreement between herself and the cat, \"without you pulls its whiskers!\"  \"Much may be excused in a cat so treated,\" said Balbus, as they left the house and crossed to Number Seventy-three, leaving the landlady curtseying on the doorstep, and still murmuring to herself her parting words, as if they were a form of blessing, \"---- not without you pulls its whiskers!\"  At Number Seventy-three they found only a small shy girl to show the house, who said \"yes'm\" in answer to all questions.  \"The usual room,\" said Balbus, as they marched in: \"the usual back-garden, the usual cabbages. I suppose you can't get them good at the shops?\"  \"Yes'm,\" said the girl.  \"Well, you may tell your mistress we will take the room, and that her plan of growing her own cabbages is simply _admirable_!\"  \"Yes'm,\" said the girl, as she showed them out.  \"One day-room and three bed-rooms,\" said Balbus, as they returned to the hotel. \"We will take as our day-room the one that gives us the least walking to do to get to it.\"  \"Must we walk from door to door, and count the steps?\" said Lambert.  \"No, no! Figure it out, my boys, figure it out!\" Balbus gaily exclaimed, as he put pens, ink, and paper before his hapless pupils, and left the room.  \"I say! It'll be a job!\" said Hugh.  \"Rather!\" said Lambert.     KNOT III.  MAD MATHESIS.     \"I waited for the train.\"   \"Well, they call me so because I _am_ a little mad, I suppose,\" she said, good-humouredly, in answer to Clara's cautiously-worded question as to how she came by so strange a nick-name. \"You see, I never do what sane people are expected to do now-a-days. I never wear long trains, (talking of trains, that's the Charing Cross Metropolitan Station--I've something to tell you about _that_), and I never play lawn-tennis. I can't cook an omelette. I can't even set a broken limb! _There's_ an ignoramus for you!\"  Clara was her niece, and full twenty years her junior; in fact, she was still attending a High School--an institution of which Mad Mathesis spoke with undisguised aversion. \"Let a woman be meek and lowly!\" she would say. \"None of your High Schools for me!\" But it was vacation-time just now, and Clara was her guest, and Mad Mathesis was showing her the sights of that Eighth Wonder of the world--London.  \"The Charing Cross Metropolitan Station!\" she resumed, waving her hand towards the entrance as if she were introducing her niece to a friend. \"The Bayswater and Birmingham Extension is just completed, and the trains now run round and round continuously--skirting the border of Wales, just touching at York, and so round by the east coast back to London. The way the trains run is _most_ peculiar. The westerly ones go round in two hours; the easterly ones take three; but they always manage to start two trains from here, opposite ways, punctually every quarter-of-an-hour.\"  \"They part to meet again,\" said Clara, her eyes filling with tears at the romantic thought.  \"No need to cry about it!\" her aunt grimly remarked. \"They don't meet on the same line of rails, you know. Talking of meeting, an idea strikes me!\" she added, changing the subject with her usual abruptness. \"Let's go opposite ways round, and see which can meet most trains. No need for a chaperon--ladies' saloon, you know. You shall go whichever way you like, and we'll have a bet about it!\"  \"I never make bets,\" Clara said very gravely. \"Our excellent preceptress has often warned us----\"  \"You'd be none the worse if you did!\" Mad Mathesis interrupted. \"In fact, you'd be the better, I'm certain!\"  \"Neither does our excellent preceptress approve of puns,\" said Clara. \"But we'll have a match, if you like. Let me choose my train,\" she added after a brief mental calculation, \"and I'll engage to meet exactly half as many again as you do.\"  \"Not if you count fair,\" Mad Mathesis bluntly interrupted. \"Remember, we only count the trains we meet _on the way_. You mustn't count the one that starts as you start, nor the one that arrives as you arrive.\"  \"That will only make the difference of _one_ train,\" said Clara, as they turned and entered the station. \"But I never travelled alone before. There'll be no one to help me to alight. However, I don't mind. Let's have a match.\"  A ragged little boy overheard her remark, and came running after her. \"Buy a box of cigar-lights, Miss!\" he pleaded, pulling her shawl to attract her attention. Clara stopped to explain.  \"I never smoke cigars,\" she said in a meekly apologetic tone. \"Our excellent preceptress----,\" but Mad Mathesis impatiently hurried her on, and the little boy was left gazing after her with round eyes of amazement.  The two ladies bought their tickets and moved slowly down the central platform, Mad Mathesis prattling on as usual--Clara silent, anxiously reconsidering the calculation on which she rested her hopes of winning the match.  \"Mind where you go, dear!\" cried her aunt, checking her just in time. \"One step more, and you'd have been in that pail of cold water!\"  \"I know, I know,\" Clara said, dreamily. \"The pale, the cold, and the moony----\"  \"Take your places on the spring-boards!\" shouted a porter.  \"What are _they_ for!\" Clara asked in a terrified whisper.  \"Merely to help us into the trains.\" The elder lady spoke with the nonchalance of one quite used to the process. \"Very few people can get into a carriage without help in less than three seconds, and the trains only stop for one second.\" At this moment the whistle was heard, and two trains rushed into the station. A moment's pause, and they were gone again; but in that brief interval several hundred passengers had been shot into them, each flying straight to his place with the accuracy of a Minie bullet--while an equal number were showered out upon the side-platforms.  Three hours had passed away, and the two friends met again on the Charing Cross platform, and eagerly compared notes. Then Clara turned away with a sigh. To young impulsive hearts, like hers, disappointment is always a bitter pill. Mad Mathesis followed her, full of kindly sympathy.  \"Try again, my love!\" she said, cheerily. \"Let us vary the experiment. We will start as we did before, but not to begin counting till our trains meet. When we see each other, we will say 'One!' and so count on till we come here again.\"  Clara brightened up. \"I shall win _that_,\" she exclaimed eagerly, \"if I may choose my train!\"  Another shriek of engine whistles, another upheaving of spring-boards, another living avalanche plunging into two trains as they flashed by: and the travellers were off again.  Each gazed eagerly from her carriage window, holding up her handkerchief as a signal to her friend. A rush and a roar. Two trains shot past each other in a tunnel, and two travellers leaned back in their corners with a sigh--or rather with _two_ sighs--of relief. \"One!\" Clara murmured to herself. \"Won! It's a word of good omen. _This_ time, at any rate, the victory will be mine!\"  But _was_ it?     KNOT IV.  THE DEAD RECKONING.     \"I did dream of money-bags to-night.\"   Noonday on the open sea within a few degrees of the Equator is apt to be oppressively warm; and our two travellers were now airily clad in suits of dazzling white linen, having laid aside the chain-armour which they had found not only endurable in the cold mountain air they had lately been breathing, but a necessary precaution against the daggers of the banditti who infested the heights. Their holiday-trip was over, and they were now on their way home, in the monthly packet which plied between the two great ports of the island they had been exploring.  Along with their armour, the tourists had laid aside the antiquated speech it had pleased them to affect while in knightly disguise, and had returned to the ordinary style of two country gentlemen of the Twentieth Century.  Stretched on a pile of cushions, under the shade of a huge umbrella, they were lazily watching some native fishermen, who had come on board at the last landing-place, each carrying over his shoulder a small but heavy sack. A large weighing-machine, that had been used for cargo at the last port, stood on the deck; and round this the fishermen had gathered, and, with much"]]]
