IN       this volume the author has sought to lay before the reader a       description of life and times lying beyond the light of history.       This is indeed an extensive subject, and calls for some       explanation, both as to the general design of the work and what       steps have been taken to secure correct information.        History is a word of varied import. In general, when we talk       about history, we mean those accounts of past events, times, and       circumstances of which we have written records. Not necessarily       meaning alphabetical writing, because hieroglyphic records have       furnished much true history. Hieroglyphic writing, which long       preceded alphabetical writing, is itself a comparatively recent       art. In no country do we find any records carrying us further       back than a few thousand years before the Christian era. We have       every reason to believe that the historical part of man’s life on       the globe is but an insignificant part of the whole. This       historic period is not the same in all countries. It varies from       a few centuries in our own country to a few thousands of years in       Oriental lands. In no country is there a hard and fast line       separating the historic period from the prehistoric. In the dim       perspective of years the light gradually fades away, the mist       grows thicker and thicker before us, and we at last find       ourselves face to face with the unknown past.        This extensive period of time is not, however, utterly lost to       us. We have simply to gather our information in some other way.       Enthusiastic explorers, digging beneath the ashes of Vesuvius,       have brought to light the remains of an entombed city. Of this       city we indeed have historic records, but even if all such       records had long since disappeared, we would gather much       information as to the nationality of the inhabitants, their       customs, and manners, by a simple inspection of the relics       themselves. Everywhere over the earth, entombed beneath the feet       of the living, or crumbling on the surface, are the few relics of       a past far antedating the relics of Pompeii. They are the proofs       positive that some people inhabited the land in far away times.        Our object is to gather together the conclusions of the       scientific world as to primitive man. We wish to see how far back       in the geological history of the globe we can find evidence of       man’s existence, and we desire to learn his surroundings and the       manner of his life. There can be no more important field than for       us to thus learn of the past. To read the story of primitive man,       to walk with him the earth in ages long ago, with him to wage war       on the huge animals of a previous epoch, to recede with him       before the relentless march of the ice of the Glacial Age, to       watch his advance in culture, to investigate whether there are       any races of men now living which are the direct descendants of       this primeval man.        The author makes no claims to original investigations. He trusts,       however, it will not be considered impertinent for a mere       loiterer in the vestibule of the temple of science to attempt to       lay before others the results of the investigations of our       eminent scholars. He has endeavored faithfully to perform this       task. As far as possible technical language has been avoided.       This is because he has written not for the distinctively       scientific men, but rather for the farmer, the mechanic, and the       man of business. Constant references are made to the authorities       consulted. The reader his a right to know who vouches for the       statements made in the text.        The pleasantest part of an author’s duty is to return thanks for       assistance. After the manuscript was prepared with what care       could be bestowed on it, it was determined to submit it to some       of our best American scholars for criticism. Accordingly, each of       the gentlemen named on the title page were requested to review       one or more chapters. As far as possible, each one was asked to       review that chapter or chapters for which, either by reason of       the position they held, or the interest they were known to take       in such subjects, they would by common assent be acknowledged as       eminently fitted to sit in judgment. In justice to them, it       should be stated that they were not expected to concern       themselves with the literary merits or demerits of the       manuscript, but to criticise the scientific statements made       therein. To each and all of these gentlemen the author would       acknowledge his deep obligations.        We are indebted to Rev. J. P. MacLean, the well-known       archaeologist, both for many valuable suggestions, and for the       use of wood-cuts on pages 60, 138 and 396. We are also under       obligation to Rev. S. D. Peet, editor of the _American       Antiquarian,_ for cuts illustrative of the effigy mounds of       Wisconsin. The officials of the Smithsonian Institution, and the       Bureau of Ethnology have our thanks for many cuts, for which       credit is given them throughout the work.        Finally, the author wishes to say that it was the intention to       make this work the joint production of the author and his       partner, Mr. S. C. Ferguson, but before any progress was made it       was deemed advisable to change the programme. While the literary       work has all been performed by the author, the many details       necessarily connected with the publication of "]]]
