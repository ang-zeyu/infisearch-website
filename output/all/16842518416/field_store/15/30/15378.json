The Infant beat you to it! He got his message to me first!\"         *       *       *       *       *  How he got to the flat-roofed landing zone of the Consolidated Electric, Danny, doubtless, could never have told. Nor was he aware of the hand that set in the forward cabin of his ship a strange machine. But he growled his instructions:  \"Set it goin'! 'Tis the Infant's orders--I mean Mr. Morgan's. What the devil it is I don't know, but 'Turn it on!' he told me--'Have them put it on full!'\" And, though a man whom Danny knew only as Gimlet-eyes stared at him curiously, he reached down to the apparatus, set a dial, closed a switch here and there, then stepped back.  But Gimlet-eyes ventured one protest. \"You're not grounding it!\" he exclaimed, in a voice that was tinged with horror. \"You'll get an accumulation on your ship that will shoot off like lightning--millions of volts!\"  \"How long would that be takin'?\" Danny inquired gruffly.  And Gimlet-eyes replied, as one who washes his hands of all responsibility in a rather horrible affair: \"An hour--not more than an hour!\"  \"Then I'll just be drivin' around for an hour,\" said Danny, and slammed shut the door-port of the red ship.         *       *       *       *       *  The red rocket drove in slow circles that were a hundred miles across while that hour passed and the numbness of mind that had held Danny in a stupor slipped away. For the first time he realized the emptiness of the world that the Infant had left; he knew with a sharp stab of self-reproach how much had gone from his life in that instant when he sprang vainly toward the giant enemy.  He called himself wild names for his fancied sluggishness. Then that, too, passed, and at thought of the weapon the Infant had given him and of the work that lay ahead, his haggard face forgot the lines that horror had drawn and relaxed into a tired smile that told of a mind content.  Gradually his looping whirls had carried him toward the east. Another city was being devastated by the enemy; that Danny got from the newscast. Only that and one other message broke the tedious eternity of that long hour.  Danny's number flashed on the screen beside his controls. Unconsciously he answered, but he sat up alertly at sound of his Chief's voice.  \"I can't get anyone,\" the voice said. \"Headquarters is gone; I just called you on a chance. And I believe you now, Danny. That devil wiped out a whole fleet of our planes; melted the cruisers with one shot, and the scouts couldn't go fast enough to escape. Only one got away....  \"But where are you? What's to be done? I've just got here. My God! What can we do?\"  \"Wait,\" said Danny O'Rourke calmly, and glanced at his watch; \"wait for another ten minutes! He's over Boston now. And he's waitin' there for me--though he doesn't know it yet. But I'll be droppin' in on him.\"  \"Don't be an utter fool, Danny,\" urged the voice of the Chief; \"there isn't a thing you can do. You try to come down on him, and he'll do as he did with the cruisers--just slip aside like lightning and nail you with his damned heat ray when you're below! I'm near Boston now. You keep away. Where can I meet you? We've got to think--got to do something!\"         *       *       *       *       *  And Danny, before he opened the switch that ended their talk, said meditatively: \"Like lightnin' he moves ... but he'll have to move _faster_ than lightnin' to dodge me. And if you're near Boston, stick around; I'm comin' now, but not to meet you, Chief; I've got another important engagement. I'm keepin' it for--for the Infant. And give the Infant the credit, Chief; give it all to him, he's earned it: he's paid for it in full.\" Then the snap of a switch cut off the sound of Danny's voice before it showed a tell-tale quaver.  It was steady some minutes later, when Danny swept in above the mounting clouds that he had learned to know. Beneath them invisible fingers of death were sweeping back and forth where men and women ran shrieking in terror or waited calmly and dry-eyed for the end. Above them a slender rounded thing wove its pattern of destruction back and forth ... back and forth. A spectral ship--a pale phantom, elusive and dimly seen until it came against the black of rolling smoke from below.  But to Danny O'Rourke, slanting down from tremendous heights, the white shape was never lost. On the cross hairs of his directional sights the ghostly ship hung, and Danny threw his own red rocket like a living flame over and down where the white one sensed his coming and waited.  Beside him a human voice, high with horror, called to him. \"Come back!\" the Chief of the Mountain Division was commanding. \"Danny! For the love of Heaven, turn back!\"         *       *       *       *       *  But the voice was unheard by Danny O'Rourke. There was another voice speaking ... he could almost see the smiling pink and white face of one beside him who spoke of his \"little tin ship\" ... spoke, too, of a white ship that would be like a great thunder-cloud ... and of his own screaming meteor that was like the earth ... and there was to be a messenger of death like the hammer of Thor that would flash between the two....  Danny saw the white one slipping easily aside; the ship was swelling suddenly before him--it was close ... but the jagged lightning--the ripping flash of blue that joined the two craft in a crashing arc--was neither seen nor heard by Danny. Danny was too busy to notice, for he was engaged in smiling converse with one whom he called the \"Infant\" and whose pink and white face beamed gladly upon him \"like a damned little cherub,\" as Danny was telling him....  But the Chief of the Mountain Division who saw all from afar could say nothing. He only stared from the lookout of his own speeding plane that framed a picture of two ships; where the red one, flaming from within, kept on in its swift, straight dive; while the white one fell slowly, turning sluggishly to show its gashed and blasted sides ... till the black clouds wrapped them both in a billowy shroud....  But clouds are no bar to man's inner vision. And the Chief looked through, as Danny had done, to see as in a lightning flash a world beaten to its knees, hopeless, ravaged and scarred--a world where courage might again be born--a world that would still be a world of men.         *       *       *       *       *"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29204"],["title","Arm of the Law (#0)"],["body","could a robot--a machine, after all--be involved in something     like law application and violence? Harry Harrison, who will be     remembered for his THE VELVET GLOVE (Nov. 1956) and his more recent     TRAINEE FOR MARS (June 1958) tells what happens when a police robot     hits an outpost on Mars._    arm   of  the  law   _by ... Harry Harrison_    At one time--this was before the Robot  Restriction Laws--they'd even allowed  them to make their own decisions....   It was a big, coffin-shaped plywood box that looked like it weighed a ton. This brawny type just dumped it through the door of the police station and started away. I looked up from the blotter and shouted at the trucker's vanishing back.  \"What the hell is that?\"  \"How should I know?\" he said as he swung up into the cab. \"I just deliver, I don't X-ray 'em. It came on the morning rocket from earth is all I know.\" He gunned the truck more than he had to and threw up a billowing cloud of red dust.  \"Jokers,\" I growled to myself. \"Mars is full of jokers.\"  When I went over to look at the box I could feel the dust grate between my teeth. Chief Craig must have heard the racket because he came out of his office and helped me stand and look at the box.  \"Think it's a bomb?\" he asked in a bored voice.  \"Why would anyone bother--particularly with a thing this size? And all the way from earth.\"  He nodded agreement and walked around to look at the other end. There was no sender's address anywhere on the outside. Finally we had to dig out the crowbar and I went to work on the top. After some prying it pulled free and fell off.  That was when we had our first look at Ned. We all would have been a lot happier if it had been our last look as well. If we had just put the lid back on and shipped the thing back to earth! I know now what they mean about Pandora's Box.  But we just stood there and stared like a couple of rubes. Ned lay motionless and stared back at us.  \"A robot!\" the Chief said.  \"Very observant; it's easy to see you went to the police academy.\"  \"Ha ha! Now find out what he's doing here.\"  I hadn't gone to the academy, but this was no handicap to my finding the letter. It was sticking up out of a thick book in a pocket in the box. The Chief took the letter and read it with little enthusiasm.  \"Well, well! United Robotics have the brainstorm that ... _robots, correctly used will tend to prove invaluable in police work_ ... they want us to co-operate in a field test ... _robot enclosed is the latest experimental model; valued at 120,000 credits_.\"  We both looked back at the robot, sharing the wish that the credits had been in the box instead of it. The Chief frowned and moved his lips through the rest of the letter. I wondered how we got the robot out of its plywood coffin.  Experimental model or not, this was a nice-looking hunk of machinery. A uniform navy-blue all over, though the outlet cases, hooks and such were a metallic gold. Someone had gone to a lot of trouble to get that effect. This was as close as a robot could look to a cop in uniform, without being a joke. All that seemed to be missing was the badge and gun.  Then I noticed the tiny glow of light in the robot's eye lenses. It had never occurred to me before that the thing might be turned on. There was nothing to lose by finding out.  \"Get out of that box,\" I said.  The robot came up smooth and fast as a rocket, landing two feet in front of me and whipping out a snappy salute.  \"Police Experimental Robot, serial number XPO-456-934B, reporting for duty, sir.\"  His voice quivered with alertness and I could almost hear the humming of those taut cable muscles. He may have had a stainless steel hide and a bunch of wires for a brain--but he spelled rookie cop to me just the same. The fact that he was man-height with two arms, two legs and that painted-on uniform helped. All I had to do was squint my eyes a bit and there stood Ned the Rookie Cop. Fresh out of school and raring to go. I shook my head to get rid of the illusion. This was just six feet of machine that boffins and brain-boys had turned out for their own amusement.  \"Relax, Ned,\" I said. He was still holding the salute. \"At ease. You'll get a hernia of your exhaust pipe if you stay so tense. Anyways, I'm just the sergeant here. That's the Chief of Police over there.\"  Ned did an about face and slid over to the Chief with that same greased-lightning motion. The Chief just looked at him like something that sprang out from under the hood of a car, while Ned went through the same report routine.  \"I wonder if it does anything else beside salute and report,\" the Chief said while he walked around the robot, looking it over like a dog with a hydrant.  \"The functions, operations and responsible courses of action open to the Police Experimental Robots are outlined on pages 184 to 213 of the manual.\" Ned's voice was muffled for a second while he half-dived back into his case and came up with the volume mentioned. \"A detailed breakdown of these will also be found on pages 1035 to 1267 inclusive.\"  The Chief, who has trouble reading an entire comic page at one sitting, turned the 6-inch-thick book over in his hands like it would maybe bite him. When he had a rough idea of how much it weighed and a good feel of the binding he threw it on my desk.  \"Take care of this,\" he said to me as he headed towards his office. \"And the robot, too. Do something with it.\" The Chief's span of attention never was great and it had been strained to the limit this time.  I flipped through the book, wondering. One thing I never have had much to do with is robots, so I know just as much about them as any Joe in the street. Probably less. The book was filled with pages of fine print, fancy mathematics, wiring diagrams and charts in nine colors and that kind of thing. It needed close attention. Which attention I was not prepared to give at the time. The book slid shut and I eyed the newest employee of the city of Nineport.  \"There is a broom behind the door. Do you know how to use it?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"In that case you will sweep out this room, raising as small a cloud of dust as possible at the same time.\"  He did a very neat job of it.  I watched 120,000 credits worth of machinery making a tidy pile of butts and sand and wondered why it had been sent to Nineport. Probably because there wasn't another police force in the solar system that was smaller or more unimportant than ours. The engineers must have figured this would be a good spot for a field test. Even if the thing blew up, nobody would really mind. There would probably be someone along some day to get a report on it. Well, they had picked the right spot all right. Nineport was just a little bit beyond nowhere.  Which, of course, was why I was there. I was the only real cop on the force. They needed at least one to give an illusion of the wheels going around. The Chief, Alonzo Craig, had just enough sense to take graft without dropping the money. There were two patrolmen. One old and drunk most of the time. The other so young the only scar he had was the mark of the attram. I had ten years on a metropolitan force, earthside. Why I left is nobody's damn business. I have long since paid for any mistakes I made there by ending up in Nineport.  Nineport is not a city, it's just a place where people stop. The only permanent citizens are the ones who cater to those on the way through. Hotel keepers, restaurant owners, gamblers, barkeeps, and the rest.  There is a spaceport, but only some freighters come there. To pick up the metal from some of the mines that are still working. Some of the settlers still came in for supplies. You might say that Nineport was a town that just missed the boat. In a hundred years I doubt if there will be enough left sticking of the sand to even tell where it used to be. I won't be there either, so I couldn't care less.  I went back to the blotter. Five drunks in the tank, an average night's haul. While I wrote them up Fats dragged in the sixth one.  \"Locked himself in the ladies' john at the spaceport and resisting arrest,\" he reported.  \"D and D. Throw him in with the rest.\"  Fats steered his limp victim across the floor, matching him step for dragging step. I always marveled at the way Fats took care of drunks, since he usually had more under his belt than they had. I have never seen him falling down drunk or completely sober. About all he was good for was keeping a blurred eye on the lockup and running in drunks. He did well at that. No matter what they crawled under or on top of, he found them. No doubt due to the same shared natural instincts.  Fats clanged the door behind number six and weaved his way back in. \"What's that?\" he asked, peering at the robot along the purple beauty of his nose.  \"That is a robot. I have forgotten the number his mother gave him at the factory so we will call him Ned. He works here now.\"  \"Good for him! He can clean up the tank after we throw the bums out.\"  \"That's _my_ job,\" Billy said coming in through the front door. He clutched his nightstick and scowled out from under the brim of his uniform cap. It is not that Billy is stupid, just that most of his strength has gone into his back instead of his mind.  \"That's Ned's job now because you have a promotion. You are going to help me with some of my work.\"  Billy came in very handy at times and I was anxious that the force shouldn't lose him. My explanation cheered him because he sat down by Fats and watched Ned do the floor.  That's the way things went for about a week. We watched Ned sweep and polish until the station began to take on a positively antiseptic look. The Chief, who always has an eye out for that type of thing, found out that Ned could file the odd ton of reports and paperwork that cluttered his office. All this kept the robot busy, and we got so used to him we were hardly aware he was around. I knew he had moved the packing case into the storeroom and fixed himself up a cozy sort"]]]
