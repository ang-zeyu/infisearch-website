In an instant the glasses were at my eyes and I was following every movement of the skiff. There were two men in it, and though it was a good mile away, I made out one of them to be Big Alec; and ere the skiff returned to shore I made out enough more to know that the Greek had set his line.  \"Big Alec has a Chinese line out in the bight off Turner's Shipyard,\" Charley Le Grant said that afternoon to Carmintel.  A fleeting expression of annoyance passed over the patrolman's face, and then he said, \"Yes?\" in an absent way, and that was all.  Charley bit his lip with suppressed anger and turned on his heel.  \"Are you game, my lad?\" he said to me later on in the evening, just as we finished washing down the _Reindeer's_ decks and were preparing to turn in.  A lump came up in my throat, and I could only nod my head.  \"Well, then,\" and Charley's eyes glittered in a determined way, \"we've got to capture Big Alec between us, you and I, and we've got to do it in spite of Carmintel. Will you lend a hand?\"  \"It's a hard proposition, but we can do it,\" he added after a pause.  \"Of course we can,\" I supplemented enthusiastically.  And then he said, \"Of course we can,\" and we shook hands on it and went to bed.  But it was no easy task we had set ourselves. In order to convict a man of illegal fishing, it was necessary to catch him in the act with all the evidence of the crime about him--the hooks, the lines, the fish, and the man himself. This meant that we must take Big Alec on the open water, where he could see us coming and prepare for us one of the warm receptions for which he was noted.  \"There's no getting around it,\" Charley said one morning. \"If we can only get alongside it's an even toss, and there's nothing left for us but to try and get alongside. Come on, lad.\"  We were in the Columbia River salmon boat, the one we had used against the Chinese shrimp-catchers. Slack water had come, and as we dropped around the end of the Solano Wharf we saw Big Alec at work, running his line and removing the fish.  \"Change places,\" Charley commanded, \"and steer just astern of him as though you're going into the shipyard.\"  I took the tiller, and Charley sat down on a thwart amidships, placing his revolver handily beside him.  \"If he begins to shoot,\" he cautioned, \"get down in the bottom and steer from there, so that nothing more than your hand will be exposed.\"  I nodded, and we kept silent after that, the boat slipping gently through the water and Big Alec growing nearer and nearer. We could see him quite plainly, gaffing the sturgeon and throwing them into the boat while his companion ran the line and cleared the hooks as he dropped them back into the water. Nevertheless, we were five hundred yards away when the big fisherman hailed us.  \"Here! You! What do you want?\" he shouted.  \"Keep going,\" Charley whispered, \"just as though you didn't hear him.\"  The next few moments were very anxious ones. The fisherman was studying us sharply, while we were gliding up on him every second.  \"You keep off if you know what's good for you!\" he called out suddenly, as though he had made up his mind as to who and what we were. \"If you don't, I'll fix you!\"  He brought a rifle to his shoulder and trained it on me.  \"Now will you keep off?\" he demanded.  I could hear Charley groan with disappointment. \"Keep off,\" he whispered; \"it's all up for this time.\"  I put up the tiller and eased the sheet, and the salmon boat ran off five or six points. Big Alec watched us till we were out of range, when he returned to his work.  \"You'd better leave Big Alec alone,\" Carmintel said, rather sourly, to Charley that night.  \"So he's been complaining to you, has he?\" Charley said significantly.  Carmintel flushed painfully. \"You'd better leave him alone, I tell you,\" he repeated. \"He's a dangerous man, and it won't pay to fool with him.\"  \"Yes,\" Charley answered softly; \"I've heard that it pays better to leave him alone.\"  This was a direct thrust at Carmintel, and we could see by the expression of his face that it sank home. For it was common knowledge that Big Alec was as willing to bribe as to fight, and that of late years more than one patrolman had handled the fisherman's money.  \"Do you mean to say--\" Carmintel began, in a bullying tone.  But Charley cut him off shortly. \"I mean to say nothing,\" he said. \"You heard what I said, and if the cap fits, why--\"  He shrugged his shoulders, and Carmintel glowered at him, speechless.  \"What we want is imagination,\" Charley said to me one day, when we had attempted to creep upon Big Alec in the gray of dawn and had been shot at for our trouble.  And thereafter, and for many days, I cudgelled my brains trying to imagine some possible way by which two men, on an open stretch of water, could capture another who knew how to use a rifle and was never to be found without one. Regularly, every slack water, without slyness, boldly and openly in the broad day, Big Alec was to be seen running his line. And what made it particularly exasperating was the fact that every fisherman, from Benicia to Vallejo, knew that he was successfully defying us. Carmintel also bothered us, for he kept us busy among the shad-fishers of San Pablo, so that we had little time to spare on the King of the Greeks. But Charley's wife and children lived at Benicia, and we had made the place our headquarters, so that we always returned to it.  \"I'll tell you what we can do,\" I said, after several fruitless weeks had passed; \"we can wait some slack water till Big Alec has run his line and gone ashore with the fish, and then we can go out and capture the line. It will put him to time and expense to make another, and then we'll figure to capture that too. If we can't capture him, we can discourage him, you see.\"  Charley saw, and said it wasn't a bad idea. We watched our chance, and the next low-water slack, after Big Alec had removed the fish from the line and returned ashore, we went out in the salmon boat. We had the bearings of the line from shore marks, and we knew we would have no difficulty in locating it. The first of the flood tide was setting in, when we ran below where we thought the line was stretched and dropped over a fishing-boat anchor. Keeping a short rope to the anchor, so that it barely touched the bottom, we dragged it slowly along until it stuck and the boat fetched up hard and fast.  \"We've got it,\" Charley cried. \"Come on and lend a hand to get it in.\"  Together we hove up the rope till the anchor came in sight with the sturgeon line caught across one of the flukes. Scores of the murderous-looking hooks flashed into sight as we cleared the anchor, and we had just started to run along the line to the end where we could begin to lift it, when a sharp thud in the boat startled us. We looked about, but saw nothing and returned to our work. An instant later there was a similar sharp thud and the gunwale splintered between Charley's body and mine.  \"That's remarkably like a bullet, lad,\" he said reflectively. \"And it's a long shot Big Alec's making.\"  \"And he's using smokeless powder,\" he concluded, after an examination of the mile-distant shore. \"That's why we can't hear the report.\"  I looked at the shore, but could see no sign of Big Alec, who was undoubtedly hidden in some rocky nook with us at his mercy. A third bullet struck the water, glanced, passed singing over our heads, and struck the water again beyond.  \"I guess we'd better get out of this,\" Charley remarked coolly. \"What do you think, lad?\"  I thought so, too, and said we didn't want the line anyway. Whereupon we cast off and hoisted the spritsail. The bullets ceased at once, and we sailed away, unpleasantly confident that Big Alec was laughing at our discomfiture.  And more than that, the next day on the fishing wharf, where we were inspecting nets, he saw fit to laugh and sneer at us, and this before all the fishermen. Charley's face went black with anger; but beyond promising Big Alec that in the end he would surely land him behind the bars, he controlled himself and said nothing. The King of the Greeks made his boast that no fish patrol had ever taken him or ever could take him, and the fishermen cheered him and said it was true. They grew excited, and it looked like trouble for a while; but Big Alec asserted his kingship and quelled them.  Carmintel also laughed at Charley, and dropped sarcastic remarks, and made it hard for him. But Charley refused to be angered, though he told me in confidence that he intended to capture Big Alec if it took all the rest of his life to accomplish it.  \"I don't know how I'll do it,\" he said, \"but do it I will, as sure as I am Charley Le Grant. The idea will come to me at the right and proper time, never fear.\"  And at the right time it came, and most unexpectedly. Fully a month had passed, and we were constantly up and down the river, and down and up the bay, with no spare moments to devote to the particular fisherman who ran a Chinese line in the bight of Turner's Shipyard. We had called in at Selby's Smelter one afternoon, while on patrol work, when all unknown to us our opportunity happened along. It appeared in the guise of a helpless yacht loaded with seasick people, so we could hardly be expected to recognize it as the opportunity. It was a large sloop-yacht, and it was helpless inasmuch as the trade-wind was blowing half a gale and there were no capable sailors aboard.  [Illustration: \"He saw fit to laugh sneer at us, before all the fishermen.\"]  From the wharf at Selby's we watched with careless interest the lubberly manoeuvre performed of bringing the yacht to anchor, and the equally lubberly manoeuvre of sending the small boat ashore. A very miserable-looking man in draggled ducks, after nearly swamping the boat in the heavy seas, passed us the painter and climbed out. He staggered about as though the wharf were rolling, and told us his troubles,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28693"],["title","Tales of the Fish Patrol (#4)"],["body","were the troubles of the yacht. The only rough-weather sailor aboard, the man on whom they all depended, had been called back to San Francisco by a telegram, and they had attempted to continue the cruise alone. The high wind and big seas of San Pablo Bay had been too much for them; all hands were sick, nobody knew anything or could do anything; and so they had run in to the smelter either to desert the yacht or to get somebody to bring it to Benicia. In short, did we know of any sailors who would bring the yacht into Benicia?  Charley looked at me. The _Reindeer_ was lying in a snug place. We had nothing on hand in the way of patrol work till midnight. With the wind then blowing, we could sail the yacht into Benicia in a couple of hours, have several more hours ashore, and come back to the smelter on the evening train.  \"All right, captain,\" Charley said to the disconsolate yachtsman, who smiled in sickly fashion at the title.  \"I'm only the owner,\" he explained.  We rowed him aboard in much better style than he had come ashore, and saw for ourselves the helplessness of the passengers. There were a dozen men and women, and all of them too sick even to appear grateful at our coming. The yacht was rolling savagely, broad on, and no sooner had the owner's feet touched the deck than he collapsed and joined the others. Not one was able to bear a hand, so Charley and I between us cleared the badly tangled running gear, got up sail, and hoisted anchor.  It was a rough trip, though a swift one. The Carquinez Straits were a welter of foam and smother, and we came through them wildly before the wind, the big mainsail alternately dipping and flinging its boom skyward as we tore along. But the people did not mind. They did not mind anything. Two or three, including the owner, sprawled in the cockpit, shuddering when the yacht lifted and raced and sank dizzily into the trough, and between-whiles regarding the shore with yearning eyes. The rest were huddled on the cabin floor among the cushions. Now and again some one groaned, but for the most part they were as limp as so many dead persons.  As the bight at Turner's Shipyard opened out, Charley edged into it to get the smoother water. Benicia was in view, and we were bowling along over comparatively easy water, when a speck of a boat danced up ahead of us, directly in our course. It was low-water slack. Charley and I looked at each other. No word was spoken, but at once the yacht began a most astonishing performance, veering and yawing as though the greenest of amateurs was at the wheel. It was a sight for sailormen to see. To all appearances, a runaway yacht was careering madly over the bight, and now and again yielding a little bit to control in a desperate effort to make Benicia.  The owner forgot his seasickness long enough to look anxious. The speck of a boat grew larger and larger, till we could see Big Alec and his partner, with a turn of the sturgeon line around a cleat, resting from their labor to laugh at us. Charley pulled his sou'wester over his eyes, and I followed his example, though I could not guess the idea he evidently had in mind and intended to carry into execution.  We came foaming down abreast of the skiff, so close that we could hear above the wind the voices of Big Alec and his mate as they shouted at us with all the scorn that professional watermen feel for amateurs, especially when amateurs are making fools of themselves.  We thundered on past the fishermen, and nothing had happened. Charley grinned at the disappointment he saw in my face, and then shouted:  \"Stand by the main-sheet to jibe!\"  He put the wheel hard over, and the yacht whirled around obediently. The main-sheet slacked and dipped, then shot over our heads after the boom and tautened with a crash on the traveller. The yacht heeled over almost on her beam ends, and a great wail went up from the seasick passengers as they swept across the cabin floor in a tangled mass and piled into a heap in the starboard bunks.  But we had no time for them. The yacht, completing the manoeuvre, headed into the wind with slatting canvas, and righted to an even keel. We were still plunging ahead, and directly in our path was the skiff. I saw Big Alec dive over-board and his mate leap for our bowsprit. Then came the crash as we struck the boat, and a series of grinding bumps as it passed under our bottom.  \"That fixes his rifle,\" I heard Charley mutter, as he sprang upon the deck to look for Big Alec somewhere astern.  The wind and sea quickly stopped our forward movement, and we began to drift backward over the spot where the skiff had been. Big Alec's black head and swarthy face popped up within arm's reach; and all unsuspecting and very angry with what he took to be the clumsiness of amateur sailors, he was hauled aboard. Also he was out of breath, for he had dived deep and stayed down long to escape our keel.  The next instant, to the perplexity and consternation of the owner, Charley was on top of Big Alec in the cockpit, and I was helping bind him with gaskets. The owner was dancing excitedly about and demanding an explanation, but by that time Big Alec's partner had crawled aft from the bowsprit and was peering apprehensively over the rail into the cockpit. Charley's arm shot around his neck and the man landed on his back beside Big Alec.  \"More gaskets!\" Charley shouted, and I made haste to supply them.  The wrecked skiff was rolling sluggishly a short distance to windward, and I trimmed the sheets while Charley took the wheel and steered for it.  \"These two men are old offenders,\" he explained to the angry owner; \"and they are most persistent violators of the fish and game laws. You have seen them caught in the act, and you may expect to be subpoenaed as witness for the state when the trial comes off.\"  As he spoke he rounded alongside the skiff. It had been torn from the line, a section of which was dragging to it. He hauled in forty or fifty feet with a young sturgeon still fast in a tangle of barbless hooks, slashed that much of the line free with his knife, and tossed it into the cockpit beside the prisoners.  \"And there's the evidence, Exhibit A, for the people,\" Charley continued. \"Look it over carefully so that you may identify it in the court-room with the time and place of capture.\"  And then, in triumph, with no more veering and yawing, we sailed into Benicia, the King of the Greeks bound hard and fast in the cockpit, and for the first time in his life a prisoner of the fish patrol.     III  A RAID ON THE OYSTER PIRATES   Of the fish patrolmen under whom we served at various times, Charley Le Grant and I were agreed, I think, that Neil Partington was the best. He was neither dishonest nor cowardly; and while he demanded strict obedience when we were under his orders, at the same time our relations were those of easy comradeship, and he permitted us a freedom to which we were ordinarily unaccustomed, as the present story will show.  Neil's family lived in Oakland, which is on the Lower Bay, not more than six miles across the water from San Francisco. One day, while scouting among the Chinese shrimp-catchers of Point Pedro, he received word that his wife was very ill; and within the hour the _Reindeer_ was bowling along for Oakland, with a stiff northwest breeze astern. We ran up the Oakland Estuary and came to anchor, and in the days that followed, while Neil was ashore, we tightened up the _Reindeer's_ rigging, overhauled the ballast, scraped down, and put the sloop into thorough shape.  This done, time hung heavy on our hands. Neil's wife was dangerously ill, and the outlook was a week's lie-over, awaiting the crisis. Charley and I roamed the docks, wondering what we should do, and so came upon the oyster fleet lying at the Oakland City Wharf. In the main they were trim, natty boats, made for speed and bad weather, and we sat down on the stringer-piece of the dock to study them.  \"A good catch, I guess,\" Charley said, pointing to the heaps of oysters, assorted in three sizes, which lay upon their decks.  Pedlers were backing their wagons to the edge of the wharf, and from the bargaining and chaffering that went on, I managed to learn the selling price of the oysters.  \"That boat must have at least two hundred dollars' worth aboard,\" I calculated. \"I wonder how long it took to get the load?\"  \"Three or four days,\" Charley answered. \"Not bad wages for two men--twenty-five dollars a day apiece.\"  The boat we were discussing, the _Ghost_, lay directly beneath us. Two men composed its crew. One was a squat, broad-shouldered fellow with remarkably long and gorilla-like arms, while the other was tall and well proportioned, with clear blue eyes and a mat of straight black hair. So unusual and striking was this combination of hair and eyes that Charley and I remained somewhat longer than we intended.  And it was well that we did. A stout, elderly man, with the dress and carriage of a successful merchant, came up and stood beside us, looking down upon the deck of the _Ghost_. He appeared angry, and the longer he looked the angrier he grew.  \"Those are my oysters,\" he said at last. \"I know they are my oysters. You raided my beds last night and robbed me of them.\"  The tall man and the short man on the _Ghost_ looked up.  \"Hello, Taft,\" the short man said, with insolent familiarity. (Among the bayfarers he had gained the nickname of \"The Centipede\" on account of his long arms.) \"Hello, Taft,\" he repeated, with the same touch of insolence. \"Wot 'r you growlin' about now?\"  \"Those are my oysters--that's what I said. You've stolen them from my beds.\"  \"Yer mighty wise, ain't ye?\" was the Centipede's sneering reply. \"S'pose you can tell your oysters wherever you see 'em?\"  \"Now, in my experience,\" broke in the tall man, \"oysters is oysters wherever you find 'em, an' they're pretty much alike all the Bay over, and the world over, too, for that matter. We're not wantin' to quarrel with you, Mr."]]]
