After a little practice, he will find himself able to do without the blank Diagram, and will be able to see it _mentally_ (\"in my mind's eye, Horatio!\") while answering the questions of his genial friend. When _this_ result has been reached, he may safely go on to the next Chapter.                                                                     pg026  CHAPTER II.  _COUNTERS._   Let us agree that a _Red_ Counter, placed within a Cell, shall mean \"This Cell is _occupied_\" (i.e. \"There is at least _one_ Thing in it\").  Let us also agree that a _Red_ Counter, placed on the partition between two Cells, shall mean \"The Compartment, made up of these two Cells, is _occupied_; but it is not known _whereabouts_, in it, its occupants are.\" Hence it may be understood to mean \"At least _one_ of these two Cells is occupied: possibly _both_ are.\"  Our ingenious American cousins have invented a phrase to describe the condition of a man who has not yet made up his mind _which_ of two political parties he will join: such a man is said to be \"=sitting on the fence=.\" This phrase exactly describes the condition of the Red Counter.  Let us also agree that a _Grey_ Counter, placed within a Cell, shall mean \"This Cell is _empty_\" (i.e. \"There is _nothing_ in it\").      [The Reader had better provide himself with 4 Red Counters and 5     Grey ones.]                                                                     pg027  CHAPTER III.  _REPRESENTATION OF PROPOSITIONS._   § 1.  _Introductory._  Henceforwards, in stating such Propositions as \"Some x-Things exist\" or \"No x-Things are y-Things\", I shall omit the word \"Things\", which the Reader can supply for himself, and shall write them as \"Some x exist\" or \"No x are y\".      [Note that the word \"Things\" is here used with a special     meaning, as explained at p. 23.]  A Proposition, containing only _one_ of the Letters used as Symbols for Attributes, is said to be '=Uniliteral='.      [For example, \"Some x exist\", \"No y' exist\", &c.]  A Proposition, containing _two_ Letters, is said to be ='Biliteral'=.      [For example, \"Some xy' exist\", \"No x' are y\", &c.]  A Proposition is said to be '=in terms of=' the Letters it contains, whether with or without accents.      [Thus, \"Some xy' exist\", \"No x' are y\", &c., are said to be _in     terms of_ x and y.]                                                                     pg028 § 2.  _Representation of Propositions of Existence._  Let us take, first, the Proposition \"Some x exist\".      [Note that this Proposition is (as explained at p. 12)     equivalent to \"Some existing Things are x-Things.\"]  This tells us that there is at least _one_ Thing in the North Half; that is, that the North Half is _occupied_. And this we can evidently represent by placing a _Red_ Counter (here represented by a _dotted_ circle) on the partition which divides the North Half.      ·-------·     |  (.)  |     |---|---|     |   |   |     ·-------·      [In the \"books\" example, this Proposition would be \"Some old     books exist\".]  Similarly we may represent the three similar Propositions \"Some x' exist\", \"Some y exist\", and \"Some y' exist\".      [The Reader should make out all these for himself. In the     \"books\" example, these Propositions would be \"Some new books     exist\", &c.]  Let us take, next, the Proposition \"No x exist\".  This tells us that there is _nothing_ in the North Half; that is, that the North Half is _empty_; that is, that the North-West Cell and the North-East Cell are both of them _empty_. And this we can represent by placing _two Grey_ Counters in the North Half, one in each Cell.      ·-------·     |( )|( )|     |---|---|     |   |   |     ·-------·      [The Reader may perhaps think that it would be enough to place a     _Grey_ Counter on the partition in the North Half, and that,     just as a _Red_ Counter, so placed, would mean \"This Half is     _occupied_\", so a _Grey_ one would mean \"This Half is _empty_\".      This, however, would be a mistake. We have seen that a _Red_     Counter, so placed, would mean \"At least _one_ of these two     Cells is occupied: possibly _both_ are.\" Hence a _Grey_ one     would merely mean \"At least _one_ of these two Cells is empty:     possibly _both_ are\". But what we have to represent is, that     both Cells are _certainly_ empty: and this can only be done by     placing a _Grey_ Counter in _each_ of them.      In the \"books\" example, this Proposition would be \"No old books     exist\".]                                                                    pg029 Similarly we may represent the three similar Propositions \"No x' exist\", \"No y exist\", and \"No y' exist\".      [The Reader should make out all these for himself. In the     \"books\" example, these three Propositions would be \"No new books     exist\", &c.]  Let us take, next, the Proposition \"Some xy exist\".  This tells us that there is at least _one_ Thing in the North-West Cell; that is, that the North-West Cell is _occupied_. And this we can represent by placing a _Red_ Counter in it.      ·-------·     |(.)|   |     |---|---|     |   |   |     ·-------·      [In the \"books\" example, this Proposition would be \"Some old     English books exist\".]  Similarly we may represent the three similar Propositions \"Some xy' exist\", \"Some x'y exist\", and \"Some x'y' exist\".      [The Reader should make out all these for himself. In the     \"books\" example, these three Propositions would be \"Some old     foreign books exist\", &c.]  Let us take, next, the Proposition \"No xy exist\".  This tells us that there is _nothing_ in the North-West Cell; that is, that the North-West Cell is _empty_. And this we can represent by placing a _Grey_ Counter in it.      ·-------·     |( )|   |     |---|---|     |   |   |     ·-------·      [In the \"books\" example, this Proposition would be \"No old     English books exist\".]  Similarly we may represent the three similar Propositions \"No xy' exist\", \"No x'y exist\", and \"No x'y' exist\".      [The Reader should make out all these for himself. In the     \"books\" example, these three Propositions would be \"No old     foreign books exist\", &c.]                                                                    pg030 We have seen that the Proposition \"No x exist\" may be represented by placing _two Grey_ Counters in the North Half, one in each Cell.      ·-------·     |( )|( )|     |---|---|     |   |   |     ·-------·  We have also seen that these two _Grey_ Counters, taken _separately_, represent the two Propositions \"No xy exist\" and \"No xy' exist\".  Hence we see that the Proposition \"No x exist\" is a _Double_ Proposition, and is equivalent to the _two_ Propositions \"No xy exist\" and \"No xy' exist\".      [In the \"books\" example, this Proposition would be \"No old books     exist\".      Hence this is a _Double_ Proposition, and is equivalent to the     _two_ Propositions \"No old _English_ books exist\" and \"No old     _foreign_ books exist\".]   § 3.  _Representation of Propositions of Relation._  Let us take, first, the Proposition \"Some x are y\".  This tells us that at least _one_ Thing, in the _North_ Half, is also in the _West_ Half. Hence it must be in the space _common_ to them, that is, in the _North-West Cell_. Hence the North-West Cell is _occupied_. And this we can represent by placing a _Red_ Counter in it.      ·-------·     |(.)|   |     |---|---|     |   |   |     ·-------·      [Note that the _Subject_ of the Proposition settles which _Half_     we are to use; and that the _Predicate_ settles in which     _portion_ of it we are to place the Red Counter.      In the \"books\" example, this Proposition would be \"Some old     books are English\".]  Similarly we may represent the three similar Propositions \"Some x are y'\", \"Some x' are y\", and \"Some x' are y'\".      [The Reader should make out all these for himself. In the     \"books\" example, these three Propositions would be \"Some old     books are foreign\", &c.]                                                                    pg031 Let us take, next, the Proposition \"Some y are x\".  This tells us that at least _one_ Thing, in the _West_ Half, is also in the _North_ Half. Hence it must be in the space _common_ to them, that is, in the _North-West Cell_. Hence the North-West Cell is _occupied_. And this we can represent by placing a _Red_ Counter in it.      ·-------·     |(.)|   |     |---|---|     |   |   |     ·-------·      [In the \"books\" example, this Proposition would be \"Some English     books are old\".]  Similarly we may represent the three similar Propositions \"Some y are x'\", \"Some y' are x\", and \"Some y' are x'\".      [The Reader should make out all these for himself. In the     \"books\" example, these three Propositions would be \"Some English     books are new\", &c.]  We see that this _one_ Diagram has now served to represent no less than _three_ Propositions, viz.      (1) \"Some xy exist;     (2)  Some x are y;     (3)  Some y are x\".      ·-------·     |(.)|   |     |---|---|     |   |   |     ·-------·  Hence these three Propositions are equivalent.

DICK       _Stark terror ruled the Inner-Flight ship on that last Mars-Terra     run. For the black-clad Leiters were on the prowl ... and the grim     red planet was not far behind._   \"Attention, Inner-Flight ship! Attention! You are ordered to land at the Control Station on Deimos for inspection. Attention! You are to land at once!\"  The metallic rasp of the speaker echoed through the corridors of the great ship. The passengers glanced at each other uneasily, murmuring and peering out the port windows at the small speck below, the dot of rock that was the Martian checkpoint, Deimos.  \"What's up?\" an anxious passenger asked one of the pilots, hurrying through the ship to check the escape lock.  \"We have to land. Keep seated.\" The pilot went on.  \"Land? But why?\" They all looked at each other. Hovering above the bulging Inner-Flight ship were three slender Martian pursuit craft, poised and alert for any emergency. As the Inner-Flight ship prepared to land the pursuit ships dropped lower, carefully maintaining themselves a short distance away.  \"There's something going on,\" a woman passenger said nervously. \"Lord, I thought we were finally through with those Martians. Now what?\"  \"I don't blame them for giving us one last going over,\" a heavy-set business man said to his companion. \"After all, we're the last ship leaving Mars for Terra. We're damn lucky they let us go at all.\"  \"You think there really will be war?\" A young man said to the girl sitting in the seat next to him. \"Those Martians won't dare fight, not with our weapons and ability to produce. We could take care of Mars in a month. It's all talk.\"  The girl glanced at him. \"Don't be so sure. Mars is desperate. They'll fight tooth and nail. I've been on Mars three years.\" She shuddered. \"Thank goodness I'm getting away. If--\"  \"Prepare to land!\" the pilot's voice came. The ship began to settle slowly, dropping down toward the tiny emergency field on the seldom visited moon. Down, down the ship dropped. There was a grinding sound, a sickening jolt. Then silence.  \"We've landed,\" the heavy-set business man said. \"They better not do anything to us! Terra will rip them apart if they violate one Space Article.\"  \"Please keep your seats,\" the pilot's voice came. \"No one is to leave the ship, according to the Martian authorities. We are to remain here.\"  A restless stir filled the ship. Some of the passengers began to read uneasily, others stared out at the deserted field, nervous and on edge, watching the three Martian pursuit ships land and disgorge groups of armed men.  The Martian soldiers were crossing the field quickly, moving toward them, running double time.  This Inner-Flight spaceship was the last passenger vessel to leave Mars for Terra. All other ships had long since left, returning to safety before the outbreak of hostilities. The passengers were the very last to go, the final group of Terrans to leave the grim red planet, business men, expatriates, tourists, any and all Terrans who had not already gone home.  \"What do you suppose they want?\" the young man said to the girl. \"It's hard to figure Martians out, isn't it? First they give the ship clearance, let us take off, and now they radio us to set down again. By the way, my name's Thacher, Bob Thacher. Since we're going to be here awhile--\"  [Illustration]         *       *       *       *       *  The port lock opened. Talking ceased abruptly, as everyone turned. A black-clad Martian official, a Province Leiter, stood framed against the bleak sunlight, staring around the ship. Behind him a handful of Martian soldiers stood waiting, their guns ready.  \"This will not take long,\" the Leiter said, stepping into the ship, the soldiers following him. \"You will be allowed to continue your trip shortly.\"  An audible sigh of relief went through the passengers.  \"Look at him,\" the girl whispered to Thacher. \"How I hate those black uniforms!\"  \"He's just a Provincial Leiter,\" Thacher said. \"Don't worry.\"  The Leiter stood for a moment, his hands on his hips, looking around at them without expression. \"I have ordered your ship grounded so that an inspection can be made of all persons aboard,\" he said. \"You Terrans are the last to leave our planet. Most of you are ordinary and harmless-- I am not interested in you. I am interested in finding three saboteurs, three Terrans, two men and a woman, who have committed an incredible act of destruction and violence. They are said to have fled to this ship.\"  Murmurs of surprise and indignation broke out on all sides. The Leiter motioned the soldiers to follow him up the aisle.  \"Two hours ago a Martian city was destroyed. Nothing remains, only a depression in the sand where the city was. The city and all its people have completely vanished. An entire city destroyed in a second! Mars will never rest until the saboteurs are captured. And we know they are aboard this ship.\"  \"It's impossible,\" the heavy-set business man said. \"There aren't any saboteurs here.\"  \"We'll begin with you,\" the Leiter said to him, stepping up beside the man's seat. One of the soldiers passed the Leiter a square metal box. \"This will soon tell us if you're speaking the truth. Stand up. Get on your feet.\"  The man rose slowly, flushing. \"See here--\"  \"Are you involved in the destruction of the city? Answer!\"  The man swallowed angrily. \"I know nothing about any destruction of any city. And furthermore--\"  \"He is telling the truth,\" the metal box said tonelessly.  \"Next person.\" The Leiter moved down the aisle.  A thin, bald-headed man stood up nervously. \"No, sir,\" he said. \"I don't know a thing about it.\"  \"He is telling the truth,\" the box affirmed.  \"Next person! Stand up!\"  One person after another stood, answered, and sat down again in relief. At last there were only a few people left who had not been questioned. The Leiter paused, studying them intently.  \"Only five left. The three must be among you. We have narrowed it down.\" His hand moved to his belt. Something flashed, a rod of pale fire. He raised the rod, pointing it steadily at the five people. \"All right, the first one of you. What do you know about this destruction? Are you involved with the destruction of our city?\"  \"No, not at all,\" the man murmured.  \"Yes, he's telling the truth,\" the box intoned.  \"Next!\"  \"Nothing-- I know nothing. I had nothing to do with it.\"  \"True,\" the box said.  The ship was silent. Three people remained, a middle-aged man and his wife and their son, a boy of about twelve. They stood in the corner, staring white-faced at the Leiter, at the rod in his dark fingers.  \"It must be you,\" the Leiter grated, moving toward them. The Martian soldiers raised their guns. \"It _must_ be you. You there, the boy. What do you know about the destruction of our city? Answer!\"  The boy shook his head. \"Nothing,\" he whispered.  The box was silent for a moment. \"He is telling the truth,\" it said reluctantly.  \"Next!\"  \"Nothing,\" the woman muttered. \"Nothing.\"  \"The truth.\"  \"Next!\"  \"I had nothing to do with blowing up your city,\" the man said. \"You're wasting your time.\"  \"It is the truth,\" the box said.  For a long time the Leiter stood, toying with his rod. At last he pushed it back in his belt and signalled the soldiers toward the exit lock.  \"You may proceed on your trip,\" he said. He walked after the soldiers. At the hatch he stopped, looking back at the passengers, his face grim. \"You may go-- But Mars will not allow her enemies to escape. The three saboteurs will be caught, I promise you.\" He rubbed his dark jaw thoughtfully. \"It is strange. I was certain they were on this ship.\"  Again he looked coldly around at the Terrans.  \"Perhaps I was wrong. All right, proceed! But remember: the three will be caught, even if it takes endless years. Mars will catch them and punish them! I swear it!\"         *       *       *       *       *  For a long time no one spoke. The ship lumbered through space again, its jets firing evenly, calmly, moving the passengers toward their own planet, toward home. Behind them Deimos and the red ball that was Mars dropped farther and farther away each moment, disappearing and fading into the distance.  A sigh of relief passed through the passengers. \"What a lot of hot air that was,\" one grumbled.  \"Barbarians!\" a woman said.  A few of them stood up, moving out into the aisle, toward the lounge and the cocktail bar. Beside Thacher the girl got to her feet, pulling her jacket around her shoulders.  \"Pardon me,\" she said, stepping past him.  \"Going to the bar?\" Thacher said. \"Mind if I come along?\"  \"I suppose not.\"  They followed the others into the lounge, walking together up the aisle. \"You know,\" Thacher said, \"I don't even know your name, yet.\"  \"My name is Mara Gordon.\"  \"Mara? That's a nice name. What part of Terra are you from? North America? New York?\"  \"I've been in New York,\" Mara said. \"New York is very lovely.\" She was slender and pretty, with a cloud of dark hair tumbling down her neck, against her leather jacket.  They entered the lounge and stood undecided.  \"Let's sit at a table,\" Mara said, looking around at the people at the bar, mostly men. \"Perhaps that table over there.\"  \"But someone's there already,\" Thacher said. The heavy-set business man had sat down at the table and deposited his sample case on the floor. \"Do we want to sit with _him_?\"  \"Oh, it's all right,\" Mara said, crossing to the table. \"May we sit here?\" she said to the man.  The man looked up, half-rising. \"It's a pleasure,\" he murmured. He studied Thacher intently. \"However, a friend of mine will be joining me in a moment.\"  \"I'm sure there's room enough for us all,\" Mara said. She seated herself and Thacher helped her with her chair. He sat down, too, glancing up suddenly at Mara and the business man. They were looking at each other almost as if something had passed between them. The man was middle-aged, with a florid face and tired, grey eyes. His hands were mottled"]]]
