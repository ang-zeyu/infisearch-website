As the boy wonderingly obeyed, the Rangers and their guests closed about the stand and hemmed it in on all sides. Captain Hubbard had taken up a position there, and when Rodney halted in front of him and took off his cap, the latter began a speech, thanking the young sergeant for what he had done for the company, and begging him to accept a small token of their respect and esteem.  \"Take it, friend Rodney,\" said the captain, in conclusion. \"Keep it to remind you of the pure gold of our friendship which shall never know alloy. And while we sincerely trust that it may never be drawn except upon peaceful occasions of ceremony, we are sure you will not permit it to remain idle in its scabbard while the flag of our Young Republic is in danger, or your good right arm retains the power to wield it.\"  The captain stepped back, and the thoroughly astonished Rodney stood holding in his hands an elegant cavalry sabre. He stared hard at it, and then he looked at the expectant crowd around the band-stand.  \"Speech, speech!\" yelled the Rangers.  But the usually self-possessed Barrington boy was past speech-making now. He managed to mumble a few words of thanks, got to the ground somehow and mingled with the crowd as quickly as possible.  \"How very surprised he is,\" sneered Tom Randolph, who told himself regretfully that a sword like that might have been presented to him if he had only remained with the company. \"I will bet my horse against his that he knew a week ago that he was going to get it.\"  Rodney waited four days before he received a reply to the dispatch he sent to Dick Graham's father, and seeing that the authorities had assumed control of the wires, and the operator at Mooreville was a government spy, it was rather singular that he got it at all. It ran as follows:  \"Price will accept. Company officers and independent organization to remain the same.\"  \"I tell you Missouri is the best State yet,\" said Rodney, handing the telegram over to Captain Hubbard. \"This brings the matter squarely home to the boys, and they've got to decide upon something this very night.\"  And they did, but it was only after a stormy and even heated discussion. The captain and Rodney carried their point but it was by a very small majority of votes; and the former, believing it advisable to strike while the iron was hot, took one of his lieutenants and started for New Orleans to engage passage for his company to Little Rock. It was at this juncture that Rodney wrote that letter to his cousin Marcy Gray, a portion of which we gave to the reader in the first volume of this series. You will remember that he spoke with enthusiasm of the \"high old times\" he expected to have \"running the Yankees out of Missouri.\" Well, he had all the opportunities he wanted, but they were not brought about just as he thought they were going to be.  The captain and his lieutenant were gone two days, and came back to report that the steamers were all so busy with government business that it would be a week or more before they could get transportation; but the captain had left instructions with his cotton-factor who would keep his eyes open, and telegraph him when to expect a boat at Baton Rouge landing. In the meantime the harder they worked the less they would have to learn when they reached the Army of the West. That very afternoon they had a great surprise. The Rangers were going through a mounted drill, acquitting themselves very creditably they thought, when some one in the ranks became aware that they had a distinguished visitor in the person of the Governor of the State, who sat in a carriage looking on. Beside him was a little, dried-up, cross-looking man in fatigue cap and soiled linen duster, who kept making loud and unfavorable comments upon the drill, although he did not look as though he knew anything about it. As soon as Captain Hubbard learned that the Governor was among the spectators, he brought the Rangers into line and rode up to the carriage and saluted.  \"Well, captain,\" said the Governor, nodding in response to the salute. \"I am glad to see that you are hard at work and that your men are rapidly improving. Have you a copy of your muster-roll handy?\"  The captain replied that he had and the Governor continued--  \"Then be good enough to produce it and hand it to this officer who will muster you in. I am not going to let such a body of men as you are go out of the State if I can help it.\"  \"Shall I dismount the men, sir?\" asked the captain, addressing the cross-looking little man, who arose to his feet and shook himself together as if he were getting ready for business.  \"No,\" was the surly reply. \"We'll drive up in front of the company and I can call the roll while standing in the carriage. It'll not take ten minutes and then you can go on with your drill. I see you need it bad enough.\"  Captain Hubbard, who was so angry that he forgot to salute, wheeled his horse and rode back to the company.  \"Orderly,\" said he, in an undertone. \"Get a copy of your muster-roll and give it to that old curmudgeon in the carriage. He's going to try to muster us in but I doubt if he knows enough. I am glad to see him, however, for when he gets through with us, we shall know right where we stand.\"                                   CHAPTER IV.                        A SCHEME THAT DIDN'T WORK.  \"Say,\" exclaimed Rodney Gray excitedly, as Captain Hubbard took his place on the right of the company and the orderly galloped off to his tent. \"Who is that old party in the Governor's carriage?\"  \"You can't prove it by me,\" answered the captain. \"I never saw him before, but I know he's a mighty cross-grained old chap.\"  \"May I leave the ranks a minute?\" continued Rodney.  \"Of course not. What would the Governor think?\"  \"I don't care a picayune what he thinks,\" replied Rodney, his excitement increasing as the Governor's carriage began to circle around toward the front and center of the company. \"If that man in the fatigue cap and duster isn't General Lacey, all the descriptions I have heard of him are very much at fault.\"  \"And do you really believe,\" began the captain, who was profoundly astonished.  \"I don't believe, I know that he means to muster us into the Confederate service,\" interrupted Rodney. \"Hold on a minute before you do a thing or let a man answer to his name. My father knows him by sight.\"  Without again asking permission to leave his place, Rodney put his horse in motion and rode over to the tree under whose friendly shade Mr. Gray was sitting while he watched the drill.  \"Father,\" said he, speaking rapidly and panting as if he had been running instead of riding, \"who is that in the carriage with the Governor? Is it General Lacey?\"  Mr. Gray nodded and looked up at his son as if to ask him what he was going to do about it.  \"Well, he has come here to muster us in, and the orderly has gone after the roll-book,\" continued Rodney. \"The general is a Confederate officer, and if we let him muster us in, he will make Confederate soldiers of us, won't he?\"  \"That's the way it looks from where I sit,\" answered Mr. Gray.  \"It's the way it looks from where I sit too, and I just won't have any such trick played upon me,\" said Rodney, hotly. \"I know what I want and what I want to do; and as long as I am a free man, nobody shall make me do anything else.\"  \"Are you going to back out?\"  \"I am. I'll not answer to my name when it is called. I'll go back and put the other fellows on their guard, and then I'll fall out.\"  So saying Rodney wheeled his horse and returned to his company, which he found in a state of great excitement. The ranks were kept pretty well aligned (the horses knew enough to look out for that now), but the men were twisting about in their saddles, each one comparing notes with every one else whose ears he could reach. When Rodney rode up they all turned to look at him and listen to his report, regardless of the fact that the little man in the brown ulster was standing up in the Governor's carriage shouting \"Attention!\" at the top of his wheezy little voice.  \"Mind what you are doing, boys,\" said Rodney, as he rode slowly along the line behind the rear rank. \"That's General Lacey. Don't answer to your names unless you want to be sworn into the Confederate service.\"  \"But what shall we do?\" inquired one or two of the timid members, who thought they might be obliged to answer whether they wanted to or not.  \"Keep mum and say nothing,\" replied Rodney. \"Watch me and do as I do. My name is second on the roll.\"  \"Are you ever going to come to attention so that I can get through with my business and go back where I belong?\" yelled the general, as soon as he could make himself heard. \"A pretty lot of soldiers you are; but I warn you that you will have to mind better than this when you reach the camp of instruction, to which I shall immediately order you. Attention to roll-call! George Warren!\"  \"He--er--here!\" replied the orderly, hesitatingly.  The Rangers were amazed, and Captain Hubbard glared at the frightened sergeant as though he had half a mind to knock him out of his saddle. The captain had told the man in the most emphatic language not to answer to his name, and yet he had gone and given away his liberty for the next twelve months. It served him right for being so stupid.  \"You blockheads don't seem to understand what I want and what I am trying to do,\" shouted the general, wrathfully. \"All you who volunteer for the Confederate service answer to your names, and speak up so that I can hear you. I hope that is sufficiently plain. _George Warren!_\"  The Rangers, one and all, drew a long breath of relief and felt like giving a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29300"],["title","Rodney, the Partisan (#8)"],["body","cheer. Their comrade had most unexpectedly been allowed a chance for escape, and he was sharp enough to take advantage of it. He kept his eyes straight to the front and said nothing. The general looked surprised, but as he was in a great hurry he passed on to the next.  \"Rodney Gray!\"  This time there was no mistaking the answer. The sergeant moved from his place on the left of the line, rode to the center of the company, came to a front and saluted. The general opened his lips to tell him that he needn't come to the front and center in order to answer to his name, but the Barrington boy was too quick for him.  \"General,\" said he, while all the Rangers strained their ears to catch his words. \"I am ready at any time to be sworn into the service of my State, but I do not wish to join the Confederate army. I am a Partisan Ranger.\"  \"A--a--_what?_\" vociferated the general, now thoroughly aroused. He was a Mexican veteran, a thorough soldier as well as a martinet, and he had never learned to recognize any organizations outside of the regular service.  \"A Partisan Ranger,\" repeated Rodney, who was neither embarrassed nor angered by the covert sneer contained in the general's words.  \"A Ranger!\" exclaimed the general, raising his hands in the air and turning his eyes toward the clouds. \"Shade of the great and good Washington! what are we coming to? A partisan! And are you all partisans?\"  \"Yes sir, we are; and until very recently we have been encouraged to believe that we could preserve our independent organization.\"  \"You were, eh? Then you had better organize yourselves into Home Guards at once and I will go back to New Orleans. Partisan Rangers!\" said the general, who seemed unable to get the obnoxious words out of his mind. \"There's your roll-book. Drive on, coachman.\"  The general flung the book on the ground at the feet of Rodney's horse, threw himself back in his seat and the carriage moved rapidly away. The Rangers sat motionless in their saddles until it passed through the gate and disappeared behind the trees in the grove, and then they turned and looked at one another.  \"We know where we stand now at all events,\" said Captain Hubbard, riding up in front of the line, and throwing his right leg over the horn of his saddle in a position most unbecoming a commanding officer. \"My commission will be taken from me, and you fellows will be reduced to plain, every-day citizens once more. We might as well quit this nonsense now, and I say, let's pack up and go home.\"  \"I'll go, but I'll not promise to stay there,\" said Rodney.  \"Where will you go?\"  \"Up to Missouri. I have set my heart on being a partisan, and if my own State won't take me, I have a perfect right to offer my valuable services to another. I shall start for Baton Rouge to-morrow, and I and my horse will take passage on the first St. Louis boat that comes along.\"  \"Hear, hear!\" shouted some of the. Rangers.  \"Let's go in a body,\" said one. \"We have the assurance that our services will be accepted, that the officers we have elected will be retained, that our plan of organization will not be interfered with, and what more could we ask for?\"  \"That won't suit me,\" another declared. \"I don't want to leave my State.\"  \"How are you going to help yourself?\" demanded Rodney. \"If you join the Confederate army you are liable to be ordered up to Virginia or down to Florida. And you know as well as I do what the people around here will think of you if you make up your mind to stay at home.\"  \"Let's take the sense of the company on it,\" suggested Lieutenant Percy.  \"All right,\" answered the captain. \"Put the thing in the form of a motion and I will.\"  This was quickly done, and to Rodney's great disappointment, though not much to his surprise, the proposition was defeated by a large majority. The Rangers were opposed to deserting their State in a body and going into another.  \"I'll not stay at home, and that's all there is about it,\" said one of the Rangers who had voted with the minority. \"Does anybody here know what course we _do_ want to pursue? I have my doubts; and in order to test the matter I move you, Mr. Commander, that we offer ourselves as a company to the Confederate States.\"  The motion was received with such a howl of dissent that if there was a second to it the captain did not hear it. Some of the Rangers, to show what they thought of the proposition, backed their horses out of the ranks and rode away. Among them was Rodney, who returned to the tree under which his father was sitting.  \"Isn't it rather unusual for a cavalry company to hold a business meeting on horseback?\" inquired the latter, as the boy swung himself from his saddle. \"There seems to be a big difference of opinion among the members, and you look as though things hadn't gone to suit you. What have you decided to do?\"  \"Nothing as a company,\" replied Rodney. \"In fact we are not a company any longer. It is every one for himself now.\"  \"What do you mean by that? Have you disbanded?\"  Rodney explained the situation in a few words, adding that he thought he might as well be riding toward home so as to spend all the time he could with his mother, for he was going away bright and early on the following morning. Mr. Gray looked very sober and thoughtful when he heard these words.  \"I'd rather you would stay at home,\" said he.  \"And I would much prefer to stay, but I will not go into the service of the Confederacy. This State is an independent Commonwealth now, and is entitled to, and has a right to demand the best service I can give her; but who cares for the Confederacy? I think less of it than I did this morning, for one of its officers tried to rope us in without our consent.\"  That was Rodney's first experience with the duplicity and utter lack of fair dealing that characterized all the actions of the Confederate authorities, but it was by no means the last. We shall speak of this again when we see him coming down the Arkansas River, bound for the Army of the Center, a Confederate soldier in spite of himself.  Having given his comrades plenty of time to vote upon the last proposition submitted to them that they should offer themselves as a company to the Confederate States Rodney got upon his horse again and rode back to see if they had determined upon any particular course of action, but from all he could learn the matter was far from being settled. Some wanted to do one thing and some were in favor of doing another; but finding at last that they could not agree, they began drawing away by twos and threes, and finally Rodney Gray was left alone with the commissioned officers.  \"I am at my wit's end,\" declared Captain Hubbard, whose face wore a most dejected look. \"We don't want to remain at home, and neither do we desire to put ourselves under the control of such a man as General Lacey; but there's nothing else we can do, unless we go up to Missouri. Were you really in earnest when you said you intended to start oft tomorrow?\" he added, addressing himself to Rodney. \"Your decision was made on the spur of the moment, wasn't it?\"  \"Well, no. I made up my mind some time ago that there was going to be a hitch of some sort in our arrangements, and laid my plans accordingly.\"  \"How are you going to work it to reach Price's army?\" inquired Lieutenant Percy. \"Don't you know that there have been rioting and bloodshed in St. Louis, and that the Dutchmen have got control of the city?\"  \"Of course; but that's all over now. I shall telegraph to Dick Graham's father that I am coming, and trust to luck when I reach St. Louis. Perhaps he can make it convenient to meet me there; if not, I have a tongue in my head and a good horse to ride, and I have no fears but that I shall get through.\"  \"Well, I'll tell you what's a fact,\" said Lieutenant Odell. \"You can go alone for all of me. There's altogether too much danger in the step. You'll never get through the lines without a pass, and how are you going to get it? The first thing you know you will be arrested and shoved into jail.\"  \"I have thought of that,\" answered Rodney, calmly, \"but I'll take my chances on it. It's go there or stay home, and I have decided to go. Good-by, if I don't see you again, and if you hear any of the boys say that they would like to go with me, send them up to the house.\"  This was said in the most matter of fact way, as if Rodney were going to ride to Baton Rouge one day and come back the next; but they all knew that the parting was for a longer time than that, and each officer thrust his hand into his pocket to find something that would do for a keepsake. Odell handed over a big jack-knife with the remark that the sergeant might find it useful in cutting bacon or breaking up his hard-tack, so that he could crumb it into his coffee. Percy gave him a ring which he drew from his own finger, and the captain presented him with a twenty-dollar gold piece. Then they shook hands with him once more and saw him ride away.  \"It's like parting from a younger brother,\" said the captain, sorrowfully. \"I don't see how his father can let him go. But he's got nerve enough to carry him through any scrape he is likely to get into, and besides he is going among friends.\"  \"But he's got the enemy's lines to pass before he can get among friends, and that's one thing that worries me,\" observed the first lieutenant. \"What a determined fellow he is. He ought to make a good soldier.\"  \"Didn't I tell you that that company of Rangers would never amount to a row of pins?\" exclaimed Tom Randolph, when the members rode straggling into town that afternoon, and reported that their organization had been knocked into a cocked hat by General Lacey's attempt to muster it into the service of the Confederacy. \"I knew by the way the election went that it would bust up sooner or later, and I am heartily glad of it. Now they've got to go into the army, and if I get the second lieutenant's commission I am working for, perhaps I shall be placed over some of the"]]]
