If we can make plain to       our readers that man has lived in the world an extremely long       time, going back indeed to a former Geological age—that his first       state was very low and rude—that he has risen to his present high       estate by means of his own exertions continued through long       ages—and from this form a prophecy of a golden age to come in the       yet distant future, we shall feel that we have not written in       vain.

For a clear understanding of questions relating to early man, a       more or less extensive acquaintance with Geology is required.       This is by no means a difficult task to accomplish. What so       interesting as to understand at least the outlines of the history       of life on the globe? To see how, following a definite plan, the       vast continents have grown to their present size and form; to see       how animal and vegetable life have evolved successively higher       and higher forms; to see where in this wondrous drama of       creation, this strange unfolding of life, the first faint,       indecisive traces of man’s presence are to be found; to learn       what great changes in climate, in Geogony, and in life, had       occurred before man’s appearance, let us pass in brief review the       history of early geological periods.        As we have already stated, there must have been a very long       period of time during which no life was possible on the globe. Of       this era we know but little; for we find no strata of rocks of an       earlier date than we know life, in its simplest forms, to have       existed.2 Still we are not less confident of the existence of       this era, and the mind can dimly comprehend the scene, when a       nearly shoreless ocean surged around the globe.3        As to the extent of time during which there was no life, we have       no means of determining. That it was almost infinitely long is       made apparent by the researches of eminent scholars on the       cooling of lava. Toward the close of this extended period of time       faint traces of life appear. Not life as we are apt to think of       it. No nodding flowers were kissed by the sunshine of this early       time. The earliest forms of flowerless plants, such as sea-weeds,       and in dry places possibly lichens covering the rocks, were the       highest forms of vegetable life. Animal life, if present, for the       fact is denied by some, occurs in the very lowest form, merely       structureless bodies, with no especial organs of sense, or       nutrition: and their motion consisting simply in protruding and       withdrawing hair-like processes.4 Such was the beginning of life.       This vast period of time, which includes the beginning, is known       among geologists as Archean time.        From the close of this age, the history of life properly       commences. It might be well to explain the means which the       geologist uses to interpret the history of the globe. It is now       understood that the forces of nature have always produced the       same results as they do now. From the very earliest time to the       present, rocks have been forming. There, where conditions were       favorable, great beds of limestone, formed from shells and       corals, ground up by the action of the sea5—in other places,       massive beds of sandstone or of sand, afterward consolidated into       sandstone—were depositing. On the land surface, in places, great       beds of vegetable _débris_ were being converted into coal. Now we       can easily see how the remains of organic bodies, growing at the       time of the formation of these beds, should be preserved in a       fossil form. Limestone rocks are thickly studded in places with       all sorts of marine formations. Coal fields reveal wonders of       early vegetative growth. From sandstone rocks, and shaly beds, we       learn strange stories of animal life at the time they were       forming. From a careful study of these remains together with the       formation in which they occur, not only in one locality but all       over the earth, geologists have gradually unfolded the history of       life on the globe. It is admitted that, at best, our knowledge in       that direction is fragmentary. This arises from errors in       observation as well as that fossil formations are rare, or at       least localities where they are known to exist are but few. So       our knowledge of the past is as if we were examining some record       from which pages, chapters, and even volumes, have been       extracted.        Paleozoic Forest        In consequence of this imperfect record we can not, as yet, trace       a gradual successive growth from the low forms of animal and       plant life, that characterized the closing period of Archean       time, to the highly organized types of the present. The record       suddenly ceases and when we again pick up the thread we are       surrounded by more advanced types, higher forms of life. Though       we may hope that future discoveries will do much toward       completing the records, we can not hope that they will ever       really be perfected. So, from our present stand-point, the       history of life on the globe falls naturally into three great       divisions.6 This is no more than we might expect, when we reflect       that nature’s laws are universal in their action, and that the       world, as a whole, has been subjected to the same set of changes.        The period following on after Archean time is called, by       geologists, Paleozoic time.        During the long course of time embraced in this age, the forms of       life present wide differences from those of existing time.        This period produced the great beds of coal we use to-day. But       the vegetation of the coal period would present strange features       to our eyes. The vegetation commenced with the lowest orders of       flowerless plants, such as sea-weeds; but, before it was brought       to a close, there was a wonderful variety and richness of plants       of the flowerless or Cryptogamic division. In some of the warmest       portions of the globe, we have to-day tree-ferns growing four or       five feet high. During the closing part of the Paleozoic time,       there were growing all over the temperate zone great tree-ferns       thirty feet or so in height. Some varieties of rushes in our       marshes, a foot or two in height, had representatives in the       marshes of the coal period standing thirty feet high, and having       woody trunks.7 Near the close of the Paleozoic time, vegetation       assumed a higher form of life. Flowering plants are represented.       Pines were growing in the coal measures.        In animal life a similar advance is noted. The class of animals       having no backbone, or invertebrate animals, were largely       represented. But, toward the close of the Paleozoic time, we meet       with representatives of the backbone family. The waters swarmed       with fishes.8 Besides these, there were amphibians; 9 and       reptiles in the closing portions.10        The Pterodactyl        Thus we see what a great advance was made in life during this       period. The forms of life during the early stages of this age       were inferior in this, also, that they were all water species.11       But, before it closes, we have a rich and varied terrestrial       vegetation, and also air-breathing animals. The class Mammalia,       to which man belongs, had no representative on the earth during       the extended Paleozoic time.        We can easily see, from the foregoing, how appropriately this       period has been named that of old life forms. In imagination we       can recall a scene of this old age. The air is sultry and full of       vapors. The soil seems hot and steaming. This is a veritable       forest, but we see none of the beautiful flowers which we       associate with tropical vegetation to-day. In the branches of the       graceful tree-ferns, we will look in vain for birds. They were       yet far in the future. Neither were there any of the higher       orders of animals present. Not a single representative of the       great class of mammals enlivened the depths of the forest. There       were fishes in the waters, but not the fishes of to-day. Some       true reptiles and amphibians disported themselves in swampy       jungles, but they were unimportant. Almost the only sound to       break the stillness, was the hum of marsh-loving insects, the       whistling of the wind, and the roar of the tempests, which we may       well believe raged with the more than tropic severity of the       present.12        The time at last came for the dawning of a new era. Vast changes       had"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2873"],["title","The Prehistoric World; Or, Vanished Races (#6)"],["body","taking place in the geography of both continents. The       region to the south-west of the Green Mountains was upturned. The       Alleghany Mountains were formed, and the region east of the       Mississippi River became part of the stable land of the       continent.13 In Europe, nearly as great changes occurred. The       conditions of life must have been greatly modified by these       geographical changes. The life-forms bear testimony to this       changed condition. Old forms die away, and are succeeded by those       approaching more nearly our own times. The name of this period is       the Mesozoic time, or the period of middle life forms.14 It is       instructive to notice the steady advance in the type of life,       both animal and vegetable. The abundant flowerless vegetation of       the coal formation of the preceding epoch dwindles away. But the       flowering trees increase in number and importance until, in the       closing period of Mesozoic time, we have trees with deciduous       leaves. A great many of our forest trees had representatives in       the forests of that epoch.        Ichthyosauri        Palms and species like the big tree of California were growing       side by side with species akin to our own common trees. But in       the animal world there were many strange forms. This was the age       of reptiles. They domineered on the land, in the air, and in the       sea. On the land there stalked huge reptiles fifty and sixty feet       long, and, when standing erect, at least thirty feet high.15 Some       of these huge creatures were carnivorous, living on other       animals. Others fed on the foliage of trees. In the air, huge       reptilian bats, veritable flying dragons with a spread of wings       from ten to twenty feet, disported themselves.16 In the sea there       swam great reptilian whales, seals, and walruses.17 There was a       marvelous abundance of reptilian life. At the present day, there       are not more than six species of reptiles in the whole world       having a length of over fifteen feet, and not more than eighteen       species exceeding ten feet in length. But from one limited       locality, representing but one era of this age in England, there       have been discovered four or five species of carnivorous reptiles       twenty to fifty feet long, ten or twelve species of crocodiles,       lizards, and swimming reptiles from ten to sixty feet       long—besides multitudes of great flying reptiles and turtles.       Doubtless similar scenes of animal life were everywhere       represented.        The Labyrinthodon.        Birds made their first appearance during the Mesozoic time, and       here we obtain a clear view of nature’s methods of work. There is       no longer a doubt but that the first birds were simply modified       reptiles. The first bird had a long jointed tail, and a bill well       supplied with formidable teeth.18 It was during this period that       the first representative of the class Mammalia, to which man       belongs, appears.19 It is in the rocks of this era that we meet       with remains of marsupials, the order to which opossums belong.       This is the lowest of the Mammalian class. To the class Mammalia       belong the most highly organized animals. They have been the       ruling animals since the close of Mesozoic time. We must now       watch their development with especial care. For this brief       review, as far as it has gone, has shown a steady and gradual       progress in life forms, the lower invariably preceding the       higher. We therefore feel that it will be vain to seek for any       trace of man until we find undoubted proofs of the existence of       all the forms of animals below him. The last great division of       time is called Cenozoic.20 This means new life forms. In this       age, the forms of life are much nearer our own. As it was some       time during this epoch when man makes his appearance, we deem it       best to go into more detail, and give the subdivisions of this       period. It has been amply sufficient to give simply the outlines       of the other periods. In order to fix more clearly the sequence       of life, we will give an outline showing the periods we have       reviewed, and also the subdivisions of the Cenozoic time, which       we are now to examine with more care.          OUTLINE.            LIFE.           Archæan Time.           _The Beginning._ Includes the long lapse of time when the           globe could not support life, but towards its close faint           traces of life, both animal and vegetable appeared.            Paleozoic Time.           _The Period of Old Life Forms._ Forests of flowerless trees;           but pines grew in the coal measures. Animal life largely           invertebrate; but amphibians and reptiles among the           vertebrate appear at the close.            Mesozoic Time.           _The Period of Middle Life Forms._ Flowering trees increasing           in number and importance. Deciduous trees make their           appearance. Animal life largely reptilian. The class Mammalia           represented by marsupials.            Cenozoic Time.           _Tertiary,_ or Age of Mammals.           Eocene. Miocene. Pliocene.            _Quaternary,_ or Age of Man.           Glacial or Pleistocene. Recent.        At the close of the Mesozoic time, great elevations of land took       place in both America and Europe, especially in the northern       portions.21 This could not fail to have a great effect on life,       both animal and vegetable.        During the Eocene, or first division of the Tertiary Age, we have       simply to note the steady progress of life. There were forests of       species of oaks, poplars, maples, hickories, and other common       trees, and others now found only in tropical regions. Palm trees       were growing in the upper Missouri region of the United States.       And England was decidedly a land of Palms, as no less than       thirteen species are known to have been growing there. Cypresses,       yews, and pines graced the scene.22 Our special interest centers,       however, in the mammals of this epoch.        The Paleotherium.        In the preceding epoch marsupials only were represented. But in       beds of the middle and closing portions of the Eocene period we       meet with a sudden increase of Mammalian life. Whale-like animals       were especially abundant in the seas; and on our Western plains       were animals like the tapirs of India, and rhinoceros-like       animals as large as elephants23 but having no trunks, and       diminutive little animals not larger than foxes, from which have       come our horses. Europe also had a varied Mammalian fauna. There       were numerous hog-like animals. Animals, like the tapirs of       tropical Asia and America, wandered in the forests and on the       banks of the rivers. Herds of horse-like animals, about the size       of Shetland ponies, fed on the meadows.24 Animals that chew the       cud were present, or at least had near representatives.25        Among the flesh-eating animals were creatures resembling foxes,       wolverines, and hyenas.26 This shows what a great advance had       been made. But, besides all these, we are here presented with       representatives of the order of Quadrumana, or four-handed       animals. Several genera of lemurs are found in both America and       Europe.        Now the Quadrumana are the order below man. Therefore it seems       that in the Eocene period, all the forms of life _below_ man are       represented. The time seems to be at hand when we can look, with       some confidence, for traces of the presence of man himself. We       must therefore be more cautious in our investigations.        The epoch following on after the Eocene is designated as the       Miocene. We must remember that, though recent in a geological       sense, yet it is immensely remote when measured by the standard       of years. We must inquire into all the surroundings of this far       away time. The geographical features must have been widely       different from the present.        In the first place, the elevation of land to the north must have       been sufficient to have connected the land areas of the Northern       Hemisphere—North America, with Asia27 and Greenland; and this       latter country must have been united with Iceland, and, through       the British Islands, with Europe. But, to compensate for this       land mass to the north, large portions of Central and Southern       Europe were beneath the waves.28 The proof of this extended mass       of land is to be found in the wide distribution of similar       animals and plants in the Miocene time. All the chief botanists       are agreed that the north Polar region was the center from which       plants peculiar to the Eocene and Miocene epochs spread into both       Europe and America.29 We may mention that the famous big trees of       California are simply remnants of a wide-spread growth of these       trees in Miocene times. They can be found in a fossil state at       various places in British America, in Greenland, and in Europe.       They are supposed to have originated somewhere in the north, and       spread by these land connections we have mentioned into both       Europe and America. But this is not the only tree that grew in       the Miocene forests of both continents. The magnolia, tulip-tree,       and swamp cypress are other instances.30 Eleven species, growing       in the Rocky Mountain regions in Rocene times, found their way to       Europe in the Miocene times,31 driving before them the plants of       a tropical growth that had hitherto flourished in England. Now       this implies land connection between the two continents.       Furthermore, animals both large and small are found common to the       two countries.32 The "]]]
