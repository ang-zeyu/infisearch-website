(5) Ascertain the _Sign of Quantity_;  (6) Arrange in the following order:--      Sign of Quantity,     Subject,     Copula,     Predicate.      [Let us work a few Examples, to illustrate these Rules.       (1)      \"Some apples are not ripe.\"      (1) The Subject is \"apples.\"      (2) The Verb is \"are.\"      (3) The Predicate is \"not-ripe * * *.\" (As no Substantive is     expressed, and we have not yet settled what the Univ. is to be,     we are forced to leave a blank.)      (4) Let Univ. be \"fruit.\"      (5) The Sign of Quantity is \"some.\"      (6) The Proposition now becomes          \"Some | apples | are | not-ripe fruit.\"                                                                     pg014     (2)      \"None of my speculations have brought me as much as 5 per cent.\"      (1) The Subject is \"my speculations.\"      (2) The Verb is \"have brought,\" for which we substitute the     phrase \"are * * * that have brought\".      (3) The Predicate is \"* * * that have brought &c.\"      (4) Let Univ. be \"transactions.\"      (5) The Sign of Quantity is \"none of.\"      (6) The Proposition now becomes          \"None of | my speculations | are | transactions         that have brought me as much as 5 per cent.\"       (3)      \"None but the brave deserve the fair.\"      To begin with, we note that the phrase \"none but the brave\" is     equivalent to \"no _not_-brave.\"      (1) The Subject has for its _Attribute_ \"not-brave.\" But no     _Substantive_ is supplied. So we express the Subject as     \"not-brave * * *.\"      (2) The Verb is \"deserve,\" for which we substitute the phrase     \"are deserving of\".      (3) The Predicate is \"* * * deserving of the fair.\"      (4) Let Univ. be \"persons.\"      (5) The Sign of Quantity is \"no.\"      (6) The Proposition now becomes          \"No | not-brave persons | are | persons deserving         of the fair.\"       (4)      \"A lame puppy would not say \"thank you\" if you offered to lend     it a skipping-rope.\"      (1) The Subject is evidently \"lame puppies,\" and all the rest of     the sentence must somehow be packed into the Predicate.      (2) The Verb is \"would not say,\" &c., for which we may     substitute the phrase \"are not grateful for.\"      (3) The Predicate may be expressed as \"* * * not grateful for     the loan of a skipping-rope.\"      (4) Let Univ. be \"puppies.\"      (5) The Sign of Quantity is \"all.\"      (6) The Proposition now becomes          \"All | lame puppies | are | puppies not grateful         for the loan of a skipping-rope.\"                                                                     pg015     (5)      \"No one takes in the _Times_, unless he is well-educated.\"      (1) The Subject is evidently persons who are not well-educated     (\"no _one_\" evidently means \"no _person_\").      (2) The Verb is \"takes in,\" for which we may substitute the     phrase \"are persons taking in.\"      (3) The Predicate is \"persons taking in the _Times_.\"      (4) Let Univ. be \"persons.\"      (5) The Sign of Quantity is \"no.\"      (6) The Proposition now becomes          \"No | persons who are not well-educated | are |         persons taking in the _Times_.\"       (6)      \"My carriage will meet you at the station.\"      (1) The Subject is \"my carriage.\" This, being an 'Individual,'     is equivalent to the Class \"my carriages.\" (Note that this Class     contains only _one_ Member.)      (2) The Verb is \"will meet\", for which we may substitute the     phrase \"are * * * that will meet.\"      (3) The Predicate is \"* * * that will meet you at the station.\"      (4) Let Univ. be \"things.\"      (5) The Sign of Quantity is \"all.\"      (6) The Proposition now becomes          \"All | my carriages | are | things that will meet          you at the station.\"       (7)      \"Happy is the man who does not know what 'toothache' means!\"      (1) The Subject is evidently \"the man &c.\" (Note that in this     sentence, the _Predicate_ comes first.) At first sight, the     Subject seems to be an '_Individual_'; but on further     consideration, we see that the article \"the\" does _not_ imply     that there is only _one_ such man. Hence the phrase \"the man     who\" is equivalent to \"all men who\".      (2) The Verb is \"are.\"      (3) The Predicate is \"happy * * *.\"      (4) Let Univ. be \"men.\"      (5) The Sign of Quantity is \"all.\"      (6) The Proposition now becomes          \"All | men who do not know what 'toothache'         means | are | happy men.\"                                                                     pg016     (8)      \"Some farmers always grumble at the weather, whatever it may     be.\"      (1) The Subject is \"farmers.\"      (2) The Verb is \"grumble,\" for which we substitute the phrase     \"are * * * who grumble.\"      (3) The Predicate is \"* * * who always grumble &c.\"      (4) Let Univ. be \"persons.\"      (5) The Sign of Quantity is \"some.\"      (6) The Proposition now becomes          \"Some | farmers | are | persons who always         grumble at the weather, whatever it may be.\"       (9)      \"No lambs are accustomed to smoke cigars.\"      (1) The Subject is \"lambs.\"      (2) The Verb is \"are.\"      (3) The Predicate is \"* * * accustomed &c.\"      (4) Let Univ. be \"animals.\"      (5) The Sign of Quantity is \"no.\"      (6) The Proposition now becomes          \"No | lambs | are | animals accustomed to smoke         cigars.\"       (10)      \"I ca'n't understand examples that are not arranged in regular     order, like those I am used to.\"      (1) The Subject is \"examples that,\" &c.      (2) The Verb is \"I ca'n't understand,\" which we must alter, so     as to have \"examples,\" instead of \"I,\" as the nominative case.     It may be expressed as \"are not understood by me.\"      (3) The Predicate is \"* * * not understood by me.\"      (4) Let Univ. be \"examples.\"      (5) The Sign of Quantity is \"all.\"      (6) The Proposition now becomes          \"All | examples that are not arranged in regular         order like those I am used to | are | examples not         understood by me.\"]                                                                     pg017 § 3.  _A Proposition of Relation, beginning with \"All\", is a Double Proposition._  A Proposition of Relation, beginning with \"All\", asserts (as we already know) that \"_All_ Members of the Subject are Members of the Predicate\". This evidently contains, as a _part_ of what it tells us, the smaller Proposition \"_Some_ Members of the Subject are Members of the Predicate\".      [Thus, the Proposition \"_All_ bankers are rich men\" evidently     contains the smaller Proposition \"_Some_ bankers are rich men\".]  The question now arises \"What is the _rest_ of the information which this Proposition gives us?\"  In order to answer this question, let us begin with the smaller Proposition, \"_Some_ Members of the Subject are Members of the Predicate,\" and suppose that this is _all_ we have been told; and let us proceed to inquire what _else_ we need to be told, in order to know that \"_All_ Members of the Subject are Members of the Predicate\".      [Thus, we may suppose that the Proposition \"_Some_ bankers are     rich men\" is all the information we possess; and we may proceed     to inquire what _other_ Proposition needs to be added to it, in     order to make up the entire Proposition \"_All_ bankers are rich     men\".]  Let us also suppose that the 'Univ.' (i.e. the Genus, of which both the Subject and the Predicate are Specieses) has been divided (by the Process of _Dichotomy_) into two smaller Classes, viz.      (1) the Predicate;      (2) the Class whose Differentia is _contradictory_ to that of     the Predicate.      [Thus, we may suppose that the Genus \"men,\" (of which both     \"bankers\" and \"rich men\" are Specieses) has been divided into     the two smaller Classes, \"rich men\", \"poor men\".]                                                                    pg018 Now we know that _every_ Member of the Subject is (as shown at p. 6) a Member of the Univ. Hence _every_ Member of the Subject is either in Class (1) or else in Class (2).      [Thus, we know that _every_ banker is a Member of the Genus     \"men\". Hence, _every_ banker is either in the Class \"rich men\",     or else in the Class \"poor men\".]  Also we have been told that, in the case we are discussing, _some_ Members of the Subject are in Class (1). What _else_ do we need to be told, in order to know that _all_ of them are there? Evidently we need to be told that _none_ of them are in Class (2); i.e. that _none_ of them are Members of the Class whose Differentia is _contradictory_ to that of the Predicate.      [Thus, we may suppose we have been told that _some_ bankers are     in the Class \"rich men\". What _else_ do we need to be told, in     order to know that _all_ of them are there? Evidently we need to     be told that _none_ of them are in the Class \"_poor_ men\".]  Hence a Proposition of Relation, beginning with \"All\", is a _Double_ Proposition, and is '=equivalent=' to (i.e. gives the same information as) the _two_ Propositions      (1) \"_Some_ Members of the Subject are Members of the     Predicate\";      (2) \"_No_ Members of the Subject are Members of the     Class whose Differentia is _contradictory_ to that of     the Predicate\".      [Thus, the Proposition \"_All_ bankers are rich men\" is a     _Double_ Proposition, and is equivalent to the _two_     Propositions          (1) \"_Some_ bankers"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28696"],["title","Symbolic Logic (#7)"],["body","rich men\";          (2) \"_No_ bankers are _poor_ men\".]                                                                     pg019 § 4.  _What is implied, in a Proposition of Relation, as to the Reality of its Terms?_  Note that the rules, here laid down, are _arbitrary_, and only apply to Part I of my \"Symbolic Logic.\"  A Proposition of Relation, beginning with \"Some\", is henceforward to be understood as asserting that there are _some existing Things_, which, being Members of the Subject, are also Members of the Predicate; i.e. that _some existing Things_ are Members of _both_ Terms at once. Hence it is to be understood as implying that _each_ Term, taken by itself, is _Real_.      [Thus, the Proposition \"Some rich men are invalids\" is to be     understood as asserting that _some existing Things_ are \"rich     invalids\". Hence it implies that _each_ of the two Classes,     \"rich men\" and \"invalids\", taken by itself, is _Real_.]  A Proposition of Relation, beginning with \"No\", is henceforward to be understood as asserting that there are _no existing Things_ which, being Members of the Subject, are also Members of the Predicate; i.e. that _no existing Things_ are Members of _both_ Terms at once. But this implies nothing as to the _Reality_ of either Term taken by itself.      [Thus, the Proposition \"No mermaids are milliners\" is to be     understood as asserting that _no existing Things_ are     \"mermaid-milliners\". But this implies nothing as to the     _Reality_, or the _Unreality_, of either of the two Classes,     \"mermaids\" and \"milliners\", taken by itself. In this case as it     happens, the Subject is _Imaginary_, and the Predicate _Real_.]  A Proposition of Relation, beginning with \"All\", contains (see § 3) a similar Proposition beginning with \"Some\". Hence it is to be understood as implying that _each_ Term, taken by itself, is _Real_.      [Thus, the Proposition \"All hyænas are savage animals\" contains     the Proposition \"Some hyænas are savage animals\". Hence it     implies that _each_ of the two Classes, \"hyænas\" and \"savage     animals\", taken by itself, is _Real_.]                                                                     pg020 § 5.  _Translation of a Proposition of Relation into one or more Propositions of Existence._  We have seen that a Proposition of Relation, beginning with \"Some,\" asserts that _some existing Things_, being Members of its Subject, are _also_ Members of its Predicate. Hence, it asserts that some existing Things are Members of _both_; i.e. it asserts that some existing Things are Members of the Class of Things which have _all_ the Attributes of the Subject and the Predicate.  Hence, to translate it into a Proposition of Existence, we take \"existing Things\" as the new _Subject_, and Things, which have _all_ the Attributes of the Subject and the Predicate, as the new Predicate.  Similarly for a Proposition of Relation beginning with \"No\".  A Proposition of Relation, beginning with \"All\", is (as shown in § 3) equivalent to _two_ Propositions, one beginning with \"Some\" and the other with \"No\", each of which we now know how to translate.      [Let us work a few Examples, to illustrate these Rules.      (1)          \"Some apples are not ripe.\"      Here we arrange thus:--          \"Some\"                     _Sign of Quantity_.         \"existing Things\"          _Subject_.         \"are\"                      _Copula_.         \"not-ripe apples\"          _Predicate_.      or thus:--          \"Some | existing Things | are | not-ripe apples.\"                                                                    pg021     (2)          \"Some farmers always grumble at the weather, whatever         it may be.\"      Here we arrange thus:--          \"Some | existing Things | are | farmers who always         grumble at the weather, whatever it may be.\"      (3)          \"No lambs are accustomed to smoke cigars.\"      Here we arrange thus:--          \"No | existing Things |are | lambs accustomed to         smoke cigars.\"      (4)          \"None of my speculations have brought me as much         as 5 per cent.\"      Here we arrange thus:--          \"No | existing Things | are | speculations of mine,         which have brought me as much as 5 per cent.\"      (5)          \"None but the brave deserve the fair.\"      Here we note, to begin with, that the phrase \"none but the     brave\" is equivalent to \"no not-brave men.\" We then arrange     thus:--          \"No | existing Things | are | not-brave men deserving         of the fair.\"      (6)          \"All bankers are rich men.\"      This is equivalent to the two Propositions \"Some bankers are     rich men\" and \"No bankers are poor men.\"      Here we arrange thus:--          \"Some | existing Things | are | rich bankers\";             and         \"No | existing Things | are | poor bankers.\"]       [Work Examples § =1=, 1-4 (p. 97).]                                                                     pg022   BOOK III.

[For example, we might say \"Let Univ. be 'books'\"; and we might     imagine the Diagram to be a large table, assigned to all     \"books.\"]      [The Reader is strongly advised, in reading this Chapter, _not_     to refer to the above Diagram, but to draw a large one for     himself, _without any letters_, and to have it by him while he     reads, and keep his finger on that particular _part_ of it,     about which he is reading.]                                                                    pg023 Secondly, let us suppose that we have selected a certain Adjunct, which we may call \"x,\" and have divided the large Class, to which we have assigned the whole Diagram, into the two smaller Classes whose Differentiæ are \"x\" and \"not-x\" (which we may call \"x'\"), and that we have assigned the _North_ Half of the Diagram to the one (which we may call \"the Class of x-Things,\" or \"the x-Class\"), and the _South_ Half to the other (which we may call \"the Class of x'-Things,\" or \"the x'-Class\").      [For example, we might say \"Let x mean 'old,' so that x' will     mean 'new',\" and we might suppose that we had divided books into     the two Classes whose Differentiæ are \"old\" and \"new,\" and had     assigned the _North_ Half of the table to \"_old_ books\" and the     _South_ Half to \"_new_ books.\"]  Thirdly, let us suppose that we have selected another Adjunct, which we may call \"y\", and have subdivided the x-Class into the two Classes whose Differentiæ are \"y\" and \"y'\", and that we have assigned the North-_West_ Cell to the one (which we may call \"the xy-Class\"), and the North-_East_ Cell to the other (which we may call \"the xy'-Class\").      [For example, we might say \"Let y mean 'English,' so that y'     will mean 'foreign'\", and we might suppose that we had     subdivided \"old books\" into the two Classes whose Differentiæ     are \"English\" and \"foreign\", and had assigned the North-_West_     Cell to \"old _English_ books\", and the North-_East_ Cell to \"old     _foreign_ books.\"]  Fourthly, let us suppose that we have subdivided the x'-Class in the same manner, and have assigned the South-_West_ Cell to the x'y-Class, and the South-_East_ Cell to the x'y'-Class.      [For example, we might suppose that we had subdivided \"new     books\" into the two Classes \"new _English_ books\" and \"new     _foreign_ books\", and had assigned the South-_West_ Cell to the     one, and the South-_East_ Cell to the other.]  It is evident that, if we had begun by dividing for y and y', and had then subdivided for x and x', we should have got the _same_ four Classes. Hence we see that we have assigned the _West_ Half to the y-Class, and the _East_ Half to the y'-Class.                                                                    pg024     [Thus, in the above Example, we should find that we had assigned     the _West_ Half of the table to \"_English_ books\" and the _East_     Half to \"_foreign_ books.\"          ·-------------------·         |   old   |   old   |         | English | foreign |         |  books  |  books  |         |---------|---------|         |   new   |   new   |         | English | foreign |         |  books  |  books  |         ·-------------------·      We have, in fact, assigned the four Quarters of the table to     four different Classes of books, as here shown.]  The Reader should carefully remember that, in such a phrase as \"the x-Things,\" the word \"Things\" means that particular _kind_ of Things, to which the whole Diagram has been assigned.      [Thus, if we say \"Let Univ. be 'books',\" we mean that we have     assigned the whole Diagram to \"books.\" In that case, if we took     \"x\" to mean \"old\", the phrase \"the x-Things\" would mean \"the old     books.\"]  The Reader should not go on to the next Chapter until he is _quite familiar_ with the _blank_ Diagram I have advised him to draw.  He ought to be able to name, _instantly_, the _Adjunct_ assigned to any Compartment named in the right-hand column of the following Table.  Also he ought to be able to name, _instantly_, the _Compartment_ assigned to any Adjunct named in the left-hand column.  To make sure of this, he had better put the book into the hands of some genial friend, while he himself has nothing but the blank Diagram, and get that genial friend to question him on this Table, _dodging_ about as much as possible. The Questions and Answers should be something like this:--                                                                     pg025                      TABLE I.      ·----------------------------------------·     | _Adjuncts_ | _Compartments,"]]]
