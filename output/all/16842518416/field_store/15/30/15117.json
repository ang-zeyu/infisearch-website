If it's not     a new wrinkle in nuclear fission, it's a gun to shoot around corners     and down winding staircases. Or maybe a nice new strain of bacteria     guaranteed to give you radio-active dandruff. Our own suggestion is     to pipe a few of our television commercials into Russia and bore the     enemy to death._      _Well, it seems that Ivar Jorgensen has hit on the ultimate engine     of destruction: a weapon designed to exploit man's greatest     weakness. The blueprint can be found in the next few pages; and as     the soldier in the story says, our only hope is to keep a sense of     humor!_   Me? I'm looking for my outfit. Got cut off in that Holland Tunnel attack. Mind if I sit down with you guys a while? Thanks. Coffee? Damn! This is heaven. Ain't seen a cup of coffee in a year.  What? You said it! This sure is a hell of a war. Tough on a guy's feet. Yeah, that's right. Holland Tunnel skirmish. Where the Ruskies used that new gun. Uhuh. God! It was awful. Guys popping off all around a guy and him not knowing why. No sense to it. No noise. No wound. Just popping off.  That's the trouble with this war. It won't settle down to a routine. Always something new. What the hell chance has a guy got to figure things out? And I tell you them Ruskies are coming up with new weapons just as fast as we are. Enough to make your hair stand on end.  Sugar? Christ, yes! Ain't seen sugar for a year. You see, it's like this: we were bottled up in the pits around the Tunnel for seven damn days. It was like nothing you ever saw before. Oops--sorry. Didn't mean to splash you. I was laughing about something that happened there--to a guy. Maybe you guys would get a kick out of it. After all, we got to keep our sense of humor.  You see, there was me and a Kentucky kid named Stillwell in this pit--a pretty big pit with lots of room--and we were all alone. This Stillwell was a nice kid--green and lonesome and it's pretty sad, really, but there's a yak in it, and--as I say--we got to keep a sense of humor.  Well, this Stillwell--a really green kid--is unhappy and just plain drooling for his gal back home. He talks about his mother, of course, and his old man, but it's the girl that's really on his mind as you guys can plainly understand.  He's seeing her every place--like spots in front of his eyes--nice spots doing things to him, when this Ruskie babe shows up.  My gun came up without any orders from me just as she poked her puss over the edge of the pit, and--huh? Oh, thank you kindly. It sure tastes good but I don't want to short you guys. Thank you kindly.  Well, as I was saying, this Ruskie babe pokes her nose over the edge of the pit and Stillwell dives and knocks down my gun. He says, \"You son-of-a-bitch!\" Just like that. Wild and desperate, like you'd say to a guy if the guy was just kicking over the last jug of water on a desert island.  It would have been long enough for her to kill us if I hadn't had good reflexes. Even then, all I had time to do was knock the pistol out of her hand and drag her into the pit.  With her play bollixed, she was confused and bewildered. She ain't a fighter, and she sits back against the wall staring at us dead pan with big expressionless eyes. She's a plenty pretty babe and I could see exactly what had happened as far as Stillwell was concerned. His spots had come to life in very adequate form so to speak.         *       *       *       *       *  Stillwell goes over and sits down beside her and I'm very much on the alert, because I know where his courage comes from. But I decide it's all right, because I see the babe is not belligerent, just confused kind of. And friendly.  And willing. Kind of a whipped-little-dog willing, and man oh man! She was sure what Stillwell needed.  They kind of went together like a hand and a glove--natural-like. And it followed--pretty natural--that when Stillwell got up and led her around a wing of the pit, out of sight, she went willing--like that same little dog.  Uhuh. No, you guys. Two's enough. I wouldn't rob you. Well, okay, and thanks kindly.  Well, there I was, all alone, but happy for Stillwell, cause I know it's what the kid needs, and in spots like that what difference does it make? Yank--Ruskie--Mongolian--as long as she's willing.  Then, you guys, Stillwell comes back out--wall-eyed--real wall-eyed--like being hit but not knocked out and still walking. I know what it is--some kind of shock. I get up and walk over and take a look at the babe where he'd left her--and I bust out laughing. I told you guys there was a yak in this. I laughed like a fool--it was that funny. As much as I had time to, before Stillwell cracked. It was enough to crack him--the little thing that pushes a guy over the edge.  He lets out a yell and screams, \"For crisake! For crisake! Nothing but a bucket of bolts! Nothing but a couple of plastic lumps--\"  That was when I hit him. I had to. He was for the birds, Stillwell was. An hour later we got relieved and a couple of medicos carried him away strapped to a stretcher--gone like a kite.  They took the robot too, and its clothes, but they forgot the brassiere, so I took it and I been carrying it ever since, but I'll leave it with you guys if you want--for the coffee. Might make you think about home. After all, like the man says, we got to keep our sense of humor.  Well, so long, you guys--and thanks.

Philip Dick used that idea for     this brief fantasy tale. We're sure that after reading it you'll     give cuckoo clocks more respect._    beyond     the    door   _by ... Philip K. Dick_    Larry Thomas bought a cuckoo clock  for his wife--without knowing the  price he would have to pay.   That night at the dinner table he brought it out and set it down beside her plate. Doris stared at it, her hand to her mouth. \"My God, what is it?\" She looked up at him, bright-eyed.  \"Well, open it.\"  Doris tore the ribbon and paper from the square package with her sharp nails, her bosom rising and falling. Larry stood watching her as she lifted the lid. He lit a cigarette and leaned against the wall.  \"A cuckoo clock!\" Doris cried. \"A real old cuckoo clock like my mother had.\" She turned the clock over and over. \"Just like my mother had, when Pete was still alive.\" Her eyes sparkled with tears.  \"It's made in Germany,\" Larry said. After a moment he added, \"Carl got it for me wholesale. He knows some guy in the clock business. Otherwise I wouldn't have--\" He stopped.  Doris made a funny little sound.  \"I mean, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to afford it.\" He scowled. \"What's the matter with you? You've got your clock, haven't you? Isn't that what you want?\"  Doris sat holding onto the clock, her fingers pressed against the brown wood.  \"Well,\" Larry said, \"what's the matter?\"  He watched in amazement as she leaped up and ran from the room, still clutching the clock. He shook his head. \"Never satisfied. They're all that way. Never get enough.\"  He sat down at the table and finished his meal.  The cuckoo clock was not very large. It was hand-made, however, and there were countless frets on it, little indentations and ornaments scored in the soft wood. Doris sat on the bed drying her eyes and winding the clock. She set the hands by her wristwatch. Presently she carefully moved the hands to two minutes of ten. She carried the clock over to the dresser and propped it up.  Then she sat waiting, her hands twisted together in her lap--waiting for the cuckoo to come out, for the hour to strike.  As she sat she thought about Larry and what he had said. And what she had said, too, for that matter--not that she could be blamed for any of it. After all, she couldn't keep listening to him forever without defending herself; you had to blow your own trumpet in the world.  She touched her handkerchief to her eyes suddenly. Why did he have to say that, about getting it wholesale? Why did he have to spoil it all? If he felt that way he needn't have got it in the first place. She clenched her fists. He was so mean, so damn mean.  But she was glad of the little clock sitting there ticking to itself, with its funny grilled edges and the door. Inside the door was the cuckoo, waiting to come out. Was he listening, his head cocked on one side, listening to hear the clock strike so that he would know to come out?  Did he sleep between hours? Well, she would soon see him: she could ask him. And she would show the clock to Bob. He would love it; Bob loved old things, even old stamps and buttons. He liked to go with her to the stores. Of course, it was a little _awkward_, but Larry had been staying at the office so much, and that helped. If only Larry didn't call up sometimes to--  There was a whirr. The clock shuddered and all at once the door opened. The cuckoo came out, sliding swiftly. He paused and looked around solemnly, scrutinizing her, the room, the furniture.  It was the first time he had seen her, she realized, smiling to herself in pleasure. She stood up, coming toward him shyly. \"Go on,\" she said. \"I'm waiting.\"  The cuckoo opened his bill. He whirred and chirped, quickly, rhythmically. Then, after a moment of contemplation, he retired. And the door snapped shut.  She was delighted. She clapped her hands and spun in a little circle. He was marvelous, perfect! And the way he had looked around, studying her, sizing her up. He liked her; she was certain of it. And she, of course, loved him at once, completely. He was just what she had hoped would come out of the little door.  Doris went to the clock. She bent over the little door, her lips close to the wood. \"Do you hear me?\" she whispered. \"I think you're the most wonderful cuckoo in the world.\" She paused, embarrassed. \"I hope you'll like it here.\"  Then she went downstairs again, slowly, her head high.  Larry and the cuckoo clock really never got along well from the start. Doris said it was because he didn't wind it right, and it didn't like being only half-wound all the time. Larry turned the job of winding over to her; the cuckoo came out every quarter hour and ran the spring down without remorse, and someone had to be ever after it, winding it up again.  Doris did her best, but she forgot a good deal of the time. Then Larry would throw his newspaper down with an elaborate weary motion and stand up. He would go into the dining-room where the clock was mounted on the wall over the fireplace. He would take the clock down and making sure that he had his thumb over the little door, he would wind it up.  \"Why do you put your thumb over the door?\" Doris asked once.  \"You're supposed to.\"  She raised an eyebrow. \"Are you sure? I wonder if it isn't that you don't want him to come out while you're standing so close.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"Maybe you're afraid of him.\"  Larry laughed. He put the clock back on the wall and gingerly removed his thumb. When Doris wasn't looking he examined his thumb.  There was still a trace of the nick cut out of the soft part of it. Who--or what--had pecked at him?         *       *       *       *       *  One Saturday morning, when Larry was down at the office working over some important special accounts, Bob Chambers came to the front porch and rang the bell.  Doris was taking a quick shower. She dried herself and slipped into her robe. When she opened the door Bob stepped inside, grinning.  \"Hi,\" he said, looking around.  \"It's all right. Larry's at the office.\"  \"Fine.\" Bob gazed at her slim legs below the hem of the robe. \"How nice you look today.\"  She laughed. \"Be careful! Maybe I shouldn't let you in after all.\"  They looked at one another, half amused half frightened. Presently Bob said, \"If you want, I'll--\"  \"No, for God's sake.\" She caught hold of his sleeve. \"Just get out of the doorway so I can close it. Mrs. Peters across the street, you know.\"  She closed the door. \"And I want to show you something,\" she said. \"You haven't seen it.\"  He was interested. \"An antique? Or what?\"  She took his arm, leading him toward the dining-room. \"You'll love it, Bobby.\" She stopped, wide-eyed. \"I hope you will. You must; you must love it. It means so much to me--_he_ means so much.\"  \"He?\" Bob frowned. \"Who is he?\"  Doris laughed. \"You're jealous! Come on.\" A moment later they stood before the clock, looking up at it. \"He'll come out in a few minutes. Wait until you see him. I know you two will get along just fine.\"  \"What does Larry think of him?\"  \"They don't like each other. Sometimes when Larry's here he won't come out. Larry gets mad if he doesn't come out on time. He says--\"  \"Says what?\"  Doris looked down. \"He always says he's been robbed, even if he did get it wholesale.\" She brightened. \"But I know he won't come out because he doesn't like Larry. When I'm here alone he comes right out for me, every fifteen minutes, even though he really only has to come out on the hour.\"  She gazed up at the clock. \"He comes out for me because he wants to. We talk; I tell him things. Of course, I'd like to have him upstairs in my room, but it wouldn't be right.\"  There was the sound of footsteps on the front porch. They looked at each other, horrified.  Larry pushed the front door open, grunting. He set his briefcase down and took off his hat. Then he saw Bob for the first time.  \"Chambers. I'll be damned.\" His eyes narrowed. \"What are you doing here?\" He came into the dining-room. Doris drew her robe about her helplessly, backing away.  \"I--\" Bob began. \"That is, we--\" He broke off, glancing at Doris. Suddenly the clock began to whirr. The cuckoo came rushing out, bursting into sound. Larry moved toward him.  \"Shut that din off,\" he said. He raised his fist toward the clock. The cuckoo snapped into silence and retreated. The door closed. \"That's better.\" Larry studied Doris and Bob, standing mutely together.  \"I came over to look at the clock,\" Bob said. \"Doris told me that it's a rare antique and that--\"  \"Nuts. I bought it myself.\" Larry walked up to him. \"Get out of here.\" He turned to Doris. \"You too. And take that damn clock with you.\"  He paused, rubbing his chin. \"No. Leave the clock here. It's mine; I bought it and paid for it.\"  In the weeks that followed after Doris left, Larry and the cuckoo clock got along even worse than before. For one thing, the cuckoo stayed inside most of the time, sometimes even at twelve o'clock when he should have been busiest. And if he did come out at all he usually spoke only once or twice, never the correct number of times. And there was a sullen, uncooperative note in his voice, a jarring sound that made Larry uneasy and a little angry.  But he kept the clock wound, because the house was very still and quiet and it got on his nerves not to hear someone running around, talking and dropping things. And even the whirring of a clock sounded good to him.  But he didn't like the cuckoo at all. And sometimes he spoke to him.  \"Listen,\" he said late one night to the closed little door. \"I know you can hear me. I ought to give you back to the Germans--back to the Black Forest.\" He paced back and forth. \"I wonder what they're doing now, the two of them. That young punk with his books and his antiques. A man shouldn't be interested in antiques; that's for women.\""]]]
