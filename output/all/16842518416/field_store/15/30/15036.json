As Odin's characteristics, like the all-pervading elements, were multitudinous, so also were his names, of which he had no less than two hundred, almost all descriptive of some phase of his activities. He was considered the ancient god of seamen and of the wind.               \"Mighty Odin,       Norsemen hearts we bend to thee!     Steer our barks, all-potent Woden,       O'er the surging Baltic Sea.\"              Vail.    The Wild Hunt  Odin, as wind-god, was pictured as rushing through mid-air on his eight-footed steed, from which originated the oldest Northern riddle, which runs as follows: \"Who are the two who ride to the Thing? Three eyes have they together, ten feet, and one tail: and thus they travel through the lands.\" And as the souls of the dead were supposed to be wafted away on the wings of the storm, Odin was worshipped as the leader of all disembodied spirits. In this character he was most generally known as the Wild Huntsman, and when people heard the rush and roar of the wind they cried aloud in superstitious fear, fancying they heard and saw him ride past with his train, all mounted on snorting steeds, and accompanied by baying hounds. And the passing of the Wild Hunt, known as Woden's Hunt, the Raging Host, Gabriel's Hounds, or Asgardreia, was also considered a presage of such misfortune as pestilence or war.       \"The Rhine flows bright; but its waves ere long       Must hear a voice of war,     And a clash of spears our hills among,       And a trumpet from afar;     And the brave on a bloody turf must lie,     For the Huntsman hath gone by!\"              The Wild Huntsman (Mrs. Hemans).   It was further thought that if any were so sacrilegious as to join in the wild halloo in mockery, they would be immediately snatched up and whirled away with the vanishing host, while those who joined in the halloo with implicit good faith would be rewarded by the sudden gift of a horse's leg, hurled at them from above, which, if carefully kept until the morrow, would be changed into a lump of gold.  Even after the introduction of Christianity the ignorant Northern folk still dreaded the on-coming storm, declaring that it was the Wild Hunt sweeping across the sky.                       \"And ofttimes will start,     For overhead are sweeping Gabriel's hounds,         Doomed with their impious lord the flying hart     To chase forever on aëreal grounds.\"              Sonnet (Wordsworth).   Sometimes it left behind a small black dog, which, cowering and whining upon a neighbouring hearth, had to be kept for a whole year and carefully tended unless it could be exorcised or frightened away. The usual recipe, the same as for the riddance of changelings, was to brew beer in egg-shells, and this performance was supposed so to startle the spectral dog that he would fly with his tail between his legs, exclaiming that, although as old as the Behmer, or Bohemian forest, he had never before beheld such an uncanny sight.       \"I am as old     As the Behmer wold,     And have in my life     Such a brewing not seen.\"              Old Saying (Thorpe's tr.)   The object of this phantom hunt varied greatly, and was either a visonary boar or wild horse, white-breasted maidens who were caught and borne away bound only once in seven years, or the wood nymphs, called Moss Maidens, who were thought to represent the autumn leaves torn from the trees and whirled away by the wintry gale.  In the middle ages, when the belief in the old heathen deities was partly forgotten, the leader of the Wild Hunt was no longer Odin, but Charlemagne, Frederick Barbarossa, King Arthur, or some Sabbath-breaker, like the Squire of Rodenstein or Hans von Hackelberg, who, in punishment for his sins, was condemned to hunt for ever through the realms of air.  As the winds blew fiercest in autumn and winter, Odin was supposed to prefer hunting during that season, especially during the time between Christmas and Twelfth-night, and the peasants were always careful to leave the last sheaf or measure of grain out in the fields to serve as food for his horse.  This hunt was of course known by various names in the different countries of Northern Europe; but as the tales told about it are all alike, they evidently originated in the same old heathen belief, and to this day ignorant people of the North fancy that the baying of a hound on a stormy night is an infallible presage of death.       \"Still, still shall last the dreadful chase,       Till time itself shall have an end;     By day, they scour earth's cavern'd space,       At midnight's witching hour, ascend.      \"This is the horn, and hound, and horse       That oft the lated peasant hears;     Appall'd, he signs the frequent cross,       When the wild din invades his ears.      \"The wakeful priest oft drops a tear       For human pride, for human woe,     When, at his midnight mass, he hears       The infernal cry of 'Holla, ho!'\"              Sir Walter Scott.   The Wild Hunt, or Raging Host of Germany, was called Herlathing in England, from the mythical king Herla, its supposed leader; in Northern France it bore the name of Mesnée d'Hellequin, from Hel, goddess of death; and in the middle ages it was known as Cain's Hunt or Herod's Hunt, these latter names being given because the leaders were supposed to be unable to find rest on account of the iniquitous murders of Abel, of John the Baptist, and of the Holy Innocents.  In Central France the Wild Huntsman, whom we have already seen in other countries as Odin, Charlemagne, Barbarossa, Rodenstein, von Hackelberg, King Arthur, Hel, one of the Swedish kings, Gabriel, Cain, or Herod, is also called the Great Huntsman of Fontainebleau (le Grand Veneur de Fontainebleau), and people declare that on the eve of Henry IV.'s murder, and also just before the outbreak of the great French Revolution, his shouts were distinctly heard as he swept across the sky.  It was generally believed among the Northern nations that the soul escaped from the body in the shape of a mouse, which crept out of a corpse's mouth and ran away, and it was also said to creep in and out of the mouths of people in a trance. While the soul was absent, no effort or remedy could recall the patient to life; but as soon as it had come back animation returned.    The Pied Piper  As Odin was the leader of all disembodied spirits, he was identified in the middle ages with the Pied Piper of Hamelin. According to mediæval legends, Hamelin was so infested by rats that life became unbearable, and a large reward was offered to any who would rid the town of these rodents. A piper, in parti-coloured garments, offered to undertake the commission, and the terms being accepted, he commenced to play through the streets in such wise that, one and all, the rats were beguiled out of their holes until they formed a vast procession. There was that in the strains which compelled them to follow, until at last the river Weser was reached, and all were drowned in its tide.       \"And ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered,     You heard as if an army muttered;     And the muttering grew to a grumbling;     And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling;     And out of the houses the rats came tumbling.     Great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats,     Brown rats, black rats, grey rats, tawny rats,     Grave old plodders, gay young friskers,       Fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins,     Cocking tails and pricking whiskers,       Families by tens and dozens,     Brothers, sisters, husbands, wives--     Followed the Piper for their lives.     From street to street he piped advancing,     And step for step they followed dancing,     Until they came to the river Weser,     Wherein all plunged and perished!\"              Robert Browning.   As the rats were all dead, and there was no chance of their returning to plague them, the people of Hamelin refused to pay the reward, and they bade the piper do his worst. He took them at their word, and a few moments later the weird strains of the magic flute again arose, and this time it was the children who swarmed out of the houses and merrily followed the piper.       \"There was a rustling that seemed like a bustling     Of merry crowds justling at pitching and hustling;     Small feet were pattering, wooden shoes clattering,     Little hands clapping and little tongues chattering,     And, like fowls in a farmyard when barley is scattering,     Out came all the children running.     All the little boys and girls,     With rosy cheeks and flaxen curls,     And sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls,     Tripping and skipping, ran merrily after     The wonderful music with shouting and laughter.\"              Robert Browning.   The burghers were powerless to prevent the tragedy, and as they stood spellbound the piper led the children out of the town to the Koppelberg, a hill on the confines of the town, which miraculously opened to receive the procession, and only closed again when the last child had passed out of sight. This legend probably originated the adage \"to pay the piper.\" The children were never seen in Hamelin again, and in commemoration of this public calamity all official decrees have since been dated so many years after the Pied Piper's visit.       \"They made a decree that lawyers never       Should think their records dated duly     If, after the day of the month and year,     These words did not as well appear,     'And so long after what happened here       On the Twenty-second of July,     Thirteen hundred and seventy-six:'     And the better in memory to fix     The place of the children's last retreat,     They called it the Pied Piper Street--     Where any one playing on pipe or tabor     Was sure for the future to lose his labour.\"              Robert Browning.

Bishop Hatto  Another German legend which owes its existence to this belief is the story of Bishop Hatto, the miserly prelate, who, annoyed by the clamours of the poor during a time of famine, had them burned alive in a deserted barn, like the rats whom he declared they resembled, rather than give them some of the precious grain which he had laid up for himself.       \"'I' faith, 'tis an excellent bonfire!' quoth he,     'And the country is greatly obliged to me     For ridding it in these times forlorn     Of rats that only consume the corn.'\"              Robert Southey.   Soon after this terrible crime had been accomplished the bishop's retainers reported the approach of a vast swarm of rats. These, it appears, were the souls of the murdered peasants, which had assumed the forms of the rats to which the bishop had likened them. His efforts to escape were vain, and the rats pursued him even into the middle of the Rhine, to a stone tower in which he took refuge from their fangs. They swam to the tower, gnawed their way through the stone walls, and, pouring in on all sides at once, they found the bishop and devoured him alive.       \"And in at the windows, and in at the door,     And through the walls, helter-skelter they pour,     And down from the ceiling, and up through the floor,     From the right and the left, from behind and before,     From within and without, from above and below,     And all at once to the Bishop they go.     They have whetted their teeth against the stones;     And now they pick the Bishop's bones;     They gnaw'd the flesh from every limb,     For they were sent to do judgment on him!\"              Robert Southey.   The red glow of the sunset above the Rat Tower near Bingen on the Rhine is supposed to be the reflection of the hell fire in which the wicked bishop is slowly roasting in punishment for his heinous crime.    Irmin  In some parts of Germany Odin was considered to be identical with the Saxon god Irmin, whose statue, the Irminsul, near Paderborn, was destroyed by Charlemagne in 772. Irmin was said to possess a ponderous brazen chariot, in which he rode across the sky along the path which we know as the Milky Way, but which the ancient Germans designated as Irmin's Way. This chariot, whose rumbling sound occasionally became perceptible to mortal ears as thunder, never left the sky, where it can still be seen in the constellation of the Great Bear, which is also known in the North as Odin's, or Charles's, Wain.           \"The Wain, who wheels on high     His circling course, and on Orion waits;     Sole star that never bathes in the Ocean wave.\"              Homer's Iliad (Derby's tr.).    Mimir's Well  To obtain the great wisdom for which he is so famous, Odin, in the morn of time, visited Mimir's (Memor, memory) spring, \"the fountain of all wit and wisdom,\" in whose liquid depths even the future was clearly mirrored, and besought the old man who guarded it to let him have a draught. But Mimir, who well knew the value of such a favour (for his spring was considered the source or headwater of memory), refused the boon unless Odin would consent to give one of his eyes in exchange.  The god did not hesitate, so highly did he prize the draught, but immediately plucked out one of his eyes, which Mimir kept in pledge, sinking it deep down into his fountain, where it shone with mild lustre, leaving Odin with but one eye, which is considered emblematic of the sun.       \"Through our whole lives we strive towards the sun;     That burning forehead is the eye of Odin.     His second eye, the moon, shines not so bright;     It has he placed in pledge in Mimer's fountain,     That he may fetch the healing waters thence,     Each morning, for the strengthening of this eye.\"              Oehlenschläger (Howitt's tr.).   Drinking deeply of Mimir's fount, Odin gained the knowledge he coveted, and he never regretted the sacrifice he had made, but as further memorial of that day broke off a branch of the sacred tree Yggdrasil, which overshadowed the spring, and fashioned from it his beloved spear Gungnir.       \"A dauntless god     Drew for drink to its gleam,     Where he left in endless     Payment the light of an eye.     From the world-ash     Ere Wotan went he broke a bough;     For a spear the staff     He split with strength from the stem.\"              Dusk of the Gods, Wagner (Forman's tr.).   But although Odin was now all-wise, he was sad and oppressed, for he had gained an insight into futurity, and had become aware of the transitory nature of all things, and even of the fate of the gods, who were doomed to pass away. This knowledge so affected his spirits that he ever after wore a melancholy and contemplative expression.  To test the value of the wisdom he had thus obtained, Odin went to visit the most learned of all the giants, Vafthrudnir, and entered with him into a contest of wit, in which the stake was nothing less than the loser's head.       \"Odin rose with speed, and went     To contend in runic lore     With the wise and crafty Jute.     To Vafthrudni's royal hall     Came the mighty king of spells.\"              Vafthrudni's-mal (W. Taylor's tr.).    Odin and Vafthrudnir  On this occasion Odin had disguised himself as a Wanderer, by Frigga's advice, and when asked his name declared it was Gangrad. The contest of wit immediately began, Vafthrudnir questioning his guest concerning the horses which carried Day and Night across the sky, the river Ifing separating Jötun-heim from Asgard, and also about Vigrid, the field where the last battle was to be fought.  All these questions were minutely answered by Odin, who, when Vafthrudnir had ended, began the interrogatory in his turn, and received equally explicit answers about the origin of heaven and earth, the creation of the gods, their quarrel with the Vanas, the occupations of the heroes in Valhalla, the offices of the Norns, and the rulers who were to replace the Æsir when they had all perished with the world they had created. But when, in conclusion, Odin bent near the giant and softly inquired what words Allfather whispered to his dead son Balder as he lay upon his funeral pyre, Vafthrudnir suddenly recognised his divine visitor. Starting back in dismay, he declared that no one but Odin himself could answer that question, and that it was now quite plain to him that he had madly striven in a contest of wisdom and wit with the king of the gods, and fully deserved the penalty of failure, the loss of his head.       \"Not the man of mortal race     Knows the words which thou hast spoken     To thy son in days of yore.     I hear the coming tread of death;     He soon shall raze the runic lore,     And knowledge of the rise of gods,     From his ill-fated soul who strove     With Odin's self the strife of wit,     Wisest of the wise that breathe:     Our stake was life, and thou hast won.\"              Vafthrudni's-mal (W. Taylor's tr.).   As is the case with so many of the Northern myths, which are often fragmentary and obscure, this one ends here, and none of the scalds informs us whether Odin really slew his rival, nor what was the answer to his last question; but mythologists have hazarded the suggestion that the word whispered by Odin in Balder's ear, to console him for his untimely death, must have been \"resurrection.\"    Invention of Runes  Besides being god of wisdom, Odin was god and inventor of runes, the earliest alphabet used by Northern nations, which characters, signifying mystery, were at first used for divination, although in later times they served for inscriptions and records. Just as wisdom could only be obtained at the cost of sacrifice, Odin himself relates that he hung nine days and nights from the sacred tree Yggdrasil, gazing down into the immeasurable depths of Nifl-heim, plunged in deep thought, and self-wounded with his spear, ere he won the knowledge he sought.       \"I know that I hung     On a wind-rocked tree     Nine whole nights,     With a spear wounded,     And to Odin offered     Myself to myself;     On that tree     Of which no one knows     From what root it springs.\"              Odin's Rune-Song (Thorpe's tr.).   When he had fully mastered this knowledge, Odin cut magic runes upon his spear Gungnir, upon the teeth of his horse Sleipnir, upon the claws of the bear, and upon countless other animate and inanimate things. And because he had thus hung over the abyss for such a long space of time, he was ever after considered the patron divinity of all who were condemned to be hanged or who perished by the noose.  After obtaining the gift of wisdom and runes, which gave him power over all things, Odin also coveted the gift of eloquence and poetry, which he acquired in a manner which we shall relate in a subsequent chapter.    Geirrod and Agnar  Odin, as has already been stated, took great interest in the affairs of mortals, and, we are told, was specially fond of watching King Hrauding's handsome little sons, Geirrod and Agnar, when they were about eight and ten years of age respectively. One day these little lads went fishing, and a storm suddenly arose which blew their boat far out to sea, where it finally stranded upon an island, upon which dwelt a seeming old couple, who in reality were Odin and Frigga in disguise. They had assumed these forms in order to indulge a sudden passion for the close society of their protégés. The lads were warmly welcomed and kindly treated, Odin choosing Geirrod as his favourite, and teaching him the use of arms, while Frigga petted and made much of little Agnar. The boys tarried on the island with their kind protectors during the long, cold winter season; but when spring came, and the skies were blue, and the sea calm, they embarked in a boat which Odin provided, and set"]]]
