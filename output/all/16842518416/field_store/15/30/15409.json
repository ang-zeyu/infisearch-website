By Horatio Alger, Jr.    Alger Series For Boys. {About 50 Titles} Uniform With This Volume.        TO      The Boys      Whose Memory Goes Back With Me      To The Boarding School      At Potowome      This Volume Is Affectionately Dedicated      By      The Author.      PREFACE  “PAUL PRESCOTT'S CHARGE” is presented to the public as the second volume of the Campaign Series. Though wholly unlike the first volume, it is written in furtherance of the same main idea, that every boy's life is a campaign, more or less difficult, in which success depends upon integrity and a steadfast adherence to duty.  How Paul Prescott gained strength by battling with adverse circumstances, and, under all discouragements, kept steadily before him the charge which he received from his dying father, is fully told; and the author will be glad if the record shall prove an incentive and an encouragement to those boys who may have a similar campaign before them.     PAUL PRESCOTT'S CHARGE.     I.  SQUIRE NEWCOME.   “HANNAH!”  The speaker was a tall, pompous-looking man, whose age appeared to verge close upon fifty. He was sitting bolt upright in a high-backed chair, and looked as if it would be quite impossible to deviate from his position of unbending rigidity.  Squire Benjamin Newcome, as he was called, in the right of his position as Justice of the Peace, Chairman of the Selectmen, and wealthiest resident of Wrenville, was a man of rule and measure. He was measured in his walk, measured in his utterance, and measured in all his transactions. He might be called a dignified machine. He had a very exalted conception of his own position, and the respect which he felt to be his due, not only from his own household, but from all who approached him. If the President of the United States had called upon him, Squire Newcome would very probably have felt that he himself was the party who conferred distinction, and not received it.  Squire Newcome was a widower. His wife, who was as different from himself as could well be conceived, did not live long after marriage. She was chilled to death, as it was thought, by the dignified iceberg of whose establishment she had become a part. She had left, however, a child, who had now grown to be a boy of twelve. This boy was a thorn in the side of his father, who had endeavored in vain to mould him according to his idea of propriety. But Ben was gifted with a spirit of fun, sometimes running into mischief, which was constantly bursting out in new directions, in spite of his father's numerous and rather prosy lectures.  “Han-nah!” again called Squire Newcome, separating the two syllables by a pause of deliberation, and strongly accenting the last syllable,--a habit of his with all proper names.  Hannah was the Irish servant of all work, who was just then engaged in mixing up bread in the room adjoining, which was the kitchen.  Feeling a natural reluctance to appear before her employer with her hands covered with dough, she hastily washed them. All this, however, took time, and before she responded to the first summons, the second “Han-nah!” delivered with a little sharp emphasis, had been uttered.  At length she appeared at the door of the sitting-room.  “Han-nah!” said Squire Newcome, fixing his cold gray eye upon her, “when you hear my voice a calling you, it is your duty to answer the summons IMMEJIATELY.”  I have endeavored to represent the Squire's pronunciation of the last word.  “So I would have come IMMEJOUSLY,” said Hannah, displaying a most reprehensible ignorance, “but me hands were all covered with flour.”  “That makes no difference,” interrupted the Squire. “Flour is an accidental circumstance.”  “What's that?” thought Hannah, opening her eyes in amazement.  “And should not be allowed to interpose an obstacle to an IMMEJIATE answer to my summons.”  “Sir,” said Hannah, who guessed at the meaning though she did not understand the words, “you wouldn't have me dirty the door-handle with me doughy hands?”  “That could easily be remedied by ablution.”  “There ain't any ablution in the house,” said the mystified Hannah.  “I mean,” Squire Newcome condescended to explain, “the application of water--in short, washing.”  “Shure,” said Hannah, as light broke in upon her mind, “I never knew that was what they called it before.”  “Is Ben-ja-min at home?”  “Yes, sir. He was out playin' in the yard a minute ago. I guess you can see him from the winder.”  So saying she stepped forward, and looking out, all at once gave a shrill scream, and rushed from the room, leaving her employer in his bolt-upright attitude gazing after her with as much astonishment as he was capable of.  The cause of her sudden exit was revealed on looking out of the window.  Master Benjamin, or Ben, as he was called everywhere except in his own family, had got possession of the black kitten, and appeared to be submerging her in the hogshead of rainwater.  “O, you wicked, cruel boy, to drown poor Kitty!” exclaimed the indignant Hannah, rushing into the yard and endeavoring to snatch her feline favorite--an attempt which Ben stoutly resisted.  Doubtless the poor kitten would have fared badly between the two, had not the window opened, and the deliberate voice of his father, called out in tones which Ben saw fit to heed.  “What?”  “Come into my presence immejiately, and learn to answer me with more respect.”  Ben came in looking half defiant.  His father, whose perpendicularity made him look like a sitting grenadier, commenced the examination thus:--  “I wish you to inform me what you was a doing of when I spoke to you.”  It will be observed that the Squire's dignified utterances were sometimes a little at variance with the rule of the best modern grammarians.  “I was trying to prevent Hannah from taking the kitten,” said Ben.  “What was you a doing of before Hannah went out?”  “Playing with Kitty.”  “Why were you standing near the hogshead, Benjamin?”  “Why,” said Ben, ingenuously, “the hogshead happened to be near me--that was all.”  “Were you not trying to drown the kitten?”  “O, I wouldn't drown her for anything,” said Ben with an injured expression, mentally adding, “short of a three-cent piece.”  “Then, to repeat my interrogatory, what was you a doing of with the kitten in the hogshead?”  “I was teaching her to swim,” said Ben, looking out of the corner of his eye at his father, to see what impression this explanation made upon him.  “And what advantageous result do you think would be brought about by teaching of the kitten to swim, Benjamin?” persisted his father.  “Advantageous result!” repeated Ben, demurely, pretending not to understand.  “Certingly.”  “What does that mean?”  “Do you not study your dictionary at school, Benjamin?”  “Yes, but I don't like it much.”  “You are very much in error. You will never learn to employ your tongue with elegance and precision, unless you engage in this beneficial study.”  “I can use my tongue well enough, without studying grammar,” said Ben. He proceeded to illustrate the truth of this assertion by twisting his tongue about in a comical manner.  “Tongue,” exclaimed his father, “is but another name for language I mean your native language.”  “Oh!”  Ben was about to leave the room to avoid further questions of an embarrassing nature, when his father interrupted his exit by saying--  “Stay, Benjamin, do not withdraw till I have made all the inquiries which I intend.”  The boy unwillingly returned.  “You have not answered my question.”  “I've forgotten what it was.”  “What good would it do?” asked the Squire, simplifying his speech to reach Ben's comprehension, “what good would it do to teach the kitten to swim?”  “O, I thought,” said Ben, hesitating, “that some time or other she might happen to fall into the water, and might not be able to get out unless she knew how.”  “I think,” said his father with an unusual display of sagacity, “that she will be in much greater hazard of drowning while learning to swim under your direction than by any other chance likely to befall her.”  “Shouldn't wonder,” was Ben's mental comment, “Pretty cute for you, dad.”  Fortunately, Ben did not express his thoughts aloud. They would have implied such an utter lack of respect that the Squire would have been quite overwhelmed by the reflection that his impressive manners had produced no greater effect on one who had so excellent a chance of being impressed by them.  “Benjamin,” concluded his father, “I have an errand for you to execute. You may go to Mr. Prescott's and see if he is yet living. I hear that he is a lying on the brink of the grave.”  An expression of sadness stole over the usually merry face of Ben, as he started on his errand.  “Poor Paul!” he thought, “what will he do when his father dies? He's such a capital fellow, too. I just wish I had a wagon load of money, I do, and I'd give him half. That's so!”     II.  PAUL PRESCOTT'S HOME.   We will precede Ben on his visit to the house of Mr. Prescott.  It was an old weather-beaten house, of one story, about half a mile distant from 'Squire Newcome's residence. The Prescott family had lived here for five years, or ever since they had removed to Wrenville. Until within a year they had lived comfortably, when two blows came in quick succession. The first was the death of Mrs. Prescott, an excellent woman, whose loss was deeply felt by her husband and son. Soon afterwards Mr. Prescott, a carpenter by trade, while at work upon the roof of a high building, fell off, and not only broke his leg badly, but suffered some internal injury of a still more serious nature. He had not been able to do a stroke of work since. After some months it became evident that he would never recover. A year had now passed. During this time his expenses had swallowed up the small amount which he had succeeded in laying up previous to his sickness. It was clear that at his death there would be nothing left. At thirteen years of age Paul would have to begin the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/293"],["title","Paul Prescott's Charge (#1)"],["body","without a penny.  Mr. Prescott lay upon a bed in a small bedroom adjoining the kitchen. Paul, a thoughtful-looking boy sat beside it, ready to answer his call.  There had been silence for some time, when Mr. Prescott called feebly--  “Paul!”  “I am here, father,” said Paul.  “I am almost gone, Paul, I don't think I shall last through the day.”  “O, father,” said Paul, sorrowfully, “Don't leave me.”  “That is the only grief I have in dying--I must leave you to struggle for yourself, Paul. I shall be able to leave you absolutely nothing.”  “Don't think of that, father. I am young and strong--I can earn my living in some way.”  “I hoped to live long enough to give you an education. I wanted you to have a fairer start in the world than I had.”  “Never mind, father,” said Paul, soothingly, “Don't be uneasy about me. God will provide for me.”  Again there was a silence, broken only by the difficult breathing of the sick man.  He spoke again.  “There is one thing, Paul, that I want to tell you before I die.”  Paul drew closer to the bedside.  “It is something which has troubled me as I lay here. I shall feel easier for speaking of it. You remember that we lived at Cedarville before we came here.”  “Yes, father.”  “About two years before we left there, a promising speculation was brought to my notice. An agent of a Lake Superior mine visited our village and represented the mine in so favorable a light that many of my neighbors bought shares, fully expecting to double their money in a year. Among the rest I was attacked with the fever of speculation. I had always been obliged to work hard for a moderate compensation, and had not been able to do much more than support my family. This it seemed to me, afforded an excellent opportunity of laying up a little something which might render me secure in the event of a sudden attack of sickness. I had but about two hundred dollars, however, and from so scanty an investment I could not, of course, expect a large return; accordingly I went to Squire Conant; you remember him, Paul?”  “Yes, father.”  'I went to him and asked a loan of five hundred dollars. After some hesitation he agreed to lend it to me. He was fond of his money and not much given to lending, but it so happened that he had invested in the same speculation, and had a high opinion of it, so he felt pretty safe in advancing me the money. Well, this loan gave me seven hundred dollars, with which I purchased seven shares in the Lake Superior Grand Combination Mining Company. For some months afterwards, I felt like a rich man. I carefully put away my certificate of stock, looking upon it as the beginning of a competence. But at the end of six months the bubble burst--the stock proved to be utterly worthless,--Squire Conant lost five thousand dollars. I lost seven hundred, five hundred being borrowed money. The Squire's loss was much larger, but mine was the more serious, since I lost everything and was plunged into debt, while he had at least forty thousand dollars left.  “Two days after the explosion, Squire Conant came into my shop and asked abruptly when I could pay him the amount I had borrowed. I told him that I could not fix a time. I said that I had been overwhelmed by a result so contrary to my anticipations, but I told him I would not rest till I had done something to satisfy his claim. He was always an unreasonable man, and reproached me bitterly for sinking his money in a useless speculation, as if I could foresee how it would end any better than he.”  “Have you ever been able to pay back any part of the five hundred dollars, father?”  “I have paid the interest regularly, and a year ago, just before I met with my accident, I had laid up a hundred and fifty dollars which I had intended to pay the Squire, but when my sickness came I felt obliged to retain it to defray our expenses, being cut off from earning anything.”  “Then I suppose you have not been able to pay interest for the last year.”  “No.”  “Have you heard from the Squire lately?”  “Yes, I had a letter only last week. You remember bringing me one postmarked Cedarville?”  “Yes, I wondered at the time who it could be from.”  “You will find it on the mantelpiece. I should like to have you get it and read it.”  Paul readily found the letter. It was enclosed in a brown envelope, directed in a bold hand to “Mr. John Prescott, Wrenville.”  The letter was as follows:--   CEDARVILLE, APRIL 15, 18--,  MR. JOHN PRESCOTT:--  SIR: I have been waiting impatiently to hear something about the five hundred dollars in which sum you are indebted to me, on account of a loan which I was fool enough to make you seven years since. I thought you an honest man, but I have found, to my cost, that I was mistaken. For the last year you have even failed to pay interest as stipulated between us. Your intention is evident. I quite understand that you have made up your mind to defraud me of what is rightfully mine. I don't know how you may regard this, but I consider it as bad as highway robbery. I do not hesitate to say that if you had your deserts you would be in the Penitentiary. Let me advise you, if you wish to avoid further trouble, to make no delay in paying a portion of this debt. Yours, etc. EZEKIEL CONANT.   Paul's face flushed with indignation as he read this bitter and cruel letter.  “Does Squire Conant know that you are sick, father?” he inquired.  “Yes, I wrote him about my accident, telling him at the same time that I regretted it in part on account of the interruption which it must occasion in my payments.”  “And knowing this, he wrote such a letter as that,” said Paul, indignantly, “what a hard, unfeeling wretch he must be!”  “I suppose it is vexatious to him to be kept out of his money.”  “But he has plenty more. He would never miss it if he had given it to you outright.”  “That is not the way to look at it, Paul. The money is justly his, and it is a great sorrow to me that I must die without paying it.”  “Father,” said Paul, after a pause, “will it be any relief to you, if I promise to pay it,--that is, if I am ever able?”  Mr. Prescott's face brightened.  “That was what I wanted to ask you, Paul. It will be a comfort to me to feel that there is some hope of the debt being paid at some future day.”  “Then don't let it trouble you any longer, father. The debt shall be mine, and I will pay it.”  Again a shadow passed over the sick man's face, “Poor boy,” he said, “why should I burden your young life with such a load? You will have to struggle hard enough as it is. No, Paul, recall your promise. I don't want to purchase comfort at such a price.”  “No, father,” said Paul sturdily, “it is too late now. I have made the promise and I mean to stick to it. Besides, it will give me something to live for. I am young--I may have a great many years before me. For thirteen years you have supported me. It is only right that I should make what return I can. I'll keep my promise, father.”  “May God help and prosper you, my boy,” said Mr. Prescott, solemnly. “You've been a good son; I pray that you may grow up to be a good man. But, my dear, I feel tired. I think I will try to go to sleep.”  Paul smoothed the comforter, adjusting it carefully about his father's neck, and going to the door went out in search of some wood to place upon the fire. Their scanty stock of firewood was exhausted, and Paul was obliged to go into the woods near by, to obtain such loose fagots as he might find upon the ground.  He was coming back with his load when his attention was drawn by a whistle. Looking up he discovered Ben Newcome approaching him.  “How are you, Paul?”  “Pretty well, Ben.”  “How precious lonesome you must be, mewed up in the house all the time.”  “Yes, it is lonesome, but I wouldn't mind that if I thought father would ever get any better.”  “How is he this morning?”  “Pretty low; I expect he is asleep. He said he was tired just before I went out.”  “I brought over something for you,” said Ben, tugging away at his pocket.  Opening a paper he displayed a couple of apple turnovers fried brown.  “I found 'em in the closet,” he said.  “Won't Hannah make a precious row when she finds 'em gone?”  “Then I don't know as I ought to take them,” said Paul, though, to tell the truth, they looked tempting to him.  “O, nonsense,” said Ben; “they don't belong to Hannah. She only likes to scold a little; it does her good.”  The two boys sat on the doorstep and talked while Paul ate the turnovers. Ben watched the process with much satisfaction.  “Ain't they prime?” he said.  “First rate,” said Paul; “won't you have one?”  “No,” said Ben; “you see I thought while I was about it I might as well take four, so I ate two coming along.”  In about fifteen minutes Paul went into the house to look at his father. He was lying very quietly upon the bed. Paul drew near and looked at him more closely. There was something in the expression of his father's face which terrified him.  Ben heard his sudden cry of dismay, and hurriedly entered.  Paul pointed to the bed, and said briefly, “Father's dead!”  Ben, who in spite of his mischievous propensities was gifted with a warm heart, sat down beside Paul, and passing his arm round his neck, gave him that silent sympathy which is always so grateful to the grief-stricken heart.      III.  PAUL'S BRILLIANT PROSPECTS.   Two days later, the funeral of Mr. Prescott took place.  Poor Paul! It seemed to him a dream of inexpressible sorrow. His father and mother both gone, he felt that he was indeed left alone in the world. No thought of the future had yet entered his mind. He was wholly occupied with his present sorrow. Desolate at heart he slipped away from the graveyard after the funeral ceremony was over, and took his way back again to the lonely dwelling which he had called home.  As he was sitting in the corner, plunged in sorrowful thought, there was a scraping heard at the door, and a loud hem!  Looking up, Paul saw entering the cottage the stiff form of Squire"]]]
