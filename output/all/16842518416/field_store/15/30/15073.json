This learned character died in the vigour of life, and in the bloom of reputation: and, as I suspect, in consequence of the BIBLIOMANIA--for he was always collecting books, and always studying them. His \"Schoolmaster\" is a work which can only perish with our language.       [Footnote 20: The EARL of SURREY and SIR THOMAS WYATT were      among the first who taught their countrymen to be charmed      with the elegance and copiousness of their own language. How      effectually they accomplished this laudable object, will be      seen from the forthcoming beautiful and complete edition of      their works by the Rev. Dr. Nott.[B]]       [Footnote B: It fell to the lot of the printer of this      volume, during his apprenticeship to his father, to correct      the press of nearly the whole of Dr. Nott's labours, which      were completed, after several years of toil, when in the      extensive conflagration of the printing-office at Bolt      Court, Fleet-street, in 1819, all but _two_ copies were      totally destroyed!]       [Footnote 21: COLET, MORE, and ERASMUS [considering the      latter when he was in England] were _here_ undoubtedly the      great literary triumvirate of the early part of the 16th      century. The lives of More and Erasmus are generally read      and known; but of DEAN COLET it may not be so generally      known that his ardour for books and for classical literature      was keen, and insatiable; that, in the foundation of ST.      PAUL'S SCHOOL, he has left behind a name which entitles him      to rank in the foremost of those who have fallen victims to      the BIBLIOMANIA. How anxiously does he seem to have watched      the progress, and pushed the sale, of his friend Erasmus's      first edition of the Greek Testament! \"Quod scribis de Novo      Testamento intelligo. Et libri _novæ editionis tuæ hic avide      emuntur et passim leguntur_!\" The entire epistle (which may      be seen in Dr. Knight's dry Life of Colet, p. 315) is      devoted to an account of Erasmus's publications. \"I am      really astonished, my dear Erasmus [does he exclaim], at the      fruitfulness of your talents; that, without any fixed      residence, and with a precarious and limited income, you      contrive to publish so many and such excellent works.\"      Adverting to the distracted state of Germany at this period,      and to the wish of his friend to live secluded and      unmolested, he observes--\"As to the tranquil retirement      which you sigh for, be assured that you have my sincere      wishes for its rendering you as happy and composed as you      can wish it. Your age and erudition entitle you to such a      retreat. I fondly hope, indeed, that you will choose this      country for it, and come and live amongst us, whose      disposition you know, and whose friendship you have proved.\"       There is hardly a more curious picture of the custom of the      times, relating to the education of boys, than the Dean's      own Statutes for the regulation of St. Paul's School, which      he had founded. These shew, too, the _popular books_ then      read by the learned. \"The children shall come unto the      School in the morning at seven of the clock, both winter and      summer, and tarry there until eleven; and return against one      of the clock, and depart at five, &c. In the school, no time      in the year, they shall use tallow candle in no wise, but      _only wax candle_, at the costs of their friends. Also I      will they bring no meat nor drink, nor bottle, nor use in      the school no breakfasts, nor drinkings, in the time of      learning, in no wise, &c. I will they use no cockfightings,      nor riding about of victory, nor disputing at Saint      Bartholomew, which is but foolish babbling and loss of      time.\" The master is then restricted, under the penalty of      40 shillings, from granting the boys a holiday, or \"remedy,\"      [play-day,] as it is here called \"except the King, an      Archbishop, or a Bishop, present in his own person in the      school, desire it.\" The studies for the lads were,      \"Erasmus's Copia & Institutum Christiani Hominis (composed      at the Dean's request) Lactantius, Prudentius, Juvencus,      Proba and Sedulius, and Baptista Mantuanus, and such other      as shall be thought convenient and most to purpose unto the      true Latin speech: all barbary, all corruption, all Latin      adulterate, which ignorant blind fools brought into this      world, and with the same hath distained and poisoned the old      Latin speech, and the _veray_ Roman tongue, which in the      time of Tully and Sallust and Virgil and Terence was used--I      say that filthiness, and all such abusion, which the later      blind world brought in, which more rather may be called      _Bloterature_ that [Transcriber's Note: than] _Literature_,      I utterly banish and exclude out of this school.\" _Life of      Knight's Colet_, 362-4.       What was to be expected, but that boys, thus educated, would      hereafter fall victims to the BIBLIOMANIA?]       [Footnote 22: The history of this great men [Transcriber's      Note: man], and of his literary labours, is most      interesting. He was a pupil of William Lilly, the first      head-master of St. Paul's School; and, by the kindness and      liberality of a Mr. Myles, he afterwards received the      advantage of a College education, and was supplied with      money in order to travel abroad, and make such collections      as he should deem necessary for the great work which even      then seemed to dawn upon his young and ardent mind. Leland      endeavoured to requite the kindness of his benefactor by an      elegant copy of Latin verses, in which he warmly expatiates      on the generosity of his patron, and acknowledges that his      acquaintance with the _Almæ Matres_ [for he was of both      Universities] was entirely the result of such beneficence.      While he resided on the continent, he was admitted into the      society of the most eminent Greek and Latin Scholars, and      could probably number among his correspondents the      illustrious names of Budæus, Erasmus, the Stephani, Faber      and Turnebus. Here, too, he cultivated his natural taste for      poetry; and from inspecting the fine BOOKS which the Italian      and French presses had produced, as well as fired by the      love of Grecian learning, which had fled, on the sacking of      Constantinople, to take shelter in the academic bowers of      the Medici, he seems to have matured his plans for carrying      into effect the great work which had now taken full      possession of his mind. He returned to England, resolved to      institute an inquiry into the state of the LIBRARIES,      Antiquities, Records and Writings then in existence. Having      entered into holy orders, and obtained preferment at the      express interposition of the King, (Henry VIII.), he was      appointed his Antiquary and Library Keeper, and a royal      commission was issued in which Leland was directed to search      after \"ENGLAND'S ANTIQUITIES, and peruse the LIBRARIES of      all Cathedrals, Abbies, Priories, Colleges, etc., as also      all the places wherein Records, Writings, and Secrets of      Antiquity were reposited.\" \"Before Leland's time,\" says      Hearne, in the Preface to the Itinerary, \"all the literary      monuments of Antiquity were totally disregarded; and      Students of Germany, apprised of this culpable indifference,      were suffered to enter our libraries unmolested, and to cut      out of the books deposited there whatever passages they      thought proper--which they afterwards published as relics of      the ancient literature of their own country.\"       Leland was occupied, without intermission, in this immense      undertaking, for the space of six years; and, on its      completion, he hastened to the metropolis to lay at the feet      of his Sovereign the result of his researches. This was      presented to Henry under the title of A NEW YEAR'S GIFT; and      was first published by Bale in 1549, 8vo. \"Being inflamed,\"      says the author, \"with a love to see thoroughly all those      parts of your opulent and ample realm, in so much that all      my other occupations intermitted, I have so travelled in      your dominions, both by the sea coasts and the middle parts,      sparing neither labour nor costs, by the space of six years      past, that there is neither cape nor bay, haven, creek, or      pier, river, or confluence of rivers, breeches, wastes,      lakes, moors, fenny waters, mountains, vallies, heaths,      forests, chases, woods, cities, burghes, castles, principal      manor places, monasteries and colleges, but I have seen      them; and noted, in so doing, a whole world of things very      memorable.\" Leland moreover tells his Majesty--that \"By his      laborious journey and costly enterprise, he had conserved      many good authors, the which otherwise had been like to have      perished; of the which, part remained in the royal palaces,      part also in his own custody, &c.\"       As Leland was engaged six years in this literary tour, so he      was occupied for a no less period of time in digesting and      arranging the prodigious number of MSS. he had collected.      But he sunk beneath the immensity of the task! The want of      amanuenses, and of other attentions and comforts, seems to      have deeply affected him; in this melancholy state, he wrote      to Archbishop Cranmer a Latin epistle, in verse, of which      the following is the commencement--very forcibly describing      his situation and anguish of mind.            Est congesta mihi domi supellex           Ingens, aurea, nobilis, venusta           Qua totus studeo Britanniarum           Vero reddere gloriam nitori.           Sed fortuna meis noverca coeptis           Jam felicibus invidet maligna.

Implorare tuam benignitatem           Cogor.       The result was that Leland lost his senses; and, after      lingering two years in a state of total derangement, he died      on the 18th of April, 1552. \"Prôh tristes rerum humanarum      vices! prôh viri optimi deplorandam infelicissimamque      sortem!\" exclaims Dr. Smith, in his preface to Camden's      Life, 1691, 4to.       The precious and voluminous MSS. of Leland were doomed to      suffer a fate scarcely less pitiable than that of their      owner. After being pilfered by some, and garbled by others,      they served to replenish the pages of Stow, Lambard, Camden,      Burton, Dugdale, and many other antiquaries and historians.      Polydore Virgil, who had stolen from them pretty freely, had      the insolence to abuse Leland's memory--calling him \"a vain      glorious man;\" but what shall we say to this flippant      egotist? who, according to Caius's testimony [_De Antiq.      Cantab. head. lib._ 1.] \"to prevent a discovery of the many      errors of his own History of England, collected and burnt a      greater number of ancient histories and manuscripts than      would have loaded a waggon.\" The imperfect remains of      Leland's MSS. are now deposited in the Bodleian Library, and      in the British Museum.       Upon the whole, it must be acknowledged that Leland is a      melancholy, as well as illustrious, example of the influence      of the BIBLIOMANIA!]       [Footnote 23: In spite of BALE'S coarseness, positiveness,      and severity, he has done much towards the cause of      learning; and, perhaps, towards the propagation of the      disease under discussion. His regard for Leland does him      great honour; and although his plays are miserably dull,      notwithstanding the high prices which the original editions      of them bear, (vide ex. gr. Cat. Steevens, No. 1221;      which was sold for £12 12_s._ See also the reprints in the      Harleian Miscellany) the lover of literary antiquities must      not forget that his \"_Scriptores Britanniæ_\" are yet quoted      with satisfaction by some of the most respectable writers of      the day. That he wanted delicacy of feeling, and      impartiality of investigation, must be admitted; but a      certain rough honesty and prompt benevolence which he had      about him compensated for a multitude of offences. The      abhorrence with which he speaks of the dilapidation of some      of our old libraries must endear his memory to every honest      bibliographer: \"Never (says he) had we been offended for the      loss of our LIBRARIES, being so many in number, and in so      desolate places for the more part, if the chief monuments      and most notable works of our excellent writers had been      reserved. If there had been in every shire of England, but      one SOLEMPNE LIBRARY, to the preservation of those noble      works, and preferment of good learning in our posterity, it      had been yet somewhat. But to destroy all without      consideration, is, and will be, unto England for ever, a      most horrible infamy among the grave seniors of other      nations. A great number of them which purchased those      superstitious mansions, reserved of those library-books,      some to serve the _jakes_, some to scour their candlesticks,      and some to rub their boots: some they sold to the grocers      and soap-sellers; some they sent over sea to the      book-binders, not in small number, but at times whole ships      full, to the wondering of the foreign nations. Yea, the      Universities of this realm are not all clear of this      detestable fact. But cursed is that belly which seeketh to      be fed with such ungodly gain, and shameth his natural      country. I know a merchant man, which shall at this time be      nameless, that _bought the contents of two noble libraries      for forty shillings price_; a shame it is to be spoken! This      stuff hath he occupied in the stead of grey paper, by the      space of more than ten years, and yet he hath store enough      for as many year to come!\" Bale's Preface to Leland's      \"_Laboryouse journey_, &c.\" Emprented at London by John      Bale. Anno M.D. xlix. 8vo.       After this, who shall doubt the story of the Alexandrian      Library supplying the hot baths of Alexandria with fuel for      six months! See Gibbon on the latter subject; vol. ix. 440.]       [Footnote 24: ASCHAM'S English letter, written when he was      abroad, will be found at the end of Bennet's edition of his      works, in 4to. They are curious and amusing. What relates to      the BIBLIOMANIA I here select from similar specimens. \"Oct.      4. At afternoon I went about the town [of Bruxelles]. I went      to the frier [Transcriber's Note: friar] Carmelites house,      and heard their even song: after, I desired to see the      LIBRARY. A frier [Transcriber's Note: friar] was sent to me,      and led me into it. There was not one good book but _Lyra_.      The friar was learned, spoke Latin readily, entered into      Greek, having a very good wit, and a greater desire to      learning. He was gentle and honest, &c.\" p. 370-1. \"Oct. 20.      to Spira: a good city. Here I first saw _Sturmius de      periodis_. I also found here _Ajax_, _Electra_, and      _Antigone Sophocles_, excellently, by my good judgment,      translated into verse, and fair printed this summer by      Gryphius. Your stationers do ill, that at least do 'not      provide you the register of all books, especially of old      authors, &c.'\" p. 372. Again: \"Hieronimus Wolfius, that      translated Demosthenes and Isocrates, is in this town. I am      well acquainted with him, and have brought him twice to my      Lord's to dinner. He looks very simple. He telleth me that      one Borrheus, that hath written well upon Aristot. priorum,      &c., even now is printing goodly commentaries upon      Aristotle's Rhetoric. But Sturmius will obscure them all.\"      p. 381.       It is impossible to read these extracts without being      convinced that Roger Ascham was a book-hunter, and infected      with the BIBLIOMANIA!]  If we are to judge from the beautiful Missal lying open before Lady Jane Grey, in Mr. Copley's elegant picture now exhibiting at the British Institution, it would seem rational to infer that this amiable and learned female was slightly attacked by the disease. It is to be taken for granted that Queen Elizabeth was not exempt from it; and that her great Secretary,[25] Cecil, sympathised with her! In regard to Elizabeth, her _Prayer-Book_[26] is quite evidence sufficient for me that she found the BIBLIOMANIA irresistible! During her reign, how vast and how frightful were the ravages of the Book-madness! If we are to credit Laneham's celebrated Letter, it had extended far into the country, and infected some of the worthy inhabitants of Coventry; for one \"Captain Cox,[27] by profession a mason, and that right skilful,\" had \"as fair a library of sciences, and as many goodly monuments both in Prose and Poetry, and at afternoon could talk as much without book, as any Innholder betwixt Brentford and Bagshot, what degree soever he be!\"       [Footnote 25: It is a question which requires more time for      the solution than I am able to spare, whether CECIL'S name      stands more frequently at the head of a Dedication, in a      printed book, or of State Papers and other political      documents in MS. He was a wonderful man; but a little      infected--as I suspect--with the BOOK-DISEASE.            ----Famous Cicill, treasurer of the land,           Whose wisedom, counsell, skill of Princes state           The world admires----           The house itselfe doth shewe the owners wit,           And may for bewtie, state, and every thing,           Compared be with most within the land.            _Tale of Two Swannes_, 1590. 4_to._       I have never yet been able to ascertain whether the owner's      attachment towards VELLUM, or LARGE PAPER, Copies was the      more vehement!]       [Footnote 26: Perhaps this conclusion is too precipitate.      But whoever looks at Elizabeth's portrait, on her bended      knees, struck off on the reverse of the title page to her      prayer book (first printed in 1565) may suppose that the      Queen thought the addition of her own portrait would be no      mean decoration to the work. Every page is adorned with      borders, engraved on wood, of the most spirited execution:      representing, amongst other subjects, \"The Dance of Death.\"      My copy is the reprint of 1608--in high preservation. I have      no doubt that there was a _presentation_ copy printed UPON      VELLUM; but in what cabinet does this precious gem now      slumber?]       [Footnote 27: Laneham gives a splendid list of Romances and      Old Ballads possessed by this said CAPTAIN COX; and tells      us, moreover, that \"he had them all at his fingers ends.\"      Among the ballads we find \"Broom broom on Hil; So Wo is me      begon twlly lo; Over a Whinny Meg; Hey ding a ding; Bony      lass upon Green; My bony on gave me a bek; By a bank as I      lay; and two more he had fair wrapt up in parchment, and      bound with a whip cord.\" Edit. 1784, p. 36-7-8. Ritson, in      his Historical Essay on _Scottish Song_, speaks of some of      these, with a zest, as if he longed to untie the \"whip-cord\"      packet.]  While the country was thus giving proofs of the prevalence of this disorder, the two Harringtons (especially the younger)[28] and the illustrious Spenser[29] were unfortunately seized with it in the metropolis.
