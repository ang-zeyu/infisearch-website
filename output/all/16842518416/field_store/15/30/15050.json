It has a big army, and it is surrounded by a strong ring of other Guelfo cities and castles. After I am gone, the cardinals will be safe there while they elect a new pope.\"  Simon realized that he was indeed looking at a dying man. From here to Perugia was a journey of at least two weeks, through difficult, mountainous country. Urban might get there safely, but he would not live there long. The election of a new pope would take months; it had been known to take years. And Urban's successor might be even more reluctant to join forces with the Tartars than Urban had been. What if it were Cardinal Ugolini--he was as eligible as anyone--or someone under his influence? The little they had accomplished so far might be wholly undone.  Time. Time was the most terrible enemy of all. The more time passed, the less likely that the alliance would be formed, the joint attack on the Saracens launched. Simon saw time as a black river in flood, sweeping away everything he had worked and fought for.  _I must prevail upon him to give his permission--now. But how can I sway a man three times my age--the pope himself?_  The only way to keep from giving in to despair was to plunge in, as if this were a tournament, or a fight to the death. Simon plunged in.  \"Your Holiness, before you leave Orvieto, I beg you to recognize that we must join with the Tartars to crush the infidel.\"  Urban sighed. \"You think just as your King Louis does.\" He held up an admonitory finger. \"Europe first, Simon. The Church must be strong in Europe before our princes go adventuring in Outremer.\"  \"But it was the popes who preached the Crusades in the first place,\" Simon answered, baffled.  Urban's eyes grew wide and he leaned forward. \"And I will preach yet another crusade, Simon. Against Manfred the Antichrist. That is why I would have sent for you if you had not come here. You must make the journey to King Louis and tell him that this crusade that I will preach is the most important war of his lifetime. He must come to my aid. I will make his brother Charles king of southern Italy and Sicily. I will write the letter to King Louis, and you will carry it to him.\"  _Now I must make my effort._  \"He will heed your appeal if you give him what he wants, Your Holiness. Write that letter. But in it give your permission for King Louis to ally himself with the Tartars and begin preparations for a new crusade.\"  Urban looked slyly up at Simon. \"Surely you suspect that it was I who persuaded Fra Tomasso d'Aquino to change his colors where the Tartars are concerned. I saw to it that the possibility of an alliance was kept alive, so that I might have something Louis and I could haggle over. Louis is the most stubborn man in the world. If I simply give him whatever he wants, there is no guarantee that he will give me what I want.\"  Simon took a deep breath. What he was about to say might offend the pope deeply.  \"Your Holiness, you have said it yourself. There is no more time for haggling. You must make your best offer and hope it is enough.\"  The pope shut his eyes and slumped in his chair. Simon's heart went cold, thinking for a moment that the old man had suffered a seizure.  But then Urban said very softly, \"Help me to turn my chair around.\"  Now Simon's heart beat faster as he moved the pope's chair so that it faced his desk. Urban took a gleaming blank sheet of parchment from the pile on his desk, dipped a quill, shook it, and began to write.  Simon stood by the wall, his heart pounding with exhilaration. Could it actually be that his words had moved the pope himself? It seemed impossible, as if he had stood in the path of a mighty river and diverted its course.  \"The Tartars,\" the old man said with a sigh sometime later, when he had covered two sheets of parchment. \"I hope I am not making a terrible mistake. I still think Fra Tomasso was right in what he first said about them.\" He dropped wax at the bottom of the letter, stamped it with his ring, and blew on the wax to cool it. Then he folded the parchment and sealed it again.  \"Ride to King Louis as quickly as possible.\" Urban turned, again half rising from his chair, and handed Simon the letter.  \"Shall I carry the king's answer to Perugia, Holy Father?\"  Urban shrugged. \"Oh, yes, I shall surely be in Perugia by the time you come back. But God will take me before the first of Charles d'Anjou's knights sets foot in Italy.\" He raised a pale hand to silence Simon's polite protest, and there was actually a twinkle in his eye. \"Whatever my successor thinks, he will have a hard time undoing the decisions I have made today. By the time the next pope is elected, he will have a French army to help him destroy the Hohenstaufen. Whether he wants to or not.\"  \"What of the Tartar ambassadors, Your Holiness?\" Simon asked, thinking that it would be best to hasten those negotiations, too, lest the next pope disapprove of them. \"Should I take them with me to the king?\"  \"No,\" said Urban firmly. \"Then you would have to take a troop with you to guard them. You may have to travel far to find King Louis. He is setting out on a royal progress through his kingdom. I had a report of him just two days ago. That is one great benefit of this office--\" His gray beard twitched again, and Simon knew that he was smiling. \"News comes to us from everywhere.\" Then his eyelids lowered. \"That is also what makes being the Holy Father so wearisome.\"  Yes, of course, King Louis made a journey of inspection through some portion of his realm nearly every summer. It might be months, Simon thought with a sinking heart, before he could find the king, deliver the pope's letter, and get back to the papal court. So much could happen.  _But the most important thing of all has already happened. We have won. We have the alliance!_  Triumph rang like cathedral bells in his ears. He was bringing victory to the king and to Count Charles. And his success would restore honor to the house of Gobignon.  Simon knelt once again, kissing the Fisherman's Ring and thinking that the hand that wore it would soon be cold.  But as he hurried down a corridor in the Palazzo Papale, already planning his route to France, the bells of triumph stopped ringing and in the silence a face appeared before his mind's eye. Amber eyes, olive skin, and wine-colored lips.  _Sophia! By all the angels and saints, I may never see her again!_  For a moment he felt torn. Duty and honor demanded that he leave Orvieto at once. But what of love? Sophia's image smiled, and he decided. He would need at least a day to prepare for his journey anyway. Before he left Orvieto he must see Sophia and make sure that the meeting would not be their last.     XLVII   Fat gray clouds hung low over the Umbrian hills, and Sophia thought she heard thunder rumbling in the west. As Simon's message had promised, he was waiting for her by the shrine of the Virgin on the road leading north from Orvieto. But what was he doing here, she wondered, with spare horses and a loaded baggage mule?  He waved to her and dismounted, and his scudiero--the same man who had yesterday delivered Simon's note to her--took charge of the beasts.  Clearly Simon was beginning a journey. He had not simply come out here to meet her. But he would not go anywhere far with no more company than one squire. And how could he leave the Tartars when hardly two months ago he had nearly lost his life protecting them?  Trying to puzzle out what was afoot, she rode with Ugolini's man Riccardo beside her to the shed-covered shrine where a blue-robed Mary held a smiling baby Jesus. Riccardo helped her down from her horse and Simon came forward.  She took Simon's arm, and he led her into the pine forest beside the road. She studied his face, trying to guess what thoughts were passing behind his somber blue eyes.  As soon as they were out of sight of their companions, she asked him, \"Are you going to Perugia ahead of the pope?\"  He did not answer her at once, so she kept her gaze on him.  Sophia enjoyed looking at Simon as she enjoyed looking at beautiful icons, jewels, sculptures. Yet his body did not have the fine proportions she had seen in statues made by Greeks of old. He was very tall and slender, all sharp lines pointing to heaven. His head, framed by long dark brown hair, was narrow, the nose and chin angular. His eyes, set in deep hollows, were bright with candor and intelligence, though at times she saw in them a haunted look.  She even found his barbaric Frankish garb pleasing. From Simon's narrow shoulders hung a cloak of rich crimson silk, and he wore a soft maroon cap adorned with a blood-red feather. The purple surcoat that extended below his knees sparkled with dozens of embroidered repetitions of a design of three gold crowns. In Constantinople only the Basileus and his consort were permitted to wear purple. From Simon's black leather belt, decorated with silver plates, hung a curving Saracen sword. Precious stones twinkled in its handle.  Now that she considered it, she recalled that she had always seen Simon in more subdued colors.  _He dressed this way to please me_, she thought fondly.  He looked away from her, but there was nowhere for him to look. They were walled in on all sides by a thick growth of pines. The lower trunks of the trees were straight and clean, like the poles of a palisade, their branches, which started higher than she could reach, putting out the bright green needles of new summer growth. Somewhere far above them was the cloudy, rain-heavy sky, but here they were enveloped in deep shadow under interlocked pine branches. The forest was so dark and soundless that she began to feel a little frightened. Simon and she were enemies, after all, even though she hoped he would never realize it. She often forgot it herself, when she was with him, liking him as much as she did.  \"I am not going to Perugia,\" he said.  \"Did you have me ride all the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28516"],["title","The Saracen: The Holy War (#7)"],["body","out here to tell me no more than that?\" she demanded.  \"I wanted to tell you that I love you,\" he said hoarsely. He turned toward her, and his face glowed with adoration.  _Oh, the boy! The dear, beautiful boy! He loves me, and he means it with every fiber of his being._  She felt a wave of warmth, not love but surely a kindliness, going out from her to him. He turned and took her shoulders in his big hands. She liked the feel of his hands on her. If only she could forget about David, she could happily give herself to him.  But she _was_ acting for David, and she was here to find out what this Frank was planning. She must make some guesses, and then see if she could get him to confirm them. Such as, where was he going, and why was he leaving the Tartars behind?  She had to tilt her head back to look into his troubled face. \"Come, let us sit down,\" she said. She took his hand and led him to a tree whose trunk was wide enough to let them rest their backs against it. Her silk skirt formed a dark green semicircle around her, bordered by an embroidered orange and red design of flowers.  There was a grace in the way he sat down, despite his long arms and legs. With a practiced movement he swept his sword back behind him, out of his way.  \"Where were David of Trebizond and Giancarlo the night of the attack on the Monaldeschi palace?\" he asked suddenly. She went cold. Did he suspect them, and her too? Had d'Ucello told him of his unsuccessful effort to see David and Lorenzo that very night?  \"They had both left the city,\" she said. \"They went to Perugia and Assisi. David wished to see the wonder-working body of San Francesco at Assisi.\"  \"I thought he was interested in silk, not saints.\" Simon glowered at her.  She made herself laugh. \"Surely you do not think David the merchant was in the streets, fighting, the night the Monaldeschi were attacked?\"  She heard a bell ring somewhere in the distance. Some little hillside church ringing out the hour of Tierce. The chiming sounded clear and peaceful.  _Dear God, sometimes I wish I could have become a nun._  Simon sighed and took her hand gently and held it resting on his thigh. \"Why does it have to be Cardinal Ugolini who is your uncle?\"  \"If not for my Uncle Adelberto I would not be here and we would never have met,\" she said.  \"You are so beautiful,\" he said.  The adoration in his eyes was like a dagger in her heart. She wanted so much for it to be for her, and it was for a woman who did not exist.  _I am so far from what he thinks I am. Michael and Manfred treated me like a whore. David sends me to seduce this man who is his enemy._  And that, she thought, was why she so much hated to see what had happened to Rachel, and to know that David had done it and that she herself had a hand in it.  \"You will never come back to Orvieto, will you?\" she said disconsolately.  His grip on her hand tightened. \"No. That is why I wanted to meet you today. Tell me--if your uncle goes to Perugia to follow the pope, will you go with him?\"  She let her body lean sideways till she was pressed against him. \"Oh, I am sure my uncle will go. He is the cardinal camerlengo, after all. As for me, I would go if I thought I would see you there.\"  His head drew down toward hers. \"Do you care for me that much?\"  \"I have never known love like this, Simon. My husband was kind to me, and I was sorry when he died, but the way I feel about you is different. I think I will die if I do not know when I can see you again.\"  Joy lit up his thin face, and she despised herself. \"I will find you, Sophia. I will be gone for months. But I will ride like the wind, and when I come back it will be to Perugia.\"  _He must be going to France!_ He was traveling with but one man, so as to go faster. The Tartars had nearly been killed in the Filippeschi uprising, but he would be leaving them for _months_.  Only one thing could be more important to Simon than the lives of the two Tartars, and that was what the Tartars represented.  The pope must be offering to approve the alliance. Simon must be carrying the message.  _When I tell David about this, he will ride after Simon and kill him._  Her thoughts began to race. Even if Simon were stopped, was it not still too late to keep the Franks and the Tartars from joining forces? No, probably not, because the pope was dying. If this alliance were not settled now, the talking and deciding would have to begin all over again, with a new pope.  Could she seduce Simon into abandoning his mission altogether, running off with her? No, he would never betray so great a trust, not even for love of her.  \"I swear to you, I will find you, I will see you again, Sophia,\" he was saying. \"Believe me.\"  _You will not live long enough._  \"I do believe you, Simon.\" Her loathing for herself grew stronger.  Now his arms were around her, and he was pressing her back, away from the tree trunk and down onto the soft bed of pine needles.  His open mouth was against hers, his lips devouring hers. His hands caressed her shoulders and her back, moving ceaselessly. One hand slid around and held her breast, and she heard his little indrawn breath of pleasure. It must feel good to him, she thought. It felt good to be touched there, and she pushed back against his hand. She felt her body relax and grow warm. It had been so long--nearly a year--since a man had held her in his arms.  _I need this as much as any man does. Men can go to whores, but where can I go?_  She loved the feel of his strong arms around her as she lay beside him. He moved so that his whole length was pressed against her, and now he did not seem any taller than she was. She felt the hardness at his groin that he pressed against her leg, and she felt an answering heat within herself.  _No!_  _I cannot let this man make love to me and then send David after him to kill him. I cannot, I cannot. I would hate myself forever._  She felt her body opening to him, felt her bone-deep need of him. If they came together now, it would be love, not the love she felt for David, but love even so. And if she condemned him to death then, she would destroy herself. But if she did not tell David where Simon was going, she would betray him, and bring ruin down on his people and her own. If she let Simon make love to her, she would be so torn that afterward she would probably go mad.  He was already partly on top of her, and she wriggled away from him, pushing at him.  \"Stop it!\" There was a power in her voice that she had not intended to unleash. She was no longer Cardinal Ugolini's sweet little niece, Sophia Orfali from Sicily, but Sophia Karaiannides, the woman of Byzantium.  A hand's width of space separated their faces. Her voice seemed to freeze him. He stared at her as if he were seeing a stranger.  Then anger blazed up in his eyes. His arms tightened. Those arms seemed so lean, but the strength in them was like steel chains drawn tight. She clenched her fists and locked her bent arms in front of her to keep him away. His lips drew back from his teeth and she felt his hot breath on her face.  _Frankish barbarian!_ she thought. Where only a moment ago she had wanted him, now she hated him. He was just like all those mail-clad savages who had destroyed Constantinople, stolen, raped, murdered her parents. Yes, and she had helped the Basileus Michael to drive them out, and she would kill this one too. Never would a union of Frankish and Tartar barbarians threaten her people. By this one man's death she could guarantee that.  With all the strength her anger gave her, she straightened her arms, pushing him away. Her right arm free, she thrust her open palm against his jaw, forcing his head back.  \"Let me go!\" And again it was the powerful voice of Sophia Karaiannides.  \"God's blood!\" His eyes were wide, and there was amazement in them, no longer anger. He released her so suddenly she fell back, hard, against the floor of the forest.  Immediately he reached for her, but his hands were gentle once more, helping her to sit up.  He knelt before her. \"Please forgive me.\" He sounded on the verge of tears. \"Please. I lost command of myself.\"  Standing up, she brushed pine needles from the back of her skirt and her shawl. He moved to help her, and she pulled away.  \"Sophia, I have never loved any woman as much as I love you.\"  \"Nonsense. Simon, you have far to ride.\"  He moved around so that he was facing her, his usually pale face flushed, his chest heaving.  \"Marry me, Sophia.\"  If he had struck her, she could not have been more astonished. But she quickly recovered herself. He thought he could have his way with her by offering marriage.  \"Simon, I am not a woman whose legs can be parted by a promise of marriage.\" The note she heard in her voice distressed her. She was being too much her true, worldly self with him. If he were not deaf to everything but his own passion, he would hear it, and he would suspect that she was not what she seemed to be.  She reminded herself: _I must seem to be awed that this great nobleman speaks to me of marriage._  \"You put it crudely,\" he said, his eyes narrowed with warmth. \"To shock me, I suppose. But you defend your honor, and you speak plainly. I speak plainly too--I love you.\"  The sight of him standing there gazing at her with such yearning in his eyes was too painful. She kept thinking of herself telling David what she had learned today. She kept seeing this tall, handsome man lying dead in a ditch. She had to get away from him.  \"The morning is well along,\" she said. \"You had better get started if you want to cover much distance by nightfall. Where do you plan to spend this night?\" She despised herself because she had asked the question to make it easier for David to trail him.  He frowned at her. \"Sophia, I must have your answer. I mean what I say. I love you. I want to marry you.\"  Holy Virgin, would the fellow never give in? Did he really think her foolish enough to believe he was sincerely proposing to her? Yes, perhaps he"]]]
