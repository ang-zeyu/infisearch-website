That nation declared--       \"All the gods of the people are idols: but the Lord made the      heavens.\"  For that same nation the watchword was--       \"Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God is one Lord.\"  From these words the Hebrews not only learned a great spiritual truth, but derived intellectual freedom. For by these words they were taught that all the host of heaven and of earth were created things--merely \"things,\" not divinities--and not only that, but that the Creator was One God, not many gods; that there was but one law-giver; and that therefore there could be no conflict of laws. These first words of Genesis, then, may be called the charter of all the physical sciences, for by them is conferred freedom from all the bonds of unscientific superstition, and by them also do men know that consistent law holds throughout the whole universe. It is the intellectual freedom of the Hebrew that the scientist of to-day inherits. He may not indeed be able to rise to the spiritual standpoint of the Hebrew, and consciously acknowledge that--       \"Thou, even Thou, art Lord alone; Thou hast made heaven, the      heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all      things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein,      and Thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven      worshippeth Thee.\"  But he must at least unconsciously assent to it, for it is on the first great fundamental assumption of religion as stated in the first words of Genesis, that the fundamental assumption of all his scientific reasoning depends.  Scientific reasoning and scientific observation can only hold good so long and in so far as the Law of Causality holds good. We must assume a pre-existing state of affairs which has given rise to the observed effect; we must assume that this observed effect is itself antecedent to a subsequent state of affairs. Science therefore cannot go back to the absolute beginnings of things, or forward to the absolute ends of things. It cannot reason about the way matter and energy came into existence, or how they might cease to exist; it cannot reason about time or space, as such, but only in the relations of these to phenomena that can be observed. It does not deal with things themselves, but only with the relations between things. Science indeed can only consider the universe as a great machine which is in \"going order,\" and it concerns itself with the relations which some parts of the machine bear to other parts, and with the laws and manner of the \"going\" of the machine in those parts. The relations of the various parts, one to the other, and the way in which they work together, may afford some idea of the design and purpose of the machine, but it can give no information as to how the material of which it is composed came into existence, nor as to the method by which it was originally constructed. Once started, the machine comes under the scrutiny of science, but the actual starting lies outside its scope.  Men therefore cannot find out for themselves how the worlds were originally made, how the worlds were first moved, or how the spirit of man was first formed within him; and this, not merely because these beginnings of things were of necessity outside his experience, but also because beginnings, as such, must lie outside the law by which he reasons.  By no process of research, therefore, could man find out for himself the facts that are stated in the first chapter of Genesis. They must have been revealed. Science cannot inquire into them for the purpose of checking their accuracy; it must accept them, as it accepts the fundamental law that governs its own working, without the possibility of proof.  And this is what has been revealed to man:--that the heaven and the earth were not self-existent from all eternity, but were in their first beginning created by God. As the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews expresses it: \"Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.\" And a further fact was revealed that man could not have found out for himself; viz. that this creation was made and finished in six Divine actings, comprised in what the narrative denominates \"days.\" It has not been revealed whether the duration of these \"days\" can be expressed in any astronomical units of time.  Since under these conditions science can afford no information, it is not to be wondered at that the hypotheses that have been framed from time to time to \"explain\" the first chapter of Genesis, or to express it in scientific terms, are not wholly satisfactory. At one time the chapter was interpreted to mean that the entire universe was called into existence about 6,000 years ago, in six days of twenty-four hours each. Later it was recognized that both geology and astronomy seemed to indicate the existence of matter for untold millions of years instead of some six thousand. It was then pointed out that, so far as the narrative was concerned, there might have been a period of almost unlimited duration between its first verse and its fourth; and it was suggested that the six days of creation were six days of twenty-four hours each, in which, after some great cataclysm, 6,000 years ago, the face of the earth was renewed and replenished for the habitation of man, the preceding geological ages being left entirely unnoticed. Some writers have confined the cataclysm and renewal to a small portion of the earth's surface--to \"Eden,\" and its neighbourhood. Other commentators have laid stress on the truth revealed in Scripture that \"one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day,\" and have urged the argument that the six days of creation were really vast periods of time, during which the earth's geological changes and the evolution of its varied forms of life were running their course. Others, again, have urged that the six days of creation were six literal days, but instead of being consecutive were separated by long ages. And yet again, as no man was present during the creation period, it has been suggested that the Divine revelation of it was given to Moses or some other inspired prophet in six successive visions or dreams, which constituted the \"six days\" in which the chief facts of creation were set forth.  All such hypotheses are based on the assumption that the opening chapters of Genesis are intended to reveal to man certain physical details in the material history of this planet; to be in fact a little compendium of the geological and zoological history of the world, and so a suitable introduction to the history of the early days of mankind which followed it.  It is surely more reasonable to conclude that there was no purpose whatever of teaching us anything about the physical relationships of land and sea, of tree and plant, of bird and fish; it seems, indeed, scarcely conceivable that it should have been the Divine intention so to supply the ages with a condensed manual of the physical sciences. What useful purpose could it have served? What man would have been the wiser or better for it? Who could have understood it until the time when men, by their own intellectual strivings, had attained sufficient knowledge of their physical surroundings to do without such a revelation at all?  But although the opening chapters of Genesis were not designed to teach the Hebrew certain physical facts of nature, they gave him the knowledge that he might lawfully study nature. For he learnt from them that nature has no power nor vitality of its own; that sun, and sea, and cloud, and wind are not separate deities, nor the expression of deities that they are but \"things,\" however glorious and admirable; that they are the handiwork of God; and--       \"The works of the Lord are great,         Sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.       His work is honour and majesty;         And His righteousness endureth for ever.       He hath made His wonderful works to be remembered.\"  What, then, is the significance of the detailed account given us of the works effected on the successive days of creation? Why are we told that light was made on the first day, the firmament on the second, dry land on the third, and so on? Probably for two reasons. First, that the rehearsal, as in a catalogue, of the leading classes of natural objects, might give definiteness and precision to the teaching that each and all were creatures, things made by the word of God. The bald statement that the heaven and the earth were made by God might still have left room for the imagination that the powers of nature were co-eternal with God, or were at least subordinate divinities; or that other powers than God had worked up into the present order the materials He had created. The detailed account makes it clear that not only was the universe in general created by God, but that there was no part of it that was not fashioned by Him.  The next purpose was to set a seal of sanctity upon the Sabbath. In the second chapter of Genesis we read--       \"On the seventh day God ended His work which He had made; and      He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had      made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it:      because that in it He had rested from all His work which God      created and made.\"  In this we get the institution of the _week_, the first ordinance imposed by God upon man. For in the fourth of the ten commandments which God gave through Moses, it is said--       \"The seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it      thou shalt not do any work. . . . For in six days the Lord      made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and      rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath      day, and hallowed it.\"  And again, when the tabernacle was being builded, it was commanded--       \"The children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the   "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28536"],["title","The Astronomy of the Bible (#5)"],["body","   sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual      covenant. It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel      for ever: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and      on the seventh day He rested, and was refreshed.\"  God made the sun, moon, and stars, and appointed them \"for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years.\" The sun marks out the days; the moon by her changes makes the months; the sun and the stars mark out the seasons and the years. These were divisions of time which man would naturally adopt. But there is not an exact number of days in the month, nor an exact number of days or months in the year. Still less does the period of seven days fit precisely into month or season or year; the week is marked out by no phase of the moon, by no fixed relation between the sun, the moon, or the stars. It is not a division of time that man would naturally adopt for himself; it runs across all the natural divisions of time.  What are the six days of creative work, and the seventh day--the Sabbath--of creative rest? They are not days of man, they are days of God; and our days of work and rest, our week with its Sabbath, can only be the figure and shadow of that week of God; something by which we may gain some faint apprehension of its realities, not that by which we can comprehend and measure it.  Our week, therefore, is God's own direct appointment to us; and His revelation that He fulfilled the work of creation in six acts or stages, dignifies and exalts the toil of the labouring man, with his six days of effort and one of rest, into an emblem of the creative work of God.

If this theory were substantiated, it would have such an important bearing upon the subject of the attitude of the inspired writers towards the objects of nature, that a little space must be spared for its examination.  The purpose of the first chapter of Genesis is to tell us that--       \"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.\"  From it we learn that the universe and all the parts that make it up--all the different forms of energy, all the different forms of matter--are neither deities themselves, nor their embodiments and expressions, nor the work of conflicting deities. From it we learn that the universe is not self-existent, nor even (as the pantheist thinks of it) the expression of one vague, impersonal and unconscious, but all-pervading influence. It was not self-made; it did not exist from all eternity. It is not God, for God made it.  But the problem of its origin has exercised the minds of many nations beside the Hebrews, and an especial interest attaches to the solution arrived at by those nations who were near neighbours of the Hebrews and came of the same great Semitic stock.  From the nature of the case, accounts of the origin of the world cannot proceed from experience, or be the result of scientific experiment. They cannot form items of history, or arise from tradition. There are only two possible sources for them; one, Divine revelation; the other, the invention of men.  The account current amongst the Babylonians has been preserved to us by the Syrian writer Damascius, who gives it as follows:--       \"But the Babylonians, like the rest of the Barbarians, pass      over in silence the one principle of the Universe, and they      constitute two, Tavthê and Apasôn, making Apasôn the husband      of Tavthê, and denominating her \"the mother of the gods.\" And      from these proceeds an only-begotten son, Mumis, which, I      conceive, is no other than the intelligible world proceeding      from the two principles. From them also another progeny is      derived, Lakhê and Lakhos; and again a third, Kissarê and      Assôros, from which last three others proceed, Anos and      Illinos and Aos. And of Aos and Dakhê is born a son called      Bêlos, who, they say, is the fabricator of the world.\"[26:1]  The actual story, thus summarized by Damascius, was discovered by Mr. George Smith, in the form of a long epic poem, on a series of tablets, brought from the royal library of Kouyunjik, or Nineveh, and he published them in 1875, in his book on _The Chaldean Account of Genesis_. None of the tablets were perfect; and of some only very small portions remain. But portions of other copies of the poem have been discovered in other localities, and it has been found possible to piece together satisfactorily a considerable section, so that a fair idea of the general scope of the poem has been given to us.  It opens with the introduction of a being, Tiamtu--the Tavthê of the account of Damascius,--who is regarded as the primeval mother of all things.       \"When on high the heavens were unnamed,       Beneath the earth bore not a name:       The primeval ocean was their producer;       Mummu Tiamtu was she who begot the whole of them.       Their waters in one united themselves, and       The plains were not outlined, marshes were not to be seen.       When none of the gods had come forth,       They bore no name, the fates (had not been determined)       There were produced the gods (all of them).\"[27:1]  The genealogy of the gods follows, and after a gap in the story, Tiamat, or Tiamtu, is represented as preparing for battle, \"She who created everything . . . produced giant serpents.\" She chose one of the gods, Kingu, to be her husband and the general of her forces, and delivered to him the tablets of fate.  The second tablet shows the god Anšar, angered at the threatening attitude of Tiamat, and sending his son Anu to speak soothingly to her and calm her rage. But first Anu and then another god turned back baffled, and finally Merodach, the son of Ea, was asked to become the champion of the gods. Merodach gladly consented, but made good terms for himself. The gods were to assist him in every possible way by entrusting all their powers to him, and were to acknowledge him as first and chief of all. The gods in their extremity were nothing loth. They feasted Merodach and, when swollen with wine, endued him with all magical powers, and hailed him--       \"Merodach, thou art he who is our avenger,       (Over) the whole universe have we given thee the kingdom.\"[28:1]  At first the sight of his terrible enemy caused even Merodach to falter, but plucking up courage he advanced to meet her, caught her in his net, and, forcing an evil wind into her open mouth--       \"He made the evil wind enter so that she could not close her lips.       The violence of the winds tortured her stomach, and       her heart was prostrated and her mouth was twisted.       He swung the club, he shattered her stomach;       he cut out her entrails; he over-mastered (her) heart;       he bound her and ended her life.       He threw down her corpse; he stood upon it.\"[28:2]  The battle over and the enemy slain, Merodach considered how to dispose of the corpse.       \"He strengthens his mind, he forms a clever plan,       And he stripped her of her skin like a fish, according to his           plan.\"[28:3]  Of one half of the corpse of Tiamat he formed the earth, and of the other half, the heavens. He then proceded to furnish the heavens and the earth with their respective equipments; the details of this work occupying apparently the fifth, sixth, and seventh tablets of the series.  Under ordinary circumstances such a legend as the foregoing would not have attracted much attention. It is as barbarous and unintelligent as any myth of Zulu or Fijian. Strictly speaking, it is not a Creation myth at all. Tiamat and her serpent-brood and the gods are all existent before Merodach commences his work, and all that the god effects is a reconstruction of the world. The method of this reconstruction possesses no features superior to those of the Creation myths of other barbarous nations. Our own Scandinavian ancestors had a similar one, the setting of which was certainly not inferior to the grotesque battle of Merodach with Tiamat. The prose Edda tells us that the first man, Bur, was the father of Bör, who was in turn the father of Odin and his two brothers Vili and Ve. These sons of Bör slew Ymir, the old frost giant.       \"They dragged the body of Ymir into the middle of Ginnungagap,      and of it formed the earth. From Ymir's blood they made the      sea and waters; from his flesh, the land; from his bones, the      mountains; and his teeth and jaws, together with some bits of      broken bones, served them to make the stones and pebbles.\"  It will be seen that there is a remarkable likeness between the Babylonian and Scandinavian myths in the central and essential feature of each, viz. the way in which the world is supposed to have been built up by the gods from the fragments of the anatomy of a huge primæval monster. Yet it is not urged that there is any direct genetic connection between the two; that the Babylonians either taught their legend to the Scandinavians or learnt it from them.  Under ordinary circumstances it would hardly have occurred to any one to try to derive the monotheistic narrative of Gen. i. from either of these pagan myths, crowded as they are with uncouth and barbarous details. But it happened that Mr. George Smith, who brought"]]]
