Therefore it would seem that, in abandoning his business, he had abandoned his  chance of Barbara also, which was a truly dreadful thought.    Well, it was in order that he might see her, that he had agreed to visit The  Court on the morrow, even though it meant a meeting with his late partners, who  were the last people with whom he desired to foregather again so soon. Then and  there he made up his mind that before he bade Barbara farewell, he would tell  her the whole story, so that she might not misjudge him. After that he would go  off somewhere—to Africa perhaps. Meanwhile he was quite tired out, as  tired as though he had lain a week in the grip of fever. He must eat some food  and get to bed. Sufficient unto the day was the evil thereof, yet on the whole  he blessed the name of Jackson, editor of _The Judge_ and his  father’s old friend.    When Alan had left the office Sir Robert turned to Mr. Champers-Haswell and  asked him abruptly, “What the devil does this mean?”  Mr. Haswell looked up at the ceiling and whistled in his own peculiar fashion,  then answered:  “I cannot say for certain, but our young friend’s strange conduct seems to suggest that he has smelt a rat, possibly even that Jackson, the old  beast, has shown him a rat—of a large Turkish breed.”  Sir Robert nodded.  “Vernon is a fellow who doesn’t like rats; they seem to haunt his sleep,” he said; “but do you think that having seen it, he will keep it in the bag?”  “Oh! certainly, certainly,” answered Mr. Haswell with cheerfulness; “the man is the soul of honour; he will never give us away. Look how he behaved about those shares. Still, I think that perhaps we are well rid of him.  Too much honour, like too much zeal, is a very dangerous quality in any  business.”  “I don’t know that I agree with you,” answered Sir Robert. “I am not sure that in the long run we should not do better for a little more of the article. For my part, although it will not hurt us publicly, for  the thing will never be noticed, I am sorry that we have lost Vernon, very  sorry indeed. I don’t think him a fool, and awkward as they may be, I  respect his qualities.”  “So do I, so do I,” answered Mr. Haswell, “and of course we have acted against his advice throughout, which must have been annoying to him.  The scheme as he suggested it was a fair business proposition that might have  paid ten per cent. on a small capital, but what is the good of ten per cent. to  you and me? We want millions and we are going to get them. Well, he is coming  to The Court to-morrow, and perhaps after all we shall be able to arrange  matters. I’ll give Barbara a hint; she has great influence with him, and  you might do the same, Aylward.”    “Miss Champers has great influence with everyone who is fortunate enough to know her,” answered Sir Robert courteously. “But even if she chooses to use it, I doubt if it will avail in this case. Vernon has been  making up his mind for a long while. I have watched him and am sure of that.  To-night he determined to take the plunge and I do not think that we shall see  any more of him in this office. Haswell,” he added with sudden energy,  “I tell you that of late our luck has been too good to last. The boom,  the real boom, came in with Vernon, and with Vernon I think that it will  go.”  “At any rate it must leave something pretty substantial behind it this time, Aylward, my friend. Whatever happens, within a week we shall be rich,  really rich for life.”  “For life, Haswell, yes, for life. But what is life? A bubble that any pin may prick. Oh! I know that you do not like the subject, but it is as well  to look it in the face sometimes. I’m no church-goer, but if I remember  right we were taught to pray the good Lord to deliver us especially ‘in  all times of our wealth,’ which is followed by something about  tribulation and sudden death, for when they wrote that prayer the wheel of  human fortune went round just as it does to-day. There, let’s get out of  this before I grow superstitious, as men who believe in nothing sometimes do,  because after all they must believe in something, I suppose. Got your hat and  coat? So have I, come on,” and he switched off the light, so that the  room was left in darkness except for the faint glimmering of the fire.    His partner grumbled audibly, for in turning he had knocked his hand against  the desk.  “Leave me my only economy, Haswell,” he answered with a hard little laugh. “Electricity is strength and I hate to see strength burning to waste. Why do you mind?” he went on as he stepped towards the door. “Is it the contrast? In all times of our wealth, in all times of our tribulation, from sickness and from sudden death——”  “Good Lord deliver us,” chimed in Mr. Haswell in a shaking voice behind him. “What the devil’s that?”  Sir Robert looked round and saw, or thought that he saw, something very strange. From the pillar on which it stood the golden fetish with a woman’s face, appeared to have floated. The firelight showed it gliding towards them across, but a few inches above the floor of the great room. It  came very slowly, but it came. Now it reached them and paused, and now it rose  into the air until it attained the height of Mr. Champers-Haswell and stayed  there, staring into his face and not a hand’s breadth away, just as  though it were a real woman glaring at him.    He uttered a sound, half whistle and half groan, and fell back, as it chanced  on to a morocco-covered seat behind him. For a moment or two the gleaming,  golden mask floated in the air. Then it turned very deliberately, rose a little  way, and moving sidelong to where Sir Robert stood, hung in front of _his_  face.  Presently Aylward staggered to the mantelpiece and began to fumble for the  switch; in the silence his nails scratching at the panelling made a sound like  to that of a gnawing mouse. He found it at last, and next instant the office  broke into a blaze of light, showing Mr. Haswell, his rubicund face quite pale,  his hat and umbrella on the floor, gasping like a dying man upon the couch, and  Sir Robert himself clinging to the mantel-shelf as a person might do who had  received a mortal wound, while the golden fetish reposed calmly on its pillar,  to all appearance as immovable and undisturbed as the antique Venus which  matched it at the other end of the room. For a while there was silence. Then  Sir Robert, recovering himself, asked:    “Did you notice anything unusual just now, Haswell?”  “Yes,” whispered his partner. “I thought that hideous African thing which Vernon brought here, came sliding across the floor and stared into  my face with its glittering eyes, and in the eyes——”  “Well, what was in the eyes?”  “I can’t remember. It was a kind of picture and the meaning of it was Sudden Death—oh Lord! Sudden Death. Tell me it was a fancy bred of that ill-omened talk of yours?”  “I can’t tell you anything of the sort,” answered Aylward in a hollow voice, “for I saw something also.”  “What?” asked his partner.  “Death that wasn’t sudden, and other things.”  Again the silence fell till it was broken by Aylward.  “Come,” he said, “we have been over-working—too much strain, and now the reaction. Keep this rubbish to yourself, or they will lock  you up in an asylum.”  “Certainly, Aylward, certainly. But can’t you get rid of that beastly image?”  “Not on any account, Haswell, even if it haunts us all day. Here it shall  stop until the Saharas are floated on Monday, if I have to lock it in the  strongroom and throw the keys into the Thames. Afterwards Vernon can take it,  as he has a right to do, and I am sure that with it will go our luck.”    “Then the sooner our luck goes, the better,” replied Haswell, with a mere ghost of his former whistle. “Life is better than luck, and—Aylward, that Yellow God you are so fond of means to murder us. We are being fatted for the sacrifice, that is all. I remember now, that was one  of the things I saw written in its eyes!”     CHAPTER III.  JEEKIE TELLS A TALE.   The Court, Mr. Champers-Haswell’s place, was a very fine house indeed, of  a sort. That is, it contained twenty-nine bedrooms, each of them with a  bathroom attached, a large number of sitting-rooms, ample garages, stables, and  offices, the whole surrounded by several acres of newly-planted gardens.  Incidentally it may be mentioned that it was built in the most atrocious taste  and looked like a suburban villa seen through a magnifying glass.    It was in this matter of taste that it differed from Sir Robert Aylward’s  home, Old Hall, a few miles away. Not that this was old either, for the  original house had fallen down or been burnt a hundred years before. But Sir  Robert, being gifted with artistic perception, had reared up in place of it a  smaller but really beautiful dwelling of soft grey stone, long and low, and  built in the Tudor style with many gables.    This house, charming as it was, could not of course compare with Yarleys, the  ancient seat of the Vernons in the same neighbourhood. Yarleys was pure  Elizabethan, although it contained an oak-roofed hall which was said to date  back to the time of King John, a remnant of a former house. There was no  electric light or other modern convenience at Yarleys, yet it was a place that  everyone went to see because of its exceeding beauty and its historical  associations. The moat by which it was surrounded, the grass court within, for  it was built on three sides of a square, the mullioned windows, the towered  gateway of red brick, the low-panelled rooms hung with the portraits of  departed Vernons, the sloping park and the splendid oaks that stood about,  singly or in groups, were all of them perfect in their way. It was one of the  most lovely of English homes, and oddly enough its neglected "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2857"],["title","A Yellow God: An Idol of Africa (#6)"],["body","and the  air of decay that pervaded it, added to rather than decreased its charm.      But it is with The Court that we have to do at present, not with Yarleys. Mr.  Champers-Haswell had a week-end party. There were ten guests, all men, and with  the exception of Alan, who it will be remembered was one of them, all rich and  in business. They included two French bankers and three Jews, everyone a prop  of the original Sahara Syndicate and deeply interested in the forthcoming  flotation. To describe them is unnecessary, for they have no part in our story,  being only financiers of a certain class, remarkable for the riches they had  acquired by means that for the most part would not bear examination. The riches  were evident enough. Ever since the morning the owners of this wealth had  arrived by ones or twos in their costly motorcars, attended by smart chauffeurs  and valets. Their fur coats, their jewelled studs and rings, something in their  very faces suggested money, which indeed was the bond that brought and held  them together.    Alan did not come until it was time to dress for dinner, for he knew that  Barbara would not appear before that meal, and it was her society he sought,  not that of his host or fellow guests. Accompanied by his negro servant,  Jeekie, for in a house like this it was necessary to have someone to wait upon  him, he drove over from Yarleys, a distance of ten miles, arriving about eight  o’clock.  “Mr. Haswell has gone up to dress, Major, and so have the other gentlemen,” said the head butler, Mr. Smith, “but Miss Champers told me to give you this note and to say that dinner is at half-past eight.”  Alan took the note and asked to be shown to his room. Once there, although he  had only five-and-twenty minutes, he opened it eagerly, while Jeekie unpacked  his bag.  “Dear Alan,” it ran: “Don’t be late for dinner, or I may not be able to keep a place next to me. Of course Sir Robert takes me in.  They are a worse lot than usual this time, odious—odious!—and I can’t stand one on the left hand as well as on the right. Yours,  “B.  “P.S. What _have_ you been doing? Our distinguished guests, to say nothing of my uncle, seem to be in a great fuss about you. I overheard them  talking when I was pretending to arrange some flowers. One of them called you a  sanctimonious prig and an obstinate donkey, and another answered—I think  it was Sir Robert —‘No doubt, but obstinate donkeys can kick and  have been known to upset other people’s applecarts ere now.’ Is the  Sahara Syndicate the applecart? If so, I’ll forgive you.  “P.P.S. Remember that we will walk to church together to-morrow, but come  down to breakfast in knickerbockers or something to put them off, and  I’ll do the same—I mean I’ll dress as if I were going to golf. We can turn into Christians later. If we don’t—dress like that, I mean—they’ll guess and all want to come to church, except the Jews, which would bring the judgment of Heaven on us.  “P.P.P.S. Don’t be careless and leave this note lying about, for the under-footman who waits upon you reads all the letters. He steams them over  a kettle. Smith the butler is the only respectable man in this house.”    Alan laughed outright as he finished this peculiar and outspoken epistle, which  somehow revived his spirits, that since the previous day had been low enough.  It refreshed him. It was like a breath of frosty air from an open window  blowing clean and cold into a scented, overheated room. He would have liked to  keep it, but remembering Barbara’s injunctions and the under-footman,  threw it onto the fire and watched it burn. Jeekie coughed to intimate that it  was time for his master to dress, and Alan turned and looked at him in an  absent-minded fashion.    He was worth looking at, was Jeekie. Let the reader imagine a very tall and  powerfully-built negro with a skin as black as a well-polished boot, woolly  hair as white as snow, a little tufted beard also white, a hand like a leg of  mutton, but with long delicate fingers and pink, filbert-shaped nails, an  immovable countenance, but set in it beneath a massive brow, two extraordinary  humorous and eloquent black eyes which expressed every emotion passing through  the brain behind them, that is when their owner chose to allow them to do so.  Such was Jeekie.  “Shall I unlace your boots, Major?” he said in his full, melodious voice and speaking the most perfect English. “I expect that the gong will  sound in nine and a half minutes.”  “Then let it sound and be hanged to it,” answered Alan; “no, I forgot—I must hurry. Jeekie, put that fire out and open all the windows  as soon as I go down. This room is like a hot-house.”  “Yes, Major, the fire shall be extinguished and the sleeping-chamber ventilated. The other boot, if you please, Major.”  “Jeekie,” said Alan, “who is stopping in this place? Have you heard?”  “I collected some names on my way upstairs, Major. Three of the gentlemen  you have never met before, but,” he added suddenly breaking away from his  high-flown book-learned English, as was his custom when in earnest,  “Jeekie think they just black niggers like the rest, thief people. There  ain’t a white man in this house, except you and Miss Barbara and me,  Major. Jeekie learnt all that in servant’s hall palaver. No, not now,  other time. Everyone tell everything to Jeekie, poor old African fool, and he  look up an answer, ‘O law! you don’t say so?’ but keep his  eyes and ears open all the same.”  “I’ll be bound you do, Jeekie,” replied Alan, laughing again. “Well, go on keeping them open, and give me those trousers.”  “Yes, Major,” answered Jeekie, reassuming his grand manner, “I shall continue to collect information which may prove to your advantage, but personally I wish that you were clear of the whole caboodle,  except Miss Barbara.”  “Hear, hear,” ejaculated Alan, “there goes the gong. Mind you come in and help to wait,” and hurrying into his coat he departed downstairs.  The guests were gathered in the hall drinking sherry and bitters, a proceeding  that to Alan’s mind set a stamp upon the house. His host, Mr.  Champers-Haswell, came forward and greeted him with much affectionate  enthusiasm, and Alan noticed that he looked very pale, also that his thoughts  seemed to be wandering, for he introduced a French banker to him as a noted  Jew, and the noted Jew as the French banker, although the distinction between  them was obvious and the gentlemen concerned evidently resented the mistake.  Sir Robert Aylward, catching sight of him, came across the hall in his usual,  direct fashion, and shook him by the hand.    “Glad to see you, Vernon,” he said, fixing his piercing eyes upon Alan as though he were trying to read his thoughts. “Pleasant change this  from the City and all that eternal business, isn’t it? Ah! you are thinking that one is not quite clear of business after all,” and he glanced round at the company. “That’s one of your cousin Haswell’s faults; he can never shake himself free of the thing, never get  any real recreation. I’d bet you a sovereign that he has a stenographer  waiting by a telephone in the next room, just in case any opportunity should  arise in the course of conversation. That is magnificent, but it is not wise.  His heart can’t stand it; it will wear him out before his time. Listen,  they are all talking about the Sahara. I wish I were there; it must be quiet at  any rate. The sands beneath, the eternal stars above. Yes, I wish I were  there,” he repeated with a sigh, and Alan noted that although his face  could not be more pallid than its natural colour, it looked quite worn and old.    “So do I,” he answered with enthusiasm.  Then a French gentleman on his left, having discovered that he was the engineer  who had formulated the great flooding scheme, began to address him as  “Cher maitre,” speaking so rapidly in his own language that Alan,  whose French was none of the best, struggled after him in vain. Whilst he was  trying to answer a question which he did not understand, the door at the end of  the hall opened, and through it appeared Barbara Champers.    It was a large hall and she was a long way off, which caused her to look small,  who indeed was only of middle height. Yet even at that distance it was  impossible to mistake the dignity of her appearance. A slim woman with brown  hair, cheerful brown eyes, a well-modelled face, a rounded figure and an  excellent complexion, such was Barbara. Ten thousand young ladies could be  found as good, or even better looking, yet something about her differentiated  her from the majority of her sex. There was determination in her step, and  overflowing health and vigour in her every movement. Her eyes had a trick of  looking straight into any other eyes they met, not boldly, but with a kind of  virginal fearlessness and enterprise that people often found embarrassing.  Indeed she was extremely virginal and devoid of the usual fringe of feminine  airs and graces, a nymph of the woods and waters, who although she was three  and twenty, as yet recked little of men save as companions whom she liked or  disliked according to her instincts. For the rest she was sweetly dressed in a  white robe with silver on it, and wore no ornaments save a row of small pearls  about her throat and some lilies of the valley at her breast.      Barbara came straight onwards, looking neither to the right nor to the left,  till she reached her uncle, to whom she nodded. Then she walked to Alan and,  offering him her hand, said:  “How do you do! Why did you not come over at lunch time? I wanted to play  a round of golf with you this afternoon.”  Alan answered something about being busy at Yarleys.  “Yarleys!” she replied. “I thought that you lived in the City now, making money out of speculations, like everyone else that I know.”  “Why, Miss Champers,” broke in Sir Robert reproachfully, “I asked you to play a round of golf before tea and you would not.”  “No"]]]
