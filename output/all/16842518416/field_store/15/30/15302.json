In 1774 a new house had been engaged, which had \"more room for workshops,\" and whose roof gave space for observing. The grass-plat near it was soon utilized to hold the stand of a twenty-foot telescope, which he had even then projected. His projects were unending, no success was final; his mind was at the height of activity; his whole effort was thrown into every undertaking.  The mirrors for all these telescopes were made by hand. Every portion of the grinding down to rough dimensions, the shaping to something near the correct form, the polishing till the accurately exact curves were obtained, all this must be done by hand. The machines for the purpose were not invented until 1788.[11]  ALEXANDER and WILLIAM worked together at this, but most of the work was done by the latter. The sister's part was to attend in the workshop and lend a hand wherever and whenever it was needed.      . . . \"My time was taken up with copying music and practising, besides     attendance on my brother when polishing, since by way of keeping him     alive I was constantly obliged to feed him by putting the victuals by     bits into his mouth. This was once the case when, in order to finish     a seven-foot mirror, he had not taken his hands from it for sixteen     hours together. In general he was never unemployed at meals, but was     always at those times contriving or making drawings of whatever     came in his mind. Generally I was obliged to read to him whilst     he was at the turning-lathe, or polishing mirrors, _Don Quixote_,     _Arabian Nights' Entertainment_, the novels of STERNE, FIELDING,     etc.; serving tea and supper without interrupting the work with     which he was engaged, . . . and sometimes lending a hand. I became,     in time, as useful a member of the workshop as a boy might be to     his master in the first year of his apprenticeship. . . . But as     I was to take a part the next year in the oratorios, I had, for a     whole twelvemonth, two lessons per week from Miss FLEMING, the     celebrated dancing-mistress, to drill me for a gentlewoman (God     knows how she succeeded). So we lived on without interruption.     My brother ALEX. was absent from Bath for some months every summer,     but when at home he took much pleasure in executing some turning or     clockmaker's work for his brother.\"  News from Hanover put a sudden stop, for a time, to all these labors. The mother wrote, in the utmost distress, to say that DIETRICH had disappeared from his home, it was supposed with the intention of going to India \"with a young idler not older than himself.\" His brother immediately left the lathe at which he was turning an eye-piece in cocoa-nut, and started for Holland, whence he proceeded to Hanover, failing to meet his brother, as he expected. Meanwhile the sister received a letter to say that DIETRICH was \"laid up very ill\" at an inn in Wapping. ALEXANDER posted to town, removed him to a lodging, and, after a fortnight's nursing, brought him to Bath, where, on his brother WILLIAM'S return, he found him being well cared for by his sister.  About this time another change was made to the house 19 New King Street, which was the last move in Bath. It was here that the _Georgium Sidus_ was discovered.  The music still went on. The oratorios of the _Messiah_, _Judas Maccabeus_, and _Samson_ were to be performed under HERSCHEL'S direction, with an orchestra of nearly one hundred pieces. The scores and vocal parts of these CAROLINA copied with her own hands, and the _soprani_ were instructed by her, she being the leading soloist. Along with the music went the astronomy. Not only were new telescopes made, but they were made for immediate use.  The variable star _Mira Ceti_ was observed, and a long series of lunar observations begun.      \"In 1779, 1780, and 1781 I measured the heights of about one hundred     mountains of the moon, by three different methods.      \"Some of these observations are given in _Philosophical     Transactions_, vol. LXX., but most remain uncalculated in my journal     _till some proper opportunity.\"[12]_  While HERSCHEL was measuring these lunar mountains, in December, 1779, he made by chance an acquaintance of much value to him. Dr. WILLIAM WATSON, a Fellow of the Royal Society, distinguished for his researches in electricity, happened to see him at his telescope, and this led to a visit and an invitation to HERSCHEL to join the Philosophical Society of Bath, then forming. This he gladly did, and it was of use to him in many ways.  He there formed acquaintance with men of his own way of thinking, and he himself became known. Better than all, he learned to measure himself with other men, and by his early papers read to the Society, he gained skill in putting his thoughts before his hearers. This skill he never lost, and the merely literary art of his memoirs would make his papers remarkable without their other merits. He is always clear, and in his early papers especially, he appeals to his particular audience--the Royal Society--in a way which shows that he is conscious of all its weaknesses as well as of its dignity. Later, his tone slightly changed. He became less anxious to win his audience, for he had become an authority. This knowledge lent a quiet strength to his style, but never induced the slightest arrogance of spirit or manner.  The Bath Philosophical Society has left no printed proceedings. HERSCHEL was one of its earliest members, and many papers were communicated to it by his hand. These appear to have been of a very miscellaneous nature. Some of them at least would be of the highest interest to us now.  In the _Philosophical Transactions_ for 1789, p. 220, HERSCHEL tells us that he communicated to that Society \"certain mathematical papers\" relating to central forces other than the force of gravity, which are or may be concerned in the construction of the sidereal heavens. This early idea was still entertained by HERSCHEL in 1789, and the mathematical papers referred to must be contained in the _Minutes_ of the Society, which on its dissolution were torn from the Minute-book and returned to the writers.  The earliest published writing of HERSCHEL is the answer to the prize question in the \"Ladies' Diary\" for 1779, proposed by the celebrated LANDEN, namely:      \"The length, tension, and weight of a musical string being given,     it is required to find how many vibrations it will make in a given     time, when a small given weight is fastened to its middle and     vibrates with it.\"  In the _Philosophical Transactions_ of the Royal Society for 1780, are two papers of his. The title of the first is, _Astronomical Observations on the Periodical Star in Collo Ceti_, by Mr. WILLIAM HERSCHEL, of Bath. This was communicated to the Society by Dr. WILLIAM WATSON, Jr., and was read May 11, 1780, at the same time as the other paper on the mountains of the moon. It is to be noted that HERSCHEL was at this time plain \"Mr. WILLIAM HERSCHEL, of Bath.\" It was only in 1786 that he became \"Dr. HERSCHEL,\" through the Oxford degree of LL.D.  Neither of these two papers is specially remarkable on its purely astronomical side. The problems examined were such as lay open before all, and the treatment of them was such as would naturally be suggested.  The second of these two contained, however, a short description of his Newtonian telescope, and he speaks of it with a just pride: \"I believe that for distinctness of vision this instrument is perhaps equal to any that was ever made.\" He was, at least, certain of having obtained excellence in the making of his instruments.  In his next paper, however, read January 11, 1781, a subject is approached which shows a different kind of thought. It is the first obvious proof of the truth of the statement which he made long afterwards (1811), when he said: \"A knowledge of the construction of the heavens has always been the ultimate object of my observations.\"  The title of this paper was _Astronomical Observations on the Rotation of the Planets round their Axes, made with a view to determine whether the Earth's diurnal motion is perfectly equable_. Here the question is a difficult and a remote one, and the method adopted for its solution is perfectly suitable in principle. It marks a step onward from mere observations to philosophizing upon their results. In practical astronomy, too, we note an advance. Not only are his results given, but also careful estimates of the errors to be feared in them, and a discussion of the sources of such errors. The same volume of the _Philosophical Transactions_ which contains this paper, also contains another, _Account of a Comet_, read April 26, 1781. This comet was the major planet _Uranus_, or, as HERSCHEL named it, _Georgium Sidus_. He had found it on the night of Tuesday, March 13, 1781. \"In examining the small stars in the neighborhood of H _Geminorum_, I perceived one that appeared visibly larger than the rest; being struck with its uncommon appearance, I compared it to H _Geminorum_ and the small star in the quartile between _Auriga_ and _Gemini_, and finding it so much larger than either of them, I suspected it to be a comet.\" The \"comet\" was observed over all Europe. Its orbit was computed by various astronomers, and its distance from the sun was found to be nineteen times that of our earth. This was no comet, but a new major planet. The discovery of the amateur astronomer of Bath was the most striking since the invention of the telescope. It had absolutely no parallel, for every other major planet had been known from time immemorial.[13]  The effect of the discoveries of GALILEO was felt almost more in the moral than in the scientific world. The mystic number of the planets was broken up by the introduction of four satellites to _Jupiter_. That _Venus_ emulated the phases of our moon, overthrew superstition and seated the Copernican theory firmly. The discovery of \"an innumerable multitude "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29031"],["title","Sir William Herschel: His Life and Works (#6)"],["body","fixed stars\" in the Milky Way confounded the received ideas. This was the great mission of the telescope in GALILEO'S hands.  The epoch of mere astronomical discovery began with the detection of the large satellite of _Saturn_ by HUYGHENS, in 1655. Even then superstition was not dead. HUYGHENS did not search for more moons, because by that discovery he had raised the number of known satellites to six,[14] and because these, with the six planets, made \"the perfect number twelve.\"  From 1671 to 1684 CASSINI discovered four more moons revolving about _Saturn_. Since 1684 no new body had been added to the solar system. It was thought complete for nearly a century.  In England, the remarkable discoveries of BRADLEY (1727-62) had been in the field of practical astronomy, and his example had set the key-note for further researches. France was just about beginning the brilliant period of her discoveries in mathematical astronomy, and had no observatory devoted to investigations like HERSCHEL'S, with the possible exception of DARQUIER'S and FLAUGERGUES'. The observatories of SCHROETER and VON HAHN, in Germany, were not yet active. The field which HERSCHEL was created to fill was vacant, the whole world over. It was especially so in England. The Royal Observatory at Greenwich, under MASKELYNE, a skilful observer, whose work was mostly confined to meridian observations, was no rival to a private observatory like HERSCHEL'S. The private observatories themselves were but small affairs; those of the king, at Kew, of Dr. WILSON, at Glasgow, of Mr. AUBERT, at Loampit Hill, of the Count VON BRUHL, in London, being perhaps the most important. The whole field was open. What was perhaps more remarkable, there was in England, during HERSCHEL'S lifetime, no astronomer, public or private, whose talents, even as an observer, lay in the same direction.  It hardly need be said that as a philosopher in his science, he had then no rival, as he has had none since. His only associates even, were MICHELL and WILSON.[15]  Without depreciating the abilities of the astronomers of England, his cotemporaries, we may fairly say that HERSCHEL stood a great man among a group of small ones.  Let us endeavor to appreciate the change effected in the state of astronomy not only in England but in the whole world, simply by the discovery of _Uranus_. Suppose, for example, that the last planet in our system had been _Saturn_. No doubt HERSCHEL would have gone on. In spite of one and another difficulty, he would have made his ten-foot, his twenty-foot telescopes. His forty-foot would never have been built, and the two satellites which he found with it might not have been discovered. Certainly _Mimas_ would not have been. His researches on the construction of the heavens would have been made; those were in his brain, and must have been ultimated. The mass of observations of _Saturn_, of _Jupiter_, of _Mars_, of _Venus_, would have been made and published. The researches on the sun, on the \"invisible rays\" of heat, on comets and nebulæ--all these might have been made, printed, and read.  But these would have gone into the _Philosophical Transactions_ as the work of an amateur astronomer, \"Mr. HERSCHEL, of Bath.\" They would have been praised, and they would have been doubted. It would have taken a whole generation to have appreciated them. They would have been severely tried, entirely on their merits, and finally they would have stood where they stand to-day--unrivalled. But through what increased labors these successes would have been gained! It is not merely that the patronage of the king, the subsidies for the forty-foot telescope (£4,000), the comparative ease of HERSCHEL'S life would have been lacking. It is more than this. It would have been necessary for him to have created the audience to which he appealed, and to have conquered the most persistent of enemies--indifference.  Certainly, if HERSCHEL'S mind had been other than it was, the discovery of _Uranus_, which brought him honors from every scientific society in the world, and which gave him authority, might have had a hurtful effect. But, as he was, there was nothing which could have aided his career more than this startling discovery. It was needed for him. It completed the solar system far more by affording a free play to a profoundly philosophical mind, than by occupying the vacant spaces beyond _Saturn_.  His opportunities would have been profoundly modified, though his personal worth would have been the same.      \"The Star that from the zenith darts its beams,     Visible though it be to half the earth,     Though half a sphere be conscious of its brightness,     Is yet of no diviner origin,     No purer essence, than the One that burns     Like an untended watchfire, on the ridge     Of some dark mountain; or than those that seem     Humbly to hang, like twinkling winter lamps,     Among the branches of the leafless trees.\"  To show how completely unknown the private astronomer of Bath was at this time, I transcribe a sentence from BODE'S account of the discovery of _Uranus_.      \"In the _Gazette Littéraire_ of June, 1781, this worthy man is     called MERSTHEL; in JULIUS' _Journal Encyclopédique_, HERTSCHEL;     in a letter from Mr. MASKELYNE to M. MESSIER, HERTHEL; in another     letter of MASKELYNE'S to Herr MAYER, at Mannheim, HERRSCHELL; M.     DARQUIER calls him HERMSTEL. What may his name be? He must have been     born a _German_.\"[16]  This obscurity did not long continue. The news spread quickly from fashionable Bath to London. On the 6th of December, 1781, HERSCHEL was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, to which he was formally \"admitted\" May 30, 1782. He was forty-three years old.  He also received the Copley medal in 1781 for his \"discovery of a new and singular star.\"[17]      . . . \"He was now frequently interrupted by visitors who were     introduced by some of his resident scholars, among whom I remember     Sir HARRY ENGELFIELD, Dr. BLAGDEN, and Dr. MASKELYNE. With the     latter he was engaged in a long conversation, which to me sounded     like quarrelling, and the first words my brother said after he was     gone were: 'That is a devil of a fellow.'. . .      \"I suppose their names were often not known, or were forgotten; for     it was not till the year 1782 or 1783 that a memorandum of the names     of visitors was thought of.\". . . \"My brother now applied himself to     perfect his mirrors, erecting in his garden a stand for his     twenty-foot telescope; many trials were necessary before the     required motions for such an unwieldy machine could be contrived.     Many attempts were made by way of experiment before an intended     thirty-foot telescope could be completed, for which, between whiles     (not interrupting the observations with seven, ten, and twenty-foot,     and writing papers for both the Royal and Bath Philosophical     Societies), gauges, shapes, weight, etc., of the mirror were     calculated, and trials of the composition of the metal were made. In     short, I saw nothing else and heard nothing else talked of but these     things when my brothers were together. ALEX. was always very alert,     assisting when anything new was going forward, but he wanted     perseverance, and never liked to confine himself at home for many     hours together. And so it happened that my brother WILLIAM was     obliged to make trial of my abilities in copying for him catalogues,     tables, etc., and sometimes whole papers which were lent him for his     perusal. Among them was one by Mr. MICHELL and a catalogue of     CHRISTIAN MAYER, in Latin, which kept me employed when my brother     was at the telescope at night. When I found that a hand was     sometimes wanted when any particular measures were to be made with     the lamp micrometer, etc., or a fire to be kept up, or a dish of     coffee necessary during a long night's watching, I undertook with     pleasure what others might have thought a hardship. . . . Since the     discovery of the _Georgium Sidus_ [March 13, 1781], I believe few     men of learning or consequence left Bath before they had seen and     conversed with its discoverer, and thought themselves fortunate in     finding him at home on their repeated visits. Sir WILLIAM WATSON was     almost an intimate, for hardly a day passed but he had something to     communicate from the letters which he received from Sir JOSEPH     BANKS, and other members of the Royal Society, from which it     appeared that my brother was expected in town to receive the gold     medal. The end of November was the most precarious season for     absenting himself. But Sir WILLIAM WATSON went with him, and it was     arranged so that they set out with the diligence at night, and by     that means his absence did not last above three or four days, when     my brother returned alone, Sir WILLIAM remaining with his father.      \"Now a very busy winter was commencing; for my brother had engaged     himself to conduct the oratorios conjointly with RONZINI, and had     made himself answerable for the payment of the engaged performers,     for his credit ever stood high in the opinion of every one he had to     deal with. (He lost considerably by this arrangement.) But, though     at times much harassed with business, the mirror for the thirty-foot     reflector was never out of his mind, and if a minute could but be     spared in going from one scholar to another, or giving one the slip,     he called at home to see how the men went on with the furnace, which     was built in a room below, even with the garden.      \"The mirror was to be cast in a mould of loam, of which an immense     quantity was to be pounded in a mortar and sifted through a fine     sieve. It was an endless piece of work, and served me for many an     hour's exercise; and ALEX. frequently took his turn at it, for we     were all eager to do something towards the great undertaking.
