SECESSION ARMING.  While Congress was encouraging devotion to the Union, and its Committees striving for some mode by which the impending perils might be averted without a wholesale surrender of all just principles, the South Carolina Convention met (December 17, 1860) at Columbia, and after listening to inflammatory addresses by commissioners from the States of Alabama and Mississippi, urging immediate and unconditional Secession, unanimously and with \"tremendous cheering\" adopted a resolution: \"That it is the opinion of the Convention that the State of South Carolina should forthwith Secede from the Federal Union, known as the United States of America,\"--and then adjourned to meet at Charleston, South Carolina.  The next day, and following days, it met there, at \"Secession Hall,\" listening to stimulating addresses, while a committee of seven worked upon the Ordinance of Secession.  Among the statements made by orators, were several clear admissions that the rebellious Conspiracy had existed for very many years, and that Mr. Lincoln's election was simply the long-sought-for pretext for Rebellion.  Mr. Parker said: \"It is no spasmodic effort that has come suddenly upon us; it has been gradually culminating for a long period of thirty years.  At last it has come to that point where we may say, the matter is entirely right.\"  Mr. Inglis said: \"Most of us have had this matter under consideration for the last twenty years; and I presume that we have by this time arrived at a decision upon the subject.\"  Mr. Keitt said: \"I have been engaged in this movement ever since I entered political life; * * *  we have carried the body of this Union to its last resting place, and now we will drop the flag over its grave.\"  Mr. Barnwell Rhett said: \"The Secession of South Carolina is not an event of a day.  It is not anything produced by Mr. Lincoln's election, or by the non-execution of the Fugitive Slave Law.  It has been a matter which has been gathering head for thirty years.\"  Mr. Gregg said: \"If we undertake to set forth all the causes, do we not dishonor the memory of all the statesmen of South Carolina, now departed, who commenced forty years ago a war against the tariff and against internal improvement, saying nothing of the United States Bank, and other measures which may now be regarded as obsolete.\"  On the 20th of December, 1860--the fourth day of the sittings--the Ordinance of Secession was reported by the Committee, and was at once unanimously passed, as also was a resolution that \"the passage of the Ordinance be proclaimed by the firing of artillery and ringing of the bells of the city, and such other demonstrations as the people may deem appropriate on the passage of the great Act of Deliverance and Liberty;\" after which the Convention jubilantly adjourned to meet, and ratify, that evening.  At the evening session of this memorable Convention, the Governor and Legislature attending, the famous Ordinance was read as engrossed, signed by all the delegates, and, after announcement by the President that \"the State of South Carolina is now and henceforth a Free and Independent Commonwealth;\" amid tremendous cheering, the Convention adjourned.  This, the first Ordinance of Secession passed by any of the Revolting States, was in these words:  \"An Ordinance to dissolve the Union between the State of South Carolina and other States united with her, under the compact entitled the 'Constitution of the United States of America.'  \"We the people of the State of South Carolina in Convention assembled, do declare and ordain, and it is hereby declared and ordained, that the Ordinance adopted by us in Convention on the 23rd day of May, in the year of our Lord 1788, whereby the Constitution of the United States of America was ratified, and also all Acts and parts of Acts of the General Assembly of this State ratifying the amendments of the said Constitution, are hereby repealed; and that the Union now subsisting between South Carolina and other States, under the name of the United States of America, is hereby dissolved.\"  Thus, and in these words, was joyously adopted and ratified, that solemn Act of Separation which was doomed to draw in its fateful train so many other Southern States, in the end only to be blotted out with the blood of hundreds of thousands of their own brave sons, and their equally courageous Northern brothers.  State after State followed South Carolina in the mad course of Secession from the Union.  Mississippi passed a Secession Ordinance, January 9, 1861.  Florida followed, January 10th; Alabama, January 11th; Georgia, January 18th; Louisiana, January 26th; and Texas, February 1st; Arkansas, North Carolina, and Virginia held back until a later period; while Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, Maryland, and Delaware, abstained altogether from taking the fatal step, despite all attempts to bring them to it.  In the meantime, however, South Carolina had put on all the dignity of a Sovereign and Independent State.  Her Governor had a \"cabinet\" comprising Secretaries of State, War, Treasury, the Interior, and a Postmaster General. She had appointed Commissioners, to proceed to the other Slave-holding States, through whom a Southern Congress was proposed, to meet at Montgomery, Alabama; and had appointed seven delegates to meet the delegates from such other States in that proposed Southern Congress.  On the 21st of December, 1860, three Commissioners (Messrs.  Barnwell, Adams, and Orr) were also appointed to proceed to Washington, and treat for the cession by the United States to South Carolina, of all Federal property within the limits of the latter.  On the 24th, Governor Pickens issued a Proclamation announcing the adoption of the Ordinance of Secession, declaring \"that the State of South Carolina is, as she has a right to be, a separate sovereign, free and independent State, and as such, has a right to levy war, conclude peace, negotiate treaties, leagues or covenants, and to do all acts whatsoever that rightfully appertain to a free and independent State;\" the which proclamation was announced as \"Done in the eighty-fifth year of the Sovereignty and Independence of South Carolina.\"  On the same day (the Senators from that State in the United States Senate having long since, as we have seen, withdrawn from that body) the Representatives of South Carolina in the United States House of Representatives withdrew.  Serious dissensions in the Cabinet of President Buchanan, were now rapidly disintegrating the \"official family\" of the President.  Lewis Cass, the Secretary of State, disgusted with the President's cowardice and weakness, and declining to be held responsible for Mr. Buchanan's promise not to reinforce the garrisons of the National Forts, under Major Anderson, in Charleston harbor, retired from the Cabinet December 12th--Howell Cobb having already, \"because his duty to Georgia required it,\" resigned the Secretaryship of the Treasury, and left it bankrupt and the credit of the Nation almost utterly destroyed.  On the 26th of December, Major Anderson evacuated Fort Moultrie, removing all his troops and munitions of war to Fort Sumter--whereupon a cry went up from Charleston that this was in violation of the President's promise to take no step looking to hostilities, provided the Secessionists committed no overt act of Rebellion, up to the close of his fast expiring Administration.  On the 29th, John B. Floyd, Secretary of War, having failed to secure the consent of the Administration to an entire withdrawal of the Federal garrison from the harbor of Charleston, also resigned, and the next day--he having in the meantime escaped in safety to Virginia--was indicted by the Grand Jury at Washington, for malfeasance and conspiracy to defraud the Government in the theft of $870,000 of Indian Trust Bonds from the Interior Department, and the substitution therefor of Floyd's acceptances of worthless army-transportation drafts on the Treasury Department.  Jacob Thompson, Secretary of the Interior, also resigned, January 8th, 1861, on the pretext that \"additional troops, he had heard, have been ordered to Charleston\" in the \"Star of the West.\"--[McPherson's History of the Rebellion, p. 28.]  Several changes were thus necessitated in Mr. Buchanan's cabinet, by these and other resignations, so that by the 18th of January, 1861, Jeremiah S. Black was Secretary of State; General John A. Dix, Secretary of the Treasury; Joseph Holt, Secretary of War; Edwin M. Stanton, Attorney General; and Horatio King, Postmaster General.  But before leaving the Cabinet, the conspiring Southern members of it, and their friends, had managed to hamstring the National"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7134"],["title","The Great Conspiracy, Volume 2 (#4)"],["body","nt, by scattering the Navy in other quarters of the World; by sending the few troops of the United States to remote points; by robbing the arsenals in the Northern States of arms and munitions of war, so as to abundantly supply the Southern States at the critical moment; by bankrupting the Treasury and shattering the public credit of the Nation; and by other means no less nefarious.  Thus swindled, betrayed, and ruined, by its degenerate and perfidious sons, the imbecile Administration stood with dejected mien and folded hands helplessly awaiting the coming catastrophe.  On December 28th, 1860, the three Commissioners of South Carolina having reached Washington, addressed to the President a communication, in which--after reciting their powers and duties, under the Ordinance of Secession, and stating that they had hoped to have been ready to proceed to negotiate amicably and without \"hostile collision,\" but that \"the events--[The removal, to Fort Sumter, of Major Anderson's command, and what followed.]--of the last twenty-four hours render such an assurance impossible\"--they declared that the troops must be withdrawn from Charleston harbor, as \"they are a standing menace which render negotiation impossible,\" threatening speedily to bring the questions involved, to \"a bloody issue.\"  To this communication Mr. Buchanan replied at considerable length, December 30th, in an apologetic, self-defensive strain, declaring that the removal by Major Anderson of the Federal troops under his command, from Fort Moultrie to Fort Sumter was done \"upon his own responsibility, and without authority,\" and that he (the President) \"had intended to command him to return to his former position,\" but that events had so rapidly transpired as to preclude the giving of any such command;       [The seizure by the Secessionists, under the Palmetto Flag, of      Castle Pinckney and Fort Moultrie; the simultaneous raising of that      flag over the Federal Custom House and Post Office at Charleston;      the resignation of the Federal Collector, Naval Officer and      Surveyor of that Port--all of which occurred December 27th; and the      seizure \"by force of arms,\" December 30th, of the United States      Arsenal at that point.]  and concluding, with a very slight stiffening of backbone, by saying: \"After this information, I have only to add that, whilst it is my duty to defend Fort Sumter as a portion of the public property of the United States against hostile attacks, from whatever quarter they may come, by such means as I may possess for this purpose, I do not perceive how such a defense can be construed into a menace against the city of Charleston.\"  To this reply of the President, the Commissioners made rejoinder on the 1st of January, 1861; but the President \"declined to receive\" the communication.  From this time on, until the end of President Buchanan's term of office, and the inauguration of Mr. Lincoln as President, March 4th, 1861, events crowded each other so hurriedly, that the flames of Rebellion in the South were continually fanned, while the public mind in the North was staggered and bewildered, by them.  On January 2nd, prior to the Secession of Georgia, Forts Pulaski and Jackson, commanding Savannah, and the Federal Arsenal at Augusta, Georgia, with two 12 pound howitzers, two cannon, 22,000 muskets and rifles, and ammunition in quantity, were seized by Rebel militia.  About the same date, although North Carolina had not seceded, her Governor (Ellis) seized the Federal Arsenal at Fayetteville, Fort Macon, and other fortifications in that State, \"to preserve them\" from mob-seizure.  January 4th, anticipating Secession, Alabama State troops seized Fort Morgan, with 5,000 shot and shell, and Mount Vernon Arsenal at Mobile, with 2,000 stand of arms, 150, 000 pounds of powder, some pieces of cannon, and a large quantity of other munitions of war.  The United States Revenue cutter, \"Lewis Cass,\" was also surrendered to Alabama.  On the 5th, the Federal steamer \"Star of the West,\" with reinforcements and supplies for Fort Sumter, left New York in the night--and Secretary Jacob Thompson notified the South Carolina Rebels of the fact.  On the 9th, the \"Star of the West\" appeared off Charleston bar, and while steaming toward Fort Sumter, was fired upon by Rebel batteries at Fort Moultrie and Morris Island, and struck by a shot, whereupon she returned to New York without accomplishing her mission.  That day the State of Mississippi seceded from the Union.  On the 10th, the Federal storeship \"Texas,\" with Federal guns and stores, was seized by Texans.  On the same day Florida seceded.  On the 11th, Forts Jackson and St. Philip, commanding the mouth of the Mississippi River, and Fort Pike, dominating Lake Pontchartrain, were seized by Louisiana troops; also the Federal Arsenal at Baton Rouge, with 50,000 small arms, 4 howitzers, 20 heavy pieces of ordnance, 2 batteries, 300 barrels of powder, and other stores.  The State of Alabama also seceded the same day.  On the 12th--Fort Marion, the coast surveying schooner \"Dana,\" the Arsenal at St. Augustine, and that on the Chattahoochee, with 500,000 musket cartridges, 300,000 rifle cartridges and 50,000 pounds of powder, having previously been seized--Forts Barrancas and McRae, and the Navy Yard at Pensacola, were taken by Rebel troops of Florida, Alabama and Mississippi.  On the same day, Colonel Hayne, of South Carolina, arrived at Washington as Agent or Commissioner to the National Government from Governor Pickens of that State.  On the 14th, the South Carolina Legislature resolved \"that any attempt by the Federal Government to reinforce Fort Sumter will be regarded as an act of open hostility, and a Declaration of War.\"  On the 16th, Colonel Hayne, of South Carolina, developed his mission, which was to demand of the President the surrender of Fort Sumter to the South Carolina authorities--a demand that had already been made upon, and refused by, Major Anderson.  The correspondence concerning this demand, between Colonel Hayne and ten Southern United States Senators;--[Senators Wigfall, Hemphill, Yulee, Mallory, Jeff.  Davis, C. C. Clay, Fitzgerald, Iverson, Slidell, and Benjamin.]--the reply of the President, by Secretary Holt, to those Senators; Governor Pickens's review of the same; and the final demand; consumed the balance of the month of January; and ended, February 6th, in a further reply, through the Secretary of War, from the President, asserting the title of the United States to that Fort, and declining the demand, as \"he has no Constitutional power to cede or surrender it.\" Secretary Holt's letter concluded by saying: \"If, with all the multiplied proofs which exist of the President's anxiety for Peace, and of the earnestness with which he has pursued it, the authorities of that State shall assault Fort Sumter, and peril the lives of the handful of brave and loyal men shut up within its walls, and thus plunge our Common Country into the horrors of Civil War, then upon them and those they represent, must rest the responsibility.\"  But to return from this momentary diversion: On the 18th of January, Georgia seceded; and on the 20th, the Federal Fort at Ship Island, Mississippi, and the United States Hospital on the Mississippi River were seized by Mississippi troops.  On the 26th, Louisiana seceded.  On the 28th, Louisiana troops seized all the quartermaster's and commissary stores held by Federal officials; and the United States Revenue cutter \"McClelland\" surrendered to the Rebels.  On February 1st, the Louisiana Rebels seized the National Mint and Custom House at New Orleans, with $599,303 in gold and silver.  On the same day the State of Texas seceded.  On February 8th, the National Arsenal at Little Rock, Arkansas, with 9,000 small arms, 40 cannon, and quantities of ammunition, was seized; and the same day the Governor of Georgia ordered the National Collector of the Port of Savannah to retain all collections and make no further payments to the United States Government.*        [It was during this eventful month that, certain United States      troops having assembled at the National Capital, and the House of      Representatives having asked the reason therefor, reply was made by      the Secretary of War as follows:       \"WAR DEPARTMENT, February 18, 1861.           [Congressional Globe, August 8, 1861, pp.  457,458]      \"SIR: On the 11th February, the House of Representatives adopted a      resolution requesting the President, if not incompatible with the      public interests, to communicate 'the reasons that had induced him      to assemble so large a number of troops in this city, and why they      are kept here; and whether he has any information of a Conspiracy      upon the part of any portion of the citizens of this Country to      seize upon the Capital and prevent the Inauguration of the      President elect.'       \"This resolution having been submitted to this Department for      consideration and report, I have the honor to state, that the body      of troops temporarily transferred to this city is not as large as      is assumed by the resolution, though it is a well-appointed corps      and admirably adapted for the preservation of the public peace.      The reasons which led to their being assembled here will now be      briefly stated.       \"I shall make no comment upon the origin of the Revolution which,      for the last three months, has been in progress in several of the      Southern States, nor shall I enumerate the causes which have      hastened its advancement or exasperated its temper.  The scope of      the questions submitted by the House will be sufficiently met by      dealing with the facts as they exist, irrespective of the cause      from which they have proceeded.
