Jan and Ted looked curiously about them. It was the first time they had had a chance to look quietly since they had started on the journey, for they had been traveling in the train nearly a week, it seemed.  What they saw was a small railroad station, set in the midst of big rolling fields. There was a water tank near the station, and not far from the tank was a small building in which a pump could be heard chug-chugging away.  \"But where is the ranch?\" asked Janet of her brother. \"I don't see any cows and horses.\"  \"Dere's horses,\" stated Trouble, pointing to the two sturdy ponies hitched to the wagon.  \"Yes, I know\" admitted Janet. \"But Uncle Frank said he had more'n a hundred horses and--\"  \"And a thousand steers--that's cattle,\" interrupted Ted. \"I don't see any, either. Maybe we got off at the wrong station, Mother.\"  \"No, you're all right,\" laughed Mrs. Martin. \"Didn't Uncle Frank meet us and didn't Daddy tell us we'd have to drive to the ranch?\"  \"What's the matter now, Curlytops?\" asked their father's uncle, as the two men came back from having seen about the baggage, which had arrived safely. \"What are you two youngsters worrying about, Teddy and Janet?\"  \"They're afraid we're at the wrong place because they can't see the ranch,\" answered their mother.  \"Oh, that's over among the hills,\" said Uncle Frank, waving his hand toward some low hills that were at the foot of some high mountains. \"It wouldn't do,\" he went on, \"to have a ranch too near a railroad station. The trains might scare the horses and cattle. You will soon be there, Curlytops. We'll begin to travel in a minute.\"  Ted and Janet settled themselves in the seat, where they were side by side, and looked about them. Suddenly Janet clasped her brother by the arm and exclaimed:  \"Look, Ted! Look!\"  \"Where?\" he asked.  \"Right over there--by the station. It's an _Indian_!\"  \"A real one?\" asked Teddy, who, at first, did not see where his sister was pointing.  \"He _looks_ like a real one,\" Janet answered. \"He's _alive_, 'cause he's moving!\"  She snuggled closer to her brother. Then Teddy saw where Janet pointed. A big man, whose face was the color of a copper cent, was walking along the station platform. He was wrapped in a dirty blanket, but enough of him could be seen to show that he was a Redman.  \"Is that a _real_ Indian, Uncle Frank?\" asked Teddy in great excitement.  \"What? Him? Oh, yes, he's a real Indian all right. There's a lot of 'em come down to the station to sell baskets and beadwork to the people who go through on the trains.\"  \"Is he a _tame_ Indian?\" the little boy next wanted to know.  \"Oh, he's 'tame' all right. Hi there, Running Horse!\" called Uncle Frank to the copper-faced man in the blanket, \"sell many baskets to-day?\"  \"Um few. No good business,\" answered the Indian in a sort of grunt.  \"Oh, do you know him?\" asked Ted in surprise.  \"Oh, yes. Running Horse often comes to the ranch when he's hungry. There's a reservation of the Indians not far from our place. They won't hurt you, Jan; don't be afraid,\" said Uncle Frank, as he saw that the little girl kept close to Teddy.  \"Was he wild once?\" she asked timidly.  \"Why, yes; I guess you might have called him a wild Indian once,\" her uncle admitted. \"He's pretty old and I shouldn't wonder but what he had been on the warpath against the white settlers.\"  \"Oh!\" exclaimed Janet. \"Maybe he'll get wild again!\"  \"Oh, no he won't!\" laughed Uncle Frank. \"He's only too glad now to live on the reservation and sell the baskets the squaws make. The Indian men don't like to work.\"  Running Horse, which was the queer name the Indian had chosen for himself, or which had been given him, walked along, wrapped in his blanket, though the day was a warm one. Perhaps he thought the blanket kept the heat out in summer and the cold in winter.  \"Get along now, ponies!\" cried Uncle Frank, and the little horses began to trot along the road that wound over the prairies like a dusty ribbon amid the green grass.  On the way to Ring Rosy Ranch Uncle Frank had many questions to ask, some of the children and some of Mr. and Mrs. Martin. Together they laughed about the things that had happened when they were all snowed in.  \"Tell Uncle Frank of Trouble's trying to hide Nicknack away so we wouldn't leave him behind,\" suggested Mrs. Martin.  \"Ha! Ha! That was pretty good!\" exclaimed the ranchman when Ted and Janet, by turns, had told of Trouble's being found asleep in the goat-wagon. \"Well, it's too bad you couldn't bring Nicknack with you. He'd like it out on the ranch, I'm sure, but it would be too long a journey for him. You'll have rides enough--never fear!\"  \"Pony rides?\" asked Teddy.  \"Pony rides in plenty!\" laughed Uncle Frank. \"We'll soon be there now, and you can see the ranch from the top of the next hill.\"  The prairies were what are called \"rolling\" lard. That is there were many little hills and hollows, and the country seemed to be like the rolling waves of the ocean, if they had suddenly been made still.  Sometimes the wagon, drawn by the two little horses, would be down in a hollow, and again it would be on top of a mound-like hill from which a good view could be had.  Reaching the top of one hill, larger than the others, Uncle Frank pointed off in the distance and said:  \"There's Circle O Ranch, Curlytops, or, as Jan has named it, Ring Rosy Ranch. We'll be there in a little while.\"  The children looked. They saw, off on the prairie, a number of low, red buildings standing close together. Beyond the buildings were big fields, in which were many small dots.  \"What are the dots?\" asked Janet.  \"Those are my horses and cattle--steers we call the last,\" explained Uncle Frank.  \"They are eating grass to get fat You'll soon be closer to them.\"  \"Are the Indians near here?\" Teddy inquired.  \"No, not very near. It's a day's ride to their reservation. But don't worry about them. They won't bother you if you don't bother them,\" said Uncle Frank.  Teddy was not fully satisfied with this answer, for he hoped very much that the Indians would \"bother him\"--at least, he thought that was what he wanted.  When the Curlytops drew closer to the ranch they could see that one of the buildings was a house, almost like their own in the East, only not so tall. It was all one story, as were the other buildings, some of which were stables for the horses and some sleeping places, or \"bunk houses,\" for the cowboys, while from one building, as they approached closer, there came the good smell of something cooking.  \"That's the cook's place,\" said Uncle Frank, pointing with his whip. \"All the cowboys love him, even if he is a Chinaman.\"  \"Have you a Chinese cook?\" asked Mrs. Martin.  \"Yes, and he's a good one,\" answered Uncle Frank. \"Wait until you taste how he fries chicken.\"  \"I hope we taste some soon,\" said Daddy Martin. \"This ride across the prairies has made me hungry.\"  \"I hungry, too!\" exclaimed Trouble. \"I wants bread an' milk!\"  \"And you shall have all you want!\" laughed the ranchman. \"We've plenty of milk.\"  \"Oh, this is a dandy place!\" exclaimed Teddy, as the wagon drove up to the ranch house. \"Well have lots of fun here, Janet!\"  \"Maybe we will, if--if the Indians don't get us,\" she said.  \"Pooh! I'm not afraid of them,\" boasted Teddy, and then something happened.  All at once there came a lot of wild yells, and sounds as if a Fourth-of-July celebration of the old-fashioned sort were going on. There was a popping and a banging, and then around the corner of the house rode a lot of roughly-dressed men on ponies which kicked up a cloud of dust.  \"Ki-yi! Ki-yi! Yippi-i-yip!\" yelled the men.  \"Bang! Bang! Bang!\" exploded their revolvers.  \"Oh, dear!\" screamed Janet.  Teddy turned a little pale, but he did not make a sound.  \"What is it?\" asked Mrs. Martin, hugging Trouble and his sister closer to her. \"Oh, what is it?\"  \"Don't be afraid!\" laughed Uncle Frank. \"Those are the cowboys making you welcome to Ring Rosy Ranch. That's their way of having fun!\"     CHAPTER VII  BAD NEWS   On came the cowboys, yelling, shouting and shooting off their big revolvers which made noises like giant firecrackers. The men, some of whom wore big leather \"pants,\" as Teddy said afterward, and some of whom had on trousers that seemed to be made from the fleece of sheep, swung their hats in the air. Some of them even stood up in their saddles, \"just like circus riders!\" as Janet sent word to Aunt Jo, who was spending the summer at Mt. Hope.  \"Are they shooting real bullets, Uncle Frank?\" asked Teddy, as soon as the noise died down a little and the cowboys were waving their hats to the Curlytops and the other visitors to Ring Rosy Ranch.  \"Real bullets? Bless your heart, no!\" exclaimed Mr. Barton. \"Of course the cowboys sometimes have real bullets in their 'guns,' as they call their revolvers, but they don't shoot 'em for fun.\"  \"What makes them shoot?\" asked Janet.  \"Well, sometimes it's to scare away bad men who might try to steal my cattle or horses, and again it's to scare the cattle themselves. You see,\" explained Uncle Frank, while the cowboys jumped from their horses and went to the bunk house to wash and get ready for supper, \"a ranch is just like a big pasture that your Grandfather Martin has at Cherry Farm. Only my ranch is ever so much bigger than his pastures, even all of them put together. And there are very few fences around any of my fields, so the cattle or horses might easily stray off, or be taken.  \"Because of that I have to hire men--cowboys they are called--to watch my cattle and horses, to see that they do not run away and that no white men or Indians come and run away with them.  \"But sometimes the cattle take it into"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6814"],["title","The Curlytops at Uncle Frank's Ranch; Or, Little Folks on Ponyback (#7)"],["body","heads to run away themselves. They get frightened--'stampeded' we call it--and they don't care which way they run. Sometimes a prairie fire will make them run and again it may be bad men--thieves. The cowboys have to stop the cattle from running away, and they do it by firing revolvers in front of them. So it wouldn't do to have real bullets in their guns when the cowboys are firing that way. They use blank cartridges, just as they did now to salute you when they came in.\"  \"Is that what they did?\" asked Teddy. \"Saluted us?\"  \"That's it. They just thought they'd have a little fun with you--see if they could scare you, maybe, because you're what they call a 'tenderfoot,' Teddy.\"  \"Pooh, I wasn't afraid!\" declared Teddy, perhaps forgetting a little. \"I liked it. It was like the Fourth of July!\"  \"I didn't like it,\" said Janet, with a shake of her curly head. \"And what's a soft-foot, Uncle Frank?\"  \"A soft-foot? Oh, ho! I see!\" he laughed. \"You mean a tenderfoot! Well, that's what the Western cowboys call anybody from the East--where you came from. It means, I guess, that their feet are tender because they walk so much and don't ride a horse the way cowboys do. You see out here we folks hardly ever walk. If we've only got what you might call a block to go we hop on a horse and ride. So we get out of the way of walking.  \"Now you Eastern folk walk a good bit--that is when you aren't riding in street cars and in your automobiles, and I suppose that's why the cowboys call you tender-feet. You don't mind, though, do you, Teddy?\"  \"Nope,\" he said. \"I like it. But I'm going to learn to ride a pony.\"  \"So'm I!\" exclaimed Janet.  \"I wants a wide, too!\" cried Trouble. \"Can't I wide, Uncle Frank? We hasn't got Nicknack, but maybe you got a goat,\" and he looked up at his father's uncle.  \"No, I haven't a goat,\" laughed Uncle Frank, \"though there might be some sheep on some of the ranches here. But I guess ponies will suit you children better. When you Curlytops learn to ride you can take Trouble up on the saddle with you and give him a ride. He's too small to ride by himself yet.\"  \"I should say he was, Uncle Frank!\" cried Mrs. Martin. \"Don't let _him_ get on a horse!\"  \"I won't,\" promised Mr. Barton with a laugh. But Trouble said:  \"I likes a pony! I wants a wide, Muz-zer!\"  \"You may ride with me when I learn,\" promised Janet.  \"Dat nice,\" responded William.  Uncle Frank's wife, whom everyone called Aunt Millie, came out of the ranch house and welcomed the Curlytops and the others. She had not seen them for a number of years.  \"My, how big the children are!\" she cried as she looked at Janet and Teddy. \"And here's one I've never seen,\" she went on, as she caught Trouble up in her arms and kissed him.  \"Now come right in. Hop Sing has supper ready for you.\"  \"Hop Sing!\" laughed Mother Martin. \"That sounds like a new record on the phonograph.\"  \"It's the name of our Chinese cook,\" explained Aunt Millie, \"and a very good one he is, too!\"  \"Are the cowboys coming in to eat with us?\" asked Teddy, as they all went into the house, where the baggage had been carried by Uncle Frank and Daddy Martin.  \"Oh, no. They eat by themselves in their own building. Not that we wouldn't have them, for they're nice boys, all of them, but they'd rather be by themselves.\"  \"Do any Indians come in?\" asked Janet, looking toward the door.  \"Bless your heart, no!\" exclaimed Aunt Millie. \"We wouldn't want them, for they're dirty and not at all nice, though some of them do look like pictures when they wrap themselves around in a red blanket and stick feathers in their hair. We don't want any Indians. Now tell me about your trip.\"  \"We were in a collision!\" cried Janet.  \"In the middle of the night,\" added Teddy.  \"An' I mos' fell out of my bed!\" put in Trouble.  Then, amid laughter, the story of the trip from the East was told. Meanwhile Hop Sing, the Chinese cook, cried out in his funny, squeaky voice that supper was getting cold.  \"Well, well eat first and talk afterward,\" said Uncle Frank, as he led the way to the table. \"Come on, folks. I expect you all have good appetites. That's what we're noted for at Ring Rosy Ranch.\"  \"What's that?\" asked Aunt Millie.  \"Have you given Circle O a new name?\"  \"One of the Curlytops did,\" chuckled Uncle Frank. \"They said my branding sign looked just like a ring-round-the-rosy, so I'm going to call the ranch that after this.\"  \"It's a nice name,\" said Aunt Millie. \"And now let me see you Curlytops--and Trouble, too--though his hair isn't frizzy like Ted's and Janet's--let me see you eat until you get as fat as a Ring Rosy yourselves. If you don't eat as much as you can of everything, Hop Sing will feel as though he was not a good cook.\"  The Curlytops were hungry enough to eat without having to be told to, and Hop Sing, looking into the dining-room now and then from where he was busy in the kitchen, smiled and nodded his head as he said to the maid.  \"Lil' chillens eat velly good!\"  \"Indeed they do eat very good,\" said the maid, as she carried in more of the food which Hop Sing knew so well how to cook.  After supper the Curlytops and the others sat out on the broad porch of the ranch house. Off to one side were the other buildings, some where the farming tools were kept, for Uncle Frank raised some grain as well as cattle, and some where the cowboys lived, as well as others where they stabled their horses.  \"I know what let's do,\" said Jan, when she and her brother had sat on the porch for some time, listening to the talk of the older folks, and feeling very happy that they were at Uncle Frank's ranch, where, they felt sure, they could have such good times.  \"What can we do?\" asked Teddy. Very often he let Jan plan some fun, and I might say that she got into trouble doing this as many times as her brother did. Jan was a regular boy, in some things. But then I suppose any girl is who has two nice brothers, even if one is little enough to be called \"Baby.\"  \"Let's go and take a walk,\" suggested Jan. \"My legs feel funny yet from ridin' in the cars so much.\"  \"Ri-_ding_!\" yelled Teddy gleefully. \"That's the time you forgot your g, Janet.\"  \"Yes, I did,\" admitted the little girl. \"But there's so much to look at here that it's easy to forget. My forgetter works easier than yours does, Ted.\"  \"It does not!\"  \"It does, too!\"  \"It does not!\"  \"I--say--it--does!\" and Janet was very positive.  \"Now, now, children!\" chided their mother. \"That isn't nice. What are you disputing about now?\"  \"Jan says her forgetter's better'n mine!\" cried Ted.  \"And it is,\" insisted Janet. \"I can forget lots easier than Ted.\"  \"Well, forgetting isn't a very good thing to do,\" said Mr. Martin. \"Remembering is better.\"  \"Oh, that's what I meant!\" said Jan. \"I thought it was a forgetter. Anyhow mine's better'n Ted's!\"  \"Now don't start that again,\" warned Mother Martin, playfully shaking her finger at the two children. \"Be nice now. Amuse yourselves in some quiet way. It will soon be time to go to bed. You must be tired. Be nice now.\"  \"Come on, let's go for a walk,\" proposed Jan again, and Ted, now that the forget-memory dispute was over, was willing to be friendly and kind and go with his sister.  So while Trouble climbed up into his mother's lap, and the older folks were talking among themselves, the two Curlytops, not being noticed by the others, slipped off the porch and walked toward the ranch buildings, out near the corrals, or the fenced-in places, where the horses were kept.  There were too many horses to keep them all penned in, or fenced around, just as there are too many cattle on a cattle ranch. But the cowboys who do not want their horses which they ride to get too far away put them in a corral. This is just as good as a barn, except in cold weather.  \"There's lots of things to see here,\" said Teddy, as he and his sister walked along.  \"Yes,\" she agreed. \"It's lots of fun. I'm glad I came.\"  \"So'm I. Oh, look at the lots of ponies!\" she cried, as she and Ted turned a corner of one of the ranch buildings and came in sight of a new corral. In it were a number of little horses, some of which hung their heads over the fence and watched the Curlytops approaching.  \"I'd like to ride one,\" sighed Teddy wistfully.  \"Oh, you mustn't!\" cried Jan. \"Uncle Frank wouldn't like it, nor mother or father, either. You have to ask first.\"  \"Oh, I don't mean ride now,\" said Ted. \"Anyhow, I haven't got a saddle.\"  \"Can't you ride without a saddle?\" asked Janet.  \"Well, not very good I guess,\" Ted answered. \"A horse's back has a bone in the middle of it, and that bumps you when you don't have a saddle.\"  \"How do you know?\" asked Janet.  \"I know, 'cause once the milkman let me sit on his horse and I felt the bone in his back. It didn't feel good.\"  \"Maybe the milkman's horse was awful bony.\"  \"He was,\" admitted Ted. \"But anyhow you've got to have a saddle to ride a horse, lessen you're a Indian and I'm not.\"  \"Well, maybe after a while Uncle Frank'll give you a saddle,\" said Janet.  \"Maybe,\" agreed her brother, \"Oh, see how the ponies look at us!\"  \"And one's following us all around,\" added his sister. For the little horses had indeed all come to the side of the corral fence nearest the Curlytops, and were following along as the children walked.  \"What do you s'pose they want?\" asked Teddy.  \"Maybe they're hungry,\" answered Janet.  \"Let's pull some grass for 'em,\" suggested Teddy, and they did this, feeding it to the horses that stretched their necks over the top rail of the fence and chewed the green bunches as if they very much liked their fodder.  But after a while Jan and Ted tired of even this. And no wonder--there were so many horses, and they all seemed to like the grass so much that the children never could have pulled enough for all of them.  \"Look at that one always pushing the others out of the way,\" said Janet, pointing to one pony, larger than the others, who was always first at the fence, and first to reach his nose toward the bunches of "]]]
