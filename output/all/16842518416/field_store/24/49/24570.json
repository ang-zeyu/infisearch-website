For I had planned to send two or three men to explore the neighborhood of the Trois Rivières, and ascertain what there was there. This, to my great regret, I was unable to accomplish, and postponed the project to the first opportunity that might present itself.  Meanwhile I urged on the repairs to our barque. When it was ready, a young man from La Rochelle, named Tresart, asked me to permit him to accompany me to the above-mentioned fall. This I refused, replying that I had special plans of my own, and that I did not wish to conduct any one to my prejudice, adding that there were other companies than mine there, and that I did not care to open up a way and serve as guide, and that he could make the voyage well enough alone and without my help.  The same day I set out from Quebec, and arrived at the great fall on the twenty-eighth of May. But I found none of the savages who had promised me to be there on this day. I entered at once a poor canoe, together with the savage I had taken to France and one of my own men. After examining the two shores, both in the woods and on the river bank, in order to find a spot favorable for the location of a settlement, and to get a place ready for building, I went some eight leagues by land along the great fall and through the woods, which are very open, as far as a lake, [4] whither our savage conducted me. Here I observed the country very carefully. But in all that I saw, I found no place more favorable than a little spot to which barques and shallops can easily ascend, with the help of a strong wind or by taking a winding course, in consequence of the strong current. But above this place, which we named _La Place Royale_, at the distance of a league from Mont Royal, there are a great many little rocks and shoals, which are very dangerous. Near Place Royale there is a little river, extending some distance into the interior, along the entire length of which there are more than sixty acres of land cleared up and like meadows, where grain can be sown and gardens made. Formerly savages tilled these lands, [5] but they abandoned them on account of their wars, in which they were constantly engaged. There is also a large number of other fine pastures, where any number of cattle can graze. There are also the various kinds of trees found in France, together with many vines, nut and plum trees, cherries, strawberries, and other kinds of good fruit. Among the rest there is a very excellent one, with a sweet taste like that of plantains, a fruit of the Indies, as white as snow, with a leaf resembling that of nettles, and which creeps up the trees and along the ground like ivy. [6] Fish are very abundant, including all the varieties we have in France, and many very good ones which we do not have. Game is also plenty, the birds being of various kinds. There are stags, hinds, does, caribous, [7] rabbits, lynxes, [8] bears, beavers, also other small animals, and all in such large numbers, that while we were at the fall we were abundantly supplied with them.  After a careful examination, we found this place one of the finest on this river. I accordingly forthwith gave orders to cut down and clear up the woods in the Place Royale, [9] so as to level it and prepare it for building. The water can easily be made to flow around it, making of it a little island, so that a habitation can be formed as one may wish.  There is a little island some twenty fathoms from Place Royale, about a hundred paces long, where a good and strong settlement might be made. There are also many meadows, containing very good and rich potter's clay, as well adapted for brick as for building purposes, and consequently a very useful article. I had a portion of it worked up, from which I made a wall four feet thick, three or four high, and ten fathoms long, to see how it would stand during the winter, when the freshets came down, although I thought the water would not reach up to it, the ground there being twelve feet above the river, which was very high. In the middle of the river there was an island about three-quarters of a league around, where a good and strong town could be built. This we named _Isle de Sainte Hélène_. [10] This river at the fall is like a lake, containing two or three islands, and bordered by fine meadows.  On the first day of June, Pont Gravé arrived at the fall, having been unable to accomplish anything at Tadoussac. A numerous company attended and followed after him to share in the booty, without the hope of which they would have been far in the rear.  Now, while awaiting the savages, I had two gardens made, one in the meadows, the other in the woods, which I had cleared up. On the 2d of June I sowed some seeds, all of which came up finely, and in a short time, attesting the good quality of the soil.  We resolved to send Savignon, our savage, together with another, to meet his countrymen, so as to hasten their arrival. They hesitated about going in our canoe, of which they were distrustful, it being a very poor one. They set out on the 5th. The next day four or five barques arrived as an escort for us, since they could do nothing at Tadoussac.  On the 7th I went to explore a little river, along which the savages sometimes go to war, and which flows into the fall of the river of the Iroquois. [11] It is very pleasant, with meadow land more than three leagues in circuit, and much arable land. It is distant a league from the great fall, and a league and a half from Place Royale.  On the 9th our savage arrived. He had gone somewhat beyond the lake, which is ten leagues long, and which I had seen before. [12] But he met no one, and they were unable to go any farther, as their canoe gave out, which obliged them to return. They reported that after passing the fall they saw an island, where there was such a quantity of herons that the air was completely filled with them. There was a young man belonging to Sieur de Monts named Louis, who was very fond of the chase. Hearing this, he wished to go and satisfy his curiosity, earnestly entreating our savage to take him to the place. To this the savage consented, taking also a captain of the Montagnais, a very respectable person, whose name was _Outetoucos_. On the following morning Louis caused the two savages to be called, and went with them in a canoe to the island of the herons. This island is in the middle of the fall. [13] Here they captured as many herons and other birds as they wanted, and embarked again in their canoe.  Outetoucos, contrary to the wish of the other savage, and against his remonstrances, desired to pass through a very dangerous place, where the water fell more than three feet, saying that he had formerly gone this way, which, however, was false. He had a long discussion in opposition to our savage, who wished to take him on the south side, along the mainland, [14] where they usually go. This, however, Outetoucos did not wish, saying that there was no danger. Our savage finding him obstinate yielded to his desire. But he insisted that at least a part of the birds in the canoe should be taken out, as it was overloaded, otherwise he said it would inevitably fill and be lost. But to this he would not consent, saying that it would be time enough when they found themselves in the presence of danger. They accordingly permitted themselves to be carried along by the current. But when they reached the precipice, they wanted to throw overboard their load in order to escape. It was now, however, too late, for they were completely in the power of the rapid water, and were straightway swallowed up in the whirlpools of the fall, which turned them round a thousand times. For a long time they clung to the boat. Finally the swiftness of the water wearied them so that this poor Louis, who could not swim at all, entirely lost his presence of mind, and, the canoe going down, he was obliged to abandon it. As it returned to the surface, the two others who kept holding on to it, saw Louis no more, and thus he died a sad death. [15] The two others continued to hold on to the canoe. When, however, they were out of danger, this Outetoucos, being naked and having confidence in his swimming powers, abandoned it in the expectation of reaching the shore, although the water still ran there with great rapidity.  But he was drowned, for he had been so weakened and overcome by his efforts that it was impossible for him to save himself after abandoning the canoe. Our savage Savignon, understanding himself better, held firmly to the canoe until it reached an eddy, whither the current had carried it. Here he managed so well that, notwithstanding his suffering and weariness, he approached the shore gradually, when, after throwing the water out of the canoe, he returned in great fear that they would take vengeance upon him, as the savages do among themselves, and related to us this sad story, which caused us great sorrow.  On the next day I went in another canoe to the fall, together with the savage and another member of our company, to see the place where they had met with their accident, and find, if possible, the remains. But when he showed me the spot, I was horrified at beholding such a terrible place, and astonished that the deceased should have been so lacking in judgment as to pass through such a fearful place, when they could have gone another way. For it is impossible to go along there, as there are seven or eight descents of water one after the other, the lowest three feet high, the seething and boiling of the water being fearful. A part of the fall was all white with foam, indicating the worst spot, the noise of which was like thunder, the air resounding with the echo of the cataracts. After viewing and carefully examining this place, and searching along the river bank for the dead bodies, another very light shallop having proceeded meanwhile on the other bank also, we returned without"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6825"],["title","Voyages of Samuel De Champlain — Volume 03 (#3)"],["body","anything.         *       *       *       *       *  CHAMPLAIN'S EXPLANATION OF THE ACCOMPANYING MAP.

This little river is mentioned by Champlain in his Voyage of 1603,    Vol. I. p. 268. It is represented on early maps as formed by two small    streams, flowing, one from the north or northeastern, and the other from    the southern side of the mountain, in the rear of the city of Montreal,    which unite some distance before they reach the St. Lawrence, flowing    into that river at Point Callières. These little brooks are laid down on    Champlain's local map, _Le Grand Sault St. Louis_, on Charlevoix's    _Carte de l'Isle de Montréal_, 1744, and on Bellin's _L'Isle de    Montréal_, 1764; but they have disappeared on modern maps, and probably    are either extinct or are lost in the sewerage of the city, of which    they have become a part. We have called the stream formed by these two    brooks, note 190, Vol. I., _Rivière St. Pierre_. On Potherie's map, the    only stream coming from the interior is so named. _Vide Histoire de    L'Amerique_ par M. de Bacqueville de la Potherie, 1722, p. 311. On a map    in Greig's _Hochelaga Depicta_, 1839, it is called St. Peter's River.    The same stream on Bouchette's map, 1830, is denominated Little River.    It seems not unlikely that a part of it was called, at one time, Rivière    St. Pierre, and another part Petite Rivière.     It is plain that on this stream was situated the sixty acres of cleared    land alluded to in the text as formerly occupied by the savages.     It will be remembered that seventy-six years anterior to this, in 1535,    Jacques Cartier discovered this place, which was then the seat of a    large and flourishing Indian town. It is to be regretted that Champlain    did not inform us more definitely as to the history of the former    occupants of the soil. Some important, and we think conclusive, reasons    have been assigned for supposing that they were a tribe of the Iroquois.    Among others may be mentioned the similarity in the construction of    their towns and houses or cabins, the identity of their language as    determined by a collation of the words found in Cartier's journal with    the language of the Iroquois; and to these may be added the traditions    obtained by missionaries and others, as cited by Laverdière, to which we    must not, however, attach too much value. _Vide Laverdière in loco_.    While it seems probable that the former occupants were of the Iroquois    family, it is impossible to determine whether on retiring they joined    the Five Nations in the State of New York, or merged themselves with the    Hurons, who were likewise of Iroquois origin.  6. I am unable to identify this plant. Its climbing propensity and the    color of its fruit suggest _Rhus radicans_, but in other respects the    similarity fails.  7. _Cerfs, Daims, Cheureuls, Caribous_. Champlain employs the names of the    different species of the Cerf family as used in Europe; but as our    species are different, this use of names creates some confusion. There    were in Canada, the moose, the caribou, the wapiti, and the common red    deer. Any enumeration by the early writers must include these, under    whatever names they may be described. One will be found applying a name    to a given species, while another will apply the same name to quite a    different species. Charlevoix mentions the orignal (moose) caribou, the    hart, and the roebuck. Under the name _hart_, he probably refers to the    wapiti, _elaphus Canadensis_, and _roe-buck_, to the common red deer,    _Cervus Virginianus_. _Vide Charlevoix's Letters to the Dutchess of    Lesdiguieres_, 1763, pp. 64-69, also Vol. I. of this work, p. 265.  8. Lynxes, _Loups-serviers_. The compound word _loup-cervier_ was    significant, and was applied originally to the animal of which the stag    was its natural prey, _qui attaque les cerfs_. In Europe it described    the lynx, a large powerful animal of the feline race, that might well    venture to attack the stag. But in Canada this species is not found.    What is known as the Canadian lynx, _Felis Canadensis_, is only a large    species of cat, which preys upon birds and the smaller quadrupeds.    Champlain probably gives it the name _loup-servier_ for the want of one    more appropriate. It is a little remarkable that he does not in this    list mention the American wolf, _Lupus occidentalis_, so common in every    part of Canada, and which he subsequently refers to as the animal    especially dreaded by the deer. _Vide postea_, pp. 139, 157.  9. The site of Place Royale was on Point Callières, so named in honor of    Chevalier Louis Hector de Callières Bonnevue, governor of Montreal in    1684.  10. It seems most likely that the name of this island was suggested by the     marriage which Champlain had contracted with Hélène Boullé, the year     before. This name had been given to several other places. _Vide_ Vol.     I. pp. 104, 105.  11. _Vide_ Vol. I. p. 268, note 191. _Walker and Miles's Atlas_, map 186.  12. The Lake of the Two Mountains. _Vide antea_, note 4.  13. On Champlain's local map of the Falls of St. Louis, the letter Q is     wanting; but the expression, _ceste isle est au milieu du faut_, in the     middle of the fall, as suggested by Laverdière, indicates that the     island designated by the letter R is Heron Island. _Vide postea_, R on     map at p. 18.  14. _Grand Tibie_, so in the original. This is a typographical error for     _grand terre_. _Vide_ Champlain, 1632, Quebec ed., p. 842.  15. The death of this young man may have suggested the name which was     afterward given to the fall. He was, however, it is reasonable to     suppose, hardly equal in sanctity of character to the Saint Louis of     the French. Hitherto it had been called _Le Grand Saut_. But soon after     this it began to be called _Grand Saut S. Louys_. _Vide postea_,     pp. 38, 51, 59.     CHAPTER III.  TWO HUNDRED SAVAGES RETURN THE FRENCHMAN WHO HAD BEEN ENTRUSTED TO THEM, AND RECEIVE THE SAVAGE WHO HAD COME BACK FROM FRANCE.--VARIOUS INTERVIEWS ON BOTH SIDES.   On the thirteenth day of the month [16] two hundred Charioquois [17] savages, together with the captains Ochateguin, Iroquet, and Tregouaroti, brother of our savage, brought back my servant. [18] We were greatly pleased to see them. I went to meet them in a canoe with our savage. As they were approaching slowly and in order, our men prepared to salute them with a discharge of arquebuses, muskets, and small pieces. When they were near at hand, they all set to shouting together, and one of the chiefs gave orders that they should make their harangue, in which they greatly praised us, commending us as truthful, inasmuch as I had kept the promise to meet them at this fall. After they had made three more shouts, there was a discharge of musketry twice from thirteen barques or pataches that were there. This alarmed them so, that they begged me to assure them that there should be no more firing, saying that the greater part of them had never seen Christians, nor heard thunderings of that sort, and that they were afraid of its harming them, but that they were greatly pleased to see our savage in health, whom they supposed was dead, as had been reported by some Algonquins, who had heard so from the Montagnais. The savage commended the treatment I had shown him in France, and the remarkable objects he had seen, at which all wondered, and went away quietly to their cabins, expecting that on the next day I would show them the place where I wished to have them dwell. I saw also my servant, who was dressed in the costume of the savages, who commended the treatment he had received from them. He informed me of all he had seen and learned during the winter, from the savages.  The next day I showed them a spot for their cabins, in regard to which the elders and principal ones consulted very privately. After their long consultation they sent for me alone and my servant, who had learned their language very well. They told him they desired a close alliance with me, and were sorry to see here all these shallops, and that our savage had told them he did not know them at all nor their intentions, and that it was clear that they were attracted only by their desire of gain and their avarice, and that when their assistance was needed they would refuse it, and would not act as I did in offering to go with my companions to their country and assist them, of all of which I had given them proofs in the past. They praised me for the treatment I had shown our savage, which was that of a brother, and had put them under such obligations of good will to me, that they said they would endeavor to comply with anything I might desire from them, but that they feared that"]]]
