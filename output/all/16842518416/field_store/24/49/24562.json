There, Jan and Ted felt sure, no Indians would be seen.  \"But we'll keep watch,\" said Jan to her brother, \"and maybe I'll see an Indian first.\"  \"And maybe I will! We'll both watch!\" he agreed.  Something else that gave the children enjoyment was the passage through the train, every now and then, of the boy who sold candy, books and magazines. He would pass along between the seats, dropping into them, or into the laps of the passengers, packages of candy, or perhaps a paper or book. This was to give the traveler time to look at it, and make up his or her mind whether or not to buy it.  A little later the boy would come along to collect the things he had left, and get the money for those the people kept for themselves. Ted and Jan were very desirous, each time, that the boy should sell something, and once, when he had gone through the car and had taken in no money, he looked so disappointed that Jan whispered to her father:  \"Won't you please buy something from him?\"  \"Buy what?\" asked Mr. Martin.  \"A book or some candy from the newsboy,\" repeated the little girl. \"He looks awful sorry.\"  \"Hum! Well, it is too bad if he didn't sell anything,\" said Mr. Martin. \"I guess I can buy something. What would you like, something to read or something to eat?\"  \"Some pictures to look at,\" suggested Teddy. \"Then we can show 'em to Trouble. Mother just gave us some cookies.\"  \"Then I guess you've had enough to eat,\" laughed Mr. Martin. \"Here, boy!\" he called. \"Have you any picture books for these Curlytops of mine?\"  \"Yes, I have some nice ones,\" answered the boy, and with a smile on his face he went into the baggage car, where he kept his papers, candy and other things, and soon came back with a gaily colored book, at the sight of which Ted and Jan uttered sighs of delight.  \"Dat awful p'etty!\" murmured Trouble, and indeed the book did have nice pictures in it.  Mr. Martin paid for it, and then Ted and Jan enjoyed very much looking at it, with Trouble in the seat between them. He insisted on seeing each picture twice, the page being no sooner turned over than he wanted it turned back again.  But at last even he was satisfied, and then Ted and Jan went back to their first game of looking out of the window for Indians or other sights that might interest them.  Trouble slipped out of his seat between his brother and sister and went to a vacant window himself. For a time he had good fun playing with the window catch, and Mrs. Martin let him do this, having made sure, at first, that he could not open the sash. Then they all forgot Trouble for a while and he played by himself, all alone in one of the seats.  A little later, when Teddy and Janet were tired of looking for the Indians which they never saw, they were talking about the good times they had had with Nicknack, and wondering if Uncle Frank would have a goat, or anything like it, when Trouble came toddling up to their seat.  \"What you got?\" asked Teddy of his little brother, noticing that Baby William was chewing something. \"What you got, Trouble?\"  \"Tandy,\" he said, meaning candy, of course.  \"Oh, where'd you get it?\" chimed in Jan.  \"Nice boy gived it to me,\" Trouble answered. \"Here,\" and he held the package out to his brother and sister.  \"Oh, wasn't that good of him!\" exclaimed Jan. \"It's nice chocolate candy, too. I'll have another piece, Trouble.\"  They all had some and they were eating the sweet stuff and having a good time, when they saw their father looking at them. There was a funny smile on his face, and near him stood the newsboy, also smiling.  \"Trouble, did you open a box of candy the boy left in your seat?\" asked Mr. Martin.  \"Yes, he's got some candy,\" answered Jan. \"He said the boy gave it to him.\"  \"I didn't mean for him to _open_ it,\" the boy said. \"I left it in his seat and I thought he'd ask his father if he could have it. But when I came to get it, why, it was gone.\"  \"Oh, what a funny little Trouble!\" laughed Mother Martin. \"He thought the boy meant to give the candy to him, I guess. Well, Daddy, I think you'll have to pay for it.\"  And so Mr. Martin did. The candy was not a gift after all, but Trouble did not know that. However, it all came out right in the end.  They had been traveling two days, and now, toward evening of the second day, the Curlytops were talking together about what they would do when they got to Uncle Frank's ranch.  \"I hope they have lots to eat there,\" sighed Ted, when he and Jan had gotten off the subject of Indians. \"I'm hungry right now.\"  \"So'm I,\" added his sister. \"But they'll call us to supper pretty soon.\"  The children always eagerly waited for the colored waiter to come through the coaches rumbling out in his bass voice:  \"First call fo' supper in de dinin'-car!\"  Or he might say \"dinner\" or \"breakfast,\" or make it the \"last call,\" just as it happened. Now it was time for the first supper call, and in a little while the waiter came in.  \"Eh? What's that? Time for supper _again_?\" cried Daddy Martin, awakening from a nap.  Trouble stretched and yawned in his mother's arms.  \"I's hungry!\" he said.  \"So'm I!\" cried Ted and Jan together.  \"Shall we have good things to eat on Uncle Frank's ranch?\" asked Teddy, as they made ready to walk ahead to the dining-car.  \"Of course!\" his mother laughed. \"Why are you worrying about that?\"  \"Oh, I just wanted to know,\" Teddy answered. \"We had so many good things at Cherry Farm and when we were camping with grandpa that I want some out on the ranch.\"  \"Well, I think we can trust to Uncle Frank,\" said Mr. Martin. \"But if you get too hungry, Teddy, you can go out and lasso a beefsteak or catch a bear or deer and have him for breakfast.\"  \"Is there bears out there, too?\" asked Janet in a good deal of excitement. \"Bears and Indians?\"  \"Well, there may be a few bears here and there,\" her father said with a smile, \"but they won't hurt you if you don't hurt them. Now we'll go and see what they have for supper here.\"  To the dining-car they went, and as they passed through one of the coaches on their way Teddy and Janet heard a woman say to her little girl:  \"Look at those Curlytops, Ethel. Don't you wish you could have some of their curl put into your hair?\"  It was evening and the sun was setting. As the train sped along the Curlytops could look through the windows off across the fields and woods through which they passed.  \"Isn't it just wonderful,\" said Mother Martin, \"to think of sitting down to a nice meal which is being cooked for us while the train goes so fast? Imagine, children, how, years ago, the cowboys and hunters had to go on horses all the distance out West, and carry their food on their pony's back or in a wagon called a prairie schooner. How much easier and quicker and more comfortable it is to travel this way.\"  \"I'd like to ride on a pony,\" said Teddy. \"I wouldn't care how slow he went.\"  \"I imagine you wouldn't like it when night came,\" said his mother, as she moved a plate so the waiter could set glasses of milk in front of the children. \"You wouldn't like to sleep on the ground with only a blanket for a bed, would you?\"  \"'Deed I would!\" declared Teddy. \"I wish I had--\"  Just then the train went around a curve, and, as it was traveling very fast, the milk which Teddy was raising to his mouth slopped and spilled down in his lap.  \"Oh, Teddy!\" cried his mother.  \"I--I couldn't help it!\" he exclaimed, as he wiped up as much of the milk as he could on a napkin with which the waiter hastened to him.  \"No, we know it was the train,\" said Daddy Martin. \"It wouldn't have happened if you had been traveling on pony-back, and had stopped to camp out for the night before you got your supper; would it, Ted?\" he asked with a smile.  \"No,\" said the little boy. \"I wish we could camp out and hunt Indians!\"  \"Oh my goodness!\" exclaimed his mother. \"Don't get such foolish notions in your head. Anyway there aren't any Indians to hunt on Uncle Frank's ranch, are there, Dick?\" she asked her husband.  \"Well, no, I guess not,\" he answered slowly. \"There are some Indians on their own ranch, or government reservation, not far from where Uncle Frank has his horses and cattle, but I guess the Redmen never bother anyone.\"  \"Can we go to see 'em?\" asked Teddy.  \"I guess so,\" said Mr. Martin.  \"Me go, too! Me like engines,\" murmured Trouble, who had also spilled a little milk on himself.  \"He thinks we're talking about _engines_--the kind that pull this train!\" laughed Ted. \"I don't believe he ever saw a real _Indian.\"_  \"No, Indians do not walk the streets of Cresco,\" said Mrs. Martin. \"But finish your suppers, children. Others are waiting to use the table and we must not keep them too long.\"  There were many travelers going West--not all as far as the Curlytops though--and as there was not room in the dining-car for all of them to sit down at once they had to take turns. That is why the waiter made one, two, and sometimes three calls for each meal, as he went through the different coaches.  Supper over, the Martins went back to their place in the coach in which they had ridden all day. They would soon go into the beds, or berths, as they are called, to sleep all night. In the morning they would be several hundred miles nearer Uncle Frank's ranch.  The electric lights were turned on, and then, for a while, Jan, Ted and the others sat and talked.  They talked about the fun they had had when at Cherry Farm, of the good times camping with grandpa and how they were snowed in, when they wondered what had become of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6814"],["title","The Curlytops at Uncle Frank's Ranch; Or, Little Folks on Ponyback (#5)"],["body"," lame boy who had called at Mr. Martin's store one day.  \"I wish Hal Chester could come out West with us\" said Teddy, as the porter came to tell them he would soon make up their beds. \"He'd like to hunt Indians with me.\"  Hal was a boy who had been cured of lameness at a Home for Crippled Children, not far from Cherry Farm.  \"I suppose you'll _dream_ of Indians,\" said Teddy's mother to him. \"You've _talked_ about them all day. But get ready for bed, now. Traveling is tiresome for little folks.\"  Indeed after the first day Ted and Janet found it so. They wished, more than once, that they could get out and run about, but they could not except when the train stopped longer than usual in some big city. Then their father would take them to the platform for a little run up and down.  True they could walk up and down the aisle of the car, but this was not much fun, as the coach swayed so they were tossed against the sides of the seats and bruised.  \"I'll be glad when we get to Uncle Frank's ranch,\" said Janet as she crawled into the berth above her mother, who slept with Trouble.  \"So'll I,\" agreed Teddy, who climbed up the funny little ladder to go to bed in the berth above his father. \"I want a pony ride!\"  On through the night rumbled and roared the train, the whistle sounding mournfully in the darkness as the engineer blew it at the crossings.  Ted and Janet were sleeping soundly, Janet dreaming she had a new doll, dressed like an Indian papoose, or baby, while Ted dreamed he was on a wild pony that wanted to roll over and over instead of galloping straight on.  Suddenly there was a loud crash that sounded through the whole train. The engine whistled shrilly and then came a jar that shook up everyone. Teddy found himself rolling out of his berth and he grabbed the curtains just in time to save himself.  \"Oh, Daddy!\" he cried, \"what's the matter?\"  \"What is it?\" called Jan from her berth, while women in the coach were screaming and men ere calling to one another.  \"What is it, Dick?\" cried Mrs. Martin.  \"I think we've had a collision,\" answered her husband.  \"Did our train bunk into another?\" asked Ted.  \"I'm afraid so,\" replied his father.     CHAPTER V  AT RING ROSY RANCH   There was so much noise in the sleeping car where the Curlytops and others had been peacefully traveling through the night, that, at first, it was hard to tell what had happened.  All that anyone knew was that there had been a severe jolt--a \"bunk\" Teddy called it--and that the train had come to a sudden stop. So quickly had it stopped, in fact, that a fat man, who was asleep in a berth just behind Mr. Martin, had tumbled out and now sat in the aisle of the car, gazing about him, a queer look on his sleepy face, for he was not yet fully awake.  \"I say!\" cried the fat man. \"Who pushed me out of bed?\"  Even though they were much frightened, Mrs. Martin and some of the other men and women could not help laughing at this. And the laughter did more to quiet them than anything else.  \"Well, I guess no one here is much hurt--if at all,\" said Daddy Martin, as he put on a pair of soft slippers he had ready in the little hammock that held his clothes inside the berth. \"I'll go and see if I can find out what the matter is.\"  \"An', Daddy, bring me suffin t'eat!\" exclaimed Trouble, poking his head out between the curtains of the berth where he had been sleeping with his mother when the collision happened.  \"There's one boy that's got sense,\" said a tall thin man, who was helping the fat man to get to his feet \"He isn't hurt, anyhow.\"  \"Thank goodness, no,\" said Mrs. Martin, who, as had some of the other women, had on a dressing gown. Mrs. Martin was looking at Trouble, whom she had taken up in her arms. \"He hasn't a scratch on him,\" she said, \"though I heard him slam right against the side of the car. He was next to the window.\"  \"It's a mercy we weren't all of us tossed out of the windows when the train stopped so suddenly, the way it did,\" said a little old woman.  \"It's a mercy, too,\" smiled another woman who had previously made friends with Jan and Teddy, \"that the Curlytops did not come hurtling down out of those upper berths.\"  Mr. Martin, after making sure his family was all right, partly dressed and went out with some of the other men. The train had come to a standstill, and Jan and Ted, looking out of the windows of their berths, could see men moving about in the darkness outside with flaring torches.  \"Maybe it's robbers,\" said Teddy in a whisper.  \"Robbers don't stop trains,\" objected Janet  \"Yes they do!\" declared her brother positively, \"Train robbers do. Don't they, Mother?\"  \"Oh, don't talk about such things now, Teddy boy. Be thankful you are all right and hope that no one is hurt in the collision.\"  \"That's what I say!\" exclaimed the fat man. \"So it's a collision, is it? I dreamed we were in a storm and that I was blown out of bed.\"  \"Well, you fell out, which is much the same thing,\" said the thin man. \"Our car doesn't seem to be hurt, anyhow.\"  Ted and Janet came out into the aisle in their pajamas. They looked all about them but, aside from seeing a number of men and women who were greatly excited, nothing else appeared to be the matter. Then in came their father with some of the other men.  \"It isn't a bad collision,\" said Daddy Martin. \"Our engine hit a freight car that was on a side track, but too close to our rails to be passed safely. It jarred up our engine and the front cars quite a bit, and our engine is off the track, but no one is hurt.\"  \"That's good!\" exclaimed Mrs. Martin. \"I mean that no one is hurt.\"  \"How are they going to get the engine back on the track?\" Teddy wanted to know. \"Can't I go out and watch 'em?\"  \"I want to go, too!\" exclaimed Janet.  \"Indeed you can't--in the dark!\" exclaimed her father. \"Besides, the railroad men don't want you in the way. They asked us all to go to our coaches and wait. They'll soon have the engine back on the rails they said.\"  Everyone was awake now, and several children in the car, like Trouble, were hungry. The porter who had been hurrying to and fro said he could get the children some hot milk from the dining-car, and this he did.  Some of the grown folks wanted coffee and sandwiches, and these having been brought in, there was quite a merry picnic in the coach, even if the train had been in a collision.  Then there was much puffing and whistling of the engine. The Curlytops, looking out of the window again, saw more men hurrying here and there with flaring torches which flickered and smoked. These were the trainmen helping to get the engine back on the rails, which they did by using iron wedges or \"jumpers,\" much as a trolley car in your city streets is put back on the rails once it slips off.  At last there was another \"bunk\" to the train, as Teddy called it. At this several women screamed.  \"It's all right,\" said Daddy Martin. \"They've got the engine back on the rails and it has just backed up to couple on, or fasten itself, to the cars again. Now we'll go forward again.\"  And they did--in a little while. It did not take the Curlytops or Trouble long to fall asleep once more, but some of the older people were kept awake until morning, they said afterward. They were afraid of another collision.  But none came, and though the train was a little late the accident really did not amount to much, though it might have been a bad one had the freight car been a little farther over on the track so the engine had run squarely into it.  All the next day and night the Curlytops traveled in the train, and though Jan and Ted liked to look out of the windows, they grew tired of this after a while and began to ask:  \"When shall we be at Uncle Frank's ranch?\"  \"Pretty soon now,\" said their father.  I will not tell you all that happened on the journey to the West. Truth to say there was not much except the collision. The Curly-tops ate their meals, drank cupful after cupful of water, and Trouble did the same, for children seem to get very thirsty when they travel--much more so than at home.  Then, finally, one afternoon, after a long stop when a new engine was attached to the train, Daddy Martin said:  \"Well be at Rockville in an hour now. So we'd better begin to get together our things.\"  \"Shall we be at Uncle Frank's ranch in an hour?\" asked Teddy.  \"No, but well be at Rockville. From there we go out over the prairies in a wagon.\"  \"A wagon with ponies?\" asked Janet.  \"Yes, real Western ponies,\" said her father. \"Then well be at the ranch.\"  And it happened just that way. On puffed the train. Then the porter came to help the Martin family off at Rockville.  \"Rockville! Rockville! All out for Rockville!\" joked Daddy Martin.  \"Hurray!\" cried Teddy. \"Here we are!\"  \"And I see Uncle Frank!\" exclaimed Janet, looking from the window toward the station as the train slowed up to stop.  Out piled the Curlytops, and into the arms of Uncle Frank they rushed. He caught them up and kissed them one after the other--Teddy, Janet and Trouble.  \"Well, well!\" he cried, \"I'm glad to see you! Haven't changed a bit since you were snowed in! Now pile into the wagon and well get right out to Circle O Ranch.\"  \"Where's that?\" asked Teddy.  \"Why, that's the name of my ranch,\" said Uncle Frank. \"See, there's the sign of it,\" and he pointed to the flank of one of the small horses, or ponies, hitched to his wagon. Ted and Janet saw a large circle in which was a smaller letter O.  \"We call it Circle O,\" explained the ranchman. \"Each place in the West that raises cattle or horses has a certain sign with which the animals are branded, or marked, so their owners can tell them from others in case they get mixed up. My mark is a circle around an O.\"  \"It looks like a ring-around-the-rosy,\" said Janet.  \"Say! So it does!\" laughed Uncle Frank. \"I never thought of that. Ring Rosy Ranch! That isn't a half bad name! Guess I'll call mine that after this. Come on to Ring Rosy Ranch!\" he invited as he laughed at the Curlytops.  And"]]]
