But how can we? Every time I hold out some grass to him the big horse takes it.\"  Teddy thought for a minute and then he said:  \"I know what we can do to keep the big horse from getting it all.\"  \"What?\" asked Janet.  \"We can both pull some grass. Then you go to one end of the fence, and hold out your bunch. The big horse will come to get it and push the others away, like he always does.\"  \"But then the little pony won't get any,\" Janet said.  \"Oh, yes, he will!\" cried Teddy. \"'Cause when you're feeding the big horse I'll run up and give the _little_ horse my bunch. Then he'll have some all by himself.\"  And this the Curlytops did. When the big horse was chewing the grass Janet gave him, Ted held out some to the little horse at the other end of the corral, And he ate it, but only just in time, for the big pony saw what was going on and trotted up to shove the small animal out of the way. But it was too late.  Then Janet and Teddy walked on a little further, until Janet said it was growing late and they had better go back to the porch where the others were still talking.  Evening was coming on. The sun had set, but there was still a golden glow in the sky. Far off in one of the big fields a number of horses and cattle could be seen, and riding out near them were some of the cowboys who, after their supper, had gone out to see that all was well for the night.  \"Is all this your land, Uncle Frank!\" asked Teddy as he stood on the porch and looked over the fields.  \"Yes, as far as you can see, and farther. If you Curlytops get lost, which I hope you won't, you'll have to go a good way to get off my ranch. But let me tell you now, not to go too far away from the house, unless your father or some of us grown folks are with you.\"  \"Why?\" asked Janet.  \"Well, you _might_ get lost, you know, and then--oh, well, don't go off by yourselves, that's all,\" and Uncle Frank turned to answer a question Daddy Martin asked him.  Ted and Janet wondered why they could not go off by themselves as they had done at Cherry Farm.  \"Maybe it's because of the Indians,\" suggested Jan.  \"Pooh, I'm not afraid of them,\" Teddy announced.  Just then one of the cowboys--later the children learned he was Jim Mason, the foreman--came walking up to the porch. He walked in a funny way, being more used to going along on a horse than on his own feet.  \"Good evening, folks!\" he said, taking off his hat and waving it toward the Curlytops and the others.  \"Hello, Jim!\" was Uncle Frank's greeting. \"Everything all right?\"  \"No, it isn't, I'm sorry to say,\" answered the foreman. \"I've got bad news for you, Mr. Barton!\"     CHAPTER VIII  A QUEER NOISE   The Curlytops looked at the ranch foreman as he said this. Uncle Frank looked at him, too. The foreman stood twirling his big hat around in his hand. Teddy looked at the big revolver--\"gun\" the cowboys called it--which dangled from Jim Mason's belt.  \"Bad news, is it?\" asked Uncle Frank. \"I'm sorry to hear that. I hope none of the boys is sick. Nobody been shot, has there, during the celebration?\"  \"Oh, no, the boys are all right,\" answered the foreman. \"But it's bad news about some of your ponies--a lot of them you had out on grass over there,\" and he pointed to the west--just where Ted and Janet could not see.  \"Bad news about the ponies?\" repeated Uncle Frank. \"Well, now, I'm sorry to hear that. Some of 'em sick?\"  \"Not as I know of,\" replied Jim. \"But a lot of 'em have been taken away--stolen, I guess I'd better call it.\"  \"A lot of my ponies stolen?\" cried Uncle Frank, jumping up from his chair. \"That is bad news! When did it happen? Why don't you get the cowboys together and chase after the men who took the ponies?\"  \"Well, I would have done that if I knew where to go,\" said the foreman. \"But I didn't hear until a little while ago, when one of the cowboys I sent to see if the ponies were all right came in. He got there to find 'em all gone, so I came right over to tell you.\"  \"Well, we'll have to see about this!\" exclaimed Uncle Frank. \"Who's the cowboy you sent to see about the ponies?\"  \"Henry Jensen. He just got in a little while ago, after a hard ride.\"  \"And who does he think took the horses?\"  \"He said it looked as if the Indians had done it!\" and at these words from the foreman Ted and Janet looked at one another with widely opened eyes.  \"Indians?\" said Uncle Frank. \"Why, I didn't think any of them had come off their reservation.\"  \"Some of 'em must have,\" the foreman went on. \"They didn't have any ponies of their own, I guess, so they took yours and rode off on 'em.\"  \"Well, this is too bad!\" said Uncle Frank in a low voice. \"I guess we'll have to get our boys together and chase after these Indians,\" he went on. \"Yes, that's what I'll do. I've got to get back my ponies.\"  \"Oh, can't I come?\" cried Teddy, not understanding all that was going on, but enough to know that his uncle was going somewhere with the cowboys, and Teddy wanted to go, too.  \"Oh, I'm afraid you couldn't come--Curlytop,\" said the foreman, giving Teddy the name almost everyone called him at first sight, and this was the first time Jim Mason had seen Teddy.  \"No, you little folks must stay at home,\" added Uncle Frank.  \"Are you really going after Indians?\" Teddy wanted to know.  \"Yes, to find out if they took any of my ponies. You see,\" went on Uncle Frank, speaking to Daddy and Mother Martin as well as to the Curlytops, \"the Indians are kept on what is called a 'reservation' That is, the government gives them certain land for their own and they are told they must stay there, though once in a while some of them come off to sell blankets and bark-work at the railroad stations.  \"And, sometimes, maybe once a year, a lot of the Indians get tired of staying on the reservation and some of them will get together and run off. Sometimes they ride away on their own horses, and again they may take some from the nearest ranch. I guess this time they took some of mine.\"  \"And how will you catch them?\" asked Mrs. Martin.  \"Oh, we'll try to find out which way they went and then we'll follow after them until we catch them and get back the ponies.\"  \"It's just like hide-and-go-seek, isn't it, Uncle Frank?\" asked Janet.  \"Yes, something like that But it takes longer.\"  \"I wish I could go to hunt the Indians!\" murmured Teddy.  \"Why, The-o-dore Mar-tin!\" exclaimed his mother. \"I'm _surprised_ at you!\"  \"Well, I would like to go,\" he said.  \"Could I go if I knew how to ride a pony, Uncle Frank?\"  \"Well, I don't know. I'm afraid you're too little. But, speaking of riding a pony, to-morrow I'll have one of the cowboys start in to teach you and Janet to ride. Now I guess I'll have to go see this Henry Jensen and ask him about the Indians and my stolen ponies.\"  \"I hope he gets them back,\" said Teddy to his sister.  \"So do I,\" she agreed. \"And I hope those Indians don't come here.\"  \"Pooh! they're tame Indians!\" exclaimed Teddy.  \"They must be kind of wild when they steal ponies,\" Janet said.  A little later the Curlytops and Trouble went to bed, for they had been up early that day. They fell asleep almost at once, even though their bed was not moving along in a railroad train, as it had been the last three or four nights.  \"Did Uncle Frank find his ponies?\" asked Teddy the next morning at the breakfast table.  \"No, Curlytop,\" answered Aunt Millie. \"He and some of the cowboys have gone over to the field where the ponies were kept to see if they can get any news of them.\"  \"Can we learn to ride a pony to-day?\" asked Janet.  \"As soon as Uncle Frank comes back,\" answered her father. \"You and Ted and Trouble play around the house now as much as you like. When Uncle Frank comes back he'll see about getting a pony for you to ride.\"  \"Come on!\" called Ted to his sister after breakfast. \"We'll have some fun.\"  \"I come, too!\" called Trouble. \"I wants a wide! I wish we had Nicknack.\"  \"It would be fun if we had our goat here, wouldn't it?\" asked Janet of her brother.  \"Yes, but I'd rather have a pony. I'm going to be a cowboy, and you can't be a cowboy and ride a _goat_.\"  \"No, I s'pose not,\" said Janet. \"But a goat isn't so high up as a pony, Ted, and if you fall off a goat's back you don't hurt yourself so much.\"  \"I'm not going to fall off,\" declared Teddy.  The children wandered about among the ranch buildings, looking in the bunk house where the cowboys slept. There was only one person in there, and he was an old man to be called a \"boy,\" thought Janet. But all men, whether young or old, who look after the cattle on a ranch, are called \"cowboys\" so age does not matter.  \"Howdy,\" said this cowboy with a cheerful smile, as the Curlytops looked in at him. He was mending a broken strap to his saddle. \"Where'd you get that curly hair?\" he asked. \"I lost some just like that. Wonder if you got mine?\"  Janet hardly knew what to make of this, but Teddy said:  \"No, sir. This is _our_ hair. It's fast to our heads and we've had it a long time.\"  \"It was always curly this way,\" added Janet.  \"Oh, was it? Well, then it can't be mine,\" said the cowboy with a laugh. \"Mine was curly only when I was a baby, and that was a good many years ago. Are you going to live here?\"  \"We're going to stay all summer,\" Janet said. \"Do you live here?\"  \"Well, yes; as much as anywhere.\"  \"Could you show us where the Indians are that took Uncle Frank's ponies?\" Teddy demanded.  \"Wish I could!\" exclaimed the cowboy. \"If I knew, I'd go after 'em myself and get the ponies back. I guess those Indians are pretty far away from here by now.\"  \"Do they hide?\" asked Teddy.  \"Yes, they may hide away among the hills and wait for a chance to sell the ponies they stole from your uncle. But don't worry your curly heads about Indians. Have a good time here. It seems good to see little children around a place like this.\"  \"Have you got a lasso?\" asked Teddy.  \"You mean my rope?

The Arctic Prairies  A Canoe-Journey  OF 2,000 MILES IN SEARCH OF THE CARIBOU  BEING THE ACCOUNT OF A VOYAGE TO THE REGION NORTH OF AYLMER LAKE   By Ernest Thompson Seton  Author of \"Wild Animals I Have Known\", \"Life Histories\", Etc.    DEDICATED  TO  THE RIGHT HONOURABLE SIR WILFRID LAURIER, G. C. M. G. PREMIER OF CANADA   PREFACE   What young man of our race would not gladly give a year of his life to roll backward the scroll of time for five decades and live that year in the romantic bygone-days of the Wild West; to see the great Missouri while the Buffalo pastured on its banks, while big game teemed in sight and the red man roamed and hunted, unchecked by fence or hint of white man's rule; or, when that rule was represented only by scattered trading-posts, hundreds of miles apart, and at best the traders could exchange the news by horse or canoe and months of lonely travel?  I for one, would have rejoiced in tenfold payment for the privilege of this backward look in our age, and had reached the middle life before I realised that, at a much less heavy cost, the miracle was possible today.  For the uncivilised Indian still roams the far reaches of absolutely unchanged, unbroken forest and prairie leagues, and has knowledge of white men only in bartering furs at the scattered trading-posts, where locomotive and telegraph are unknown; still the wild Buffalo elude the hunters, fight the Wolves, wallow, wander, and breed; and still there is hoofed game by the million to be found where the Saxon is as seldom seen as on the Missouri in the times of Lewis and Clarke. Only we must seek it all, not in the West, but in the far North-west; and for \"Missouri and Mississippi\" read \"Peace and Mackenzie Rivers,\" those noble streams that northward roll their mile-wide turbid floods a thousand leagues to the silent Arctic Sea.  This was the thought which spurred me to a six months' journey by canoe. And I found what I went in search of, but found, also, abundant and better rewards that were not in mind, even as Saul, the son of Kish, went seeking asses and found for himself a crown and a great kingdom.  Four years have gone by since I lived through these experiences. Such a lapse of time may have made my news grow stale, but it has also given the opportunity for the working up of specimens and scientific records. The results, for the most part, will be found in the Appendices, and three of these, as indicated--namely, the sections on Plants, Mammals, and Birds--are the joint work of my assistant, Mr. Edward A. Preble, and myself.  My thanks are due here to the Right Honourable Lord Strathcona, G. C. M. G., Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, for giving me access to the records of the Company whenever I needed them for historical purposes; to the Honourable Frank Oliver, Minister of the Interior, Canada, for the necessary papers and permits to facilitate scientific collection, and also to Clarence C. Chipman, Esq., of Winnipeg, the Hudson's Bay Company's Commissioner, for practical help in preparing my outfit, and for letters of introduction to the many officers of the Company, whose kind help was so often a Godsend.  ERNEST THOMPSON SETON.     CHAPTER I  DEPARTURE FOR THE NORTH    In 1907 I set out to journey by canoe down the Athabaska and adjoining waters to the sole remaining forest wilds--the far north-west of Canada--and the yet more desert Arctic Plains, where still, it was said, were to be seen the Caribou in their primitive condition.  My only companion was Edward A. Preble, of Washington, D. C., a trained naturalist,--an expert canoeist and traveller, and a man of three seasons' experience in the Hudson's Bay Territory and the Mackenzie Valley. While my chief object was to see the Caribou, and prove their continued abundance, I was prepared incidentally to gather natural-history material of all kinds, and to complete the shore line of the ambiguous lake called \"Aylmer,\" as well as explore its sister, the better-known Clinton-Colden.  I went for my own pleasure at my own expense, and yet I could not persuade my Hudson's Bay Company friends that I was not sent by some government, museum or society for some secret purpose.  On the night of May 5 we left Winnipeg, and our observations began with the day at Brandon.  From that point westward to Regina we saw abundant evidence that last year had been a \"rabbit year,\" that is, a year in which the ever-fluctuating population of Northern Hares (Snowshoe-rabbits or White-rabbits) had reached its maximum, for nine-tenths of the bushes in sight from the train had been barked at the snow level. But the fact that we saw not one Rabbit shows that \"the plague\" had appeared, had run its usual drastic course, and nearly exterminated the species in this particular region.  Early next morning at Kininvie (40 miles west of Medicine Hat, Alberta) we saw a band of 4 Antelope south of the track; later we saw others all along as far as Gleichen. All were south of the track. The bands contained as follows: 4, 14, 18, 8, 12, 8, 4, 1, 4, 5, 4, 6, 4, 18, 2, 6, 34, 6, 3, 1, 10, 25, 16, 3, 7, 9 (almost never 2, probably because this species does not pair), or 232 Antelope in 26 bands along 70 miles of track; but all were on the south side; not one was noted on the north.  The case is simple. During the past winter, while the Antelope were gone southward, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company had fenced its track. In spring the migrants, returning, found themselves cut off from their summer feeding-grounds by those impassable barb-wires, and so were gathered against the barrier. One band of 8, at a stopping place, ran off when they saw passengers alighting, but at half a mile they turned, and again came up against the fence, showing how strong is the northward impulse.  Unless they learn some way of mastering the difficulty, it means extermination for the Antelope of the north Saskatchewan.  From Calgary we went by train to Edmonton. This is the point of leaving the railway, the beginning of hard travel, and here we waited a few days to gather together our various shipments of food and equipment, and to await notice that the river was open.  In the north the grand event of the year is the opening of the rivers. The day when the ice goes out is the official first day of spring, the beginning of the season; and is eagerly looked for, as every day's delay means serious loss to the traders, whose men are idle, but drawing pay as though at work.  On May 11, having learned that the Athabaska was open, we left Edmonton in a livery rig, and drove 94 miles northward though a most promising, half-settled country, and late the next day arrived at Athabaska Landing, on the great east tributary of the Mackenzie, whose waters were to bear us onward for so many weeks.  Athabaska Landing is a typical frontier town. These are hard words, but justified. We put up at the principal hotel; the other lodgers told me it was considered the worst hotel in the world. I thought I knew of two worse, but next morning accepted the prevailing view.  Our canoe and provisions arrived, but the great convoy of scows that were to take the annual supplies of trade stuff for the far north was not ready, and we needed the help and guidance of its men, so must needs wait for four days.  This gave us the opportunity to study the local natural history and do a little collecting, the results of which appear later.  The great size of the timber here impressed me. I measured a typical black poplar (P. balsamifera), 100 feet to the top, 8 feet 2 inches in circumference, at 18 inches from the ground, and I saw many thicker, but none taller.  At the hotel, also awaiting the scows, was a body of four (dis-)Mounted Police, bound like ourselves for the far north. The officer in charge turned out to be an old friend from Toronto, Major A. M. Jarvis. I also met John Schott, the gigantic half-breed, who went to the Barren Grounds with Caspar Whitney in 1895. He seemed to have great respect for Whitney as a tramper, and talked much of the trip, evidently having forgotten his own shortcomings of the time. While I sketched his portrait, he regaled me with memories of his early days on Red River, where he was born in 1841. 1 did not fail to make what notes I could of those now historic times. His accounts of the Antelope on White Horse Plain, in 1855, and Buffalo about the site of Carberry, Manitoba, in 1852, were new and valuable light on the ancient ranges of these passing creatures.  All travellers who had preceded me into the Barren Grounds had relied on the abundant game, and in consequence suffered dreadful hardships; in some cases even starved to death. I proposed to rely on no game, but to take plenty of groceries, the best I could buy in Winnipeg, which means the best in the world; and, as will be seen later, the game, because I was not relying on it, walked into camp every day.  But one canoe could not carry all these provisions, so most of it I shipped on the Hudson's Bay Company scows, taking with us, in the canoe, food for not more than a week, which with camp outfit was just enough for ballast.  Of course I was in close touch with the Hudson's Bay people. Although nominally that great trading company parted with its autocratic power and exclusive franchise in 1870, it is still the sovereign of the north. And here let me correct an error that is sometimes found even in respectable print--the Company has at all times been ready to assist scientists to the utmost of its very ample power. Although jealous of its trading rights, every one is free to enter the territory without taking count of the Company, but there has not yet been a successful scientific expedition into the region without its active co-operation.  The Hudson's Bay Company has always been the guardian angel of the north.  I suppose that there never yet was another purely commercial concern that so fully realized the moral obligations of its great power,"]]]
