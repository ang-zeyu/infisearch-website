At this he cried out, and all the others after him, with great demonstrations of joy, saying, Your people are awaiting you at the harbor of Tadoussac.  The same day we arrived at Tadoussac, and although we had set out last, nevertheless arrived first, Sieur Boyer of Rouen arriving with the same tide. From this it is evident that to set out before the season is simply rushing into the ice. When we had anchored, our friends came out to us, and, after informing us how everything was at the habitation, began to dress three _outardes_ [32] and two hares, which they had brought, throwing the entrails overboard, after which the poor savages rushed, and, like famished beasts, devoured them without drawing. They also scraped off with their nails the fat with which our vessel had been coated, eating it gluttonously as if they had found some great delicacy.  The next day two vessels arrived from St. Malo, which had set out before the oppositions had been settled and the commission been published in Normandy. I proceeded on board, accompanied by L'Ange. The Sieurs de la Moinerie and la Tremblaye were in command, to whom I read the commission of the King, and the prohibition against violating it on penalties attached to the same. They replied that they were subjects and faithful servants of His Majesty, and that they would obey his commands; and I then had attached to a post in the port the arms and commission of His Majesty, that no ground for ignorance might be claimed.  On the 2d of May, seeing two shallops equipped to go to the Falls, I embarked with the before-mentioned L'Ange in one of them. We had very bad weather, so that the masts of our shallop were broken, and had it not been for the preserving hand of God we should have been lost, as was before our eyes a shallop from St Malo, which was going to the Isle d'Orleans, those on board of which however being saved.  On the 7th we arrived at Quebec, where we found in good condition those who had wintered there, they not having been sick; they told us that the winter had not been severe, and that the river had not frozen. The trees also were beginning to put forth leaves and the fields to be decked with flowers.  On the 13th we set out from Quebec for the Falls of St. Louis, where we arrived on the 21st, finding there one of, our barques which had set out after us from Tadoussac, and which had traded some with a small troop of Algonquins, who came from the war with the Iroquois, and had with them two prisoners. Those in the barque gave them to understand that I had come with a number of men to assist them in their wars, according to the promise I had made them in previous years; also that I desired to go to their country and enter into an alliance with all their friends, at which they were greatly pleased. And, inasmuch as they were desirous of returning to their country to assure their friends of their victory, see their wives, and put to death their prisoners in a festive _tabagie_, they left us pledges of their return, which they promised should be before the middle of the first moon, according to their reckoning, their shields made of wood and elk leather, and a part of their bows and arrows. I regretted very much that I was not prepared to go with them to their country.  Three days after, three canoes arrived with Algonquins, who had come from the interior, with some articles of merchandise which they bartered. They told me that the bad treatment which the savages had received the year before had discouraged them from coming any more, and that they did not believe that I would ever return to their country on account of the wrong impressions which those jealous of me had given them respecting me; wherefore twelve hundred men had gone to the war, having no more hope from the French, who, they did not believe, would return again to their country.  This intelligence greatly disheartened the merchants, as they had made a great purchase of merchandise, with the expectation that the savages would come, as they had been accustomed to. This led me to resolve, as I engaged in my explorations, to pass through their country, in order to encourage those who had stayed back, with an assurance of the good treatment they would receive, and of the large amount of good merchandise at the Fall, and also of the desire I had to assist them in their war. For carrying out this purpose I requested three canoes and three savages to guide us, but after much difficulty obtained only two and one savage, and this by means of some presents made them.  ENDNOTES:  30. The _island_ refers to New Foundland. Cap de Raye, still known as Cape     Ray, was on the southwestern angle of New Foundland.  31. Now called Point aux Vaches. It was sometimes called All-Devils'     Point. _Vide_ note 136, Vol. I. p. 235.  32. _Outardes_. Sometimes written _houtardes_, and _Oltardes_. The name     outarde or bustard, the _otis_ of ornithologists, a land bird of     Europe, was applied to a species of goose in Canada at a very early     period.      The outarde is mentioned by Cartier in 1535, and the name may have been     originally applied by the fishermen and fur-traders at a much earlier     period, doubtless on account of some fancied resemblance which they saw     to the lesser bustard or outarde, which was about the size of the     English pheasant. _Vide Pennant's British Zoölogy_, Vol. I. p. 379.     Cartier, Champlain, Lescarbot, Baron La Hontan, Potherie, and Charlvoix     mention the outarde in catalogues of water-fowl in which _oye_, the     goose, is likewise mentioned. They very clearly distinguish it from the     class which they commonly considered _oyes_, or geese.  Cartier, for     instance, says, Il y a aussi grand nombre d'oyseaulx, scauoir grues,     signes, _oltardes, oyes sauuages, blanches, & grises_. Others speak of     _outardes et oyes_. They do not generally describe it with     particularity. Champlain, however, in describing the turkey, _cocq     d'Inde_, on the coast of New England, says, _aussi gros qu'vne outarde,     qui est une espece d'oye_.  Father Pierre Biard writes, _et au mesme     temps les outardes arriuent du midy, qui sont grosses cannes au double     des nostres_. From these statements it is obvious that the outarde was     a species of goose, but was so small that it could well be described as     a large duck. In New France there were at least four species of the     goose, which might have come under the observation of the early     navigators and explorers. We give them in the order of their size, as     described in Coues' Key to North American Birds.        1. Canada Goose, _Branta Canadensis_, SCOPOLI, 36 inches.       2. Snow Goose, _Anser hyperboreus_, LINNÆUS, 30 inches.       3. Am. White-fronted Goose, _Anser albifrons_, LINNÆUS, 27 inches.       4. Brant Goose, _Branta bernicla_, SCOPOLI, 24 inches.      Recurring to the statement of Cartier above cited, it will be observed     that he mentions, besides the outarde, wild geese white and gray. The     first and largest of the four species above mentioned, the Canada     goose, _Branta Canadensis_, is gray, and the two next, the Snow goose     and White-fronted, would be classified as white. This disposes of three     of the four mentioned. The outarde of Cartier would therefore be the     fourth species in the list, viz. the Brant goose. _Branta bernicla_.     This is the smallest species found on our northern coast, and might     naturally be described, as stated by Father Biard, as a large duck. It     is obvious that the good Father could not have described the Canada     goose, the largest of the four species, as a large duck, and the white     geese have never been supposed to be referred to under the name of     outarde. The Brant goose, to which all the evidence which we have been     able to find in the Canadian authorities seems to point as the outarde     of early times, is common in our markets in its season, but our     market-men, unaccustomed to make scientific distinctions, are puzzled     to decide whether it should be classed as a goose or a duck. It is not     improbable that the early voyagers to our northern latitudes, unable to     decide to which of these classes this water-fowl properly belonged, and     seeing in it a fancied resemblance to the lesser outarde, with which     they were familiar, gave it for sake of the distinction, but     nevertheless inappropriately, the name of outarde.

G. WODEHOUSE  1921     CHAPTER ONE   Through the curtained windows of the furnished apartment which Mrs. Horace Hignett had rented for her stay in New York rays of golden sunlight peeped in like the foremost spies of some advancing army. It was a fine summer morning. The hands of the Dutch clock in the hall pointed to thirteen minutes past nine; those of the ormolu clock in the sitting-room to eleven minutes past ten; those of the carriage clock on the bookshelf to fourteen minutes to six. In other words, it was exactly eight; and Mrs. Hignett acknowledged the fact by moving her head on the pillow, opening her eyes, and sitting up in bed. She always woke at eight precisely.  Was this Mrs. Hignett _the_ Mrs. Hignett, the world-famous writer on Theosophy, the author of \"The Spreading Light,\" \"What of the Morrow,\" and all the rest of that well-known series? I'm glad you asked me. Yes, she was. She had come over to America on a lecturing tour.  The year 1921, it will be remembered, was a trying one for the inhabitants of the United States. Every boat that arrived from England brought a fresh swarm of British lecturers to the country. Novelists, poets, scientists, philosophers, and plain, ordinary bores; some herd instinct seemed to affect them all simultaneously. It was like one of those great race movements of the Middle Ages. Men and women of widely differing views on religion, art, politics, and almost every other subject; on this one point the intellectuals of Great Britain were single-minded, that there was easy money to be picked up on the lecture platforms of America and that they might just as well grab it as the next person.  Mrs. Hignett had come over with the first batch of immigrants; for, spiritual as her writings were, there was a solid streak of business sense in this woman and she meant to get hers while the getting was good. She was half way across the Atlantic with a complete itinerary booked before 90 per cent. of the poets and philosophers had finished sorting out their clean collars and getting their photographs taken for the passport.  She had not left England without a pang, for departure had involved sacrifices. More than anything else in the world she loved her charming home, Windles, in the county of Hampshire, for so many years the seat of the Hignett family. Windles was as the breath of life to her. Its shady walks, its silver lake, its noble elms, the old grey stone of its walls--these were bound up with her very being. She felt that she belonged to Windles, and Windles to her. Unfortunately, as a matter of cold, legal accuracy, it did not. She did but hold it in trust for her son, Eustace, until such time as he should marry and take possession of it himself. There were times when the thought of Eustace marrying and bringing a strange woman to Windles chilled Mrs. Hignett to her very marrow. Happily, her firm policy of keeping her son permanently under her eye at home and never permitting him to have speech with a female below the age of fifty had averted the peril up till now.  Eustace had accompanied his mother to America. It was his faint snores which she could hear in the adjoining room, as, having bathed and dressed, she went down the hall to where breakfast awaited her. She smiled tolerantly. She had never desired to convert her son to her own early rising habits, for, apart from not allowing him to call his soul his own, she was an indulgent mother. Eustace would get up at half-past nine, long after she had finished breakfast, read her mail, and started her duties for the day.  Breakfast was on the table in the sitting-room, a modest meal of rolls, cereal, and imitation coffee. Beside the pot containing this hell-brew was a little pile of letters. Mrs. Hignett opened them as she ate. The majority were from disciples and dealt with matters of purely theosophical interest. There was an invitation from the Butterfly Club asking her to be the guest of honour at their weekly dinner. There was a letter from her brother Mallaby--Sir Mallaby Marlowe, the eminent London lawyer--saying that his son Sam, of whom she had never approved, would be in New York shortly, passing through on his way back to England, and hoping that she would see something of him. Altogether a dull mail. Mrs. Hignett skimmed through it without interest, setting aside one or two of the letters for Eustace, who acted as her unpaid secretary, to answer later in the day.  She had just risen from the table when there was a sound of voices in the hall, and presently the domestic staff, a gaunt Irish lady of advanced years, entered the room.  \"Ma'am, there was a gentleman.\"  Mrs. Hignett was annoyed. Her mornings were sacred.  \"Didn't you tell him I was not to be disturbed?\"  \"I did not. I loosed him into the parlor.\"  The staff remained for a moment in melancholy silence, then resumed. \"He says he's your nephew. His name's Marlowe.\"  Mrs. Hignett experienced no diminution of her annoyance. She had not seen her nephew Sam for ten years and would have been willing to extend the period. She remembered him as an untidy small boy who, once or twice, during his school holidays, had disturbed the cloistral peace of Windles with his beastly presence. However, blood being thicker than water, and all that sort of thing, she supposed she would have to give him five minutes. She went into the sitting-room and found there a young man who looked more or less like all other young men, though perhaps rather fitter than most. He had grown a good deal since she had last met him, as men will do between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five, and was now about six feet in height, about forty inches round the chest, and in weight about one hundred and eighty pounds. He had a brown and amiable face, marred at the moment by an expression of discomfort somewhat akin to that of a cat in a strange alley.  \"Hallo, Aunt Adeline!\" he said awkwardly.  \"Well, Samuel!\" said Mrs. Hignett.  There was a pause. Mrs. Hignett, who was not fond of young men and disliked having her mornings broken into, was thinking that he had not improved in the slightest degree since their last meeting; and Sam, who imagined that he had long since grown to man's estate and put off childish things, was embarrassed to discover that his aunt still affected him as of old. That is to say, she made him feel as if he had omitted to shave, and, in addition to that, had swallowed some drug which had caused him to swell unpleasantly, particularly about the hands and feet.  \"Jolly morning,\" said Sam, perseveringly.  \"So I imagine. I have not yet been out.\"  \"Thought I'd look in and see how you were.\"  \"That was very kind of you. The morning is my busy time, but ... yes, that was very kind of you!\"  There was another pause.  \"How do you like America?\" said Sam.  \"I dislike it exceedingly.\"  \"Yes? Well, of course some people do. Prohibition and all that. Personally, it doesn't affect me. I can take it or leave it alone.\"  \"The reason I dislike America--\" began Mrs. Hignett bridling.  \"I like it myself,\" said Sam. \"I've had a wonderful time. Everybody's treated me like a rich uncle. I've been in Detroit, you know, and they practically gave me the city and asked me if I'd like another to take home in my pocket. Never saw anything like it. I might have been the missing heir. I think America's the greatest invention on record.\"  \"And what brought you to America?\" said Mrs. Hignett, unmoved by this rhapsody.  \"Oh, I came over to play golf. In a tournament, you know.\"  \"Surely at your age,\" said Mrs. Hignett, disapprovingly, \"you could be better occupied. Do you spend your whole time playing golf?\"  \"Oh, no. I hunt a bit and shoot a bit and I swim a good lot, and I still play football occasionally.\"  \"I wonder your father does not insist on your doing some useful work.\"  \"He is beginning to harp on the subject rather. I suppose I shall take a stab at it sooner or later. Father says I ought to get married, too.\"  \"He is perfectly right.\"  \"I suppose old Eustace will be getting hitched up one of these days?\" said Sam.  Mrs. Hignett started violently.  \"Why do you say that?\"  \"Eh?\"  \"What makes you say that?\"  \"Oh, well, he's a romantic sort of fellow. Writes poetry and all that.\"  \"There is no likelihood at all of Eustace marrying. He is of a shy and retiring temperament and sees few women. He is almost a recluse.\"  Sam was aware of this and had frequently regretted it. He had always been fond of his cousin and in that half-amused and rather patronising way in which men of thews and sinews are fond of the weaker brethren who run more to pallor and intellect; and he had always felt that if Eustace had not had to retire to Windles to spend his life with a woman whom from his earliest years he had always considered the Empress of the Wash-outs much might have been made of him. Both at school and at Oxford, Eustace had been--if not a sport--at least a decidedly cheery old bean. Sam remembered Eustace at school breaking gas globes with a slipper in a positively rollicking manner. He remembered him at Oxford playing up to him manfully at the piano on the occasion when he had done that imitation of Frank Tinney which had been such a hit at the Trinity smoker. Yes, Eustace had had the makings of a pretty sound egg, and it was too bad that he had allowed his mother to coop him up down in the country miles away from anywhere.  \"Eustace is returning to England on Saturday,\" said Mrs. Hignett. She spoke a little wistfully. She had not been parted from her son since he had come down from Oxford; and she would have liked to keep him with her till the end of her lecturing tour. That, however, was out of the question. It was imperative that, while she was away, he should be at Windles. Nothing would have induced her to leave the place at the mercy of servants who might trample over the flower-beds, scratch the polished floors, and forget to cover up the canary at night. \"He sails "]]]
