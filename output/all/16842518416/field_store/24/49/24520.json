You'll not think ill of them, because they're serfs, And sit not free upon the soil, like us. They love the land, and bear a good repute.  STAUFFACHER (to them). Give me your hands. He has good cause for thanks, That unto no man owes his body's service. But worth is worth, no matter where 'tis found.  HUNN. That is Herr Reding, sir, our old Landamman.  MEYER. I know him well. There is a suit between us, About a piece of ancient heritage. Herr Reding, we are enemies in court, Here we are one.     [Shakes his hand.  STAUFFACHER.          That's well and bravely said.  WINKELRIED. Listen! They come. Hark to the horn of Uri!     [On the right and left armed men are seen descending    the rocks with torches.  MAUER. Look, is not that God's pious servant there? A worthy priest! The terrors of the night, And the way's pains and perils scare not him, A faithful shepherd caring for his flock.  BAUMGARTEN. The Sacrist follows him, and Walter Fuerst. But where is Tell? I do not see him there.     [WALTER FURST, ROSSELMANN the Pastor, PETERMANN the Sacrist,    KUONI the Shepherd, WERNI the huntsman, RUODI the Fisherman,    and five other countrymen, thirty-three in all, advance and    take their places round the fire.  FURST. Thus must we, on the soil our fathers left us, Creep forth by stealth to meet like murderers, And in the night, that should their mantle lend Only to crime and black conspiracy, Assert our own good rights, which yet are clear As is the radiance of the noonday sun.  MELCHTHAL. So be it. What is woven in gloom of night Shall free and boldly meet the morning light.  ROSSELMANN. Confederates! listen to the words which God Inspires my heart withal. Here we are met To represent the general weal. In us Are all the people of the land convened. Then let us hold the Diet, as of old, And as we're wont in peaceful times to do. The time's necessity be our excuse If there be aught informal in this meeting. Still, wheresoe'er men strike for justice, there Is God, and now beneath his heaven we stand.  STAUFFACHER. 'Tis well advised. Let us, then, hold the Diet According to our ancient usages. Though it be night there's sunshine in our cause.  MELCHTHAL. Few though our numbers be, the hearts are here Of the whole people; here the best are met.  HUNN. The ancient books may not be near at hand, Yet are they graven in our inmost hearts.  ROSSELMANN. 'Tis well. And now, then, let a ring be formed, And plant the swords of power within the ground. [16]  MAUER. Let the Landamman step into his place, And by his side his secretaries stand.  SACRIST. There are three Cantons here. Which hath the right To give the head to the united council? Schwytz may contest the dignity with Uri, We Unterwaldeners enter not the field.  MELCHTHAL. We stand aside. We are not suppliants here, Invoking aid from our more potent friends.  STAUFFACHER. Let Uri have the sword. Her banner takes In battle the precedence of our own.  FURST. Schwytz, then, must share the honor of the sword; For she's the honored ancestor of all.  ROSSELMANN. Let me arrange this generous controversy. Uri shall lead in battle--Schwytz in council.  FURST (gives STAUFFACHER his hand). Then take your place.  STAUFFACHER.             Not I. Some older man.  HOFE. Ulrich, the smith, is the most aged here.  MAUER. A worthy man, but he is not a freeman; No bondman can be judge in Switzerland.  STAUFFACHER. Is not Herr Reding here, our old Landamman? Where can we find a worthier man than he?  FURST. Let him be Amman and the Diet's chief? You that agree with me hold up your hands!     [All hold up their right hands.  REDING (stepping into the centre). I cannot lay my hands upon the books; But by yon everlasting stars I swear Never to swerve from justice and the right.     [The two swords are placed before him, and a circle formed;    Schwytz in the centre, Uri on his right, Unterwald on his left.  REDING (resting on his battle-sword). Why, at the hour when spirits walk the earth, Meet the three Cantons of the mountains here, Upon the lake's inhospitable shore? And what the purport of the new alliance We here contract beneath the starry heaven?  STAUFFACHER (entering the circle). No new alliance do we now contract, But one our fathers framed, in ancient times, We purpose to renew! For know, confederates, Though mountain ridge and lake divide our bounds, And every Canton's ruled by its own laws, Yet are we but one race, born of one blood, And all are children of one common home.  WINKELRIED. Then is the burden of our legends true, That we came hither from a distant land? Oh, tell us what you know, that our new league May reap fresh vigor from the leagues of old.  STAUFFACHER. Hear, then, what aged herdsmen tell. There dwelt A mighty people in the land that lies Back to the north. The scourge of famine came; And in this strait 'twas publicly resolved, That each tenth man, on whom the lot might fall Should leave the country. They obeyed--and forth, With loud lamentings, men and women went, A mighty host; and to the south moved on, Cutting their way through Germany by the sword, Until they gained that pine-clad hills of ours; Nor stopped they ever on their forward course, Till at the shaggy dell they halted, where The Mueta flows through its luxuriant meads. No trace of human creature met their eye, Save one poor hut upon the desert shore, Where dwelt a lonely man, and kept the ferry. A tempest raged--the lake rose mountains high And barred their further progress. Thereupon They viewed the country; found it rich in wood, Discovered goodly springs, and felt as they Were in their own dear native land once more. Then they resolved to settle on the spot; Erected there the ancient town of Schwytz; And many a day of toil had they to clear The tangled brake and forest's spreading roots. Meanwhile their numbers grew, the soil became Unequal to sustain them, and they crossed To the black mountain, far as Weissland, where, Concealed behind eternal walls of ice, Another people speak another tongue. They built the village Stanz, beside the Kernwald The village Altdorf, in the vale of Reuss; Yet, ever mindful of their parent stem, The men of Schwytz, from all the stranger race, That since that time have settled in the land, Each other recognize. Their hearts still know, And beat fraternally to kindred blood.     [Extends his hand right and left.  MAUER. Ay, we are all one heart, one blood, one race!  ALL (joining hands). We are one people, and will act as one.  STAUFFACHER. The nations round us bear a foreign yoke; For they have yielded to the conqueror. Nay, even within our frontiers may be found Some that owe villein service to a lord, A race of bonded serfs from sire to son. But we, the genuine race of ancient Swiss, Have kept our freedom from the first till now, Never to princes have we bowed the knee; Freely we sought protection of the empire.  ROSSELMANN. Freely we sought it--freely it was given. 'Tis so set down in Emperor Frederick's charter.  STAUFFACHER. For the most free have still some feudal lord. There must be still a chief, a judge supreme, To whom appeal may lie in case of strife. And therefore was it that our sires allowed For what they had recovered from the waste, This honor to the emperor, the lord Of all the German and Italian soil; And, like the other freemen of his realm, Engaged to aid him with their swords in war; And this alone should be the freeman's duty, To guard the empire that keeps guard for him.  MELCHTHAL. He's but a slave that would acknowledge more.  STAUFFACHER. They followed, when the Heribann [17] went forth, The imperial standard, and they fought its battles! To Italy they marched in arms, to place The Caesars' crown upon the emperor's head. But still at home they ruled themselves in peace, By their own laws and ancient usages. The emperor's only right was to adjudge The penalty of death; he therefore named Some mighty noble as his delegate, That had no stake or interest in the land. He was called in, when doom was to be passed, And, in the face of day, pronounced decree, Clear and distinctly, fearing no man's hate. What traces here, that we are bondsmen? Speak, If there be any can gainsay my words!  HOFE. No! You have spoken but the simple truth; We never stooped beneath a tyrant's yoke.  STAUFFACHER. Even to the emperor we refused obedience, When he gave judgment in the church's favor; For when the Abbey of Einsiedlen claimed The Alp our fathers and ourselves had grazed, And showed an ancient charter, which bestowed The land on them as being ownerless-- For our existence there had been concealed-- What was our answer? This: \"The grant is void, No emperor can bestow what is our own: And if the empire shall deny us justice, We can, within our mountains, right ourselves!\" Thus spake our fathers! And shall we endure The shame and infamy of this new yoke, And from the vassal brook what never king Dared in the fulness of his power attempt? This soil we have created for ourselves, By the hard labor of our hands; we've changed The giant forest, that was erst the haunt Of savage bears, into a home for man; Extirpated the dragon's brood, that wont To rise, distent with venom, from the swamps; Rent the thick misty canopy that hung Its blighting vapors on the dreary waste; Blasted the solid rock; o'er the abyss Thrown the firm bridge for the wayfaring man By the possession of a thousand years The soil is ours. And shall an alien lord, Himself a vassal, dare to venture here, On our own hearths insult us,--and attempt To forge the chains of bondage for our hands, And do us shame on our own proper soil? Is there no help against such wrong as this?     [Great sensation among the people.  Yes! there's a limit to the despot's power! When the oppressed looks round in vain for justice, When his sore burden may no more be borne, With fearless heart he makes appeal to Heaven, And thence brings down his everlasting rights, Which there abide, inalienably his, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6788"],["title","Wilhelm Tell (#7)"],["body","indestructible as are the stars. Nature's primeval state returns again, Where man stands hostile to his fellow-man; And if all other means shall fail his need, One last resource remains--his own good sword. Our dearest treasures call to us for aid Against the oppressor's violence; we stand For country, home, for wives, for children here!  ALL (clashing their swords). Here stand we for our homes, our wives, and children.  ROSSELMANN (stepping into the circle). Bethink ye well before ye draw the sword. Some peaceful compromise may yet be made; Speak but one word, and at your feet you'll see The men who now oppress you. Take the terms That have been often tendered you; renounce The empire, and to Austria swear allegiance!  MAUER. What says the priest? To Austria allegiance?  BUHEL. Hearken not to him!  WINKELRLED.            'Tis a traitor's counsel, His country's foe!  REDING.           Peace, peace, confederates!  SEWA. Homage to Austria, after wrongs like these!  FLUE. Shall Austria exert from us by force What we denied to kindness and entreaty?  MEYER. Then should we all be slaves, deservedly.  MAUER. Yes! Let him forfeit all a Switzer's rights Who talks of yielding to the yoke of Austria! I stand on this, Landamman. Let this be The foremost of our laws!  MELCHTHAL.               Even so! Whoever Shall talk of tamely bearing Austria's yoke, Let him be stripped of all his rights and honors; And no man hence receive him at his hearth!  ALL (raising their right hands). Agreed! Be this the law!  REDING (after a pause).               The law it is.  ROSSELMANN. Now you are free--by this law you are free. Never shall Austria obtain by force What she has failed to gain by friendly suit.  WEILER. On with the order of the day! Proceed!  REDING. Confederates! Have all gentler means been tried? Perchance the emperor knows not of our wrongs, It may not be his will that thus we suffer: Were it not well to make one last attempt, And lay our grievances before the throne, Ere we unsheath the sword? Force is at best A fearful thing even in a righteous cause; God only helps when man can help no more.  STAUFFACHER (to CONRAD HUNN). Here you can give us information. Speak!  HUNN. I was at Rheinfeld, at the emperor's palace, Deputed by the Cantons to complain Of the oppression of these governors, And claim the charter of our ancient freedom, Which each new king till now has ratified. I found the envoys there of many a town, From Suabia and the valley of the Rhine, Who all received their parchments as they wished And straight went home again with merry heart. They sent for me, your envoy, to the council, Where I was soon dismissed with empty comfort; \"The emperor at present was engaged; Some other time he would attend to us!\" I turned away, and passing through the hall, With heavy heart in a recess I saw The Grand Duke John [18] in tears, and by his side The noble lords of Wart and Tegerfeld, Who beckoned me, and said, \"Redress yourselves. Expect not justice from the emperor. Does he not plunder his own brother's child, And keep from him his just inheritance?\" The duke claims his maternal property, Urging he's now of age, and 'tis full time That he should rule his people and dominions; What is the answer made to him? The king Places a chaplet on his head: \"Behold, The fitting ornament,\" he cries, \"of youth!\"  MAUER. You hear. Expect not from the emperor Or right, or justice. Then redress yourselves!  REDING. No other course is left us. Now, advise What plan most likely to insure success.  FURST. To shake a thraldom off that we abhor, To keep our ancient rights inviolate, As we received them from our forefathers--this, Not lawless innovation, is our aim. Let Caesar still retain what is his due; And he that is a vassal let him pay The service he is sworn to faithfully.  MEYER. I hold my land of Austria in fief.  FURST. Continue, then, to pay your feudal service.  WEILER. I'm tenant of the lords of Rappersweil.  FURST. Continue, then, to pay them rent and tithe.  ROSSELMANN. Of Zurich's lady, I'm the humble vassal.  FURST. Give to the cloister what the cloister claims.  STAUFFACHER. The empire only is my feudal lord.  FURST. What needs must be, we'll do, but nothing further. We'll drive these tyrants and their minions hence, And raze their towering strongholds to the ground, Yet shed, if possible, no drop of blood. Let the emperor see that we were driven to cast The sacred duties of respect away; And when he finds we keep within our bounds, His wrath, belike, may yield to policy; For truly is that nation to be feared, That, when in arms, is temperate in its wrath.  REDING. But, prithee, tell us how may this be done? The enemy is armed as well as we, And, rest assured, he will not yield in peace.  STAUFFACHER. He will, whene'er he sees us up in arms; We shall surprise him, ere he is prepared.  MEYER. 'Tis easily said, but not so easily done. Two fortresses of strength command the country. They shield the foe, and should the king invade us, The task would then be dangerous indeed. Rossberg and Sarnen both must be secured, Before a sword is drawn in either Canton.  STAUFFACHER. Should we delay, the foe will soon be warned; We are too numerous for secrecy.  MEYER. There is no traitor in the Forest States.  ROSSELMANN. But even zeal may heedlessly betray.  FURST. Delay it longer, and the keep at Altdorf Will be complete,--the governor secure.  MEYER. You think but of yourselves.  SACRISTAN.                 You are unjust!  MEYER. Unjust! said you? Dares Uri taunt us so?  REDING. Peace, on your oath!  MEYER.            If Schwytz be leagued with Uri, Why then, indeed, we must perforce be silent.  REDING. And let me tell you, in the Diet's name, Your hasty spirit much disturbs the peace. Stand we not all for the same common cause?  WINKELRIED. What, if we delay till Christmas? 'Tis then The custom for the serfs to throng the castle, Bringing the governor their annual gifts. Thus may some ten or twelve selected men Assemble unobserved within its walls, Bearing about their persons pikes of steel, Which may be quickly mounted upon staves, For arms are not admitted to the fort. The rest can fill the neighboring wood, prepared To sally forth upon a trumpet's blast, Whene'er their comrades have secured the gate; And thus the castle will be ours with ease.  MELCHTHAL. The Rossberg I will undertake to scale, I have a sweetheart in the garrison, Whom with some tender words I could persuade To lower me at night a hempen ladder. Once up, my friends will not be long behind.  REDING. Are all resolved in favor of delay?     [The majority raise their hands.  STAUFFACHER (counting them). Twenty to twelve is the majority.  FURST. If on the appointed day the castles fall, From mountain on to mountain we shall pass The fiery signal: in the capital Of every Canton quickly rouse the Landsturm. [19] Then, when these tyrants see our martial front, Believe me, they will never make so bold As risk the conflict, but will gladly take Safe conduct forth beyond our boundaries.  STAUFFACHER. Not so with Gessler. He will make a stand. Surrounded with his dread array of horse, Blood will he shed before he quits the field. And even expelled he'd still be terrible. 'Tis hard, indeed 'tis dangerous, to spare him.  BAUMGARTEN. Place me where'er a life is to be lost; I owe my life to Tell, and cheerfully Will pledge it for my country. I have cleared My honor, and my heart is now at rest.  REDING. Counsel will come with circumstance. Be patient. Something must still be trusted to the moment. Yet, while by night we hold our Diet here, The morning, see, has on the mountain-tops Kindled her glowing beacon. Let us part, Ere the broad sun surprise us.  FURST.                 Do not fear. The night wanes slowly from these vales of ours.     [All have involuntarily taken off their caps, and    contemplate the breaking of day, absorbed in silence.  ROSSELMANN. By this fair light, which greeteth us, before Those other nations, that, beneath us far, In noisome cities pent, draw painful breath, Swear we the oath of our confederacy! We swear to be a nation of true brothers, Never to part in danger or in death!     [They repeat his words with three fingers raised.  We swear we will be free, as were our sires, And sooner die than live in slavery!     [All repeat as before.  We swear to put our trust in God Most High, And not to quail before the might of man!     [All repeat as before, and embrace each other.  STAUFFACHER. Now every man pursue his several way Back to his friends his kindred, and his home. Let the herd winter up his flock and gain In silence, friends, for our confederacy! What for a time must be endured, endure. And let the reckoning of the tyrants grow, Till the great day arrive, when they shall pay The general and particular debt at once. Let every man control his own just rage, And nurse his vengeance for the public wrongs; For he whom selfish interest now engage Defrauds the general weal of what to it belongs.     [As they are going off in profound silence, in three different    directions, the orchestra plays a solemn air. The empty scene    remains open for some time, showing the rays of the sun rising    over the glaciers.     ACT III.  SCENE I.     Court before TELL'S house. TELL with an axe. HEDWIG engaged    in her domestic duties. WALTER and WILHELM in the background    playing with a little cross-bow.  WALTER (sings).     With his cross-bow and his quiver     The huntsman speeds his way,    Over mountain, dale, and river     At the dawning of the day.     As the eagle, on wild pinion,     Is the king in realms of air;    So the hunter claims dominion     Over crag and forest lair.     Far as ever bow can carry     Through the trackless, airy space,    All he sees he makes his quarry,     Soaring bird and beast of chase.  WILHELM (runs forward). My string has snapped!
