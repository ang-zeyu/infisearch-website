I ordered several other things at the same time, but they have nothing whatever to do with this story, because they were all--every single bottle of them-- consumed at the meeting; but of the cigars, about which the strange facts of my story cluster, at the close of the meeting a goodly two dozen remained. This is surprising, considering that there were quite six of us present, but it is true. Twenty-four by actual count remained when the last guest left me. The next morning I and my family took our departure for a month's rest in the mountains. In the hurry of leaving home, and the worry of looking after three children and four times as many trunks, I neglected to include the cigars in my impedimenta, leaving them in the opened box upon my library table. It was careless of me, no doubt, but it was an important incident, as the sequel shows. The incidents of the stay in the hills were commonplace, but during my absence from home strange things were going on there, as I learned upon my return.  The place had been left in charge of Barney O'Rourke, who, upon my arrival, assured me that everything was all right, and I thanked and paid him.  \"Wait a minute, Barney,\" I said, as he turned to leave me; \"I've got a cigar for you.\" I may mention incidentally that in the past I had kept Barney on very good terms with his work by treating him in a friendly, sociable way, but, to my great surprise, upon this occasion he declined advances.  His face flushed very red as he observed that he had given up smoking.  \"Well, wait a minute, anyhow,\" said I. \"There are one or two things I want to speak to you about.\" And I went to the table to get a cigar for myself.  _The box was empty!_  Instantly the suspicion which has doubtless flashed through the mind of the reader flashed through my own--Barney had been tempted, and had fallen. I recalled his blush, and on the moment realized that in all my vast experience with hired men in the past I had never seen one blush before. The case was clear. My cigars had gone to help Barney through the hot summer.  \"Well, I declare!\" I cried, turning suddenly upon him. \"I left a lot of cigars here when I went away, Barney.\"  \"I know ye did, sorr,\" said Barney, who had now grown white and rigid. \"I saw them meself, sorr. There was twinty-foor of 'em.\"  \"You counted them, eh?\" I asked, with an elevation of my eyebrows which to those who know me conveys the idea of suspicion.  \"I did, sorr. In your absence I was responsible for everyt'ing here, and the mornin' ye wint awaa I took a quick invintery, sorr, of the removables,\" he answered, fingering his cap nervously. \"That's how it was, sorr, and thim twinty-foor segyars was lyin' there in the box forninst me eyes.\"  \"And how do you account for the removal of these removables, as you call them, Barney?\" I asked, looking coldly at him. He saw he was under suspicion, and he winced, but pulled himself together in an instant.  \"I expected the question, sorr,\" he said, calmly, \"and I have me answer ready. Thim segyars was shmoked, sorr.\"  \"Doubtless,\" said I, with an ill-suppressed sneer. \"And by whom? Cats?\" I added, with a contemptuous shrug of my shoulders.  His answer overpowered me, it was so simple, direct, and unexpected.  \"Shpooks,\" he replied, laconically.  I gasped in astonishment, and sat down. My knees simply collapsed under me, and I could no more have continued to stand up than fly.  \"What?\" I cried, as soon as I had recovered sufficiently to gasp out the word.  \"Shpooks,\" replied Barney. \"Ut came about like this, sorr. It was the Froiday two wakes afther you left, I became un'asy loike along about nine o'clock in the avenin', and I fought I'd come around here and see if everything was sthraight. Me wife sez ut's foolish of me, sorr, and I sez maybe so, but I can't get ut out o' me head thot somet'ing's wrong.  \"'Ye locked everything up safe whin ye left?' sez she.  \"'I always does,' sez I.  \"'Thin ut's a phwhim,' sez she.  \"'No,' sez I. 'Ut's a sinsation. If ut was a phwim, ut'd be youse as would hov' it'; that's what I sez, sevarely loike, sorr, and out I shtarts. It was tin o'clock whin I got here. The noight was dark and blow-in' loike March, rainin' and t'underin' till ye couldn't hear yourself t'ink.  \"I walked down the walk, sorr, an' barrin' the t'under everyt'ing was quiet. I troid the dures. All toight as a politician. Shtill, t'inks I, I'll go insoide. Quiet as a lamb ut was, sorr; but on a suddent, as I was about to go back home again, I shmelt shmoke!\"  \"Fire?\" I cried, excitedly.  \"I said shmoke, sorr,\" said Barney, whose calmness was now beautiful to look upon, he was so serenely confident of his position.  \"Doesn't smoke involve a fire?\" I demanded.  \"Sometimes,\" said Barney. \"I t'ought ye meant a conflagrashun, sorr. The shmoke I shmelt was segyars.\"  \"Ah,\" I observed. \"I am glad you are coming to the point. Go on. There _is_ a difference.\"  \"There is thot,\" said Barney, pleasantly, he was getting along so swimmingly. \"This shmoke, as I say, was segyar shmoke, so I gropes me way cautious loike up the back sthairs and listens by the library dure. All quiet as a lamb. Thin, bold loike, I shteps into the room, and nearly drops wid the shcare I have on me in a minute. The room was dark as a b'aver hat, sorr, but in different shpots ranged round in the chairs was six little red balls of foire!\"  \"Barney!\" I cried.  \"Thrue, sorr,\" said he. \"And tobacky shmoke rollin' out till you'd 'a' t'ought there was a foire in a segyar-store! Ut queered me, sorr, for a minute, and me impulse is to run; but I gets me courage up, springs across the room, touches the electhric button, an' bzt! every gas-jet on the flure loights up!\"  \"That was rash, Barney,\" I put in, sarcastically.  \"It was in your intherest, sorr,\" said he, impressively.  \"And you saw what?\" I queried, growing very impatient.  \"What I hope niver to see again, sorr,\" said Barney, compressing his lips solemnly. \"_Six impty chairs,_ sorr, wid six segyars as hoigh up from the flure as a man's mout', puffin' and a-blowin' out shmoke loike a chimbley! An' ivery oncet in a whoile the segyars would go down kind of an' be tapped loike as if wid a finger of a shmoker, and the ashes would fall off onto the flure!\"  \"Well?\" said I. \"Go on. What next?\"  \"I wanted to run awaa, sorr, but I shtood rutted to the shpot wid th' surproise I had on me, until foinally ivery segyar was burnt to a shtub and trun into the foireplace, where I found 'em the nixt mornin' when I came to clane up, provin' ut wasn't ony dhrame I'd been havin'.\"  I arose from my chair and paced the room for two or three minutes, wondering what I could say. Of course the man was lying, I thought. Then I pulled myself together.  \"Barney,\" I said, severely, \"what's the use? Do you expect me to believe any such cock-and-bull story as that?\"  \"No, sorr,\" said he. \"But thim's the facts.\"  \"Do you mean to say that this house of mine is haunted?\" I cried.  [Illustration: \"'SIX IMPTY CHAIRS, SORR'\"]  \"I don't know,\" said Barney, quietly. \"I didn't t'ink so before.\"  \"Before? Before what? When?\" I asked.  \"Whin you was writin' shtories about ut, sorr,\" said Barney, respectfully. \"You've had a black horse-hair sofy turn white in a single noight, sorr, for the soight of horror ut's witnessed. You've had the hair of your own head shtand on ind loike tinpenny nails at what you've seen here in this very room, yourself, sorr. You've had ghosts doin' all sorts of t'ings in the shtories you've been writin' for years, and _you've always swore they was thrue, sorr_. I didn't believe 'em when I read 'em, but whin I see thim segyars bein' shmoked up before me eyes by invishible t'ings, I sez to meself, sez I, the boss ain't such a dommed loiar afther all. I've follyd your writin', sorr, very careful and close loike; an I don't see how, afther the tales you've told about your own experiences right here, you can say consishtently that this wan o' mine ain't so!\"  \"But why, Barney,\" I asked, to confuse him, \"when a thing like this happened, didn't you write and tell me?\"  Barney chuckled as only one of his species can chuckle.  \"Wroite an' tell ye?\" he cried. \"Be gorry, sorr, if I could wroite at all at all, ut's not you oi'd be wroitin' that tale to, but to the edithor of the paper that you wroite for. A tale loike that is wort' tin dollars to any man, eshpecially if ut's thrue. But I niver learned the art!\"  And with that Barney left me overwhelmed. Subsequently I gave him the ten dollars which I think his story is worth, but I must confess that I am in a dilemma. After what I have said about my supernatural guests, I cannot discharge Barney for lying, but I'll be blest if I can quite believe that his story is accurate in every respect.  If there should happen to be among the readers of this tale any who have made a sufficiently close study of the habits of hired men and ghosts to be able to shed any light upon the situation, nothing would please me more than to hear from them.  I may add, in closing, that Barney has resumed smoking.     THE EXORCISM THAT FAILED  I--A JUBILEE EXPERIENCE   It has happened again. I have been haunted once more, and this time by the most obnoxious spook I have ever had the bliss of meeting. He is homely, squat, and excessively vulgar in his dress and manner. I have met cockneys in my day, and some of the most offensive varieties at that, but this spook absolutely outcocknifies them all, and the worst of it is I can't seem to rid myself of him. He has pursued me like an avenging angel for quite six months, and every plan of exorcism that I have tried so far has failed, including the receipt given me by my friend Peters, who, next to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6995"],["title","Ghosts I Have Met and Some Others (#6)"],["body","self, knows more about ghosts that any man living. It was in London that I first encountered the vulgar little creature who has made my life a sore trial ever since, and with whom I am still coping to the best of my powers.  Starting out early in the morning of June 21, last summer, to witness the pageant of her Majesty Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, I secured a good place on the corner of Northumberland Avenue and Trafalgar Square. There were two rows of people ahead of me, but I did not mind that. Those directly before me were short, and I could easily see over their heads, and, furthermore, I was protected from the police, who in London are the most dangerous people I have ever encountered, not having the genial ways of the Irish bobbies who keep the New York crowds smiling; who, when you are pushed into the line of march, merely punch you in a ticklish spot with the end of their clubs, instead of smashing your hair down into your larynx with their sticks, as do their London prototypes.  It was very comforting to me, having witnessed the pageant of 1887, when the Queen celebrated her fiftieth anniversary as a potentate, and thereby learned the English police system of dealing with crowds, to know that there were at least two rows of heads to be split open before my turn came, and I had formed the good resolution to depart as soon as the first row had been thus treated, whether I missed seeing the procession or not.  I had not been long at my post when the crowds concentrating on the line of march, coming up the avenue from the Embankment, began to shove intolerably from the rear, and it was as much as I could do to keep my place, particularly in view of the fact that the undersized cockney who stood in front of me appeared to offer no resistance to the pressure of my waistcoat against his narrow little back. It seemed strange that it should be so, but I appeared, despite his presence, to have nothing of a material nature ahead of me, and I found myself bent at an angle of seventy-five degrees, my feet firmly planted before me like those of a balky horse, restraining the onward tendency of the mob back of me.  Strong as I am, however, and stubborn, I am not a stone wall ten feet thick at the base, and the pressure brought to bear upon my poor self was soon too great for my strength, and I gradually encroached upon my unresisting friend. He turned and hurled a few remarks at me that are not printable, yet he was of no more assistance in withstanding the pressure than a marrowfat pea well cooked would have been.  \"I'm sorry,\" I said, apologetically, \"but I can't help it. If these policemen would run around to the rear and massacre some of the populace who are pushing me, I shouldn't have to shove you.\"  \"Well, all I've got to say,\" he retorted, \"is that if you don't keep your carcass out of my ribs I'll haunt you to your dying day.\"  \"If you'd only put up a little backbone yourself you'd make it easier for me,\" I replied, quite hotly. \"What are you, anyhow, a jelly-fish or an India-rubber man?\" He hadn't time to answer, for just as I spoke an irresistible shove from the crowd pushed me slap up against the man in the front row, and I was appalled to find the little fellow between us bulging out on both sides of me, crushed longitudinally from top to toe, so that he resembled a paper doll before the crease is removed from its middle, three-quarters open. \"Great heavens!\" I muttered. \"What have I struck?\"  [Illustration: \"'L LUL LET ME OUT!' HE GASPED \"]  \"L-lul-let me out!\" he gasped. \"Don't you see you are squ-queezing my figure out of shape? Get bub-back, blank it!\"  \"I can't,\" I panted. \"I'm sorry, but--\"  \"Sorry be hanged!\" he roared. \"This is my place, you idiot--\"  This was too much for me, and in my inability to kick him with my foot I did it with my knee, and then, if I had not been excited, I should have learned the unhappy truth. My knee went straight through him and shoved the man ahead into the coat-tails of the bobbie in front. It was fortunate for me that it happened as it did, for the front-row man was wrathful enough to have struck me; but the police took care of him; and as he was carried away on a stretcher, the little jelly-fish came back into his normal proportions, like an inflated India-rubber toy.  \"What the deuce are you, anyhow?\" I cried, aghast at the spectacle.  \"You'll find out before you are a year older!\" he wrathfully answered. \"I'll show you a shoving trick or two that you won't like, you blooming Yank!\"  It made me excessively angry to be called a blooming Yank. I am a Yankee, and I have been known to bloom, but I can't stand having a low-class Britisher apply that term to me as if it were an opprobrious thing to be, so I tried once more to kick him with my knee. Again my knee passed through him, and this time took the policeman himself in the vicinity of his pistol-pocket. The irate officer turned quickly, raised his club, and struck viciously, not at the little creature, but at me. He didn't seem to see the jelly -fish. And then the horrid truth flashed across my mind. The thing in front of me was a ghost--a miserable relic of some bygone pageant, and visible only to myself, who have an eye to that sort of thing. Luckily the bobbie missed his stroke, and as I apologized, telling him I had St. Vitus's dance and could not control my unhappy leg, accompanying the apology with a half sovereign--both of which were accepted--peace reigned, and I shortly had the bliss of seeing the whole sovereign ride by--that is, I was told that the lady behind the parasol, which obscured everything but her elbow, was her Majesty the Queen.  Nothing more of interest happened between this and the end of the procession, although the little spook in front occasionally turned and paid me a compliment which would have cost any material creature his life. But that night something of importance did happen, and it has been going on ever since. The unlovely creature turned up in my lodgings just as I was about to retire, and talked in his rasping voice until long after four o'clock. I ordered him out, and he declined to go. I struck at him, but it was like hitting smoke.  \"All right,\" said I, putting on my clothes. \"If you won't get out, I will.\"  \"That's exactly what I intended you to do,\" he said. \"How do you like being shoved, eh? Yesterday was the 21st of June. I shall keep shoving you along, even as you shoved me, for exactly one year.\"  \"Humph!\" I retorted. \"You called me a blooming Yank yesterday. I am. I shall soon be out of your reach in the great and glorious United States.\"  \"Oh, as for that,\" he answered, calmly, \"I can go to the United States. There are steamers in great plenty. I could even get myself blown across on a gale, if I wanted to--only gales are not always convenient. Some of 'em don't go all the way through, and connections are hard to make. A gale I was riding on once stopped in mid-ocean, and I had to wait a week before another came along, and it landed me in Africa instead of at New York.\"  \"Got aboard the wrong gale, eh?\" said I, with a laugh.  \"Yes,\" he answered.  \"Didn't you drown?\" I cried, somewhat interested.  \"Idiot!\" he retorted. \"Drown? How could I? You can't drown a ghost!\"  \"See here,\" said I, \"if you call me an idiot again, I'll--I'll--\"  \"What?\" he put in, with a grin. \"Now just what will you do? You're clever, but _I'm a ghost!\"_  [Illustration: \"I SHALL KEEP SHOVING YOU FOR EXACTLY ONE YEAR\"]  \"You wait and see!\" said I, rushing angrily from the room. It was a very weak retort, and I frankly admit that I am ashamed of it, but it was the best I had at hand at the moment. My stock of repartee, like most men's vitality, is at its lowest ebb at four o'clock in the morning.  For three or four hours I wandered aimlessly about the city, and then returned to my room, and found it deserted; but in the course of my peregrinations I had acquired a most consuming appetite. Usually I eat very little breakfast, but this morning nothing short of a sixteen-course dinner could satisfy my ravening; so instead of eating my modest boiled egg, I sought the Savoy, and at nine o'clock entered the breakfast-room of that highly favored caravansary. Imagine my delight, upon entering, to see, sitting near one of the windows, my newly made acquaintances of the steamer, the Travises of Boston, Miss Travis looking more beautiful than ever and quite as haughty, by whom I was invited to join them. I accepted with alacrity, and was just about to partake of a particularly nice melon when who should walk in but that vulgar little spectre, hat jauntily placed on one side of his head, check-patterned trousers loud enough to wake the dead, and a green plaid vest about his middle that would be an indictable offence even on an American golf links.  \"Thank Heaven they can't see the brute!\" I muttered as he approached.  \"Hullo, old chappie!\" he cried, slapping me on my back. \"Introduce me to your charming friends,\" and with this he gave a horrible low -born smirk at Miss Travis, to whom, to my infinite sorrow, by some accursed miracle, he appeared as plainly visible as he was to me.  \"Really,\" said Mrs. Travis, turning coldly to me, \"we--we can't, you know--we--Come, Eleanor. We will leave this _gentleman_ with his _friend_, and have our breakfast sent to our rooms.\"  And with that they rose up and scornfully departed. The creature then sat down in Miss Travis's chair and began to devour her roll.  \"See here,\" I cried, finally, \"what the devil do you mean?\"  \"Shove number two,\" he replied, with his unholy smirk. \"Very successful, eh? Werl, just you wait for number three. It will be what you Americans call a corker. By-bye.\"  And with that he vanished, just in time to spare me the humiliation of shying a pot of coffee at his head. Of course my appetite vanished with him, and my main duty now seemed to be to seek out the Travises and explain; so leaving the balance of my breakfast untasted, I sought the"]]]
