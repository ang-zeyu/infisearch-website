The very Party in power has proposed to guarantee Slavery forever in the States, if the South would but remain in the Union.\"  On the 4th of May preceding, Lord John had received these Commissioners at his house; and in a letter of May 11, 1861, wrote, from the Foreign Office, to Lord Lyons, the British Minister at Washington, a letter, in which, alluding to his informal communication with them, he said: \"One of these gentlemen, speaking for the others, dilated on the causes which had induced the Southern States to Secede from the Northern.  The principal of these causes, he said, was not Slavery, but the very high price which, for the sake of Protecting the Northern manufacturers, the South were obliged to pay for the manufactured goods which they required.  One of the first acts of the Southern Congress was to reduce these duties, and to prove their sincerity he gave as an instance that Louisiana had given up altogether that Protection on her sugar which she enjoyed by the legislation of the United States.  As a proof of the riches of the South.  He stated that of $350,000,000 of exports of produce to foreign countries $270,000,000 were furnished by the Southern States.\"  * * *  They pointed to the new Tariff of the United States as a proof that British manufactures would be nearly excluded from the North, and freely admitted in the South.   This may be as good a place as any other to say a few words touching another alleged \"cause\" of Secession.  During the exciting period just prior to the breaking out of the great War of the Rebellion, the Slave-holding and Secession-nursing States of the South, made a terrible hubbub over the Personal Liberty Bills of the Northern States.  And when Secession came, many people of the North supposed these Bills to be the prime, if not the only real cause of it.  Not so.  They constituted, as we now know, only a part of the mere pretext.  But, none the less, they constituted a portion of the history of that eventful time, and cannot be altogether ignored.  In order then, that the reader may quickly grasp, not only the general nature, but also the most important details of the Personal Liberty Bills (in force, in 1860, in many of the Free States) so frequently alluded to in the Debates of Congress, in speeches on the stump, and in the fulminations of Seceding States and their authorized agents, commissioners, and representatives, it may be well now, briefly to refer to them, and to state that no such laws existed in California, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, New York, Ohio and Oregon.  Those of Maine provided that no officer of the State should in any way assist in the arrest or detention of a Fugitive Slave, and made it the duty of county attorneys to defend the Fugitive Slave against the claim of his master.  A Bill to repeal these laws passed the Maine Senate, but failed in the House.  That of Massachusetts provided for commissioners in each county to defend alleged Fugitives from Service or Labor; for payment by the Commonwealth of all expenses of defense; prohibited the issue or service of process by State officers for arrest of alleged Fugitives, or the use of any prisons in the State for their detention, or that of any person aiding their escape; prohibited the kidnapping or removal of alleged Fugitive Slaves by any person; prohibited all officers within the State, down to Town officers, from arresting, imprisoning, detaining or returning to Service \"any Person for the reason that he is claimed or adjudged to be a Fugitive from Service or Labor\"--all such prohibitions being enforced by heavy fines and imprisonment.  The Act of March 25, 1861, materially modified and softened the above provisions.  New Hampshire's law, provided that all Slaves entering the State with consent of the master shall be Free, and made the attempt to hold any person as a Slave within the State a felony.  Vermont's, prescribed that no process under the Fugitive Slave Law should be recognized by any of her Courts, officers, or citizens; nor any aid given in arresting or removing from the State any Person claimed as a Fugitive Slave; provided counsel for alleged Fugitives; for the issue of habeas corpus and trial by jury of issues of fact between the parties; ordained Freedom to all within the State who may have been held as Slaves before coming into it, and prescribed heavy penalties for any attempt to return any such to Slavery.  A bill to repeal these laws, proposed November, 1860, in the Vermont House of Representatives, was beaten by two to one.  Connecticut's, provided that there must be two witnesses to prove that a Person is a Slave; that depositions are not evidence; that false testifying in Fugitive Slave cases shall be punishable by fine of $5,000 and five years in State prison.  In New Jersey, the only laws touching the subject, permitted persons temporarily sojourning in the State to bring and hold their Slaves, and made it the duty of all State officers to aid in the recovery of Fugitives from Service.  In Pennsylvania, barring an old dead-letter Statute, they simply prohibited any interference by any of the Courts, Aldermen, or Justices of the Peace, of the Commonwealth, with the functions of the Commissioner appointed under the United States Statute in Fugitive Slave cases.  In Michigan, the law required States' attorneys to defend Fugitive Slaves; prescribed the privileges of habeas corpus and jury trial for all such arrested; prohibited the use of prisons of the State for their detention; required evidence of two credible witnesses as to identity; and provided heavy penalties of fine and imprisonment for the seizure of any Free Person, with intent to have such Person held in Slavery.  A Bill to repeal the Michigan law was defeated in the House by about two to one.  Wisconsin's Personal Liberty law was similar to that of Michigan, but with this addition, that no judgment recovered against any person in that State for violating the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 should be enforced by sale or execution of any real or personal property in that State.  That of Rhode Island, forbade the carrying away of any Person by force out of the State; forbade the official aiding in the arrest or detention of a Fugitive Slave; and denied her jails to the United States for any such detention.  Apropos of this subject, and before leaving it, it may be well to quote remarks of Mr. Simons of Rhode Island, in the United States Senate. Said he: \"Complaint has been made of Personal Liberty Bills.  Now, the Massachusetts Personal Liberty Bill was passed by a Democratic House, a Democratic Senate, and signed by a Democratic Governor, a man who was afterwards nominated by Mr. Polk for the very best office in New England, and was unanimously confirmed by a Democratic United States Senate.  Further than this, the very first time the attention of the Massachusetts Legislature was called to the propriety of a repeal of this law was by a Republican Governor.  Now, on the other hand, South Carolina had repealed a law imprisoning British colored sailors, but retained the one imprisoning those coming from States inhabited by her own brethren!\"  These Personal Liberty Bills were undoubtedly largely responsible for some of the irritation on the Slavery question preceding open hostilities between the Sections.  But President Lincoln sounded the real depths of the Rebellion when he declared it to be a War upon the rights of the People.  In his First Annual Message, December 3, 1861, he said:  \"It continues to develop that the insurrection is largely, if not exclusively, a War upon the first principle of popular government--the rights of the People.  Conclusive evidence of this is found in the most grave and maturely considered public documents, as well as in the general tone of the insurgents.  In those documents we find the abridgment of the existing right of suffrage, and the denial to the People of all right to participate in the selection of public officers, except the legislative, boldly advocated, with labored arguments to prove that large control of the People in government is the source of all political evil.  Monarchy itself is sometimes hinted at as a possible refuge from the power of the People.  \"In my present position, I could scarcely be justified were I to omit raising a warning voice against this approach of returning despotism.  \"It is not needed, nor fitting here, that a general argument should be made in favor of popular institutions; but there is one point, with its connections, not so hackneyed as most others, to which I ask brief attention.  It is the effort to place Capital on an equal footing with, if not above Labor, in the structure of the Government.  \"It is assumed that Labor is available only in connection with Capital; that nobody labors unless somebody else, owning Capital, somehow by the use of it induces him to labor.  This assumed, it is next considered whether it is best that Capital shall hire laborers, and thus induce them to work by their own consent, or buy them, and drive them to it without their consent.  Having proceeded so far, it is naturally concluded that all laborers are either hired laborers, or what we call Slaves.  And further, it is assumed that whoever is once a hired laborer is fixed in that condition for life.  \"Now, there is no such relation between Capital and Labor as assumed; nor is there any such thing as a free man being fixed for life, in the condition of a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7135"],["title","The Great Conspiracy, Volume 3 (#5)"],["body"," laborer.  Both these assumptions are false, and all inferences from them are groundless.  \"Labor is prior to, and independent of Capital.  Capital is only the fruit of Labor, and could never have existed if Labor had not first existed.  Labor is the superior of Capital, and deserves much the higher consideration.  Capital has its rights, which are as worthy of protection as any other rights.  Nor is it denied that there is, and probably always will be, a relation between Labor and Capital, producing mutual benefits.  The error is in assuming that the whole Labor of the community exists within that relation.  \"A few men own Capital, and that few, avoid labor themselves, and with their Capital hire or buy another few to labor for them.  A large majority belong to neither class--neither work for others, nor have others working for them.  \"In most of the Southern States, a majority of the whole people of all colors are neither Slaves nor masters; while in the Northern, a large majority are neither hirers nor hired.  Men with their families--wives, sons, and daughters--work for themselves, on their farms, in their houses, and in their shops, taking the whole product to themselves, and asking no favors of Capital on the one hand, nor of hired laborers or Slaves on the other.  \"It is not forgotten that a considerable number of persons mingle their own Labor with Capital--that is they labor with their own hands, and also buy or hire others to labor for them; but this is only a mixed, and not a distinct class.  No principle stated is disturbed by the existence of this mixed class.  \"Again, as has already been said, there is not, of necessity, any such thing as the free hired-laborer being fixed to that condition for life. Many independent men everywhere in these States, a few years back in their lives, were hired laborers.  \"The prudent, penniless beginner in the World, labors for wages awhile, saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for himself, then labors on his own account another while, and at length hires another new beginner to help him.  This is the just and generous and prosperous system, which opens the way to all, gives hope to all, and consequent energy and progress, and improvement of condition to all.  \"No men living are more worthy to be trusted than those who toil up from poverty--none less inclined to take or touch aught which they have not honestly earned.  Let them beware of surrendering a political power which they already possess, and which, if surrendered, will surely be used to close the door of advancement against such as they, and to fix new disabilities and burdens upon them, till all of Liberty shall be lost.  * * *  The struggle of to-day is not altogether for to-day-it is a vast future also.  * * * \"   So too, Andrew Johnson, in his speech before the Senate, January 31, 1862, spake well and truly when he said that \"there has been a deliberate design for years to change the nature and character and genius of this Government.\"  And he added: \"Do we not know that these schemers have been deliberately at work, and that there is a Party in the South, with some associates in the North, and even in the West, that have become tired of Free Government, in which they have lost confidence.\"  Said he: \"They raise an outcry against 'Coercion,' that they may paralyze the Government, cripple the exercise of the great powers with which it was invested, finally to change its form and subject us to a Southern despotism.  Do we not know it to be so?  Why disguise this great truth?  Do we not know that they have been anxious for a change of Government for years?  Since this Rebellion commenced it has manifested itself in many quarters.  \"How long is it since the organ of the Government at Richmond, the Richmond Whig, declared that rather than live under the Government of the United States, they preferred to take the Constitutional Queen of Great Britain as their protector; that they would make an alliance with Great Britain for the purpose of preventing the enforcement of the Laws of the United States.  Do we not know this?\"   Stephen A. Douglas also, in his great Union speech at Chicago, May 1, 1861--only a few days before his lamented death-said:  \"The election of Mr. Lincoln is a mere pretext.  The present Secession movement is the result of an enormous Conspiracy formed more than a year since formed by leaders in the Southern Confederacy more than twelve months ago.  They use the Slavery question as a means to aid the accomplishment of their ends.  They desired the election of a Northern candidate by a Sectional vote, in order to show that the two Sections cannot live together.  \"When the history of the two years from the Lecompton question down to the Presidential election shall be written, it will be shown that the scheme was deliberately made to break up this Union.  \"They desired a Northern Republican to be elected by a purely Northern vote, and then assign this fact as a reason why the Sections cannot live together.  If the Disunion candidate--(Breckinridge) in the late Presidential contest had carried the united South, their scheme was, the Northern candidate successful, to seize the Capital last Spring, and by a united South and divided North, hold it.  \"Their scheme was defeated, in the defeat of the Disunion candidates in several of the Southern States.  \"But this is no time for a detail of causes.  The Conspiracy is now known; Armies have been raised.  War is levied to accomplish it.  There are only two sides to the question.  \"Every man must be for the United States, or against it.  There can be no Neutrals in this War; only Patriots or Traitors!  [Cheer after Cheer].\"   In a speech made in the United States Senate, January 31, 1862, Senator McDougall of California--conceded to be intellectually the peer of any man in that Body--said:  \"We are at War.  How long have we been at War?  We have been engaged in a war of opinion, according to my historical recollection, since 1838. There has been a Systematic organized war against the Institutions established by our fathers, since 1832.  This is known of all men who have read carefully the history of our Country.  If I had the leisure, or had consulted the authorities, I would give it year by year, and date by date, from that time until the present, how men adversary to our Republican Institutions have been organizing War against us, because they did not approve of our Republican Institutions.  \"Before the Mexican War, it is well known that General Quitman, then Governor of Mississippi, was organizing to produce the same condition of things (and he hoped a better condition of things, for he hoped a successful Secession), to produce this same revolution that is now disturbing our whole Land.  The War with Mexico, fighting for a Southern proposition, for which I fought myself, made the Nation a unit until 1849; and then again they undertook an Organization to produce Revolution.  These things are history.  This statement is true, and cannot be denied among intelligent men anywhere, and cannot be denied in this Senate.  \"The great men who sat in Council in this Hall, the great men of the Nation, men whose equals are not, and I fear will not be for many years, uniting their judgments, settled the controversy in 1850.  They did not settle it for the Conspirators of the South, for they were not parties to the compact.  Clay and Webster, and the great men who united with them, had no relation with the extremes of either extreme faction.  The Compromise was made, and immediately after it had been effected, again commenced the work of organization.  I had the honor to come from my State on the Pacific into the other branch of the Federal Congress, and there I learned as early as 1853, that the work of Treason was as industriously pursued as it is being pursued to-day.  I saw it; I felt it; I knew it.  I went home to the shores of the Pacific instructed somewhat on this subject.  \"Years passed by.  I engaged in my duties as a simple professional man, not connected with public affairs.  The question of the last Presidential election arose before the Country--one of those great questions that are not appreciated, I regret from my heart, by the American Nation, when we elect a President, a man who has more power for his time than any enthroned Monarch in Europe.  We organize a Government and place him in front as the head and the Chief of the Government. That question came before the American People.  \"At that time I was advised of this state of feeling--and I will state it in as exact form of words as I can state it, that it may be understood by Senators: Mr. Douglas is a man acceptable to the South. Mr. Douglas is a man to whom no one has just cause of exception throughout the South.  Mr. Douglas is more acceptable to Mississippi and Louisiana than Mr. Breckinridge.  Mr. Breckinridge is not acceptable to the South; or at least, if he is so, he is not in the same degree with Mr. Douglas.  Mr. Douglas is the accepted man of a great National Party, and if he is brought into the field he will be triumphantly elected. THAT MUST NOT BE DONE, because THE ORGANIZATION FOR SECESSION IS MATURED.  EVERYTHING IS PREPARED, and the election of Mr. Douglas would only postpone it for four years; and Now when we are PREPARED to carry out these things WE MUST INDULGE IN STRATAGEM, and the nomination of Mr. Breckinridge is a mere strategic movement to divide the great conservative Party of the Nation into two, so as to elect a Republican candidate AND CONSOLIDATE THE SOUTH BY THE CRY OF 'ABOLITIONIST!'  \"That is a mere simple statement of the truth, and it cannot be contradicted.  Now, in that scheme all the men of counsel of that Party were engaged.  * * *  I, on the far shores of the Pacific understood those things as long ago as a year last September (1860).  I was advised about this policy and well informed of it.  * * *  \"I was at war, in California, in January (186"]]]
