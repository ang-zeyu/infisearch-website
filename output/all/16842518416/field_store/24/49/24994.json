Its history is a history of surprises and treacheries and ruthless      spoliations.  The Forts of the United States have been captured and      garrisoned, and hostile flags unfurled upon their ramparts.  Its      arsenals have been seized, and the vast amount of public arms they      contained appropriated to the use of the captors; while more than      half a million dollars, found in the Mint at New Orleans, has been      unscrupulously applied to replenish the coffers of Louisiana.      Officers in command of revenue cutters of the United States have      been prevailed on to violate their trusts and surrender the      property in their charge; and instead of being branded for their      crimes, they, and the vessels they betrayed, have been cordially      received into the service of the Seceded States.  These movements      were attended by yet more discouraging indications of immorality.      It was generally believed that this Revolution was guided and urged      on by men occupying the highest positions in the public service,      and who, with the responsibilities of an oath to support the      Constitution still resting upon their consciences, did not hesitate      secretly to plan and openly to labor for, the dismemberment of the      Republic whose honors they enjoyed and upon whose Treasury they      were living.  As examples of evil are always more potent than those      of good, this spectacle of demoralization on the part of States and      statesmen could not fail to produce the most deplorable      consequences.  The discontented and the disloyal everywhere took      courage.  In other States, adjacent to and supposed to sympathize      in sense of political wrong with those referred to, Revolutionary      schemes were set on foot, and Forts and arms of the United States      seized.  The unchecked prevalence of the Revolution, and the      intoxication which its triumphs inspired, naturally suggested      wilder and yet more desperate enterprises than the conquest of      ungarrisoned Forts, or the plunder of an unguarded Mint.  At what      time the armed occupation of Washington City became a part of the      Revolutionary Programme, is not certainly known.  More than six      weeks ago, the impression had already extensively obtained that a      Conspiracy for the accomplishment of this guilty purpose was in      process of formation, if not fully matured.  The earnest endeavors      made by men known to be devoted to the Revolution, to hurry      Virginia and Maryland out of the Union, were regarded as      preparatory steps for the subjugation of Washington.  This plan was      in entire harmony with the aim and spirit of those seeking the      subversion of the Government, since no more fatal blow at its      existence could be struck than the permanent and hostile possession      of the seat of its power.  It was in harmony, too, with the avowed      designs of the Revolutionists, which looked to the formation of a      Confederacy of all the Slave States, and necessarily to the      Conquest of the Capital within their limits.  It seemed not very      indistinctly prefigured in a Proclamation made upon the floor of      the Senate, without qualification, if not exultingly, that the      Union was already dissolved--a Proclamation which, however      intended, was certainly calculated to invite, on the part of men of      desperate fortunes or of Revolutionary States, a raid upon the      Capital.  In view of the violence and turbulent disorders already      exhibited in the South, the public mind could not reject such a      scheme as at all improbable.  That a belief in its existence was      entertained by multitudes, there can be no doubt, and this belief I      fully shared.  My conviction rested not only on the facts already      alluded to, but upon information, some of which was of a most      conclusive character, that reached the Government from many parts      of the Country, not merely expressing the prevalence of the opinion      that such an organization had been formed, but also often      furnishing the plausible grounds on which the opinion was based.      Superadded to these proofs, were the oft-repeated declarations of      men in high political positions here, and who were known to have      intimate affiliations with the Revolution--if indeed they did not      hold its reins in their hands--to the effect that Mr. Lincoln would      not, or should not be inaugurated at Washington.  Such      declarations, from such men, could not be treated as empty bluster.      They were the solemn utterances of those who well understood the      import of their words, and who, in the exultation of the temporary      victories gained over their Country's flag in the South, felt      assured that events would soon give them the power to verify their      predictions.  Simultaneously with these prophetic warnings, a      Southern journal of large circulation and influence, and which is      published near the city of Washington, advocated its seizure as a      possible political necessity.       \"The nature and power of the testimony thus accumulated may be best      estimated by the effect produced upon the popular mind.      Apprehensions for the safety of the Capital were communicated from      points near and remote, by men unquestionably reliable and loyal.      The resident population became disquieted, and the repose of many      families in the city was known to be disturbed by painful      anxieties.  Members of Congress, too-men of calm and comprehensive      views, and of undoubted fidelity to their Country--frankly      expressed their solicitude to the President and to this Department,      and formally insisted that the defenses of the Capital should be      strengthened.  With such warnings, it could not be forgotten that,      had the late Secretary of War heeded the anonymous letter which he      received, the tragedy at Harper's Ferry would have been avoided;      nor could I fail to remember that, had the early admonitions which      reached here in regard to the designs of lawless men upon the Forts      of Charleston Harbor been acted on by sending forward adequate      reinforcements before the Revolution began, the disastrous      political complications that ensued might not have occurred.       \"Impressed by these circumstances and considerations, I earnestly      besought you to allow the concentration, at this city, of a      sufficient military force to preserve the public peace from all the      dangers that seemed to threaten it.  An open manifestation, on the      part of the Administration, of a determination, as well as of the      ability, to maintain the laws, would, I was convinced, prove the      surest, as also the most pacific, means of baffling and dissolving      any Conspiracy that might have been organized.  It was believed too      that the highest and most solemn responsibility resting upon a      President withdrawing from the Government, was to secure to his      successor a peaceful Inauguration.  So deeply, in my judgment, did      this duty concern the whole Country and the fair fame of our      Institutions, that, to guarantee its faithful discharge, I was      persuaded no preparation could be too determined or too complete.      The presence of the troops alluded to in the resolution is the      result of the conclusion arrived at by yourself and Cabinet, on the      proposition submitted to you by this Department.  Already this      display of life and loyalty on the part of your Administration, has      produced the happiest effects.  Public confidence has been      restored, and the feverish apprehension which it was so mortifying      to contemplate has been banished.  Whatever may have been the      machinations of deluded, lawless men, the execution of their      purpose has been suspended, if not altogether abandoned in view of      preparations which announce more impressively than words that this      Administration is alike able and resolved to transfer in peace, to      the President elect, the authority that, under the Constitution,      belongs to him.  To those, if such there be, who desire the      destruction of the Republic, the presence of these troops is      necessarily offensive; but those who sincerely love our      Institutions cannot fail to rejoice that, by this timely precaution      they have possibly escaped the deep dishonor which they must have      suffered had the Capital, like the Forts and Arsenals of the South,      fallen into the hands of the Revolutionists, who have found this      great Government weak only because, in the exhaustless beneficence      of its spirit, it has refused to strike, even in its own defense,      lest it should wound the aggressor.       \"I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,                                \"J. HOLT.                          \"Secretary of War,       \"THE PRESIDENT.\"]   On February 20th, Forts Chadbourne and Belknap were seized by the Texan Rebels; and on the 22nd, the Federal General Twiggs basely surrendered to them all the fortifications under his control, his little Army, and all the Government stores in his possession--comprising $55,000 in specie, 35,000 stand of arms, 26 pieces of mounted artillery, 44 dismounted guns, and ammunition, horses, wagons, forage, etc., valued at nearly $2,000,000.  On the 2nd of March, the Texan Rebels seized the United States Revenue cutter \"Dodge\" at Galveston; and on the 6th, Fort Brown was surrendered to them.  Thus, with surrender after surrender, and seizure after seizure, of its revenue vessels and fortifications and troops and arms and munitions of war in the Southern"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7134"],["title","The Great Conspiracy, Volume 2 (#6)"],["body","tes--with Fort Sumter invested and at the mercy of any attack, and Fortress Monroe alone of all the National strongholds yet safe--with State after State seceding--what wonder that, while these events gave all encouragement to the Southern Rebels, the Patriots of the North stood aghast at the appalling spectacle of a crumbling and dissolving Union!  During this period of National peril, the debates in both branches of Congress upon propositions for adjustment of the unfortunate differences between the Southern Seceders and the Union, as has been already hinted, contributed still further to agitate the public mind.  Speech after speech by the ablest and most brilliant Americans in public life, for or against such propositions, and discussing the rightfulness or wrongfulness of Secession, were made in Congress day after day, and, by means of the telegraph and the press, alternately swayed the Northern heart with feelings of hope, chagrin, elation or despair.  The Great Debate was opened in the Senate on almost the very first day of its session (December 4th, 1860), by Mr. Clingman, of North Carolina, who, referring to South Carolina, declared that \"Instead of being precipitate, she and the whole South have been wonderfully patient.\"  A portion of that speech is interesting even at this time, as showing how certain phases of the Tariff and Internal Improvement questions entered into the consideration of some of the Southern Secession leaders.  Said he, \"I know there are intimations that suffering will fall upon us of the South, if we secede.  My people are not terrified by any such considerations.  * * *  They have no fears of the future if driven to rely on themselves.  The Southern States have more territory than all the Colonies had when they Seceded from Great Britain, and a better territory.  Taking its position, climate, and fertility into consideration, there is not upon Earth a body of territory superior to it.  * * *  The Southern States have, too, at this day, four times the population the Colonies had when they Seceded from Great Britain.  Their exports to the North and to Foreign Countries were, last year, more than $300,000,000; and a duty of ten per cent. upon the same amount of imports would give $30,000,000 of revenue--twice as much as General Jackson's administration spent in its first year.  Everybody can see, too, how the bringing in of $300,000,000 of imports into Southern ports would enliven business in our seaboard towns.  I have seen with some satisfaction, also, Mr. President, that the war made upon us has benefitted certain branches of industry in my State.  There are manufacturing establishments in North Carolina, the proprietors of which tell me that they are making fifty per cent. annually on their whole capital, and yet cannot supply one tenth of the demand for their production.  The result of only ten per cent. duties in excluding products from abroad, would give life and impetus to mechanical and manufacturing industry, throughout the entire South.  Our people understand these things, and they are not afraid of results, if forced to declare Independence.  Indeed I do not see why Northern Republicans should wish to continue a connection with us upon any terms.  * * * They want High Tariff likewise.  They may put on five hundred per cent. if they choose, upon their own imports, and nobody on our side will complain.  They may spend all the money they raise on railroads, or opening harbors, or anything on earth they desire, without interference from us; and it does seem to me that if they are sincere in their views they ought to welcome a separation.\"  From the very commencement of this long three-months debate, it was the policy of the Southern leaders to make it appear that the Southern States were in an attitude of injured innocence and defensiveness against Northern aggression.  Hence, it was that, as early as December 5th, on the floor of the Senate, through Mr. Brown, of Mississippi, they declared: \"All we ask is to be allowed to depart in Peace.  Submit we will not; and if, because we will not submit to your domination, you choose to make War upon us, let God defend the Right!\"  At the same time it was esteemed necessary to try and frighten the North into acquiescence with this demand to be \"let alone.\"  Hence such utterances as those of Clingman and Iverson, to which reference has already been made, and the especially defiant close of the latter's speech, when--replying to the temperate but firm Union utterances of Mr. Hale--the Georgia Senator said: \"Sir, I do not believe there will be any War; but if War is to come, let it come; we will meet the Senator from New Hampshire and all the myrmidons of Abolitionism and Black Republicanism everywhere upon our own soil; and, in the language of a distinguished member from Ohio in relation to the Mexican War, we will 'welcome you with bloody hands to hospitable graves.'\"  On the other hand, in order to encourage the revolting States to the speedy commission of overt acts of Rebellion and violence, that would precipitate War without a peradventure, utterances fell from Southern lips, in the National Senate Chamber, like those of Mr. Wigfall, when he said, during this first day of the debate: \"Frederick the Great, on one occasion, when he had trumped up an old title to some of the adjacent territory, quietly put himself in possession and then offered to treat. Were I a South Carolinian, as I am a Texan, and I knew that my State was going out of the Union, and that this Government would attempt to use force, I would, at the first moment that that fact became manifest, seize upon the Forts and the arms and the munitions of war, and raise the cry 'To your tents, O Israel, and to the God of battles be this issue!\"  And, as we have already seen, the Rebels of the South were not slow in following the baleful advice to the letter.  But it was not many days after this utterance when the Conspirators against the Union evidently began to fear that the ground for Rebellion, upon which they had planted themselves, would be taken from under their feet by the impulse of Compromise and Concession which stirred so strongly the fraternal spirit of the North.  That peaceful impulse must be checked and exasperated by sneers and impossible demands.  Hence, on December 12th we find one of the most active and favorite mouthpieces of Treason, Mr. Wigfall, putting forth such demands, in his most offensive manner.  Said he: \"If the two Senators from New York (Seward and King), the Senator from Ohio (Wade), the two Senators from Illinois (Douglas and Trumbull), the Senator from New Hampshire (Hale), the Senator from Maine, and others who are regarded as representative men, who have denied that by the Constitution of the United States, Slaves are recognized as Property; who have urged and advocated those acts which we regard as aggressive on the part of the People--if they will rise here, and say in their places, that they desire to propose amendments to the Constitution, and beg that we will vote for them; that they will, in good faith, go to their respective constituencies and urge the ratification; that they believe, if these Gulf States will suspend their action, that those amendments will be ratified and carried out in good faith; that they will cease preaching this 'irrepressible conflict'; and if, in those amendments, it is declared that Slaves are Property, that they shall be delivered up upon demand; and that they will assure us that Abolition societies shall be abolished; that Abolition speeches shall no longer be made; that we shall have peace and quiet; that we shall not be called cut-throats and pirates and murderers; that our women shall not be slandered--these things being said in good faith, the Senators begging that we will stay our hand until an honest effort can be made, I believe that there is a prospect of giving them a fair consideration!\"  Small wonder is it, that this labored and ridiculous piece of impertinence was received with ironical laughter on the Republican side of the Senate Chamber.  And it was in reference to these threats, and these preposterous demands--including the suppression of the right of Free Discussion and Liberty of the Press--that, in the same chamber (January 7, 1861) the gallant and eloquent Baker said:  \"Your Fathers had fought for that right, and more than that, they had declared that the violation of that right was one of the great causes which impelled them to the Separation.  * * *  Sir, the Liberty of the Press is the highest safeguard to all Free Government.  Ours could not exist without it.  It is with us, nay, with all men, like a great exulting and abounding river, It is fed by the dews of Heaven, which distil their sweetest drops to form it.  It gushes from the rill, as it breaks from the deep caverns of the Earth.  It is fed by a thousand affluents, that dash from the mountaintop to separate again into a thousand bounteous and irrigating rills around.  On its broad bosom it bears a thousand barks.  There, Genius spreads its purpling sail. There, Poetry dips its silver oar.  There, Art, Invention, Discovery, Science, Morality, Religion, may safely and securely float.  It wanders through every land.  It is a genial, cordial source of thought and inspiration, wherever it touches, whatever it surrounds.  Sir, upon its borders, there grows every flower of Grace and every fruit of Truth.  I am not here to deny that that Stream sometimes becomes a dangerous Torrent, and destroys towns and cities upon its bank; but I am here to say that without it, Civilization, Humanity, Government, all that makes Society itself, would disappear, and the World would return to its ancient Barbarism.  \"Sir, if that were to be possible, or so thought for a moment, the fine conception of the great Poet would be realized.  If that were to be possible, though but for a moment, Civilization itself would roll the wheels of its car"]]]
