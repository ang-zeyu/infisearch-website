Turning about, he extended his hand to Otto with the smiling greeting: \"How do you do, my brother?\"  The words were spoken with as perfect accentuation as Jack Carleton could have used.  Had the speaker been invisible, no one would have believed him to be an Indian.  \"I does vell,\" replied Otto, shaking his hand firmly.  \"Dis ish my friend, Jack Carleton, dot I dinks a good deal of.\"  Dropping the hand of the German, Deerfoot took one step forward and saluted the young Kentuckian in the same manner.  He pressed his hand warmly, and, with the same smile as before, said:  \"Deerfoot is glad to meet his brother.\"  As he uttered these words the moonlight fell on his face and the front part of his body, so that a better view of countenance and features could not have been obtained.  Nearly a year had passed since we last saw Deerfoot (see \"Ned on the River\").  During that period, he had almost attained the full stature of a warrior.  It may be said that there was no single person, whether of his own or the Caucasian race, whom Deerfoot held in personal fear.  Those who have done me the honor of reading the \"Young Pioneer Series,\" will recall the marked attractiveness of Deerfoot's countenance.  The classical regularity of his features was relieved from effeminacy by the slightly Roman nose, which, with the thin lips, gave him an expression of firmness and nerve that was true to his character.  When he stepped in front of the great Tecumseh, with his knife clenched in his band, and dared the chieftain to mortal combat, the luminous black eyes flashed lightning, and the muscles on the graceful limbs were knotted like iron.  They were now in repose and the eyes were as soft as those of a maiden.  When Deerfoot smiled it was rarely more than it faint, shadowy expression, just sufficient to reveal the small, even, white teeth and to add to the winsomeness of his expression.  The love of finery and display seems natural to every human being, and it manifested itself in the dress of the young Shawanoe.  The long black hair, which streamed down his shoulders, was ornamented at the crown by several eagle feathers, brilliantly stained and thrust in place.  The fringes of the neatly fitting leggings were also colored, and the moccasins which incased the small shapely feet, were interwoven with beads of every line of the rainbow.  The body of the hunting shirt as well as the skirt, which descended almost to his knees, showed what may be called a certain subdued gaudiness which was not without its attractiveness.  The waist of the Shawanoe was clasped by a girdle into which were thrust a knife and tomahawk.  Relying upon the bow, instead of the rifle, he carried a quiver full of arrows, just showing over the right shoulder, where they could be readily plucked with his deft left hand, whenever required.  Deerfoot had tested both the rifle and the bowl and as has been shown gave his adherence to the latter.  Jack Carleton said to himself, \"He is the handsomest being I ever looked upon.\"  He was perfect in build, graceful in every movement, with an activity and power almost incredible, an eye large, black, and honest, but keen and penetrating, and a command of which approached the marvelous.  These characteristics of the young warrior struck Jack Carleton while pressing the warm hand of his new friend and looking into his pleasing countenance for the first time.  \"I am delighted to see you,\" he said, recalling the amazing stories told of Deerfoot by Ned Preston, and beginning to think that, after all, they may have contained more truth than fiction.  Before Jack could add anything more, Otto Relstaub, who was staring at the two, heaved a great sigh, as if fearing some danger would come upon them.  \"What is the matter with my brother?\" asked Deerfoot, looking inquiringly toward him with his old smile.  \"I asks mineself if we stands here till all last night, don't it?\"  \"I suppose we may as well seek more comfortable quarters,\" remarked Jack Carleton, who turned to the young warrior and added, \"When Deerfoot is present no one else dare lead.  What says he?\"     CHAPTER V  AROUND THE CAMP-FIRE   On a tempestuous night in midwinter the little settlement of Coatesville, in Kentucky, was assailed by a fierce band of Shawanoes and Hurons.  The pioneers were surprised, for the hour was near daybreak, and, accustomed as they were to the forays of the border, they were without the slightest warning of the danger which burst upon them.  They rallied, however, and made an heroic defense, but when with the dawning of day the warriors withdrew, they left more than half the hearthstones darkened with sorrow and woe, because of one or more of its defenders who had fallen in the strife.  Among those that had perished was Abram Carleton, shot down on his own threshold while fighting for his wife and his boy Jack, who themselves were doing their utmost to beat back their merciless enemies.  The youth, as he grew older, gradually recovered from his grief, but the blow was so terrible to the stricken widow that its effect remained with her through all the years that followed.  The vivacious, bright-hearted wife became the sad, thoughtful woman, who rarely smiled, and who walked forever in the shadow of her desolation.  She had only her boy Jack, and to him she gave the whole wealth of her attention; but she could never forget the brave one that had yielded his life for her and her child.  Some years later a portion of the settlers became dissatisfied with their home, peculiarly exposed as it was to attacks from marauding red men, and determined to cross the Mississippi into that portion of Louisiana which to-day forms the great State of Missouri.  To many it seemed a strange refuge, for the change, it may be said, took them still further from civilization; but the reader well knows that the settlement of no portion of the Union was marked by such deeds of ferocity as that of the Dark and Bloody Ground, and the pioneers had good grounds to hope for better things in the strange land toward which they turned their footsteps.  The lead mines of Missouri attracted notice a early as 1720, and Saint Genevieve, its oldest town, was founded in 1755.  At the breaking out of the Revolution, St. Louis contained nearly a thousand inhabitants, the country at that time belonging to Spain, and a considerable fur trade was carried on with the Indians.  Among those who crossed the Mississippi was the widow Carleton.  Her friends believed that if she removed forever from the scene of her great affliction she might recover; but if she remained she must soon succumb.  She suffered herself to be persuaded, and went in the company of those who promised to give her the tenderest attention and care.  Her decision was not made until the little company, that had spent weeks in preparation, was on the eve of starting.  It thus became necessary for Jack to stay behind to look after certain interests of both, his purpose being to follow in the course of a few weeks.  The long journey westward was made in safety, a thriving settlement begun, and young Otto Relstaub, the son of a hard-hearted, penurious German, was sent back over the trail, according to promise, to guide Jack Carleton, who was impatiently awaiting him.  The next morning after his arrival the two started westward, all their earthly effects packed upon the single horse.  They took turns in riding the animal.  Accustomed as they were to constant activity, they would have enjoyed the journey on foot much more than on horseback.  At first both walked, but, after their animal had run away several times, his capture causing much delay, trouble, and roiling of temper, they concluded that a change would have to be made if they expected ever to reach their destination.  One afternoon, when Otto was riding considerably in advance of his friend, he was fired upon by Indians, narrowly escaping with his life. The incidents immediately following have already been told the reader.  It was yet early in the evening when Deerfoot the Shawanoe acted upon the request of Otto, that some more convenient spot should be selected in which to continue their talk.  Inasmuch as the destination of the boys lay to the westward, it seemed to Jack Carleton that, the wisest thing to do was to enter the canoe, and allow the young Shawanoe to paddle them across; but he held the gifts and skill of the wonderful warrior in such high estimation that he feared a hint of the kind might not be received with favor.  Deerfoot led the way through the wood until a depression was reached, where considerable undergrowth grew.  He came to a stop and seemed to be looking around in the darkness, which to the others was impenetrable.  \"Let a fire be kindled,\" said he.  Only a few minutes were needed to gather all the fuel required.  It was heaped against the trunk of a tree, and as each carried a flint and steel, a bright roaring blaze was soon under way.  Had Jack and Otto been alone, they would have been troubled by the fear that their campfire would be seen by prowling enemies but the air of unconcern on the part of the Shawanoe infused into them a feeling of confidence which drove away all fear.  Enough branches and leaves were piled together to afford them the best sort of couch.  Not one had it blanket with him, and had the weather been cold, they must have suffered not a little.  The boys had lost theirs when their horse ran away the last time, and Deerfoot had not brought any with him, though one remained in his canoe.  Fortunately the night was not only mild, but scarcely a breath of air was stirring.  The fire radiated all the heat needed to make each comfortable.  They assumed easy postures on the ground, and, as the reflection lit up each countenance, they looked curiously at one another, as if seeking more intimate knowledge of their appearance.  Deerfoot and Jack have already been sufficiently referred to, and a little"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6906"],["title","The Lost Trail (#5)"],["body","is due to the honest German youth, who has his part to play in the following pages.  Otto was about a year younger than his friend, and bore very little resemblance to him.  Jack possessed a certain rugged grace, and, while he was not handsome, his face showed intelligence with mental strength, sustained by bounding youth, and a physical vigor which was perfect.  Otto was a head shorter than Jack, and his growth seemed to run mostly to breadth.  His short legs bowed outward at the knees, and a curve seemed necessary in order to preserve the harmony of general expanse.  His face was very wide, the small twinkling eyes fax apart, and the funny pug nose inclined in the same direction.  His neck was short, and hair long and thick.  His dress was similar to that worn by Jack Carleton, except that everything, even to the shoes, were of the coarsest possible nature.  Jacob Relstaub, the father of Otto, was not merely penurious, but he was miserly and mean.  Jack Carleton knew him so well that he was certain there would be serious trouble with the lad if he showed himself in the little frontier town without the valuable horse which had run away and swam the river.  There was one respect in which the dress of the German differed from that of the American.  Instead of wearing a cap, he was furnished with a hat something similar to those seen in some portions of the Tyrol.  It had a brim of moderate width, and the crown gradually tapered until it attained a height of six inches, where it ended in it point.  The thrifty mother possessed a secret of imparting a stiffness to the head gear which caused it to keep its shape, except when limp from moisture.  Such youths as Otto and Jack are always blessed with the most vigorous appetites, but they had eaten during the afternoon and were well content to wait until the morrow.  As for Deerfoot, it made little difference to him whether he had partaken since the rising of the sun, for he had been taught from his infancy to hold every propensity of his nature in the sternest check.  Oft-times he went hungry for no other purpose than that of self-discipline.  \"How was it you came to meet Otto?\" asked Jack of the dusky youth, who, assuming an easy position on the ground, was examining his bow. He looked up, smiled faintly, and hesitated a moment before answering.  \"Two suns ago Deerfoot came upon a log cabin.  It was raining and cold, and he was a long ways from home.  He saw the glimmer of a light and reached for the latch-string, but it was pulled in.  He knocked on the door and it was opened by the man who lived there. Deerfoot asked that he might stay till morning, but the pale face called him an Indian dog, and said that if he did not hasten away he would shoot him--\"  \"Don't you know who dot vos?\" interrupted Otto, whose face seemed to grow wider with its immense grin.  \"How should I know.\" asked Jack, in turn.  \"Dot was mine fader.  I dinks yon vosn't such a fool dot you wouldn't know dot right away.\"  \"I knew that he was the stingiest man in Kentucky, but I didn't suppose you spelled his name 'h-o-g.\"'  \"Dot's just de way to spell it,\" said Otto, slapping his friend on the shoulder and laughing as though pleased beyond measure.  \"Wait till you don't know him as well as I don't.\"  \"Deerfoot turned to walk away,\" continued the young Shawanoe; \"he had slept many times in the wood, and he was not afraid, but he had not taken many steps when some one called him.  It was too dark to see, but the voice was of a boy.  While Deerfoot waited he threw a heavy, blanket over his shoulders and made Deerfoot walk back to the cabin.  He asked him to enter the window where the father could not see him, and he told Deerfoot he would place him in his bed and he should have food.\"  The narrator paused in his story and glanced toward Otto Relstaub. Jack, with a laugh, looked at the stubby youngster, who was blushing deeply and holding one hand over his face, the fingers spread so far apart that he could see the others.  Otto was also smiling, and his hand could not begin to hide it, so that each side of his mouth wits in sight.  \"Deerfoot was too proud to receive the offer of the boy, but he took the blanket.\"  \"And mine gracious!\" struck in the lad again; \"didn't mine fader whip me for dat?  He proke up three hickory sticks onto me and kept me dancing out of de cabin and in again, and over the roof, till I vos so disgusted as nefer vos.\"  \"How did you explain the absence of the blanket?\" asked Jack.  \"I told mine fader I didn't know not any nodings apout it, and he whipped me 'cause I didn't know vot I did know, and, when Deerfoot brought pack de blanket next day, den he knows dat I lied and he whipped some more as nefer pefore.\"  Jack Carleton threw back his bead and laughed, though he took care that he made little noise in doing so; but the face of the Shawanoe was grave.  His refined nature could see nothing mirthful in the cruel punishment inflicted upon the boy because he did a kindness to a stranger of another race.  The brutal father had only to thank the Christian restraint of Deerfoot that he was not pierced by an arrow from his bow for his conduct.  The Shawanoe did not need explain that the little act of Otto had secured his lasting gratitude.  The latter was not one to seek his company or intrude himself upon him; but he was ready to do the young German any service in his power.  A few days before, when Deerfoot was returning from the direction of the Mississippi, he met Otto on horseback.  The latter told him he was going to Coatesville to bring back a young friend, whose mother was in the new settlement.  For some reason, which the Shawanoe did not make known, he could not accompany Otto, or he would have done so; but he gave him full directions and numerous suggestions, every one of which Otto forgot within the following fifteen minutes.  Deerfoot, however, after making some calculations as to the time the boys would reach the Mississippi on their return, promised to meet them there and to take them across in his canoe, which was hidden not far away.  The Shawanoe particularly instructed Otto that, if the meeting should take place at night, he would make known his departure from the Louisiana side by swinging a torch in a circular manner.  It was this signal which recalled the agreement to the mind of Otto Relstaub, who remembered much more than he would have Jack Carleton believe.     CHAPTER VI  NIGHT AND MORNING   Deerfoot made known his purpose to take his friends across the Mississippi on the morrow in his canoe, after which he would keep them company for some distance along the trail, though he would be forced to leave them long before reaching their destination.  Jack Carleton naturally felt a deep interest in the youthful warrior, and expected him to give some facts in his wonderful history, as well as an intimation of what his life was likely to be in the new country to which he had removed, but much to the young Kentuckian's disappointment, he carefully avoided all reference to himself.  His conversation being of such a nature that it is hardly worth recording in this place.  When the evening was well along, Otto threw more wood on the flames which crackled and gave out a cheerful glow.  Deerfoot rose to his feet, and without a word passed out into the gloom.  The hour for retiring was close at hand, and he preferred to make a reconnaissance before trusting themselves to slumber.  He returned as noiselessly as he went, remarking as he resumed his seat that no danger whatever threatened them, and they could slumber in peace.  While speaking, he drew from a pocket within the skirt of his bunting-shirt, the little Bible which had been presented to him months before by Mrs. Preston of Wild Oaks, after the other volume was destroyed by the bullet that was aimed at the heart of the youth, by the hostile chieftain.  Adjusting himself in an easy posture on the ground, so that the ruddy fire-light came over his shoulders and fell upon the page with its minute letters, the young Shawanoe read for several minutes to himself.  The others held their peace, impressed with the singular sight.  Neither could doubt that he clearly comprehended every word of the sublime volume, and they felt that it was wrong to break in upon his meditation.  All at once he raised his head and asked, \"Would my brothers wish to hear Deerfoot read?\"  \"We would, indeed,\" was the reply of Jack Carleton; \"I never saw an Indian who could read from a, printed book, but I have been told that you can write an excellent hand.\"  Deerfoot shook his head disparagingly.  \"My brother mistakes, but Deerfoot will try and read the words which the Great Spirit speaks to all his people, whether they are pale faces or red men.\"  And then, in a low musical voice, tremulous with emotion and impressive beyond description, the Shawanoe read an entire chapter from the book of Revelations, his favorite portion of the blessed Book, the others listening spellbound.  Even Otto Relstaub, who saw and heard little of genuine Christian teachings in his cheerless home, was touched as never before by the indescribably solemn story of the apocalyptic vision.  The silence which succeeded lasted several minutes, when Jack said in a low voice:  \"Deerfoot, I wish you would speak some sentences from the Bible in your own tongue.\"  \"Does my brother wish to learn the Shawanoe language?\"  \"I have heard Shawanoes, Hurons and Miamis talk, but I can't understand a word; I have a curiosity to know how it will sound to hear some parts of the Bible with which I am familiar tittered in an unknown tongue.\"  \"What part of the book can my brother repeat without reading the words?\"  \"Well--that is--I don't know,\" replied Jack, confused by the question of Deerfoot, who fixed his eyes inquiringly upon him; \"I mean any sentence.\"  \"Does my brother not read the Bible every day?\" asked the Indian, in a grieved rather than a reproving voice; \"he must know "]]]
