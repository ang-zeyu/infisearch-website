Not even to herself for a moment would she admit that there was any possibility of Bob failing to “make good” and take her away.  She went downstairs next morning to an atmosphere of sullen resentment. Her father gave her a brief, abstracted nod, in response to her greeting, and went on with his bacon and his Daily Mail; her stepmother's forbidding expression checked any attempt at conversation. The children stared at her with a kind of malevolent curiosity; they knew that a storm had been brewing for her the night before, and longed to know just how thoroughly she had “caught it.” Eliza, bringing in singed and belated toast, looked at her with pity, tinged with admiration. Cook and she had been awakened at midnight by what was evidently, in the words of Cook, “a perfickly 'orrible bust-up,” and knowing Cecilia to have been its object, Eliza looked at her as one may look who expects to see the scars of battle. Finding none, but receiving instead a cheerful smile, she returned to the kitchen, and reported to Cook that Miss Cecilia was “nuffink less than a neroine.”  But as that day and the next wore on, Cecilia found it difficult to be cheerful. That she was in disgrace was very evident, Mrs. Rainham said no more about her sins of the night before; instead, she showed her displeasure by a kind of cold rudeness that gave a subtle insult to her smallest remark. The children were manifestly delighted. Cecilia was more or less in the position of a beetle on a pin, and theirs was the precious opportunity of seeing her wriggle. Wherefore they adopted their mother's tone, openly defied her, and turned school-hours into a pandemonium.  Cecilia at last gave up the attempt to keep order. She opened her desk and took out her knitting.  “Well, this is all very pleasant,” she said, calmly. “You seem determined to do no work at all, so I can only hope that in time you will get tired of being idle. I can't attempt to teach you any more. I am quite ready, however, if you bring your lessons to me.”  “You'll get into a nice row from the Mater,” jeered Wilfred.  “Very possibly. She may even punish me by finding another governess,”  said Cecilia, with a twinkle. “However that may be, I do not feel compelled to talk to such rude little children as you any more. When you are able to speak politely you may come to me for anything you want; until then, I shall not answer you.” She bent her attention to the mysteries of heel-turning.  The children were taken aback. To pinprick with rudeness a victim who answered back was entertaining; but there was small fun in baiting anybody who sat silently knitting with a half-smile of contempt at the corners of her mouth. They gave it up after a time, and considered the question of going out; a pleasant thing to do, only that their mother had laid upon them a special injunction not to leave Cecilia, and she was in a mood that made disobedience extremely dangerous. Cecilia quite understood that she was being watched. No letters had yet come from Bob, and she knew that her stepmother had been hovering near the letter-box whenever the postman had called. Mrs. Rainham had accompanied them on their walk the day before; a remark of Avice's revealed that she meant to do so again to-day.  “It's all so silly,” the girl said to herself. “If I chose to dive into a tube station or board a motor-bus she couldn't stop me; and she can't go on watching me and intercepting my letters indefinitely. I suppose she will get tired of it after a while.” But meanwhile she found the spying rather amusing. Avice popped up unexpectedly if she went near the front door; Wilfred's bullet head peeped in through the window whenever she fancied herself alone in the schoolroom. Only her attic was safe--since to spy upon it would have required an aeroplane.  The third day brought no letter from Bob. Cecilia asked for her mail when she went down to breakfast, and was met by a blank stare from her stepmother--“I suppose if there had been any letters for you they would be on your plate.” She flushed a little under the girl's direct gaze, and turned her attention to Queenie's table manners, which were at all times peculiar; and Cecilia sat down with a faint smile. It was time to obey orders and telegraph to Bob.  She planned how to do it, during a long morning when the children actually did some work--since to be rude or idle meant that their teacher immediately retired into her shell of silence, and knitted, and life became too dull. To employ Eliza was her first thought--rejected, since it seemed unlikely that Eliza would be able to get time off to go out. If Mrs. Rainham's well-known dislike for walking proved too strong for her desire to watch her stepdaughter, it would be easy enough to do it during the afternoon; but this hope proved vain, for when she appeared in the hall with her charges at three o'clock the lady of the house sailed from the drawing-room, ready for the march. They moved off in procession; Mrs. Rainham leading the way, with Avice and Wilfred, while Cecilia brought up the rear, holding Queenie's podgy hand.  She had telegraph forms in her desk, and the message, already written, and even stamped, was in the pocket of her coat. There was nothing for it but to act boldly, and accordingly, when they entered a street in which there was a post office, she let Queenie lag until they were a little distance behind the others. Then, as they reached the post office, she turned sharply in.  “Wait a minute, Queenie.”  She thrust her message across the counter hurriedly. The clerk on duty was provokingly slow; he finished checking a document, and then lounged across to the window and took the form, running over it leisurely.  “Oh, you've got the stamps on. All right,” he said, and turned away just as quick steps were heard, and Mrs. Rainham bustled in, panting.  “What are you doing?”  Cecilia met her with steady eyes.  “Nothing wrong, I assure you.” She had had visions of covering her real purpose by buying stamps--but rejected it with a shrug.  “Thethilia gave the man a pieth of paper!” said Queenie shrilly.  “What was it? I demand to know!” cried Mrs. Rainham. She turned to the clerk, who stood open-mouthed, holding the telegram in his hand. “Show me that telegram. I am this young lady's guardian.”  The clerk grinned broadly. The stout and angry lady made no appeal to him, and Cecilia was a pretty girl, and moreover her telegram was for a flying captain. The clerk wore a returned soldier's badge himself. He fell back on Regulations.  “Can't be done, ma'am. The message is all in order.”  “Let me see it.”  “Much as my billet's worth, if I did,” said the clerk. “Property of the Postmaster-General now, ma'am. Couldn't even give it back to the young lady.”  “I'll report you!” Mrs. Rainham fumed.  “Do, ma'am. I'll get patted on the head for doin' me duty.” The clerk's grin widened. Cecilia wished him good afternoon gravely, and slipped out of the office, pursued by her stepmother.  “What was in that telegram?”  “It was to my brother.”  “What was in it?”  “It was to Bob, and that is guarantee that there was nothing wrong in it,” Cecilia said steadily. “It was on private business.”  “You have no right to have any business that I do not know about.”  Cecilia found her temper rising.  “My father may have the power to say that--I do not know,” she said. “But you have none, Mrs. Rainham.”  “I'll let you see whether I have the right!” her stepmother blazed. “For two pins, young lady, I'd lock you up.”  Cecilia laughed outright.  “Ah, that's not done now,” she said. “You really couldn't, Mrs. Rainham--especially as I have done nothing wrong.” She dropped her voice--passers-by were looking with interest at the elder woman's face. “Why not let me go? You do not approve of me--let me find another position.”  “You'll stay in your father's house,” Mrs. Rainham said. “We'll see what the law has to say to your leaving with your precious Bob. Your father's your legal guardian, and in his control you stay until you're twenty-one, and be very thankful to make yourself useful. The law will deal with Bob if he tries to take you away--you're a minor, and it'd be abduction.” The word had a pleasantly legal flavour; she repeated it with emphasis. “Abduction; that's what it is, and there's a nice penalty for it. Now you know, and if you don't want to get Bob into trouble, you'd best be careful.”  Cecilia had grown rather white. The law was a great and terrible instrument, of which she knew nothing. It seemed to have swallowed up Aunt Margaret's money; it might very well have left her defenceless. Her stepmother seemed familiar with its powers, and able to evoke them at will; and though she did not trust her, there was something in her glib utterance that struck fear into the girl's heart. She did not answer, and Mrs. Rainham followed up her advantage.  “We'll go home,” she said. “And you make up your mind to tell me what was in that telegram, and not to have any secrets from me. One thing I can tell you--until you decide to behave yourself--Bob shan't show his nose in my house, and you shan't go out to meet him, either. He only leads you into mischief; I don't consider he has at all a good influence over you. The sooner he's away somewhere, earning his own living in a proper manner, the better for every one; and it'll be many a long day before he can give you as good a home as you've got now.” She paused for breath. “Anyhow, he's not going to have the chance,” she finished grimly.    CHAPTER V  THE TURN OF FORTUNE'S WHEEL   “Is Mr. M'Clinton in?”  The clerk, in a species of rabbit hutch, glanced out curiously at the young flying officer.  “Yes; but he's very busy. Have you an appointment?”  “No--I got leave unexpectedly.

G. Wodehouse  1909      PREFACE  It may be thought by some that in the pages which follow I have painted in too lurid colours the horrors of a foreign invasion of England. Realism in art, it may be argued, can be carried too far. I prefer to think that the majority of my readers will acquit me of a desire to be unduly sensational. It is necessary that England should be roused to a sense of her peril, and only by setting down without flinching the probable results of an invasion can this be done. This story, I may mention, has been written and published purely from a feeling of patriotism and duty. Mr. Alston Rivers' sensitive soul will be jarred to its foundations if it is a financial success. So will mine. But in a time of national danger we feel that the risk must be taken. After all, at the worst, it is a small sacrifice to make for our country.  P. G. WODEHOUSE.  _The Bomb-Proof Shelter,_ _London, W._      Part One     Chapter 1  AN ENGLISH BOY'S HOME   _August the First, 19--_  Clarence Chugwater looked around him with a frown, and gritted his teeth.  \"England--my England!\" he moaned.  Clarence was a sturdy lad of some fourteen summers. He was neatly, but not gaudily, dressed in a flat-brimmed hat, a coloured handkerchief, a flannel shirt, a bunch of ribbons, a haversack, football shorts, brown boots, a whistle, and a hockey-stick. He was, in fact, one of General Baden-Powell's Boy Scouts.  Scan him closely. Do not dismiss him with a passing glance; for you are looking at the Boy of Destiny, at Clarence MacAndrew Chugwater, who saved England.  To-day those features are familiar to all. Everyone has seen the Chugwater Column in Aldwych, the equestrian statue in Chugwater Road (formerly Piccadilly), and the picture-postcards in the stationers' windows. That bulging forehead, distended with useful information; that massive chin; those eyes, gleaming behind their spectacles; that _tout ensemble_; that _je ne sais quoi_.  In a word, Clarence!  He could do everything that the Boy Scout must learn to do. He could low like a bull. He could gurgle like a wood-pigeon. He could imitate the cry of the turnip in order to deceive rabbits. He could smile and whistle simultaneously in accordance with Rule 8 (and only those who have tried this know how difficult it is). He could spoor, fell trees, tell the character from the boot-sole, and fling the squaler. He did all these things well, but what he was really best at was flinging the squaler.         *       *       *       *       *  Clarence, on this sultry August afternoon, was tensely occupied tracking the family cat across the dining-room carpet by its foot-prints. Glancing up for a moment, he caught sight of the other members of the family.  \"England, my England!\" he moaned.  It was indeed a sight to extract tears of blood from any Boy Scout. The table had been moved back against the wall, and in the cleared space Mr. Chugwater, whose duty it was to have set an example to his children, was playing diabolo. Beside him, engrossed in cup-and-ball, was his wife. Reggie Chugwater, the eldest son, the heir, the hope of the house, was reading the cricket news in an early edition of the evening paper. Horace, his brother, was playing pop-in-taw with his sister Grace and Grace's _fiance_, Ralph Peabody. Alice, the other Miss Chugwater, was mending a Badminton racquet.  Not a single member of that family was practising with the rifle, or drilling, or learning to make bandages.  Clarence groaned.  \"If you can't play without snorting like that, my boy,\" said Mr. Chugwater, a little irritably, \"you must find some other game. You made me jump just as I was going to beat my record.\"  \"Talking of records,\" said Reggie, \"Fry's on his way to his eighth successive century. If he goes on like this, Lancashire will win the championship.\"  \"I thought he was playing for Somerset,\" said Horace.  \"That was a fortnight ago. You ought to keep up to date in an important subject like cricket.\"  Once more Clarence snorted bitterly.  \"I'm sure you ought not to be down on the floor, Clarence,\" said Mr. Chugwater anxiously. \"It is so draughty, and you have evidently got a nasty cold. _Must_ you lie on the floor?\"  \"I am spooring,\" said Clarence with simple dignity.  \"But I'm sure you can spoor better sitting on a chair with a nice book.\"  \"_I_ think the kid's sickening for something,\" put in Horace critically. \"He's deuced roopy. What's up, Clarry?\"  \"I was thinking,\" said Clarence, \"of my country--of England.\"  \"What's the matter with England?\"  \"_She's_ all right,\" murmured Ralph Peabody.  \"My fallen country!\" sighed Clarence, a not unmanly tear bedewing the glasses of his spectacles. \"My fallen, stricken country!\"  \"That kid,\" said Reggie, laying down his paper, \"is talking right through his hat. My dear old son, are you aware that England has never been so strong all round as she is now? Do you _ever_ read the papers? Don't you know that we've got the Ashes and the Golf Championship, and the Wibbley-wob Championship, and the Spiropole, Spillikins, Puff-Feather, and Animal Grab Championships? Has it come to your notice that our croquet pair beat America last Thursday by eight hoops? Did you happen to hear that we won the Hop-skip-and-jump at the last Olympic Games? You've been out in the woods, old sport.\"  Clarence's heart was too full for words. He rose in silence, and quitted the room.  \"Got the pip or something!\" said Reggie. \"Rum kid! I say, Hirst's bowling well! Five for twenty-three so far!\"  Clarence wandered moodily out of the house. The Chugwaters lived in a desirable villa residence, which Mr. Chugwater had built in Essex. It was a typical Englishman's Home. Its name was Nasturtium Villa.  As Clarence walked down the road, the excited voice of a newspaper-boy came to him. Presently the boy turned the corner, shouting, \"Ker-lapse of Surrey! Sensational bowling at the Oval!\"  He stopped on seeing Clarence.  \"Paper, General?\"  Clarence shook his head. Then he uttered a startled exclamation, for his eye had fallen on the poster.  It ran as follows:--      SURREY     DOING     BADLY     GERMAN ARMY LANDS IN ENGLAND     Chapter 2  THE INVADERS   Clarence flung the boy a halfpenny, tore a paper from his grasp, and scanned it eagerly. There was nothing to interest him in the body of the journal, but he found what he was looking for in the stop-press space. \"Stop press news,\" said the paper. \"Fry not out, 104. Surrey 147 for 8. A German army landed in Essex this afternoon. Loamshire Handicap: Spring Chicken, 1; Salome, 2; Yip-i-addy, 3. Seven ran.\"  Essex! Then at any moment the foe might be at their doors; more, inside their doors. With a passionate cry, Clarence tore back to the house.  He entered the dining-room with the speed of a highly-trained Marathon winner, just in time once more to prevent Mr. Chugwater lowering his record.  \"The Germans!\" shouted Clarence. \"We are invaded!\"  This time Mr. Chugwater was really annoyed.  \"If I have told you once about your detestable habit of shouting in the house, Clarence, I have told you a hundred times. If you cannot be a Boy Scout quietly, you must stop being one altogether. I had got up to six that time.\"  \"But, father----\"  \"Silence! You will go to bed this minute; and I shall consider the question whether you are to have any supper. It will depend largely on your behaviour between now and then. Go!\"  \"But, father----\"  Clarence dropped the paper, shaken with emotion. Mr. Chugwater's sternness deepened visibly.  \"Clarence! Must I speak again?\"  He stooped and removed his right slipper.  Clarence withdrew.  Reggie picked up the paper.  \"That kid,\" he announced judicially, \"is off his nut! Hullo! I told you so! Fry not out, 104. Good old Charles!\"  \"I say,\" exclaimed Horace, who sat nearest the window, \"there are two rummy-looking chaps coming to the front door, wearing a sort of fancy dress!\"  \"It must be the Germans,\" said Reggie. \"The paper says they landed here this afternoon. I expect----\"  A thunderous knock rang through the house. The family looked at one another. Voices were heard in the hall, and next moment the door opened and the servant announced \"Mr. Prinsotto and Mr. Aydycong.\"  \"Or, rather,\" said the first of the two newcomers, a tall, bearded, soldierly man, in perfect English, \"Prince Otto of Saxe-Pfennig and Captain the Graf von Poppenheim, his aide-de-camp.\"  \"Just so--just so!\" said Mr. Chugwater, affably. \"Sit down, won't you?\"  The visitors seated themselves. There was an awkward silence.  \"Warm day!\" said Mr. Chugwater.  \"Very!\" said the Prince, a little constrainedly.  \"Perhaps a cup of tea? Have you come far?\"  \"Well--er--pretty far. That is to say, a certain distance. In fact, from Germany.\"  \"I spent my summer holiday last year at Dresden. Capital place!\"  \"Just so. The fact is, Mr.--er--\"  \"Chugwater. By the way--my wife, Mrs. Chugwater.\"  The prince bowed. So did his aide-de-camp.  \"The fact is, Mr. Jugwater,\" resumed the prince, \"we are not here on a holiday.\"  \"Quite so, quite so. Business before pleasure.\"  The prince pulled at his moustache. So did his aide-de-camp, who seemed to be a man of but little initiative and conversational resource.  \"We are invaders.\"  \"Not at all, not at all,\" protested Mr. Chugwater.  \"I must warn you that you will resist at your peril. You wear no uniform--\"  \"Wouldn't dream of such a thing. Except at the lodge, of course.\"  \"You will be sorely tempted, no doubt. Do not think that I do not appreciate your feelings. This is an Englishman's Home.\"  Mr. Chugwater tapped him confidentially on the knee.  \"And an uncommonly snug little place, too,\" he said. \"Now, if you will forgive me for talking business, you, I gather, propose making some stay in this country.\"  The prince laughed shortly. So did his aide-de-camp. \"Exactly,\" continued Mr. Chugwater, \"exactly. Then you will want some _pied-a-terre_,"]]]
