No wonder thousands yearly throng this gifted spot of God's earth!  As may be needless to say, Monterey, became the center of the social life, beauty and culture of the mission towns. From Monterey, inspiration flowed as from a fountain head. And even to this day she is irresistible. Even to this day, in spite of the many sad scenes and oblivious years which have stamped their trace upon her loveliness and impaired her regal splendor, her charm is told by her landmarks and crowned by her natural fortress of hills, her forests and flower robed meadows, and lulled at evening by the murmur of the iridescent waters of her bay reflecting the sunset splendors of the sky.  About 1810 Monterey was ravaged by buccaneers under Blütcher, who was such a terror to many sea-port towns, these pirates sailed up the Pacific Coast, and appeared in Monterey Bay in four large vessels arriving at midnight. Before they could be driven out of the town they set fire to some of the Spanish Presidio homes and carried away precious jewels and silver belonging to the Spanish ladies, and provisions from the garrison.  The former Capilla Real de San Carlos is now the parish church of Monterey, guarding like a fond mother all that remains of the massive silver altar vessels and candelabras, paintings, statues, vestments, manuscripts and archives of the pioneer missionaries of this mission.  Among the modern attractions of Monterey we must not fail to mention Hotel Del Monte built and owned by the Pacific Improvement Company, and the many beautiful drives constructed by the same, company. Mr. Frank Powers was the founder of the flourishing settlement of Carmel-by-the-Sea, a few minutes walk from San Carlos Mission and a favorite resort of artists and literateurs. These with many others have been no small contributors to the old Capital. Thus while we deplore years of vandalism, and the thousands who have joined the \"careless throng\" we can always turn to the pleasing contrast of sympathizers and friends who are always, willing to give \"honor to whom honor is due,\" and in doing so have spared neither purse nor efforts in aiding those who under difficulties have guarded the flame of tradition and love of the splendid past with its bright galaxy of \"heroes, martyrs, saints.\" True, the glowing embers often smouldered beneath a debris of neglect and even harsh misrepresentation but were not and could not be extinguished. And now faithful hearts may beat fast with holy joy for the feeble light fanned by loving zephyrs has burst into a glowing flame destined to diffuse its love and influence to all, regardless of creed, race or station.    Chapter IV        California Under Spanish Rule    With the landing of Serra and Portolá at San Diego in 1769, began the Spanish period of California. The chief events of this period are in a pith, the following: The establishment of the missions, the christianizing of the Indians and the exploration and colonization of California. It is from the Spanish period that the history and standing of California date. The ten Spanish Governors of California as well as the officers of the Army and Navy were men of honor and ability, and the record left by the Spanish settlers is one of which any country might be proud. During the Spanish period the geographical lines of California were settled and her harbors surveyed [4]. It was during this period that most of the present cities of California were founded, Spain following the plan of building the towns around the missions. The first Governor, Don Gaspar de Portolá, was a great and good man as well as a brilliant officer, gentle and reasonable in every respect, he was beloved by all; to him California owes the discovery of San Francisco Bay, and the great co-operation he gave to Junipero Serra, as well as his reverent esteem for this saintly man has endeared his memory to every true Californian, and immortalized his name in Spain. After a period of two years in office Portolá went to Mexico, then under Spanish rule, and from there returned to Spain.  Portolá was succeeded by Gov. Felipe de Barri, who after three years was removed from office on account of infringing on the rights of the missionaries and siding with Captain Rivera Y. Moncada who was a somewhat arrogant man, who also on several occasions infringed on the rights of the missionaries; but the faults of the latter have been very exaggerated by some historians, namely, some declare that he was ex-communicated from the church on account of insolence to the missionaries, whereas there is no record of such a fact. Excepting their officiousness and arrogance, Barri and Rivera were moral and able men.  Barri was succeeded by Felipe de Neve, a statesman, scholar and worthy governor who at once declared himself the friend and protector of the missionaries. It was Governor de Neve who drew up California's first code of legislation dated from the \"Royal Presidio of San Carlos at Monterey\" in June 1779. This code known as the \"Reglamento\" is regarded by capable judges as a most remarkable and valuable document. It was also Governor de Neve who founded the present city of Los Angeles, the original name of which was Neustra Señora de los Angeles, later shortened into Los Angeles. The towns of San Jose and Santa Clara also owe their foundation to de Neve, who selected the location of these cities around the mission sites. After eight years of office de Neve was marked for higher honors, and was succeeded by Governor Pedro Fages.  Governor Fages was a good and energetic man, but better fitted for the army than for the state; he was noted for his lofty principals of morality. Fages resigned his office and returned to Spain; he was not a tactful ruler, but like many others his name has suffered at the hands of unscrupulous writers. Fages was succeeded in 1790 by Governor José Antonio Romeú, a bright and able but very sickly man. Dr. Pablo Soler the excellent physician and surgeon of the Province of California was unable to help him; and Romeú died in Monterey in less than two years of office.  José de Arrillaga was the sixth governor. This governor was a finished general, and placed the presidios of California on a solid basis; he was painstaking and careful of detail. He resigned on account of private business affairs but later returned as he was reappointed governor of California.  The seventh governor was Diego de Boríca. Around this Governor cluster many beautiful pages of Spanish history in California; his was a character as gentle, religious and home-loving as he was scholarly and tactful. It was under Boríca's administration that the boundary lines of Upper and Lower California were clearly defined. Boríca, however, was not a man who courted public life or honors, and resigned his office, returning to Spain with his charming wife and daughter who always longed for their mother country.  Before leaving Boríca did a good service to Spain and California in recommending the reappointment of José Joaquin Arrillaga. Arrillaga continued to organize strong military defenses for California. He served as Spanish Governor of California fourteen years, and first of all declared himself on all occasions \"a loyal son of the Church.\" He died at Mission Soledad on July 25, 1813, and was buried there. The only Spanish Governor to be buried in California.  The ninth Spanish Governor was José Dario Arguello, who was in office one year, the interval between the death of Arrillaga and the advent of Pablo Vicente de Solá the last Spanish Governor of California.  When Governor Solá took office in 1814, California had already bloomed into a garden of beautiful men and women, many of them from the mother country, others their children born in this distant province of Castile. Also many Yankee, Russian and English trading ships came to California then, and the Spanish presidios were the scenes of many brilliant dances and entertainment's. These foreign vessels were always welcome; while the Governors were careful that the power of Spain was not infringed upon, perfect courtesy and friendliness was always maintained by both Spaniards and visitors. Thus when Governor Solá arrived to take his office he was given a royal welcome. Of course, it was in Monterey that every governor took up his residence (at the Royal Presidio) and their first act was to attend Solemn High Mass at the Royal Chapel of San Carlos of Monterey. Solá was no exception to the rule; amid salutes from the cannon of the Presidio and the cheers of loyal subjects, by the Catalonian cavalry, and their officers in their gorgeous velvet uniforms, gold swords and plumed hats, Solá proceeded to the Royal Chapel where the Franciscan Fathers awaited him in their priestly vestments. Three days of carnival followed, but on the second day Governor Solá withdrew from the festivities, made the Stations of the Cross [5] which the fathers had erected between Monterey and Carmelo, and on reaching San Carlos of Carmelo was shown to the tombs of Junipero Serra, Juan Crespí and Francisco de Laséun. Here the Governor knelt and remained long in prayer.  In California Solá found a pleasing contrast from the conditions of affairs he had seen during his sojourn in Mexico. In that country clouds of revolt against Spanish rule were rapidly gathering. California he found intensely loyal to the Crown. The neophytes and converted Indians greatly touched his generous soul, and the beauty of the country delighted him. Solá was in office eight years; his work was well done, and if California was lost to Spain under his administration, no less credit can be given to his ability and high principals of honor. Many times did Solá quell disturbances from revolutionary vessels which landed in Monterey from"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6894"],["title","Chimes of Mission Bells; an historical sketch of California and her missions (#7)"],["body","o, and several attacks from pirates, and many a noble act is recorded of this loyal governor as well as of the no less loyal Spanish subjects of the Province. If the Mexican Government supplanted Spanish rule and \"laid desolate\" much of the work done by this brilliant period of California, we repeat it was due to no treachery or cowardice of Solá and his compatriots as we shall see elsewhere in this sketch. Spain came into possession of California with honor, maintained it with honor, and after her three-fold honorable policy of exploration, colonization and christianizing of its heathen natives, left it with honor, but her monuments remained. If a few political troubles and abuses existed, they pale before the light of the myriad of great deeds and purposes, and where is the country or people who are utterly flawless individually? No cruelties or uncleanness can ever be proven against Spain or her people here. Spanish society and refinement was the first which California saw; under Spain were thousands of Indians rescued from savagery, and under Spain was California made known to the world, as well as discovered. Under Spain too were the first land grants made to her subjects in California.  Some historians and casual observers are inclined to blame Spain for not having lent more aid to her loyal California colonies and enabled her presidios to have more and better fortifications. But let us examine these points more coolly. First of all this province was far away from the mother country, means of travel and communication were then far different from what they are now, and Spain was also busy with political troubles at home; she had always sent her most representative men as governors and officers, her settlers were no less worthy, most of them coming here with no \"empty purse\" as adventurers, but were men of education and standing in their country. The galaxy of saintly missionaries is superfluous to mention, so above are they of the least sting of reproach, and lastly so clean are the pages of Spanish history in California that no serious student of whatever race or creed he or she may be, can but deplore the calumnies that have at times been hurled at this golden period of California history. It was from the Spanish period of California that the present capital of the state dates having been named Santisimo Sacramento (Most Holy Sacrament) in honor of the Eucharistic Presence of the Altar. Thus we see the vein of piety of the Spanish settlers who gave names of religious significance to so many of the towns they founded, and even to their land grants. In fine these sterling men were worthy compatriots of those giant men and women which have appeared at different times in Spain. We refer to Saints, Ignatius of Loyola, Francis Xavier, Dominic, Theresa of Jesus and a myriad others, also to the fair array of kings and queens, poets, artists, explorers, whose illustrious names would fill volumes.  When treading El Camino Real and kneeling by the sacred tombs of Junipero Serra and his hero band of soul-conquerors we may well recall that passage of the beautiful Hymn of the Knights of Columbus.  \"Brothers we are treading Where the saints have trod.\"    Chapter V        California Passes From Spanish to Mexican Rule,      Secularization of the Missions    Amidst the beauty and glory of Spain's dominion in California, while the gold emblazoned banners of Castile and Leon floated proudly under azure skies, while the Spanish governors, officers and colonists were doing honor and credit to their ancient race, and the saintly missionaries were working marvels for the souls and bodies of the aborigines of the land, while Spain was thus lending \"her beauty and her chivalry\" to California; Mexico, forgetting her old debt to Spain, when she explored her then heathen shores, had revolted against Spanish rule and set up an empire of her own, making Augustin Iturbide, a man of half Indian blood her Emperor. Immediately Mexico claimed California, as well as Texas, Arizona and New Mexico as a portion of her empire, although the people of California, with the exception of a handful of Mexicans, had never shown the least desire of change of government, for the greatest number of her settlers were Spaniards or their children who were intensely loyal to the Crown of Spain. Here we will add that no person who held any office of importance was any other than a Spaniard, or of purely Spanish blood or parentage, hence missionaries, bishops, army and navy officers, surgeons, etc. were all \"children of Spain,\" the highest decoration that a mixed blood could attain in the Spanish army of California or of Mexico was that of Corporal or Sergeant. But when Mexico gained her independence all these corporals and sergeants were suddenly made generals by their country, Mexico; and here was clearly seen \"who was who\" for all mixed bloods as well as those of purely Indian birth, both in Mexico and California raffled around their standard, the new Mexican flag; in this number we will only except many of the Christian Indians, in California, who clung piteously to the missions, and who had more of their share of suffering. This state of affairs enabled the new Mexican authorities, exultant over their victory in the gain of their independence, to send several war vessels to Monterey late in 1822 and demand of Governor Solá, the surrender of California in the name of Emperor Augustin Iturbide. As we have already seen, nowhere in Spain's New World possessions was loyalty to the mother country more intense than in California, and the people, army and navy were loud in their demonstrations of opposition, and expressions of willingness were offered to the governor to fight the intrusion of Mexico to the end. But the comparative handful of soldiers of the various garrisons, as well as the few ships which the Spanish could muster in California were no match to the overwhelming forces from Mexico, and Governor Solá considered it no cowardly act but rather his conscience-bound duty to prevent a useless carnage, wisely preferring an honorable surrender under the circumstances. The prudence of this decision was soon seen in a clearer light by the people. It was thus that the grand old flag of Spain was hurled from her state fifty-three years after she had been hoisted amid the blessing of Junipero Serra, the salutes of her proud ships and the loyal acclamations of Portolá and her other gallant sons. Now Spanish rule was virtually ended in California, but we repeat, not dishonorably. Spain's, work was well done, her chief purpose gained, namely, the exploration and christianizing of California.  As it took sometime for Mexico to mobilize her troops and settle her rule in California, the Royal Presidio of Monterey was not immediately emptied of its officers or of the Spanish families, whose positions entitled them to a residence there, and who continued to live there close on to 1824. Thus although the old familiar standard gave place to Mexico's new red, white and green, the imprint of Spanish rule remained.  Indeed it was several years before Mexico could change the face of California, and the Spanish element continued to rule social life at least to a great extent through virtually all the Mexican period. The Mexican society of the time certainly contained some excellent exceptions, but as a general rule it was a sad contrast to that of the preceding period, nor had the ten governors of this era the energy or standing of the ever remembered Portolá, Boríca, de Neve, Arrillaga or Solá. At times, the Mexican authorities treated Spaniards shabbily for it is important to note that contrary to what many histories state, Spaniards unanimously refused to take the Constitutional Oath of Allegiance to Mexico, and withdrew as a consequence from all public affairs, only inasmuch as their family interests or the good of the community demanded their intervention. Thus we find no Spaniard as Governor, General, or the like during this period. But here a curious thing occurred. In later years when writers and historians of California became numerous many Mexicans declared themselves Spaniards or classed themselves as of purely Spanish descent, passing as such into some histories, while at the same time they did not hesitate to \"sting\" the Spanish name; and there are many California families who are referred to as \"Spanish\" whose ancestors in the baptismal and marriage records of the various mission archives are recorded as \"neófita de la mission\" (\"neophyte of the mission\") for the Spanish missionaries were most accurate of details, and their records of marriages, baptisms and funerals are like sketches of the persons concerned; parentage, birth all are given in detail. Thus a child born of Spanish parents is referred to as \"de calidad Española\" (\"of Spanish quality\") or if of some other purely foreign extraction the same is mentioned. And fortunate indeed, that this care of detail was had in the new country, else how would much valuable knowledge be obtained?  During our narrative we do not wish to lose sight of the fact that we have professed our work to be primarily a work of love, avoiding bitter truth, which can do no good, and avoiding personalities, hence the absence of names may be noted in this chapter, but it is invariably the unpleasant duty of a writer to tell some unpleasant things in a historical sketch, else how could justice be done to others, and how straighten misunderstandings? We do not wish to merely cast aspersions at the Mexican race or any other, for the gross and sordid not to say sinful delight of doing so, but we wish to present to the reader plain facts of this period of history. Here we will add that even as \"there is beauty in a blade of grass\" there were and are good qualities and virtues in many individual Mexicans, but we cannot but wonder at the contrast of the two first periods of our state's history, and at the difference so vast between"]]]
