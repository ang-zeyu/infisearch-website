When smooth add the salt, baking powder and flour, mixed. Beat, and then fold in the well-beaten whites of eggs. Bake in gem pans in a quick oven a half hour.   Hominy Pone  1 cupful of boiled hominy 1 cupful of white corn meal 2 cupfuls of milk 2 level tablespoonfuls of butter 2 eggs 1/2 teaspoonful of salt  If the hominy is cold left-over hominy, add to it the milk, and when thoroughly smooth add the eggs, well beaten, then the butter, melted, and the corn meal. Pour into a greased pan and bake in a very hot oven about twenty to twenty-five minutes.   Oat Meal Muffins  The ordinary muffin recipes, which are always about alike, no matter what flour is used, may have added to them a cup of well-cooked oat meal; for instance, separate two eggs as for rice muffins; add to the yolks a cup of milk; then add one and a half cups of whole wheat flour; beat thoroughly; add a teaspoonful of baking powder; beat again; add one cup of well-cooked oat meal, or you may substitute wheatlet or any of the breakfast cereals; fold in the whites of the eggs, and bake in gem pans in a quick oven twenty to thirty minutes.   Sandwiches  Little bits of fruit, crisp pieces of celery, cold meats of all kinds, may be chopped, properly seasoned, and used for making fruit, vegetable and meat sandwiches.     VEGETABLES   String beans, cauliflower, carrots, beets, peas and even a cold boiled potato may all be cut into neat pieces, mixed together, and served on lettuce leaves, dressed with French dressing as a salad. One cold boiled beet may be used as a garnish for a potato salad. String beans, if you have sufficient quantity, may be served alone as a salad.   Stuffed Egg Plant  Throw a good-sized egg plant into a kettle of boiling water; boil ten minutes; when cold cut into halves and with a blunt knife scoop out the center. Chop this scooped-out portion fine, mix with it an equal quantity of finely-chopped uncooked meat, add a grated onion, a clove of garlic mashed, a teaspoonful of salt, a little chopped parsley, if you have it, and a dash of pepper. Fill this into the egg plant shells, stand them in a baking pan, add a cup of stock and a tablespoonful of butter, bake slowly one hour, basting every ten minutes.   Cucumbers  Raw cucumbers are easily wilted, and are then unfit for serving. Soak them in pure cold, unsalted water until serving time. Pass French dressing in a separate dish. In this way the \"left-overs\" may be placed in the refrigerator and used next day as an addition to the dinner salad.   Left-Over Tomatoes  A half cup of stewed tomatoes may be used with stock for brown tomato sauce, or for making a small dish of scalloped tomatoes, helping out at lunch when perhaps the family is less in number. The Italians boil down this half cup of tomatoes until it has the consistency of dough; then press through a sieve, add a little salt, pack down into a jelly tumbler and stand in the refrigerator to use as flavoring. A tablespoonful in a soup, or in an ordinary sauce, or mixed with the water for baked beans, or added to the stock sauce for spaghetti or macaroni, adds greatly to the flavor as well as appearance.   Corn Oysters  6 ears of cold boiled corn 2 eggs 1 cupful of milk 1/2 cupful of flour 1/2 teaspoonful of salt 1 saltspoonful of pepper  Score the corn, press it out, add the eggs, well beaten, and the oil or butter; then stir in the milk, salt and pepper. Sift the flour, stir it in, and drop by spoonfuls into shallow hot fat.   Chicken Corn Pie  6 ears of cold cooked corn 4 eggs 1 level tablespoonful of butter, melted 1 cupful of milk 1 teaspoonful of salt 1 saltspoonful of pepper 1 young chicken  Score the corn and with a dull knife press it out. Carefully beat the eggs, without separating, until light, add the milk, melted butter, salt and pepper. Pour this into a casserole mold or pudding dish. Have the chicken drawn and disjointed; make two pieces of the breast, cut it into four pieces, dust with salt and pepper, brush with melted butter. Lay the chicken on top of this mixture and stand the baking dish in a moderately quick oven about one hour. Serve in the dish in which it was cooked. Some prefer to broil the chicken on the bone side before they put it into the pudding, the pudding may be baked, and then put it in the pudding and brown it with the pudding. This is a good way to use cold left-over corn, and cold bits of chicken may be used in the place of the fresh chicken.   Green Corn Cakes  4 ears of left-over cooked corn 1 egg 2 tablespoonfuls of milk 1 tablespoonful of melted butter 1/2 cupful of flour 1/2 teaspoonful of salt  Score the corn, press out the cooked pulp, add to it the beaten egg, milk, melted butter and salt. Stir in the flour, and drop by tablespoonfuls into a little thoroughly heated fat.     FRUITS   Small quantities of fruit that are not sufficiently sightly to put again on the table may be put aside and made into fruit pot-pie. All sorts of fruits may be blended. Put them into a saucepan, and to each pint of this fruit allow one quart of water and a palatable seasoning of sugar, and you may flavor it with a little grated lemon or orange rind; bring to boiling point. During this time put one pint of flour into a bowl, add a half teaspoonful of salt and a teaspoonful of baking powder. Beat one egg until light, add to it a half cup of milk, then add this to the flour; there should be just enough to moisten and make a dough. Take this out on the board, knead lightly, roll out and cut into biscuits. Put these biscuits over the top of the fruit; cover the kettle and cook slowly for fifteen minutes; do not lift the lid during the cooking. Serve hot with plain milk or cream, or with a hard sauce made from sugar and butter.   Fruit Soufflé  Beat the whites of six eggs until light, but not dry; add three tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar; mix quickly; line the bottom of the baking dish with any sort of fruit, such as chopped dates or figs, or left-over candied fruits or preserves. Heap over the whites of the eggs, dust thickly with powdered sugar, and bake in a hot oven for five minutes. Serve immediately. To give variety, where stale biscuits or bread, or sponge cake are left over, line the bottom of the dish with the stale bits; pour over enough milk to moisten, put in a layer of fruit and the whites of the eggs as above.   Fruit Jambolaya  Put one cupful of cold boiled rice in a little sieve or colander and stand it over the tea kettle where the steam will pass through it. Chop fine any left-over fruit at hand, an apple, pear, plum, banana, and the pulp of an orange; they may be all mixed together and slightly sweetened. Put a little of the rice into four serving dishes, put in the center of each a tablespoonful of the chopped fruit and send to the table. This is rather nice for children, and is a good way to use up both the rice and the fruit, as it makes a good combination.   Plain White Cake  Beat a quarter of a cup of butter to a cream; add gradually one and a half cups of sugar. Sift two cups of flour with a teaspoonful of baking powder; measure a half pint of water; add a little water and a little flour, and so continue until the ingredients are used; beat thoroughly, then stir in the well-beaten whites of five eggs. Bake in a loaf or layers. Put layers together with chopped fruit, soft custard, or a soft icing.   Chicken Muffin Cases  Boil together a half pint of water and two tablespoonfuls of butter, add hastily a half pint of sifted flour, stir over fire until a smooth dough is formed. Take from the fire and when cool, add one unbeaten whole egg; beat, add another and so continue until four eggs have been added. Bake in gem pans until light and hollow, about a half hour. This quantity will make twelve. Cut a round from the top and fill the muffin with any creamed mixture.   To Make Cocoanut Milk  Cover one quart of grated cocoanut with one pint of boiling water. Stir and mash; strain and press. The milk thus produced may be used for curries. Throw away the pulp.     SOUR MILK AND CREAM   Corn Cake  2 eggs 1 cupful of thick sour milk 1 level teaspoonful of baking soda 2 cupfuls of corn meal 3/4 cupful of white flour 2 cupfuls of sweet milk 3 level teaspoonfuls of baking powder  Beat the eggs until very light, without separating. Moisten the soda in two tablespoonfuls of cold water, stir it into the cupful of sour milk; add this to the eggs, then add the meal and beat thoroughly. Sift the baking powder and flour; stir these into the other mixture, and then add the two cupfuls of sweet milk. Pour into a shallow greased pan and bake in a moderately quick oven about three-quarters of an hour. This should have a custard on top.   Sponge Corn Cake  1 cupful of corn meal 1/2 cupful of flour 1 cupful of thick sour milk 2 eggs 1 level tablespoonful of butter, melted 1/2 teaspoonful of salt 1/2 teaspoonful of baking soda  Moisten the soda in a tablespoonful of water and stir into the thick sour milk. Separate the eggs; beat the yolks, add the sour milk, with the butter, melted, corn meal and flour. Beat thoroughly, then fold in the well-beaten whites, add salt and bake in a shallow greased pan in a quick oven a half hour.   Old Virginia Batter Cakes  2 eggs 1 cupful of sour milk 1 cupful of water 2 cupfuls of white corn meal 1 cupful of flour 1/2 teaspoonful of salt 1 level teaspoonful of baking soda 1 teaspoonful of baking powder  Beat the eggs, without separating, until very, very light. Dissolve the soda in a little water, add it to the sour milk; stir until this is well mixed, add it to the egg; add the water, the corn meal, salt and flour sifted with the baking powder. Mix thoroughly and bake on a very lightly greased griddle.   Plain Corn Dodgers  1 egg 1/2 teaspoonful of salt 1 cupful of thick sour milk 1 level teaspoonful of baking soda 1 cupful of corn "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6978"],["title","Made-Over Dishes (#8)"],["body","1/2 cupful of flour  Beat the egg, without separating. Dissolve the soda and add it to the sour milk; add this to the egg; add the salt, then the corn meal and flour. Beat until well mixed, and drop by spoonfuls in a shallow pan in which you have a little bacon or ham fat.  When cooked on one side, turn quickly and cook on the other.
