I shall consider what is best to do.  MARY. Sir, you shall know its import. In this letter I beg a favor, a great favor of her,-- That she herself will give me audience,--she Whom I have never seen. I have been summoned Before a court of men, whom I can ne'er Acknowledge as my peers--of men to whom My heart denies its confidence. The queen Is of my family, my rank, my sex; To her alone--a sister, queen, and woman-- Can I unfold my heart.  PAULET.             Too oft, my lady, Have you intrusted both your fate and honor To men less worthy your esteem than these.  MARY. I, in the letter, beg another favor, And surely naught but inhumanity Can here reject my prayer. These many years Have I, in prison, missed the church's comfort, The blessings of the sacraments--and she Who robs me of my freedom and my crown, Who seeks my very life, can never wish To shut the gates of heaven upon my soul.  PAULET. Whene'er you wish, the dean shall wait upon you.  MARY (interrupting him sharply). Talk to me not of deans. I ask the aid Of one of my own church--a Catholic priest.  PAULET. [That is against the published laws of England.  MARY. The laws of England are no rule for me. I am not England's subject; I have ne'er Consented to its laws, and will not bow Before their cruel and despotic sway. If 'tis your will, to the unheard-of rigor Which I have borne, to add this new oppression, I must submit to what your power ordains; Yet will I raise my voice in loud complaints.] I also wish a public notary, And secretaries, to prepare my will-- My sorrows and my prison's wretchedness Prey on my life--my days, I fear, are numbered-- I feel that I am near the gates of death.  PAULET. These serious contemplations well become you.  MARY. And know I then that some too ready hand May not abridge this tedious work of sorrow? I would indite my will and make disposal Of what belongs to me.  PAULET.             This liberty May be allowed to you, for England's queen Will not enrich herself by plundering you.  MARY. I have been parted from my faithful women, And from my servants; tell me, where are they? What is their fate? I can indeed dispense At present with their service, but my heart Will feel rejoiced to know these faithful ones Are not exposed to suffering and to want!  PAULET. Your servants have been cared for; [and again You shall behold whate'er is taken from you And all shall be restored in proper season.]                   [Going.  MARY. And will you leave my presence thus again, And not relieve my fearful, anxious heart From the fell torments of uncertainty? Thanks to the vigilance of your hateful spies, I am divided from the world; no voice Can reach me through these prison-walls; my fate Lies in the hands of those who wish my ruin. A month of dread suspense is passed already Since when the forty high commissioners Surprised me in this castle, and erected, With most unseemly haste, their dread tribunal; They forced me, stunned, amazed, and unprepared, Without an advocate, from memory, Before their unexampled court, to answer Their weighty charges, artfully arranged. They came like ghosts,--like ghosts they disappeared, And since that day all mouths are closed to me. In vain I seek to construe from your looks Which hath prevailed--my cause's innocence And my friends' zeal--or my foes' cursed counsel. Oh, break this silence! let me know the worst; What have I still to fear, and what to hope.  PAULET. Close your accounts with heaven.  MARY.                  From heaven I hope For mercy, sir; and from my earthly judges I hope, and still expect, the strictest justice.  PAULET. Justice, depend upon it, will be done you.  MARY. Is the suit ended, sir?  PAULET.              I cannot tell.  MARY. Am I condemned?  PAULET.          I cannot answer, lady.  MARY. [Sir, a good work fears not the light of day.  PAULET. The day will shine upon it, doubt it not.]  MARY. Despatch is here the fashion. Is it meant The murderer shall surprise me, like the judges?  PAULET. Still entertain that thought and he will find you Better prepared to meet your fate than they did.  MARY (after a pause). Sir, nothing can surprise me which a court Inspired by Burleigh's hate and Hatton's zeal, Howe'er unjust, may venture to pronounce: But I have yet to learn how far the queen Will dare in execution of the sentence.  PAULET. The sovereigns of England have no fear But for their conscience and their parliament. What justice hath decreed her fearless hand Will execute before the assembled world.    SCENE III.     The same. MORTIMER enters, and without paying attention    to the QUEEN, addresses PAULET.  MORTIMER. Uncle, you're sought for.     [He retires in the same manner. The QUEEN remarks it, and    turns towards PAULET, who is about to follow him.  MARY.               Sir, one favor more If you have aught to say to me--from you I can bear much--I reverence your gray hairs; But cannot bear that young man's insolence; Spare me in future his unmannered rudeness.  PAULET. I prize him most for that which makes you hate him He is not, truly, one of those poor fools Who melt before a woman's treacherous tears. He has seen much--has been to Rheims and Paris, And brings us back his true old English heart. Lady, your cunning arts are lost on him.                     [Exit.    SCENE IV.     MARY, KENNEDY.  KENNEDY. And dare the ruffian venture to your face Such language! Oh, 'tis hard--'tis past endurance.  MARY (lost in reflection). In the fair moments of our former splendor We lent to flatterers a too willing ear;-- It is but just, good Hannah, we should now Be forced to hear the bitter voice of censure.  KENNEDY. So downcast, so depressed, my dearest lady! You, who before so gay, so full of hope, Were used to comfort me in my distress; More gracious were the task to check your mirth Than chide your heavy sadness.  MARY.                 Well I know him-- It is the bleeding Darnley's royal shade, Rising in anger from his darksome grave And never will he make his peace with me Until the measures of my woes be full.  KENNEDY. What thoughts are these--  MARY.              Thou may'st forget it, Hannah; But I've a faithful memory--'tis this day Another wretched anniversary Of that regretted, that unhappy deed-- Which I must celebrate with fast and penance.  KENNEDY. Dismiss at length in peace this evil spirit. The penitence of many a heavy year, Of many a suffering, has atoned the deed; The church, which holds the key of absolution, Pardons the crime, and heaven itself's appeased.  MARY. This long-atoned crime arises fresh And bleeding from its lightly-covered grave; My husband's restless spirit seeks revenge; No sacred bell can exorcise, no host In priestly hands dismiss it to his tomb.  KENNEDY. You did not murder him; 'twas done by others.  MARY. But it was known to me; I suffered it, And lured him with my smiles to death's embrace.  KENNEDY. Your youth extenuates your guilt. You were Of tender years.  MARY.          So tender, yet I drew This heavy guilt upon my youthful head.  KENNEDY. You were provoked by direst injuries, And by the rude presumption of the man, Whom out of darkness, like the hand of heaven, Your love drew forth, and raised above all others. Whom through your bridal chamber you conducted Up to your throne, and with your lovely self, And your hereditary crown, distinguished [Your work was his existence, and your grace Bedewed him like the gentle rains of heaven.] Could he forget that his so splendid lot Was the creation of your generous love? Yet did he, worthless as he was, forget it. With base suspicions, and with brutal manners, He wearied your affections, and became An object to you of deserved disgust: The illusion, which till now had overcast Your judgment, vanished; angrily you fled His foul embrace, and gave him up to scorn. And did he seek again to win your love? Your favor? Did he e'er implore your pardon? Or fall in deep repentance at your feet? No; the base wretch defied you; he, who was Your bounty's creature, wished to play your king, [And strove, through fear, to force your inclination.] Before your eyes he had your favorite singer, Poor Rizzio, murdered; you did but avenge With blood the bloody deed----  MARY.                And bloodily, I fear, too soon 'twill be avenged on me: You seek to comfort me, and you condemn me.  KENNEDY. You were, when you consented to this deed, No more yourself; belonged not to yourself; The madness of a frantic love possessed you, And bound you to a terrible seducer, The wretched Bothwell. That despotic man Ruled you with shameful, overbearing will, And with his philters and his hellish arts Inflamed your passions.  MARY.              All the arts he used Were man's superior strength and woman's weakness.  KENNEDY. No, no, I say. The most pernicious spirits Of hell he must have summoned to his aid, To cast this mist before your waking senses. Your ear no more was open to the voice Of friendly warning, and your eyes were shut To decency; soft female bashfulness Deserted you; those cheeks, which were before The seat of virtuous, blushing modesty, Glowed with the flames of unrestrained desire. You cast away the veil of secrecy, And the flagitious daring of the man O'ercame your natural coyness: you exposed Your shame, unblushingly, to public gaze: You let the murderer, whom the people followed With curses, through the streets of Edinburgh, Before you bear the royal sword of Scotland In triumph. You begirt your parliament With armed bands; and by this shameless farce, There, in the very temple of great justice, You forced the judges of the land to clear The murderer of his guilt. You went still further-- O God!  MARY.     Conclude--nay, pause not--say for this I gave my hand in marriage at the altar.  KENNEDY. O let an everlasting silence veil That dreadful deed: the heart revolts at it. A crime to stain the darkest criminal! Yet you are no such lost "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6791"],["title","Mary Stuart: A Tragedy (#2)"],["body","one, that I know. I nursed your youth myself--your heart is framed For tender softness: 'tis alive to shame, And all your fault is thoughtless levity. Yes, I repeat it, there are evil spirits, Who sudden fix in man's unguarded breast Their fatal residence, and there delight To act their dev'lish deeds; then hurry back Unto their native hell, and leave behind Remorse and horror in the poisoned bosom. Since this misdeed, which blackens thus your life, You have done nothing ill; your conduct has Been pure; myself can witness your amendment. Take courage, then; with your own heart make peace. Whatever cause you have for penitence, You are not guilty here. Nor England's queen, Nor England's parliament can be your judge. Here might oppresses you: you may present Yourself before this self-created court With all the fortitude of innocence.  MARY. I hear a step.  KENNEDY.         It is the nephew--In.    SCENE V.     The same. Enter MORTIMER, approaching cautiously.  MORTIMER (to KENNEDY). Step to the door, and keep a careful watch, I have important business with the queen.  MARY (with dignity). I charge thee, Hannah, go not hence--remain.  MORTIMER. Fear not, my gracious lady--learn to know me.     [He gives her a card.  MARY (She examines it, and starts back astonished). Heavens! What is this?  MORTIMER (to KENNEDY).              Retire, good Kennedy; See that my uncle comes not unawares.  MARY (to KENNEDY, who hesitates, and looks at the QUEEN inquiringly). Go in; do as he bids you.     [KENNEDY retires with signs of wonder.    SCENE VI.     MARY, MORTIMER.  MARY.               From my uncle In France--the worthy Cardinal of Lorrain?     [She reads.  \"Confide in Mortimer, who brings you this; You have no truer, firmer friend in England.\"     [Looking at him with astonishment.  Can I believe it? Is there no delusion To cheat my senses? Do I find a friend So near, when I conceived myself abandoned By the whole world? And find that friend in you, The nephew of my gaoler, whom I thought My most inveterate enemy?  MORTIMER (kneeling).               Oh, pardon, My gracious liege, for the detested mask, Which it has cost me pain enough to wear; Yet through such means alone have I the power To see you, and to bring you help and rescue.  MARY. Arise, sir; you astonish me; I cannot So suddenly emerge from the abyss Of wretchedness to hope: let me conceive This happiness, that I may credit it.  MORTIMER. Our time is brief: each moment I expect My uncle, whom a hated man attends; Hear, then, before his terrible commission Surprises you, how heaven prepares your rescue.  MARY. You come in token of its wondrous power.  MORTIMER. Allow me of myself to speak.  MARY.                Say on.  MORTIMER. I scarce, my liege, had numbered twenty years, Trained in the path of strictest discipline And nursed in deadliest hate to papacy, When led by irresistible desire For foreign travel, I resolved to leave My country and its puritanic faith Far, far behind me: soon with rapid speed I flew through France, and bent my eager course On to the plains of far-famed Italy. 'Twas then the time of the great jubilee: And crowds of palmers filled the public roads; Each image was adorned with garlands; 'twas As if all human-kind were wandering forth In pilgrimage towards the heavenly kingdom. The tide of the believing multitude Bore me too onward, with resistless force, Into the streets of Rome. What was my wonder, As the magnificence of stately columns Rushed on my sight! the vast triumphal arches, The Colosseum's grandeur, with amazement Struck my admiring senses; the sublime Creative spirit held my soul a prisoner In the fair world of wonders it had framed. I ne'er had felt the power of art till now. The church that reared me hates the charms of sense; It tolerates no image, it adores But the unseen, the incorporeal word. What were my feelings, then, as I approached The threshold of the churches, and within, Heard heavenly music floating in the air: While from the walls and high-wrought roofs there streamed Crowds of celestial forms in endless train-- When the Most High, Most Glorious pervaded My captivated sense in real presence! And when I saw the great and godlike visions, The Salutation, the Nativity, The Holy Mother, and the Trinity's Descent, the luminous transfiguration And last the holy pontiff, clad in all The glory of his office, bless the people! Oh! what is all the pomp of gold and jewels With which the kings of earth adorn themselves! He is alone surrounded by the Godhead; His mansion is in truth an heavenly kingdom, For not of earthly moulding are these forms!  MARY. O spare me, sir! No further. Spread no more Life's verdant carpet out before my eyes, Remember I am wretched, and a prisoner.  MORTIMER. I was a prisoner, too, my queen; but swift My prison-gates flew open, when at once My spirit felt its liberty, and hailed The smiling dawn of life. I learned to burst Each narrow prejudice of education, To crown my brow with never-fading wreaths, And mix my joy with the rejoicing crowd. Full many noble Scots, who saw my zeal, Encouraged me, and with the gallant French They kindly led me to your princely uncle, The Cardinal of Guise. Oh, what a man! How firm, how clear, how manly, and how great! Born to control the human mind at will! The very model of a royal priest; A ruler of the church without an equal!  MARY. You've seen him then,--the much loved, honored man, Who was the guardian of my tender years! Oh, speak of him! Does he remember me? Does fortune favor him? And prospers still His life? And does he still majestic stand, A very rock and pillar of the church?  MORTIMER. The holy man descended from his height, And deigned to teach me the important creed Of the true church, and dissipate my doubts. He showed me how the glimmering light of reason Serves but to lead us to eternal error: That what the heart is called on to believe The eye must see: that he who rules the church Must needs be visible; and that the spirit Of truth inspired the councils of the fathers. How vanished then the fond imaginings And weak conceptions of my childish soul Before his conquering judgment, and the soft Persuasion of his tongue! So I returned Back to the bosom of the holy church, And at his feet abjured my heresies.  MARY. Then of those happy thousands you are one, Whom he, with his celestial eloquence, Like the immortal preacher of the mount, Has turned and led to everlasting joy!  MORTIMER. The duties of his office called him soon To France, and I was sent by him to Rheims, Where, by the Jesuits' anxious labor, priests Are trained to preach our holy faith in England. There, 'mongst the Scots, I found the noble Morgan, And your true Lesley, Ross's learned bishop, Who pass in France their joyless days of exile. I joined with heartfelt zeal these worthy men, And fortified my faith. As I one day Roamed through the bishop's dwelling, I was struck With a fair female portrait; it was full Of touching wond'rous charms; with magic might It moved my inmost soul, and there I stood Speechless, and overmastered by my feelings. \"Well,\" cried the bishop, \"may you linger thus In deep emotion near this lovely face! For the most beautiful of womankind, Is also matchless in calamity. She is a prisoner for our holy faith, And in your native land, alas! she suffers.\"     [MARY is in great agitation. He pauses.  MARY. Excellent man! All is not lost, indeed, While such a friend remains in my misfortunes!  MORTIMER. Then he began, with moving eloquence, To paint the sufferings of your martyrdom; He showed me then your lofty pedigree, And your descent from Tudor's royal house. He proved to me that you alone have right To reign in England, not this upstart queen, The base-born fruit of an adult'rous bed, Whom Henry's self rejected as a bastard. [He from my eyes removed delusion's mist, And taught me to lament you as a victim, To honor you as my true queen, whom I, Deceived, like thousands of my noble fellows, Had ever hated as my country's foe.] I would not trust his evidence alone; I questioned learned doctors; I consulted The most authentic books of heraldry; And every man of knowledge whom I asked Confirmed to me your claim's validity. And now I know that your undoubted right To England's throne has been your only wrong, This realm is justly yours by heritage, In which you innocently pine as prisoner.  MARY. Oh, this unhappy right!--'tis this alone Which is the source of all my sufferings.  MORTIMER. Just at this time the tidings reached my ears Of your removal from old Talbot's charge, And your committal to my uncle's care. It seemed to me that this disposal marked The wond'rous, outstretched hand of favoring heaven; It seemed to be a loud decree of fate, That it had chosen me to rescue you. My friends concur with me; the cardinal Bestows on me his counsel and his blessing, And tutors me in the hard task of feigning. The plan in haste digested, I commenced My journey homewards, and ten days ago On England's shores I landed. Oh, my queen.     [He pauses.  I saw then, not your picture, but yourself-- Oh, what a treasure do these walls enclose! No prison this, but the abode of gods, More splendid far than England's royal court. Happy, thrice happy he, whose envied lot Permits to breathe the selfsame air with you! It is a prudent policy in her To bury you so deep! All England's youth Would rise at once in general mutiny, And not a sword lie quiet in its sheath: Rebellion would uprear its giant head, Through all this peaceful isle, if Britons once Beheld their captive queen.  MARY.                'Twere well with her, If every Briton saw her with your eyes!  MORTIMER. Were each, like me, a witness of your wrongs, Your meekness, and the noble fortitude With which you suffer these indignities-- Would you not then emerge from all these trials Like a true queen? Your prison's infamy, Hath it despoiled your beauty of its charms? You are deprived of all that graces life, Yet round"]]]
