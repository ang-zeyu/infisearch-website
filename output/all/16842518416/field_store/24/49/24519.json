Whom should it more concern?  FURST. No, Melchthal, no; thou art my guest, and I Must answer for thy safety.  MELCHTHAL.                Let me go. I know each forest track and mountain pass; Friends too I'll find, be sure, on every hand, To give me willing shelter from the foe.  STAUFFACHER. Nay, let him go; no traitors harbor there: For tyranny is so abhorred in Unterwald No minions can be found to work her will. In the low valleys, too, the Alzeller Will gain confederates and rouse the country.  MELCHTHAL. But how shall we communicate, and not Awaken the suspicion of the tyrants?  STAUFFACHER. Might we not meet at Brunnen or at Treib, Hard by the spot where merchant-vessels land?  FURST. We must not go so openly to work. Hear my opinion. On the lake's left bank, As we sail hence to Brunnen, right against The Mytenstein, deep-hidden in the wood A meadow lies, by shepherds called the Rootli, Because the wood has been uprooted there. 'Tis where our Canton boundaries verge on yours;--     [To MELCHTHAL.  Your boat will carry you across from Schwytz.     [To STAUFFACHER.  Thither by lonely by-paths let us wend At midnight and deliberate o'er our plans. Let each bring with him there ten trusty men, All one at heart with us; and then we may Consult together for the general weal, And, with God's guidance, fix our onward course.  STAUFFACHER. So let it be. And now your true right hand! Yours, too, young man! and as we now three men Among ourselves thus knit our hands together In all sincerity and truth, e'en so Shall we three Cantons, too, together stand In victory and defeat, in life and death.  FURST and MELCHTHAL. In life and death.    [They hold their hands clasped together for some moments in silence.  MELCHTHAL.           Alas, my old blind father! Thou canst no more behold the day of freedom; But thou shalt hear it. When from Alp to Alp The beacon-fires throw up their flaming signs, And the proud castles of the tyrants fall, Into thy cottage shall the Switzer burst, Bear the glad tidings to thine ear, and o'er Thy darkened way shall Freedom's radiance pour.     ACT II.  SCENE I.     The Mansion of the BARON OF ATTINGHAUSEN. A Gothic hall,    decorated with escutcheons and helmets. The BARON, a    gray-headed man, eighty-five years old, tall, and of a    commanding mien, clad in a furred pelisse, and leaning    on a staff tipped with chamois horn. KUONI and six hinds    standing round him, with rakes and scythes. ULRICH OF RUDENZ    enters in the costume of a knight.  RUDENZ. Uncle, I'm here! Your will?  ATTINGHAUSEN.                First let me share, After the ancient custom of our house, The morning-cup with these my faithful servants!     [He drinks from a cup, which is then passed round.  Time was I stood myself in field and wood, With mine own eyes directing all their toil, Even as my banner led them in the fight, Now I am only fit to play the steward; And, if the genial sun come not to me, I can no longer seek it on the mountains. Thus slowly, in an ever-narrowing sphere, I move on to the narrowest and the last, Where all life's pulses cease. I now am but The shadow of my former self, and that Is fading fast--'twill soon be but a name.  KUONI (offering RUDENZ the cup). A pledge, young master!    [RUDENZ hesitates to take the cup.              Nay, sir, drink it off! One cup, one heart! You know our proverb, sir!  ATTINGHAUSEN. Go, children, and at eve, when work is done, We'll meet and talk the country's business over.                   [Exeunt Servants.  Belted and plumed, and all thy bravery on! Thou art for Altdorf--for the castle, boy?  RUDENZ. Yes, uncle. Longer may I not delay----  ATTINGHAUSEN (sitting down). Why in such haste? Say, are thy youthful hours Doled in such niggard measure that thou must Be chary of then to thy aged uncle?  RUDENZ. I see, my presence is not needed here, I am but as a stranger in this house.  ATTINGHAUSEN (gazes fixedly at him for a considerable time). Alas, thou art indeed! Alas, that home To thee has grown so strange! Oh, Uly! Uly! I scarce do know thee now, thus decked in silks, The peacock's feather [9] flaunting in thy cap, And purple mantle round thy shoulders flung; Thou lookest upon the peasant with disdain, And takest with a blush his honest greeting.  RUDENZ. All honor due to him I gladly pay, But must deny the right he would usurp.  ATTINGHAUSEN. The sore displeasure of the king is resting Upon the land, and every true man's heart Is full of sadness for the grievous wrongs We suffer from our tyrants. Thou alone Art all unmoved amid the general grief. Abandoning thy friends, thou takest thy stand Beside thy country's foes, and, as in scorn Of our distress, pursuest giddy joys, Courting the smiles of princes, all the while Thy country bleeds beneath their cruel scourge.  RUDENZ. The land is sore oppressed; I know it, uncle. But why? Who plunged it into this distress? A word, one little easy word, might buy Instant deliverance from such dire oppression, And win the good-will of the emperor. Woe unto those who seal the people's eyes, And make them adverse to their country's good; The men who, for their own vile, selfish ends, Are seeking to prevent the Forest States From swearing fealty to Austria's house, As all the countries round about have done. It fits their humor well, to take their seats Amid the nobles on the Herrenbank; [10] They'll have the Caesar for their lord, forsooth, That is to say, they'll have no lord at all.  ATTINGHAUSEN. Must I hear this, and from thy lips, rash boy!  RUDENZ. You urged me to this answer. Hear me out. What, uncle, is the character you've stooped To fill contentedly through life? Have you No higher pride, than in these lonely wilds To be the Landamman or Banneret, [11] The petty chieftain of a shepherd race? How! Were it not a far more glorious choice To bend in homage to our royal lord, And swell the princely splendors of his court, Than sit at home, the peer of your own vassals, And share the judgment-seat with vulgar clowns?  ATTINGHAUSEN. Ah, Uly, Uly; all too well I see, The tempter's voice has caught thy willing ear, And poured its subtle poison in thy heart.  RUDENZ. Yes, I conceal it not. It doth offend My inmost soul to hear the stranger's gibes, That taunt us with the name of \"Peasant Nobles.\" Think you the heart that's stirring here can brook, While all the young nobility around Are reaping honor under Hapsburg's banner, That I should loiter, in inglorious ease, Here on the heritage my fathers left, And, in the dull routine of vulgar toil, Lose all life's glorious spring? In other lands Deeds are achieved. A world of fair renown Beyond these mountains stirs in martial pomp. My helm and shield are rusting in the hall; The martial trumpet's spirit-stirring blast, The herald's call, inviting to the lists, Rouse not the echoes of these vales, where naught Save cowherd's horn and cattle-bell is heard, In one unvarying, dull monotony.  ATTINGHAUSEN. Deluded boy, seduced by empty show! Despise the land that gave thee birth! Ashamed Of the good ancient customs of thy sires! The day will come, when thou, with burning tears, Wilt long for home, and for thy native hills, And that dear melody of tuneful herds, Which now, in proud disgust, thou dost despise! A day when thou wilt drink its tones in sadness, Hearing their music in a foreign land. Oh! potent is the spell that binds to home! No, no, the cold, false world is not for thee. At the proud court, with thy true heart thou wilt Forever feel a stranger among strangers. The world asks virtues of far other stamp Than thou hast learned within these simple vales. But go--go thither; barter thy free soul, Take land in fief, become a prince's vassal, Where thou might'st be lord paramount, and prince Of all thine own unburdened heritage! O, Uly, Uly, stay among thy people! Go not to Altdorf. Oh, abandon not The sacred cause of thy wronged native land! I am the last of all my race. My name Ends with me. Yonder hang my helm and shield; They will be buried with me in the grave. [12] And must I think, when yielding up my breath, That thou but wait'st the closing of mine eyes, To stoop thy knee to this new feudal court, And take in vassalage from Austria's hands The noble lands, which I from God received Free and unfettered as the mountain air!  RUDENZ. 'Tis vain for us to strive against the king. The world pertains to him:--shall we alone, In mad, presumptuous obstinacy strive To break that mighty chain of lands, which he Hath drawn around us with his giant grasp. His are the markets, his the courts; his too The highways; nay, the very carrier's horse, That traffics on the Gotthardt, pays him toll. By his dominions, as within a net, We are enclosed, and girded round about. --And will the empire shield us? Say, can it Protect itself 'gainst Austria's growing power? To God, and not to emperors, must we look! What store can on their promises be placed, When they, to meet their own necessities, Can pawn, and even alienate the towns That flee for shelter 'neath the eagle's wings? [13] No, uncle. It is wise and wholesome prudence, In times like these, when faction's all abroad, To own attachment to some mighty chief. The imperial crown's transferred from line to line, [14] It has no memory for faithful service: But to secure the favor of these great Hereditary masters, were to sow Seed for a future harvest.  ATTINGHAUSEN.               Art so wise? Wilt thou see clearer than thy noble sires, Who battled for fair freedom's costly gem, With life, and fortune, and heroic arm? Sail down the lake to Lucerne, there inquire, How Austria's rule doth weigh the Cantons down. Soon she will come to count our sheep, our cattle, To portion out the Alps, e'en to their summits, And in our own free woods to hinder us From striking down the eagle or the stag; To set her tolls on every bridge and gate,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6788"],["title","Wilhelm Tell (#5)"],["body","us to swell her lust of sway, And drain our dearest blood to feed her wars. No, if our blood must flow, let it be shed In our own cause! We purchase liberty More cheaply far than bondage.  RUDENZ.                  What can we, A shepherd race, against great Albert's hosts?  ATTINGHAUSEN. Learn, foolish boy, to know this shepherd race! I know them, I have led them on in fight-- I saw them in the battle at Favenz. Austria will try, forsooth, to force on us A yoke we are determined not to bear! Oh, learn to feel from what a race thou'rt sprung! Cast not, for tinsel trash and idle show, The precious jewel of thy worth away. To be the chieftain of a freeborn race, Bound to thee only by their unbought love, Ready to stand--to fight--to die with thee, Be that thy pride, be that thy noblest boast! Knit to thy heart the ties of kindred--home-- Cling to the land, the dear land of thy sires, Grapple to that with thy whole heart and soul! Thy power is rooted deep and strongly here, But in yon stranger world thou'lt stand alone, A trembling reed beat down by every blast. Oh come! 'tis long since we have seen thee, Uly! Tarry but this one day. Only to-day Go not to Altdorf. Wilt thou? Not to-day! For this one day bestow thee on thy friends.     [Takes his hand.  RUDENZ. I gave my word. Unhand me! I am bound.  ATTINGHAUSEN (drops his hand and says sternly). Bound, didst thou say? Oh yes, unhappy boy, Thou art, indeed. But not by word or oath. 'Tis by the silken mesh of love thou'rt bound.     [RUDENZ turns away.  Ay, hide thee, as thou wilt. 'Tis she, I know, Bertha of Bruneck, draws thee to the court; 'Tis she that chains thee to the emperor's service. Thou think'st to win the noble, knightly maid, By thy apostacy. Be not deceived. She is held out before thee as a lure; But never meant for innocence like thine.  RUDENZ. No more; I've heard enough. So fare you well.                     [Exit.  ATTINGHAUSEN. Stay, Uly! Stay! Rash boy, he's gone! I can Nor hold him back, nor save him from destruction. And so the Wolfshot has deserted us;-- Others will follow his example soon. This foreign witchery, sweeping o'er our hills, Tears with its potent spell our youth away: O luckless hour, when men and manners strange Into these calm and happy valleys came, To warp our primitive and guileless ways. The new is pressing on with might. The old, The good, the simple, fleeteth fast away. New times come on. A race is springing up, That think not as their fathers thought before! What do I here? All, all are in the grave With whom ere while I moved and held converse; My age has long been laid beneath the sod: Happy the man who may not live to see What shall be done by those that follow me!    SCENE II.     A meadow surrounded by high rocks and wooded ground. On the    rocks are tracks, with rails and ladders, by which the peasants    are afterwards seen descending. In the background the lake is    observed, and over it a moon rainbow in the early part of the scene.    The prospect is closed by lofty mountains, with glaciers rising    behind them. The stage is dark, but the lake and glaciers glisten    in the moonlight.     MELCHTHAL, BAUMGARTEN, WINKELRIED, MEYER VON SARNEN, BURKHART AM    BUHEL, ARNOLD VON SEWA, KLAUS VON DER FLUE, and four other peasants,    all armed.  MELCHTHAL (behind the scenes). The mountain pass is open. Follow me I see the rock, and little cross upon it: This is the spot; here is the Rootli.     [They enter with torches.  WINKELRIED.                     Hark!  SEWA. The coast is clear.  MEYER.            None of our comrades come? We are the first, we Unterwaldeners.  MELCHTHAL. How far is't in the night?  BAUMGARTEN.                The beacon watch Upon the Selisberg has just called two.     [A bell is heard at a distance.  MEYER. Hush! Hark!  BUHEL.        The forest chapel's matin bell Chimes clearly o'er the lake from Switzerland.  FLUE. The air is clear, and bears the sound so far.  MELCHTHAL. Go, you and you, and light some broken boughs, Let's bid them welcome with a cheerful blaze.                 [Two peasants exeunt.  SEWA. The moon shines fair to-night. Beneath its beams The lake reposes, bright as burnished steel.  BUHEL. They'll have an easy passage.  WINKELRIED (pointing to the lake).                   Ha! look there! See you nothing?  MEYER.          What is it? Ay, indeed! A rainbow in the middle of the night.  MELCHTHAL. Formed by the bright reflection of the moon!  FLUE. A sign most strange and wonderful, indeed! Many there be who ne'er have seen the like.  SEWA. 'Tis doubled, see, a paler one above!  BAUMGARTEN. A boat is gliding yonder right beneath it.  MELCHTHAL. That must be Werner Stauffacher! I knew The worthy patriot would not tarry long.     [Goes with BAUMGARTEN towards the shore.  MEYER. The Uri men are like to be the last.  BUHEL. They're forced to take a winding circuit through The mountains; for the viceroy's spies are out.     [In the meanwhile the two peasants have kindled a fire    in the centre of the stage.  MELCHTHAL (on the shore). Who's there? The word?  STAUFFACHER (from below).              Friends of the country.     [All retire up the stage, towards the party landing from the boat.    Enter STAUFFACHER, ITEL, REDING, HANS AUF DER MAUER, JORG IM HOPE,    CONRAD HUNN, ULRICH DER SCHMIDT, JOST VON WEILER, and three other    peasants, armed.  ALL.                           Welcome!     [While the rest remain behind exchanging greetings, MELCHTHAL comes    forward with STAUFFACHER.  MELCHTHAL. Oh, worthy Stauffacher, I've looked but now On him, who could not look on me again. I've laid my hands upon his rayless eyes, And on their vacant orbits sworn a vow Of vengeance, only to be cooled in blood.  STAUFFACHER. Speak not of vengeance. We are here to meet The threatened evil, not to avenge the past. Now tell me what you've done, and what secured, To aid the common cause in Unterwald. How stands the peasantry disposed, and how Yourself escaped the wiles of treachery?  MELCHTHAL. Through the Surenen's fearful mountain chain, Where dreary ice-fields stretch on every side, And sound is none, save the hoarse vulture's cry, I reached the Alpine pasture, where the herds From Uri and from Engelberg resort, And turn their cattle forth to graze in common. Still as I went along, I slaked my thirst With the coarse oozings of the lofty glacier, That through the crevices come foaming down, And turned to rest me in the herdsman's cots, [15] Where I was host and guest, until I gained The cheerful homes and social haunts of men. Already through these distant vales had spread The rumor of this last atrocity; And wheresoe'er I went, at every door, Kind words and gentle looks were there to greet me. I found these simple spirits all in arms Against our rulers' tyrannous encroachments. For as their Alps through each succeeding year Yield the same roots,--their streams flow ever on In the same channels,--nay, the clouds and winds The selfsame course unalterably pursue, So have old customs there, from sire to son, Been handed down, unchanging and unchanged; Nor will they brook to swerve or turn aside From the fixed, even tenor of their life. With grasp of their hard hands they welcomed me-- Took from the walls their rusty falchions down-- And from their eyes the soul of valor flashed With joyful lustre, as I spoke those names, Sacred to every peasant in the mountains, Your own and Walter Fuerst's. Whate'er your voice Should dictate as the right they swore to do; And you they swore to follow e'en to death. So sped I on from house to house, secure In the guest's sacred privilege--and when I reached at last the valley of my home, Where dwell my kinsmen, scattered far and near-- And when I found my father stripped and blind, Upon the stranger's straw, fed by the alms Of charity----  STAUFFACHER.        Great heaven!  MELCHTHAL.                Yet wept I not! No--not in weak and unavailing tears Spent I the force of my fierce, burning anguish; Deep in my bosom, like some precious treasure, I locked it fast, and thought on deeds alone. Through every winding of the hills I crept-- No valley so remote but I explored it; Nay, even at the glacier's ice-clad base, I sought and found the homes of living men; And still, where'er my wandering footsteps turned, The self-same hatred of these tyrants met me. For even there, at vegetation's verge, Where the numbed earth is barren of all fruits, There grasping hands had been stretched forth for plunder. Into the hearts of all this honest race, The story of my wrongs struck deep, and now They to a man are ours; both heart and hand. Great things, indeed, you've wrought in little time.  MELCHTHAL. I did still more than this. The fortresses, Rossberg and Sarnen, are the country's dread; For from behind their rocky walls the foe Swoops, as the eagle from his eyrie, down, And, safe himself, spreads havoc o'er the land. With my own eyes I wished to weigh its strength, So went to Sarnen, and explored the castle.  STAUFFACHER. How! Risk thyself even in the tiger's den?  MELCHTHAL. Disguised in pilgrim's weeds I entered it; I saw the viceroy feasting at his board-- Judge if I'm master of myself or no! I saw the tyrant, and I slew him not!  STAUFFACHER. Fortune, indeed, has smiled upon your boldness.     [Meanwhile the others have arrived and join MELCHTHAL    and STAUFFACHER.  Yet tell me now, I pray, who are the friends, The worthy men, who came along with you? Make me acquainted with them, that we may Speak frankly, man to man, and heart to heart.  MEYER. In the three Cantons, who, sir, knows not you? Meyer of Sarnen is my name; and this Is Struth of Winkelried, my sister's son.  STAUFFACHER. No unknown name. A Winkelried it was Who slew the dragoon in the fen at Weiler, And lost his life in the encounter, too.  WINKELRIED. That, Master Stauffacher, was my grandfather.  MELCHTHAL (pointing to two peasants). These two are men belonging to the convent Of Engelberg, and"]]]
