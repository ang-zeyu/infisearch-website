We have got to go over to the Erie Basin now and tell Captain Hazzard about the recovery of his papers. Billy can come along if he wants and we will state his case for him, it will take three boys to manage that sledge anyway,\" went on Frank, warming up to the new plan. \"I think we can promise you to fix it somehow, Billy.\"  \"You think you can,\" burst out the delighted reporter, \"oh, Frank, if you do, I'll--I'll make you famous. I'll write you up as the discoverer of the ship of Olaf and--\"  \"That's enough,\" suddenly interrupted Frank, \"if you want to do me a favor, Billy, never mention any more about that till Captain Hazzard himself decides to tell us about it. We only let what we know of the secret slip out by accident and we have no right to speculate on what Captain Hazzard evidently wishes kept a mystery till the time comes to reveal it.\"  \"I'm sorry, Frank,\" contritely said Billy, \"I won't speak any more about it; but,\" he added to himself, \"you can't keep me from thinking about it.\"  As Frank had anticipated, Captain Hazzard agreed to ship Billy Barnes as a member of the expedition. He was to be a sort of general secretary and assist the boys with the aeroplane and motor sledge when the time came. The reporter's face, when after a brief conference it was announced to him that he might consider himself one of the Southern Cross's ship's company, was a study. It was all he could do to keep from shouting at the top of his voice. The contrast between the dignity he felt he ought to assume before Captain Hazzard and the desire he felt to skip about and express his feelings in some active way produced such a ludicrous mixture of emotions on Billy's face that both the boys and the captain himself had to burst into uncontrollable laughter at it. Laughter in which the good natured Billy, without exactly understanding its cause, heartily joined.  A week later the final good-byes were said and the Southern Cross was ready for sea. She was to meet a coal-ship at Monte Video in the Argentine Republic which would tow her as far as the Great Barrier. This was to conserve her own coal supply. The other vessel would then discharge her cargo of coal,--thus leaving the adventurers a plentiful supply of fuel in case the worst came to worst, and they were frozen in for a second winter.  In case nothing was heard of them by the following fall a relief ship was to be despatched which would reach them roughly about the beginning of December, when the Antarctic summer is beginning to draw to a close. The commander of the Southern Cross expected to reach the great southern ice-barrier in about the beginning of February, when the winter, which reaches its climax in August, would be just closing in. The winter months were to be devoted to establishing a camp, from which in the following spring--answering to our fall--the expedition would be sent out.  \"Hurray! a winter in the Polar ice,\" shouted the boys as the program was explained to them.  \"And a dash for the pole to cap it off,\" shouted the usually unemotional Frank, his face shining at the prospect.  As has been said, the Southern Cross was an old whaler. Built rather for staunchness than beauty, she was no ideal of a mariner's dream as she unobtrusively cleared from her wharf one gray, chilly morning which held a promise of snow in its leaden sky. There were few but the stevedores, who always hang about \"the Basin,\" and some idlers, to watch her as she cast off her lines and a tug pulled her head round till she pointed for the opening of the berth in which she had lain so long. Of these onlookers not one had any more than a hazy idea of where the vessel was bound and why.  As the Southern Cross steamed steadily on down the bay, past the bleak hills of Staten Island, on by Sandy Hook, reaching out its long, desolate finger as if pointing ships out to the ocean beyond, the three boys stood together in a delighted group in the lee of a pile of steel drums, each containing twenty gallons of gasolene.  \"Well, old fellow, we're off at last,\" cried Frank, his eye kindling as the Southern Cross altered her course a bit and stood due south down the Jersey coast.  \"That's it,\" cried Billy, with a wave of his soft cap, \"off at last; we're the three luckiest boys on this globe, I say.\"  \"Same here,\" was Harry's rejoinder.  The blunt bows of the Southern Cross began to lift to the long heave of the ever restless Atlantic. She slid over the shoulder of one big wave and into the trough of another with a steady rhythmic glide that spoke well for her seaworthy qualities. Frank, snugly out of the nipping wind in the shelter of the gasolene drums, was silent for several minutes musing over the adventurous voyage on which they were setting out. Thus he had not noticed a change coming over Harry and Billy. Suddenly a groan fell on his ear. Startled, the boy looked round.  On the edge of the hatch sat Billy and beside him, his head sunk in his hands, was Harry.  \"What's the matter with you fellows?\" demanded Frank.  At that instant an unusually large breaker came rolling towards the Southern Cross and caught her fair and square on the side of the bow. Deep laden as she was it broke over her and a wall of green water came tumbling and sweeping along the decks. Frank avoided it by leaping upward and seizing a stanchion used to secure the framework holding down the deck load.  But neither Harry nor Billy moved, except a few minutes later when another heavy roll sent them sliding into the scuppers.  \"Come, you fellows, you'd better get up, and turn in aft,\" said Frank.  \"Oh, leave me alone,\" groaned Billy.  \"I'm going to die, I think,\" moaned Harry.  At this moment the new steward, a raw boy from Vermont, who had been at sea for several years, came up to where the two boys were suffering.  \"Breakfast's ready,\" he announced, \"there's some nice fat bacon and fried eggs and jam and----\"  It was too much. With what strength they had left Billy and Harry tumbled to their feet and aimed simultaneous blows at him.  It was a final effort and as the Southern Cross plunged onward toward her mysterious goal she carried with her two of the most sea-sick boys ever recorded on a ship's manifest.     CHAPTER IV.  A MESSAGE FROM THE AIR.   It was a bright, sunshiny morning a week later. The Southern Cross was now in sub-tropic waters, steaming steadily along under blue skies and through smooth azure water flecked here and there with masses of yellow gulf weed.  The boys were in a group forward watching the flying fish that fled like coveys of frightened birds as the bow of the polar ship cut through the water. Under Dr. Gregg's care Billy and Harry had quite recovered from their sea-sickness.  \"Off there to the southeast somewhere is the treasure galleon and the Sargasso Sea,\" said Harry, indicating the purplish haze that hung on the horizon. [Footnote: See Vol. 4 of this series, The Boy Aviators' Treasure Quest; or, The Golden Galleon.]  \"Yes, and off there is the South Pole,\" rejoined Frank, pointing due south, \"I wish the old Southern Cross could make better speed, I'm impatient to be there.\"  \"And I'm impatient to solve some of the mystery of this voyage,\" put in Billy, \"here we've been at sea a week and Captain Hazzard hasn't told us yet anything about that--that,--well you know, that ship you spoke about, Frank.\"  \"He will tell us all in good time,\" rejoined the other, \"and now instead of wasting speculation on something we are bound not to find out till we do find it out, let's go aft to the wireless room and polish up a bit.\"  The Southern Cross carried a wireless apparatus which had been specially installed for her polar voyage. The aerials stretched from her main to mizzen mast and a small room, formerly a storeroom, below the raised poop containing the cabins had been fitted up for a wireless room. In this the boys had spent a good deal of time during their convalescence from sea-sickness and had managed to \"pick-up\" many vessels within their radius,--which was fifteen hundred miles under favorable conditions.  Frank was the first to clap on the head-receiver this morning and he sat silently for a while absently clicking out calls, to none of which he obtained an answer. Suddenly, however, his face grew excited.  \"Hullo,\" he cried, \"here's something.\"  \"What?\" demanded Harry.  \"I don't know yet,\" he held up his hand to demand silence.  \"That's queer,\" he exclaimed, after a pause, in which the receiver had buzzed and purred its message into his ear.  The others looked their questions.  \"There's something funny about this message,\" he went on. \"I cannot understand it. Whoever is calling has a very weak sending current. I can hardly hear it. One thing is certain though, it's someone in distress.\"  The others leaned forward eagerly, but their curiosity was not satisfied immediately by Frank. Instead his face became set in concentration once more. After some moments of silence, broken only by the slight noise of the receiver, he pressed his hand on the sending apparatus and the Southern Cross's wireless began to crackle and spit and emit a leaping blue flame.  \"What's he sending?\" asked Billy, turning to Harry.  \"Wait a second,\" was the rejoinder. The wireless continued to crackle and flash.  \"Cracky,\" suddenly cried Harry, \"hark at that, Billy.\"  \"What,\" sputtered the reporter, \"that stuff doesn't mean anything to me. What's he done, picked up a ship or a land station or what?\"  \"No,\" was the astounding response, \"he's picked up an airship!\"  \"Oh, get out,\" protested the amazed Billy.  \"That's right,\" snapped Frank, \"as far as I can make out it's a dirigible balloon that has been blown out to sea. They tried to give me their position, and as near as I can comprehend their message, they are between us and the shore somewhere within a radius of about twenty miles.\"  \""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6973"],["title","The Boy Aviators' Polar Dash; or, Facing Death in the Antarctic (#4)"],["body","they in distress?\" demanded Billy.  \"Yes. The heat has expanded their gas and they fear that the bag of the ship may explode at any moment. They cut off suddenly. The accident may have occurred already.\"  \"Why don't they open the valve?\"  \"I suppose because in that case they'd stand every chance of dropping into the sea,\" responded Frank, disconnecting the instrument and removing the head-piece. \"I have sent word to them that we will try to rescue them, but I'm afraid it's a slim chance. I must tell Captain Hazzard at once.\"  Followed by the other two, Frank dashed up the few steps leading to the deck and unceremoniously burst into the captain's cabin where the latter was busy with a mass of charts and documents in company with Captain Barrington, the navigating commander.  \"I beg your pardon,\" exclaimed Frank, as Captain Hazzard looked up, \"but I have picked up a most important message by wireless,--two men, in an airship, are in deadly peril not far from us.\"  The two commanders instantly became interested.  \"An airship!\" cried Captain Hazzard.  \"What's that!\" exclaimed Captain Barrington. \"Did they give you their position?\" he added quickly.  \"Yes,\" replied the boy, and rapidly repeated the latitude and longitude as he had noted it.  \"That means they are to the west of us,\" exclaimed Captain Barrington as the boy concluded. He hastily picked up a speaking tube and hailed the wheel-house, giving instructions to change the course. He then emerged on deck followed by Captain Hazzard and the boys. The next hour was spent in anxiously scanning the surrounding sea.  Suddenly a man who had been sent into the crow's nest on the main mast gave a hail.  \"I see something, sir,\" he cried, pointing to the southwest.  \"What is it,\" demanded the captain.  \"Looks like a big bird,\" was the response.  Slinging his binoculars round his neck by their strap, Captain Barrington himself clambered into the main shrouds. When he had climbed above the cross-trees he drew out his glasses and gazed in the direction the lookout indicated. The next minute he gave a shout of triumph.  \"There's your dirigible, boys,\" he exclaimed, and even Billy overcame his dislike to clambering into the rigging for a chance to get a look at the airship they hoped to save.  Viewed even through the glasses she seemed a speck, no larger than a shoe button, drifting aimlessly toward the south, but as the Southern Cross drew nearer to her she stood out in more detail. The watchers could then see that she was a large air craft for her type and carried two men, who were running back and forth in apparent panic on her suspended deck. Suddenly one of them swung himself into the rigging and began climbing up the distended sides of the big cigar-shaped gas bag.  \"What can he be going to do?\" asked Captain Hazzard.  \"I think I know,\" said Frank. \"The valve must be stuck and they have decided now that as we are so near they will take a chance and open it and risk a drop into the sea rather than have the over-distended bag blow up.\"  \"Of course. I never thought of that,\" rejoined the captain, \"that's just what they are doing.\"  \"That man is taking a desperate chance,\" put in Professor Simeon Sandburr, who had climbed up and joined the party and looked with his long legs and big round glasses, like some queer sort of a bird perched in the rigging. \"Hydrogen gas is deadly and if he should inhale any of it he would die like a bug in a camphor bottle.\"  Interest on board the Southern Cross was now intense in the fate of the dirigible. Even the old chief engineer had left his engines and wiping his hands with a bit of waste, stood gazing at the distressed cloud clipper.  \"The mon moost be daft,\" he exclaimed, \"any mon that wud go tae sea in sic a craft moost be daft. It's fair temptin' o' providence.\"  At that instant there was a sharp and sudden collapse of the balloon bag. It seemed to shrivel like a bit of burned paper, and the structure below it fell like a stone into the ocean, carrying with it the man who had remained on it. Of the other, the one who had climbed the bag, not a trace could be seen. Even as the onlookers gazed horror-stricken at the sudden blotting out of the dirigible before their eyes the loud roar of the explosion of its superheated gas reached their ears.  \"Every pound of steam you've got, chief,\" sharply commanded Captain Barrington, almost before the dirigible vanished, \"we must save them yet.\"  The old engineer dived into his engine room and the Southern Cross, with her gauges registering every pound of steam her boilers could carry, rushed through the water as she never had before in all her plodding career.  \"Heaven grant we may not be too late,\" breathed Captain Hazzard, as, followed by the boys, he clambered out of the rigging. \"If only they can swim we may save them.\"  \"Or perhaps they have on life-belts,\" suggested Billy.  \"Neither will do them much good,\" put in a voice at his elbow grimly. It was Professor Sandburr.  \"Why?\" demanded Frank, \"we will be alongside in a few minutes now and if they can only keep up we can save them.\"  \"The peril of drowning is not so imminent as another grave danger they face,\" spoke the professor.  \"What's that?\"  \"Sharks,\" was the reply, \"these waters swarm with them.\"     CHAPTER V.  A TRAGEDY OF THE SKIES.   It was soon evident that the two men were supporting themselves in the water. Their heads made black dots on the surface beneath which the heavy deck structure of the dirigible had vanished. Through the glasses it could be seen that they were swimming about awaiting the arrival of the vessel which was rushing at her top speed to their aid.  Soon the Southern Cross was alongside and a dozen ropes and life buoys were hastily cast over the side. But even as one of the men grasped a rope's end he gave a scream of terror that long rang in the boys' ears.  At the same instant a huge, dark body shot through the water and then there was a whitish gleam as the monster shark turned on its back with its jaws open displaying a triple row of saw-like teeth.  \"Quick, shoot him,\" cried Captain Hazzard.  But nobody had a rifle or revolver. Frank hastily darted into his cabin for his magazine weapon but when he reappeared there was only a crimson circle on the water to mark where the terrible, man-killing shark had vanished with his prey. Attracted, no doubt, by the mysterious sense that tells these sea tigers where they can snap up a meal, other dark fins now began to cut through the water in all directions.  The second man, almost overcome by the horror of his companion's fate, however, had presence of mind enough to grasp a rope's end. In a few seconds he had been hauled to the vessel's side and several of the crew were preparing to hoist him on board when two of the monsters made a simultaneous rush at him, Frank's revolver cracked at the same instant and the sea tigers, with savage snaps of their jaws, which, however, fell short of their intended prey, rolled over and vanished.  The rescued man when hauled on deck was a pitiable object. But even in his half famished condition and with the great beard that he wore there was something very familiar--strangely so--about him to the boys. Frank was the first to solve the mystery.  \"Ben Stubbs,\" he exclaimed.  \"Who's that that called Ben Stubbs,\" exclaimed the man over whom a dozen sailors and the doctor had been bending.  \"It's me,\" shouted Frank, regardless of grammar, \"Frank Chester.\"  The amazement on the face of the old salt who had accompanied the boys in Africa and the Everglades and shared their perils in the Sargasso Sea, was comical to behold.  \"Well, what in the name of the great horn-spoon air you boys doing here,\" he gasped, for Harry and Billy had now come forward and were warmly shaking his hand.  \"Well, answer us first: what are you doing here?\" demanded Frank.  \"Coming mighty near my finish like my poor mate,\" was the reply.  \"Perhaps your friend had better come in the cabin and have something to eat while he talks,\" suggested Captain Hazzard to the boys.  All agreed that that would be a good idea and the castaway was escorted to the cabin table on which Hiram Scroggs the Vermonter soon spread a fine meal.  \"Wall, first and foremost,\" began Ben, the meal being dispatched, \"I 'spose you want to know how I come to be out here skydoodling around in a dirigible?\"  \"That's it,\" cried Billy.  \"It's just this way,\" resumed the old sailor drawing out his aged pipe. \"Yer see, my pardner, James Melville,--that's the poor feller that's dead,--and me was trying out his new air-craft when we got blown out ter sea. We'd been goin' fer two days when you picked up the wireless call for help he was sending out. I used ter say that wireless was a fool thing ter have on an air-ship, but I owe my life ter it all right.  \"Ter go back a bit, I met Melville soon after we got back from the treasure hunt. He was a friend of my sister's husband and as full of ideas as a bird dog of fleas. But he didn't have no money to carry out his inventions and as I had a pocketful I couldn't exactly figure how to use, I agreed to back him in his wireless dirigible. We tried her out several times ashore and then shipped her to Floridy, meaning to try to fly to Cuba. But day afore yesterday while we was up on a trial flight the wind got up in a hurry and at the same moment something busted on the engine and, before we knew where we was, we was out at sea.\"  \"You must have been scared to death,\" put in Professor Sandburr who was an interested listener.  \"Not at first we wasn't. Poor Melville in fact seemed to think it was a fine chance to test his ship. He managed to tinker up the engine after working all night and part of yesterday on it and as we had plenty to eat and drink on board--for we had stocked the boat up preparatory to flying to Cuba--we didn't worry much.  \"Howsomever, early this morning, after we'd had the engine going all night we found we was still in the same position"]]]
