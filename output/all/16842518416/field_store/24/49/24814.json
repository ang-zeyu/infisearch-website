Do tell us, Mamma,\" she called.  Mrs. Vanderburgh turned away from the rail, where she had paused in her constitutional when addressed by the old gentleman, and came up to the girls.  \"Do sit down, Mamma, in your steamer chair,\" begged Fanny; \"I'll tuck you up in your rug.\" And she jumped lightly out of her own chair. \"There, that's nice,\" as Mrs. Vanderburgh sank gracefully down, and Fanny patted and pulled the rug into shape. \"Now tell us, wasn't he the most horrible old bore?\"  As she cuddled back into her own nest, Mrs. Vanderburgh laughed in a very high-bred manner. \"He was very amusing,\" she said.  \"Amusing! I should say so!\" cried Fanny. \"I suppose he would have told you all his family history if he had stayed. O dear me, he is such a common, odious old person.\"  Polly twisted uneasily under her rug.  Mrs. Vanderburgh glanced into the steamer chair on the other side. It had several books on top of the rug. \"I don't believe he can take that seat,\" she said; \"still, Fanny, I think it would be well for you to change into it, for that old man may take it into his head, when he makes the turn of the deck, to drop into it and give us the whole of his family history.\"  \"Horrors!\" ejaculated Fanny, hopping out of her chair again. \"I'll make sure that he doesn't. And yet I did so want to sit next to Polly Pepper,\" she mourned, ensconcing herself under the neighbouring rug, and putting the books on the floor by her side.  \"Don't do that; give them to me,\" said her mother; \"I'll put them in your chair unless Miss Polly will take that place, only I don't like to disturb you, dear,\" she said with a sweet smile at Polly.  \"Why, that would make matters' worse, Mamma,\" said Fanny. \"Don't you see, then, that old bore would put himself into Polly's chair, for he likes her, anyway. Do leave it as it is.\"  So Mrs. Vanderburgh smiled again. \"I don't know but that you are right,\" she said, and leaned back her head restfully. \"Dear me, yes, he _is_ amusing.\"  \"They are terribly common people,\" said Fanny, her aristocratic nose well in the air, \"aren't they, Mamma? And did you ever see such a clumsy thing as that dreadful boy, and such big hands and feet?\" She held up her own hands as she spoke, and played with her rings, and let the jingling bracelets run up and down her wrists.  \"Fanny, how often must I tell you to wear gloves on shipboard?\" said her mother, in a tone of reproof. \"Nothing spoils the hands so much as a trip at sea. They won't get over it all summer; they're coarsened already,\" and she cast an alarmed glance at the long, slender fingers.  \"I'm so tired of gloves, Mamma.\" Fanny gave a restful yawn. \"Polly Pepper doesn't wear them,\" she cried triumphantly, peering past her mother to point to Polly's hands.  Mrs. Vanderburgh hesitated. It wouldn't do to say anything that would reflect against the Peppers--manners, or customs, or bringing up generally. So she leaned over and touched Polly's fingers with her own gloved ones.  \"You don't wear gloves, do you, my dear?\" she said, in gentle surprise, quite as if the idea had just struck her for the first time.  \"No, Mrs. Vanderburgh, I don't,\" said Polly, \"at least not on shipboard, unless it is cold.\"  \"There, now, Mamma,\" laughed Fanny, in a pleased way; \"you'll stop teasing me about wearing them, I'm sure.\"  Mrs. Vanderburgh turned and surveyed her daughter; but she didn't smile, and Fanny thought it as well to begin again on the old topic.  \"They're awfully common people, aren't they, Mamma,--those Selwyns?\"  \"They are, indeed,\" replied Mrs. Vanderburgh, \"quite commonplace, and exceedingly tiresome; be sure and not speak to them, Fanny.\"  \"Trust me for that,\" said Fanny, with a wise little nod. \"The old man stopped me and asked me something this morning, as I was coming out of the dining room, after breakfast, but I pretended I didn't hear, and I skipped upstairs and almost fell on my nose.\"  \"You were fortunate to escape,\" said her mother, with a little laugh. \"Well, let us drop the subject and talk of something else much more important. Polly, my dear.\" She turned again and surveyed the young girl at her side. \"You are coming home this autumn, aren't you?\"  \"Oh, no,\" said Polly, \"Grandpapa expects to stay over in Europe a year.\"  \"Is that so?\" said Mrs. Vanderburgh, and her face fell; \"I regret it exceedingly, for I should be glad if you would visit Fanny this winter in New York.\"  \"Thank you; but I couldn't anyway,\" said Polly. Then the colour flew up to her cheek. \"I mean I am in school, you know, Mrs. Vanderburgh, but I thank you, and it is so good of you to want me,\" she added, hurriedly, feeling that she hadn't said the right thing at all.  \"I do want you very much, my dear child,\" said Mrs. Vanderburgh, \"and I am very sorry you are to remain abroad over the winter, for your Grandfather would be persuaded, I feel quite sure, to have you leave school for a while, and come to us for a visit.\"  \"Oh, no, he wouldn't,\" cried Polly, quickly. \"I beg pardon, Mrs. Vanderburgh, but I never leave school for anything unless I am sick, and I am almost never sick.\"  \"Well, then, you could come for the Christmas holidays,\" said Mrs. Vanderburgh, with ladylike obstinacy like one accustomed to carrying her point.  \"The Christmas holidays!\" exclaimed Polly, starting forward in her chair. \"Oh, I wouldn't leave home for anything, then, Mrs. Vanderburgh. Why, we have the most beautiful times, and we are all together--the boys come home from school--and it's just too lovely for anything!\" She clasped her hands and sighed--oh, if she could but see Ben and Joel and David but once!  Mrs. Vanderburgh was a very tall woman, and she gazed down into the radiant face, without speaking; Polly was looking off over the sea, and the colour came and went on her cheek.  \"We would soon get her out of all such notions, if we once had her with us, wouldn't we, Mamma?\" said Fanny, in a low tone close to her mother's ear.  Mrs. Vanderburgh gave her a warning pinch, but Polly's brown eyes were fastened on the distant horizon, and she hadn't heard a word.  \"Well, we'll arrange it sometime,\" said Fanny's mother, breaking the silence; \"so you must remember, Polly dear, that you are engaged to us for a good long visit when you do come home.\"  \"I will tell Grandpapa that you asked me,\" said Polly, bringing her eyes back with a sigh to look into Mrs. Vanderburgh's face.  \"Oh, he will fall into the plan quite readily, I think,\" said Mrs. Vanderburgh, lightly. \"You know we are all very old friends--that is, the families are--Mr. Vanderburgh's father and Mr. King were very intimate. Perhaps you don't know, Polly,\"--and Fanny's mamma drew herself up to her extreme height; it was impossible for her to loll back in her chair when talking of her family,--\"that we are related to the Earl of Cavendish who owns the old estate in England, and we go back to William the Conqueror; that is, Fanny does on her father's side.\"  Fanny thereupon came up out of her chair depths to sit quite straight and gaze with importance at Polly's face. But Polly was still thinking of the boys, and she said nothing.  \"And my family is just as important,\" said Mrs. Vanderburgh, and she smiled in great satisfaction. \"Really, we could make things very pleasant for you, my child; our set is so exclusive, you could not possibly meet any one but the very best people. Oh, here is your mother.\" She smiled enchantingly up at Mrs. Fisher, and held out her hand. \"Do come and sit here with us, my dear Mrs. Fisher,\" she begged, \"then we shall be a delightful group, we two mothers and our daughters.\"  \"Thank you, Mrs. Vanderburgh.\" Mrs. Fisher smiled, but she didn't offer to take the steamer chair. \"I have come after Polly.\"  \"Mamsie, what is it? I'll come,\" said Polly, tumbling out of her steamer chair in a twinkling.  \"O dear me!\" exclaimed Mrs. Vanderburgh, in regret, \"don't take Polly away, I do implore you, my dear Mrs. Fisher--I am _so_ fond of her.\"  \"I must,\" said Mother Fisher, smiling again, her hand now in Polly's, and before any more remonstrances were made, they were off.  \"Oh, Mamsie!\" breathed Polly, hanging to the dear hand, \"I am so glad you came, and took me away.\"  \"Polly,\" said Mother Fisher, suddenly, \"Grandpapa asked me to find you; he thinks you could cheer old Mr. Selwyn up a bit, perhaps, with backgammon. I'm afraid Tom has been behaving badly again.\"  \"Oh, Mamsie!\" exclaimed Polly, in dismay. And then the story came out.  \"Grandpapa,\" said Phronsie, pulling at his hand gently, as they walked slowly up and down the deck, \"does your head ache?\" And she peered anxiously up into his face.  \"No, child--that is, not much,\" said old Mr. King, trying to smooth his brows out. He was thinking--for it kept obtruding at all times and seasons--of that dreadful scrap of paper that Cousin Eunice had imposed upon him at the last minute before they sailed, announcing that she had had her way, and would at last compel acceptance of such a gift as she chose to make to Phronsie Pepper.  \"If it aches at all,\" said Phronsie, decidedly, \"I wish you would let me rub it for you, Grandpapa. I do, truly.\"  \"Well, it doesn't,\" said Grandpapa; \"that is it won't, now that I have you with me. I was thinking of something unpleasant, Phronsie, and then, to tell you the truth, that old Mr. Selwyn tires me to death. I can't talk to him, and his grandson is a cad.\"  \"What is a cad?\" asked Phronsie, wonderingly.  \"Oh, well, a boy who isn't nice,\" said Mr. King, carelessly.  \"Grandpapa, why isn't that boy nice to that poor old man?\" asked Phronsie, a grieved look coming into her blue eyes.  \"Goodness me, child,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6987"],["title","Five Little Peppers Abroad (#6)"],["body"," ask me too much,\" said Mr. King, quickly; \"oh, a variety of reasons. Well, we must take things as we find them, and do what we can to help matters along; but it seems a hopeless case,--things were in better shape; and now they seem all tangled up again, thanks to that boy.\"  \"Grandpapa,\" said Phronsie, earnestly, \"I don't believe that boy means to be bad to that poor old man, I don't really and truly, Grandpapa,\" she added, shaking her head.  \"Well, he takes a queer way to show it, if he means to be good,\" said old Mr. King, grimly.  \"Oh, is that you, Master Tom?\" as they turned a corner to find themselves face to face with Tom Selwyn.  \"Mr. King,\" Tom began very rapidly so that the words ran all over each other, \"I'm no end sorry--don't think hard things of me--it's not my fault this time; Grandfather heard it as well as I--at least, I caught a little and he asked me what it was, and I had to tell him, and it upset him.\"  Old Mr. King stood gazing into the big boy's face in utter bewilderment. \"As I don't know in the least what you are trying to tell me, my boy,\" at last he said, \"I shall have to ask you to repeat it, and go slowly.\"  So Tom tried again to tell his story, and by the time that it was all out, Mr. King was fuming in righteous indignation.  \"Well, well, it's not worth thinking of,\" at last he said at sight of the flashing eyes before him and the angry light on the young face. \"You take my arm, or I'll take yours, Master Tom,--there, that's better,--and we'll do a bit of a turn on the deck. Your grandfather'll come out of it, for he's busy over the backgammon board. But it was an ugly thing to do just the same.\"  Just then Mrs. Vanderburgh and Fanny passed them, all sweet smiles for him and for Phronsie, but with no eyes for the boy.     V  A FISH STORY AND OTHER THINGS   \"Oh, Polly! Polly!\" Phronsie came running along the deck, and up to the little group playing shuffle-board; \"there's such a very big whale.\" And she clasped her hands in great excitement. \"There truly is. Do come and see him.\"  \"Is there, Pet?\" cried Polly, throwing down her shovel, \"then we must all go and see him. Come, Jasper, and all of you,\" and she seized Phronsie's hand.  \"He is very dreadful big,\" said Phronsie, as they sped on, Jasper and the other players close behind. \"And he puffed, Polly, and the water went up, oh, so high!\"  \"That's because he came up to breathe,\" said Polly, as they raced along. \"Dear me, I hope he won't be gone when we get there.\"  \"Can't he breathe under the water?\" asked Phronsie, finding it rather hard work to perform that exercise herself in such a race. \"What does he stay down there for, then, say, Polly?\"  \"Oh, because he likes it,\" answered Polly, carelessly. \"Take care, Phronsie, you're running into all those steamer chairs.\"  \"I'm sorry he can't breathe,\" said Phronsie, anxiously trying to steer clear of the bunch of steamer chairs whose occupants had suddenly left them, too, to see the whale. \"Poor whale--I'm sorry for him, Polly.\"  \"Oh, he's happy,\" said Polly, \"he likes it just as it is. He comes up for a little while to blow and--\"  \"I thought you said he came up to breathe, Polly,\" said Phronsie, tugging at Polly's hand, and guilty of interrupting.  \"Well, and so he does, and to blow, too,--it's just the same thing,\" said Polly, quickly.  \"Is it just exactly the same?\" asked Phronsie.  \"Yes, indeed; that is, in the whale's case,\" answered Polly, as they ran up to Grandpapa and the rest of their party, and the knots of other passengers, all staring hard at a certain point on the sparkling waste of water.  \"I thought you were never coming,\" said old Mr. King, moving away from the rail to tuck Polly and Phronsie in where they could get a good view. \"Oh, there he is--there he is--Jasper, look!\" cried Polly.  \"There he is!\" crowed Phronsie, now much excited. \"Oh, isn't he big, Grandpapa?\"  \"I should say he was,\" declared Mr. King. \"I think I never saw a finer whale in my life, Phronsie.\"  \"He comes up to blow,\" said Phronsie, softly to herself, her face pressed close to the rail, and her yellow hair floating off in the breeze; \"and Polly says it doesn't hurt him, and he likes it.\"  \"What is it, Phronsie child?\" asked old Mr. King, hearing her voice.  \"Grandpapa, has he got any little whales?\" asked Phronsie, suddenly raising her face.  \"Oh, yes, I imagine so,\" said old Mr. King; \"that is, he ought to have, I'm sure. Porpoises go in schools,--why shouldn't whales, pray tell?\"  \"What's a porpoise?\" asked Phronsie, with wide eyes.  \"Oh, he's a dolphin or a grampus.\"  \"Oh,\" said Phronsie, much mystified, \"and does he go to school?\"  \"Well, they go ever so many of them together, and they call it a school. Goodness me--that _is_ a blow!\" as the whale spouted valiantly, and looked as if he were making directly for the steamer.  \"Oh, Grandpapa, he's coming right here!\" screamed Phronsie, clapping her hands in delight, and hopping up and down,--Polly and Jasper were almost as much excited,--while the passengers ran hither and thither to get a good view, and levelled their big glasses, and oh-ed and ah-ed. And some of them ran to get their cameras. And Mr. Whale seemed to like it, for he spouted and flirted his long tail and dashed into the water and out again to blow, till they were all quite worn out looking at him. At last, with a final plunge, he bade them all good-by and disappeared.  Phronsie, after her first scream of delight, had pressed her face close to the rail and held her breath. She did not say a word, but gazed in speechless enjoyment at the antics of the big fish. And Grandpapa had to speak two or three times when the show was all over before she heard him.  \"Did you like it, Phronsie?\" he asked, gathering her hand up closely in his, as he leaned over to see her face.  Phronsie turned away with a sigh. \"Oh, Grandpapa, he was so beautiful!\" She drew a long breath, then turned back longingly. \"Won't he ever come back?\" she asked.  \"Maybe not this one,\" said old Mr. King; \"but we'll see plenty more, I imagine, Phronsie. At least, if not on this voyage,--why, some other time.\"  \"Oh, wasn't it splendid!\" exclaimed Polly, tossing back the little rings of brown hair from her brow. \"Well, he's gone; now we must run back, Jasper, and finish our game.\" And they were off, the other players following.  \"I'd like to see this very whale again,\" said Phronsie, with a small sigh; \"Grandpapa, I would, really; he was a nice whale.\"  \"Yes, he was a fine one,\" said old Mr. King. \"I don't know as I ever put eyes on a better specimen, and I've seen a great many in my life.\"  \"Tell me about them, do, Grandpapa,\" begged Phronsie, drawing nearer to him.  \"Well, I'll get into my steamer chair, and you shall sit in my lap, and then I'll tell you about some of them,\" said Mr. King, much gratified. As they moved off, Phronsie clinging to his hand, she looked back and saw two children gazing wistfully after them. \"Grandpapa,\" she whispered, pulling his hand gently to attract attention, \"may that little boy and girl come, too, and hear about your whales?\"  \"Yes, to be sure,\" cried Mr. King. So Phronsie called them, and in a few minutes there was quite a big group around Grandpapa's steamer chair; for when the other children saw what was going on, they stopped, too, and before he knew, there he was perfectly surrounded.  \"I should very much like to hear what it is all about.\" Mrs. Vanderburgh's soft voice broke into a pause, when old Mr. King stopped to rest a bit. \"You must be very fascinating, dear Mr. King; you have no idea how pretty your group is.\" She pulled Fanny forward gently into the outer fringe of the circle. \"Pray, what is the subject?\"  \"Nothing in the world but a fish story, Madam,\" said the old gentleman.  \"Oh, _may_ we stay and hear it?\" cried Mrs. Vanderburgh, enthusiastically, clasping her gloved hands. \"Fanny adores such things, don't you, dear?\" turning to her.  \"Yes, indeed, Mamma,\" answered Fanny, trying to look very much pleased.  \"Take my word for it, you will find little to interest either of you,\" said Mr. King.  \"Oh, I should be charmed,\" cried Mrs. Vanderburgh. \"Fanny dear, draw up that steamer chair to the other side.\" But a stout, comfortable-looking woman coming down the deck stopped directly in front of that same chair, and before Fanny could move it, sat down, saying, \"This is my chair, young lady.\"  \"That vulgar old woman has got it,\" said Fanny, coming back quite crestfallen.  \"Ugh!\" Mrs. Vanderburgh shrugged her shoulders as she looked at the occupant of the chair, who surveyed her calmly, then fell to reading her book. \"Well, you must just bear it, dear; it's one of the annoyances to be endured on shipboard.\"  \"I suppose the lady wanted her own chair,\" observed Mr. King, dryly.  \"Lady? Oh, my dear Mr. King!\" Mrs. Vanderburgh gave a soft little laugh. \"It's very good of you to put it that way, I'm sure. Well, now do let us hear that delightful story. Fanny dear, you can sit on part of my chair,\" she added, regardless of the black looks of a gentleman hovering near, who had a sharp glance on the green card hanging to the back of the chair she had appropriated and that bore his name.  So Fanny perched on the end of the steamer chair, and Mr. King, not seeing any way out of it, went on in his recital of the whale story, winding up with an account of some wonderful porpoises he had seen, and a variety of other things, until suddenly he turned his head and keenly regarded Fanny's mother.  \"How intensely interesting!\" she exclaimed, opening her eyes, and trying not to yawn. \"Do go on, and finish about that whale,\" feeling that she must say something.  \"Mamma!\" exclaimed Fanny, trying to stop her.  \"I ended up that whale some five minutes ago, Madam,\" said Mr. King. \"I think you must have been asleep.\"  \"Oh, no, indeed, I have been charmed every moment,\" protested Mrs. Vanderburgh sitting quite erect. \"You surely have the gift of a _raconteur_, Mr. King,\" she said, gracefully"]]]
