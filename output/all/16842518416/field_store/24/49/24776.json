The four staterooms on the other side were to be occupied by the boys, whom the lieutenant assigned to the one nearest the stern, the second engineer and the mate were berthed next to them. Then came the cabin of Captain Pent Barrington, the navigating officer of the ship, and his first mate, a New Englander, as dry as salt cod, named Darius Green. The fourth stateroom was empty. The steward bunked forward in a little cabin rigged up in the same deck-house as the galley which snuggled up to the foot of the foremast.  Summing up what the boys saw as they followed their conductor over the ship they found her to be a three-masted, bark-rigged vessel with a cro' nest, like a small barrel, perched atop of her mainmast. Her already large coal bunkers had been added to until she was enabled to carry enough coal to give her a tremendous cruising radius. It was in order to economize on fuel she was rigged for the carrying of sail when she encountered a good slant of wind. Her forecastle, originally the dark, wet hole common to whalers, had been built up till it was a commodious chamber fitted with bunks at the sides and a swinging table in the center, which could be hoisted up out of the way when not in use. Like the officers' cabins, it was warmed by radiators fed from the main boilers when under way and from the donkey, or auxiliary, boiler when hove to.  Besides the provisions, which the stevedores, having completed their \"spell,\" were now tumbling into the hold with renewed ardor, the deck was piled high with a strange miscellany of articles. There were sledges, bales of canvas, which on investigation proved to be tents, coils of rope, pick-axes, shovels, five portable houses in knock-down form, a couple of specially constructed whale boats, so made as to resist any ordinary pressure that might be brought to bear on them in the polar drift, and nail-kegs and tool-chests everywhere.  Peeping into the hold the boys saw that each side of it had been built up with big partitions, something like the pigeon-holes in which bolts of cloth are stored in dry-goods shops--only much larger. Each of these spaces was labeled in plain letters with the nature of the stores to be placed there so that those in charge of the supplies would have no difficulty in laying their hands at once on whatever happened to be needed. Each space was provided with a swiveled bar of stout timber which could be pulled across the front of the opening in heavy weather, and which prevented anything plunging out.  Captain Hazzard explained that the heavy stores were stowed forward and the provisions aft. A gallery ran between the shelves from stem to stern and provided ready access to any part of the holds. A system of hot steam-pipes had been rigged in the holds so that in the antarctic an equable temperature could be maintained. The great water tanks were forward immediately below the forecastle. The inspection of the engines came last. The Southern Cross had been fitted with new water-tube boilers--two of them--that steamed readily on small fuel consumption. Her engine was triple expansion, especially installed, as the boilers had been, to take the place of the antiquated machinery boasted by the old Thayer.  \"Hoot, mon, she's as fine as a liner,\" commented old MacKenzie, the \"chief,\" who had taken charge of the boys on this part of their expedition over the vessel, which was destined to be their home for many months.  \"Some day,\" said Frank, \"every vessel will be equipped with gasoline motors and all this clumsy arrangement of boilers and complicated piping will be done away with.\"  The old Scotch engineer looked at him queerly.  \"Oh, ay,\" he sniffed, \"and some day we'll all go to sea in pea-soup bowls nae doot.\"  \"Well, a man in Connecticut has built a schooner out of cement,\" declared Harry.  The engineer looked at him and slowly wiped his hands on a bit of waste.  \"I ken his head must be a muckle thicker nor that,\" was his comment, at which both the boys laughed as they climbed the steel ladders that led from the warm and oily regions to the deck. The engineer, with a \"dour\" Scot's grin, gazed after them.  \"Hoots-toots,\" he muttered to his gauges and levers, \"the great ice has a wonderful way with lads as cocksure as them twa.\"     CHAPTER II.  A MYSTERIOUS ROBBERY.   Their inspection of the Southern Cross completed, the delighted boys accompanied Captain Hazzard back to the main cabin, where he unfolded before them a huge chart of the polar regions.  The chart was traced over in many places with tiny red lines which made zig-zags and curves over the blankness of the region south of the eightieth parallel.  \"These lines mark the points reached by different explorers,\" explained the captain. \"See, here is Scott's furthest south, and here the most recent advance into south polar regions, that of Sir Ernest Shackleton. In my opinion Shackleton might have reached his goal if he had used a motor sledge, capable of carrying heavy weights, and not placed his sole dependence on ponies.\"  The boys nodded; Frank had read the explorer's narrative and realized that what Captain Hazzard said was in all probability correct.  \"It remains for your expedition to carry the Stars and Stripes further to the southward yet,\" exclaimed Frank, enthusiastically, as Captain Hazzard rolled up the map.  \"Not only for us,\" smiled the captain; \"we have a rival in the field.\"  \"A rival expedition?\" exclaimed Frank.  \"Exactly. Some time this month a Japanese expedition under Lieutenant Saki is to set out from Yokahama for Wilkes Land.  \"They are to be towed by a man-of-war until they are in the polar regions so as to save the supply of coal on the small steamer they are using,\" went on the captain. \"Everything has been conducted with the utmost secrecy and it is their intention to beat us there if possible--hence all this haste.\"  \"How did our government get wind of the fact that the Japs are getting ready another expedition?\" inquired Frank, somewhat puzzled.  \"By means of our secret service men. I don't doubt that the Japanese secret service men in this country have also notified their government of our expedition. England also is in the race but the Scott expedition will not be ready for some time yet.\"  \"You think, then, that the Japs have secret agents keeping track of us?\" was Frank's next question.  The captain's reply was cut short by a loud crash. They all started up at the interruption. So intent had they been in their conversation that they had not noticed the Jap steward standing close behind them and his soft slippers had prevented them hearing his approach. The crash had been caused by a metal tray he had let drop. He now stood with as much vexation on his impassive countenance as it ever was possible for it to betray.  \"What on earth are you doing, Oyama?\" sharply questioned Captain Hazzard.  \"I was but about to inquire if the cap-it-an and the boys would not have some refreshments,\" rejoined the Jap.  \"Not now, we are busy,\" replied Captain Hazzard, with what was for him some show of irritation. \"Be off to your pantry now. I will ring if I want you.\"  With an obsequious bow the Jap withdrew; but if they could have seen his face as he turned into his small pantry, a cubby-hole for dishes and glasses, they would have noticed that it bore a most singular expression.  \"It seems curious that while we were talking of Jap secret service men that your man should have been right behind us,\" commented Frank. \"I don't know that I ought to ask such a question--but can you trust him?\"  The captain laughed.  \"Oh, implicitly,\" he said easily, \"Oyama was with me in the Philippines, and has always been a model of all that a good servant should be.\"  Soon after this the conference broke up, the boys having promised to have their aeroplane on board early the next day. Frank explained that the machine was all ready and in shape for shipping and all that remained to do was to \"knock it down,\" encase it in its boxes and get a wagon to haul it to the pier.  \"Say, Harry,\" said Frank earnestly, as the boys, having bade their leave of Captain Hazzard, who remained on board owing to press of business on the ship, made their way along the maze of wharves and toward a street car.  \"Say it,\" responded Harry cheerfully, his spirits at the tip-top of excitement at the idea of an almost immediate start for the polar regions.  \"Well, it's about that Jap.\"  \"Oh that yellow-faced bit of soft-footed putty--well, what about him?\"  \"Well, that 'yellow-faced bit of putty,' as you call him, is not so easily dismissed from my mind as all that. I'm pretty sure that he had some stronger reason than the one he gave for coming up behind us as silently as a cat while we were talking.\"  \"But Captain Hazzard says that he has had him for years. That he can trust him implicitly,\" protested Harry.  \"Just the same I can't get it out of my mind that there is something wrong about the fellow. I wish he hadn't seen that map and the proposed route of our expedition.\"  \"Oh bosh, you are thinking of what Captain Hazzard said about the Jap secret service. Our friend Oyama is much too thick to be a secret service man.\"  \"He simply looks unimpressive,\" rejoined Frank. \"For that reason alone he would make a good man for any such purpose.\"  \"Well, here comes a car,\" interrupted Harry, \"so let's board it and forget our Japanese friend. Depend upon it you'll find out that he is all O. K. long before we sight an iceberg.\"  \"I hope so, I'm sure,\" agreed Frank; but there was a troubled look on his face as he spoke.  However, not later than the next morning, as they were screwing up the last of the big blue cases that contained the various"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6973"],["title","The Boy Aviators' Polar Dash; or, Facing Death in the Antarctic (#2)"],["body","of the Golden Eagle, Billy Barnes, the young reporter who had accompanied the two boys in all of their expeditions, including the one to Nicaragua, where, with their aeroplane they helped make Central American history, as related in The Boy Aviators in Nicaragua; or, Leagued with the Insurgents,--Billy Barnes, the irrepressible, bounced into the garage which they used as a workshop, and which was situated in the rear of their house on Madison Avenue, with what proved to be important news of the Jap.  \"Aha, my young Scotts and Shackletons, I behold you on the verge of your departure for the land of perpetual ice, polar bears and Esquimaux,\" exclaimed the reporter, striking an attitude like that assumed by Commander Peary in some of his pictures.  \"Hullo, Billy Barnes,\" exclaimed both boys, continuing their work, as they were pretty well used to the young reporter's unceremonious calls, \"What brings you out so early?\"  \"Oh, a little story to cover in the Yorkville Court and I thought as I was up this way I'd drop off and pay my respects. Say, bring me back a polar bear skin, will you?\"  \"A polar bear skin?\" laughed Frank, \"why there aren't any polar bears at the South Pole.\"  \"No polar bears,\" repeated Billy lugubriously, \"what's the good of a pole without polar bears. Me for the frozen north then. I suppose you'll tell me next there are no natives at the South Pole either.\"  \"Well, there are not,\" rejoined Frank.  \"But there are sea-elephants and ice-leopards and--\" began Harry.  \"And sea-cats, I suppose,\" interrupted Billy.  \"No,\" exclaimed Harry, rather nettled at the young reporter's joking tone, \"but there is the ship of Olaf--\"  Frank was up like a shot.  \"Didn't we give our word to the Captain not to mention a word about that?\" he demanded.  \"That's so,\" assented Harry, abashed, \"but I just wanted to show this young person here that he can't treat our expedition with levity.\"  \"The ship of Olaf, eh?\" mused the young reporter, \"sounds like a story. Who was Olaf, if I may ask?\"  \"You may not ask,\" was Frank's rejoinder. \"As you know, Billy, we have been frank with you, of course under the pledge of secrecy which we know you too well to dream of your breaking. You know we are bound for the South Polar regions. You know also that the object of Captain Hazzard is to discover the pole, if possible; in any event to bring back scientific data of inestimable value; but there's one thing you don't know and of which we ourselves know very little, and that is the thing that Harry let slip.\"  \"All right, Frank,\" said the young reporter, readily, \"I won't say any more about it, only it did sound as if it had possibilities. Hullo! ten o'clock; I've got to be jogging along.\"  \"What are you going to court about?\" inquired Frank.  \"Oh, a small case. Doesn't look as if it would amount to a row of pins. A Jap who was arrested last night, more for safe-keeping than anything else, I guess. He was found near the consulate of his country and appeared to be under the influence of some drug. Anyhow, he couldn't look after himself, so a policeman took him to a station-house. Of course, there might be a story back of it and that's why I'm on the job.\"  \"A Jap, eh?\" mused Frank curiously.  \"Yes; do you number any among your acquaintance?\" inquired Billy.  \"Well, we do number one; don't we, Harry?\" laughed Frank.  At that moment the telephone bell rang sharply in the booth erected in the workshop in order to keep out noise when anyone was conversing over the wire.  \"Wait a second, I'll see what that call is,\" exclaimed Frank, bolting into the booth. He was in it several seconds and when he came out his face was flushed and he seemed excited.  \"What's the matter--trouble?\" inquired Billy, noting his apparent perturbation.  \"Yes, it is trouble in a way,\" assented Frank, \"I guess we'll take a run to court with you and look over this Jap of yours, Billy.\"  \"Think you know him?\"  \"That's just what I want to see.\"  \"You seem very anxious about it. Anything wrong?\"  \"Yes, very wrong. That was Captain Hazzard on the wire, and a mysterious theft has occurred on the Southern Cross.\"     CHAPTER III.  OFF FOR THE SOUTH POLE.   The court-room was crowded as the boys entered it, but armed with Billy's police card they soon made their way through a rail that separated the main body of the place from the space within which the magistrate was seated. On the way over Frank had related his conversation over the wire with Captain Hazzard. It appeared that Oyama, the Jap, was missing and that several papers bearing on the objects of the expedition which were,--except in a general way,--a mystery to the boys themselves, had been stolen.  Putting two and two together, Frank had made up his mind that the Jap whose case Billy had been assigned to investigate was none other than Oyama himself, and as they entered the space described above his eyes eagerly swept the row of prisoners seated in the \"Pen.\"  \"I was sure of it,\" the boy exclaimed as his eyes encountered an abject, huddled-up figure seated next a ragged, besotted-looking tramp.  \"Sure of what?\" demanded Harry.  \"Why, that Oyama was the man who stole the papers from the Southern Cross.\"  \"Well?\"  \"Well, there he is now.\"  Frank indicated the abject object in the corner who at the same moment raised a yellow face and bloodshot eyes and gazed blearily at him. There was no sign of recognition in the face, however. In fact the Jap appeared to be in a stupor of some sort.  \"Is that little Jap known to you?\"  Frank turned: a gray moustached man with a red face and keen eyes was regarding him and had put the question.  \"He is--yes,\" replied the boy, \"but----\"  \"Oh, you need not hesitate to talk to me,\" replied the stranger, \"I am Dr. McGuire, the prison surgeon, and I take a professional interest in his case. The man is stupefied with opium or some drug that seems to have numbed his senses.\"  \"Do you think it was self-administered?\" asked the boy.  \"Oh, undoubtedly. Those fellows go on regular opium debauches sometimes. In this case perhaps it is very fortunate for some one that he was imprudent enough to take such heavy doses of the drug that the policeman picked him up, for a lot of papers were found on him. They are meaningless to me, but perhaps you can throw some light on them.\"  \"The papers, we believe, are the property of Captain Hazzard, the head of the government's South Polar expedition,\" exclaimed Frank, whose suspicions had rapidly become convictions at the sight of the Jap. \"We have no right to examine into their contents, but I suppose there would be no harm in our looking at them to make sure. I can then notify the Captain.\"  \"You are friends of his?\"  \"We are attached to the expedition,\" replied Frank, \"but I must ask you not to mention it, as I do not know but we are breaking our promise of secrecy even in such an important matter as this.\"  \"You can depend that I shall not violate your confidence,\" promised Dr. McGuire.  It was the matter of few moments only to secure the papers from the court clerk. There was quite a bundle of them, some of them sealed. Apparently the thief, elated over his success in stealing them, had indulged himself in his beloved drug before he had even taken the trouble to examine fully into his finds. One paper, however, had been opened and seemed to be, as Frank could not help noticing, a sort of document containing \"General Orders\" to the expedition.  It consisted of several closely typewritten pages, and on the first one Frank lit on the magic words,--\"--AND CONCERNING THE SHIP OF OLAF, THE VIKING ROVER, YOU WILL PROCEED ACROSS THE BARRIER, USING ALL DISCRETION, AS A RIVAL NATION HAS ALSO SOME INKLING OF THE PRESENCE OF THE LONG-LOST VESSEL AND,--\"  Though the boy would have given a good deal to do so he felt that he could not honorably read more. He resolutely, therefore, closed the paper and restored it to its place in the mass of other documents. There was, of course, no question that the papers were the property of Captain Hazzard, and that the Jap had stolen them. The latter was therefore sentenced to spend the next six weeks on Blackwell's Island, by the expiration of which time the Southern Cross would be well on her voyage toward The Great Barrier.  As the boys left the court, having been told that Captain Hazzard's papers would be sealed and restored him when he called for them and made a formal demand for their delivery, they were deep in excited talk.  \"Well, if this doesn't beat all,\" exclaimed Frank, \"we always seem to be getting snarled up with those chaps. You remember what a tussle they gave us in the Everglades.\"  \"Not likely to forget it,\" was the brief rejoinder from Harry.  \"I'll never forget winging that submarine of Captain Bellman's,\" put in Billy.  \"Well, boys, exciting as our experiences were down there, I think that we are on the verge of adventures and perils that will make them look insignificant,\" exclaimed Frank.  \"Don't,\" groaned Billy.  \"Don't what?\"  \"Don't talk that way. Here am I a contented reporter working hard and hoping that some day my opportunity will come and I shall be a great writer or statesman or something and then you throw me off my base by talking about adventure,\" was the indignant response.  \"Upon my word, Billy Barnes, I think you are hinting that you would like to come along.\"  \"Well, would that be so very curious. Oh cracky! If I only could get a chance.\"  \"You think you could get a leave of absence?\"  \"Two of 'em. But what's the use,\" Billy broke off with a groan, \"Captain Hazzard wouldn't have me and that's all there is to it. No, I'll be stuck here in New York while you fellows are shooting Polar bears--oh, I forgot, there aren't any,--well, anyhow, while you're having a fine time,--just my luck.\"  \"If you aren't the most contrary chap,\" laughed Frank. \"Here a short time ago you never even dreamed of coming and now you talk as if you'd been expecting to go right along, and had been meanly deprived"]]]
