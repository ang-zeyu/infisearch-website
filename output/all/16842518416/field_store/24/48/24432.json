The great desire of the soul for immortality, its     secret, innate horror of annihilation, has been brought     to prove its immortality. But do we always find this     horror or this desire? Is it not much more evident     that the great majority of mankind have no such dread     at all? True that there is a strong feeling of horror     excited by the idea of perishing from the earth and     being forgotten, of losing all those honors and all     that fame awaited them. Many feel this secret horror     when they look down upon the vale of futurity and     reflect that though now the idols of the world, soon     all which will be left them will be the common portion     of mankind--oblivion! But this dread does not arise     from any idea of their destiny beyond the tomb, and     even were this true, it would afford no proof that     the mind would exist forever, merely from its strong     desires. For it might with as much correctness be     argued that the body will exist forever because we have     a great dread of dying, and upon this principle nothing     which we strongly desire would ever be withheld from     us, and no evil that we greatly dread will ever come     upon us, a principle evidently false.      Again, it has been said that the constant progression     of the powers of the mind affords another proof of its     immortality. Concerning this, Addison remarks, \"Were a     human soul ever thus at a stand in her acquirements,     were her faculties to be full blown and incapable of     further enlargement, I could imagine that she might     fall away insensibly and drop at once into a state     of annihilation. But can we believe a thinking being     that is in a perpetual progress of improvement, and     traveling on from perfection to perfection after having     just looked abroad into the works of her Creator and     made a few discoveries of his infinite wisdom and     goodness, must perish at her first setting out and in     the very beginning of her inquiries?\"      In answer to this it may be said that the soul is not     always progressing in her powers. Is it not rather a     subject of general remark that those brilliant talents     which in youth expand, in manhood become stationary,     and in old age gradually sink to decay? Till when the     ancient man descends to the tomb scarce a wreck of that     once powerful mind remains.      Who, but upon reading the history of England, does not     look with awe upon the effects produced by the talents     of her Elizabeth? Who but admires that undaunted     firmness in time of peace and that profound depth     of policy which she displayed in the cabinet? Yet     behold the tragical end of this learned, this politic     princess! Behold the triumphs of age and sickness     over her once powerful talents, and say not that the     faculties of man are always progressing in their powers.      From the activity of the mind at the hour of death has     also been deduced its immortality. But it is not true     that the mind is always active at the time of death. We     find recorded in history numberless instances of those     talents, which were once adequate to the government of     a nation, being so weakened and palsied by the touch     of sickness as scarcely to tell to beholders what they     once were. The talents of the statesman, the wisdom of     the sage, the courage and might of the warrior, are     instantly destroyed by it, and all that remains of them     is the waste of idiocy or the madness of insanity.      Some minds there are who at the time of death retain     their faculties though much impaired, and if the     argument be valid these are the only cases where     immortality is conferred. Again, it is urged that the     inequality of rewards and punishments in this world     demand another in which virtue may be rewarded and vice     punished. This argument, in the first place, takes     for its foundation that by the light of nature the     distinction between virtue and vice can be discovered.     By some this is absolutely disbelieved, and by all     considered as extremely doubtful. And, secondly, it     puts the Creator under an obligation to reward and     punish the actions of his creatures. No such obligation     exists, and therefore the argument cannot be valid. And     this supposes the Creator to be a being of justice,     which cannot by the light of nature be proved, and     as the whole argument rests upon this foundation it     certainly cannot be correct.      This argument also directly impeaches the wisdom of the     Creator, for the sense of it is this,--that, forasmuch     as he was not able to manage his government in this     world, he must have another in which to rectify the     mistakes and oversights of this, and what an idea would     this give us of our All-wise Creator?      It is also said that all nations have some conceptions     of a future state, that the ancient Greeks and Romans     believed in it, that no nation has been found but have     possessed some idea of a future state of existence.     But their belief arose more from the fact that they     wished it to be so than from any real ground of belief;     for arguments appear much more plausible when the mind     wishes to be convinced. But it is said that every     nation, however circumstanced, possess some idea of     a future state. For this we may account by the fact     that it was handed down by tradition from the time of     the flood. From all these arguments, which, however     plausible at first sight, are found to be futile, may     be argued the necessity of a revelation. Without it,     the destiny of the noblest of the works of God would     have been left in obscurity. Never till the blessed     light of the Gospel dawned on the borders of the pit,     and the heralds of the Cross proclaimed \"Peace on earth     and good will to men,\" was it that bewildered and     misled man was enabled to trace his celestial origin     and glorious destiny.      The sun of the Gospel has dispelled the darkness that     has rested on objects beyond the tomb. In the Gospel     man learned that when the dust returned to dust the     spirit fled to the God who gave it. He there found     that though man has lost the image of his divine     Creator, he is still destined, after this earthly house     of his tabernacle is dissolved, to an inheritance     incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, to     a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.  Soon after the writing of this remarkable composition, Harriet's child-life in Litchfield came to an end, for that same year she went to Hartford to pursue her studies in a school which had been recently established by her sister Catherine in that city.     CHAPTER II.  SCHOOL DAYS IN HARTFORD, 1824-1832.      MISS CATHERINE BEECHER.--PROFESSOR FISHER.--THE WRECK     OF THE ALBION AND DEATH OF PROFESSOR FISHER.--\"THE     MINISTER'S WOOING.\"--MISS CATHERINE BEECHER'S SPIRITUAL     HISTORY.--MRS. STOWE'S RECOLLECTIONS OF HER SCHOOL     DAYS IN HARTFORD.--HER CONVERSION.--UNITES WITH THE     FIRST CHURCH IN HARTFORD.--HER DOUBTS AND SUBSEQUENT     RELIGIOUS DEVELOPMENT.--HER FINAL PEACE.   THE school days in Hartford began a new era in Harriet's life. It was the formative period, and it is therefore important to say a few words concerning her sister Catherine, under whose immediate supervision she was to continue her education. In fact, no one can comprehend either Mrs. Stowe or her writings without some knowledge of the life and character of this remarkable woman, whose strong, vigorous mind and tremendous personality indelibly stamped themselves on the sensitive, yielding, dreamy, and poetic nature of the younger sister. Mrs. Stowe herself has said that the two persons who most strongly influenced her at this period of her life were her brother Edward and her sister Catherine.  Catherine was the oldest child of Lyman Beecher and Roxanna Foote, his wife. In a little battered journal found among her papers is a short sketch of her life, written when she was seventy-six years of age. In a tremulous hand she begins: \"I was born at East Hampton, L. I., September 5, 1800, at 5 P. M., in the large parlor opposite father's study. Don't remember much about it myself.\" The sparkle of wit in this brief notice of the circumstances of her birth is very characteristic. All through her life little ripples of fun were continually playing on the surface of that current of intense thought and feeling in which her deep, earnest nature flowed.  When she was ten years of age her father removed to Litchfield, Conn., and her happy girlhood was passed in that place. Her bright and versatile mind and ready wit enabled her to pass brilliantly through her school days with but little mental exertion, and those who knew her slightly might have imagined her to be only a bright, thoughtless, light-hearted girl. In Boston, at the age of twenty, she took lessons in music and drawing, and became so proficient in these branches as to secure a position as teacher in a young ladies' school, kept by a Rev. Mr. Judd, an Episcopal clergyman, at New London, Conn. About this time she formed the acquaintance of Professor Alexander Metcalf Fisher, of Yale College, one of the most distinguished young men in New England. In January of the year 1822 they became engaged, and the following spring Professor Fisher sailed for Europe to purchase books and scientific apparatus for the use of his department in the college.  In his last letter to Miss Beecher, dated March 31, 1822, he writes:--  \"I set out at 10 precisely to-morrow, in the Albion for Liverpool; the ship has no superior in the whole number of excellent vessels belonging to this port, and Captain Williams is regarded as"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6702"],["title","Life of Harriet Beecher Stowe (#5)"],["body","on their list of commanders. The accommodations are admirable--fare $140. Unless our ship should speak some one bound to America on the passage, you will probably not hear from me under two months.\"  Before two months had passed came vague rumors of a terrible shipwreck on the coast of Ireland. Then the tidings that the Albion was lost. Then came a letter from Mr. Pond, at Kinsale, Ireland, dated May 2, 1822:--  \"You have doubtless heard of the shipwreck of the Albion packet of New York, bound to Liverpool. It was a melancholy shipwreck. It happened about four o'clock on the morning of the 22d of April. Professor Fisher, of Yale College, was one of the passengers. Out of twenty-three cabin passengers, but one reached the shore. He is a Mr. Everhart, of Chester County, Pennsylvania. He informs me that Professor Fisher was injured by things that fetched away in the cabin at the time the ship was knocked down. This was between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening of the twenty-first. Mr. Fisher, though badly bruised, was calm and resolute, and assisted Captain Williams by taking the injured compass to his berth and repairing it. About five minutes before the vessel struck Captain Williams informed the passengers of their danger, and all went on deck except Professor Fisher, who remained sitting in his berth. Mr. Everhart was the last person who left the cabin, and the last who ever saw Professor Fisher alive.\"  I should not have spoken of this incident of family history with such minuteness, except for the fact that it is so much a part of Mrs. Stowe's life as to make it impossible to understand either her character or her most important works without it. Without this incident \"The Minister's Wooing\" never would have been written, for both Mrs. Marvyn's terrible soul struggles and old Candace's direct and effective solution of all religious difficulties find their origin in this stranded, storm-beaten ship on the coast of Ireland, and the terrible mental conflicts through which her sister afterward passed, for she believed Professor Fisher eternally lost. No mind more directly and powerfully influenced Harriet's than that of her sister Catherine, unless it was her brother Edward's, and that which acted with such overwhelming power on the strong, unyielding mind of the older sister must have, in time, a permanent and abiding influence on the mind of the younger.  After Professor Fisher's death his books came into Miss Beecher's possession, and among them was a complete edition of Scott's works. It was an epoch in the family history when Doctor Beecher came down-stairs one day with a copy of \"Ivanhoe\" in his hand, and said: \"I have always said that my children should not read novels, but they must read these.\"  The two years following the death of Professor Fisher were passed by Miss Catherine Beecher at Franklin, Mass., at the home of Professor Fisher's parents, where she taught his two sisters, studied mathematics with his brother Willard, and listened to Doctor Emmons' fearless and pitiless preaching. Hers was a mind too strong and buoyant to be crushed and prostrated by that which would have driven a weaker and less resolute nature into insanity. Of her it may well be said:--      \"She faced the spectres of the mind      And laid them, thus she came at length      To find a stronger faith her own.\"  Gifted naturally with a capacity for close metaphysical analysis and a robust fearlessness in following her premises to a logical conclusion, she arrived at results startling and original, if not always of permanent value.  In 1840 she published in the \"Biblical Repository\" an article on Free Agency, which has been acknowledged by competent critics as the ablest refutation of Edwards on \"The Will\" which has appeared. An amusing incident connected with this publication may not be out of place here. A certain eminent theological professor of New England, visiting a distinguished German theologian and speaking of this production, said: \"The ablest refutation of Edwards on 'The Will' which was ever written is the work of a woman, the daughter of Dr. Lyman Beecher.\" The worthy Teuton raised both hands in undisguised astonishment. \"You have a woman that can write an able refutation of Edwards on 'The Will'? God forgive Christopher Columbus for discovering America!\"  Not finding herself able to love a God whom she thought of in her own language as \"a perfectly happy being, unmoved by my sorrows or tears, and looking upon me only with dislike and aversion,\" she determined \"to find happiness in living to do good.\" \"It was right to pray and read the Bible, so I prayed and read. It was right to try to save others, so I labored for their salvation. I never had any fear of punishment or hope of reward all these years.\" She was tormented with doubts. \"What has the Son of God done which the meanest and most selfish creature upon earth would not have done? After making such a wretched race and placing them in such disastrous circumstances, somehow, without any sorrow or trouble, Jesus Christ had a human nature that suffered and died. If something else besides ourselves will do all the suffering, who would not save millions of wretched beings and receive all the honor and gratitude without any of the trouble? Sometimes when such thoughts passed through my mind, I felt that it was all pride, rebellion, and sin.\"  So she struggles on, sometimes floundering deep in the mire of doubt, and then lifted for the moment above it by her naturally buoyant spirits, and general tendency to look on the bright side of things. In this condition of mind, she came to Hartford in the winter of 1824, and began a school with eight scholars, and it was in the practical experience of teaching that she found a final solution of all her difficulties. She continues:--  \"After two or three years I commenced giving instruction in mental philosophy, and at the same time began a regular course of lectures and instructions from the Bible, and was much occupied with plans for governing my school, and in devising means to lead my pupils to become obedient, amiable, and pious. By degrees I finally arrived at the following principles in the government of my school:--  \"First. It is indispensable that my scholars should feel that I am sincerely and deeply interested in their best happiness, and the more I can convince them of this, the more ready will be their obedience.  \"Second. The preservation of authority and order depends upon the certainty that unpleasant consequences to themselves will inevitably be the result of doing wrong.  \"Third. It is equally necessary, to preserve my own influence and their affection, that they should feel that punishment is the natural result of wrong-doing in such a way that they shall regard themselves, instead of me, as the cause of their punishment.  \"Fourth. It is indispensable that my scholars should see that my requisitions are reasonable. In the majority of cases this can be shown, and in this way such confidence will be the result that they will trust to my judgment and knowledge, in cases where no explanation can be given.  \"Fifth. The more I can make my scholars feel that I am actuated by a spirit of self-denying benevolence, the more confidence they will feel in me, and the more they will be inclined to submit to self-denying duties for the good of others.  \"After a while I began to compare my experience with the government of God. I finally got through the whole subject, and drew out the results, and found that all my difficulties were solved and all my darkness dispelled.\"  Her solution in brief is nothing more than that view of the divine nature which was for so many years preached by her brother, Henry Ward Beecher, and set forth in the writings of her sister Harriet,--the conception of a being of infinite love, patience, and kindness who suffers with man. The sufferings of Christ on the cross were not the sufferings of his human nature merely, but the sufferings of the divine nature in Him. In Christ we see the only revelation of God, and that is the revelation of one that suffers. This is the fundamental idea in \"The Minister's Wooing,\" and it is the idea of God in which the storm-tossed soul of the older sister at last found rest. All this was directly opposed to that fundamental principle of theologians that God, being the infinitely perfect Being, cannot suffer, because suffering indicates imperfection. To Miss Beecher's mind the lack of ability to suffer with his suffering creatures was a more serious imperfection. Let the reader turn to the twenty-fourth chapter of \"The Minister's Wooing\" for a complete presentation of this subject, especially the passage that begins, \"Sorrow is divine: sorrow is reigning on the throne of the universe.\"  In the fall of the year 1824, while her sister Catherine was passing through the soul crisis which we have been describing, Harriet came to the school that she had recently established.  In a letter to her son written in 1886, speaking of this period of her life, Mrs. Stowe says: \"Somewhere between my twelfth and thirteenth year I was placed under the care of my elder sister Catherine, in the school that she had just started in Hartford, Connecticut. When I entered the school there were not more than twenty-five scholars in it, but it afterwards numbered its pupils by the hundreds. The school-room was on Main Street, nearly opposite Christ Church, over Sheldon & Colton's harness store, at the sign of the two white horses. I never shall forget the pleasure and surprise which these two white horses produced in my mind when I first saw them. One of the young men who worked in the rear of the harness store had a most beautiful tenor voice, and it was my delight to hear him singing in school hours:--  [Illustration: Catherine E. Beecher]      'When in cold oblivion's shade      Beauty, wealth, and power are laid,      When, around the sculptured shrine,      Moss shall cling and ivy"]]]
