Ah friend, what gift of man's does not?   No nearer something, by a jot,   Rise an infinity of nothings     Than one: take Euclid for your teacher:   Distinguish kinds: do crownings, clothings,     Make that creator which was creature?   Multiply gifts upon man's head,   And what, when all's done, shall be said   But--the more gifted he, I ween!     That one's made Christ, this other, Pilate,   And this might be all that has been,--     So what is there to frown or smile at?   What is left for us, save, in growth   Of soul, to rise up, far past both,   From the gift looking to the giver,   And from the cistern to the river,   And from the finite to infinity,   And from man's dust to God's divinity?     XVII    Take all in a word: the truth in God's breast   Lies trace for trace upon curs impressed:   Though he is so bright and we so dim,   We are made in his image to witness him:   And were no eye in us to tell,     Instructed by no inner sense,   The light of heaven from the dark of hell,     That light would want its evidence,--   Though justice, good and truth were still   Divine, if, by some demon's will,   Hatred and wrong had been proclaimed   Law through the worlds, and right misnamed.   No mere exposition of morality   Made or in part or in totality,   Should win you to give it worship, therefore:   And, if no better proof you will care for,   --Whom do you count the worst man upon earth?     Be sure, he knows, in his conscience, more   Of what right is, than arrives at birth     In the best man's acts that we bow before:   This last knows better--true, but my fact is,   'Tis one thing to know, and another to practise.   And thence I conclude that the real God-function   Is to furnish a motive and injunction   For practising what we know already.   And such an injunction and such a motive   As the God in Christ, do you waive, and \"heady,   \"High-minded,\" hang your tablet-votive   Outside the fane on a finger-post?   Morality to the uttermost,   Supreme in Christ as we all confess,   Why need we prove would avail no jot   To make him God, if God he were not?   What is the point where himself lays stress?   Does the precept run \"Believe in good,   \"In justice, truth, now understood   \"For the first time?\"--or, \"Believe in me,   \"Who lived and died, yet essentially   \"Am Lord of Life?\" Whoever can take   The same to his heart and for mere love's sake   Conceive of the love,--that man obtains   A new truth; no conviction gains   Of an old one only, made intense   By a fresh appeal to his faded sense.     XVIII    Can it be that he stays inside?     Is the vesture left me to commune with?     Could my soul find aught to sing in tune with   Even at this lecture, if she tried?   Oh, let me at lowest sympathize   With the lurking drop of blood that lies   In the desiccated brain's white roots   Without throb for Christ's attributes,   As the lecturer makes his special boast!   If love's dead there, it has left a ghost.   Admire we, how from heart to brain     (Though to say so strike the doctors dumb)   One instinct rises and falls again,     Restoring the equilibrium.   And how when the Critic had done his best,   And the pearl of price, at reason's test,   Lay dust and ashes levigable   On the Professor's lecture-table,--   When we looked for the inference and monition   That our faith, reduced to such condition,   Be swept forthwith to its natural dust-hole,--     He bids us, when we least expect it,   Take back our faith,--if it be not just whole,     Yet a pearl indeed, as his tests affect it,   Which fact pays damage done rewardingly,   So, prize we our dust and ashes accordingly!   \"Go home and venerate the myth   \"I thus have experimented with--   \"This man, continue to adore him   \"Rather than all who went before him,   \"And all who ever followed after!\"--     Surely for this I may praise you, my brother!   Will you take the praise in tears or laughter?     That's one point gained: can I compass another?   Unlearned love was safe from spurning--   Can't we respect your loveless learning?   Let us at least give learning honour!   What laurels had we showered upon her,   Girding her loins up to perturb   Our theory of the Middle Verb;   Or Turk-like brandishing a scimitar   O'er anapasts in comic-trimeter;   Or curing the halt and maimed 'Iketides,'   [Footnote: \"The Suppliants,\" a fragment of a play by Aeschylus.]   While we lounged on at our indebted ease:   Instead of which, a tricksy demon   Sets her at Titus or Philemon!   When ignorance wags his ears of leather   And hates God's word, 'tis altogether;   Nor leaves he his congenial thistles   To go and browse on Paul's Epistles.   --And you, the audience, who might ravage   The world wide, enviably savage,   Nor heed the cry of the retriever,   More than Herr Heine (before his fever),--   I do not tell a lie so arrant     As say my passion's wings are furled up,   And, without plainest heavenly warrant,     I were ready and glad to give the world up--   But still, when you rub brow meticulous,     And ponder the profit of turning holy     If not for God's, for your own sake solely,   --God forbid I should find you ridiculous!   Deduce from this lecture all that eases you,   Nay, call yourselves, if the calling pleases you,   \"Christians,\"--abhor the deist's pravity,--   Go on, you shall no more move my gravity   Than, when I see boys ride a-cockhorse,   I find it in my heart to embarrass them   By hinting that their stick's a mock horse,   And they really carry what they say carries them.     XIX    So sat I talking with my mind.     I did not long to leave the door     And find a new church, as before,   But rather was quiet and inclined   To prolong and enjoy the gentle resting   From further tracking and trying and testing.   \"This tolerance is a genial mood!\"   (Said I, and a little pause ensued).   \"One trims the bark 'twixt shoal and shelf,     \"And sees, each side, the good effects of it,   \"A value for religion's self,     \"A carelessness about the sects of it.   \"Let me enjoy my own conviction,     \"Not watch my neighbour's faith with fretfulness,   \"Still spying there some dereliction     \"Of truth, perversity, forgetfulness!\"   Better a mild indifferentism,     \"Teaching that both our faiths (though duller   \"His shine through a dull spirit's prism)     \"Originally had one colour!   \"Better pursue a pilgrimage     \"Through ancient and through modern times     \"To many peoples, various climes,   \"Where I may see saint, savage, sage   \"Fuse their respective creeds in one   \"Before the general Father's throne!\"     XX    --'Twas the horrible storm began afresh!   The black night caught me in his mesh,   Whirled me up, and flung me prone.   I was left on the college-step alone.   I looked, and far there, ever fleeting   Far, far away, the receding gesture,   And looming of the lessening vesture!--   Swept forward from my stupid hand,   While I watched my foolish heart expand   In the lazy glow of benevolence,     O'er the various modes of man's belief.   I sprang up with fear's vehemence.     Needs must there be one way, our chief   Best way of worship: let me strive   To find it, and when found, contrive   My fellows also take their share!   This constitutes my earthly care:   God's is above it and distinct.   For I, a man, with men am linked   But not a brute with brutes; no gain   That I experience, must remain   Unshared: but should my best endeavour   To share it, fail--subsisteth ever   God's care above, and I exult   That God, by God's own ways occult,   May--doth, I will believe--bring back   All wanderers to a single track.   Meantime, I can but testify   God's care for me--no more, can I--   It is but for myself I know;     The world rolls witnessing around me     Only to leave me as it found me;   Men cry there, but my ear is slow:   There races flourish or decay   --What boots it, while yon lucid way   Loaded with stars divides the vault?   But soon my soul repairs its fault   When, sharpening sense's hebetude,   She turns on my own life! So viewed,   No mere mote's-breadth but teems immense   With witnessings of providence:   And woe to me if when I look   Upon that record, the sole book   Unsealed to me, I take no heed   Of any warning that I read!   Have I been sure, this Christmas-Eve,   God's own hand did the rainbow weave,   Whereby the truth from heaven slid   Into my soul?--I cannot bid   The world admit he stooped to heal   My soul, as if in a thunder-peal   Where one heard noise, and one saw flame,   I only knew he named my name:   But what is the world to me, for sorrow   Or joy in its censure, when to-morrow   It drops the remark, with just-turned head   Then, on again, 'That man is dead'?   Yes, but for me--my name called,--drawn   As a conscript's lot from the lap's black yawn,   He has dipt into on a battle-dawn:   Bid out of life by a nod, a glance,--   Stumbling, mute-mazed, at nature's chance,   With a rapid finger circled round,   Fixed to the first poor inch of ground   To fight from, where his foot was found;   Whose ear but a minute"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6670"],["title","Christmas Eve (#5)"],["body","lay free   To the wide camp's buzz and gossipry--   Summoned, a solitary man   To end his life where his life began,   From the safe glad rear, to the dreadful van!   Soul of mine, hadst thou caught and held   By the hem of the vesture!--     XXI                                And I caught   At the flying robe, and unrepelled     Was lapped again in its folds full-fraught   With warmth and wonder and delight,   God's mercy being infinite.   For scarce had the words escaped my tongue,   When, at a passionate bound, I sprung,   Out of the wandering world of rain,   Into the little chapel again.     XXII    How else was I found there, bolt upright     On my bench, as if I had never left it?   --Never flung out on the common at night,     Nor met the storm and wedge-like cleft it,   Seen the raree-show of Peter's successor,   Or the laboratory of the Professor!   For the Vision, that was true, I wist,   True as that heaven and earth exist.   There sat my friend, the yellow and tall,   With his neck and its wen in the selfsame place;   Yet my nearest neighbour's cheek showed gall.     She had slid away a contemptuous space:   And the old fat woman, late so placable,   Eyed me with symptoms hardly mistakable,   Of her milk of kindness turning rancid.   In short, a spectator might have fancied   That I had nodded, betrayed by slumber.   Yet kept my scat, a warning ghastly,   Through the heads of the sermon, nine in number,   And woke up now at the tenth and lastly.   But again, could such disgrace have happened?     Each friend at my elbow had surely nudged it;   And, as for the sermon, where did my nap end?     Unless I heard it, could I have judged it?   Could I report as I do at the close,   First, the preacher speaks through his nose:   Second, his gesture is too emphatic:     Thirdly, to waive what's pedagogic,     The subject-matter itself lacks logic:   Fourthly, the English is ungrammatic.   Great news! the preacher is found no Pascal,   Whom, if I pleased, I might to the task call   Of making square to a finite eye   The circle of infinity,   And find so all-but-just-succeeding!   Great news! the sermon proves no reading   Where bee-like in the flowers I bury me,   Like Taylor's the immortal Jeremy!   And now that I know the very worst of him,   What was it I thought to obtain at first of him?   Ha! Is God mocked, as he asks,   Shall I take on me to change his tasks,   And dare, despatched to a river-head     For a simple draught of the element,     Neglect the thing for which he sent,   And return with another thing instead?--   Saying, \"Because the water found   \"Welling up from the underground,   \"Is mingled with the taints of earth,   \"While thou, I know, dost laugh at dearth,   \"And couldst, at wink or word, convulse   \"The world with the leap of a river-pulse,--   \"Therefore I turned from the oozings muddy,     \"And bring thee a chalice I found, instead;   \"See the brave veins in the breccia ruddy!     \"One would suppose that the marble bled.   \"What matters the water? A hope I have nursed:     \"The waterless cup will quench my thirst.\"   --Better have knelt at the poorest stream   That trickles in pain from the straitest rift!   For the less or the more is all God's gift,   Who blocks up or breaks wide the granite-seam.   And here, is there water or not, to drink?   I then, in ignorance and weakness,   Taking God's help, have attained to think   My heart does best to receive in meekness   That mode of worship, as most to his mind,   Where earthly aids being cast behind,   His All in All appears serene   With the thinnest human veil between,   Letting the mystic lamps, the seven,   The many motions of his spirit,   Pass, as they list, to earth from heaven.   For the preacher's merit or demerit,   It were to be wished the flaws were fewer   In the earthen vessel, holding treasure   Which lies as safe in a golden ewer;     But the main thing is, does it hold good measure?   Heaven soon sets right all other matters!--     Ask, else, these ruins of humanity,   This flesh worn out to rags and tatters,     This soul at struggle with insanity,   Who thence take comfort--can I doubt?--   Which an empire gained were a loss without.   May it be mine! And let us hope   That no worse blessing befall the Pope,   Turned sick at last of to-day's buffoonery,     Of posturings and petticoatings,     Beside his Bourbon bully's gloatings   In the bloody orgies of drunk poltroonery!   Nor may the Professor forego its peace     At Gottingen presently, when, in the dusk   Of his life, if his cough, as I fear, should increase,     Prophesied of by that horrible husk--   When thicker and thicker the darkness fills   The world through his misty spectacles,   And he gropes for something more substantial     Than a fable, myth or personification,--   May Christ do for him what no mere man shall,     And stand confessed as the God of salvation!   Meantime, in the still recurring fear     Lest myself, at unawares, be found,     While attacking the choice of my neighbours round,   With none of my own made--I choose here!   The giving out of the hymn reclaims me;   I have done: and if any blames me,   Thinking that merely to touch in brevity     The topics I dwell on, were unlawful,--   Or worse, that I trench, with undue levity,     On the bounds of the holy and the awful,--   I praise the heart, and pity the head of him,   And refer myself to THEE, instead of him,   Who head and heart alike discernest     Looking below light speech we utter,     When frothy spume and frequent sputter   Prove that the soul's depths boil in earnest!   May truth shine out, stand ever before us!   I put up pencil and join chorus   To Hepzibah Tune, without further apology,     The last five verses of the third section     Of the seventeenth hymn of Whitfield's Collection,   To conclude with the doxology."]]]
