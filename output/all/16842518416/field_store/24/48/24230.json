And your papa is away, is he not, Elsie?\"  \"Yes, ma'am; he is in Europe. He has been away almost ever since I was born, and I have never seen him. Oh! how I do wish he would come home! how I long to see him! Do you think he would love me, Miss Allison? Do you think he would take me on his knee and pet me, as grandpa does Enna?\"  \"I should think he would, dear; I don't know how he could help loving his own dear little girl,\" said the lady, again kissing the little rosy cheek. \"But now,\" she added, rising, \"I must go away and let you learn your lesson.\"  Then taking up the little Bible, and turning over the leaves, she asked, \"Would you like to come to my room sometimes in the mornings and evenings, and read this book with me, Elsie?\"  \"Oh! yes, ma'am, dearly!\" exclaimed the child, her eyes sparkling with pleasure.  \"Come then this evening, if you like; and now goodbye for the present.\" And pressing another kiss on the child's cheek, she left her and went back to her own room, where she found her friend Adelaide Dinsmore, a young lady near her own age, and the eldest daughter of the family. Adelaide was seated on a sofa, busily employed with some fancy work.  \"You see I am making myself quite at home,\" she said, looking up as Rose entered. \"I cannot imagine where you have been all this time.\"  \"Can you not? In the school-room, talking with little Elsie. Do you know, Adelaide, I thought she was your sister; but she tells me not.\"  \"No, she is Horace's child. I supposed you knew; but if you do not, I may just as well tell you the whole story. Horace was a very wild boy, petted and spoiled, and always used to having his own way; and when he was about seventeen--quite a forward youth he was too--he must needs go to New Orleans to spend some months with a schoolmate; and there he met, and fell desperately in love with, a very beautiful girl a year or two younger than himself, an orphan and very wealthy. Fearing that objections would be made on the score of their youth, etc., etc., he persuaded her to consent to a private marriage, and they had been man and wife for some months before either her friends or his suspected it.  \"Well, when it came at last to papa's ears, he was very angry, both on account of their extreme youth, and because, as Elsie Grayson's father had made all his money by trade, he did not consider her quite my brother's equal; so he called Horace home and sent him North to college. Then he studied law, and since that he has been traveling in foreign lands. But to return to his wife; it seems that her guardian was quite as much opposed to the match as papa; and the poor girl was made to believe that she should never see her husband again. All their letters were intercepted, and finally she was told that he was dead; so, as Aunt Chloe says, 'she grew thin and pale, and weak and melancholy,' and while the little Elsie was yet not quite a week old, she died. We never saw her; she died in her guardian's house, and there the little Elsie stayed in charge of Aunt Chloe, who was an old servant in the family, and had nursed her mother before her, and of the housekeeper, Mrs. Murray, a pious old Scotch woman, until about four years ago, when her guardian's death broke up the family, and then they came to us. Horace never comes home, and does not seem to care for his child, for he never mentions her in his letters, except when it is necessary in the way of business.\"  \"She is a dear little thing,\" said Rose. \"I am sure he could not help loving her, if he could only see her.\"  \"Oh! yes, she is well enough, and I often feel sorry for the lonely little thing, but the truth is, I believe we are a little jealous of her; she is so extremely beautiful, and heiress to such an immense fortune. Mamma often frets, and says that one of these days she will quite eclipse her younger daughters.\"  \"But then,\" said Rose, \"she is almost as near; her own grand-daughter.\"  \"No, she is not so very near,\" replied Adelaide, \"for Horace is not mamma's son. He was seven or eight years old when she married papa, and I think she was never particularly fond of him.\"  \"Ah! yes,\" thought Rose, \"that explains it. Poor little Elsie! No wonder you pine for your father's love, and grieve over the loss of the mother you never knew!\"  \"She is an odd child,\" said Adelaide; \"I don't understand her; she is so meek and patient she will fairly let you trample upon her. It provokes papa. He says she is no Dinsmore, or she would know how to stand up for her own rights; and yet she has a temper, I know, for once in a great while it shows itself for an instant--only an instant, though, and at very long intervals--and then she grieves over it for days, as though she had committed some great crime; while the rest of us think nothing of getting angry half a dozen times in a day. And then she is forever poring over that little Bible of hers; what she sees so attractive in it I'm sure I cannot tell, for I must say I find it the dullest of dull books.\"  \"Do you,\" said Rose; \"how strange! I had rather give up all other books than that one. 'Thy testimonies have I taken as a heritage forever, for they are the rejoicing of my heart,' 'How sweet are thy words unto my taste! Yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth.'\"  \"Do you _really_ love it so, Rose?\" asked Adelaide, lifting her eyes to her friend's face with an expression of astonishment; \"do tell me why?\"  \"For its exceeding great and precious promises Adelaide; for its holy teachings; for its offers of peace and pardon and eternal life. I am a sinner, Adelaide, lost, ruined, helpless, hopeless, and the Bible brings me the glad news of salvation offered as a free, unmerited gift; it tells me that Jesus died to save sinners--just such sinners as I. I find that I have a heart deceitful above all things and desperately wicked, and the blessed Bible tells me how that heart can be renewed, and where I can obtain that holiness without which no man shall see the Lord. I find myself utterly unable to keep God's holy law, and it tells me of One who has kept it for me. I find that I deserve the wrath and curse of a justly offended God, and it tells me of Him who was made a curse for me. I find that all my righteousnesses are as filthy rags, and it offers me the beautiful, spotless robe of Christ's perfect righteousness. Yes, it tells me that God can be just, and the justifier of him who believes in Jesus.\"  Rose spoke these words with deep emotion, then suddenly clasping her hands and raising her eyes, she exclaimed, \"'Thanks be unto God for His unspeakable gift!'\"  For a moment there was silence. Then Adelaide spoke:  \"Rose,\" said she, \"you talk as if you were a great sinner; but I don't believe it; it is only your humility that makes you think so. Why, what have you ever done? Had you been a thief, a murderer, or guilty of any other great crime, I could see the propriety of your using such language with regard to yourself; but for a refined, intelligent, amiable young lady, excuse me for saying it, dear Rose, but such language seems to me simply absurd.\"  \"Man looketh upon the outward appearance, but the Lord pondereth the heart,\" said Rose, gently. \"No, dear Adelaide, you are mistaken; for I can truly say 'mine iniquities have gone over my head as a cloud, and my transgressions as a thick cloud.' Every duty has been stained with sin, every motive impure, every thought unholy. From my earliest existence, God has required the undivided love of my whole heart, soul, strength, and mind; and so far from yielding it, I live at enmity with Him, and rebellion against His government, until within the last two years. For seventeen years He has showered blessings upon me, giving me life, health, strength, friends, and all that was necessary for happiness; and for fifteen of those years I returned Him nothing but ingratitude and rebellion. For fifteen years I rejected His offers of pardon and reconciliation, turned my back upon the Saviour of sinners, and resisted all the strivings of God's Holy Spirit, and will you say that I am not a great sinner?\" Her voice quivered, and her eyes were full of tears.  \"Dear Rose,\" said Adelaide, putting her arm around her friend and kissing her cheek affectionately, \"don't think of these things; religion is too gloomy for one so young as you.\"  \"Gloomy, dear Adelaide!\" replied Rose, returning the embrace; \"I never knew what true happiness was until I found Jesus. My sins often make me sad, but religion, never.     \"'Oft I walk beneath the cloud,     Dark as midnight's gloomy shroud;     But when fear is at the height,     Jesus comes, and all is light.'\"     CHAPTER SECOND      \"Thy injuries would teach patience to blaspheme,     Yet still thou art a dove.\"                              --BEAUMONT'S _Double Marriage._      \"When forced to part from those we love,       Though sure to meet to-morrow;     We yet a kind of anguish prove       And feel a touch of sorrow.     But oh! what words can paint the fears       When from these friends we sever,     Perhaps to part for months--for years--       Perhaps to part forever.\"                                  --ANON.   When Miss Allison had gone, and Elsie found herself once more quite alone, she rose from her chair, and kneeling down with the open Bible before her, she poured out her story of sins and sorrows, in simple, child-like words, into the ears of the dear Saviour whom she loved so well; confessing that when she had done well and suffered for it, she had not taken it patiently, and earnestly pleading that she might be made like unto the meek and lowly Jesus. Low sobs burst from her burdened heart, and the tears of penitence fell upon the pages of the holy book. But when she rose from her knees, her load of sin and sorrow was all gone, and her heart made light and happy with a sweet sense of peace and pardon. Once again, as"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6440"],["title","Elsie Dinsmore (#3)"],["body","before, the little Elsie was made to experience the blessedness of \"the man whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.\"  She now set to work diligently at her studies, and ere the party returned was quite prepared to meet Miss Day, having attended faithfully to all she had required of her. The lesson was recited without the smallest mistake, every figure of the examples worked out correctly, and the page of the copy-book neatly and carefully written.  Miss Day had been in a very captious mood all day, and seemed really provoked that Elsie had not given her the smallest excuse for fault-finding. Handing the book back to her, she said, very coldly, \"I see you can do your duties well enough when you choose.\"  Elsie felt keenly the injustice of the remark, and longed to say that she had tried quite as earnestly in the morning; but she resolutely crushed down the indignant feeling, and calling to mind the rash words that had cost her so many repentant tears, she replied meekly, \"I am sorry I did not succeed better this morning, Miss Day, though I did really try; and I am still more sorry for the saucy answer I gave you; and I ask your pardon for it.\"  \"You _ought_ to be sorry,\" replied Miss Day, severely, \"and I hope you are; for it was a very impertinent speech indeed, and deserving of a much more severe punishment than you received. Now go, and never let me hear anything of the kind from you again.\"  Poor little Elsie's eyes filled with tears at these ungracious words, accompanied by a still more ungracious manner; but she turned away without a word, and placing her books and slate carefully in her desk, left the room.  Rose Allison was sitting alone in her room that evening, thinking of her far-distant home, when hearing a gentle rap at her door, she rose and opened it to find Elsie standing there with her little Bible in her hand.  \"Come in, darling,\" she said, stooping to give the little one a kiss; \"I am very glad to see you.\"  \"I may stay with you for half an hour, Miss Allison, if you like,\" said the child, seating herself on the low ottoman pointed out by Rose, \"and then mammy is coming to put me to bed.\"  \"It will be a very pleasant half-hour to both of us, I hope,\" replied Rose, opening her Bible.  They read a chapter together--Rose now and then pausing to make a few explanations--and then kneeling down, she offered up a prayer for the teachings of the Spirit, and for God's blessing on themselves and all their dear ones.  \"Dear little Elsie,\" she said, folding the child in her arms, when they had risen from their knees, \"how I love you already, and how very glad I am to find that there is one in this house beside myself who loves Jesus, and loves to study His word, and to call upon His name.\"  \"Yes, dear Miss Allison; and there is _more_ than one, for mammy loves Him, too, very dearly,\" replied the little girl, earnestly.  \"Does she, darling? Then I must love her, too, for I cannot help loving all who love my Saviour.\"  Then Rose sat down, and drawing the little girl to a seat on her knee, they talked sweetly together of the race they were running, and the prize they hoped to obtain at the end of it; of the battle they were fighting, and the invisible foes with whom they were called to struggle--the armor that had been provided, and of Him who had promised to be the Captain of their salvation, and to bring them off more than conquerors. They were pilgrims in the same straight and narrow way, and it was very pleasant thus to walk a little while together. \"Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another; and the Lord hearkened and heard it; and a book of remembrance was written before Him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon His name. And they shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.\"  \"That is mammy coming for me,\" said Elsie, as a low knock was heard at the door.  \"Come in,\" said Rose, and the door opened, and a very nice colored woman of middle age, looking beautifully neat in her snow-white apron and turban, entered with a low courtesy, asking, \"Is my little missus ready for bed now?\"  \"Yes,\" said Elsie, jumping off Rose's lap; \"but come here, mammy; I want to introduce you to Miss Allison.\"  \"How do you do, Aunt Chloe? I am very glad to know you, since Elsie tells me you are a servant of the same blessed Master whom I love and try to serve,\" said Rose, putting her small white hand cordially into Chloe's dusky one.  \"'Deed I hope I is, missus,\" replied Chloe, pressing it fervently in both of hers. \"I's only a poor old black sinner, but de good Lord Jesus, He loves me jes de same as if I was white, an' I love Him an' all His chillen with all my heart.\"  \"Yes, Aunt Chloe,\" said Rose, \"He is our peace, and hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us; so that we are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints and of the household of God; and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner-stone.\"  \"Yes, missus, dat's it for sure; ole Chloe knows dat's in de Bible; an' if we be built on dat bressed corner-stone, we's safe ebery one; I'se heard it many's de time, an' it fills dis ole heart with joy an' peace in believing,\" she exclaimed, raising her tearful eyes and clasping her hands. \"But good night, missus; I must put my chile to bed,\" she added, taking Elsie's hand.  \"Good-night, Aunt Chloe; come in again,\" said Rose. \"And good-night to you, too, dear little Elsie,\" folding the little girl again in her arms.  \"Ain't dat a bressed young lady, darlin'!\" exclaimed Chloe, earnestly, as she began the business of preparing her young charge for bed.  \"O mammy, I love her so much! she's so good and kind,\" replied the child, \"and she loves Jesus, and loves to talk about Him.\"  \"She reminds me of your dear mamma, Miss Elsie, but she's not so handsome,\" replied the nurse, with a tear in her eye; \"ole Chloe tinks dere's nebber any lady so beautiful as her dear young missus was.\"  Elsie drew out the miniature and kissed it, murmuring, \"Dear, darling mamma,\" then put it back in her bosom again, for she always wore it day and night. She was standing in her white night-dress, the tiny white feet just peeping from under it, while Chloe brushed back her curls and put on her night-cap.  \"Dere now, darlin', you's ready for bed,\" she exclaimed, giving the child a hug and a kiss.  \"No, mammy, not quite,\" replied the little girl, and gliding away to the side of the bed, she knelt down and offered up her evening prayer. Then, coming back to the toilet table, she opened her little Bible, saying, \"Now, mammy, I will read you a chapter while you are getting ready for bed.\"  The room was large and airy, and Aunt Chloe, who was never willing to leave her nursling, but watched over her night and day with the most devoted affection, slept in a cot bed in one corner.  \"Tank you, my dear young missus, you's berry good,\" she said, beginning the preparations for the night by taking off her turban and replacing it by a thick night-cap.  When the chapter was finished Elsie got into bed, saying, \"Now, mammy, you may put out the light as soon as you please; and be sure to call me early in the morning, for I have a lesson to learn before breakfast.\"  \"That I will, darlin',\" replied the old woman, spreading the cover carefully over her. \"Good-night, my pet, your ole mammy hopes her chile will have pleasant dreams.\"  Rose Allison was an early riser, and as the breakfast hour at Roselands was eight o'clock, she always had an hour or two for reading before it was time to join the family circle. She had asked Elsie to come to her at half-past seven, and punctually at the hour the little girl's gentle rap was heard at her door.  \"Come in,\" said Rose, and Elsie entered, looking as bright and fresh and rosy as the morning. She had her little Bible under her arm, and a bouquet of fresh flowers in her hand. \"Good-morning, dear Miss Allison,\" she said, dropping a graceful courtesy as she presented it. \"I have come to read, and I have just been out to gather these for you, because I know you love flowers.\"  \"Thank you, darling, they are very lovely,\" said Rose, accepting the gift and bestowing a caress upon the giver. \"You are quite punctual,\" she added, \"and now we can have our half-hour together before breakfast.\"  The time was spent profitably and pleasantly, and passed so quickly that both were surprised when the breakfast bell rang.  Miss Allison spent the whole fall and winter at Roselands; and it was very seldom during all that time that she and Elsie failed to have their morning and evening reading and prayer together. Rose was often made to wonder at the depth of the little girl's piety and the knowledge of divine things she possessed. But Elsie had had the best of teaching. Chloe, though entirely uneducated, was a simple-minded, earnest Christian, and with a heart full of love to Jesus, had, as we have seen, early endeavored to lead the little one to Him, and Mrs. Murray--the housekeeper whom Adelaide had mentioned, and who had assisted Chloe in the care of the child from the time of her birth until a few months before Rose's coming, when she had suddenly been summoned home to Scotland--had proved a very faithful friend. She was an intelligent woman and devotedly pious, and had carefully instructed this lonely little one, for whom she felt almost a parent's affection, and her efforts to bring her to a saving knowledge of Christ had been signally owned and blessed of God; and in answer to her earnest prayers, the Holy Spirit had vouchsafed His teachings, without which all human instruction must ever be in vain. And young as Elsie was, she had already a very lovely and well-developed Christian character. Though not a remarkably precocious child in other respects, she seemed to have"]]]
