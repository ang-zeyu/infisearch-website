Its largest town, several miles up this navigable river, is Duala, strongly fortified.  This, if I am not badly mistaken, is our objective point.\"  \"Perhaps you are right,\" said Jack somewhat dubiously, \"but won't the forts be too strong for the cruisers?\"  \"Not these, I am sure.\"  \"Well,\" said Jack, \"I hope we see some action soon, whether it is at Duala, as you call it, or some other place.  This is growing monotonous.\"  Frank's prophecy proved correct.  Even now the Cumberland and the Dwarf were well into the Gulf of Guinea and making all headway toward the mouth of the river Cameroon, which point the vessels reached early the following morning, intending to anchor in the mouth of the stream.  At the approach of the cruisers, however, a fort guarding the harbor broke into action.  A few well-directed shots from the big guns of the Cumberland, and the fort was silenced.  Then, instead of coming to anchor, the cruisers steamed slowly up the river.  Rounding a bend in the stream, Duala could be seen in the distance; likewise the forts guarding the town, and a bombardment of the fortifications was at once begun.  The shore batteries promptly returned the fire, but it soon became apparent that the guns on the ships outranged them.  For several hours the bombardment continued, and then two merchant steamers were seen making their way from the shelter of the port directly toward the British ships.  \"Wonder what's up now?\" said Frank, who at that moment, having been relieved from duty, stood beside Jack at the rail.  \"Don't know,\" was the latter's brief reply.  Nor did anyone else, so those on board the cruisers watched the movements of the oncoming steamers with much curiosity.  When the approaching vessels were little more than a mile up the river they came to a stop.  Small boats were lowered over the sides and put off hurriedly in the direction from which they had come.  Shortly after, a blinding glare rose to the sky, there was the sound of two terrific reports, one immediately following the other, and the two steamers slowly settled into the water.  Captain Marcus, on the bridge of the Cumberland, cried out:  \"They have blockaded the river!\"  It was true.  The ruse was plainly apparent now that it was too late to prevent it.  The two sunken vessels made further progress up the river by the British ships impossible.  \"Wonder what we shall do now?\" asked Frank.  \"Haven't any idea,\" said Jack briefly.  Night drew on and still the British guns continued to hurl their shells upon the German town.  With the fall of darkness there came an answer to Frank's question.  Captain Marcus summoned Frank and Jack.  \"The Germans have effectually blocked the river,\" he told them. \"Therefore we cannot capture the town that way.  Because of your experience, I have called you two lads to undertake a most dangerous mission.  \"You,\" pointing to Jack, \"will lead 400 sailors around through the woods and attack the enemy from the flank.  You, Mr. Chadwick,\" turning to Frank, \"I shall put in command of a fleet of four small boats, armed with rapid-firers, and it will be your duty to try and crawl up the river without attracting the attention of the forts.  Attacking from two sides, simultaneously, we should take the town.  In the meantime we shall continue to shell the town, stopping our bombardment at such a time as I believe you will be prepared for a sudden attack.  Therefore, when you reach your positions, you will not attack until the bombardment ceases.  That shall be your signal. Do I make myself clear?\"  \"Perfectly,\" both lads agreed.  \"Good, then.  Everything shall be in readiness for you in an hour.\"  The lads saluted and left the commander's cabin.  Two hours later found Jack, with 400 British sailors at his command, already disembarked from small boats and stealing into the woods.  Frank, with his little fleet, was picking his way carefully up the river.  The lad easily found a channel between the two sunken merchantmen, and the little boats pushed on.  \"Careful of mines!\" had been Captain Marcus' parting injunction and the lad peered keenly ahead constantly.  He made out several small objects floating upon the water, and these were carefully avoided.  By dint of careful rowing the boats finally drew up safely, not more than a quarter of a mile from the German forts, where the little party awaited the signal agreed upon.  Jack, in the meantime, had led his men through the dense woods, and by making a wide detour, had penetrated almost to the rear of the enemy's fortress, which, he figured, would be the most likely to be improperly guarded.  Here he and his men lay down, awaiting the signal to attack.  But still the British bombardment continued, and shells rained upon the little African town.  Suddenly the sound of screeching shells ceased.  Jack sprang to his feet and listened intently for a moment.  But the big guns on the warships were now silent.  It was time to act.  \"Attention!\" called Jack, and his men stood ready about him.  Silently they crept forward to the very edge of the little town. Here, moving figures in the glare of many fires gave evidence that the German troops and their native allies were on the alert. But as Jack had surmised, they were not expecting an attack from this direction.  Approaching closer and closer, Jack finally gave the command:  \"Fire!\"  The crack of 400 rifles followed this command, and under the withering fire of the British, the Germans were mowed down on all sides.  At the same instant, from the river, the rapid firers in Frank's command shattered the stillness of the night with their noise of death.  Thus attacked on two sides, the Germans for a moment stood as if paralyzed, men dropping on all sides.  But for a moment only.  Then they leaped forward ready to encounter the unseen foe.  Under the command of their officers they formed coolly enough, and volley after volley was fired into the woods.  But Jack and his 400 British sailors were not to be stayed. Right in among the Germans they plunged, shooting, cutting and slashing.  The Germans at this end of the town were gradually being forced back--back upon their comrades who already were retreating before the rapid-firers of Frank's command at the other end of the town.  Caught between two fires, they nevertheless fought bravely, pouring in volley for volley.  Suddenly the British under Jack ceased firing altogether and rushed upon the foe with cutlasses and clubbed rifles.  The shock of this attack was too much for the Germans, and with the fierce hail of bullets from Frank's end of the field, there was but one thing for them to do.  The officer in command raised a handkerchief on the point of his sword.  Jack could barely make it out in the half-light.  At the same moment the officer commanding the Germans opposing Frank's small force cried out:  \"We surrender!\"  Instantly the sound of firing ceased, and the German officer walked up to Frank and delivered his sword.  At precisely the same moment, the other German officer, who it turned out was in command of the town, presented his sword to Jack.  Jack gallantly passed the weapon back to him, saying:  \"Keep it, sir.  I could not deprive so brave a man of his sword. However, I must ask you to accompany me back to my ship.\"  The German signified his assent, and Jack called out to Frank whom he could now see approaching with his prisoner:  \"Are you hurt, Frank?\"  \"No,\" came the reply, \"are you?\"  Jack made haste to reply in the negative.  The boys decided that Frank should stay with the sailors left to guard the town, and that Jack should escort the German commander to the Cumberland.  Accordingly the two took their seats in one of the little boats, and were rowed back down the stream.  Frank, after giving the necessary orders to guard the town and fort, established himself in the commander's quarters, where he awaited some word from Captain Marcus.      CHAPTER IX  THE BOYS MAKE AN ENEMY  Jack with his prisoner returned aboard the Cumberland, where the lad turned the German commander over to Captain Marcus.  \"Shall I go back to the town, sir?\" he asked, as the commander signified that he might leave the cabin.  \"If you like,\" was the reply.  \"Have you any commands regarding the prisoners, sir?  Or as to the manner of guarding the place against attack?\"  \"Yes; you may present my respects to Mr. Chadwick, and tell him that you two are in joint authority until morning, when I shall do myself the pleasure of paying you a visit.  You will take whatever precautions necessary to guard against an attack from any of the enemy who may move against you from Boak.\"  \"Very well, sir,\" replied Jack, saluting.  \"Boak, as you probably are aware,\" continued the commander, \"is another small German fortress further up the river.  I do not anticipate an attack, but it is best to be prepared.  You may also say to Mr. Chadwick that I am well pleased with his work, and with yours.\"  \"Thank you, sir,\" returned the lad, and saluting again, he turned and left the cabin.  He was over the side of the Cumberland in a few moments, and was soon being rowed swiftly back toward Duala.  Several hundred yards from the little landing, his cars caught the sound of a great hubbub.  There were cries and shouts and general confusion.  Rapidly the lad covered the intervening distance, leaped to the ground and sprinted in the direction in which he could see a knot of wildly gesticulating figures.  \"Sounds to me like Frank was in trouble of some kind,\" he panted to himself as he ran along, for at that moment he had detected the sound of his friend's voice raised in anger.  Jack dashed up to the knot of men, all of whom lie now perceived were British sailors, and as he saw his friend standing calmly in the center of them unhurt, he paused on the edge of the crowd to watch developments.  With a flush on his face,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6337"],["title","The Boy Allies under Two Flags (#8)"],["body","evident in the red glow of a camp fire, Frank stood facing a man.  The latter, in height, topped the lad by a good three inches, and even from where he stood Jack could see that the man's fingers twitched nervously at his side.  \"I am in command here until further notice,\" Frank was saying, \"and while I am, our captives will receive such treatment as is due prisoners of war.  Do you understand that, Mr. Stanley?\"  \"Bah!\" cried the other, whom Jack now recognized as an officer aboard the  Cumberland; \"by seniority I am your superior officer. I am not answerable to you for my actions.\"  \"Aren't you?\" exclaimed Frank, taking a threatening step forward, a peculiar glint in his eyes.  \"We'll see about that later.  In the meantime understand that I am in command here and that what I say goes.  Molest another of the prisoners and you shall answer to me.\"  \"Is that so?\" sneered Stanley.  \"And what do you think you'll do about it?\"  \"Try and see,\" said Frank grimly.  \"Do you think I'm afraid of you?\" cried Stanley.  \"I'll show you!\"  With these words, he took a sudden step backward, and Jack was able to see the cause of all the trouble.  Crouching between two sailors was an old native, black of color and grizzled of hair. Stanley doubled his fist, and before a hand could be raised to stop him, drove it between the old native's eyes.  Jack sprang forward with a cry, but Frank forestalled him.  He leaped upon the perpetrator of this inhuman act, and with a quick blow knocked him to the ground.  Stanley rose with blood on his lips and evil in his eye.  Quickly he stepped back a pace, and a revolver glinted in his hand.  \"You--you--\" he stuttered.  At that moment the revolver was twisted violently from his grasp, and, turning, Stanley looked into Jack's angry countenance.  \"What's the meaning of this?\" Jack demanded.  \"Would you become a murderer?\"  \"He struck me,\" shouted Stanley angrily, \"and he shall give me satisfaction, and so shall you, you meddling upstart.\"  \"So?\" said Jack quietly.  \"What kind of satisfaction do you want? I'm perfectly ready to accommodate you.\"  Stanley took one look at Jack's stalwart figure, fully his own height and equally as broad.  Evidently he decided he cared nothing for a tussle with this opponent.  \"I have nothing to say to you,\" he said.  \"But this fellow,\" pointing to Frank, \"struck me and I demand satisfaction.\"  \"Well,\" said Frank, interrupting.  \"You shall have it.  Pull off your coat.\"  \"I'm not a common bruiser,\" sneered Stanley.  \"I will fight you with revolvers at twenty paces.\"  \"Enough of this,\" broke in Jack.  \"I will permit no duel.\"  \"I do not want to kill you,\" said Frank.  \"So!\" exclaimed the enraged officer, \"a coward, eh?\"  Frank stepped quickly forward, an angry gleam in his eye.  \"Enough,\" he said.  \"I'll fight you.\"  Again Jack started to protest, but Frank waved him aside and turned to the men gathered about.  \"Can I depend upon you men not to let this go any further?\" he asked.  \"You can, sir,\" they answered in chorus.  \"All right, then,\" said Frank.  \"Get ready, sir.\"  One sailor volunteered to act as second for Stanley and Jack stepped to Frank's side.  Then the two seconds met and decided the details of the duel.  The principals were to be allowed one shot each.  This was to be all, whether either man was hit or not.  Before accepting the revolver from the hand of his second, Stanley quickly drew his own revolver, and taking aim at a little knob on a tree some fifty feet distant, fired quickly.  The bullet splintered the bark on the tree and the pieces flew high in the air.  \"Half an inch away!\" called a sailor who stood near the tree.  Stanley turned to Frank with a sneering smile on his face.  \"Say your prayers,\" he taunted.  \"They will be your last.\"  Frank smiled grimly.  \"I heard a story once,\" he replied quietly, \"about a man who could hit a dime every shot at a hundred yards.  But when he fired with a loaded pistol pointed at him he didn't come off with such a good record.\"  The principals now stood back to back.  Each was to take twenty paces forward--Jack had refused to make the distance any closer--turn and lire when ready.  \"Ready, go!\" came Jack's voice, and slowly the two started away from each other.  \"Seventeen, eighteen, nineteen--\" counted Frank, and at that instant there was a sound of a shot and a bullet whistled over his head, grazing the scalp.  Stanley, nervous because of the lad's coolness, had fired at the count of nineteen.  \"Twenty!\" said Frank without a sign of nervousness in his voice. He turned slowly, and aimed his revolver at the ground in front of him.  Very slowly he raised the barrel of his weapon until it pointed at the knees of his now shaking antagonist, then to his belt, to his chest, and finally to his head.  Beads of perspiration stood out on Stanley's forehead.  Then, with a quick movement, Frank raised the muzzle of his weapon still higher, and fired over Stanley's head.  Then he calmly replaced the weapon in his pocket and walked back to where Jack was standing.  Having thus escaped what appeared almost certain death, Stanley became bold again.  Evidently he had not realized that Frank had missed purposely.  \"I demand another shot,\" he cried angrily.  \"There will be no more duel so far as I am concerned,\" said Frank quietly.  Jack walked angrily up to Stanley.  \"He spared your life,\" he said heatedly.  \"Bah!\" replied Stanley.  \"He missed cleanly, and he's afraid to try again.\"  Frank walked quickly over to his late opponent.  \"You fool!\" he said quietly.  \"Look here!\"  Quickly he whipped his revolver out, and without taking aim, fired twice in rapid succession.  Although three times as far away as Stanley had been when he gave his exhibition of skill, the little knot on the tree leaped into the air, and as it fell, the second bullet caught it in midair and splintered it into little pieces.  Midshipman Stanley staggered back aghast.  \"I could have killed you with ease,\" said Frank calmly, and walking away, he picked up his coat and put it on.  \"I--I didn't know he could shoot like that!\" sputtered Stanley to Jack.  \"That's not so very good--for him,\" said Jack.  \"Why, once--\"  \"Never mind,\" interrupted Midshipman Stanley, backing hurriedly away, \"I'll take your word for it.  But, remember, I am not through with either of you yet.  My time will come, and when it does--\"  He broke off abruptly, an evil sneer in his voice, and walked quickly away.  Now the sailors surrounded Frank and gave him three rousing British cheers.  \"You're all right, Frank!\" they called, some of them slapping him familiarly on the back.  Frank waved them laughingly aside, and turned to Jack.  \"Any orders from Captain Marcus?\" he asked, as though nothing out of the ordinary had happened.  \"Lead the way to your excellency's quarters, and I'll tell you,\" replied Jack with a smile.  Frank led the way.      CHAPTER X  AN EXPEDITION  Briefly Jack repeated Captain Marcus' orders to Frank.  \"I took the liberty of making those preparations without awaiting such a command,\" said Frank.  \"I have thrown out outposts, and there is no danger of a surprise tonight.\"  \"You mean this morning,\" disagreed Jack, after a look at his watch.  \"It's after four o'clock now.\"  \"Then it will soon be daylight,\" said Frank.  \"You had better turn in and get a little sleep.  I'll stand watch.\"  Jack well knew the futility of an argument over this matter, so he turned in without further words by the simple process of throwing himself on a pallet on the floor of the tent.  Frank took his seat in the doorway, where he remained looking out into the distance.  The sun was high in the heavens when Jack awoke.  He jumped up with a start.  Frank was not there.  Jack made a hasty toilet and set out to find his friend.  He came upon him at the river landing, and, as the lad cast his eyes down the stream he made out the launch of Captain Marcus coming, swiftly toward the camp.  He tapped Frank lightly on the shoulder.  \"Why didn't you wake me up?\" he demanded.  \"Well, you were sleeping so comfortably I hated to disturb you,\" replied Frank.  \"And I suppose you would have let Captain Marcus find me asleep?\"  \"I don't believe he would have minded.  He knows we all sleep some time.\"  \"I'll get even with you one of these days,\" said Jack laughing, and both lads stepped to the very edge of the landing to give Captain Marcus a hand as he clambered from the boat.  \"How is everything?\" he demanded, as he arose to his feet.  \"First rate,\" replied Frank.  \"No signs of the enemy?\"'  \"Not a sign, sir.\"  \"Good! Evidently he doesn't know we have occupied the town.  I believe that by a quick dash we can capture Boak.  What do you think?\"  \"Fine!\" exclaimed Jack with enthusiasm.  \"Of course we can, sir,\" agreed Frank.  \"All right, then; it shall be your job!\"  Jack and Frank saluted.  \"Thank you, sir,\" both said breathlessly.  Several hours later the two lads, in the captain's launch, found themselves at the head of a small flotilla moving slowly up the river.  Each boat was equipped with one rapid-fire gun and carried twenty men.  In all there were twelve boats.  The farther up the river the little party progressed the narrower became the stream, until finally it was little better than a deep creek.  Foliage of large trees overhung the water, making it almost as dark as night.  The water was black and murky.  Frank shuddered as he glanced at it.  \"Looks like it might be full of all kinds of reptiles and things,\" he said.  \"It certainly does,\" Jack agreed.  \"I would as soon think of jumping into the bottomless pit as of diving into this black stream.\"  Around bend after bend in the small stream the little flotilla proceeded cautiously, and ever, as they progressed, the stream became narrower and more fear-inspiring.  In some of the boats men began to grumble.  Jack turned and called out angrily:  \"Silence!\"  Then he added more companionably: \"It's all right, men.  Where men have gone before men can"]]]
