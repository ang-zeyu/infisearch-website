He still clung to the stirrup, and since he would not let go, Ranjoor Singh proceeded to tow him, with a cautious, booted right leg ready to spur Bagh away to the left should the brute commence to kick.  \"You are hard-hearted person, and your fate is forever sealed if you refuse to listen!\" wailed the babu. \"The blood of your men lies in street calling aloud for vengeance!\" A university education works wonders for babu vocabulary. \"I tell you it is a riot, and most extremelee serious affair!\"  That was the wrong appeal to make, as the babu himself would have known had he been less excited. In time of riot the place for a Sikh officer would be at the regiment's headquarters, in readiness for the order from a civil magistrate without which interference would cost him his commission. But the babu was beside himself, what with breathlessness and disappointment. He decided it was expedient to strengthen his appeal, and his imagination was still working.  \"There will be two regiments of Tommees--drunken Tommees, presentlee. They will take your men to jail. The Tommees are already on the way. Should they get there first your men will be everlastinglee disgraced as well as muleted. You should hurry.\"  Ranjoor Singh ceased from frowning and looked satisfied. If there were trouble enough in the bazaar to call for the despatch of British soldiers to the scene, then nothing in the world was more certain than that any men of his who happened to be in danger would be rescued with neatness and speed. If there was no trouble yet, there would very likely be some swearing when the soldiers got there. In the meantime he was wet through, both with rain and perspiration. The thought of a bath and dry clothes urged him like the voice of a siren calling; and he had shown the babu all the courtesy his Sikh creed and profession demanded.  So he clucked to Bagh, and the big brute plunged into a canter, just as eager for his sais and gram as his master was for clean dry clothes. For two strides the babu clung to the stirrup, wrenching it free from the risaldar-major's foot; then the horse grew savage at the unaccustomed extra weight, and lashed out hard behind him, missing the babu twice in quick succession, but filling him full to the stuttering teeth with fear. Ranjoor Singh touched the horse with his right spur, and in a second the babu lay along on his stomach in the mud.  He lay for a minute, believing himself dead. Then he cried aloud, since he knew he must be broken into pieces. Then he felt himself. At last he rose, and after a speechless glance at the back of the risaldar-major, started slowly along the street toward where the \"riot\" was.  \"It is enough,\" he said in English, since he was a \"failed B.A.,\" \"to try the patience of Job's comforter. This militaree business has corrupted even Sikh cavalry until they no longer are dependable. Yes. It is time! It is time indeed that German influence be felt, in order that British yoke may be cast off for good and all. Now I take it a German soldier would have arrested everybodee, and I would have received much _kudos_ in addition to cash reward paid for information. In meantime, it is to be seen whether or not--yes, precisely--a pencil is mightier than a sword, which means that a babu is superior in wit and general attainments. Let us see!\"  He began to run again, at a truly astonishing pace, considering his paunch and all-round ungainliness, getting over the ground faster than many a thin man could have done. As he ran his lips worked, for though he had no breath to spare for speech, his brain was forming words that crowded for expression.  \"The Sikhs!\" he screamed, as he came within earshot of the milling crowd, through which four small policemen were trying to force a path. \"The Sikhs! They ride to the rescue!\"  \"The Sikhs!\" yelled somebody on the edge of the crowd, who had more breath but not enough imagination to ask questions. \"The Sikhs are coming! Run!\"  \"The Sikhs! The Sikhs!\"  The crowd took it up. And since it was a crowd, and there was nothing else to do; and since it had had protection but no violence at Sikh hands ever since '57; and since the babu really did look frightened, it shouted that the Sikhs were coming until it believed the news and had made itself thoroughly afraid.  \"Run, brothers!\" shouted some man in the middle who owned a voice like a bull-buffalo's. And that being a new idea and just as good as any, the whole crowd took to its heels, leaving the four policemen staring at the body of a dead Sikh, and the fat babu complacently regarding all of them.  Presently a European police officer trotted up on a white pony, examined the body, asked a dozen questions of the four policemen, wrote in his memorandum book, and ordered the body to be taken to the morgue.  \"Come here, you!\" he called to the babu.  So the babu waddled to him, judging his salaam shrewdly so that it suggested deference while leaving no doubt as to the intended insult.  \"What do you know about this?\"  \"As peaceful citizen in pursuance of daily bread and other perquisites, I claim protection of police! While proceeding on way was thrown to ground violentlee by galloping horse whose rider urged same in opposite direction. Observe my deshabille. Regard this mud on my person. I insist on full rigor of the law for which I am taxed inordinately.\"  \"What sort of a horse? Who rode it? How long ago?\"  \"Am losing all count of time since being overwhelmed. Should say veree recently, however. The horse was ridden by a person who urged it vehemently. It was a brown horse, I think.\"  \"Which way did he go?\"  \"How should I know? He went away, knocking me over in transit and causing me great distress.\"  \"Was he armed?\"  \"Two arms. With one he steered the animal. With the other he urged him, thus.\"  The babu described in pantomime an imaginary human riding for his life, whom not even the adroitest police officer could recognize as Ranjoor Singh, even had he been acquainted with the risaldar-major.  \"Had he a weapon of any kind?\"  \"Not knowing, would prefer to say nothing about that. It was with the horse--with the rump of the animal that he hit me, and not with a sword of any kind.\"  \"Well, you had better come with me to the office, and there we'll take down your deposition.\"  \"Am I arrested?\"  \"No. You're a witness.\"  \"On the contrary, I am prosecutor! I demand as stated formerly full rigor of the law. I demand capture and arrest, together with fine and imprisonment of party assaulting me, failing which I shall address complaint to government!\"  \"Come along. We'll talk about that at the office.\"  So the babu was escorted to the stuffy little police office, where he was made to sit on a bench beside ten native witnesses of other crimes; and presently he was called to a desk at which a native clerk presided. There he was made to recite his story again, and since he had had time in which to think, he told a most amazing, disconnected yarn that looked even more untruthful by the time the clerk had written his own version of it on a sheet. To this version the babu was required to swear, and he did so without a blink.  Then there was more delay, while somebody was found who knew him and could certify to his address, and it was nearly evening by the time he was allowed to go.         *       *       *       *       *  It was also nearly evening when a messenger arrived at the barracks to report the death of a Sikh trooper by murder in the bazaar. The man's name and regimental number proved him to have been one of D Squadron's men, and since its commander, Ranjoor Singh, was then in quarters, the news was brought to him at once.  \"Killed where?\" he demanded; so they told him.  \"Exactly when?\"  It became evident to Ranjoor Singh that there had been some truth after all in the babu's tale. The verbal precis of the only witness, given from memory, about a man who galloped away on horseback, threw no light at all on the case; so, because he could think of nothing better to do at the moment, the risaldar-major sent for a _tikka-gharri_ and drove down to the morgue to identify the body.  On the way back from the morgue he looked in at the police station, but the babu had been gone some ten minutes when he arrived.  The police could tell him nothing. It was explained that the crowd directly after the murder had been too great to allow any but those nearest to see anything; and it was admitted that the crowd had been suddenly panic-stricken and had scattered before the police could secure witnesses. So he drove away, wondering, and ordered the driver to follow the road taken by the murdered trooper.  It was just on the edge of evening, when the lighted street-lamps were yet too pale to show distinctly, that he passed the disused boarded shop and saw, on the side of the street opposite, the babu who had brought him the story of riot that afternoon. He stopped his carriage and stepped out. On second thought he ordered the carriage away, for he was in plain clothes and not likely to attract notice; and he had a suspicion in his mind that he might care to investigate a little on his own account. He walked straight to the babu, and that gentleman eyed him with obvious distrust.  \"Did you see my trooper murdered?\" he demanded; for he had learned directness under Colonel Kirby, and applied it to every difficulty that confronted him.  Natives understand directness from an Englishman, and can parry it; but from another native it bewilders them, just as a left-handed swordsman is bewildered by another left-hander. The babu blinked.  \"How much had you seen when you ran to warn me this afternoon?\"  The babu looked pitiful. His fat defenseless body was an absolute contrast to the Sikh's tall manly figure. His eye was furtive, glancing ever sidewise; but the Sikh looked straight and spoke abruptly though with a note of kindness in his voice.  \"There is no need to fear me,\" he said,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6751"],["title","The Winds of the World (#6)"],["body","the babu would not answer. \"Speak! How much do you know?\"  So the babu took heart of grace, producing a voice from somewhere down in his enormous stomach and saying, of course, the very last thing expected of him.  \"Grief chokes me!\" he asserted.  \"Take care that I choke thee not, _babuji_! I have asked a question. I am no lawyer to maneuver for my answer. Did you see that trooper killed?\"  The babu nodded; but his nod was not much more than tentative. He could have denied it next minute without calling much on his imagination.  \"Oh! Which way went the murderer?\"  \"Grief overwhelms me!\" said the babu.  \"Grief for what?\"  \"For my money--my good money--my emoluments!\"  Direct as an arrow though he was in all his dealings, Ranjoor Singh had not forgotten how the Old East thinks. He recognized the preliminaries of a bargain, and searched his mind to recall how much money he had with him; to have searched his pocket would have been too puerile.  \"What of them?\"  \"Lost!\"  \"Where? How?\"  \"While standing here, observing movements of him whom I suspected to be murderer, a person unknown--possibly a Sikh--perhaps not--removed money surreptitiously from my person.\"  \"How much money?\"  \"Rupees twenty-five, annas eight,\" said the babu unwinking. He neither blushed nor hesitated.  \"I will take compassion on your loss and replace five rupees of it,\" said Ranjoor Singh, \"when you have told me which way the murderer went.\"  \"My eyes are too dim, and my heart too full with grief,\" said the babu. \"No man's memory works under such conditions. Now, that money--\"  \"I will give you ten rupees,\" said Ranjoor Singh.  This was too easy! The babu was prepared to bargain for an hour, fighting for rupee after rupee until his wit assured him he had reached the limit. Now he began to believe he had set the limit far too low.  \"I do not remember,\" he said slowly but with great conviction, scratching at his stomach as if he kept his recollections stored there.  \"You said twenty-five rupees, eight annas? Well, I will pay the half of it, and no more,\" said Ranjoor Singh in a new voice that seemed to suggest unutterable things. \"Moreover, I will pay it when I have proved thy memory true. Now, scratch that belly of thine and let the thoughts come forth!\"  \"Nay, sahib, I forget.\"  Ranjoor Singh drew out his purse and counted twelve rupees and three quarters into the palm of his hand.  \"Which way?\" he demanded.  \"Twenty-five rupees, eight annas of earned emolument--gone while I watched the movements of a murderer! It is not easy to keep brave heart and remember things!\"  \"See here, thou bellyful of memories! Remember and tell me, or I return this money to my purse and march thee by the nape of thy fat neck to the police station, where they will put thee in a cell for the night and jog thy memory in ways the police are said to understand! Speak! Here, take the money!\"  The babu reached out a fat hand and the silver changed owners.  \"There!\" said the babu, jerking a thumb over his right shoulder. \"Through that door!\"  \"That narrow teak door, down the passage?\"  But the babu was gone, hurrying as if goaded by fear of hell and all its angels.  Ranjoor Singh strode across the street in a bee-line and entered the dark passage. He had seen the yellow light of a lamp-flame through a chink in an upper shutter, and he intended to try directness on the problem once again. It was ten full paces down the passage to the door; he counted them, finishing the last one with a kick against the panel that would have driven it in had it been less than teak.  There came no answer, so he kicked again. Then he beat on the door with his clenched fists. Presently he turned his back to the door and kept up a steady thunder on it with his heels. And then, after about five minutes, he heard movement within.  He congratulated himself then that the noise he had made had called the attention of passers-by and of all the neighbors, and though he had had no fear and no other intention than to enter the house at all costs, he certainly had that much less compunction now.  He heard three different bolts drawn back, and then there was a pause. He thought he heard whispering, so he resumed his thunder. Almost at once there followed the unmistakable squeak of a big beam turning on its pivot, and the door opened about an inch.  He pushed, but some one inside pushed harder, and the door closed again. So Ranjoor Singh leaned all his weight and strength against the door, drawing in his breath and shoving with all his might. Resistance ceased. The door flew inward, as it had done once before that day, and closed with a bang behind him.     Long were the days and oh! wicked the weather--     Endless and thankless the round--   Grinding God's Grit into rookies together;   I was the upper stone, he was the nether,     And Gad, sir, they groaned as we ground!   Bitter the blame (but he helped me to bear it),     Grim the despair that we ate!   But hell's loose! The dam's down, and none can repair it!   'Tis our turn! Go, summon my brother to share it!     His squadron's at arms, and we wait!     CHAPTER V   A regiment is more exacting of its colonel than ever was lady of her lord; the more truly he commands, the better it loves him, until at last the regiment swallows him and he becomes part of it, in thought and word and deed. Distractions such as polo, pig-sticking, tiger-shooting are tolerable insofar as they steady his nerve and train his hand and eye; to that extent they, too, subserve the regiment. But a woman is a rival. So it is counted no sin against a cavalry colonel should he be a bachelor.  There remained no virtue, then, in the eyes of Outram's Own for Colonel Kirby to acquire; he had all that they could imagine, besides at least a dozen they had not imagined before he came to them. There was not one black-bearded gentleman who couched a lance behind him but believed Colonel Kirby some sort of super-man; and, in return, Colonel Kirby found the regiment so satisfying that there was not even a lady on the sky-line who could look forward to encroaching on the regiment's preserves.  His heart, his honor, and his rare ability were all the regiment's, and the regiment knew it; so he was studied as is the lot of few. His servant knew which shoes he would wear on a Thursday morning, and would have them ready; the mess-cook spiced the curry so exactly to his taste that more than one cook-book claimed it to be a species apart and labeled it with his name. If he frowned, the troopers knew somebody had tried to flatter him; if he smiled, the regiment grinned; and when his face lacked all expression, though his eyes were more than usually quick, officer, non-commissioned officer and man alike would sit tight in the saddle, so to speak, and gather up their reins.  His mood was recognized that afternoon as he drove back from the club while he was yet four hundred yards away, although twilight was closing down. The waler mare--sixteen three and a half, with one white stocking and a blaze that could be seen from the sky-line--brought his big dog-cart through the street mud at a speed which would have insured the arrest of the driver of a motor; but that, if anything, was a sign of ordinary health.  Nor was the way he took the corner by the barrack gate, on one wheel, any criterion; he always did it, just as he never failed to acknowledge the sentry's salute by raising his whip. It needed the observant eyes of Outram's Own to detect the rather strained calmness and the almost inhumanly active eye.  \"Beware!\" called the sentry, while he was yet three hundred yards away. \"Be awake!\"  \"Be awake! Be awake! Beware!\"  The warning went from lip to lip, troop to troop, from squadron stables on to squadron stables, until six hundred men were ready for all contingencies. A civilian might not have recognized the difference, but Kirby's soldier servant awakened from his nap on the colonel's door-mat and straightened his turban in a hurry, perfectly well aware that there was something in the wind.  It was too early to dress for dinner yet; too late to dress for games of any kind. The servant was nonplussed. He stood in silence, awaiting orders that under ordinary circumstances, or at an ordinary hour, would have been unnecessary. But for a while no orders came. The only sound in those extremely unmarried quarters was the steady drip of water into a flat tin bath that the servant had put beneath a spot where the roof leaked; the rain had ceased but the ceiling cloth still drooped and drooled.  Suddenly Kirby threw himself backward into a long chair, and the servant made ready for swift action.  \"Present my compliments to Risaldar-Major Ranjoor Singh sahib, and ask him to be good enough to see me here.\"  The servant saluted and was gone. Kirby relapsed again into the depth of the chair, staring at the wall in front of him, letting his eye travel from one to another of the accurately spaced-out pictures, pieces of furniture and trophies that proclaimed him unmarried. There was nothing whatever in his quarters to decoy him from his love. There were polo sticks in a corner where a woman would have placed a standard lamp, and where the flowers should have stood was a chest to hold horse-medicines. There was a vague smell about the place of varnish, polish and good leather.  The servant was back again, stiff at the salute, within five minutes.  \"_Ne hai_.\"  \"Not there? Not where? Not in his quarters? Then go and find him. Ask where he is. Hurry!\"  So, since the regiment was keyed to watchfulness, it took about five minutes more before it was known that Ranjoor Singh was not in barracks. The servant returned to report that he had been seen driving toward the bazaar in a _tikka-gharri_.  Then entered Warrington, the adjutant, and the servant was dismissed at once.  \"Bad business,\" said Warrington, looking thoroughly cheerful.  \"What now?\"  \"One of Squadron D's men murdered in the bazaar this afternoon.
