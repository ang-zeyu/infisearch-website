When Frank and Jack sought to learn the destination of the Sylph from Lord Hastings, he had put them off with a laugh.  \"You'll know soon enough,\" he said with a wave of his hand.  \"Are we likely to see action soon?\" asked Jack.  \"If we are fortunate,\" was the reply.  \"Well, that's all we wanted to know,\" said Frank.  \"Don't worry,\" replied His Lordship.  \"You will see all the action you want before this cruise is over, or I am very badly mistaken.\"  And with this the boys were forced to be content.  For two days they sailed about in the sunny Mediterranean, sighting neither friend nor foe, and then suddenly had encountered the two German cruisers, the Breslau and the Goeben, and the skirmish with these two ships, described at the opening of this story, ensued.  But now, as the enemy had succeeded in making off in the darkness, and as Lord Hastings had ordered that the original course of the Sylph be resumed, the little vessel was again--as Jack said when they had started on their journey--\"sailing under sealed orders.\"  The two lads were about bright and early the morning following the encounter with the German cruisers; and as they stood looking out over the sea, Lord Hastings approached them.  \"More news of the Emden,\" he said, as he came up.  \"Another British merchant vessel sunk?\" asked Jack.  \"Worse,\" replied Lord Hastings.  \"A cruiser this time!\"  \"A cruiser!\" exclaimed Jack in surprise.  \"I always thought that any cruiser of ours was more than a match for a German.\"  \"Well, you are wrong,\" was Lord Hastings' reply.  \"From what I have heard by wireless, our vessel attacked, but was sent to the bottom by the Emden before she could do much damage to the German.\"  \"What was the name of the British ship?\" asked Frank.  \"I haven't heard,\" replied Lord Hastings; \"but the action was fought in the Indian Ocean.\"  \"It seems to me,\" said Jack vehemently, \"that it is about time this German terror of the sea was sent to the bottom.\"  \"So it is,\" declared Lord Hastings; \"and mark my words, she will be when one of our big ships comes up with her.\"  \"May it be soon!\" ejaculated Frank.  But it was not to be soon.  For almost another month the German terror prowled about the seas, causing great havoc to British and French merchantmen.  For three days the Sylph continued on her way without interruption, and then turned about suddenly and headed for home. Under full speed she ran for days, until the boys knew they were once more in the North Sea, where they had so recently participated in their one great battle.  \"Will you tell us why we have come back so suddenly, sir?\" asked Frank of Lord Hastings.  \"Why,\" said His Lordship, \"the Germans seem to be growing extremely active in the North Sea.  Only three days ago, a German submarine, after apparently running the blockade, sank the cruiser Hawke off the coast of Scotland.  \"What?\" cried both boys in one voice.  \"Exactly,\" said Lord Hastings grimly, \"and it is for the purpose of attempting to discover some of these under-the-sea fighters, or other German warships, that we have come back.  The whole North Sea is being patrolled, and we are bound to come upon some of the Germans eventually.\"  \"Well, I hope we don't have to wait long,\" said Frank.  \"And so do I,\" agreed Jack.  \"I hope that every German ship afloat will be swept from the seas.\"  The Sylph did not go within sight of the English coast, but for two days cruised back and forth, east, west, north and south, without the sight of the enemy.  This inaction soon began to pall upon the two lads, to whom a fight was as the breath of life itself.  \"I wish we had continued on our way, wherever we were going, and not have come back here,\" said Jack to Frank one afternoon.  \"This is about the limit,\" agreed Frank.  \"I believe we would have done better to have joined the army.  At least we would have seen some fighting.\"  But the boys desire for action was to be soon fulfilled.  The very next day some smoke and dots appeared on the horizon. Quickly they grew until they could be identified as enemy ships. The captain of the Sylph set out a wireless message requesting help from any units in the area:  \"Have sighted enemy; four vessels: approaching  rapidly,\" and the exact position of the Sylph.  In a moment came the answer:  \"Head north, slowly.  We will intercept the enemy when actively engaged.  Remember the Hawke!\"  Lord Hastings sent another message:  \"How many are you?\"  \"Five,\" came back the answer.  \"Undaunted accompanied by torpedo destroyers Lance, Lenox, Legion and Loyal, as convoys.\"  \"Good!\" muttered Lord Hastings; then turned to Lieutenant Hetherington:  \"You may clear for action, sir!\"  The gallant British sailors jumped quickly to their posts, the light of battle in their eager eyes.  At Lord Hastings' command, the Sylph was brought about, and soon had her stern toward the enemy.  There came a wireless message from the German commander.  \"Surrender!\" it said.  \"We will die first!\" was the answer sent by Lord Hastings.  Steaming slowly, the Sylph apparently was trying to escape; at least so figured the German commander.  To him it appeared that he could overtake the little vessel with ease, and his squadron steamed swiftly after it.  Gradually the Germans gained upon the little vessel, finally coming close enough to send a shot after it.  They were not yet within range, however, and the shell fell short.  \"We'll have to let him get a little closer,\" muttered Lord Hastings, \"or he may draw off.  We'll have to face the danger of a shell striking us.\"  A second shell from the Germans kicked up the water alongside the Sylph.  \"He'll have the range in a minute, sir,\" said Lieutenant Hetherington.  \"Bear off a little to the south,\" was the commander's reply.  For almost an hour the Sylph outmaneuvered the German flotilla, and avoided being struck.  All this time Lord Hastings was in constant wireless communication with the Undaunted, which was even now coming to give battle to the Germans.  At last the lookout made them out.  \"Battle fleet--\" he began, but Lord Hastings keen eye had already perceived what the lookout would have told him.  Well to the rear, perhaps three mile's north, came the British cruiser Undaunted and her four convoys.  They were steaming rapidly and in such a direction that they would intercept the Germans should the latter attempt to return in the direction from which they had come.  To escape, the Germans must come directly toward the Sylph. Those on board the Sylph noticed a sudden slackening in the speed of the German squadron.  \"They have sighted our fleet, sir,\" said Jack, who had stood impatiently on the bridge while all this maneuvering was going on.  \"So they have,\" said Lord Hastings, and then turned to Lieutenant Hetherington.  \"You may bring the Sylph about sir,\" he said quietly.  Swiftly the little scout cruiser turned her face directly toward the enemy, who even now had turned to escape toward the south, at the same time heading so they would pass the Sylph at the distance of perhaps a mile.  \"Full speed ahead!\" came the command on the Sylph.  The little vessel darted forward at an angle that would cut off the Germans in the flight.  It was a desperate venture, and none, perhaps, realized it more than did Lord Hastings; but he was not the man to see the prey escape thus easily if he could help it.  Rapidly now the Sylph drew closer to the German torpedo destroyers.  The gunners were at their posts, the range finder already had gauged the distance, medical supplies for the wounded were ready for instant use.  In fact, the Sylph was ready to give battle, regardless of the number of her enemies.  There was a loud crash as the first salvo burst from the Germans, but the Sylph was untouched.  Still the British ship drew nearer without firing.  Then Lord Hastings gave the command: \"Mr. Hetherington, you may fire at will!\"  The Sylph seemed to leap into the air at the shock of the first fire.  One shell crashed into the side of one of the German destroyers, and a cheer went up from the British.  Then came several broadsides from the Germans, who had stopped now to dispose of this brave little vessel, before continuing their flight.  Suddenly the Sylph staggered, and her fire became less frequent. A German shell had struck her forward turret with terrible force, putting her biggest gun out of commission.  But the Sylph recovered, and continued to fight on.  Jack and Frank darted hither and thither about the vessel, carrying orders from Lord Hastings and Lieutenant Hetherington, now and then taking a man's place at one of the guns as he toppled over until another relieved them.  Two distinct shocks told that the Sylph had been struck twice more.  Then Lord Hastings gave the command for his vessel to withdraw.  In attacking the enemy as he had, in the face of terrible odds, he had accomplished his purpose.  He had halted the Germans in their attempt to escape, and had given the Undaunted and the British torpedo boats time to come up.  Before the Germans could again get under full headway, there came the heavy boom of a great gun.  The Undaunted was within range, and had opened fire.  Lord Hastings summoned Jack to him.  \"What damage do you find to the Sylph?\" he asked.  \"Forward gun out of commission, sir,\" replied the lad.  \"Ten men killed, and many wounded.\"  Frank also had had news to report.  The British flotilla and the German squadron were now at it hammer and tongs.  Seeing that all hope of escape had been cut off, the German commander turned to face his new foes, determined to give battle to the last.  Steadily the British fleet bore down on the enemy, the great guns of the Undaunted belching fire as they drew near.  Now Lord Hastings ordered the Sylph--still the closest of the British vessels to the Germans--again into the fray, and in spite"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6337"],["title","The Boy Allies under Two Flags (#2)"],["body"," its crippled condition, the little cruiser once more bore down upon the Germans.  Suddenly the nearest German destroyer launched a torpedo at the Sylph.  By a quick and skillful maneuver, Lord Hastings avoided this projectile, and a broadside was poured into the German.  Others of the German fleet were too closely pressed by the Undaunted and her convoys to aid the one engaged with the Sylph, and so the two were left to fight it out alone.  Closer and closer together the two vessels came, until they were perhaps only a hundred yards apart.  It was evident to those on the Sylph that a shell must have badly crippled the German, for otherwise a torpedo would have put an end to the little British craft.  Unable to check the advance of the Sylph, the German destroyer turned suddenly and made off.  \"After her!\" shouted Lord Hastings, and the Sylph leaped ahead at the word of command.      CHAPTER III  SAVED FROM THE SEA  The three other German vessels now singled out the Undaunted and concentrated their fire upon her, thinking first to dispose of the more formidable vessel and then to turn their attention to the lighter craft.  A fierce duel ensued.  Suddenly there was a terrific explosion. One of the German torpedo destroyers seemed to leap into the air, only to fall back a moment later and disappear beneath the sea with a loud hiss.  A heavy shell struck the Undaunted and carried away part of her superstructure.  The two remaining torpedo boats of the enemy, except the one being pursued by the Sylph, suddenly turned and dashed directly at the Undaunted, evidently intending to ram her.  Captain Fox avoided a collision with promptness and skill, and the torpedo boats sped by without touching her.  Now the Loyal launched a torpedo at the first German craft.  It sped swift and true, and a moment later there was but one German left in condition to continue the fight.  Thinking to avoid unnecessary loss of life, Captain Fox called upon the German to surrender. The kindly offer was rewarded with a defiant reply, and the German made another swift attack upon the Undaunted.  For a moment it seemed that a collision was unavoidable, but Captain Fox managed to get his ship out of the way just as the enemy plowed by.  It was close work and required great coolness.  Meantime the Sylph was close on the heels of the other German vessel.  Salvo after salvo the British poured into the apparently helpless German torpedo boat, which, however, continued its flight rather than surrender.  Frank and Jack, both happening to be on the bridge at the same moment, stood for a brief second to watch the effect of the Sylph's fire.  The damage to the German had been terrific.  The vessel listed badly, and seemed in imminent danger of sinking.  \"By Jove!\" ejaculated Jack, and would have said more but for a sudden interruption.  There was a terrific explosion on the German vessel, and as if by magic, it disappeared beneath the sea.  The Sylph's battle was over.  \"Get out the boats, men!\" came Lord Hastings command.  \"It may be that we can save some of them.\"  Jack and Frank leaped quickly into the same boat, and a moment later were rushing to the spot where the German torpedo destroyer had disappeared.  For perhaps five minutes they cruised about, unable to find a single survivor, and then both were startled by the sound of something whistling overhead.  Looking up they beheld the cause of this trouble.  The last German destroyer had come almost upon them, and the British gunners, evidently not seeing the little boat, were continuing their fire at the enemy.  The lads were in imminent danger of being struck by a British shell.  The German launched a torpedo, and it went skimming right by the little boat in which the boys sat.  \"Quick!\" cried Jack.  \"We must get out of here or one of those things will hit us.\"  The men bent to their oars; but they were not quick enough. Struck by some missile, the boat suddenly sank beneath them, and the boys found themselves in the water, swimming.  And still they were between the two fighting ships.  Looking over his shoulder, Jack could make out the Sylph, and calling to Frank to follow him, he struck out in that direction.  They swain rapidly, but seemed to make little progress.  Lord Hastings, standing on the bridge of the Sylph, discovered the two forms in the water.  A second boat was hastily launched, and put off toward them.  When it was within a few yards of them a fragment of a shell struck it and it also disappeared.  It went to the bottom with all on board, nor did any of its ill-fated victims come to the surface again.  The two lads, now clinging to pieces of wreckage, continued at the mercy of the sea, and also in constant danger of being struck by an exploding shell, while they swam slowly toward the Sylph.  In one final despairing, attempt to sink the Undaunted, the last German destroyer launched another torpedo.  By a wonderful maneuver the British cruiser again avoided the projectile, which sped on through the water.  Swimming, the boys could plainly follow its flight.  As the Undaunted swung out of the way to avoid it they could see that the missile had a clear path to the Sylph.  With a gasp the boys saw the torpedo speed toward the little scout cruiser.  Lord Hastings had not seen the projectile launched--because a view of the German ship had been obstructed until the Undaunted swung out of the way--and no effort was made to avoid it.  The torpedo crashed into the Sylph on the water line, and the explosion which followed must have torn  through all the various compartments to the engine room, for there was a second loud explosion, steam leaped up on all sides of the Sylph, and when it had cleared away, there was no Sylph to be seen.  The little scout cruiser had disappeared; vanished, had been destroyed.  Of Lord Hastings and the other officers and men, the lads could see nothing.  For a moment the boys were unable to speak, so astounded were they at the suddenness of this terrible disaster.  \"Great Scott!\" gasped Frank at last.  \"Do you realize what has happened?\"  Jack was more calm.  \"Perfectly,\" he replied faintly, with a sob in his voice.  \"The Sylph has gone, and with her Lord Hastings and all on board--all our friends, the only ones we have in the world.\"  The two boys unconsciously swam closer together.  \"The fortunes of war,\" said Jack, more quietly now.  \"It is a terrible thing.\"  Further conversation was interrupted by the sound of another terrific explosion.  Startled, the boys turned in the water just in time to see the last German destroyer disappear beneath the sea.  \"Good!\" exclaimed Jack, in fierce joy.  \"I am glad of that.\"  Frank also gritted his teeth, and muttered fervent congratulations to the British gunners.  And now the British ships proceeded on their course.  None had been seriously damaged.  They turned their backs upon the scene of the engagement and made off in the direction from which they had come.  The boys shouted loud and long for assistance; but their cries were not heard aboard the British ships of war, which, gradually gathering more headway, steamed off to the south.  Not until they were almost out of sight did the lads cease their shouting, and resign themselves to their fate.  In despair, they turned to each other for comfort.  Jack was first to speak.  \"Well, Frank,\" he said quietly.  \"We shall soon join Lord Hastings and our other good friends in a place where there is no war and no losing of friends.\"  \"Isn't there something we can do?\" asked Frank, trembling with cold.  \"I am afraid not.\"  There was a sudden stirring of the water beneath them.  Jack cried out suddenly:  \"What's that?\"  Frank had regained his coolness now.  \"Probably a shark come to finish us up quickly,\" he replied calmly.  Both lads, with a last effort, swam desperately from the place.  But suddenly the waters of the North Sea parted, and a long, cigar-shaped object came to the top and rested lightly on the water.  \"What is it?\" asked Jack again in no little alarm  Before Frank could reply, a man suddenly appeared on the top of the object, apparently from nowhere, and glanced about.  He espied them, and as suddenly disappeared.  He reappeared almost in an instant, however, followed by another.  And now both lads discovered what the object was, an object that had arrived just in time to save them from a watery grave.  They could see that the two men wore the uniform of the German navy.  The long, cigar-shaped object was a German submarine.      CHAPTER IV  ABOARD THE X-9  There was a hoarse command from aboard the submarine, and a moment later a small boat floated alongside the two German officers who clambered in.  Frank and Jack swam toward them as rapidly as their exhausted condition would permit.  \"What are you two lads doing here in the middle of the North Sea?\" asked one of the officers in great surprise, after the boys had been pulled aboard the small boat.  \"We're here because our ship was sunk by one of your blamed torpedo boats,\" replied Jack, with some heat.  \"Only one sunk?\" inquired the officer in excellent English.  \"Just one; it seems to me that is enough.\"  \"Well, I agree that it is better than none,\" said the German officer.  \"We'll sink them one at a time.  How many of our ships engaged you?\"  \"Four,\" replied Jack briefly, now beginning to smile to himself, for he saw the German did not know what had happened.  \"Which way did they go?\" demanded the German.  \"Straight to the bottom,\" replied Jack, with a note of thankfulness in his voice.  \"What!\" exclaimed the officer, starting to his feet.  \"To the bottom,\" Jack repeated.  \"Impossible!\" cried the officer.  \"One British ship couldn't sink four German torpedo destroyers.\"  \"I didn't say there was only one,\" said Jack.  \"We some assistance.\"  \"You must have had,\" said the German officer heatedly.  \"How many?  A dozen?\"  \"There were two or three,\" said Jack briefly,  He had no mind to tell the German officer the"]]]
