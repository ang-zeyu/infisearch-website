He don't know anything about Lake Champlain. Why don't you row up the lake till you meet the boat?\"  \"I was thinking of doing so, but I can't keep this money out of my mind.\"  \"Why need you trouble yourself about that?\" demanded the father impatiently.  \"It was lost in your boat, and I am very anxious that it should be found. I'm sure Mr. Randall thinks you've got it.\"  \"Well, he searched me, and found out that I hadn't got it--didn't he?\" added Mr. Wilford, with a sickly smile.  \"I don't like to have you suspected of such a thing, and for that reason I want to find the money.\"  \"You can't find it, and I tell you he hasn't lost any money. He's going to cheat the bank or his creditors out of six thousand dollars.\"  \"I don't believe he would do such a thing as that.\"  \"We have looked everywhere for the money, and it can't be found. It's no use to bother any more about the matter. It's gone, and that's the end of it--if he lost it at all. You have looked all over the ferry-boat, and it isn't there. If it had been floating in the lake, you couldn't help seeing it. Now, you better take your boat and row up the lake till you meet the steamer.\"  \"I'm going pretty soon.\"  \"Better go now. I'm going up after a drink of water. If you don't go pretty soon, you will be too late to do any good on board the steamer,\" said Mr. Wilford, hoping, if he left the spot, his son would depart also.  Lawry hauled in the rowboat, ready to embark; but, before he did so, he made one more search in the bateau for the pocketbook. The timbers of the ferry-boat were ceiled over on the bottom, leaving a space for the leakage between the inner and the outer planking. Near the mast there was a well, from which, with a grain-shovel, the water was thrown out. Lawry examined this hole, feeling under the planks, and thrusting the shovel in as far as he could. This search was unavailing, and he gave it up in despair. As he stepped on shore, his curiosity prompted him to look under the platform outside of the boat.  The pocketbook was there!  In a space between the planks, a foot above the surface of the water, and the same distance from the side, the pocketbook was thrust in. It could not be seen from the inside of the boat, nor from the platform; and it could not have got there of itself.  Lawry's face turned red, and his heart bounded with emotion, for the situation of the pocketbook pointed to but one conclusion. It had been placed there by his father, who had evidently taken it from the pocket of the coat, and concealed it, either before or after the garment had fallen into the water. He was appalled and horrified at the discovery. He knew that his father was discontented with his lot; that he was indolent and thriftless; but he did not think him capable of committing a crime.  He reached under the platform, and took the pocketbook from its hiding-place. It was perfectly dry; it had not been in the water. John Wilford had probably taken it from the coat pocket, and after thrusting it into the aperture beneath the drop, had let the platform fall into the water for the purpose of dislodging the coat, and making it appear that the money had been lost in the lake.  The pocketbook seemed to burn in Lawry's fingers, and he returned it to the place where he had found it; for he was confused, and did not know what to do. He stood, with flushed face and beating heart, on the shore, considering what course he should take. He could not think of exposing his father's crime, on the one hand, or of permitting him to retain the money, on the other.  After long and painful deliberation, he decided to take the pocketbook, follow Mr. Randall, and return it to him, telling him that he had found it under the drop of the boat. He was about to adopt this course when his father came out of the house, and walked down to the ferry-boat.  \"Not gone yet?\" said Mr. Wilford.  \"No, sir; that money has troubled me so much that I could not go,\" replied Lawry.  \"What's the use of bothering your head about that any longer?\" added the father petulantly.  \"It troubles me terribly.\"  \"Let it go; it can't be found, and that's the end of it.\"  \"But it can be found.\"  \"Why don't you find it, then?\"  \"I have found it, father!\"  \"What!\"  \"It's in a crack under the platform,\" replied Lawry.  \"You don't mean so!\" exclaimed the ferryman.  \"It's no use to talk round the barn, father; the pocket-book is just where you put it.\"  \"Where I put it? What do you mean, Lawry?\"  \"There it is in the crack under the drop, a foot above the water. It did not wash in there of itself. Oh, father!\"  Lawry, unable longer to control his feelings, burst into tears.  \"What are you crying about, Lawry? Do you think I hid the pocketbook?\"  \"I know you did, father,\" sobbed Lawry.  \"Do you accuse me of stealing?\" demanded Mr. Wilford, with a weak show of indignation.  \"I don't accuse you of anything, father; but there it is.\"  \"You mean to say that I stole it?\"  \"Oh, father!\"  \"Stop your whining, Lawry! What possessed you to poke round after what did not concern you? Now, shut up, and go off about your business.\"  \"You will not keep it, father?\"  \"I haven't got it. If you have found it, I suppose there is time enough to think what is best to be done.\"  \"I don't want any time to think of it,\" replied Lawry; and before his father could prevent him, he took the pocketbook from its place of concealment.  \"What are you going to do with it?\" demanded Mr. Wilford.  \"I'm going to find Mr. Randall, and give it back to him, as quick as I can.\"  \"What's the use of doing that?\"  \"Because it's the right way to do.\"  \"That isn't the way to get rich.\"  \"But it's the way to keep honest.\"  \"Give it to me, Lawry.\"  \"What are you going to do with it, father?\"  \"That's my business.\"  \"I shall give it back to the owner.\"  \"No, you won't, Lawry. Do you want to get me into trouble--to have me sent to jail?\"  \"If I give it back to Mr. Randall, there will be no trouble.\"  \"Lawry, I've been poor and honest long enough. I'm going to do as other men do. I'm going to get rich.\"  \"By keeping this money?\" exclaimed the son.  \"You needn't talk any more about it; I put the money where you found it.\"  \"I know you did.\"  \"Give it to me.\"  \"I will not, father, if you mean to keep it.\"  \"I do mean to keep it. Do you think I have run all this risk for nothing? Give me the pocketbook.\"  \"Don't think of such a thing as keeping it, father,\" pleaded Lawry.  \"I'm going to be rich,\" replied the father doggedly.  \"You know what mother said about making haste to be rich: 'Haste makes waste.'\"  \"It will make waste if you don't give me the pocket-book.\"  \"Mr. Randall will not be satisfied till he gets his money, and you will certainly be found out.\"  \"No, I shall not be found out. I'll go to New York and change off the money this very night.\"  \"But only think of it, father. You will be a thief. You never will have a moment's peace as long as you live.\"  \"I never did have, and I shall not be any worse off,\" said Mr. Wilford coldly. \"There comes your steamer. She hasn't got any pilot on board; I know by the way she steers. You had better go and see to her, for she is running right for the Goblins.\"  Lawry glanced at the _Woodville_, as she appeared rounding a point, two miles distant.  \"If you will go and find Mr. Randall, I will give you the pocketbook, father,\" replied Lawry.  \"Well, I guess you are right, Lawry, and I'll do it.\"  \"He has gone up to the village,\" added Lawry, as he handed the money to his father.     CHAPTER V  HASTE AND WASTE   Lawry, satisfied that his father had come to his senses, and would restore the pocketbook to Mr. Randall, hastened into the boat, and pulled toward the _Woodville_. He was afraid Mr. Sherwood had been too venturesome in attempting to pilot the little steamer in waters with which he was entirely unfamiliar; but he hoped for the best, and rowed as hard as he could, in order to give him timely warning of the perils which lay in the path of the beautiful craft.  About half a mile above the landing at Port Rock there was a dangerous ledge, called the Goblins, some of whose sharp points were within a foot of the surface of the water when the lake was low. They were some distance from the usual track of steamers, and there was no buoy, or other mark, on them. The _Woodville_ was headed toward the rocks, as the ferryman had said, and it was impossible for Lawry to get within hailing distance of her before she reached them. He pulled with all his strength, and had hoped to overhaul her in season to avert a catastrophe.  Occasionally, as he rowed, he looked behind him to observe the course of the steamer. She was almost up to the Goblins, while he was too far off to make himself heard in her wheel-house. He was appalled at her danger, and the cold sweat stood on his brow, as he saw her hastening to certain destruction. He could no longer hope to reach her, and he ceased rowing.  Standing up in his boat, he waved his hat, and made other signs to warn the imprudent pilot of his danger. With one of the oars he tried to signify to him that he must keep off; but no notice was taken of his warning. On the forward deck of the little craft stood three ladies, who, taking the boatman's energetic gestures for friendly salutations, were waving their handkerchiefs to him.  \"Hard aport your helm!\" shouted Lawry.  Mr. Sherwood sounded the whistle, evidently taking the shout as a cheer of congratulation at his safe arrival.  \"Keep off!\" roared Lawry.  Again the whistle sounded, and the ladies waved their handkerchiefs more vigorously than before. The young pilot was in despair. The _Woodville_ was going at full speed directly upon the rocks, whose sharp points would grind her to powder if she struck upon them.  \"Hard aport!\" repeated Lawry desperately.  Once more the supposed cheer was answered by the whistle and the waving of the ladies' handkerchiefs, and still the fairy craft dashed on toward the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6572"],["title","Haste and Waste; Or, the Young Pilot of Lake Champlain. A Story for Young People (#5)"],["body","s.  \"By gracious! she's on them, as sure as the world!\" exclaimed Lawry to himself, hardly able to breathe.  He had hardly uttered the words before he heard the crash which announced the doom of the _Woodville_. Her sharp bow slid upon the ledge, and she suddenly stopped in her mad flight.  Lawry bent on his oars again, horrified by the accident. He pulled as he had never pulled before. A moment or two after the steamer struck, he was startled by a succession of shrill shrieks from the ladies, and he turned to see what had happened. The _Woodville_ had filled, rolled off the rock, and sank in deep water, leaving her passengers floating helplessly on the lake. The upper half of her smokestack was all that remained in sight of the beautiful craft which three minutes before had been a thing of beauty.  The young pilot did not pause an instant to contemplate the scene of destruction. He saw only the helpless persons struggling for life in the water, and he renewed his labors with a vigor and skill which soon brought him to the sufferers. Mr. Sherwood was supporting his wife; but both of them were nearly exhausted. Lawry helped Bertha into the boat, and told her husband to hold on at the rail.  Ethan French, with his arm around the waist of Fanny Jane, was holding on at the smokestack, where also the fireman of the boat was supporting himself.  \"Where is Fanny?\" gasped Mr. Sherwood.  \"I'm afraid she has gone down,\" replied Ethan French. \"I saw her just there a moment since.\"  \"I see her!\" said Lawry, as he dived into the lake.  Fanny, exhausted by her struggles, had sunk, and Lawry, with a strong arm, bore her to the surface again; but she was too large and heavy for him, and he could not support her.  Before the arrival of the boat, Ethan was in the act of transferring his helpless burden to the arms of the fireman, that he might go to the assistance of Miss Fanny; and, as soon as Lawry appeared, he swam out to help him. With the aid of the young engineer, the exhausted lady was lifted into the boat. Fanny Jane was next taken in, but there was no room for any more.  Though Miss Fanny was in a worse condition than the other ladies, she still had her senses; and none of the party was in danger. Mr. Sherwood, Ethan, and the fireman were still in the water, holding on at the rail of the boat. Lawry took the oars and pulled toward the ferry-landing.  \"Thank God, we are all safe!\" said Mr. Sherwood.  \"Some of us must have been drowned if Lawry had not come to our assistance,\" added Miss Fanny. \"I had given up, and was sinking to the bottom. My senses were leaving me, when I felt his grasp on my arm.\"  \"You have done bravely, Lawry,\" added Bertha.  But the party did not feel much like talking. They were all grateful to God, who had, through the agency of the young pilot, saved them from their perilous situation. When the boat reached the landing-place, the ladies were conducted to the cottage of John Wilford, where everything was done by Mrs. Wilford to promote their comfort. Lawry hastened up to Mr. Sherwood's house to procure the carriage, which had fortunately just returned from Port Henry, and the party were soon conveyed to their home.  Dry clothing and a little rest soon restored Mr. Sherwood and the ladies to their wonted spirits, and all of them wished to see their brave deliverer. He was sent for, and presented himself to the ladies in the drawing-room. Lawry, anxious to learn the condition of the ladies after their cold bath, and their terrible fright, had followed the carriage up to the house, and was telling the coachman the particulars of the catastrophe when he was summoned to the presence of the family.  Never was a young man more earnestly and sincerely thanked for a brave and noble deed; and Mr. Sherwood hinted that something more substantial than thanks would be bestowed upon him.  \"Thank you, sir; I don't need anything more,\" replied Lawry, blushing. \"What will be done with the steamer, now?\" he asked.  \"I have got enough of her,\" said Mr. Sherwood. \"She has given me a shock I shall never forget.\"  \"I don't think it was the fault of the boat, sir,\" suggested Lawry. \"I did all I could to have you keep off the rocks.\"  \"We all thought you were crazy, you shook so in your boat.\"  \"I was trying to warn you of your danger.\"  \"Was that what you meant? We thought you were cheering the _Woodville_.\"  \"I saw you were going on the rocks, and I shouted and made signs for you to keep off.\"  \"You certainly did all you could for us, both before and after the accident,\" added Mr. Sherwood. \"When did you get home, Lawry?\"  \"To-day noon, just after you went to the house for me. I came right up to see you; but I found you had gone.\"  \"Yes; I was so impatient to get that little steamer up here, that I couldn't wait any longer.\"  \"And what a waste your haste has made!\" laughed Mrs. Sherwood. \"There is our fine little steamer at the bottom of the lake.\"  \"She may lie there, for all me,\" added Mr. Sherwood.  \"I should not dare to put my foot on board of her again,\" said Miss Fanny.  \"Nor I,\" chimed in Fanny Jane.  \"She isn't to blame, Mr. Sherwood,\" interposed Ethan French. \"She worked as though she had been alive.\"  \"No steamer could stand such a thump on the Goblins,\" added Lawry.  \"I don't blame the boat, of course,\" replied Mr. Sherwood; \"but this adventure has cured me of my love for steamboating. I don't want to see another one.\"  \"Shall you let the _Woodville_ lie there?\" asked Lawry.  \"She's a wreck now, stove in and ruined.\"  \"But she can be raised and repaired, and be as good as ever, or nearly so,\" continued Lawry.  \"She is good for nothing to me now. I will give her to any one who wants her.\"  \"There are plenty who will want her,\" said Lawry.  \"It will cost them a fortune to raise and repair her--almost as much as she is worth, if she is to be used as a plaything. But I have come to the conclusion that she is a dangerous machine for me, and I don't want anything more to do with her. I came very near drowning my wife and my friends with her; and this fills me with disgust for the boat and for myself.\"  \"Just now you spoke of a reward for what I had the good luck to do for you, Mr. Sherwood,\" continued Lawry.  \"I did; and you may be assured I shall never forget your noble conduct,\" replied Mr. Sherwood warmly.  \"If you are going to give the _Woodville_ away, sir--\"  \"Well, what?\" asked Mr. Sherwood, as the young pilot paused.  \"I don't know as I ought to say what I was going to say.\"  \"Say it, Lawry, say it,\" added Mr. Sherwood kindly.  \"You said you would give the steamer to any one who wanted her,\" continued Lawry, hesitating.  \"And you want her?\" laughed the wealthy gentleman.  \"Yes, sir; that is what I was going to say.\"  \"Then she is yours, Lawry; but I might as well give you the fee simple of a farm in Ethiopia. I don't feel as though I had given you anything, my boy.\"  \"Indeed you have, sir! I feel as though you had made my fortune for me; and I am very much obliged to you, sir.\"  \"I don't believe you have anything to thank me for, Lawry. As I understand it, the _Woodville_ lies on the bottom of the lake, with her bow stove in, and her hull as useless as though the parts had never been put together. The engine and the iron and brass work are worth a good deal of money, I know; but it will cost all they will bring to raise them.\"  \"I don't think the steamer is ruined, sir. I hope you are not giving her away believing that she is not worth anything,\" said Lawry.  \"I don't think she is worth much.\"  \"I think she stove a great hole in her bow, and that is all that ails her. If we can get her on the ways, she can be made as good as ever she was in a week.\"  \"Whatever her condition, Lawry, she is yours. I will give you a bill of sale of her at once.\"  Mr. Sherwood executed the paper in due form, affixed the stamp, and gave the document to the young pilot.  \"I can hardly help weeping when I think of the beautiful little steamer,\" said Mrs. Sherwood. \"She was a perfect little fairy. How elated we were as we moved up the lake in her! What fine times we were promising ourselves on board of her! Now the dear little craft lies on the bottom of the lake, broken and spoiled!\"  \"I shouldn't dare to put my foot in her again,\" added Miss Fanny. \"I shudder when I think of her.\"  \"I shudder when I think of you, Fanny. You were sinking when Lawry dived down after you,\" said Mr. Sherwood.  \"We ought all to be grateful to God for His mercy in saving us,\" added Fanny Jane.  \"I trust we are grateful to Him; and I am sure we shall never forget what Lawry has done to-day,\" responded the gentleman.  \"Never!\" exclaimed Fanny warmly.  \"It was all my fault,\" continued Mr. Sherwood. \"I am ashamed of myself, and disgusted with the boat.\"  \"The boat is not to blame, sir,\" said Ethan French. \"She behaved like a lady.\"  \"I know she is not to blame. It was my silly impatience. I was in such a hurry to try the steamer that I could not wait for a pilot. Bertha, do you know what your father used to say to me when I was in a hurry?\"  \"I don't know; but I have heard him say that you were too impatient for your own good.\"  \"'Haste and Waste' was his maxim, when I was not disposed to wait the natural development of events. By neglecting this precept, I have nearly sacrificed the lives of my best friends. Lawry, if you are going to be a steamboat man, let me give you this maxim for your government--'Haste and Waste.'\"     CHAPTER VI  THE SHERIFF'S VISIT   Lawry put the bill of sale of the _Woodville_ in his pocket, and felt like a steamboat proprietor; for the fact that his steamer lay at the bottom of the lake did not seem to lessen her value. She was in a safe place, and there was no danger of her \"blowing up\" or drifting away from him. The haste of Mr. Sherwood had been \"a windfall\" to him, though Lawry would not willingly have purchased the steamer at the peril of so many precious lives. He was ready to accept the moral and prudential"]]]
