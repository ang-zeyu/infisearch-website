In a word, the licentiousness of Jacques Ferrand stifled the voice of cold reason; he abandoned himself blindly to the emotions which overwhelmed him.  It was agreed that Cecily should be his servant only in appearance; in this manner there would be no scandal. Besides, to assure still more the security of his guest, he would take no other domestic; he would himself serve her and himself also; a neighboring coffee-house keeper could bring his repasts. He paid in money the breakfasts of his clerks, and the porter could take care of the office. Finally, the notary ordered to be promptly furnished a chamber on the first floor, according to Cecily's taste. She offered to pay the expense. He opposed it, and expended two thousand francs.  This generosity was enormous, and proved the unheard-of violence of his passion. Then commenced for this wretch a strange life.  Shut up in the impenetrable solitude of his house, inaccessible to all, more and more under the yoke of his frenzied love, no longer attempting to discover the secrets of this strange woman, from master he became a slave; he was the footman of Cecily--he served her at her repasts--he took care of her apartment. Informed by the baron that Louise had been surprised by a narcotic, the Creole only drank very pure water, only ate meats impossible to adulterate; she chose the chamber which she occupied, and assured herself that the walls concealed no secret doors.  Besides, Jacques Ferrand soon comprehended that Cecily was a woman not to be surprised with impunity. She was vigorous, agile, and dangerously armed.  Nevertheless, not to allow his passion to flag, the Creole seemed at times touched with his attentions, and flattered by the terrible domination she exercised over him. Then, supposing that by proofs of his devotion and self-denial he could make her forget age and ugliness, she delighted to paint in glowing colors his reward when he should arrive at that success.  At these words of a woman so young and so lovely, Jacques Ferrand felt sometimes his mind wandering; a devouring imagery pursued him, waking or sleeping. The ancient fable of the Nessus' shirt was realized for him.  In the midst of these nameless tortures he lost his health, appetite, and sleep. Often at night, in spite of cold or rain, he descended to his garden, and endeavored by a rapid walk to calm his emotions.  At other times, during whole hours, he looked into the chamber where the Creole slept, for she had had the infernal kindness to allow a wicket to be placed in her door, which she often opened, in order that she might almost cause him to lose his reason, so that she could then execute the orders she had received.  The decisive moment seemed to approach. The chastisement of Ferrand became from day to day more worthy of his sins.  He suffered all the torments. By turns absorbed, lost, out of his mind, indifferent to his most serious interests, the maintenance of his reputation as an austere, grave, and pious man--a reputation usurped, but acquired by long years of dissimulation and cunning--he astonished his clerks by his aberrations, displeased his clients by his refusal to see them, and harshly kept at a distance the priests, who, deceived by his hypocrisy, had been, until then, his most fervent trumpeters.  As we were saying, Cecily was arranging her head for the night before a glass. On a slight noise coming from the corridor, she turned her face away from the door.  Notwithstanding the noise which she had just heard at the door, Cecily did not the less tranquilly continue her undressing; she drew from her corsage, where it was placed like a busk, a dirk, five or six inches long, in a case of black shagreen, with a handle of black ebony fastened with silver, a very simple handle, but perfectly _handy_, not a weapon of mere display.  Cecily took the dirk from its case with excessive precaution, and placed it on the marble chimney-piece; the blade, of the finest Damascus and the best temper, was triangular; its point, as sharp as a needle, had pierced a dollar without blunting it.  Impregnated with a subtle and quick poison, the least wound from this poniard was mortal.  Jacques Ferrand, having one day doubted the dangerous properties of this weapon, the Creole made before him an experiment _in anima vita_, that is to say, on the unfortunate house dog, who, slightly pricked in the nose, fell dead in horrible convulsions.  The dirk placed on the chimney, Cecily taking off her spencer of black cloth, exposed her shoulders, bosom, and arms, naked like a lady in ball costume.  According to the custom of most girls of color, she wore, instead of a corset, a second corsage of double linen, which was closely bound around her waist; her orange petticoat, remaining fastened under her white inner waist with short sleeves, composed thus a costume much less severe than the first, and harmonized wonderfully with the scarlet stockings, and the Madras scarf so capriciously twisted around the head of the Creole. Nothing could be more pure, more beautiful, than the contour of her arms and shoulders, to which little dimples gave a charm the more.  A profound sigh attracted the attention of Cecily. She smiled, while roiling around one of her ivory fingers some stray curls which escaped from the folds of the bandana.  \"Cecily! Cecily!\" murmured a voice, at once harsh and plaintive.  And at the narrow opening of the wicket appeared the pale, flat face of Jacques Ferrand; his eyes sparkled in the shade.  Cecily, silent until then, began to sing softly in Creole French, a Louisianian air. The words of this melody were soft and expressive. Although restrained, the noble contralto overpowered the noise of the torrents of rain and violent gusts of wind, which seemed to shake the old house to its foundation.  \"Cecily! Cecily!\" repeated Jacques Ferrand, in a supplicating tone.  The Creole suddenly stopped, turned her head quickly, and appeared to hear for the first time the voice of the notary, and approached the door. \"How! dear master, you are there?\" said she, with a slight foreign accent, which gave additional charm to her melodious voice.  \"Oh! how handsome you are!\" murmured the notary.  \"You think so?\" answered the Creole: \"this bandana suits my hair?\"  \"Every day I find you still more handsome.\"  \"And see how white my arm is.\"  \"Monster! go away! go away!\" cried Jacques Ferrand, furiously.  Cecily laughed immoderately.  \"No, no, this is suffering too much! Oh! if I did not fear death!\" cried the notary, in a hollow voice; \"but to die--to renounce the sight of you, so handsome. I prefer to suffer, and see you--\"  \"See me; this wicket is made for that, and, also, that we can talk as friends, and thus charm our solitude; which, in truth, does not weigh heavily, you are so good a _master!_ See what dangerous confessions I can make through this door.\"  \"And will you not open this door? Yet see how submissive I am! to-night I might have tried to enter with you into your chamber--I did not.\"  \"You are submissive for two reasons. In the first place, you know that being, from necessity, in the habit of wearing a dirk, I handle with a firm hand this venomous plaything, sharper than the tooth of a viper; you know also, that on the day I complain of you, I shall leave forever this house, leaving you a thousand time more charmed, since you have been so gracious toward your unworthy servant as to be charmed with her.\"  \"My servant? it is I who am your slave--your slave, mocked, despised.\"  \"That is true enough.\"  \"And does not this touch you?\"  \"It amuses me. The days, and, above all, the nights, are so long.\"  \"Oh, the cursed--\"  \"No seriously, you appear so completely bewildered, your features change so sensibly, that I am flattered. It is a poor triumph, but you are the only man here!\"  \"To hear that, and only be able to consume in powerless rage!\"  \"How little wit you have! never, perhaps, have I said anything to you more tender.\"  \"Scoff--scoff.\"  \"I do not scoff; I have never seen a man of your age so much in love; and, it must be acknowledged, that a young and handsome man would be incapable of such mad passion. An Adonis admires himself as much as he admires us; he loves on the end of his teeth; and then to love him is his due, hardly is he grateful; but to love a man like you, my master, oh! that would be to raise him from earth to heaven; it would be to accomplish his wildest dreams, his hopes the most extravagent. For, in fine, the being would say to you, 'You love Cecily madly; if I wish it, she shall be yours'--you would believe such a being endowed with supernatural powers, would you not, dear master?\"  \"Yes, oh! yes.\"  \"Well! if you knew how to convince me better of your passion, I should have, perhaps, the fantasy to play myself, in your favor, this supernatural part. Do you comprehend?\"  \"I comprehend that you scoff at me still, always, and without pity.\"  \"Perhaps solitude creates such strange fantasies.\"  Her tone, until then, had been sardonic; but she pronounced these last words with a serious expression, and accompanied them by a glance which made the notary tremble. \"Hush--do not look at me thus; you will make me mad. I prefer that you should say to me _never_; at least, I could abhor you, drive you from the house,\" cried Jacques Ferrand, who again abandoned his vain hopes. \"Yes, for I expect nothing from you. But woe is me! woe! I know you now enough. You tell me to convince you of my love; do you not see how unhappy I am! Yet I do all I can to please you. You wish to be concealed from every eye: I conceal you, perhaps at the risk of compromising myself; in fine, I do not know who you"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6448"],["title","Mysteries of Paris â€” Volume 03 (#6)"],["body","; I respect your secret; I never speak to you about it. I have interrogated you on your past life; you have not answered me.\"  \"Well! I was wrong; I am going to give you a mark of blind confidence. Oh! my master, listen to me.\"  \"Once more a bitter joke!\"  \"No, it is very serious. You must know, you should know, the history of her to whom you give such generous hospitality.\"  And Cecily added, in a tone of hypocritical and tearful compunction:  \"The daughter of a brave soldier, brother of my Aunt Pipelet, I have received an education above my condition; I was seduced, then abandoned, by a rich young man. Then, to escape from the rage of my old father, I fled my native country.\" Then, laughing heartily, Cecily added: \"There, I hope is a little story very presentable, and, above all, very probable, for it has often been related. Amaze your curiosity with that, while waiting for some revelation more piquant.\"  \"I was very sure that this was a cruel pleasantry,\" said the notary, with suppressed anger. \"Nothing touches you, nothing; what must be done? tell me, at least. I serve you like the meanest valet; for you I neglect my dearest interests; I know no more what I do. I am a subject of laughter for my clerks; my clients hesitate to leave me their business. I have parted with some pious people who used to visit me. I dare not think what the public say of this complete change in all my habits. You do not know, no, you do not know the fatal consequences that my mad passion may have for me. See, now, the proofs of my devotion, my sacrifices. Do you wish more? speak! Is it gold you wish? The world thinks me richer than I am, but I----\"  \"What would you have me to do with your gold?\" said Cecily, interrupting the notary, and shrugging her shoulders. \"To reside in this chamber--what good would the gold do me? You have small invention!\"  \"But it is not my fault if you are a prisoner. Does this room displease you? Will you have it more magnificent? speak, command.\"  \"For what purpose; once more, for what purpose? Oh! if I expected here an adored being, I would have gold, silk, flowers, perfumes, all the wonders of luxury; nothing could be too sumptuous, too enchanting.\"  \"Well! these wonders of luxury; say a word, and----\"  \"For what purpose? What should I do with the frame without the picture? The adored being, where is he, oh! my master?\"  \"It is true!\" cried the notary, bitterly. \"I am old. I am ugly. I can only inspire disgust and aversion; she loads me with contempt; she scoffs at me, and I have not the strength to drive her away. I have only strength to suffer.\"  \"Oh! the insupportable _cry-baby_; oh! the silly, with his complaints,\" cried Cecily, in a sardonic and contemptuous tone; he does nothing but groan and lament, and has been for ten days shut up alone with a young woman, in a deserted house.\"  \"But this woman despises me--is armed--is locked!\" cried the notary in a rage.  \"Well! overcome the disdain of this woman; cause the dagger to fall from her hand; constrain her to open this door, which separates you from her; and that not by brutal force, which would fail.\"  \"And how then?\"  \"By the force of your passion.\"  \"Passion! and how can I inspire it?\"  \"Stop, you are but a notary bound up with a sexton; you make me pity you. Am I to teach you your part? You are ugly; be terrible, your ugliness will be forgotten. You are old; be energetic, your age will be overlooked. You are repulsive; be threatening. Since you cannot be the noble horse, who neighs proudly in the midst of his wives, be not, at least, the stupid camel, who bends the knee and crooks the back; be a tiger. An old tiger, who roars in the midst of carnage, has also its beauty; his tigress answers him from the depths of the desert.\"  At this language, which was not without a sort of bold natural eloquence, Jacques Ferrard shuddered, at the savage and almost ferocious expression of the face of Cecily, who, with heaving bosom, expanded nostril, haughty mouth, fixed on him her large black and burning eyes.  Never had she appeared so lovely.  \"Speak, speak again!\" cried he, passionately; \"you speak seriously this time. Oh! if I could----\"  \"One can do what one wishes,\" said Cecily, abruptly.  \"But----\"  \"But I tell you that if you wish, repulsive as you are----\"  \"Yes, I will do it! Try me, try me!\" cried Jacques Ferrand, more and more excited.  Cecily continued, approaching nearer, and fixing on the notary a penetrating look, \"For a woman loving a handsome youth would know,\" resumed the Creole, \"that she would have an exorbitant caprice to satisfy; that the boys would look at their money if they had any, or, if they had none, to a mean trick, while the old tiger----\"  \"Would regard nothing, do you understand? nothing. Fortune, honor, he would know how to sacrifice all he would!\"  \"True,\" said Cecily, placing her charming fingers on the bony and hairy hands of Jacques Ferrand, who, for the first time, touched the soft and velvety skin of the Creole. He became still paler, and uttered a hoarse sigh.  \"How this woman would be beloved,\" added Cecily, \"had she an enemy, whom, pointing out to her old tiger, she would say strike, and--\"  \"And he would strike,\" cried Jacques Ferrand, endeavoring to approach the ends of her fingers to his withered lips.  \"True, the old tiger would strike,\" said the Creole, placing her hand softly on his.  \"If you would love me,\" cried the wretch, \"I believe I would commit a crime.\"  \"Hold, master,\" said Cecily, suddenly withdrawing her hand; \"in your turn go away, go away, I know you no more; you do not appear to me so ugly now as before; go away.\"  She retired quickly from the wicket. The detestable creature knew how to give to her gestures and to her last words an accent of truth so incredible--her look, at once surprised and annoyed, seemed to express so naturally her spite at having for a moment forgotten the ugliness of Jacques Ferrand--that he, transported with frenzied hope, cried, clinging to the bars of the wicket, \"Cecily, return, command, I will be your tiger!\"  \"No, no, master,\" said Cecily, retreating still further from the wicket; \"and to lay the devil who tempts me--I am going to sing a song of my country. Master, do you hear? without, the wind redoubles, the tempest is unchained; what a fine night for two lovers, seated side by side near a sparkling fire!\"  \"Cecily, return!\" cried Jacques Ferrand, in a supplicating tone.  \"No, no, presently, when I can without danger; but the light from this lamp hurts my eyes, a soft languor weighs down my eyelids. I do not know what emotion agitates me; a demi-obscurity will please me more; one would say I am in the twilight of pleasure.\"  And Cecily went toward the chimney, put out the lamp, took a guitar suspended on the wall, and stirred the fire, whose blaze illuminated this large room.  From the narrow wicket where he remained immovable, such was the picture which Jacques Ferrand perceived. In the midst of the luminous horizon formed by the undulating light of the fire, Cecily, in a position full of languor, half reclining on a divan of pink satin, held a guitar, from whence she drew some harmonious preludes.  The blazing hearth shed its rosy light on the Creole, who appeared brilliantly illumined in the midst of the obscurity of the rest of the apartment.  To complete the effect of this picture, let the reader recall to his mind the mysterious and almost fantastic appearance of a room where the firelight struggles with the long, dark shadows which tremble on the ceiling and walls.  The storm redoubled its violence, its roaring could be heard from within.  While preluding on her guitar, Cecily fixed her magnetic glances on Jacques Ferrand, who, fascinated, could not withdraw.  \"Now, master,\" said the Creole, \"listen to a song of my country; we do not know how to make verses; we muse a simple recitative, without rhyme, and at each pause we improvise a couplet appropriate to the subject; it is very pastoral; it will please you, I am sure, master. This song is called the 'Loving Girl!' it is she who speaks.\"  And Cecily commenced a kind of recitative, much more accented by the expression of the voice than by the modulations of the song. A few soft and trembling chords served as an accompaniment. This was the song:    \"Flowers, everywhere flowers,    My lover comes! The hope of happiness enervates and destroys.    Soften the light of day--pleasure seeks a lucid darkness.    To the fresh perfume of flowers my love prefers my warm breath,    The glare of day shall not wound his eyes, for I will keep them closed         by my kisses.    My angel, come! My heart beats; my blood burns!    Come, come, come!\"  These words, chanted with as much ardor as if she had addressed an invisible lover, were, thus to speak, translated by the Creole into a theme of enchanting melody; her charming fingers drew from her guitar sounds full of delicious harmony.  The animated face of Cecily, her veiled and moistened eyes constantly fixed on those of Jacques Ferrand, expressed all the languor of the song. Words of love; intoxicating music; inflamed looks; silence; night! all conspired at this moment to disturb the reason of the notary. He cried, bewildered:  \"Mercy! Cecily! mercy I I shall go wild. Hush! I die. Oh! that I were mad!\"  \"Listen, then, to the second couplet,\" said the Creole, preluding anew.  And she continued her passionate recitative:    \"If my lover were there, and with his hand touched my soft neck, I should          shudder and die.    If he were there, and his hair touched my cheek, my cheek so pale would          become red.    My cheek so pale would be as fire.    Life of my soul, if you were there, my parched lips could not speak.    Life of my life, if you were there--expiring--I would ask no mercy.    Those whom I love as I love you, I kill.    My angel, come. Oh! come! My heart beats: my blood burns I    Come, come, come!\"  If the Creole had accented the first stanza with"]]]
