If your padrone beats you badly, run away from him. I would if I were in your place.”  “Addio, signore,” said the two boys.  “I suppose that means ‘good-by.’ Well, good-by, and better luck.”    CHAPTER IX  PIETRO THE SPY  Though from motives of policy the grocer had permitted the boys to warm themselves by his fire, he felt only the more incensed against them on this account, and when Mr. Pomeroy had gone determined to get rid of them.  “Haven’t you got warm yet?” he asked. “I can’t have you in my way all day.”  “We will go,” said Phil. “Come, Giacomo.”  He did not thank the grocer, knowing how grudgingly permission had been given.  So they went out again into the chill air, but they had got thoroughly warmed, and were better able to bear it.  “Where shall we go, Filippo?” asked the younger boy.  “We will go back to New York. It is not so cold there.”  Giacomo unhesitatingly assented to whatever Phil proposed. He was not self-reliant, like our hero, but always liked to have someone to lean upon.  They made their way back to Fulton Ferry in a leisurely manner, stopping here and there to play; but it was a bad day for business. The cold was such that no one stopped to give them anything, except that one young man dropped ten cents in Phil’s hand as he hurried by, on his way home.  At length they reached the ferry. The passengers were not so many in number as usual. The cabin was so warm and comfortable that they remained on board for two or three trips, playing each time. In this way they obtained about thirty cents more. They would have remained longer, but that one of the deck hands asked, “How many times are you going across for two cents?” and this made them think it prudent to go.  When six o’clock came Giacomo asked Phil, who acted as treasurer, how much money they had.  “Two dollars,” answered Phil.  “That is only one dollar for each.”  “Yes, Giacomo.”  “Then we shall be beaten,” said the little boy, with a sigh.  “I am afraid so.”  “And get no supper.”  “Yes,” said Phil; “unless,” he added, “we get some supper now.”  “With this money?” asked Giacomo, startled at the boldness of the suggestion.  “Yes; we shall be beaten at any rate. It will be no worse for us if we get some supper.”  “Will you buy some bread?”  “No,” said Phil, daringly. “I am going to buy some meat.”  “What will the padrone say?”  “I shall not tell the padrone.”  “Do you think he will find out?”  “No. Besides, we ought to have some supper after walking about all day.”  Evidently Phil had begun to think, and the essential injustice of laboring without proper compensation had impressed his youthful mind. Giacomo was more timid. He had not advanced as far as Phil, nor was he as daring. But I have already said that he was guided in a great measure by Phil, and so it proved in this case.  Phil, having made up his mind, set about carrying his plan into execution. Only a block distant was a cheap restaurant, where plates of meat were supplied to a poor class of customers at ten cents per plate.  “Let us go in here,” he said.  Giacomo followed, but not without trepidation. He knew that what they were about to do would be a heinous crime in the eyes of the padrone. Even Phil had never ventured upon such direct rebellion before. But Mr. Pomeroy’s suggestion that he should run away was beginning to bear fruit in his mind. He had not come to that yet, but he might. Why should he not earn money for his own benefit, as well as for the padrone? True, he was bound to the latter by a legal contract entered into by his father, but Phil, without knowing much about law, had an indistinct idea that the contract was a one-sided one, and was wholly for the advantage of the other party. The tyrant is always in danger of losing his hold upon the victim when the latter begins to think.  They entered the restaurant, and sat down at a table.  The tables were greasy. The floor was strewed with sawdust. The waiters were dirty, and the entire establishment was neither neat nor inviting. But it was democratic. No customers were sent away because they were unfashionably attired. The only requisite was money enough to defray their bills. Nevertheless Giacomo felt a little in awe even of the dirty waiters. His frugal meals were usually bought at the baker’s shop, and eaten standing in the street. Sitting down at a table, even though it was greasy, seemed a degree of luxury to which he was not entitled. But Phil more easily adapted himself to circumstances. He knew that he had as much right there as any other customer.  Presently a waiter presented himself.  “Have you ordered?” he asked.  “Give me some roast beef,” said Phil. “What will you have, Giacomo?”  “The same as you, Filippo,” said Giacomo, in Italian.  “What’s that?” asked the waiter, thinking he had named some dish.  “He will have some roast beef, too. Will you have some coffee, Giacomo?”  “If you have it,” answered the smaller boy.  So Phil gave the double order, and very soon the coffee and meat were placed before them. I suspect that few of my readers would have regarded these articles with any relish. One need not be fastidious to find fault with the dark-hued beverage, which was only a poor imitation of coffee, and the dark fragments of meat, which might have been horseflesh so far as appearance went. But to the two Italian boys it was indeed a feast. The coffee, which was hot, warmed their stomachs, and seemed to them like nectar, while the meat was as palatable as the epicure finds his choicest dishes. While eating, even Giacomo forgot that he was engaged in something unlawful, and his face was lighted up with rare satisfaction.  “It is good,” said Phil, briefly, as he laid down his knife and fork, after disposing of the last morsel upon his plate.  “I wish I could have such a supper every day,” said Giacomo.  “I will when I am a man,” said Phil.  “I don’t think I shall ever be a man,” said Giacomo, shaking his head.  “Why not?” asked Phil, regarding him with surprise.  “I do not think I shall live.”  “What makes you think so, Giacomo?” said Phil, startled.  “I am not strong, Filippo,” said the little boy, “I think I get weaker every day. I long so much to go back to Italy. If I could see my mother once more, I would be willing to die then.”  “You must not think of such things, Giacomo,” said Phil, who, like most healthy boys, did not like to think of death. “You will get strong when summer comes. The weather is bad now, of course.”  “I don’t think I shall, Filippo. Do you remember Matteo?”  “Yes, I remember him.”  Matteo was a comrade who had died six months before. He was a young boy, about the size and age of Giacomo.  “I dreamed of him last night, Filippo. He held out his hand to me.”  “Well?”  “I think I am going to die, like him.”  “Don’t be foolish, Giacomo,” said Phil. But, though he said this, even he was startled by what Giacomo had told him. He was ignorant, and the ignorant are prone to superstition; so he felt uncomfortable, but did not like to acknowledge it.  “You must not think of this, Giacomo,” he said. “You will be an old man some day.”  “That’s for you, Filippo. It isn’t for me,” said the little boy.  “Come, let us go,” said Phil, desirous of dropping the subject.  He went up to the desk, and paid for both, the sum of thirty cents.  “Now, come,” he said.  Giacomo followed him out, and they turned down the street, feeling refreshed by the supper they had eaten. But unfortunately they had been observed. As they left the restaurant, they attracted the attention of Pietro, whom chance had brought thither at an unfortunate time. His sinister face lighted up with joy as he realized the discovery he had made. But he wished to make sure that it was as he supposed. They might have gone in only to play and sing.  He crossed the street, unobserved by Phil and Giacomo, and entered the restaurant.  “Were my two brothers here?” he asked, assuming relationship.  “Two boys with fiddles?”  “Yes; they just went out.”  “Did they get supper?”  “Yes; they had some roast beef and coffee.”  “Thank you,” said Pietro, and he left the restaurant with his suspicions confirmed.  “I shall tell the padrone,” he said to himself.  “They will feel the stick to-night.”    CHAPTER X  FRENCH’S HOTEL  Pietro had one of those mean and malignant natures that are best pleased when they are instrumental in bringing others into trouble. He looked forward to becoming a padrone himself some time, and seemed admirably fitted by nature to exercise the inhuman office. He lost no time, on his return, in making known to his uncle what he had learned.  For the boys to appropriate to their own use money which had been received for their services was, in the eyes of the padrone, a crime of the darkest shade. In fact, if the example were generally followed, it would have made a large diminution of his income, though the boys might have been benefited. He listened to Pietro with an ominous scowl, and decided to inflict condign punishment upon the young offenders.  Meanwhile Phil and Giacomo resumed their wanderings. They no longer hoped to make up the large difference between what they had and the sum they were expected by the padrone to bring. As the evening advanced the cold increased, and penetrated through their thin clothing, chilling them through and through. Giacomo felt it the most. By and by he began to sob with the cold and fatigue.  “What is the matter, Giacomo?” asked Phil, anxiously.  “I feel so cold, Filippo--so cold and tired. I wish I could rest.”  The boys were in Printing House Square, near the spot where now stands the Franklin statue.  “If you want to rest, Giacomo,” said Phil, pityingly, “we will go into French’s Hotel a little while.”  “I should like to.”  They entered the hotel and sat down near the heater. The grateful warmth diffused itself through their frames, and Giacomo sank back in his seat with a sigh of relief.  “Do you feel better, Giacomo?”"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/671"],["title","Phil, the Fiddler (#8)"],["body"," asked his comrade.  “Yes, Filippo; I wish I could stay here till it is time to go home.”  “We will, then. We shall get no more money outside.”  “The padrone----”  “Will beat us at any rate. It will be no worse for us. Besides they may possibly ask us to play here.”  “I can play no more to-night, Filippo, I am so tired.”  Phil knew very little of sickness, or he might have seen that Giacomo was going to be ill. Exposure, fatigue, and privation had been too much for his strength. He had never been robust, and he had been subjected to trials that would have proved hard for one much stronger to bear.  When he had once determined to remain in the comfortable hotel, Phil leaned back in his chair also, and decided to enjoy all the comfort attainable. What though there was a beating in prospect?  He had before him two or three hours of rest and relief from the outside cold. He was something of a philosopher, and chose not to let future evil interfere with present good.  Near the two boys sat two young men--merchants from the interior of New York State, who were making a business visit to the metropolis.  “Well, Gardner,” said the first, “where shall we go to-night?”  “Why need we go anywhere?”  “I thought you might like to go to some place of amusement.”  “So I would if the weather were less inclement. The most comfortable place is by the fire.”  “You are right as to that, but the evening will be long and stupid.”  “Oh, we can worry it through. Here, for instance, are two young musicians,” indicating the little fiddlers. “Suppose we get a tune out of them?”  “Agreed. Here, boy, can you play on that fiddle?”  “Yes,” said Phil.  “Well, give us a tune, then. Is that your brother?”  “No, he is my comrade.”  “He can play, too.”  “Will you play, Giacomo?”  The younger boy roused himself. The two stood up, and played two or three tunes successfully. A group of loungers gathered around them and listened approvingly. When they had finished Phil took off his hat and went the rounds. Some gave, the two first mentioned contributing most liberally. The whole sum collected was about fifty cents.  Phil and Giacomo now resumed their seats. They felt now that they were entitled to rest for the remainder of the evening, since they had gained quite as much as they would have been likely to earn in wandering about the streets. The group that had gathered about them dispersed, and they ceased to be objects of attention. Fatigue and the warmth of the room gradually affected Giacomo until he leaned back and fell asleep.  “I won’t take him till it’s time to go back,” thought Phil.  So Giacomo slept on, despite the noises in the street outside and the confusion incident to every large hotel. As he sat asleep, he attracted the attention of a stout gentleman who was passing, leading by the hand a boy of ten.  “Is that your brother?” he asked in a low tone of Phil.  “No, signore; it is my comrade.”  “So you go about together?”  “Yes, sir,” answered Phil, bethinking himself to use English instead of Italian.  “He seems tired.”  “Yes; he is not so strong as I am.”  “Do you play about the streets all day?”  “Yes, sir.”  “How would you like that, Henry?” asked his father to the boy at his side.  “I should like to play about the streets all day,” said Henry, roguishly, misinterpreting the word “play.”  “I think you would get tired of it. What is your name, my boy?”  “Filippo.”  “And what is the name of your friend?”  “Giacomo.”  “Did you never go to school?”  Phil shook his head.  “Would you like to go?”  “Yes, sir.”  “You would like it better than wandering about the streets all day?”  “Yes, sir.”  “Why do you not ask your father to send you to school?”  “My father is in Italy.”  “And his father, also?”  “Si, signore,” answered Phil, relapsing into Italian.  “What do you think of that, Henry?” asked the gentleman. “How should you like to leave me, and go to some Italian city to roam about all day, playing on the violin?”  “I think I would rather go to school.”  “I think you would.”  “Are you often out so late, Filippo? I think that is the name you gave me.”  Phil shrugged his shoulders  “Always,” he answered.  “At what time do you go home?”  “At eleven.”  “It is too late for a boy of your age to sit up. Why do you not go home sooner?”  “The padrone would beat me.”  “Who is the padrone?”  “The man who brought me from Italy to America.”  “Poor boys!” said the gentleman, compassionately. “Yours is a hard life. I hope some time you will be in a better position.”  Phil fixed his dark eyes upon the stranger, grateful for his words of sympathy.  “Thank you,” he said.  “Good-night,” said the stranger, kindly.  “Good-night, signore.”  An hour passed. The City Hall clock near by struck eleven. The time had come for returning to their mercenary guardian. Phil shook the sleeping form of Giacomo. The little boy stirred in his sleep, and murmured, “Madre.” He had been dreaming of his mother and his far-off Italian home. He woke to the harsh realities of life, four thousand miles away from that mother and home.  “Have I slept, Filippo?” he asked, rubbing his eyes, and looking about him in momentary bewilderment.  “Yes, Giacomo. You have slept for two hours and more. It is eleven o’clock.”  “Then we must go back.”  “Yes; take your violin, and we will go.”  They passed out into the cold street, which seemed yet colder by contrast with the warm hotel they just left, and, crossing to the sidewalk that skirts the park, walked up Centre street.  Giacomo was seized with a fit of trembling. His teeth chattered with the cold. A fever was approaching, although neither he nor his companion knew it.  “Are you cold, Giacomo?” asked Phil, noticing how he trembled.  “I am very cold. I feel sick, Filippo.”  “You will feel better to-morrow,” said Phil; but the thought of the beating which his little comrade was sure to receive saddened him more than the prospect of being treated in the same way himself.  They kept on their way, past the Tombs with its gloomy entrance, through the ill-lighted street, scarcely noticed by the policeman whom they passed--for he was accustomed to see boys of their class out late at night--until at last they reached the dwelling of the padrone, who was waiting their arrival with the eagerness of a brutal nature, impatient to inflict pain.    CHAPTER XI  THE BOYS RECEPTION  Phil and Giacomo entered the lodging-house, wholly unconscious of the threatening storm, The padrone scowled at them as they entered but that was nothing unusual. Had he greeted them kindly, they would have had reason to be surprised.  “Well,” he said, harshly, “how much do you bring?”  The boys produced two dollars and a half which he pocketed.  “Is this all?” he asked.  “It was cold,” said Phil, “and we could not get more.”  The padrone listened with an ominous frown.  “Are you hungry?” he asked. “Do you want your supper?”  Phil was puzzled by his manner, for he expected to be deprived of his supper on account of bringing less money than usual. Why should the padrone ask him if he wanted his supper? Though he was not hungry, he thought it best to answer in the affirmative.  “What would you like?” asked the padrone.  Again Phil was puzzled, for the suppers supplied by the padrone never varied, always consisting of bread and cheese.  “Perhaps,” continued the padrone, meeting no answer, “you would like to have coffee and roast beef.”  All was clear now. Phil understood that he had been seen going in or out of the restaurant, though he could not tell by whom. He knew well enough what to expect, but a chivalrous feeling of friendship led him to try to shield his young companion, even at the risk of a more severe punishment to be inflicted upon himself.  “It was my fault,” he said, manfully. “Giacomo would not have gone in but for me.”  “Wicked, ungrateful boy!” exclaimed the padrone, wrathfully. “It was my money that you spent. You are a thief!”  Phil felt that this was a hard word, which he did not deserve. The money was earned by himself, though claimed by the padrone. But he did not venture to say this. It would have been revolutionary. He thought it prudent to be silent.  “Why do you say nothing?” exclaimed the padrone, stamping his foot. “Why did you spend my money?”  “I was hungry.”  “So you must live like a nobleman! Our supper is not good enough for you. How much did you spend?”  “Thirty cents.”  “For each?”  “No, signore, for both.”  “Then you shall have each fifteen blows, one for each penny. I will teach you to be a thief. Pietro, the stick! Now, strip!”  “Padrone,” said Phil, generously, “let me have all the blows. It was my fault; Giacomo only went because I asked him.”  If the padrone had had a heart, this generous request would have touched it; but he was not troubled in that way.  “He must be whipped, too,” he said. “He should not have gone with you.”  “He is sick, padrone,” persisted Phil. “Excuse him till he is better.”  “Not a word more,” roared the padrone, irritated at his persistence. “If he is sick, it is because he has eaten too much,” he added, with a sneer. “Pietro, my stick!”  The two boys began to strip mechanically, knowing that there was no appeal. Phil stood bare to the waist. The padrone seized the stick and began to belabor him. Phil’s brown face showed by its contortions the pain he suffered, but he was too proud to cry out. When the punishment was finished his back was streaked with red, and looked maimed and bruised.  “Put on your shirt!” commanded the tyrant.  Phil drew it on over his bleeding back and resumed his place among his comrades.  “Now!” said the padrone, beckoning to Giacomo.  The little boy approached shivering, not so much with cold as with the fever that had already begun to prey upon him.  Phil turned pale and sick as he looked at the padrone preparing to inflict punishment. He would gladly have left the room, but he knew that it would not be permitted.  The first blow descended heavily upon the shrinking form of the little victim."]]]
