The German officer was silent for several minutes and then he said: \"Why didn't you tell me this in the first place?\"  \"You didn't ask me,\" replied Jack, with a tantalizing laugh.  The German brought his right fist into the palm of his left hand with a resounding smack.  \"You English will pay dearly for every German ship stink,\" he exclaimed.  \"Maybe so,\" replied Jack, dryly, \"but it won't be a German fleet that makes us pay.\"  \"Enough of this!\" broke in the second German officer. \"Lieutenant Stein, you forget yourself, sir.  And as for you, sir,\" turning to Jack, \"you show no better taste.\"  \"I beg your Pardon,\" said Jack.  \"I wouldn't have said anything if he hadn't egged me on.\"  Lieutenant Stein was equally repentant.  \"I apologize,\" he said quietly to Jack.  \"I should not have spoken as I did.\"  \"Say no more about it,\" said Jack.  \"I was just as much to blame.\"  Frank now broke into the conversation.  \"What vessel is this?\" he asked, pointing to the low-lying bulk of the submarine, against which the small boat now scraped.  \"German submarine X-9,\" replied Lieutenant Stein, \"where, until we put into port again, you will be our prisoners.\"  The four now clambered to the top of the submarine.  Lieutenant Stein led the way to the entrance through the combined bridge and conning tower, and all went below.  At the foot of the short flight of steps stood a man in captain's uniform.  \"The sole survivors of a British cruiser, sir,\" said Lieutenant Stein to the captain, indicating the two lads.  \"I have not learned their names nor rank.\"  The two lads hastened to introduce themselves.  \"I am Captain von Cromp, commander of this vessel,\" said the captain gruffly.  \"You are my prisoners until I put into port and can turn you over to the proper authorities.\"  Jack and Frank bowed in recognition of their fate.  The captain turned to Lieutenant Stein.  \"You will see that the prisoners are well cared for,\" he said. \"They are in your custody.\"  The lads glanced curiously about as they were led along toward the lieutenant's cabin.  It was the first time either had been inside a submarine vessel, and both felt a trifle squeamish.  The boat was upon the surface of the sea now, however, and a dim light penetrated below.  The lieutenant's cabin, well forward, was fitted up luxuriously. There were several bunks in the little room, and the lieutenant motioned to them.  \"You will sleep there,\" he said quietly.  \"Make yourselves perfectly at home.  I guess there is no danger of your attempting to escape.  However, you must remain below and not ascend to the bridge under any circumstances.\"  He bowed, and left them.  \"I don't know as I am particularly fond of this kind of travel,\" Frank confided to Jack.  \"It's all right as long as we remain on the surface, but I'll bet it would feel queer to be moving along under the water.\"  \"Right you are,\" replied Jack.  \"However, we are here and we shall have to make the best of a bad situation.  Then, too, perhaps we can learn something that may prove of use to us later on.\"  The lads dined that night at the officers' mess and became quite well acquainted with all of them.  They found Captain von Cromp not half so gruff as he had been when they first came aboard. They were questioned about the service they had seen, and their story greatly surprised all the officers.  Upon Lieutenant Stein's request, the commander granted the lads permission to look over the vessel.  The lieutenant showed them how the vessel was submerged, by allowing one of the tanks to fill with water; how it rose again by forcing the water from the compartment by means of compressed air; how the air was purified when a lengthy submersion was necessary, and how the vessel was handled in times of action.  He showed them the periscope, and allowed them to peer through, although there was no need to use this, as the vessel was above water.  \"When the submarine is submerged,\" explained Lieutenant Stein, \"the periscope is the eye of the vessel.  Peering over the waves, it reflects what it sees into the watching human eye in the conning tower.  Destroy it, and the submarine is a blind thing, plunging to destruction.\"  \"Then the periscope is the one weak spot in a submarine?\" asked Frank.  \"Exactly,\" was the reply.  \"Of course, if it were destroyed, the vessel might rise immediately to the surface and so gain its bearings.  But in the midst of battle it would probably mean certain destruction; for when it rose the submarine would naturally be so close to the enemy that a single big shell would put it out of business.\"  The boys looked long at this strange mechanical eye.  Shaped like a small pipe, it ran up from the conning tower and protruded above the vessel.  A large lens at the top turned off as does an elbow in a stove pipe.  This portion, when necessary, moved in all directions.  When raised to its maximum height everything within a radius of ten miles is reflected in it.  \"The shaft can be lowered to within a few inches of the top of the water,\" the lieutenant explained, \"thus guarding against the danger of being hit.  The officer in the conning tower peers into the binoculars and sees just what the periscope sees.\"  \"Will you explain just how it works?\" asked Jack.               I  \"Certainly.  The periscope consists, as you may see, of a slender tubular shaft extending up through the conning tower of the submarine.  Each submarine is equipped with a pair--thus if one is shot away the other can be put in immediate use.  At the upper end of the shaft is a mirror lens.  Upon this mirror lens is reflected the surrounding surface of the ocean.  The image reflected there is carried down the tube to other lenses and then conveyed to enlarging binoculars.  Now do you understand?\"  \"Perfectly,\" replied Jack; \"and now as to the manner in which a submarine fights.  It is by torpedoes, as I understand it.\"  \"Exactly,\" replied the lieutenant, \"and the torpedo is the most deadly, effective and, it may be also said, intelligent of modern warfare.  One torpedo, striking the right kind of a blow, can destroy a battleship.  The submarine has no other effective, weapon than the torpedo, which is delivered from a small tube. There is this advantage in favor of the battleship, however: the submarine is a slow craft.  It is slower than the slowest battleship when it proceeds under water.  When it gets to the surface its speed is doubled, but then it is an easy target for the guns of the threatened battleship and also for the swift torpedo boats and torpedo destroyers which are always thrown out as escorts when a submarine attack is anticipated.  Some submarines are equipped with light rapid-firing guns, but these are of no more use in attacking on-water boats than would be a popgun.  Do I make myself clear?\"  \"Perfectly,\" said Jack.  \"It is indeed interesting,\" said Frank.  \"Can you tell us more?\"  The lieutenant continued:  \"Beyond these factors--the superior speed, the protection of torpedo boats and the weakness of the periscope--there has been no protection yet devised against the attack of a submarine.\"  \"But the torpedo nets--?\" interrupted Frank.  \"There is of course,\" the lieutenant went on, \"a crudely defensive measure called the torpedo net.  These are meshes of strong steel which are dropped down from the side of the warship and are supposed to catch the torpedo before it hits the side of the ship.\"  \"Well, don't they?\" asked Frank.  \"In theory,\" said the lieutenant, \"the torpedo explodes within the net and the force of its attack is more or less diminished. As a matter of fact, however, torpedo nets are not dependable. Why, most of our submarines are equipped with a formidable device for cutting these nets.  This device, in one form, resembles an enormous pair of sheers which cut through the nets like paper. In another form they are equipped with powerful tearing arms which drag the net away and expose the sides of the battleship to the deadly messenger from the torpedo tube.  Am I tiring you?\"  \"I should say not,\" replied both lads in one breath, and Frank added: \"I don't just understand how a submarine sinks and rises.\"  \"It's very simple,\" said the lieutenant, \"and at the same time I'll tell you something else.  The submarine is unaffected by tempests, and for this reason also is more deadly than a battleship.  The submarine can dive down into the depths where there is no movement of the waves, and it can remain under water for fourteen hours continuously.  This is accomplished by tanks which can be filled with water and, overcoming what is known as the 'margin of buoyancy,' submerge the vessel.  The air is replenished by special purifying devices and by tanks of oxygen. When the vessel wants to rise, it simply pumps out the water from the tanks.\"  \"It certainly is a wonderful invention,\" said Frank, when the lieutenant had concluded his explanation.  \"Indeed it is,\" agreed Jack.  \"You should be aboard when we are in action,\" smiled the lieutenant.  \"I am sure you would be greatly interested.\"  \"I don't doubt it,\" said Jack, \"although from what you have told us regarding the deadliness of submarines, I believe that I should rather witness action on a British submarine.\"  \"Nevertheless,\" said the lieutenant, \"you are likely to see action aboard the X-9, for I do not believe Captain Von Cromp will return to port until he has at least tried the effect of his torpedoes, on a ship or so of your countrymen.\"  \"May he go to defeat if he tries it!\" said Jack fervently.  \"In which case,\" said the lieutenant with good natured tolerance, \"you would undoubtedly go with us.\"  \"Even so,\" replied Jack, \"I still could not wish to see you get away.\"  The lieutenant glanced at him admiringly.  \"I believe you mean it,\" he said.  \"You are a brave lad.  But come, we had all better turn in now.\"  \"I guess you are right,\" said Frank; \"and thanks for the trouble you have taken to explain all this to us.\"  \"It was a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6337"],["title","The Boy Allies under Two Flags (#4)"],["body","e, I am sure,\" was the lieutenant's reply, and they all made their way to the officer's cabin, where they prepared to retire for the night.      CHAPTER V  UNDER THE SEA  But there was to be no sleep for any aboard the German submarine X-9 that night.  As the boys were just about to tumble into their bunks, there was the sound of a sudden commotion on the vessel.  Lieutenant Stein sprang to his feet, hastily donned what few clothes he had removed, and dashed from the cabin.  With all possible haste, the boys followed suit.  Men were rushing to and fro and no one heeded the boys' presence, although they were rudely thrust aside by hurrying members of the crew several times.  \"Wonder what's up?\" said Jack.  \"Don't know,\" replied Frank, \"unless they have sighted one of our ships.\"  \"By Jove!  Let us hope not,\" breathed Jack.  But this was indeed the cause of the excitement aboard the submarine.  A British battleship had been sighted in the distance, and Captain Von Cromp was preparing to attack the unsuspecting vessel, which had failed to sight her enemy, although the latter was fully exposed to view.  Frank and Jack approached the foot of the periscope, where they stood awaiting developments.  Outside a sudden storm swept the water of the North Sea in angry waves.  The water lifted up the little vessel with the regular motion of a high-running sea.  All was pitch dark.  The fact that men were hurrying about on deck, was only shown by the somber figures who now and then passed in front of a single lantern.  From out the engine room, already under water, arose the pound of heavy pounding and the weird crackling of the engines, as they were tried out.  Jack glanced at his watch.  It was 10:30.  Suddenly there came a shrill whistle from the little bridge of the submarine, standing high above the vessel, and covered with heavy canvass.  The officer in command, Captain Von Cromp himself, dressed hi heavy oilskins, raised a hand, the signal to go ahead.  A short, sharp signal to the engine room, a loud whirr of the motor, and the X-9 was speeding ahead.  On both sides of the ship long waves formed, shimmering with light foam in the blackness of the sea.  The X-9 moved westerly--toward the still unsuspecting battleship.  The heavens were covered with clouds.  Not a star was visible. It was impossible to see more than a few feet away from the strange craft.  Captain Von Cromp, with his experienced eye, tried in vain to penetrate through this wall of solid blackness. The wind kicked up the sea and the bridge was entirely flooded with water.  There was hot a sound to be heard, save the heavy droning of the motor and the swish of the water passing along the sides.  Suddenly, in the near distance, loomed up a great gray bulk, swinging high above the submarine upon the water.  It was the British battleship.  And now submarine X-9 had been discovered.  A heavy boom rang out, but the little craft was not damaged.  Another signal came to the ears of the two boys.  Men rushed upon deck and soon the submarine was prepared for action.  The flagpole was taken down.  Part of the bridge was folded together and securely fastened.  The periscope was fixed at its proper height.  Then the entrance through the combined bridge and conning tower was hermetically sealed.  A moment more and the tanks were opened, telling the lads that the submarine was about to submerge.  The gasoline motors stopped their endless song. From now on electricity would drive the vessel forward.  Near Frank and Jack, at the periscope, stood Lieutenant Stein, looking at the British ship.  The sailors took their stations near the torpedoes.  The interior of the boat was now lighted with two small electric bulbs.  They made the darkness visible, but gave no light outside.  Everywhere was the stale smell of oil.  The boys found it impossible to speak to each other because of the noise of the engine and the water.  The heat was oppressive.  From time to time the officer in command of the three torpedoes looked at his watch or at the compass, both of which he carried around his wrist.  Intently the men all watched the signboard on the wall in front of them.  The storm without made itself felt even in the depth.  Every motion of the water caused the submarine to rock up and down and up and down again.  Jack found himself thinking of the advantage of the man on board a warship.  He, at least, could go down with a last look at the world about him.  Below, nothing could be seen, nothing could be heard.  If the submarine went down, all would suffocate in the darkness beneath the water.  It was plain to Jack that Frank, as well as all the sailors and officers, was thinking along similar lines.  The expression on all faces was plain proof of it.  Suddenly the sailors sprang forward, forgetting in an instant heat, bad air and discomfort.  Following the gaze of the sailors, the lads turned their eyes to the signboard.  There, as if by magic, had sprung up the word:  \"Attention!\"  The officer in command of the torpedoes had his hand on the lever which would release the first deadly projectile already in the tube.  The sailors made ready to launch the second as soon as the first was gone.  Several seconds passed.  Frank and Jack stood in deathlike stillness.  Both realized the tragedy that was about to be enacted, and both were aware of their powerlessness to avert it.  Into the minds of both flashed a thought of springing upon their captors, but each, after a moment's reflection, realized the futility of such an action.  It would merely delay the firing of the first torpedo.  And so they stood while the seconds passed, the heart of each in his throat.  Suddenly the first sign on the board disappeared.  A moment later and a second command appeared.  Frank and Jack read it simultaneously, and both started forward with a cry.  The word that now stared them in the face, in red, glowing letters, was:  \"Fire!\"  With a single jerk, the officer released the first torpedo, even as both lads, unable to endure the suspense and inaction any longer, leaped upon him.  There was a short, metallic click, the noise of water rushing into the empty tube, and it was over.  The first torpedo had sped on its errand of destruction and death.  The German officer turned just in time to grapple with Jack, who was now upon him.  \"Seize them, men!\" he cried, and struck out sharply at the lad. But Jack was too quick for him, and his right fist went crashing into the German's face.  Frank was with him now, and the two turned to face the onrushing sailors.  Both struck out rapidly, but in spite of their resistance, they were soon overpowered by the numerical superiority of their foes, and thrown to the floor.  There, realizing the uselessness of further struggling, they gave up and lay still.  The German officer, having struggled to his feet in the meantime, now approached and stood over them.  Perceiving they were no longer offering resistance, he motioned the sailors to let them up.  The lads arose and faced the officer.  \"I realize your position better than you are probably aware,\" he said, speaking coldly, \"and for that reason I shall overlook your attack upon me.  I would have done as you did.  I could not stand by and see a German ship sent to the bottom without raising a hand to prevent it.  Go to your cabin, sirs.\"  The boys bowed, and obeyed.  But while the boys were scuffling with the German officer and some of the sailors, others had pushed a second torpedo into the tube.  And a sailor shouted, making himself heard by dint of a very powerful voice: \"Did we hit her?\"  Instinctively all kept count--one hundred meters, two hundred meters, three hundred, four hundred.  Under the water no sound penetrated.  Waiting was all that could be done.  For a few moments nothing happened.  Then, suddenly, every man on the boat, Jack and Frank in the cabin, the captain, officers and all, were almost thrown from their feet by a terrific jerk of the submarine.  Another jerk, and still another.  Then the submarine rolled as before--evenly.  A moment and the regular purring of the engines was heard again.  The submarine moved rapidly eastward.  She was on her way back home.  And an English battleship was at the bottom of the sea.      CHAPTER VI  THE AVENGERS   Frank picked himself up from the chair into which he had fallen because of the sudden lurching of the vessel.  \"What was that?\" he asked in alarm.  \"Have we been, hit?\"  \"I fear there is no such luck,\" replied Jack.  \"What, I am sure, is the answer to the German torpedo.\"  \"What do you mean?\"  \"The lurching of this vessel was caused by the explosion of the torpedo when it struck the British battleship.\"  \"But wouldn't we have heard the explosion?\"  \"No; there is no sound under water.\"  There were tears in Frank's eyes, and he was ashamed of them, as he said:  \"Think of all the poor fellows aboard!  Do you suppose any of them will be saved?\"  \"I am afraid not,\" replied Jack sadly.  \"And to think that we had to stand by unable even to warn them!\"  \"It is terrible!\" said Frank, sinking into a chair.  For many minutes the lads were silent, each offering up a silent prayer for the brave men who had gone to death for their country.  The silence was at length broken by the entrance of Lieutenant Stein.  He noticed the boys' sadness, and spoke softly to them.  \"It is the fortune of war,\" he said quietly.  \"Remember, there probably will be many German lives snuffed out just as easily. Come, brace up!\"  The lads brushed the tears from their eyes and rose to their feet.  \"I shall speak of it no more,\" said Jack, huskily.  \"Nor I,\" said Frank.  \"Good!\" said the lieutenant.  \"Now you had better turn in and get some sleep.  You must be tired out.\"  \"Sleep!\" ejaculated Jack.  \"I couldn't sleep now.\"  \"No, I suppose you couldn't,\" replied the lieutenant thoughtfully.  He was silent for some moments.  \"I'll tell you what I'll do,\" he said finally, \"we have come to the surface"]]]
