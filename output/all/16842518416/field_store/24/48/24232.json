Mrs. Dinsmore entered, leading the sobbing Enna by the hand; her face was flushed with passion, and addressing Elsie in tones of violent anger, she asked, \"What is the meaning of all this, you good-for-nothing hussy? Why are you always tormenting this poor child? Where is that paltry trifle that all this fuss is about? let me see it this instant.\"  Elsie drew the purse from her pocket, saying in tearful, trembling tones, \"It is a purse I was making for Miss Rose, ma'am; and I offered to make another just like it for Enna; but I cannot give her this one, because there would not be time to make another before Miss Rose goes away.\"  \"You _can_ not give it to her, indeed! You _will_ not, you mean; but I say you _shall;_ and I'll see if I'm not mistress in my own house. Give it to the child this instant; I'll not have her crying her eyes out that you may be humored in all your whims. There are plenty of handsomer ones to be had in the city, and if you are too mean to make her a present of it, I'll buy you another to-morrow.\"  \"But that would not be my work, and this is,\" replied Elsie, still retaining the purse, loath to let it go.  \"Nonsense! what difference will that make to Miss Rose?\" said Mrs. Dinsmore; and snatching it out of her hand, she gave it to Enna, saying, \"There, my pet, you shall have it. Elsie is a naughty, mean, stingy girl, but she shan't plague you while your mamma's about.\"  Enna cast a look of triumph at Elsie, and ran off with her prize, followed by her mother, while poor Elsie hid her face in Chloe's lap and cried bitterly.  It required all Chloe's religion to keep down her anger and indignation at this unjust and cruel treatment of her darling, and for a few moments she allowed her to sob and cry without a word, only soothing her with mute caresses, not daring to trust her voice, lest her anger should find vent in words. But at length, when her feelings had grown somewhat calmer, she said soothingly, \"Nebber mind it, my poor darlin' chile. Just go to de city and buy de prettiest purse you can find, for Miss Rose.\"  But Elsie shook her head sadly. \"I wanted it to be my own work,\" she sobbed, \"and now there is no time.\"  \"Oh! I'll tell you what, my pet,\" exclaimed Chloe suddenly, \"dere's de purse you was aknittin' for your papa, an' dey wouldn't send it for you; you can get dat done for de lady, and knit another for your papa, 'fore he comes home.\"  Elsie raised her head with a look of relief, but her face clouded again, as she replied, \"But it is not quite done, and I haven't the beads to finish it with, and Miss Rose goes day after to-morrow.\"  \"Nebber mind dat, darlin',\" said Chloe, jumping up; \"Pomp he been gwine to de city dis berry afternoon, an' we'll tell him to buy de beads, an' den you can get de purse finished 'fore to-morrow night, an' de lady don't go till de next day, an' so it gwine all come right yet.\"  \"Oh! yes, that will do; dear old mammy, I'm so glad you thought of it,\" said Elsie, joyfully. And rising, she went to her bureau, and unlocking a drawer, took from it a bead purse of blue and gold, quite as handsome as the one of which she had been so ruthlessly despoiled, and rolling it up in a piece of paper, she handed it to Chloe, saying: \"There, mammy, please give it to Pomp, and tell him to match the beads and the silk exactly.\"  Chloe hastened in search of Pomp, but when she found him, he insisted that he should not have time to attend to Miss Elsie's commission and do his other errands; and Chloe, knowing that he, in common with all the other servants, was very fond of the little girl, felt satisfied that it was not merely an excuse, therefore did not urge her request. She stood a moment in great perplexity, then suddenly exclaimed, \"I'll go myself. Miss Elsie will spare me, an' I'll go right long wid you, Pomp.\"  Chloe was entirely Elsie's servant, having no other business than to wait upon her and take care of her clothing and her room; and the little girl, of course, readily gave her permission to accompany Pomp and do the errand.  But it was quite late ere Chloe returned, and the little girl spent the evening alone in her own room. She was sadly disappointed that she could not even have her hour with Miss Rose, who was detained in the parlor with company whom she could not leave, and so the evening seemed very long and wore away very slowly.  But at last Chloe came, and in answer to her eager inquiries displayed her purchases with great satisfaction, saying, \"Yes, darlin', I'se got de berry t'ings you wanted.\"  \"Oh! yes,\" said Elsie, examining them with delight; \"they are just right; and now I can finish it in a couple of hours.\"  \"Time to get ready for bed now, ain't it, pet?\" asked Chloe; but before the little girl had time to answer, a servant knocked at the door, and handed in a note for her. It was from Miss Allison, and, hastily tearing it open, she read:  \"DEAR ELSIE--I am very sorry that we cannot have our reading together this evening; but be sure, darling, to come to me early in the morning; it will be our last opportunity, for, dear child, I have another disappointment for you. I had not expected to leave before day after to-morrow, but I have learned this evening that the vessel sails a day sooner than I had supposed, and therefore I shall be obliged to start on my journey to-morrow.  \"Your friend,                                              ROSE.\"  Elsie dropped the note on the floor and burst into tears.  \"What de matter, darlin'?\" asked Chloe, anxiously.  \"Oh! Miss Rose, dear, _dear_ Miss Rose is going tomorrow,\" she sobbed. Then hastily drying her eyes, she said: \"But I have no time for crying. I must sit up and finish the purse to-night, because there will not be time to-morrow.\"  It was long past her usual hour for retiring when at last her task, or rather her labor of love, was completed. Yet she was up betimes, and at the usual hour her gentle rap was heard at Miss Allison's door.  Rose clasped her in her arms and kissed her tenderly.  \"O Miss Rose! _dear, dear_ Miss Rose, what shall I do without you?\" sobbed the little girl. \"I shall have nobody to love me now but mammy.\"  \"You have another and a better friend, dear Elsie, who has said, 'I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee,'\" whispered Rose, with another tender caress.  \"Yes,\" said Elsie, wiping away her tears; \"and He is your Friend, too; and don't you think, Miss Rose, He will bring us together again some day?\"  \"I hope so indeed, darling. We must keep very close to Him, dear Elsie; we must often commune with Him in secret; often study His word, and try always to do His will. Ah! dear child, if we can only have the assurance that that dear Friend is with us--that we have His presence and His love, we shall be supremely happy, though separated from all earthly friends. I know, dear little one, that you have peculiar trials, and that you often feel the want of sympathy and love; but you may always find them in Jesus. And now we will have our reading and prayer as usual.\"  She took the little girl in her lap, and opening the Bible, read aloud the fourteenth chapter of John, a part of that touching farewell of our Saviour to His sorrowing disciples; and then they knelt to pray. Elsie was only a listener, for her little heart was too full to allow her to be anything more.  \"My poor darling!\" Rose said, again taking her in her arms, \"we will hope to meet again before very long. Who knows but your papa may come home, and some day bring you to see me. It seems not unlikely, as he is so fond of traveling.\"  Elsie looked up, smiling through her tears, \"Oh! how delightful that would be,\" she said. \"But it seems as though my papa would never come,\" she added, with a deep-drawn sigh.  \"Well, darling, we can hope,\" Rose answered cheerfully. \"And, dear child, though we must be separated in body for a time, we can still meet in spirit at the mercy-seat. Shall we not do so at this hour every morning?\"  Elsie gave a joyful assent.  \"And I shall write to you, darling,\" Rose said; \"I will write on my journey, if I can, so that you will get the letter in a week from the time I leave; and then you must write to me; will you?\"  \"If you won't care for the mistakes, Miss Rose. But you know I am a very little girl, and I wouldn't like to let Miss Day read my letter to you, to correct it. But I shall be so very glad to get yours. I never had a letter in my life.\"  \"I sha'n't care for mistakes at all, dear, and no one shall see your letters but myself,\" said Rose, kissing her. \"I should be as sorry as you to have Miss Day look at them.\"  Elsie drew out the purse and put it in her friend's hand, saying: \"It is all my own work, dear Miss Rose; I thought you would value it more for that.\"  \"And indeed I shall, darling,\" replied Rose, with tears of pleasure in her eyes. \"It is beautiful in itself, but I shall value it ten times more because it is your gift, and the work of your own dear little hands.\"  But the breakfast-bell now summoned them to join the rest of the family, and, in a few moments after they left the table, the carriage which was to take Rose to the city was at the door. Rose had endeared herself to all, old and young, and they were loath to part with her. One after another bade her an affectionate farewell. Elsie was the last. Rose pressed her tenderly to her bosom, and kissed her again and again, saying, in a voice half choked with grief, \"God bless and keep you, my poor little darling; my dear, dear little Elsie!\"  Elsie could not speak; and the moment the carriage had rolled away with her friend, she went to her own room, and locking herself in, cried long and bitterly. She had learned to love Rose very dearly, and to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6440"],["title","Elsie Dinsmore (#7)"],["body","upon her very much; and now the parting from her, with no certainty of ever meeting her again in this world, was the severest trial the poor child had ever known.     CHAPTER THIRD      \"The morning blush was lighted up by hope--     The hope of meeting him.\"                                  --Miss LANDON.     \"Unkindness, do thy office; poor heart, break.\"   A week had now passed away since Miss Allison's departure, and Elsie, to whom it had been a sad and lonely one, was beginning to look eagerly for her first letter.  \"It is just a week to-day since Rose left,\" remarked Adelaide at the breakfast table, \"and I think we ought to hear from her soon. She promised to write on her journey. Ah! here comes Pomp with the letters now,\" she added, as the servant man entered the room bearing in his hand the bag in which he always brought the letters of the family from the office in the neighboring city, whither he was sent every morning.  \"Pomp, you are late this morning,\" said Mrs. Dinsmore.  \"Yes, missus,\" replied the negro, scratching his head, \"de horses am berry lazy; spec dey's got de spring fever.\"  \"Do make haste, papa, and see if there is not one from Rose,\" said Adelaide coaxingly, as her father took the bag, and very deliberately adjusted his spectacles before opening it.  \"Have patience, young lady,\" said he. \"Yes, here is a letter for you, and one for Elsie,\" tossing them across the table as he spoke.  Elsie eagerly seized hers and ran away to her own room to read it. It was a feast to her, this first letter, and from such a dear friend, too. It gave her almost as much pleasure for the moment as Miss Rose's presence could have afforded.  She had just finished its perusal and was beginning it again, when she heard Adelaide's voice calling her by name, and the next moment she entered the room, saying: \"Well, Elsie, I suppose you have read your letter; and now I have another piece of news for you. Can you guess what it is?\" she asked, looking at her with a strange smile.  \"Oh! no, Aunt Adelaide; please tell me. Is dear Miss Rose coming back?\"  \"O! nonsense; what a guess!\" said Adelaide. \"No, stranger than that. My brother Horace--your papa--has actually sailed for America, and is coming directly home.\"  Elsie sprang up, her cheeks flushed, and her little heart beating wildly.  \"O Aunt Adelaide!\" she cried, \"is it really true? is he coming? and will he be here soon?\"  \"He has really started at last; but how soon he will be here I don't know,\" replied her aunt, turning to leave the room. \"I have told you all I know about it.\"  Elsie clasped her hands together, and sank down upon a sofa, Miss Rose's letter, prized so highly a moment before, lying unheeded at her feet; for her thoughts were far away, following that unknown parent as he crossed the ocean; trying to imagine how he would look, how he would speak, what would be his feelings toward her.  \"Oh!\" she asked, with a beating heart, \"_will_ he _love_ me? My own papa! will he let me love him? will he take me in his arms and call me his own darling child?\"  But who could answer the anxious inquiry? She must just wait until the slow wheels of time should bring the much longed-for, yet sometimes half-dreaded arrival.  Elsie's lessons were but indifferently recited that morning, and Miss Day frowned, and said in a tone of severity that it did not agree with her to receive letters; and that, unless she wished her papa to be much displeased with her on his expected arrival, she must do a great deal better than that.  She had touched the right chord then; for Elsie, intensely anxious to please that unknown father, and, if possible, gain his approbation and affection, gave her whole mind to her studies with such a determined purpose that the governess could find no more cause for complaint.  But while the child is looking forward to the expected meeting with such longing affection for him, how is it with the father?  Horace Dinsmore was, like his father, an upright, moral man, who paid an outward respect to the forms of religion, but cared nothing for the vital power of godliness; trusted entirely to his morality, and looked upon Christians as hypocrites and deceivers. He had been told that his little Elsie was one of these, and, though he would not have acknowledged it even to himself, it had prejudiced him against her. Then, too, in common with all the Dinsmores, he had a great deal of family pride; and, though old Mr. Grayson had been a man of sterling worth, intelligent, honest, and pious, and had died very wealthy, yet because he was known to have begun life as a poor boy, the whole family were accustomed to speak as though Horace had stooped very much in marrying his heiress.  And Horace himself had come to look upon his early marriage as a piece of boyish folly, of which he was rather ashamed; and so constantly had Mr. Dinsmore spoken in his letters of Elsie as \"old Grayson's grandchild,\" that he had got into the habit of looking upon her as a kind of disgrace to him; especially as she had always been described to him as a disagreeable, troublesome child.  He had loved his wife with all the warmth of his passionate nature, and had mourned bitterly over her untimely death; but years of study, travel and worldly pleasures had almost banished her image from his mind, and he seldom thought of her except in connection with the child for whom he felt a secret dislike.  Scarcely anything but the expected arrival was now spoken or thought of at Roselands, and Elsie was not the only one to whom old Time seemed to move with an unusually laggard pace.  But at length a letter came telling them that they might look upon it as being but one day in advance of its writer; and now all was bustle and preparation.  \"O mammy, mammy!\" exclaimed Elsie, jumping up and down, and clapping her hands for joy, as she came in from her afternoon ride, \"just think! papa, dear papa, will be here to-morrow morning.\"  She seemed wild with delight; but suddenly sobered down, and a look of care stole over the little face, as the torturing question recurred to her mind, \"_Will he love me?_\"  She stood quite still, with her eyes fixed thoughtfully, and almost sadly, upon the floor, while Chloe took off her riding dress and cap and smoothed her hair. As she finished arranging her dress she clasped the little form in her arms, and pressed a fond kiss on the fair brow, thinking to herself that was the sweetest and loveliest little face she had ever looked upon.  Just at that moment an unusual bustle was heard in the house.  Elsie started, changed color, and stood listening with a throbbing heart.  Presently little feet were heard running rapidly down the hall, and Walter, throwing open the door, called out, \"Elsie, he's come!\" and catching her hand, hurried her along to the parlor door.  \"Stop, stop, Walter,\" she gasped as they reached it; and she leaned against the wall, her heart throbbing so wildly she could scarcely breathe.  \"What is the matter?\" said he, \"are you ill? come along;\" and pushing the door open, he rushed in, dragging her after him.  So over-wrought were the child's feelings that she nearly fainted; everything in the room seemed to be turning round, and for an instant she scarcely knew where she was.  But a strange voice asked, \"And who is this?\" and looking up as her grandfather pronounced her name, she saw a stranger standing before her--very handsome, and very youthful-looking, in spite of a heavy dark beard and mustache--who exclaimed hastily, \"What! this great girl _my_ child? really it is enough to make a man feel old.\"  Then, taking her hand, he stooped and coldly kissed her lips.  She was trembling violently, and the very depth of her feelings kept her silent and still; her hand lay still in his, cold and clammy.  He held it an instant, at the same time gazing searchingly into her face; then dropped it, saying in a tone of displeasure, \"I am not an ogre, that you need be so afraid of me; but there, you may go; I will not keep you in terror any longer.\"  She rushed away to her own room, and there, throwing herself upon the bed, wept long and wildly. It was the disappointment of a lifelong hope. Since her earliest recollection she had looked and longed for this hour; and it seemed as though the little heart would break with its weight of bitter anguish.  She was all alone, for Chloe had gone down to the kitchen to talk over the arrival, not doubting that her darling was supremely happy in the possession of her long looked-for parent.  And so the little girl lay there with her crushed and bleeding heart, sobbing, mourning, weeping as though she would weep her very life away, without an earthly friend to speak one word of comfort.  \"O papa, papa!\" she sobbed, \"my own papa, you do not love me; me, your own little girl. Oh! my heart will break. O mamma, mamma! if I could only go to you; for there is no one here to love me, and I am so lonely, oh! _so_ lonely and desolate.\"  And thus Chloe found her, when she came in an hour later, weeping and sobbing out such broken exclamations of grief and anguish.  She was much surprised, but comprehending at once how her child was suffering, she raised her up in her strong arms, and laying the little head lovingly against her bosom, she smoothed the tangled hair, kissed the tear-swollen eyes, and bathed the throbbing temples, saying, \"My precious pet, my darlin' chile, your ole mammy loves you better dan life; an' did my darlin' forget de almighty Friend dat says, _I_ have loved thee with an everlasting love,' an' 'I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee'? He sticks closer dan a brudder, precious chile, and says,'though a woman forget her sucking child, He will not forget _His_ chillen.' Mothers love dere chillens better dan fathers, darlin', and so you see Jesus' love is better dan all other love; and I _knows_ you hes got dat.\"  \"O mammy! ask Him to take me to Himself, and to mamma--for oh! I am very lonely, and I want to die!\"  \"Hush, "]]]
