For twenty years he was a teacher in the Public Schools of Boston, where he came in close contact with boy life. These twenty years taught him how to reach the boy's heart and interest as the popularity of his books attest.  His story writing began in 1850 when he was twenty-eight years old and his first book was published in 1853. He also edited \"The Oliver Optic Magazine,\" \"The Student and Schoolmate,\" \"Our Little Ones.\"  Mr. Adams died at the age of seventy-five years, in Boston, March 27, 1897.  He was a prolific writer and his stories are most attractive and unobjectionable. Most of his books were published in series. Probably the most famous of these is \"The Boat Club Series\" which comprises the following titles:  \"The Boat Club,\" \"All Aboard,\" \"Now or Never,\" \"Try Again,\" \"Poor and Proud,\" \"Little by Little.\" All of these titles will be found in this edition.  Other well-known series are his \"Soldier Boy Series,\" \"Sailor Boy Series,\" \"Woodville Stories.\" The \"Woodville Stories\" will also be found in this edition.     CHAPTER I  THE SQUALL ON THE LAKE   \"Stand by, Captain John!\" shouted Lawry Wilford, a stout boy of fourteen, as he stood at the helm of a sloop, which was going before the wind up Lake Champlain.  \"What's the matter, Lawry?\" demanded the captain.  \"We're going to have a squall,\" continued the young pilot, as he glanced at the tall peaks of the Adirondacks.  There was a squall in those clouds, in the judgment of Lawry Wilford; but having duly notified the captain of the impending danger to his craft, he did not assume any further responsibility in the management of the sloop. It was very quiet on the lake; the water was smooth, and the tiny waves sparkled in the bright sunshine. There was no roll of distant thunder to admonish the voyagers, and the youth at the helm was so much accustomed to squalls and tempests, which are of frequent occurrence on the lake, that they had no terrors to him. It was dinner-time, and the young pilot, fearful that the unexpected guest might reduce the rations to a low ebb for the second table, was more concerned about this matter than about the squall.  Captain John, as he was familiarly called on board the _Missisque,_ which was the name of the sloop, was not a man to be cheated out of any portion of his dinner by the approach of a squall; and though his jaws may have moved more rapidly after the announcement of the young pilot, he did not neglect even the green-apple pies, the first of the season, prepared with care and skill by Mrs. Captain John, who resided on board, and did \"doctor's\" duty at the galley. Captain John did not abate a single mouthful of the meal, though he knew how rapidly the mountain showers and squalls travel over the lake. The sloop did not usually make more than four or five miles an hour, being deeply laden with lumber, which was piled up so high on the deck that the mainsail had to be reefed, to make room for it.  The passenger, Mr. Randall, was a director of a country bank, journeying to Shoreham, about twenty miles above the point where he had embarked in the _Missisque_. He had crossed the lake in the ferry, intending to take the steamer at Westport for his destination. Being a man who was always in a hurry, but never in season, he had reached the steamboat landing just in time to see the boat moving off. Procuring a wherry, and a boy to row it, he had boarded the _Missisque_ as she passed up the lake; and, though the sloop was not a passenger-boat, Captain John had consented to land him at Shoreham.  Mr. Randall was a landsman, and had a proper respect for squalls and tempests, even on a fresh-water lake. He heard the announcement of Lawry Wilford with a feeling of dread and apprehension, and straightway began to conjure up visions of a terrible shipwreck, and of sole survivors, clinging with the madness of desperation to broken spars, in the midst of the storm-tossed waters. But Mr. Randall was a director of a country bank, and a certain amount of dignity was expected and required of him. His official position before the people of Vermont demanded that he should not give way to idle fears. If Captain Jones, who was not a bank director, could keep cool, it was Mr. Randall's solemn duty to remain unmoved, or at least to appear to remain so.  The passenger finished the first course of the dinner, which Mrs. Captain John had made a little more elaborate than usual, in honor of the distinguished guest; but he complained of the smallness of his appetite, and it was evident that he did not enjoy the meal after the brief colloquy between the skipper and the pilot. He was nervous; his dignity was a \"bore\" to him, and was maintained at an immense sacrifice of personal ease; but he persevered until a piece of the dainty green-apple pie was placed before him, when he lacerated the tender feelings of Mrs. Captain John by abruptly leaving the table and rushing on deck.  This hurried movement was hardly to be regarded as a sacrifice of his dignity, for it was made with what even the skipper's lady was compelled to allow was a reasonable excuse.  \"Gracious!\" exclaimed Mr. Randall, as the tempting piece of green-apple pie, reeking with indigenous juices was placed before him.  At the same moment the bank director further indicated his astonishment and horror by slapping both hands upon his breast in a style worthy of Brutus when Rome was in peril.  \"What's the matter, squire?\" demanded Captain John, dropping his knife and fork, and suspending the operation of his vigorous jaws till an explanation could be obtained.  \"I've left my coat on deck,\" replied Mr. Randall, rising from his chair.  \"It's just as safe there as 'twould be on your back, squire,\" added the skipper.  \"There's six thousand dollars in the pocket of that coat,\" said the bank director, with a gasp of apprehension. \"Where's my coat?\" demanded he.  \"There it is,\" replied Lawry Wilford, pointing to the garment under the rail. \"We had a flaw of wind just now, and it came pretty near being blowed overboard.\"  \"Gracious!\" exclaimed Mr. Randall, as he clutched the coat. \"I'm too careless to live! There's six thousand dollars in a pocket of that coat.\"  \"Six thousand dollars!\" ejaculated Lawry, whose ideas of such a sum of money were very indefinite. \"I should say you ought not to let it lie round loose in this way.\"  \"I'm very careless; but the money is safe,\" continued the director.  \"Stand by, Captain John!\" suddenly shouted Lawry, with tremendous energy, as he put the helm down. The squall was coming up the lake in the track of the _Missisque_; a dull, roaring sound was heard astern; and all the mountain peaks had disappeared, closed in by the dense volume of black clouds. The episode of the bank director's coat had distracted the attention of the young pilot for a moment, and he had not observed the rapid swoop of the squall, as it bore down upon the sloop. He leaped over the piles of lumber to the forecastle, and had cast loose the peak-halyard, when Captain John tumbled up the companionway in time to see that he had lingered too long over the green-apple pie, and that one piece would have been better for his vessel, if not for him.  \"Let go the throat-halyard!\" roared he. \"Down with the mainsail! down with the mainsail!\"  Lawry did not need any prompting to do his duty; but before he could let go the throat-halyard, the squall was upon the sloop. Mr. Randall had seized hold of the rail, and was crouching beneath the bulwark, expecting to go to the bottom of the lake, for he was too much excited to make a comparison of the specific gravities of pine boards and fresh water, and therefore did not realize that lumber would float, and not sink.  The squall did its work in an instant; and before the bank director had fairly begun to tremble, the rotten mainsail of the _Missisque_ was blown into ribbons, and the \"flapping flitters\" were streaming in the air. Piece after piece was detached from the bolt-rope, and disappeared in the heavy atmosphere. The sloop, in obedience to her helm, came about, and was now headed down the lake. The rain began to fall in torrents, and Mr. Randall was as uncomfortable as the director of a country bank could be.  \"Go below, sir!\" shouted Captain John to the unhappy man.  \"Is it safe?\" asked Mr. Randall.  \"Safe enough.\"  \"Won't she sink?\"  \"Sink? no; she can't sink,\" replied the skipper. \"The wu'st on't's over now.\"  The fury of the squall was spent in a moment, and then the fury of Captain John began to gather, as he saw the remnants of the sail flapping at the gaff and the boom. The _Missisque_ and her cargo were safe, and not a single one of the precious lives of her crew had been sacrificed; but the skipper was as dissatisfied as the skipper of a lake sloop could be; more so, probably, than if the vessel had gone to the bottom, and left him clinging for life to a lone spar on the angry waters, for men are often more reasonable under great than under small misfortunes.  \"Why didn't you let go that throat-halyard?\" said he, as he walked forward to where the young pilot stood.  \"I did,\" replied Lawry quietly.  \"You did! What was the use of lettin' it go after the squall had split the sail? Why didn't you do it sooner?\"  \"I did it as soon as I saw the squall coming down on us.\"  \"Why didn't you see it before then?\" growled Captain John.  \"I told you the squall was coming half an hour ago. Why didn't you come on deck, and attend to your vessel?\"  \"Don't be sassy,\" said Captain John.  \"I'm not the skipper of this craft. If I had been, that sail would have been safe. I told you the squall was coming,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6572"],["title","Haste and Waste; Or, the Young Pilot of Lake Champlain.

I thought you knew enough to take in sail when you saw a squall comin'.\"  \"I should have taken in sail long ago if I had thought the captain didn't know enough to come on deck when there was a squall coming up,\" replied Lawry.  \"I don't want nothin' more of you.\"  \"And I don't want anything more of you,\" added Lawry smartly. \"I've got almost home.\"  \"What do you s'pose I'm goin' to do here, eighty mile from Whitehall, with the mainsail blowed clean out?\" snarled Captain John, as he followed Lawry.  \"Mind your vessel better than you have, I hope.\"  \"Don't be sassy, boy.\"  \"You needn't growl at me because you neglected your duty. I did mine. I was casting off the halyards when the squall came.\"  \"Why didn't you do it before? That's what I want to know.\"  \"I had no orders from the captain. Men on board a vessel don't take in sail till they are told to do so. When I saw the squall coming, half an hour ago, I let you know it; that was all I had to do with it.\"  \"I don't want you in this vessel; you are too smart for me,\" continued Captain John.  \"I'll leave her just as soon as we get to Port Rock,\" said Lawry, sitting down on the rail.  The rain ceased in a few moments, and the skipper ordered the jib, which had before been useless, to be set. At the invitation of Mrs. Captain John, Lawry went below and ate his dinner, to which he felt himself entitled, for he was working his passage up from Plattsburg. By the time he had disposed of the last piece of green-apple pie on board, the _Missisque_ was before Port Rock, which was the home of the young pilot, and he saw his father's ferry-boat at the shore as he came on deck.  \"Will you put me ashore here, Captain John?\" asked Lawry.  \"Yes, I will; and I'm glad to get rid of you,\" replied the captain testily.  \"I think I will land here, also,\" added the bank director. \"Now you have lost your sail, I'm afraid you won't get along very fast.\"  \"I don't expect I shall. I sha'n't get to Shoreham till to-morrow morning with this wind. I'm sorry it happened so; but that boy didn't mind what he was about.\"  \"The captain didn't mind what he was about,\" added Lawry. \"He needn't lay it to me, when it was all his own fault.\"  \"I will cross the lake, and get a horse at Pointville, so that I shall be in Shoreham by five o'clock,\" continued the bank director.  Captain John ordered one of the men to pull Mr. Randall and Lawry ashore in the boat, and in a few minutes they were landed at Port Rock.     CHAPTER II  THE PORT ROCK FERRY   Lawrence Wilford was a full-fledged water-fowl. From his earliest childhood he had paddled in Lake Champlain. His father had a small place, consisting of ten acres of land with a small cottage; but it was still encumbered with a mortgage, as it had been for twenty years, though the note had passed through several hands, and had been three times renewed. John Wilford was not a very sagacious nor a very energetic man, and had not distinguished himself in the race for wealth or for fame. He wanted to be rich, but he was not willing to pay the price of riches.  His place was a short distance from the village of Port Rock, and John Wilford, at the time he had purchased the land and built his house, had established a ferry, which had been, and was still, his principal means of support; for there was considerable travel between Port Rock and Pointville, on the Vermont side of the lake.  The ferryman was a poor man, and was likely to remain a poor man to the end of his life. Hardly a day passed in which he did not sigh to be rich, and complain of the unequal and unjust distribution of property. He could point to a score of men who had not worked half so hard as he had, in his own opinion, that had made fortunes, or at least won a competence, while he was as poor as ever, and in danger of having his place taken away from him. People said that John Wilford was lazy; that he did not make the most of his land, and that his ferry, with closer attention to the wants of passengers, might be made to pay double the amount he made from it. He permitted the weeds to grow in his garden, and compelled people to wait by the hour for a passage across the lake.  John Wilford wondered that he could not grow rich, that he could not pay off the mortgage on his place. He seldom sat down to dinner without grumbling at his hard lot. His wife was a sensible woman. She did not wonder that he did not grow rich; only that he contrived to keep out of the poorhouse. She was the mother of eight children, and if he had been half as smart as she was, prosperity would have smiled upon the family. As it was, her life was filled up with struggles to make the ends meet; but, though she had the worst of it, she did not complain, and did all she could to comfort and encourage her thriftless husband.  The oldest son was as near like his father as one person could be like another. He was eighteen years old, and was an idle and dissolute fellow. Lawrence, the second son, inherited his mother's tack and energy. He was observing and enterprising, and had already made a good reputation as a boatman and pilot. He had worked in various capacities on board of steamers, canal-boats, sloops, and schooners, and in five years had visited every part of the lake from Whitehall to St. Johns.  Speaking technically, his bump of locality was large, and he was as familiar with the navigation of the lake as any pilot on its waters. Indeed, he had occasionally served as a pilot on board steamers and other vessels, which had earned for him the name of the Young Pilot, by which he was often called. But his business was not piloting, for there was but little of this work to be done. Unlike his father, he was willing to do anything which would afford him a fair compensation, and in his five years of active life on the lake he had been a pilot, a deck-hand, a waiter, and a kitchen assistant on board steamers, and a sailor, helmsman, and cook on board other craft. He picked up considerable money, for a boy, by his enterprise, which, like a good son with a clear apprehension of domestic circumstances, he gave to his mother. At the time of his introduction to the reader, Lawry had just piloted a canal-boat, with movable masts, from Whitehall to Plattsburg, and was working his passage home on the \"_Missisque_.  \"Captain John feels bad about the loss of his sail,\" said Mr. Randall, as the sloop's boat pulled off from the shore.  \"Yes, he does; but it was his own fault,\" replied Lawry. \"He paid too much attention to his dinner at the time.\"  \"That's true; he was very fond of the green-apple pies.\"  \"Well, they were good,\" added the young pilot.  \"I'm sorry he lost his sail.\"  \"It wasn't worth much, though it was a bad time to lose it.\"  \"He lost his temper, too. I wanted to land on the other side, but the captain was so cross I didn't like to ask him when we were so close to this shore. Your father is the ferryman, I believe.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Will you ask him to take me over?\"  \"He's going right over in the large boat, for there's a team waiting for him,\" replied Lawry, pointing to a horse and wagon, the owner of which had sounded the horn just as the passengers from the boat landed.  \"Ask him to be as quick as possible, for I'm in a hurry,\" added the bank director.  \"Won't you come into the house, sir?\"  \"No, I will sit down under this tree.\"  Lawry went into the house, where the family were at dinner, the meal having been delayed by the absence of the ferryman on the other side of the lake. The youth was greeted coldly by his father, and very warmly by his mother.  \"I'm glad you've got home, Lawry, for Mr. Sherwood has been after you three times,\" said Mrs. Wilford, when the young pilot had been duly welcomed by all the family.  \"What does he want?\" asked Lawry.  \"His little steamboat is at Port Henry, and he wants you to go up and pilot her down.\"  \"The _Woodville?_\"  \"Yes, that's her name, I believe.\"  \"Well, I'm all ready to go.\"  \"Sit down and eat your dinner.  \"I've been to dinner.\"  \"Mr. Sherwood wanted you to go up in the _Sherman_; but it is too late for her, and he may go in the night boat.\"  \"I'm ready when he is. Father, there is a gentleman outside who wants to go over the lake; and there is a team waiting in the road,\" continued Lawry.  \"They must wait till I've done my dinner,\" replied the ferryman. \"Who is the gentleman?\"  \"Mr. Randall; he is a director in a bank, and has six thousand dollars with him.\"  \"I suppose so; every man but me has six thousand dollars in his pocket. Where's he going to?\"  \"To Shoreham, and he wants to get there by five o'clock, if he can.\"  \"What's he traveling with so much money for?\"  \"I don't know. It is in his coat pocket, and it would have gone overboard if it hadn't been for me.\"  The ferryman finished his dinner in moody silence. He seemed to be thinking of the subject always uppermost in his mind, his thoughts stimulated, no doubt, by the fact that his expected passenger carried a large sum of money on his person.  \"Mr. Randall is in a hurry, father,\" interposed Lawry, when the ferryman had sat a good half-hour after his son's arrival.  \"He must wait till I get ready. He's got money, and I haven't; but I'm just as good as he is. I don't know why I'm poor when so many men are rich. But I'm going to be rich, somehow or other,\" said he, with more earnestness than he usually exhibited. \"I'm too honest for my own good. I'm going to do as other men do; and I shall wake up rich some morning, as they do. Then I sha'n't have to go when folks blow the horn. They'll be willing to wait for me then.\"  \"Don't keep the gentleman waiting, father,\" added Mrs. Wilford.  \"I'm going to be rich, somehow or other,\" continued the ferryman, still pursuing the exciting line of thought he had before taken up. \"I'm going to be rich, by hook or by crook.\"  \"This making haste to get rich ruins men sometimes, husband; and haste"]]]
