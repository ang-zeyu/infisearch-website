Do you still think Walter Harris is a turtle?    ESTHER.\"  Scout-Pace Pee-wee got possession of this card, made an elaborate birch, bark frame for it, and hung it up in the Ravens' tent, where it remained ostentatiously displayed until the bitter day of reckoning, which came not long after.  To Tom Slade the wretched, slum-stained boy whose whole poor program had been to call names and throw stones, the camp routine, the patrol rivalries and reprisals, the hikes, the stunts, the camp-fire yarns, the stalking and tracking, were like the designs in a kaleidoscope.  Observant persons noticed how he began to say \"I saw\" instead of \"I seen\"; \"those\" instead of \"them,\" and how his speech improved in many other ways. This was largely in the interest of the signalling, about which he had come to be a perfect fiend. It sent him to the dictionary to find out how to spell words which were to be flashed or wigwagged; and from spelling them properly he came to pronounce them properly.  When he found that it was possible to tell a piece of oak from a piece of ash by smelling it, if the sense of smell were good, why, that was a knock-out blow for cigarettes. He wasn't going to let the Ravens get away with that species of scouting proficiency.  Next to signalling work the thing that engrossed Tom's thoughts was tracking, which he was forever practicing and which he now looked to as the one remaining accomplishment which would advance him to the Second Class.  More than a month of scout life had passed for him and he was eligible in that particular; he was ready, though a trifle shaky, on the \"first aid\" business; as for signalling, he had but one rival and that was Roy; and he could jog along at scout pace with anyone except Pee-wee. He was prepared to chop his way into the Second Class with knife or hatchet, as per requirements; he could kindle a fire in the open and cook you a passable meal, though he would never be the equal of Roy as a chef.  He knew the points of the compass also, and there were but two things about which he was still in doubt. These were the tracking and the financial business. He felt that if he could do a good tracking stunt it might compensate for his lack in cooking proficiency and for his omission in another particular.  It was now the ambition of his life to be a Second Class Scout; he thought of it by day and dreamed of it by night, and he wrestled with a dogged persistence with those things in which he was not skillful because they were not in his line.  It was in the interest of this ambition that he joined Mr. Ellsworth one morning as the latter was starting out from camp on one of his \"auto confabs,\" as the boys called his strolls, for on these he was wont to formulate new policies and schemes and, as a rule, he went alone.  \"Come along, Tommy boy,\" said he cheerily. \"Got something you want to say?\"  \"Yes, sir. I think I can do that tracking stunt in Paragraph Four an' if I do an' make it a good one, I was wondering if--I s'pose--would you--would you think those potatoes I cooked yesterday were all right?\"  \"Very fair, Tommy.\"  \"Would it pass for Test Eight?\"  \"Oh, I think maybe so; we all have our specialties, Tom.\"  \"I'm a little shaky on first aid.\"  \"I guess you can get away with that all right.\"  \"Well then,\" said Tom, \"there's only one thing to prevent--that is, if I do the tracking stunt.\"  \"Yes? What's that?\"  \"It's about the money.\"  \"So?\"  \"Yes, sir; I've got that five dollars Mr. Schmitt gave me for the extra work when he opened the branch store.\"  \"Where've you got that, Tom?\"  \"I've got it 'round my neck on a strong cord. I made a bow line knot. It's in my membership book to keep it clean.\"  It was a new bill and he had always kept it clean.  \"The rule says it must be in the bank--one dollar anyway. But I don't want to break it. One day I was going to ask Roy to give me five ones for it and then I decided not to. I like one bill better, don't you?\"  \"Yes, I don't know but what I do, Tom,\" said Mr. Ellsworth, smiling.  \"Did I tell you it was a new one?\"  \"No.\"  \"Well, 'tis.\"  \"All right, Tommy. Don't you worry about that. Just keep the bow line knot good and tight and think of potatoes and bandages and if you can make that tracking stunt something special so as to just knock the Commissioner off his feet, I guess it'll land you in the Second Class. One thing has to make up for another, you know. I've got to stand guard because if I didn't you fellows would be all waltzing scout-pace into the Second Class. But don't worry about financial matters--that's what's turning Mr. Temple's hair gray. When I go into town I'll put that five-spot in the bank for you, hey?\"  \"Then if I took it out of the bank would it be the same bill?\"  \"No, it would be a different one.\"  \"But would it be a new one?\"  \"If you wanted a new one they'd give you a new one. Now you hike it back to camp and tell Worry there are to be no leaves of absence to-night on account of camp-fire yarns, and to post a notice. Tell him to make duplicate prints of the chipmunk Eddie stalked and paste one in the Troop Book. I've got a call to make up toward the village.\"  Tom made him the full salute and started back. That night he dreamed that the \"Be Prepared\" scroll was pinned upon him and that he was a Silver Fox Scout of the Second Class, having passed with much distinction.  Mr. Ellsworth had designs on the Bennett bungalow and he blew into the porch like a refreshing breeze that sultry morning.  \"Hello, Connie, old boy,\" he called to the youth in the hammock. \"How's the state of your constitution?\"  \"I've got a little touch of rheumatism,\" said Connover.  \"Yes?\" said the scoutmaster. \"What right have _you_ got to have rheumatism? I thought John Temple had a controlling interest in all the rheumatism around here.\"  \"It gets me in the arm,\" said Connover.  \"So? That's too bad. May I lift these books off the chair, Connie?\"  \"Surely--sit down. Just push them on the floor.\"  \"Regular Carnegie Library, eh? What are they all about, Con?\"  Connover quite welcomed the interruption for Mr. Ellsworth's offhand cordiality was nothing less than contagious. He fell immediately and completely into the spirit of whatever was on the boards.  \"'Bout the Boy Scouts.\"  \"No--really?\" said Mr. Ellsworth, running through one of the volumes amusedly. \"Who's this fellow, Dan Dreadnought?\"  \"He's lieutenant of the Eureka Patrol.\"  \"So? I thought maybe he was a battleship from his name. And what does Dan do to pass the time?\"  \"This one I'm reading now,\" said Connover, \"is the _Eureka Patrol in the Fiji Islands; Dan stabs two natives._\"  \"Get out! Does he really?\"  \"And the captain of the squad--\"  \"What squad?\"  \"Of Boy Scouts-the captain is taken prisoner by the cannibals--\"  \"You don't say! How many of these books are there, Connie?\"  \"Twenty-seven--all one series.\"  \"Well, Dan's some boy, isn't he? How would you like to be a scout, Connie?\"  \"My mother wouldn't let me have a musket.\"  \"They all have muskets, do they?\"  At this point Mrs. Bennett appeared and greeted the scoutmaster cordially. She could never find it in her heart to dislike Mr. Ellsworth.  \"How'd do, Mrs. Bennett.\"  \"Good morning, Mr. Ellsworth,\" she said, and added smilingly, \"I hope you are not trying to contaminate Connover again.\"  \"Me? Oh, dear, no! A fellow who can witness the murder of two innocent South Sea natives isn't in much danger from me!\"  But Mrs. Bennett failed to see the point.  \"I tell Connover,\" said Mrs. Bennett, \"that if it must be'scouts' and 'wild west' it is better in the books than in real life.\"  \"Well, that's a matter of taste, Mrs. Bennett. You can have Dan What's-his-name up here, if you want to, but I wouldn't allow him near my camp. No siree!\"  \"Yet he's a scout boy,\" said Mrs. Bennett triumphantly.  \"From all I can see he's a silly blackguard. Why, Mrs. Bennett,\" added the scoutmaster pleasantly, \"you've hit the wrong trail--\"  \"I've what?\"  \"Hit the wrong trail. We don't have 'Eureka' Patrols or captains or lieutenants or squads or muskets. This book has got no more to do with real scouting than it has with a Sunday School picnic. I tell you what, Mrs. Bennett, I just came up out of the woods, and I tell you it's a shame that good trees should be cut down to get wood-pulp to make paper on which to print such stuff as this! It's a waste of good trees!\"  \"I have always done everything for Connover--\" began Mrs. Bennett.  \"Well, do one thing more for him and let him come and join the scouts-the real scouts. That's what I wanted to see you about. I'm going to work up a new patrol, the Elks. Like that name, Connie?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"And I want Connie in the Elks.\"  \"It's quite out of the question, Mr. Ellsworth. I am willing that he should read about them, but there it must end. We have always done everything for Connover. I have never stinted him in the matter of wholesome pleasure of any kind.\"  \"You don't call murder wholesome pleasure, do you?\"  \"Here he is under my eye. There is no use arguing the matter. I have no thought but of Connie's welfare and happiness, but I am not willing that he should dress up like Mrs. Blakeley's boy--a perfect _sight_--his clothes _redolent_ of smoke-and play with fire and sleep in a draught.\"  [Illustration: MRS. TEMPLE WAS TOO WEAK TO WALK AND THE BOYS IMPROVISED A LITTER FOR HER.]  \"There aren't any draughts outdoors, Mrs. Bennett.\"  \"There's the damp air. Oh, it's quite out of the question!\"  \"Don't you think those O'Connor boys would be better out here?\"  \"I think a boy is better in his home, where his mother is. I have done everything for Connover--everything, and he is ready to do this much for me. Aren't you, dearie?\"  As Mr. Ellsworth walked back to camp through the silent woods, he was puzzled at the reasoning of the fond mother who thought that _Dan Dreadnought_ was a better companion for her son than Roy Blakeley.

HISTORY OF KING CHARLES THE SECOND OF ENGLAND.  BY JACOB ABBOTT.     PREFACE.    The author of this series has made it his special object to confine himself very strictly, even in the most minute details which he records, to historic truth. The narratives are not tales founded upon history, but history itself, without any embellishment or any deviations from the strict truth, so far as it can now be discovered by an attentive examination of the annals written at the time when the events themselves occurred. In writing the narratives, the author has endeavored to avail himself of the best sources of information which this country affords; and though, of course, there must be in these volumes, as in all historical accounts, more or less of imperfection and error, there is no intentional embellishment. Nothing is stated, not even the most minute and apparently imaginary details, without what was deemed good historical authority. The readers, therefore, may rely upon the record as the truth, and nothing but the truth, so far as an honest purpose and a careful examination have been effectual in ascertaining it.

CONCLUSION     CHAPTER I.  INFANCY.    King Charles the Second was the son and successor of King Charles the First. These two are the only kings of the name of Charles that have appeared, thus far, in the line of English sovereigns. Nor is it very probable that there will soon be another. The reigns of both these monarchs were stained and tarnished with many vices and crimes, and darkened by national disasters of every kind, and the name is thus connected with so many painful associations in the minds of men, that it seems to have been dropped, by common consent, in all branches of the royal family.  The reign of Charles the First, as will be seen by the history of his life in this series, was characterized by a long and obstinate contest between the king and the people, which brought on, at last, a civil war, in which the king was defeated and taken prisoner, and in the end beheaded on a block, before one of his own palaces. During the last stages of this terrible contest, and before Charles way himself taken prisoner, he was, as it were, a fugitive and an outlaw in his own dominions. His wife and family were scattered in various foreign lands, his cities and castles were in the hands of his enemies, and his oldest son, the prince Charles, was the object of special hostility. The prince incurred, therefore, a great many dangers, and suffered many heavy calamities in his early years. He lived to see these calamities pass away, and, after they were gone, he enjoyed, so far as his own personal safety and welfare were concerned, a tranquil and prosperous life. The storm, however, of trial and suffering which enveloped the evening of his father's days, darkened the morning of his own. The life of Charles the First was a river rising gently, from quiet springs, in a scene of verdure and sunshine, and flowing gradually into rugged and gloomy regions, where at last it falls into a terrific abyss, enveloped in darkness and storms. That of Charles the Second, on the other hand, rising in the wild and rugged mountains where the parent stream was engulfed, commences its course by leaping frightfully from precipice to precipice, with turbid and foaming waters, but emerges at last into a smooth and smiling land, and flows through it prosperously to the sea.  Prince Charles's mother, the wife of Charles the First, was a French princess. Her name was Henrietta Maria. She was unaccomplished, beautiful, and very spirited woman. She was a Catholic, and the English people, who were very decided in their hostility to the Catholic faith, were extremely jealous of her. They watched all her movements with the utmost suspicion. They were very unwilling that an heir to the crown should arise in her family. The animosity which they felt against her husband the king, which was becoming every day more and more bitter, seemed to be doubly inveterate and intense toward her. They published pamphlets, in which they called her a daughter of Heth, a Canaanite, and an idolatress, and expressed hopes that from such a worse than pagan stock no progeny should ever spring.  Henrietta was at this time--1630--twenty-one years of age, and had been married about four years. She had had one son, who had died a few days after his birth. Of course, she did not lead a very happy life in England. Her husband the king, like the majority of the English people, was a Protestant, and the difference was a far more important circumstance in those days than it would be now; though even now a difference in religious faith, on points _which either party deems essential_, is, in married life, an obstacle to domestic happiness, which comes to no termination, and admits of no cure. If it were possible for reason and reflection to control the impetuous impulses of youthful hearts, such differences of religious faith would be regarded, where they exist, as an insurmountable objection to a matrimonial union.  The queen, made thus unhappy by religious dissensions with her husband, and by the public odium of which she was the object, lived in considerable retirement and seclusion at St. James's Palace, in Westminster, which is the western part of London. Here her second son, the subject of this history, was born, in May, 1630, which was ten years after the landing of the pilgrims on the Plymouth rock. The babe was very far from being pretty, though he grew up at last to be quite a handsome man. King Charles was very much pleased at the birth of his son. He rode into London the next morning at the head of a long train of guards and noble attendants, to the great cathedral church of St. Paul's, to render thanks publicly to God for the birth of his child and the safety of the queen. While this procession was going through the streets, all London being out to gaze upon it, the attention of the vast crowd was attracted to the appearance of a star glimmering faintly in the sky at midday. This is an occurrence not very uncommon, though it seldom, perhaps, occurs when it has so many observers to witness it. The star was doubtless Venus, which, in certain circumstances, is often bright enough to be seen when the sun is above the horizon. The populace of London, however, who were not in those days very profound astronomers, regarded the shining of the star as a supernatural occurrence altogether, and as portending the future greatness and glory of the prince whose natal day it thus unexpectedly adorned.  Preparations were made for the baptism of the young prince in July. The baptism of a prince is an important affair, and there was one circumstance which gave a peculiar interest to that of the infant Charles. The Reformation had not been long established in England, and this happened to be the first occasion on which an heir to the English crown had been baptized since the Liturgy of the English Church had been arranged. There is a chapel connected with the palace of St. James, as is usual with royal palaces in Europe, and even, in fact, with the private castles and mansions of the higher nobility. The baptism took place there. On such occasions it is usual for certain persons to appear as sponsors, as they are called, who undertake to answer for the safe and careful instruction of the child in the principles of the Christian faith. This is, of course, mainly a form, the real function of the sponsors being confined, as it would appear, to making magnificent presents to their young godchild, in acknowledgment of the distinguished honor conferred upon them by their designation to the office which they hold. The sponsors, on this occasion, were certain royal personages in France, the relatives of the queen. They could not appear personally, and so they appointed proxies from among the higher nobility of England, who appeared at the baptism in their stead, and made the presents to the child. One of these proxies was a duchess, whose gift was a jewel valued at a sum in English money equal to thirty thousand dollars.  The oldest son of a king of England receives the title of Prince of Wales; and there was an ancient custom of the realm, that an infant prince of Wales should be under the care, in his earliest years, of a Welsh nurse, so that the first words which he should learn to speak might be the vernacular language of his principality. Such a nurse was provided for Charles. Rockers for his cradle were appointed, and many other officers of his household, all the arrangements being made in a very magnificent and sumptuous manner. It is the custom in England to pay fees to the servants by which a lady or gentleman is attended, even when a guest in private dwellings; and some idea may be formed of the scale on which the pageantry of this occasion was conducted, from the fact that one of the lady sponsors who rode to the palace in the queen's carriage, which was sent for her on this occasion, paid a sum equal to fifty dollars each to six running footmen who attended the carriage, and a hundred dollars to the coachman; while a number of knights who came on horseback and in armor to attend upon the carriage, as it moved to the palace, received each a gratuity of two hundred and fifty dollars. The state dresses on the occasion of this baptism were very costly and splendid, being of white satin trimmed with crimson.  The little prince was thus an object of great attention at the very commencement of his days, His mother had his"]]]
