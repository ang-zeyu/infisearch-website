I shall go stark mad; I was nearly so just now.\"  \"Not so green!--you want to give us the slip!\" said Malicorne, \"want to bolt, old son!\"  \"Oh, God! God!\" cried Morel, with mournful indignation.  \"I don't think he intends to chouse us,\" said Bourdin, in a low tone to his companion; \"let us do as he wishes, or we'll never get away. I will wait outside the door, there is no other outlet from the garret-- he cannot escape us.\"  \"Very well; but he needn't be so particular about leaving the mucky crib!\" Then, addressing Morel in a low voice, he said: \"Now then, look sharp, and we will wait for you below. Make haste, and offer some pretense for our going.\"  \"I thank you,\" said Morel.  \"Very well, it shall be so,\" said Bourdin, in a loud voice, and looking significantly at the artisan; \"in such case, as you promise to pay in a short time, we will leave you for the present, and call again in four or five days; but then you must be punctual.\"  \"Yes, gentlemen, I trust I shall then be able to pay you.\"  The bailiffs left the room; while Hoppy, for fear of being seen, had disappeared down the staircase at the same time the bailiffs quitted the garret.  \"Madame Morel, do you hear?\" said Miss Dimpleton, trying to withdraw the attention of the mother from her melancholy abstraction; \"they will not take away your husband--the two men are gone.\"  \"Mother, don't you hear? they will not take father away,\" said the eldest of the boys.  \"Morel, listen to me,\" murmured Madeleine, in a state of delirium. \"Take one of the large diamonds and sell it--no one will know it, and we shall be saved. Our Adele will no longer feel cold; she will not be dead.\"  Taking advantage of a moment when none belonging to him were observing his actions, the lapidary cautiously left the room. The bailiff was waiting for him upon a sort of little landing, covered also by the roof. Upon this landing, opened the door of a loft, which had formerly been part of the garret occupied by the Morels, and in which Pipelet kept his stock of leather; and the worthy porter called this place his _box at the play_, because, by means of a hole made in the wall between two laths, he was sometimes a witness to the sad scenes that passed in the Morels' room. The bailiff noticed the door of the loft; in a moment he thought that most likely his prisoner had reckoned upon that outlet for escape, or to hide himself.  \"Come, march, old fellow!\" said he, beginning to descend the stair, and making a sign to the lapidary to follow.  \"One minute more, I beseech!\" said Morel; and he fell on his knees upon the floor. Through a chink in the door, he threw a last look upon his family, and clasping his hands, he uttered, in a low, heart-rending voice, while tears flowed down his haggard cheeks: \"Farewell, my dear children--my poor wife! may heaven preserve you all! Farewell!\"  \"Make haste and cut that sermon,\" said Bourdin, brutally, \"Malicorne is quite right; you needn't make so much fuss about leaving the stinking kennel. What a hole! what a hole!\"  Morel rose to follow the bailiff, when the words \"Father! father!\" sounded on the staircase.  \"Louise!\" exclaimed the lapidary, raising his hands toward heaven; \"I can then clasp you to my breast before I go!\"  \"I thank thee, God, I am in time!\" said the voice, approaching nearer and nearer, and light steps were heard rapidly ascending the stairs.  \"Be calm, my dear,\" said a third voice, sharp, asthmatic, and out of breath, coming from a lower part of the house;  \"I will lay in wait, if I must, in the alley, with my broom and my old darling, and they sha'n't leave here till you have spoken to them, the contemptible beggars!\"  The reader has doubtless recognized Mrs. Pipelet, who, less nimble than Louise, followed her slowly. An instant after, the lapidary's daughter was in her father's arms.  \"It is indeed you, Louise, my darling Louise!\" said Morel, crying; \"but how pale you are! For mercy's sake what ails you?\"  \"Nothing, nothing, father,\" stammered Louise. \"I have run so fast. Here is the money!\"  \"How is this?\"  \"You are free!\"  \"So you know?\"  \"Yes, yes! Here, sir, take the money,\" said the young girl, giving a rouleau of gold to Malicorne.  \"But this money, Louise--this money?\"  \"You shall know all presently; don't be uneasy. Come and comfort dear mother.\"  \"No, not now!\" exclaimed Morel, placing himself before the door, remembering that Louise was still in ignorance of the death of the little girl; \"wait, I must speak to you. Now, about this money?\"  \"Stay!\" said Malicorne, as he finished counting the gold, and while putting it in his pocket; \"sixty-four, sixty-five--that will just make thirteen hundred francs. Have you no more than that, my little dear?\"  \"Why, you only owe thirteen hundred francs?\" said Louise, addressing her father, with a stupefied air.  \"Yes,\" said the lapidary.  \"Stop!\" rejoined the catchpole; \"the bill is for thirteen hundred francs. Well, the bill is paid; but the expenses? Without the execution, they are already eleven hundred and forty francs.\" [Footnote: We append some curious facts about imprisonment for debt, taken from \"_Le Pauvre Jacques_,\" a paper published by the Society of Christian Morality Prison Committee:--  \"A protest and a warrant is legally set down as at 4 francs 35 centimes for the first, and 4 francs 70 centimes for the other, but is generally increased by the warrant-officers to 10fr. 40c., and 16fr. 40c. respectively. Thus 26fr. 80c. illegally obtained for what should have been but 9fr. 50c. The law sets down bailiff fees thus:--Stamp and registry, 3fr. 50c.; hackney-coach, 5fr.; arresting and imprisonment, 60fr. 25c.; turnkey's fee, 8fr. Total 76fr. 75c. One bill of charges taken as the average of those sent in by sheriffs' officers, swells the above to 240 francs!\"  In the same paper is this paragraph:--  \"M---, bailiff, has written to desire correction of the article on the Hanged Woman. He did not kill her, he says. We did not say that he did _kill_ that unfortunate woman. We reprint that article:--  \"M---, bailiff, having writ out for a cabinet-maker in the Rue de la Lune, was seen by the latter from the house windows. He called out to his wife.--'I am lost, for there they come to arrest me!' His wife heard this, and fastened the door, while her husband hid him self in the loft. The bailiff called in a locksmith. The wife's room door was forced, and they found the woman had hanged herself! The sight of the corpse did not delay or prevent the officer hunting for the husband. 'I arrest you.' 'I have no money.' 'To prison, then.' 'Very well, let me give my wife good-bye.' 'That be hanged, like she is herself. She's dead.' What can you complain of, M---? we only print your own words, which minutely and blackly paint this frightful picture.\"  This same paper quotes three or four hundred facts, of which the following is a fair sample:--  \"On collection of a 300 franc debt a warrant-officer charged 964 francs! The debtor, a workman with five children, lay seven months in prison.\"  For two reasons, the present writer quotes from \"_Le Pauvre Jacques_,\" firstly, to show that the chapter just read falls below reality; and again, to prove that, if merely in a philanthropic point of view, the maintenance of such a state of things (the exorbitance of extras, illegally extorted by public servants,) often paralyzes the most generous intentions. For instance, with 1,000 francs there might be three or four honest though unfortunate workmen restored to their families from a prison whither petty debts of 250 or 500 francs had driven them; but these sums being tripled by a shameful exaggeration of costs, the most charitable persons often recoil from doing a good deed at the thought of two-thirds of their bounty merely going to sheriffs and their officers. And yet, there are few hardships more worthy of relief than those befalling such unfortunate people as we speak of.]  \"Gracious heaven!\" cried Louise; \"I thought it was only thirteen hundred francs in all! But, sir, we will very soon pay you the remainder; this is a pretty good sum on account--is it not, father?\"  \"Soon!--very well; bring the money to the office, and we will then let your father go. Come, let's be off.\"  \"You will take him away?\"  \"At once. This is on account. When the rest is paid, he will be free. Go on, Bourdin; let us get out of this.\"  \"Mercy! mercy!\" shrieked Louise.  \"Oh, what a row! here it is--the old game over again: it is enough to make one sweat in the depth of winter--on my honor!\" said the bailiff, in a brutal tone. Then advancing toward Morel, he continued: \"If you don't come along at once, I will take you by the collar, and bundle you down. This wind-up is beastly!\"  \"Oh, poor father! when I had hoped to save you!\" said Louise, overwhelmed.  \"No, no! hope nothing for me! Heaven is not just!\" cried the lapidary, in a voice of deep despair, and stamping his feet with rage.  \"Peace! heaven is just! There is Providence for honest men!\" said a soft, yet manly voice.  The same instant Rudolph appeared at the door of the little recess, from whence he had, unseen, witnessed the greater part of the scenes we have just related. He was very pale, and deeply moved. At this sudden interposition, the bailiffs drew back with surprise; while Morel and his daughter stared at the prince vacantly. Taking from his pocket a small parcel of folded bank notes, Rudolph selected three, and giving them to Malicorne, said to him: \"Here are two thousand five hundred francs; give back to this girl the money you have just received from her.\"  More and more surprised, the bailiff took the notes hesitatingly, examined them very suspiciously, turning them over and over, and finally pocketed them. But as his alarm and surprise began to subside, so did his natural coarseness return, and eying Rudolph from head to foot with an impertinent stare, he exclaimed, \"Your notes are good;"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6602"],["title","Mysteries of Paris — Volume 02 (#3)"],["body","how came the likes of you with so large a sum? I hope, at least, it is your own!\" added he.  Rudolph was very humbly dressed, and covered with dust--thanks to his stay in Pipelet's loft.  \"I have bidden you restore that gold to the young girl,\" answered Rudolph, in a sharp, stern voice.  \"Bid me! Who gives you the right to order me?\" cried the bailiff, advancing toward Rudolph, in a threatening manner.  \"The gold! the gold!\" said the prince, seizing the fellow's wrist so violently that he winced under the iron hold, and cried out,  \"Oh, you hurt me! Hands off!\"  \"Restore the gold! you are paid. Take yourself off, without further insolence, or I will kick you to the foot of the stairs.\"  \"Very well; here is the gold,\" said Malicorne, giving it to the girl; \"but mind what you are about, young man--don't fancy you are going to do as you like with me, because you happen to be the strongest.\"  \"That's right. Who are you, to give yourself such airs?\" said Bourdin, sheltering himself behind his companion. \"Who are you?\"  \"Who is he? He is my tenant, the king of tenants, you foul-mouthed wretches!\" cried Mrs. Pipelet, who appeared at last, quite out of breath, still wearing the Brutus wig. In her hand she held an earthen pot filled with boiling soup, which she was kindly taking to the Morels.  \"What does this old polecat want?\" said Bourdin.  \"If you dare to pass any of your blackguard remarks upon me, I'll make you feel my nails--and my teeth too, if necessary!\" screamed Mrs. Pipelet: \"and more than that, my lodger, my prince of lodgers, will pitch you from the top to the bottom of the staircase, as he says! And I will sweep you away like a heap of rubbish, as you are!\"  \"This old woman will rouse all the people in the house against us. We are paid, and our expenses also; let us be off!\" said Bourdin to Malicorne.  \"Here are your documents,\" said the last-named individual, throwing a bundle of papers at Morel's feet.  \"Pick them up, and deliver them properly! You are paid for being civil,\" said Rudolph, seizing the bailiff with his vigorous hand, while the other he pointed to the papers.  Convinced by this new and formidable grasp that he could not struggle against so powerful an adversary, the bailiff stooped down grumbling, picked up the bundle of papers, and gave them to Morel, who took them mechanically. The lapidary believed himself under the influence of a dream.  \"Mind, young fellow, although you have an arm as strong as a porter's, never come under our lash!\" said Malicorne. Shaking his fist at Rudolph, he nimbly jumped down the stairs, followed by his companion, who looked behind him with fear.  Mrs. Pipelet, burning for revenge on the bailiffs, for the insults offered to Rudolph, looked at her saucepan with an air of inspiration, and cried out, heroically: \"Morel's debts are paid; they will now have plenty to eat, and no longer stand in need of my soup--heads!\" Leaning over the banisters, the old woman emptied the contents of her saucepan on the backs of the bailiffs, who had just arrived at the first-floor landing.  \"Oh, you are caught, I see!\" added the portress. \"They are soaked through like two sops! He! he! this is capital!\"  \"A thousand million thunders!\" cried Malicorne, wet through with Mrs. Pipelet's culinary preparation. \"Will you take care what you are about up there, you old baggage!\"  \"Alfred!\" retorted Mrs. Pipelet, bawling in a voice sharp enough to split the tympanum of a deaf man. \"Alfred! have at 'em, old darling! They wanted to behave improperly to thy 'Stasie! (Anastasia). Those rascals would take liberties with me! Pitch into them with your broom! call the oyster-woman and the potboy next door to help you. Quick!-- quick!--after them! Murder! police! thieves! Hish!--hish!--hish! bravo! Halloo! go it, old darling! Broom!--broom!\" By way of a formidable finish to these hootings, which she had accompanied with a violent stamping of her feet, Mrs. Pipelet, carried away by the intoxication of her victory, hurled from the top to the bottom of the staircase her earthenware saucepan, which, breaking with a loud, crashing noise, the very moment the bailiffs, stunned by the frightful cries, were taking the stairs four at a time, added greatly to their fears.  \"Ha! ha! I rayther think you have got enough for once!\" cried Anastasia laughing loudly, and folding her arms in an attitude of triumph.  While Mrs. Pipelet was thus venting her rage upon the bailiffs, Morel, overcome with gratitude, had thrown himself at Rudolph's feet.  \"Ah, sir, you have saved our lives! To whom do we owe this unlooked-for succor?\"  \"'_To HIM who watches over and protects honest men_,' as our immortal Beranger says.\"     CHAPTER XXXIX.  MISS DIMPLETON.   Louise, the lapidary's daughter, was possessed of remarkable loveliness; tall and graceful, she resembled the classic Juno for regularity of features, and the huntress Diana for the finish of her tall figure. In spite of her sunburned complexion, her rough and freckled hands, beautifully formed, but hardened by domestic labor; in spite of her humble garments, this girl possessed a nobility of exterior.  We will not attempt to describe the gratitude and surprise of this family, so abruptly snatched from a fearful fate; in the first burst of happiness, even the death of the little girl was forgotten. Rudolph alone remarked the extreme paleness of Louise, and the utter abstraction with which she seemed oppressed, in spite of her father's deliverance. Wishing to completely satisfy the Morels as to apprehensions about the future, and to explain a liberality which might otherwise betray suspicions as to the character he thought proper to assume, Rudolph said to the lapidary, whom he took to the landing (while Miss Dimpleton broke to Louise the news of her sister's death):  \"Yesterday morning a young lady came to see you.\"  \"Yes, sir, and appeared much distressed at the situation in which she found us.\"  \"It is to her you must return thanks, and not to me.\"  \"Is it indeed true, sir? That young lady--\"  \"Is your benefactress. I have often waited upon her with goods from our warehouse. The day before yesterday, while I was here engaging an apartment on the fourth story, I learned from the portress your cruel position. Knowing this lady's charity, I went to her. She came, so that she might herself judge of the extent of your misfortunes, with which she was painfully moved; but as your situation might be the result of misconduct, she begged of me as soon as possible, to make some inquiries respecting you, as she was desirous of apportioning her benefits according to your deserts.\"  \"Good and excellent lady! I had reason to say--\"  \"As you observed to Madeleine: 'If the rich knew,' is it not so?\"  \"How, sir!--you know the name of my wife! Who told you that?\"  \"Since six o' clock this morning,\" said Rudolph, interrupting Morel, \"I have been concealed in the little loft which adjoins your garret.\"  \"You, sir!\"  \"Yes, and I have heard all that passed, my honest man.\"  \"Oh, sir! but why were you there?\"  \"I could employ no better means of getting at your real character and sentiments. I wished to see and hear all, without your knowledge. The porter had spoken to me of this little nook, and offered it to me that I might keep my wood in it. This morning I requested him to permit me to visit it; I remained there an hour, and I feel convinced that there does not exist a character more worthy, noble, and courageously resigned than yours.\"  \"Nay, sir, indeed I cannot see much merit in my conduct; I was born honest, and cannot act otherwise than I have done.\"  \"I know it; and for that reason I do not praise your conduct but appreciate it. I had quitted the loft to release you from the bailiffs when I heard your daughter's voice. I wished to leave her the pleasure of saving you; unhappily the rapacity of the bailiffs prevented poor Louise from enjoying so sweet a delight. I then made my appearance. Fortunately, I yesterday recovered several sums of money that were due to me, and I was able to give an advance to your benefactress by paying for you this unfortunate debt. But your misfortunes are so great, so unmerited, so nobly sustained, that the interest felt for you and deserved, will not stop here. I can, in the name of your preserving angel, assure you of future repose with happiness to you and yours.\"  \"Is it possible? But at least tell me her name, sir--the name of this preserving angel, as you have called her.\"  \"Yes, she is an angel; and you have still reason to say that the great and the lowly have their troubles.\"  \"Is this lady, then, unhappy?\"  \"Who is there without their sorrows? But I see no cause to withhold her name. This lady is called--\"  Remembering that Mrs. Pipelet knew that Lady d'Harville had come to her house to inquire for the Commander, Rudolph, hearing the indiscreet gossiping of the portress, said after a moment's reflection: \"I will tell you the name of this lady on one condition--\"  \"Oh, pray, speak, sir!\"  \"It is, that you will repeat it to no one. You understand!--to no one.\"  \"Oh, I will solemnly promise that to you. But cannot I at least offer my thanks to this savior of the unhappy?\"  \"I will ask Lady d'Harville, and I doubt not she will give her consent.\"  \"Then this lady is--\"  \"The Marchioness d'Harville.\"  \"Oh, I shall never forget that name! It shall be my saint, my adoration! To think that, thanks to her, my wife and children are saved! saved!--no, not all, not all, my poor little Adele, we shall never see her again. Alas! but it is necessary to remember that any day we might have lost her, for she was doomed.\" Here the poor lapidary brushed the tears from his eyes.  \"As regards the last sad duties to be performed for this little one,\" said Rudolph, \"trust to my advice; this is what must be done: I do not yet occupy my room, which is large, wholesome, and well aired. There is already a bed in it; we will convey thither all that is necessary for"]]]
