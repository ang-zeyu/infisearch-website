What prospect does he hold out? when are you to be up? does he think you will be on the top next year--by the Great Mysteries, or the Panathenaea, say?  _Her_. Too soon, Lycinus.  _Ly_. By next Olympiad, then?  _Her_. All too short a time, even that, for habituation to Virtue and attainment of Happiness.  _Ly_. Say two Olympiads, then, for an outside estimate. You may fairly be found guilty of laziness, if you cannot get it done by then; the time would allow you three return trips from the Pillars of Heracles to India, with a margin for exploring the tribes on the way instead of sailing straight and never stopping. How much higher and more slippery, pray, is the peak on which your Virtue dwells than that Aornos crag which Alexander stormed in a few days?  _Her_. There is no resemblance, Lycinus; this is not a thing, as you conceive it, to be compassed and captured quickly, though ten thousand Alexanders were to assault it; in that case, the sealers would have been legion. As it is, a good number begin the climb with great confidence, and do make progress, some very little indeed, others more; but when they get half-way, they find endless difficulties and discomforts, lose heart, and turn back, panting, dripping, and exhausted. But those who endure to the end reach the top, to be blessed thenceforth with wondrous days, looking down from their height upon the ants which are the rest of mankind.  _Ly_. Dear me, what tiny things you make us out--not so big as the Pygmies even, but positively grovelling on the face of the earth. I quite understand it; your thoughts are up aloft already. And we, the common men that walk the earth, shall mingle you with the Gods in our prayers; for you are translated above the clouds, and gone up whither you have so long striven.  _Her_. If but that ascent might be, Lycinus! but it is far yet.  _Ly_. But you have never told me _how_ far, in terms of time.  _Her_. No; for I know not precisely myself. My guess is that it will not be more than twenty years; by that time I shall surely be on the summit.  _Ly_. Mercy upon us, you take long views!  _Her_. Ay; but, as the toil, so is the reward.  _Ly_. That may be; but about these twenty years--have you your master's promise that you will live so long? is he prophet as well as philosopher? or is it a soothsayer or Chaldean expert that you trust? such things are known to them, I understand. You would never, of course, if there were any uncertainty of your life's lasting to the Virtue-point, slave and toil night and day like this; why, just as you were close to the top, your fate might come upon you, lay hold of you by the heel, and lug you down with your hopes unfulfilled.  _Her_. God forbid! these are words of ill omen, Lycinus; may life be granted me, that I may grow wise, and have if it be but one day of Happiness!  _Ly_. For all these toils will you be content with your one day?  _Her_. Content? yes, or with the briefest moment of it.  _Ly_. But is there indeed Happiness up there--and worth all the pains? How can you tell? You have never been up yourself.  _Her_. I trust my master's word; and he knows well; is he not on the topmost height?  _Ly_. Oh, do tell me what he says about it; what is Happiness like? wealth, glory, pleasures incomparable?  _Her_. Hush, friend! all these have nought to do with the Virtuous life.  _Ly_. Well, if these will not do, what _are_ the good things he offers to those who carry their course right through?  _Her_. Wisdom, courage, true beauty, justice, full and firm knowledge of all things as they are; but wealth and glory and pleasure and all bodily things--these a man strips off and abandons before he mounts up, like Heracles burning on Mount Oeta before deification; he too cast off whatever of the human he had from his mother, and soared up to the Gods with his divine part pure and unalloyed, sifted by the fire. Even so those I speak of are purged by the philosophic fire of all that deluded men count admirable, and reaching the summit have Happiness with never a thought of wealth and glory and pleasure--except to smile at any who count them more than phantoms.  _Ly_. By Heracles (and his death on Oeta), they quit themselves like men, and have their reward, it seems. But there is one thing I should like to know: are they allowed to come down from their elevation sometimes, and have a taste of what they left behind them? or when they have once got up, must they stay there, conversing with Virtue, and smiling at wealth and glory and pleasure?  _Her_. The latter, assuredly; more than that, a man once admitted of Virtue's company will never be subject to wrath or fear or desire any more; no, nor can he feel pain, nor any such sensation.  _Ly_. Well, but--if one might dare to say what one thinks--but no--let me keep a good tongue in my head--it were irreverent to pry into what wise men do.  _Her_. Nay, nay; let me know your meaning.  _Ly_. Dear friend, I have not the courage.  _Her_. Out with it, my good fellow; we are alone.  _Ly_. Well, then--most of your account I followed and accepted--how they grow wise and brave and just, and the rest--indeed I was quite fascinated by it; but then you went on to say they despised wealth and glory and pleasure; well, just there (quite between ourselves, you know) I was pulled up; I thought of a scene t'other day with--shall I tell you whom? Perhaps we can do without a name?  _Her_. No, no; we must have that too.  _Ly_. Your own professor himself, then,--a person to whom all respect is due, surely, not to mention his years.  _Her_. Well?  _Ly_. You know the Heracleot, quite an old pupil of his in philosophy by this time--red-haired--likes an argument?  _Her_. Yes; Dion, he is called.  _Ly_. Well, I suppose he had not paid up punctually; anyhow the other day the old man haled him before the magistrate, with a halter made of his own coat; he was shouting and fuming, and if some friends had not come up and got the young man out of his hands, he would have bitten off his nose, he was in such a temper.  _Her_. Ah, _he_ is a bad character, always an unconscionable time paying his debts. There are plenty of others who owe the professor money, and he has never treated any of them so; they pay him his interest punctually.  _Ly_. Not so fast; what in the world does it matter to him, if they do not pay up? he is purified by philosophy, and has no further need of the cast clothes of Oeta.  _Her_. Do you suppose his interest in such things is selfish? no, but he has little ones; his care is to save them from indigence.  _Ly_. Whereas he ought to have brought them up to Virtue too, and let them share his inexpensive Happiness.  _Her_. Well, I have no time to argue it, Lycinus; I must not be late for lecture, lest in the end I find myself left behind.  _Ly_. Don't be afraid, my duteous one; to-day is a holiday; I can save you the rest of your walk.  _Her_. What do you mean?  _Ly_. You will not find him just now, if the notice is to be trusted; there was a tablet over the door announcing in large print, No meeting this day. I hear he dined yesterday with the great Eucrates, who was keeping his daughter's birthday. He talked a good deal of philosophy over the wine, and lost his temper a little with Euthydemus the Peripatetic; they were debating the old Peripatetic objections to the Porch. His long vocal exertions (for it was midnight before they broke up) gave him a bad headache, with violent perspiration. I fancy he had also drunk a little too much, toasts being the order of the day, and eaten more than an old man should. When he got home, he was very ill, they said, just managed to check and lock up carefully the slices of meat which he had conveyed to his servant at table, and then, giving orders that he was not at home, went to sleep, and has not waked since. I overheard Midas his man telling this to some of his pupils; there were a number of them coming away.  _Her_. Which had the victory, though, he or Euthydemus--if Midas said anything about that?  _Ly_. Why, at first, I gathered, it was very even between them; but you Stoics had it in the end, and your master was much too hard for him. Euthydemus did not even get off whole; he had a great cut on his head. He was pretentious, insisted on proving his point, would not give in, and proved a hard nut to crack; so your excellent professor, who had a goblet as big as Nestor's in his hand, brought this down on him as he lay within easy reach, and the victory was his.  _Her_. Good; so perish all who will not yield to their betters!  _Ly_. Very reasonable, Hermotimus; what was Euthydemus thinking of, to irritate an old man who is purged of wrath and master of his passions, when he had such a heavy goblet in his hand?  But we have time to spare--you might tell a friend like me the story of your start in philosophy; then I might perhaps, if it is not too late, begin now and join your school; you are my friends; you will not be exclusive?  _Her_. If only you would, Lycinus! you will soon find out how much you are superior to the rest of men. I do assure you, you will think them all children, you will be so much wiser.  _Ly_. Enough for me, if after twenty years of it I am where you are now.  _Her_. Oh, I was about your age when I started on philosophy; I was forty; and you must be about that.  _Ly_. Just that; so take and lead me on the same way; that is but right. And first tell me--do you allow learners to criticize, if they find difficulties in your doctrines, or must juniors abstain from that?  _Her_. Why, yes, they must; but _you_ shall have leave to ask questions and criticize; you will learn easier that way.  _Ly_. I thank you for it, Hermotimus, by your name-God Hermes.  Now, is there only one road to philosophy--the Stoic way? they tell me there are a great many other philosophers; is that so?  _Her_. Certainly--Peripatetics, Epicureans, Platonists,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/659"],["title","Paul the Peddler; Or, The Fortunes of a Young Street Merchant (#0)"],["body","THE PEDDLER,  OR THE FORTUNES OF A YOUNG STREET MERCHANT   By Horatio Alger, Jr.     BIOGRAPHY AND BIBLIOGRAPHY  Horatio Alger, Jr., an author who lived among and for boys and himself remained a boy in heart and association till death, was born at Revere, Mass., January 13, 1834. He was the son of a clergyman, was graduated at Harvard College in 1852, and at its Divinity School in 1860 and was pastor of the Unitarian Church at Brewster, Mass., in 1862-66.  In the latter year he settled in New York and began drawing public attention to the condition and needs of street boys. He mingled with them, gained their confidence showed a personal concern in their affairs, and stimulated them to honest and useful living. With his first story he won the hearts of all red-blooded boys everywhere, and of the seventy or more that followed over a million copies were sold during the author's lifetime.  In his later life he was in appearance a short, stout, bald-headed man, with cordial manners and whimsical views of things that amused all who met him. He died at Natick, Mass., July 18, 1899.  Mr. Alger's stories are as popular now as when first published, because they treat of real live boys who were always up and about--just like the boys found everywhere to-day. They are pure in tone and inspiring in influence, and many reforms in the juvenile life of New York may be traced to them. Among the best known are:  Strong and Steady; Strive and Succeed; Try and Trust; Bound to Rise; Risen from the Ranks; Herbert Carter's Legacy; Brave and Bold; Jack's Ward; Shifting for Himself; Wait and Hope; Paul the Peddler; Phil the Fiddler; Slow and Sure; Julius the Street Boy; Tom the Bootblack; Struggling Upward, Facing the World; The Cash Boy; Making His Way; Tony the Tramp; Joe's Luck; Do and Dare; Only an Irish Boy; Sink or Swim; A Cousin's Conspiracy; Andy Gordon; Bob Burton; Harry Vane; Hector's Inheritance; Mark Mason's Triumph; Sam's Chance; The Telegraph Boy; The Young Adventurer; The Young Outlaw; The Young Salesman, and Luke Walton.      PAUL THE PEDDLER    CHAPTER I  PAUL THE PEDDLER  “Here's your prize packages! Only five cents! Money prize in every package! Walk up, gentlemen, and try your luck!”  The speaker, a boy of fourteen, stood in front of the shabby brick building, on Nassau street, which has served for many years as the New York post office. In front of him, as he stood with his back to the building, was a small basket, filled with ordinary letter envelopes, each labeled “Prize Package.”  His attractive announcement, which, at that time, had also the merit of novelty--for Paul had himself hit upon the idea, and manufactured the packages, as we shall hereafter explain--drew around him a miscellaneous crowd, composed chiefly of boys.  “What's in the packages, Johnny?” asked a bootblack, with his box strapped to his back.  “Candy,” answered Paul. “Buy one. Only five cents.”  “There ain't much candy,” answered the bootblack, with a disparaging glance.  “What if there isn't? There's a prize.”  “How big a prize?”  “There's a ten-cent stamp in some of 'em. All have got something in 'em.”  Influenced by this representation, the bootblack drew out a five-cent piece, and said:  “Pitch one over then. I guess I can stand it.” An envelope was at once handed him.  “Open it, Johnny,” said a newsboy at his side. Twenty curious eyes were fixed upon him as he opened the package. He drew out rather a scanty supply of candy, and then turning to Paul, with a look of indignation, said:  “Where's the prize? I don't see no prize. Give me back my five cents.”  “Give it to me. I'll show you,” said the young merchant.  He thrust in his finger, and drew out a square bit of paper, on which was written--One Cent.  “There's your prize,” he added, drawing a penny from his pocket.  “It ain't much of a prize,” said the buyer. “Where's your ten cents?”  “I didn't say I put ten cents into every package,” answered Paul.  “I'd burst up pretty quick if I did that. Who'll have another package? Only five cents!”  Curiosity and taste for speculation are as prevalent among children as with men, so this appeal produced its effect.  “Give me a package,” said Teddy O'Brien, a newsboy, stretching out a dirty hand, containing the stipulated sum. He also was watched curiously as he opened the package. He drew out a paper bearing the words--Two Cents.  “Bully for you, Teddy! You've had better luck than I,” said the bootblack.  The check was duly honored, and Teddy seemed satisfied, though the amount of candy he received probably could not have cost over half-a-cent. Still, he had drawn twice as large a prize as the first buyer, and that was satisfactory.  “Who'll take the next?” asked Paul, in a businesslike manner. “Maybe there's ten cents in this package. That's where you double your money. Walk up, gentlemen. Only five cents!”  Three more responded to this invitation, one drawing a prize of two cents, the other two of one cent each. Just then, as it seemed doubtful whether any more would be purchased by those present, a young man, employed in a Wall street house, came out of the post office.  “What have you got here?” he asked, pausing.  “Prize packages of candy! Money prize in every package! Only five cents!”  “Give me one, then. I never drew a prize in my life.”  The exchange was speedily made.  “I don't see any prize,” he said, opening it.  “It's on a bit of paper, mister,” said Teddy, nearly as much interested as if it had been his own purchase.  “Oh, yes, I see. Well, I'm in luck. Ten cents!”  “Ten cents!” exclaimed several of the less fortunate buyers, with a shade of envy.  “Here's your prize, mister,” said Paul, drawing out a ten-cent stamp from his vest pocket.  “Well, Johnny, you do things on the square, that's a fact. Just keep the ten cents, and give me two more packages.”  This Paul did with alacrity; but the Wall street clerk's luck was at an end. He got two prizes of a penny each.  “Well,” he said, “I'm not much out of pocket. I've bought three packages, and it's only cost me three cents.”  The ten-cent prize produced a favorable effect on the business of the young peddler. Five more packages were bought, and the contents eagerly inspected; but no other large prize appeared. Two cents was the maximum prize drawn. Their curiosity being satisfied, the crowd dispersed; but it was not long before another gathered. In fact, Paul had shown excellent judgment in selecting the front of the post office as his place of business. Hundreds passed in and out every hour, besides those who passed by on a different destination. Thus many ears caught the young peddler's cry--“Prize packages! Only five cents apiece!”--and made a purchase; most from curiosity, but some few attracted by the businesslike bearing of the young merchant, and willing to encourage him in his efforts to make a living. These last, as well as some of the former class, declined to accept the prizes, so that these were so much gain to Paul.  At length but one package remained, and this Paul was some time getting rid of. At last a gentleman came up, holding a little boy of seven by the hand.  “Oh, buy me the package, papa?” he said, drawing his father's attention.  “What is there in it, boy?” asked the gentleman.  “Candy,” was the answer.  Alfred, for this was the little boy's name, renewed his entreaties, having, like most boys, a taste for candy.  “There it is, Alfred,” said his father, handing the package to his little son.  “There's a prize inside,” said Paul, seeing that they were about to pass.  “We must look for the prize by all means,” said the gentleman. “What is this? One cent?”  “Yes sir”; and Paul held out a cent to his customer.  “Never mind about that! You may keep the prize.”  “I want it, pa,” interposed Alfred, with his mouth full of candy.  “I'll give you another,” said his father, still declining to accept the proffered prize.  Paul now found himself in the enviable position of one who, at eleven o'clock, had succeeded in disposing of his entire stock in trade, and that at an excellent profit, as we soon shall see. Business had been more brisk with him than with many merchants on a larger scale, who sometimes keep open their shops all day without taking in enough to pay expenses. But, then, it is to be considered that in Paul's case expenses were not a formidable item. He had no rent to pay, for one thing, nor clerk hire, being competent to attend to his entire business single-handed. All his expense, in fact, was the first cost of his stock in trade, and he had so fixed his prices as to insure a good profit on that. So, on the whole, Paul felt very well satisfied at the result of his experiment, for this was his first day in the prize-package business.  “I guess I'll go home,” he said to himself. “Mother'll want to know how I made out.” He turned up Nassau street, and had reached the corner of Maiden lane, when Teddy O'Brien met him.  “Did you sell out, Johnny?” he asked.  “Yes,” answered Paul.  “How many packages did you have?”  “Fifty.”  “That's bully. How much you made?”  “I can't tell yet. I haven't counted up,” said Paul.  “It's better'n sellin' papers, I'll bet. I've only made thirty cents the day. Don't you want to take a partner, Johnny?”  “No, I don't think I do,” said Paul, who had good reason to doubt whether such a step would be to his advantage.  “Then I'll go in for myself,” said Teddy, somewhat displeased at the refusal.  “Go ahead! There's nobody to stop you,” said Paul.  “I'd rather go in with you,” said Teddy, feeling that there would be some trouble in making the prize packages, but influenced still more by the knowledge that he had not capital enough to start in the business alone.  “No,” said Paul, positively; “I don't want any partner. I can do well enough alone.”  He was not surprised at Teddy's application. Street boys are as enterprising, and have as sharp eyes for business as their elders, and no one among them can monopolize a profitable business "]]]
