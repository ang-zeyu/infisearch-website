King Arthur, who held sway in Camelot with his Knights of the Round Table, was supposedly a king of Britain hundreds of years ago. Most of the stories about him are probably not historically true, but there was perhaps a real king named Arthur, or with a name very much like Arthur, who ruled somewhere in the island of Britain about the sixth century.  Among the romantic spires and towers of Camelot, King Arthur held court with his queen, Guinevere. According to tradition, he received mortal wounds in battling with the invading Saxons, and was carried magically to fairyland to be brought back to health and life. Excalibur was the name of King Arthur's sword--in fact, it was the name of two of his swords. One of these tremendous weapons Arthur pulled from the stone in which it was imbedded, after all other knights had failed. This showed that Arthur was the proper king. The other Excalibur was given to Arthur by the Lady of the Lake--she reached her hand above the water, as told in the story, and gave the sword to the king. When Arthur was dying, he sent one of his Knights of the Round Table, Sir Bedivere, to throw the sword back into the lake from which he had received it.  The Knights of the Round Table were so called because they customarily sat about a huge marble table, circular in shape. Some say that thirteen knights could sit around that table; others say that as many as a hundred and fifty could find places there. There sat Sir Galahad, who would one day see the Holy Grail. Sir Gawain was there, nephew of King Arthur. Sir Percivale, too, was to see the Holy Grail. Sir Lancelot--Lancelot of the Lake, who was raised by that same Lady of the Lake who gave Arthur his sword--was the most famous of the Knights of the Round Table. He loved Queen Guinevere.  All the knights were sworn to uphold the laws of chivalry--to go to the aid of anyone in distress, to protect women and children, to fight honorably, to be pious and loyal to their king.     CHAPTER ONE  Allan Finds A Champion   \"I cannot carry your message, Sir Knight.\"  Quiet-spoken was the lad, though his heart held a moment's fear as, scowling and menacing, the knight who sat so easily the large horse, flamed fury at his refusal.  \"And why can you not? It is no idle play, boy, to flaunt Sir Pellimore. Brave knights have found the truth of this at bitter cost.\"  \"Nevertheless, Sir Knight, you must needs find another message bearer. I am page to Sir Percival and he would deem it no service to him should I bear a strange knights message.\"  \"Then, by my faith, you shall learn your lesson. Since you are but a youth it would prove but poor sport to thrust my sword through your worthless body. Yet shall I find Sir Percival and make him pay for the boorishness of his page. In the meantime, take you this.\"  With a sweep the speaker brought the flat side of his sword down. But, if perchance, he thought that the boy would await the blow he found surprise for that worthy skillfully evaded the weapon's downward thrust.  Now then was Sir Pellimore doubly wroth.  \"Od's zounds, and you need a trouncing. And so shall I give it you, else my dignity would not hold its place.\" Suiting action to word the knight reared his horse, prepared to bring the boy to earth.  It might hare gone ill with Allan but for the appearance at the turn of the road of another figure--also on horseback. The new knight perceiving trouble, rode forward.  \"What do we see here?\" he questioned. \"Sir Knight, whose name I do not know, it seems to me that you are in poor business to quarrel with so youthful a foe. What say you?\"  \"As to with whom I quarrel is no concern of anyone but myself. I can, however, to suit the purpose, change my foe. Such trouncing as I wish to give this lad I can easily give to you, Sir Knight, and you wish it?\"  \"You can do no more than try. It may not be so easy as your boasting would seeming indicate. Lad,\" and the newcomer turned to the boy, \"why does this arrogant knight wish you harm?\"  \"He would have me carry a message, a challenge to Sir Kay, and that I cannot do, for even now I bear a message from Sir Percival, whose page I am but yesterday become. And I must hold true to my own lord and liege.\"  \"True words and well spoken. And so for you, Sir Knight of the arrogant tongue, I hope your weapon speaks equally well. Prepare you, sir.\"  Sir Pellimore laughed loudly and disdainfully.  \"I call this great fortune which brings me battle with you, sir, who are unknown but who I hope, none the less, are a true and brave knight.\"  The next second the two horses crashed together. Sir Pellimore soon proved his skill. The Unknown, equally at ease, contented himself with meeting onslaught after onslaught, parrying clever thrusts and wicked blows. So they battled for many an hour.  Allan, the boy, with eyes glistening, waited to see the outcome of the brave fight. The Unknown, his champion, perhaps would need his aid through some dire misfortune and he was prepared.  Now the Unknown changed his method from one of defense to one of offense. But Sir Pellimore was none the less skillful. The third charge of his foe he met so skillfully that both horses crashed to the ground. On foot, the two men then fought--well and long. Until, through inadvertence, the Unknown's foot slipped and the next moment found his shield splintered and sword broken.  \"Now then, by my guardian saint, you are truly vanquished,\" Sir Pellimore exclaimed exultantly. \"Say you so?\"  But the Unknown had already hurled himself, weaponless, upon the seeming victor and seizing him about the waist with mighty strength, hurled him to the ground. And even as the fallen knight, much shaken, prepared to arise, lo, Merlin the Wizard appeared and cast him into a deep sleep.  \"Sire,\" the Wizard declared, \"do you indeed run many dangers that thy station should not warrant. And yet, I know not whether we, your loyal subjects, would have it otherwise.\"  Now Allan, the boy, realized he was in the presence of the great King. He threw himself upon his knees.  \"Rise lad,\" said King Arthur kindly. \"Sir Percival is indeed fortunate to have a page, who while so young, yet is so loyal. So shall we see you again. Kind Merlin,\" and the King turned to the Wizard, \"awaken you this sleeping knight whose only sin seems an undue amount of surliness and arrogance, which his bravery and strength more than offset.\"  Now Sir Pellimore rubbed his eyes. \"Where am I?\" he muttered drowsily. Then as realization came, he sprang to his feet.  \"Know you then, Sir Pellimore,\" said Merlin, \"he with whom you fought is none other than Arthur, the King.\"  The knight stood motionless, dumbfounded. But only for a moment.  \"If so, then am I prepared for such punishment as may come. But be it what it may, I can say this, that none with whom I fought has had more skill or has shown greater bravery and chivalry. And more than that none can say.\"  And the knight bowed low his head, humbly and yet with a touch of pride.  \"Thou art a brave knight, Sir Pellimore. And to us it seems, that aside from a hasty temper, thou couldst well honor us by joining the Knights of the Round Table. What saith thou?\"  \"That shall I gladly do. And here and now I pledge my loyalty to none other than Arthur, King of Britain, and to my fellow knights. And as for you, boy, I say it now--that my harsh tongue and temper ill became the true knight I claim to be.\"  \"Brave words, Sir Pellimore,\" said the King. \"So let us back to the castle. We see that Merlin is already ill at ease.\"     CHAPTER TWO  Allan Goes Forth   So then the four, the good King, Sir Pellimore, Merlin the Wizard, and Allan, page to Sir Percival, came to the great castle of Britain's king.  Arthur led them into the great hall in which were placed many small tables and in the center of them all was one of exceeding size and round. Here was to be found a place for Sir Pellimore but though the King searched long, few seats did he find which were not bespoken. Yet finally he found one which did well for the new arrival.  \"Here then shall you find your place at the Round Table, good knight,\" said the King. \"And we trust that you will bring renown and honor to your fellowship, succor to those who are in need and that always will you show true chivalry. And we doubt not but you will do all of these.\"  Sir Pellimore bowed low his head nor did he make reply because within him surged a great feeling of gratitude.  The King turned away and Merlin followed him to the upraised dais. So now the two seated themselves and joined in earnest talk.  At the door, Allan had waited, for he would not depart until His Majesty had seated himself. A strange gladness was in the boy's heart, for had not his King fought for him? Here in this court, he too would find adventure. Sir Percival mayhap, some day, would dub him knight, should he prove faithful and worthy. What greater glory could there be than to fight for such a King and with such brave men?  \"But I must be off,\" he suddenly bethought himself, \"else"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6582"],["title","In the Court of King Arthur (#1)"],["body","Percival will not be pleased.\" And therewith, he made great haste to depart.  \"Aye, sire,\" Merlin was now speaking, \"my dream is indeed weighted with importance. But by the same taken, it cannot be known until you call your court together so that it may be heard by all.\"  \"Then mean you, kind Merlin, that we must call not only those of the Round Table but all other knights and even pages and squires?\"  \"Even so, sire. And yet, since Whitsunday is but a few days away, that should be no hard matter. For the knights of your court, except Sir Launcelot and Sir Gawaine are here, prepared for such tourneys and feasts fit to celebrate that day.\"  \"So then shall it be. Even now our heralds shall announce that we crave the attendance of all those who pledge loyalty to our court. For I know well that they must be of no mean import, these things we shall hear. We pray only that they shall be for our good fortune.\"  The Wizard, making no reply, bent low and kissed his King's hand. Then he departed.  Came now his herald whom the King had summoned.  \"See to it that our court assembles this time tomorrow. Make far and distant outcry so that all who are within ear may hear and so hurry to our call. And mark you this well. We would hare Sir Launcelot and our own nephew, Sir Gawaine, present even though they departed this early morn for Cornwall. See you to it.\"  Swiftly the herald made for the door to carry out the commands of his King. But even as he reached it, Arthur called again to him.  \"We have a fancy, good herald, we fain would have you follow. Ask then Sir Percival to let us have the services of his page who seems a likely youth and bid this youth go hence after the two absent knights, Sir Gawaine and Sir Launcelot and give to them our message, beseeching their return. Tell not the boy it is we who have asked that he go.\"  \"It shall be done as you will, sire,\" replied the herald. No surprise did he show at the strangeness of the King's command for long had he been in his service and well he knew the King's strange fancies.  Sir Percival gave ready consent, when found. So when the boy had returned from the errand forespoken, the herald announced that he must hasten after the two knights and bid them return.  \"And by my faith, lad, you have but little time and you must speed well. For tomorrow at this time is this conclave called, and the two knights are already many miles on their journey. Take you this horse and hasten.\"  Then, as the eager youth, quick pulsed, made haste to obey, the herald added in kindly voice: \"It would be well could you succeed, lad. For it is often true that through such missions, newcomers prove future worthiness for knighthood.\"  \"I thank you greatly for your kindness,\" replied the boy. \"I can but try to the uttermost. No rest shall I have until I meet with the two knights.\"  So now Allan sought out and bespoke his own lord.  \"I wish you well, Allan,\" said Sir Percival. \"And say you to my friends Launcelot and Gawaine should they prove reluctant that they will favor their comrade, Sir Percival, if they would make haste and hurry their return. Stop not to pick quarrel nor to heed any call, urgent though it may seem. Prove my true page and worthy.\"  \"I shall do my very best, my lord. And, this my first commission, shall prove successful even though to make it so, I perish.\"  Swiftly now rode forth the boyish figure. Well, too, had Arthur chosen. Came a day when, than Allan, no braver, truer knight there was. But of that anon.     CHAPTER THREE  A Combat   \"Good Launcelot, I trust that good fortune shall be with us and that our adventures be many and the knights we meet bold and brave.\"  \"Of that, Gawaine, we need have no fear. For adventure ever follows where one seeks and often enough overtakes the seeker. Let us rather hope that we shall find Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadian, both of Cornwall. For myself I would joust with Sir Tristram than whom braver and bolder knight does not live.\"  \"And as for me,\" spoke Gawaine, \"my anxiety is to see Mark, the king of Cornwall, and tell him to his face that I deem him a scurvy hound since he promised protection to Beatrice of Banisar as she passed through his lands and yet broke his promise and so holds her for ransom.\"  \"And there shall I help you, dear Gawaine. For bitterly shall Mark rue his unknightly act. Shall I even wait for my event with Sir Tristram until your business is done.\"  \"Aye, and gladly will Sir Tristram wait, I wot, if he deems it honor to meet with Sir Launcelot du Lake. For no knight there is who doth not know of your prowess and repute, Sir Tristram least of all.\"  \"Kind words, Gawaine, for which I thank you. Yet, if I mistake not, yonder, adventure seems to wait. And we but a little more than two score miles from our gates.\"  Ahead of them and barring their way were ten knights. Launcelot and Gawaine stopped not a moment their pace but rode boldly forward.  \"And wherefor do you, strange Knights, dispute our passage?\" asked Sir Gawaine.  \"Safely may you both pass unless you be gentlemen of King Arthur's court,\" quote the leader who stepped forward to answer.  \"And what if we be, Sir Knight?\" replied Sir Launcelot mildly.  \"And if you be then must you battle to the uttermost. For we owe loyalty to King Ryence who is enemy of King Arthur. Therefore, are we his enemies too, and enemies also of all of King Arthur's subjects. And thus, we flaunt our enmity. We here and now call King Arthur an upstart and if you be of his court you cannot do aught else but fight with us.\"  \"Keep you your words,\" said Sir Gawaine, \"until we have ceased our quarrel. Then if you will you may call Arthur any names. Prepare you.\"  Boldly Sir Launcelot and Sir Gawaine charged upon the foe. Nor did the knights who met them know who these two were, else milder were their tone. Such was the valor of the two and such their strength that four men were thrown from their horses in that first attack and of these two were grievously wounded.  Together and well they fought. Easily did they withstand the men of King Ryence. Four men were slain by their might, through wondrous and fearful strokes, and four were sorely wounded. There lay the four against an oaken tree where they had been placed in a moment's lull. But two knights were left to oppose Launcelot and Gawaine but these two were gallant men and worthy, the very best of all the ten.  So they fought again each with a single foe. Hard pressed were the two men of King Ryence, yet stubbornly they would not give way. And as each side gave blow for blow, so each called \"for Arthur\" or \"for Ryence,\" whichever the case might be. Many hours they fought until at last Sir Launcelot by a powerful blow crashed both foe and foe's horse to the ground.  And as the other would further combat, though exceedingly weak, Sir Launcelot, upraised lance in hand by a swift stroke smote sword from out of his weakened grasp.  \"Thou art a brave knight, friend. And having fought so well, I ask no further penance but this, that you do now declare King Arthur no upstart. I care not for your enmity but I will abide no slander.\"  \"So must I then declare, since you have proven better man than I,\" declared the conquered knight. \"And for your leniency I owe you thanks. Wherefore then to whom am I grateful? I pray your name?\"  \"That I shall not tell until I hear your own,\" replied Launcelot.  \"I am known as Ronald de Lile,\" the other replied in subdued tone.  \"Truly and well have I heard of you as a brave knight,\" was the reply, \"and now I know it to be so. I am Sir Launcelot du Lake.\"  \"Then indeed is honor mine and glory, too. For honor it is to succumb to Sir Launcelot.\"  But now both heard the voice of Gawaine. Weak had he grown, but weaker still his foe. Gawaine had brought the other to earth at last with swift and mighty blow and such was the force of his stroke the fallen man could not rise although he made great ado so to do.  \"So must I yield,\" this knight declared. \"Now will I admit Arthur no upstart, but though I die for it I do declare no greater king than Ryence ever lived.\"  \"By my faith, your words are but such as any knight must hold of his own sovereign prince. I cannot take offense at brave words, Sir Knight. Now, give me your name, for you are strong and worthy.\"  \"I am Marvin, brother of him who fought with your comrade. And never have we met bolder and greater knights.\"  \"I am Gawaine and he who fought your brother is none other than Launcelot.\"  \"Then truly have we met no mean foes,\" replied the other.  Conquered and conquerers now turned to make the wounded as comfortable as they well could be. After which, our two knights debated going on their journey or tarrying where they were until the morn.  \"Let us wend our way until we find fit place for food and rest. There can we tarry.\" So spoke Launcelot and the other agreed.  Then they took leave of Sir Marvin and Sir Ronald and so on their way. Not many miles did they go however before they found suitable place. Late was the hour and weary and much in need of rest were the two knights. So they slept while, half his journey covered, Allan sped onward, making fast time because he was but light of weight and his horse exceeding swift.     CHAPTER FOUR  Allan Meets the Knights   From the first day when Allan began to understand the tales of chivalry and knightly deeds, he fancied and longed for the day when he would grow into manhood and by the same token into knighthood. Then would he go unto King Arthur on some Pentecost and crave the boon of serving him. Mayhap, too, he would through brave and worthy deeds gain seat among those of the Round Table. So he would dream, this youth with eager eyes, and his father, Sir Gaunt, soon came to know of his son's fancies and was overly proud and pleased with them. For he himself had, in his days, been a great and worthy knight, of many adventures and victor of many an onslaught. It pleased him that son of his would follow in his footsteps."]]]
