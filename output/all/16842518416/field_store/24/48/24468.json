Nouvelle France_ par Lescarbot, Paris. 1612, Qvat Liv. pp. 461, 462.      It is now called De Monts's Island. It has been called Dochet's Island     and Neutral Island, but there is great appropriateness in calling it     after its first occupant and proprietor, and in honor of him it has     been so named with suitable ceremonies.--_Vide Godfrey's Centennial     Discourse_, Bangor, 1870, p. 20. The United States maintain a light     upon the island, which is seventy-one feet above the level of the sea,     and is visible twelve nautical miles. The island itself is moderately     high, and in the widest part is one hundred and eighty paces or about     five hundred and forty feet. The area is probably not more than six or     seven acres, although it has been estimated at twice that. It may have     been diminished in some slight degree since the time of Champlain by     the action of the waves, but probably very little. On the southern     extremity of the island where De Monts placed his cannon, about     twenty-five years ago a workman in excavating threw out five small     cannon-balls, one of which was obtained by Peter E. Vose, Esq., of     Dennysville, Me., who then resided near the island, and was conversant     with all the circumstances of the discovery. They were about a foot and     a half below the surface, and the workman was excavating for another     purpose, and knew nothing of the history of the island. At our     solicitation, the ball belonging to Mr. Vose has recently been     presented to the New England Historic Genealogical Society, of which he     is a member. It is iron, perfectly round, two and a quarter inches in     diameter, and weighs 22 oz. avoirdupois. There can be no reasonable     doubt that these balls are relics of the little French colony of 1604,     and probably the only memorial of the kind now in existence.  87. The description in the text of the environs of the Island of St. Croix     is entirely accurate. Some distance above, and in view from the island,     is the fork, or Divide, as it is called. Here is a meeting of the     waters of Warwig Creek from the east, Oak Bay from the north, and the     river of the Etechemins, now called the St. Croix, from the west. These     are the three rivers mentioned by Champlain, Oak Bay being considered     as one of them, in which may be seen the two islands mentioned in the     text, one high and the other low. A little above Calais is the     waterfall, around which the Indians carried their bark canoes, when on     their journey up the river through the Scoudic lakes, from which by     land they reached the river St. John on the east, or, on the west,     passing through the Mettawamkeag, they reached the Norumbegue, or     Penobscot River.  88. The latitude of the Island of St. Croix is 45° 7' 43\".     CHAPTER IV.  SIEUR DE MONTS, FINDING NO OTHER PLACE BETTER ADAPTED FOR A PERMANENT SETTLEMENT THAN THE ISLAND OF ST. CROIX, FORTIFIES IT AND BUILDS DWELLINGS.--RETURN OF THE VESSELS TO FRANCE, AND OF RALLEAU, SECRETARY OF SIEUR DE MONTS, FOR THE SAKE OF ARRANGING SOME BUSINESS AFFAIRS.   Not finding any more suitable place than this island, we commenced making a barricade on a little islet a short distance from the main island, which served as a station for placing our cannon. All worked so energetically that in a little while it was put in a state of defence, although the mosquitoes (which are little flies) annoyed us excessively in our work. For there were several of our men whose faces were so swollen by their bites that they could scarcely see. The barricade being finished, Sieur de Monts sent his barque to notify the rest of our party, who were with our vessel in the bay of St. Mary, to come to St. Croix. This was promptly done, and while awaiting them we spent our time very pleasantly.  Some days after, our vessels having arrived and anchored, all disembarked. Then, without losing time, Sieur de Monts proceeded to employ the workmen in building houses for our abode, and allowed me to determine the arrangement of our settlement. After Sieur de Monts had determined the place for the storehouse, which is nine fathoms long, three wide, and twelve feet high, he adopted the plan for his own house, which he had promptly built by good workmen, and then assigned to each one his location. Straightway, the men began to gather together by fives and sixes, each according to his desire. Then all set to work to clear up the island, to go to the woods, to make the frame work, to carry earth and other things necessary for the buildings.         *       *       *       *       *  CHAMPLAIN'S DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING MAP.

Some time after he had set out, there arrived a small barque of eight tons, in which was Du Glas of Honfleur, pilot of Pont Grave's vessel, bringing the Basque ship-masters, who had been captured by the above Pont Gravé [90] while engaged in the fur-trade, as we have stated. Sieur de Monts received them civilly, and sent them back by the above Du Glas to Pont Gravé, with orders for him to take the vessels he had captured to Rochelle, in order that justice might be done. Meanwhile, work on the houses went on vigorously and without cessation; the carpenters engaged on the storehouse and dwelling of Sieur de Monts, and the others each on his own house, as I was on mine, which I built with the assistance of some servants belonging to Sieur d'Orville and myself. It was forthwith completed, and Sieur de Monts lodged in it until his own was finished. An oven was also made, and a handmill for grinding our wheat, the working of which involved much trouble and labor to the most of us, since it was a toilsome operation. Some gardens were afterwards laid out, on the main land as well as on the island. Here many kinds of seeds were planted, which flourished very well on the main land, but not on the island, since there was only sand here, and the whole were burned up when the sun shone, although special pains were taken to water them.  Some days after, Sieur de Monts determined to ascertain where the mine of pure copper was which we had searched for so much. With this object in view, he despatched me together with a savage named Messamoüet, who asserted that he knew the place well. I set out in a small barque of five or six tons, with nine sailors. Some eight leagues from the island, towards the river St. John, we found a mine of copper which was not pure, yet good according to the report of the miner, who said that it would yield eighteen per cent. Farther on we found others inferior to this. When we reached the place where we supposed that was which we were hunting for, the savage could not find it, so that it was necessary to come back, leaving the search for another time.  Upon my return from this trip. Sieur de Monts resolved to send his vessels back to France, and also Sieur de Poutrincourt, who had come only for his pleasure, and to explore countries and places suitable for a colony, which he desired to found; for which reason he asked Sieur de Monts for Port Royal, which he gave him in accordance with the power and directions he had received from the king. [91] He sent back also Ralleau, his secretary, to arrange some matters concerning the voyage. They set out from the Island of St. Croix the last day of August, 1604.  ENDNOTES:  89. This was the vessel taken from Captain Rossignol and confiscated.--     _Vide antea_, pp. 10, 12; also note 26.  90. Champlain and others often write only Pont for Pont Gravé. Lescarbot     says Gravé was his surname.--_Vide Histoire de la Nou. Fran_., Paris,     1612, Qvat. Liv. p. 501. To prevent any confusion, we write it Pont     Gravé in all cases.  91. De Monts's charter provided for the distribution of lands to colonists.     This gift to De Poutrincourt was confirmed afterwards by the king. We     may here remark that there is the usual discrepancy in the orthography     of this name. Lescarbot, De Laet, and Charlevoix write Poutrincourt.

CHAPTER I   A watery July sun was hurrying toward a Punjab sky-line, as if weary of squandering his strength on men who did not mind, and resentful of the unexplainable--a rainy-weather field-day. The cold steel and khaki of native Indian cavalry at attention gleamed motionless between British infantry and two batteries of horse artillery. The only noticeable sound was the voice of a general officer, that rose and fell explaining and asserting pride in his command, but saying nothing as to the why of exercises in the mud. Nor did he mention why the censorship was in full force. He did not say a word of Germany, or Belgium.  In front of the third squadron from the right, Risaldar-Major Ranjoor Singh sat his charger like a big bronze statue. He would have stooped to see his right spur better, that shone in spite of mud, for though he has been a man these five-and-twenty years, Ranjoor Singh has neither lost his boyhood love of such things, nor intends to; he has been accused of wearing solid silver spurs in bed. But it hurt him to bend much, after a day's hard exercise on a horse such as he rode.  Once--in a rock-strewn gully where the whistling Himalayan wind was Acting Antiseptic-of-the-Day--a young surgeon had taken hurried stitches over Ranjoor Singh's ribs without probing deep enough for an Afghan bullet; that bullet burned after a long day in the saddle. And Bagh was--as the big brute's name implied--a tiger of a horse, unweakened even by monsoon weather, and his habit was to spring with terrific suddenness when his rider moved on him.  So Ranjoor Singh sat still. He was willing to eat agony at any time for the squadron's sake--for a squadron of Outram's Own is a unity to marvel at, or envy; and its leader a man to be forgiven spurs a half-inch longer than the regulation. As a soldier, however, he was careful of himself when occasion offered.  Sikh-soldier-wise, he preferred Bagh to all other horses in the world, because it had needed persuasion, much stroking of a black beard--to hide anxiety--and many a secret night-ride--to sweat the brute's savagery--before the colonel-sahib could be made to see his virtues as a charger and accept him into the regiment. Sikh-wise, he loved all things that expressed in any way his own unconquerable fire. Most of all, however, he loved the squadron; there was no woman, nor anything between him and D Squadron; but Bagh came next.  Spurs were not needed when the general ceased speaking, and the British colonel of Outram's Own shouted an order. Bagh, brute energy beneath hand-polished hair and plastered dirt, sprang like a loosed Hell-tantrum, and his rider's lips drew tight over clenched teeth as he mastered self, agony and horse in one man's effort. Fight how he would, heel, tooth and eye all flashing, Bagh was forced to hold his rightful place in front of the squadron, precisely the right distance behind the last supernumerary of the squadron next in front.  Line after rippling line, all Sikhs of the true Sikh baptism except for the eight of their officers who were European, Outram's Own swept down a living avenue of British troops; and neither gunners nor infantry could see one flaw in them, although picking flaws in native regiments is almost part of the British army officer's religion.  To the blare of military music, through a bog of their own mixing, the Sikhs trotted for a mile, then drew into a walk, to bring the horses into barracks cool enough for watering.  They reached stables as the sun dipped under the near-by acacia trees, and while the black-bearded troopers scraped and rubbed the mud from weary horses, Banjoor Singh went through a task whose form at least was part of his very life. He could imagine nothing less than death or active service that could keep him from inspecting every horse in the squadron before he ate or drank, or as much as washed himself.  But, although the day had been a hard one and the strain on the horses more than ordinary, his examination now was so perfunctory that the squadron gaped; the troopers signaled with their eyes as he passed, little more than glancing at each horse. Almost before his back had vanished at the stable entrance, wonderment burst into words.  \"For the third time he does thus!\"  \"See! My beast overreached, and he passed without detecting it! Does the sun set the same way still?\"  \"I have noticed that he does thus each time after a field-day. What is the connection? A field-day in the rains--a general officer talking to us afterward about the Salt, as if a Sikh does not understand the Salt better than a British general knows English--and our risaldar-major neglecting the horses--is there a connection?\"  \"Aye. What is all this? We worked no harder in the war against the Chitralis. There is something in my bones that speaks of war, when I listen for a while!\"  \"War! Hear him, brothers! Talk is talk, but there will be no war until India grows too fat to breathe--unless the past be remembered and we make one for ourselves!\"         *       *       *       *       *  There was silence for a while, if a change of sounds is silence. The Delhi mud sticks as tight as any, and the kneading of it from out of horsehair taxes most of a trooper's energy and full attention. Then, the East being the East in all things, a solitary trooper picked up the scent and gave tongue, as a true hound guides the pack.  \"Who is _she_?\" he wondered, loud enough for fifty men to hear.  From out of a cloud of horse-dust, where a stable helper on probation combed a tangled tail, came one word of swift enlightenment.  \"Yasmini!\"  \"Ah-h-h-h!\" In a second the whole squadron was by the ears, and the stable-helper was the center of an interest he had not bargained for.  \"Nay, sahibs, I but followed him, and how should I know? Nay, then I did not follow him! It so happened. I took that road, and he stepped out of a _tikka-gharri_ at her door. Am I blind? Do I not know her door? Does not everybody know it? Who am I that I should know why he goes again? But--does a moth fly only once to the lamp-flame? Does a drunkard drink but once? By the Guru, nay! May my tongue parch in my throat if I said he is a drunkard! I said--I meant to say--seeing she is Yasmini, and he having been to see her once--and being again in a great hurry--whither goes he?\"  So the squadron chose a sub-committee of inquiry, seven strong, that being a lucky number the wide world over, and the movements of the risaldar-major were reported one by one to the squadron with the infinite exactness of small detail that seems so useless to all save Easterns.  Fifteen minutes after he had left his quarters, no longer in khaki uniform, but dressed as a Sikh gentleman, the whole squadron knew the color of his undershirt, also that he had hired a _tikka-gharri_, and that his only weapon was the ornamental dagger that a true Sikh wears twisted in his hair. One after one, five other men reported him nearly all the way through Delhi, through the Chandni Chowk--where the last man but one nearly lost him in the evening crowd--to the narrow place where, with a bend in the street to either hand, is Yasmini's.  The last man watched him through Yasmini's outer door and up the lower stairs before hurrying back to the squadron. And a little later on, being almost as inquisitive as they were careful for their major, the squadron delegated other men, in mufti, to watch for him at the foot of Yasmini's stairs, or as near to the foot as might be, and see him safely home again if they had to fight all Asia on the way.  These men had some money with them, and weapons hidden underneath their clothes; for, having betted largely on the quail-fight at Abdul's stables, the squadron was in funds.  \"In case of trouble one can bribe the police,\" counseled Nanak Singh, and he surely ought to know, for he was the oldest trooper, and trouble everlasting had preserved him from promotion. \"But weapons are good, when policemen are not looking,\" he added, and the squadron agreed with him.  It was Tej Singh, not given to talking as is rule, who voiced the general opinion.  \"Now we are on the track of things. Now, perhaps, we shall know the meaning of field exercises during the monsoon, with our horses up to the belly in blue mud! The winds of all the world blow into Yasmini's and out again. Our risaldar-major knows nothing at all of women--and that is the danger. But he can listen to the wind; and, what he hears, sooner or later we shall know, too. I smell happenings!\"  Those three words comprised the whole of it. The squadron spent most of the night whispering, dissecting, analyzing, subdividing, weighing, guessing at that smell of happenings, while its risaldar-major, thinking his secret all his own, investigated nearer to its source.     Have you heard the dry earth shrug herself   For a storm that tore the trees?    Have you watched loot-hungry Faithful   Praising Allah on their knees?    Have you felt the short hairs rising   When the moon slipped out of sight,    And the chink of steel on rock explained   That footfall in the night?
