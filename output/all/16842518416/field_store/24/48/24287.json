Put him out of the play, and I shall be the happiest man in the world.\"  \"Agreed.\"  \"Now, in what way can I serve you?\"  Mrs. Keap became embarrassed, while the same shadowy trouble that had been observed of late settled upon her.  \"I simply hate to ask it,\" she said, \"but I suppose I must. There seems to be no other way out of it.\" Turning to him suddenly, she said, in a low, intense voice: \"I--I'm in trouble, Mr. Speed, such dreadful trouble!\"  \"Oh, I'm so sorry!\" he answered her, with genuine solicitude. \"You needn't have made any conditions. I would have done anything I could for you.\"  \"That's very kind, for I don't like our air of conspiracy, but\"-- Mrs. Keap was wringing her slender hands--\"I just can't tell the girls. You--you can help me.\"  Speed allowed her time to grow calm, when she continued:  \"I--I am engaged to be married.\"  \"Felicitations!\"  \"Not at all,\" said the young widow, wretchedly. \"That is the awful part of it. I am engaged to _two_ men!\" She turned her brown eyes full upon him; they were strained and tragic.  Speed felt himself impelled to laugh immoderately, but instead he observed, in a tone to relieve her anxiety:  \"Nothing unusual in that; it has been done before. Even I have been prodigal with my affections. What can I do to relieve the congestion?\"  \"Please don't make light of it. It means so much to me. I--I'm in love with Jack Chapin.\"  \"With Jack!\"  \"Yes. When I came here I thought I cared for somebody else. Why, I wanted to come here just because I knew that--that somebody else had been invited too, and we could be together.\"  \"And he couldn't come--\"  \"Wait! And then, when I got here, I met Jack Chapin. That was less than a week ago, and yet in that short time I have learned that he is the only man I can ever love--the one man in all the world.\"  \"And you can't accept because you have a previous engagement. I see! Jove! It's quite dramatic. But I don't see why you are so excited? If the other chap isn't coming--\"  \"But he is! That is what makes it so dreadful! If those two men should meet\"--Mrs. Keap buried her face in her hands and shuddered--\"there would be a tragedy, they are both so frightfully jealous.\" She began to tremble, and Speed laid a comforting hand upon her shoulder.  \"I think you must be exciting yourself unduly,\" said he, \"Jean's other friends didn't come. There's nobody due now but Culver Cov--\"  \"That's who it is!\" Roberta raised her pallid face as the young man fell back.  \"Culver! Great Scott! Why, he's engaged--\"  \"What!\"  \"Nothing! I--I--\" Speed paused, at an utter loss for words. \"You see, he'll discover the truth.\"  \"Does he know you are here?\"  \"No. I intended to surprise him. I was jealous. I couldn't bear to think of his being here with other girls--men are so deceitful! That's why I consented to act as chaperon to Helen. And now to think that I should have met my fate in Jack Chapin!\"  \"I see. You want me to break the news to Culver.\"  \"No! no!\" Mrs. Keap was aghast. \"If he even suspected the truth he'd become a raging lion. Oh, I've been quite distracted ever since Jack left!\"  \"Well, what am I to do? You must have some part laid out for me?\"  \"I have. A desperate situation demands a desperate remedy. I've lost all conscience. That's why I agreed to protect you if you'd protect me.\"  \"Go ahead.\"  \"Culver is your friend.\"  \"We're closer than a chord in G.\"  \"Then you must wire him--\"  \"I have--\"  \"--not to come.\"  \"What!\" J. Wallingford Speed started as if a wasp had stung him.  \"You must wire him at once not to come. I don't care what excuse you give, but stop him. _Stop_ him!\"  Speed reached for a pillar; he felt that the porch was spinning slowly beneath his feet.  \"Oh, see here, now! I can't do that!\"  \"You promised!\" cried Mrs. Keap, fiercely. \"I have tried to think of something to tell him, but I'm too frightened.\"  \"Yes, but--but I--want him here--for this foot-race.\" Wally swallowed bravely.  \"Foot-race!\" stormed the widow, indignantly. \"Would you allow an insignificant thing like a foot-race to wreck a human life? Two human lives? _Three?_\"  \"Can't you--wire him?\"  Mrs. Keap stamped her foot. \"If he dreamed I was here he would hire a special train. No! It must come from you. You are his best friend.\"  \"What can I say?\" demanded the bewildered Speed, unhappily. \"I don't care what you say, I don't care what you do--only do _something_, and do it quickly before he has time to leave Chicago.\" Then sensing the hesitation in her companion's face: \"Or perhaps you prefer to have Helen know the deceit you have practiced upon her? And I fancy these cowboys would resent the joke, don't you? What do you think would happen if they discovered their champion to be merely a cheerleader with a trunkful of new clothes, who can't do a single out-door sport-- not one!\"  \"Wait!\" Speed mopped his brow with a red-and-blue silk handkerchief. \"I'll do my best.\"  \"Then I shall do my part.\" And Mrs. Keap, who could not bear deception, turned and went indoors while J. Wallingford Speed, a prey to sundry misgivings, stumbled down the steps, his head in a whirl.     CHAPTER VII  Berkeley Fresno was devoting himself to Miss Blake.  \"What do you think of our decorations?\" she inquired.  \"They are more or less athletic,\" he declared. \"Was it Mr. Speed's idea?\"  \"Yes. He wanted training-quarters.\"  \"It's a joke, isn't it?\"  \"I don't think so. Mr. Fresno, why do you dislike Mr. Speed?\"  Fresno bent a warm glance upon the questioner. \"Don't you know?\"  Helen shook her head with bland innocence. \"Then you _do_ dislike him?\"  \"No, indeed! _I_ like him--he makes me laugh.\" Helen bridled loyally. \"Did you see those medals he wore yesterday?\" the young man queried.  \"Of course, and I thought them beautiful.\"  \"How were they inscribed? He wouldn't let me examine them.\"  \"Naturally. If I had trophies like that I would guard them too.\"  Fresno nodded, musingly. \"I gave mine away.\"  \"Oh, are you an athlete?\"  \"No, but I timed a foot-race once. They gave me a beautiful nearly-bronze emblem so that I could get into the infield.\"  \"And did you win?\"  \"No! no! I didn't run! Don't you understand? I was an official.\" Fresno was vexed at the girl's lack of perception. \"I'm not an athlete, Miss Blake. I'm just an ordinary sort of a chap.\" He led her to a seat, while Jean enlisted the aid of Larry Glass and completed the finishing touches to the decorations. \"Athletics don't do a fellow any good after he leaves college. I'm going into business this fall. Have you ever been to California?\" Miss Blake admitted that she had never been so far, and Fresno launched himself upon a glowing description of his native State; but before he could shape the conversation to a point where his hearer might perchance express a desire to see its wonders, Still Bill Stover thrust his head cautiously through the door to the bunk-house, and allowed an admiring eye to rove over the transformation.  \"Looks like a bazaar!\" he exclaimed. \"What's the idea?\"  \"Trainin'-quarters,\" said Glass.  \"Mr. Speed goin' to _live_ here?\" inquired the foreman, bringing the remainder of his lanky body into view.  \"No, indeed,\" Jean corrected, \"he will merely use this room to train in.\"  \"How do you train in a room?\" Stover asked her.  \"Why, you--just train, I suppose.\" Miss Chapin turned to Glass. \"How does a person train in a room?\"  \"Why, he--just trains, that's all. A guy can't train without trainin'-quarters, can he?\"  \"We thought it would make a nice gymnasium,\" offered Miss Blake.  \"Looks like business.\" Stover's admiration was keen. \"I rode over to Gallagher's place last night and laid our bets.\"  \"How much have you wagered?\" asked Fresno.  \"More'n we can afford to lose.\"  \"But you aren't going to lose,\" Miss Blake said, enthusiastically.  \"I got Gallagher to play some records for me.\"  \"_Silas on Fifth Avenue?_\"  \"Sure! And _The Holy City_, too! Willie stayed out by the barb-wire fence; he didn't dast to go in. When I come out I found him ready to cry. That desperado has sure got the heart of a woman. I reckon he'd commit a murder for that phonograph--he's so full of sentiment.\"  Fresno spoke sympathetically.  \"It's a fortunate thing for you fellows that Speed came when he did. I'm anxious for him to beat this cook, and I hate to see him so careless with his training.\"  \"Careless!\" cried Helen.  \"What's he done?\" inquired Stover.  \"Nothing, so far. That's the trouble. He's sure he can win, but\" --Fresno shook his head, doubtfully--\"there's such a thing as overconfidence. No matter how good a man may be, he should take care of himself.\"  \"What's wrong with his trainin'?\" demanded Glass.  \"I think he ought to have more rest. It's too noisy around the house; he can't get enough sleep.\"  \"Nor anybody else,\" agreed Glass, meaningly; \"there's too much singin'.\"  \"That's funny,\" said Stover. \"Music soothes me, no matter how bad it is. Last night when we come back from the Centipede Mr. Fresno was singin' _Dearie_, but I dozed right off in the middle of it. An' it's the same way with cattle. They like it. It's part of a man's duty when he's night-ridin' a herd to pizen the atmosphere with melody.\"  \"What I mean to say is this,\" Fresno hastened to explain. \"We keep late hours at the house, whereas an athlete ought to retire early and arise with the sun. I thought it would be a good scheme to have Mr. Speed sleep out here until the race is over, where he won't be disturbed. Nine o'clock is bedtime for a man in training.\"  \"Oh, I don't think that is at all necessary,\" said Miss Blake quickly.  \"We can't afford to spoil his chances,\" argued the young man. \"There is too much at stake. Am I right, Mr. Glass?\"  Now, like most fat men, Lawrence Glass was fond of his rest, and since his arrival at the Flying Heart his sleeping-hours had been shortened considerably, so for once he agreed with the Californian. \"No question about it,\" said he. \"And I'll sleep here with him if you'll put a couple of cots in the place.\"  \"But"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6490"],["title","The Betrothed (#0)"],["body","the Online Distributed Proofreading Team.      THE BETROTHED     INTRODUCTION--(1832.)   The Tales of the Crusaders was determined upon as the title of the following series of the Novels, rather by the advice of the few friends whom, death has now rendered still fewer, than by the author's own taste. Not but that he saw plainly enough the interest which might be excited by the very name of the Crusaders, but he was conscious at the same time that that interest was of a character which it might be more easy to create than to satisfy, and that by the mention of so magnificent a subject each reader might be induced to call up to his imagination a sketch so extensive and so grand that it might not be in the power of the author to fill it up, who would thus stand in the predicament of the dwarf bringing with him a standard to measure his own stature, and showing himself, therefore, says Sterne, \"a dwarf more ways than one.\"  It is a fact, if it were worth while to examine it, that the publisher and author, however much their general interests are the same, may be said to differ so far as title pages are concerned; and it is a secret of the tale-telling art, if it could be termed a secret worth knowing, that a taking-title, as it is called, best answers the purpose of the bookseller, since it often goes far to cover his risk, and sells an edition not unfrequently before the public have well seen it. But the author ought to seek more permanent fame, and wish that his work, when its leaves are first cut open, should be at least fairly judged of. Thus many of the best novelists have been anxious to give their works such titles as render it out of the reader's power to conjecture their contents, until they should have an opportunity of reading them.  All this did not prevent the Tales of the Crusaders from being the title fixed on; and the celebrated year of projects (eighteen hundred and twenty-five) being the time of publication, an introduction was prefixed according to the humour of the day.    The first tale of the series was influenced in its structure, rather by the wish to avoid the general expectations which might be formed from the title, than to comply with any one of them, and so disappoint the rest. The story was, therefore, less an incident belonging to the Crusades, than one which was occasioned by the singular cast of mind introduced and spread wide by those memorable undertakings. The confusion among families was not the least concomitant evil of the extraordinary preponderance of this superstition. It was no unusual thing for a Crusader, returning from his long toils of war and pilgrimage, to find his family augmented by some young off-shoot, of whom the deserted matron could give no very accurate account, or perhaps to find his marriage-bed filled, and that, instead of becoming nurse to an old man, his household dame had preferred being the lady-love of a young one. Numerous are the stories of this kind told in different parts of Europe; and the returned knight or baron, according to his temper, sat down good naturedly contented with the account which his lady gave of a doubtful matter, or called in blood and fire to vindicate his honour, which, after all, had been endangered chiefly by his forsaking his household gods to seek adventures in Palestine.  Scottish tradition, quoted, I think, in some part of the Border Minstrelsy, ascribes to the clan of Tweedie, a family once stout and warlike, a descent which would not have misbecome a hero of antiquity. A baron, somewhat elderly we may suppose, had wedded a buxom young lady, and some months after their union he left her to ply the distaff alone in his old tower, among the mountains of the county of Peebles, near the sources of the Tweed. He returned after seven or eight years, no uncommon space for a pilgrimage to Palestine, and found his family had not been lonely in his absence, the lady having; been cheered by the arrival of a stranger, (of whose approach she could give the best account of any one,) who hung on her skirts, and called her mammy, and was just such as the baron would have longed to call his son, but that he could by no means make his age correspond, according to the doctrine of civilians, with his own departure for Palestine. He applied to his wife, therefore, for the solution of this dilemma. The lady, after many floods of tears, which she had reserved for the occasion, informed the honest gentleman, that, walking one day alone by the banks of the infant river, a human form arose from a deep eddy, still known and termed Tweed-pool, who deigned to inform her that he was the tutelar genius of the stream, and, _bongre malgre_, became the father of the sturdy fellow, whose appearance had so much surprised her husband. This story, however suitable to Pagan times, would have met with full credence from few of the baron's contemporaries, but the wife was young and beautiful, the husband old and in his dotage; her family (the Frazers, it is believed) were powerful and warlike, and the baron had had fighting enough in the holy wars. The event was, that he believed, or seemed to believe, the tale, and remained contented with the child with whom his wife and the Tweed had generously presented him. The only circumstance which preserved the memory of the incident was, that the youth retained the name of Tweed, or Tweedie. The baron, meanwhile, could not, as the old Scotch song says, \"Keep the cradle rowing,\" and the Tweed apparently thought one natural son was family enough for a decent Presbyterian lover; and so little gall had the baron in his composition, that having bred up the young Tweed as his heir while he lived, he left him in that capacity when he died, and the son of the river-god founded the family of Drummelzier and others, from whom have flowed, in the phrase of the Ettrick Shepherd, \"many a brave fellow, and many a bauld feat.\"  The tale of the Noble Moringer is somewhat of the same nature--it exists in a collection of German popular songs, entitled, Sammlung Deutschen Volkslieder, Berlin, 1807; published by Messrs. Busching and Von der Hagen. The song is supposed to be extracted from a manuscript chronicle of Nicholas Thomann, chaplain to St. Leonard in Wissenhorn, and dated 1533. The ballad, which is popular in Germany, is supposed from the language, to have been composed in the fifteenth century. The Noble Moringer, a powerful baron of Germany, about to set out on a pilgrimage to the land of St. Thomas, with the geography of which we are not made acquainted, resolves to commit his castle, dominions, and lady, to the vassal who should pledge him to keep watch over them till the seven years of his pilgrimage were accomplished. His chamberlain, an elderly and a cautious man, declines the trust, observing, that seven days, instead of seven years, would be the utmost space to which he would consent to pledge himself for the fidelity of any woman. The esquire of the Noble Moringer confidently accepts the trust refused by the chamberlain, and the baron departs on his pilgrimage. The seven years are now elapsed, all save a single day and night, when, behold, a vision descends on the noble pilgrim as he sleeps in the land of the stranger.    \"It was the noble Moringer, within an orchard slept,   When on the Baron's slumbering sense a boding vision crept,   And whispered in his ear a voice,'   'Tis time. Sir Knight, to wake--   Thy lady and thy heritage another master take.    \"'Thy tower another banner knows, thy steeds another rein,   And stoop them to another's will, thy gallant vassal train;   And she, the lady of thy love, so faithful once and fair,   This night, within thy father's hall, she weds Marstetten's heir.'\"  The Moringer starts up and prays to his patron St. Thomas, to rescue him from the impending shame, which his devotion to his patron had placed him in danger of incurring. St. Thomas, who must have felt the justice of the imputation, performs a miracle. The Moringer's senses were drenched in oblivion, and when he waked he lay in a well-known spot of his own domain; on his right the Castle of his fathers, and on his left the mill, which, as usual, was built not far distant from the Castle.    \"He leaned upon his pilgrim's staff, and to the mill he drew--   So altered was his goodly form that none their master knew.   The baron to the miller said, 'Good friend, for charity,   Tell a poor pilgrim, in your land, what tidings may there be?'    \"The miller answered him again--'He knew of little news,   Save that the lady of the land did a new bridegroom choose;   Her husband died in distant land, such is the constant word,   His death sits heavy on our souls, he was a worthy lord.    \"'Of him I held the little mill, which wins me living free--   God rest the baron in his grave, he aye was kind to me!   And when St. Martin's tide comes round, and millers take their toll,   The priest that prays for Moringer shall have both cope and stole.'\"  The baron proceeds to the Castle gate, which is bolted to prevent intrusion, while the inside of the mansion rung with preparations for the marriage of the lady. The pilgrim prayed the porter for entrance, conjuring him by his own sufferings, and for the sake of the late Moringer; by the orders of his lady, the warder gave him admittance.    \"Then up the hall paced Moringer, his step was sad and slow;   It sat full heavy on his heart, none seemed their lord to know.   He sat him on a lowly bench, oppressed with wo and wrong;   Short while he sat, but ne'er to him seemed little space so long.    \"Now spent was day, and feasting o'er, and come was evening hour,   The time was nigh when new made brides retire to nuptial bower,   'Our Castle's wont,' a bride's man said, 'hath been both firm and long--   No guest to harbour in our halls till he shall chant a song.'\"  When thus called upon, the disguised baron sung the following melancholy ditty:--    \"'Chill flows the lay of frozen age,' 't"]]]
