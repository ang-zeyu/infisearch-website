Some of this \"crewel\" work, done in the seventeenth century, is described by M. Jourdain in \"English Secular Embroidery\": \"These hangings, bed curtains, quilts, and valances are of linen or a mixture of cotton and linen, and one type is embroidered with bold, freely designed patterns in worsted. They are worked almost always in dull blues and greens mixed with more vivid greens and some browns, but rarely any other colouring.\"  A very curious custom of these days was the use of \"mourning beds,\" with black hangings, coverlets, and even sheets. As these funereal articles of furniture were quite expensive, it was a friendly custom to lend these mourning beds to families in time of affliction. In 1644 Mrs. Eure wrote to Sir Ralph Verney: \"Sweet Nephew, I am now overrun with miserys and troubles, but the greatest misfortune that could happen to me was the death of the gallantest man (her husband) that I ever knew.\" Whereupon Sir Ralph, full of sympathy, \"offers her the loan of the great black bed and hangings from Claydon.\"  Interesting indeed are descriptions of wonderful old quilts that are now guarded with zealous care in English museums. One, an original and striking design, is closely quilted all over in small diamonds. Upon it is embroidered an orange tree in full leaf and loaded with fruit. This tree, together with the fancy pot in which it is planted, covers practically the entire quilt. In the lower corners a gentleman is shown picking oranges and a lady in a patient attitude is waiting to receive them, the figures of both being scarcely taller than the flower pot. The whole design is made up of gayly coloured silks evidently worked in after the quilting was done. Mention is also made of an elaborate quilt said to be the work of Queen Anne, which is preserved at Madresfield Court. Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, in giving an order for house furnishings for her \"wild, unmerciful house\" about 1720, asks for \"a vast number of feather beds, some filled with swansdown, and a vast number of quilts.\"  Mrs. Delany, who lived from 1700 to 1788, and left a large correspondence relating to needlework, which was later edited by Lady Llanover, was a most prolific worker with her needle as well as a profuse letter writer. She was often quoted as an authority and given credit for much originality in her designs. A quilt that she made is described as follows: \"Of white linen worked in flowers, the size of nature, delineated with the finest coloured silks in running stitch, which is made use of in the same way as by a pen etching on paper; the outline was drawn with pencil. Each flower is different, and evidently done at the moment from the original.\" Another quilt of Mrs. Delany's was made upon a foundation of nankeen. This was unique in that no colours were used besides the dull yellow of the background. Applied designs of leaves tied together with ribbons, all cut from white linen and stitched to the nankeen with white thread, made a quilt no wise resembling the silken ones of earlier periods. This quilt may be termed a forerunner of the vast array of pieced and patched washable quilts belonging to the nineteenth century.  The embroidering of quilts followed the process of quilting, which afforded the firm foundation essential for heavy and elaborate designs. There were many quilts made of white linen quilted with yellow silk thread, and afterward embroidered very tastefully with yellow silk floss. Terry, in the history of his \"Voyage to the East Indies,\" made about the middle of the seventeenth century, says: \"The natives show very much ingenuity in their manufactures, also in making excellent quilts of their stained cloth, or of fresh-coloured taffeta lined with their prints, or of their satin with taffeta, betwixt which they put cotton wool, and work them together with silk.\"  Among many articles in a list of Eastern products, which Charles I, in 1631, permitted to be brought to England, were \"quilts of China embroidered in Gold.\" There is a possibility that these quilts were appreciated quite as much for the precious metal used in the embroidery as for the beauty of design and workmanship. It was but a short time after this that women began to realize how much gold and silver had gone into all forms of needlework. They looked upon rare and beautiful embroidery with greedy eyes, and a deplorable fashion sprang up, known in France as \"parfilage\" and in England as \"drizzling.\" This was nothing more or less than ripping up, stitch by stitch, the magnificent old hangings, quilts, and even church vestments, to secure gold and silver thread. Lady Mary Coke, writing from the Austrian Court, says: \"All the ladies who do not play cards pick gold. It is the most general fashion I ever saw, and they all carry their bags containing the necessary tools in their pockets. They even begged sword knots, epaulettes, and galons that they might add more of the precious threads to the spool on which they wound the ravelled bullion, which they sold.\" To the appreciative collector this seems wanton sacrilege.      [Illustration: TUFTED BEDSPREAD WITH KNOTTED FRINGE      A design of very remarkable beauty. Over 100 years old]      [Illustration: UNKNOWN STAR      A New England quilt about 115 years old. Colours: once     bright red and green are now old rose and dull green.     The original quilting designs are very beautiful]  John Locke, 1632-1704, a very famous man of Charles II's time, and one of the greatest philosophers and ardent champions of civil and religious rights which England ever produced, mentioned quilts in his \"Thoughts Concerning Education.\" In telling of the correct sort of beds for children he writes as follows: \"Let his Bed be hard, and rather Quilts than Feathers. Hard Lodging strengthens the Parts, whereas being buryed every Night in Feathers melts and dissolves the Body.... Besides, he that is used to hard Lodging at Home will not miss his Sleep (where he has most Need of it) in his travels Abroad for want of his soft Bed, and his Pillows laid in Order.\"  Pepys, a contemporary of Locke, in his incomparable and delicious Diary, remarks: \"Home to my poor wife, who works all day like a horse, at the making of her hanging for our chamber and bed,\" thus telling us that he was following the fashion of the day in having wall, window, and bed draperies alike. It is plain, too, by his frequent \"and so to bed,\" that his place of sleep and rest was one of comfort in his house.  A quilt depending solely upon the stitching used in quilting, whether it be of the simple running stitch, the back stitch, or the chain stitch, is not particularly ornamental. However, when viewed at close range, the effect is a shadowy design in low relief that has a distinctive but modest beauty when well done. Early in the eighteenth century a liking for this fashion prevailed, and was put to a variety of uses. Frequently there was no interlining between the right and wrong sides. At Canons Ashby there are now preserved some handsome quilted curtains of this type, belonging to Sir Alfred Dryden, Baronet.      [Illustration: COMBINATION ROSE      More than 85 years old. Colours: rose, pink, and green]      [Illustration: DOUBLE TULIP      Made in Ohio, date unknown. The tulips are made of red     calico covered with small yellow flowers. The roses have     yellow centres]  During the Middle Ages instruction in the use of the needle was considered a necessary part of the English girl's education. By the seventeenth century \"working fine works with the needle\" was considered of equal importance with singing, dancing, and French in the accomplishments of a lady of quality. In the eighteenth century much the same sentiment prevailed, and Lady Montagu is quoted as saying: \"It is as scandalous for a woman not to know how to use a needle as for a man not to know how to use a sword.\"  The _Spectator_ of that time sarcastically tells of two sisters highly educated in domestic arts who spend so much time making cushions and \"sets of hangings\" that they had never learned to read and write! A sober-minded old lady, grieved by frivolous nieces, begs the _Spectator_ \"to take the laudable mystery of embroidery into your serious consideration,\" for, says she, \"I have two nieces, who so often run gadding abroad that I do not know when to have them. Those hours which, in this age, are thrown away in dress, visits, and the like, were employed in my time in writing out receipts, or working beds, chairs, and hangings for the family. For my part I have plied the needle these fifty years, and by my good-will would never have it out of my hand. It grieves my heart to see a couple of proud, idle flirts sipping the tea for a whole afternoon in a room hung round with the industry of their great-grandmothers.\" Another old lady of the eighteenth century, Miss Hutton, proudly makes the following statement of the results of years of close application to the needle: \"I have quilted counterpanes and chest covers in fine white linen, in various patterns of my own invention. I have made patchwork beyond calculation.\"  Emblems and motifs were great favourites with the quilt workers of \"ye olden times\" and together with mottoes were worked into many pieces of embroidery. The following mottoes were copied from an old quilt made in the seventeenth century: \"Covet not to wax riche through deceit,\" \"He that has lest witte is most poore,\" \"It is better to want riches than witte,\" \"A covetous man cannot be riche.\"      [Illustration: MORNING GLORIES      In one of their many beautiful and delicate varieties     were chosen for this quilt, and while the design is     conventional to a certain extent it shows the natural     grace of the growing vine]  The needle and its products have always been held in great esteem in England, and many of the old writers refer to needlework with much respect. In 1640 John Taylor, sometimes called the \"Water Poet,\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24682"],["title","Quilts: Their Story and How to Make Them (#8)"],["body","a collection of essays, etc., called \"The Needle's Excellency,\" which was very popular in its day and ran through twelve editions. In it is a long poem entitled, \"The Prayse of the Needle.\" The following are the opening lines:      \"To all dispersed sorts of Arts and Trades     I write the needles prayse (that never fades)     So long as children shall begot and borne,     So long as garments shall be made and worne.     So long as Hemp or Flax or Sheep shall bear     Their linnen Woollen fleeces yeare by yeare;     So long as silk-worms, with exhausted spoile,     Of their own entrailes for man's game shall toyle;     Yea, till the world be quite dissolved and past,     So long at least, the Needles use shall last.\"  It is interesting to read what Elizabeth Glaister, an Englishwoman, writes of quilts in England:  \"Perhaps no piece of secular needlework gave our ancestors more satisfaction, both in the making and when made, as the quilt or bed coverlet. We have seen a good many specimens of them, both of the real quilted counterpanes, in which several thicknesses of material were stitched together into a solid covering, and the lighter silken or linen coverlets ornamented with all sorts of embroidery. Cradle quilts also were favourite pieces of needlework and figure in inventories of Henry VIII's time.  \"The real quilts were very handsome and the amount of labour bestowed on them was enormous. The seventeenth century was a great time for them, and the work of this period is generally very good. The quilting of some of them is made by sewing several strands of thick cotton between the fine linen of the surface and the lining. When one line was completed the cotton was laid down again next to it, and another line formed.  \"A sort of shell pattern was a favourite for quilting. When a sufficient space was covered with the ground pattern, flowers or other ornaments were embroidered on this excellent foundation. Perhaps the best results as a work of art were attained when both quilting and flowers were done in bright yellow silk; the effect of this colour on a white ground being always particularly good. A handsome quilt may be worked with a darned background. It is done most easily on huckaback towelling of rather loose weave, running the needle under the raised threads for the ground.      [Illustration: PRINCESS FEATHERS      Made in Indiana about 1835. Colours: soft dull green and     old rose]      [Illustration: PRINCESS FEATHERS WITH BORDER      Notice the maple leaf inserted in the border. Colours:     red and green]  \"A very effective quilt in quite a different style is made in applied work on unbleached cotton sheeting. A pattern of yellow fruit or flower with leaves is cut out in coloured serges sewn on with crewels in buttonhole stitch; stems, veins, and buds being also worked in crewels, and the ground slightly darned in dim yellow crewel. It is elaborate, but a very pleasant and repaying piece of work.  \"Many beautiful old quilts are made of silk and satin embroidered in pure silks or in gold and silver twist. Most of the best specimens are from France and Italy, where from the arrangement of the houses the beds have continued to be more _en evidence_ than has been the case in England for the last two centuries. Many also are of Indian origin; the ground of these is sometimes of fine soft silk and sometimes of thick muslin, over which the pattern is worked in silk. Others, though of Indian workmanship, show a European influence, of which the most curious are those worked at Goa, under Portuguese dominion in the seventeenth century.\"     CHAPTER IV  THE QUILT IN AMERICA   The date of the quilt's advent into America is unknown, and--because of the lack of knowledge concerning the house furnishings of the early colonists--can never be positively determined. Quilts were in such general use and were considered as such ordinary articles that the early writers about family life in the colonies neglected to mention them. We do know, however, that quilted garments, bedspreads, curtains, and the like were very essential to the comfort and well-being of the original settlers along the Atlantic seaboard.      [Illustration: PEONIES      About 75 years old. Made for exhibition at state fairs     in the Middle West. Colours: red, green, and yellow]      [Illustration: NORTH CAROLINA LILY      Over 80 years old. Flowers: red and green; the border     has green buds with red centres. The quilting designs     are remarkable for their beauty and originality]  Extensive investigation has shown that the introduction of the arts of patchwork and quilting to the American continent is due entirely to the English and the Dutch. No evidence has been found that Spanish or French colonists made use of quilting. The Spaniards in the warm lands of the South had little real need of warm clothing, and--outside of possible appliqué heraldic devices on the coats of the early explorers--may be considered as having brought to the New World none of the art so popular in Spain at the time. The French who opened up Canada brought none of the quilting or patchwork of France with them. While needlework was taught at a very early date in the convents of Quebec, it was apparently only the more fanciful kinds of embroidery. As a protection against the biting northern winters, the early French settlers sought protection under furs, which could be obtained quite readily in the great woods. To secure more bed clothing, it was very much easier to engage in a little hunting than to go through the laborious processes of piecing and quilting. To both Spanish and French, the new world was strictly a man's country--to adventure in and win riches upon which to retire to a life of ease in their native lands. With them, therefore, the inspiration of founding a home and providing it with the comforts of life was lacking; and without such inspiration the household arts could never flourish.  The English and Dutch planted their colonies along the coast from Virginia to Massachusetts with the primary object of founding new homes for themselves. With them came their wives and daughters, who brought along as their portion such household comforts and conveniences as they possessed. Under their willing hands spinning, weaving, and the manufacture of garments began immediately. Their poorly heated log houses made necessary an adequate supply of bedding and hangings for protection against the winter cold. Substantial, heavy curtains, frequently lined and quilted, were hung over both doors and windows and were kept closely drawn during the bitter winter nights. In the more imposing homes were silk damask curtains with linings of quilted silk to keep out the drafts of cold that swept through the rooms.  In Massachusetts in the early colonial days quilted garments, especially petticoats, were in general use. It is a curious circumstance that we owe this bit of information largely to the description of runaway slaves. The Boston _News Letter_ of October, 1707, contains an advertisement describing an Indian woman who ran away, clad in the best garments she could purloin from her mistress's wardrobe: \"A tall Lusty Carolina Indian Woman, named Keziah Wampun Had on a striped red, blue and white Home-spun Jacket and a Red one, a Black and quilted White Silk Crape Petticoat, a White Shift and also a blue with her, and a mixt Blue and White Linsey Woolsey Apron.\" In 1728 the _News Letter_ published an advertisement of a runaway Indian servant who, wearied by the round of domestic drudgery, adorned herself in borrowed finery and fled: \"She wore off a Narrow Stript pinck cherredary Gown turned up with a little floured red and white Callico. A Stript Home-spun quilted petticoat, a plain muslin Apron, a suit of plain Pinners and a red and white flowered knot, also a pair of green stone earrings, with white cotton stockings and leather heel'd wooden shoes.\"  A few items in a list of articles ordered from England for a New England bride, Miss Judith Sewall, who was married in 1720, give some idea of what was considered as a suitable wedding outfit during that period. The bride belonged to a rich family and no doubt had furnishings much more extensive than usual: \"A Duzen of good Black Walnut Chairs, A Duzen Cane Chairs, and a great chair for a chamber, all black Walnut. One Duzen large Pewter Plates, new fashion, a Duzen Ivory-hafted knives and forks. Four Duzen small glass salt cellars, Curtains and Vallens for a Bed with Counterpane, Head Cloth, and Tester made of good yellow watered camlet with Trimming. Send also of the same camlet and trimming as may be enough to make cushions for the chamber chairs. A good fine larger Chintz quilt, well made.\" This list also includes such items as kitchen utensils, warming pans, brass fenders, tongs, and shovels, and \"four pairs of large Brass candlesticks.\"  As the resources of the new country were developed, the women were given some respite from their spinning, weaving, and garment making. Much of their hard-won leisure was spent piecing quilts. In the rigorous climate of bleak New England there was great need of warm clothing and bedding, and the spare moments of the housekeeper were largely occupied in increasing her supply. To make the great amount of bedding necessary in the unheated sleeping rooms, every scrap and remnant of woollen material left from the manufacture of garments was saved. To supplement these, the best parts of worn-out garments were carefully cut out, and made into quilt pieces.      [Illustration: FEATHER STAR WITH APPLIQUÉ      The \"Feather Star\" pieced blocks alternate with blue and     white blocks on which are applied scroll designs. This     quilt, which is the only one of this pattern, was made     about 1835. It was designed by a Mr. Hamill for his     sweetheart, Mary Hayward]      [Illustration: TULIP TREE LEAVES      A modern quilt made by the mountaineers of South     Carolina. Colours: light"]]]
