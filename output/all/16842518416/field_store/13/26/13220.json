Each man will deposit all his weapons on the floor, and go into the room on the left, after his arms are tied behind him,\" continued Deck.  The prisoners said nothing, and obeyed the order in silence. Lieutenant Billock came first. The bugler was ordered to see that every one put all his arms on the floor, and assist him in doing so. Two men tied his arms behind him, and led him to the sitting-room. All the others followed him, and were served in the same manner. Twenty-two men were counted when the ceremony was finished. The bugler was ordered to blow the Assembly, and the whole platoon gathered in front of the mansion, which faced the east.  Lieutenant Lyon appeared to have studied up his plan, for he was ready to take the next step as soon as all the prisoners had been secured. He next formed his men in two ranks, reaching from the mansion to the fence, where the ruffians had hitched their horses, retaining the sergeant and half a dozen soldiers in the hall, where he stood himself. Then he sent half the prisoners out-doors, with their arms still secured behind them, and directed Life in what manner to mount and otherwise dispose of them.  The sergeant called ten men from the ranks to assist him, and each one of them took a ruffian in his charge. Life had Captain Coonly in his own hands. As the prisoners pointed out their own horses, they were conducted to the fence. The cord or strap was then loosened from the left wrist of each, but remained fastened to the right. They were then required to mount their steeds, which were a sorry-looking set of animals.  \"Now you are all right,\" said Life when the captain was in his seat in the saddle.  \"Why don't you take this strap from my right wrist?\" asked the prisoner.  \"Beca'se I kin make a better use on't,\" replied the sergeant, taking the strap in his hand, and making it fast to the crupper strap behind the rider.  It was drawn back far enough to prevent the prisoner from reaching it with his left hand. This was a device of Deck himself; and he had treated a prisoner in this manner once before, and it had succeeded admirably, though his man was disposed to resist. Life looked over the work the men had done, and changed some of it when necessary. Half of the cavalrymen were then sent for their horses.  They returned mounted in a few minutes, and were placed in charge of the prisoners, under Corporal Tilford. The other half of the ruffians were then mounted in the same manner, and the rest of the platoon went for their steeds in the grove; while orderly Sergeant Life formed the platoon, with the prisoners in the centre, and half a dozen soldiers on their flanks, to check the ambition of any who attempted to escape. All was ready for the march to the Millersville Road, and Deck went in to bid adieu to Mr. Halliburn and his wife.  \"I sincerely hope that you will have no more visits from such ruffians,\" said he as he took the hand of the ex-clergyman. \"I am confident this gang will not molest you again. I had my men search them as they laid down their arms, and they found a few trinkets, which I passed over to Mr. Milton.\"  \"All we had of any great value was in the treasure-chest which Grace carried away before the servants of sin entered the mansion. I am under such a load of obligation to you, Lieutenant Lyon, that I shall never be able to repay or reciprocate your kindness to us in our distress; but I thank you with all my heart, and I shall pray daily for you, that you may be saved from peril and temptation in this world, and that we may meet in the happy land beyond the grave.\"  Mrs. Halliburn expressed herself in the same terms; and the young officer hastened away, attended by Win Milton, who was going to the home of Colonel Halliburn, to assure himself of the safety of Grace Morgan.  \"What shall we do with all these guns and pistols, Lieutenant?\" asked Win, as he pointed to the pile of them in the hall.  \"Anything you like; I don't want them. I advise you to conceal them under the hay in your stable. There must be some servants about this house, though I have not seen one,\" said Deck.  \"There are about thirty of them; but they all fled at the approach of the guerillas. They will all come back now that the danger is over.\"  The lieutenant mounted his horse, and placed himself at the head of the column, with Win at his side, still acting as guide. Deck then gave the order to march. Milton conducted the platoon to the road by an open field most of the way, and the soil afforded a better footing for the horses.  \"What does all that mean, Lieutenant?\" asked Win, as they came to a little hill which gave them a view of the road for a considerable distance. \"There is a company of cavalry coming down the road at a headlong gallop!\"  \"Probably the first platoon of our company,\" replied Deck.  At the same moment Sergeant Fronklyn and Sandy Lyon rode furiously across the field, and halted in front of them, having just returned from their mission to the mansion of Colonel Halliburn.  \"Confederate cavalry!\" shouted Fronklyn, when he was a considerable distance from the column.  \"Battalion--halt!\" shouted Deck in his loudest tones.  \"It is a small platoon, and perhaps it is a part of the enemy Lieutenant Belthorpe engaged at Breedings. The men look as though they were running away from a force behind them.\"  \"How many of them are there, Fronklyn?\" asked Deck hurriedly.  \"Not more than thirty, if as many as that,\" answered the sergeant.  \"Life!\" called the lieutenant. \"Select ten men, and guard the prisoners,\" he added.  The sergeant took the men from the rear of the column, and Deck ordered the rest of the platoon to march at a gallop. The officer rode at a pace the other horses could not equal, and reached the road far in advance of his command. He wanted a few minutes to examine the situation; but the enemy were within fifty rods of him. At a glance he counted six fours, which made twenty-four men besides the officer.  By the time the lieutenant had made his momentary survey of the approaching force, his platoon reached the road, Win Milton with them. The company's baggage-train had arrived, and had halted about twenty rods to the south of the place where Fronklyn had thrown down the fence when he saw the command were coming. The wagons were guarded by ten men, who had been taken from both companies at Columbia; for Major Lyon had learned there that several counties were overrun with guerillas and foragers, the latter sent out from General Zollicoffer's Confederate force at Mill Springs.  The baggage-guard had been ordered up by Fronklyn, and they were approaching as Deck dashed into the road. If a dozen war-elephants had waddled into the road instead of Deck's command, they could hardly have created more surprise than this force of United States cavalry. The officer in command of the force promptly ordered a halt when he was within twenty rods of his enemy, for he could not help recognizing the uniform of the loyal army.  The young lieutenant had reined in his horse and come to a halt as soon as he reached the road, where he had a full view of the coming detachment. Milton joined him as the men dashed into the road, with Life, who had detailed Corporal Tilford, with the ten men, to guard the prisoners. Deck, profiting by the solemn injunctions of his father when his promotion went into effect, struggled to keep cool and self-possessed. His first impulse was to charge the approaching enemy; and he would have done so if the Confederates had not halted, and given him time to look over his surroundings.  As he took in the situation, he was perfectly satisfied that he could easily defeat the enemy, and the only fear he had was that the detachment would escape. His force was now nearly double that of the Confederates in numbers, and would be more than that if he called in the guard of his prisoners.  \"Do you know that force, Win?\" he asked as the guide rode up to him.  \"I do. They wear the blue and the gray, and they are Tennessee cavalry,\" replied Milton. \"Fronklyn was right.\"  Deck had a field-glass slung over his shoulder, and he directed it to a point beyond the enemy; for he wished to ascertain if Tom Belthorpe's platoon was in pursuit; but the road was too crooked to enable him to see any distance, for it was bordered in places by walnut forests.  \"I don't quite understand this thing,\" said Deck, musing, as he strained his vision to discover another force at the north. \"Captain Gordon was with the detachment that went to Breedings; and if he defeated the Confederates, as he must have done, I don't see how he happened to permit them to escape, for he had better horses than the men in front of us ride, and the captain and Lieutenant Belthorpe are wide-awake officers.\"  \"But both of them are strangers in these counties, while the Tennesseeans are probably well acquainted with the country. Zollicoffer has to feed his army on the supplies gathered from the region around him, and his foragers have learned the geography of this part of the State. At any rate, his officers can obtain plenty of guides,\" replied Milton; \"and this one had a better knowledge of the roads and the paths across the country.\"  Fearful that the Confederate commander would avail himself of his knowledge, and thus elude him, Deck sent Life with ten men into the field on the left, and Fronklyn with the same number into that on the right. The enemy did not seem to like this movement, though it weakened the force in front of him about one-half. The officer arranged his men so that they extended entirely across the road, and then in a voice that might have been heard half a mile, he ordered a charge.     CHAPTER VI  A SMART SKIRMISH"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24866"],["title","A Lieutenant at Eighteen (#7)"],["body","THE ROAD   The Confederate troopers set up a yell loud and fierce enough to intimidate all the old ladies in the State if they could have heard it; but the Riverlawn Cavalry had heard it before, and its effect was to kindle the wrath of the members of the platoon.  \"Unsling your carbines, Life! Unsling your carbines, Fronklyn!\" shouted Deck, as the flanking parties dashed into the two fields.  The men had fought hand to hand with the Texan Rangers; and they were roused to the highest pitch of enthusiasm when they found themselves again in front of a regular force of troopers, instead of Home Guards or guerillas. With their sabres in hand they rushed upon the foe with all the speed to which they could spur their horses. The men were fresh; for they had fought no engagement that day, and their work had been easier than the regular marching.  On the other hand, the enemy had perhaps fought with the first platoon, and had been running their horses till the animals were nearly exhausted. But they received the charge like brave men, and stood up to the work. Deck had advanced on the right of his men for the reason that the officer in command of the enemy was on the left of his troopers; for he desired to meet him. He had drawn his sabre; and possibly the remembrance of his meeting on the field with the lieutenant of the Texan Rangers had something to do with his choice of a position.  The squads in charge of Life and Fronklyn had each put in a volley from their carbines as soon as they were abreast of the Confederates, where they could fire diagonally at the enemy so as not to imperil their friends; and two of them had dropped out of their saddles, and doubtless others were wounded. Deck shouted words of encouragement to his soldiers, and almost instantly the conflict became furious. The Confederates fought like demons, and two of the loyal force were seen to drop from their saddles by the men on the flanks.  But the firing ceased as soon as both parties were mingled in the fight; for the two sergeants feared that their bullets might hit the wrong men. At this point the Confederate commander rushed upon the young lieutenant, who was ready for him, though he had not opened the duel. Both of them were skilled swordsmen, and for a minute at least they parried each other's cuts and thrusts. Life realized that his _protégé_, as he regarded him, was in imminent peril; for his antagonist was a heavier and taller man, and the longer reach of his right arm was in his favor.  Deck was hard pressed, and neither officer could even glance at his men, lest he should be caught off his guard. But Deck was still self-possessed, and perhaps the excellent advice of his father saved his life. Life Knox was not afraid of anything, but he trembled for the safety of his lieutenant. He sought a position where he could put a bullet through the brain of the brave Confederate, though he felt that it would be mean to do so. Fortunately for him the sergeant could find no such position.  Ceph, the name of Deck's noble steed, which had been abbreviated from Bucephalus, seemed to Life, whose attention was fixed upon his officer, restive and uneasy: but his rider did not bring him into a leaping posture, as he had done on a former occasion, and had been charged by his superiors with reckless daring; but the charger suddenly stood up on his hind feet, as though he intended to attempt the leap over the Confederate officer's horse on his own responsibility.  But the other steed was too tall for him, and his rider reined him in. At the moment when he was elevated above the head of his opponent, Deck seized his opportunity to deliver a blow upon the head of his foe with his sabre. It struck him on the side of the head, above the ear, cleaving his skull, and he dropped from his horse like a lump of lead. Life was happily relieved at the result of this furious conflict.  He had not been idle during the affair; for he had sent two of his men to remove the fence at the side of the road, and Fronklyn had done the same on the other side. The moment the enemy's brave leader had fallen from his horse, the sergeant ordered his men into the road, leading the way himself, and the other sergeant on the left had followed his example.  \"Squad--attention!\" shouted the orderly sergeant, after he had formed the troopers in two ranks. \"Forward--march!\"  He led the charge himself; and they delivered a volley of blows and thrusts, as occasion served them, which ended the strife in less than another moment. Several of the Confederates cried \"Quarter!\" and not another blow was struck after the word was heard.  \"Who is in command of this company now?\" asked Deck, as he and his men moved out of the tangle to the sides of the road.  \"Leftenant Logan,\" replied a wounded trooper who had a sabre-cut on the side of his face which was bleeding profusely.  \"The fall of Captain Letcher leaves me in command,\" said this officer, approaching the young lieutenant.  \"Do you surrender, Lieutenant Logan?\" asked Deck, as he surveyed the fine form and handsome face of the officer, who appeared to be not more than a year or two older than the victor.  \"I have no alternative; we are outnumbered, and surrounded by your force,\" replied the Confederate lieutenant solemnly and sadly.  \"I sympathize with you, Lieutenant, though I was compelled to do my duty,\" replied Deck; and even while he gloried in the success of his command, he was sincerely sorry for the misfortune of the officer, whom he had seen in the road fighting bravely for the cause in this particular field, which was lost from the beginning. \"But it is no disgrace or dishonor to you or your brave soldiers to be beaten by double your number.\"  \"I thank you, Lieutenant; and I only regret that we are obliged to be enemies,\" returned the officer very courteously. \"Am I at liberty to attend to my wounded now?\"  \"Certainly, sir; and I hope your loss is not so great as it appears to be at this moment,\" answered Deck.  After an action as hotly contested as this skirmish had been, it was surprising how few had been killed outright. Only two of the Riverlawns had fallen never to rise again; but six of the twenty-two Confederates who had gone into the action were past human aid. Four of the blue, and nine of gray, had been disabled by wounds more or less severe, while hardly a single man on either side had escaped without being slightly wounded.  \"Have you a surgeon in your detachment, Lieutenant Logan?\"  \"I have not. He was left with the other platoon near Breedings; but I hope you have one.\"  \"I have not. Ours is with the main body,\" replied Deck; and the Confederate officer returned to his men.  \"Who are the killed in our platoon, Life?\" said Deck, when the sergeant came to the lieutenant for further orders.  \"I don't like to say so, Leftenant; but your cousin, Orly Lyon, is one of them.\"  \"Poor fellow!\" exclaimed Deck. \"I am sorry he has finished his campaign so soon; but I am glad he did not die among the enemies of the Union.\"  \"But he fought like a hero in the action, for I was near him when he fell under the sabre of the lieutenant yonder,\" added Sergeant Sluder.  \"Who was the other man killed, Life?\" asked Deck.  \"Barron, another of the new recruits.\"  \"I am sorry to lose him, for he was a very promising soldier, though he had not been sufficiently drilled. Bury the dead in the field on the right,\" said Deck as he started for the baggage-wagons, where the wounded had been carried.  Life had detailed a burial party, and Logan had done the same for the men he had lost. Shovels and picks had been supplied to both from one of the wagons. Having attended to this duty, the orderly sergeant was sent to the field to ascertain the condition of the prisoners in charge of Corporal Tilford. They still sat upon their horses, with the right hand made fast at the crupper-strap, and doubtless were anxiously awaiting the result of the skirmish in the road.  \"How goes it, Sergeant Knox?\" asked Captain Coonly when Life came within speaking distance of him.  \"All right,\" replied the big Kentuckian.  \"Haven't the regulars of the Confederate army licked you?\"  \"Not much; but they have been licked out of their boots, with the third part of them killed or badly wounded. You have no show for gittin' out of this scrape yet.\"  Tilford reported that the prisoners had not made any trouble; for they all declared that the Riverlawns would be beaten, and they were waiting to be set at liberty. The sentinels over them guarded them very closely, and afforded them no opportunity to make a demonstration, even if they had been disposed to do so; for the soldiers with loaded carbines in their hands, and with orders to shoot any one who did not obey orders, or who attempted to escape, was a fact patent to them all. Life was satisfied with his inspection, and hastened back to the wagons.  When he reached the road, he met two well-dressed gentlemen coming out of the field on the left, from the direction of Colonel Halliburn's house. Both of them were mounted, and were provided with saddle-bags. He was a native of Kentucky, and he promptly recognized them as doctors.  \"Mornin', gentlemen,\" said he, riding towards them. \"I reckon you uns be doctors?\"  \"You are not far from right, soldier,\" replied the elder of the two.  \"Be you Secesh or Union?\" demanded Life, as though he had the right to put the question.  \"Divide the question, and each can answer for himself,\" replied the one who had spoken before. \"I am opposed to making Kentucky the battleground of this war; and if I fought on either side, it would be with the Confederates.\"  \"Be you of the same mind?\" asked Life, turning to the other.  \"I am sorry to differ from my friend, Dr. McNairy; but I am a Union man,\" answered the younger doctor, though he appeared to be at least forty years old. \"But what has happened here?\" he continued, surveying the surroundings, especially the work of the burial parties.  \"There's been a bit"]]]
