SARA WHITE LEE  THE MASSACHUSETTS REGENT  OF THE  DAUGHTERS OF THE REVOLUTION  THIS VOLUME  IS RESPECTFULLY AND CORDIALLY  DEDICATED     PREFACE   \"A LIEUTENANT AT EIGHTEEN\" is the third of the series of \"The Blue and the Gray--on Land.\" The stirring events of thirty-four years ago, when the first gun of the Great Rebellion awoke the nation from its slumber of thirteen years of peace, transformed the older boys of the day into men. Thousands of them who lacked three or four years of their majority, and some of them even six or seven years of it, flocked to the standard of the imperilled Union. While the volunteers were in considerable numbers over the military age, those who were not yet out of their teens were earnest in their desire to be enrolled in the ranks of the loyal army, and in one way or another surmounted the obstacle of their tender age.  The youth of the hero of this volume is not contrary to the facts set forth in the official records of the States; neither does his appearance in a squadron of cavalry constitute an improbability, nor his promotion from the rank of second lieutenant to that of first lieutenant, nor even his appointment on the staff of a brigadier-general. In the rosters of three regiments of cavalry, preserved in the archives of a certain State, the name of a young man of seventeen is given as a first lieutenant; two of eighteen as captains; one of the same age as first lieutenant; and three more of that age as second lieutenants. Deck Lyon's rank, therefore, is not exceptional.  Since the close of the war many high schools in the larger cities, and many other educational institutions, have taught military drill and evolutions in their regular courses; and the students have been organized as companies, battalions, and regiments, and are thus trained in actual practice as officers, from a corporal to a colonel, and as privates, for service in the field if we should again unfortunately be involved in a war with a foreign or domestic enemy.  The important battle of Mill Springs, or Logan's Cross Roads as it is indifferently called in the official reports of the government, is introduced in the story, though not in its minute details. The Riverlawn Cavalry are present, and take part in the action, and the command of the principal character renders important service on the outskirts of the battle-field; and the squadron, either as a whole or in detachments, was busily employed. The State was overrun by lawless hordes of ruffians, of which Shaler, the latest historian of the State, writes as follows:--      \"Deserters from both armies formed bands of outlaws called     guerillas. These wretches, without commanders from either army,     sheltered in the great forests that abound in nearly all parts of     the State, were often strong enough to overcome the domestic     forces, and were guilty of many outrages. They brought back to     Kentucky the evils of its struggle with the Indians. Men again     tilled their fields with their muskets by their sides, and slept in     expectation of combat. During this and the following year these     parties were hunted down, and, when captured, hanged without mercy.     Still their numbers, their daring, and their swift movements, made     the struggle as difficult and as bloody as in any year during the     last century.\"      The Riverlawn Cavalry was largely employed in operations against     these irregular bodies of marauders; and there were so many of them     that the force was kept constantly occupied. The cavalry had plenty     of exciting experience; and the hero, in command of his platoon on     detached service, proved himself to be not only a brave officer,     but a skilful strategist.      Compared with the States farther north, Kentucky had a terrible     experience in the earlier years of the war, in her desperate     struggle with Confederate and domestic enemies; and she is     certainly entitled as a Union State to greater honor and respect     for her loyalty and fidelity to the Union, and for sending so large     a number of troops as she did \"to the front,\" than any other loyal     State.

The non-commissioned officer was a tall Kentuckian, over six feet high, lank and raw-boned. He looked at the young woman, and a smile lighted up his thin face.  \"I reckon I am, Miss; I never robbed a bank, or stole a poor woman's last dollar,\" he replied, thinking it was a queer question if the lady proposed to trust him on his own recommendation.  \"Are you a Confederate soldier, for I see that you wear a uniform?\" continued the young woman, looking behind her with a timid glance.  \"I am not!\" protested Life with earnestness enough to prove that he meant all that he said. \"Don't you see that I wear the uniform of the United States army? and, Hail Columby! if I ain't a Union man from the smallest nail in the heel of my boot to the top hair on my Kentucky skull!\"  \"You won't rob me if I tell"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24866"],["title","A Lieutenant at Eighteen (#1)"],["body","the truth, will you?\" asked she very simply, and evidently agitated by painful doubts.  \"No, indeed, Missy! I wouldn't do that even if you didn't tell me the truth; not if you lied to me till you was black in the face,\" replied the sergeant warmly. \"But what difference does it make to you whether I am honest or not? I am forty-two, and I reckon you don't think of marrying me without my mother's consent.\"  \"I am very serious, sir, and I hope you will not make fun of me,\" pleaded the young woman with a deep blush on her face, as she looked behind her and listened.  \"I wouldn't say a sassy thing to you for half a Kentucky county; but you asked me a queer question. I'll do anything I kin for you. I reckon I'm an honest man; and I don't reckon you kin find anybody in my county that would say I'm not honest.\"  \"That's enough; you look like an honest man, and I believe you,\" added the fair woman, as she took from under her clothing a hard-wood box about eight inches long by four in width and depth.  From the effort it required for her to handle it, Life judged that it was quite heavy. It was bound with straps of brass, screwed to the wood; and the sight of it was enough to convince the sergeant that it contained something valuable. Her strange question seemed to be explained by this supposition.  \"What is your name, Missy?\" asked Life, becoming very sedate all at once; for, rough as his manners were, he had a kind heart, and would not trifle with the feelings of any one.  \"My name is Grace Morgan,\" replied the lady, looking behind her once more, as though she dreaded some peril in that direction.  \"Be you afeerd of sunthin', that you keep lookin' over yender?\" inquired the cavalryman in kindly tones. \"What is it? Tell me all about it.\"  \"You say you are a Union man?\" she inquired doubtfully.  \"Bet your life on't! I'm orderly sergeant of the fust company of the Riverlawn Cavalry. What's it all about?\" asked Life, very tenderly for him.  \"Stephen Halliburn, who lives about half a mile over there, is my guardian. About twenty Confederate soldiers, or guerillas, I don't know which, are plundering his house and stable, and they say they will have his money if they have to pull his house down to find it,\" answered Grace, trembling, and glancing frequently behind her, as though she were in mortal terror of the approach of the enemy.  \"Oh, ho, Grace! That's what's the matter, ain't it? We'll soon fix the gorrillas, or the soldiers, whatever they may be,\" replied Life, as he looked earnestly in the direction of the road, a few rods distant from the spot.  \"But I can't carry this chest any farther. I am worn out bringing it so far; for I have been so frightened that all the strength has gone out of me,\" said Grace, as she placed the box on a rock near her. \"I am terribly afraid that Mr. Halliburn will be killed or badly hurt; for he is a Union man, and speaks out just what he thinks.\"  \"We will do what we can for him,\" added Life, still looking in the direction of the road, and listening for sounds from the north.  \"But you are only a single man; and what can you do against twenty ruffians?\" asked the Kentucky girl, who still trembled, and did not seem to believe that the stalwart cavalryman could do anything to aid Mr. Halliburn.  \"About fifty on us,\" added Life quietly, still looking and listening. \"I'm a scout sent out ahead of half the fust company marchin' this way. I left my horse in the road, to come over this way and take a look, for I had an idee I heerd sunthin' on the left.\"  \"Perhaps you heard the ruffians who are plundering my guardian,\" replied Grace, brightening up when she learned that fifty Union soldiers were in the neighborhood. \"He is a dear good man, and I love him as though he were my father. I would not have left him if he had not insisted that I should do something with the chest, which contains all his money and papers. I can't carry it any farther, for it is very heavy.\"  \"And what were you gwine to do with it?\" inquired Life, looking into her pretty face.  \"I was going to carry it over to the house of Colonel Ben Halliburn, my guardian's brother, as he told me to do.\"  \"All right, Missy; I'll tote it over to the road, and report to the leftenant as soon as he comes up with the men,\" added Life as he picked up the treasure-chest.  It was heavy, as the young woman had said, though it was a light load for the powerful Kentuckian; and he concluded at once that it must contain a considerable amount of gold. In the distracted condition of the State very few had any confidence in the banks, and some had turned their bills into coin for any emergency that might arise. Before he reached the road he saw another scout getting over the fence.  \"Get on your hoss agin, Fronklyn!\" shouted Life, who walked with long and hurried strides, so that Grace had to run in order to keep near him.  The story of the bearer of the chest had fully aroused him by this time; and he was ready for action, whether it was in a fight, or in the service of the fair maiden, though there was hardly a fibre of sentimentalism in his composition. When he reached the road, Sergeant Fronklyn had mounted his horse, and was waiting for orders from the chief scout.  \"Ride back like a streak o' lightnin', and tell Leftenant Lyon that the gorrillas is cleanin' out a house over yender!\" said Life in hurried speech. \"How fur back is the platoon?\"  \"Not more than half a mile,\" said Fronklyn.  \"Go it, and don't let the grass grow under your hoss's irons!\"  The other scout went off at the fastest gallop of his steed, and soon disappeared beyond a turn in the road. The Riverlawn Cavalry had been enlisted, drilled, and mustered into the loyal army at the plantation of Noah Lyon, who had inherited the property under the will of his elder brother. The raising of hemp and horses had made the deceased brother, Colonel Duncan Lyon, a rich man, as worldly possessions were gauged in this locality. His property had been fairly divided among his heirs. The plantation had been given to his younger brother, greatly to the dissatisfaction of the elder one.  Titus Lyon, the other surviving brother, was an entirely different kind of man from Noah, as the original owner of Riverlawn was well aware when he gave the place to his younger brother. All of them had come from New Hampshire, the colonel in his early manhood, and Titus a few years before Noah. The latter was a man of character, with lofty principles, while his living brother was far from being a high-toned person. He had always been what is called \"a moderate drinker,\" and his politics had always been the opposite of Noah's in the North.  Titus believed that he ought to have been born a rich man. He was a mason by trade, and had gone to Kentucky to establish himself in this business. For a time he did very well. He fawned upon and tried to flatter his brother; but he drank more whiskey than ever. When the colonel's health began to fail him, he looked forward to the possession of Riverlawn. When it went to Noah he was mortally offended, and an unhappy feud grew into being, though it was altogether on the side of Titus.  The dissatisfied brother, apparently as much to spite Noah, who was an enthusiastic Union man, cast in his lot with the Secessionists. With the money he had received from his deceased brother's estate he became a leader among them. They were bullies and ruffians for the most part, operating at first in the interests of neutrality, the governor's favorite scheme, and in the end falling very naturally into the ranks of the enemies of the Union. Titus raised a company of Home Guards, in which thousands of the citizens of the State were organized, some on one and some on the other side of the question.  Titus was ambitious, and he was chosen captain of his company. He displayed more energy and activity than he had ever manifested in his business, and spent his money recklessly in fitting out and arming his recruits. He purchased a considerable quantity of muskets, cannon, and revolvers, with the ammunition for them. He concealed these military supplies in a \"sink,\" or cave, till he could organize his command. One of Noah's sons discovered them while exploring the creek that flowed by Riverlawn.  When the discovery was reported to his father, Major Lyon, as he was courteously called before he was entitled to this handle to his name, immediately decided that his duty to his country required him to take possession of the arms and munitions. They were all removed to a building prepared for their reception at Riverlawn. Captain Titus knew, or suspected, that his brother had taken the military supplies, and his wrath knew no bounds. When the Union men held a meeting in a schoolhouse the smouldering fire was fanned into a blaze. The ruffians, led on by their captain, marched upon Riverlawn, proposing to burn the mansion and hang its owner to a tree on the lawn, though Titus denied that he had any such intention, and declared that he had prevented his followers from committing this outrage.  Major Lyon had heard of the threats against him and his property, and he was prepared for the marauders. With the aid of his neighbors, and arming his negroes, he fought the \"Battle of Riverlawn,\" defeating and dispersing the ruffians. Then, as arranged at the Union meeting, he proceeded to raise a company of cavalry. The enthusiasm among the loyal people was immense, and two companies were enlisted and mustered in. Against his wishes he was chosen major of the battalion.  Levi Bedford was his overseer. He was a Tennessee Unionist in whom the planter had unbounded confidence. When the major left his home in command of the squadron of two companies, Levi took charge of his family and estate. This family consisted of a daughter Hope, and a son Dexter, now a lieutenant at eighteen. Noah had brought up in his family from their early childhood the children of a brother who died penniless in Vermont. Artemas, always called "]]]
