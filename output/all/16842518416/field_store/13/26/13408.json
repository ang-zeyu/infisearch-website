He shut his lamp off after a last look at his switch, his revolver, and the glistening walls and mud-ooze floor of his tunnel, and sat still in the darkness.  Once he whispered an answer into the telephone to his Corporal, and once he flicked his lamp on an instant to glance at the watch on his wrist.  Then he crouched still and silent again.  The thumping of his heart nearly drowned the thud of the picks, he was shivering with excitement, and his mouth grew dry and leathery.  He felt a desire to smoke, and had his case out and a cigarette in his lips when it occurred to him that, when the Germans broke through, the smell of the smoke would tell them instantly that they were in an occupied working.  He counted on a certain amount of delay and doubt on their part when their picks first pierced his wall, and he counted on that pause again to give him time to escape.  So he put the cigarette away, and immediately was overwhelmed with a craving for it.  He fought it for five minutes that felt like five hours, and felt his desire grow tenfold with each minute.  It nearly drove him to doing what all the risk, all the discomfort of his cramped position, all the danger, had not done--to creep out and fire the mine without waiting for that last instant when the picks would break through.  It could make little difference, he argued to himself, in the movements of those above.  What could five minutes more, or ten, or even fifteen, matter now?  It might even be that he was endangering the success of the explosion by waiting, and it was perhaps wiser to crawl out at once and fire the mine--and he could safely light a cigarette then as soon as he was round the corner of the T.  So he argued the matter out, fingering his cigarette-case and longing for the taste of the tobacco, and yet knowing in his inmost heart that he would not move, despite his arguments, until the first pick came through.  He heard the strokes draw nearer and nearer, and now he held his breath and strained his eyes as each one was delivered.  The instant he had waited for came in exactly the fashion he had expected--a thud, a thread of yellow light piercing the black dark, a grunt of surprise from the pick-wielder at the lack of resistance to his stroke.  All this was just what he had expected, had known would happen.  The next stroke would show the digger that he was entering some hole.  Then there would be cautious investigation, the sending back word to an officer, the slow and careful enlargement of the opening.  And before that moment came the Subaltern would be down his tunnel, and outside, and pressing the switch . . .  But his programme worked out no further than that first instant and that first gleam of light.  He saw the gleam widen suddenly as the pick was withdrawn, heard another quick blow, saw the round spot of light run out in little cracks and one wide rift, and suddenly the wall fell in, and he was staring straight into the German gallery, with a dark figure silhouetted clear down to the waist against the light of an electric bulb-lamp which hung from the gallery roof.  For an instant the Subaltern's blood froze.  The figure of the German was only separated from him by a bare three yards, and to his dark-blinded eyes it seemed that he himself was standing in plain view in a brilliant blaze of light.  Actually he was in almost complete darkness.  The single light in the German gallery hardly penetrated through the gloom of his own tunnel, and what little did showed nothing to the eyes of the German, used to the lamp-light and staring suddenly into the black rift before him.  But the German called out to some one behind him, twisted round, moved, stooping, back to the lamp and reached up a hand to it.  The Subaltern backed away hastily, his eyes fixed on the glow of light in the opening.  The hole had broken through on a curve of his tunnel, so that for fifteen or twenty feet back he could still see down the German gallery, could watch the man unhook the lamp and carry it back to the opening, thrust the lamp before him and lean in over the crumbling heap of earth his pick had brought down.  The Subaltern stopped and drew a gasping breath and held it.  Discovery was a matter of seconds now.  He had left his firing switch, but he still carried the portable telephone slung from his shoulder, the earth-pin dangling from it.  He had only to thrust the pin into the mud and he was connected up with the Corporal at the outside switch, had only to shout one word, 'Fire!'--and it would all be over.  Quickly but noiselessly he put his hand down to catch up the wire with the earth-pin.  His hand touched the revolver-butt in his holster, checked at it, closed round it and slid it softly out.  All this had taken an instant of time, and as he raised his weapon he saw the German still staring hard under the upheld lamp into the gloom.  He was looking the other way, and the Subaltern levelled the heavy revolver and paused.  The sights stood out clear and black against the figure standing in the glow of light--a perfect and unmissable target.  The man was bareheaded, and wore a mud-stained blue shirt with sleeves cut off above the elbow.  The Subaltern moved the notched sights from under the armpit of the raised arm that held up the light, and steadied them on the round of the ear that stood out clear against the close-cropped black hair.  He heard a guttural exclamation of wonder, saw the head come slowly round until the circle of the ear foreshortened and moved past his sights, and they were centred straight between the staring eyes.  His finger contracted on the trigger, but a sudden qualm stayed him.  It wasn't fair, it wasn't sporting, it was too like shooting a sitting hare.  And the man hadn't seen him even yet.  Man?  This was no man; a lad rather, a youth, a mere boy, with childish wondering eyes, a smooth oval chin, the mouth of a pretty girl.  The Subaltern had a school-boy brother hardly younger than this boy; and a quick vision rose of a German mother and sisters--no, he couldn't shoot; it would be murder; it--and then a quick start, an upward movement of the lamp, a sharp question, told him the boy had seen.  The Subaltern spoke softly in fairly good German.  'Run away, my boy.  In an instant my mine will explode.'  'Who is it?  Who is there?' gasped the boy.  The Subaltern chuckled, and grinned wickedly.  Swiftly he dropped the revolver, fumbled a moment, and pulled a coil of capped fuse from his pocket.  'It is the English,' he said.  'It is an English mine that I now explode,' and, on the word, lit the fuse and flung it, fizzing and spitting a jet of sparks and smoke, towards the boy.  The lad flinched back and half turned to run, but the Subaltern saw him look round over his shoulder and twist back, saw the eyes glaring at the fiery thing in the mud, the dreadful resolve grow swiftly on the set young face, the teeth clamped on the resolve.  He was going to dash for the fuse, to try to wrench it out and, as he supposed, prevent the mine exploding. The Subaltern jerked up the revolver again.  This would never do; the precious seconds were flying; at any moment another man might come.  He would have saved this youngster if he could, but he could allow nothing to risk failure for his mine.  'Get back,' he said sharply.  'Get back quickly, or I shall shoot.'  But now what he had feared happened.  A voice called, a scuffling footfall sounded in the German gallery, a dim figure pushed forward into the light beside the boy.  The Subaltern saw that it was an officer, heard his angry oath in answer to the boy's quick words, his shout, 'The light, fool--break it'; saw the clenched fist's vicious buffet in the boyish face and the quick grab at the electric bulb.  The Subaltern's revolver sights slid off the boy and hung an instant on the snarling face of the officer. . . .  In the confined space the roar of his heavy revolver rolled and thundered in reverberating echoes, the swirling powder-reek blinded him and stung in his nostrils; and as the smoke cleared he could see the boy scrambling back along his gallery and the officer sprawled face down across the earth-heap in the light of the fallen lamp.  The Subaltern smashed the lamp himself before he too turned and plunged, floundering and slipping and stumbling, for his exit in an agony of haste and apprehension.  It was all right, he told himself a dozen times; the officer was done for--the back of that head and a past knowledge of a service revolver's work at close range told him that plain enough; it would take a good many minutes for the boy to tell his tale, and even then, if a party ventured back at once, it would take many more minutes in the dark--and he was glad he thought to smash the lamp--before they could find his charges or the wires.  It was safe enough, but--the tunnel had never seemed so long or the going so slow. He banged against beams and supports, ploughed through sticky mud and churning water, rasped his knuckles, and bruised knees and elbows in his mad haste.  It was safe enough, but--but--but--suppose there was no response to his pressure on the switch; suppose there had been some silly mistake in making the connections; suppose the battery wouldn't work.  There were a score of things to go wrong.  Thank goodness he had overhauled and examined everything himself; although that again would only make it more appallingly awful if things didn't work.  No time now, no chance to go back and put things right.  Perhaps he ought to have stayed back there and made the contact.  A quick end if it worked right, and a last chance to refix it if it didn't; yes, he . . . but here was the light ahead.  He shouted 'Fire!' at the top of his voice, still hurrying on and half cowering from the expected roar and shock of the explosion.  Nothing happened.  He shouted again and again as loud as his sobbing breath"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25076"],["title","Between the Lines (#7)"],["body","labouring lungs would let him. Still--nothing; and it began to sear his brain as a dreadful certainty that he had failed, that his mine was a ghastly frost, that all the labour gone to its making and the good lives spent on it were wasted. He stumbled weakly out into the shaft, caught a glimpse of the Corporal's set face staring at the tunnel mouth, and tried once more to call out 'Fire!' But the Corporal was waiting for no word.  He had already got that, had heard the Subaltern's first shouts roll down the tunnel, in fact was waiting with a finger on the exploding switch for the moment the Subaltern should appear.  The finger moved steadily over as the Subaltern stumbled into sight--and the solid earth heaved convulsively, shuddered, and rocked and shook to the roaring blast of the explosion.  The shock and the rush of air from the tunnel-mouth caught the Subaltern, staggering to his knees, and flung him headlong.  And as he picked himself up again the air darkened with whizzing clods and mud and dust and stones and dirt that rained down from the sky.  Before the echoes of the explosion had died away, before the last fragments and debris had fallen, there came the sound of another roar, the bellowing thunder of the British guns throwing a storm of shell and shrapnel between the German supports and the ruined trench.  That, and another sound, told the Subaltern that the full fruits of his work were to be fully reaped--the sound of the guns and of the full, deep-chested, roaring cheers of the British infantry as they swarmed from their trenches and rushed to occupy the crater of the explosion.        *      *      *      *      *  Later in the day, when the infantry had made good their possession of the place, had sandbagged and fortified it to stand against the expected counter-attacks, the Subaltern went to look over the ground and see at first and close hand the results of his explosion. Technically, he found it interesting; humanly, it was merely sickening. The ground was one weltering chaos and confusion of tossed earth-heaps and holes, of broken beams and jagged-ended planks, of flung sandbags and wrecked barricading.  Of trench or barricade, as trench and barricade, there remained, simply, no sign.  The wreckage was scattered thick with a dreadful debris of dead bodies, of bloody clothing, of helmets and broken rifles, burst packs and haversacks, bayonets, water-bottles, and shattered equipments.  The Ambulance men were busy, but there were still many dead and dying and wounded to be removed, wounded with torn flesh and mangled limbs, dead and dying with scorched and smouldering clothes.  The infantry, hastily digging and filling sandbags and throwing up parapets on the far edge of the reeking explosion pit, had found many bodies caught in the descending avalanche of earth or buried in the collapsed trenches and dug-outs; and here and there, amid the confusion, a foot or a hand protruding stark from some earth-heap marked the death-place of other victims.  The whole scene was one of death and desolation, of ruin and destruction, and the Subaltern turned from it sick at stomach.  It was the first result of a big explosion he had seen.  This was the sort of thing that he had read so often summed up in a line of the Official Despatch or a two-line newspaper paragraph: 'A mine was successfully exploded under a section of the enemy's trench.'  A mine--_his_ mine. . . . 'God!' the Subaltern said softly under his breath, and looked wonderingly about him.  ''E's a bloomin' little butcher, is that Lefftenant of ours,' the Corporal said that night.  ''Course it was a good bit o' work, an' he'd reason to be proud of it; but--well I thought I'd a strongish stomach, an' I've seen some dirty blood-an'-bones messes in my time but that scorchin' shambles near turned me over.  An' he comes back, after lookin' at it, as cheerful as the cornerman o' a Christie Minstrel troupe, an' as pleased as a dog wi' two tails.  Fair pleased, 'e was.'  But he was a little wrong.  What had brought the Subaltern back with such a cheerful air was not the sight of his work, not the grim picture of the smashed trenches.  It was an encounter he had had with a little group of German prisoners, the recognising amongst them of a dirty, mud-stained blue shirt with sleeves cut off above the elbows, a close-cropped bare head, a boy's face with smooth oval chin and girlish eyes.  The mine work he had directed, but others had shared it.  It was the day's work--it was an incident of war--it was, after all, merely 'a mine successfully exploded . . .'  But that one life saved was also his work, and, moreover, his own, his individual personal work.  It was of that he thought most as he came back smiling to his Corporal.     ARTILLERY SUPPORT  '_. . . supported by a close and accurate artillery fire . . ._'--EXTRACT FROM OFFICIAL DESPATCH.   From his position in the 'Observation Post' the Artillery Forward Officer watched the fight raging along his front much as a spectator in the grand-stand watches a football match.  Through his glasses he could see every detail and movement of the fighters, see even their facial expressions, the grip of hands about their weapons.  Queerly enough, it was something like looking at the dumb show of a cinema film.  He could see a rifle pointed and the spit of flame from the muzzle without hearing any report, could see an officer gesticulating and his mouth opening and closing in obvious stentorian shoutings without hearing the faintest sound of his voice, could even see the quick flash and puffing smoke of a grenade without catching the crash of its explosion.  It was not that he was too far off to hear all these sounds, but simply because individually they were drowned in the continuous ear-filling roar of the battle.  The struggle was keenly interesting and desperately exciting, even from a spectator's point of view; and the interest and excitement were the greater to the Forward Officer, because he was playing a part, and an important part, in the great game spread before him.  Beyond the line of a section of the British front white smoke-puffs were constantly bursting, over his head a succession of shells streamed rushing and shrieking; and the place where each of those puffs burst depended on him, each shell that roared overhead came in answer to his call.  He was 'observing' for a six-gun battery concealed behind a gentle slope over a mile away to his right rear, and, since the gunners at the battery could see nothing of the fight, nothing of their target, not even the burst of a single one of their shells, they depended solely on their Forward Officer to correct their aim and direct their fire.  All along the front--or rather both the fronts, for the German batteries worked on exactly the same system--the batteries were pouring down their shells, and each battery was dependent for the accuracy of its fire on its own Observing Officer crouching somewhere up in front and overlooking his battery's 'zone.'  The fighting line surged forward or swayed back, checked and halted, moved again, now rapidly, now slowly and staggeringly, curved forward here and dinted in there, striving fiercely to hold its ground in this place, driving forward in that, or breaking, reeling back into the arms of the supports, swirling forward with them again.  But no matter whether the lines moved forward or back, fast or slow, raggedly and unevenly, or in one long close-locked line, ever and always the shells soared over and burst beyond the line, just far enough barely to clear it if the fight were at close quarters; reaching out and on a hundred, two hundred, yards when the fighters drew apart for a moment; always clear of their own infantry, and as exactly as possible on the fighting line of the enemy, for such is the essence of 'close and accurate artillery support.'  The Forward Observing Officer, perched precariously in an angle of the walls of a ruined cottage, stared through his glasses at the confusion of the fight for hour after hour until his eyes ached and his vision swam.  The Forward Officer had been there since daybreak, and because no shells obviously aimed at his station had bombarded him--plenty of chance ones had come very close, but of course they didn't count--he was satisfied that he was reasonably secure, and told his Major back at the Battery so over his telephone.  The succession of attack and counter-attack had ceased for the time being, and the Forward Officer let his glasses drop and shut his aching eyes for a moment.  But, almost immediately, he had to open them and lift his head carefully, to peer out over the top of the broken wall; for the sudden crash of reopening rifle fire warned him that another move was coming.  From far out on his left, beyond the range of his vision, the fire began.  It beat down, wave upon wave, towards his front, crossed it, and went rolling on beyond his right.  The initiative came from the British side, and, taking it as the prelude of an attack, developing perhaps out of sight on his left, the Forward Officer called up his Battery and quickened the rate of its fire upon the German line.  In a few minutes he caught a quick stir in the British line, a glimpse of the row of khaki figures clambering from their trench and the flickering flash of their bayonets--and in an instant the flat ground beyond the trench was covered with running figures.  They made a fair target that the German gunners, rifles, and maxims were quick to leap upon.  The German trench streamed fire, the German shells--shrapnel and high-explosive--blew gaping rents in the running line.  The line staggered and flinched, halted, recovered, and went on again, leaving the ground behind it dotted with sprawling figures.  The space covered by the Forward Officer's zone was flat and bare of cover clear to the German trench two hundred yards away.  It was too deadly a stretch for that gallant line to cover; and before it "]]]
