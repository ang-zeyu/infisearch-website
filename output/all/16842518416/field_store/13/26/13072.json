Our object is nothing more henceforward, than to increase the prosperity of France by the confirmation of public liberty; whence results the necessity of several important modifications of the constitution, the decrees of the senate, and other acts, by which this empire is governed.  For these reasons, willing, on the one hand, to retain whatever is good and salutary of the past, and on the other to render the constitution of our empire conformable in every respect to the wishes and wants of the nation, as well as to that state of peace, which we are desirous of maintaining with Europe, we have resolved, to propose to the people a series of arrangements, tending to modify and improve its acts, to surround the rights of citizens with all their guarantees, to give to the representative system its full extent, to invest the intermediate bodies with the respectability and powers that are desirable; in a word, to combine the highest degree of political liberty, and personal security, with the strength and concentration necessary, to render the independence of the French people, and the dignity of our crown, respected by foreigners: in consequence, the following articles, forming an act supplementary to the constitution of the empire, will be submitted to the free and solemn acceptance of all the citizens, throughout the whole extent of France[5].                [Footnote 5: This preamble, which gave the death-blow to               the additional act, was, I believe, the work of M.               Benjamin Constant.]   HEAD I.  _General provisions._  ART. 1. The constitution of the empire, consisting of the constitutional act of the 22d of Frimaire, year 8; of the decrees of the senate of the 14th and 16th of Thermidor, year 10; and of that of the 28th of Floreal, year 12; will be modified by the provisions following: all the rest of their provisions are maintained and confirmed.  ART. 2. The legislative power is exercised by the Emperor and by two chambers.  ART. 3. The first chamber, styled the chamber of peers, is hereditary.  ART. 4. The Emperor names its members, who are irremovable, they and their male descendants, from eldest to eldest, in direct descent. The number of peers is unlimited. Adoption does not transmit the dignity of the peerage to the person adopted. The peers take their seats at the age of twenty-one; but have no deliberative voice before the age of twenty-five.  ART. 5. The chamber of peers has for its president the archchancellor of the empire, or, in the case provided for by article 5 of the decree of the senate of the 28th of Floreal, year 12, by one of the members of the chamber appointed by the Emperor.  ART. 6. The members of the imperial family, in hereditary succession, are peers by right. They are seated next to the president. They take their seats at the age of eighteen, but have no deliberative voice before the age of twenty-one.  ART. 7. The second chamber, styled the chamber of representatives, is elected by the people.  ART. 8. The members of this chamber are to the number of six hundred and twenty-nine: they must be twenty-five years of age at least.  ART. 9. The president of the chamber of representatives is appointed by the chamber at the opening of the session. He remains in office, till the chamber is renewed. His appointment is submitted to the approbation of the Emperor.  ART. 10. The chamber of representatives verifies the powers of its members, and decides on the validity of contested elections.  ART. 11. The members of the chamber of representatives receive for travelling expenses, and during the session, the indemnity decreed by the constituent assembly.  ART. 12. They are re-eligible without limit.  ART. 13. The chamber of representatives is entirely renewed, of right, every five years.  ART. 14. No member of either chamber can be arrested, except in case of being taken in the fact of committing a crime; or prosecuted for a criminal or correctional cause, during the sessions, except in consequence of a resolution of the chamber to which he belongs.  ART. 15. No one can be arrested or detained for debt, from the time of convening the meeting till forty days after the session.  ART. 16. The peers are to be tried by their own chamber in criminal or correctional cases, according to the forms prescribed by the law.  ART. 17. The quality of peer and of representative is compatible with all public functions, except those that are responsible (_comptables_).  All prefects and subprefects are not eligible by the electoral college of the department or circle (_arrondissement_), for which they are serving.  ART. 18. The Emperor sends to the chambers the ministers of state, and counsellors of state, who sit, and take a part in the discussions, but have no deliberative voice, unless they are members of the chamber, either as peers or being elected by the people.  ART. 19. The ministers, who are members of the chamber of peers, or of that of representatives, or who sit in consequence of being sent by the government, will give the chambers the information deemed necessary, when making it public does not compromise the interests of the state.  ART. 20. The sittings of both chambers are public. Nevertheless, they may resolve themselves into secret committees; the chamber of peers on the demand of ten members, that of deputies on the demand of twenty-five. The government also may demand secret committees for any communications it may have to make. In all cases deliberations and votes can take place only in a public sitting.  ART. 21. The Emperor may prorogue, adjourn, or dissolve, the chamber of representatives. The proclamation, that pronounces the dissolution, convokes the electoral colleges for a new election, and indicates the re-assembling of representatives in six months at the latest.  ART. 22. During the interval between the sessions of the chamber of representatives, or in case of the dissolution of this chamber, the chamber of peers cannot assemble.  ART. 23. The government has the proposal of the law: the chambers may propose amendments: if these amendments be not adopted by the government, the chambers are bound to vote for or against the law, in the form in which it was proposed.  ART. 24. The chambers have the power of inviting the government to propose a law on a given subject, and to draw up what appears to them proper to be inserted in the law. This demand may be made by either of the two chambers.  ART. 25. When a draught of a law is adopted by one of the two chambers, it is carried to the other; and, if it be approved there, it is carried to the Emperor.  ART. 26. No written discourse, except the reports of committees, the reports of ministers on the laws that are presented, and the accounts that are delivered, can be read in either of the chambers.   HEAD II.  _Of the electoral colleges, and the mode of election._  ART. 27. The electoral colleges of the departments and circles are retained, conformably to the decree of the senate of the 16th of Thermidor, year 10, excepting the following modifications.  ART. 28. The district assemblies (_les assemblées de canton_) will fill up every year, by annual elections, all the vacancies in the electoral colleges.  ART. 29. From the year 1816, a member of the chamber of peers, appointed by the Emperor, will be president of the electoral college of each department for life, and not removable.  ART. 30. Dating from the same period, the electoral college of each department will appoint, from among the members of the college of each circle, the president and two vice-presidents: for this purpose the assembling of the electoral college of the department will precede that of the college of the circle fifteen days.  ART. 31. The colleges of departments and circles will appoint the number of representatives established for each by the annexed table and act, No. 1.[6]                [Footnote 6: This table, and that mentioned in Art. 33,               being of no importance, are not inserted here.]  ART. 32. The representatives may be chosen throughout the whole extent of France indifferently.  Every college of a department or circle, that shall choose a member not belonging to the department or circle, shall appoint a substitute (_suppléant_), who must necessarily be taken from the department or circle.  ART. 33. Manufacturing and commercial labour and property shall have a particular representation.  The election of commercial and manufacturing representatives shall be made by the electoral college of the department from a list of eligible persons, drawn up by the chambers of commerce and consulting chambers in conjunction, according to the annexed table and act, No. 2.   HEAD III.  _Of the law of taxation._  ART. 34. Direct general taxes, whether on land or personal property, are voted only for one year: indirect taxes may be voted for several years. In case of a dissolution of the chamber of representatives, the taxes voted in the preceding session are continued, till the chamber meets anew.  ART. 35. No tax, direct or indirect, in money or in kind, can be levied; no loan can take place; no entry of credit in the great book of the public debt can be made; no domain can be alienated or exchanged; no raising of men for the army can be ordered; no portion of territory can be exchanged; except by virtue of a law.  ART. 36. No proposal of a tax, of a loan, or of a levy of men, can be made, except in the chamber of representatives.  ART. 37. It is in the chamber of representatives also, that, 1st, the general budget of the state, containing an estimate of the receipts, and the proposal of the funds assigned for the year to each department of the ministry; and, 2dly, an account of the receipts and expenses of the year, or years, preceding; are to be introduced in the first instance.   HEAD IV.  _Of ministers and their responsibility._  ART. 38. All the acts of the government must be"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24718"],["title","Memoirs of the Private Life, Return, and Reign of Napoleon in 1815, Vol. II (#7)"],["body","by a minister having some department.  ART. 39. The ministers are responsible for the acts of government signed by them, as well as for the execution of the laws.  ART. 40. They may be accused by the chamber of representatives, and are to be tried by that of peers.  ART. 41. Every minister, every commander of an army by land or sea, may be accused by the chamber of representatives, and tried by the chamber of peers, for having compromised the safety or honour of the nation.  ART. 42. In this case the chamber of peers exercises a discretionary power, both in assigning the character of the crime, and in the punishment to be inflicted.  ART. 43. Before it is decided, that a minister shall be put upon his trial, the chamber of representatives must declare, that there are grounds for examining into the charge brought against him.  ART. 44. This declaration can be made only on the report of a committee of sixty members drawn by lot. This committee cannot make its report till at least ten days after its nomination.  ART. 45. When the chamber has declared, that there are grounds for examination, it may summon the minister before it, to demand an explanation of him. This summons cannot take place, till ten days after the committee has made its report.  ART. 46. In all other cases, ministers having departments cannot be summoned or sent for by the chambers.  ART. 47. When the chamber of representatives has declared, that there are grounds for examination against a minister, a new committee is to be formed, of sixty members, drawn by lot as the former; and this committee makes a fresh report on the subject of bringing him to trial. This committee does not make its report till ten days after its nomination.  ART. 48. The bringing to trial cannot be decided upon, till ten days after the report has been read, and distributed among the members.  ART. 49. The accusation being resolved upon, the chamber of representatives names five commissioners, chosen from among its own members, to conduct the charge before the chamber of peers.  ART. 50. Article 75 of head 8 of the constitutional act of the 22d of Frimaire, year 8, declaring, that the agents of the government can be prosecuted only in consequence of a decision of the council of state, shall be modified by a law.   HEAD V.  _Of the judicial power._  ART. 51. The Emperor appoints all the judges. They are for life, and irremovable, from the instant of their appointment; the nomination of judges of the peace, and of commerce, excepted, which will take place as heretofore.  The present judges, appointed by the Emperor agreeably to the decree of the senate of the 12th of October, 1807, and whom he may think proper to retain, will receive appointments for life before the 1st of January next.  ART. 52. The institution of juries is retained.  ART. 53. The debating of criminal causes is to be public.  ART. 54. Military crimes alone are amenable to military tribunals.  ART. 55. All other crimes, even if committed by military men, are under the jurisdiction of the civil tribunals.  ART. 56. All crimes and offences, that were amenable to the high imperial court, and the trial of which is not reserved by the present act for the chamber of peers, are to be carried before the ordinary tribunals.  ART. 57. The Emperor has the right of pardoning, even in correctional cases, and of granting amnesties.  ART. 58. The interpretations of laws demanded by the court of cassation shall be given in the form of a law.   HEAD VI.  _Rights of citizens._  ART. 59. Frenchmen are equal in the eye of the law, both in contributing to the taxes and public expenses, and in regard to admission to employments civil or military.  ART. 60. No one can be taken out of the hands of the judges assigned him by the law, on any pretence.  ART. 61. No one can be prosecuted, arrested, detained in custody, or banished, except in cases provided for by the law, and according to the forms prescribed.  ART. 62. Freedom in religious worship is guarantied to all.  ART. 63. All property possessed or acquired agreeably to the laws, and all debts of the state, are inviolable.  ART. 64. Every citizen has a right to print and publish his opinions, he signing them, without any previous censorship; saving that he is legally responsible, after publication, to be tried by a jury, even though the application of a correctional punishment only should be requisite.  ART. 65. The right of petition is secured to all the citizens. Every petition is that of an individual (_est individuelle_). These petitions may be addressed, either to the government, or to the two chambers; nevertheless, even the latter must be superscribed \"to his Majesty the Emperor.\" They must be presented to the chambers under the guarantee of a member, who recommends the petition. They are read publicly; and, if the chamber take them into consideration, they are carried to the Emperor by the president.  ART. 66. No place, no part of the territory, can be declared in a state of siege, except in case of invasion by a foreign power, or of civil disturbance.  In the former case, the declaration is made by an act of the government.  In the second case, it can be made only by the law. However, if the case occur, when the chambers are not assembled, the act of government, declaring the state of siege, must be converted into a proposal for a law in the first fifteen days after the meeting of the chambers.  ART. 67. The French people declare farther, that, in the delegation it has made, and now makes, of its powers, it has not intended, and does not intend, to confer the right of proposing the re-establishment of the Bourbons, or of any prince belonging to that family, on the throne, even in case of the extinction of the imperial dynasty; or the right of re-establishing either the ancient feudal nobility, or feudal and seigniorial rights, or tithes, or any privileged and predominant form of worship; or the power of making any infringement of the irrevocability of the sale of national domains: it formally prohibits the government, the chambers, and the citizens, from every proposal in respect to these.  Done at Paris, the 22d of April, 1815.                           (_Signed_)          NAPOLEON.                                 By the Emperor,                           _The minister secretary of state,_                          (_Signed_)  The Duke of BASSANO.         *       *       *       *       *  This additional act did not answer the general expectation.  The public had hoped, to receive from Napoleon a new constitution, freed from the faults and abuses of the preceding constitutions; and it was surprised, grieved, dissatisfied, when it saw, by the very preamble of the additional act, that it was nothing but a _modification_ of the former constitutions, decrees of the senate, and other acts, by which the empire was governed.  What confidence, people cried, can such a production inspire? What guarantee can it afford the nation? Do we not know, that it was by means of these decrees of the senate, that Napoleon sported with our most sacred laws? and, since they are now maintained and confirmed, may he not employ them, as he formerly did, to interpret after his own fashion his additional act, alter its nature, and render it illusory?  It had been to be wished, undoubtedly, that the additional act had not revived the name, and borrowed the assistance, of all the senatorial acts, become on so many accounts objects of the public contempt and derision: but this was impossible[7]. They were the basis of our institutions; and they could not have been proscribed in a body, without arresting the progress of government, and subverting the established order of things from top to bottom.                [Footnote 7: Notwithstanding the charter, and the laws               daily passed, it is found necessary, to recur every day               to rules established by the ancient legislation of the               senate.]  Besides, the fear of Napoleon's putting them in vigour was founded only on vague suppositions. The oppressive arrangements of the decrees of the senate were annulled, both in fact and in law, by the principles, which the additional act sanctioned: and Napoleon had rendered it impossible for him to augment his authority, or to abuse it, by the immense power, with which he had invested the chambers, the responsibility he had thrown on his agents and ministers, and the inviolable guarantees he had conferred on freedom of opinion and personal liberty. The slightest attempt would have betrayed his secret intentions; and a thousand voices would have been raised, to say to him: \"We, who are as good as you, have made you our King, on condition, that you keep our laws: if not, not[8].\"                [Footnote 8: The well-known words, in which the cortes               of Arragon address the kings of Spain at their               coronation.]  The re-establishment of the chamber of peers, imported from England by the Bourbons, excited no less vividly the public discontent.  It was clear, in fact, that the privileges, and peculiar jurisdiction, which the peers exclusively enjoyed, constituted a manifest violation of the laws of equality; and that the hereditary state of the peerage was a formal infraction of the right of all Frenchmen, to be equally admissible to the offices of the state.  Accordingly the friends of liberty and equality with reason reproached Napoleon for having falsified his promises; and given them, instead of a constitution bottomed on the principles of equality and liberty, which he had solemnly professed, a shapeless act, more favourable than the charter, or any of the preceding constitutions, to the nobility and their institutions.  But Napoleon, when he promised the French a constitution, that might be termed _republican_, had rather followed the political suggestions of the moment, than consulted the welfare of France.
