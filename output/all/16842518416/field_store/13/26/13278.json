He brought a chair forward for her, dusted it carefully, and she sat down by the table, leaning her chin on her palm, and looking at the old man.  \"I could not come before,\" she said. \"It was so difficult to get away.\"  \"Your Highness received my letter?\"  She nodded.  \"But Israel,\" her voice almost pleaded, \"you do not believe that this thing would happen?\"  \"Highness, all things are possible,\" said the old man. \"Here in London the cellars and garrets teem with evil men.\"  \"But the police----\" she began.  \"The police cannot shelter you, Highness, as they do in our Russia.\"  \"I must warn the Grand Duke,\" she said thoughtfully, \"and\"--she hesitated, and a shadow passed over her face--\"and the Prince. Is it not him they hate?\"  Kensky shook his head.  \"Lady,\" he said humbly, \"in my letter I told you there was something which could not be put on paper, and that I will tell you now. And if I speak of very high matters, your Highness must forgive an old man.\"  She nodded, and again her laugh twinkled in her eyes.  \"Your father, the Grand Duke Yaroslav,\" he said, \"has one child, who is your Highness.\"  She nodded.  \"The heir to the Grand Dukedom is----\" He stopped inquiringly.  \"The heir?\" she said slowly. \"Why, it is Prince Serganoff. He is with us.\"  Malcolm remembered the olive-faced young man who had sat on the seat of the royal carriage facing the girl; and instinctively he knew that this was Prince Serganoff, though in what relationship he stood to the Grand Ducal pair he had no means of knowing.  \"The heir is Prince Serganoff,\" said the old man slowly, \"and his Highness is an ambitious man. Many things can happen in our Russia, little lady. If the Grand Duke were killed----\"  \"Impossible!\" She sprang to her feet. \"He would never dare! He would never dare!\"  Kensky spread out his expressive hands.  \"Who knows?\" he said. \"Men and women are the slaves of their ambition.\"  She looked at him intently.  \"He would never dare,\" she said slowly. \"No, no, I cannot believe that.\"  The old man made no reply.  \"Where did you learn this, Israel Kensky?\" she asked.  \"From a good source, Highness,\" he replied evasively, and she nodded.  \"I know you would not tell me this unless there were some foundation,\" she said. \"And your friend?\" She looked inquiringly at the silent Hay. \"Does he know?\"  Israel Kensky shook his head.  \"I would wish that the _gospodar_ knew as much as possible, because he will be in Kieff, and who knows what will happen in Kieff? Besides, he knows London.\"  Malcolm did not attempt to deny the knowledge, partly because, in spite of his protest, he had a fairly useful working knowledge of the metropolis.  \"I shall ask the _gospodar_ to discover the meeting-place of the rabble.\"  \"Do you suggest,\" she demanded, \"that Prince Serganoff is behind this conspiracy, that he is the person who inspired this idea of assassination?\"  Again the old man spread out his hands.  \"The world is a very wicked place,\" he said.  \"And the Prince has many enemies,\" she added with a bright smile. \"You must know that, Israel Kensky. My cousin is Chief of the Political Police in St. Petersburg, and it is certain that people will speak against him.\"  The old man was eyeing her thoughtfully.  \"Your Highness has much wisdom,\" he said, \"and I remember, when you were a little girl, how you used to point out to me the bad men from the good. Tell me, lady, is Prince Serganoff a good man or a bad man? Is he capable or incapable of such a crime?\"  She did not answer. In truth she could not answer; for all that Kensky had said, she had thought. She rose to her feet.  \"I must go now, Israel Kensky,\" she said. \"My car is waiting for me. I will write to you.\"  She would have gone alone, but Malcolm Hay, with amazing courage, stepped forward.  \"If Your Imperial Highness will accept my escort to your car,\" he said humbly, \"I shall be honoured.\"  She looked at him in doubt.  \"I think I would rather go alone.\"  \"Let the young man go with you, Highness,\" said Kensky earnestly. \"I shall feel safer in my mind.\"  She nodded, and led the way down the stairs. They turned out of the garden into the street and did not speak a word. Presently the girl said in English:  \"You must think we Russian people are barbarians, Mr.----\"  \"Hay,\" suggested Malcolm.  \"Mr. Hay. That is Scottish, isn't it? Tell me, do you think we are uncivilized?\"  \"No, Your Highness,\" stammered Malcolm. \"How can I think that?\"  They walked on until they came in sight of the tail lights of the car, and then she stopped.  \"You must not come any farther,\" she said. \"You can stand here and watch me go. Do you know any more than Israel Kensky told?\" she asked, a little anxiously.  \"Nothing,\" he replied in truth.  She offered her hand, and he bent over it.  \"Good night, Mr. Hay. Do not forget, I must see you in Kieff.\"  He watched the red lights of the car disappear and walked quickly back to old Kensky's rooms. Russia and his appointment had a new fascination.     CHAPTER IV  THE PRINCE WHO PLANNED   Few people knew or know how powerful a man Prince Serganoff really was in these bad old days. He waved his hand and thousands of men and women disappeared. He beckoned and he had a thousand sycophantic suppliants.  In the days before he became Chief of the Police to the entourage, he went upon a diplomatic mission to High Macedonia, the dark and sinister state. He was sent by none, but he had a reason, for Dimitrius, his sometime friend, had fled to the capital of the higher Balkan state and Serganoff went down without authority to terrify his sometime confidant into returning for trial. In High Macedonia the exquisite young man was led by sheer curiosity to make certain inquiries into the domestic administration of the country, and learnt things.  He had hardly made himself master of these before he was sent for by the Foreign Minister.  \"Highness,\" said the suave man, stroking his long, brown beard, \"how long have you been in the capital?\"  \"Some four days, Excellency,\" said the Prince.  \"That is ninety-six hours too long,\" said the minister. \"There is a train for the north in forty minutes. You will catch that, and God be with you!\"  Prince Serganoff did not argue but went out from the ornate office, and the Minister called a man who was waiting.  \"If his Highness does not leave by the four o'clock train, cut his throat and carry the body to one of the common houses of the town--preferably that of the man Domopolo, the Greek, who is a bad character, and well deserving of death.\"  \"Excellency,\" said the man gravely, and saluted his way out.  They knew Serganoff in High Macedonia and were a little anxious. Had they known him better they would have feared him less. He did not leave by the four o'clock train, but by a special which was across the frontier by four. He sat in a cold sweat till the frontier post was past.  This man was a mass of contradictions. He liked the good things of life. He bought his hosiery in Paris, his shoes in Vienna, his suits and cravats in New York; and it is said of him that he made a special pilgrimage to London--the Mecca of those who love good leather work--for the characteristic attach√© cases which were so indispensable to the Chief of Gendarmerie of the Marsh Town.  He carried with him the irrepressible trimness and buoyancy of youth, with his smooth, sallow face, his neat black moustache and his shapeliness of outline. An exquisite of exquisites, he had never felt the draughts of life or experienced its rude buffetings.  His perfectly-appointed flat in the Morskaya had been modelled to his taste and fancy. It was a suite wherein you pressed buttons and comfortable things happened. You opened windows and boiled water, or summoned a valet to your bedside by the gentle pressure you applied to a mother-of-pearl stud set in silver plate which, by some miracle, was always within reach.  He had an entire suite converted to bath-rooms, where his masseur, his manicurist and his barber attended him daily. He had conscripted modern science to his service, he had so cunningly disguised its application, that you might never guess the motive power of the old English clock which ticked in the spacious hall, or realize that the soft light which came from the many branched candelabra which hung from the centre of his drawing-room was due to anything more up to date than the hundred most life-like candles which filled the sockets.  Yet this suave gentleman with his elegant manners and his pretty taste in old china, this genius who was the finest judge in the capital of Pekinese dogs, and had been known to give a thousand-rouble fee to the veterinary surgeon who performed a minor operation on his favourite Borzoi, had another aspect. He who shivered at the first chill winds of winter and wrapped himself in sables whenever he drove abroad after the last days of September, and had sent men and women to the bleakness of Alexandrowski without a qualm; he who had to fortify himself to face an American dentist (his fees for missed appointments would have kept the average middle-class family in comfort for a year), was ruthless in his dealings with the half-crazed men and women who strayed across the frontier which divided conviction from propaganda.  Physical human suffering left him unmoved--he hanged the murderer Palatoff with his own hands. Yet in that operation someone saw him turn very pale and shrink back from his victim. Afterwards the reason was discovered. The condemned man had had the front of his rough shirt fastened with a safety-pin which had worked loose. The point had ripped a little gash in the inexperienced finger of the amateur hangman.  He brought Dr. Von Krauss from Berlin, because von Krauss was an authority upon blood infection and spent a week of intense mental agony until he was pronounced out of danger.  He sat before a long mirror in his bedroom, that gave on Horridge's Hotel, and surveyed himself thoughtfully. He was looking at the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24920"],["title","The Book of All-Power (#6)"],["body","man he trusted, for it was not vanity, but a love of agreeable company that explained the passion for mirrors which was the jest of St. Petersburg.  It was his fourth day in London and a little table near the window was covered with patterns of cloth; he had spent an exciting afternoon with the representative of his tailor. But it was not of sartorial magnificence that he was thinking.  He stretched out his legs comfortably towards his reflection, and smiled.  \"Yes,\" he said, as though answering some secret thought, and he and the reflection nodded to one another as though they had reached a complete understanding.  Presently he pushed the bell and his valet appeared.  \"Has the Grand Duke gone?\" he asked.  \"Yes, Excellency,\" replied the man.  \"And the Grand Duchess?\"  \"Yes, Excellency.\"  \"Good!\" Serganoff nodded.  \"Is your Excellency's headache better?\" asked the man.  \"Much better,\" replied the Chief of Police. \"Go to their Highness's suite, and tell their servant--what is the man's name?\"  \"Boolba, Excellency,\" said the valet.  \"Yes, that is the fellow. Ask him to come to me. The Grand Duke mentioned a matter which I forgot to tell Boolba.\"  Boolba made his appearance, a suave domestic, wearing the inconspicuous livery of an English butler rather than the ornate uniform which accompanied his office in Kieff.  \"That will do.\" Serganoff dismissed his valet. \"Boolba, come here.\"  The man approached him and Serganoff lowered his voice.  \"You have made a fool of me again, Boolba.\"  \"Excellency,\" pleaded the man urgently, \"I have done all that was possible.\"  \"You have placed my fortune and my life in the hands of an American criminal. If that is your idea of doing all that is possible, I agree with you,\" said Serganoff. \"Be careful, Boolba! The arm of the Bureau is a very long one, and greater men than you have disappeared from their homes.\"  \"Illustrious Excellency,\" said the agitated man, \"I swear to you I did all that you requested. There were many reasons why I should not entrust this matter to the men of the secret society.\"  \"I should like to hear a few,\" said Serganoff, cleaning his nails delicately.  \"Excellency, the Grand Duke stands well with the society. He had never oppressed them, and he is the only popular member of the Imperial House with our--their society.\"  \"Our society, eh?\" said Serganoff, noticing the slip. \"Go on.\"  \"Besides, Excellency,\" said Boolba, \"it was necessary not only to kill the Grand Duke, but to shoot down his assassin. Our plan was to get this American to shoot him in the park, where he walks in the morning, and then for one of the society to shoot the American. That was a good plan, because it meant that the man who could talk would talk no more, and that the comrade who shot down the murderer would stand well with the Government.\"  Serganoff nodded.  \"And your plan has failed,\" he said, \"failed miserably at the outset. You dog!\"  He leapt to his feet, his eyes blazing, and Boolba stepped back.  \"Highness, wait, wait!\" he cried. \"I have something else in my mind! I could have helped Highness better if I had known more. But I could only guess. I had to grope in the dark all the time.\"  \"Do you imagine I am going to take you into my confidence?\" asked Serganoff. \"What manner of fool am I? Tell me what you have guessed. You may sit down; nobody will come in, and if they do you can be buttoning my boots.\"  Boolba wiped his damp face with a handkerchief and leaned nearer to the man.  \"If the Grand Duke dies, a certain illustrious person succeeds to his estates,\" he said, \"but not to his title.\"  Serganoff looked at him sharply. The man had put into words the one difficulty which had occupied the mind of the Chief of Police for months.  \"Well?\" he said.  \"The title is in the gift of the Czar,\" said Boolba. \"He alone can create a Grand Duke who succeeds but is not in the direct line. Therefore, the killing of Yaroslav would bring little but the property to the illustrious person. Only if His Imperial Majesty decided upon a worthier holder, or if the Grand Duke fell under a cloud at Court, could it pass to the illustrious person.\"  \"That I know,\" said Serganoff. \"Well?\"  \"Well, Highness, would it not be better if the Grand Duke were disgraced, if he were brought to St. Petersburg to answer certain charges which the illustrious person formulated? After, the Grand Duke might die--that is a simple matter. Russia would think that he had been put to death by the Court party as a matter of policy. Yaroslav is not in favour at the Court,\" he added significantly; but Serganoff shook his head.  \"He is not sufficiently out of favour yet,\" he said. \"Go on, man, you have something in your mind.\"  Boolba edged closer.  \"Suppose the Grand Duke or the Grand Duchess were involved in some conspiracy against the Imperial House?\" he said, speaking rapidly. \"Suppose, on evidence which could not be disputed, such as the evidence of the London police, it was proved that either the Grand Duke or his daughter was in league with an anarchist society, or was attending their meetings--does your Excellency see?\"  \"I see,\" said Serganoff, \"but they do not attend meetings.\"  Boolba hesitated.  \"Yet,\" he said, speaking slowly, \"I would guarantee that I could bring the Grand Duchess Irene to such a meeting, and that I could arrange for the place to be raided whilst she was there.\"  Serganoff put down his orange stick and eyed the other keenly.  \"You have brains, Boolba,\" he said. \"Some day I shall bring you to St. Petersburg and place you on my staff--if you do not know too much.\"  He paced the apartment, his hands clasped behind his back.  \"Suppose you get in touch with this American again, bring him to the meeting, unless he's afraid to come, and then boldly suggest to him that he goes to St. Petersburg to make an attempt upon the life of the Czar himself.\"  \"He would reject it,\" said Boolba, shaking his head.  \"What if he did--that doesn't matter,\" said Serganoff impatiently. \"It is sufficient that the suggestion is made. Suppose this man is amongst these infamous fellows when the London police raid and arrest them, and he makes a statement that he was approached to destroy the Imperial life, and the Grand Duchess Irene is arrested at the same time?\"  Boolba's eyes brightened.  \"That is a wonderful idea, Highness,\" he said admiringly.  Serganoff continued his pacing, and presently stopped.  \"I will arrange the police raid,\" he said. \"I am in communication with Scotland Yard, and it will be better if I am present when the raid is conducted. It is necessary that I should identify myself with this chapter,\" he said, \"but how will you induce the Grand Duchess to come?\"  \"Leave that to me, Highness,\" replied the man, and gave some details of his scheme.     CHAPTER V  THE RAID ON THE SILVER LION   Sophia Kensky was a loyal and faithful adherent to the cause she had espoused, and her report, written in the weird caligraphy of Russia, greatly interested the butler of the Grand Duke Yaroslav. From that report he learned of the visit which the Grand Duchess Irene had paid; learned, too, that she had been escorted to her car by an Englishman, whose name the woman did not know; and was to discover later that the said \"Englishman\" had been sent out by Israel Kensky on a special mission. That mission was to discover the Silver Lion, a no very difficult task. In point of fact, it was discoverable in a London telephone directory, because the upper part of the premises were used legitimately enough in the proprietor's business as restaurateur.  Malcolm Hay had lunch at the place and saw nothing suspicious in its character. Most of the client√®le were obviously foreign, and not a few were Russian. Pretending to lose his way, he wandered through the service door, and there made the important discovery that the kitchen was on the top floor, and also that meals were being served somewhere in the basement. This he saw during the few minutes he was allowed to make observations, because there was a service lift which was sent down to the unseen clients below.  He apologized for his intrusion and went out. Officially there was no basement-room, nor, from the restaurant itself, any sign of stairs which led down to an underground chamber. He made a further reconnaissance, and found the back door which Sophia Kensky had described in her hypnotic sleep, and the location of which the old man had endeavoured to convey to his agent.  Malcolm Hay was gifted with many of the qualities which make up the equipment of a good detective. In addition, he had the education and training of an engineer. That the underground room existed, he knew by certain structural evidence, and waited about in the street until he saw three men come out and the door close behind them. After awhile, another two emerged. There was nothing sinister or romantic about the existence of a basement dining-room, or even of a basement club-room.  The character of this club was probably well known to the police, he thought, and pursued his inquiries to Marlborough Street police station. There he found, as he had expected, that the club was registered and known as \"The Foreign Friends of Freedom Club.\" The officer who supplied him with the information told him that the premises were visited at frequent intervals by a representative of the police, and that nothing of an irregular character had been reported.  \"Have you any complaints to make?\" asked the official.  \"None whatever,\" smiled Hay. \"Only I am writing an article on the foreign clubs of London, and I want to be sure of my facts.\"  It was the first and most plausible lie that occurred to him, and it answered his purpose. He returned to Kensky with his information, and the old man producing a map of London, he marked the spot with a red cross. All this time Malcolm Hay was busy making preparations for departure. He would have been glad to stay on, so that his leaving London would coincide with the departure of the Grand"]]]
