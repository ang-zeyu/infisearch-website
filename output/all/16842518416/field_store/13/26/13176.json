We'll see which are addled, and which are not.\"  Tanta Sal was at the door as they rode up, and her face expanded largely, especially about the eyes and mouth, at the sight of the eggs.  \"I say, look at Tant,\" said Dyke merrily.  \"Did you ever see such a face?\"  \"Never,\" replied Emson quietly.  \"She's not beautiful from our point of view.\"  \"Beautiful!\"  \"Tastes differ, old chap,\" said Emson.  \"No doubt Jack thought her very nice-looking.  English people admire small mouths and little waists.  It is very evident that the Kaffirs do not; and I don't see why a small mouth should be more beautiful than a large one.\"  \"And there isn't so much of it,\" cried Dyke.  \"Certainly not, and it is not so useful.  No: Tant is not handsome, but she can cook, and I don't believe that Venus could have fetched water from the spring in two buckets half so well.\"  \"Don't suppose she could, or made fires either,\" said Dyke, laughing.  \"Very good, then, little un.  Tant is quite good-looking enough for us.--Hi! there, old girl, take these and keep them cool.  Cook one for dinner.\"  The woman nodded, took the net, swung it over her back, and the next minute the creamy-white eggs were seen reposing on the dark skin.  After seeing to the horses, Dyke made some remark to his brother about wanting his corn too, and he went quietly round to the back, where Tant was busy over the fire, preparing one of the eggs by cooking it _au naturel_, not boiling in a saucepan, but making the thick shell itself do duty for one.  She looked up and showed her teeth as Dyke came in sight, and then went on with her work, which was that of stirring the egg, whose treatment was very simple.  She had chipped a little hole in one end, big enough to admit a stick, and had placed the other end deep down in the glowing dry cake ashes, squatting down on her heels on one side of the fire, while Jack sat in a similar position on the other, watching his wife as she kept on stirring the egg with the piece of wood.  \"Oh there you are, Jack,\" said Dyke; \"we've shot a big lion.\"  \"Baas kill?\"  \"Yes.  You're coming with us to skin it this evening?\"  The Kaffir shook his head, and then lowered it upon one hand, making a piteous grimace.  \"Jack sick, bad,\" he said.  \"Jack no sick bad,\" cried Tanta, leaping up angrily.  As she spoke, she raised one broad black foot, and gave her husband a sharp thrust in the ribs, with the result that he rolled over and then jumped up furiously to retaliate.  \"Ah, would you!\" cried Dyke; and the dog, which had followed him, began to growl.  \"Yes, you hit her, and I'll set Duke at you,\" cried Dyke. \"Can't you see he's ashamed?\"  Jack growled fiercely, and his wife reseated herself upon her heels, and went on stirring the egg again, laughing merrily the while.  \"No sick bad,\" she said; and then wanting to say something more, she rattled off a series of words, all oom and click, for Jack's benefit, the Kaffir listening the while.  The egg was soon after declared to be done, and formed a very satisfactory omelette-like addition to the hard biltong and mealie cake which formed the ostrich-farmers' dinner.  \"I'd a deal rather we'd shot an antelope, Joe,\" said Dyke, as he ground away at the biltong, that popular South African delicacy, formed by cutting fresh meat into long strips, and drying them in the sun before the flesh has time to go bad--a capital plan in a torrid country, where decomposition is rapid and salt none too plentiful; but it has its drawbacks, and is best suited to the taste of those who appreciate the chewing of leather with a superlatively high flavour of game.  \"Yes, it is time we had some fresh meat, old chap,\" said Emson good-humouredly.  \"After that slice of luck with the birds, we'll try for some guinea-fowl or a springbok in the morning.\"  \"I wish we had a river nearer where we could fish,\" said Dyke, as he worked away at the dried meat.  \"Yes, it would be handy, if we could catch any fish; but we usen't to get a great many--not enough to live on--in the old days at home.\"  \"Not often,\" said Dyke.  \"I say, it is tough.\"  \"Well, yes.  A well-beaten-out piece would not make a bad shoe sole, little un.  But about that fishing?  It would take a great many of those sticklebacks you always would fish for with a worm to make a dish.\"  \"Well, they used to bite, and that's more than your carp would, Joe. Why, you only used to catch about one a month.\"  \"But, then, look at the size.  One did make a dish.\"  \"Yes, of only head and bones.  Ugh!  I'd rather eat biltong.\"  Emson laughed good-humouredly.  \"Well,\" he said, \"we can't go fishing without we make a hundred miles' journey, so we can't get fish.  How would a lion steak eat?\"  \"Worse than a cut out of the poor old goblin's breast.  But, I say, are we to go and skin that old savage to-night?\"  \"I'll go with Jack, and do it, if you're tired.\"  \"That you won't,\" cried Dyke.  \"But, I say, Jack's bad sick he says.\"  \"Yes, I suppose so.  He generally is now, when we want him to work. We've spoiled Master Jack by feeding him too well; and if it wasn't for Tanta Sal, Master Jack would have to go upon his travels.  That woman's a treasure, little un.  She's a capital cook; and what a wonderful thing it is that it comes so natural to a woman, whether she's white or black, to like washing shirts.  Do you know, I believe that Tanta Sal would take to starching and ironing if she had a chance.  Have any more?\"  \"No: done,\" said Dyke, wiping his knife carefully, and returning it to the sheath he wore in his belt.  \"Then let's go and have a look at the chickens.  Why, the other day I felt as if I could open all the pens and say to the birds, `There, be off with you, for you're no good.'\"  \"But now you're going to have another good try.\"  \"Yes; and we must give them greater liberty, and try to let them live in a more natural way.\"  \"And that means always hunting them and driving them back to the pens.\"  \"We shan't mind that if they all turn out healthy,\" said Emson.  \"Come along.\"  \"Wait till I call Tant,\" said Dyke; and he went out to the back to summon the Kaffir woman, who came in smiling, cleared away, and then proceeded to feed her lord; Duke, the dog, waiting for his turn, and not being forgotten.  It was like playing at keeping bantams in Brobdingnag, Dyke said, as they entered the pens pretty well provided with food for the birds, and going from enclosure to enclosure, armed each with a stout stick, necessitated by the manners and customs of their charge.  For though it was plain sailing enough scattering out food for the young birds, which stalked about looking very solemn and stupid, the full-grown and elderly, especially the cocks, displayed a desire for more, to which \"glutton\" would be far too mild a term to apply; while the goblin's successor, as king of the farm, seemed to have become so puffed up with pride at his succession to the throne, that the stick had to be applied several times in response to his insatiable and aggressive demands.  But at last the feeding was done, the hens in attendance on the nest of eggs visited, where all seemed satisfactory, and then the horses were saddled, and Jack and Duke summoned.  The latter dashed up instantly; but Jack made no reply.  \"Yes, he is spoiled,\" said Emson.  \"It has always seemed to be so much less trouble to saddle our own horses than to see that he did it properly; but we ought to have made him do it, little un.\"  \"Of course we ought,\" said Dyke.  \"It isn't too late to begin now?\"  \"I'm afraid it is,\" said Emson.--\"Here!  Hi!  Jack,\" he shouted; and the dog supplemented the cry by running toward the house, barking loudly, with the result that the Kaffir woman came out, saw at a glance what was wanted, and turned back.  The next minute there was a scuffling noise heard behind the place, accompanied by angry protesting voices, speaking loudly in the Kaffir tongue.  Then all at once Jack appeared, carrying three assegais, and holding himself up with a great deal of savage dignity; but as he approached he was struck on the back of the head by a bone.  He turned back angrily, but ducked down to avoid a dry cake of fuel, and ended by running to avoid further missiles, with his dignity all gone, for Tanta Sal's grinning face peeped round the corner, and she shouted: \"Jack bad sick, baas.  All eat--seep.\"  \"Yes; that's what's the matter, Jack,\" said Emson, shaking his head at him.  \"Now take hold of the horse's mane, and I'll give you a good digestive run.\"  There was no help for it.  Jack seized the mane and trotted off beside the horse, while a derisive shout came from behind the house, and Tanta's grinning face re-appeared.  This was too much for Jack, who turned to shake his assegais at her: the movement was unpropitious, for he stumbled and fell, but gathered himself up, caught up to the horse, and trotted on again, keeping on in the most untiring way, till a flight of carrion birds was sighted, hovering about the granite boulders, and perching here and there, as if ready for the banquet to come.  Duke charged forward at this, and the birds scattered, but did not go far; while the dog's approach started half-a-dozen jackals from among the bushes to which they had retired, and they now began scurrying over the plain.  \"I wonder how they find out that there's anything dead, Joe,\" said Dyke; \"we did not see a single jackal or bird this morning.\"  \"Eyesight,\" said Emson quietly.  \"The vultures are sailing about on high, and one sees the dead animal; then other vultures see him making for it, and follow.\"  \"And the jackals see the vultures, and follow too?\"  \"That seems to be the way, old fellow.  Anyhow, they always manage to find out where there's anything to eat.\"  \"I say, don't he look big?\" said Dyke, as the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24826"],["title","Hildegarde's Holiday: A Story for Girls (#0)"],["body","Team at https://www.pgdp.net            HILDEGARDE'S HOLIDAY     THE  HILDEGARDE-MARGARET SERIES  By Laura E.

CHAPTER I.  INTRODUCTORY.   In a small waiting-room at Blank Hospital a girl was walking up and down, with quick, impatient steps. Every few minutes she stopped to listen; then, hearing no sound, she resumed her walk, with hands clasped and lips set firmly together. She was evidently in a state of high nervous excitement, for the pupils of her eyes were so dilated that they flashed black as night instead of gray; and a bright red spot burned in either cheek. In the corner, in an attitude of anxious dejection, sat a small dog. He had tried following his mistress at first, when she began her walk, and finding that the promenade took them nowhere and was very monotonous, had tried to vary the monotony by worrying her heels in a playful manner; whereupon he had been severely reprimanded, and sent into the corner, from which he dared not emerge. He was trying, with his usual lack of success, to fathom the motives which prompted human beings to such strange and undoglike actions, when suddenly a door opened, and a lady and gentleman came in. The girl sprang forward. \"Mamma!\" she cried. \"Doctor!\"  \"It is all right, my dear,\" said the doctor, quickly; while the lady, whose name was Mrs. Grahame, took the girl in her arms quietly, and kissed her. \"It is all right; everything has gone perfectly, and in a few days your lovely friend will be better than she has ever been since she was a baby.\"  Hildegarde Grahame sat down, and leaning her head on her mother's shoulder, burst into tears.  \"Exactly!\" said the good doctor. \"The best thing you could do, my child! Do you want to hear the rest now, or shall I leave it for your mother to tell?\"  \"Let her hear it all from you, Doctor,\" said Mrs. Grahame. \"It will do her more good than anything else.\"  Hildegarde looked up and nodded, and smiled through her tears.  \"Well,\" said the cheerful physician, \"Miss Angel (her own name is an impossibility, and does not belong to her) has really borne the operation wonderfully. Marvellously!\" he repeated. \"The constitution, you see, was originally good. There was a foundation to work upon; that means everything, in a case like this. Now all that she requires is to be built up,--built up! Beef tea, chicken broth, wine jelly, and as soon as practicable, fresh air and exercise,--there is your programme, Miss Hildegarde; I think I can depend upon you to carry it out.\"  The girl stretched out her hand, which he grasped warmly. \"Dear, good doctor!\" she said; whereupon the physician growled, and went and looked out of the window.  \"And how soon will she be able to walk?\" asked the happy Hildegarde, drying her eyes and smiling through the joyful tears. \"And when may I see her, Doctor? and how does she look, Mamma darling?\"  \"_Place aux dames!_\" said the Doctor. \"You may answer first, Mrs. Grahame, though your question came last.\"  \"Dear, she looks like a white rose!\" replied Mrs. Grahame. \"She is sleeping quietly, with no trace of pain on her sweet face. Her breathing is as regular as a baby's; all the nurses are coming on tiptoe to look at her, and they all say, 'Bless her!' when they move away.\"  \"My turn now,\" said Dr. Flower. \"You may see her, Miss Hildegarde, the day after to-morrow, if all goes well, as I am tolerably sure it will; and she will be able to walk--well, say in a month.\"  \"Oh! a month!\" cried Hildegarde, dolefully. \"Do you mean that she cannot walk at all till then, Doctor?\"  \"Why, Hilda!\" said Mrs. Grahame, in gentle protest. \"Pink has not walked for fourteen years, remember; surely a month is a very short time for her to learn in.\"  \"I suppose so,\" said the girl, still looking disappointed, however.  \"Oh, she will _begin_ before that!\" said Dr. Flower. \"She will begin in ten days, perhaps. Little by little, you know,--a step at a time. In a fortnight she may go out to drive; in fact, carriage exercise will be a very good thing for her. An easy carriage, a gentle horse, a careful driver--\"  \"Oh, you best of doctors!\" cried Hildegarde, her face glowing again with delight. \"Mamma, is not that exactly what we want? I do believe we can do it, after all. You see, Doctor--Oh, tell him, Mammy dear! You will tell him so much better.\"  \"Hildegarde has had a very delightful plan for this summer, Doctor,\" said Mrs. Graham, \"ever since you gave us the happy hope that this operation, after the year of treatment, would restore our dear Rose to complete health. A kinswoman of mine, a very lovely old lady, who lives in Maine, spent a part of last winter with us, and became much interested in Rose,--or Pink, as we used to call her.\"  \"But we _don't_ call her so now, Mammy!\" cried Hildegarde, impetuously. \"Rose is exactly as much her own name, and she likes it much better; and even Bubble says it is prettier. But I _didn't_ mean to interrupt, Mammy dear. Go on, please!\"  \"So,\" continued Mrs. Grahame, smiling, \"Cousin Wealthy invited the two girls to make her a long visit this summer, as soon as Rose should be able to travel. I am sure it would be a good thing for the child, if you think the journey would not be too much for her; for it is a lovely place where Cousin Wealthy lives, and she would have the best of care.\"  \"Capital!\" cried Dr. Flower; \"the very thing! She _shall_ be able to travel, my dear madam. We will pack her in cotton wool if necessary; but it will not be necessary. It is now--let me see--May 10th; yes, quite so! By the 15th of June you may start on your travels, Miss Hildegarde. There is a railway near your cousin's home, Mrs Grahame?\"  \"Oh, yes!\" cried Hilda. \"It goes quite near, doesn't it, Mamma?\"  \"Within two or three miles,\" said Mrs. Grahame; \"and the carriage road is very good.\"  \"That is settled, then!\" said Dr. Flower, rising; \"and a very good thing too. And now I must go at once and tell the good news to that bright lad, Miss Rose's brother. He is at school, I think you said?\"  \"Yes,\" replied Hildegarde. \"He said he would rather not know the exact day, since he could not be allowed to help. Good Bubble! he has been so patient and brave, though I know he has thought of nothing else day and night. Thank you, Doctor, for being so kind as to let him know. Good-by!\"  But when Dr. Flower went out into the hall, he saw standing opposite the door a boy, neatly dressed and very pale, with burning eyes, which met his in an agony of inquiry.  \"She is all right,\" said the physician, quickly. \"She is doing extremely well, and will soon be able to walk like other people. How upon earth did you know?\" he added, in some vexation, seeing that the sudden relief from terrible anxiety was almost more than the lad could bear. \"What idiot told you?\"  Bubble Chirk gave one great sob; but the next moment he controlled himself. \"Nobody told me,\" he said; \"I knew. I can't tell you how, sir, but--I knew!\"     CHAPTER II.  MISS WEALTHY.   It was the 17th of June, and Miss Wealthy Bond was expecting her young visitors. Twice she had gone over the house, with Martha trotting at her heels, to see that everything was in order, and now she was making a third tour of inspection; not because she expected to find anything wrong, but because it was a pleasure to see that everything was right.  Miss Wealthy Bond was a very pretty old lady, and was very well aware of the fact, having been told "]]]
