But she cared nothing for him, and had given her heart to the South Wind,--the most fickle and tormenting lover you can imagine. Sometimes he was perfectly charming, and wooed her in the most enchanting manner, murmuring soft things in her ear, and kissing and caressing her, till I almost fell in love with him myself. Then he would leave her alone,--oh! for days and days,--till she drooped, poor thing! and was perfectly miserable. And then perhaps he would come again in a fury, and shake and beat her in the most frightful manner, tearing her hair out, and sometimes flinging her right into the arms of poor Sir Scraggo, who quivered with emotion, but never took advantage of the situation. I used to be _very_ sorry for Sir Scraggo.\"  \"What a shame!\" cried Hildegarde, warmly. \"Couldn't you make her care for the poor dear?\"  \"Oh, no!\" said Rose. \"She was very self-willed, that gentle Eglantine, in spite of her soft, pretty ways. There was no moving her. She turned her back as nearly as she could on Sir Scraggo, and bent farther and farther toward the south, stretching her arms out as if imploring her heartless lover to stay with her. I fastened her back to the wall once with strips of list, for she was spoiling her figure by stooping so much; but she looked so utterly miserable that I took them off again. Dear Eglantine! I wonder if she misses me.\"  \"I think she was rather a minx, do you know?\" said Hildegarde. \"I prefer Sir Scraggo myself.\"  \"Well,\" replied Rose, \"one respected Sir Scraggo very much indeed; but he was _not_ beautiful, and all the De Cedars are pretty stiff and formal. Then you must remember he was older than Eglantine and I,--ever and ever so much older.\"  \"That does make a difference,\" said Hildegarde. \"Who were some other of your garden people, you funniest Rose?\"  \"There was Old Moneybags!\" replied Rose. \"How I did detest that old man! He was a hideous old thorny cactus, all covered with warts and knobs and sharp spines. Dear mother was very proud of him, and she was always hoping he would blossom, but he never did. He lived in the house in winter, but in spring Mother set him out in the flower-bed, just beside the double buttercup. So when the buttercup blossomed, with its lovely yellow balls, I played that Old Moneybags, who was an odious old miser, was counting his gold. Then, when the petals dropped, he piled his money in little heaps, and finally he buried it. He wasn't very interesting, Old Moneybags, but the buttercups were lovely. Then there were Larry Larkspur and Miss Poppy. I wonder--No! I don't believe you would.\"  \"What I like about your remarks,\" said Hildegarde, \"is that they are so clear. What do you mean by believing I wouldn't? I tell you I would!\"  \"Well,\" said Rose, laughing and blushing, \"it really isn't anything; only--well, I made a little rhyme about Larry Larkspur and Miss Poppy one summer. I thought of it just now; and first I wondered if it would amuse you, and then I decided it wouldn't.\"  \"_You_ decided, forsooth!\" cried Hildegarde. \"'\"Who are you?\" said the caterpillar.' I will hear about Larry Larkspur, if you please, without more delay.\"  \"It really _isn't_ worth hearing!\" said Rose. \"Still, if you want it you shall have it; so listen!          \"Larry Larkspur, Larry Larkspur,           Wears a cap of purple gay;          Trim and handy little dandy,           Straight and smirk he stands alway.          \"Larry Larkspur, Larry Larkspur,           Saw the Poppy blooming fair;          Loved her for her scarlet satin,           Loved her for her fring√®d hair.          \"Sent a message by the night-wind:           'Wilt thou wed me, lady gay?          For the heart of Larry Larkspur           Beats and burns for thee alway.'          \"When the morning 'gan to brighten,           Eager glanced he o'er the bed.          Lo! the Poppy's leaves had fallen;           Bare and brown her ugly head.          \"Sore amazed stood Larry Larkspur,           And his heart with grief was big.          'Woe is me! she was so lovely,           Who could guess she wore a wig?'\"  Hildegarde was highly delighted with the verses, and clamored for more; but at this moment some one was seen coming toward them through the trees. The some one proved to be Martha, with her sleeves rolled up, beaming mildly through her spectacles. She carried a tray, on which were two glasses of creamy milk and a plate of freshly baked cookies. Such cookies! crisp and thin, with what Martha called a \"pale bake\" on them, and just precisely the right quantity of ginger.  \"Miss Rose doesn't look over and above strong,\" she explained, as the girls exclaimed with delight, \"and 't would be a pity for her to eat alone. The cookies is fresh, and maybe they're pretty good.\"  \"Martha,\" said Hildegarde, as she nibbled a cooky, \"you are a saint! Where do you keep your aureole, for I am sure you have one?\"  \"There's a pair of 'em, Miss Hilda,\" replied Martha. \"They build every year in the big elm by the back door, and they do sing beautiful.\"     CHAPTER IV.  THE DOCTORS.   \"My dears,\" said Miss Wealthy, as they sat down to dinner,--the bell rang on the stroke of one, and the girls were both ready and waiting in the parlor, which pleased the dear old lady very much,--\"my dears, when I made the little suggestions this morning as to how you should amuse yourselves, I entirely forgot to mention Dr. Abernethy. I cannot imagine how I should have forgotten it, but Martha assures me that I did. Dr. Abernethy is entirely at your service in the mornings, but I generally require him for an hour in the afternoon. I am sure Rose will be the better for his treatment; and I trust you will both find him satisfactory, though possibly he may seem to you a little slow, for he is not so young as he once was.\"  \"Dr.--Oh, Cousin Wealthy!\" exclaimed Hildegarde, in dismay. \"But we are perfectly well! At least--of course, Rose is not strong yet; but she is gaining strength every day, and we have Dr. Flower's directions. Indeed, we don't need any doctor.\"  Cousin Wealthy smiled. She enjoyed a little joke as much as any one, and Dr. Abernethy was one of her standing jokes.  \"I think, my dear,\" she said, \"that you will be very glad to avail yourself of the Doctor's services when once you know him. Indeed, I shall make a point of your seeing him once a day, as a rule.\" Then, seeing that both girls were thoroughly mystified, she added: \"Dr. Abernethy is a very distinguished physician. He gives no medicine, his invariable prescription being a little gentle exercise. He lives--in the stable, my dears, and he has four legs and a tail.\"  \"Oh! oh! Cousin Wealthy, how could you frighten us so!\" cried Hildegarde. \"You must be kissed immediately, as a punishment.\" She flew around the table, and kissed the soft cheek, like a crumpled blush rose. \"A horse! How delightful! Rose, we were wishing that we might drive, weren't we? And what a funny, nice name! Dr. Abernethy! He was a great English doctor, wasn't he? And I was wondering if some stupid country doctor had stolen his name.\"  \"I had rather a severe illness a few years ago,\" said Miss Wealthy, \"and when I was recovering from it my physician advised me to try driving regularly, saying that he should resign in favor of Dr. Horse. So I bought this excellent beast, and named him Dr. Abernethy, after the famous physician, whom I had seen once in London, when I was a little girl.\"  \"It was he who used to do such queer things, wasn't it?\" said Hildegarde. \"Did he do anything strange when you saw him, Cousin Wealthy?\"  \"Nothing really strange,\" said Miss Wealthy, \"though it seemed so to me then. He came to see my mother, who was ill, and bolted first into the room where I sat playing with my doll.  \"'Who's this? who's this?' he said, in a very gruff voice. 'Little girl! Humph! Tooth-ache, little girl?'  \"'No, sir,' I answered faintly, being frightened nearly out of my wits.  \"'Head-ache, little girl?'  \"'No, sir.'  \"'Stomach-ache, little girl?'  \"'Oh, no, sir!'  \"'Then take that!' and he thrust a little paper of chocolate drops into my hand, and stumped out of the room as quickly as he had come in. I thought he was an ogre at first; for I was only seven years old, and had just been reading 'Jack and the Beanstalk;' but the chocolate drops reassured me.\"  \"What an extraordinary man!\" exclaimed Rose. \"And was he a very good doctor?\"  \"Oh, wonderful!\" replied Miss Wealthy. \"People came from all parts of the world to consult him, and he could not even go out in the street without being clutched by some anxious patient. They used to tell a funny story about an old woman's catching him in this way one day, when he was in a great hurry,--but he was always in a hurry,--and pouring out a long string of symptoms, so fast that the doctor could not get in a word edgewise. At last he shouted 'Stop!' so loud that all the people in the street turned round to stare. The old lady stopped in terror, and Dr. Abernethy bade her shut her eyes and put her tongue out; then, when she did so, he walked off, and left her standing there in the middle of the sidewalk with her tongue out. I don't know whether it is true, though.\"  \"Oh, I hope it is!\" cried Hildegarde, laughing. \"It is too funny not to be true.\"  \"We had a very queer doctor at Glenfield some years ago,\" said Rose. \"He must have been just the opposite of Dr. Abernethy. He was very tall and very slow, and spoke with the queerest drawl, using always the longest words he could find. I never shall forget his coming to our house once when Bubble had the measles. He had come a day or two before, but I had not seen him. This time, however, I was in the room. He sat down by the bed, and began stroking his long chin. It was the longest chin I ever saw, nearly as long as the rest of his face.  \"'And is there any amelioration of the symptoms this morning?' he asked Mother,--'ame-e-lioration?' (He was very fond of repeating any word"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24826"],["title","Hildegarde's Holiday: A Story for Girls (#4)"],["body","he thought sounded well.)  \"Poor dear mother hadn't the faintest idea what amelioration was; and she stammered and colored, and said she hadn't noticed any, and didn't _think_ the child had it. But luckily I was in the 'Fifth Reader' then, and had happened to have 'amelioration' in my spelling-lesson only a few days before; so I spoke up and said, 'Oh, yes, Dr. Longman, he is a great deal better, and he is really hungry to-day.'  \"'Ah!' said Dr. Longman, 'craves food, does he?--cra-aves food!'  \"Just then Bubble's patience gave out. He was getting better, and it made him _so_ cross, poor dear! he snapped out, in his funny way, 'I've got a bile comin' on my nose, and it hurts like fury!'  \"Dr. Longman stooped forward, put on his spectacles, and looked at the boil carefully. 'Ah!' he said, 'furunculus,--furunculus! Is it--ah--is it excru-ciating?'  \"I can't describe the way in which he pronounced the last word. As he said it, he dropped his head, and looked over his spectacles at Bubble in a way that was perfectly irresistible. Bubble gave a sort of howl, and disappeared under the bedclothes; and I had a fit of coughing, which made Mother very anxious. Dear mother! she never could see anything funny about Dr. Longman.\"  At this moment Martha entered, bringing the dessert,--a wonderful almond-pudding, such as only Martha could make. She stopped a moment, holding the door as if to prevent some one's coming in.  \"Here's the Doctor wants terrible to come in, Mam!\" she said. \"Will I let him?\"  \"Yes, certainly,\" said Miss Wealthy, smiling. \"Let the good Doctor in!\"  The girls looked up in amazement, half expecting to see a horse's head appear in the doorway; but instead, a majestic black \"coon\" cat, with waving feathery tail and large yellow eyes, walked solemnly in, and seeing the two strangers, stopped to observe them.  \"My dears, this is the other Doctor!\" said Miss Wealthy, bending to caress the new-comer \"Dr. Samuel Johnson, at your service. He is one of the most important members of the family. Doctor, I hope you will be very friendly to these young ladies, and not take one of your absurd dislikes to either of them. All depends upon the first impression, my dears!\" she added, in an undertone, to the girls. \"He is forming his opinion now, and nothing will ever alter it.\"  Quite a breathless pause ensued; while the magnificent cat stood motionless, turning his yellow eyes gravely from one to the other of the girls. At length Hildegarde could not endure his gaze any longer, and she said hastily but respectfully, \"Yes, sir! I _have_ read 'Pilgrim's Progress,' I assure you!--read it through and through, a number of times, and love it dearly.\"  Dr. Johnson instantly advanced, and rubbing his head against her dress, purred loudly. He then went round to Rose, who sat opposite, and made the same demonstration of good-will to her.  \"Dear pussy!\" said Rose, stroking him gently, and scratching him behind one ear in a very knowing manner.  Miss Wealthy drew a long breath of satisfaction. \"It is all right,\" she said. \"Martha, he is delighted with the young ladies. Dear Doctor! he shall have some almond-pudding at once. Bring me his saucer, please, Martha!\"  Martha brought a blue saucer; but Miss Wealthy looked at it with surprise and disapproval.  \"That is not the Doctor's saucer, Martha,\" she said. \"Is it possible that you have forgotten? He has _always_ had the odd yellow saucer ever since he was a kitten.\"  \"I'm sorry, Mam,\" said Martha, gently. \"Jenny broke the yellow saucer this morning, Mam, as she was washing it after the Doctor's breakfast. I'm very sorry it should have happened, Mam.\"  \"_Broke the yellow saucer!_\" cried Miss Wealthy. Her voice was as soft as ever, but Hildegarde and Rose both felt as if the Russians had entered Constantinople. There was a moment of dreadful silence, and then Miss Wealthy tried to smile, and began to help to the almond-pudding. \"Yes, I am sure you are sorry, Martha!\" she said;--\"Hilda, my dear, a little pudding?--and probably Jenny is sorry too. You like the sauce, dear, don't you? We think Martha's almond-pudding one of her best. I should not have minded so much if it had been any other, but this was an odd one, and seemed so appropriate, on account of Hogarth's 'Industrious Apprentice' done in brown on the inside. Is it quite sweet enough for you, my dear Rose?\"  This speech was somewhat bewildering; but after a moment Rose succeeded in separating the part that belonged to her, and said that the pudding was most delicious.  \"Jenny broke a cup last winter, did she not, Martha?\" asked Miss Wealthy.  \"A very small cup, Mam,\" replied Martha, deprecatingly. \"That's all she has broken since she came. She's young, you know, Mam; and she says the saucer just slipped out of her hand, and fell on the bricks.\"  Miss Wealthy shivered a little, as if she heard the crash of the broken china. \"I cannot remember that you have broken anything, Martha,\" she said, \"in thirty years; and you were young when you came to me. But we will not say anything more, and I dare say Jenny will be more careful in future. The pudding is very good, Martha; and that will do, thank you.\" Martha withdrew, and Miss Wealthy turned to the girls with a sad little smile. \"Martha is very exact,\" she said. \"A thing of this sort troubles her extremely. Very methodical, my good Martha!\"  \"Hildegarde,\" said Rose, wishing to turn the subject and cheer the spirits of their kind hostess, \"what did you mean, just now, by telling Dr. Johnson that you had read 'Pilgrim's Progress'? I am much puzzled!\"  Hildegarde laughed. \"Oh!\" she said, \"he understood, but I will explain for your benefit. When I was a little girl I was not inclined to like 'Pilgrim's Progress' at first. I thought it rather dull, and liked the Fairy Book better. I said so to Papa one day; and instead of replying, he went to the bookcase, and taking down Boswell's 'Life of Johnson,' he read me a little story. I think I can say it in the very words of the book, they made so deep an impression on me: 'Dr. Johnson one day took Bishop Percy's little daughter on his knee, and asked her what she thought of 'Pilgrim's Progress.' The child answered that she had not read it. 'No!' replied the Doctor; 'then I would not give one farthing for you!' And he set her down, and took no further notice of her.' When Papa explained to me,\" continued Hildegarde, laughing, \"what a great man Dr. Johnson was, it seemed to me very dreadful that he should think me, or another little girl like me, not worth a farthing. So I set to work with right good-will at 'Pilgrim's Progress;' and when I was once fairly _in_ the story, of course I couldn't put it down till I had finished it.\"  \"Your father is a very sensible man,\" said Miss Wealthy, approvingly. \"'Pilgrim's Progress' is an important part of a child's education, certainly! Let me give you a little more pudding, Hilda, my dear! No! nor you, Rose? Then, if the Doctor is ready, suppose we go into the parlor.\"  They found the parlor very cool and pleasant, with the blinds, as usual, drawn half-way down. Miss Wealthy drew one blind half an inch lower, compared it with the others, and pushed it up an eighth of an inch.  \"And what are you going to do with yourselves this afternoon, girlies?\" she asked, settling herself in her armchair, and smelling of her pansies, which, as usual, stood on the little round table at her elbow.  \"Rose must go and lie down at once!\" said Hildegarde, decidedly. \"She must lie down for two hours every day at first, Dr. Flower says, and one hour by and by, when she is a great deal stronger. And I--oh, I shall read to her a little, till she begins to be sleepy, and then I shall write to Mamma and wander about. This is such a _happy_ place, Cousin Wealthy! One does not need to do anything in particular; it is enough just to be alive and well.\" Then she remembered her manners, and added: \"But isn't there something I can do for you, Cousin Wealthy? Can't I write some notes for you,--I often write notes for Mamma,--or wind some worsted, or do something useful? I have been playing all day, you know.\"  Miss Wealthy looked pleased. \"Thank you, my dear!\" she said warmly. \"I shall be very glad of your help sometimes; but to-day I really have nothing for you to do, and besides, I think the first day ought to be all play. If you can make yourself happy in this quiet place, that is all I shall ask of you to-day. I shall probably take a little nap myself, as I often do after dinner, sitting here in my chair.\"  Obeying Hildegarde's imperative nod, Rose left her seat by the window, half reluctantly, and moved slowly toward the door. \"It seems wicked to lie down on such a day!\" she murmured; \"but I suppose I must.\"  As she spoke, she heard a faint, a very faint sigh from Miss Wealthy. Feeling instinctively that something was wrong, she turned and saw that the tidy on the back of the chair she had been sitting in had slipped down. She went back quickly, straightened it, patted it a little, and then with an apologetic glance and smile at the old lady, went to join Hildegarde.  \"A very sweet, well-mannered girl!\" was Miss Wealthy's mental comment, as her eyes rested contentedly on the smooth rectangular lines of the tidy. \"Two of the sweetest girls, in fact, that I have seen for a good while. Mildred has brought up her daughter extremely well; and when one thinks of it, she herself has developed in a most extraordinary manner. A most notable and useful woman, Mildred! Who would have thought it?\"  Rose slept in the inner bedroom, which opened directly out of Hildegarde's, with a curtained doorway between. It was a pretty room, and very appropriate for Rose, as there were roses on the wall-paper and on the soft gray carpet. Here the ex-invalid, as she began to call herself, lay down on the cool white bed, in the pretty summer wrapper of white challis, dotted with rosebuds, which had been Mrs. Grahame's parting present. Hildegarde put a light "]]]
