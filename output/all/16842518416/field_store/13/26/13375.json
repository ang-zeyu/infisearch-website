Women who become promiscuous in their friendships have time to waste for a number of reasons,--  1st. Their husband and home is not their whole existence. If success and happiness depend upon how the first year of wedded life is employed, then husband and home should be the young wife's whole existence.  2nd. Women with time to waste have no ideals. Women without ideals are not home-makers. A home-maker cannot acquire any information from a woman who wastes her time in idleness.  3rd. Idleness creates mischief. One who is idle is a mischief maker. An idle brain is looking for amusement, and as the impulses of an idle brain are evil, these women are gossips, and scandal-mongers, and home-breakers.  4th. True friendship demands nothing. Promiscuous friendship on the other hand does demand something, and as these women live in the evil atmosphere, they live mentally on scandal and gossip. This is their mental plane and they give and take nothing higher than that which they understand.  The young wife will, therefore, be wary of this form of friendship. Infinite harm is being done in every community in the country in this way. No home, no person is too sacred for the vituperative tongues of these scandal-mongers. They are densely ignorant though they may be fluent talkers. They ingratiate themselves into the confidence of a willing victim, learn the victim's secrets, and rend her to pieces on the next street corner. Many a man has begun wedded life with the laudable intention of helping to mold his young wife's mentality, of preserving her innocence and purity of thought, only to be undone by the evil machinations of these human derelicts. He will be amazed and astonished at the opinions she gives utterance to, and if he does not find out where she is getting them, and check the desecration going on, she will be beyond his reach in the very near future. No self-respecting woman will tolerate such acquaintances. There are, however, many innocent, pure women, who are innately too gentle to assert themselves by insulting another woman at this stage of their experience, who have the makings of a good wife and mother, who wittingly become victims by reason of their very gentleness, and consequently lose their ideals, and drift into failures.  True friendship is necessary. Many men and women rightly attribute their whole success and happiness to having had the right kind of a friend or friends. Charles Kingsley when asked by Mrs. Browning to tell her the secret of his life, said, \"I had a friend,\" A friendship that is not an inspiration, an incentive to higher thoughts and nobler deeds, is not true. \"True friendship demands nothing.\" It gives. We should cultivate the friendship of those who know more than we do, so that we may learn and profit by the relationship. Some people radiate sympathy and helpfulness and inspiration. Instinctively we can tell those people when we come into their presence. We leave them, not once, but always, with the feeling that there is something about them that energizes and inspires. They draw out our better selves. We are conscious of our shortcomings and faults, and in their company we strive to give utterance to worthy thoughts. We feel capable of great deeds. If we could surround ourselves with these friends, we feel that life would mean more, and that we could accomplish much. \"He that walketh with wise men shall be wise.\" This is where true friendship is valuable. These moments of inspiration help us to pull ourselves together. We climb a little higher; we see further and clearer; we learn the meaning of life's duty; they change the whole complexion of living. The little things, the annoyances, the disappointments, the failures, the pains, the sorrows, the passions, we see in their true perspective and they no longer usurp importance, because we are beginning to learn the significance of the things beyond. The incidents of life are no longer life itself.  One friend, one true friend to the young wife, will indeed be a tower of strength to her. Every young wife needs a friend. The desire for sympathy dwells in every human heart. Even the assiduous person needs encouragement and a little praise. It is wonderful how a mite of laudation will prod us to be more worthy. Even our joys never intoxicate save in the telling. By sharing our happiness and joys with another we double them. True friendship means confidence, affection, harmony, love. To be in harmony with one person means that we invite the harmony of all mankind.  If man is made in the image of God every human being must be more or less divine. Confidence, affection, harmony, love,--the attributes of true friendship,--are the divine sparks in our humanity. True friendship, therefore, is growth in the divine sense. There are real things in life which we seldom acknowledge but which are, nevertheless, real. We do not often admit the existence of the divine in ourselves, but it is there. If we did acknowledge it oftener we would live nearer the truth, nearer God.  When we read in the public press the story of the _Titanic_ disaster, how after all the boats had gone, and the ill-fated ship poised, before she took her awful plunge, how the doomed souls stood on her decks and lifted their trembling voices in unison with the brave orchestra to the strain of \"Nearer My God to Thee,\"--something clutches at our heartstrings, and we find the divine reality trying to come to the surface to express itself in that universal friendship out of which heroes are made. When we stand by the bedside, watching the fitful, final breaths of a well-loved child, or of an old, honored and faithful mother, there creeps into our consciousness feelings with which we are strangers, but they are ours, part of the divinity in us which in the work-a-day-world we stifle and crush. Friendship and no other human quality brings this divine element into our actual life. Those who have never had a friend have never solved the riddle of human nature.  We must remember, however, that there are those whose lives are denials of this divinity. They are incapable of true friendship, and they, in prosperous days, deride the sentiment involved and consider any reference to such matters as silly and mawkish. These blustering heroes, however, are the ones who shriek the loudest when fate places them on sinking decks.  Strive to be worthy of a true friendship. Be willing to give of the best that is in you. We need the inspiration of the divine that is hidden in us, we should not crush or fail to acknowledge the presence of the still, small voice that speaks of love and for love. Remember, that, \"By your friends shall ye be known.\"   EXPLANATION OF SYMBOLS  Used in the Following Three Illustrations  [Illustration]  A     Alcoholic--meaning decidedly intemperate, a drunkard.

The family represented is plainly very low grade. It is one of that kind found in every community, growing like rank weeds to menace society. It is small wonder that with production like this permitted criminality springs full-fledged into the world.  [Illustration]  This chart is particularly interesting, showing as it does the marriage of a normal man with, first a normal woman, and subsequently with feeble-minded women. The taint of the feeble mind is inevitable. Whereas the grandchildren by his second marriage appear normal there is always the danger of their progeny being blighted by the taint that is in their blood. The horror of the third marriage is too evident.  [Footnote A: \"Feeble-mindedness; Its Causes and Consequences,\" Goddard, The Macmillan Company.]  MAKING RESOLVES.--In a preceding chapter I remarked, that every human thought, deed, act, prayer, etc., must conform to certain laws, if by their use we desired to achieve results. We know this is true, but we do not always obey the rule, and in the end we wonder why we are failures.  Psychology has formulated laws, based upon actual experiment, regulating every department of mental endeavor, or every branch of systematized mental achievement. These laws show that there are fixed rules, by which mental effort is regulated, systematized and classified, and that the human mind conforms to these laws even when working in ignorance of them. No matter how we may deduce facts, or reason from analogy, we obey fundamental principles.  In a recent magazine article I read the following:       \"This is my own story of why and how I rose, fell and rose      again. It would not be told but for the fact that I have      learned by an Experience mixed with some bitterness, that all      such things are governed by fixed business laws and rules and      move always in obedience to them. There is as I know, a law of      failure and a law of success. There is even a law of      mediocrity. Every man is controlled by that one of these three      laws which he elects to invoke and to follow.\"       \"The laws themselves are fixed and unchanging; man is the only      variable unit in the equation. He succeeds, he fails or he      slumps into mediocrity according to the law with which he      voluntarily or by predisposition puts himself in harmony. This      is my belief, based on my own adventures with these laws and my      observation of other men who have dined and lived with them on      intimate, though not always friendly, terms.\"  This was written by a successful business man in an article reviewing the \"ups and downs\" of his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25049"],["title","My Reminiscences of the Anglo-Boer War (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net      [Transcriber's note: Obvious printer's errors have been corrected, all other inconsistencies are as in the original.

PREFACE.   General Ben Viljoen, while engaged on this work, requested me to write a short introduction to it. This request I gladly comply with.  General Viljoen was a prisoner-of-war at Broadbottom Camp, St. Helena, where, after two years' service in South Africa, I was stationed with my regiment. It was at the General's further request that I conveyed this work to Europe for publication.  The qualities which particularly endeared this brave and justly-famous Boer officer to us were his straightforwardness and unostentatious manner, his truthfulness, and the utter absence of affectation that distinguishes him. I am certain that he has written his simple narrative with candour and impartiality, and I feel equally certain, from what I know of him, that this most popular of our late opponents has reviewed the exciting episodes of the War with an honesty, an intelligence, and a humour which many previous publications on the War have lacked.  During his stay at St. Helena I became deeply attached to General Viljoen; and in conclusion I trust that this work, which entailed many hours of labour, will yield him a handsome recompense.

In offering my readers my reminiscences of the late War, I feel that it is necessary to ask their indulgence and to plead extenuating circumstances for many obvious shortcomings.  It should be pointed out that the preparation of this work was attended with many difficulties and disabilities, of which the following were only a few:--       (1) This is my first attempt at writing a book, and as a      simple Afrikander I lay no claim to any literary ability.       (2) When captured by the British forces I was deprived of      all my notes, and have been compelled to consult and depend      largely upon my memory for my facts and data. I would wish      to add, however, that the notes and minutiæ they took from      me referred only to events and incidents covering six months      of the War. Twice before my capture, various diaries I had      compiled fell into British hands; and on a third occasion,      when our camp at Dalmanutha was burned out by a      \"grass-fire,\" other notes were destroyed.       (3) I wrote this book while a prisoner-of-war, fettered, as      it were, by the strong chains with which a British \"parole\"      is circumscribed. I was, so to say, bound hand and foot, and      always made to feel sensibly the humiliating position to      which we, as prisoners-of-war on this island, were reduced.      Our unhappy lot was rendered unnecessarily unpleasant by the      insulting treatment offered us by Colonel Price, who      appeared to me an excellent prototype of Napoleon's      custodian, Sir Hudson Lowe. One has only to read Lord      Rosebery's work, \"The Last Phase of Napoleon,\" to realise      the insults and indignities Sir Hudson Lowe heaped upon a      gallant enemy.  We Boers experienced similar treatment from our custodian, Colonel Price, who appeared to be possessed with the very demon of distrust and who conjured up about us the same fantastic and mythical plans of escape as Sir Hudson Lowe attributed to Napoleon. It is to his absurd suspicions about our safe custody that I trace the bitterly offensive regulations enforced on us.  While engaged upon this work, Colonel Price could have pounced down upon me at any moment, and, having discovered the manuscript, would certainly have promptly pronounced the writing of it in conflict with the terms of my \"parole.\"  I have striven as far as possible to refrain from criticism, except when compelled to do so, and to give a coherent story, so that the reader may easily follow the episodes I have sketched. I have also endeavoured to be impartial, or, at least, so impartial as an erring human being can be who has just quitted the bloody battlefields of a bitter struggle.  But the sword is still wet, and the wound is not yet healed.  I would assure my readers that it has not been without hesitation that I launch this work upon the world. There have been many amateur and professional writers who have preceded me in overloading the reading public with what purport to be \"true histories\" of the War. But having been approached by friends to add my little effort to the ponderous tomes of War literature, I have written down that which I saw with my own eyes, and that which I personally experienced. If seeing is believing, the reader may lend credence to my recital of every incident I have herein recounted.  During the last stages of the struggle, when we were isolated from the outside world, we read in newspapers and other printed matter captured from the British so many romantic and fabulous stories about ourselves, that we were sometimes in doubt whether people in Europe and elsewhere would really believe that we were ordinary human beings and not legendary monsters. On these occasions I read circumstantial reports of my death, and once a long, and by no means flattering, obituary (extending over several columns of a newspaper) in which I was compared to Garibaldi, \"Jack the Ripper,\" and Aguinaldo. On another occasion I learned from British newspapers of"]]]
