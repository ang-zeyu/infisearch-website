This is the duty we owe to God. (_b_) Again, God being our merciful Preserver, we have to seek the protection of Him and Him alone. This is the duty we owe to ourselves. (_c_) Finally, God being our Judge or Ruler, we have to solicit guidance of Him and Him alone. This is the duty we owe to our fellow-creatures (including lower animals) in the world we live in.  You must not fall into the error of believing that God is Creator at one time or place, that He is Maintainer or Preserver at another time or place, and that He is Judge or Ruler at a third time or place. No, no; He, being the One and only God, is all the three together, Creator, Preserver and Ruler, at all times and in all places. It is we who, in order to understand Him properly and adore Him rightly, separate in our minds His three principal attributes, and think of Him as our Creator _when_ we worship Him, think of Him as our Preserver _when_ we seek His protection, and think of Him as our Ruler or Judge _when_ we solicit His guidance. It is only we, finite and conditioned creatures, that are tied down to and limited by time, place and circumstances. To God there are none such. He is the One Infinite and Absolute, the One who hath neither beginning nor end--the One who is absolutely unlimited and unconditioned by time, place, circumstances, or anything else. This is the Islamic conception or idea of God.  _3rdly_.--What does the Sura teach us as to the guidance which we have to ask of God in our dealings with our fellow-creatures? It is guidance into the straight path. What is the straight path? It is the path of righteousness or the path of _Grace_ which is between two extremes, the path of _Sin_ and the path of _Error_. A Muslim's right path, _i.e._, his right course of conduct, lies between two extreme paths or courses of conduct, _viz._, on the one hand, the path of those who sin, who knowingly and deliberately go against the will of God, which is manifest in Nature, and on the other hand, the path of those who unwittingly, through ignorance, go against His will. The right path lies thus:--   _Path of Sin_ }  _Path of Grace_  {  _Path of Error_               }                   { which leads   }  which leads to   {   which leads to to ruin or    }  eternal bliss.   {   confusion worse destruction.  }                   {   confounded.  You thus see that _true_ Islam consists in a threefold duty to God, to oneself, and to others, and this duty is to be discharged by simply adopting, under God's guidance, _the mean between two extremes_. As our Prophet has pithily expressed it [Arabic: khair ul umoor-e ausatiha], \"the best of things is the medium thing.\" This is the fundamental principle which underlies everything which is Islamic or Muslim.[26] Please remember it, as also the three-fold Islamic Duty:--    (_a_) Duty to God, which is Worship or Adoration implying,           as it does, complete submission to His will = [Arabic:           islām]    (_b_) Duty to yourself, which is self-preservation or           self-perfection = [Arabic: Aslām]    (_c_) Duty to others, which is peace and good will towards           them = [Arabic: islām]  \"Islam\"[27] as a religion means nothing more nor less than those three duties.  Islam is not Philosophy, much less is it Science. It is but a Religion, _an attitude of man's mind towards his environment_--the attitude of self towards others and God. Both Philosophy and Science influence one's attitude of mind. To that extent Islam has to reckon with both. It is therefore that Sufis and other philosophic sects have risen in Islam from time to time. The sphere of Islam is Faith manifesting itself in good works; and the spheres of Science and Philosophy are Knowledge and Reason. The latter often come into contact with the former, but can never be identified with it.     +Note 5.+  _What is not Islam._   In my previous Note I tried to sketch briefly what is true Islam. I now offer a few observations on, or illustrations of, what is _not_ Islam. In order to know anything quite well, it is desirable not only to know _what it is_ but also to know _what it is not_.  1. The religion taught by the Qur'an and the Traditions [Arabic: ahādith] of our Prophet is _Islam_ and not \"Muhammadanism,\" as it is often named. Those who profess Islam are _Muslims_ and not \"Muhammadans,\" as they are called. The word \"Musalman\" is but a corruption of the Arabic plural [Arabic: muslimūn/muslimīn] of the singular [Arabic: Muslim]. We and our religion have been called[28] after the name of Muhammad just as the terms Christians and Christianity have been derived from the name Christ. But \"Muhammadanism\" and \"Muhammadans\" are not at all the correct names of \"Islam\" and \"Muslims\" as you will presently see.[29]   2. From the point of view of Islam, all religions may be divided thus:                      Religions are either,                               |               |---------------|---------------|               |                               | _False_: being beliefs}          {_True_: being beliefs in more gods than     } or       {in one and only God; one,                  }          {and True Religions (Paths of Sin)        }          {are either,                                       |                            +----------|----------+                            |                     |                  _Pure_, such as    }    {_Mixed_, such as                   true Islam        }    {religions which                   unmixed with any  }    {mix up inconsistent                   inconsistent      } or {ideas with                   ideas.            }    {the idea of                                     }    {one God.                   (Paths of Grace)  }    {(Paths of Error)  Observe that a pure Religion, such as true Islam, comes in between false Religions and mistaken or mixed Religions, just as the Quranic Path of Grace lies between the Path of Sin and the Path of Error. It is the mean between two extremes.  3. It is not Islam to believe that there has been no true religion besides Islam.[30] Such an erroneous belief leads to intolerance, thereby begetting bigotry and fanaticism [Arabic: taa'ssub]. It is contrary to the teaching of the Qur'an and the Prophet. The first verse of the second Sura [Arabic: Baqrah = ʾ-l-m] commands us to believe in not only what was revealed to Muhammad but also in what was revealed to those who went before him. It clearly indicates that there are, and will ever be, many true religions of which Islam is one. Almost the first saying of our Prophet reported in collections of his traditions [Arabic: ahaadith] is \"whoever says 'there is no god but God,' will attain Salvation\" _i.e._, will obtain eternal bliss. This shews clearly that all religions which inculcate belief in one God are true religions--are right Paths of Grace which lead to eternal bliss. Observe that most Muhammadans (not Muslims) of to-day have forgotten this principle and have therefore become intolerant fanatics,[31] which accounts largely for the loss of political power of most Muhammadan Governments of modern times.  4. Neither is it Islam to believe that all religions are true. Such an erroneous belief leads to indifference, thereby begetting caprice and impiety. It is obviously contrary to the teaching of the Qur'an and the Prophet, for they both denounce many a false religion. If everybody thinks that every religion is true, there will be no two men professing the same religion, and there will be no real agreement between their thoughts and actions. Co-operation[32] [Arabic: ittifāq wa ittihād] among men (which is the root of Family, Society and State) would tend to become impossible. Note that it is the indifference to religion and the consequent impiety of some of the Muhammadans of to-day that accounts mostly for their lack of co-operation, and for their loss of political power in modern times. Degradation is the lot of _faithless_ Muslims, for as the Qur'an says, \"Ye will be exalted only if ye be faithful Muslims.\"  From what has been said you can easily infer that we should adopt the mean between two extremes and must therefore believe that neither are all religions true nor are they all false, but that _some religions_ are true and that Islam is one of them. The characteristic mark of true religions is belief in one God; and this indeed is the reason why Muslims are permitted to eat and live with, and even marry, Jewesses, Christians and others who believe in one God and possess sacred Scriptures.  5. I, for one, would not hesitate to call all Monotheists (Jews, Christians, and other Unitarians [Arabic: muwahiddin]) _Muslims_, because they believe in one God: but I would not call them _Momins_ [Arabic: Momins,], because they do not believe in one God in accordance with the teaching of our Prophet. You know that our Creed [Arabic: kalimah] consists of two parts:--     (i) There is no god but God,   (ii) And Muhammad is His Messenger.  Those who believe in the first part are Muslims ([Arabic: Muslim ] = the peaceful)[33] and those who believe in the first as well as the second part of the Creed are Momins ([Arabic: Mumins ] = the faithful). Both Muslims and Momins are believers in one God; the only difference between them is that Muslims may not (like Momins) accept Muhammad as their guide in the belief. The Qur'an (iii. 83) defines Islam thus:--    Say ye; We believe in God, and that which hath been sent   down (revealed) to us, and that which hath been sent down   to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25254"],["title","Notes on Islam (#3)"],["body","and Ismail and Issac and Jacob and the tribes;   and that which hath been given to Moses and to Jesus and   that which was given to the Prophets from their Lord. No   difference do we make between them--and to God we are   resigned (Muslims).  6. \"There is no deity but God.\" Since God is One, His Revelation to Man cannot be other than one and the same for all time. There has therefore been and will ever be but one true religion. That religion is Islam. [Arabic: ʾinna d-dīna ʿinda llāhi l-ʾislām] \"Verily the (only) religion with God is Islam\" (Q. iii 19). All the prophets from Adam to Muhammad received but one and the same Revelation and therefore preached Islam and Islam only. [Arabic: ḏālika d-dīnu l-qayyim] \"It was (and is) the standard religion\"--Q. xii. 40.[34]  Whenever any people went astray and deserted Islam for idolatry a prophet arose among them to preach Islam and bring them back to righteousness.[35] Each prophet or messenger of God did nothing but try to restore the universal religion to its pristine simplicity and purity.  It was only in interpreting the Revelation and applying it to the practical needs of their age, that successive prophets and their followers differed; and the differences gave rise to the so-called _religions_ and religious systems of the world.     +Note 6.+  _\"Islam\" and \"not-Islam\"._   I must devote this Note also to my observations on \"Islam\" and \"not-Islam\" in order to prepare you for a just appreciation of my contention that there are many good religions in the world but Islam is the best of them[36].  1. The Prophet Muhammad lived and died more than thirteen hundred years ago. There are now on the face of the earth no less than 250 millions (= 25 crores) of human beings who profess his religion, and who love and respect him just as his own immediate followers loved and respected him. These two simple facts are enough to prove--    (1) that there must be something real and       true in the religion professed by so many       people, and    (2) that the man who preached and established       it must have been both great and       good to an extraordinary degree;  for common experience leads us to conclude (_a_) that nothing which is false or unreal can survive centuries of change and (_b_) that none who is not good and great can be loved and respected by millions of men. No Muslim or Momin need therefore believe in any thing more than:--    (i) that Islam is a real and true religion, and    (ii) that Muhammad was a very great and good man.[37]  Thus, your belief in one God [Arabic: lā ʾilāha ʾillālāh] makes you a Muslim[38] (= _peaceful_), no matter by what other name you call yourself; and your belief in the goodness and greatness[39] of Muhammad [Arabic: Muhammad rasūlullah] makes you a Mumin (= _faithful_), no matter by what name others may call you. Let me quote here a passage from Sir Edwin Arnold's Preface to his beautiful poem \"The Pearls of Faith: the Ninety-Nine Names of Allah:\" [Arabic: asmāʾu l-ḥusnā]  \"The soul of Islam is its declaration of the _unity_ of God: its heart is the inculcation of an absolute _resignation_ to His will. Not more sublime, in religious history appears the figure of Paul the tent-maker, proclaiming 'the Unknown God' at Athens, than that of the camel-driver Muhammad, son of Abdullah and Amina, abolishing all the idols of the Arabian Pantheon, except their chief--Allahu ta 'Ala, God the Most High--and under that ancient and well-received appellation establishing _the one-ness of the origin, government, and life of the Universe_. Thereby that marvellous and gifted Teacher created a vast empire of new belief and new civilization, and prepared a sixth part of humanity for the _developments and reconciliations_ which later times will bring. For Islam must be conciliated; it cannot be thrust scornfully aside or rooted out. It shares the task of the education of the world with its sister religions, and it will contribute its eventual portion to    --\"that far-off divine event   Towards which the whole creation moves.\"  The _italics_ are mine. I shall have to refer to them in my subsequent Notes. Observe, the cosmopolitan poet uses only the word \"Islam\" and not \"Muhammadanism\".  2. It is not Islam or Eman [Arabic: īmān] to deify Muhammad or to represent him to be akin to God, as sometimes some Moulvies represent him and call him \"the One (Ahad) in the guise of Ahmad[40].\" Our Prophet himself never claimed that he was anything more than a mere man. Indeed, he taught us all to say [Arabic: Ash-hadu allā ilāha illallāh, wa Ash-hadu anna Muhammadan rasūlullāh] that he was but \"a servant and messenger of God.\" The only thing he ever claimed for himself was that God had chosen him to be a messenger [Arabic: rasūl = payghambar] to convey His messages to men. \"That an immense mass of fable and silly legend,\" says Rodwell, \"has been built up upon the basis of the Qur'an, is beyond a doubt; but for this Muhammad is not answerable,[41] any more than he is for the wild and bloodthirsty excesses of his followers in after ages.\"  3. God's messages which Muhammad delivered to men were all collected soon after his death and are preserved intact in a remarkable book called the QUR'AN--a book which has lived through no less than thirteen centuries without undergoing the least alteration in a single word or even a dot! The difference in the messages contained in the Qur'an and the ordinary sayings of the Prophet reported in books on Hadis [Arabic: hadith] is simply this:--that when delivering God's messages Muhammad himself felt, and those who were in his company witnessed, that he was inspired by some divine energy or power which impelled him to say what he said; whereas at other times, when he was talking like an ordinary man, no signs of divine energy or inspiration were visible. It will carry me too far if I endeavour to explain here the real nature of \"the divine inspiration\" under which he delivered what he and others believed to be \"divine messages\". You will understand it if you read such books as Professor James's _Varieties of Religious Experience_. Let us, like good Momins, take it as a _fact_, what our Prophet's intimate companions [Arabic: ṣḥābah] vouched, that he appeared to be quite a different man when he uttered such messages. Their style or matter itself even to this day proves to all unbiassed minds that they are no ordinary sayings of an ordinary man. There is something unique in them which we can only feel but cannot define or express in words. Even historians and biographers like Gibbon and Muir and translators like Rodwell, Palmer and Lane-Poole are obliged, in spite of themselves, to admit and admire, what some of them call, the rugged grandeur and eloquence of the Qur'an. Even Sale says that some passages are really sublime.  4. We call the Qur'an _the word of God_, chiefly because it contains messages of high spiritual value delivered by _an illiterate man_ like Muhammad. It is neither a history like some of the books of the Old Testament, nor a biography like the four Gospels of the Bible. It is only a collection of sermons, commands, and instructions delivered and issued from time to time as occasions required. It contains, indeed, references to stories of older Prophets and previous events well known to the people of Arabia. But they are less by way of narration than by way of illustration. They are parables more or less ([Arabic: tilka l-ʾamṯālu naḍribuhā li-n-nās])[42]. Commentators like Zamakh-shari ([Arabic: tafsīr-e-kashshāf]) and Imam Razi ([Arabic: tafsīr-e-kabīr]) whose learning and authority cannot be questioned, have clearly proved that there is nothing in the Qur'an which is improbable or cannot be rationally explained to be quite in accordance with the laws of Nature [Arabic: qanun-u qadat]. If you read Sir Syed Ahmad's Commentary [Arabic: tafsir ahmadi] or his Essays [Arabic: khutbāt] you will find rational explanations of the ideas of Paradise and Hell, the Day of Judgment,[43] etc. I need not dwell on them here. I would however draw your attention to what is called the rule of \"Parsimony in Thought\" which is in vogue among men of Science. It is that if and when you can explain anything by what is well-known and understood by every one, you should not believe in the existence of \"supermen\" or assume the occurrence of supernatural events. When, for example, we can explain any action of Muhammad as an ordinary action of a reasonable man, we should not assume or believe that he performed a miracle. If we can explain the defeat and discomfiture of Abraham's Army by natural causes, such as an epidemic, we ought not to assume the occurrence of any supernatural event[44].  5. The Qur'an does not favour any particular system of Philosophy. It leaves Muslims free to adopt any system of thought that commends itself to them, provided that it is not inconsistent with the ([Arabic: tawhīd]) idea of the one eternal and absolute God. Thus the Qur'an confines itself to the sphere of religion--the sphere where man is brought face to face with his God.    (a) _What, then, is the object or aim of the Qur'an?_  To reveal a man unto himself. [Arabic: mun arafa nafsa hu arafa rabba hu] (He who has understood himself has understood his God.)    (b) _Why should a man be revealed unto himself?_  In order that he might know his true relation with the rest of the world so that he might shape his conduct accordingly _i.e._, be true to himself, true to others, and true to his God in thoughts, words, and deeds.    (c) _How does the Qur'an reveal a man unto himself?_  By showing him:--    (1) God in History[45] ([Arabic: huwa l-ʾawwalu wa-l-ʾāḫir]   He is the First and the Last.)    (2) God in Nature[46] ([Arabic: wa-ẓ-ẓāhir] He is the   Manifest.)    (3) God in Man's Conscience[47] ([Arabic: wa-l-bāṭin] and   He is the Hidden--Qur'an lvii. 3.)  In this sense the Qur'an is truly a revelation!    His sign is in all things, | * [Arabic: fa fi kulli"]]]
