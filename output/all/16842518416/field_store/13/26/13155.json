In vain he sweeps his flukes with fearful strokes from side to side--the bull-dogs of the sea come not within their range; in vain he tries to 'sound'--there is a devil on each side of his jaws, their cruel teeth fixed firmly into his huge lips; perhaps two or three are underneath him tearing and riving at the great rough corrugations of his grey-white belly; whilst others, with a few swift, vertical strokes of their flukes, draw back for fifty feet or so, charge him amidships, and strike him fearful blows on the ribs with their bony heads. Round and round, in ever-narrowing circles as his strength fails, the tortured humpback swims, sometimes turning on his back or side, but failing, failing fast.  “'He's done for, lads. Pull up; stand up, Jim.'  “The boat dashes up, and Jim, the man who is pulling bow oar, picks up his harpoon. A minute later it flies from his hand, and is buried deep into the body of the quivering animal, cutting through the thick blubber as a razor would cut through the skin of a drum.  “'Stern all!' and the harpooner tumbles aft and grips the steer oar, and the steersman takes his place in the head of the boat and seizes his keen-edged lance. But 'humpy' is almost spent, and though by a mighty effort he 'ups flukes' and sounds, he soon rises, for the killers thrust him upwards to the surface again. Then the flashing lance--two, three swift thrusts into his 'life' a gushing torrent of hot, dark blood, and he rolls oyer on his side, an agonised trembling quivers through his vast frame, the battle is oyer and his life is gone.  “And now comes the curious and yet absolutely truly described final part that the killers play in this ocean tragedy. They, the moment the whale is dead, close around him, and fastening their teeth into his body, by main strength bear it to the bottom. Here--if they have not already accomplished it--they tear out the tongue, and eat about one-third of the blubber. In from thirty-six to forty hours the carcase will again rise to the surface, and as, before he was taken down, the whalemen haye attached a line and buoy to the body, its whereabouts are easily discerned from the look-out on the headland; the boats again put off and tow it ashore to the trying-out works. The killers, though they haye had their fill of blubber, accompany the boats to the head of the bay and keep off the sharks, which would otherwise strip off all the remaining blubber from the carcase before it had reached the shore. But once the boats are in the shallow water, the killers stop, and then with a final 'puff! puff!' of farewell to their human friends, turn and head seaward to resume their ceaseless watch and patrol of the ocean.  “The killers never hurt a man. Time after time haye boats been stove in or smashed into splinters by a whale, either by an accidental blow from his head or a sudden lateral sweep of his monstrous flukes, and the crew left struggling in the water or clinging to the oars and pieces of wreckage; and the killers have swum up to, looked at, and smelt them, but never have they touched a man with intent to do him harm. And wherever the killers are, the sharks are not, for Jack Shark dreads a killer as the devil is said to dread holy water. Sometimes I have seen 'Jack' make a rush in between the killers, and rip off a piece of hanging blubber, but he will carefully watch his chance to do so.”    *             *             *             *             *  One of the most experienced whaling masters of New Bedford, with whom the writer once cruised from the Gilbert Islands to Tap in the Western Carolines, told him that on one occasion when he was coming from the shore to his ship, which was lying to off the Chatham Islands, the boat was followed by a pack of five killers. They swam within touch of the oars, much to the amusement of the crew, and presently several of what are called “right whale” porpoises made their appearance, racing along ahead of the boat, whereupon Captain Allen went for'ard and picked up a harpoon, for the flesh of this rare variety of porpoise is highly prized. The moment he struck the fish it set off at a great rate, but not quick enough to escape the killers, for though the porpoise was much the swifter fish (were it loose), the weight of the boat and fifty fathoms of line was a heavy handicap. As quickly as possible the men began hauling up to the stricken fish so that Allen might give it the lance, when to their astonishment the killers seized it and literally tore it to pieces in a few minutes.  “If ever I felt mad enough to put an iron into a 'killer' it was then,”  he said, “but I couldn't do it. And very glad of it I was afterwards, for a week later I had two boats stove in by a whale, and of course, had I hurt one of those beggars of killers, the whole crew would have said it was only a just retribution.”     “REVENGE”  On that fever-stricken part of the coast of the great island of New Britain, lying between the current-swept headland of Gape Stephens and the deep forest-clad shores of Kabaira Bay, there is a high grassy bluff dotted here and there with isolated coco-palms leaning northward to the sea beneath, their broad branches restlessly whipping and bending to the boisterous trade wind. On the western side of the bluff there is a narrow strip of littoral, less than half a mile in width, and thickly clothed with a grove of betel nut, through which the clear waters of a mountain stream flow swiftly out oceanwards across a rocky bar.  Near where the margin of the grove of straight, grey-boled betels touch the steep side of the bluff, there may be seen the outline of a low wall of coral stones, forming three sides of a square, and bound and knit together with vines, creepers, and dank, ill-smelling moss--the growth, decay, and re-growth of three score years. The ground which it encloses is soft and swampy, for the serried lines of betel-trees, with their thick, broad crowns, prevent either sun or wind from penetrating to the spot, and the heavy tropical rains never permit it to dry. It is a dark, dismal-looking place, only visited by the savage inhabitants when they come to collect the areca-nuts, and its solitude is undisturbed save by the flapping of the hornbill's wings as he carries food to his imprisoned mate, or the harsh screech of a white cockatoo flying overhead to the mountain forest beyond.  Yet sixty years ago it was not so, for then on the shore facing the bar stood a native village, and within the now rained wall were the houses of three white men, who from their doorways could see the blue Pacific, and the long curve of coast line with cape and headland and white line of reef stretching away down to the westward in the misty tropic haze.  Walk inside the old, broken walls, and you will see, half-buried in the moist, steaming, and malarious ground, some traces of those who dwelt there--a piece of chain cable, two or three whaler's trypots, a rotten and mossgrown block or two, only the hardwood sheaves of which have resisted the destroying influences of the climate; a boat anchor, and farther towards the creek, the mouldering remains of a capstan, from the drumhead holes of which long grey-green pendants of moss droop down upon the weather-worn, decaying barrel, like the scanty ragged beard that falls on the chest of some old man worn out with poverty and toil.  That is all that one may see now; for the dense, evergrowing jungle has long since hidden or rotted all else that was left.    *             *              *             *             *  The three men were named Ford, Adams, and Stenhouse. They were _beche-de-mer_ fishers, and for nearly a year had been living in this savage spot--the only white men inhabiting the great island, whose northern coast line sweeps in an irregular half-moon curve for more than three hundred miles from Cape Stephens to within sight of the lofty mountains of New Guinea. In pursuit of their avocation, death from disease, or from the spears or clubs of the treacherous, betel-chewing, stark-naked cannibals among whom they dwelt was ever near, but to the men of their iron resolution and dauntless courage that mattered not. Two years' labour meant for them a large sum of money--enough to enable them to return with their wives and families and native dependents, to those more restful islands in the Western Carolines whence they had come a year before.  All three men were employed by one firm in Singapore, whose ship had brought them with their families and some thirty or forty natives of Yap to New Britain. Nine months after their landing, a small schooner had called to replenish their supplies, and ship the cured trepang, which by the most assiduous labour and daring enterprise they had accumulated; and when this story opens, the schooner had been gone some weeks, and they and their native workers were preparing their boats for another cruise along the great barrier reef of New Britain.  Two of these men, Adams and Stenhouse, were old and tried comrades, and in their rough way, devoted to each other. Stenhouse, the elder of the two, had some ten years previously, while sailing along the Pelew Island, found Adams adrift in an open boat--the sole survivor of a shipwrecked crew of sixteen men, and had nursed him back to life and reason. Later on, Adams had married one of Stenhouse's half-caste daughters.

I propose here to describe the other German. At a military hospital a lady visitor said to the wounded soldiers: “We’ve had lots of books and tales of horror; why don’t some of you fellows prepare a book of the good deeds of the enemy?” There was a slight pause. “Ah,” said one of the soldiers, “that would be a golden book.” Very imperfectly, and in spite of all the barriers raised by war passions, I have tried to collect some of the materials already to hand for such a book.  In any quarrel it is difficult to recognise that there is good in one’s opponent. Yet in order that any strife may be wisely settled, this recognition is plainly necessary. Mere enmity, without recognition of good, belongs to primitive barbarism. It was against the foolish unpracticality of this older barbarism (not surely only against its wickedness) that Christ protested in the words, “But I say unto you, love your enemies.” He saw around him the folly and unenlightenment of the perpetual feud. I have collected the testimonies that are in the following pages because such facts seem to me to need wider recognition, if we are ever to gain an outlook upon a fairer and a truer world.  If my desire for peace has anywhere shown itself unduly, or in a way irritating to others, I ask forgiveness. Whenever peace is made, the world will need a peace built on all the facts of human nature. I have tried to give here some of those which war passions inevitably obscure. That is the whole of my task.                                                HAROLD PICTON.   _September, 1918._       FOOTNOTES:      [Footnote 1: With the exception of a few minor insertions the     whole of this book was compiled, and the preface written, before     Peace came. It seemed, however, that it might only be harmful if     published then. I, therefore, kept the book back, but, as the     wording expressed my feeling as I wrote, I have left it     unchanged.]                         The Better Germany in War Time                                    I.                            MILITARY PRISONERS.   The cases of bad treatment of prisoners in Germany have been made known very widely. No one, I imagine, can wish to defend bad treatment of prisoners anywhere (even of criminal prisoners), and such a horrible state of things as that of Wittenberg during the typhus epidemic is a disgrace to human nature.  But Mr. Lithgow Osborne says: “My whole impression of the camp authorities at Wittenberg was utterly unlike that which I have received in every other camp I have visited in Germany.” (Miscel. 16, 1916, p. 6). I propose to give some account of these other camps. I shall not exclude adverse criticism, but as the public have heard little but such criticism, I do not think it will be unfair to deal in these pages more fully with the favourable reports.   LETTERS FROM OFFICERS AND OTHERS.  The following letter from a British Officer appeared in the _Times_ of December 30, 1914. It may well serve as an introduction and a caution:      I do not doubt Private O’Sullivan’s wonderful experience as a     prisoner, but his is, I am sure, only an isolated case, and not     at all the usual treatment to which British prisoners are     subjected. I can speak from experience, as I, too, was a     prisoner (wounded), but afterwards released, as the building in     which I was, along with several German wounded, was captured by     the British. During the time I was with the Germans they treated     me with every consideration. Food was scarce, owing to the fact     that the roads were so well shelled by our artillery that their     transport could not come up; but they shared their food with me.     They also dressed my wound with the greatest care, and in every     way made me as comfortable as possible. Being able to speak a     little German, I talked to the other wounded, and found that     their papers also published dreadful tales of our treatment of     prisoners, which I am glad to say I was able to refute.      I am, Sir, yours faithfully,                                           A BRITISH OFFICER.       December 27.  I would especially call the attention of fair-minded men to the last sentences.  Here is a letter written by Second-Lieut. F. Phillips Pearce (aged 18) of the 2nd Essex Regiment, from Crefeld on October 27, and printed in the _Times_ of November 19, 1914:      We are treated very well indeed here. We have good beds and     fires in the rooms, three good meals a day, and a French soldier     for a servant, and this morning I had a splendid hot bath. We     have roll call twice a day, at 8 a.m. and 9.45 p.m., and lights     out at 10.45, and we have a large courtyard to walk about in. We     have a canteen here where we can buy clothes and anything we     want. Prison fare is very good—new rolls and coffee and fresh     butter. Not bad! I had a very decent guard when I was coming up     on the train; he got me food, and when one man tried to get in     to attack me he threw him off the train. I am afraid I am out of     the firing line until the war ends (worse luck). I am in no     danger of being shot unless I try to bolt, which I shan’t do. I     shot the man who was carrying their colours, and he wanted to     have me shot, but luckily nobody seemed to agree with him. The     next time I saw him he had been bandaged up—he was shot through     the shoulder—and he dashed up and shook me by the hand and     shouted, “Mein Freund, mein Freund.”  On November 25 other letters appeared in the _Times_. One was from a cavalry subaltern in a German fortress:      You ask about money; they provide lights and firing and all the     men’s food. The officers get 16s. a week and buy their own.     Quite sufficient, as it is cheap. I have learnt German fairly     quickly and do interpreter now in the shop for the men, though,     I am afraid, _tant mal que bien_. One of the officials here     used to be a professor, and is very kind trying to teach us.     Thanks for the warm underclothes, and most awfully for the     footballs. We have quite good matches.... It is better not to     try to send any public news of any kind from England; people     having been stupid trying to smuggle letters in cakes and     things, and it only makes trouble for everyone.  A Captain writes:      For dinner at 1 p.m. we are given soup, meat and vegetables....     Supper takes place at 7 o’clock and consists of tea, sausages or     meat and potatoes.... We receive £5 a month as pay, of which 1s.     6d. is deducted for food each day. We have a canteen here at     which we can buy everything we want, ... so there is no need to     send me anything at all, except perhaps those small 7d. editions     of novels.  An English lady wrote early in 1915 from Munich:      I must tell you I had permission to visit a wounded English     officer, a cousin, and I think it would reassure many people at     home to know how warmly he"]]]
