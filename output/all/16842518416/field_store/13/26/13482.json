I have to explain to you why I consider Islam[48] the best of the religions that are now professed by men all over the world. Mark, I do not say that other religions are not good, but I only say that Islam is the best religion of all those I know. Why do I say so? Because no other religion accords so well as Islam with the modern ideas of Science.  By applying the adjectives \"good,\" \"better\" and \"best\" to religions, I indicate the _degree_ to which each religion, by its tenets and teaching, induces men to seek their welfare [Arabic: falāh]: and by the word \"Science\" [Arabic: ilm] I mean simply the systematised knowledge of things known and knowable.  _Science_ discovers things that are necessary or desirable for human welfare. _Arts_ generally show the way in which those things can be obtained or manufactured. _Governments_ provide, or ought to provide, facilities for scientific investigation and for improvement in arts. And it is _Religion_ that should move men to take the fullest advantage of the science and arts of the time. You may take a horse to a river but you cannot make him drink unless he is thirsty. If he is thirsty he will drink of his own accord; but if he is not, neither the appearance of clear water, nor the easy way to get at it, nor indeed your whip or coaxing can ever induce him to drink. In the same way Science may show you water or anything that is useful, Arts may show you different ways of getting it, the Government of your State may offer rewards or even threaten punishment; but you will not drink, that is to say, you will not take advantage of the good things shown you and placed at your disposal, unless you are thirsty, unless there is something in you which impels you to it. This thirst, this something that is the moving force or _motive_, is created or furnished by Religion.  The chief use of religion lies in the desire that it fosters in men to live well, and virtuously.[49] It is true that for most men the fear of punishment and the hope of reward, either here or hereafter, are motives for right conduct: and some religions (and even Islam as taught by some Moulvies) give glowing pictures of Heaven and Hell awaiting good and bad people after death.[50] But these motives are unworthy of the higher nature [Arabic: qu wa ye malakūti] of man. They are like the crack of a whip or the show of green grass to a horse that will not run. They are not so effective and lasting as the high spiritual motive for a virtuous life furnished by true religion. I cannot dwell further on this point without entering upon a philosophical or metaphysical discussion which is foreign to the purpose of these Notes. Suffice it to say that the spiritual or religious motive for virtuous conduct is the best of all motives, as it conforms to the higher or angelic [Arabic: malakūti] nature of man and assists him in subduing his lower or animal [Arabic: ba ha'i mi] nature.[51]   \"The son of man is a unique      | and complex product (of          | Evolution) which has combined    | in him the natures of            | [Persian: Aadmi zada turfah m'a both the angel and the beast.    | joo ne ast za fa-rish-ta sa-rish-ta If he leans towards the latter,  | hay wan gar kunad mayl een shuwad his animal nature, he            | wa kum azeen dar kunad qasn falls lower than the beast       | aanshuwad beh azaan.] itself, but if he turns his      | attention to the former, his     | angelic nature, he rises higher  | than the angel himself.\"         |   It is but religion, true Religion, that enables the \"son of man\" _i.e._, mankind to surpass angels in godliness. Note, this is exactly what Sir Oliver Lodge says in his book, _The Substance of Faith allied with Science_.  There is another use of Religion to which I should refer briefly before I pass on to the main argument. You always intend doing many things but never succeed in doing them _all_, either because you change your mind or because somebody or something prevents you from carrying them out. It is nevertheless important to yourself and society that your wishes, which are naturally more numerous than your actions, should be as good as the actions themselves. Laws and social conventions cannot adequately control them, for they take account of only outward manifestations, that is, actions which flow or result from your inward desires, passions and prejudices. These are controlled by such religions as true Christianity and true Islam which take that as done which was merely intended to be done, and inhibit bad intentions even before they appear in action.  Now, whatever religion supplies the best motives for virtuous conduct and most effectively prevents mischievous intentions, must necessarily be one which conforms best with the most approved ideas of the science and arts of the time. I hold that Islam is such a religion.[52]  Let me begin by showing a conformity of Islam to a modern idea, that there are more worlds than one.[53] There are still some religions which assume that there is no other world than the world we live in, and that God created and maintains it for men only. Science has proved that such assumptions are unwarranted, and has even suggested grounds for believing that there are beings in the innumerable worlds of stars. This world of ours with its inhabitants has therefore no right to monopolise God to itself. Nor indeed have we, human beings, any right to consider ourselves as its superior inhabitants. Science is now-a-days on the track of finding out beings who are or who may be superior to man. Note that all this is implied in the expression [Arabic: rabbi l-ʿālamīn] \"the Lord of the _worlds_\" contained in the Sura and other parts of the Qur'an. It does not say \"the king of the _world_\" ([Arabic: rabbi l- ʿālam]) or of _men_ [Arabic: rabbi l- ʾinsān] but says generally and truly that God is the King or Lord of great or grand _worlds_: [Arabic: rabbi l-ʿālamīn], the definite article [Arabic: al] in Arabic is often used to express greatness or grandeur as in the word [Arabic: Allah] which means the Most High God.  According to Islam there are two sources of knowledge, _Science_ and _Revelation_: the one represents man's effort to learn God's ways, and the other represents God's grace to discover His ways to man.[54] I for one believe that the difference between the two sources of knowledge corresponds to the difference between \"Experience\" and \"Intuition,\" between Acquired Ideas and Innate Ideas--a difference which modern philosophers (Spencer and Bergson) consider to be one of degree only and not of kind.     +Note 8.+  _Unity[55] and Union._   I cannot go over the whole field of Muslim theology to show how its ideas are in accord with the scientific thought of our days. I will confine myself to three principles and three maxims implied in the analysis of the Opening Sura [Arabic: Sura al-fātiḥa] given in one of my previous Notes[56].  I. The verse [Arabic: al-ḥamdu li-llāhi rabbi l-ʿālamīn; ar-raḥmāni r-raḥīm] points to _the Principle of Unity_:    There is but one God who created the worlds,   maintains and rules them.  From this results the _Maxim of Union & Loyalty_:    Union is strength = Be loyal to your King.  II. The verse [Arabic: ʾiyyāka naʿbudu wa-ʾiyyāka nastaʿīn] points to _the Principle of Perfection_:    Worship of God, His protection, and guidance   are necessary for the perfection of our   mind and body.  From this results the _Maxim of Self-help_:    God helps those who help themselves = Be   true to yourself.  III. The verse [Arabic: ṣirāṭa llaḏīna ʾanʿamta ʿalayhim ġayri l-maġḍūbi ʿalayhim wa-lā ḍ-ḍāllīn] points to _the Principle of Moderation_:    It is the straight path of righteousness that   enables you to avoid crooked paths of sin   and error and leads you to happiness.  From this results the _Maxim of the Average_:    Adopt the mean of two extremes = Be moderate   in everything.  I will now endeavour to shew, as briefly and as simply as possible, how the principles and maxims I have stated correspond with the best scientific ideas of the present age. By \"the best scientific ideas,\" I mean nothing more than _conclusions_ arrived at by eminent men of science after severe study and prolonged investigation. I can only refer to the conclusions as such without attempting to summarise the reasoning, etc. by which they have been reached. You may read the works of authors I shall name, if you wish to learn more of their thoughts.  I.  _Principle of Unity._  1. The first Principle of Unity [Arabic: tawhīd] implies that there is but one Energy or Force whose different transformations we call _forces_, but one Life whose appearance in different shapes we call _lives_, and but one Mind whose different manifestations we call _minds_. But the universal Energy, the  [Sidenote: 1. Herbert Spencer. 2. Dr. A.R. Wallace. 3. Prof. James. 4. Sir Oliver Lodge. 5. Dr. Theodore Merz.]  universal Life, and the universal Mind[57] [Arabic: rabbi l-ʿālamīn, ar-raḥmāni r-raḥīm, māliki yawmi d-dīn] are themselves but so many forms, appearances or manifestations of the one Being [Arabic: Allah] who is Infinite [Arabic: ṣ-ṣamad] and Absolute [Arabic: lam yalid, wa-lam yūlad]. This is exactly what scientific men and philosophers have said and are saying to-day. Read the works of any of the eminent men mentioned in the margin, and you will find that the conclusion they have reached after life-long investigations, tallies remarkably with the conception of God which Islam formulated centuries ago.  Every child begins with the experience of 'This is _mine_' and 'That is _not mine_.' This experience matures in the adult into \"I\" and \"not-I\"--the _subject_ that knows and the _object_ that is known. We call the _knower_ or subject, Mind; and the _known_ or object,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25254"],["title","Notes on Islam (#5)"],["body","atter. Most modern Philosophers agree in believing that Mind and Matter are but two aspects of One Reality underlying All. Just as a big building like the Falaknuma Palace presents different aspects when viewed from different directions, and yet is one and the same building; so the Reality of Existence _appears to us_ in different aspects as Mind and Matter, and yet is one and the same Reality[58].  Dr. Theodore Merz of the Durham University, at the end of his grand survey of the Scientific Thought of Europe in the 19th Century,[59] says: \"The scientific mind advances from the idea of Order or arrangement to that of Unity through the idea of Continuity.\"  The process adopted by Science of arriving at Unity is only the reverse of what Islam adopted: the former begins _a posteriori_ with Order finds Continuity and arrives at Unity, but the latter started _a priori_ with Unity, passed over Continuity, and found Order, thus:--  _Science._        _Islam._  1. Order        1. Unity = [Arabic: rabbi l-ʿālamīn] = [Arabic: Allah]                            = The Reality[50]                            of which both Mind and Matter                            are different aspects.  2. Continuity   2. Continuity = [Arabic: raḥmāni wa r-raḥīm] = Force                            or Energy.  3. Unity        3. Order[60] = [Arabic: māliki yawmi d-dīn] = Order                            or Process.  What Sir Edwin Arnold calls the soul of Islam, _i.e._, the Principle of Unity, so patently corresponds with the ultimate results of modern Science and Philosophy, that I need not dwell on it at any great length. It is sufficient to point out that Science has now proved three Unities, the Unity of _Substance_, the Unity of _Force_, and the Unity of _Process_; and Philosophy has shown that the three Unities resolve themselves into One Infinite Power.[61]    \"There is no strength (to avoid }   evil) nor ability (to do good)  } [Arabic: La hawla wa la quwwata   great and supreme.\"             } ʾillā bi-llāhi alee-eil aẓīm.]    _Maxim of Union and Loyalty._  2. How is the Maxim of Union and Loyalty inferred from the principle of Unity? Man, being a creature of God, should try to be godly and godlike, try to imitate God in actions, try to co-operate with his fellow creatures for the good of all, and should thus attain the ideal: \"Union is Strength.\" This is the Islamic doctrine of Atonement[62] (= at-one-ment [Arabic: fana fil-lah]): to be _at one_ with God by _union_ and _co-operation_ with God's creatures so far as your and their constitutions and environments allow. But you need not bother yourself with theories at present. It will be enough if you remember that the ultimate aim or the sole object of the Prophet's mission was to establish the universal union and brotherhood of mankind by means of a firm belief in the eternal truth of God's unity. He preached the Unity of God and worked all his life for the union of men into a universal Brotherhood.  In order that you should _co-operate_, _i.e._, work together with your fellow-men for the good of all, your work must needs be _co-ordinated_. It must be guided and directed so that it tallies with the work of others. This guidance and direction comes from your leader, whom you and your fellow-workers must obey, in order to attain the best results. Co-operation thus implies Co-ordination which requires a leader--Caliph or King--whom you ought to follow loyally. _Loyalty to your leader_ is therefore the gist of co-operation. The Qur'an and the Traditions are full of injunctions for obedience to \"those in authority among you\" [Arabic: ʾulī l-ʾamri minkum][63] \"The surest way of pleasing God is to obey the King.\"  Modern Science teaches exactly the same thing. I have a series of little books in my Library called \"People's Books\" published at 6d. each by Messrs. Jack, London. One of them on \"Zoology\" is written by Professor MacBride, F.R.S. He traces the development of Man from Protozoa,--little specks of animalculæ--and points out how each species of animals has risen higher than another by (i) greater \"inventive capacity\", the capacity of adopting new means to an old end and old means to a new end: and (ii) higher \"tribal morality\" implied in co-operation and loyalty to leaders. He says: \"Mankind progresses by the appearance of individuals in whom (besides the inventive genius) the instincts of co-operation and loyalty are more strongly developed\". It is precisely those instincts that Islam fosters by its doctrine of the universal brotherhood of Muslims--a doctrine which implies primarily loyalty to your King. Just as the affairs of a family like yours, consisting of a dozen members, cannot prosper unless each follows loyally the lead of the eldest, or the wisest among you; so the affairs of a nation can never be in a satisfactory condition unless each individual is loyal to his King and country, and co-operates with his Government by willingly doing what is required of him.  Muhammad enjoined [Arabic: utlibul ilm wa lov kaana bis seen] \"Seek knowledge even if thou hast to go for it to China\"--(the farthest country known in his days).    Delve gems of Science divine   Ev'n unto Cathay's mine.  He said that wisdom was the birthright of every Muslim who should seize it wherever he found it. He thus encouraged the learning of Science and the consequent acquirement of inventive capacity which is biologically as essential for human progress as co-operation and loyalty.  A study of animal life from the lowest animalcule to the highly civilized man, teaches us to know, feel and act, in a particular manner, _viz._,  (_a_) to _know_ our environment, _i.e._, to know the       Laws of Nature in order to improve our       general capacity for invention, manufacture       and commerce, (Knowledge)  (_b_) to _feel_ for our fellow-men in order to increase       mutual good-will so necessary for co-operation, (Sympathy)  (_c_) and to _act_ for the general good of our race       under the guidance of our political and social       leaders, (Loyalty).  \"Knowledge, Sympathy and Loyalty\" are thus the watchwords of the Science of to-day no less than of the Islam of our ancestors.[64]     +Note 9.+  _Perfection and Self-help._   Allow me to explain here that my object is not to persuade you to believe what I say but only to make you think for yourself. I will therefore avoid arguments and discussions as much as possible and content myself with bare outlines of certain Islamic doctrines and brief references to the corresponding ideas of modern Science. I shall be very pleased if they serve to excite your curiosity and stimulate your thought.   II.  _Principle of Perfection._  1. The second Muslim doctrine which I have called the Principle of Perfection may be inferred from the second part of the Sura:--It is essential for our perfect development that we should worship God and implore Him for help and guidance in the discharge of the three-fold duty of our life.  No sane man thinks that he is perfect as he is. There is always a feeling of some sort in our mind that somehow, and in some respect or other, we are not as perfect as we should be. It is to remove this feeling of imperfection inherent in us that we have to worship God and supplicate His help and guidance. If you ask: \"Why should I worship God?\" Islam answers your question by asking another: \"Why should you admire beauty in Nature and Art?\" You can answer only: \"Because it is beautiful. I am so constituted that I cannot do otherwise than admire a beautiful object when I see it\". You are unable to give any other reason satisfactorily accounting for your admiration of the beautiful. Islam returns a similar answer to your question: _\"You should worship God because He is God\"._ You, as one of His creatures, cannot help worshipping or reverently adoring Him when you see, at every instant of your life, manifold manifestations of His divine Goodness and Beauty. Some Sufis[55] even go to the extent of identifying God with \"Infinite Beauty\" [Arabic: husn-e azlee] which is the object of their love [Arabic: ishq] and ecstasy [Arabic: wajd].  You remember the verse which every devout Muslim recites when he hears the news of the death of any one: [Arabic: inna lil lahi wa inna ilaihi raji-ūn]    \"Verily we are God's and to Him we shall return\".  This as well as some other verses support the Islamic belief in the re-union of a man's soul with God. As I have mentioned in my previous Note, Islam conceives that there is but one Universal Soul. Small parts--infinitesimal fractions--of the Universal Soul are confined in men's bodies and break free at death to re-join the Whole[56]. This belief is in entire accord with Sir Oliver Lodge's theory (or \"speculation\", as he calls it) put forward in his book, _Faith allied to Science_. Without stopping to enquire how far the belief indicated by Qur'anic verses, or the theory advanced by a man of science, is supported by scientific facts, I would only point out that it gives a clear and intelligible meaning to the word \"worship\" [Arabic: ibadāt]. It is the communion of the fractional soul, which is somehow confined in a man's living body, with the Whole Soul, the Soul of the Universe, to which it--the fractional soul--shall return some day freed from the trammels of the flesh. This \"communion\" [Arabic: ibadāt] includes Adoration [Arabic: tasbīh wa tahlīl] and Prayer [Arabic: du'ā].  I cannot do better than quote Sir Oliver Lodge's admirable description of the meaning and object of Prayer:--    \"In prayer we come into close communion with a Higher than   we know, and seek to contemplate Divine perfection. Its   climax and consummation is attained when we realize the   universal Permeance, the entire Goodness and the Fatherly   Love of the Divine Being.\"    [[Arabic: al-ḥamdu li-llāhi rabbi l-ʿālamīn, ar-raḥmāni   r-raḥīm.]    Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds, compassionate and   merciful, King of the day of Reckoning.]    \"Thro"]]]
