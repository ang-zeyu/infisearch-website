The North Point folk loved flowers. They could not have them about their homes, so they had them in their graveyard. It was a matter of pride with each family to keep the separate plot neatly trimmed and weeded and adorned with beautiful blossoms.  It was one of the unwritten laws of the little community that on some selected day in May everybody would repair to the graveyard to plant, trim and clip. It was not an unpleasant duty, even to those whose sorrow was fresh. It seemed as if they were still doing something for the friends who had gone when they made their earthly resting places beautiful.  As for the children, they looked forward to \"Graveyard Day\" as a very delightful anniversary, and it divided its spring honours with the amount of the herring catch.  \"Tomorrow is Graveyard Day,\" said Minnie Hutchinson at school recess, when all the little girls were sitting on the fence. \"Ain't I glad! I've got the loveliest big white rosebush to plant by Grandma Hutchinson's grave. Uncle Robert sent it out from town.\"  \"My mother has ten tuberoses to set out,\" said Nan Gray proudly.  \"We're going to plant a row of lilies right around our plot,\" said Katie Morris.  Every little girl had some boast to make, that is, every little girl but Freda. Freda sat in a corner all by herself and felt miserably outside of everything. She had no part or lot in Graveyard Day.  \"Are you going to plant anything, Freda?\" asked Nan, with a wink at the others.  Freda shook her head mutely.  \"Freda can't plant anything,\" said Winnie Bell cruelly, although she did not mean to be cruel. \"She hasn't got a grave.\"  Just then Freda felt as if her gravelessness were a positive disgrace and crime, as if not to have an interest in a single grave in North Point cemetery branded you as an outcast forever and ever. It very nearly did in North Point. The other little girls pitied Freda, but at the same time they rather looked down upon her for it with the complacency of those who had been born into a good heritage of family graves and had an undisputed right to celebrate Graveyard Day.  Freda felt that her cup of wretchedness was full. She sat miserably on the fence while the other girls ran off to play, and she walked home alone at night. It seemed to her that she could _not_ bear it any longer.  Freda was ten years old. Four years ago Mrs. Wilson had taken her from the orphan asylum in town. Mrs. Wilson lived just this side of the hill from the graveyard, and everybody in North Point called her a \"crank.\" They pitied any child she took, they said. It would be worked to death and treated like a slave. At first they tried to pump Freda concerning Mrs. Wilson's treatment of her, but Freda was not to be pumped. She was a quiet little mite, with big, wistful dark eyes that had a disconcerting fashion of looking the gossips out of countenance. But if Freda had been disposed to complain, the North Point people would have found out that they had been only too correct in their predictions.  \"Mrs. Wilson,\" Freda said timidly that night, \"why haven't we got a grave?\"  Mrs. Wilson averred that such a question gave her the \"creeps.\"  \"You ought to be very thankful that we haven't,\" she said severely. \"That Graveyard Day is a heathenish custom, anyhow. They make a regular picnic of it, and it makes me sick to hear those school girls chattering about what they mean to plant, each one trying to outblow the other. If I _had_ a grave there, I wouldn't make a flower garden of it!\"  Freda did not go to the graveyard the next day, although it was a holiday. But in the evening, when everybody had gone home, she crept over the hill and through the beech grove to see what had been done. The plots were all very neat and prettily set out with plants and bulbs. Some perennials were already in bud. The grave of Katie Morris' great-uncle, who had been dead for forty years, was covered with blossoming purple pansies. Every grave, no matter how small or old, had its share of promise--every grave except one. Freda came across it with a feeling of surprise. It was away down in the lower corner where there were no plots. It was shut off from the others by a growth of young poplars and was sunken and overgrown with blueberry shrubs. There was no headstone, and it looked dismally neglected. Freda felt a sympathy for it. She had no grave, and this grave had nobody to tend it or care for it.  When she went home she asked Mrs. Wilson whose it was.  \"Humph!\" said Mrs. Wilson. \"If you have so much spare time lying round loose, you'd better put it into your sewing instead of prowling about graveyards. Do you expect me to work my fingers to the bone making clothes for you? I wish I'd left you in the asylum. That grave is Jordan Slade's, I suppose. He died twenty years ago, and a worthless, drunken scamp he was. He served a term in the penitentiary for breaking into Andrew Messervey's store, and after it he had the face to come back to North Point. But respectable people would have nothing to do with him, and he went to the dogs altogether--had to be buried on charity when he died. He hasn't any relations here. There was a sister, a little girl of ten, who used to live with the Cogswells over at East Point. After Jord died, some rich folks saw her and was so struck with her good looks that they took her away with them. I don't know what become of her, and I don't care. Go and bring the cows up.\"  When Freda went to bed that night her mind was made up. She would adopt Jordan Slade's grave.  Thereafter, Freda spent her few precious spare-time moments in the graveyard. She clipped the blueberry shrubs and long, tangled grasses from the grave with a pair of rusty old shears that blistered her little brown hands badly. She brought ferns from the woods to plant about it. She begged a root of heliotrope from Nan Gray, a clump of day lilies from Katie Morris, a rosebush slip from Nellie Bell, some pansy seed from old Mrs. Bennett, and a geranium shoot from Minnie Hutchinson's big sister. She planted, weeded and watered faithfully, and her efforts were rewarded. \"Her\" grave soon looked as nice as any in the graveyard.  Nobody but Freda knew about it. The poplar growth concealed the corner from sight, and everybody had quite forgotten poor, disreputable Jordan Slade's grave. At least, it seemed as if everybody had. But one evening, when Freda slipped down to the graveyard with a little can of water and rounded the corner of the poplars, she saw a lady standing by the grave--a strange lady dressed in black, with the loveliest face Freda had ever seen, and tears in her eyes.  The lady gave a little start when she saw Freda with her can of water.  \"Can you tell me who has been looking after this grave?\" she said.  \"It--it was I,\" faltered Freda, wondering if the lady would be angry with her. \"Pleas'm, it was I, but I didn't mean any harm. All the other little girls had a grave, and I hadn't any, so I just adopted this one.\"  \"Did you know whose it was?\" asked the lady gently.  \"Yes'm--Jordan Slade's. Mrs. Wilson told me.\"  \"Jordan Slade was my brother,\" said the lady. \"He went sadly astray, but he was not all bad. He was weak and too easily influenced. But whatever his faults, he was good and kind--oh! so good and kind--to me when I was a child. I loved him with all my heart. It has always been my wish to come back and visit his grave, but I have never been able to come, my home has been so far away. I expected to find it neglected. I cannot tell you how pleased and touched I am to find it kept so beautifully. Thank you over and over again, my dear child!\"  \"Then you're not cross, ma'am?\" said Freda eagerly. \"And I may go on looking after it, may I? Oh, it just seems as if I couldn't bear not to!\"  \"You may look after it as long as you want to, my dear. I will help you, too. I am to be at East Point all summer. This will be our grave--yours and mine.\"  That summer was a wonderful one for Freda. She had found a firm friend in Mrs. Halliday. The latter was a wealthy woman. Her husband had died a short time previously and she had no children. When she went away in the fall, Freda went with her \"to be her own little girl for always.\" Mrs. Wilson consented grudgingly to give Freda up, although she grumbled a great deal about ingratitude.  Before they went they paid a farewell visit to their grave. Mrs. Halliday had arranged with some of the North Point people to keep it well attended to, but Freda cried at leaving it.  \"Don't feel badly about it, dear,\" comforted Mrs. Halliday. \"We are coming back every summer to see it. It will always be our grave.\"  Freda slipped her hand into Mrs. Halliday's and smiled up at her.  \"I'd never have found you, Aunty, if it hadn't been for this grave,\" she said happily. \"I'm so glad I adopted it.\"     How Don Was Saved   Will Barrie went whistling down the lane of the Locksley farm, took a short cut over a field of clover aftermath and through a sloping orchard where the trees were laden with apples, and emerged into the farmhouse yard where Curtis Locksley was sitting on a pile of logs, idly whittling at a stick.  \"You look as if you had a corner in time, Curt,\" said Will. \"I call that luck, for I want you to go chestnutting up to Grier's Hill with me. I met old Tom Grier on the road yesterday, and he told me I might go any day. Nice old man, Tom Grier.\"  \"Good!\" said Curtis heartily, as he sprang up. \"If I haven't exactly a corner in time, I have a day off, at least. Uncle doesn't need me today. Wait till I whistle for Don. May as well take him with us.\"  Curtis whistled accordingly, but Don, his handsome Newfoundland dog, did not appear. After calling and whistling about the yard and barns for several minutes, Curtis turned away disappointedly.  \"He can't be anywhere around. It is very strange. Don never used to go away from home without me, but lately he has been missing several times, and twice last week he wasn't here"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24875"],["title","Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1904 (#8)"],["body","the morning and didn't turn up until midday.\"  \"I'd keep him shut up until I broke him of the habit of playing truant, if I were you,\" said Will, as they turned into the lane.  \"Don hates to be shut up, howls all the time so mournfully that I can't stand it,\" responded Curtis.  \"Well,\" said Will, hesitatingly, \"maybe that would be better after all than letting him stray away with other dogs who may teach him bad habits. I saw Don myself one evening last week ambling down the Harbour road with that big brown dog of Sam Ventnor's. Ventnor's dog is beginning to have a bad reputation, you know. There have been several sheep worried lately, and--\"  \"Don wouldn't touch a sheep!\" interrupted Curtis hotly.  \"I daresay not, not yet. But Ventnor's dog is under suspicion, and if Don runs with him he'll learn the trick sure as preaching. The farmers are growling a good bit already, and if they hear of Don and Ventnor's dog going about in company, they'll put it on them both. Better keep Don shut up awhile, let him howl as he likes.\"  \"I believe I will,\" said Curtis soberly. \"I don't want Don to fall under suspicion of sheep-worrying, though I'm sure he would never do it. Anyhow, I don't want him to run with Ventnor's dog. I'll chain him up in the barn when I go home. I couldn't stand it if anything happened to Don. After you, he's the only chum I've got--and he's a good one.\"  Will agreed. He was almost as fond of Don as Curtis was. But he did not feel so sure that the dog would not worry a sheep. Will knew that Don was suspected already, but he did not like to tell Curtis so. And of course there was as yet no positive proof--merely mutterings and suggestions among the Bayside farmers who had lost sheep and were anxious to locate their slayer. There were many other dogs in Bayside and the surrounding districts who were just as likely to be the guilty animals, and Will hoped that if Don were shut up for a time, suspicion might be averted from him, especially if the worryings still went on.  He had felt a little doubtful about hinting the truth to Curtis, who was a high-spirited lad and always resented any slur cast upon Don much more bitterly than if it were meant for himself. But he knew that Curtis would take it better from him than from the other Bayside boys, one or the other of whom would be sure soon to cast something up to Curtis about his dog. Will felt decidedly relieved to find that Curtis took his advice in the spirit in which it was offered.  \"Who have lost sheep lately?\" queried Curtis, as they left the main road and struck into a wood path through the ranks of beeches on Tom Grier's land.  \"Nearly everybody on the Hollow farms,\" answered Will. \"Until last week nobody on the Hill farms had lost any. But Tuesday night old Paul Stockton had six fine sheep killed in his upland pasture behind the fir woods. He is furious about it, I believe, and vows he'll find out what dog did it and have him shot.\"  Curtis looked grave. Paul Stockton's farm was only about a quarter of a mile from the Locksley homestead, and he knew that Paul had an old family grudge against his Uncle Arnold, which included his nephew and all belonging to him. Moreover, Curtis remembered with a sinking heart that Wednesday morning had been one of the mornings upon which Don was missing.  \"But I don't care!\" he thought miserably. \"I know Don didn't kill those sheep.\"  \"Talking of old Paul,\" said Will, who thought it advisable to turn the conversation, \"reminds me that they are getting anxious at the Harbour about George Finley's schooner, the _Amy Reade_. She was due three days ago and there's no sign of her yet. And there have been two bad gales since she left Morro. Oscar Stockton is on board of her, you know, and his father is worried about him. There are five other men on her, all from the Harbour, and their folks down there are pretty wild about the schooner.\"  Nothing more was said about the sheep, and soon, in the pleasures of chestnutting, Curtis forgot his anxiety. Old Tom Grier had called to the boys as they passed his house to come back and have dinner there when the time came. This they did, and it was late in the afternoon when Curtis, with his bag of chestnuts over his shoulder, walked into the Locksley yard.  His uncle was standing before the open barn doors, talking to an elderly, grizzled man with a thin, shrewd face.  Curtis's heart sank as he recognized old Paul Stockton. What could have brought him over?  \"Curtis,\" called his uncle, \"come here.\"  As Curtis crossed the yard, Don came bounding down the slope from the house to meet him. He put his hand on the dog's big head and the two of them walked slowly to the barn. Old Paul included them both in a vindictive scowl.  \"Curtis,\" said his uncle gravely, \"here's a bad business. Mr. Stockton tells me that your dog has been worrying his sheep.\"  \"It's a--\" began Curtis angrily. Then he checked himself and went on more calmly.  \"That can't be so, Mr. Stockton. My dog would not harm anything.\"  \"He killed or helped to kill six of the finest sheep in my flock!\" retorted old Paul.  \"What proof have you of it?\" demanded Curtis, trying to keep his anger within bounds.  \"Abner Peck saw your dog and Ventnor's running together through my sheep pasture at sundown on Tuesday evening,\" answered old Paul. \"Wednesday morning I found this in the corner of the pasture where the sheep were worried. Your uncle admits that it was tied around your dog's neck on Tuesday.\"  And old Paul held out triumphantly a faded red ribbon. Curtis recognized it at a glance. It was the ribbon his little cousin, Lena, had tied around Don's neck Tuesday afternoon. He remembered how they had laughed at the effect of that frivolous red collar and bow on Don's massive body.  \"I'm sure Don isn't guilty!\" he cried passionately.  Mr. Locksley shook his head.  \"I'm afraid he is, Curtis. The case looks very black against him, and sheep-stealing is a serious offence.\"  \"The dog must be shot,\" said old Paul decidedly. \"I leave the matter in your hands, Mr. Locksley. I've got enough proof to convict the dog and, if you don't have him killed, I'll make you pay for the sheep he worried.\"  As old Paul strode away, Curtis looked beseechingly at his uncle.  \"Don mustn't be shot, Uncle!\" he said desperately. \"I'll chain him up all the time.\"  \"And have him howling night and day as if we had a brood of banshees about the place?\" said Mr. Locksley sarcastically. He was a stern man with little sentiment in his nature and no understanding whatever of Curtis's affection for Don. The Bayside people said that Arnold Locksley had always been very severe with his nephew. \"No, no, Curtis, you must look at the matter sensibly. The dog is a nuisance and must be shot. You can't keep him shut up forever, and, if he has once learned the trick of sheep-worrying, he will never forget it. You can get another dog if you must have one. I'll get Charles Pippey to come and shoot Don tomorrow. No sulking now, Curtis. You are too big a boy for that. Tie the dog up for the night and then go and put the calves in. There is a storm coming. The wind is blowing hard from the northeast now.\"  His uncle walked away, leaving the boy white and miserable in the yard. He looked at Don, who sat on his haunches and returned his gaze frankly and open-heartedly. He did not look like a guilty dog. Could it be possible that he had really worried those sheep?  \"I'll never believe it of you, old fellow!\" Curtis said, as he led the dog into a corner of the carriage house and tied him up there. Then he flung himself down on a pile of sacks beside him and buried his face in Don's curly black fur. The boy felt sullen, rebellious and wretched.  He lay there until dark, thinking his own bitter thoughts and listening to the rapidly increasing gale. Finally he got up and flung off after the calves, with Don's melancholy howls at finding himself deserted ringing in his ears.  He'll be quiet enough tomorrow night, thought Curtis wretchedly, as he went upstairs to bed after housing the calves. For a long while he lay awake, but finally dropped into a heavy slumber which lasted until his aunt called him for milking.  The wind was blowing more furiously than ever. Up over the fields came the roar and crash of the surges on the outside shore. The Harbour to the east of Bayside was rough and stormy.  They were just rising from breakfast when Will Barrie burst into the kitchen.  \"The _Amy Reade_ is ashore on Gleeson's rocks!\" he shouted. \"Struck there at daylight this morning! Come on, Curt!\"  Curtis sprang for his cap, his uncle following suit more deliberately. As the two boys ran through the yard, Curtis heard Don howling.  \"I'll take him with me!\" he muttered. \"Wait a minute, Will.\"  The Harbour road was thronged with people hurrying to the outside shore, for the news of the _Amy Readers_ disaster had spread rapidly. As the boys, with the rejoicing Don at their heels, pelted along, Sam Morrow overtook them in a cart and told them to jump in. Sam had already been down to the shore and had gone back to tell his father. As they jolted along, he screamed information at them over the shriek of the gale.  \"Bad business, this! She's pounding on a reef 'bout a quarter of a mile out. They're sure she's going to break up--old tub, you know--leaky--rotten. The sea's tremenjus high, and the surfs going dean over her. There can't be no boat launched for hours yet--they'll all be drowned. Old Paul's down there like a madman--offering everything he's got to the man who'll save Oscar, but it can't be done.\"  By this time they had reached the shore, which was black with excited people. Out on Gleeson's Reef the ill-fated little schooner was visible amid the flying spray. A grizzled old Harbour fisherman, to whom Sam shouted a question, shook his head.  \"No, can't do nothin'! No boat c'd live in that surf f'r a moment. The schooner'll go to pieces mighty soon, I'm feared. It's turrible! turrible! to stan'"]]]
