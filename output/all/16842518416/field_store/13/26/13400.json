For I love thee so, that I could sooner bear to see thee hang'd than in the Arms of another.  _Macheath._ But could'st thou bear to see me hang'd?  _Lucy._ O _Macheath_, I can never live to see that Day.  _Macheath._ You see, _Lucy_; in the Account of Love you are in my Debt, and you must now be convinc'd, that I rather choose to die than be another's. --Make me, if possible, love thee more, and let me owe my Life to thee-- If you refuse to assist me, _Peachum_ and your Father will immediately put me beyond all means of Escape.  _Lucy._ My Father, I know, hath been drinking hard with the Prisoners: and I fancy he is now taking his Nap in his own Room-- If I can procure the Keys, shall I go off with thee, my Dear?  _Macheath._ If we are together, 'twill be impossible to lie conceal'd. As soon as the Search begins to be a little cool, I will send to thee-- 'Till then my Heart is thy Prisoner.  _Lucy._ Come then, my dear Husband-- owe thy Life to me-- and though you love me not-- be grateful,-- but that _Polly_ runs in my Head strangely.  _Macheath._ A moment of Time may make us unhappy for ever.

SCENE I.  _SCENE, Newgate._    _Lockit_, _Lucy_.  _Lockit._ To be sure, Wench, you must have been aiding and abetting to help him to this Escape.  _Lucy._ Sir, here hath been _Peachum_ and his Daughter _Polly_, and to be sure they know the Ways of _Newgate_ as well as if they had been born and bred in the Place all their Lives. Why must all your Suspicion light upon me?  _Lockit._ _Lucy_, _Lucy_, I will have none of these shuffling Answers.  _Lucy._ Well then-- If I know any thing of him I wish I may be burnt!  _Lockit._ Keep your Temper, _Lucy_, or I shall pronounce you guilty.  _Lucy._ Keep yours, Sir,-- I do wish I may be burnt. I do-- And what can I say more to convince you?  _Lockit._ Did he tip handsomly? --How much did he come down with? Come, Hussy, don't cheat your Father; and I shall not be angry with you-- Perhaps, you have made a better Bargain with him than I could have done-- How much, my good Girl?  _Lucy._ You know, Sir, I am fond of him, and would have given Money to have kept him with me.  _Lockit._ Ah _Lucy_! thy Education might have put thee more upon thy Guard; for a Girl in the Bar of an Ale-house is always besieg'd.  _Lucy._ Dear Sir, mention not my Education-- for 'twas to that I owe my Ruin.   AIR XL. If Love's a sweet Passion, &c.  [Music]    When young at the Bar you first taught me to score,   And bid me be free of my Lips, and no more;   I was kiss'd by the Parson, the Squire, and the Sot,   When the Guest was departed, the Kiss was forgot.   But his Kiss was so sweet, and so closely he prest,   That I languish'd and pin'd till I granted the rest.  If you can forgive me, Sir, I will make a fair Confession, for to be sure he hath been a most barbarous Villain to me.  _Lockit._ And so you have let him escape, Hussy-- Have you?  _Lucy._ When a Woman loves; a kind Look, a tender Word can persuade her to any thing-- And I could ask no other Bribe.  _Lockit._ Thou wilt always be a vulgar Slut, _Lucy_. --If you would not be look'd upon as a Fool, you should never do any thing but upon the foot of Interest. Those that act otherwise are their own Bubbles.  _Lucy._ But Love, Sir, is a Misfortune that may happen to the most discreet Women, and in Love we are all Fools alike-- Notwithstanding all he swore, I am now fully convinc'd that _Polly Peachum_ is actually his Wife. --Did I let him escape, (Fool that I was!) to go to her? --_Polly_ will wheedle herself into his Money, and then _Peachum_ will hang him, and cheat us both.  _Lockit._ So I am to be ruin'd, because, forsooth, you must be in Love! --a very pretty Excuse!  _Lucy._ I could murder that impudent happy Strumpet: --I gave him his Life, and that Creature enjoys the Sweets of it. --Ungrateful _Macheath_!   AIR XLI. _South-Sea_ Ballad.  [Music]    My Love is all Madness and Folly,       Alone I lie,     Toss, tumble, and cry,   What a happy Creature is _Polly_!   Was e'er such a Wretch as I!   With rage I redden like Scarlet,   That my dear inconstant Varlet,     Stark blind to my Charms,     Is lost in the Arms   Of that Jilt, that inveigling Harlot!     Stark blind to my Charms,     Is lost in the Arms   Of that Jilt, that inveigling Harlot!   This, this my Resentment alarms.  _Lockit._ And so, after all this Mischief, I must stay here to be entertain'd with your Catterwauling, Mrs. Puss! --Out of my Sight, wanton Strumpet! you shall fast and mortify yourself into Reason, with now and then a little handsom Discipline to bring you to your Senses. --Go.    [Exit _Lucy_.  _Peachum_ then intends to outwit me in this Affair; but I'll be even with him. --The Dog is leaky in his Liquor, so I'll ply him that way, get the Secret from him, and turn this Affair to my own Advantage. --Lions, Wolves, and Vultures don't live together in Herds, Droves or Flocks. --Of all Animals of Prey, Man is the only sociable one. Every one of us preys upon his Neighbour, and yet we herd together. --_Peachum_ is my Companion, my Friend. --According to the Custom of the World, indeed, he may quote thousands of Precedents for cheating me-- And shall not I make use of the Privilege of Friendship to make him a Return.   AIR XLII. _Packington's_ Pound.  [Music]    Thus Gamesters united in Friendship are found,   Though they know that their Industry all is a Cheat;   They flock to their Prey at the Dice-Box's Sound,   And join to promote one another's Deceit.     But if by mishap     They fail of a Chap,   To keep in their Hands, they each other entrap.   Like Pikes, lank with Hunger, who miss of their Ends,   They bite their Companions, and prey on their Friends.  Now, _Peachum_, you and I, like honest Tradesmen, are to have a fair Trial which of us two can over-reach the other.  [Illustration]   [Illustration]  SCENE II. _A Gaming-House._    _Macheath_ in a fine tarnish'd Coat, _Ben Budge_, _Matt of the Mint_.  _Macheath._ I am sorry, Gentlemen, the Road was so barren of Money. When my Friends are in Difficulties, I am always glad that my Fortune can be serviceable to them. [Gives them Money.] You see, Gentlemen, I am not a mere Court Friend, who professes every thing and will do nothing.   AIR XLIII. Lillibullero.  [Music]    The Modes of the Court so common are grown,     That a true Friend can hardly be met;   Friendship for Interest is but a Loan,     Which they let out for what they can get.         'Tis true, you find         Some Friends so kind,   Who will give you good Counsel themselves to defend.         In sorrowful Ditty,         They promise, they pity,   But shift for your Money, from Friend to Friend.  But we, Gentlemen, have still Honour enough to break through the Corruptions of the World. --And while I can serve you, you may command me.  _Ben._ It grieves my Heart that so generous a Man should be involv'd in such Difficulties, as oblige him to live with such ill Company, and herd with Gamesters.  _Matt._ See the Partiality of Mankind! --One Man may steal a Horse, better than another look over a Hedge. --Of all Mechanics, of all servile Handicrafts-men, a Gamester is the vilest. But yet, as many of the Quality are of the Profession, he is admitted amongst the politest Company. I wonder we are not more respected.  _Macheath._ There will be deep Play to-night at _Mary-bone_, and consequently Money may be pick'd up upon the Road. Meet me there, and I'll give you the Hint who is worth Setting.  _Matt._ The Fellow with a brown Coat with a narrow Gold Binding, I am told, is never without Money.  _Macheath._ What do you mean, _Matt_? --Sure you will not think of meddling with him! --He's a good honest kind of a Fellow, and one of us.  _Ben._ To be sure, Sir, we will put ourselves under your Direction.  _Macheath._ Have an Eye upon the Money-Lenders. --A _Rouleau_, or two, would prove a pretty sort of an Expedition. I hate Extortion.  _Matt._ Those Rouleaus are very pretty Things. --I hate your Bank Bills. --There is such a Hazard in putting them off.  _Macheath._ There is a certain Man of Distinction, who in his Time hath nick'd me out of a great deal of the Ready. He is in my Cash, Ben; --I'll point him out to you this Evening, and you shall draw upon him for the Debt. --The Company are met; I hear the Dice-Box in the other Room. So, Gentlemen, your Servant. You'll meet me at _Mary-bone_.

Published by Pyramid Books First printing: _October 1961_   _Printed in the United States of America_     I   The Archer Five came in a big packing box, bound with steel ribbons and marked, _This end up--handle with care_. It was delivered at a subsidized government surplus price of fifty dollars to Hendricks' Sports and Hobbies Center, a store in Jarviston, Minnesota, that used to deal mostly in skin diving equipment, model plane kits, parts for souping up old cars, and the like. The Archer Five was a bit obsolete for the elegant U.S. Space Force boys--hence the fantastic drop in price from two thousand dollars since only last June. It was still a plenty-good piece of equipment, however; and the cost change was a real break for the Bunch.  By 4:30 that bright October afternoon, those members who were attending regular astronautics classes at Jarviston Technical College had gathered at Hendricks' store. Ramos and Tiflin, two wild characters with seldom-cut hair and pipe stem pants, who didn't look as if they could be trusted with a delicate unpacking operation, broke the Archer out with a care born of love, there in Paul Hendricks' big backroom shop, while the more stolid members--and old Paul, silent in his swivel chair--watched like hawks.  \"So who tries it on first?\" Ramos challenged. \"Dumb question. You, Eileen--naturally.\"  Most Bunches have a small, hard, ponytailed member, dungareed like the rest.  Still kidding around, Ramos dropped an arm across Eileen Sands' shoulders, and got her sharp elbow jabbed with vigor into his stomach.  She glanced back in a feminine way at Frank Nelsen, a tall, lean guy of nineteen, butch-haircutted and snub featured. But he was the purposeful, studious kind, more an observer and a personal doer than a leader; he hadn't much time for the encouraging smiles of girls, and donning even an Archer Five now instead of within a few hours, didn't exactly represent his kind of hurry.  \"I'll wait, Eileen,\" he said. Then he nodded toward Gimp Hines. That the others would also pick Gimp was evident at once. There were bravos and clapping, half for a joke.  \"Think I won't?\" Gimp growled, tossing his crutches on a workbench littered with scraps of color-coded wire, and hopping forward on the one leg that had grown to normal size. He sort of swaggered, Frank Nelsen noticed. Maybe the whole Bunch swaggered with him in a way, because, right now, he represented all of them in their difficult aim. Gimp Hines, with the nylon patch in his congenitally imperfect heart, and with that useless right underpinning, had less chance of taking part in space-development than any of them--even with all his talent for mechanics and electronics.  Two-and-Two (George) Baines, a large, mild person who was an expert bricklayer in his spare time, while he struggled to absorb the intricate math that spacemen are supposed to know--he used to protest that he could at least add two and two--bounced forward, saying, \"I'll give yuh a hand, Gimp.\"  Mitch Storey, the lean colored kid with the passion for all plant life, and the specific urge to get somehow out to Mars, was also moving to help Gimp into the Archer. Gimp waved them off angrily, but they valeted for him, anyhow.  \"Shucks, Gimp,\" Storey soothed. \"Anybody needs assistance--the first time...\"  They got his good leg, and what there was of the other, into the boots. They laced carefully, following all they had learned from books. They rolled the wire-braced silicone rubber body-section up over his torso, guided his arms into the sleeves, closed the zipper-sealers and centered the chest plate. While the others checked with their eyes, they inspected the nipples of the moisture-reclaimer and chlorophane air-restorer capsules. They lifted the helmet of clear, darkened plastic over his head, and dogged it to the gasket with the automatic turnbuckles. By then, Gimp Hines' own quick fingers, in the gloves, were busy snapping this and adjusting that. There was a sleepy hum of aerating machinery.  \"It even _smells_ right, in here,\" Gimp growled muffledly, trying to be nonchalant.  There was loud laughter and clapping. Ramos whistled piercingly, with two fingers. The huge Kuzak twins, Art and Joe--both had football scholarships at Tech--gave Indian yells. Eileen Sands clasped her hands over her head and went up on her toes like the ballet dancer she had once meant to be. Old Paul, in his chair, chortled, and slapped his arm. Even little David Lester said \"Bravo!\" after he had gulped. The applause wasn't entirely facetious.  Gimp's whole self had borrowed hard lines and an air of competence from the Archer Five. For a second he looked like somebody who could really cross millions of miles. There was a tiny, solar-powered ionic-propulsion unit mounted on the shoulders of the armor, between the water-tank and the beam-type radio transmitter and receiver. A miniaturized radar sprouted on the left elbow joint. On the inside of the Archer's chest plate, reachable merely by drawing an arm out of a sleeve, emergency ration containers were racked. In the same place was a small airlock for jettisoning purposes and for taking in more supplies.  \"What do yuh know--toilet facilities, yet!\" Ramos chirped with spurious naivete, and there were guffaws which soon died out. After all, this _was_ a serious occasion, and who wanted to be a jerk? Now that the price had been shoved down into the ground, they could probably get their Archer Fives--their all-important vacuum armor. They were one more hurdle nearer to the stars.  Two regular members of the Bunch hadn't yet shown up. Ten were present, including Gimp in the Archie. All were different. Each had a name.  But Frank Nelsen figured that numbers, names, and individual variations didn't count for much, just then. They were a crowd with an overall personality--often noisy, sometimes quiet like now, always a bit grim to sustain their nerve before all they had to learn in order to reduce their inexperienced greenness, and before the thought of all the expensive equipment they had to somehow acquire, if they were to take part in the rapid adaptation of the solar system to human uses. Most of all, their courage was needed against fear of a region that could be deadly dangerous, but that to them seemed wonderful like nothing else.  The shop smelled of paint, solvent and plastic, like most any other. Gimp, sitting in the Archer, beside the oil-burning stove, didn't say any more. He forgot to play tough, and seemed to lose himself in a mind-trip Out There--probably as far as he would ever get. His face, inside the helmet, now looked pinched. His freckles were very plain in his paled cheeks. Gimp was awed.  So was everybody else, including Paul Hendricks, owner of the Hobby Center, who was approaching eighty and was out of the running, though his watery blue eyes were still showing the shine of boyhood, right now.  Way back, Paul Hendricks used to barnstorm county fairs in a wood-and-fabric biplane, giving thrill rides to sports and their girls at five dollars a couple, because he had been born sixty years too soon.  Much later in his spotty career, he had started the store. He had also meant to do general repair work in the backroom shop. But in recent years it had degenerated into an impromptu club hall, funk hole, griping-arguing-and-planning pit, extracurricular study lab and project site for an indefinite horde of interplanetary enthusiasts who were thought of in Jarviston as either young adults of the most resourceful kind--for whom the country should do much more in order to insure its future in space--or as just another crowd of delinquents, more bent on suicide and trouble-making than any hot rod group had ever been. Paul Hendricks was either a fine, helpful citizen--among so many who were disinterested and preoccupied--or a corrupting Socrates who deserved to drink hemlock.  Frank Nelsen knew all this as well as most. He had been acquainted with Paul ever since, at the age of seven, he had come into the store and had tried to make a down payment on a model building kit for a Y-71 ground-to-orbit freight rocket--clearly marked $49.95 in the display window--with his fortune of a single dime. Frank had never acquired a Y-71 kit, but he had found a friend in Paul Hendricks, and a place to hang around and learn things he wanted to know. Later on, as now, he had worked in the store whenever he had some free time.  Frank leaned against a lathe, watching the others, the frosty thrill and soul-searching hidden"]]]
