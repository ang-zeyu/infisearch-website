The return of peace has also increased the desire of the native population to receive the advantages of English education. The literature of the West is the most favourite study amongst the Hindoos in their schools and colleges. They will discuss with accuracy the most important events in British History. Boys of fifteen years of age, black in colour, will recite the most favourite passages from Shakespeare, ably quoting the notes of the English and German commentators. They excel in mathematics, and in legal subtleties their acuteness is most extraordinary.  In order to reward native talent and render it practically useful to the State, Sir Henry Hardinge, after due deliberation, has issued a resolution, by which the most meritorious students will be appointed to fill the public offices which fall vacant throughout Bengal.  This encouragement has been received by the Hindoo population with the greatest gratitude. The studies in the Mohammedan schools and colleges have hitherto been confined to Arabic, the Koran, and abstruse studies relating to their religion, having always shown a marked aversion to English literature. Since the publication of the Resolution they have at once determined to change their system in order to participate in the benefits held out to native merit of every sect.  It is impossible throughout your Majesty's immense Empire to employ the number of highly paid European civil servants which the public service requires. This deficiency is the great evil of British Administration. By dispersing annually a proportion of well-educated natives throughout the provinces, under British superintendence, well-founded hopes are entertained that prejudices may gradually disappear, the public service be improved, and attachment to British institutions increased....  Sir Henry Hardinge, in closing these observations, most humbly ventures to assure your Majesty that he anticipates no occurrence as probable, by which the tranquillity of this portion of your Majesty's dominions is likely to be disturbed.  H. HARDINGE.      [Footnote 34: Governor-General of India, in succession to Lord     Ellenborough.]     INTRODUCTORY NOTE  TO CHAPTER XIV   The new year (1845) opened auspiciously, trade improving owing to the great impetus given to it by the many lines of railway then in course of promotion. Over two hundred schemes were prepared at the commencement of the session to seek legislative sanction, and speculation outran all reasonable limits. The Income Tax (which in the ordinary course would have expired) was renewed, and the Anti-Corn Law Leaguers were more persistent than ever in their assaults on Protection, while the attacks on the Ministry from a section of their own party were redoubled. The most remarkable measure of the year was the Government Bill for increasing the grant to the Roman Catholic College of Maynooth, which was strongly opposed from the Conservative and the Protestant points of view; Mr Gladstone, though he approved of the measure, retired from the Ministry, as he had a few years before written in the opposite sense. Towards the close of the year the condition of Ireland, owing to the failure of the potato crop, became very alarming, and the Ministry greatly embarrassed. Lord John Russell wrote from Edinburgh to the electors of the City of London, announcing his conversion to the Repeal of the Corn Laws, and the _Times_ announced that such a Bill would be brought in by the Ministry. Peel, reluctant to accept the task, resigned office in December, and a Whig Ministry was attempted. Owing to dissensions, the attempt had to be abandoned, and Peel returned to office, without Lord Stanley, but with Mr Gladstone, who however did not seek re-election for the seat vacated by his acceptance of office.  A dispute of great importance arose during the year with the United States, relating to the boundary line between English and American territory west of the Rocky Mountains. Twenty-five years earlier the same question had arisen, and had been settled on the footing of joint occupancy. The increased importance of the Pacific slope made the matter more vital, involving as it did the ownership of Vancouver Island and the mouth of the Columbia River; President Polk unequivocally claimed the whole, and said he would not shrink from upholding America's interests; the British Government was equally firm, and the matter was not adjusted till 1846.  In India, which during nearly the whole year enjoyed peace, the Sikhs in December assumed the aggressive, and crossed the Sutlej, invading British India. They were signally defeated by Sir Hugh Gough at Moodkee and Ferozeshah. In Scinde Sir Charles Napier prosecuted operations against the mountain desert tribes.  In New Zealand some disastrous collisions took place between the natives and the settlers; the former on two occasions either defeating or repulsing the British arms.  In France the most important events were the Bill for fortifying Paris, the campaign waged against Abd-el-Kader in Algeria, and a horrible act of cruelty perpetrated there. In Spain Don Carlos abdicated his claims to the throne in favour of his son; the Queen's engagement to Count Trapani was rumoured. In other parts of Europe little that was eventful occurred.     CHAPTER XIV  1845   _Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._  WINDSOR CASTLE, _14th January 1845._  MY DEAREST UNCLE,--What you say about Aquila[1] and Montpensier interests me. What madness is it then to force Trapani on Spain! Pray explain to me the cause of the King's obstinacy about that Spanish marriage, for _no_ country has a right to dictate in that way to another. If Tatane[2] was _to think_ of the Infanta, England would be extremely indignant, and would (and with right) consider it tantamount to a marriage with the Queen herself. Ever your devoted Niece,  VICTORIA R.      [Footnote 1: Louis Charles, Comte d'Aquila, a son of Francis     I., King of the Two Sicilies, and brother of the Comte de     Trapani and of Queen Christina; he and his brother were     therefore uncles of Queen Isabella.]      [Footnote 2: The Duc de Montpensier.]     _The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._  LAEKEN, _18th January 1845._  MY DEAREST VICTORIA,--... The Spanish marriage question is really very curious; in fact, all the other Bourbon branches are hostile to the Orleans family, but the idea that makes the King so constant in his views about it, is that he imagines it would create in France a bad impression if _now_ any other than a Bourbon was to marry the Queen of Spain. That feeling they have _themselves created_, as in France they did not at all care about it; having, however, declared _quasi_ officially in the French Chambers that they _will not have any but a Bourbon_, if circumstances should after all decide it otherwise it would now be a defeat, but certainly one of their own making.... Your devoted Uncle,  LEOPOLD R.     _Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._  WINDSOR CASTLE, _28th January 1845._  ...The feeling of loyalty in this country is happily _very_ strong, and wherever we show ourselves we are most heartily and warmly received, and the civilities and respect shown to us by those we visit is _most_ satisfactory. I mention merely a trifling instance to show _how_ respectful they are--the Duke of Buckingham, who is immensely proud, bringing the cup of coffee after dinner on a waiter to Albert himself. And everywhere my dearest Angel receives the respect and honours I receive.  Many thanks for returning the list;[3] it was not Albert but _Tatane_ who made the black crosses. Are not \"Les 3 Mousquetaires,\" by Dumas, and \"Arthur,\" by Eugène Sue, _readable_ for _me_?  Now adieu, dearest, best Uncle. Ever your truly devoted Niece,  VICTORIA R.      [Footnote 3: A list of French books which the Queen was     proposing to read.]     [PAGEHEADING: STATE OF BUCKINGHAM PALACE]   _Queen Victoria to Sir Robert Peel._  PAVILION, _10th February 1845._  Though the Queen knows that Sir Robert Peel has already turned his attention to the urgent necessity of doing something to Buckingham Palace, the Queen thinks it right to recommend this subject herself to his serious consideration. Sir Robert is acquainted with the state of the Palace and the total want of accommodation for our little family, which is fast growing up. Any building must necessarily take some years before it can be safely inhabited. If it were to be begun this autumn, it could hardly be occupied before the spring of 1848, when the Prince of Wales would be nearly seven, and the Princess Royal nearly eight years old, and they cannot possibly be kept in the nursery any longer. A provision for this purpose ought, therefore, to be made this year. Independent of this, most parts of the Palace are in a sad state, and will ere long require a further outlay to render them _decent_ for the occupation of the Royal Family or any visitors the Queen may have to receive. A room, capable of containing a larger number of those persons whom the Queen has to invite in the course of the season to balls, concerts, etc., than any of the present apartments can at once hold, is much wanted. Equally so, improved offices and servants' rooms, the want of which puts the departments of the household to great expense yearly. It will be for Sir Robert to consider whether it would not be best to remedy all these deficiencies at once, and to make use of this opportunity to render the exterior of the Palace such as no longer to be a _disgrace_ to the country, which it certainly now is. The Queen thinks the country would be better pleased to have the question of the Sovereign's residence in London so finally disposed of, than to have it so repeatedly brought before it.[4]      [Footnote 4: Peel replied that, as a renewal of the Income Tax     was about to be proposed, it would be better to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24800"],["title","Darwin, and After Darwin, Volumes 1 and 3 (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: Frontispiece-Charles Darwin]     DARWIN, AND AFTER DARWIN  _AN EXPOSITION OF THE DARWINIAN THEORY AND A DISCUSSION OF POST-DARWINIAN QUESTIONS_  BY  GEORGE JOHN ROMANES, M.A., LL.D., F.R.S. _Honorary Fellow of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge_  I THE DARWINIAN THEORY  FOURTH EDITION  Chicago THE OPEN COURT PUBLISHING COMPANY 1910   The Illustrations of this book (with the exception of the Frontispiece and the colored plate facing page 332) are copyrighted under the title \"Darwinism Illustrated.\"  THE OPEN COURT PUBLISHING CO.

Romanes        To       Edward C. Hegeler Esq.       La Salle, Ill. U. S.]     PREFACE   Several years ago Lord Rosebery founded, in the University of Edinburgh, a lectureship on \"The Philosophy of Natural History,\" and I was invited by the Senatus to deliver the lectures. This invitation I accepted, and subsequently constituted the material of my lectures the foundation of another course, which was given in the Royal Institution, under the title \"Before and after Darwin.\" Here the course extended over three years--namely from 1888 to 1890. The lectures for 1888 were devoted to the history of biology from the earliest recorded times till the publication of the \"Origin of Species\" in 1859; the lectures for 1889 dealt with the theory of organic evolution up to the date of Mr. Darwin's death, in 1882; while those of the third year discussed the further developments of this theory from that date till the close of the course in 1890.  It is from these two courses--which resembled each other in comprising between thirty and forty lectures, but differed largely in other respects--that the present treatise has grown. Seeing, however, that it has grown much beyond the bulk of the original lectures, I have thought it desirable to publish the whole in the form of three separate works. Of these the first--or that which deals with the purely historical side of biological science--may be allowed to stand over for an indefinite time. The second is the one which is now brought out and which, as its sub-title signifies, is devoted to the general theory of organic evolution as this was left by the stupendous labours of Darwin. As soon as the translations shall have been completed, the third portion will follow (probably in the Autumn season), under the sub-title, \"Post-Darwinian Questions.\"  As the present volume is thus intended to be merely a systematic exposition of what may be termed the Darwinism of Darwin, and as on this account it is likely to prove of more service to general readers than to professed naturalists, I have been everywhere careful to avoid assuming even the most elementary knowledge of natural science on the part of those to whom the exposition is addressed. The case, however, will be different as regards the next volume, where I shall have to deal with the important questions touching Heredity, Utility, Isolation, &c., which have been raised since the death of Mr. Darwin, and which are now being debated with such salutary vehemence by the best naturalists of our time.  My obligations to the Senatus of the University of Edinburgh, and to the Board of Management of the Royal Institution, have already been virtually expressed; but I should like to take this opportunity of also expressing my obligations to the students who attended the lectures in the University of Edinburgh. For alike in respect of their large numbers, their keen intelligence, and their generous sympathy, the members of that voluntary class yielded a degree of stimulating encouragement, without which the labour of preparing the original lectures could not have been attended with the interest and the satisfaction that I found in it. My thanks are also due to Mr. R. E. Holding for the painstaking manner in which he has assisted me in executing most of the original drawings with which this volume is illustrated; and likewise to Messrs. Macmillan and Co. for kindly allowing me to reprint--without special acknowledgment in every case--certain passages from an essay which they published for me many years ago, under the title \"Scientific Evidences of Organic Evolution.\" Lastly, I must mention that I am indebted to the same firm for permission to reproduce an excellent portrait of Mr. Darwin, which constitutes the frontispiece.
