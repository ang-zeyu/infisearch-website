His first part of the work had been a matter of plans and maps, of compass and level, of observing the ground--incidentally dodging the bullets of the German snipers who caught glimpses of his crawling form--by day, and of intricate and exact figuring and calculating by night, in the grimy cellar of another ruined house by the light of a candle, stuck in an empty bottle.  Thereafter he spent all his waking hours (and many of his sleeping ones as well) in a thick suit of clayey mud; he lived like a mole in his mine gallery or his underground cellar, saw the light only when he emerged to pass from his work to his sleep or meals, and back to his work, and generally gave himself, his whole body and brain and being, to the correct driving of a shallow burrow straight to the selected point under the enemy trench a hundred and odd yards away.  He was a youngish man, and this was the first job of any importance that had been wholly and solely entrusted to him.  It was not only his anxiety to make a creditable showing, but he was keen on the work for the work's own sake, and he revelled in the creative sense of the true artist.  The mine was his.  He had first suggested it, he had surveyed it, and plotted it, and measured and planned and worked it out on paper; and now, when it came to the actual pick-and-shovel work, he supervised and directed and watched each hour of work, and each yard of progress.  It was tricky work, too, and troublesome.  At first the ground was good stiff clay that the spades bit out in clean mouthfuls, and that left a fair firm wall behind.  But that streak ran out in the second day's working, and the mine burrowed into some horrible soft crumbly soil that had to be held up and back by roof and wall of planking.  The Subaltern took a party himself and looted the wrecks of houses--there was no lack of these in the village just behind the lines--of roof-beams and flooring, and measured and marked them for sawing into lengths, and would have taken a saw with pleasure himself.  Then he dived cheerfully into the oozing wet burrow and superintended the shoring up, and re-started the men to digging, and emerged a moment to see more planking passed down.  He came in fact dangerously near to making a nuisance of himself, and some of his men who had been sapping and mining for wet and weary months past were inclined to resent quite so much fussing round and superintendence.  But the Corporal put that right.  He was an elderly man with a nasty turn of temper that had got him into almost as many troubles in his service as his knowledge, experience, and aptitude for hard work and responsibility had got him out of.  'Leave the lad be,' he had said when some of the party had passed grumbling remarks about 'too bloomin' much fuss an' feathers over a straight simple bloomin' job.'  The Corporal had promptly squashed that opinion.  'Leave the lad be,' he said.  'He's young to the job, mebbe, but he's not such a simple fool as some that take this for a simple job.  It's not goin' to be all that simple, as you'll find before you're done.'  He was right, too.  The crumbling soil was one little difficulty promptly and easily met.  The next was more troublesome.  The soil grew wetter and more wet until at last the men were working ankle deep in water.  The further the mine went the wetter it became.  The men worked on, taking their turn at the narrow face, shovelling out the wet muck and dragging it back to the shaft and up and out and away by the communication trench.  They squeezed aside in silence when the Subaltern pushed in to inspect the working, and waited with side winks to one another to see what he would do to overcome the water difficulty.  'Pumps' would of course have been the simple answer, but the men knew as well as the Subaltern knew that pumps were not to be had at that particular time and place for love or money, and that all the filling of all the 'indents' in the R.E. would not produce one single efficient pump from store.  The Subaltern did not trouble with indent forms or stores.  He had had something of a fight to get a grudging permission for his mine, and he felt it in his bones that if he worried the big chiefs too much with requisitions he would be told to abandon the mine.  He shut his teeth tight at the thought.  It was his mine and he was going to see it through, if he had to bale the water out with a tea-cup.  He made a quick cast through the shell-wrecked village, drew blank, sat for fifteen minutes on the curb of a rubble-choked well and thought hard, jumped up and called the Corporal to provide him with four men and some odd tools, and struck back across muddy and shell-cratered fields to the nearest farm.  The farmer, who had remained in possession despite the daily proximity of bursting shells, a shrapnel-smashed tile roof, and a gaping hole where one house-corner should have been, made some objection to the commandeering of his old-fashioned farm pump.  He was at first supported in this by the officer in charge of the men billeted in the barn and sheds, but the Sapper explained the urgency of his need and cunningly clinched the argument by reminding the Infantry officer that probably he and his men would soon be installed in the trenches from which the mine ran, and that he--the Sapper--although he was not supposed to mention it, might just hint that his mine was only hurrying to forestall an enemy mine which was judged to be approaching the trench the Infantry officer would presently occupy.  This last was a sheer invention of the moment, but it served excellently, and the Sapper and his party bore off their pump in triumph.  It was later erected in the mine shaft, and the difficulty of providing sufficient piping to run from the pump to the waterlogged part of the mine was met by a midnight visit to the house where Headquarters abode and the wholesale removal of gutters and rain-pipes.  As Headquarters had its principal residence in a commodious and cobwebby cellar, the absence of the gutters fortunately passed without remark, and the sentry who watched the looting and the sergeant to whom he reported it were quite satisfied by the presence of an Engineer officer and his calm assurance that it was 'all right--orders--an Engineers' job.'  The pump did its work excellently, and a steady stream of muddy water gushed from its nozzle and flowed down the Headquarters gutter-pipes to a selected spot well behind the trenches.  Unfortunately the pump, being old-fashioned, was somewhat noisy, and all the packing and oiling and tinkering failed to silence its clank-clink, clank-clink, as its arm rose and fell.  The nearest German trench caught the clank-clink, and by a simple process of deduction and elimination arrived at its meaning and its location.  The pump and the pumpers led a troubled life after that. Snipers kept an unsteady but never silent series of bullets smacking into the stones of the ruin, whistling over the communication trench, and 'whupp'-ing into the mud around both.  A light gun took a hand and plumped a number of rounds each day into the crumbling walls and rubbish-heaps of stone and brick, and burst shrapnel all over the lot. The Sappers dodged the snipers by keeping tight and close to cover; they frustrated the direct-hitting 'Fizz-Bang' shells by a stout barricade of many thicknesses of sandbags bolstering up the fragment of wall that hid their shaft and pump, and finally they erected a low roof over the works and sandbagged that secure against the shrapnel.  There were casualties of course, but these are always in the way of business with the Sappers and came as a matter of course.  The Germans brought up a trench-mortar next and flung noisy and nerve-wrecking high-explosive bombs into and all round the ruin, bursting down all the remaining walls except the sandbagged one and scoring a few more casualties until the forward trench installed a trench-mortar of their own, and by a generous return of two bombs to the enemy's one put the German out of action.  A big _minnenwerfer_ came into play next, and because it could throw a murderous-sized bomb from far behind the German trench it was too much for the British trench-mortar to tackle. This brought the gunners into the game, and the harassed infantry (who were coming to look on the Sapper Subaltern and his works as an unmitigated nuisance and a most undesirable acquaintance who drew more than a fair share of enemy fire on them) appealed to the guns to rid them of their latest tormentor.  An Artillery Observing Officer spent a perilous hour or two amongst the shrapnel and snipers' bullets on top of the sandbagged wall, until he had located the _minnenwerfer_.  Then about two minutes' telephoned talk to the Battery and ten minutes of spouting lyddite volcanoes finished the _minnenwerfer_ trouble.  But all this above-ground work was by way of an aside to the Sapper Subaltern.  He was far too busy with his mine gallery to worry about the doings of gunners and bomb-throwers and infantry and such-like fellows.  When these people interfered with his work they were a nuisance of course, but he always managed to find a working party for the sandbagging protective work without stopping the job underground.  So the gallery crept steadily on.  They had to carry the tunnel rather close to the surface because at very little depth they struck more water than any pumps, much less their single farmyard one, could cope with.  The nearness to the surface made a fresh difficulty and necessitated the greatest care in working under the ground between the trenches, because here there were always deep shell-holes and craters to be avoided or floored with the planking that made the tunnel roof. So the gallery had to be driven carefully at a level below the danger of exposure through a shell-hole and above the depth at which the water lay.  This meant a tunnel too low to stand or"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25076"],["title","Between the Lines (#5)"],["body","kneel in with a straight back, and the men, kneeling in mud, crouched back on their heels and with rounded back and shoulders, struck their spades forward into the face and dragged the earth out spadeful by spadeful.  Despite the numbing cold mud they knelt in, the men, stripped to shirts with rolled sleeves and open throats, streamed rivulets of sweat as they worked; for the air was close and thick and heavy, and the exertion in the cramped space was one long muscle-racking strain.  Once the roof and walls caved in, and three men were imprisoned.  The collapse came during the night, fortunately, and, still more fortunately behind the line and parapet of the forward trench.  The Subaltern flung himself and his men on the muddy wreckage in frantic haste to clear an opening and admit air to the imprisoned men.  It took time, a heart-breaking length of time; and it was with a horrible dread in his heart that the Subaltern at last pushed in to the uncovered opening and crawled along the tunnel, flashing his electric torch before him.  Half-way to the end he felt a draught of cold air, and, promptly extinguishing his lamp, saw a hole in the roof.  His men were alive all right, and not only alive but keeping on hard at work at the end of the tunnel.  When the collapse came they had gone back to where their roof lay across the bottom of a shell-hole, pulled a plank out, and--gone back to work.  When the tunnel reached a point under the German parapet it was turned sharp to left and right, forming a capital T with the cross-piece running roughly along the line of trench and parapet.  Here there was need of the utmost deliberation and caution.  A pick could not be used, and even a spade had to be handled gently, in case the sounds of working should reach the Germans overhead.  In some places the Subaltern could actually hear the movements and footsteps of the enemy just above him.  Twice the diggers disturbed a dead German, buried evidently under the parapet.  Once a significant crumbling of the earth and fall of a few heavy clods threatened a collapse where the gallery was under the edge of the trench.  The spot was hastily but securely shored up with infinite caution and the least possible sound, and after that the Subaltern had the explosive charges brought along and connected up in readiness.  Then, if the roof collapsed or their work were discovered, the switch at the shaft could still be pressed, the wires would still carry the current, and the mine would be exploded.  At last the Subaltern decided that everything was ready.  He carefully placed his charges, connected up his wires again, cleared out his tools, and emerged to report 'all ready.'  Now the 'touching off' of a good-sized mine is not a matter to be done lightly or without due and weighty authority, and that because more is meant to result from it than the upheaval of some square yards of earth and the destruction of so many yards of enemy trench.  The mine itself, elaborate and labour-making as it may have been, is, after all, only a means to an end.  That end may be the capture of a portion of the ruins of the trench, it may be the destruction of an especially strong and dangerous 'keep,' a point of resistance or an angle for attack.  It may even be a mine to destroy a mine which is known to be tunnelling into our own trenches, but in any case the explosion is usually a signal for attack from one side or the other, and therefore requires all the usual elaborate arrangements of reinforcements and supports and so on. Therefore the Sapper Subaltern, when he had finished his work and made his report, had nothing to do but sit down and wait until other people's preparations were made, and he received orders to complete his work by utterly and devastatingly destroying it.  The Subaltern found this wait about the most trying part of the whole affair, more especially since he had for a good many days and nights had so much to occupy his every moment.  He received word at last of the day and hour appointed for the explosion, and had the honour of a visit of inspection from a very superior officer who pored long and painstakingly over the paper plans, put a great many questions, even went the length of walking down the communication trench and peering down the entrance shaft, and looking over the sandbagged wall through a periscope at the section of German trench marked down for destruction.  Then he complimented the Subaltern on his work, declined once again the offer of a muddy mackintosh and an invitation to crawl down the mine, and went off.  The Subaltern saw him off the premises, returned to the shaft and donned the mackintosh, and crawled off up his tunnel once more.  Somehow, now that the whole thing was finished and ready, he felt a pang of reluctance to destroy it and so fulfil its destiny.  As he crawled along, he noted each little bit of shoring-up and supporting planks, each rise and fall in the floor, each twist and angle in the direction, and recalled the infinite labour of certain sections, his glows of satisfaction at the speed of progress at the easy bits, his impatience at the slow and difficult portions.  It seemed as if he had been building that tunnel for half a lifetime, had hardly ever done anything else but build it or think about building it.  And now, to-morrow it was all to be destroyed.  He recalled with a thrill of boyish pleasure the word of praise from the Corporal--a far greater pleasure, by the way, than he had derived from the Great One's compliments--the praise of one artist to another, the recognition of good work done, by one who himself had helped in many good works and knew well of what he spoke.  'She's done, sir,' the Corporal had said. 'And if I may say so, sir, she's a credit to you.  A mighty tricky job, sir, and I've seen plenty with long years in the Service that would ha' been stumped at times.  I'm glad to have had a hand in it wi' you, sir. And all the men feel the same way about it.'  Ah well, the Subaltern thought as he halted at the joint of the T-piece, none of them felt the same about it as he himself did.  He squatted there a moment, listening to the drip of water that was the only sound.  Suddenly his heart leapt . . . was it the only sound? What was that other, if it could be called a sound?  It was a sense rather, an indefinable blending of senses of hearing and feel and touch--a faint, barely perceptible 'thump, thump,' like the beat of a man's heart in his breast.  He snapped off the light of his electric lamp and crouched breathless in the darkness, straining his ears to hear.  He was soon satisfied.  He had not lived these days past with the sound of digging in his ears by day and his dreams by night not to recognise the blows of a pick.  There . . . they had stopped now; and in imagination he pictured the digger laying down the pick to shovel out the loosened earth.  Then, after a pause, the measured thump, thump went on again.  The Subaltern crawled along first one arm of the cross-section and then the other, halting every now and then to place his ear to the wet planking or the wetter earth.  He located at last the point nearest to the sound, and without more waste of time scurried off down his tunnel to daylight.  He was back in the mine again in less than half an hour--a bare thirty minutes, but each minute close packed with concentrated essence of thought and action.  The nearest trench telephone had put him in touch with Battalion Headquarters, and through them with Brigade, Divisional, and General Headquarters.  He had told his story and asked for his orders clearly, quickly, and concisely.  The Germans were countermining.  Their tunnel could not possibly miss ours, and, by the sound, would break through in thirty to sixty minutes.  What were his orders?  It took some little time for the orders to come, mainly because--although he knew nothing of it--his mine was part of a scheme for a general attack, and general attacks are affairs that cannot be postponed or expedited as easily as a cold lunch.  But the Subaltern filled in the time of waiting, and when the orders did come he was ready for them or any other.  They were clear and crisp--he was to fire the mine, but only at the latest possible minute.  That was all he got, and indeed all he wanted; and, since they did not concern him, there is no need here to tell of the swirl of other orders that buzzed and ticked and talked by field telegraph and telephone for miles up and down and behind the British line.  Before these orders had begun to take shape or coherency as a whole, the Subaltern was back listening to the thump, thump of the German picks, and busily completing his preparations.  It was near noon, and perhaps the workers would stop for a meal, which would give another hour for troops to be pushed up or whatever else the Generals wanted time for.  It might even be that a fall of their roof, an extra inflow of water to their working, any one of the scores of troubles that hamper and hinder underground mining might stop the crawling advance of the German sappers for a day or two and allow the Subaltern's mine to play its appointed part at the appointed time of the grand attack.  But meantime the Subaltern took no chances.  First he connected up a short switch which in the last extreme of haste would allow him with one touch of his finger to blow up his mine and himself with it.  He buried or concealed the wires connecting the linked charges with the switch outside so as to have a chance of escape himself.  He opened a portable telephone he had carried with him and joined up to the wire he had also carried in, and so was in touch with his Corporal and the world of the aboveground.  All these things he did himself because there was no need to risk more than one man in case of a quick explosion.  Then, his preparations complete, he sat down to wait and to listen to the thudding picks of the Germans.  They were very near now, and with "]]]
