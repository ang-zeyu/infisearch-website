[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24731"],["title","The Tale of Grunty Pig (#6)"],["body","their tails haven't sprouted yet.\"  Old dog Spot seemed to choke over something. He turned his head away for a moment or two before he spoke.  \"These pigs,\" he said, \"won't ever have tails. Not one of them would know what to do with a tail if you gave him one. They don't want tails. They have no use for them. And now that you see for yourself how happy they are without tails, you ought not to delay any longer about having yours cut off. I hope,\" Spot added, \"I'll see your tail nailed up on the barn to-morrow, where everybody can admire it.\"  Then Grunty Pig said something that surprised him.  \"Why don't you have your own tail cut off?\" he asked old Spot.  And before old Spot could think of an answer, Johnnie Green came running out of the woodshed.  \"Get away from my guinea pigs!\" he shouted.  Grunty and Spot both turned and ran in opposite directions. Grunty didn't see Spot again for more than a week. When they did at last meet, old Spot never mentioned tails at all. To tell the truth, he seemed to feel somewhat ashamed of himself for having tried to play a trick on Grunty Pig.  Or maybe he felt ashamed because he was caught at it.     XXI  BEECHNUTS   Down the hill, a little way from Farmer Green's house, a great beech tree stood beside the road. In the fall, when the nuts were ripe, Johnnie Green often visited the tree. And so did Frisky Squirrel. And so, likewise, did that noisy rascal, Jasper Jay. They liked beechnuts--all three. And somehow they got the notion that the beech tree belonged to them--and to nobody else.  One fine, crisp fall day when Johnnie Green was in school, a fourth nut-lover wandered down the road, stopped right between the wheel tracks, and sniffed. It was Grunty Pig. \"I smell beechnuts!\" he cried with a joyful squeal. And crashing into the light underbrush along the roadside, he began to search among the fallen leaves with his long nose.  Soon Grunty came upon a cluster of the three-sided nuts, clinging inside a bur that the frost had split open. He ate the sweet nuts, shells and all. And with many a grunt of delight he grubbed beneath the tree from which the nuts had fallen. His keen nose led him to burs that Johnnie Green had trampled over that very morning, and missed.  \"I wonder--\" said Grunty Pig aloud--\"I wonder why nobody ever told me about this beech tree.\"  \"Perhaps it was because you are a pig,\" said a voice right over his head.  He looked up. And there on a low branch sat Frisky Squirrel. Grunty knew him; he had sometimes seen him around Farmer Green's corncrib.  \"Of course I'm a Pig,\" Grunty retorted. \"I'm Mrs. Pig's son.\"  \"Well, Mrs. Pig's son, I notice that you have helped yourself freely to beechnuts.\"  \"I've eaten all I could find,\" Grunty told Frisky with a grin.  \"I don't hear any thanks,\" Frisky Squirrel remarked. \"Don't you know that these beechnuts belong to me and Jasper Jay and Johnnie Green?\"  \"Umph!\"  \"You did?\" Frisky inquired.  \"Umph!\"  \"Oh, you didn't!\" Frisky exclaimed. \"Then I suppose I shall have to pardon you. But Jasper Jay wouldn't, if he caught you taking any of the nuts that fall from this tree.\"  There was truth in what Frisky said. Even as he spoke a patch of blue flashed in the top of the beech tree. And a harsh voice sang out, \"What's going on here?\"  Jasper Jay had arrived.  Grunty Pig, however, did not even give Jasper a glance. Instead, he began nosing about for another beechnut bur.  For a moment or two Jasper Jay watched him. And then Jasper began to squawk.  \"Stop that!\" he ordered. \"Don't you dare to take any of our beechnuts!\"  \"Umph!\" said Grunty Pig. \"I can't find any more on the ground. So I suppose I shall have to obey him,\" Grunty muttered half under his breath.  \"Don't mumble! Speak up!\" cried Jasper Jay. \"If you have any excuses to make, let's hear them!\"     XXII  JASPER JAY OBJECTS   While Jasper Jay, in the beech tree, waited for Grunty Pig, on the ground, to speak up and make his excuses for taking beechnuts, a bur dropped from a twig and landed right in front of Grunty's nose. He fell upon it greedily. And, tearing it open, he devoured the nuts with relish.  For a few moments his action struck Jasper Jay dumb. That blue-coated rascal turned to Frisky Squirrel, who clung to a limb near-by.  \"Well, did you ever?\" Jasper gasped. And then, having found his voice, Jasper began to use it on Grunty Pig.  Now, Jasper Jay was a wild fellow. He often used words that made the gentler folk in Pleasant Valley shudder. And he called Grunty Pig names that would have made many a person angry.  Grunty Pig, however, never even blinked. And after a while Jasper Jay used up all his special words, which he generally employed at such times. He gave Frisky Squirrel a helpless look.  \"My! My! Isn't this chap thick-skinned?\" he exclaimed.  \"Certainly I am!\" cried Grunty Pig. \"That's why I like to wallow in mud.\"  \"Ha!\" Jasper Jay sniffed. And he spoke again to Frisky Squirrel. \"This chap is thick-headed, too. I see that I'm going to have trouble making him understand what I say.\"  Frisky Squirrel merely grinned at his companion.  \"Look here, young Porker!\" Jasper called to Grunty Pig. \"Doesn't Farmer Green feed you?\"  The name \"Porker\" made Grunty Pig look up.  \"I'm Mrs. Pig's son,\" he said. \"Don't call me 'Porker'!\"  \"Well--Pig, then!\" Jasper Jay squalled. \"Doesn't Farmer Green feed you?\"  \"Yes!\"  \"Well, then--don't come here and take our nuts! Didn't your mother ever teach you that things that grow on trees--such things as nuts--belong to the people that live in the trees?\"  \"Does Johnnie Green live in this tree?\" Grunty Pig inquired.  \"He spends half his time here--or a quarter, anyhow,\" Jasper Jay grumbled. \"And you may be sure he gets his share of these beechnuts. Goodness knows he leaves few enough for me and my friend here.  \"Now,\" Jasper Jay went on, \"I want you to promise not to eat any more of our nuts.\"  Grunty Pig shook his head.  \"I can't promise that, exactly,\" he said. \"But I'll promise not to eat any that I don't find on the ground.\"  \"Huh!\" Jasper Jay scoffed. \"That means that you won't eat any nuts that you can't reach. That's no promise at all. It's nothing but a threat. It's the same as saying that you're going to eat every nut that drops off this tree.\"  Grunty Pig made no reply. He would have wandered on, but for a fresh breeze that had begun to whip the branches of the beech tree. He decided to wait there. More burs might fall. And Grunty wanted to be on hand to meet them when they dropped.  \"Go home!\" Jasper Jay shrieked at him. \"Go back to your pigpen where you belong. We don't want you here.\" And he said many more things that were still ruder.  But Grunty Pig never showed the least sign of anger. He didn't even let Jasper Jay know that he had heard. When the wind died down he waddled off down the road. And Frisky Squirrel followed him through the tree tops. When they had travelled out of Jasper Jay's sight and hearing, Frisky asked Grunty Pig a question.  \"I should like to know,\" he said, \"how you managed to keep still when Jasper was abusing you. I know that I should have lost my temper. Can it be that you didn't hear what he said?\"  \"Oh, I heard him clearly enough,\" said Grunty. \"But there was no sense in my getting angry with _him_. If he had been standing on the ground near me he would never have dared talk to me as he did. Jasper Jay called me names because he was safe in the tree. If he hadn't had that tree to help him he'd never have dared say what he did.  \"To tell the truth, I am a bit out of patience with that beech tree,\" Grunty confessed. \"It played me a mean trick. And I hope there'll be a raging wind to-night that will rob it of every bur it has.... I'd uproot the beech,\" he added, \"if I didn't like beechnuts so much.\"  \"Well, you _are_ an odd one,\" said Frisky Squirrel.  \"If everybody was as odd as I am there'd be fewer Jasper Jays in the world,\" Grunty Pig declared.     XXIII  MOSES MOUSE'S WAY   One day when Grunty Pig was at home, in the pigpen, a squeaky voiced piped \"Good morning!\" to him. Looking up, Grunty saw a plump little gentleman clinging to the top board on one side of the pen.  \"Good morning!\" Grunty answered. \"May I inquire what your name is?\"  \"I'm Moses Mouse,\" his caller replied.  \"Do you live in the piggery?--or in the barn?\" Grunty asked him.  \"Neither!\" said Moses Mouse. \"I live in the farmhouse. My wife and I have a nest in the wall.... The cat's away,\" he explained. \"That's why I decided to stroll across the yard and visit you folks out here.\"  \"Some people,\" said Grunty Pig, \"have all the luck. You live in the farmhouse. Miss Kitty Cat lives in the farmhouse--when she's at home. And old dog Spot spends a good deal of his time there--especially in cold weather. It must be pleasant to have your home where there's always plenty to eat, whenever you happen to feel hungry.\"  \"Miss Kitty Cat and old dog Spot always fare well,\" Mr. Mouse admitted. \"But I've often gone to bed half starved. Maybe you didn't know that Mrs. Green is terribly neat. She doesn't leave much food around for us Mice.\"  \"Well,\" Grunty remarked, \"it's an honor, anyhow, to live in the farmhouse. You ought not to complain about the food, even if it is a bit scarce at times. I'd be glad to live there. And I dare say I'd find a plenty to eat. The farmhouse is where the sour milk comes from.\"  \"If you feel like that,\" said Moses Mouse, \"why don't you join us? Why don't you come to the farmhouse for the winter, anyhow?\"  Grunty Pig shook his head.  \"No!\" he said, half to himself. \"No! I can't do it.\"  \"Why not?\" Mr. Mouse wanted to know.  \"I've never been invited,\" Grunty told him, with something like a frown.  Moses Mouse surprised him with a merry laugh.  \"Ho!\" he exclaimed. \"Neither have I. If I had waited for an invitation I wouldn't be living in the farmhouse. I'd have shivered my days out in the barn.\"  Grunty Pig looked at his caller with growing interest. He would have said that so tiny a gentleman would be too "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24731"],["title","The Tale of Grunty Pig (#7)"],["body","to crowd in where he wasn't asked.  \"Don't wait any longer for an invitation,\" Moses Mouse urged him. \"Go to the farmhouse and walk right in.\"  \"Oughtn't I to rap?\" Grunty inquired.  \"Certainly not!\" said Moses Mouse. \"Make yourself right at home. Act as if the farmhouse belonged to you. That's the way I do. And nobody ever bothers me, except Miss Kitty Cat--or Miss Snooper, as we Mice call her. Even she can't drive me away from the farmhouse. I lived there before she ever came to Pleasant Valley.\"  \"She certainly couldn't drive me away,\" Grunty Pig muttered. \"Besides, didn't you say she was away herself?\"  \"Yes!\" said Moses Mouse. \"And I hope she has gone for good.\"  \"Then,\" said Grunty Pig, \"it ought to be quite safe for me to go to the farmhouse. And as soon as I have a chance to get out of this pen I'll do as you suggest.\"  \"Good!\" cried Moses Mouse. And he said that he hoped to have many a chat with Grunty, at the farmhouse.  \"Umph!\" said Grunty Pig. And Mr. Mouse was much pleased, for he took that to mean \"Yes!\"     XXIV  A PIG IN THE PARLOR   Grunty Pig had got out of his pen and out of the piggery, too. Ever since his talk with Moses Mouse the day before he had been hoping for a chance to escape. And shuffling across the farmyard somewhat heavily--for he was growing longer and taller and fatter every day--Grunty went straight to the woodshed door. It was open. And he walked through it. Then he clattered over the woodshed floor and peered into the kitchen. There was no one there.  For a few moments Grunty stood sniffing in the doorway. A delicious odor greeted him. He wasn't sure what it was. A pan sat near the edge of the table. And Grunty Pig had no trouble upsetting it with his nose.  Doughnuts rolled in every direction--crisp, brown, freshly fried doughnuts. And Grunty Pig showed that he was thoughtful. He went to the trouble of picking them all up off the floor. But he forgot to drop them back into the pan. Instead, he put every one of them into his own mouth.  \"That Moses Mouse was all wrong,\" he murmured. \"He complained of the food here. When I see him I'll have to tell him that he was mistaken. Why, I never ate anything that tasted better than these rings!\"  After making sure that there was nothing else for him to devour in the kitchen Grunty Pig pushed through a door that stood ajar. He found himself in a long, dimly lighted hall. There were doors on both sides of it. Grunty nosed around each one in turn. Not till he came to the last of all, at the further end of the hall, did he find one that wasn't shut tight. This door yielded to a little gentle pushing. And Grunty then found himself--though he did not know it--in the parlor of the farmhouse.  As he stood still and gazed about him, who should come stealing into the room but Moses Mouse.  \"Ah!\" said Moses in a whisper. \"So you've arrived at last?\"  \"Yes!\" said Grunty Pig. \"Isn't this a fine pen? Now that I've come to the farmhouse to live I believe I'll make this pen my headquarters.\"  \"That's a good idea,\" Moses Mouse told him. \"Farmer Green's family don't use it often. They seldom come here unless they have company.\"  While he listened, Grunty Pig sidled up to a table in the center of the room and began, in an absent-minded fashion, to rub his back against it. To his surprise, the table tipped over and a lamp that had stood upon it crashed into a hundred pieces on the floor. Then a door slammed somewhere. And steps sounded in the hall.  Moses Mouse tried not to look startled.  \"I must be going now,\" he said abruptly. \"I'll see you later.\" Then he dashed into the fireplace and ran up the chimney.  \"The accident was really your fault,\" Grunty called to him. \"If you hadn't talked so much I'd have noticed what I was doing.\"  Moses Mouse, however, did not reply. And a moment later Farmer Green's wife appeared in the doorway. When she saw Grunty Pig she gave a scream. Mrs. Green couldn't help being surprised at first. But soon she began to laugh as if she would never stop.  \"A pig in our parlor!\" she cried. \"Who ever would have thought it?\"  Grunty Pig tried to explain that the broken lamp was really Moses Mouse's fault. But Mrs. Green wouldn't listen. She ran out of the room and came back at once with a broom in her hand. Then, opening the front door, she drove Grunty Pig into the yard.  \"Now, I wonder why Mrs. Green put me out of the farmhouse,\" he muttered.  Suddenly an idea popped into his head. \"It must be,\" he cried, \"because I told tales. I tattled on Moses Mouse; and Mrs. Green didn't like it. Next time I'll be careful about what I say to her.\"  There never was a next time. Perhaps Farmer Green took pains to keep the door of Grunty's pen shut. Perhaps Farmer Green made the fence outside the piggery \"hog tight,\" as he would say. Or perhaps Grunty Pig grew so fat that he couldn't squeeze through any ordinary opening.  Anyhow, Grunty never set foot inside the farmhouse again. After a while he didn't care. The bigger he was, the less he liked to roam about. And at last Farmer Green began calling him his \"prize hog.\"  So you can see how very fat he must have been.
