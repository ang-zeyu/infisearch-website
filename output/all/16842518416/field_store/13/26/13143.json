The Queen understands that there is a negotiation with Sweden and Denmark pending about the cessation of their tribute to Morocco, likewise that Prince Metternich has sent a despatch condemning as unfair the understanding come to between us and France about the Spanish marriage;[2] that there is a notion of exchanging Hong Kong for a more healthy colony.  The Queen, taking a deep interest in all these matters, and feeling it her duty to do so, begs Lord Aberdeen to keep her always well informed of what is on the _tapis_ in his Department.      [Footnote 2: _See ante_, vol. i. p. 487.]     _Queen Victoria to the Earl of Aberdeen._  CLAREMONT, _13th January 1844._  The Queen has received Lord Aberdeen's letter of the 10th, and returns him the papers which he sent her, with her best thanks. She does not remember to have seen them before.  The Queen takes this opportunity to beg Lord Aberdeen to cause the despatches to be sent a little sooner from the Foreign Office, as drafts in particular have often come to the Queen a week or a fortnight after they had actually been sent across the sea.  With respect to the Hanoverian Orders, Lord Aberdeen has not quite understood what the Queen meant. It was Sir C. Thornton and others to whom the Queen had refused permission to accept the favour, on a former occasion, by which the King of Hanover was much affronted. The Queen would not like to have herself additionally fettered by any new regulation, but Lord Aberdeen will certainly concur with the Queen that it would not be expedient to give to the King of Hanover a power which the Queen herself does not possess, viz. that of granting orders as favours, or for personal services; as the number of the different classes of the Guelphic Order bestowed on Englishmen is innumerable, it would actually invest the King with such a power, which, considering how much such things are sought after, might be extremely inconvenient.  The Queen will not give a final decision upon this case until she returns to Windsor, where she has papers explanatory of the reasons which caused her to decline the King of Hanover's application in 1838.     [Pageheading: A CARRIAGE ACCIDENT]   _Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._  CLAREMONT, _16th January 1844._  MY DEAREST UNCLE,--Many thanks for your kind letter of the 11th. Louise can give you the details of the little upset I and Lady Douro had, and which I did not think worth while to mention.[3] It was the strangest thing possible to happen, and the most _unlikely_, for we were going quite quietly, not at all in a narrow lane, with very quiet ponies and my usual postillion; the fact was that the boy looked the _wrong_ way, and therefore did not perceive the ditch which he so cleverly got us into.  We leave dear Claremont, as usual, with the greatest regret; we are so peaceable here; Windsor is beautiful and comfortable, but it is a _palace_, and God knows _how willingly_ I would _always_ live with my beloved Albert and our children in the quiet and retirement of private life, and not be the constant object of observation, and of newspaper articles. The children (Pussette and Bertie) have been most remarkably well, and so have we, in spite of the very bad weather we had most days. I am truly and really grieved that good excellent Nemours is again _not_ to get his _dotation_.[4] Really we constitutional countries are _too shabby_.  Now, dearest Uncle, I must bid you adieu, begging you to believe me, ever your devoted Niece,  VICTORIA R.

I am glad Leo will appear at the next ball; he is nearly nine years old, and it is good to accustom children of his rank early to these things.  Guizot's speech is exceedingly admired, with the exception of his having said more than he was justified to do about the right of search.[5] Our speech has been very difficult to frame; we should like to have mentioned our visits to France and Belgium, but it has been found impossible to do so; _France is_ mentioned, and it is the first time since 1834!  To-morrow we go up to Town \"pour ce bore,\" as the good King always said to me; whenever there were tiresome people to present he always said: \"Je vous demande pardon de ce _bore_.\"  I have had a tiresome though not at all violent cold which _I was_ alarmed might spoil the _sonorousness_ of my voice for the speech on Thursday, but it promises well now.  I own I always look with horror to the beginning of a Parliamentary campaign.  With Albert's love. Ever your devoted Niece,  VICTORIA R.

Our promised visit, our dearest Papa's, and our fondest wish, all is put an end to. The violence of our grief may be over, but the desolate feeling which succeeds it is worse, and tears are a relief. I have never known real _grief_ till now, and it has made a lasting impression on me. A father is _such_ a _near_ relation, you are a _piece_ of him in fact,--and all (as my poor _deeply afflicted_ Angel says) the earliest pleasures of your life were given you by a dear father; that can _never be replaced_ though time may soften the pang. And indeed one loves to _cling_ to one's grief; I can understand Louise's feeling in her overwhelming sorrows.  Let me now join my humble entreaties to Albert's, relative to the request about dearest Louise, which he has made. It is a sacrifice I ask, but if you _knew_ the sacrifice I make in letting and urging Albert _to go_, I am sure, if you _can_ you _will_ grant it. I have _never_ been separated from him even for _one night_, and the _thought of such_ a separation is quite dreadful; still, I feel I _could_ bear it,--I have made up my mind to it, as the very _thought_ of going has been a comfort to my poor Angel, and will be of such use at Coburg. Still, if I were to remain _quite_ alone I do not think I _could_ bear it quietly. Therefore _pray_ do send me my dearly beloved Louise; she would be _such_ a comfort to me; if you could come too--or afterwards (as you promised us a longer visit), that would be still more delightful. I may be indiscreet, but you must think of _what_ the separation from my _all and all_, even only for a _fortnight_, will be to me!  We feel some _years_ older since these days of mourning. Mamma is calm, but poor Aunt Julia[7] is indeed much to be pitied. Ever, dearest Uncle, your devoted and unhappy Niece and Child,  VICTORIA R.      [Footnote 6: The Duke of Saxe-Coburg Gotha died on 29th     January.]      [Footnote 7: The Grand Duchess Constantine of Russia,     sister of the Duchess of Kent and of the deceased Duke of     Saxe-Coburg.]     [Pageheading: BEREAVEMENT]   _Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._  WINDSOR CASTLE, _13th February 1844._  MY DEAREST UNCLE,--I received your dear, kind but sad letter of the 8th on Sunday, and thank you much for it. God knows, poor dear Uncle, you have suffered _enough_ in your life, but you should think, dearest Uncle, of _that blessed_ assurance of _eternity_ where we shall _all meet again never_ to part; you should think (as we constantly do now) that those whom we have lost are far happier than we are, and _love us_ still, and in a far more perfect way than _we can_ do in this world! When the first moments and days of overwhelming grief are over these reflections are the greatest balm, the greatest consolation to the bleeding heart.  I hope you will kindly let me have a few lines of _hope_ by the Tuesday's messenger. Ever your truly devoted Niece and Child,  VICTORIA R.  _P.S._--O'Connell's being pronounced guilty is a great triumph.[8]      [Footnote 8: He had been indicted with Charles Gavan Duffy and     others for seditious conspiracy.]     _Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._  SOUTH STREET, _3rd April 1844._  Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty, with many thanks for your Majesty's note of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24780"],["title","The Letters of Queen Victoria : A Selection from her Majesty's correspondence (#3)"],["body"," 28th ult. Lord Melbourne believes that your Majesty is quite right in saying that Lord Melbourne has still some health left, if he will but take care of it. Lord Melbourne told Dr Holland, without mentioning your Majesty's name, that this had been said to him by a friend, and Dr Holland immediately said that it was very just and true, and very well expressed, and quite what he should have said himself. At the same time, the change from strength to weakness and the evident progress of decadence is a very hard and disagreeable trial. Lord Melbourne has been reading Cicero on old age, a very pretty treatise, but he does not find much consolation after it; the principal practical resources and alleviations which he recommends are agriculture and gardening, to both of which, but more particularly to the latter, Lord Melbourne has already had recourse. It is certainly, as your Majesty says, wrong to be impatient and to repine at everything, but still it is difficult not to be so. Lady Uxbridge's death[9] is a shocking event, a dreadful loss to him and to all. Lord Melbourne always liked her. Lord Melbourne is going down to Brocket Hall to-morrow, and will try to get Uxbridge and the girls to come over and dine.  Lord Melbourne has felt very much for the grief which your Majesty must feel at a separation, even short and temporary, from the Prince, and it is extremely amiable to feel comforted by the recollection of the extreme pleasure which his visit will give to his and your Majesty's relations. It is, of course, impossible that your Majesty should in travelling divest yourself of your character and dignity.  Lord Melbourne has just driven round the Regent's Park, where there are many almond trees in bloom, and looking beautiful.

Peel that the Court of Directors, after all, mean to recall Lord Ellenborough. She cannot but consider this _very_ unwise at this critical moment, and a very ungrateful return for the eminent services Lord Ellenborough has rendered to the Company in India. They ought not to forget so soon in what state Lord Ellenborough found affairs in 1842. The Queen would not be sorry if these gentlemen knew that this is her opinion.     _The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._  Laeken, _3rd May 1844._  MY DEAREST VICTORIA,--Whenever you wish to make me _truly happy_, you will have the power of doing so by repeating expressions as kind and affectionate as those contained in your dear little letter of the 30th. I have ever had the care and affection of a _real father_ for you, and it has perhaps even been freer from many drawbacks which occasionally will exist betwixt parents and children, be they ever so well and affectionately together. With me, even from the moment in January 1820, when I was called by a messenger to Sidmouth, my care for you has been unremitting, and never has there been a cloud between us.... A thing which often strikes me, in a very satisfactory manner, is that we never had any bitter words, a thing which happens even with people who are very lovingly together; and the little row which we had in 1838 you remember well, and do not now think that _I_ was wrong.[11] _De pareilles relations sont rares; may they ever continue!_  I cannot leave this more serious topic without adding that though you were always warm-hearted and right-minded, it must strike yourself how matured every kind and good feeling is in your generous heart. _The heart, and not the head, is the safest guide in positions like yours_, and this not only for this earthly and very short life, but for that which we must hope for hereafter. When a life draws nearer its close, how many earthly concerns are there that appear _still in the same light_? and how clearly the mind is struck that nothing has been and is still of _real_ value, than the nobler and better feelings of the heart; the only good we can hope to keep as a precious store for the future. What do we keep of youth, beauty, richness, power, and even the greatest extent of earthly possessions? NOTHING! ... Your truly devoted Uncle,  LEOPOLD R.

Lord Ellenborough may be at liberty (should your Majesty approve) to notify this publicly in India--and thus make it known that the general line of policy recently pursued has had the full sanction of your Majesty, and will not be departed from.  These were the honours conferred upon Lord Auckland.  If they were conferred _on the instant_, it might rather seem a rebuke to the East India Company than a deliberate approval of the conduct of Lord Ellenborough, but these honours might shortly follow the conclusion of the affair respecting the selection of Lord Ellenborough's successor, and any discussion that may arise in Parliament.     [Pageheading: THE PRINCE DE JOINVILLE'S _BROCHURE_]   _Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._  CLAREMONT, _24th May 1844._  DEAREST UNCLE,--Though _not_ my day I must write you a line to say _how vexed_ we are at this _most unfortunate_ and _most imprudent brochure_ of Joinville's;[12] it has made a _very bad_ effect here, and will rouse all the envy and hatred between the _two Navies_ again, which it was our great effort to subdue--and this _all_ for _nothing!_ I can't tell you how angry people are, and how poor Hadjy will get abused. And this _all_ after our having been on such intimate terms with him and having _sailed_ with him! If he comes here, _what_ shall we do? Receive with open arms one who has talked of ravaging our coasts and burning our towns? Indeed it is most lamentable; you know how we like him, and that therefore it must be very annoying to us to see him get himself into such a scrape. _We_ shall overlook it, but the people _here_ won't! It _will_ blow over, but it will do immense harm. We who wish to become more and more closely united with the French family are, of course, much put out by this return. We shall forgive and forget, and feel it was _not_ intended to be published--but the public _here_ will _not_ so easily, and will put the worst construction on it all.  Pray, dearest Uncle, tell me what _could_ possess Joinville to write it, and still more to have it printed? Won't it annoy the King and Nemours very much? _Enfin c'est malheureux, c'est indiscret au plus haut degré_--and it provokes and vexes us sadly. Tell me _all_ you _know_ and think about it; for you _can_ do so with perfect safety by our courier.  I have written dearest Louise an account of my _old_ birthday, which will please you, I think. The weather is very fine. Ever your _truly_ devoted Niece and Child,  VICTORIA R.  [Footnote 12: The _brochure_ was entitled, _Notes sur les forces navales de la France_. The Prince de Joinville wrote as follows to the Queen: \"Le malheureux éclat de ma brochure, le tracas que cela donne au Père et à la Reine, me font regretter vivement de l'avoir faite. Comme je l'écris à ton Roi, je ne renvoie que mépris à toutes les interprétations qu'on y donne; ce que peuvent dire ministre et journaux ne me touche en rien, mais il n'y a pas de sacrifices que je ne suis disposé à faire pour l'intérieur de la Famille.\"]     [Pageheading: THE CZAR NICHOLAS]   _Queen Victoria to the Earl of Aberdeen._  _29th May 1844._  If Lord Aberdeen should not have read the Prince de Joinville's pamphlet, the Queen recommends him to do so, as one cannot judge fairly by the extracts in the newspapers. Though it does not lessen the extreme imprudence of the Prince's publishing what must do harm to the various French Governments, it certainly is _not_ intentionally written to offend England, and on the contrary frankly proves _us_ to be immensely superior to the French Navy in every way.     _Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._  WINDSOR CASTLE, _4th June 1844._  MY BELOVED UNCLE,--I gave Louise a long and detailed description of the Emperor,[13] etc. The papers are full of the details. A great event and a great compliment _his_ visit certainly is, and the people _here_ are extremely flattered at it. He is certainly a _very striking_ man; still very handsome; his profile is _beautiful_, and his manners _most_ dignified and graceful; extremely civil--quite alarmingly so, as he is so full of attentions and _politesses_. But the expression of the _eyes_ is _formidable_, and unlike anything I ever saw before. He gives me and Albert the impression of a man who is _not_ happy, and on whom the weight of his immense power and position weighs heavily and"]]]
