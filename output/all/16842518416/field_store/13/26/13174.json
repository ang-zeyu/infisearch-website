Leopard might come and pull it down.\"  \"Yes: don't let Duke be out of a night; there has been one hanging about lately.--But what are you going to do?\"  \"Dissect him,\" said Dyke, who was on his knees with his sharp sheath-knife in his hand.  \"Nonsense!  Leave it now.\"  \"I want to see the poor old goblin's gizzard, and open it.  I know he has got knives and all sorts of things inside.\"  \"Then you may look,\" said Emson.  \"I'm going to feed the horses and have a wash; they haven't been unsaddled yet.\"  He went to the thorn-fence and disappeared, while, hot and tired now, Dyke made short work of opening the great bird, and dragging out the gizzard, which he opened as a cook does that of a fowl, and exclaimed aloud at the contents:  \"Here, Jack, fetch me some water in the tin;\" and while the \"boy\" was gone, Dyke scraped out on to the sand quite a heap of pieces of flinty stone, rough crystals, and some pieces of iron, rusty nails, and a good-sized piece of hoop.  \"I must have a look at you afterwards,\" said the boy, as he picked out some forty or fifty of the dingy-looking rough crystals, gave them a rub over and over in the dry sand upon which he knelt, to dry them, and then thrust them--a good handful--into his pocket.  \"Do for the collection,\" he said to himself with a laugh.  \"Label: crystals of quartz, discovered in a goblin's gizzard by Vandyke Emson, Esquire, F.A.S., Kopfontein, South Africa.\"  \"Wanterwater?\"  \"Yes, I do `wanterwater,'\" cried Dyke, turning sharply on the Kaffir, who had returned.  \"I want to wash my hands.  Look at 'em, Jack!\"  \"Narcy!\" said the man, making a grimace.  \"Hold hard, though; let's have a drink first,\" cried the boy.  \"It looks clean;\" and raising the tin, he took a deep draught before using the vessel for a good wash, taking a handful of sand in the place of soap.  \"Find the knife?\" said Emson, coming back from the stable.  \"No, but look here,\" cried Dyke, pointing to the great piece of hoop-iron.  \"Fancy a bird swallowing that.\"  \"Iron is good for birds, I suppose,\" said Emson quietly.--\"Here, Jack, drag that bird right away off; remember, a good way.  Mind, I don't want the jackals too close to-night.\"  The Kaffir nodded, seized the bird's legs as if they were the shafts of a cart or handles of a wheelbarrow.  The load was heavy, though, and he shook his head, with reason, for such a bird weighed three hundred pounds, and it spoke well for its leg muscles that it could go at the rate of forty or fifty miles an hour.  \"Too big,\" grumbled Jack; so Dyke seized one of the legs, and together they walked away with the dead bird, dragging it quite a quarter of a mile out beyond the ostrich-pens, ready for the jackals to come and play scavenger.  After which Dyke returned to his brother, and they went in to where Tanta Sal, Jack's wife, had prepared a substantial meal.    CHAPTER FIVE.  BIG BIRDNESTING.  \"You're a dissatisfied young dog, Dyke,\" cried Joe Emson good-humouredly, as he smiled down from his high horse at his brother; \"always grumbling.\"  \"I'm not,\" cried Dyke indignantly.  \"You are, boy.  Just as if any one could be low-spirited when he is young and strong, out in this wide free place on such a lovely morning.\"  \"It's all right enough now,\" replied Dyke, \"because it's early and cool; but it is so horribly lonely.\"  \"Lonely!  Why, I'm always with you,\" cried Emson--\"the best of company. Then you've Jack and Tanta Sal, and Duke, and Breezy, and all the ostriches for pets, and the oxen; while, if you want more company, there's old Oom Schlagen out one way, and old Morgenstern out the other.\"  \"Ugh!  Stupid old Boers!\" cried Dyke.  \"Well, they're civil to you, and that's more than Oom Schlagen is to me. It's because you have got that Dutch name.  I say, father meant you to be a painter, I'll be bound, and here you are, an ostrich-farmer.\"  \"Oh yes, and we're going to be very rich when the birds are all dead.\"  \"And they seem as if they meant to die, all of them,\" said Emson sadly, as he rode along by his brother, each with his rifle across his saddle-bow.  \"I don't seem to have got hold of the right way of managing them, Dyke: we must follow nature more by watching the habits of the wild ones.  I have tried so hard, too.\"  \"Ha, ha, ha!\" laughed Dyke merrily.  \"Who's grumbling now!\"  \"That's better, and more like yourself, old fellow,\" said Emson, smiling down pleasantly.  \"That's more like the light-hearted chap who promised to stick to and help me like a brother should.  You hurt me, Dyke, when you turn so low-spirited and sulky.  I've plenty of troubles, though I say little, over my venture here; and when I see you so down, it worries me more than I can say.\"  They rode on over the open veldt that glorious morning in silence for some minutes, and Dyke looked down at his horse's mane.  \"It makes me feel that I have done wrong in bringing a bright, happy lad away from home and his studies to this wild solitary place.  I ought to have known better, and that it was not natural for a boy like you to feel the hard stern determination to get on that I, ten years older, possessed.  I ought to have known that, as soon as the novelty had passed away, you would begin to long for change.  Father did warn me, but I said to him: `I'm a man, and he's only a boy; but we've been together so much, and always been companions, Dyke and I can't help getting on together.'\"  \"And we can't,\" cried the boy in a husky voice.  \"Don't, please don't, Joe, old chap; I can't bear it.  I've been a beast.\"  \"Oh, come, come,\" cried Emson, leaning over to clap him on the shoulder; \"I didn't mean to upset you like that.\"  \"But I'm glad you have,\" cried Dyke in half-suffocated tones.  \"I know well enough I have been a beast to you, Joe, and the more quiet and patient you've been with me, the worse I've got, till I quite hate myself.\"  \"Oh no, not so bad as that.\"  \"Yes,\" cried Dyke excitedly, \"it's been worse; and all the while you've been the dear, good old chap to me; just the same as it always was when I was little, and grew tired and cross when we were out, and you took me up on your back and carried me miles and miles home.\"  \"Why, of course I did,\" said Emson, smiling.  \"There's no of course in it.  I was always petty and disagreeable, and ready to impose on your good-nature; but you never had an unkind word for me.\"  \"Well, you were such a little one, and I was always so big.\"  \"I can see it all, Joe, and it's made me miserable many a time; but the kinder you've been, the worse it has made me.  You and father always spoiled and petted me.\"  \"Not we.  Only kind to you, because we liked you.  I say, Dyke, what games we used to have!  You see, I never had a brother till you came. There, it's all right.  Now then for a canter.\"  \"Not yet,\" said Dyke.  \"I feel as if I could talk to you this morning.\"  \"But you have talked, and it's all over now; so come along.\"  \"No,\" cried Dyke firmly, and he caught his brother's rein.  \"I say, old chap, are you the boss here, or am I?\"  \"I am, this morning,\" said the boy, looking up in his brother's big manly face.  \"I want you to listen to me.\"  \"Well, go ahead then, and let's get it over.\"  \"It's been like this, Joe.  I've got in a bad way of thinking lately. It's all been so disappointing, and no matter what one did, nothing came right.\"  \"Yes, that's true enough, old chap,\" said Emson, rather drearily; \"and we have tried precious hard.\"  \"You have, Joe, and I've been a regular sulky, disappointed sort of brute.\"  \"Coat been a bit rough, Dyke, old chap, eh?  Out of sorts.\"  \"I suppose in my head; but, Joe, I am sorry--I can't say it as I should like to, but I--I will try now.\"  \"Just as if I didn't know.  We've been chums so long, old man, ever since you first took to me when I was a big stupid fellow, all legs like a colt, and as ugly, and you were a pretty little golden-haired chap, always wanting to stick your soft chubby little fist in my big paw. There, it's all right.  Old times again, old un, and we're going to do it yet, eh?\"  \"And you'll forgive me, Joe?\" said Dyke earnestly.  \"Forgive you?\" cried Emson, looking at his brother with his big pleasant manly face all in wrinkles.  \"Get along with you!  What is there to forgive?\"  \"I will try now and help you, Joe; I will, indeed.\"  \"Of course you will, old chap,\" cried Joe, a little huskily too; \"and if you and I can't win yet, in spite of the hot sun and the disease and the wicked ways of those jolly old stilt-stalkers, nobody can.\"  \"Yes, we will win, Joe,\" cried Dyke enthusiastically.  \"That's your sort!\" cried Emson.  \"We'll have a good long try, and if the ostriches don't pay, we'll hunt, as, I know, we've got plenty of room out here: we'll have an elephant farm instead, and grow ivory, and have a big warehouse for making potted elephant to send and sell at home for a breakfast appetiser.  Who's going to give up, eh?  Now, then, what about this canter?  The horses want a breather--they're getting fidgety. I say, feel better now, old chap, don't you?\"  Dyke pinched his lips together and nodded shortly.  \"So do I.--Here!  What's that?\"  He checked his horse, and pointed far away in the distance.  \"Ostrich!\" cried Dyke.  \"Yes, I saw her rise and start off!  My word! how she is going.  I can see the spot where she got up, and must keep my eyes on it.  There's a nest there, for a pound.  That means luck this morning.  Come along steady.  Lucky I brought the net.  Why, Dyke, old chap, the tide's going to turn, and we shall do it yet.\"  \"But the goblin's dead.\"  \"Good job, too.  There's as good ostriches in the desert as ever came out, though they are fowl instead of fish.  It's my belief we shall snatch out of that nest a better game-cock bird than ever the goblin was, and without his temper.  Come along.\"  Dyke felt glad of the incident occurring"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24821"],["title","Diamond Dyke (#5)"],["body","it did, for his mind was in a peculiar state just then.  His feelings were mingled.  He felt relieved and satisfied by having shifted something off his mind, but at the same time there would come a sense of false shame, and a fancy that he had behaved childishly, when it was as brave and manly a speech--that confession--as ever came from his lips.  All the same, on they rode.  And now the sky looked brighter; there seemed to be an elasticity in the air.  Breezy had never carried Dyke so well before, and a sensation came over him, making him feel that he must shout and sing and slacken his rein, and gallop as hard as the cob could go.  \"Yohoy there! steady, lad,\" cried Emson; \"not so fast, or I shall lose the spot.  It's hard work, little un, keeping your eye on anything, with the horse pitching you up and down.\"  Hard work, indeed, for there was no tree, bush, or hillock out in the direction they were taking, and by which the young Englishman could mark down the spot where he imagined the nest to be.  So Dyke slackened speed, and with his heart throbbing in a pleasantly exhilarated fashion, he rode steadily on beside his brother, feeling as if the big fellow were the boy once more whom as a child he used to tease and be chased playfully in return.  Emson's way of speaking, too, enhanced the feeling.  \"I say, little un,\" he cried, \"what a game if there's no nest after all. You won't be disappointed, will you?\"  \"Of course not.\"  \"'Member me climbing the big elm at the bottom of the home-close to get the mag's nest?\"  \"To be sure I do.\"  \"Didn't think we two would ever go bird's-nesting in Africa then, did we?\"  \"No; but do you think there is a nest out yonder, Joe?\"  \"I do,\" cried Emson, \"I've seen several hen birds about the last few days; but I never could make out which way they came or went.  I've been on the lookout, too, for one rising from the ground.\"  \"But is this a likely place for a nest?\"  \"Well, isn't it?  I should say it's the very spot.  Now, just look: here we are in an open plain, where a bird can squat down in the sand and look around for twenty miles--if she can see so far--in every direction, and see danger coming, whether it's a man, a lion, or a jackal, and shuffle off her nest, and make tracks long before whatever it is gets near enough to make out where she rose.  Of course I don't know whether we shall find the nest, if there is one.  It's hard enough to find a lark's or a partridge's nest at home in an open field of forty or fifty acres; so of course, big though the nest is, and the bird, it's a deal harder, out in a field hundreds of miles square, eh?\"  \"Of course it is.\"  \"'Scuse my not looking round at you when I'm speaking, old chap; but if I take my eye off the spot, I shall never find it again.\"  \"I say, don't be so jolly particular, Joe,\" cried Dyke, laughing.  \"Why not?  It's just what you and I ought to be,\" said the big fellow with simple earnestness.  \"We're out here in a savage land, but we don't want to grow into savages, nor yet to be as blunt and gruff as two bears.  I'm not going to forget that the dear old governor at home is a gentleman, even if his sons do rough it out here.\"  \"Till they're regular ruffians, Joe.--I say: see the nest?\"  \"Oh no; it's a mile away yet.\"  \"Then there isn't one.  You couldn't have seen it at all that distance.\"  \"I never said I could see the nest, did I?  It was enough for me that I've seen the birds about, and that I caught sight of that one making off this morning.  We call them stupid, and they are in some things; but they're precious cunning in others.\"  \"But if they were only feeding?\"  \"Why, then, there's no nest.  But I say breeding, and not feeding; and that's rhyme if you take it in time, as the old woman said.\"  \"But you talked about hen birds.  Then there may be more than one nest?\"  \"Not here.  Why, you know how a lot of them lay in the same nest.\"  \"At home, shut up in pens, but not on the veldt.\"  \"Why, of course they do, and 'tis their nature to, like the bears and lions in Dr Watts.  You don't know everything quite yet, old chap.  If you took the glass, and came and lay out here for two or three days and nights, and always supposing the birds didn't see you--because if they did they'd be deserting the nest and go somewhere else--you'd see first one hen come to lay and then another, perhaps six of them; and when they'd packed the nest as full as it would hold, with the sand banked up round the eggs to keep them tight in their places with the points downwards, so as to be close, you'd see hen after hen come and take her turn, sitting all day, while the cock bird comes at nights and takes his turn, because he's bigger and stronger, and better able to pitch into the prowling jackals.\"  \"How did you know all this, Joe?\"  \"Partly observation, partly from what I've heard Jack say,\" replied Emson modestly.  \"Everything comes in useful.  I daresay you won't repent saving up all those odds and ends of stones and shells and eggs you've got at home.\"  \"Why, I often thought you'd feel they were a nuisance, Joe.  I did see you laugh at them more than once.\"  \"Smile, old man, smile--that's all.  I like it.  You might grow a regular museum out of small beginnings like that.\"  \"Then we ought to have stuffed the goblin,\" cried Dyke merrily.  \"Oh, come, no; that wouldn't do.  Our tin house isn't the British Museum; but I would go on collecting bits of ore and things.  You may find something worth having one of these days, besides picking up a lot of knowledge.  I'd put that piece of old iron the ostrich swallowed along with the rest.\"  \"Would you?\"  \"Yes; but now let's have all eyes, and no tongues, old chap.  We are getting near where that bird got up off the nest.\"  \"If there was one.\"  \"If there was one,\" assented Emson.  \"Now then: think you're mushrooming out in the old field at home, and see if you can't find the nest.  Move off now a couple of hundred yards, and keep your eyes open.\"  Dyke followed out his brother's advice, and for the next hour they rode over the ground here and there, to and fro, and across and across, scanning the sandy depressions, till Emson suddenly drew rein, and shouted to Dyke, who was a quarter of a mile away.  Dyke sent his cob off at a gallop and joined him.  \"Found it?\" he cried excitedly.  \"No, old fellow.  It's a failure this time.  Man wants sharp eyes to get the better of an ostrich.  I made sure we should get it, but we're done. We've been over the ground times enough, and it's of no use.\"  \"What! give up?\" cried Dyke merrily.  \"Didn't say we'd find it the first time, but I mean to have that nest, if I try till to-morrow morning.\"  \"Well done, little un,\" shouted Emson, laughing.  \"That's the right spirit, and I should like to have had the eggs; it would have started us on again.  But I'm afraid we shall be wasting time, for we've lost count now of the position where I saw the bird rise, and in this great waste we may wander farther and farther away.\"  \"But we can tell by the hoof-marks where we've been.\"  \"Yes; and we've pretty well examined the ground.  I tell you what, we'll bring the glass this evening, and lie down watching till dark.  We may see a bird come to the nest, and then we'll mark down the place, and one shall stop back, while the other rides forward, and number one can telegraph which way to go with his arms.\"  \"I am disappointed,\" said Dyke, looking round about him over the level plain.  \"So am I, old chap, but we won't be damped.  It's only putting it off.-- What are you looking at?\"  \"That,\" said Dyke; and, kicking his nag's sides, he went off at a canter for a couple of hundred yards, and then sent up a joyous shout.  \"Why, he has found it!\" cried Emson; and galloping up, there sat Dyke, flushed and happy, beside a depression in the sand, evidently scraped out, and with the sand banked round to keep the eggs in their places. There they all were, thirty-nine in number, neatly arranged with their points downward, while outside were several more, and on Dyke bending down, he found that they were all of a comfortable temperature; those lying outside being cold, and apparently freshly laid.  \"Well, you have eyes, old chap!\" cried Emson, slapping his brother on the shoulder, and then proceeding to loosen a coarsely meshed net from behind his saddle.  \"Bravo, Dyke!  I told you the tide had turned. We'll get these home at once and put them under one of our hens. Shouldn't wonder if we get a nice little lot of chicks from these.\"  \"If we can get them home without breaking.\"  \"Oh, we'll do that,\" cried Emson, dismounting and spreading out the net upon the sand before they began carefully removing the spoil of the nest--that is to say, the eggs, which evidently contained chicks.  This done, the net was folded over and tied here and there so as to form a long bag, the ends fastened securely; and each taking an end, they mounted, and swinging between them the huge bag, which now weighed nearly a hundredweight, started for home.  They left the new-laid eggs to be fetched that evening, or next morning, leaving them just as they were spread, looking clean and fresh, about the outside of the nest, much to Dyke's regret.  \"Why, we could manage them too,\" he said.  \"We might, but if we did we should have mixed them up with the others, which would be a pity; for if we put them under a bird, they would only be addled, whereas if we keep them separate, they will be good either to set under another hen, or to eat.  They will not hurt there.\"  Dyke said no more, but held on tightly to the end of the net, helping his brother to keep their horses a sufficient distance apart, so that the egg purse might keep well off the ground, and not be shaken too much by the horses' gentle pace.  \"Wonder what the young birds think of their ride,\" said Dyke merrily. \"We shall have one of them chipping an egg presently, and poking out his head to see what's the matter, and why things are getting so cold.\"  \"Cold, in"]]]
