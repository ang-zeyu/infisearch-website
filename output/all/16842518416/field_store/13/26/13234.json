Then she said quietly, \"Sometimes I have thought, Esterbrook, that it might be better--if we were never married at all.\"  Esterbrook turned a startled face upon her.  \"Not married at all! Marian, what do you mean?\"  \"Just what I say. I do not think we are as well suited to each other after all as we have fancied. We have loved each other as brother and sister might--that is all. I think it will be best to be brother and sister forever--nothing more.\"  Esterbrook sprang to his feet.  \"Marian, do you know what you are saying? You surely cannot have heard--no one could have told you--\"  \"I have heard nothing,\" she interrupted hurriedly. \"No one has told me anything. I have only said what I have been thinking of late. I am sure we have made a mistake. It is not too late to remedy it. You will not refuse my request, Esterbrook? You will set me free?\"  \"Good heavens, Marian!\" he said hoarsely. \"I cannot realize that you are in earnest. Have you ceased to care for me?\" The rigidly locked hands were clasped a little tighter.  \"No--I shall always care for you as my friend if you will let me. But I know we could not make each other happy--the time for that has gone by. I would never be satisfied, nor would you. Esterbrook, will you release me from a promise which has become an irksome fetter?\"  He looked down on her upturned face mistily. A great joy was surging up in his heart--yet it was mingled with great regret.  He knew--none better--what was passing out of his life, what he was losing when he lost that pure, womanly nature.  \"If you really mean this, Marian,\" he said slowly, \"if you really have come to feel that your truest love is not and never can be mine--that I cannot make you happy--then there is nothing for me to do but to grant your request. You are free.\"  \"Thank you, dear,\" she said gently, as she stood up.  She slipped his ring from her finger and held it out to him. He took it mechanically. He still felt dazed and unreal.  Marian held out her hand.  \"Good-night, Esterbrook,\" she said, a little wearily. \"I feel tired. I am glad you see it all in the same light as I do.\"  \"Marian,\" he said earnestly, clasping the outstretched hand, \"are you sure that you will be happy--are you sure that you are doing a wise thing?\"  \"Quite sure,\" she answered, with a faint smile. \"I am not acting rashly. I have thought it all over carefully. Things are much better so, dear. We will always be friends. Your joys and sorrows will be to me as my own. When another love comes to bless your life, Esterbrook, I will be glad. And now, good-night. I want to be alone now.\"  At the doorway he turned to look back at her, standing in all her sweet stateliness in the twilight duskness, and the keen realization of all he had lost made him bow his head with a quick pang of regret.  Then he went out into the darkness of the summer night.  An hour later he stood alone on the little point where he had parted with Magdalen the night before. A restless night wind was moaning through the pines that fringed the bank behind him; the moon shone down radiantly, turning the calm expanse of the bay into a milk-white sheen.  He took Marian's ring from his pocket and kissed it reverently. Then he threw it from him far out over the water. For a second the diamond flashed in the moonlight; then, with a tiny splash, it fell among the ripples.  Esterbrook turned his face to the Cove, lying dark and silent in the curve between the crescent headlands. A solitary light glimmered from the low eaves of the Barrett cottage.  Tomorrow, was his unspoken thought, I will be free; to go back to Magdalen.     An Invitation Given on Impulse   It was a gloomy Saturday morning. The trees in the Oaklawn grounds were tossing wildly in the gusts of wind, and sodden brown leaves were blown up against the windows of the library, where a score of girls were waiting for the principal to bring the mail in.  The big room echoed with the pleasant sound of girlish voices and low laughter, for in a fortnight school would close for the holidays, and they were all talking about their plans and anticipations.  Only Ruth Mannering was, as usual, sitting by herself near one of the windows, looking out on the misty lawn. She was a pale, slender girl, with a sad face, and was dressed in rather shabby black. She had no special friend at Oaklawn, and the other girls did not know much about her. If they had thought about it at all, they would probably have decided that they did not like her; but for the most part they simply overlooked her.  This was not altogether their fault. Ruth was poor and apparently friendless, but it was not her poverty that was against her. Lou Scott, who was \"as poor as a church mouse,\" to quote her own frank admission, was the most popular girl in the seminary, the boon companion of the richest girls, and in demand with everybody. But Lou was jolly and frank and offhanded, while Ruth was painfully shy and reserved, and that was the secret of the whole matter.  There was \"no fun in her,\" the girls said, and so it came about that she was left out of their social life, and was almost as solitary at Oaklawn as if she had been the only girl there. She was there for the special purpose of studying music, and expected to earn her own living by teaching it when she left. She believed that the girls looked down on her on this account; this was unjust, of course, but Ruth had no idea how much her own coldness and reserve had worked against her.  Across the room Carol Golden was, as usual, the centre of an animated group; Golden Carol as her particular friends sometimes called her, partly because of her beautiful voice, and partly because of her wonderful fleece of golden hair. Carol was one of the seminary pets, and seemed to Ruth Mannering to have everything that she had not.  Presently the mail was brought in, and there was a rush to the table, followed by exclamations of satisfaction or disappointment. In a few minutes the room was almost deserted. Only two girls remained: Carol Golden, who had dropped into a big chair to read her many letters; and Ruth Mannering, who had not received any and had gone silently back to her part of the window.  Presently Carol gave a little cry of delight. Her mother had written that she might invite any friend she wished home with her to spend the holidays. Carol had asked for this permission, and now that it had come was ready to dance for joy. As to whom she would ask, there could be only one answer to that. Of course it must be her particular friend, Maud Russell, who was the cleverest and prettiest girl at Oaklawn, at least so her admirers said. She was undoubtedly the richest, and was the acknowledged \"leader.\" The girls affectionately called her \"Princess,\" and Carol adored her with that romantic affection that is found only among school girls. She knew, too, that Maud would surely accept her invitation because she did not intend to go home. Her parents were travelling in Europe, and she expected to spend her holidays with some cousins, who were almost strangers to her.  Carol was so much pleased that she felt as if she must talk to somebody, so she turned to Ruth.  \"Isn't it delightful to think that we'll all be going home in a fortnight?\"  \"Yes, very--for those that have homes to go to,\" said Ruth drearily.  Carol felt a quick pang of pity and self-reproach. \"Haven't you?\" she asked.  Ruth shook her head. In spite of herself, the kindness of Carol's tone brought the tears to her eyes.  \"My mother died a year ago,\" she said in a trembling voice, \"and since then I have had no real home. We were quite alone in the world, Mother and I, and now I have nobody.\"  \"Oh, I'm so sorry for you,\" cried Carol impulsively. She leaned forward and took Ruth's hand in a gentle way. \"And do you mean to say that you'll have to stay here all through the holidays? Why, it will be horrid.\"  \"Oh, I shall not mind it much,\" said Ruth quickly, \"with study and practice most of the time. Only now, when everyone is talking about it, it makes me wish that I had some place to go.\"  Carol dropped Ruth's hand suddenly in the shock of a sudden idea that darted into her mind.  A stray girl passing through the hall called out, \"Ruth, Miss Siviter wishes to see you about something in Room C.\"  Ruth got up quickly. She was glad to get away, for it seemed to her that in another minute she would break down altogether.  Carol Golden hardly noticed her departure. She gathered up her letters and went abstractedly to her room, unheeding a gay call for \"Golden Carol\" from a group of girls in the corridor. Maud Russell was not in and Carol was glad. She wanted to be alone and fight down that sudden idea.  \"It is ridiculous to think of it,\" she said aloud, with a petulance very unusual in Golden Carol, whose disposition was as sunny as her looks. \"Why, I simply cannot. I have always been longing to ask Maud to visit me, and now that the chance has come I am not going to throw it away. I am very sorry for Ruth, of course. It must be dreadful to be all alone like that. But it isn't my fault. And she is so fearfully quiet and dowdy--what would they all think of her at home? Frank and Jack would make such fun of her. I shall ask Maud just as soon as she comes in.\"  Maud did come in presently, but Carol did not give her the invitation. Instead, she was almost snappish to her idol, and the Princess soon went out again in something of a huff.  \"Oh, dear,\" cried Carol, \"now I've offended her. What has got into me? What a disagreeable thing a conscience is, although I'm sure I don't know why mine should be prodding me so! I don't want to invite Ruth Mannering home with me for the holidays, but I feel exactly as if I should not have a minute's peace of mind all the time if I didn't. Mother would think it all right, of course. She would not mind if Ruth dressed in calico and never said anything but yes and no. But how the boys would laugh!

Maude was moving briskly about the room, putting it into the beautiful order that Mother insisted on. It was Nan's week to care for their room, but Nan had sprained her ankle three days ago and could do nothing but lie on the sofa ever since. And very tired of it, too, was wide-awake, active Nan.  \"And the picnic this afternoon, too!\" she sighed. \"I've looked forward to it all summer. And it's a perfect day--and I've got to stay here and nurse this foot.\"  Nan looked vindictively at the bandaged member, while Maude leaned out of the window to pull a pink climbing rose. As she did so she nodded to someone in the village street below.  \"Who is passing?\" asked Nan.  \"Florrie Hamilton.\"  \"Is she going to the picnic?\" asked Nan indifferently.  \"No. She wasn't asked. Of course, I don't suppose she expected to be. She knows she isn't in our set. She must feel horribly out of place at school. A lot of the girls say it is ridiculous of her father to send her to Miss Braxton's private school--a factory overseer's daughter.\"  \"She ought to have been asked to the picnic all the same,\" said Nan shortly. \"She is in our class if she isn't in our set. Of course I don't suppose she would have enjoyed herself--or even gone at all, for that matter. She certainly doesn't push herself in among us. One would think she hadn't a tongue in her head.\"  \"She is the best student in the class,\" admitted Maude, arranging her roses in a vase and putting them on the table at Nan's elbow. \"But Patty Morrison and Wilhelmina Patterson had the most to say about the invitations, and they wouldn't have her. There, Nannie dear, aren't those lovely? I'll leave them here to be company for you.\"  \"I'm going to have more company than that,\" said Nan, thumping her pillow energetically. \"I'm not going to mope here alone all the afternoon, with you off having a jolly time at the picnic. Write a little note for me to Florrie Hastings, will you? I'll do as much for you when you sprain your foot.\"  \"What shall I put in it?\" said Maude, rummaging out her portfolio obligingly.  \"Oh, just ask her if she will come down and cheer a poor invalid up this afternoon. She'll come, I know. And she is such good company. Get Dickie to run right out and mail it.\"  \"I do wonder if Florrie Hamilton will feel hurt over not being asked to the picnic,\" speculated Maude absently as she slipped her note into an envelope and addressed it.  Florrie Hamilton herself could best have answered that question as she walked along the street in the fresh morning sunshine. She did feel hurt--much more keenly than she would acknowledge even to herself. It was not that she cared about the picnic itself: as Nan Wallace had said, she would not have been likely to enjoy herself if she had gone among a crowd of girls many of whom looked down on her and ignored her. But to be left out when every other girl in the school was invited! Florrie's lip quivered as she thought of it.  \"I'll get Father to let me to go to the public school after vacation,\" she murmured. \"I hate going to Miss Braxton's.\"  Florrie was a newcomer in Winboro. Her father had recently come to take a position in the largest factory of the small town. For this reason Florrie was slighted at school by some of the ruder girls and severely left alone by most of the others. Some, it is true, tried at the start to be friends, but Florrie, too keenly sensitive to the atmosphere around her to respond, was believed to be decidedly dull and mopy. She retreated further and further into herself and was almost as solitary at Miss Braxton's as if she had been on a desert island.  \"They don't like me because I am plainly dressed and because my father is not a wealthy man,\" thought Florrie bitterly. And there was enough truth in this in regard to many of Miss Braxton's girls to make a very uncomfortable state of affairs.  \"Here's a letter for you, Flo,\" said her brother Jack at noon. \"Got it at the office on my way home. Who is your swell correspondent?\"  Florrie opened the dainty, perfumed note and read it with a face that, puzzled at first, suddenly grew radiant.  \"Listen, Jack,\" she said excitedly.      \"Dear Florrie:      \"Nan is confined to house, room, and sofa with a sprained     foot. As she will be all alone this afternoon, won't you come     down and spend it with her? She very much wants you to     come--she is so lonesome and thinks you will be just the one     to cheer her up.                                   \"Yours cordially,                                     \"Maude Wallace.\"  \"Are you going?\" asked Jack.  \"Yes--I don't know--I'll think about it,\" said Florrie absently. Then she hurried upstairs to her room.  \"Shall I go?\" she thought. \"Yes, I will. I dare say Nan has asked me just out of pity because I was not invited to the picnic. But even so it was sweet of her. I've always thought I would like those Wallace girls if I could get really acquainted with them. They've always been nice to me, too--I don't know why I am always so tongue-tied and stupid with them. But I'll go anyway.\"  That afternoon Mrs. Wallace came into Nan's room.  \"Nan, dear, Florrie Hamilton is downstairs asking for you.\"  \"Florrie--Hamilton?\"  \"Yes. She said something about a note you sent her this morning. Shall I ask her to come up?\"  \"Yes, of course,\" said Nan lamely. When her mother had gone out she fell back on her pillows and thought rapidly.  \"Florrie Hamilton! Maude must have addressed that note to her by mistake. But she mustn't know it was a mistake--mustn't suspect it. Oh, dear! What shall I ever find to talk to her about? She is so quiet and shy.\"  Further reflections were cut short by Florrie's entrance. Nan held out her hand with a chummy smile.  \"It's good of you to give your afternoon up to visiting a cranky invalid,\" she said heartily. \"You don't know how lonesome I've been since Maude went away. Take off your hat and pick out the nicest chair you can find, and let's be comfy.\"  Somehow, Nan's frank greeting did away with Florrie's embarrassment and made her feel at home. She sat down in Maude's rocker, then, glancing over to a vase filled with roses, her eyes kindled with pleasure. Seeing this, Nan said, \"Aren't they lovely? We Wallaces are very fond of our climbing roses. Our great-grandmother brought the roots out from England with her sixty years ago, and they grow nowhere else in this country.\"  \"I know,\" said Florrie, with a smile. \"I recognized them as soon as I came into the room. They are the same kind of roses as those which grow about Grandmother Hamilton's house in England. I used to love them so.\"  \"In England! Were you ever in England?\"  \"Oh, yes,\" laughed Florrie. \"And I've been in pretty nearly every other country upon earth--every one that a ship could get to, at least.\"  \"Why, Florrie Hamilton! Are you in earnest?\"  \"Indeed, yes. Perhaps you don't know that our 'now-mother,' as Jack says sometimes, is Father's second wife. My own mother died when I was a baby, and my aunt, who had no children of her own, took me to bring up. Her husband was a sea-captain, and she always went on his sea-voyages with him. So I went too. I almost grew up on shipboard. We had delightful times. I never went to school. Auntie had been a teacher before her marriage, and she taught me. Two years ago, when I was fourteen, Father married again, and then he wanted me to go home to him and Jack and our new mother. So I did, although at first I was very sorry to leave Auntie and the dear old ship and all our lovely wanderings.\"  \"Oh, tell me all about them,\" demanded Nan. \"Why, Florrie "]]]
