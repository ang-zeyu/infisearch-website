There are trees enough in the orchard for every member of our family to rub against--all at the same time.\"  Somehow, when Grunty talked in that fashion every one of Mrs. Pig's children began to crowd against the sides of the pen. And even Mrs. Pig herself felt an annoying tickling along her back. She did wish that Grunty wouldn't mention such matters.  But nothing Mrs. Pig could say seemed to do any good. He was always prattling, anyhow. She could no more stop his flow of grunts and squeals than she could have kept the water in the brook from babbling down the mountainside to Swift River.  And even more annoying to Mrs. Pig was the way her son Grunty tried to rub his back against _her_. She said \"Don't!\" to him so often that she became heartily sick of the word.  What bothered Mrs. Pig most of all was Grunty's behavior whenever Farmer Green came to the pen. It was mortifying to her to have her son actually try to _scratch his back_ against her in the presence of a visitor.  \"I do hope,\" said Mrs. Pig to Farmer Green, \"I do hope you don't think that I haven't tried to teach this child better manners.\" And then, when all the rest of her family began to squirm and fidget against the sides of the pen she added with a sigh, \"Look at them! Anyone would suppose they had had no bringing up at all!\"  Farmer Green smiled as he leaned over the pen and watched the antics of Grunty Pig and his brothers and sisters.  \"There's something that I can do for your family to make them happier,\" he told Mrs. Pig. \"To-morrow--if I can spare the time--I'll make a change here. A lady who's raising such a fine family as yours deserves the best there is. She ought to have a home with every modern improvement.\"  \"There!\" Mrs. Pig exclaimed to her children as soon as Farmer Green left them. \"Did you hear what he said? Farmer Green is a kind man. I shouldn't have blamed him if he had put us into the poorest pen on the place, after seeing your unmannerly actions. You'll have to behave better--especially after we have our new improvements.\"  Well, the next day Farmer Green brought a stout post and set it firmly in the center of Mrs. Pig's pen.  \"That's for you and your family to rub against,\" he informed Mrs. Pig.  Really, he needn't have explained what the improvement was for. No sooner had he climbed out of the pen than Mrs. Pig and her children began to put the rubbing post to good use. Grunty was the first of all to try it. And to his mother's delight, he stopped grumbling at once. Nor did he ever again disgrace her by scratching his back against her. Instead, he always walked up to the rubbing post like a little gentleman. At least, that was what Mrs. Pig said.  [Illustration: The Muley Cow Advises Grunty Pig to Go Home.  (_Page 34_)]     VIII  FEARFUL NEWS   There came a day at last when Farmer Green gave Mrs. Pig and her family a great treat. He let them out of their pen and turned them loose in a little yard out of doors. Such gruntings and squealings hadn't been heard on the farm for a long time. It was just like a picnic. And everybody had the finest of times. Still, Grunty Pig wasn't content to stay in the yard with the rest of the family. It wasn't long before he found a hole in the fence big enough to wriggle through. And off he went. And he was actually glad, for once, that he was the littlest of the family. There wasn't another of Mrs. Pig's children that could squeeze through the opening.  Grunty Pig trotted the whole length of the lane. When he reached the pasture he found himself face to face with the Muley Cow, who acted much surprised to see him there.  \"You'd better go back home at once,\" she advised him. \"There are bears on Blue Mountain. Sometimes they come down this way. Only last week I had an adventure with one in the back pasture.\" She did not tell Grunty that she had run away from Cuffy Bear, down the hillside. \"A bear,\" said the Muley Cow, \"would be delighted to meet a tender little pig like you.\"  Grunty Pig did not even thank the Muley Cow for warning him.  \"I'd like to meet a bear,\" he declared stoutly. \"I hope I'll meet one to-day.\"  Leaving the Muley Cow, he zigzagged up the hill through the pasture, stopping now and then to dig up many a juicy root.  Although Mrs. Pig missed her runaway son after a time, she was not greatly disturbed.  \"He can't be far off,\" she thought. \"He'll come back before dark.\" And when Grunty did at last come crawling into the little yard Mrs. Pig was merely vexed with him for having gone off without her consent. She was just about to give him a well deserved scolding. But before she could speak to him, Grunty greeted her with a loud squeal.  \"I saw a bear in the pasture!\" he cried.  Mrs. Pig promptly forgot her displeasure. Although her son was certainly unharmed, she couldn't help being startled. It gave her what she called \"a turn\" to learn that Grunty had met a bear.  \"A bear!\" Mrs. Pig gasped. \"A bear is a terribly dangerous creature. It's a wonder that you ever got home.... What did you do when you saw him?\" Mrs. Pig demanded.  \"I walked away,\" said Grunty.  \"He couldn't have noticed you,\" Mrs. Pig declared. \"If you had squealed it would have been the end of you.\"  Grunty Pig felt that he was the most important member of the family. Not one of his brothers or sisters had ever seen a bear. At least they had never claimed to have enjoyed so fearsome a sight.  \"It was nothing,\" he boasted. \"I'd as soon meet a bear as the Muley Cow.\"  His mother, however, was of another mind. She kept looking about in an uneasy fashion.  \"I wish Farmer Green would come and put us into our pen,\" she murmured. \"It will soon be dark. And I shouldn't like to spend the night out here--not with a bear in the neighborhood.\"     IX  A GREAT ADVENTURE   The next outing that Farmer Green gave Mrs. Pig's family in the little yard proved to be anything but a picnic--for Mrs. Pig. That poor lady had a dreadful time. Grunty ran away again. And he hadn't been gone long before his mother heard a loud squealing in the nearest field. The sound rapidly grew louder. And as she stood still and listened, Mrs. Pig knew that it was Grunty's squeal and that he was drawing nearer every moment.  \"Dear me!\" she cried. \"He must be in trouble.\"  Soon Grunty tumbled through the fence. And scrambling to his feet he ran to his mother, crying at the top of his voice, \"A bear chased me!\"  \"Oh! Oh!\" shrieked Mrs. Pig. \"It's a mercy he didn't catch you. Oh! Oh! It's lucky you're no fatter, else you couldn't have run so fast.\" Being more than fat, herself, and greatly excited, Mrs. Pig had to stop talking for a time, because she gurgled and wheezed and panted in a most alarming fashion.  At last, when she had somewhat recovered from her flurry, she called to Grunty. And looking at him severely Mrs. Pig said to him, \"Let this be a lesson to you. Never, never stray away from the farmyard again!\"  \"Yes, Mother!\" was Grunty's glib reply. Then he sidled away. Somehow he felt uneasy under his mother's gaze.  \"Perhaps it was a good thing, after all, that the bear chased him,\" Mrs. Pig muttered. \"Maybe this fright will keep him at home.\"  She soon discovered that it would take more than a mere fright--more than a command--to stop Grunty from running away. For it wasn't long before she missed him again.  If Mrs. Pig hadn't been so upset she might have been vexed--and with good reason.  \"Oh! that dear little Grunty!\" she wailed. \"The bear may have caught him already, in the cabbage patch.\"  Then piercing squeals fell once more on Mrs. Pig's ears.  \"Dear! Dear!\" she cried. \"I ought to have watched him. I ought to have kept an eye on Grunty. After all, he's little more than a baby.\"  Again the squeals grew louder. Again Grunty Pig burst through the hole in the fence and romped up to his mother.  \"He chased me another time!\" he grunted. \"The bear chased me almost as far as the fence.\"  \"Sakes alive!\" his mother shrieked. \"Somebody ought to tell Farmer Green! This farm is not a safe place to live, with a bear prowling about it.\"  \"Do you want me to go and tell Mr. Green?\" Grunty inquired.  \"_You?_\" his mother exclaimed. \"No, indeed! You stay right here with me! Don't you dare stir out of this yard!\" And to Grunty's astonishment, Mrs. Pig bowled him right over, to show him that she meant what she said.  He jumped to his feet in a jiffy. And he was all ready to slink away into a corner of the yard; but his mother bade him wait.  \"This bear--\" she said--\"what did he look like?\"     X  A QUEER BEAR   Grunty Pig's little eyes fell away from his mother's when she asked him what the bear looked like--the bear that had chased him.  \"Er--he was whitish, with brown spots, like Johnnie Green's dog,\" said Grunty; \"and--er--he had a long tail like the old horse Ebenezer's; and he had six legs.\"  Mrs. Pig suddenly made a most peculiar sound. It couldn't be called a squeal, nor a grunt, nor a gurgle, nor a gasp. It was a little like all four. And springing clumsily upon her son, Mrs. Pig upset him before he could dodge her.  Grunty Pig began to whimper. \"What have I done?\" he whined.  \"You've deceived me!\" his mother cried. \"You haven't seen a bear. You've never seen a bear in all your life.\"  \"Ouch,\" Grunty howled, as his mother sent him sprawling once more. \"I didn't mean any harm. I was only having fun with you.\"  \"Well,\" said his mother. \"Turn about is fair play. I'll have a little fun with _you_, now.\"  Mrs. Pig gave her wayward son such a punishing that he remembered it all the rest of that day. At least, he stayed at home. And Mrs. Pig dared hope that at last she had cured him of two bad habits--running away and telling fibs.  The next day, however, the fields called again to Grunty Pig. They called so plainly that he couldn't resist answering.  \"I'll slip "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24731"],["title","The Tale of Grunty Pig (#3)"],["body","for just a little while,\" he said to himself. \"If I'm not gone long no one will miss me.\" So when his mother was taking a nap he stole through the hole in the fence. \"I'll be back before she wakes up,\" he chuckled.  In the garden, up the lane, through the pasture he made his way. And he enjoyed his holiday to the full--until he remembered suddenly that he had been gone a long time--a much longer time than he had planned to spend away from the farmyard.  \"Oh, dear!\" he whined. \"Mother must be awake now; and she'll punish me if I go back.\" The more he thought about returning, the less he liked the idea.  \"I won't go home at all!\" he cried at last. \"I'll stay in the pasture the rest of my life. There's plenty to eat here; and plenty of fun, too.\"  It was afternoon when Grunty Pig made up his mind that he would never go home. When the Muley Cow warned him once more to beware of the bears he actually jeered at her.  \"There are no bears in Pleasant Valley,\" he scoffed. \"And you needn't trouble yourself to mention them again to me. I'm going to live in this pasture and there's no use of your trying to frighten me away.\"  The Muley Cow said nothing more to him. She merely looked at him and smiled wisely.  \"He'll sing a different song,\" she thought, \"when it begins to grow dark.\"     XI  LOCKED OUT   The Muley Cow was right. She had said to herself, with a smile, that Grunty Pig, the runaway, would be glad enough to go home when night came. He had decided to stay right there in the pasture for the rest of his life, where there was plenty to eat and plenty to do. He felt sure that he would have a much pleasanter time there than at home. For one thing, he knew well enough that there was a punishing waiting for him at the piggery--if he ever went back to get it.  Not until Johnnie Green and old dog Spot came to the pasture to drive the cows down the lane did Grunty Pig begin to feel the least twinge of homesickness. And even then he tried to forget it. He hid in a clump of brakes near the fence while Johnnie Green and Spot were in the pasture, for he didn't want them to spy him and take him home with them.  There was a delicious, damp, woodsy smell in the cool shade of his hiding place.  \"How much nicer this is than our stuffy pen!\" Grunty exclaimed under his breath.  Now and then he peeped out to watch the procession of cows moving slowly towards the barn to be milked. And when the last one had entered the lane, hurrying to catch up with the rest--and to avoid Spot's nips at her heels--Grunty crept out into the open.  Then, strange to say, he hurried towards the lane himself. All at once the pasture seemed a great, lonesome place. Who knew when a bear might rise out of a clump of bushes near him?  He was careful not to follow too closely after the herd as they meandered down the lane. At the same time, he was careful not to fall too far behind. And he took many a quick backward glance, to make sure no bear was creeping up on him.  Not far from the barn Grunty left the lane and hurried toward the little yard outside the piggery, where he had run away from his mother and his brothers and his sisters.  When he reached the fence through which he had crept while Mrs. Pig was enjoying a nap, he met with a great surprise. The hole in the fence was no more! Somebody had mended it. And there he was, outside the yard!  Grunty Pig squealed for his mother. But no one answered. The fence was too high for him to look over it. It was too tight for him to peep through.  \"I want to get in!\" Grunty cried. \"Why doesn't somebody answer?\"  The silence from the other side of the fence was dreadful. Grunty Pig would have been _glad_ to have his mother scold him then, just for the comfort of hearing her voice.  \"Oh! Oh!\" he wailed. \"What shall I do? Whatever shall I do? Farmer Green must have put the family back in the pen. And I'll have to spend the night out here alone!\"     XII  WOOF!   Night found Grunty Pig huddled close to the outside of the piggery. Many times he had walked around the low building, snuffing at the doors and trying in vain to find some opening through which he might crawl. To his dismay, all was snug and tight. There wasn't a hole big enough even for Miss Kitty Cat to creep through.  Though Grunty had called a good many times, nobody had answered him. Inside the piggery, in their pen, Mrs. Pig and her other children were sound asleep. Now and then Grunty could hear a throaty snore, which he knew to be his mother's.  \"How can she sleep, when I'm missing?\" he cried.  Now, Mrs. Pig had been much upset by Grunty's absence. And when Farmer Green came to put her family into the piggery for the night she had tried to explain to him that Grunty had run away. Unfortunately, it happened that Farmer Green was in a great hurry. He didn't stop to find out what was troubling Mrs. Pig, but hustled her and her children inside and closed all the doors.  Try as she would, Mrs. Pig hadn't been able to stay awake. Her eyes would close, in spite of all she could do. Though she slept, she dreamed about the truant Grunty. Now and then she cried aloud in the darkness, when some terrible creature seemed to be chasing him. But Mrs. Pig never quite waked up.  Once Grunty Pig thought he heard his mother speak his name. And he called out in as brave a voice as he could muster, \"Here I am, just outside the piggery! Won't somebody please let me in?\"  He called in vain. At last he fell asleep, for he was about as tired as any little pig could be.  In the middle of the night Grunty Pig awoke with a start. Somebody said \"Woof!\" And somebody came sniffing and snuffing around the corner of the piggery. Dimly Grunty could see a dark, burly form. And he was so frightened that he bawled right out, \"It's a bear! It's a bear! It's a bear!\"  Almost at the same instant old dog Spot ran out of his kennel, barking furiously. And like magic the prowler--whoever he was--vanished into the night.  \"Keep still!\" Grunty's mother called to him; for the noise had half roused her. \"Don't you mention the word _bear_ again, or I'll attend to you in the morning.\"  Drowsy as she was, Mrs. Pig actually thought Grunty was right there in the pen with the rest of her children. And in no time at all she was snoring again.  Grunty Pig didn't dare open his mouth nor close his eyes the rest of the night. And when morning came, Farmer Green found him huddled against the door of the piggery.  It was a joyful meeting--for Grunty Pig.     XIII  HOME AT LAST   \"What's this?\" Farmer Green exclaimed, when he went to unlock the piggery in the morning and found Grunty Pig lying up against the door. \"Did you get locked out last night? Was it you that old Spot was barking at?\"  Grunty Pig didn't dare answer. When Farmer Green dropped him into the pen he said nothing to anybody--not even \"Good morning!\"  A little later Farmer Green found something more outside the piggery. In the loose dirt he discovered--bear tracks!  \"Aha!\" he cried to his son Johnnie. \"Look here! We had a visitor last night. It was no wonder old Spot woke us all up. A bear called on us! And he'd certainly have had that pig if Spot hadn't scared him off.\"  Naturally the news soon spread all over the farmyard. And when Mrs. Pig heard it she began to tremble.  \"To think,\" she quavered, \"that my littlest child spent the night out of doors, with a bear prowling about the neighborhood! And I slept through it all!  \"Tell me all about it, Grunty!\" she commanded that young gentleman.  It is not surprising that Grunty Pig was puzzled. Hadn't his mother told him, during the night, not to mention the word _bear_ again? And now she was urging him to talk about that very animal.  \"Squeak up!\" said his mother sharply--which was the same as saying, \"Speak up!\"  So he told his story. And when he had finished Mrs. Pig fairly covered him with caresses.  \"It seems to me--\" she sniffed--for she was quite upset--\"it seems to me that I remember your saying something about a bear last night. But I wasn't wide awake at the time. And I thought you were fibbing again.  \"Perhaps,\" she added, \"this will teach you a few things that you needed to learn.... _Always mind your mother!_\" said Mrs. Pig. \"And _always tell the truth_!\"  Her children all repeated the words after her. And Grunty Pig's voice could have been heard plainly above all the rest.  His mother looked at him fondly. She had always claimed that she had no favorite among her children. But now she couldn't help thinking what a promising youngster Grunty was, even if he was the runt of the family.  \"That's a good Grunty,\" said Mrs. Pig. \"You won't forget this lesson, will you?\"  \"No, Mother!\" Grunty answered.  Now, that very afternoon Mrs. Pig took it into her head to have her children say the morning's lesson again. So she called her youngsters together. And she asked Grunty the first of all to recite what she had taught him.  \"I think it was something about a bear,\" he stammered, \"but I can't remember exactly.\"  \"Dear me!\" said poor Mrs. Pig. \"I don't know what I'll do with this lad.\"  Then she asked the other children, one by one, what they had learned that very morning.  There wasn't one of them that hadn't forgotten everything.  \"Dear me!\" said unhappy Mrs. Pig. \"I don't know what I'll do with all of them. But I'll treat them all alike. I have no favorite. There isn't one of them that's stupider than another.\"  When Grunty Pig heard that he felt quite proud. It was something, anyhow, to be as stupid as the rest, even if he was smaller.     XIV  AN ODD THOUGHT   \"Umph! Umph!\"  Farmer Green had fenced off a piece of the old orchard. And into this new yard he turned Mrs. Pig's children.  \"Umph! Umph!\"  They had a fine time there, rooting down under the sod, rubbing their backs against the trunks of the old apple trees, and sprawling in the shade when they were sleepy.  \"Umph! Umph!\"  Sometimes an apple dropped from a tree. And then there was a mad scramble.  \"Umph! Umph!\"  \"Dear me!\" said"]]]
