Although this little work, and its fellow, “ROLLO AT PLAY,” are intended principally as a means of entertainment for their little readers, it is hoped by the writer that they may aid in accomplishing some of the following useful purposes:--  1. In cultivating _the thinking powers_; as frequent occasions occur, in which the incidents of the narrative, and the conversations arising from them, are intended to awaken and engage the reasoning and reflective faculties of the little readers.  2. In promoting the progress of children _in reading_ and in knowledge of language; for the diction of the stories is intended to be often in advance of the natural language of the reader, and yet so used as to be explained by the connection.  3. In cultivating the _amiable and gentle qualities of the heart_. The scenes are laid in quiet and virtuous life, and the character and conduct described are generally--with the exception of some of the ordinary exhibitions of childish folly--character and conduct to be imitated; for it is generally better, in dealing with children, to allure them to what is right by agreeable pictures of it, than to attempt to drive them to it by repulsive delineations of what is wrong.

When Rollo was between five and six years old, he was one day at work in his little garden, planting some beans. His father had given him a little square bed in a corner of the garden, which he had planted with corn two days before. He watched his corn impatiently for two days, and, as it did not come up, he thought he would plant it again with beans. He ought to have waited longer.  He was sitting on a little cricket, digging holes in the ground, when he heard a sudden noise. He started up, and saw a strange, monstrous head looking at him over the garden wall. He jumped up, and ran as fast as he could towards the house.  It happened that Jonas, the boy, was at that time at work in the yard, cutting wood, and he called out, “What is the matter, Rollo?”  Rollo had just looked round, and seeing that the head remained still where it was, he was a little ashamed of his fears; so at first he did not answer, but walked along towards Jonas.  “That’s the colt,” said Jonas; “should not you like to go and see him?”  Rollo looked round again, and true enough, it was a small horse’s head that was over the wall. It looked smaller now than it did when he first saw it.  Now there was behind the garden a green field, with scattered trees upon it, and a thick wood at the farther side. Jonas took Rollo by the hand, and led him back into the garden, towards the colt. The colt took his head back over the fence as they approached, and walked away. He was now afraid of Rollo. Jonas and Rollo climbed up upon a stile which was built there against the fence, and saw the colt trotting away slowly down towards the wood, looking back at Rollo and Jonas, by bending his head every minute, first on one side, and then on the other.  “There comes father,” said Rollo.  Jonas looked and saw Rollo’s father coming out of the wood, leading a horse. The colt and the horse had been feeding together in the field, and Rollo’s father had caught the horse, for he wanted to take a ride. Rollo’s father had a little basket in his hand, and when he saw the colt coming towards him, he held it up and called him, “_Elky, Elky, Elky, Elky_,” for the colt’s name was Elkin, though they often called him Elky. Elkin walked slowly up to the basket, and put his nose in it. He found that there were some oats in it; and Rollo’s father poured them out on the grass, and then stood by, patting Elky’s head and neck while he ate them. Rollo thought his head looked beautifully; he wondered how he could have been afraid of it.  Rollo’s father led the horse across the field, through a gate, into a green lane which led along the side of the garden towards the house; and Rollo said he would run round into the lane and meet him. So he jumped off of the stile, and ran up the garden, and Jonas followed him, and went back to his work.  Rollo ran round to meet his father, who was coming up the green lane, leading the horse with a rope round his neck.  “Father,” said Rollo, “could you put me on?”  His father smiled, and lifted Rollo up carefully, and placed him on the horse’s back. Then he walked slowly along.  “Father,” said Rollo, “are you going away?”  “Yes,” said he, “I am going to ride away in the wagon.”  “Why did not you catch Elky, and let him draw you?”  “Elky? O, Elky is not old enough to work.”  “Not old enough to work!” said Rollo, “Why, he is pretty big. He is almost as big as the horse. I should think he could draw you alone in the wagon.”  “Perhaps he is strong enough for that; but Elky has never learned to work yet.”  “Never learned!” said Rollo, in great surprise. “Do horses have to _learn_ to work? Why, they have nothing to do but to pull.”  “Why, suppose,” said his father, “that he should dart off at once as soon as he is harnessed, and pull with all his strength, and furiously.”  “O, he must not do so: he must pull gently and slowly.”  “Well, suppose he pulls gently a minute, and then stops and looks round, and then I tell him to go on, and he pulls a minute again, and then stops and looks round.”  “O no,” said Rollo, laughing, “he must not do so; he must keep pulling steadily all the time.”  “Yes, so you see he has something more to do than merely to pull; he must pull right, and he must be taught to do this. Besides, he must learn to obey all my various commands. Why, a horse needs to be taught to work as much as a boy.”  “Why, father, I can work; and I have never been taught.”  “O no,” said his father, smiling, “you cannot work.”  “I can plant beans,” said Rollo.  Just then, Rollo, who was all this time riding on the horse, looked down from his high seat into a little bush by the side of the road, and saw there a little bunch that looked like a birdsnest; and he said, “O, father, please to take me down; I want to look at that birdsnest.”  His father knew that he would not hurt the birdsnest; so he took him off of the horse, and put him on the ground. Then he walked on with the horse, and Rollo turned back to see the nest. He climbed up upon a log that lay by the side of the bush, and then gently opened the branches and looked in. Four little, unfledged birds lifted up their heads, and opened their mouths wide. They heard the noise which Rollo made, and thought it was their mother come to feed them.  “Ah, you little dickeys,” said Rollo; “hungry, are you? _I_ have not got any thing for you to eat.”  Rollo looked at them a little while, and then slowly got down and walked along up the lane, saying to himself, “_They_ are not big enough to work, at any rate, but _I_ am, I know, and I do not believe but that _Elky_ is.”     Preparations.   When Rollo got back into the yard, he found his father just getting into the wagon to go away. Jonas stood by the horse, having just finished harnessing him.  “Father,” said Rollo, “I can work. You thought I could not work, but I can. I am going to work to-day while you are gone.”  “Are you?” said his father. “Very well; I should be glad to have you.”  “What should you like to have me do?” asked Rollo.  “O, you may pick up chips, or pile that short wood in the shed. But stand back from the wheel, for I am going to start now.”  So Rollo stood back, and his father drew up the reins which Jonas had just put into his hands, and guided the horse slowly and carefully out of the yard. Rollo ran along behind the wagon as far as the gate, to see his father go off, and stood there a few minutes, watching him as he rode along, until he disappeared at a turn in the road. He then came back to the yard, and sat down on a log by the side of Jonas, who was busily at work mending the wheelbarrow.  Rollo sat singing to himself for some time,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25274"],["title","Rollo at Work (#1)"],["body","then he said,  “Jonas, father thinks I am not big enough to work; don’t you think I am?”  “I don’t know,” said Jonas, hesitating. “You do not seem to be very industrious just now.”  “O, I am resting now,” said Rollo; “I am going to work pretty soon.”  “What are you resting from?” said Jonas.  “O, I am resting because I am tired.”  “What are you tired of?” said Jonas. “What have you been doing?”  Rollo had no answer at hand, for he had not been doing any thing at all. The truth was, it was pleasanter for him to sit on the log and sing, and see Jonas mend the wheelbarrow, than to go to work himself; and he mistook that feeling for being tired. Boys often do so when they are set to work.  Rollo, finding that he had no excuse for sitting there any longer, presently got up, and sauntered along towards the house, saying that he was going to work, picking up chips.  Now there was, in a certain corner of the yard, a considerable space covered with chips, which were the ones that Rollo had to pick up. He knew that his father wished to have them put into a kind of a bin in the shed, called the _chip-bin_. So he went into the house for a basket.  He found his mother busy; and she said she could not go and get a basket for him; but she told him the chip-basket was probably in its place in the shed, and he might go and get that.  “But,” said Rollo, “that is too large. I cannot lift that great basket full of chips.”  “You need not fill it full then,” said his mother. “Put in just as many as you can easily carry.”  Rollo still objected, saying that he wanted her very much to go and get a smaller one. He could not work without a smaller one.  “Very well,” said she, “I would rather that you should not work then. The interruption to me to get up now, and go to look for a smaller basket, will be greater than all the good you will do in picking up chips.”  Rollo then told her that his father wanted him to work, and he related to her all the conversation they had had. She then thought that she had better do all in her power to give Rollo a fair experiment; so she left her work, went down, got him a basket which he said was just big enough, and left him at the door, going out to his work in the yard.     A Bad Beginning.   Rollo sat down on the chips, and began picking them up, all around him, and throwing them into his basket. He soon filled it up, and then lugged it in, emptied it into the chip-bin, and then returned, and began to fill it again.  He had not got his basket more than half full the second time, before he came upon some very large chips, which were so square and flat, that he thought they would be good to build houses with. He thought he would just try them a little, and began to stand them up in such a manner as to make the four walls of a house. He found, however, an unexpected difficulty; for although the chips were large and square, yet the edges were so sharp that they would not stand up very well.  Some time was spent in trying experiments with them in various ways; but he could not succeed very well; so he began again industriously to put them into his basket.  When he got the basket nearly full, the second time, he thought he was tired, and that it would be a good plan to take a little time for rest; and he would go and see Jonas a little while.  Now his various interruptions and delays, his conversation with his mother, the delay in getting the basket, and his house-building, had occupied considerable time; so that, when he went back to Jonas, it was full half an hour from the time when he left him; and he found that Jonas had finished mending the wheelbarrow, and had put it in its place, and was just going away himself into the field.  “Well, Rollo,” said he, “how do you get along with your work?”  “O, very well,” said Rollo; “I have been picking up chips all the time since I went away from you.”  Rollo did not mean to tell a falsehood. But he was not aware how much of his time he had idled away.  “And how many have you got in?” said Jonas.  “Guess,” said Rollo.  “Six baskets full,” said Jonas.  “No,” said Rollo.  “Eight.”  “No; not so many.”  “How many, then?” said Jonas, who began to be tired of guessing.  “Two; that is, I have got one in, and the other is almost full.”  “Only two?” said Jonas. “Then you cannot have worked very steadily. Come here and I will show you how to work.”     What Rollo Might Do.   So Jonas walked along to the chips, and asked Rollo to fill up that basket, and carry it, and then come back, and he would tell him.  So Rollo filled up the basket, carried it to the bin, and came back very soon. Jonas told him then to fill it up again as full as it was before.  “There,” said Jonas, when it was done, “now it is as full as the other was, and I should think you have been less than two minutes in doing it. We will call it two minutes. Two minutes for each basket full would make thirty baskets full in an hour. Now, I don’t think there are more than thirty baskets full in all; so that, if you work steadily, but without hurrying any, you would get them all in in an hour.”  “In an hour?” said Rollo. “Could I get them all in in an hour?”  “Yes,” said Jonas, “I have no doubt you can. But you must not hurry and get tired out. Work moderately, but _steadily_;--that is the way.”  So Jonas went to the field, leaving Rollo to go on with his thirty baskets. Rollo thought it would be a fine thing to get the chips all in before his father should come home, and he went to work very busily filling his basket the third time.  “I can do it quicker,” said he to himself. “I can fill the basket a great deal faster than that. I will get it all done in half an hour.”  So he began to throw in the chips as fast as possible, taking up very large ones too, and tossing them in in any way. Now it happened that he did fill it this time very quick; for the basket being small, and the chips that he now selected very large, they did not pack well, but lay up in every direction, so as apparently to fill up the basket quite full, when, in fact, there were great empty spaces in it; and when he took it up to carry it, it felt very light, because it was in great part empty.  He ran along with it, forgetting Jonas’s advice not to hurry, and thinking that the reason why it seemed so light was because he was so strong. When he got to the coal-bin, the chips would not come out easily. They were so large that they had got wedged between the sides of the basket, and he had hard work to get them out.  This fretted him, and cooled his ardor somewhat; he walked back rather slowly, and began again to fill his basket.     A New Plan.   Before he had got many chips in it, however, he happened to think that the wheelbarrow would be a better thing to get them in with. They would not stick in that as they did in the basket. “Men always use a wheelbarrow,” he said to himself, “and why should not I?”  So he turned the chips out of his basket, thus losing so much labor, and went after the wheelbarrow. He spent some time in looking to see how Jonas had mended it, and then he attempted to wheel it along to the chips. He found it quite heavy; but he contrived to get it along, and after losing considerable time in various delays, he at last had it fairly on the ground, and began to fill it.  He found that the chips would go into the wheelbarrow beautifully, and he was quite pleased with his own ingenuity in thinking of it. He thought he would take a noble load, and so he filled it almost full, but it took a long time to do it, for the wheelbarrow was so large that he got tired, and stopped several times to rest.  When, at length, it was full, he took hold of the handles, and lifted away upon it. He found it very heavy. He made another desperate effort, and succeeded in raising it from the ground a little; but unluckily, as wheelbarrows are very apt to do when the load is too heavy for the workman, it tipped down to one side, and, though Rollo exerted all his strength to save it, it was in vain.  [Illustration: Too Heavy.]  Over went the wheelbarrow, and about half of the chips were poured out upon the ground again.  “O dear me!” said Rollo; “I wish this wheelbarrow was not so heavy.”  He sat down on the side of the wheelbarrow for a time in despair. He had a great mind to give up work for that day. He thought he had done enough; he was tired. But, then, when he reflected that he had only got in three small baskets of chips, and that his father would see that it was really true, as he had supposed, that Rollo could not work, he felt a little ashamed to stop.  So he tipped the wheelbarrow back, which he could easily do now that the load was half out, and thought he would wheel those along, and take the rest next time.  By great exertions he contrived to stagger along a little way with this load, until presently the wheel settled into a little low place in the path, and he could not move it any farther. This worried and troubled him again. He tried to draw the wheelbarrow back, as he had often seen Jonas do in similar cases, but in vain. It would not move back or forwards. Then he went round to the wheel, and pulled upon that; but it would not do. The wheel held its place immovably.  Rollo sat down on the grass a minute or two, wishing that he had not touched the wheelbarrow. It was unwise for him to have left his basket, his regular and proper mode of carrying the chips, to try experiments with the wheelbarrow, which he was not at all accustomed to. And now the proper course for him to have taken, would have been to leave the wheelbarrow where it was, go and get the basket, take out the chips from the wheelbarrow, and carry them, a basket full at a time, to the bin, then take the wheelbarrow to its place, and go on with his work in the way he began.  But Rollo, like all other boys who have not learned to work, was more inclined to get somebody to help him do what was beyond his own strength, than to go quietly on alone in doing what he himself"]]]
