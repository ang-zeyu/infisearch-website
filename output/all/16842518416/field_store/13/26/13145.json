[Pageheading: TAHITI]   _Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._  WINDSOR CASTLE, _27th August 1844._  MY DEAREST UNCLE,--Many thanks for your kind long letter, which I received yesterday, dated 23rd. I can report very well of ourselves. We are all well. The dear day of yesterday[24] we spent very quietly and happily and full of gratitude to Providence for so many blessings. I can only pray for the continuance of our present happiness.  The impending political cloud, I hope and trust, looks less black and lowering. But I think it very unwise in Guizot not to have at once disavowed D'Aubigny for what you yourself call an \"outrage,\"[25] instead of letting it drag on for _four weeks_ and letting our people get excited. The Tangiers Affair[26] is unfortunate, and I hope that in future poor Joinville will not be exposed to such disagreeable affairs. What _can_ be done will be, to get him justified in the eyes of the public here, but I fear that at first they will not be very charitable. Those letters in the _Times_ are outrageous, and all that abuse very bad taste.[27] There is to be an investigation about the three officers, whose conduct is unworthy of Englishmen. Now, dearest Uncle, believe me always, your most affectionate Niece,  VICTORIA R.      [Footnote 24: The Prince Albert's birthday.

As I have written an account of our journey to Louise, I will _not_ repeat it here.  The good ending of our difficulties with France is an immense blessing, but it is really and truly necessary that you and those at Paris should know that the danger was _imminent_, and that poor Aberdeen stood _almost alone_ in trying to keep matters peaceable. We must try and prevent these difficulties for the future. I must, however, clear _Jarnac_[28] of all blame, for Aberdeen does nothing but praise him....  In Greece affairs look very black, and God knows how it all will end.      [Footnote 28: _Chargé d'Affaires_ in the absence of the French     Ambassador.]     [Pageheading: VISIT OF KING LOUIS PHILIPPE]   _The Queen of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._  LAEKEN, _5th October 1844._  MY DEARLY BELOVED VICTORIA,--... I have not much to say about my father's _lodging habits_ and _likings_.[29] My father is one of the beings _most easy_ to _please_, _satisfy_, and to _accommodate_. His eventful life has used him to everything, and makes any kind of arrangements acceptable to him; there is only _one thing_ which he _cannot easily do_, it is to be _ready very early_. He means notwithstanding to try to come to your breakfast, but you _must insist upon his not doing it_. It would disturb him in all his habits, and be bad for him, as he would certainly eat, a thing he is not used to do in the morning. He generally takes hardly what may be called a _breakfast_, and eats _only twice_ in the day. It would be also _much better_ for him if he only appeared to luncheon and dinner, and if you kindly dispensed him altogether of the breakfast. You must not tell him that I wrote you _this_, but you must manage it with Montpensier, and kindly order for him a bowl of _chicken broth_. It is the only thing he takes generally in the morning, and between his meals. I have also no observation to make, but I have told Montpensier to speak openly to Albert whenever he thought something ought to be done for my father, or might hurt and inconvenience him, and you may consult him when you are in doubt. He is entrusted with all the recommendations of my mother, for my father is naturally _so imprudent_ and _so little accustomed_ to _caution and care_, that he must in some measure be _watched_ to prevent his catching cold or doing what may be injurious to him. About his _rooms_, a hard bed and a large table for his papers are the only things he requires. He generally sleeps on a horse-hair mattress with a plank of wood under it: but _any kind_ of bed will do, if it is not _too soft_. His liking will be to be entirely at _your commands_ and to do _all you like_. You know he can take a great deal of exercise, and _everything_ will _interest_ and _delight_ him, to see, as to do: this is not a compliment, but a _mere fact_. His only wish is, that you should not go out of your way for him, and change your habits on his account. Lord Aberdeen will be, of course, at Windsor, and I suppose you will ask, as you told me, the Royal Family. My father hopes to see also Sir Robert Peel, Lord Stanley, and your other Ministers. You will probably ask most of them during his stay. He wishes very much to see again those he already knows, and to make the acquaintance of those he does not know yet. In writing all this I think I _dream_, I _cannot believe_ yet that in a few days my dear father will have, God willing, the _unspeakable happiness_ to see you again and at _Windsor_, a thing he had _so much wished_ for and which for a _long time_ seemed so _improbable_. You have _no notion_ of the _satisfaction_ it gives him, and _how delighted_ he will be to see you again, and to be once more in England. God grant he may have a good passage, and arrive to you _safely_ and _well_. _Unberufen_, as you will soon, I trust, be able to see, he is, notwithstanding the usual talk of the papers, _perfectly well_.... Yours most devotedly,  LOUISE.      [Footnote 29: The difficulty with France as to Tahiti having     been satisfactorily disposed of, King Louis Philippe was     enabled to visit England, the first French King to come on     a visit to the Sovereign of England. The King was     enthusiastically received in England, visited Claremont (which     he was destined to occupy in exile), was installed as a Knight     of the Garter at Windsor with great magnificence, and visited     Eton College and Woolwich Arsenal.]     [Pageheading: SOLICITUDE OF QUEEN LOUISE]   _The Queen of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._  LAEKEN, _7th October 1844._  MY DEARLY BELOVED VICTORIA,--... I wrote to my mother, to quiet her, all you kindly tell me about my dear father. We are _quite sure_, I assure you, that you and Albert will _take care of him_, and that he is with you _in safe hand_. And what makes my mother _uneasy_ is the fear that, being at liberty without control, he will make _too much_, as she says, _le jeune homme_, ride, go about, and do everything as if he was still twenty years old. If I must tell you _all the truth_, she is afraid also he will _eat too much_. I am sure he will tell it to you himself, as he was so much amused with _this fear_; but to do her pleasure, being well assured by me that you would allow it, and that it was even _customary_, he has given up, of himself, all thought of attending your early breakfast: but I perceive I write as if _he was not already_ under _your_ roof. I will also only say, that though he has sent over his horses in case they should be wanted, my mother begs you to _prevent, if possible, his riding at all_. I wrote to her already that I supposed there would be _no occasion_ for riding, and that your _promenades_ would be either on foot or in carriage. I entrusted Montpensier with all my messages for you, my beloved Victoria and your dear children. He hopes you will permit him, during his stay at Windsor, to make _two_ excursions--one to London, and one to Woolwich--he is very curious to see, as an artillery officer. I mention it as he would be, perhaps, _too shy_ or _too discreet_ to mention it himself. He might very well do those two trips by the railroad and be back for dinner-time, and I am sure you will have no objection to them.... Yours most devotedly,  LOUISE.  I am very glad that Lord Charles Wellesley is one of those who will attend my father. Montpensier and him will have surely capital fun together, and he was, you know, a great favourite with every one at Eu. If by chance Lord Hardwicke was in waiting during my father's stay, you must kindly put my father in mind to thank him for the _famous cheese_, which arrived safely, and was found very good....     [Pageheading: THE KING'S ARRIVAL]   _Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._  WINDSOR CASTLE, _8th October 1844._  DEAREST UNCLE,--You will, I am sure, forgive my writing but a few lines as I am all alone in the agitation of the dear King's arrival, and I will leave my letter open to announce it to you. My _dearest_ master is gone to Portsmouth to receive him. The excitement and curiosity to see the dear King, and the desire to give him a most hearty reception, is _very great indeed_.  Many thanks for your kind letters of the 28th and 4th. I can't think who could have said that Peel, etc., would _not_ have been here; for he, Aberdeen, and the old Duke are to be here the whole time, and all the other Ministers will come _during_ his stay.  I am very glad Joinville is arrived, and avoided his _entrées triomphales_. I hope he will take great care of himself.  You will have heard from dear Louise of our voyage, etc. I cannot reconcile myself to be _here_ again, and pine for my _dear_ Highlands, the hills, the pure air, the quiet, the retirement, the liberty--_all_--more than is right. The children are well. I am sorry to hear that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24780"],["title","The Letters of Queen Victoria : A Selection from her Majesty's correspondence (#7)"],["body","are not quite so yet.  3.30.--The King and Montpensier arrived quite safely at two, and are both looking extremely well. We have just lunched with them. It seems like a dream to me, and a very pleasant one.  Albert sends his affectionate love. Ever your devoted Niece,  VICTORIA R.  Bertie has immediately taken a passion for Montpensier.     _Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._  BROCKET HALL, _9th October 1844._  Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and thanks your Majesty much for the letter of the 7th inst., which he has just received, and with very great satisfaction, as he had begun to think your Majesty's silence rather long. But he perfectly understands the reasons which prevented your Majesty from writing during your stay in the Highlands. Lord Melbourne is very glad to find that your Majesty enjoyed that country so much, and is so enthusiastically fond of it. Lord Melbourne believes that he was at the places which your Majesty mentions. In the year 1802 he stayed some months in Perthshire with the late Lord Kinnaird, and enjoyed it much. It annoys him sometimes to think how altered he is in strength since that time. Lord Melbourne has never yet thanked your Majesty for the pretty etchings of poor Islay and Eos, which your Majesty sent to Lord Melbourne when he was last at Windsor. Lord Melbourne has ordered them both to be framed, and will hang them up in his room here. They will afford Lord Melbourne most agreeable and pleasing souvenirs of the happiest period of his life, for he cannot say otherwise than that he continually misses and regrets the time when he had daily confidential communication with your Majesty. Lord Glenlyon[30] has one merit in Lord Melbourne's eyes, which is that he was a steady and firm supporter to the last of Lord Melbourne's Government. Lord Melbourne hopes and trusts that he feels no animosity against those who opposed him. But he does and always shall entertain a kindly and grateful recollection of those who supported him.  Lord Melbourne begs to be remembered to His Royal Highness.      [Footnote 30: _See_ vol. i. p. 429.]     _The Queen of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._  LAEKEN, _12th October 1844._  MY DEARLY BELOVED VICTORIA,--... I thank you very much for attending to all my recommendations about _my_ father: I only fear that they will lead you to believe that we consider him as a _great child_ and treat him like one: but he is so _precious_ and _dear_ to _us all_ that I am sure you will _understand_ and _excuse_ our being _over anxious_... Yours most devotedly,  LOUISE.     [Pageheading: A SUCCESSFUL VISIT]   _Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._  OSBORNE HOUSE, _17th October 1844._  MY DEAREST UNCLE,--I had intended to have written to you on Monday, but you will since have heard of the great _confusion_ of that day which prevented me from doing so. The dear King's visit went off to perfection, and I much and deeply regret its being passed. He was _delighted_, and was _most_ enthusiastically and affectionately received wherever he showed himself. Our proceedings I wrote to good, dear Louise (whom you should not leave so long alone), who will no doubt have given you the details. What an extraordinary man the King is! What a wonderful memory, and how lively, _how sagacious!_He spoke very openly to us all, and is determined that our affairs should go on well. He wishes Tahiti _au fond de la mer_. He spoke also very openly about poor Hadjy's _brochure_ which seems to have distressed him more than anything. The King praised my dearest Albert most highly, and fully appreciates his great qualities and talents--and what gratifies me _so much_, treats him completely as his equal, calling him \"Mon Frère,\" and saying to me that _my husband_ was the same as me, which it is--and \"Le Prince Albert, c'est pour moi le Roi.\" The King is _very_ sad to go, but he is determined, he says, _to see me every year_. Another _very_ great thing is, that the officers of the two Navies staying at Portsmouth were on the best terms together and paying one another every sort of compliment. As Admiral La Susse (a very gentlemanlike man) and his squadron were sadly disappointed on Monday,[31] we thought it would please them if we went on board the _Gomer_, which we did, on Tuesday morning, and breakfasted there, and I drank the King's health. I am certain that the visit and everything connected with it can but do the _greatest good_.  We stay here till Monday. It is a very comfortable little house, and the grounds and place are delightful, so private--and the view so fine.  I must now conclude, begging you to believe me, ever your devoted Niece,  VICTORIA R.  I forgot to say how much we liked good Montpensier, who got on extremely well.      [Footnote 31: It had been intended that the King should return     to France, as he had come, by way of Portsmouth, crossing in     the frigate _Gomer_, but, in consequence of the wet and stormy     weather, he returned by Dover and Calais.]     [Pageheading: DEPARTURE OF THE KING]   _Queen Victoria to the King of the French._  OSBORNE HOUSE, _le 17 Octobre 1844._  SIRE, ET MON TRÈS CHER FRÈRE,--Votre Majesté m'a écrit deux bien bonnes lettres de Douvres pour lesquelles je vous remercie de tout mon c[oe]ur. Les expressions de bonté et d'amitié que vous me vouez ainsi qu'à mon cher Albert nous touchent sensiblement; je n'ai pas besoin de vous dire encore, combien nous vous sommes attachés et combien nous désirons voir se raffermir de plus en plus cette _entente cordiale_ entre nos deux pays qui existe si heureusement entre nous personnellement. C'était avec un vif regret que nous nous sommes séparés de votre Majesté, et de Montpensier, et ce sera une grande fête que de voir renouveler une visite dont le souvenir nous est si cher.  Albert se met à vos pieds, Sire, bien sensible ainsi que moi-même de l'amitié et la confiance que vous lui avez témoignées.  J'ose prier votre Majesté d'offrir mes plus tendres hommages à la Reine et à Madame votre S[oe]ur et de me rappeler au souvenir de Montpensier. Je suis pour la vie, Sire et mon cher Frère, de votre Majesté la bien affectionnée S[oe]ur et fidèle Amie,  VICTORIA R.     [Pageheading: OPENING OF ROYAL EXCHANGE]   _Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._  WINDSOR CASTLE, _29th October 1844._  MY DEAREST UNCLE,--I had the happiness of receiving your kind letter of the 26th while I was dressing to go to the City for the opening of the Royal Exchange.[32] Nothing ever went off better, and the procession there, as well as all the proceedings _at_ the Royal Exchange, were splendid and royal in the extreme. It was a fine and gratifying sight to see the myriads of people assembled--more than at the Coronation even, and all in such good humour, and so loyal; the articles in the papers, too, are most kind and gratifying; they say _no_ Sovereign _was more_ loved than I am (I am bold enough to say), and _that_, from our _happy domestic home_--which gives such a good example. The _Times_ you have, and I venture to add a _Chronicle_, as I think it very pretty; you should read the accounts. _I_ seldom remember being so gratified and pleased with any public show, and my beloved Albert was so enthusiastically received by the people. He is _so_ beloved by all the really influential people, and by _all_ right-thinking ones. We came back here yesterday evening. The accounts from Paris are excellent too. How long are the good Joinvilles to remain in the south, and where? By-the-by, dearest Uncle, have you read the continuation of Consuelo,[33] called the \"Comtesse de Rudolstadt\"? It is _dreadfully_ interesting.  The Knights of the Garter did _not_ wear the whole costume, but only the mantle. Being on this topic, shall tell you that I intend giving the Garter to Ernest, but pray do not mention it to E. or _any one_.  With Albert's affectionate love. Ever your devoted Niece and Child,  VICTORIA R.

Je n'oublie donc pas une petite question qui m'a été si joliment adressée, _Where is my gun?_ et à présent j'en ai trouvé un qui serait indigne de la destinée que je prie votre Majesté de me permettre de lui donner, si le regret que la disparition du premier fusil avait causé, ne m'avait pas appris que le second devait être d'un genre à supporter tous les accidents que l'enfance aime à infliger à ses joujoux. C'est donc tout simplement un très modeste fusil de munition adapté a sa taille que j'adresse á votre Majesté pour son auguste et charmant enfant le Prince de Galles, comme ma réponse à sa question.  J'ai encore une autre dette dont je vous prie de me permettre de m'acquitter. Quelque vif que soit mon désir de revoir Windsor, ce serait un trop long retard que d'attendre cet heureux moment, pour offrir à la Princesse Royale cette petite boîte à ouvrage, de Paris, qu'elle m'a fait espérer lui serait agréable, et tout ce que je désire c'est que vos enfants se ressouviennent un jour d'avoir vu celui qui a été le fidèle ami de leur grand-père, comme il l'est et le sera toujours de leurs bien aimés parents.  Que votre Majesté me permette encore d'offrir ici au Prince Albert l'expression de la vive et sincère amitié que je lui porte et que je lui garderai toujours, et d'accepter celle de l'inaltérable attachement avec lequel je suis pour la vie, Madame ma bien chère S[oe]ur, de votre Majesté, le bon Frère bien affectionné et fidèle Ami,  LOUIS PHILIPPE R.
