The buffaloes do that by keeping a lookout nearly all the time. I shall show you how.  Just watch for a minute the buffalo in the middle of the crescent; he is the leader of the herd. We can see him only from the back; but as he is the biggest and tallest buffalo there, we can make him out quite easily. He is grazing quietly, and then moving along.  But see, what is he doing now? Why, he is looking up, straight ahead of him! No, he sees no danger there. So he gives a glance to his right, and then to his left. No, there is no danger there either. So he puts down his head, and starts feeding again.  Thus, you see, every now and again he looks to see that no danger is coming from anywhere in _front_ of the herd.  But what if any danger came from the _side_ of the herd,--right near the end of the crescent,--or even from the _back_ of the herd?   _Buffalo Sentinels_  Let us see what the two buffaloes at the two ends of the crescent are doing. They are the watchers, or _sentinels_, as they are sometimes called. They keep a lookout nearly all the time.  Do you see the one on our left? After every two or three mouthfuls he stops, and takes a look around; he even looks right to the back. Then he takes four or five strides to catch up with the herd, and starts grazing again. Then in a minute or two he takes another look around in the same way.  And the sentinel on our right is doing just the same. Yes, the herd is quite safe; the two sentinels are sure to see if any danger comes from their side or from the back.  \"But will not the sentinels have less to eat, if they are watching half the time?\" you may ask.  Yes, that is quite true. So all the Papa buffaloes take turns being sentinels. After a while the two sentinels from the ends move up toward the middle, and the next ones then begin to keep watch. And they keep changing places like that from day to day. That makes it quite fair for everybody.  When they go to sleep also they are arranged in the form of a crescent; but the two ends are closed up, so that the Papas make a ring, while the Mammas and the children sleep inside the ring.  When the Papas lie down, they are closer together than when they are feeding; and they still keep their heads pointed to the outside of the ring, so that they can get up in a minute, and be quite ready to drive off any tiger. Of course they have sentinels keeping watch all the time.  But now let us see other wonderful things that the buffaloes do, while they are feeding.  We must be very careful how we follow the herd. The ground is now changing, and getting quite rough; so the grass is getting scarce here and there. The buffaloes have not enough grass all the way; so they have to walk on a few yards without eating, till they come to the next patch.  Some of the buffaloes are even having a bite at fresh young shrubs in passing, as they will eat anything green, when they have not enough grass.  But see! The buffaloes are spreading out, as there are not even enough shrubs in one place. You can see gaps in the line of buffaloes now. And the gaps are getting bigger and bigger! Let us watch a few minutes.  Now the gaps are very wide, as some of the buffaloes are lagging behind; and some are turning too much to the side in trying to reach a mouthful from a shrub or a bush here and there.  Why, what is happening now? Some of the buffaloes cannot even see one another now, because of the bushes between them! What are the sentinels doing? And what is the leader doing? Suppose a tiger suddenly comes--  But do you _hear_ that?  \"Moo! Moo!\"  That is the leader. He has just found out that the herd is spread out too far; so he is calling. He is saying, \"Where are you?\"  \"Moo! Moo!\" Do you hear that answer? It comes from the sentinel on the right, who is very far away now; but still he has heard the call. His answer means, \"Here I am!\"  And \"Here I am!\" comes the answer also from the sentinel on the left.  \"Then close up!\" cries the leader.  Each sentinel moves up toward the place from which he heard the leader's voice come. And on his way there he tells all the buffaloes he meets to move up also. Besides, all the buffaloes hear the leader's voice too; so they begin to close up at once.  Is not that a wonderful way of bringing up all those that are lagging behind?  But let us watch the herd again. They have closed up now, and there is no big gap in their line. The ground is level again.  Let us move on from thicket to thicket, and come as near the buffaloes as we can.  What is that? See! The sentinel on the right is looking hard at that jungle grass far away to the side. This kind of jungle grass grows very tall, taller than a man. But why is the sentinel staring at the tall grass? What does he see there?  Yes, there, far away, something is happening! The jungle grass is waving gently, but just in one place! What is making the tall grass wave like that? Is it the wind? No, it cannot be the wind! Why not? Because if it were the wind, _all_ the grass there would wave. Then what is making the tall grass wave in just one place?  It can be only one thing! Some _animal_ is hiding there in the tall grass! And as the animal is coming nearer and nearer to the buffaloes, he is making the grass wave!  See, the sentinel has guessed that also! What is he doing now? Can you _hear_ him? He gives a bellow, deep and long.  \"Danger! Look out!\" That is what he means.  The whole herd hears him. They all close up as near together as they can!  Quick! Let us get up on that tree near by! _We_ are in danger as well as the buffaloes!  One branch higher--and another! Now we are quite safe! But see what the buffaloes are doing!   _Buffaloes Make a Ring when Tiger Comes_  The two ends of the crescent have come close together, and all the Papa buffaloes have made a perfect ring around the Mammas and the children. The Papas are facing the outside of the ring; so they can meet the danger from whatever side it comes.  Why do they do that? Look again at the grass! The tall grass is waving nearer and nearer. So, the animal that is in the grass is coming nearer and nearer.  He comes right to the end of the tall grass. There he makes a gap in the grass, and walks out into the open. It is a tiger!  He was trying to sneak up to the buffaloes; but the sentinel found that out. And now the bull buffaloes are ready for him. The tiger growls in rage. He prowls round and round the ring of bull buffaloes, as you see in the picture. But he dare not try to break through those horns.  He roars with fury, shaking the ground; it is just like thunder. The jungle around is taking fright at the roar. See! All the small animals rush out in fright--wild pigs, wild goats, and all sorts of small deer.  [Illustration: The Tiger and the Ring of Buffaloes]  In their fright they run hither and thither very stupidly. That is exactly why the tiger roars--he wants to make the small animals behave so stupidly, in their fright, that some of them may make a mistake and run straight into his jaws.  See! The small animals scatter to right and left, trying to reach a bush or thicket. But some are cut off from safety, as the tiger stands in their way. What can they do?   _Small Animals Find Safety in Buffalo Ring_  Yes, there is the ring of buffaloes! So those small animals rush straight toward the ring and creep inside--and the buffaloes raise their heads to make a way for them under the horns. Some of them, like the wild goats, jump _over_ the buffaloes' horns to get inside the ring. Anyway, the small animals reach safety inside with the Mammas and the children of the buffaloes.  The tiger stands outside the ring, and still roars in fury. But now nobody is afraid. The bull buffaloes paw the ground impatiently with their hoofs, and rattle their horns. They are going to charge!  But that tiger does not wait for the charge. He does not want to be trampled into a mess. So he slouches away, growling and snarling.  So, as you see, the bull buffaloes guard the Mammas and the children from danger, and they also guard all small and weak animals that come to them for safety.  Did I not tell you that the buffaloes are the Knights of the Jungle?  [Illustration: Tame Water Buffaloes Plowing in the Rice Fields]     CHAPTER VII  Taming the Buffalo   Buffaloes do not always remain wild and wander about in the jungle. Men need buffaloes. Farmers want to use them for plowing the ground, in the same way that farmers in America use horses for plowing.  This kind of buffalo also lives in Italy, and because they are so fond of water they are called _water buffaloes_ there. But in Italy they are not wild any more, as they have been tamed and used by men for a long time.  I shall tell you how the men catch the buffaloes from the jungle in India, where they are still wild.  They catch the buffaloes in many ways. The easiest way is to find some stream or pond where the buffaloes are fond of going. Then the men take strong nets made of ropes, and spread the nets under the water. So when the buffaloes come to bathe or roll in the mud, some of them are caught in the nets.  Then the men rush in from their hiding place and drag out the nets. Of course, those buffaloes which are not caught run away. But those that are caught struggle fiercely. After a time they get tired of struggling, as the nets are too strong for them to break.  When the buffaloes have become very weak from struggling, a lot of men rush up and tie a stout rope around the neck of each buffalo. The rope has two ends, one on each side of the buffalo, and each end is quite long.  A dozen men haul at the rope, and the buffalo has to get up and march with them. In this way the men bring the buffaloes one by one to the village.  How do the men tame the buffaloes? That is quite easy, if they already have a few tame buffaloes which they may have caught and tamed some time before. And as the people have been doing this for many, many years, they always have some "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24852"],["title","The Wonders of the Jungle, Book One (#8)"],["body","buffaloes. So this is the way the men treat the wild buffaloes:   _Wild Buffaloes Tamed Quickly by Kindness_  They put the wild buffaloes and the tame ones together in a pen, or corral. Inside the corral there is a pond. In the deep part of the pond there is plenty of good water to drink; and in the shallow part of the pond there is plenty of mud in which the buffaloes may roll about and wallow.  The men keep the buffaloes there together for many days, the wild ones and the tame ones. Every day the men throw into the corral plenty of fresh grass, which the buffaloes can eat all day.  Now, what more could the wild buffaloes want? They could not be treated any better! They have plenty to eat, plenty to drink, and plenty of mud in which to wallow. The tame buffaloes soon make friends with them, and talk to them in their own language.  \"You will not be any better off in the jungle,\" the tame ones say to the wild ones. \"Here you do not have to walk about all day to get enough to eat, and then walk a good way to find water to drink, or a place in which to wallow. And, also, we have no fear of tigers here. What more do you want?\"  So in a few weeks the wild ones become quite tame. Still, even after that, the old and the new ones are always kept together, and soon they become like one herd.  Afterwards, when the farmers use them for plowing, they always hitch to the plow one buffalo that has been tame for a long time, and one that is newly-tamed. Then it becomes easy for the new one to learn the work by just doing as his friend does.  The farmer uses the buffaloes for plowing for only a few hours, and he gives them plenty of time for wallowing and enjoying themselves. So, even if they have to do a little work, the new buffaloes soon see that they are really much better off living in the village than running wild in the jungle.  After the plowing season is over, the buffaloes have no work at all. They can wallow all day, if they want to.  When all the new buffaloes are quite tame, they are not kept in the corral any more, as they would never think of running away now. They are allowed to lie about and sleep in a little plot of ground somewhere in the village. By daytime they are taken out into the fields outside the village, and allowed to graze as they please; and as there is always a stream or a pond near, the buffaloes can go into the water or the mud whenever they like.  So, as you understand, the buffaloes very soon become quite tame. Why? Because they are treated kindly. Please remember that. _Most wild animals can be tamed if treated kindly._  Now I am coming to the nicest part about the buffaloes. It is the nicest part because it shows how the buffaloes can even be made to love us.  I have just told you that the buffaloes are taken out into the fields to graze. Well, then, somebody has to do that in the morning, and somebody has to bring them home in the evening.  Can you tell who does that? Why, there is a herdsman to do it, you may say. Quite true. But the herdsman does not bother to do a simple thing like that every day.   _Little Boys Take Charge of Buffaloes_  Then who does it? I shall tell you. The little boys of the village! They are about five or six years of age. They are not old enough to go to school, and not old enough to do any work; so they can play all day.  The most useful thing they can do is to take charge of the buffaloes. The boys soon learn all the buffalo calls--\"Come out to graze,\" \"Come to wallow,\" or \"Come home now.\" And the wonderful thing is that these huge animals soon learn to obey these calls. When the boys call to them, the buffaloes do just as they are ordered.  The buffaloes soon learn to love the little boys. You know how fond of us an animal can become--especially a dog or a horse. Still, I do not think that any animal can show such love for us as the huge buffaloes do for the little boys who act as their herdsmen.  Why? Because the little boys _share the same mud_ with the buffaloes! Boys and buffaloes mix very well with mud! The little boys tumble about in the mud on the side of the bank where the buffaloes may be wallowing. Or the boys will splash about in the water where the buffaloes are lying neck deep to keep cool. Or they will climb up on the buffaloes' backs for a while, then tumble off and play again.  Even when the buffaloes are grazing in the field, the boys may be near them, playing hide and seek, and running in and out between the buffaloes' legs, or under their horns. So the boys are with the buffaloes all day long.   _How the Big Buffaloes Love the Little Boys_  It is quite wonderful to see a little boy actually twisting a huge buffalo's tail. As I have told you, a buffalo is often more than ten feet long, and taller than a tall man; and it has horns that reach out more than a yard from each side of the head. This huge animal could charge and smash up a big wagon as easily as if it were a match box; and yet he will stand still and let his tail be twisted by any little tot in the village.  Sometimes you may see a sight like this: A huge buffalo is grazing hungrily, and a little boy comes up and stands right in front of him.  \"Put up your head!\" says the boy. But the buffalo goes on feeding hungrily.  \"Put up your head, or I will spank you!\" says the boy. But the buffalo still goes on feeding hungrily.  Then that tot raises his small hand and spanks the huge buffalo on the jaw. The buffalo puts up his head, and rubs his nose lovingly against the boy.  Well, why not? You have seen a baby pulling his Papa's hair. The Papa just loves the baby all the more for it. So it is with the buffalo and the little tot. And it would not matter a bit whether the tot were a little boy or a little girl. The big buffalo is fond of both.  And now I shall tell you a wonderful true story about a buffalo and a boy.     CHAPTER VIII  The Buffalo and the Boy   In a village there were many tame buffaloes, and among them thirty bull buffaloes. The little boys of the village took charge of them every day. The smartest boy among them was called Gulab. He was six years of age.  Gulab knew quite well each of the thirty bull buffaloes, and was a friend of each. Sometimes he alone had charge of them, and took them out to graze and to wallow. That was because his father was the herdsman.  The buffaloes loved Gulab, and they did exactly as he told them to do. When he was going to take them to the fields, he would just stamp his little bare foot and call out to them \"Stand in rows!\" And the huge animals would stand in rows, one line behind another.  Then Gulab would come around to the side, and see if each line was straight. If the line was not quite straight, and a buffalo happened to be standing too much this way or that, Gulab would walk up to the buffalo and spank him on the jaw. Then the buffalo would move into line, exactly as Gulab wanted him to do. Or, if a buffalo happened to be standing too far behind, Gulab would come around to the back and twist the buffalo's tail, and the buffalo would move up into line.  Then, when the whole herd was in the right order, Gulab would come to the front of the herd, and walk up to the biggest bull.  \"Bend down your head, Baldo!\" he would order.  And Baldo, the biggest bull, in the middle of the front line, would bend down his head, and Gulab would climb up by one of the horns, scramble up Baldo's neck, and sit down on his back.  \"March!\" Gulab would order--and the whole herd would march.  Now, a few miles away there was a grand palace. In the palace was a little Prince, whose father was a Rajah--that is, a kind of king. The little Prince's birthday was coming, and his father ordered grand feasts for many days.  The Rajah had six English friends, who were quite big men. The Englishmen were very fond of tiger hunting, so the Rajah wanted to order a tiger hunt for them. But it is not easy to have a tiger hunt just when you want to have it. Why not? Because the tiger will _not_ come out and be hunted just when you want him to. He would rather stay in his den.  So for a few days no one heard of a tiger prowling about. Then suddenly a strange piece of news came from that village where Gulab lived. It happened in this way:  One day Gulab took out the buffaloes to graze and to wallow. The buffaloes lay down in the shallow water for a while, and Gulab splashed about or tumbled in the mud near them. Then he got tired of doing that, and came out on the bank and played about there for a while.  Suddenly he heard a strange sound. It was one of the buffaloes, who had stood up in the water and was giving a low, deep bellow. Two or three other buffaloes stood up also, and gave a low, deep bellow. Then all at once the whole lot of them began to come out of the water.  Gulab stopped in his play to see what was wrong. But he could see nothing.  \"What's the matter, Baldo?\" he asked. \"What's wrong, Chando?\"  But the two biggest bulls scrambled up the bank, and came rushing toward the boy. All the other bulls came also, and some went past him on the right side, and some went past him on the left side. Then suddenly Gulab knew what it all meant!  A snarl--a growl--a roar, he heard. A flash of yellow leaped out of the jungle, and came toward him with a huge jump. It was a tiger!  But already the buffaloes were making a ring around Gulab. Then he knew what had happened. The tiger had seen him from the jungle beyond, and had been trying to creep up to him quietly from thicket to thicket. But the buffaloes had _smelled_ the tiger in time, and had run out of the pond to save Gulab. And now they had made a ring around him.  Gulab stood in the ring and looked with large round eyes, for he was more frightened than he had ever been in his life. He was only a little boy, and had never seen a tiger face to face.  The tiger growled and snarled and roared. Then it came round and round the ring, trying to find a gap between the horns to get at the boy. But there was no gap between the "]]]
