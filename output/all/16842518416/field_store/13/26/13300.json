Mouldy luck, and one splinter smashed the last bottle of whisky.\"  The gunner relapsed into moody silence at the remembrance of the tragedy.  Two beds further along the Padre was playing a game of chess with a Major in the Devons; and on the opposite side of the tent another chaplain, grey haired and clean shaven, was talking and laughing with a boy, whose face and head were swathed in bandages.  The R.C. and the C. of E. exponents hunting in couples as these two always did. . . .  They are not the only two who before the war would have relegated the other to the nethermost depths of the deepest Hell; but whose eyes have been opened to wisdom now.  Vane was no theologian--no more than are the thousands of others across the water.  Before the war he had been in the habit of dismissing any religious question by the comforting assertion that if all one's pals are in Hell, one might as well join them.  But in the Game of Death the thoughts of many men have probed things they passed over lightly before.  It is not doctrine they want; faith and belief in beautiful formulas have become less and less satisfying.  They are beginning to think for themselves, which is anathema to the Church.  Of old she prevented such a calamity by a policy of terrorising her followers; of later years she has adopted the simpler one of boring them.  And yet it is only simplicity they want; the simple creeds of helping on the other fellow and playing the game is what they understand.  But they will have to be reminded of it from time to time.  One wonders whether the Church will be big enough to seize the opportunity that stares her in the face.  Vane nodded to the grey-haired Roman Catholic as he paused at the foot of his bed.  \"Shoulder painful?\"  The priest held out a lighted match for Vane's cigarette.  \"Throbs a bit, Padre; but it might be worse.\"  He smiled and lay back on his pillows.  \"An arm makes one feel so helpless.\"  \"I think I'd sooner lose an arm than a leg,\" remarked the Gunner from the next bed.  For a while they pursued this debatable point, much as men discuss politics, and incidentally with far less heat. . . .  It was a question of interest, and the fact that the Gunner _had_ lost his leg made no difference to the matter at all.  An onlooker would have listened in vain for any note of complaint. . . .  \"Time you were getting to sleep--both of you.\"  Margaret's voice interrupted the conversation, and Vane looked up with a smile.  She was shaking an admonitory finger at Father O'Rourke, and with a sudden quickening of the pulse he realised how perfectly charming she looked.  \"Sister, dear,\" said the Gunner, \"you're on my side, aren't you?  It's better to lose an arm than a leg, isn't it?\"  For a moment she affected to consider the point.  Then suddenly she smiled, and came between their beds.  \"Unless you both of you go to sleep at once I'll come and wash you again.\"  With a groan of horror the Gunner hid himself under the bed-clothes, and Margaret, still smiling, turned to Vane.  \"Good night, Derek,\" she said very low.  \"Sometimes I just want to sit down and howl. . . .\"  And Vane, looking up into her face, saw that her eyes were a little misty. . . .  Gradually the ward settled down into silence.  Right at the other end a man was groaning feebly; while just opposite, looking ghastly in the dim light, a boy was staring round the tent with eyes that did not see. For hours on end he lay unconscious, breathing the rattling breath of the badly gassed; then suddenly he would lift his head, and his eyes, fixed and staring, would slowly turn from bed to bed.  He looked as a man looks who is walking in his sleep, and Vane knew he was very near the Great Divide.  He had been hit in the chest by a piece of shell, and a bit of his coat impregnated with mustard gas had been driven into his lungs. . . .  Every now and then Margaret passed noiselessly down the centre between the two rows of beds.  Once she lent over Vane and he closed his eyes pretending to be asleep.  But every time as she came to the boy opposite she stopped and looked at him anxiously.  Once she was joined by a doctor, and Vane heard their muttered conversation . . .  \"I can't get him to take his medicine, Doctor.  He doesn't seem able to do anything.\"  \"It doesn't much matter, Nurse,\" he whispered--why is it that the sick-room whisper seems to travel as far as the voice of the Sergeant-Major on parade?  \"He won't get through to-night, and I'm afraid we can't do anything.\"  The doctor turned away, and Margaret went to the end of the tent and sat down at her table.  A reading lamp threw a light on her face, and for a while Vane watched her.  Then his eyes came back to the boy opposite, and rested on him curiously.  He was unconscious once again, and it suddenly struck Vane as strange that whereas, up in front, he had seen death and mutilation in every possible and impossible form--that though he had seen men hit by a shell direct, and one man crushed by a Tank--yet he had never been impressed with the same sense of the utter futility of war as now, in face of this boy dying in the bed opposite.  To have come so far and then to pay the big price; it was so hard--so very pitiful; and Vane turned over to shut out the sight.  He felt suddenly frightened of the thing that was coming nearer and nearer to the dying boy; furious at the inability of the science which had struck him down to save him. . . .  Vane closed his eyes and tried to sleep, but sleep was far away that night.  Whenever he opened them he saw Margaret writing at her table; and once there came to him an irresistible temptation to speak to her. He felt that he wanted her near him, if only for a moment; he wanted to lean on her--he wanted to be taken in her arms like a little child. Angrily he closed his eyes again.  It was ridiculous, absurd, weak. . . .  But there have been times in this war when the strongest man has sobbed like a child in his weakness. . . .  \"Sister!\"  Vane hardly recognised it as his own voice calling. \"Sister!\"  Margaret came towards him down the ward.  \"Could you get me something to drink?\"  In a moment she had returned with some lemonade.  \"I thought you were asleep, Derek,\" she whispered.  \"Are you feeling feverish?\"  She put a cool hand on his forehead, and with a sigh of relief Vane lay back.  \"I'm frightened, Margaret,\" he said so low that she scarce could hear him.  \"Just scared to death . . . of that boy opposite.  Ain't I a damned fool?\"  Her only answer was the faintest perceptible pressure on his forehead. Then his hand came up and took hers, and she felt the touch of his lips on it.  For a moment she let it rest there, and then gently withdrew it, while with a tired sigh Vane closed his eyes. . . .  He slept maybe for two hours, and then he found himself wide awake again--every nerve intent, like a man aroused by a sudden noise. Margaret was reading at her table; the man at the other end still groaned feebly in his sleep; the boy was staring dazedly at nothing in particular--but there was something else.  He knew it.  Suddenly Margaret put down her book, and half rose from her chair, as if listening; and at the same moment the Gunner woke up.  Then they all heard it together--that high pitched, ominous drone which rises and falls in a manner there is no mistaking.  \"Boche,\" said the Gunner, \"Boche, for a tanner.  And lots of them.\"  \"Damn the swine,\" muttered Vane.  \"Can't they even leave a hospital alone?\"  The next minute any lingering hope was destroyed.  Both men heard it--the well-known whistling whooce of the bomb--the vicious crack as it burst; both men felt the ground trembling through their beds.  That was the overture . . . the play was about to commence. . . .  All around them bombs rained down till the individual bursts merged into one continuous roar.  The earth shook and palpitated, and, to make matters worse, the lights suddenly went out.  The last thing Vane saw was Margaret as she made her way, calmly and without faltering, to the boy's bed.  He had a picture, printed indelibly on his brain, of a girl with a sweet set face, of a gaping boy, stirred into some semblance of remembrance by the familiar noise around him.  And then, in the darkness, he made his way towards her.  There was a deafening crash close to him, and a fragment tore through the side of the tent.  He could see the blinding flash, and involuntarily he ducked his head.  Then, running and stumbling, he reached her.  He felt her standing rigid in the darkness, and even at such a moment he felt a sudden rush of joy as her hands come out to meet him.  \"Lie down,\" he shouted, \"lie down at once. . . .\"  \"The boy,\" she cried.  \"Help me with him, Derek.\"  Together they picked him up, fumbling in the darkness, and laid him on the ground beside his bed.  Then Vane took her arm, and shouted in her ear, \"Lie down, I tell you, lie down . . . quite flat.\"  Obediently she lay down, and he stretched himself beside her on the ground.  To the crashing of the bombs were now added the shouts and curses of men outside; and once Margaret made an effort to rise.  \"The patients, Derek.  Let me go.\"  With his one sound arm he kept her down by force.  \"You can do nothing,\" he said roughly.  He felt her trembling against him, and a wave of fury against the airmen above took hold of him.  He was no novice to bombing; there had been weeks on end when the battalion had been bombed nightly.  But then it had been part of the show--what they expected; here it was so different.  A sense of utter impotence filled his mind, coupled"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24945"],["title","Mufti (#5)"],["body","a raging passion at the danger to the girl beside him.  And suddenly his lips sought hers.  \"It's all right, my dear,\" he kept on saying, \"quite all right.  It'll be over soon.\"  And so almost unconscious of what they said or did, they lay and listened to the tornado of Death around them. . . .  It is on record that one man once said that he thought it was rather amusing to be in a raid.  That man was a liar.  He was also a fool. . . .  To be bombed is poisonous, rather more poisonous than to be shelled.  If there are no dug-outs there is only one thing to be done, and that is what Vane was doing.  To lie flat on the ground minimises the danger except from a direct hit; and a direct hit is remarkably sudden.  And so--since every occupant of Number 13 was well aware of this fact, approximately five seconds elapsed after the light went out before all the patients who could move, and most of those who couldn't, were lying on the floor beside their beds.  Gradually the explosions became fewer and fewer; though the earth still shook and throbbed like a living thing, and at last it seemed to Vane that the raid was over.  He was lifting himself on his elbow preparatory to going outside and exploring, when an ominous whistling noise seemed to pierce his very brain.  He had just time to throw himself on to the girl beside him so that he partially covered her, when the last bomb came.  He heard the top of the marquee rip: there was a deafening roar in his ears: a scorching flame enveloped him.  He lay stiff and rigid, and the thought flashed through him that this was the end.  The next moment he knew he was safe, and that it was merely another close shave such as he had not been unaccustomed to in the past.  The bomb had burst in the tent, but the Fate which ordained things had decided it should miss him.  It had done so before, and Vane laughed to himself . . .  \"Close, my lady, very close,\" he whispered--\"but not quite close enough.\"  With a quick, savage movement he turned Margaret's face towards him, and kissed her on the lips.  For a while she clung to him, and then he felt her relax in his arms.  She had fainted, and as he realised this, he felt something pressing down on him.  With his sound arm he fumbled above his head, and found it was the canvas of the tent.  Tugging and scrambling, he half dragged, half carried Margaret through the entrance which still remained intact, and laid her down on the grass outside.  Men and nurses were moving about in the darkness, stumbling over guy ropes and tent pegs.  For the moment every one was too intent on his own affairs to bother over a mere faint, and Vane left her lying against the side of the tent.  Then he cautiously felt his way round to investigate the damage.  A great crater midway between Number 13 and the next tent showed where the first close one had fallen, but he had no wish to explore that any further.  He stumbled round the edge and went on.  Then in the faint light given by the moon, he saw what had happened when the last bomb had burst.  It was nothing worse than many similar sights he had seen, but Vane as he looked at the wreckage cursed bitterly and fluently.  And then of a sudden he stopped cursing, and drew a deep breath. . . .  Staring up at him in the cold white light was what was left of the Gunner subaltern.  The bomb had burst at the foot of his bed . . .  A cheery soul . . .  A bitter end . . .  Opposite, the bed blown in half, the boy who would not have lasted through the night sprawled uncouthly on to the floor.  God knows! a merciful release. . . .  A few hours sooner--that's all. . . .  And to both--Kismet.  All around lay fragments and debris.  For a few seconds he stood there motionless, while every now and then the canvas heaved where it lay on the ground, and someone crawled out into the open.  Then he felt a touch on his arm, and, turning, he saw Margaret.  Dry-eyed, she watched with him, while the wounded dragged themselves painfully past the still smoking crater, and the acrid smell of high explosive tainted the air.  In the far distance the drone of aeroplanes was getting fainter and fainter.  Success had crowned the raider's daring exploit; they were entitled to their well-earned rest.  And so for a space did Vane and Margaret stand. . . .  It was only when very gently he slipped his arm round her waist that a hard dry sob shook her.  \"Oh! the devils,\" she whispered--\"the vile devils.\"     CHAPTER III  The following afternoon Vane turned his steps once again towards the beach at Paris Plage.  The wreckage in the hospital had been cleared away, and there were rows laid side by side in the mortuary.  Over everyone there breathed a sense of restless excitement and fierce anger, and Vane wanted to get away by himself.  He felt that he had to think.  For suddenly and quite unexpectedly Margaret Trent had become a factor in his life.  After long years their paths had touched again, and Vane found that he could not turn away with the same careless indifference as he had in the past.  Though she had always attracted him, he had never seriously contemplated the final step; he had had far too good a time as a bachelor.  And then when she had so unaccountably cooled towards him, he had shrugged his shoulders and sought distraction elsewhere.  Before the war Derek Vane had been what is generally described as a typical Englishman.  That is to say, he regarded his own country--whenever he thought about it at all--as being the supreme country in the world.  He didn't force his opinion down anyone's throat; it simply was so.  If the other fellow didn't agree, the funeral was his, not Vane's.  He had to the full what the uninitiated regard as conceit; on matters connected with literature, or art, or music his knowledge was microscopic.  Moreover, he regarded with suspicion anyone who talked intelligently on such subjects.  On the other hand, he had been in the eleven at Eton, and was a scratch golfer.  He had a fine seat on a horse and rode straight; he could play a passable game of polo, and was a good shot.  Possessing as he did sufficient money to prevent the necessity of working, he had not taken the something he was supposed to be doing in the City very seriously. He had put in a periodical appearance at a desk and drawn pictures on the blotting paper; for the remainder of the time he had amused himself.  He belonged, in fact, to the Breed; the Breed that has always existed in England, and will always exist till the world's end.  You may meet its members in London and in Fiji; in the lands that lie beyond the mountains and at Henley; in the swamps where the stagnant vegetation rots and stinks; in the great deserts where the night air strikes cold.  They are always the same, and they are branded with the stamp of the breed.  They shake your hand as a man shakes it; they meet your eye as a man meets it.  Just now a generation of them lie around Ypres and La Bassée; Neuve Chapelle and Bapaume.  The graves are overgrown and the crosses are marked with indelible pencil.  Dead--yes; but not the Breed.  The Breed never dies. . . .  We have it on reliable evidence that the breed has its faults; its education is rotten.  Men of great learning and understanding have fulminated on the subject; women with their vast experience have looked upon the Breed with great clarity of vision and have written as their eyes have seen; even boys themselves who doubtless must be right, as the question concerns them most, have contributed to current literature one or two damning indictments.  It may well be that hunting butterflies or dissecting rats are more suitable pursuits for young Percival Johnson than doing scram practice up against the playground wall.  It may well be that it would be a far, far better thing for mob adoration to be laid at the feet of the composer of the winning Greek Iambic rather than at the cricketing boots of the Captain of the Eleven.  It may be so, but, then, most assuredly it may not. . . .  The system which has turned out hundreds of the Breed, and whose object is to mould all who pass through it on the model of the Breed, is not one to be dismissed lightly.  Doubtless it has its faults; a little more latitude both in games and work might be allowed; originality encouraged more.  But let us be very certain before we gaily pull the system to pieces that the one we erect in its place will stand the strain, and produce the one great result beside which everything else is as nothing.  For if, at the price of team work and playing for the side, we can only buy two or three more years of individualism--at an age when the value of individualism is, at best, a doubtful blessing and, at worst, sheer blatant selfishness--we shall indeed have messed things up.  The cranks will be delighted; but the Empire will gnash its teeth.   And now after nearly four years in the fiercest forcing house of character Derek Vane found himself trying to take an inventory of his own stock.  And since the material question of money did not come in to cloud the horizon, he felt he could do it impartially.  There are many now who, having sacrificed every prospect, find their outlook haunted by the spectre of want; there are many more, formerly engaged in skilled trades such as engineering or mining, who find that they have four years of leeway to make up in their profession--four years of increased knowledge and mechanical improvements--unknown to them, but not to their competitors, who remained behind.  But such prospects did not trouble him.  The future, as far as money was concerned, was assured.  Vane thoughtfully lit a cigarette.  It seemed to him that he had wasted four of the best years of his life, sitting, save for brief intervals, on the same filthy piece of ground, with the sole object of killing complete strangers before they killed him.  In this laudable pastime he had succeeded to the extent of two for certain and one doubtful.  The only man whom he"]]]
