The rabbit had made a plan to go and get the ox without waiting to finish his work. Just as he started off he saw the tiger returning. The tiger noticed that the rabbit had not worked so well when he was away. After that he stayed and watched the rabbit until the whole farm was cleared. Then the tiger gave the rabbit the ox as he had promised.  \"You must kill this ox,\" he said to the rabbit, \"in a place where there are neither flies nor mosquitoes.\"  The rabbit went away with the ox. After he had gone for some distance he thought he would kill him. He heard a cock, however, crowing in the distance and he knew that there must be a farm yard near. There would be flies of course. He went on farther and again he thought that he would kill the ox. The ground looked moist and damp and so did the leaves on the bushes. Since the rabbit thought there would be mosquitoes there he decided not to kill the ox. He went on and on and finally he came to a high place where there was a strong breeze blowing. \"There are no mosquitoes here,\" he said to himself. \"The place is so far removed from any habitation that there are no flies, either.\" He decided to kill the ox.  Just as he was ready to eat the ox, along came the tiger. \"O, rabbit, you have been such a good friend of mine,\" said the tiger, \"and now I am so very, very hungry that all my ribs show, as you yourself can see. Will you not be a good kind rabbit and give me a piece of your ox?\"  The rabbit gave the tiger a piece of the ox. The tiger devoured it in the twinkling of an eye. Then he leaned back and said, \"Is that all you are going to give me to eat?\"  The tiger looked so big and savage that the rabbit did not dare refuse to give him any more of the ox. The tiger ate and ate and ate until he had devoured that entire ox. The rabbit had been able to get only a tiny morsel of it. He was very, very angry at the tiger.  One day not long after the rabbit went to a place not far from the tiger's house and began cutting down big staves of wood. The tiger soon happened along and asked him what he was doing.  \"I'm getting ready to build a stockade around myself,\" replied the rabbit. \"Haven't you heard the orders?\" The tiger said that he hadn't heard any orders.  \"That is very strange,\" said the rabbit. \"The order has gone forth that every beast shall fortify himself by building a stockade around himself. All the beasts are doing it.\"  The tiger became very much alarmed. \"O, dear! O, dear! What shall I do,\" he cried. \"I don't know how to build a stockade. I never could do it in the world. O, good rabbit! O, kind rabbit! You are such, a very good friend of mine. Couldn't you, as a great favour, because of our long friendship, build a stockade about me before you build one around yourself?\"  The rabbit replied that he could not think of risking his own life by building the tiger's fortifications first. Finally, however, he consented to do it.  The rabbit cut down great quantities of long sharp sticks. He set them firmly in the ground about the tiger. He fastened others securely over the top until the tiger was completely shut in by strong bars. Then he went away and left the tiger.  The tiger waited and waited for something to happen to show him the need of the fortifications. Nothing at all happened.  He got very hungry and thirsty. After a while the monkey passed that way.  The tiger called out, \"O, monkey, has the danger passed?\"  The monkey did not know what danger the tiger meant, but he replied, \"Yes.\"  Then the tiger said, \"O, monkey, O, good, kind monkey, will you not please be so kind as to help me out of my stockade?\"  \"Let the one who got you in there help you out,\" replied the monkey and he went on his way.  Along came the goat and the tiger called out, \"O, goat, has the danger passed?\"  The goat did not know anything about any danger, but he replied, \"Yes.\"  Then the tiger said, \"O, goat, O, good kind goat, please be so kind as to help me out of my stockade.\"  \"Let the one who got you in there help you out,\" replied the goat as he went on his way.  Along came the armadillo and the tiger called out, \"O, armadillo, has the danger passed?\"  The armadillo had not heard of any danger, but he replied that it had passed.  Then the tiger said, \"O, armadillo, O, good, kind armadillo, you have always been such a good friend and neighbour. Please help me now to get out of my stockade.\"  \"Let the one who got you in there help you out,\" replied the armadillo as he went on his way.  The tiger jumped and jumped with all his force at the top of the stockade, but he could not break through. He jumped and jumped with all his might at the front side of the stockade, but he could not break through. He thought that never in the world would he be able to break out. He rested for a little while and as he rested he thought. He thought how bright the sun was shining outside. He thought what good hunting there was in the jungle. He thought how cool the water was at the spring. Once more he jumped and jumped with all his might at the back side of the stockade. At last he broke through. He did not get through, however, without getting bad cuts on both his sides from the sharp edges of the staves. Until this day the tiger has stripes on both his sides.     V  Why the Lamb Is Meek   Once upon a time there was a little lamb frisking gaily about the pasture. The bright sunshine and the soft breezes made him very happy. He had just finished a hearty meal and that made him happy too. He was the very happiest little lamb in all the world and he thought that he was the most wonderful little lamb.  A big toad sat on the ground and watched him. After a while the toad said: \"O, little lamb, how are you feeling today?\"  The lamb replied that he had never felt better in all his life.  \"Even though you are feeling very strong I can pull you into the sea,\" said the toad.  The little lamb laughed and laughed until he rolled over on the ground.  \"Just take hold of this rope and I'll show you how easy it is to pull you into the sea,\" said the toad.  The lamb took hold of the rope. Then the toad said, \"Please wait a minute while I get a good long distance away from you. I can pull better when I'm not too near you.\"  The lamb waited and the toad hopped down to the sea. He hopped up into a tree which hung over the water's edge and from there he hopped on to the whale's back. He fastened the end of the rope around the whale and then he called out to the lamb: \"All ready. Now we'll see how hard you can pull.\"  When the whale felt the lamb pulling at the rope he swam away from the shore. No matter how hard the lamb pulled or how much force he exerted it did not do one bit of good. He was dragged down to the water's edge as easily as could be.  \"I give up,\" said the lamb as he reached the water's edge.  After that, although the sunshine was just as bright as ever, any one who watched that little lamb could see that he was a little more meek.  One day not long afterwards the sunshine was again very bright and the little lamb was again feeling frisky. He was so happy and gay that he had forgotten all about how the toad had pulled him down to the water until the toad spoke to him. Then he remembered.  \"O, little lamb, how are you feeling today?\" asked the toad. The little lamb replied that he was very well.  \"Let us run a race,\" said the toad, \"I think I can beat you.\"  \"You may be strong enough to pull me into the sea,\" said the lamb, \"but surely I can run faster than you. I've watched you hopping about my pasture. You can't run fast at all. However, I'll gladly run a race with you to prove what I say.\"  The toad set a goal and told the lamb to call out every little while during the race so he could see how much farther ahead the lamb was. Then the toad and the lamb started.  The toad had assembled all his brothers and his sisters and his cousins and his uncles and his aunts before the race and had stationed them at various points along the path of the race. He had told them that whenever any of them should hear the lamb calling out, \"Laculay, laculay, laculay,\" the toad which was nearest should answer, \"Gulugubango, bango lay.\"  The lamb ran and ran as fast as he could. Then he remembered his promise and called out, \"Laculay, laculay, laculay.\" He expected to hear the toad answer from a long, long distance behind him. He was much surprised to hear some one near him answer, \"Gulugubango, bango lay.\" After that he ran faster than ever.  After running on for some distance farther the lamb again called out, \"Laculay, laculay, laculay.\" Again he heard the answer at only a short distance away, \"Gulugubango, bango lay.\" He ran and ran until his little heart was beating so fast that it seemed as if it would burst. At last he arrived at the goal of the race which the toad had set and there sat the toad's brother who looked so much like him that the lamb couldn't tell them apart. The lamb went back to his pasture very meekly and quietly. He acknowledged that he had been beaten in the race.  The next morning the toad said to him, \"Even though you did not run fast enough to win the race, still you are a very fast runner. I have told the daughter of the king about you and I have said to her that some day she shall see me riding on your back with a bridle in your mouth as if you were my horse.\"  The lamb was very angry. \"Perhaps you are strong enough to pull me into the sea, and perhaps you can beat me when we run a race,\" said the lamb, \"but never, never in the world will I be your horse.\"  Time passed and the sunshine was very bright and the soft, gentle breezes were very sweet. The lamb was so happy again that he forgot all about how the toad had pulled him into the sea, and how the toad had beaten him at running the race. He was very sorry for the toad when he saw him all humped up in a disconsolate little heap one day. \"O, poor toad, are you sick?\" he asked. \"Isn't there something I can"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24714"],["title","Fairy Tales from Brazil: How and Why Tales from Brazilian Folk-Lore (#3)"],["body"," to help you?\"  The toad told him how very sick he was. \"There is something you could do to help me,\" he said, \"but I don't believe that you are quite strong enough or can travel quite fast enough.\"  The lamb took a deep breath and blew out his chest. \"I'll show you,\" he said. \"Just tell me what it is.\"  The toad replied that he had promised to be at a party that afternoon at the house of the king's daughter and he did not see how he could possibly get there unless some one would carry him.  \"Jump on my back,\" said the lamb. \"I'll carry you.\"  The toad shook about on the lamb's back after they had started so that it seemed as if he would surely fall off. After a little he said, \"I can not possibly stand riding like this. It jars all my sore spots. I'll have to get off.\" He tried it a little while longer and shook about worse than ever. Then he said, \"Do you know, I think I could endure this painful ride a little better if only I had something to hold myself by? Do you mind if I take a piece of grass and put it in your mouth? I can hold on to that when I shake about and my sore spots will not hurt so much.\"  The lamb let the toad put a piece of grass in his mouth.  After a while the toad asked for a little stick. \"The flies and mosquitoes annoy me terribly,\" he said. \"If only I had a little stick I could wave it about over my head and frighten them away. It is very bad for any one in my weak, nervous condition to be bothered by flies and mosquitoes.\" The lamb let the toad have a little stick to wave over his head.  At last the lamb and the toad drew near to the palace of the king. The king's daughter was leaning out of the window watching for them. The toad dug his feet into the lamb's sides, pulled hard on the piece of the grass in the lamb's mouth and waved the little stick about over the lamb's head. \"Go on, horse,\" he said and the king's daughter heard him. She laughed and laughed, and when all the rest of the people in the palace saw the toad arriving mounted on the lamb's back and driving him like a horse they laughed too. The lamb went meekly home to his pasture and from that day to this when one wishes to speak of meekness one says \"as meek as a lamb.\"     VI  Why the Tiger and the Stag  Fear Each Other   Once upon a time there was a large handsome stag with great branching horns. One day he said to himself, \"I am tired of having no home of my own, and of just living anywhere. I shall build me a house.\" He searched on every hill, in every valley, by every stream, and under all the trees for a suitable place. At last he found one that was just right. It was not too high, nor too low, not too near a stream and not too far away from one, not under too thick trees and not away from the trees out under the hot sun. \"I am going to build my house here,\" he said, and he began to clear a place for it at once. He worked all day and did not go away until night.  Now in that same country there lived a large handsome tiger, with sharp, sharp teeth and bright, cruel eyes. One day the tiger said to himself, \"I am tired of having no home of my own,--of just living around anywhere! I shall build me a house.\" Accordingly the tiger searched for a place to build his house. He searched on every hill, in every valley, by every stream, and under all the trees. At last he found a place which was just right. It was not too high nor too low, not too near a stream and not too far away from one, not under too thick trees and yet not away from the trees out in the hot sun. The tiger said to himself, \"I am going to build my house here. The place is all ready for me for there isn't very much underbrush here.\" He began at once and finished clearing the place. Then it became daylight and he went away.  At daylight the stag came back to do more work on his new house. \"H'm,\" he said when he looked at the clearing. \"Somebody is helping me. The place is cleared and ready for me to build the foundation.\"  He began to work at once and worked all day. At night when the foundation was laid, he went away.  At night the tiger came to work at his new house. \"H'm,\" he said when he looked at it. \"Somebody is helping me. The foundations of my house are all laid.\" He began to work at once and built the sides of the house. He worked all night and went away at daybreak, leaving the house with the sides completed. There was a big door and a funny little window in the side.  At daybreak the stag came back to work on his house. When he saw it he rubbed his eyes for he thought that he must be dreaming. The sides of the house were completed with a big door and a funny little window. \"Somebody must surely be helping me,\" he said to himself as he began to work to put on the roof. He worked hard all day and when the sun went down, there was a roof of dried grass on the house. \"I can sleep in my own house to-night,\" he said. He made his bed in the corner and soon was sound asleep.  At night the tiger came back to work on his new house. When he saw it he rubbed his eyes for he thought that he must be dreaming. There was a roof of dried grass on the house.  \"Somebody must surely be helping me,\" he said to himself as he entered the door. The first thing he saw when he entered the door was the stag sound asleep in his bed in the corner. \"Who are you and what are you doing in my house?\" he said in his deepest voice.  The stag woke up with a start. \"Who are you and what are you doing in my house?\" said the stag in his deepest voice.  \"It is not your house. It is mine. I built it myself,\" said the tiger.  \"It is my house,\" said the stag. \"I built it myself.\"  \"I made the clearing for the house,\" said the tiger, \"I built the sides and made the door and window.\"  \"I started the clearing,\" said the stag. \"I laid the foundations and put on the roof of dried grass.\"  The stag and the tiger quarrelled all night about whose house it was. At daybreak they decided that they would live together there.  The next night the tiger said to the stag, \"I'm going hunting. Get the water and have the wood ready for the fire. I shall be almost famished when I return.\"  The stag got the wood and water ready. After a while the tiger came back. He brought home for dinner a great handsome stag. The stag had no appetite at all and he didn't sleep a wink that night.  The next day the stag said that he was going hunting. He told the tiger to have the wood and water ready when he got back. The tiger got the wood and water ready. By and by the stag came back bringing with him the body of a great tiger.  \"I am nearly famished,\" said the stag. \"Let's have dinner right away.\" The tiger hadn't any appetite at all and he could not eat a mouthful.  That night neither the tiger nor the stag could sleep a wink. The tiger was afraid the stag would kill him if he shut his eyes for a minute, and the stag was afraid the tiger would kill him if he slept or even pretended to be asleep. Accordingly he kept wide awake too.  Toward morning the stag got very cramped from keeping in one position so long. He moved his head slightly. In doing this his horns struck against the roof of the house. It made a terrible noise. The tiger thought that the stag was about to spring upon him and kill him. He made a leap for the door and ran out of it as fast as he could. He ran and ran until he was far, far away from the house with the roof of dried grass.  The stag thought that the tiger was about to spring upon him and kill him. He, too, made a leap for the door and ran and ran until he was far, far away from the house with the roof of dried grass. The tiger and the stag are still running away from each other until this very day.  The house with the roof of dried grass waited and waited there in the place which was neither too high nor too low, too near the river nor too far away, not under too thick trees nor out in the hot sun. It waited and waited until it go so tired it fell down in a heap.     VII  How the Speckled Hen Got  Her Speckles   Once upon a time, ages and ages ago, there was a little white hen. One day she was busily engaged in scratching the soil to find worms and insects for her breakfast. As she worked she sang over and over again her little crooning song, \"Quirrichi, quirrichi, quirrichi.\" Suddenly she noticed a tiny piece of paper lying on the ground. \"Quirrichi, quirrichi, what luck!\" she said to herself. \"This must be a letter. One time when the king, the great ruler of our country, held his court in the meadow close by, many people brought him letters and laid them at his feet. Now I, too, even I, the little white hen, have a letter. I am going to carry my letter to the king.\"  The next morning the little white hen started bravely out on her long journey. She carried the letter very carefully in her little brown basket. It was a long distance to the royal palace where the king lived. The little white hen had never been so far from home in all her life.  After a while she met a friendly fox. Foxes and little white hens are not usually very good friends, you know, but this fox was a friend of the little white hen. Once upon a time she had helped the fox to escape from a trap and the fox had never forgotten her kindness to him.  \"O, little white hen, where are you going?\" asked the fox.  \"Quirrichi, quirrichi,\" replied the little white hen, \"I am going to the royal palace to carry a letter to the king.\"  \"Indeed, little white hen,\" said the fox, \"I should like to go with you. Give me your permission to accompany you on your journey.\"  \"I shall be glad to have you go with me,\" said the little white hen. \"It is a very long journey to the royal palace where the king lives. Wouldn't you like me to carry you in my little brown basket?\"  The fox climbed into the little brown basket. After the little white hen had gone on for some distance farther she met a river. Once upon a time the little white hen had done the river a kindness. He had, with great difficulty, thrown some ugly worms upon the bank and he was"]]]
