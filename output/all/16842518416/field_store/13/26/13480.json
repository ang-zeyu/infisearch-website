I persuaded him to allow me to have them printed, as I thought they were suggestive and useful. He has however desired me to say that they should not be regarded as anything but concise memoranda jotted down (at short intervals between the busy hours of his official life) as general answers to questions put to him. They contain some passages which are too concise or abstract, if not vague or enigmatic. But, the author says, he left them designedly so in order to induce his readers to try to understand them or at least to seek explanation and illustration. Numerous foot-notes have been added for the same purpose.  He frankly admits that his view of Islam is neither quite orthodox nor quite heterodox but something midway between the two. It was put forward in order to make his boys think for themselves and argue with him. The first three Notes may be 'skipped' at the first reading.  Sincere acknowledgments are due to Nawab Imad-ul-Mulk Bahadur Bilgrami, C.S.I., Mr. J.C. Molony, I.C.S., Khan Bahadur Abdur Rahim, B.A., B.L., Mr. Syed Ross Masood, M.A., and others who very kindly read the proofs and favoured the author with valuable suggestions.

Amen.     Grant that the knowledge I get may be the   knowledge worth having.--_Thomas a Kempis._     NOTES ON ISLAM   +Note 1.+  _Introduction._   Two of you--Lateef and Altaf--will recollect that more than a year ago you wrote to me saying that you were puzzled by certain questions which a Missionary had put to you. I remember that Amjud or Mahmood even went so far as to ask what was the good of Islam, when countries and people professing that faith had weak governments and were crumbling to pieces under the influence of Christian Powers.[2] I answered your queries only in a general way as your University education had not then advanced far enough. But I think the time has now come when I should try to explain to you what I conceive to be the true spirit of the religion of our fore-fathers.  I firmly believe that Islam is the best[3] religion in the world--I mean, Islam rightly understood and interpreted and _not_ the Muhammadanism[4] of some of our formularist Maulavies,[5] who say that a man goes to Hell or Heaven according as he wears his trousers lower or higher than his ankles! They have degraded our religion by paying undue attention to formulas and forms to the exclusion and neglect of its living spirit and reality[6]. The poet Hafiz rightly stigmatised their vain controversies when he said that [Persian: Chon nadiden haghighat afsaneh zadend] \"since they did not see the fact, they ran after fiction.\"  I am more than ever convinced of two characteristics of Islam:--  _1st._--It is not inconsistent with _true_ Christianity, or with any other _true_ religion[7] of which the fundamental principle is [Arabic: Tawhid] One God [Arabic: waḥdahū la šarīka lahū] \"the Peerless One.\"[8]  _2nd._--It conforms to modern scientific ideas better than any other religion.  I have already explained, in some of my letters[9] to you, why I believe that Islam is but a continuation and consummation of Christianity as taught by Jesus himself in _his own speeches_ which are reported in the Synoptic Gospels of the New Testament. We have nothing to do with the interpretation of his words by his Apostles and others after them. If we take the plain words and the plain meaning of those words reported to have proceeded from his own blessed mouth,[10] we clearly see that they teach the same sublime truths as our Prophet himself inculcated. Jesus did not live long to complete his mission, Muhammad completed it. Both were God's holy messengers [Arabic: Rusul-u-llah]. Says the Qur'an: \"This day I have completed your religion for you.\" [Arabic: l-yawma ʾakmaltu lakum dīnakum]  I need not now go into details, or refer to other religions, to shew that the spirit of Islam is not inconsistent with their true spirit, if rightly conceived and interpreted in the light of modern science. I hope I shall be able some day to write down the result of my own thought and investigation in the matter. I content myself at present with drawing your attention to the first characteristic of Islam, and I propose to write a few Notes to draw your special attention to its second characteristic which is the more remarkable--the characteristic that it is quite consistent with modern ideas of science.  No scientific idea influenced the thought of the last century more profoundly than the idea of progress or development embodied in what is called the Law of Evolution. It is now widely accepted. You will be surprised to know that many an Islamic tenet is entirely in accord with it. Indeed Maulana Rumi outlined it poetically in his famous _Masnavi_ in the thirteenth century, in the same manner as Lord Tennyson did in his _Princess_ in the nineteenth. I desire that you should try to understand it in its modern form. I strongly recommend that you should read an admirable book by Edward Clodd called _The Story of Creation_[11]. When I first read it, some years ago, I felt it was as pleasant and interesting as a novel. Its introduction and Part II are quite easy to read. They will give you a very good idea of the great revolution which Darwin and Wallace, Huxley and Spencer have wrought in the thought of our own times.     +Note 2.+  _The First Chapter of the Qur'an._   The following is a translation of the \"Opening Chapter\" of our Holy Qur'an. I have analysed it by placing Roman and Arabic numerals, the first indicating verses [Arabic: ayyat] and the second indicating sub-divisions of verses.      _Opening Chapter._         +[Arabic: Sura al-fātiḥa]+    In the Name of God the      [Arabic: bi-smi llāhi r-raḥmāni r-raḥīm]   Compassionate, the   Merciful.

II.                                                           .II    (1) Thee only do we         [Arabic: ʾiyyāka naʿbudu (1)]       worship,    (2) and Thee only do        [Arabic: wa-ʾiyyāka nastaʿīn (2)]       we ask for aid.    (3) Guide us in the         [Arabic: ihdinā ṣ-ṣirāṭa l-mustaqīm (3)]       right Path (that is)  III. the Path of those        [Arabic: ṣirāṭa llaḏīna]       .III    (1) to whom Thou            [Arabic: ʾanʿamta ʿalayhim (1)]       art gracious,    (2) who are not objects     [Arabic: ġayri l-maġḍūbi ʿalayhim (2)]       of wrath,    (3) and who go not          [Arabic: wa-lā ḍ-ḍāllīn (3)]       astray.        _Amen_[12]              [Arabic: āmīn]   The whole Sura divides itself into three parts and each part into three divisions thus:--  Part I.--_Nature of God_.  Three principal attributes of God:--    (1) Creator or Nourisher    [Arabic: Rab]   (2) Protector               [Arabic: raḥmāni wa r-raḥīm]   (3) Adjuster                [Arabic: māliki yawmi d-dīn]   Part II.--_Man's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25254"],["title","Notes on Islam (#1)"],["body","to God_ lies in,    (1) Worship                 [Arabic: ʿibādat]   (2) Seeking His Protection  [Arabic: Isti'anāt]   (3) Seeking His Guidance    [Arabic: Istihdā]  Part III.--_The Straight Path_ [Arabic: islām = madhab] _for Man_   being:--    (1) the path of Grace (= path of those who         obtain Grace)    (2) not the Path of Sin (=path of those         who deliberately go wrong).    (3) nor the Path of Error (=path of those         who by mistake go astray).  Observe:--    (_a_) Each of the three duties in the second part   corresponds with the three attributes mentioned in the   first part.    (_b_) The third part, the Path of Grace, _i.e._, the   straight path, is _the mean between two extremes_--the   path of deliberate sinners on the one hand and the path of   unwitting stragglers on the other.    (_c_) The Islamic prayer is simpler than the Christian   prayer. I do not say the one is good and the other is bad.   No; _both_ are _very_ good indeed, but the one _seems   simpler_ than the other. Compare them.   _The Christian Prayer._           _The Muslim Prayer._   THE LORD'S PRAYER.

And forgive us our         path--the path of those       debts as we forgive our           to whom Thou hast       debtors.                          been gracious,       And lead us not into              not the path of those       temptation, but deliver           who are the objects       us from evil: for Thine           of wrath nor of those       is the Kingdom, and the           who have gone astray.       power, and the glory for          Amen.       ever. Amen.  _St. Matthew_, vi 9-13.               _The Qur'an_, i.   If you will carefully compare the parts of each Prayer which I have written as separate paragraphs marked (_a_), (_b_) and (_c_), you will observe that there is difference only in the language, but no difference whatever in the real meaning. There is in both Prayers absolutely the same spirit of    (_a_) Adoration,    (_b_) Submission, and    (_c_) Supplication.  Both begin with the _praise_ of the Lord to whom all praise is due. This is followed in both by an expression of our _entire dependence_ on Him and submission to His will. Lastly, there is _solicitation for guidance_, positive and negative, _viz._, guidance towards right action and guidance for avoiding temptation.  The three parts (_a_), (_b_) and (_c_) of the Christian as well as of the Muslim Prayer are in perfect accord with the results of a comparative study of the religious systems of the world. They correspond to three essential elements in _all_ religions, _viz._,    (_a_) _Belief_ in the existence of a Supreme Power which           is Infinite and Absolute,    (_b_) _Feeling_ of man's entire dependence on that Power,            and    (_c_) _Desire_ to seek or solicit guidance of that Power            in the daily life of man.  You will thus see that both the Lord's Prayer in the Bible and the Opening Chapter of the Qur'an go to the roots of all religions ever professed by man. They are truly Universal Prayers. No man need hesitate to join in the solemn recitation of either.  We ought to view all monotheistic religions--religions which enjoin belief in one God--in the spirit in which St. Peter viewed them when he said (_Acts_ x. 34-5): \"Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons, but in every nation he that feareth Him and worketh righteousness is accepted with Him.\" The same is the spirit of the oft-repeated definition of 'Muslims' in the Qur'an: [Arabic: llaḏīna ʾāmanū minkum wa-ʿamilū ṣ-ṣāliḥāt] \"those who believe and work righteousness.\" \"Trust in the Lord and do good,\" as the psalm says.     +Note 3.+  I.--_What is Religion?_   I have said that _true_ Islam is the _best_ religion in the world. I must prove my assertion. In order to do so I have to explain:--    I. What do I mean by religion?  II. What is true Islam? III. Why is it the best religion?  I.--_Religion, God and Nature._  _Religion._--No thinking man can help asking himself the questions: \"Whence has this world come? Whither is it bound to go?\" in other words, \"What was the _origin_ ([Arabic: mabdā]) and what will be the _end_ ([Arabic: ma'ād]) of the world of men, animals, plants and things that I perceive?\" The answers which each man gives to these questions constitute his _religion_. A few earnest persons (poets, philosophers and theologians) try to answer these questions for themselves by patient study and earnest thought[13]. But a large majority of men and women merely take the answers taught them by their parents, teachers or priests. There may possibly be a small number of men who do not trouble themselves about these questions. These are not \"thinking men\" and may therefore be left out of account.  Religion is a silent and subtle power that works in the heart of man and makes for righteousness. It is generated by his conviction as to the beginning and end of himself and the world in which he lives and moves[14].  _God._--No intelligent and intelligible answers can be given to questions as to the origin and the end or the government of _Nature_[15] without assuming the existence of the _One and only one God_ who is _Infinite_ and _Absolute_, _i.e._, One who hath neither beginning nor end and who is not conditioned or limited by anything whatever[16]. The Infinite and Absolute One has been called by different names by different people at different times[17]. Yezdan, Ishwara, Jehovah, God, and Allah are the names, in different languages, of the same _Infinite and Absolute God_.    God of the Granite and the Rose     Soul of the Sparrow and the Bee!   The mighty tide of being flows     Through countless channels, Lord, from Thee.  *_Conceptions of God, His attributes, and His relation to Nature._--These have been and will ever be many and various. But I summarise three principal conceptions under each head, for I believe that other ideas, notions or conceptions are but combinations of two or more of these:--   I. Conceptions of God:--    1. God as the Ultimate _Law_.   2. God as the Omnipotent Energy or _Power_.   3. God as the Supreme Being or _Person[18]_.  II. Notions of God's principal attributes:--    1. God as Creator or Nourisher.   2. God as Preserver or Protector.   3. God as Adjuster or Judge[18].  [*] _Paragraphs marked with asterisks and their footnotes may be        omitted at the first reading._   III. Ideas of God's relation with Nature[20] (_i.e._, with the world of men, animals, plants and other objects, and their inter-relations, of which men are aware):--    1. All is _from_ God = God is _above_ Nature                          which He created and                          governs (Theism).    2. God is _in_ All   = God is _in_ Nature although                          Nature is not                          God (Panentheism).    3. God _is_ All      = God _is_ Nature and                          Nature is God (Pantheism)[21].  * The above is but a rough summary. I have neither time nor space to explain and illustrate it. I have ventured to give some hints--imperfect hints, I fear--in the footnotes. I may however state here that, of the above three conceptions, notions or ideas Islam accepts the medium or the middle one which, as a little thought will show, includes the other two conceptions also. You need not at present try to understand the summary or the words given in brackets. My subsequent Notes will explain it to some extent. Please remember that there are many men and many minds, and that there are likely to be as many religions, as many conceptions of God, as many notions of His attributes, and as many ideas of the beginning or end of things, ([Arabic: mabdā' wa ma'ād]) as there are _thinking_ minds[22].   Let me conclude this Note with a short answer to the question why religion is necessary to Man[23]. No society is possible without religion, because of the dual nature of Man. As our poet says, [Persian: ba bahaa'm bahra dari ba malaa'ik neez ham] and as all modern men of science (such as Sir Oliver Lodge and others) admit, there is a higher and a lower in every man's nature, the one lifts him up and the other pulls him down in the scale of animal and social existence. Religion is necessary in order that every man's higher nature may conquer his lower nature in order that he may become a social being who is virtuous and does good of his own accord, and may not remain a mere beast whom the whip alone prevents from doing mischief. It is religion that fosters high-thinking and holy-living, so necessary for the advancement of the human race.     +Note 4.+  II.--_What is true Islam?_   The answer to this question is contained within the four corners, as it were, of the Opening Sura[24] [Arabic: Sura al-fātiḥa] which is a general summary of the whole Qur'an. I have already analysed it and asked you to compare it with the Christian prayer called the Lord's prayer. I am sure you have noted and admired its simplicity and clearness and its almost scientific precision and comprehensiveness. I am only amplifying what I have already said when I say that the Sura teaches three cardinal and eternal truths:--  _1st._--There is but One God who has created the worlds, maintains them, and rules them. In the inimitable words of the Sura of Purity.                                         [Arabic:"]]]
