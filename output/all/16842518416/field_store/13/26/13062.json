The little white hen had eaten them for him. Always after that the river had been her friend.  \"O, little white hen, where are you going?\" the river called out as soon as he saw her.  \"Quirrichi, quirrichi, I am going to the royal palace to carry a letter to the king,\" replied the little white hen.  \"O, little white hen, may I go with you?\" asked the river.  The little white hen told the river that he might go with her and asked him to ride in the little brown basket. So the river climbed into the little brown basket.  After the little white hen had journeyed along for a time she came to a fire. Once upon a time, when the fire had been dying the little white hen had brought some dried grass. The grass had given the fire new life and always after that he had been the friend of the little white hen.  \"O, little white hen, where are you going?\" the fire asked.  \"Quirrichi, quirrichi, I am going to the royal palace to carry a letter to the king,\" replied the little white hen.  \"O, little white hen, may I go with you?\" asked the fire. \"I have never been to the royal palace and I have never had even a peep at the king.\"  The little white hen told the fire that he might go with her and asked him to climb into the little brown basket. By this time the little brown basket was so full, that, try as they might, they couldn't make room for the fire. At last they thought of a plan. The fire changed himself into ashes and then there was room for him to get into the basket.  The little white hen journeyed on and on, and finally she arrived at the royal palace.  \"Who are you and what are you carrying in your little brown basket?\" asked the royal doorkeeper when he opened the door.  \"I am the little white hen and I am carrying a letter to the king,\" replied the little white hen. She didn't say a word about the fox and the river and the fire which she had in her little brown basket. She was so frightened before the great royal doorkeeper of the palace that she could hardly find her voice at all.  The royal doorkeeper invited the little white hen to enter the palace and he led her to the royal throne where the king was sitting. The little white hen bowed very low before the king--so low, in fact, that it mussed up all her feathers.  \"Who are you and what is your business?\" asked the king in his big, deep, kingly voice.  \"Quirrichi, quirrichi, I am the little white hen,\" replied the little white hen in her low, frightened, little voice. \"I have come to bring my letter to your royal majesty.\" She handed the king the piece of paper which had remained all this time at the bottom of the little brown basket. There were marks of dirt upon it where the friendly fox's feet had rested. It was damp where the river had lain. It had tiny holes in it where the fire had sat after he had turned himself into hot ashes.  \"What do you mean by bringing me this dirty piece of paper?\" shouted the king in his biggest, deepest, gruffest voice. \"I am highly offended. I always knew that hens were stupid little creatures but you are quite the stupidest little hen I ever saw in all my life.\"  \"Here,\" and he turned to one of the attendants standing by the throne, \"take this stupid, little white hen and throw her out into the royal poultry yard. I think we will have her for dinner to-morrow.\"  The little white hen was roughly seized by the tallest royal attendant and carried down the back stairs, through the back gate, out into the royal poultry yard. She still clung to the little brown basket which she had brought with her on her long journey to the royal palace and through all the sad experiences she had met there.  When the little white hen reached the royal poultry yard all the royal fowls flew at her. Some plucked at her rumpled white feathers. Others tried to pick out her eyes. One pulled off the cover of the little brown basket.  Out sprang the fox from the little brown basket and in the twinkling of an eye he fell upon the fowls of the royal poultry yard. Not a single fowl was left alive.  There was such a great commotion that the king, the queen, the royal attendants and all the royal servants of the palace came rushing out to see what was the matter. The fox had already taken to his heels and the little white hen lost no time in running away too. She did not, however, forget to take her little brown basket with her.  The royal household all ran after her in swift pursuit. They had almost caught her when the river suddenly sprang out of the little brown basket and flowed between the little white hen and her royal pursuers. They couldn't get across without canoes.  While they were getting the canoes and climbing into them the little white hen had time to run a long way. She had almost reached a thick forest where she could easily hide herself when the royal pursuers again drew near. Then the fire which had changed itself into hot ashes jumped out of the little brown basket. It immediately became dark, so dark that the royal household could not even see each other's faces and, of course, they could not see in which direction the little white hen was running. There was nothing for them to do but to return to the royal palace and live on beef and mutton.  The fire which had turned itself into ashes sprang out of the little brown basket so suddenly that it scattered ashes all over the little white hen. From that day she was always speckled where the ashes fell upon her. The chickens of the little white hen (who was now a little speckled hen) were all speckled too. So were their chickens and their chickens and their chickens' chickens, even down to this very day. Whenever you see a speckled hen you may know that she is descended from the little white hen who carried a letter to the king, and who, in her adventures, became the first speckled hen.     VIII  How the Monkey Became a  Trickster   Once upon a time there was a beautiful garden in which grew all sorts of fruits. Many beasts lived in the garden and they were permitted to eat of the fruits whenever they wished. But they were asked to observe one rule. They must make a low, polite bow to the fruit tree, call it by its name, and say, \"Please give me a taste of your fruit.\" They had to be very careful to remember the tree's correct name and not to forget to say \"please.\" It was also very important that they should remember not to be greedy. They must always leave plenty of fruit for the other beasts who might pass that way, and plenty to adorn the tree itself and to furnish seed so that other trees might grow. If they wished to eat figs they had to say, \"O, fig tree, O, fig tree, please give me a taste of your fruit;\" or, if they wished to eat oranges they had to say, \"O, orange tree, O, orange tree, please give me a taste of your fruit.\"  In one corner of the garden grew the most splendid tree of all. It was tall and beautiful and the rosy-cheeked fruit upon its wide spreading branches looked wonderfully tempting. No beast had ever tasted of that fruit, for no beast could ever remember its name.  In a tiny house near the edge of the garden dwelt a little old woman who knew the names of all the fruit trees which grew in the garden. The beasts often went to her and asked the name of the wonderful fruit tree, but the tree was so far distant from the tiny house of the little old woman that no beast could ever remember the long, hard name by the time he reached the fruit tree.  At last the monkey thought of a trick. Perhaps you do not know it, but the monkey can play the guitar. He always played when the beasts gathered together in the garden to dance. The monkey went to the tiny house of the little old woman, carrying his guitar under his arm. When she told him the long hard name of the wonderful fruit tree he made up a little tune to it, all his own, and sang it over and over again all the way from the tiny house of the little old woman to the corner of the garden where the wonderful fruit tree grew. When any of the other beasts met him and asked him what new song he was singing to his guitar, he said never a word. He marched straight on, playing his little tune over and over again on his guitar and singing softly the long hard name.  At last he reached the corner of the garden where the wonderful fruit tree grew. He had never seen it look so beautiful. The rosy-cheeked fruit glowed in the bright sunlight. The monkey could hardly wait to make his bow, say the long hard name over twice and ask for the fruit with a \"please.\" What a beautiful colour and what a delicious odour that fruit had! The monkey had never in all his life been so near to anything which smelled so good. He took a big bite. What a face he made! That beautiful sweet smelling fruit was bitter and sour, and it had a nasty taste. He threw it away from him as far as he could.  The monkey never forgot the tree's long hard name and the little tune he had sung. Nor did he forget how the fruit tasted. He never took a bite of it again; but, after that, his favourite trick was to treat the other beasts to the wonderful fruit just to see them make faces when they tasted it.     IX  How the Monkey and the Goat  Earned Their Reputations   Once upon a time the tiger sent an invitation to the goat asking the goat to accompany him on a visit. The goat promptly accepted the invitation and at the appointed day they started on their journey to the house of the tiger's friend. On the way there they came to a dangerous marsh. The tiger was afraid to cross it, but he pretended to be very brave. He said to the goat: \"Friend Goat, how very pale you look when you think about crossing the marsh. Don't be afraid. Just go ahead.\"  The goat assured the tiger that he was no coward. He thrust out his chest and marched along toward the marsh like a brave soldier. As soon, however, as he stepped into the marsh, he fell into the mud and barely got through it alive. The tiger went around the marsh and walked on dry ground.  After the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24714"],["title","Fairy Tales from Brazil: How and Why Tales from Brazilian Folk-Lore (#5)"],["body","and the goat had come together again they came to some banana trees. The tiger said to the goat: \"Friend Goat, aren't you hungry? Let us stop here and eat some bananas. You climb up and pluck the bananas. Give me the ripe ones, and keep the green ones yourself.\" The goat climbed up and picked the bananas. He gave the ripe ones to the tiger and the tiger had a good meal. The goat went hungry.  The tiger and the goat walked along and after going for some distance they saw a cobra lying in the path. \"Friend Goat,\" said the tiger, \"here you have the opportunity to procure a beautiful necklace for your daughter, free of cost. Just pick it up and it is yours.\" The goat started forward to pick up the snake, but the tiger told him to let it alone if he did not want to be killed.  When the tiger and the goat arrived at the house of the tiger's friend it was very late. They soon went to bed in hammocks hung close together. At midnight the tiger rose quietly, walked on tip toe to the door, opened it, and went out. He hurried to the place where the sheep were kept, killed the fattest lamb of the flock, and had a feast. Then he went back to the hammock, wiped the blood on the goat, and went to sleep.  Early the next morning the host discovered that one of his lambs was missing. He hastened to the room where the tiger and the goat were sleeping and accused the tiger of having killed the lamb. The tiger looked up at him with an innocent expression and asked, \"Do you see any blood on me?\" There was no blood on the tiger, but the host looked into the next hammock and saw the goat all covered with blood. \"I know now who killed my fattest lamb,\" he said, and he gave the goat such a beating that the poor goat barely escaped with his life. From that day to this when one speaks of a person who has been easily imposed upon he calls him \"the goat.\"  Things happened very differently with the monkey. One day not long afterward the tiger invited the monkey to accompany him when he went to visit his friend. The monkey accepted, and the tiger and the monkey set out on the journey. When they came to the marsh the tiger said to the monkey, \"Friend Monkey, how very pale you look when you think about crossing the marsh. Don't be afraid. Just go ahead.\"  \"You go ahead yourself,\" replied the monkey. The tiger went through the marsh and fell into the mud so that he was barely able to get out again. The monkey went around the marsh and walked on dry ground.  After a while the tiger and the monkey came to the banana trees. \"Friend Monkey,\" said the tiger, \"aren't you hungry? Let us stop here and eat some bananas. You climb up and pluck the bananas. Give the ripe ones to me and you may keep the green ones for yourself.\" The monkey climbed up and picked the bananas but he ate all the ripe ones himself and threw the green ones down to the tiger. The tiger was forced to go hungry but the monkey had a good meal.  Finally the tiger and the monkey came to a cobra lying in the path. \"Friend Monkey,\" said the tiger, \"here you have the opportunity to procure a beautiful necklace for your daughter, free of cost. Pick it up and it is yours.\"  \"Pick it up yourself,\" replied the monkey.  When the tiger and the monkey arrived at the house of the tiger's friend it was very late. They went to bed in hammocks hung up close together. The monkey had seen enough of the tiger that day to make him decide that he had better sleep with one eye open. Accordingly he pretended he was asleep, but he was really awake. At midnight he saw the tiger crawl quietly out of his hammock, walk on tip toe to the door, open it gently, and go out. The monkey decided to watch and see what happened when the tiger came back.  The tiger went to the place where the sheep were kept, killed the fattest lamb of the flock and had a feast. When he came back he tried to wipe the lamb's blood on the monkey. The monkey saw him and gave him a push so that he spilled the blood all over himself and his own hammock. Not a single drop went on the monkey.  Early the next morning when the host missed one of his lambs he came to the room where his guests were sleeping. He saw the tiger all covered with blood and he cried, \"O ho, I have at last caught the one who kills my lambs.\" Then he gave the tiger such a beating that he barely escaped with his life. It was all he could do to crawl home again.     X  How the Monkey Got a Drink  When He Was Thirsty   Once upon a time the monkey made the tiger very angry. This is how it happened. The monkey was seated high up among the leafy branches of a mango tree playing upon his guitar. The tiger passed that way and lay down under the tree to rest. Just to tease him the monkey played and sang this little song:      \"_Tango ti tar, tango ti tar,     The tiger's bones are in my guitar.     Tee hee, Tee hee._\"  The tiger was very angry. \"Just wait until I catch you, Mr. Monkey,\" he said. \"Then I'll show you a trick or two with bones.\"  The monkey leaped from one tree to another keeping himself so well hid by the foliage that the tiger could not see him. Then he came down out of the trees and hid himself in a hole in the ground. When the tiger came near he again played and sang his little song:      \"_Tango ti tar, tango ti tar,     The tiger's bones are in my guitar.     Tee hee, Tee hee._\"  The tiger put his paw into the hole and caught the monkey's leg. \"Oh, ho, Mr. Tiger!\" said the monkey. \"You think that you have caught my leg but what you really have is just a little stick. Oh, ho! Oh, ho!\" Then the tiger let go of the monkey's leg.  The monkey crawled farther back into the hole in the ground where the tiger's paw could not reach him. Then he said: \"Thank you so much, Mr. Tiger, for letting go of my leg. It really was my leg, you know.\" Again he played and sang his little song:      \"_Tango ti tar, tango ti tar,     The tiger's bones are in my guitar.     Tee hee, Tee hee._\"  The tiger was angrier than ever. He waited and waited for the monkey to come out of the hole in the ground but the monkey did not come. He had discovered another way out and once more from the high tree tops he sang down to the waiting tiger:      \"_Tango ti tar, tango ti tar,     The tiger's bones are in my guitar.     Tee hee, Tee hee._\"  There had been a great drought in the land and there was only one watering place where the beasts could drink. The tiger knew that the monkey would have to go there when he was thirsty so he decided to wait for him and catch him when he came to drink.  When the monkey went to the watering place to get a drink he found the tiger there waiting for him. He ran away as fast as the wind for he was really very much afraid of the tiger.  He waited and waited until he thought he should die of thirst, but the tiger did not go away from the watering place for a single minute. At last the monkey thought of a trick by which he would be able to get a drink.  He lay down by the side of the pathway as if he were dead. After a while an old woman came along the path carrying a dish of honey in a basket upon her head. She saw the monkey lying there by the path and, thinking that he was dead, she picked him up and put him into the basket with the dish of honey. When the monkey saw that it was honey in the dish he was very happy. He opened the dish and covered himself all over with the soft sticky honey. Then as the old woman walked under the trees he lightly sprang out of the basket into the trees. The old woman did not miss him until she got home and found only part of her dish of honey in the basket. \"Why, I thought I had brought home a dead monkey in my basket,\" she said to her children. \"Now there is no monkey here and my dish is only half full of honey. The monkey must have been playing one of his tricks.\"  The monkey had, in the meantime, stuck leaves from the trees into the honey all over his body so that he was completely disguised. His own mother would never have recognised him. He looked something like a porcupine; but instead of sharp quills there were green leaves sticking out all over him. In this fashion he went to the drinking place and the tiger did not recognise him. He took a long, deep drink. He was so thirsty and the water tasted so good that he stayed in the drinking place too long. The leaves came out of the honey which had held them and the tiger saw that it was really the monkey. The monkey was barely able to escape.  He was so badly frightened that he waited and waited a long, long time before he again went to the drinking place. At last he got so thirsty that he couldn't wait any longer. He went to the resin tree and covered himself with resin. Then he stuck leaves into the resin and again went to the drinking place.  The tiger saw him, but as the tiger expected to see the leaves come off just as soon as the monkey got into the water, he thought he would wait and catch him in his bare skin. This time the leaves did not come off, for the resin held them fast and was not in the least affected by the water. The tiger thought that it was not the monkey and that he must have made a mistake. The monkey drank all he wished and then strolled away leisurely without the tiger's attacking him. He used the resin and leaves every time he wanted a drink after that. He kept up the trick until the rainy season arrived and he could find plenty of water in other places than the big drinking place.     XI  How the Monkey Got Food  When He Was Hungry   Once upon a time the monkey was hungry. He wanted to make some porridge, but he did not have any money to buy meal to make the porridge. So he went to the house of the hen to borrow some meal. The hen gave him some meal.  \"Come to my house to-morrow at one o'clock,\" he said to the hen, \"I'll pay back the meal then.\"  Then the monkey went to the house of the fox and said, \"O, friend fox, please lend me some meal. Come to my house to-morrow at two o'clock and I'll pay you then.\" The fox gave him some meal.  Then the"]]]
