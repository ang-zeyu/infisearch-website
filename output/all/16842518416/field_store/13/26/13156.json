Here, too, is a letter from Lieut.-Observer J. E. P. Harvey, an officer of the Bedfordshire Yeomanry, and attached to the Royal Flying Corps:      I met one of the pilots of the German machines that had attacked     us. He could speak English well and we shook hands after a most     thrilling fight. I had brought down his machine with my     machine-gun, and he had to land quite close to where I landed.     He had a bullet through his radiator and petrol tank, but     neither he nor his observer was touched. I met two German     officers that knew several people that I knew, and they were     most awfully kind to me. They gave me a very good dinner of     champagne and oysters, etc., and I was treated like an honoured     guest. I then came by train the next day to Mainz, where I was     confined in a room by myself for two days. I have now been moved     into a general room with eight other English officers, where we     sleep and eat. We are treated very well, and play hockey and     tennis in the prison yard.—(_News of the World_, February 27,     1916.)  Miss Colenso gives the following account, which appeared in the _Daily News_ of June 28, 1918:      A minister friend of mine told me the story of a young Scottish     boy of his acquaintance, now a military prisoner in Germany—I     forget for the moment in which camp. This boy received a letter     from home one day telling of his mother’s serious illness and     the doctor’s verdict that she could only live a few weeks. The     German Commandant, finding the boy in great distress, asked him     what was the matter, and on learning the cause of his grief,     said: “Would you like to go home to your mother?” The boy sprang     up, exclaiming indignantly, “How can you mock me when you know     it is impossible?” “But you shall go, my boy,” said the     commandant. “I will pay your return fare on condition that you     give me your word of honour to come back here.” The boy went     home to Scotland and remained by his mother’s side for about     three weeks till her death, when, true to his word, he returned     to Germany.  The writer of “Under the Clock” considers that “well-attested” stories of this kind should be given publicity. It is even more necessary to examine the “attestation” of the other kinds of stories, for all the bias is against the enemy, and demand is apt to create supply.   MERSEBURG, DŒBERITZ.  I pass on now to a report made by a United States Official. The American Consul writes from Leipzig under date of November 16, 1914: “On Saturday afternoon, the 14th instant, I visited the military concentration camp near Merseburg, where some 10,000 prisoners of war are interned. The object of my visit was to investigate the claim of a French prisoner that he is an American subject. The result of my observations regarding the welfare and humane treatment of the prisoners at large was a surprise to me.... Separated by nationality, these prisoners are housed in wooden buildings, well built, ventilated and heated.... They sleep upon straw mattresses in well-warmed quarters, and, as far as I could judge, are as well or better housed than labourers upon public works in the United States. The prisoners are fed three times a day. Breakfast consists of coffee and bread. Dinner consists of vegetable and meat, soup and bread, and for supper they are given bread and coffee. I was informed that many of the prisoners have some money, and that they are allowed to buy whatever else they may wish to eat. If I may judge from the mounds of empty beer bottles at hand, there is evidence in support of this statement. The prisoners appeared to be in good health and cheerful, many of them engaging in games and other pastimes.”  The diet described must be frightfully monotonous. Feeding has throughout been one of the German difficulties. “Germany claims to hold 433,000 prisoners of war,” wrote an anonymous American journalist (probably in November, 1914); “the housing and feeding of so great a number must be a tremendous strain upon resources drained by the necessities of war.” The numbers must now exceed two million. The Press article referred to [Misc. No. 7 (1915)] is severe on the misery of camp life, and the verminousness of the men (they were of mixed nationality) in the camp at Döberitz which he visited. (See, however, the further official reports quoted below at p. 9). But the writer does not confine his condemnation to one side. “One hears of battles in which no quarter is granted. There are stories of one side or the other refusing an armistice to permit the other to gather its wounded. Each side is desperately determined to win, and neither is counting the cost. So men must rust in prison camps until the struggle is over.” The monotony in this case seems to have been varied by fights between the prisoners of different nationality, each set considering that the others had not done their part in the war. We need not be contemptuous about that. The monotony of the prisoners’ life must tend to produce the maximum degree of mutual friction. There is absolutely no privacy for the prisoner of war. To be forced to remain, day and night, for months and years in idleness, with a crowd of others, not of one’s own choice is, I believe, one of the psychological factors which make internment (especially to many civilians) decidedly worse than imprisonment in a criminal prison.   CORRESPONDENCE AND PACKAGES.  My next document illustrates the fact that each side makes similar complaints about the other. Telegram received by American Embassy, London, December 23, 1914, 22nd from Berlin Embassy:      “Foreign Office reports receiving many complaints that money and     packages sent German military and civilian prisoners in enemy     countries from Germany do not reach addresses. Please secure     information for Department to forward German Foreign Office     whether money and other postal matter will be delivered to such     prisoners promptly and intact.—BRYAN, Washington.”  There is no doubt that many letters and parcels have _not_ reached German prisoners in England. Lord Robert Cecil has fully allowed this. (_Times_ report. March 11, 1915.) In spite of this, I have no doubt that the British authorities have done their best to expedite delivery. I would suggest that this is probably the case on the other side, too. We shall indeed later come upon some definite statements in support of this view. One frequent cause of the non-arrival of parcels in Germany has been convincingly described by Mr. Ian Malcolm, M.P. (_Daily Mail_, November 8, 1916, and Reprint):      I did not approach this subject quite “new to the game.” I had     already visited general post offices in England, Switzerland and     elsewhere, and had seen thousands, literally thousands, of food     parcels intended for our prisoners of war in Germany falling to     bits and incapable of being forwarded for want of skilled     packing. The sight was enough to make angels weep. To think that     so much self-sacrifice had been exercised in humble homes to     save up bits of dripping, crusts of bread, broken cigarettes,     and what not, in order that these should reach son or brother or     sweetheart in Germany, yet packed so badly albeit by loving     hands, that in the first rough and tumble of the post the paper     burst, the string came undone, and the contents of a dozen     parcels fell in an inextricable jumble upon the floor.  There will unfortunately, too, be those in every land who will take opportunities for mean thefts. We have all had experience of that during this war, and the following cutting from the _Daily News_ of October 5, 1915, may be given in illustration:      In a letter of thanks to the secretary of the committee of the     Elswick and Scotswood workmen, formed for the purpose of sending     comforts to the troops, Sir Ian Hamilton says:          I am extremely touched by the extraordinary generosity and         kindness of the Elswick and Scotswood workmen. I will take         great care to let our soldiers know to whom they are         indebted for this most handsome contribution. Pray heaven         the parcels will escape thieves and scoundrels who waylaid         some of the gifts, and will arrive in good condition.  If there are, alas, not a few men who will steal from their comrades, there are not likely to be fewer who will steal from their enemies.  Speaking generally, however, the delivery of parcels on both sides soon became commendably regular. The care shown on the German side is warmly praised by Captain Gilbert Nobbs, who remained quite able to appreciate good deeds even after enduring terrible hardships and hearing worse stories from others. The bad deeds of war, soldiers are able to judge better than civilians. In his book “Englishman, Kamerad,” Captain Nobbs writes:      I was very much impressed with the fair and systematic handling     of our parcels, letters and money; even letters and postcards     which arrived for me after I had been sent back to England, were     re-addressed and sent back. A remittance of five pounds which     arrived for me after I had left was even returned to me in     England, instead of being applied to the pressing need of the     German War Loan.—(_Daily News_, January 25, 1918.)  An acquaintance of my own, a lecturer in a technical school, spoke to me to the same effect. He told me, as an illustration, of a parcel sent to him which had become quite shattered in transit (p.p. 7). The Germans transferred the contents to a sack, and, as he said, the temptation to pilfer the sorely-needed foodstuffs must have been great. My informant also spoke of the very thorough inoculation against disease.   ALTDAMM.  On December 31, 1914, Mr. Damm reported to Mr. Gerard on the Camp at Altdamm "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24810"],["title","The Better Germany in War Time: Being Some Facts Towards Fellowship (#2)"],["body","Stettin. The general arrangement, he remarks, is the same as that of the camp at Stargard on which he had reported previously.  “It appears to me that every effort is being made to treat the prisoners of war as humanely as possible in the two camps I visited. Dry and warm shelter is provided, the food is simple and perhaps monotonous, but of good material and well prepared, sanitary arrangements are good, and the health of the men is carefully looked after.”   RUMOURS V. INSPECTION.  But the general inspection of all camps had not yet been agreed to by the German Government, and on February 23, 1915, Sir Edward Grey wrote to Mr. Page (the American Ambassador in London) complaining that no definite replies to his questions were forthcoming. “His Majesty’s Government,” he continues, “have only unofficial information and rumours on the subject to guide them, which they trust do not accurately represent the facts.” The “unofficial information and rumours” had, however, attained wide publicity, and obtained still more later.  The German authorities agreed on March 17, 1915, to general inspection of detention camps and consideration of complaints. The reports now to be cited were made after this date. [Misc. 11 (1915)]. I propose to give examples of almost all the earlier reports, for it was in the earlier stages of the war that there was most difficulty everywhere in providing accommodation for prisoners. We ought not to forget that the earliest reports on our own camps which the British Government have published begin with February, 1916.[2]   DŒBERITZ.  On March 31 Mr. Jackson reported on the camp at Döberitz, a large camp with between three and four thousand British prisoners. “So far as I could ascertain, British soldiers are called upon to do only their share in fatigue work.... So far as I could ascertain, after inquiry of a number of men, nothing was known as to the stopping of either incoming or outgoing correspondence.... The camp at Döberitz is in a healthy location, and the barracks are new and of a permanent character.... They are at least as good as those used by the Germans at present in the same neighbourhood. As was to be expected a number of men had individual grievances, but there were no general complaints, except with regard to the German character of the food—_and those were the exact counterparts of complaints made to me by German prisoners in England_.” I have italicised the last clause as it will surely, to a fair-minded man, seem a somewhat important one.  Mr. Lithgow Osborne visited the camp at the same time. He says:      Until two weeks ago the Russians and English were, in cases,     housed together—a source of complaint to the latter, more     especially on account of vermin. The races have now been     separated. The men all stated that they had the two blankets and     the other requisites provided in the German rules, and I heard     but one complaint about overcrowding. Most of the English and     French receive clothes from home. All the prisoners who do not,     are furnished from the camp supply; the men stated that this was     carried out according to the rules.      No complaints whatever were made regarding the Commandant, the     non-commissioned officers, or the general government of the     camp. The food was the source of the few real complaints that     could be heard, although at least half of the men spoken to     admitted that it was quite as good as could possibly be     expected.      The impression of the whole was excellent, and one received the     idea that everything that could reasonably be expected was done     for the men by the authorities in charge.   THREE POOR CAMPS.  Mr. Jackson’s reports on Burg bei Magdeburg, Magdeburg and Halle a/d Saale are the most unfavourable. They were all small officers’ camps, Burg containing 75, Magdeburg 30, Halle 50 British officers. There were a few orderlies at each camp.  The chief points are inadequate ventilation, inadequate service for officers and, in the first two, the fact that living rooms were used for all purposes, there being no special mess or recreation rooms. There seemed, however, to be no discrimination against the British.   GŒTTINGEN.  Mr. Page himself reports on Göttingen, where there were about 6,000 prisoners. “The Camp Commandant, Colonel Bogen, has done everything possible to make this a model camp, and he has accomplished a great work. The only complaint is as to the food, the quantity of which, of course, is not under the control of the Commandant, as he is limited to an expenditure of only 60 pfennigs (about 7d.) per day per man.  “Everything was in the most beautiful order. There was a very fine steam laundry and drying room, bath rooms, with hot and cold showers, and the closets, etc., are in a very good condition and scientifically built. There is running water and electricity in the camp. A French barrister of Arras, named Léon Paillet, who was working with the French Red Cross and who, for some reason or other, has been made a prisoner, has done marvellous work in organising libraries, etc.  “I am pleased to say that the professors and pastors in Göttingen have, from the first, taken an interest in this camp, and Professor Stange has done much in helping the lot of the prisoners. The Y.M.C.A. building, erected through the efforts of Mr. A. C. Harte, who for a number of years has been working with the Y.M.C.A. in India, will be a great help to the men in the camp.  “At the opening ceremonies there were speeches by Colonel Bogen, Mr. Harte, and Professor Stange, and then each speech was delivered in English and French by prisoners. These were followed by short speeches by French, English, and Belgian prisoners. Then came a concert by the camp orchestra and the camp singing society, followed by songs and recitations by various prisoners.”  Dr. Ohnesorg reported further on April 22. At that time there were 6,577 prisoners, of whom 1,586 were British. He warmly commends the steam laundry, the steam disinfecting plant, and the hospital. “A spirit of contentment pervaded the camp. The British prisoners were well clothed. I tasted the evening meal, consisting of a vegetable soup, which was very palatable and, I should say, nourishing.... The citizens of Göttingen have taken a great interest in the camp, and some of them, notably Professor Stange, of the University, have given a great deal of their time to the welfare of prisoners and the formation of classes for study amongst them.”   GERMAN HELP FOR PRISONERS.  The interest taken by prominent Germans in the welfare of prisoners of war is little recognised in this country. The Berlin Committee (of which more will be said later) has received considerable support. At the end of June, 1916, a meeting in support of its work was held at the house of Prince Lichnowsky, former Ambassador in London, who returned specially from the front to preside. The Bishop of Winchester, writing in the _Times_, tells us that many notable men and women were present, and that at the meeting a collection of 8,000 marks (about £400) was made.   COLOGNE.  Mr. Michelson visited in April, 1915, the three Cologne hospitals in which wounded British prisoners are lying. He reports as follows:      These institutions are so typical of large, modern, well ordered     hospitals that little need be said of their employment or     management. They are provided with all the machinery and     paraphernalia usual to surgical work on a large scale, contain     all standard and necessary conveniences and fittings, afford to     patients a maximum of protection in the matter of sanitation,     quiet and relief from preventable irritation, and are conducted     in a thoroughly scientific, professional and humane way.      The names of the 49 wounded British prisoners are hereunto     annexed. I personally spoke to every one of these men, and with     many of them I conversed privately and without being overheard.     With but one exception no English-speaking British prisoner had     any complaint to make, and a number of the British prisoners     eagerly expressed to me their appreciation for the care and     attention given them.      The physical condition of the Indians is particularly good. Only     21 deaths have occurred among the 1,000 wounded cared for in     hospital No. VI. since the war began, and the death rate in the     other two hospitals is correspondingly low. The physicians in     charge consider the rate to be somewhat remarkable in view of     the many grave injuries treated.      In closing I may say that there is no discrimination or     segregation among the patients and that certain French patients     with whom I spoke expressed, likewise, their appreciation for     the care and attention given them.   CREFELD.  At Crefeld Mr. Michelson visited the camp for interned officers. Of these interned 137 were British. The general statements of the Commandant “were afterwards independently confirmed by the one interned British medical officer, Captain Benjamin Johnson, who said that as a physician he had no complaints to make or improvements to suggest. He did, however, complain on the score of being held prisoner, but the Commandant and the German medical officer, and I with them, feel that the presence of a British medical officer in the barracks is desirable.  “The bath room which I saw has a floor space of about 1,500 square feet, one-half of which, drained in the centre, lies under some 20 shower nozzles. There are a couple of porcelain tubs in the other half, and in the centre there is a large stove. Hot and cold water is available. The British officers were enthusiastic in their praise of this room.  “As regards the sleeping rooms, wash rooms and latrines, and their equipment, the general German housing regulations are being fully complied with. I visited a great many sleeping rooms, and in none of them did I find overcrowding, uncleanliness, insufficient"]]]
