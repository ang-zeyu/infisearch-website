Little boys who won't do as they're told always get into trouble. Stop crying, now. I dare say if Bertie goes they'll send you some candy, or something.\"  But William John refused to be comforted. He cried himself to sleep that night, and when Bertie went in to see him next morning, he found him sitting up in bed with his eyes red and swollen and the faded quilt drawn up around his pinched face.  \"Well, William John, how are you?\"  \"I ain't any better,\" replied William John mournfully. \"I s'pose you'll have a great time tomorrow night, Bertie?\"  \"Oh, I'm not going since you can't,\" said Bertie cheerily. He thought this would comfort William John, but it had exactly the opposite effect. William John had cried until he could cry no more, but he turned around and sobbed.  \"There now!\" he said in tearless despair. \"That's just what I expected. I did s'pose if I couldn't go you would, and tell me about it. You're mean as mean can be.\"  \"Come now, William John, don't be so cross. I thought you'd rather have me home, but I'll go, if you want me to.\"  \"Honest, now?\"  \"Yes, honest. I'll go anywhere to please you. I must be off to the store now. Goodbye.\"  Thus committed, Bertie took his courage in both hands and went. The next evening at dusk found him standing at Doctor Forbes's door with a very violently beating heart. He was carefully dressed in his well-worn best suit and a neat white collar. The frosty air had crimsoned his cheeks and his hair was curling round his face.  Caroline opened the door and showed him into the parlour, where Edith and Amy were eagerly awaiting him.  \"Happy New Year, Bertie,\" cried Amy. \"And--but, why, where is William John?\"  \"He couldn't come,\" answered Bertie anxiously--he was afraid he might not be welcome without William John. \"He's real sick. He caught cold and has to stay in bed; but he wanted to come awful bad.\"  \"Oh, dear me! Poor William John!\" said Amy in a disappointed tone. But all further remarks were cut short by the entrance of Doctor Forbes.  \"How do you do?\" he said, giving Bertie's hand a hearty shake. \"But where is the other little fellow my girls were expecting?\"  Bertie patiently reaccounted for William John's non-appearance.  \"It's a bad time for colds,\" said the doctor, sitting down and attacking the fire. \"I dare say, though, you have to run so fast these days that a cold couldn't catch you. I suppose you'll soon be leaving Sampson's. He told me he didn't need you after the holiday season was over. What are you going at next? Have you anything in view?\"  Bertie shook his head sorrowfully.  \"No, sir; but,\" he added more cheerfully, \"I guess I'll find something if I hunt around lively. I almost always do.\"  He forgot his shyness; his face flushed hopefully, and he looked straight at the doctor with his bright, earnest eyes. The doctor poked the fire energetically and looked very wise. But just then the girls came up and carried Bertie off to display their holiday gifts. And there was a fur cap and a pair of mittens for him! He wondered whether he was dreaming.  \"And here's a picture-book for William John,\" said Amy, \"and there is a sled out in the kitchen for him. Oh, there's the dinner-bell. I'm awfully hungry. Papa says that is my 'normal condition,' but I don't know what that means.\"  As for that dinner--Bertie might sometimes have seen such a repast in delightful dreams, but certainly never out of them. It was a feast to be dated from.  When the plum pudding came on, the doctor, who had been notably silent, leaned back in his chair, placed his finger-tips together, and looked critically at Bertie.  \"So Mr. Sampson can't keep you?\"  Bertie's face sobered at once. He had almost forgotten his responsibilities.  \"No, sir. He says I'm too small for the heavy work.\"  \"Well, you are rather small--but no doubt you will grow. Boys have a queer habit of doing that. I think you know how to make yourself useful. I need a boy here to run errands and look after my horse. If you like, I'll try you. You can live here, and go to school. I sometimes hear of places for boys in my rounds, and the first good one that will suit you, I'll bespeak for you. How will that do?\"  \"Oh, sir, you are too good,\" said Bertie with a choke in his voice.  \"Well, that is settled,\" said the doctor genially. \"Come on Monday then. And perhaps we can do something for that other little chap, William, or John, or whatever his name is. Will you have some more pudding, Bertie?\"  \"No, thank you,\" said Bertie. Pudding, indeed! He could not have eaten another mouthful after such wonderful and unexpected good fortune.  After dinner they played games, and cracked nuts, and roasted apples, until the clock struck nine; then Bertie got up to go.  \"Off, are you?\" said the doctor, looking up from his paper. \"Well, I'll expect you on Monday, remember.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said Bertie happily. He was not likely to forget.  As he went out Amy came through the hall with a red sled.  \"Here is William John's present. I've tied all the other things on so that they can't fall off.\"  Edith was at the door-with a parcel. \"Here are some nuts and candies for William John,\" she said. \"And tell him we all wish him a 'Happy New Year.'\"  \"Thank you,\" said Bertie. \"I've had a splendid time. I'll tell William John. Goodnight.\"  He stepped out. It was frostier than ever. The snow crackled and snapped, the stars were keen and bright, but to Bertie, running down the street with William John's sled thumping merrily behind him, the world was aglow with rosy hope and promise. He was quite sure he could never forget this wonderful New Year.     Between the Hill and the Valley   It was one of the moist, pleasantly odorous nights of early spring. There was a chill in the evening air, but the grass was growing green in sheltered spots, and Jeffrey Miller had found purple-petalled violets and pink arbutus on the hill that day. Across a valley filled with beech and fir, there was a sunset afterglow, creamy yellow and pale red, with a new moon swung above it. It was a night for a man to walk alone and dream of his love, which was perhaps why Jeffrey Miller came so loiteringly across the springy hill pasture, with his hands full of the mayflowers.  He was a tall, broad-shouldered man of forty, and looking no younger, with dark grey eyes and a tanned, clean-cut face, clean-shaven save for a drooping moustache. Jeffrey Miller was considered a handsome man, and Bayside people had periodical fits of wondering why he had never married. They pitied him for the lonely life he must lead alone there at the Valley Farm, with only a deaf old housekeeper as a companion, for it did not occur to the Bayside people in general that a couple of shaggy dogs could be called companions, and they did not know that books make very excellent comrades for people who know how to treat them.  One of Jeffrey's dogs was with him now--the oldest one, with white breast and paws and a tawny coat. He was so old that he was half-blind and rather deaf, but, with one exception, he was the dearest of living creatures to Jeffrey Miller, for Sara Stuart had given him the sprawly, chubby little pup years ago.  They came down the hill together. A group of men were standing on the bridge in the hollow, discussing Colonel Stuart's funeral of the day before. Jeffrey caught Sara's name and paused on the outskirts of the group to listen. Sometimes he thought that if he were lying dead under six feet of turf and Sara Stuart's name were pronounced above him, his heart would give a bound of life.  \"Yes, the old kunnel's gone at last,\" Christopher Jackson was saying. \"He took his time dyin', that's sartain. Must be a kind of relief for Sara--she's had to wait on him, hand and foot, for years. But no doubt she'll feel pretty lonesome. Wonder what she'll do?\"  \"Is there any particular reason for her to do anything?\" asked Alec Churchill.  \"Well, she'll have to leave Pinehurst. The estate's entailed and goes to her cousin, Charles Stuart.\"  There were exclamations of surprise from the other men on hearing this. Jeffrey drew nearer, absently patting his dog's head. He had not known it either.  \"Oh, yes,\" said Christopher, enjoying all the importance of exclusive information. \"I thought everybody knew that. Pinehurst goes to the oldest male heir. The old kunnel felt it keen that he hadn't a son. Of course, there's plenty of money and Sara'll get that. But I guess she'll feel pretty bad at leaving her old home. Sara ain't as young as she used to be, neither. Let me see--she must be thirty-eight. Well, she's left pretty lonesome.\"  \"Maybe she'll stay on at Pinehurst,\" said Job Crowe. \"It'd only be right for her cousin to give her a home there.\"  Christopher shook his head.  \"No, I understand they're not on very good terms. Sara don't like Charles Stuart or his wife--and I don't blame her. She won't stay there, not likely. Probably she'll go and live in town. Strange she never married. She was reckoned handsome, and had plenty of beaus at one time.\"  Jeffrey swung out of the group and started homeward with his dog. To stand by and hear Sara Stuart discussed after this fashion was more than he could endure. The men idly watched his tall, erect figure as he went along the valley.  \"Queer chap, Jeff,\" said Alec Churchill reflectively.  \"Jeff's all right,\" said Christopher in a patronizing way. \"There ain't a better man or neighbour alive. I've lived next farm to him for thirty years, so I ought to know. But he's queer sartainly--not like other people--kind of unsociable. He don't care for a thing 'cept dogs and reading and mooning round woods and fields. That ain't natural, you know. But I must say he's a good farmer. He's got the best farm in Bayside, and that's a real nice house he put up on it. Ain't it an odd thing he never married? Never seemed to have no notion of it. I can't recollect of Jeff Miller's ever courting anybody. That's another unnatural thing about "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24877"],["title","Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1907 to 1908 (#0)"],["body","Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1907 to 1908   Lucy Maud Montgomery was born at Clifton (now New London), Prince Edward Island, Canada, on November 30, 1874.

It is all settled at last, and in another week I shall have left Thrush Hill. I am a little bit sorry and a great bit glad. I am going to Montreal to spend the winter with Alicia.  Alicia--it used to be plain Alice when she lived at Thrush Hill and made her own dresses and trimmed her own hats--is my half-sister. She is eight years older than I am. We are both orphans, and Aunt Elizabeth brought us up here at Thrush Hill, the most delightful old country place in the world, half smothered in big willows and poplars, every one of which I have climbed in the early tomboy days of gingham pinafores and sun-bonnets.  When Alicia was eighteen she married Roger Gresham, a man of forty. The world said that she married him for his money. I dare say she did. Alicia was tired of poverty.  I don't blame her. Very likely I shall do the same thing one of these days, if I get the chance--for I too am tired of poverty.  When Alicia went to Montreal she wanted to take me with her, but I wanted to be outdoors, romping in the hay or running wild in the woods with Jack.  Jack Willoughby--Dr. John H. Willoughby, it reads on his office door--was the son of our nearest neighbour. We were chums always, and when he went away to college I was heartbroken.  The vacations were the only joy of my life then.  I don't know just when I began to notice a change in Jack, but when he came home two years ago, a full-fledged M.D.--a great, tall, broad-shouldered fellow, with the sweetest moustache, and lovely thick black hair, just made for poking one's fingers through--I realized it to the full. Jack was grown up. The dear old days of bird-nesting and nutting and coasting and fishing and general delightful goings-on were over forever.  I was sorry at first. I wanted \"Jack.\" \"Dr. Willoughby\" seemed too distinguished and far away.  I suppose he found a change in me, too. I had put on long skirts and wore my hair up. I had also found out that I had a complexion, and that sunburn was not becoming. I honestly thought I looked pretty, but Jack surveyed me with decided disapprobation.  \"What have you done to yourself? You don't look like the same girl. I'd never know you in that rig-out, with all those flippery-trippery curls all over your head. Why don't you comb your hair straight back, and let it hang in a braided tail, like you used to?\"  This didn't suit me at all. When I expect a compliment and get something quite different I always get snippy. So I said, with what I intended to be crushing dignity, \"that I supposed I wasn't the same girl; I had grown up, and if he didn't like my curls he needn't look at them. For my part, I thought them infinitely preferable to that horrid, conceited-looking moustache he had grown.\"  \"I'll shave it off if it doesn't suit you,\" said Jack amiably.  Jack is always so provokingly good-humoured. When you've taken pains and put yourself out--even to the extent of fibbing about a moustache--to exasperate a person, there is nothing more annoying than to have him keep perfectly angelic.  But after a while Jack and I adjusted ourselves to the change in each other and became very good friends again. It was quite a different friendship from the old, but it was very pleasant. Yes, it was; I _will_ admit that much.  I was provoked at Jack's determination to settle down for life in Valleyfield, a horrible, humdrum, little country village.  \"You'll never make your fortune there, Jack,\" I said spitefully. \"You'll just be a poor, struggling country doctor all your life, and you'll be grey at forty.\"  \"I don't expect to make a fortune, Kitty,\" said Jack quietly. \"Do you think that is the one desirable thing? I shall never be a rich man. But riches are not the only thing that makes life pleasant.\"  \"Well, I think they have a good deal to do with it, anyhow,\" I retorted. \"It's all very well to pretend to despise wealth, but it's generally a case of sour grapes. _I_ will own up honestly that I'd _love_ to be rich.\"  It always seems to make Jack blue and grumpy when I talk like that. I suppose that is one reason why he never asked me to settle down in life as a country doctor's wife. Another was, no doubt, that I always nipped his sentimental sproutings religiously in the bud.  Three weeks ago Alicia wrote to me, asking me to spend the winter with her. Her letters always make me just gasp with longing for the life they describe.  Jack's face, when I told him about it, was so woebegone that I felt a stab of remorse, even in the heyday of my delight.  \"Do you really mean it, Kitty? Are you going away to leave me?\"  \"You won't miss me much,\" I said flippantly--I had a creepy, crawly presentiment that a scene of some kind was threatening--\"and I'm awfully tired of Thrush Hill and country life, Jack. I suppose it is horribly ungrateful of me to say so, but it is the truth.\"  \"I shall miss you,\" he said soberly.  Somehow he had my hands in his. _How_ did he ever get them? I was sure I had them safely tucked out of harm's way behind me. \"You know, Kitty, that I love you. I am a poor man--perhaps I may never be anything else--and this may seem to you very presumptuous. But I cannot let you go like this. Will you be my wife, dear?\"  Wasn't it horribly straightforward and direct? So like Jack! I tried to pull my hands away, but he held them fast. There was nothing to do but answer him. That \"no\" I had determined to say must be said, but, oh! how woefully it did stick in my throat!  And I honestly believe that by the time I got it out it would have been transformed into a \"yes,\" in spite of me, had it not been for a certain paragraph in Alicia's letter which came providentially to my mind:      Not to flatter you, Katherine, you are a beauty, my dear--if     your photo is to be trusted. If you have not discovered that     fact before--how should you, indeed, in a place like Thrush     Hill?--you soon will in Montreal. With your face and figure     you will make a sensation.      There is to be a nephew of the Sinclairs here this winter. He     is an American, immensely wealthy, and will be the catch of     the season. A word to the wise, etc. Don't get into any     foolish entanglement down there. I have heard some gossip of     you and our old playfellow, Jack Willoughby. I hope it is     nothing but gossip. You can do better than that, Katherine.  That settled Jack's fate, if there ever had been any doubt.  \"Don't talk like that, Jack,\" I said hurriedly. \"It is all nonsense. I think a great deal of you as a friend and--and--all that, you know. But I can never marry you.\"  \"Are you sure, Kitty?\" said Jack earnestly. \"Don't you care for me at all?\"  It was horrid of Jack to ask that question!  \"No,\" I said miserably, \"not--not in that way, Jack. Oh, don't ever say anything like this to me again.\"  He let go of my hands then, white to the lips.  \"Oh, don't look like that, Jack,\" I entreated.  \"I can't help it,\" he said in a low voice. \"But I won't bother you again, dear. It was foolish of me to expect--to hope for anything of the sort. You are a thousand times too good for me, I know.\"  \"Oh, indeed I'm not, Jack,\" I protested. \"If you knew how horrid I am, really, you'd be glad and thankful for your escape. Oh, Jack, I wish people never grew up.\"  Jack smiled sadly.  \"Don't feel badly over this, Kitty. It isn't your fault. Good night, dear."]]]
