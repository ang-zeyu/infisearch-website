II  _Some account of Mr Jabberjee's experiences at the     Westminster Play._   Being forearmed by editorial beneficence with ticket of admission to theatrical entertainment by adolescent students at Westminster College, I presented myself at the scene of acting in a state of liveliest and frolicsome anticipation on a certain Wednesday evening in the month of December last, about 7.20 P.M.  At the summit of the stairs I was received by a posse of polite and stalwart striplings in white kids, who, after abstracting large circular orifice from my credentials, ordered me to ascend to a lofty gallery, where, on arriving, I found every chair pre-occupied, and moreover was restricted to a prospect of the backs of numerous juvenile heads, while expected to remain the livelong evening on the tiptoe of expectation and Shank's mare!  This for a while I endured submissively from native timidity and retirement, until my bosom boiled over at the sense of \"_Civis Romanus sum_,\" and, descending to the barrier, I harangued the wicket-keeper with great length and fervid eloquence, informing him that I was graduate of high-class Native University after passing most tedious and difficult exams with fugitive colours and that it was injurious and deleterious to my \"_mens sana in corpore sano_\" to remain on legs for some hours beholding what I practically found to be invisible.  But, though he turned an indulgent ear to my quandary, he professed his inability to help me over my \"_pons asinorum_,\" until I ventured to play the ticklish card and inform him that I was a distinguished representative of Hon'ble _Punch_, who was paternally anxious for me to be awarded a seat on the lap of luxury.  Then he unbended, and admitted me to the body of the auditorium, where I was conducted to a coign of vantage in near proximity to members of the fair sex and galaxy of beauty.  Thus, by dint of nude gumption, I was in the bed of clover and seventh heaven, and more so when, on inquiry from a bystander, I understood that the performance was taken from Mr TERRISS'S Adelphi Theatre, which I had heard was conspicuous for excellence in fierce combats, blood-curdling duels, and scenes in court. And I narrated to him how I too, when a callow and unfledged hobbardyhoy, had engaged in theatrical entertainments, and played such parts in native dramas as heroic giant-killers and tiger slayers, in which I was an \"_au fait_\" and \"_facile princeps_,\" also in select scenes from SHAKSPEARE'S play of _Macbeth_ in English and being correctly attired as a Scotch.  But presently I discovered that the play was quite another sort of Adelphi, being a jocose comedy by a notorious ancient author of the name of TERENCE, and written entirely in Latin, which a contiguous damsel expressed a fear lest she should find it incomprehensible and obscure. I hastened to reassure her by explaining that, having been turned out as a certificated B.A. by Indian College, I had acquired perfect familiarity and nodding acquaintance with the early Roman and Latin tongues, and offering my services as interpreter of \"_quicquid agunt homines_,\" and the entire \"_farrago libelli_,\" which rendered her red as a turkeycock with delight and gratitude. When the performance commenced with a scenic representation of the Roman Acropolis, and a venerable elderly man soliloquising lengthily to himself, and then carrying on a protracted logomachy with another greybeard--although I understood sundry colloquial idioms and phrases such as \"_uxorem duxit_,\" \"_carum mihi_,\" \"_quid agis?_\" \"_cur amat?_\" and the like, all of which I assiduously translated _vivâ voce_--I could not succeed in learning the reason why they were having such a snip-snap, until the interval, when the lady informed me herself that it was because one of them had carried off a nautch-girl belonging to the other's son--which caused me to marvel greatly at her erudition.  I looked that, in the next portion of the performance, I might behold the nautch-girl, and witness her forcible rescue--or at least some saltatory exhibition; but, alack! she remained _sotto voce_ and hermetically sealed; and though other characters, in addition to the elderly gentlemen, appeared, they were all exclusively masculine in gender, and there was nothing done but to converse by twos and threes. When the third portion opened with a long-desiderated peep of petticoats, I told my neighbour confidently that now at last we were to see this dancing girl and the abduction; but she replied that it was not so, for these females were merely the mother of the wife of another of the youths and her attendant ayah. And even this precious pair, after weeping and wringing their hands for a while, vanished, not to appear again.  Now as the entertainment proceeded, I fell into the dumps with increasing abashment and mortification to see everyone around me, ay, even the women and the tenderest juveniles! clap the hands and laugh in their sleeves with merriment at quirks and gleeks in which--in spite of all my classical proficiency--I could not discover _le mot pour rire_ or crack so much as the cream of a jest, but must sit there melancholy as a gib cat or smile at the wrong end of mouth.  For, indeed, I began to fear that I had been fobbed off with the smattered education of a painted sepulchre, that I should fail so dolorously to comprehend what was plain as a turnpike-staff to the veriest British babe and suckling!  However, on observing more closely, I discovered that most of the grown-up adults present had books containing the translation of all the witticisms, which they secretly perused, and that the feminality were also provided with pink leaflets on which the dark outline of the plot was perspicuously inscribed.  Moreover, on casting my eyes up to the gallery, I perceived that there were overseers there armed with long canes, and that the small youths did not indulge in plaudations and hilarity except when threatened by these.  And thereupon I took heart, seeing that the proceedings were clearly veiled in an obsolete and cryptic language, and it was simply matter of rite and custom to applaud at fixed intervals, so I did at Rome as the Romans did, and was laughter holding both his sides as often as I beheld the canes in a state of agitation.  I am not unaware that it is to bring a coal from Newcastle to pronounce any critical opinion upon the ludibrious qualities of so antiquated a comedy as this, but, while I am wishful to make every allowance for its having been composed in a period of prehistoric barbarity, I would still hazard the criticism that it does not excite the simpering guffaw with the frequency of such modern standard works as _exempli gratiâ_, _Miss Brown_, or _The Aunt of Charley_, to either of which I would award the palm for pure whimsicality and gawkiness.  Candour compels me to admit, however, that the conclusion of the Adelphi, in which a certain magician summoned a black-robed, steeple-hatted demon from the nether world, who, after commanding a minion to give a pickle-back to sundry grotesque personages, did castigate their ulterior portions severely with a large switch, was a striking amelioration and betterment upon the preceding scenes, and evinced that TERENCE possessed no deficiency of up-to-date facetiousness and genuine humour; though I could not but reflect--\"_O, si sic omnia!_\" and lament that he should have hidden his _vis comica_ for so long under the stifling disguise of a _serviette_.  I am a beggar at describing the hurly-burly and most admired disorder amidst which I performed the descent of the staircase in a savage perspiration, my elbows and heels unmercifully jostled by a dense, unruly horde, and going with nose in pocket, from trepidation due to national cowardice, while the seething mob clamoured and contended for overcoats and hats around very exiguous aperture, through which bewildered custodians handed out bundles of sticks and umbrellas, in vain hope to appease such impatience. Nor did I succeed to the recovery of my hat and paraphernalia until after twenty-four and a half minutes (Greenwich time), and with the labours of Hercules for the golden fleece!  [Illustration: \"A GOLDEN-HEADED UMBRELLA, FRESH AS A ROSE.\"]  For which I was minded at first to address a sharp remonstrance and claim for indemnity to some pundit in authority; but perceiving that by such fishing in troubled waters I was the gainer of a golden-headed umbrella, fresh as a rose, I decided to accept the olive branch and bury the bone of contention.     III  _Mr Jabberjee gives his views concerning the     Laureateship._   It is \"_selon les règles_\" and _rerum naturâ_ that the QUEEN'S Most Excellent Majesty, being constitutionally partial to poetry, should desire to have constant private supply from respectable tip-top genius, to be kept snug on Royal premises and ready at momentary notice to oblige with song or dirge, according as High Jinks or Dolorousness are the Court orders of the day.  But how far more satisfactory if Right Hon'ble Marquis SALISBURY, instead of arbitrarily decorating some already notorious bard with this \"_cordon bleu_\" and thus gilding a lily, should throw the office open to competition by public exam, and, after carefully weighing such considerations as the applicant's _res angusta domi_, the fluency of his imagination, his nationality, and so on--should award the itching palm of Fame to the poet who succeeded best in tickling his fancy!  Had some such method been adopted, the whole Indian Empire might to-day have been pleased as _Punch_ by the selection of a Hindoo gentleman to do the job--for I should infallibly"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25129"],["title","Baboo Jabberjee, B.A. (#3)"],["body","entered myself for the running. Unfortunately such unparalleled opportunity of throwing soup to Cerberus, and exhibiting colour-blindness, has been given the slip, though the door is perhaps still open (even at past eleven o'clock P.M.) for retracing the false step and web of Penelope.  For I would respectfully submit to Her Imperial Majesty that, in her duplicate capacity of Queen of England and Empress of India, she has urgent necessity for a Court Poet for each department, who would be _Arcades ambo_ and two of a trade, and share the duties with their proportionate pickings.  Or, if she would be unwilling to pay the piper to such a tune, I alone would work the oracle in both Indian and Anglo-Saxon departments, and waive the annual tub of sherry for equivalent in cash down.  And, if I may make the suggestion, I would strongly advise that this question of my joint (or several) appointment should be severely taken up by London Press as matter of simple justice to India. This is without prejudice to the already appointed Laureate as a swan and singing bird of the first water. All I desire is that the Public should know of another--and, perchance, even rarer--avis, who is _nigroque simillima cygno_, and could be obtained dog cheap for a mere song or a drug in the marketplace, if only there is made a National Appeal to the Sovereign that he should be promoted to such a sinecure and _ære perennius_.  As a specimen of the authenticity of my divine flatulence, please find inclosed herewith copy of complimentary verses, written by myself on hearing of Poet AUSTIN'S selection. Indulgence is kindly requested for very hasty composition, and circumstance of being greatly harrowed and impeded at time of writing by an excruciating full sized boil on back of neck, infuriated by collar of shirt, poulticings, and so forth.               CONGRATULATORY ODE  _To Hon'ble Poet-Laureate Alfred Austin, Esq._    Hail! you full-blown tulip!   Oh! when the wheezing zephyr brought glad news   Of your judicious appointment, no hearts who did peruse,   Such a long-desiderated slice of good luck were sorry at,   To a most prolific and polacious Poet-Laureate!   For no _poeta nascitur_ who is fitter   To greet Royal progeny with melodious twitter.     Seated on the resplendent cloud of official Elysium,     Far away, far away from fuliginous busy hum     You are now perched with phenomenal velocity     On vertiginous pinnacle of poetic pomposity!   Yet deign to cock thy indulgent eye at the petition   Of one consumed by corresponding ambition,   And lend the helping hand to lift, pulley-hauley,   To Parnassian Peak this poor perspiring Bengali!     Whose _ars poetica_ (as per sample lyric)     Is fully competent to turn out panegyric.   What if some time to come, perhaps not distant,   You were in urgent need of Deputy-Assistant!   For two Princesses might be confined simultaneously--   Then, how to homage the pair extemporaneously?   Or with Nuptial Ode, lack-a-daisy! What a fix   If with Influenza raging like cat on hot bricks!     In such a wrong box you will please remember yours truly,     Who can do the needful satisfactorily and duly,     By an _epithalamium_ (or what not) to inflame your credit     With every coronated head that will have read it!     And the _quid pro quo_, magnificent and grand Sir!     Would be at the rate of four annas for every stanza,   Now, thou who scale sidereal paths afar dost,   Deign from thy brilliant boots to cast the superfluous star-dust       Upon           The head of him               Whose fate depends                   On Thee!  (_Signed_) BABOO HURRY BUNGSHO JABBERJEE.   The above was forwarded (_post-paid_) to Hon'ble AUSTIN'S official address at Poet's Corner, Westminster Abbey (opposite the Royal Aquarium), but--hoity-toity and _mirabile dictu!_--no answer has yet been vouchsafed to yours truly save the cold shoulder of contemptuous inattention!  What a pity! Well-a-day, that we should find such passions of envy and jealousy in bosom of a distinguished poet, whose lucubrated productions may (for all that is known to the present writer) be no great shakes after all, and mere food for powder!  The British public is an ardent lover of the scintillating jewellery of fair play, and so I confidently submit my claims and poetical compositions to be arbitrated by the unanimous voice of all who understand such articles.  Let us remember that it is never too late to pull down the fallen idol out of the gilded shrine in which it has established itself with the egotistical isolation of a dog with the mange!     IV  _Containing Mr Jabberjee's Impressions at The Old     Masters._   I have the honour to report that the phantom of delight has recently recommenced to dance before me.  [Illustration: \"MISS JESSIMINA MANKLETOW.\"]  Miss JESSIMINA MANKLETOW, the perfumed, moony-faced daughter of the gracious and eagle-eyed goddess who presides over the select boarding establishment in which I am resident member, has of late emerged from the shell of superciliousness, and brought the beaming eye of encouragement to bear upon my diffidence and humility.  This I partly attribute to general impression--which I do not condescend to deny--that, at home, I occupy the social status of a Rajah, or some analogous kind of big native pot.  So, on a recent Saturday afternoon, she invited me to escort her and a similar young virginal lady friend, by name Miss PRISCILLA PRIMMETT, to Burlington House, Piccadilly, and, as _Prince Hamlet_ appositely remarks, \"Look here upon this picture and on this.\" Which I joyfully accepted, being head-over-heels in love with Art, and the possessor of two magnificent coloured photo-lithographs, representing a steeplechase in the act of jumping a trench, and a water-nymph in the very _décolleté_ undress of \"_puris naturalibus_,\" weltering on a rushy bed.  We proceeded thither upon the giddy summit of a Royal Oak omnibus, and on arriving in the vestibulum, were peremptorily commanded to undergo total abstinence from our umbrellas.  Being accompanied by the span-new silken affair with the golden head, which, as I have narrated _supra_, I was so lucky to obtain promiscuously after witnessing the Adelphi of the Westminster college boys, I naturally protested vehemently against such arbitrary and tyrannical regulations, urging the risk of my unprotected umbrella being feloniously abducted during unavoidable absence by some unprincipled and illegitimate claimant.  But, alack! I was confronted with the official ultimatum and _sine quâ non_, and have subsequently learnt that the cause of this self-denying ordinance is due to the uncontrollable enthusiasm of British Public for works of art, which leads them to signify approbation by puncturing innumerable orifices by dint of sticks or umbrellas in the process of pointing out tit-bits of painting, and on account of the detrimental influence on the marketable value of pictures thus distinguished by the plerophory of the _Vox Populi_.  Nevertheless, my heart was oppressed with many misgivings at having to hand over three hostage umbrellas--one being masculine and two feminine gender--and receiving nothing in exchange but a wooden medallion of no intrinsic worth, bearing the utterly disproportionate number of over one thousand! Next, after, at Miss JESSIMINA'S bidding, having purchased a sixpenny index, we ascended the staircase, and on shelling out three shillings cash payment, were consecutively squeezed through a restricted wicket as if needles going through the eye of a camel.  I will vouchsafe to aver that my interior sensations on penetrating the first gallery were those of acute and indignant disappointment, for will it be credited that a working majority of the exhibits were second, or even third and fourth-hand mechanisms of an unparagoned dingitude, and fit only for the lumbering room?  Perhaps I shall be told that this wintry exhibition is a mere stopgap and makeshift, until a fresh supply of bright new paintings can be procured, and that it is _ultra vires_ to obtain such for love or money before the merry month of May.  Still I must persist in denouncing the penny wisdom and pound foolery of the Academicals in foisting off upon the public such ancient and fish-like articles that have long ceased to be _bon ton_ and in the fashion, since it is undeniable that many are over fifty years, and some several centuries behind the times!  It is to be hoped that these parsimonious Misters will soon recognise that it is not possible for modern up-to-date Art to be florescent under this retrograde and fossilized system, and be warned that such untradesmanlike goings-on will deservedly forfeit the confidence and patronage of their most fastidious customers.  Miss JESSIMINA remarked more than once that such and such a picture was not in _her_ taste and she would never have chosen it personally, while Miss PRIMMETT declared that she would not have had her likeness taken by Hon'ble Sir JOSH GAINSBORO, or Misters VELASKY and VANDICK, not even if they implored her on their bended marrowbones, and that, as for a certain individual effeminately named ETTY, it was a wonderment to her how respectable people could stand in front of such brazen performances! These remarks are trivial, perhaps, but even straws will serve as cocks of the weather on occasions, and, moreover, I shall certify that the most general tone was of a critical and disapproving severity, and it was quite evident that the greater portion of the spectators could have done the job better themselves.  A certain Mister TURNER came in for the BENJAMIN'S mess of obloquy, having represented Pluto, the god of wealth, in the act of carrying off a female Proserpine, but the figures so Lilliputian, and in such a disproportionate expansion of confused sceneries, that the elopement produced but a very paltry impression. The slipshod carelessness of this painter may be realised from the fact that in a"]]]
