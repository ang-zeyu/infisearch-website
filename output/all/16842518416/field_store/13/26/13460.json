He now proposed that Rollo should go forward to the bridge with him, where they could have a better lookout.  \"Well,\" said Rollo. So the two boys went together to the bridge.  The bridge was a sort of narrow platform, extending across the steamer, from one paddle wheel to the other, for the captain or pilot to walk upon, in order to see how the steamer was going, and to direct the steering. When they are in the open sea any of the passengers are allowed to walk here; but in coming into port, or into a river crowded with shipping, then a notice is put up requesting passengers not to go upon the bridge, inasmuch as at such times it is required for the exclusive use of the captain and pilot.  This notice was up when Waldron and Rollo reached the bridge.  \"See,\" said Rollo, pointing at the notice. \"We cannot go there.\"  \"O, never mind that,\" said Waldron. \"They'll let us go. They only mean that they don't want too many there--that's all.\"  But Rollo would not go. Mr. George had accustomed him, in travelling about the world, always to obey all lawful rules and orders, and particularly every direction of this kind which he might find in public places. Some people are very much inclined to crowd upon the line of such rules, and even to encroach upon them till they actually encounter some resistance to drive them back. They do this partly to show their independence and importance. But Mr. George was not one of this sort.  So Rollo would not go upon the bridge.  \"Then let us go out on the forecastle,\" said Waldron. He pointed, as he spoke, to the forecastle, which is a small raised deck at the bows of a steamer, where there is an excellent place to see.  \"No,\" said Rollo, \"I will not go on the forecastle either. Uncle George's rule for me on board ship is, that I may go where I see other gentlemanly passengers go, and nowhere else. The passengers do not go on the forecastle.\"  \"Yes,\" said Waldron, \"there are some there now.\"  \"There is only one,\" said Rollo, \"and he has no business there.\"  During the progress of this conversation the boys had sat down upon the upper step of a steep flight of stairs which led down from the promenade deck to the main deck. They could see pretty well where they were, but not so well, Waldron thought, as they could have seen from the forecastle.  \"_I_ think we might go on the forecastle as well as not,\" said Waldron, \"even according to your own rule. For there is a passenger there.\"  \"I think it is doubtful,\" said Rollo.  \"Well,\" said Waldron, \"we'll call it doubtful. We will draw lots for it.\"  So saying, Waldron put his hand in his pocket, and, after fumbling about there a minute or two, took it out, and held it before Rollo with the fingers shut, so that Rollo could not see what was in it.  \"Odd or even?\" said Waldron.  Rollo looked at the closed hand, with a smile of curiosity on his face, but he did not answer.  \"Say odd or even,\" continued Waldron. \"If you hit, that will prove that you are right, and we will not go to the forecastle; but if you miss, then we _will_ go.\"  Rollo hesitated a moment, not being quite sure that this was a proper way of deciding a question of right and wrong. In a moment, however, he answered, \"Even.\"  Waldron opened his hand, and Rollo saw that there was _nothing_ in it.  \"There,\" said Waldron, \"it is odd, and you said even.\"  \"No,\" said Rollo, \"it is not either even _or_ odd. There is nothing at all in your hand.\"  \"Well,\" said Waldron, \"nothing is a number, and it is odd.\"  \"O Waldron!\" said Rollo, \"it is not any number at all. Besides, if it is a number, it is not odd--it is even.\"  \"Yes,\" said Waldron, \"it is a number, for you can add it, and subtract it, and multiply it, and divide it, just as you can any other number.\"  \"O Waldron!\" exclaimed Rollo again. \"You can't do any such thing.\"  [Illustration: ODD OR EVEN.]  \"Yes,\" said Waldron, \"I can add nothing to one, and it makes one. So, I can take nothing away from one, and it leaves one.  \"I can multiply nothing, too. I can multiply it by ten. Ten times nothing are nothing. So I can divide it. Five in nothing no times, and nothing over.\"  Rollo was somewhat perplexed by this argument, and he did not know what to reply. Still he would not admit that nothing was a number--still less that it was an odd number. He did not believe, he said, that it was any number at all. The boys continued the discussion[A] for some time, and then they concluded to go and refer it to Mr. George.  [A] The conversation was a discussion, and not a dispute, for it was calm, quiet, and good-tempered throughout. A dispute is an _angry_ discussion.  And here I ought to say that Waldron had an artful design in taking nothing in his hand, when he called upon Rollo to say, odd or even. He did it in order that whatever answer Rollo might give, he might attempt to prove it wrong. He was a very ingenious boy, and could as easily maintain that nothing was even as that it was odd. Whichever Rollo had said, his plan was to maintain the contrary, and so persuade him to go to the forecastle.  Mr. George was very much pleased when the boys brought the question to him. Indeed, almost all people are pleased when boys come to them in an amicable manner, to have their controversies settled. Then, besides, he inferred from the nature of the question that had arisen in this case, that Waldron was a boy of considerable thinking powers, or else he would not have taken any interest in a purely intellectual question like this.  \"Well,\" said Mr. George, \"that is quite a curious question. But before I decide it you must first both of you give me your reasons. What makes you think nothing is an odd number, Waldron?\"  \"I don't know,\" said Waldron, hesitating. \"I think it looks kind of odd.\"  Mr. George smiled at this reason, and then asked Rollo what made him think it was an even number.  \"I don't think it is an even number,\" said Rollo. \"I don't think it is any number at all.  \"However,\" continued Rollo, \"that is not the real question, after all. The real question is, whether we shall go on the forecastle or not, to have a lookout.\"  \"No,\" said Mr. George, \"it is not according to etiquette at sea for the passengers to go on the forecastle.\"  \"But they do,\" said Waldron.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George, \"they sometimes do, I know; and sometimes, under peculiar circumstances, it is right for them to go; but as a general rule, it is not. That is the place for the sailors to occupy in working the ship. It is something like the kitchen in a hotel. What should you think of the guests at a hotel, if they went down into the kitchen to see what was going on there?\"  Rollo laughed aloud.  \"But we don't go to the forecastle to see what is going on there,\" said Waldron; \"we go for a lookout--to see what is going on away ahead, on the water.\"  \"True,\" said Mr. George, \"and that is a very important difference, I acknowledge. I don't think my comparison holds good.\"  Mr. George was always very candid in all his arguing. It is of very great importance that all persons should be so, especially when reasoning with boys. It teaches _them_ to be candid.  Just at this time Waldron's attention was attracted by the appearance of a very large steamer, which now came suddenly into view, with its great red funnel pouring out immense volumes of black smoke. Waldron ran over to the other side of the deck to see it. Rollo followed, and thus the explanation which Mr. George might have given, in respect to the arithmetical nature and relations of nothing were necessarily postponed to some future time.         *       *       *       *       *  About half an hour after this, while Rollo was sitting by the side of his uncle, looking at the map, and trying to find out how soon they should come in sight of the famous old Castle of Dunbarton, which stands on a rocky hill upon the banks of the Clyde, Mr. Kennedy came up to him to inquire if he knew where Waldron was.  Rollo said that he did not know. He had not seen him for some time.  \"We can't find him any where,\" said Mr. Kennedy. \"We have looked all over the ship. His mother is half crazy. She thinks he has fallen overboard.\"  So Rollo and Mr. George both rose immediately and went off to see if they could find Waldron. They went in various directions, inquiring of every body they met if they had seen such a boy. Several people had seen him half an hour before, when he was with Rollo; but no one knew where he had been since. At last, in about ten minutes, Rollo came running to Mrs. Kennedy, who was walking about through the cabins in great distress, and said, hurriedly, \"I've found him; he is safe,\" and then ran off to tell Mr. Kennedy.  Mrs. Kennedy followed him, calling out eagerly, \"Where is he? Where is he?\" Rollo met Mr. Kennedy at the head of the cabin stairs, and he seemed very much rejoiced to learn that Waldron was found. Rollo led the way, and Mr. and Mrs. Kennedy followed him, until they came to a place on the deck, pretty well forward, where there was an opening surrounded by an iron railing, through which you could look down into the hold below. It was very far down that you could look, and at different distances on the way were to be seen iron ladders going from deck to deck, and ponderous shafts, moving continually, with great clangor and din, while at the bottom were seen the mouths of several great glowing furnaces, with men at work shovelling coal into them.  \"There he is,\" said Rollo, pointing down.  Mr. and Mrs. Kennedy leaned over the railing and looked down, and there they beheld Waldron, hard at work shovelling coal into the mouth of a furnace, with a shovel which he had borrowed of one of the men. In a word, Waldron had turned stoker.  Mr. Kennedy hurried down the ladders to bring Waldron up, while Mr. George and Rollo went back to the deck.         *       *       *       *       *  About"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25174"],["title","Rollo in Scotland (#2)"],["body"," hour after this Mr. Kennedy came and took a seat on a settee where Mr. George was sitting, and began to talk about Waldron.  \"He is the greatest plague of my life,\" said Mr. Kennedy. \"I don't know what I shall do with him. He is continually getting into some mischief. I have shut him up a close prisoner in the state room, and I am going to keep him there till we land. But it will do no good. It will not be an hour after he gets out before he will be in some new scrape. You know a great deal about boys; I wish you would tell me what to do with him.\"  \"I think, if he was under my charge,\" said Mr. George, very quietly, \"I should _load_ him.\"  \"Load him?\" repeated Mr. Kennedy, inquiringly.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George, \"I mean I should give him a load to carry.\"  \"I don't understand, exactly,\" said Mr. Kennedy. \"What is your idea?\"  \"My idea is,\" said Mr. George, \"that a growing boy, especially if he is a boy of unusual capacity, is like a steam engine in this respect. A steam engine must always have a load to carry,--that is, something to _employ_ and _absorb_ the force it is capable of exerting,--or else it will break itself to pieces with it. The force _will_ expend itself on something, and if you don't load it with something good, it will employ itself in mischief.  \"Here now is the engine of this ship,\" continued Mr. George. \"Its force is conducted to the paddle wheels, where it has full employment for itself in turning the wheels against the immense resistance of the water, and in carrying the ship along. This work is its _load_. If this load were to be taken off,--for example, if the steamer were to be lifted up out of the water so that the wheels could spin round in the air,--the engine would immediately stave itself to pieces, for want of having any thing else to expend its energies upon.\"  \"Yes,\" said Mr. Kennedy. \"I have no doubt of it.\"  \"Now, I think,\" continued Mr. George, \"that it is in some sense the same with a boy whose mental and physical powers are in good condition. These powers must be employed. They hunger and thirst for employment, and if they don't get it in doing good they will be sure to find it in some kind of mischief.\"  \"Well,\" said Mr. Kennedy, with a sigh, \"there is a great deal in that; but what is to be done? You can't _employ_ such a boy as that. There is nothing he can do. I wish you would take him, and see if you can load him, as you call it. Take him with you on this tour you are going to make in Scotland. I will put money in your hands to cover his expenses, and you may charge any thing you please beyond, for your care of him.\"  \"Perhaps his mother would not like such an arrangement,\" said Mr. George.  \"O, yes,\" replied Mr. Kennedy; \"nothing would please her more.\"  \"And would Waldron like it himself?\" asked Mr. George.  \"I presume so,\" said Mr. Kennedy; \"he likes any thing that is a change.\"  Mr. Kennedy went down to the state room to see Waldron, and ask him what he thought of this plan. Waldron said he should like it very much. So he was at once liberated from his confinement, and transferred to Mr. George's charge.  \"Now, Waldron,\" said Mr. George, when Waldron came to him, \"I shall want some help from you about getting ashore from the boat. Do you think you could go ashore with Rollo as soon as we land, and take a cab and go directly up to the hotel, and engage rooms for us, while I am looking out for the baggage, and getting it ready?\"  \"Yes, sir; yes, sir,\" said Waldron, eagerly. \"I can do that. What hotel shall I go to?\"  \"I don't know,\" said Mr. George. \"I don't know any thing about the hotels in Glasgow. You must find out.\"  \"Well,\" said Waldron, \"only how shall I find out?\"  \"I am sure _I_ don't know,\" said Mr. George. \"I leave it all to you and Rollo. I am busy forming my plans for a tour. You and Rollo can go and talk about it, and see if you can discover any way of finding out the name of one of the best hotels. If you can't, after trying fifteen minutes, come to me, and I will help you.\"  So saying, Mr. George began to study his map again, and Waldron, apparently much pleased with his commission, said, \"Come, Rollo,\" and walked away.     CHAPTER II.  DISTRICTS OF SCOTLAND.   I think that Mr. George was quite right in his idea, that the true remedy for the spirit of restlessness and mischief that Waldron manifested was to employ him, or, as he metaphorically termed it, to _load_ him. And as this volume will, perhaps, fall into the hands of many parents as well as children, I will here remark that a great many good-hearted and excellent boys fall into the same difficulty from precisely the same cause; namely, that they have not adequate employment for their mental and physical powers, which are growing and strengthening every day, and are hungering and thirsting for the means and opportunities of expending their energies.  Parents are seldom aware how fast their children are growing and increasing in strength, both of body and mind. The evidences of this growth, in respect to the limbs and muscles of the body, are, indeed, obvious to the eye; and as the growth advances, we have continual proof of the pleasure which the exercise of these new powers gives to the possessor of them. The active and boisterous plays of boys derive their chief charm from the pleasure they feel in testing and exercising their muscular powers in every way. They are always running, and leaping, and wrestling, and pursuing each other, and pushing each other, and climbing up to high places, and standing on their heads, and walking on the tops of fences, and performing all other possible or conceivable feats, which may give them the pleasure of working, in new and untried ways, their muscular machinery, and feeling its increasing power, and in producing new effects by means of it. They get themselves into continual difficulties and dangers by these things, and cause themselves a great deal of suffering. Still they go on, for the intoxicating delight of using their powers, or, rather, the irresistible instinct which impels them to use them, has greater force with them than all other considerations.  We see all this very plainly in respect to the action of the limbs and organs of the body; for it is palpably evident to our senses, and we feel the necessity of providing safe and proper modes of expending these energies. Since we find, for example, that boys must kick something, we give them a football to kick; which, being a mere ball of wind, may be kicked without doing any harm. And so with almost all the other playthings and sports which are devised for boys, or which they devise for themselves. They are the means, simply, of enabling them to employ their growing powers and expand their energies, without doing any body any harm. We know very well that it is not safe to leave these powers and energies unemployed.  But we are very apt to forget that there are powers and faculties of the mind, equally vigorous, and equally eager to be exercised, that ought also to be provided for. The strength of the will, the power of exercising judgment and discretion, the spirit of enterprise, the love of command, and other such mental impulses, are growing and strengthening every day, in every healthy boy, and they are all clamorous for employment. The instinct that impels them is so strong that they will find employment in some way or other for themselves, unless an occupation is otherwise provided for them. A very large proportion of the acts of mischievousness and wrong which boys commit arise from this cause. Even boys who are bad enough to form a midnight scheme for robbing an orchard, are influenced mainly in perpetrating the deed, not by the pleasure of eating the apples which they expect to obtain by it, but by the pleasure of forming a scheme, of contriving ways and means of surmounting difficulties, of watching against surprises, of braving dangers, of successfully attaining to a desired end over and through a succession of obstacles interposing. This view of the case does not show that such deeds are right; it only shows the true nature of the wrong involved in them, and helps us in discovering and applying the remedy.  At least this was Mr. George's view of the case in respect to Waldron, when he heard how often he was getting into difficulty by his adventurous and restless character. He thought that the remedy was, as he expressed it, to _load_ him; that is, to give to the active and enterprising spirit of his mind something to expend his energies upon. It required great tact and discretion, and great knowledge of the habits and characteristics of boyhood, to enable him to do this; but Mr. George possessed these qualities in a high degree.  But to return to the story.  Mr. George had decided on coming into Scotland from Liverpool by water, because that was the cheapest way of getting into the heart of the country. And here, in order that you may understand the course of Rollo's travels, I must pause to explain the leading geographical features of the country. If you read this explanation carefully, and follow it on the map, you will understand the subsequent narrative much better than you otherwise would do.  You will see, then, by looking at any map, that Scotland is separated from England by two rivers which flow from the interior of the country into the sea--one towards the east, and the other towards the west. The one on the east side is the Tweed. The Tweed forms the frontier between England and Scotland for a considerable distance, and is, therefore, often spoken of as the boundary between the two countries. Indeed, the phrase \"beyond the Tweed\" is often used in England to denote Scotland. In former times, when England and Scotland were independent kingdoms, incessant wars were carried on across this border, and incursions were made by the chieftains from each realm into the territories of the other, and castles were built on many commanding points to defend the ground.
