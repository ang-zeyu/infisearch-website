I know it well.  Danced there often during the old _régime_.\"  \"The old régime?\"  The doctor looked puzzled.  \"Yes.  It used to belong to the Earl of Forres.  He couldn't afford to keep it up and his other places as well, so he sold it to Sir John Patterdale. . . .  Made his money in hardware, did Sir John. . . . Surely you know Patterdale's Patent Plate.\"  The Board opined that it did not, and departed to the next case.  It even seemed to regard such flippancy with a certain amount of suspicion; but then Medical Boards are things of some solemnity. . . .  And so in the course of two or three days Vane drove up to the historic gates of Rumfold Hall in an ambulance.  The house, situated in the heart of Surrey, was surrounded by extensive grounds.  The view from it was magnificent, stretching away for miles and miles to the south, and terminating in the purple downs: and Vane, as the car waited for the gates to be opened, felt that indefinable thrill of pride that comes to every man when he looks on some glorious stretch of his own country. He noticed that the lodge-keeper had changed since he was there last, and not, it struck him, for the better.  How well he remembered old John, with his sweet old wife, and their perfectly kept patch of garden and spotless little kitchen. . . .  He had had two sons, both in the Grenadiers, magnificent, strapping fellows--and Vane wondered what had become of them. . . .  Somehow he couldn't quite imagine old John not touching his hat as the ambulance came in; whereas his successor merely gazed curiously at the occupants, and then slouched back into the lodge. . . .  Of course hat-touching is a relic of feudalism, and, as such, too hideous to contemplate in this age of democracy; but still--like a smile--it costs little and gives much pleasure.  From the condition of the grounds it did not seem that the present owner had been very greatly troubled by the labour shortage.  The flower beds were a riot of colour; the grass was short and beautifully kept.  And as the ambulance rounded a corner of the drive and the house opened up in front Vane saw that tennis was in full swing on the lawns.  \"Say--what sort of a guy is this fellow?\" asked a New Zealander opposite him suddenly.  \"It seems to me to be some house.\"  Vane looked at him thoughtfully for a moment before replying, and the car was already slowing down before he finally spoke.  \"He's a substitute for the old order of things.  And according to the labels of all substitutes, they are the last word in modern efficiency.\"  The car pulled up at that moment, and they stepped out to find Lady Patterdale standing on the steps to welcome them.  Let it be said at once that Lady Patterdale was a perfect dear.  One lost sight of her incredible vulgarity in view of the charming kindliness of her heart.  And, after all, vulgarity is only comparative.  In the sanctity of the little shop in Birmingham where Sir John had first laid the foundations of his fortune, aspirates could drop unheeded.  What mattered then, as always, was whether the heart was in the right place.  With Lady Patterdale it was. . . .  And because _au fond_, she was such a dear, it made it all the more pathetic to see her in such surroundings.  One felt, and one felt that in the bottom of her heart she felt, that she would have been far more happy in the kitchen.  Except that in the kitchen her lost aspirates would probably have been handed back to her on a salver, whereas in the drawing-room they were ground into the carpet. . . .  The spread of education has made the kitchen a very dangerous place.  In appearance Lady Patterdale was short and stout; eminently the type of woman who, if clothed according to the dictates of common sense, would be called a \"comfortable old party.\"  One could imagine her in a cotton dress, with her sleeves rolled up above her elbows, displaying a pair of plump forearms and wielding a rolling pin in front of a good hot fire.  Covered with flour--her face very red--she would have been in her element. . . .  As it was, the dictates of fashion had cast their blight over the proceedings.  The name of her dressmaker is immaterial.  Originally Smith & Co. in all probability, it had now become Smythe et Cie, and advertised in all the most exclusive papers.  Unfortunately, in the case of Lady Patterdale they did not stop at advertising.  They carried out their dreadful threats and clothed her.  The result was incredible.  She resembled nothing so much as a bursting melon.  Onlookers shuddered at times when they thought of the trust reposed by Providence and Lady Patterdale in a few paltry hooks and eyes.  The strain appeared so terrific--the consequences of a disaster so appalling.  As Vane stepped out of the ambulance Lady Patterdale, supported on either side by one of the nursing staff, advanced to meet him.  Her jolly old face was wreathed in smiles; cordiality and kindliness oozed from her.  \"Welcome, both of you,\" she cried.  \"Welcome to Rumfold 'all.\"  The Sister on her left started as if a serpent had stung her, and Vane decided that he did not like her.  Then he turned to the kindly old woman, and smiled.  \"Thank you, Lady Patterdale,\" he said, taking her outstretched hand. \"I'm sure it's going to be topping.\"  \"You're just in nice time for luncheon,\" she continued, as she turned to welcome the New Zealander.  \"And after that you'll be able to find your way about the 'ouse.\"  Lunch was the only meal where all the convalescents met, as, generally, some of them had retired before dinner.  It was served in the old banqueting hall, which, when Vane remembered it, had been used for dancing.  The officers had it to themselves, the nursing staff feeding elsewhere. . . .  The contrast struck Vane forcibly as he sat down at the long table. The last time he had been in the room he and three or four kindred spirits had emptied a fruit salad into a large wind instrument just before the band played the final gallop. . . .  \"Beer, sir, or cider?\"  He half turned to answer, when suddenly the voice continued, \"Why, but surely, sir, it's Mr. Vane?\"  He looked up and saw the same butler who had been at the Hall in the old days.  \"Why, Robert,\" he said delightedly, \"you still here?  Jove! but I'm glad to see you.  I thought Sir John had made a clean sweep of all the staff.\"  The butler nodded his head sadly.  \"All except me, sir--me and Mrs. Hickson.  She was the housekeeper, if you remember.  And she couldn't stand it--that is, she had to leave after a year.\"  \"Ah!\"  Vane's tone was non-committal.  \"And what's become of old John--at the Lodge?\"  \"He went, sir.  Sir John found him too slow.\"  Robert poured out a glass of beer.  \"He's in the village, sir.  One of his sons was killed at Noove Chappel.\"  \"I'm sorry about that.  I must go and see him.\"  \"He'd be proud, sir, if you'd be so kind.  I often goes down there myself for a bit of a chat about the old days.\"  With a sigh the old butler passed on, and Vane returned to his lunch. . . .  \"You seem to know our archaic friend,\" remarked the officer sitting next him.  \"He's a dear old thing. . . .\"  \"He's one of a dying breed,\" said Vane shortly.  \"I would trust old Robert with everything in the world that I possessed. . . .\"  \"That so?\" returned the other.  \"Has he been here long?\"  \"To my certain knowledge for twenty-five years, and I believe longer. It almost broke his heart when he heard that Lord Forres was going to sell the place.\"  Vane continued his lunch in silence, and suddenly a remark from the other side of the table struck his ears.  \"I say, old Side-whiskers hasn't given me my fair whack of beer.\"  It was a youngster speaking, and the remark was plainly audible to the old butler two places away.  For a moment his face quivered, and then he returned to the speaker.  \"I beg your pardon, sir,\" he remarked quietly.  \"Let me fill your glass.\"  \"Thanks, old sport.  That's a bit better looking.\"  Vane turned to his neighbour with an amused smile.  \"Truly the old order changeth,\" remarked the other thoughtfully.  \"And one's inclined to wonder if it's changing for the better.\"  \"Unfortunately in any consideration of that sort one is so hopelessly biassed by one's own personal point of view,\" returned Vane.  \"Do you think so?\"  He crumbled the bread beside him.  \"Don't you think one can view a little episode like that in an unbiassed way?  Isn't it merely in miniature what is going on all over the country? . . .  The clash of the new spirit with the one that is centuries old.\"  \"And you really regard that youth as being representative of the new spirit?\"  \"No one man can be.  But I regard him as typical of a certain phase of that spirit.  In all probability a magnificent platoon commander--there are thousands like him who have come into being with this war.  The future of the country lies very largely in their hands.  What are they going to make of it?\"  The same question--the same ceaseless refrain.  Sometimes expressed, more often not.  ENGLAND in the melting pot--what was going to happen? Unconsciously Vane's eyes rested on the figure of the old butler standing at the end of the room.  There was something noble about the simplicity of the old man, confronted by the crashing of the system in which he and his father, and his father's father had been born.  A puzzled look seemed ever in his eyes: the look of a dog parted from a beloved master, in new surroundings amongst strange faces.  And officially, at any rate, the crash was entirely for the benefit of him and his kind . . . . wherein lay the humour.  Vane laughed shortly as he pushed back his chair.  \"Does anything matter save one's own comfort?  Personally I think slavery would be an admirable innovation.\"   Sir John Patterdale was everything that his "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24949"],["title","Control Group (#0)"],["body","_\"Any problem posed by one group of  human beings can be resolved by any  other group.\" That's what the Handbook  said. But did that include primitive  humans? Or the Bees? Or a ..._   CONTROL GROUP  By ROGER DEE   The cool green disk of Alphard Six on the screen was infinitely welcome after the arid desolation and stinking swamplands of the inner planets, an airy jewel of a world that might have been designed specifically for the hard-earned month of rest ahead. Navigator Farrell, youngest and certainly most impulsive of the three-man Terran Reclamations crew, would have set the _Marco Four_ down at once but for the greater caution of Stryker, nominally captain of the group, and of Gibson, engineer, and linguist. Xavier, the ship's little mechanical, had--as was usual and proper--no voice in the matter.  \"Reconnaissance spiral first, Arthur,\" Stryker said firmly. He chuckled at Farrell's instant scowl, his little eyes twinkling and his naked paunch quaking over the belt of his shipboard shorts. \"Chapter One, Subsection Five, Paragraph Twenty-seven: _No planetfall on an unreclaimed world shall be deemed safe without proper--_\"  Farrell, as Stryker had expected, interrupted with characteristic impatience. \"Do you _sleep_ with that damned Reclamations Handbook, Lee? Alphard Six isn't an unreclaimed world--it was never colonized before the Hymenop invasion back in 3025, so why should it be inhabited now?\"  Gibson, who for four hours had not looked up from his interminable chess game with Xavier, paused with a beleaguered knight in one blunt brown hand.  \"No point in taking chances,\" Gibson said in his neutral baritone. He shrugged thick bare shoulders, his humorless black-browed face unmoved, when Farrell included him in his scowl. \"We're two hundred twenty-six light-years from Sol, at the old limits of Terran expansion, and there's no knowing what we may turn up here. Alphard's was one of the first systems the Bees took over. It must have been one of the last to be abandoned when they pulled back to 70 Ophiuchi.\"  \"And I think _you_ live for the day,\" Farrell said acidly, \"when we'll stumble across a functioning dome of live, buzzing Hymenops. Damn it, Gib, the Bees pulled out a hundred years ago, before you and I were born--neither of us ever saw a Hymenop, and never will!\"  \"But I saw them,\" Stryker said. \"I fought them for the better part of the century they were here, and I learned there's no predicting nor understanding them. We never knew why they came nor why they gave up and left. How can we know whether they'd leave a rear-guard or booby trap here?\"  He put a paternal hand on Farrell's shoulder, understanding the younger man's eagerness and knowing that their close-knit team would have been the more poorly balanced without it.  \"Gib's right,\" he said. He nearly added _as usual_. \"We're on rest leave at the moment, yes, but our mission is still to find Terran colonies enslaved and abandoned by the Bees, not to risk our necks and a valuable Reorientations ship by landing blind on an unobserved planet. We're too close already. Cut in your shields and find a reconnaissance spiral, will you?\"  Grumbling, Farrell punched coordinates on the Ringwave board that lifted the _Marco Four_ out of her descent and restored the bluish enveloping haze of her repellors.  Stryker's caution was justified on the instant. The speeding streamlined shape that had flashed up unobserved from below swerved sharply and exploded in a cataclysmic blaze of atomic fire that rocked the ship wildly and flung the three men to the floor in a jangling roar of alarms.         *       *       *       *       *  \"So the Handbook tacticians knew what they were about,\" Stryker said minutes later. Deliberately he adopted the smug tone best calculated to sting Farrell out of his first self-reproach, and grinned when the navigator bristled defensively. \"Some of their enjoinders seem a little stuffy and obvious at times, but they're eminently sensible.\"  When Farrell refused to be baited Stryker turned to Gibson, who was busily assessing the damage done to the ship's more fragile equipment, and to Xavier, who searched the planet's surface with the ship's magnoscanner. The _Marco Four_, Ringwave generators humming gently, hung at the moment just inside the orbit of Alphard Six's single dun-colored moon.  Gibson put down a test meter with an air of finality.  \"Nothing damaged but the Zero Interval Transfer computer. I can realign that in a couple of hours, but it'll have to be done before we hit Transfer again.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Stryker looked dubious. \"What if the issue is forced before the ZIT unit is repaired? Suppose they come up after us?\"  \"I doubt that they can. Any installation crudely enough equipped to trust in guided missiles is hardly likely to have developed efficient space craft.\"  Stryker was not reassured.  \"That torpedo of theirs was deadly enough,\" he said. \"And its nature reflects the nature of the people who made it. Any race vicious enough to use atomic charges is too dangerous to trifle with.\" Worry made comical creases in his fat, good-humored face. \"We'll have to find out who they are and why they're here, you know.\"  \"They can't be Hymenops,\" Gibson said promptly. \"First, because the Bees pinned their faith on Ringwave energy fields, as we did, rather than on missiles. Second, because there's no dome on Six.\"  \"There were three empty domes on Five, which is a desert planet,\" Farrell pointed out. \"Why didn't they settle Six? It's a more habitable world.\"  Gibson shrugged. \"I know the Bees always erected domes on every planet they colonized, Arthur, but precedent is a fallible tool. And it's even more firmly established that there's no possibility of our rationalizing the motivations of a culture as alien as the Hymenops'--we've been over that argument a hundred times on other reclaimed worlds.\"  \"But this was never an unreclaimed world,\" Farrell said with the faint malice of one too recently caught in the wrong. \"Alphard Six was surveyed and seeded with Terran bacteria around the year 3000, but the Bees invaded before we could colonize. And that means we'll have to rule out any resurgent colonial group down there, because Six never had a colony in the beginning.\"  \"The Bees have been gone for over a hundred years,\" Stryker said. \"Colonists might have migrated from another Terran-occupied planet.\"  Gibson disagreed.  \"We've touched at every inhabited world in this sector, Lee, and not one surviving colony has developed space travel on its own. The Hymenops had a hundred years to condition their human slaves to ignorance of everything beyond their immediate environment--the motives behind that conditioning usually escape us, but that's beside the point--and they did a thorough job of it. The colonists have had no more than a century of freedom since the Bees pulled out, and four generations simply isn't enough time for any subjugated culture to climb from slavery to interstellar flight.\"  Stryker made a padding turn about the control room, tugging unhappily at the scanty fringe of hair the years had left him.  \"If they're neither Hymenops nor resurgent colonists,\" he said, \"then there's only one choice remaining--they're aliens from a system we haven't reached yet, beyond the old sphere of Terran exploration. We always assumed that we'd find other races out here someday, and that they'd be as different from us in form and motivation as the Hymenops. Why not now?\"  Gibson said seriously, \"Not probable, Lee. The same objection that rules out the Bees applies to any trans-Alphardian culture--they'd have to be beyond the atomic fission stage, else they'd never have attempted interstellar flight. The Ringwave with its Zero Interval Transfer principle and instantaneous communications applications is the only answer to long-range travel, and if they'd had that they wouldn't have bothered with atomics.\"  Stryker turned on him almost angrily. \"If they're not Hymenops or humans or aliens, then what in God's name _are_ they?\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Aye, there's the rub,\" Farrell said, quoting a passage whose aptness had somehow seen it through a dozen reorganizations of insular tongue and a final translation to universal Terran. \"If they're none of those three, we've only one conclusion left. There's no one down there at all--we're victims of the first joint hallucination in psychiatric history.\"  Stryker threw up his hands in surrender. \"We can't identify them by theorizing, and that brings us down to the business of first-hand investigation. Who's going to bell the cat this time?\"  \"I'd like to go,\" Gibson said at once. \"The ZIT computer can wait.\"  Stryker vetoed his offer as promptly. \"No, the ZIT comes first. We may have to run for it, and we can't set up a Transfer jump without the computer. It's got to be me or Arthur.\"  Farrell felt the familiar chill of uneasiness that inevitably preceded this moment of decision. He was not lacking in courage, else the circumstances under which he had worked for the past ten years--the sometimes perilous, sometimes downright charnel conditions left by the fleeing Hymenop conquerors--would have broken him long ago. But that same hard experience had honed rather than blunted the edge of his imagination, and the prospect of a close-quarters stalking of an unknown and patently hostile force was anything but attractive.  \"You two did the field work on the last location,\" he said. \"It's high time I took my turn--and God knows I'd go mad if I had to stay inship and listen to Lee memorizing his Handbook subsections or to Gib practicing dead languages with Xavier.\"  Stryker laughed for the first time since the explosion that had so nearly wrecked the _Marco Four_.  \"Good enough. Though it wouldn't be more diverting to listen for hours to you improvising enharmonic variations on the _Lament for Old Terra_ with your accordion.\"  Gibson, characteristically, had "]]]
