There's corn enough in this field for everybody.\"  Master Meadow Mouse tried to go to sleep again.  \"I wish Fatty Coon wouldn't make so much noise,\" said Master Meadow Mouse, grumbling a little because he was very drowsy and didn't like to be disturbed.  \"There!\" he exclaimed after a few moments. \"He's gone, thank goodness!\"  But Fatty Coon had only carried his ear of corn to Broad Brook, to wash it before he gobbled the kernels. He was very particular to wash almost everything he ate. But that was about the only way in which he was fussy. There was nothing, almost, that he wouldn't bolt greedily.  After he had devoured the first ear of corn, Fatty Coon went back and pulled another off the same shock.  Again he roused Master Meadow Mouse from his slumbers.  \"He's at it again!\" Master Meadow Mouse complained. \"I wish he'd go to some other shock.\"  The third time that Fatty Coon wrenched an ear of corn from the shock where Master Meadow Mouse lived he paused and cocked an ear towards the top of the shock.  \"Was that a squeak?\" he asked himself. And then he sniffed. \"Ha!\" he cried. \"Do I smell a Meadow Mouse?\"  Fatty Coon was not mistaken. When he rustled the dried cornstalks the third time, Master Meadow Mouse had cried right out in his sleep. And he waked up just soon enough to hear Fatty Coon's remarks.  \"Maybe you do smell a Meadow Mouse,\" he replied under his breath, so Fatty Coon couldn't hear him. \"But it won't do you any good; for I'm not coming out of my castle until you go away.\"  It soon appeared that Fatty Coon did not intend to leave. For Fatty began to pull at the cornstalks with his claws. Although Farmer Green had bound the stalks together tightly, one by one Fatty tore them loose and let them fall upon the ground.  And inside the shock Master Meadow Mouse suddenly started up in alarm.     [Illustration]  14  The Masked Bandit   IT was no wonder that Master Meadow Mouse was startled. He cowered inside his nest in the top of the shock of corn. The whole shock shook. There was a terrible rustle of dry leaves as Fatty Coon tore away stalk after stalk.  \"Old Mr. Crow never did this!\" Master Meadow Mouse stammered. \"He never disturbed my rest. But this awful Fatty Coon means to catch me. And I don't know what to do.\"  Meanwhile Fatty Coon was muttering horribly to himself as he worked.  \"This fellow must be fat,\" he grunted, as he wrenched at a stubborn stalk with claws and teeth. \"With all this corn to feast on he must be in fine trim. Mm! He ought to be just right to top off a good meal of corn.\"  \"My goodness!\" Master Meadow Mouse gasped. \"How annoying! He intends to eat me!\"  For a few moments Master Meadow Mouse wondered whether he ought to fight or run. \"I wish,\" he thought, \"that I'd brought my old sign with me when I moved to this new home. If I had hung it outside my door Fatty Coon wouldn't have bothered me. When he read that notice, 'Gone to lunch. Back To-morrow,' he would have shuffled off about his business.\" But idle thoughts and wishes were of no use at a time like that. Master Meadow Mouse soon realized that he must act--and act quickly.  \"Maybe I'll bite his nose,\" he said to himself. \"But I want to peep at him first.\"  So Master Meadow Mouse left his nest and crept a short distance until he could peer out from a chink between two cornstalks. In the moonlight he had a fine view of Fatty Coon. And as he stared at the intruder Meadow Mouse shuddered.  \"No!\" he exclaimed. \"No! I never could fight him. I wouldn't dare bite his nose. He's far, far too big for me to tackle.\"  There was no denying that Fatty Coon looked both huge and dangerous. Across his face was a black mask which only added to his horrid appearance. And through the mask his eyes shone green and greedy right into the frightened ones of Master Meadow Mouse.  One good look was enough for Master Meadow Mouse. He drew back hurriedly. Through his mind there flashed a saying of his mother's that he had not thought of for a long time: \"He that fights and runs away will live to fight another day.\"  \"I'll run first,\" Master Meadow Mouse decided. \"Then perhaps I shan't have to fight at all.\"  Then he stole out of the shock of corn, on the opposite side. And when Fatty Coon pawed his way through to the nest he found it empty.  He gave a wail of anger and dismay.  \"He's gone! The Meadow Mouse has gone!\" Fatty bawled. \"And I'll warrant he was a fat one, too. It's always the fattest ones that get away. And nobody can deny that this one was living high.\"  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  15  The Flood   \"THIS means another move for me,\" said Master Meadow Mouse. Fatty Coon had broken into the house in the shock of corn where Master Meadow Mouse had been living. And Master Meadow Mouse had fled.  Somehow he felt that a change of scene would be good for him. Although he had dwelt but a short time in the cornfield, he had no longer any desire to stay there. For Fatty Coon had given him a great fright. There was no denying that.  \"It seems as if I were always moving,\" Master Meadow Mouse mused. \"It's lucky for me the world is wide. Thank goodness there's plenty of places left where I can go. I've tried the meadow, Farmer Green's woodpile, the tangle beside the pasture fence and the cornfield. And now--now let me see! I believe I'll settle along Black Creek, under the bank.\"  He was talking with Long Bill Wren, who had a nest in a marshy spot near the creek.  \"Oh, don't make yourself a home under the bank!\" Long Bill cried. \"The fall rains will come soon. The creek is sure to rise. And then where will you be?\"  \"I'll be in the water, I suppose,\" Master Meadow Mouse answered.  \"Correct!\" said Long Bill Wren. \"And you want to avoid that. Maybe you've noticed that my wife and I built our nest off the ground. We fasten it to the reeds so we'll be dry, no matter if there's a freshet in midsummer.\"  \"Ah!\" Master Meadow Mouse exclaimed with a smile. \"I see you don't like water as much as I do. The fall rains won't trouble me. If the creek rises as high as my house it will be all the more fun.\"  Long Bill Wren gave him an odd look.  \"You're a queer one,\" he remarked. \"Anyhow, you can't say I didn't warn you. If there's a flood when the fall rains come, and you get drowned out, you can't say it's my fault.\"  \"Certainly not!\" cried Master Meadow Mouse. \"And I thank you for your kind advice. But I'm not going to be drowned out. I can swim.\"  Long Bill Wren shook his head.  \"I hope you'll escape,\" he said. \"I shall not be here to know whether you do or not. For we're starting for the South to-morrow. But I hope to find you safe and sound next May, when I return.\" And then he went home, to tell his wife that Master Meadow Mouse was a very daring young fellow.  Master Meadow Mouse built himself a house under the bank of Black Creek. And later the rain fell heavily for several days and nights, just as Long Bill Wren had expected. The creek rose fast. Yet Master Meadow Mouse didn't worry. When the water lapped at his doorway he only laughed. And when it caught at his house and bore it downstream Master Meadow Mouse held his fat sides and roared.  The flood brought much rubbish with it. But Master Meadow Mouse saw nothing that took his fancy until at last a floating board caught his eye.  Master Meadow Mouse swam out to it and scrambled upon it.  \"Hurrah!\" he squeaked as the board carried him along with the current. \"This is fine! I've got a raft. And I'll go a-traveling.\"  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  16  On the Raft   A BOARD was floating along on the swollen waters of Black Creek. On it sat Master Meadow Mouse. He was very happy. He was having his first ride, of any sort.  \"This raft--\" he said to himself proudly--\"this raft belongs to me. I'll be a traveler. I'll see the world--at least as far as the big willow at the lower end of the meadow!\"  He scarcely cared to go beyond the big willow. Beyond it lay another farm. And Master Meadow Mouse had never been off Farmer Green's place in his whole life. He feared that he might not be able to find his way back, if he ventured too far from home.  Soon he spied a friend on the bank of the creek. Master Meadow Mouse cried, \"Good-by!\" and waved a paw at him.  The person on the bank was one of his many cousins. And when he caught sight of Master Meadow Mouse he stared hard for a few moments. Then he shouted, \"Don't jump! I'll rescue you.\" He was already running to the water's edge when Master Meadow Mouse stopped him.  \"I don't want to be rescued,\" he called. \"I'm seeing the world.\"  His cousin hurried along the bank, still watching the strange sight.  \"It seems to me--\" he told Master Meadow Mouse--\"it seems to me that the world is seeing you. Where would you hide if Henry Hawk discovered you?\"  [Illustration: Master Meadow Mouse drifted toward Mr. Heron]  Master Meadow Mouse did not answer. To tell the truth, the question set him to thinking. He had to admit that it might be a bit awkward to find any cover in case somebody or other made a sudden swoop at him.  \"Oh, well!\" he said at last. \"It can't be helped. There's always _some_ danger in traveling--so I've heard.\"  His cousin on the bank had stopped running and now stood still and watched him anxiously until the raft had borne Master Meadow Mouse out of sight around a bend.  As the flood swung the craft toward the further side of the creek Master Meadow Mouse beheld a long-legged fisherman standing in the water. Not only did the fisherman have long legs. He had a long bill as well. And he was standing like a statue, waiting for a fish to swim past him. A fish, or a frog, or a mouse! He didn't care which.  Master Meadow Mouse knew him at once. He was Mr. Great Blue Heron--or plain \"G. B.\" as he preferred to be called. While Master Meadow Mouse gazed at him in horror Mr. Heron swiftly thrust his spearlike bill into the water. Even his head went out of sight for a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24872"],["title","The Tale of Master Meadow Mouse (#5)"],["body",".  Mr. Heron did not do that in order to cool his head. Ah, no! When he pulled his bill out of the creek a pickerel came with it. And the pickerel vanished very quickly down Mr. Heron's long neck.  It was not a nice sight for Master Meadow Mouse to see, especially when he was on a pleasure trip. Besides, he noticed with dismay that his raft was bearing him straight towards the fisherman.  \"If I only had some oars, or a rudder, I could steer this old raft away from him,\" Master Meadow Mouse thought. But he had nothing of the sort.  Master Meadow Mouse groaned.  \"I wish I'd never gone a-traveling!\"  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  17  A Lucky Escape   NEARER and nearer the board, with Master Meadow Mouse upon it, drifted around the bend of the creek toward Mr. Great Blue Heron. And at last Mr. Heron noticed it. And he noticed its passenger, too.  \"Ahem!\" he said softly to himself. Except for swallowing once or twice, he never made a move, but stood there in the water and waited. He waited for Master Meadow Mouse's raft to drift closer; for it was plain to him--as to Master Meadow Mouse--that the current of Black Creek was slowly bearing the board straight down upon him. \"When it gets near enough I'll just reach out and pluck that fellow off,\" Mr. Heron promised himself with a sort of silent chuckle.  Meanwhile Master Meadow Mouse was having a very bad quarter of an hour. Slowly though his craft moved, to him it seemed to travel with lightning speed.  \"I'll pass him soon,\" Master Meadow Mouse thought. \"If I crouch down and make myself as small as possible perhaps he won't see me.\"  So he hugged the board tight. But the closer he came to Mr. Heron the bigger and fiercer that gentleman looked.  Suddenly Master Meadow Mouse's courage oozed out through his toes. He couldn't stay on his raft another second. Springing to his feet, he scurried to the edge of the board and slipped off it into the water.  At his first move Mr. Heron moved too. He lifted his great wings and flapped them, tucking his legs under his body at the same time. A half dozen flaps carried him abreast of the floating board. And there Mr. Heron let his long legs down into the water until he stood again upon the bottom of the creek. He scanned the water eagerly, even plunging his head into it and looking all around. But he couldn't see Master Meadow Mouse anywhere.  \"This is queer,\" he mumbled. \"I knew those fellows were good swimmers. But I didn't think this one could get away from me so quickly.\"  Mr. Great Blue Heron waded about the creek for some time, searching everywhere--or almost everywhere. And while he was searching, the deserted raft swung off down the creek, hung for a few moments at the edge of the channel, and then drifted lazily toward shore, where it lodged at last among the reeds.  The disappointed fisherman returned to his fishing. But it seemed as if his luck had turned. Not another fish came his way. And being too wise to expect that another Meadow Mouse would come traveling down the creek on a raft, Mr. Great Blue Heron at last forsook his sport and sailed away through the air towards the lake on the other side of Blue Mountain.  He hadn't been gone a great while when Master Meadow Mouse might have been seen picking his way along the bank. He was journeying upstream, on his way home.  \"It was lucky for me--\" he explained to his cousin, whom he met later--\"it was lucky for me that I could swim under water. Otherwise I shouldn't have been able to hide beneath the board and stay there until it swung into the rushes.\"  \"You had a narrow escape,\" his cousin told him. \"Don't say that I didn't warn you!\"  That cousin was one of those persons that always exclaim, \"I told you so!\"  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  18  Under the Snow   WINTER had come. The snow lay deep over Pleasant Valley. But Master Meadow Mouse didn't object to that. On the contrary, he had welcomed the snow. Even Johnnie Green, peeping out of his chamber window at the first snowfall of the season, hadn't been any happier over it than Master Meadow Mouse was. To Johnnie Green the snow meant fun. To Master Meadow Mouse it meant fun and something more.  At last he could scamper about the meadow without being seen by everybody. For he set to work at once to make tunnels beneath the snow. They ran in every direction from his house. And he was forever pushing them further and further.  Through those tunnels Master Meadow Mouse could look for seeds and grain in the stubble. And while he was rambling along his network of halls he didn't have to worry about anybody's making trouble for him, unless it was Peter Mink, perhaps, or Grumpy Weasel.  Of course Master Meadow Mouse didn't stay under the snow all the time. Now and then he liked to climb up into the open air. And he made many shafts that led to the world above.  Although most of the birds had gone South to spend the winter, there were still some that Master Meadow Mouse had to shun. Old Mr. Crow was spending the winter on the farm. And there were Solomon Owl and his cousin Simon Screecher, who hunted over the meadow nightly. And at dusk sometimes a fierce hawk known as \"Rough-leg\" would beat his way back and forth across the snow covered stretches in the hope of catching one of the Meadow Mouse family unawares.  In spite of such unpleasant neighbors, the big Meadow Mouse family managed to have many a gay frolic under the stars on crisp winter nights. Sometimes Johnnie Green, wandering over the fields on snow-shoes by day, noticed a lacy tracery on the snow. It was the tracks of the tiny toes of Master Meadow Mouse and his dozens of cousins. At first Johnnie almost thought that he had stumbled upon the scene of a revel of fairy mice. He did not know then that the Meadow Mouse family had a village of their own right under his feet.  But Solomon Owl and Simon Screecher and old Rough-leg, the hawk, knew all about the habits of the villagers. In fact they sometimes complained about the way the Meadow Mouse family had built their tunnels. They agreed that there were too many holes leading down to the village streets. It gave the Meadow Mouse people too many openings into which to dive in case of a sudden surprise when they were having a moonlight party.  \"If they ever invited me to one of their affairs I wouldn't care what they did,\" Solomon Owl remarked one evening to his whistling cousin, Simon Screecher. \"If they'd welcome me just once to one of their dances I'd be satisfied.\"  \"It's plain that they don't like you,\" his cousin remarked.  \"Nor you, either!\" Solomon Owl boomed. And then all at once he burst forth with a peal of ghostly laughter. _\"Wha, wha, whoo-ah!_\"  Now, Master Meadow Mouse had just crept out of one of his doorways and was looking up at the stars when that shivery sound came rolling out of the woods. When he heard it he turned quickly and hurried back where he came from.  \"There won't be any fun to-night,\" he grumbled.  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  19  Owl Friends   \"THERE'S no sense in wasting our time here,\" said Solomon Owl to his small cousin, Simon Screecher. \"It's a fine night. The Mice will all be out sooner or later. Let's go over and sit in that old oak on the edge of the meadow!\"  Simon Screecher was more than willing. And they had no sooner settled themselves among the bare branches of the oak when Simon started to amuse himself by giving his well-known quavering whistle.  Solomon Owl stopped him quickly.  \"Don't do that!\" he said sharply. \"Do you want to scare the Mice?\" Simon Screecher cut his whistle off right in the middle of it.  \"I forgot,\" he murmured. \"But I don't believe my whistling would do any harm. I don't think there are many Mice left on Farmer Green's place. It's my opinion that they've moved away--most of them. Or maybe old Rough-leg, the Hawk, has caught more than his share. Anyhow, it's so long since I ate a Meadow Mouse that I've almost forgotten what they're like.\"  Solomon Owl made no reply. He was a person of few words. If anybody asked his opinion he was ready to give it. But he seldom gave any unsought advice.  \"I've about made up my mind,\" said Simon Screecher, \"that I'd move to some other neighborhood. If I knew where there was good mousing I'd move to-morrow.\"  While he was speaking, Solomon Owl started ever so slightly. And he cocked his head on one side, as if he were listening for something.  At that moment his cousin began to whistle again.  \"Be quiet!\" Solomon Owl thundered. \"If I'm not mistaken I heard a squeak. But no Meadow Mouse will ever venture out of doors if you're going to whistle.\"  \"I forgot,\" said Simon Screecher once more. \"I'm so used to whistling that I don't know when I'm doing it.\"  [Illustration: Solomon Owl and Simon Screecher wait for Master Meadow Mouse]  \"That's the reason why you can't catch more Mice,\" Solomon Owl snapped; for he was angry. \"There are dozens of Meadow Mice under the snow. But of course you can't surprise them if you tell them you're coming. You might as well send them a telegram, saying that you'll be on hand to meet them at eight P. M.\"  Simon Screecher was silenced for the time being.  And it wasn't long before Solomon Owl gave another start.  \"There's that squeak again!\" he whispered. \"I believe it is getting nearer, too.\"  Now, Master Meadow Mouse had a tunnel that led right beneath the tree where the two cousins were sitting. And he had strolled that way after scurrying under the snow when he heard Solomon Owl laughing in the woods earlier in the evening.  It was he that Solomon heard. It was he that stuck his head out of a hole in the snow and peeped up at the star-sprinkled sky.  Solomon Owl saw him. And he dived out of the old oak straight at Master Meadow Mouse.  Master Meadow Mouse pulled his head in just in time.  \"I didn't suppose that chap would be here as soon as this,\" he gasped. \"He must have hurried over here from the woods. He must be very hungry.\"  As Solomon Owl returned to the old oak his"]]]
