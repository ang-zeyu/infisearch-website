None of them, he knew, was completely satisfactory, but they all made more sense that the theory that Harris had done what the PD Police claimed he'd done.  Theory Number One: The real megalomaniac Controller had taken over Sir Lewis's mind and made him draw out the thousand pounds and head west on Leadenhall Street. Somehow, the Controller had found out that Sir Lewis was being followed, and had steered him away from the original destination, heading him toward the innocent Robert Harris. That implied that the Controller had been within a few dozen yards of the net men that afternoon. A Controller can't control a mind directly from a distance, although orders can be implanted which will cause a man to carry out a plan of action, even though he may be miles from the Controller. But in order to change those plans, the Controller would have to be within projection range.  Theory Two: Robert Harris actually was a megalomaniac Controller; with a long record of success behind him, who had finally grown careless.  At that point, Dorrine interjected a thought: _Isn't it possible that he wanted to be caught?_  Houston mulled it over for a minute. _A guilt-punishment reaction? He wanted to be punished for his crimes? I suppose that might account for part of it, yes. But if he'd been so successful, what did he do with all his money?_  Dorrine gave a mental shrug. _Who knows? What's Theory Number Three?_         *       *       *       *       *  Number Three was the screwiest one of all, yet it made a weird kind of sense. Suppose that Sir Lewis himself had had a grudge against Harris? The whole thing would have been ridiculously easy; all he'd have to do would be to act just as he had acted and then give evidence against Harris.  The thing that made it odd wasn't the actual frame-up (if that's what it was); these days, every crime was blamed on a Controller. A man accused of murder simply looked virtuous and said that he would never have done such a thing if he hadn't been under the power of a Controller. Ditto for robbery, rape, and any other felony you'd care to name.  An aura of fear hung over the whole Earth; each man half suspected everyone with whom he came in contact of being a Controller.  So it wasn't that the frame-up in itself was peculiar in this case; it was simply that it wasn't Sir Lewis Huntley's style. If Sir Lewis had wanted to get Harris, he'd have done it legally, without any underhanded frame-ups. Still, the theory remained as a possibility.  _I suppose it does_, Dorrine agreed, _but how does that tie in with our own Group? What about Jackson and Marcy? What happened to them?_  _I don't know_, Houston admitted, _I just don't know_.  Jackson and Marcy had been members of the Group of telepaths who had banded together for companionship and mutual protection. Both of them had been trapped by the PD Police in exactly the same way that Harris had been trapped. They were now where Harris would be in a matter of hours--in the Penal Cluster.  Their arrests didn't make sense, either; they had been accused of taking over someone's mind for the purpose of gaining money illegally--illegal, that is, according to the new UN laws that had been passed to supersede the various national laws that had previously been in effect.  But Houston had known both men well, and neither of them was the kind of man who would pull such a stunt, much less do it in such a stupid manner.  Dorrine thought: _Well, Dave, this Harris case is out of our hands now; we've got to concentrate on getting others into the Group--we've got to find the other sane ones._  _You're ready to take over here, then?_ he asked.         *       *       *       *       *  At the table, several yards away from where Houston was sitting, Dorrine, still looking at the book, smiled faintly.  _I'll have to; you're being transferred back to New York at six in the morning._  Houston allowed a feeling of startled surprise to bridge the gap between their minds. _How'd you know that?_ He hadn't told her, and she couldn't have forced the knowledge from his mind. A telepath can open the mind of a Normal as simply as he might open the pages of a book, but the mind of another Controller is far stronger. One telepath couldn't force anything from the mind of another; all thoughts had to be exchanged voluntarily.  She was still smiling. _We've got a few spies in the UN now_, she told him. _I got the information before you did._  _You knew before you left New York?_ he asked incredulously.  _That's right_, she thought. _The decision was made last night. Why?_  _Nothing_, he told her. _I was just surprised, that's all._ But deep behind the telepathic barrier he had erected against her probing mind, he was thinking something else. He had been assigned to London to capture the Controller--then unknown--who was said to be active in England. But his recall order had been decided upon _before_ Harris was caught--or even suspected. Someone in the UN Psychodeviant Police Supreme Headquarters in New York must have known that Harris would be caught that day!  _Something's bothering you_, Dorrine stated flatly.  _I was thinking about leaving London_, he replied evasively. _I haven't seen you for six months, and now I have to leave again._  _I'll be back in New York within three weeks_, the girl thought warmly. _I'll be--_  Her thoughts were cut off suddenly by a strident voice in Houston's ear. \"Attention; all-band notice. Robert Bentley Harris, arraigned this evening on a charge of illegal use of psychodeviant powers for the purpose of compounding a felony, has been found guilty as charged. He was therefore sentenced by the Lord Justice of Her Majesty's Court of Star Chamber to be banished from Earth forever, such banishment to be carried out by the United Nations Penology Service at the Queen's pleasure.\"  The words that were running through Houston's brain, had been transmitted easily to Dorrine. For a moment, neither of them made any comment. Then Houston glanced at his watch.  _Twenty-one minutes_, he thought bitterly. _What took them so long?_         *       *       *       *       *  High in the thin ionosphere, seventy miles above the surface of the Earth, a fifteen-hundred-mile-an-hour rocket airliner winged its way westward across the Atlantic, pushing herself forward on the thin, whispering, white-hot jets of her atomic engine. Behind her, the outdistanced sun sank slowly below the eastern horizon.  David Houston wasn't watching the sunrise-in-reverse; he was sitting quietly in his seat, still trying to puzzle out his queer recall to New York. When Hamilton had told him about it over the phone, he'd assumed that New York, having been notified that Harris had been captured, had decided to send for Houston, now that his job was over.  But now he knew that the order had come through nearly twenty-four hours before Harris was captured.  Did someone at UN Headquarters know that Harris was going to be captured? Or did someone there suspect that there was something odd about Police Operative David Houston?  Or both?  Whatever it was, Houston would have to take his chances; to act suspiciously would be a deadly mistake.  A stewardess, clad in the chic BOAC uniform, moved down the aisle, quietly informing the passengers that they could have coffee served at their seats or take breakfast in the lounge. The atmosphere of the plane's interior was filled with the low murmur of a hundred conversations against the background of the susurrant mutter of the mighty engines.  _Uhhh--uh--uh--dizzy--head hurts--uh--uh--_  The sounds in the plane altered subtly as the faint thought insinuated itself on every brain inside the aircraft. None of the Normal passengers recognized it for what it was; it was too gentle, too weak, to be recognized directly by their minds.  But David Houston recognized it instantly for what it was.  Somewhere on the plane, a Controller had been unconscious. _Had_ been. For now, his powerful mind was trying to swim up from the black depths of nothingness.  _Uh--uhhhh--uhh--_  The Normal passengers became uneasy, not knowing why they were disturbed. To them, it was like a vaguely unpleasant but totally unrecognizable nudge from their own subconscious, like some long-forgotten and deeply buried memory that had been forced down into oblivion and was now trying to obtrude itself on the conscious mind.  _Uhhh--Oooohh--where?--what happened?--_  A fully conscious telepath could project his thoughts along a narrow locus, focusing them on a single brain, leaving all other brains oblivious to his thoughts. Like a TV broadcasting station, he could choose his wavelength and stick to it.  But a half-conscious Controller sprayed his thoughts at random, creating mental disturbances in his vicinity. Like a thunderstorm creating radio static, there was no selectivity.  Savagely, David Houston did what he had to do. It might be a trap, but he had to avoid the carnage that might follow if this went on. He hurled a beam of thought, hard-held, at the offending mind of the awakening telepath.  _DON'T THINK! RELAX!_  Normally it was impossible for a Controller to take over the mind of another Controller, but these were abnormal circumstances; the half-conscious man, whoever he was, was weakened mentally by some kind of enforced unconsciousness--either a drug or a stun gun. Houston took over his mind smoothly and easily.  _Robert Harris!_  Houston recognized the mind as soon as he held it.  He didn't try to force anything on Harris's mind; he simply held it, cradling it, helping Harris to regain consciousness easily, bringing him up from the darkness gently.  In normal sleep, everyone's mind retains a certain amount of self-control and awareness of environment. If it didn't,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25061"],["title","The Penal Cluster (#4)"],["body"," noise and bright lights wouldn't awaken a sleeping person.         *       *       *       *       *  In normal sleep, a telepath retained enough control to keep his thoughts to himself, even when waking up.  But total anaesthesia brought on a mental blackout from which the victim recovered only with effort. And during that time, a Controller's mind was violently disturbing to the Normal minds around him, who mistook his disordered thoughts for their own.  Like pouring heavy oil on choppy waters, Houston soothed the disturbances of Harris's mind, focusing the random broadcasts on his own brain.  And while he did that, he probed gently into the weakened mind of the prisoner for information.  Harris was a Controller, all right; there was no doubt about that. But nowhere in his mind was there any trace of any knowledge of what had happened to Sir Lewis Huntley. If Sir Lewis had actually been controlled, it hadn't been done by Robert Harris.  Houston wished he'd been able to probe Sir Lewis's mind; he'd have been able to get a lot more information out of it than he had in his possession now. But that would have been dangerous; if Sir Lewis was a Controller himself, and had been acting a part, Houston would have given himself away the instant he attempted to touch the baronet's mind. If, on the other hand, Sir Lewis had actually been under the control of another telepath, any probing into the mind of the puppet would have betrayed Houston to the real Controller.  Harris knew nothing. He wasn't acquainted with any other Controllers, and had kept his nose clean ever since he'd discovered his latent powers. He knew that megalomaniac Controllers were either captured or mobbed, and he had no wish to experience either.  The Normals had long since discovered that the only way to overcome a Controller was by force of numbers. A Controller could only hold one Normal mind at a time. That was why a mob could easily kill a single Controller; that was why the Psychodeviant Police had evolved the \"net\" system for arresting a telepath.  Harris, then, had been framed. Or could it be called a frame-up when Harris was really guilty of the actual crime? Because the crime he had really been accused of was not that of controlling Sir Lewis, but the crime of being a telepath. That, and that alone, damned him in the eyes of the Normals; the crime of taking over a mind for gain was incidental. The stigma lies in what he _was_, not what he did.  Harris himself was in the bottom of the plane, in the baggage section near the landing gear. After his trial, still drugged, he had been secretly put aboard, to be taken to the Long Island Spaceport in New York. It had had to be secret; no Normal would knowingly ride on an aircraft which carried a Controller, even if he were drugged into total unconsciousness.  With Harris were two PD Police guards. Their low conversation impinged on Harris's ears, and was transmitted to Houston's mind.  Suddenly, one of them said: \"Hey! He's moving!\"  \"Better give him another shot, Harry;\" said the other, \"when those guys wake up, they drive you crazy.\"  Houston could almost feel the sting of the needle as it was inserted into the arm of the helpless prisoner.  Slowly, Harris's thoughts, which had begun to become fully coherent, again became chaotic, finally sliding off into silence and darkness.  \"Are you all right, sir?\"  Houston looked up from his intense concentration. The stewardess was standing by his seat. He realized that there was a film of perspiration on his brow, and that he probably had looked dazed while he was concentrating on Harris's mind.  \"Sure,\" he said quickly, \"I'm all right. I'm just a little tired. Had to get up too early to catch this plane.\" He rubbed his forehead. \"I do have a little headache; would you happen to have any aspirin aboard?\"  She smiled professionally. \"Certainly, sir. I'll get a couple of tablets.\"  As she left for the first-aid cabinet, Houston thought bleakly to himself: _Harris was framed. Possibly others have been, too. But by whom? And why?_  He could see why a Normal might do such a thing. But why would a Controller do it?  There was only one answer. Somewhere, there was a Controller, or a group of Controllers who were megalomaniacs _par excellence_. If that were so, he--or they--could make the late \"Blackjack\" Donnely look like a meek, harmless, little mouse.         *       *       *       *       *  The one part of Continental U.S.A. over which the American Government had no jurisdiction was small, areawise, in comparison with its power. The District of the United Nations occupied the small area of Manhattan Island which ran from 38th Street on the south to 49th Street on the north; its western border was Third Avenue, its eastern, the East River. From here, the UN ruled Earth.  There were no walls or fences around it; only by looking at street signs could anyone tell that they had crossed an international border. Crossing Third Avenue from west to east, one found that 45th Street had suddenly become Deutschland Strasse; 40th Street became Rue de France; 47th was the Via Italiano. 43rd Street's sign was painted in Cyrillic characters, but beneath it, in English, were the words \"Avenue of Mother Russia.\"  Third Avenue was technically One World Drive. Second Avenue was labelled as Planetary Peace Drive, and First was United Nations Drive.  But New Yorkers are, and always have been, diehards. Just as The Avenue of the Americas had forever remained Sixth Avenue, no matter what the maps called it, so had the other streets retained their old names in conversation.  Even the International Post Office, after years of wrangling, had given up, and letters addressed to _Supreme Headquarters, United Nations Police, 45th Street at Second Avenue_, were delivered without comment, even though the IPO still firmly held that they were technically misaddressed. And, privately, even the IPO officials admitted that the numbers were easier to say and remember than the polyglot street names that had been tagged on by the General Assembly.  So when David Houston signalled a taxi at Grand Central Station and said, \"Forty-fifth and Second,\" the driver simply set his automatic controls, leaned back in his seat, and said, \"Goin' to see the cops, huh?\"  When no answer was forthcoming, the driver turned around and took a good look at his passenger. \"Maybe you're a UN cop yourself, huh?\"  Houston shook his head. \"Nope. Some kids have been scribbling dirty words on my sidewalk, and I'm going to report it to the authorities.\"  The driver turned back around and looked ahead again. \"Jeez! That's serious. Hadn't you better take it up with the Secretary General? I wouldn't be satisfied with no underlings in a case like that.\"  \"I'm thinking of taking it up with the Atomic Energy Control Board,\" Houston told him. \"I think those kids are using radioactive chalk.\"  \"That's one way for 'em to get blue jeans,\" said the driver cryptically.  There was silence for a moment as the taxi braked smoothly to a halt, guided and controlled by the automatic machinery in the hood.  Then, suddenly, the driver said: \"Ship up!\" He pointed east, along 45th Street, toward Long Island. Far in the distance was a rapidly rising vapor trail, pointing vertically toward the sky, the unmistakable sign of a spaceship takeoff. They didn't leave often, and it was still an unusual sight.  Houston said nothing as he climbed out and paid the driver, tossing in an extra tip.  \"Thanks, buddy,\" said the driver. \"Watch out for them kids.\"  Houston didn't answer. He was still watching the vapor trail as the cab pulled away.         *       *       *       *       *  _There goes Harris_, he was thinking. _An innocent man, guilty of nothing more than being born different. And because of that, he's labelled as an inhuman monster, not even worthy of being executed. Instead, he's taken into space, filled full of hibernene, and chained to a floating piece of rock for the rest of his life._  Such was humanity's \"humane\" way of taking care of the bogey of Controllers. Capital punishment had been outlawed all over Earth; it had long since been proved that legalized murder, execution by the State, solved nothing, helped no one, prevented no crimes, and did infinitely more harm than good in the long run.  With the coming of the Controllers, a movement had arisen to bring back the old evil of judicial murder, but it had been quickly put down when the Penal Cluster plan had been put forth as a more \"humane\" method.  Hibernene was a drug that had been evolved from the study of animals like the bear, which spent its winters in an almost death-like sleep. A human being, given a proper dosage of the drug, lapsed into a deep coma. The bodily processes were slowed down; the heart throbbed sluggishly, once every few minutes; thought ceased. It was the ideal prison for a mental offender that ordinary prisons could not hold.  But it wasn't quite enough for the bloodthirsty desire for vengeance that the Normals held for the Controllers. There had to be more.  Following Earth in its orbit around the sun, trailing it by some ninety-three million miles, were a group of tiny asteroids, occupying what is known as the Trojan position. They were invisible from Earth, being made of dark rock and none of them being more than fifteen feet in diameter. But they had been a source of trouble in some of the early expeditions to Mars, and had been carefully charted by the Space Commission.  Now a use had been found for them. A man in a spacesuit could easily be chained to one of them. With him was a small, sun-powered engine and tanks of liquified food concentrates and oxygen. Kept under the influence of hibernene, and kept cool by the chill of space, a man could spend the rest of his life there--unmoving, unknowing, uncaring, dead as far as he and the rest of Mankind were concerned--his slight bodily needs tended automatically by machine.  It was a punishment that"]]]
