And after a while he'll grow tired of staying here and he'll go away.\"  Well, Rusty was half right, at least. For Jasper Jay went away at last; but he didn't wait until he had grown weary of his rowdyish sport.  Now, Johnnie Green happened to hear Jasper's harsh cries. And, looking out of the window, he saw Jasper's strange performance.  \"That blue jay is teasing my little wrens!\" Johnnie Green cried indignantly. And, catching up a potato from the kitchen table, he hurried to the door and hurled it as hard as he could at the blue-coated trouble-maker.  The potato missed Jasper Jay by less than an inch, bringing up _kerplunk!_ against the trunk of the old cherry tree, and breaking into several pieces.  And then it was Jasper Jay's turn to be alarmed. He jumped off the roof of Rusty Wren's house as if he had been shot and dashed off as fast as his handsome wings could carry him. He knew of no way to tease Johnnie Green; so there was really no sense in his staying in Farmer Green's yard any longer.  Johnnie jeered at Jasper as the frightened bully hurried away.  \"You'd better not come skulking around here again!\" he shouted.  Although the cherries hung red and juicy upon the old tree for at least a week longer, just begging to be picked--as one might say--Jasper Jay did not come back to enjoy them. He told Jolly Robin that he was entirely too busy to waste his time in an old cherry tree.     XIII  BOY WANTED!   It seemed to take Rusty Wren's wife a long time to recover from the fright that Jasper Jay had given her. He had amused himself by dropping cherries upon the roof of her house. But the trick had not amused the Wren family in the least.  Even after Johnnie Green had driven the blue-coated rascal away from the dooryard Mrs. Rusty Wren was all aflutter. She jumped at the slightest noise. And she was so nervous that Rusty soon saw that it was a great effort for her to go abroad for food for their hungry family.  \"You must stay right here at home and rest,\" he urged her. \"I'll find enough for the children to eat--and for you too,\" he said manfully.  And really there was nothing else that his wife could do; for her nerves were in a frightful state.  So Rusty Wren took up his task cheerfully. He found it no easy one, either. Feeding six growing youngsters had kept both their parents working every minute all day long, because the children were always clamoring for more food. And now they seemed half starved, for they had had nothing to eat all the time that Jasper Jay had kept Rusty and his wife hiding in their house.  Rusty Wren, however, was not one to complain, no matter what happened. And every day from dawn till dark he hurried out of the house to find some toothsome insect, and bring it home to drop it into somebody's yawning mouth.  Indeed, he was so busy feeding his family that he scarcely had a chance to eat anything himself. So he grew quite thin. And though he still sang as merrily as ever, his wife noticed the change that had come over him.  Naturally, that made her worry. And since worrying was bad for her nerves, she began to grow worse instead of better.  \"I don't know what's going to become of us,\" she said at last. \"As the children grow bigger they need more to eat. And I can see plainly that you're never going to be able to provide enough for them.\"  \"Oh! they'll soon be old enough to leave home and catch their own insects,\" Rusty told her hopefully. \"And until that time comes I'll manage somehow, even if I have to work after dark.\"  But that plan did not suit his wife at all.  \"I shouldn't care to stay alone in the house at night with six small children,\" she said. \"That will never do.\"  \"I have it!\" Rusty cried suddenly. \"I'll get somebody to help me!\"  Well, his wife didn't think much of that plan, either.  \"I don't like the idea of any strange bird coming into my house,\" she objected. \"And you know yourself that you've always felt the same way about strangers.\"  \"I know----\" he replied--\"but this is different. I'll find a brisk young fellow somewhere. And after a day or two you won't mind his being here. He'll seem just like one of the family.\"  It took a good deal of urging before Mrs. Rusty consented. But at last she said she was willing to give the plan a trial, though she felt sure it was bound to cause trouble, somehow.  So that is how Rusty Wren came to hang a sign outside his door, which said:                             BOY WANTED     XIV  TOO MANY CALLERS   The news of Rusty Wren's sign, \"Boy Wanted,\" spread like wildfire through the whole of Pleasant Valley. Rusty had put the sign out at daybreak. And before sunset as many as fifty of the field and forest people had come shyly to Farmer Green's dooryard.  Some of them came to apply for the position, and some of them merely wanted to see the sign--for it was a most unusual sight in that neighborhood.  There were others, too, such as Fatty Coon and Tommy Fox, who said that while they didn't care to visit Farmer Green's place in the daytime, they expected to call there during the night and take a look at Rusty Wren's home and the odd sign upon it.  Yes! So quiet a person as Rusty Wren, who never wandered far from home, had become famous in a day.  Yet it proved to be a very bad day for Rusty's family, because he had almost no time at all in which to try to bring home any food. No sooner had he talked with one caller than another knocked at his door. And so the steady stream of strangers kept him busy as a little red wagon, as Farmer Green would remark.  It was a discouraging business, to say the least. Though Rusty had advertised for a \"boy,\" persons of all ages appeared and wanted to work for him. Some of them were old enough to be his grandfather. And, what was worse, they were all so big that they couldn't squeeze through Rusty's little round door. (The hole in the syrup can, you will remember, was only slightly larger than a quarter of a dollar.)  Of course, there was no use of his hiring a helper that could do only half the work. What Rusty wanted was somebody that could not only catch an insect, but bring it right inside the house and drop it into the mouth of one of his children.  At last when Rusty had almost given up all hope of finding anyone of the required size, a young English sparrow flew up and said boldly that he was the very person for the position. He claimed that he could get in and out of Rusty's door without any trouble. And he was just about to prove his claim, too, when Rusty Wren stopped him.  \"Wait a moment!\" he told the sparrow. \"My wife is calling me. And I must see what she wants.\"  So he disappeared inside his house, to return shortly with a doleful look upon his face.  \"I'm afraid you won't do,\" he said to the young English sparrow.  \"Ha!\" cried the stranger impertinently. \"It's easy to see that your wife rules the house. And, since that's the case, I'm very glad I'm not going to work for you.\" He flew away then, with a jeering laugh which made Rusty Wren feel quite uncomfortable.  Now Mrs. Rusty had overheard the talk outside her door. And she had no intention of letting any rude, noisy English sparrow--even if he was a young one--come inside her house.  That was why she called to her husband. And she made the matter so plain that Rusty knew there was no use of trying to change her mind for her.  Things were growing worse and worse. The children were all _cheeping_ for food, until Rusty Wren could hardly endure the noise.  And he, too, felt painfully hungry.     XV  MR. CHIPPY'S SON   Rusty Wren was hurrying out of his house to find some supper for his family, when he almost bumped into a young chap who was gazing at the sign, \"Boy Wanted,\" which still hung outside Rusty's door.  He was a likely-looking lad, who wore a bay cap on his head. And he had excellent manners, too. He said \"Good-evening!\" to Rusty very pleasantly and touched his cap. No doubt he would have taken it off had it not grown right on his head. \"I see you want a boy,\" he observed.  \"I certainly do!\" said Rusty Wren. \"What's your name?\"  \"They call me 'Chippy, Junior,'\" the youngster told him.  \"Is that so?\" Rusty exclaimed. \"Then your father must be Mr. Chippy, who lives in the wild grapevine on the stone wall by the roadside.\"  Chippy, Jr., nodded brightly. And when he said, \"_Chip, chip, chip, chip_,\" Rusty knew that there could be no doubt about it.  \"Wait just a moment!\" he told Chippy, Jr. \"I want to speak to my wife about you.\" And then he darted back into his house.  \"My dear,\" he said to Mrs. Rusty, \"I've found the very person! Little Mr. Chippy's son is outside and I'm sure we ought to be glad to have a modest young man like him to help us.\"  \"He comes from a good family,\" Mrs. Rusty admitted. \"But don't you know that the Chippys are bigger than we are? Not much bigger, to be sure. But Mr. Chippy certainly couldn't get through our doorway.\"  \"Quite true, my love!\" Rusty Wren agreed. \"But it's his son--not _he_--that wants to work for us. And this young lad is not full grown. I should say he was hardly my size.\"  Though his wife hesitated, she could think of no further objection. So at last she told Rusty that he might ask Chippy, Jr., to come back early the next morning.  \"But I have a feeling that this is going to lead to trouble,\" she said once more. Rusty Wren said, \"Nonsense!\" He was overjoyed at the prospect of having a spry young helper. And he hurried out to tell Mr. Chippy's son that he might start to work at daybreak.  That polite young man touched his cap again, promised that he would return without fail, and then went _chip-chipping_ away toward home, for it was already his bedtime.  For all he was still hungry, Rusty Wren slept better that night than he had for a long while. He felt as if a great load had been lifted off his shoulders.  He "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25824"],["title","The Tale of Rusty Wren (#5)"],["body","so soundly, in fact, that he never waked up all when Fatty Coon and Tommy Fox came at midnight to view his sign, \"Boy Wanted.\"  They made a good deal of noise, too, grumbling not a little because there was not the least sign of a sign anywhere they looked.  As soon as he had engaged Chippy, Jr., to work for him, Rusty Wren had taken down the sign, \"Boy Wanted.\" And so all further callers were bound to be disappointed.     XVI  THE ACCIDENT   Chippy, Jr., proved to be a great success. Even Mrs. Rusty Wren had to admit, before he had finished his first day's work, that he was an agreeable person to have about the house.  \"Of course he isn't much of a singer,\" she remarked to Rusty, \"but he seems to have a quick eye for an insect, and he is kind to the children. He is very neat, besides. I have watched him sharply,\" she added, \"and I haven't caught him tracking any dirt into the house--nor brushing any off his clothes onto my clean floor, either.\"  Rusty, too, declared himself well satisfied with his helper.  \"He's a spry worker,\" he said. \"And he can get through our door as easily as I can. He went in and out of the house two hundred and fifty-seven times to-day; and not once did he get stuck in the doorway.\"  For several days everything went so smoothly in Rusty Wren's household that his wife began to feel more like herself again. Jasper Jay did not come near their house to annoy them; and there was plenty of food for all--thanks to the untiring efforts of Chippy, Jr. Though she tried her hardest, Mrs. Rusty couldn't think of anything to worry about. And her husband frequently remarked that it was a lucky day for all of them when he decided to hire a boy.  Both Rusty and his wife had quite forgotten the strange feeling of that good little lady's that some sort of trouble was coming to them on account of taking an outsider into their house.  So the days passed happily for them. And all the while their six children were fast growing bigger. The proud parents often remarked that they had never before known youngsters to change so rapidly.  So interested were Rusty and his wife in their children that they failed to see that Chippy, Jr., was growing likewise. Indeed, he now overtopped Rusty by half a head. But the Wrens--both husband and wife--entirely overlooked that fact.  Neither did they happen to notice that Chippy, Jr., was beginning to have a good deal of trouble squeezing through the door. For some reason--due, perhaps, to the way the opening was made--for some reason he could get into the house more easily than he could get out of it.  He said nothing about this new difficulty, not wishing to disturb the happiness of the Wren family, nor find himself out of work, either.  Since he continued to grow from day to day there could be but one outcome. And at last when Rusty came home late one afternoon with a plump insect in his bill he found Chippy, Jr., blocking the doorway. His head peered through the round opening. And his face wore a worried expression.  \"Hurry up!\" said Rusty Wren. \"I want to come in.\"  And at that Chippy, Jr., began to struggle to get out. But he couldn't move either forward or back.  \"Be spry!\" Rusty said impatiently. \"Don't keep me waiting, boy!\"  Chippy, Jr., looked actually frightened.  \"I'm stuck fast!\" he cried. \"I can't move either way!\"     XVII  HELP! HELP!   \"Help! help!\" Rusty Wren called loudly to his wife.  \"What's wrong?\" she screamed. Since she was inside the house, and Rusty was outside, with Chippy, Jr., blocking the doorway, of course she was alarmed--for she couldn't see her husband.  \"This boy's stuck fast in our door,\" Rusty cried. \"And you must help me move him.\"  \"Very well!\" she answered in a frightened tone. \"But if we can't stir him, I don't know what we'll do.\" And she began to shriek.  \"Don't worry!\" Rusty shouted. \"Just say when you're ready.\"  \"I'm ready now,\" she replied.  \"One, two, three--all together!\" Rusty Wren commanded. And he seized the head of Chippy, Jr., and began pulling as hard as he knew how.  Chippy, Jr., at once let out a frightened cry.  \"Stop! stop!\" he begged. \"I don't know what the trouble is, but I feel as if I should break in two!\"  \"Well! well!\" exclaimed Rusty Wren. And then to his wife he said: \"Were you pushing or pulling?\"  \"Pulling!\" she explained. \"I was tugging on his coat-tails.\"  \"Ah! That was the trouble,\" Rusty told poor Chippy, Jr., who looked quite distressed. \"I was trying to pull you out; and she was trying to pull you in. But you mustn't mind a little mistake like that.\"  \"Very well!\" said Chippy, Jr., meekly. \"But please don't do it again!\"  \"Now----\" Rusty directed his wife, so that she might understand clearly what was required of her--\"now you must push while I pull.\"  All their efforts, however, failed to move the unfortunate Chippy, Jr. He remained wedged tightly in the doorway. And at last Rusty declared that they might as well stop trying to get him through it.  \"What you must do now,\" he directed his wife, \"is to pull on Chippy, Jr.'s, coat-tails, while I push against his head. And in that way we may be able to clear our doorway.\"  That plan worked better. In a short time Mr. Chippy's unlucky son suddenly slipped backward, knocking Mrs. Rusty Wren flat on her back. And Rusty himself tumbled into the house and fell on top of the heap.  As soon as they had picked themselves up, Rusty Wren and his wife and Chippy, Jr., looked at one another for a few moments without saying a single word.  Mrs. Rusty was the first to break the silence--if a house may be said to be silent when there are six children in it, all clamoring for something to eat.  \"I knew we should have some sort of trouble if we took a stranger into our home,\" she wailed.  \"Why, what's the matter now?\" Rusty inquired in surprise.  \"Matter?\" she groaned. \"Here's this great lout of a boy inside our house! And we'll never be able to get rid of him. Instead of his helping us to feed our children, we shall have to feed him! And now we are worse off than we ever were before.\"     XVIII  THE PUZZLE   Rusty Wren looked quite crestfallen as he listened to his wife's wail. He wished that he had heeded her warning, when she declared that his hiring a boy would certainly lead to trouble.  \"What's the matter with you?\" Rusty asked his helper, Chippy, Jr. \"When you first came to work for us you could slip through our doorway easily enough. But now you're altogether too big.\"  Chippy, Jr., said that the entrance to their house must have shrunk.  \"How could it?\" Rusty demanded impatiently.  \"It rained last night,\" the youngster reminded him.  But Rusty Wren said, \"Nonsense! The doorway's made of tin--not wood. _You_ have grown--that's the whole trouble! And you've got us into a pretty fix.\"  \"I begin to think that it was all planned this way by his father,\" Mrs. Rusty told her husband, \"so Mr. Chippy wouldn't have to take care of his son. But I don't intend to adopt a big, overgrown boy like him--not when I have six small children of my own!\"  Chippy, Jr., couldn't help feeling both uncomfortable and unhappy.  \"I want to go home!\" he blubbered. \"It's almost my bedtime. And my father and my mother won't like it at all if I stay here all night.\"  \"Well,\" said Rusty Wren, \"I don't know how you're going to leave our house if you can't squeeze through the door. So I'll hurry over and tell your father about this trouble, and he can break the news gently to your mother.\"  Then Rusty went off, flying directly to the stone wall where the Chippy family lived. And soon he was explaining to Mr. Chippy how his son was inside their house and couldn't leave.  Now, Mr. Chippy was unusually mild mannered. But he became greatly excited as soon as he heard Rusty's story.  \"It's just like being caught in a trap!\" he exclaimed. \"And I can't help feeling that you've played a trick on my son--probably to please Johnnie Green.... If you don't set my boy free to-morrow morning at daybreak, I shall certainly make trouble for you.\"  Mr. Chippy's warning amazed Rusty Wren. But he couldn't help laughing at the idea of anybody causing him any _trouble_.  \"I'm so deep in trouble now,\" he told Mr. Chippy, \"there's nothing you can do to make matters any worse for me. I've six growing children to bring up; and now I have your son to take care of; and my wife thinks everything is my fault, because I wanted to hire a boy to help me catch insects.  \"So you can't scare me by your threats. I only wish you would come to my house and take your son away with you--if you can.\"  \"I'll come--and I'll tear your house down!\" Mr. Chippy cried fiercely. And he began screaming, \"_Chip, chip, chip, chip_,\" in a very shrill voice which was most annoying to hear.  Rusty Wren did not like to listen to him. So he flew back home and went to bed. He only wished that it were possible for Mr. Chippy to break into his house and rescue Chippy, Jr. But since the house was made of tin, Rusty knew that Mr. Chippy was helpless.  \"I'll never settle in a tin house again so long as I live!\" he groaned.     XIX  A FRIEND, INDEED   The next morning Rusty Wren awakened with a start. Somebody was pounding at his door--and shouting his name, as well. He jumped out of bed to see what was the matter. And, looking outside, he beheld Mr. Chippy, with sixteen of his cousins, all very much excited--if one might judge by their actions.  They were flying back and forth past Rusty's doorway and _chipping_ in shrill and piercing tones.  \"I've come for my son,\" Mr. Chippy informed Rusty Wren. \"Send him out here at once or it will be the worse for you.\"  \"I'd be glad to get rid of him if I could,\" Rusty answered. \"But, as I explained to you last night, he has grown so big that he can no longer pass through my doorway.\"  \"I don't care to argue with you?\" Mr. Chippy replied. \"Just let me have Chippy, Jr., or we'll come inside your house and get him. We'll make trouble for you, too. Perhaps you didn't know that kidnapping a child is a very serious"]]]
