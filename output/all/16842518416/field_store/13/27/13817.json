The aërial wires were on masts two hundred and ten feet high.  \"As an aërial Guglielmo sent up a large kite made of bamboo and silk, flown on a wire, of course; the wind increased, snapping the wire and blowing the kite into the ocean. Thereupon Guglielmo used a balloon filled with hydrogen gas and sent it up when the weather was clear, but the balloon broke away and disappeared.  \"It was on December 12, 1901 that he sent up another kite. This held at an elevation of nearly four hundred feet, and then, after having cabled his assistants to begin sending certain signals previously agreed upon, at a certain hour in the afternoon and continuing until night, Guglielmo made allowance for the difference in time and sat with the telephone receiver at his ear, listening, wondering, hopeful. It must have been a moment of almost painful expectation. He looked out from his position high on the cliff and could see the dim, rocky outlines of Cape Spear, the most eastern point of the North American continent. Beyond this rolled the blue Atlantic, two thousand miles across which was the coast of the British Isles. Only two persons were present in the old barrack-room besides the inventor. There were no reporters--no one had been apprised of the attempt. Marconi's faith in the success of his experiment was unshaken. He believed from the first that he would get signals across the great stretch of ocean.  \"Suddenly there was the sharp click of the instrument that could only come from some electric disturbance; but it was not the signal. Marconi, without excitement, asked Mr. Kemp, the assistant, to take the telephone receiver connected with the instrument and listen for a time. A moment later, faintly, yet distinctly and unmistakably, came the three clicks indicating the dots of the letter S, according to the Morse code, the signal that had been agreed upon with the assistants on the English coast. A few minutes later more signals came and the inventor and his assistant assured themselves again and again that there could be no mistake. Thus was tested successfully one of the great scientific discoveries.  \"Then the achievement was given to the public, after two days of repeated signaling. The honors that were at once heaped upon Marconi would have turned the head of anyone less modest and sane. From every quarter of the world came plaudits. The cable company, fearing injury to its business, demanded that he cease operations in its territory, which was a high compliment, indeed. The people of the Colony of Newfoundland honored him, wondering at his youth; he was then only twenty-seven, but an experimenter of wide knowledge.  \"Such was the practical achievement upon a great discovery reached by Marconi the Italian and now, more correctly, the cosmopolitan. Though he still makes his home in his native land, he belongs to all countries, to all oceans, for it is everywhere now that his great discovery is made use of. No need for me to mention the present day uses of wireless telegraphy and radio communication aided greatly by the inventions of others. But it is to Marconi these owe their initial adoption.\"                                     CHAPTER X                                  A MESSAGE   A round of applause was given the Italian lad as he was about to leave the platform. Suddenly Tony stopped and held up his hand for silence.  \"You must not--ah, applaud to me for this speaking. I have the inspire to do it, yes, but not the words entire. So it is my friend Brown who set me correct on the words and the speeching. We are then both equally the speechers, my friend Bill Brown and I.\"  The applause was continued now,--a goodly number appreciated the honesty of this declaration. Tony had taken his seat. The president arose and began to talk again, but could not be heard for some mischief-making students who kept up the racket.  Gus leaned over and spoke to Tony and then to Bill. Without more ado Bill got up, grabbed Tony's hand and the two got out on the floor, faced about and bowed. The clapping took a spasmodic leap and ceased.  Bill pushed Tony away from him and limped back several feet. Then he put his hollowed fist to his mouth and shouted into it:  \"This is broadcasting station P D Q! I hope you are listening in!\"  Tony caught the idea at once and put his hand to his ear. Bill continued:  \"Strikes me this crowd here is crazy! A noisy bunch! Maybe they think we're candidates for mayor, or something! This radio business is some pumpkins; eh, boy? I'd radiophone you a message in Italian, only I've left my dictionary at home! Well, I guess they've looked at us long enough now, so let's switch off!\"  Amid laughter, the boys returned to their seats.  \"This is a gala occasion,\" said Doctor Field, \"and you must bear with the exuberance of our youthful enthusiasts. We have one other interesting experience for you, demonstrating the wonders of radio. Now, then, Mr. Sabaste, if you will----\"  Tony and Gus quickly left the room. Presently, through the open door and from above, sharp, cracking sounds something like miniature pistol shots were heard. There was also a droning buzz and the sound of a loud speaking voice, the words unrecognized. The president added:  \"Mr. Sabaste is now broadcasting a message, in Italian, to the yacht _Elettra_, outside New York harbor. He previously appointed this hour to send such a communication to none other than _Signor_ William Marconi, asking him for a message to our school. We hope Sabaste may be successful.\"  In a few moments the sounds from the transmitter in the broadcasting room ceased. There came a brief period of expectant silence, some of the audience staring about uncertainly, others more intelligently looking at the big horn of the receiver on the platform table. The time lengthened. It threatened to grow a little tedious. Then as Tony and Gus hastily appeared in the doorway, the sound of a human voice and good, clear English words emanated from the horn.  \"The yacht _Elettra_, Marconi speaking. My young friend, the son of my friend Sabaste, now a citizen of America, has asked me to send a word of greeting to the Marshallton Technical College,--I hope I have the name correctly. I confess my being called on seems rather unusual, but yet I am glad to be able to communicate with an American educational institution, especially one devoted to physical knowledge, mechanics and electricity.  \"It is not unlikely you have among your students some future great inventors--perhaps some Edison, Bell or Morse--time will only determine this. America is a nation of inventors--the leaders in this mechanical age. Study, close application, the not too stringent adherence to formulæ and old methods are bound to win. Inspiration, vision, the seizing of opportunities to improve, the wish to gain something desired--these are the keynotes to success in the field of mechanical endeavor and scientific discovery. In the words of one of the greatest Americans who had visions and did things: 'It is up to you.' I wish your school and its students every success.\"  The voice in the horn ceased to be heard. There was a moment of breathless silence, as everyone in the audience, with attention riveted on the radio receiver, listened for other words to follow. Then once again the Doctor was on his feet.  \"We shall later radio our gratitude to Mr. Marconi for this kind and helpful message which is a fitting climax to our wireless celebration. We feel that our students have been benefited and inspired and we hope you have all been entertained. Good night.\"                                    CHAPTER XI                               FEUDAL FOOLERY   There seemed to be a dissatisfying influence, a feeling perhaps akin to envy, or at least as offending class pride in the sentiment that arose among a certain clique concerning Bill Brown. The boy had become popular and it was thought by some unduly, or somewhat undeservedly so. Bill's classmates had not shown this tendency, or if so individually it was not made evident. But to certain older fellows, that a mere freshman should so shine both in the opinion of teachers and the student body generally, seemed most inconsistent.  Siebold, the moving spirit of wholesome mischief among the upper classmen, seemed to be the chief instigator of the tendency to belittle Bill, aided by one Luigi Malatesta, a Sicilian. Siebold never had forgiven Bill and Gus for the electrical trap sprung on his hazing party. He had a certain following that shared most of his opinions and plans.  Malatesta was also a soph, with a very decided penchant for getting into trouble and showing temper. It might have been expected that between the only two natives of Italy in the school there would be at least some fraternal feeling, but these lads appeared instinctively to avoid each other, and Tony's being a senior, made this easily possible on his part. Malatesta, seeing that Bill and Gus were both exceedingly friendly with Tony, seemed to take especial pleasure in making contemptuous remarks concerning all three, or in making offensive, insulting gestures that they could not help seeing. At first this was altogether puzzling because the motive was not apparent. It became more evident, however, following an incident.  Bill and Tony were coming from the school library, to be followed later by Gus, who remained to add some notes. The subject with which they were all wrestling covered voltmeter tests and relative amperage, principally with regard to battery construction. The boys were building their own batteries and must make no mistakes.  Bill was thumping along, talking, and Tony listening, as usual. They came through the double swinging doors of the dormitory on the way to the shop and passed a small group of upper classmen in the hallway, Malatesta among them, holding forth. The two went down the basement stairway, a door closed behind"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25753"],["title","Radio Boys Loyalty; Or, Bill Brown Listens In (#7)"],["body"," and they were alone. Tony stopped.  \"I may ask you, _mio amico_, you did see that fellow, my countryman, up there?\"  Bill nodded, wondering.  \"Well, it is so,\" continued Tony, \"that he watches us--you because of me, and me because of--to tell you it is something, shall I? Yes, it will give me satisfy. That Malatesta--Luigi his name it is--why you think he comes on this school? I will say he comes to spy to me. Perhaps you think this is absurd quite, but not so. In Italy his people and my people are at fighting--no, you call it 'scrap,' eh? We make war, by family. My mother's people, one of the years long ago, kill one of this fellow's people at the town _festa_ and they seek to kill all her people and my father's people take no part--know nothing. But when my father meet my mother and they are declared to marry, then the Malatesta fight with him and his people. Is it not strange and very ridiculo?  \"And now I am come to the family war because no more longer a little child and this Luigi he swear he look after me here in America, and already I see the poniard lifted to strike at my breast, but I shall dodge and then maybe use my own, though hating the vendetta--feuds. Why shall all this be? How have I made anger and strife with these assassins? But to reason with them is to invite a more insult than death. You understand my telling?\"  \"Sure I do,\" said Bill. \"It is what we call in this country a feud, but it is rotten. Why don't you go to the Doctor and----\"  \"Oh, no! My friend Bill, you cannot intend so. That would be poltrone--coward! We fight without people stopping--to end, if must be.\"  \"But a fellow like that--to come to school here just----\"  \"Oh, but he is smart, Luigi Malatesta, and to him learning is also good, though some of his people are low and many years ago they were of the banditti. And some were of the boat builders and some were rich.\"  The boys had reached the shop and were still alone. Bill forgot his loved problems in trying to comprehend this state of affairs.  \"But I can't understand how such a thing could really be,\" he said. \"We have the black hand, it is true, but----\"  \"Ah, no, this the black hand is never!\" declared Tony. \"This is of families--not to rob, though maybe they do rob in time and ask of ransoms. Such was done by some Malatesta of my mother's cousin and he was lost to us, never returning.\"  \"But, confound it, Tony, here he wouldn't dare----\"  \"Here he will dare more than in Italy, because there all who make family wars are suspect and many such quit and have become friends when time goes, but other forgetta never. This Luigi he forgetta never, and maybe you will see. We--my father thought we had left behind this fighting, but to this country also come Malatesta, for small is the world and large is hate.\"  Bill pondered this and turned to his work, but dropped his tools in a moment, explaining to Tony that there were other figures they must have for calculating the strength of the battery and he would go back and tell Gus.  Bill reached the basement stairs, and in an alcove, alone, as though seeking to hide, was the fellow Luigi. He turned sharply, facing Bill and glaring in evident resentment at the latter's broad, curious stare. Then the Sicilian spoke:  \"Well, you see me. I it is, freshman. Stare at me some more as if I were something to step on and I will give you more reason to stare.\"  \"What's the matter with you, you, you--\" demanded Bill, stopping short and much incensed.  \"Ah! Wop? Guinea? Dago? Sphagett--so I am insulta--is it? And by a short-leg!\"  \"I'd rather have short legs than short brain.\"  \"I like you so well I smash you in the face!\"  Suiting the action to the word Luigi advanced upon Bill, who turned and swung his crutch menacingly.  What then would have occurred it is impossible to surmise, for the crippled boy was handy with the familiar implement that so readily could be used as a weapon, though the Italian was sturdier, heavier and much older--in fact, although small, he was almost a man.  But just at the moment there was a quick, descending footfall on the stair and the door opened. Gus, with wide eyes, stared at the near and unequal combatants.  \"Hold on!\" said the big fellow, glaring. The Italian hesitated, though but for a moment. \"You wouldn't really hit a fellow who is lame, would you?\"  \"Ah, get away! Go off!\" snarled Malatesta, attempting to thrust Gus aside as the strapping youth stepped in front of him. But the thrust was futile and then Luigi, growing furious, struck at Gus a powerful blow. The fellow was muscular and quick, but there was no thought behind the blow. And there was in contrast a smile on the face of the easy, athletic American.  The Italian's fist was clutched by a ready hand, much as a baseball would have been caught, and then a very differently directed fist shot out and came in contact with Luigi's upper stomach--he got that generally final solar plexus blow. Luigi gave a soft, aching grunt and sank to his knees, then to his elbows and rolled over on his side, in a half-minute more sitting up and gazing around, but still in pain. He was again alone.                                    CHAPTER XII                                    TESTS   \"I suppose now we'll all get blown up, or poisoned, or something,\" Bill said to Tony, after telling of the eclipse of Luigi Malatesta.  \"Oh, no; the Malatesta are foemen worthy of our steel, to agree by an English poet; is it not?\"  \"'Foeman worthy of a steal,' I guess you mean,\" laughed Gus.  \"Yes, that's more like it. I wouldn't trust that pig-faced villain across a ten-acre lot with a ten-cent piece!\" declared Bill.  \"The soul of honor doesn't dwell in a husky guy who'd strike a cripple,\" said Gus. \"And I bet a cow he's going to stir up more trouble around here before he quits maneuvering.\"  Tony made no reply, but stood for a long time, gazing at the floor. Presently only the sound of tools and machines was heard in the shop.  It is not probable that Luigi told of the precise outcome of his clash with Bill and Gus, though he may have said enough to influence sophomore sentiment against Bill's standing in the school. At any rate, the feeling grew in strength and spread until it became a subject of comment among freshmen and seniors who were inclined to sympathize with the brainy and keen-witted lame boy. At least he had many friends, both high and low, and most of the teachers admired him openly.  So far the sentiment had been rather more doubtful and erratic than determined. There had been nothing to warrant the assumption that Bill thought himself more intelligent than the sophomores, or members of his own class. His radio knowledge was somewhat a thing apart and in that he shared with the less obtrusive Gus.  And then the lightning struck, suddenly and hard. Once each week an outsider from the engineering department of some big industrial plant, or large university, lectured to the entire student body of the Marshallton Tech in the assembly-room, and there were some of these talkers who got much pleasure out of it. Not only was it interesting to hold forth to a lot of eager, responsive boys on subjects that elicited their curiosity, as the building of great dams and bridges, the tunneling under mountains, the erection of mighty machines, but it was also diverting to hear their various comments which also led to a comparative estimate of their understanding.  Davidson, chief mechanical engineer of a great mill building corporation, was especially interested in the personal equation concerning the students, particularly after Bill Brown bad asked him a lot of questions, some of which he had replied to rather lamely. Even more as a matter of getting back at this young investigator who sat with a crutch held before him and regarded these replies with a smile than for the desire to measure minds, Davidson gathered a few catch problems that were stumpers, and upon his third visit, after talking awhile he switched off on the subject of problems, short cuts to solutions and then put a question, looking hard at Bill, as though uttering a challenge.  \"Now, how would you go about it,\" he shot at his audience, \"if you were asked to measure the cubic contents of an electric light bulb?\"  A number of smiles greeted the question; these may have been from lads mostly in the advanced courses who knew the trick. The lecturer asked for hands to be raised by those who thought they could do it, and noting with satisfaction that the crippled boy was not among the number who responded, he began hearing them, one at a time.  \"Measure it outside and allow for the thickness of the glass,\" said one fellow.  \"But how about the carbon inside?\" asked Davidson.  \"Break the glass and measure the loop,\" called out a soph.  \"How many of you would go at it in that way?\"  A number of hands went up, some rather reluctantly, as though their owners scented a trick.  Davidson still eyed the cripple. \"How would you do it?\" he asked.  Bill shook his head and said, \"It is that old trick of Edison's and it's dead easy. I guess a good many of our fellows know about it. You simply punch a hole in the bulb, fill it with water, pour it back and measure the water.\"  \"Yes; that's right. It is really the only sure way,\" said the man, his manner showing disappointment.  \"Oh, no; it isn't, begging your pardon. Oh, no, not the only way,\" said Bill.  \"Well, now, how else----\"  \"Put water in a graduated glass, stick the bulb in up to the plaster seal and note the increase. Then break the glass and the carbon and put that in separately, deducting the last amount from the first.\"  Davidson scratched his head. \"Yes; that would do it, of course, too, but----\"  \"But you said the other was the only way,\" insisted Bill.  \"Oh, well, the only quick and sure way. Of course, there are other methods.\"  \"I'm sorry to have to disagree with you, but my method is just as sure and quicker.\"  \"It might do--it might do! You seem to be ready with short"]]]
