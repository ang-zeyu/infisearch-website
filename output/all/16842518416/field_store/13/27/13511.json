What right would he have had, as a just man, to bestow his generosity upon the public, by refusing the emoluments of office, justly due him, and unjustly appropriating the proceeds or avails of the labor of his slaves, if he knew, or believed they were justly entitled to their freedom. If our moral view of slavery is clear, he was _just_, as well as _generous_, and wise as well as successful.   WASHINGTON REPROACHES THE EMANCIPATIONISTS.  It is well known how powerful the secret influence of the British and Tory abolitionists was in this country immediately after the American Revolution, as well as before and since that time; and that at about that time, or soon after, the question was seriously entertained of abolishing slavery in Virginia by legislation, as was done in other States of the Union; and it was on account of the annoying importunities of these _disinterested philanthropists_ (_?_), and the apparent inclination of the people of the State of Virginia to experiment in their theories, that Washington expressed his willingness to see slavery abolished by legislative enactment. But in what characteristic terms of manly reproach did he address the Emancipation Society on the subject when he found their principles and practices to be that \"_the end justifies the means_.\" He says:  \"_But when slaves, who are happy and contented with their present masters, are tampered with and seduced to leave them; when masters are taken unawares by these practices; when a conduct of this kind begets discontent on one side, and resentment on the other; and when it happens to fall on a man whose purse will not measure with that of the Society, and he loses his property for want of means to defend it,--it is oppression in such a case, *AND NOT HUMANITY IN ANY*, because it introduces more evils than it can cure._\"[6]   OUR FATHERS ON THE RIGHT OF SLAVERY.  It is not to be concealed, however, that some of the sages who framed this Republic, in their zeal for freedom, overlooked the fact of African barbarism, or failed to be explicit in their unpremeditated enunciations of human freedom. Perhaps, however, they had more astuteness than has been supposed by some. Perchance they considered barbarity not humanity, but its opposite, and would have deemed it a work of supererogation to explain that which natural history, the history of the African ram for four thousand years, and common sense, and common observation, had established as a self-evident proposition; to wit, that equality was a _political_, and not a social, nor moral, nor even physical condition; and that, especially, neither equality nor freedom were to be construed to be the prerogatives nor the right of barbarism. And the Constitution of the United States, the work of their own hands, sanctions this supposition, by recognizing the existence, and providing for the right of Negro slavery, and rescues the Fathers of the Republic from the absurd and opprobrious imputation of advocating Negro equality. Whatever opinions they may have expressed under the varying aspects of our Revolutionary epoch, the Constitution of these United States was the finality of their arduous toils, heroic achievements, and sublime wisdom; and that Constitution, the very sublimation and quintessence of a hundred civilizations, exhibiting the onward progress of the human race, recognizes the Right of Slavery, founded upon the immutable principles of justice.   MONARCHICAL SCHEMES TO DESTROY THIS REPUBLIC.  Is it strange, however, that since this Republic is the mighty antagonism of monarchy, and since it is invincible in arms, is it strange, that civil dissension, and the appropriate means to produce it, should be employed by despotism to subvert this government? What else should they do; What is the interest of monarchy in relation to the existence and onward progress of this Empire of Freedom? What, but its subversion, its disseverment, by its own internal antagonism? And what other means could monarchy and its parasites employ to accomplish this, but precisely the means and agency which have been employed, at vast expense, especially for the last twenty-five years, first to divide, and finally to destroy that which no external force, nor combination of external forces could subdue? Is it not already the boast of the minions of despotism that they have rendered our government insecure? With what jubilation did they catch the tidings of our recent rebellion, as the harbinger of their own redemption from the fate of political decadence and downfall, which our all-absorbing greatness was beginning to make so manifest to the willing apprehension of mankind? Their ears were charmed, even at the supposed triumphant voice of barbarism over a civilization as stable as the sun, which is immortal in its every individual microcosm, and to which they are conscious their own unequal systems of government never can attain.   OUR VINDICATION.  Need we inquire further what is the interest of monarchy? Can we any longer be blind to our own interest? Are we not arraigned at the tribunal of civilization, by the helots of despotism? Are we not accused of wrong? Are not we, and our sainted and godlike ancestors, held as amenable to moral law for a violation of Right? And shall we submit in silence to all this clamor: this false and slanderous accusation, when all history, all knowledge, all experience, all reason, and all nature, are voluble in our defense, and pronounce our just and triumphant vindication!  Let us, then, henceforth cultivate and encourage friendship and cordial co-operation between the different sections of the Union, and a patriotic emulation for its continuance; not upon any such visionary and deceptive hypothesis as the superiority and predominance of sectional partiality, but upon the equable and fundamental principles of justice, and of the absolute equality of these sovereign States, and the equality of the citizens of a well-compacted and glorious confederacy.   THE PHILOSOPHICAL POSTULATES OF AMERICAN SLAVERY.  1. Right holds a just and heaven-derived supremacy over wrong.  2. Barbarism is wrong. It conduces to the misery and degradation of mankind. Africa is barbarous. The African race is a race of barbarians.  3. Civilization is right. It conduces to the elevation and happiness of mankind.  4. Civilization carries with it the right of supremacy over barbarism.  5. It is right to summon the barbarian to the lessons of civilization, and to teach him its _primary_ lessons; to elevate him to the dignity of labor.  6. It is right to HOLD the barbarian subject to the rules of civilization; to protect him by its laws, and rescue him from the wrongs and miseries of barbarism. In this way, only, he can be made happier and better. He falls, if unsupported by external power.  7. American Slavery promotes civilization by the production of materials wherewith to clothe the nakedness of mankind, and the useful medium or knowledge and intelligence, through books, and literature, printed upon materials which are the product of slave labor.  8. It is just that barbarism should subserve civilization; that Wrong should subserve Right.  9. The African is not equal to the white man, but is a barbarian, and as such has no political rights.  10. American Slavery is Right.   CONCLUSION.  If, then, it is not right, nor practicable, nor possible, to restore these 4,000,000 of Africans to barbarism, why any longer agitate the subject? Why keep the negro in perpetual dread of change, and the owner dubious of the future? Why, by this negro agitation, create apprehension in the minds of our own people for the stability and permanence of this government, and hope in the minds of all the monarchists of the world that this agitation will divide and destroy this last great bulwark of human freedom?  Why shall we put to hazard that freedom which is already secure? Why involve in experiments those tangible acquisitions which we have made to this priceless inheritance of freedom? Washington is gone, but he has left us his bright example, and his solemn admonitions. Let those who are greater, and wiser, and purer than Washington, impeach him. Let those whose precepts or examples excel his, question the superiority of his virtue and valor. Let those who have done more for human freedom, denounce him as the enemy of mankind, and erect for themselves a standard of moral action, which shall rise to the stupendous height of their own boundless egotism!  But if it is found to be inexpedient and wrong to agitate the subject of slavery, when it is known to be impracticable, impossible, and unjust to emancipate the slaves, then let us go on in our career of greatness, with success and tranquility. Let us watch with jealous care the honor of our country, and scorn the aspersions of its vilifiers. Let us honor and vindicate our country in its attitude of justice, and in its mission of civilization, and mark with the imputation of opprobrium every recreant defamer of our government and its institutions. Let the emissaries of despotism find some other means of subduing us than to \"divide and conquer.\" Let the name of Washington be revered; let his admonitions be heeded: let his commands be obeyed, and his example followed. Let barbarism still be blessed with the light of civilization; let the glory and dominion of freedom be established, and the citizens of this Republic rest in security and peace within their patriarchal bowers!         *       *       *       *       *  FOOTNOTES:  [1] Leo Africanus says, Book vii., \"The King of Borno sent for the merchants of Barbary, and willed them to bring the great store of horses; for in this country they used to exchange horses for slaves, and to give fifteen and sometimes twenty slaves for one horse; and by this means there were abundance of horses brought; howbeit, the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25281"],["title","Briefless Ballads and Legal Lyrics (#0)"],["body","BALLADS     BY THE SAME AUTHOR    SIMPLE STORIES OF LONDON    VERSES SUITABLE FOR RECITATION      _Crown 8vo, cloth, price 1s. 6d._    ETHANDUNE    AND OTHER POEMS      _Crown 8vo, cloth, price 2s. 6d._                        BRIEFLESS BALLADS                           AND                       LEGAL LYRICS                       SECOND SERIES                      BY JAMES WILLIAMS    \"You will think a lawyer has as little business with  poetry as he has with justice.

Maine, Blackstone, Sandars, all were there,       And Hallam's _Middle Ages_,     And Austin with his style so rare,       And Poste's enticing pages.      We started well: the little inn       Was deadly dull and quiet,     As dull as Mrs. Wood's _East Lynne_,       Or as the verse of Wyatt.      Without distraction thus we read       From nine until eleven,     Then rowed and sailed until we fed       On potted char at seven.      Two hours of work! We could devote       Next day to recreation,     Much illness springs, so doctors note,       From lack of relaxation.      Let him read law on summer days,       Who has a soul that grovels;     Better one tale of Thackeray's       Than all Justinian's novels.      At noon we went upon the lake,       We could not stand the slowness     Of our lone inn, so dined on steak       (They _called_ it steak) at Bowness.      We wrestled with the steak, when lo!       Rose Jack in such a hurry,     He saw a girl he used to know       In Suffolk or in Surrey.      What matter which? to think that she       Should lure him from his duty!     For Jack, I knew, would always be       A very slave to beauty.      And so it proved, alas! for Jack       Grew taciturn and thinner,     Was out all day alone, and back       Too often late for dinner.      What could I do? His walks and rows       All led to one conclusion;     I could not read; our work, heaven knows,       Was nothing but confusion.      Like Jack I went about alone,       Saw Wordsworth's writing-table,     And made the higher by a stone       The \"man\" upon Great Gable.      At last there came a sudden pause       To all his wanderings _solus_,     He learned what writers on the laws       Of Rome had meant by _dolus_.      The Suffolk (was it Surrey?) flirt       Without a pang threw over     Poor Jack and all his works like dirt,       And caught a richer lover.      We read one morning more to say       We had not been quite idle,     And then to end the arduous day       Enjoyed a swim in Rydal.      Next day the hundredweight of books       Was packed once more in cases,     We left the lakes and hills and brooks       And southward turned our faces.      Three months, and then the Oxford Schools;       Our unbelieving college     Saw better than ourselves what fools       Pretend sometimes to knowledge.      Curst questions! Jack did only one,       He gave as his opinion     That of the Roman jurists none       Had lived before Justinian.      I answered two, but all I did       Was lacking in discretion,     I reckoned guardianship amid       The _vitia_ of possession.      My second shot was wider still,       I held that _commodata_     Could not attest a prætor's will       Because of _culpa lata_.      We waited fruitlessly that night,       There came no blue _testamur_,[A]     Nor was Jack's heavy heart made light       By that sweet word _Amamur_.  [A] Since the above was written, the _testamur_, like many other institutions dear to the old order of Oxford men, has been superseded.     A Vision of Legal Shadows       A case at chambers left for my opinion       Had taxed my brain until the noon of night,     I read old law, and loathed the long dominion                     Of fiction over right.      I had consulted Coke and Cruise and Chitty,       The works where ancient learning reigns supreme,     Until exhausted nature, moved with pity,                     Sent me a bookman's dream.      Six figures, all gigantic as Gargantua,       Floated before my eyes, and all the six     Were shades like those that once the bard of Mantua                     Saw by the shore of Styx.      The first was one with countenance imperious,       His toga dim with centuries of dust;     \"My name,\" quoth he, \"is Aulus and Agerius,[B]                     My voice is hoarse with rust.      \"Yet once I played my part in law proceedings,       And writers wrote of one they never saw,     I gave their point to formulæ and pleadings,                     I lived but in the law.\"      The second had a countenance perfidious;       What wonder? Prætors launched their formulæ     In vain against Numerius Negidius,                     And not a whit cared he.      With voice of high contempt he greeted Aulus;       \"In interdicts thou wast mine enemy,     Once passed no day that students did not call us                     As parties, me and thee.      \"On paper I was plaintiff or defendant,       On paper thou wast evermore the same;     We lived apart, a life that was transcendant,                     For it was but a name.      \"I hate thee, Aulus, hate thee,\" low he muttered,       \"It was by thee that I was always tricked,     My unsubstantial bread I ate unbuttered                     In dread of interdict.      \"And yet 'twas but the sentiment I hated:       Like thee I ne'er was drunk e'en _vi_ or _clam_,[C]     With wine that was no wine my thirst was sated.                     Like thee I was a sham.\"      Two country hinds in 'broidered smocks next followed,       Each trundled him a cart-wheel by the spokes,     Oblivion now their names hath well-nigh swallowed,                     For they were Stiles and Nokes.      They spake no word, for speech to them was grievous,       With bovine eyes they supplicated me;     \"We wot not what ye will, but prithee leave us,                     Unlettered folk are we.\"      \"Go,\" said I, \"simple ones, and break your fallows,       Crush autumn apples in the cider press,     Law, gaffer Stiles, thy humble name still hallows,                     Contracted to J. S.\"      Another pair of later time succeeded,       With buckles on their shoes and silken hose,     A garb that told it was to them who heeded                     John Doe's and Richard Roe's.      \"Ah me! I was a casual ejector,[D]       In the brave days of old,\" I heard one say;     \"I knew Elizabeth, the Lord Protector                     I spake with yesterday.\"      To whom in contradiction snarled the other,       \"There was no living blood our veins to fill.     Both you and I were nought but shadows, brother,                     And we are shadows still.\"      Room for a lady, room, as at Megiddo       The hosts made way for passage of the king,     For from the darkness crept there forth a widow                     In weeds and wedding ring.      \"I am the widow, I, whereof the singers       Of Scotland sang, their cruel words so smote     My tender heart, that ofttimes itched my fingers                     To take them by the throat.      \"He scoffed at me, dour bachelor of Glasgow,[E]       If I existed not for him, the knave,     'Twas all his fault who let some bonnie lass go                     Unwedded to her grave.\"  [B] Aulus Agerius and Numerius Negidius are names continually occurring in the Roman institutional writers as typical names of parties to legal process, corresponding very much to the John Stiles and John Nokes of the older English law-books, and the Amr and Zaid of Mohammedan law. John Stiles was frequently contracted to J. S.
