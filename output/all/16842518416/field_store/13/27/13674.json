They         are the guardians of that treasury of legend         which comes to us from the very childhood of         nations; they and their tales are the abstract         and brief chronicles, not of an age merely, but         of the whole race of man. It is theirs to keep         alive the great art of telling stories as a         thing wholly apart from and independent of the         art of writing stories, and to pass on their         art to children and to children's children.         They abide in a realm of their own, in blessed         isolation from that world of professional         authors and their milk-and-water books \"for         children.\"                           --C.
