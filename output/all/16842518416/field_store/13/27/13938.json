BY                          REV. HORACE EDWIN HAYDEN,   Member of the Southern Historical Society and the Historical Society of     Pennsylvania; Corresponding Member of the New England Historical       and Genealogical Society, the Historical Society of Virginia,                               &c., &c., &c.                                _Richmond, Va.:                    Geo. W. Gary, Printer and Binder._                                   1879.     EXPLOSIVE AND POISONED MUSKET AND RIFLE BALLS.   The following remarkable statement occurs as a note to the account of the battle of Gettysburg, on page 78, volume III, of \"The Pictorial History of the Civil War in the United States of America, by Benson J. Lossing, LL. D.\":      Many, mostly young men, were maimed in every conceivable way, by     every kind of weapon and missile, the most fiendish of which was an     explosive and a poisoned bullet, represented in the engraving a     little more than half the size of the originals, procured from     the battlefield there by the writer. _These were sent by the     Confederates. Whether any were ever used by the Nationals, the     writer is not informed._ One was made to explode in the body of the     man, and the other to leave a deadly poison in him, whether the     bullet lodged in or passed through him.      Figure A represents the explosive bullet. The perpendicular stem,     with a piece of thin copper hollowed, and a head over it of bullet     metal, fitted a cavity in the bullet proper below it, as seen in the     engraving. In the bottom of the cavity was fulminating powder. When     the bullet struck, the momentum would cause the copper in the outer     disc to flatten, and allow the point of the stem to strike and     explode the fulminating powder, when the bullet would be rent into     fragments which would lacerate the victim.      In figure B the bullet proper was hollowed, into which was inserted     another, also hollow, containing poison. The latter being loose,     would slip out and remain in the victim's body or limbs with its     freight of poison if the bullet proper should pass through. Among     the Confederate wounded at the College were boys of tender age and     men who had been forced into the ranks against their will.  The italics I am responsible for. It is difficult for those who live at the South to realize how extensively such insinuating slanders as the above against the Confederates are credited at the North, even by reading people.  I purpose in this paper to examine the statement of the author of this Pictorial History, and to show, by indisputable proof, its recklessness and its falsity. In the above quotation, he states that he had picked up, on the battlefield of Gettysburg, an _explosive_ and a _poisoned_ ball. \"_These_,\" he adds, \"_were sent by the Confederates. Whether any were ever used by the Nationals, the writer is not informed._\" I do not desire to be severe beyond justice; but it does seem that as no one ventured to inform him to the contrary, this author accepted the silence of the world and deliberately put into print this slander against the Confederates without having made any apparent effort to learn, as he could have done with ease, whether his statement had any basis of truth.  It is with entire confidence in the facts presented in this paper that I _deny_ this author's statement, above, to be a statement of fact. I do more than this--  I. _I most emphatically deny that the Confederate States ever authorized the use of explosive or poisoned musket or rifle balls._  II. I most emphatically assert that the United States _did purchase, authorize, issue and use explosive musket or rifle balls_ during the late civil war, and that they were thus officially authorized and used at the battle of Gettysburg.  It happened in 1864, the day after the negro troops made their desperate and drunken charge on the Confederate lines to the left of Chaffin's farm and were so signally repulsed, that the writer, who was located in the trenches a mile still further to the left, picked up, in the field outside the trenches assailed by the negroes, some of the cartridges these poor black victims had dropped, containing the very \"_explosive_\" ball described in the above quotation and charged to the Confederates. I have preserved one of these balls ever since. It lies before me as I write. It is similar to figure A, and with a _zinc_ and not a _copper_ disc. _It never contained any fulminating powder._ The construction of the ball led me to make investigations to ascertain its purpose. At first, I thought it might be made to leave in the body of the person struck by it three pieces of metal, instead of one, to irritate, and possibly destroy life. But this theory appeared to me so \"fiendish\" that I was unwilling to accept it, and I became convinced, after more careful examination, that the purpose of the ball was to increase the momentum, by forcing in the cap and expanding the disc so as to fill up the grooves of the rifle. The correctness of this view will be proven in this paper.  In the first place, although the charge made by the author of the Pictorial History of the Civil War against the Confederates of having used explosive and poisoned balls, has been made before, and often repeated since, it has never been supported by one grain of proof. How did this author ascertain that the balls he picked up on the battlefield of Gettysburg were sent by the Confederates? How did he learn that one was an _explosive_ and the other a _poisoned_ projectile? Did he test the explosive power of the one and the poisonous character of the other? He gives no evidence of having done so, and advances no proof of his assertions.  It is a very remarkable fact that no case was ever reported in Northern hospitals, or by Northern surgeons, of Union soldiers having been wounded by such barbarous missiles as these from the Confederate side.  I have very carefully examined those valuable quarto volumes issued by the United States Medical Department and entitled \"The Medical and Surgical History of the Rebellion,\" and as yet have failed to find any case of wound or death reported as having occurred by an explosive or poisoned musket ball, excepting that on page 91 of volume II of said work there is a table of four thousand and two (4,002) cases of gunshot wounds of the scalp, _two_ (2) of which occurred by _explosive musket balls_. To which army these two belonged does not appear.  A letter addressed to the Surgeon-General of the United States by the writer on this subject, has elicited the reply that the Medical Department is without any information as to wounds by such missiles. I do not find such projectiles noticed as preserved in the museum of the Surgeon-General's Department, where rifle projectiles taken from wounds are usually deposited.  In the _second_ place, the manufacture, purchase, issue or use of such projectiles for firearms by the Confederate States, is positively denied by the Confederate authorities, as the following correspondence will show:                                         BEAUVOIR, MISS., 28th June, 1879.      My Dear Sir-- ... In reply to your inquiries as to the use of     explosive or poisoned balls by the troops of the Confederate States,     I state as positively as one may in such a case that the charge has     no foundation in truth. Our Government certainly did not manufacture     or import such balls, and if any were captured from the enemy, they     could probably only have been used in the captured arms for which     they were suited. I heard occasionally that the enemy did use     explosive balls, and others prepared so as to leave a copper ring in     the wound, but it was always spoken of as an atrocity beneath     knighthood and abhorrent to civilization. The slander is only one of     many instances in which our enemy have committed or attempted crimes     of which our people and their Government were incapable, and then     magnified the guilt by accusing us of the offences they had     committed....                 Believe me, ever faithfully yours,                                                         JEFFERSON DAVIS.  General Josiah Gorgas, the Chief of Ordnance of the Confederate States--now of the University of Alabama--writes, under date of July 11th, 1879, that to his \"knowledge the Confederate States never authorized or used explosive or poisoned rifle balls during the late war.\" In this statement also General I. M. St. John and General John Ellicott, both of the Ordnance Bureau, Confederate States army, entirely concur.  The Adjutant-General of the United States also writes me, under date of August 22d, 1879, as to the Confederate archives now in the possession of the National Government, as follows: \"In reply to yours of the 18th August, I have the honor to inform you that the Confederate States records in the possession of this Department furnish no evidence that poisoned or explosive musket balls were used by the army of the Confederate States.\"  Rev. J. William Jones, D. D., Secretary of the Southern Historical Society, has written me to the same effect as to the archives in the possession of the Society.  In the _third_ place, a brief examination of the United States Patent Office Reports for 1862-3, and the Ordnance Reports for 1863-4, will show that the \"_explosive and the poisoned balls_\" which the author of the \"Pictorial History of the Civil War\" so gratuitously charges upon the Confederates, were patented by the United States Patent Office at Washington, and were purchased, issued and used "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25994"],["title","A Refutation of the Charges Made against the Confederate States of America of (#1)"],["body","the United States Government, and, what is still more remarkable, that _neither of the aforesaid projectiles were in any sense explosive or poisoned_.  In the Patent Office Report for 1862-3 will be found the following, with the corresponding illustration in the second volume:      No. 37,145--Elijah D. Williams, of Philadelphia,     Pennsylvania--_Improvement in Elongated Bullets_--Patent dated     December 9, 1862.      This invention consists in the combination with an elongated     expanding bullet of a leaded pin and a concave expanding disc, the     disc having its concave side against the base of the bullet, and the     pin entering the cavity thereof and operating to produce the     flattening of the disc, by which it is caused _to expand against the     walls of and enter the groves of the gun_.      Claim--First, the combination with elongated expanding bullets of a     pin, C, and expanding disc, B, applied substantially as herein     specified. Second, fitting the pin to the cavity of the bullet in     the manner substantially as herein specified, whereby the expansion     of the bullet is caused to commence in the front part of its     expanding portion and to be gradually continued toward the rear as     herein set forth.  So much for the _explosive_ ball \"_sent by the Confederates_.\"  In the same volume of the Patent Office Reports will be found also the following:      No. 36,197--Ira W. Shaler, of Brooklyn, New York, and Reuben Shaler,     of Madison, Connecticut, assigned to Ira W. Shaler     aforesaid--_Improvement in Compound Bullet for Small Arms_--Patent     dated August 12, 1862.      This projectile is composed of two or more parts which fit the bore     of the barrel and so constructed that the forward end of each of the     parts in the rear of the front one enters a cavity in the rear of     the one before it, and is formed in relation to the same in such a     manner as to separate from it after leaving the barrel of the gun     and make a slight deviation in its line of flight from that of its     predecessor.      Claim--The projectile hereinbefore described, made up of two or more     parts, each of equal diameter, constructed as set forth so as to     separate from each other.  No illustration of this projectile appears in the illustrated volume of patents; but an official drawing of it from the Patent Office lies before me. The ball is slightly different from figure B (_supra_), in that it is here perfect, and figure B gives but two parts of the missile.  So much for the _poisoned_ ball \"_sent by the Confederates_.\"  Any person ought to know perfectly well that it was not necessary to invent or construct a rifle ball especially adapted to carry poison, when the common minnie ball itself, dipped into liquid poison and coated, as ball cartridges are usually finished, with wax or tallow, would have effected the same purpose.  To what extent the bullets of Williams and Shaler were used during the late war by the United States troops, the following official communication from the War Department at Washington, under date of September 16, 1879, will show:      Sir--In reply to your letter of the 9th instant to the Secretary of     War, I have to inform you that during the late war a great many of     the bullets patented by Elijah D. Williams and about 200,000 of     those patented by Ira W. Shaler were used by the United States.                 Respectfully, your obedient servant,                                S. C. LYFORD, _Acting Chief of Ordnance_.  In the _fourth_ place, in repelling and refuting the charge against the Confederates of having used explosive musket or rifle projectiles, I charge the United States Government with not only patenting, but purchasing and using, especially at the battle of Gettysburg, an _explosive musket shell_; nor do I trust to my imagination, but I present the facts, which are as follows:  In April, 1862, the Commissioner of Public Buildings at Washington brought to the attention of the Assistant Secretary of War--then Mr. John Tucker--the explosive musket shell invented by Samuel Gardiner, jr. The Assistant Secretary at once referred the matter to General James W. Ripley, who was then the Chief of the Ordnance Bureau at Washington. What action was taken will appear when it is stated that in May, 1862, the Chief of Ordnance at the West Point Military Academy made a report to the Government of a trial of the Gardiner musket shell. In May, 1862, Mr. Gardiner offered to sell some of his explosive musket shells to the Government at a stipulated price. His application was referred to General Ripley with the following endorsement:      Will General Ripley consider whether this explosive shell will be a     valuable missile in battle?                                                               A. LINCOLN.  General Ripley replied that \"it had no value as a service projectile.\"  In June, 1862, Brigadier-General Rufus King, at Fredericksburg, made a requisition for some of the Gardiner musket shells. On referring this application to the Chief of Ordnance, General Ripley, that old army officer, whose sense of right must have been shocked at this instance of barbarism, a second time recorded his disapproval, replying that \"it was not advisable to furnish any such missiles to the troops at present in service.\"  In September, 1862, the Chief of Ordnance of the Eleventh corps, United States army, recommended the shell to the Assistant Secretary of War, who ordered 10,000 rounds to be purchased--made into cartridges. Of this number, 200 were issued to Mr. Gardiner for trial by the Eleventh corps. In October, 1862, the Chief of Ordnance of the Eleventh corps, then in reserve near Fairfax Courthouse, sent in a requisition, endorsed by the General commanding the corps, for 20,000 Gardiner musket shells and cartridges. The Assistant Secretary of War referred the matter to the Chief of Ordnance, General Ripley, who for the _third_ time recorded his disapproval of such issue. Nevertheless, the Assistant Secretary of War ordered the issue to be made to the Eleventh corps of the remaining 9,800 shells and cartridges, which order was obeyed.  In November, 1862, Mr. Gardiner offered to sell to the United States his explosive musket shell and cartridge at $35 per thousand, calibre 58. The Assistant Secretary of War at once ordered 100,000, of which 75,000 were calibre 58 for infantry, and 25,000 calibre 54 for cavalry service.  In June, 1863, the Second New Hampshire volunteers made a requisition for 35,000 of these shells, and by order of the Assistant Secretary of War, they received 24,000. Of this number, 10,060 were abandoned in Virginia and 13,940 distributed to the regiment. The report of this regiment, made subsequently, shows that in the third quarter of 1863--that is, from July 1st to October 1st--about 4,000 of these shells were used in trials and target firing, and about 10,000 were used in action. The Second New Hampshire regiment was in the battle of Gettysburg, and 49 of its members lie buried in the cemetery there.  The above statement shows that the Assistant Secretary of War, against what might be regarded as the protest of the Chief of Ordnance, purchased 110,000 of the Gardiner explosive musket shells, and issued to the troops in actual service 35,000, leaving 75,000 on hand at the close of the war.  In 1866 the Russian Government issued a circular calling a convention of the Nations for the purpose of declaring against the use of explosive projectiles in war. To this circular the then Chief of Ordnance of the United States, General A. B. Dyer, made the following reply, which I have but little doubt expresses the sentiment which actuated General Ripley in his disapproval of the purchase and issue of the Gardiner musket shell:                                          ORDNANCE OFFICE, WAR DEPARTMENT,                                           WASHINGTON, August 19, 1868.      HON. J. M. SCHOFIELD, _Secretary of War_:      Sir--I have read the communication from the Russian Minister in     relation to the abolishment of the use of explosive projectiles in     military warfare, with the attention and care it well deserves.      I concur heartily in the sentiments therein expressed, and I trust     that our Government will respond unhesitatingly to the proposition     in behalf of humanity and civilization. The use in warfare of     explosive balls, so sensitive as to ignite and burst on striking a     substance as soft and yielding as animal flesh (of men or horses), I     consider barbarous and no more to be tolerated by civilized nations     than the universally reprobated practice of using poisoned missiles,     or of poisoning food or drink to be left in the way of an enemy.     Such a practice is inexcusable among any people above the grade of     ignorant savages. Neither do I regard the use in war of such     explosive balls as of any public advantage, but rather the reverse;     for it will have the effect of killing outright, rather than     wounding, and it is known that the care of wounded men much more     embarrasses the future operations of the enemy than the loss of the     same number killed, who require no further attention which may delay     or impede them.      There is a class of explosive projectiles now used, the     discontinuance of which is not demanded by humanity, and the use of     which may be considered legitimate. These are the projectiles which     can only be exploded by contact with hard, resisting substances, and     which are generally used for destroying ships, caissons, or light     fortifications, and not directly against men or animals in the     opposing ranks. These latter ought not and probably cannot be     included in an agreement or treaty to prohibit their use in warfare;     but I strongly advocate an agreement or treaty binding all civilized     nations to discontinue and forever abandon the use in war of "]]]
