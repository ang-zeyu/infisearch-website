We'll keep to sticks.  Better still: I want you to get used to handling a sword, so I'll have the stick and you shall defend yourself with a blade.\"  \"But that wouldn't be fair to you,\" cried Roy.  \"I might hurt you, while you couldn't hurt me.\"  \"Couldn't I?\" said the old fellow, drily.  \"I'm afraid I could, and more than you could me.  Now, then, take that blade.\"  He took one from the wall, a handsome-looking sword, upon which the armourer who made it had bestowed a good deal of ingenious labour, carving the sides, and ornamenting the hilt with a couple of beautifully fluted representations in steel of the scallop shell, so placed that they formed as complete a protection to the hand of the user as that provided in the basket-hilted Scottish claymore.  \"Find that too heavy for you, sir?\"  \"It is heavy,\" said Roy; \"but one seems to be able to handle it easily.\"  \"Yes, sir; you'll find that will move lightly.  You see it's so well balanced by the hilt being made heavy.  The blade comes up lightly, and, with a fair chance, I believe I could cut a man in two with it after a few touches on a grindstone.\"  \"Ugh!\" ejaculated Roy; \"horrid!\"  \"Oh, I don't know, sir.  Much more horrid if he cut you in two.  It's of no use to be thin-skinned over fighting in earnest.  Man's got to defend himself.  Now, then, let's give you a word or two of advice to begin with.  A good swordsman makes his blade move so sharply that you can hardly see it go through the air.  You must make it fly about like lightning.  Now then, ready?\"  \"Yes; but you won't mind if I hurt you?\"  \"Don't you be afraid of doing that, sir.  If you hurt me, it'll serve me right for being such a bungler.  _En garde_!\"  Roy threw himself into position, and the old soldier attacked him very slowly, cutting at his neck on either side, then down straight at his head, next at his arms and legs; and in every case, though in a bungling way, Roy interposed his blade after the fashion shown by his adversary.  Then the old fellow drew back and rested the point of his ash stick upon his toe, while Roy panted a little, and smiled with satisfaction.  \"Come,\" he said; \"I wasn't so bad there.\"  \"Oh, no, you weren't so bad there, because you showed that you'd got some idea of what a sword's for; but when you're ready we'll begin again.  May as well have something to think about till to-morrow morning.  First man you fight with won't stop to ask whether you're ready, you know.\"  \"I suppose not; but wait a minute.\"  \"Hour, if you like, sir; but your arms'll soon get hard.  Seems a pity, though, that they're not harder now.  I often asked the master to let me teach you how to use a sword.\"  \"Yes, I know; but my mother always objected.  She doesn't like swords. I do.\"  \"Of course you do, sir.  It's a lad's nature to like one.  Ready?\"  \"Yes,\" cried Roy, standing on his guard; \"but look out this time, Ben, because I mean you to have something.\"  \"That's right, sir; but mind this: I'm not going to let my stick travel like a snail after a cabbage-leaf this time.  I'm going to cut as I should with a sword, only I'm going to hit as if you were made of glass, so as not to break you.  Now!\"  The old soldier's eyes flashed as he threw one foot forward, Roy doing the same; but it was his newly polished sword that flashed as he prepared to guard the cuts, taking care, or meaning to take care, to hold his blade at such an angle that the stick would glance off.  The encounter ended in a few seconds.  _Whizz, whirr, pat, pat, pat_, and the elastic ash sapling came down smartly upon the boy's arms, legs, sides, shoulders, and finished off with a rap on the head, with the result that Roy angrily threw the sword jangling upon the floor, and stood rubbing his arms and sides viciously.  \"You said you were going to hit at me as if I were made of glass,\" cried the boy.  \"So I did.  Don't mean to say those taps hurt you?\"  \"Hurt?  They sting horribly.\"  \"Why, those cuts would hardly have killed flies, sir.  But why didn't you guard?\"  \"Guard?  I did guard,\" cried Roy, angrily, as he rubbed away; \"but you were so quick.\"  \"Oh, I can cut quicker than that, sir.  You see I got in before you did every time.  I'd cut, and was on my way to give another before you were ready for the first.  Come, they don't tingle now, do they?\"  \"Tingle?  Yes.  Here, I want a stick.  I'm not going to leave off without showing you how it does hurt.\"  \"Better leave off now, sir,\" said the man, grinning.  \"But I don't want to,\" cried Roy; and picking up the sword which he had handled with a feeling of pride, he took the other stick, and, crying \"Ready!\" attacked in his turn, striking hard and as swiftly as he could, but _crack, crack, crack_, wherever he struck, there was the defensive sapling; and at last, with his arm and shoulder aching, the boy lowered his point and stood panting, with his brow moist with beads of perspiration.  \"Well done!\" cried Ben.  \"Now that's something like a first lesson. Why, those last were twice as good as any you gave before.\"  \"Yes,\" said Roy, proudly; \"I thought I could make you feel.  Some of those went home.\"  \"Not one of them, my lad,\" said Ben, smiling; \"you didn't touch me once.\"  \"Not once?\"  \"No, sir; not once.\"  \"Is that the truth, Ben?\"  \"Every word of it, sir.  But never you mind that; you did fine; and if you'll come to me every morning, I'll make you so that in three months I shall have to look out for myself.\"  \"I don't seem to have done any good at all,\" said Roy, pettishly.  \"Not done no good, sir?  Why, you've done wonders; you've taken all the conceit out of yourself, and learned in one lesson that you don't know anything whatever about a sword, except that it has a blade and a hilt and a scabbard.  And all the time you'd been thinking that all you had to do was to chop and stab with it as easy as could be, and that there was nothing more to learn.  Now didn't you?\"  \"Something like it,\" said Roy, who was now cooling down; \"but, of course, I knew that you had to parry.\"  \"But you didn't know how to, my lad; and look here, you haven't tried to thrust yet.  Here, give me a sharp one now.\"  \"No, I can't do any more,\" said Roy, sulkily.  \"I don't know how.\"  \"That's a true word, sir; but you're going to try?\"  \"No, I'm not,\" said Roy, whom a sharp sting in one leg from the worst cut made a little vicious again.  \"Come, come, come,\" said the old soldier, reproachfully.  \"That aren't like my master's son talking; that's like a foolish boy without anything in his head.\"  \"Look here, Ben; don't you be insolent.\"  \"Not I, Master Roy.  I wouldn't be to you.  Only I speak out because I'm proud of you, my lad, and I want to see you grow up into a man like your father.  I tried hard not to hurt you, sir, but I suppose I did.  But I can't say I'm sorry.\"  \"Then you ought to be, for you cut at me like a brute.\"  The old soldier shook his head sadly.  \"You don't mean that, Master Roy,\" he said; \"and it's only because you're tingling a bit; that's all.\"  The man's words disarmed Roy, and the angry frown passed away, as he said, frankly--  \"No, I don't mean it now, Ben.  The places don't tingle so; but I say, there'll be black marks wherever you cut at me.\"  \"Never mind, sir; they'll soon come white again, and you'll know next time that you've got to have your weapon ready to save yourself.  Well, I dunno.  I meant it right, but you've had enough of it.  Some day Sir Granby'll let you go to a big fencing-master as never faced a bit o' steel drawn in anger in his life, and he'll put you on leather pads and things, and tap you soft like, and show you how to bow, s'loot, and cut capers like a Frenchman, and when he's done with you I could cut you up into mincemeat without you being able to give me a scratch.\"  \"Get out!\" cried Roy.  \"You don't think anything of the sort.  What time shall I come to-morrow morning--six?\"  \"No, sir, no.  Bed's very nice at six o'clock in the morning.  You stop there, and then you won't be hurt.\"  \"Five, then?\" said Roy, sharply.  \"Nay, sir; you wait for the big fencing-master.\"  \"Five o'clock, I said,\" cried Roy.  The old soldier took the sword Roy had held, and fetching a piece of leather from a drawer began to polish off the finger-marks left upon the steel.  \"I said five o'clock, Ben,\" cried the boy, very decisively.  \"Nay, Master Roy, you give it up, sir.  I'm too rough an old chap for you.\"  \"Sorry I was so disagreeable, Ben,\" said the boy, offering his hand.  \"Mean it, sir?\"  \"Why, of course, Ben.\"  The hand was eagerly seized, and, it being understood that the sword practice was to begin punctually at six next morning, they separated.    CHAPTER FIVE.  ROY TAKES HIS NEXT LESSON.  The clock in the little turret which stood out over the gate-way facing Lady Royland's garden had not done striking six when Roy entered the armoury next morning, to find Ben hard at work fitting the interior of a light helmet with a small leather cap which was apparently well stuffed with wool.  \"Morning, Ben,\" said the boy.  \"What's that for?\"  \"You, sir.\"  \"To wear?\"  \"Of course.  Just as well to take care of your face and head when you're handling swords.  You can use it with the visor up or down, 'cording to what we're doing.  You see, I want to learn you how to use a sword like a soldier, and not like a gentleman who never expects to see trouble.\"  \"Ready?\"  \"Yes, sir, quite; and first thing 's morning we'll begin where we left off, and you shall try to learn that you don't know how to thrust. Nothing like finding out how bad you are.  Then you can begin to see better what you have to learn.\"  \"Very well,\" said Roy, eagerly.  \"You'll have to look out now then, Ben, for I mean to learn, and pretty quickly.\"  \"Oh, yes; you'll learn quickly enough,\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25449"],["title","The Young Castellan: A Tale of the English Civil War (#7)"],["body"," Ben, placing the helmet upon the table and taking the pair of sticks up from where he had placed them.  \"But say, Master Roy, I have been working here.  Don't you think the place looks better?\"  \"I think my father would be proud of the armoury if he could see the weapons,\" said Roy, as he looked round.  \"Everything is splendid.\"  The old soldier smiled as he walked from suit to suit of armour, some of which were obsolete, and could only be looked upon as curiosities of the day; but, in addition, there were modern pieces of defensive armour, beautifully made, with carefully cleaned and inlaid headpieces of the newest kind, and of those the old soldier seemed to be especially proud. Then he led the way on to the stands of offensive weapons, which numbered quaint, massive swords of great age, battle-axes, and maces, and so on to modern weapons of the finest steel, with, guns, petronels, and horse-pistols of clumsy construction, but considered perfect then.  \"Yes, sir, I'm proud of our weepuns,\" said Ben; \"but I aren't a bit proud of the old castle, which seems to be going right away to ruin.\"  \"That it isn't,\" cried Roy, indignantly.  \"It has been repaired and repaired, whenever it wanted doing up, again and again.\"  \"Ah! you're thinking about roofs and tiles and plaster, my lad.  I was thinking about the defences.  Such a place as this used to be.  Look at the gun-carriages,--haven't been painted for years, nor the guns cleaned.\"  \"Well, mix up some paint and brush it on,\" said Roy, \"and clean up the guns.  They can't be rusty, because they're brass.\"  \"Well, not brass exactly, sir,\" said the man, thoughtfully.  \"It's more of a mixtur' like; but to a man like me, sir, it's heart-breaking.\"  \"What! to see them turn green and like bronze?\"  \"Oh, I don't mind that so much, sir; it's seeing of 'em come down so much, like.  Why, there's them there big guns as stands in the court-yard behind the breastwork.\"  \"Garden, Ben.\"  \"Well, garden, sir.  Why, there's actooally ivy and other 'nockshus weeds growing all over 'em.\"  \"Well, it looks peaceful and nice.\"  \"Bah!  A gun can't look peaceful and nice.  But that aren't the worst of it, sir.  I was along by 'em a bit ago, and, if you'll believe me, when I put my hand in one, if there warn't a sharp, hissing noise!\"  \"A snake?  Got in there?\"  \"Snake, sir?  No!  I wouldn't ha' minded a snake; but there's no snakes here.\"  \"There was one, Ben, for I brought it up out of the woods, and kept it in a box for months, till it got away.  Then that's where it is.\"  \"Nay.  It were no snake, sir.  It were one of them little blue and yaller tomtit chaps as lays such lots o' eggs.  I fetches a stick, and I was going to shove it in and twist it in the hay and stuff o' the nest and draw it out.\"  \"But you didn't?\"  \"No, sir, I didn't; for I says to myself, if Sir Granby and her ladyship like the place to go to ruin, they may let it; and if the two little birds--there was a cock and hen--didn't bring up twelve of the rummiest little, tiny young uns I ever did see.  There they was, all a-sitting in a row along the gun, and it seemed to me so comic for 'em to be there that I bust out a-laughing quite loud.\"  \"And they all flew away?\"  \"Nay, sir, they didn't; they stopped there a-twittering.  But if that gun had been loaded, and I'd touched it off with a fire-stick, it would have warmed their toes, eh?  But would you clean up the old guns?\"  \"I don't see why you shouldn't, Ben.  They're valuable.\"  \"Vallerble?  I should think they are, sir.  And, do you know, I will; for who knows what might happen?  They tell me down in the village that there's trouble uppards, and people gets talking agen the king.  Ah! I'd talk 'em if I had my way, and make some of 'em squirm.--Yes, I will tidy things up a bit.  Startle some on 'em if we was to fire off a gun or two over the village.\"  \"They'd burst, Ben.  Haven't been fired for a hundred years, I should say.  Those brass guns were made in Queen Elizabeth's time.\"  \"Oh, they wouldn't burst, sir; I shouldn't be afraid of that.--But this is not learning to thrust, is it?\"  \"No.  Come on,\" cried Roy, and he took one of the stout ash rods. \"Here, hadn't I better put on this helmet?\"  \"Not yet, sir.  You can practise thrusting without that.  Now then, here I am, sir.  All ready for you on my guard.  Now, thrust.\"  Ben dropped into an easy position, with his legs a little bent, one foot advanced, his left hand behind him, and his stick held diagonally across his breast.  Roy imitated him, dropping into the same position.  \"Where shall I stab you?\" he cried.  \"Just wherever you like, sir,--if you can.\"  The boy made a quick dart forward with his stick, and it passed by his teacher, who parried with the slightest movement of his wrist.  \"I said thrust, sir.\"  \"Well, I did thrust.\"  \"That wasn't a thrust, sir; that was only a poke.  It wouldn't have gone through a man's coat, let alone his skin.  Now, again!\"  The boy made another push forward with his stick, which was also parried.  \"Nay, that won't do, my lad; so let's get to something better.  Now, I'm going to thrust at you right in the chest.  Enemies don't tell you where they're going to hit you, but I'm going to tell you.  Now, look out!\"  Roy prepared to guard the thrust, but the point of the old man's stick struck him sharply in the chest, and he winced a little, but smiled.  \"Now, sir, you do that, but harder.\"  Roy obeyed, but failed dismally.  \"Of course,\" said Ben.  \"Now that's because you didn't try the right way, sir.  Don't poke at a man, but throw your arm right back till you get your hand level with your shoulder, and sword and arm just in a line.  Then thrust right out, and let your body follow your arm,--then you get some strength into it.  Now, once more.\"  Roy followed his teacher's instructions.  \"Better--ever so much, sir.  Now again--good; again--good.  You'll soon do it.  Now, can't you see what a lot of weight you get into a thrust like that?  One of your pokes would have done nothing.  One like that last would have sent your blade through a man.  Now again.\"  Roy was now fully upon his mettle, and he tried hard to acquire some portion of the old soldier's skill, till his arm ached, and Ben cried \"Halt!\" and began to chat about the old-fashioned armour.  \"Lots of it was too clumsy, sir.  Strong men were regularly loaded down; and I've thought for a long time that all a man wants is a steel cap and steel gloves.  All the rest he ought to be able to do with his sword.\"  \"But you can't ward off bullets with a sword, Ben,\" said Roy.  \"No, sir; nor you can't ward 'em off with armour.  They find out the jyntes, if they don't go through.\"  \"Would that suit of half-armour be much too big for me, Ben?\" said Roy, pausing before a bronzed ornamental set of defensive weapons, which had evidently been the work of some Italian artist.  \"No, sir, I shouldn't think it would.  You see that was made for a small man, and you're a big lad.  If you were to put that on, and used a bit o' stuffing here and there, you wouldn't be so much amiss.  It's in fine condition, too, with its leather lining, and that's all as lissome and good as when it was first made.\"  \"I should like to try that on some day, Ben,\" said the boy, eagerly examining the handsome suit.  \"Well, I don't see why not, sir.  You'd look fine in that.  Wants three or four white ostrich feathers in the little gilt holder of the helmet. White uns would look well with that dark armour.  Looks just like copper, don't it?\"  \"How long would it take to put it on?\" said Roy.  \"Hour, sir; and you'd want some high buff boots to wear with it.\"  \"An hour?\" said Roy.  \"There wouldn't be time before breakfast.\"  \"No, sir.  But I tell you what--I've only cleaned and polished and iled the straps.  If you feels as if you'd like to put it on, I'll go over it well, and see to the buckles and studs: shall I?\"  \"Yes, do, Ben.\"  \"That I will, sir.  And I say, if, when you're ready, I was to saddle one of the horses proper, and you was to mount and her ladyship see you, she'd be sorry as ever she wanted you to be a statesman.\"  Roy shook his head dubiously.  \"Oh, but she would, sir.  Man looks grand in his armour and feathers.\"  \"But I'm only a boy,\" said Roy, sadly.  \"Who's to know that when you're in armour and your visor down, sir?  A suit of armour like that, and you on a grand horse, would make a man of you.  It's fine, and no mistake.\"  \"But you were sneering at armour a little while ago, Ben,\" said Roy.  \"For fighting in, sir, but not for show.  You see, there's something about armour and feathers and flags that gets hold of people, and a soldier's a man who likes to look well.  I'm an old un now, but I wouldn't say no to a good new uniform, with a bit o' colour in it; but if you want me to fight, I don't want to be all plates and things like a lobster, and not able to move.  I want to be free to use my arms.  Right enough for show, sir, and make a regiment look handsome; but fighting's like gardening,--want to take your coat off when you go to work.\"  \"But you will get that armour ready, Ben?\"  \"Course I will, sir.  On'y too glad to see you take a liking to a bit o' armour and a sword.  Now, then, what do you say to beginning again?\"  \"I'm ready,\" said Roy, but with a longing look at the armour.  \"Then you shall just put that helmet on, and have the visor down.  You won't be able to see so well, but it will save your face from an accidental cut.\"  He placed the helmet on the boy's head, adjusted the cheek straps, and drew back.  \"Find it heavy, sir?\"  \"Rather!  Feels as if it would topple off as soon as I begin to move.\"  \"But it won't, sir.  The leather cap inside will stop that.  Now, then, if you please, we'll begin.  I'm going to cut at you slowly and softly, and you've got to guard yourself, and then turn off.  I shall be very slow, but after a bit I shall cut like lightning, and before I've done I shan't be no more able to hit you than you're able now"]]]
