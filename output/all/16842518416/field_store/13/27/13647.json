Beowulf  Meanwhile there had come to manhood and full strength a hero destined to make his name famous for mighty deeds of valour throughout the whole of the Teutonic North. In the realm of the Geats (Götaland, in the south of Sweden) ruled King Hygelac, a mighty ruler who was ambitious enough to aim at conquering his neighbours on the mainland of Germany. His only sister, daughter of the dead king Hrethel, had married a great noble, Ecgtheow, and they had one son, Beowulf, who from the age of seven was brought up at the Geatish court. The boy was a lad of great stature and handsome appearance, with fair locks and gallant bearing; but he greatly disappointed his grandfather, King Hrethel, by his sluggish character. Beowulf as a youth had been despised by all for his sloth and his unwarlike disposition; his good-nature and his rarely stirred wrath made others look upon him with scorn, and the mighty stature to which he grew brought him nothing but scoffs and sneers and insults in the banquet-hall when the royal feasts were held. Yet wise men might have seen the promise of great strength in his powerful sinews and his mighty hands, and the signs of great force of character in the glance of his clear blue eyes and the fierceness of his anger when he was once aroused. At least once already Beowulf had distinguished himself in a great feat--a swimming-match with a famous champion, Breca, who had been beaten in the contest. For this and other victories, and for the bodily strength which gave Beowulf's hand-grip the force of thirty men, the hero was already famed when the news of Grendel's ravages reached Geatland. Beowulf, eager to try his strength against the monster, and burning to add to his fame, asked and obtained permission from his uncle, King Hygelac, to seek the stricken Danish king and offer his help against Grendel; then, choosing fourteen loyal comrades and kinsfolk, he took a cheerful farewell of the Geatish royal family and sailed for Denmark.  Thus it happened that one day the Warden of the Coast, riding on his round along the Danish shores, saw from the white cliffs a strange war-vessel running in to shore. Her banners were unknown to him, her crew were strangers and all in war-array, and as the Warden watched them they ran the ship into a small creek among the mountainous cliffs, made her fast to a rock with stout cables, and then landed and put themselves in readiness for a march. Though there were fifteen of the strangers and the Warden was alone, he showed no hesitation, but, riding boldly down into their midst, loudly demanded:      \"What are ye warlike men    wielding bright weapons,     Wearing grey corslets    and boar-adorned helmets,     Who o'er the water-paths    come with your foaming keel     Ploughing the ocean surge?    I was appointed     Warden of Denmark's shores;    watch hold I by the wave     That on this Danish coast    no deadly enemy     Leading troops over sea    should land to injure.     None have here landed yet    more frankly coming     Than this fair company:    and yet ye answer not     The password of warriors,    and customs of kinsmen.     Ne'er have mine eyes beheld    a mightier warrior,     An earl more lordly, than    is he, the chief of you;     He is no common man;    if looks belie him not,     He is a hero bold,    worthily weaponed.     Anon must I know of you    kindred and country,     Lest ye as spies should go    free on our Danish soil.     Now ye men from afar,    sailing the surging sea,     Have heard my earnest thought:    best is a quick reply,     That I may swiftly know    whence ye have hither come.\"  So the aged Warden sat on his horse, gazing attentively on the faces of the fifteen strangers, but watching most carefully the countenance of the leader; for the mighty stature, the clear glance of command, the goodly armour, and the lordly air of Beowulf left no doubt as to who was the chieftain of that little band. When the questions had been asked the leader of the new-comers moved forward till his mighty figure stood beside the Warden's horse, and as he gazed up into the old man's eyes he answered: \"We are warriors of the Geats, members of King Hygelac's bodyguard. My father, well known among men of wisdom, was named Ecgtheow, a wise counsellor who died full of years and famous for his wisdom, leaving a memory dear to all good men.\"      \"We come to seek thy king    Healfdene's glorious son,     Thy nation's noble lord,    with friendly mind.     Be thou a guardian good    to us strangers here!     We have an errand grave    to the great Danish king,     Nor will I hidden hold    what I intend!     Thou canst tell if it is    truth (as we lately heard)     That some dire enemy,    deadly in evil deed,     Cometh in dark of night,    sateth his secret hate,     Worketh through fearsome awe,    slaughter and shame.     I can give Hrothgar bold    counsel to conquer him,     How he with valiant mind    Grendel may vanquish,     If he would ever lose    torment of burning care,     If bliss shall bloom again    and woe shall vanish.\"  The aged Warden replied: \"Every bold warrior of noble mind must recognise the distinction between words and deeds. I judge by thy speech that you are all friends to our Danish king; therefore I bid you go forward, in warlike array, and I myself will guide you to King Hrothgar; I will also bid my men draw your vessel up the beach, and make her fast with a barricade of oars against any high tide. Safe she shall be until again she bears you to your own land. May your expedition prove successful.\"  Thus speaking, he turned his horse's head and led the way up the steep cliff paths, while the Geats followed him, resplendent in shining armour, with boar-crests on their helmets, shields and spears in their hands, and mighty swords hanging in their belts: a goodly band were they, as they strode boldly after the Warden. Anon there appeared a roughly trodden path, which soon became a stone-paved road, and the way led on to where the great hall, Heorot, towered aloft, gleaming white in the sun; very glorious it seemed, with its pinnacled gables and its carved beams and rafters, and the Geats gazed at it with admiration as the Warden of the Coast said: \"Yonder stands our monarch's hall, and your way lies clear before you. May the All-Father keep you safe in the conflict! Now it is time for me to return; I go to guard our shores from every foe.\"   Hrothgar and Beowulf  The little band of Geats, in their shining war-gear, strode along the stone-paved street, their ring-mail sounding as they went, until they reached the door of Heorot; and there, setting down their broad shields and their keen spears against the wall, they prepared to enter as peaceful guests the great hall of King Hrothgar. Wulfgar, one of Hrothgar's nobles, met them at the door and asked whence such a splendid band of warlike strangers, so well armed and so worthily equipped, had come. Their heroic bearing betokened some noble enterprise. Beowulf answered: \"We are Hygelac's chosen friends and companions, and I am Beowulf. To King Hrothgar, thy master, will I tell mine errand, if the son of Healfdene will allow us to approach him.\"  Wulfgar, impressed by the words and bearing of the hero, replied: \"I will announce thy coming to my lord, and bring back his answer\"; and then made his way up the hall to the high seat where Hrothgar sat on the daïs amidst his bodyguard of picked champions. Bowing respectfully, he said:      \"Here are come travelling    over the sea-expanse,     Journeying from afar,    heroes of Geatland.     Beowulf is the name    of their chief warrior.     This is their prayer, my lord,    that they may speak with thee;     Do not thou give them    a hasty refusal!     Do not deny them    the gladness of converse!     They in their war-gear seem    worthy of men's respect.     Noble their chieftain seems,    he who the warriors     Hither has guided.\"  At these words the aged king aroused himself from the sad reverie into which he had fallen and answered: \"I knew him as a boy. Beowulf is the son of Ecgtheow, who wedded the daughter of the Geat King Hrethel. His fame has come hither before him; seafarers have told me that he has the might of thirty men in his hand-grip. Great joy it is to know of his coming, for he may save us from the terror of Grendel. If he succeeds in this, great treasures will I bestow upon him. Hasten; bring in hither Beowulf and his kindred thanes, and bid them welcome to the Danish folk!\"  Wulfgar hurried down the hall to the place where Beowulf stood with his little band; he led them gladly to the high seat, so that they stood opposite to Hrothgar, who looked keenly at the well-equipped troop, and kindly at its leader. A striking figure was Beowulf as he stood there in his gleaming ring-mail, with the mighty sword by his side. It was, however, but a minute that Hrothgar looked in silence, for with respectful greeting Beowulf spoke:      \"Hail to thee, Hrothgar King!    Beowulf am I,     Hygelac's kinsman    and loyal companion.     Great deeds of valour    wrought I in my youth.     To me in my native land    Grendel's ill-doing     Came as an oft-heard tale    told by our sailors.     They say that this bright hall,    noblest of buildings,     Standeth to every man    idle and useless     After the evening-light    fails in the heavens.     Thus, Hrothgar, ancient king,    all my friends urged me,     Warriors and prudent thanes,    that I should seek thee,     Since they themselves had known    my might in battle.     Now I will beg of thee,    lord of the glorious Danes,     Prince of the Scylding race,    Folk-lord most friendly,     Warden of warriors,    only one boon.     Do not deny it me,    since I have come"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25502"],["title","Hero-Myths & Legends of the British Race (#5)"],["body","far;     I with my men alone,    this troop of heroes good,     Would without help from thee    cleanse thy great hall!     Oft have I also heard    that the fierce monster     Through his mad recklessness    scorns to use weapons;     Therefore will I forego    (so may King Hygelac,     My friendly lord and king,    find in me pleasure)     That I should bear my sword    and my broad yellow shield     Into the conflict:    with my hand-grip alone     I 'gainst the foe will strive,    and struggle for my life--     He shall endure God's doom    whom death shall bear away.     I know that he thinketh    in this hall of conflict     Fearless to eat me,    if he can compass it,     As he has oft devoured    heroes of Denmark.     Then thou wilt not need    my head to hide away,     Grendel will have me    all mangled and gory;     Away will he carry,    if death then shall take me,     My body with gore stained    will he think to feast on,     On his lone track will bear it    and joyously eat it,     And mark with my life-blood    his lair in the moorland;     Nor more for my welfare    wilt thou need to care then.     Send thou to Hygelac,    if strife shall take me,     That best of byrnies    which my breast guardeth,     Brightest of war-weeds,    the work of Smith Weland,     Left me by Hrethel.    Ever Wyrd has her way.\"  The aged King Hrothgar, who had listened attentively while the hero spoke of his plans and of his possible fate, now greeted him saying: \"Thou hast sought my court for honour and for friendship's sake, O Beowulf: thou hast remembered the ancient alliance between Ecgtheow, thy father, and myself, when I shielded him, a fugitive, from the wrath of the Wilfings, paid them the due wergild for his crime, and took his oath of loyalty to myself. Long ago that time is; Ecgtheow is dead, and I am old and in misery. It were too long now to tell of all the woe that Grendel has wrought, but this I may say, that many a hero has boasted of the great valour he would display in strife with the monster, and has awaited his coming in this hall; in the morning there has been no trace of each hero but the dark blood-stains on benches and tables. How many times has that happened! But sit down now to the banquet and tell thy plans, if such be thy will.\"  Thereupon room was made for the Geat warriors on the long benches, and Beowulf sat in the place of honour opposite to the king: great respect was shown to him, and all men looked with wonder on this mighty hero, whose courage led him to hazard this terrible combat. Great carved horns of ale were borne to Beowulf and his men, savoury meat was placed before them, and while they ate and drank the minstrels played and sang to the harp the deeds of men of old. The mirth of the feast was redoubled now men hoped that a deliverer had come indeed.   The Quarrel  Among all the Danes who were rejoicing over Beowulf's coming there was one whose heart was sad and his brow gloomy--one thane whom jealousy urged to hate any man more distinguished than himself. Hunferth, King Hrothgar's orator and speech-maker, from his official post at Hrothgar's feet watched Beowulf with scornful and jealous eyes. He waited until a pause came in the clamour of the feast, and suddenly spoke, coldly and contemptuously: \"Art thou that Beowulf who strove against Breca, the son of Beanstan, when ye two held a swimming contest in the ocean and risked your lives in the deep waters? In vain all your friends urged you to forbear--ye would go on the hazardous journey; ye plunged in, buffeting the wintry waves through the rising storm. Seven days and nights ye toiled, but Breca overcame thee: he had greater strength and courage. Him the ocean bore to shore, and thence he sought his native land, and the fair city where he ruled as lord and chieftain. Fully he performed his boast against thee. So I now look for a worse issue for thee, for thou wilt find Grendel fiercer in battle than was Breca, if thou darest await him this night.\"  Beowulf's brow flushed with anger as he replied haughtily: \"Much hast thou spoken, friend Hunferth, concerning Breca and our swimming contest; but belike thou art drunken, for wrongly hast thou told the tale. A youthful folly of ours it was, when we two boasted and challenged each other to risk our lives in the ocean; that indeed we did. Naked swords we bore in our hands as we swam, to defend ourselves against the sea-monsters, and we floated together, neither outdistancing the other, for five days, when a storm drove us apart. Cold were the surging waves, bitter the north wind, rough was the swelling flood, under the darkening shades of night. Yet this was not the worst: the sea-monsters, excited by the raging tempest, rushed at me with their deadly tusks and bore me to the abyss. Well was it then for me that I wore my well-woven ring-mail, and had my keen sword in hand; with point and edge I fought the deadly beasts, and killed them. Many a time the hosts of monsters bore me to the ocean-bottom, but I slew numbers among them, and thus we battled all the night, until in the morning came light from the east, and I could see the windy cliffs along the shore, and the bodies of the slain sea-beasts floating on the surge. Nine there were of them, for Wyrd is gracious to the man who is valiant and unafraid. Never have I heard of a sterner conflict, nor a more unhappy warrior lost in the waters; yet I saved my life, and landed on the shores of Finland. Breca wrought not so mightily as I, nor have I heard of such warlike deeds on thy part, even though thou, O Hunferth, didst murder thy brothers and nearest kinsmen.      \"Truly I say to thee,    O son of Ecglaf bold,     Grendel the grisly fiend    ne'er dared have wrought     So many miseries,    such shame and anguish dire,     To thy lord, Hrothgar old,    in his bright Heorot,     Hadst thou shown valiant mood,    sturdy and battle-fierce,     As thou now boastest.\"  [Illustration: Beowulf replies haughtily to Hunferth]  Very wroth was Hunferth over the reminder of his former wrongdoing and the implied accusation of cowardice, but he had brought it on himself by his unwise belittling of Beowulf's feat, and the applause of both Danes and Geats showed him that he dared no further attack the champion; he had to endure in silence Beowulf's boast that he and his Geats would that night await Grendel in the hall, and surprise him terribly, since the fiend had ceased to expect any resistance from the warlike Danes. The feast continued, with laughter and melody, with song and boast, until the door from the women's bower, in the upper end of the hall, opened suddenly, and Hrothgar's wife, the fair and gracious Queen Wealhtheow, entered. The tumult lulled for a short space, and the queen, pouring mead into a goblet, presented it to her husband; joyfully he received and drank it. Then she poured mead or ale for each man, and in due course came to Beowulf, as to the guest of honour. Gratefully Wealhtheow greeted the lordly hero, and thanked him for the friendship which brought him to Denmark to risk his life against Grendel. Beowulf, rising respectfully and taking the cup from the queen's hand, said with dignity:      \"This I considered well    when I the ocean sought,     Sailed in the sea-vessel    with my brave warriors,     That I alone would win    thy folk's deliverance,     Or in the fight would fall    fast in the demon's grip.     Needs must I now perform    knightly deeds in this hall,     Or here must meet my doom    in darksome night.\"  Well pleased, Queen Wealhtheow went to sit beside her lord, where her gracious smile cheered the assembly. Then the clamour of the feast was renewed, until Hrothgar at length gave the signal for retiring. Indeed, it was necessary to leave Heorot when darkness fell, for the fiend came each night when sunlight faded. So the whole assembly arose, each man bade his comrades \"Good night,\" and the Danes dispersed; but Hrothgar addressed Beowulf half joyfully, half sadly, saying:      \"Never before have I    since I held spear and shield     Given o'er to any man    this mighty Danish hall,     Save now to thee alone.    Keep thou and well defend     This best of banquet-halls.    Show forth thy hero-strength,     Call up thy bravery,    watch for the enemy!     Thou shalt not lack gifts of worth    if thou alive remain     Winner in this dire strife.\"  Thus Hrothgar departed, to seek slumber in a less dangerous abode, where, greatly troubled in mind, he awaited the dawn with almost hopeless expectation, and Beowulf and his men prepared themselves for the perils of the night.   Beowulf and Grendel  The fourteen champions of the Geats now made ready for sleep; but while the others lay down in their armour, with weapons by their sides, Beowulf took off his mail, unbelted his sword, unhelmed himself, and gave his sword to a thane to bear away. For, as he said to his men, \"I will strive against this fiend weaponless. With no armour, since he wears none, will I wrestle with him, and try to overcome him. I will conquer, if I win, by my hand-grip alone; and the All-Father shall judge between us, and grant the victory to whom He will.\"  The Geats then lay down--brave men who slept calmly, though they knew they were risking their lives, for none of them expected to see the light of day again, or to revisit their native land: they had heard, too, much during the feast of the slaughter which Grendel had wrought. So night came, the voices of men grew silent, and the darkness shrouded all alike--calm sleepers, anxious watchers, and the deadly, creeping foe.  When everything was still Grendel came. From the fen-fastnesses, by marshy tracts, through mists and swamp-born fogs, the hideous monster made his way to the house he hated so bitterly. Grendel strode fiercely to the door of Heorot, and would fain have opened it as usual, but it was locked and bolted. Then the fiend's wrath was roused; he grasped the door"]]]
