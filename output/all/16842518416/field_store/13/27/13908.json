Well said, well said!      Basilio, my father--well--Clotaldo      Is he my kinsman too?       CHAMB.      Oh, my good Lord,      A General simply in your Highness' service,      Than whom your Highness has no trustier.       SEG.      Ay, so you said before, I think. And you      With that white wand of yours--      Why, now I think on't, I have read of such      A silver-hair'd magician with a wand,      Who in a moment, with a wave of it,      Turn'd rags to jewels, clowns to emperors,      By some benigner magic than the stars      Spirited poor good people out of hand      From all their woes; in some enchanted sleep      Carried them off on cloud or dragon-back      Over the mountains, over the wide Deep,      And set them down to wake in Fairyland.       CHAMB.      Oh, my good Lord, you laugh at me--and I      Right glad to make you laugh at such a price:      You know me no enchanter: if I were,      I and my wand as much as your Highness',      As now your chamberlain--       SEG.      My chamberlain?--      And these that follow you?--       CHAMB.      On you, my Lord,      Your Highness' lords in waiting.       SEG.      Lords in waiting.      Well, I have now learn'd to repeat, I think,      If only but by rote--This is my palace,      And this my throne--which unadvised--And that      Out of the window there my Capital;      And all the people moving up and down      My subjects and my vassals like yourselves,      My chamberlain--and lords in waiting--and      Clotaldo--and Clotaldo?--      You are an aged, and seem a reverend man--      You do not--though his fellow-officer--      You do not mean to mock me?       CHAMB.      Oh, my Lord!       SEG.      Well then--If no magician, as you say,      Yet setting me a riddle, that my brain,      With all its senses whirling, cannot solve,      Yourself or one of these with you must answer--      How I--that only last night fell asleep      Not knowing that the very soil of earth      I lay down--chain'd--to sleep upon was Poland--      Awake to find myself the Lord of it,      With Lords, and Generals, and Chamberlains,      And ev'n my very Gaoler, for my vassals!       Enter suddenly Clotaldo       CLOTALDO.      Stand all aside      That I may put into his hand the clue      To lead him out of this amazement. Sir,      Vouchsafe your Highness from my bended knee      Receive my homage first.       SEG.      Clotaldo! What,      At last--his old self--undisguised where all      Is masquerade--to end it!--You kneeling too!      What! have the stars you told me long ago      Laid that old work upon you, added this,      That, having chain'd your prisoner so long,      You loose his body now to slay his wits,      Dragging him--how I know not--whither scarce      I understand--dressing him up in all      This frippery, with your dumb familiars      Disvizor'd, and their lips unlock'd to lie,      Calling him Prince and King, and, madman-like,      Setting a crown of straw upon his head?       CLO.      Would but your Highness, as indeed I now      Must call you--and upon his bended knee      Never bent Subject more devotedly--      However all about you, and perhaps      You to yourself incomprehensiblest,      But rest in the assurance of your own      Sane waking senses, by these witnesses      Attested, till the story of it all,      Of which I bring a chapter, be reveal'd,      Assured of all you see and hear as neither      Madness nor mockery--       SEG.      What then?       CLO.      All it seems:      This palace with its royal garniture;      This capital of which it is the eye,      With all its temples, marts, and arsenals;      This realm of which this city is the head,      With all its cities, villages, and tilth,      Its armies, fleets, and commerce; all your own;      And all the living souls that make them up,      From those who now, and those who shall, salute you,      Down to the poorest peasant of the realm,      Your subjects--Who, though now their mighty voice      Sleeps in the general body unapprized,      Wait but a word from those about you now      To hail you Prince of Poland, Segismund.       SEG.      All this is so?       CLO.      As sure as anything      Is, or can be.       SEG.      You swear it on the faith      You taught me--elsewhere?--       CLO (kissing the hilt of his sword).      Swear it upon this Symbol,      and champion of the holy faith      I wear it to defend.       SEG (to himself).      My eyes have not deceived me, nor my ears,      With this transfiguration, nor the strain      Of royal welcome that arose and blew,      Breathed from no lying lips, along with it.      For here Clotaldo comes, his own old self,      Who, if not Lie and phantom with the rest--      (Aloud)      Well, then, all this is thus.      For have not these fine people told me so,      And you, Clotaldo, sworn it? And the Why      And Wherefore are to follow by and bye!      And yet--and yet--why wait for that which you      Who take your oath on it can answer--and      Indeed it presses hard upon my brain--      What I was asking of these gentlemen      When you came in upon us; how it is      That I--the Segismund you know so long      No longer than the sun that rose to-day      Rose--and from what you know--      Rose to be Prince of Poland?       CLO.      So to be      Acknowledged and entreated, Sir.       SEG.      So be      Acknowledged and entreated--      Well--But if now by all, by some at least      So known--if not entreated--heretofore--      Though not by you--For, now I think again,      Of what should be your attestation worth,      You that of all my questionable subjects      Who knowing what, yet left me where I was,      You least of all, Clotaldo, till the dawn      Of this first day that told it to myself?       CLO.      Oh, let your Highness draw the line across      Fore-written sorrow, and in this new dawn      Bury that long sad night.       SEG.      Not ev'n the Dead,      Call'd to the resurrection of the blest,      Shall so directly drop all memory      Of woes and wrongs foregone!       CLO.      But not resent--      Purged by the trial of that sorrow past      For full fruition of their present bliss.       SEG.      But leaving with the Judge what, till this earth      Be cancell'd in the burning heavens, He leaves      His earthly delegates to execute,      Of retribution in reward to them      And woe to those who wrong'd them--Not as you,      Not you, Clotaldo, knowing not--And yet      Ev'n to the guiltiest wretch in all the realm,      Of any treason guilty short of that,      Stern usage--but assuredly not knowing,      Not knowing 'twas your sovereign lord, Clotaldo,      You used so sternly.       CLO.      Ay, sir; with the same      Devotion and fidelity that now      Does homage to him for my sovereign.       SEG.      Fidelity that held his Prince in chains!       CLO.      Fidelity more fast than had it loosed him--       SEG.      Ev'n from the very dawn of consciousness      Down at the bottom of the barren rocks,      Where scarce a ray of sunshine found him out,      In which the poorest beggar of my realm      At least to human-full proportion grows--      Me! Me--whose station was the kingdom's top      To flourish in, reaching my head to heaven,      And with my branches overshadowing      The meaner growth below!       CLO.      Still with the same      Fidelity--       SEG.      To me!--       CLO.      Ay, sir, to you,      Through that divine allegiance upon which      All Order and Authority is based;      Which to revolt against--       SEG.      Were to revolt      Against the stars, belike!       CLO.      And him who reads them;      And by that right, and by the sovereignty      He wears as you shall wear it after him;      Ay, one to whom yourself--      Yourself, ev'n more than any subject here,      Are bound by yet another and more strong      Allegiance--King Basilio--your Father--       SEG.      Basilio--King--my father!--       CLO.      Oh, my Lord,      Let me beseech you on my bended knee,      For your own sake--for Poland's--and for his,      Who, looking up for counsel to the skies,      Did what he did under authority      To which the kings of earth themselves are subject,      And whose behest not only he that suffers,      But he that executes, not comprehends,      But only He that orders it--       SEG.      The King--      My father!--Either I am mad already,      Or that way driving fast--or I should know      That fathers do not use their children so,      Or men were loosed from all allegiance      To fathers, kings, and heaven that order'd all.      But, mad or not, my hour is come, and I      Will have my reckoning--Either you lie,      Under the skirt of sinless majesty      Shrouding your treason; or if _that_ indeed,      Guilty itself, take refuge in the stars      That cannot hear the charge, or disavow--      You, whether doer or deviser, who      Come first to hand, shall pay the penalty      By the same hand you owe it to--      (Seizing Clotaldo's sword and about to strike him.)       (Enter Rosaura suddenly.)       ROSAURA.      Fie, my Lord--forbear,      What! a young hand raised against silver hair!--       (She retreats through the crowd.)       SEG.      Stay! stay! What come and vanish'd as before--      I scarce remember how--but--       (Voices within. Room for Astolfo, Duke of Muscovy!)       (Enter Astolfo)       ASTOLFO.      Welcome, thrice welcome, the auspicious day,      When from the mountain where he darkling lay,      The Polish sun into the firmament      Sprung all the brighter for his late ascent,      And in meridian glory--       SEG.      Where is he?      Why must I ask this twice?--       A LORD.      The Page, my Lord?      I wonder at his boldness--       SEG.      But I tell you      He came with"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2587"],["title","Life Is a Dream (#6)"],["body","written in his face      As now it is, when all was black as hell      About, and none of you who now--he came,      And Angel-like flung me a shining sword      To cut my way through darkness; and again      Angel-like wrests it from me in behalf      Of one--whom I will spare for sparing him:      But he must come and plead with that same voice      That pray'd for me--in vain.       CHAMB.      He is gone for,      And shall attend your pleasure, sir. Meanwhile,      Will not your Highness, as in courtesy,      Return your royal cousin's greeting?       SEG.      Whose?       CHAMB.      Astolfo, Duke of Muscovy, my Lord,      Saluted, and with gallant compliment      Welcomed you to your royal title.       SEG. (to Astolfo).      Oh--      You knew of this then?       AST.      Knew of what, my Lord?       SEG.      That I was Prince of Poland all the while,      And you my subject?       AST.      Pardon me, my Lord,      But some few hours ago myself I learn'd      Your dignity; but, knowing it, no more      Than when I knew it not, your subject.       SEG.      What then?       AST.      Your Highness' chamberlain ev'n now has told you;      Astolfo, Duke of Muscovy,      Your father's sister's son; your cousin, sir:      And who as such, and in his own right Prince,      Expects from you the courtesy he shows.       CHAMB.      His Highness is as yet unused to Court,      And to the ceremonious interchange      Of compliment, especially to those      Who draw their blood from the same royal fountain.       SEG.      Where is the lad? I weary of all this--      Prince, cousins, chamberlains, and compliments--      Where are my soldiers? Blow the trumpet, and      With one sharp blast scatter these butterflies      And bring the men of iron to my side,      With whom a king feels like a king indeed!       (Voices within. Within there! room for the Princess Estrella!)       (Enter Estrella with Ladies.)       ESTRELLA.      Welcome, my Lord, right welcome to the throne      That much too long has waited for your coming:      And, in the general voice of Poland, hear      A kinswoman and cousin's no less sincere.       SEG.      Ay, this is welcome-worth indeed,      And cousin cousin-worth! Oh, I have thus      Over the threshold of the mountain seen,      Leading a bevy of fair stars, the moon      Enter the court of heaven--My kinswoman!      My cousin! But my subject?--       EST.      If you please      To count your cousin for your subject, sir,      You shall not find her a disloyal.       SEG.      Oh,      But there are twin stars in that heavenly face,      That now I know for having over-ruled      Those evil ones that darken'd all my past      And brought me forth from that captivity      To be the slave of her who set me free.       EST.      Indeed, my Lord, these eyes have no such power      Over the past or present: but perhaps      They brighten at your welcome to supply      The little that a lady's speech commends;      And in the hope that, let whichever be      The other's subject, we may both be friends.       SEG.      Your hand to that--But why does this warm hand      Shoot a cold shudder through me?       EST.      In revenge      For likening me to that cold moon, perhaps.       SEG.      Oh, but the lip whose music tells me so      Breathes of a warmer planet, and that lip      Shall remedy the treason of the hand!      (He catches to embrace her.)       EST.      Release me, sir!       CHAMB.      And pardon me, my Lord.      This lady is a Princess absolute,      As Prince he is who just saluted you,      And claims her by affiance.       SEG.      Hence, old fool,      For ever thrusting that white stick of yours      Between me and my pleasure!       AST.      This cause is mine.      Forbear, sir--       SEG.      What, sir mouth-piece, you again?       AST.      My Lord, I waive your insult to myself      In recognition of the dignity      You yet are new to, and that greater still      You look in time to wear. But for this lady--      Whom, if my cousin now, I hope to claim      Henceforth by yet a nearer, dearer name--       SEG.      And what care I? She is my cousin too:      And if you be a Prince--well, am not I      Lord of the very soil you stand upon?      By that, and by that right beside of blood      That like a fiery fountain hitherto      Pent in the rock leaps toward her at her touch,      Mine, before all the cousins in Muscovy!      You call me Prince of Poland, and yourselves      My subjects--traitors therefore to this hour,      Who let me perish all my youth away      Chain'd there among the mountains; till, forsooth,      Terrified at your treachery foregone,      You spirit me up here, I know not how,      Popinjay-like invest me like yourselves,      Choke me with scent and music that I loathe,      And, worse than all the music and the scent,      With false, long-winded, fulsome compliment,      That 'Oh, you are my subjects!' and in word      Reiterating still obedience,      Thwart me in deed at every step I take:      When just about to wreak a just revenge      Upon that old arch-traitor of you all,      Filch from my vengeance him I hate; and him      I loved--the first and only face--till this--      I cared to look on in your ugly court--      And now when palpably I grasp at last      What hitherto but shadow'd in my dreams--      Affiances and interferences,      The first who dares to meddle with me more--      Princes and chamberlains and counsellors,      Touch her who dares!--       AST.      That dare I--       SEG. (seizing him by the throat).      You dare!       CHAMB.      My Lord!--       A LORD.      His strength's a lion's--       (Voices within. The King! The King!--)       (Enter King.)       A LORD.      And on a sudden how he stands at gaze      As might a wolf just fasten'd on his prey,      Glaring at a suddenly encounter'd lion.       KING.      And I that hither flew with open arms      To fold them round my son, must now return      To press them to an empty heart again!      (He sits on the throne.)       SEG.      That is the King?--My father?      (After a long pause.)      I have heard      That sometimes some blind instinct has been known      To draw to mutual recognition those      Of the same blood, beyond all memory      Divided, or ev'n never met before.      I know not how this is--perhaps in brutes      That live by kindlier instincts--but I know      That looking now upon that head whose crown      Pronounces him a sovereign king, I feel      No setting of the current in my blood      Tow'rd him as sire. How is't with you, old man,      Tow'rd him they call your son?--       KING.      Alas! Alas!       SEG.      Your sorrow, then?       KING.      Beholding what I do.       SEG.      Ay, but how know this sorrow that has grown      And moulded to this present shape of man,      As of your own creation?       KING.      Ev'n from birth.       SEG.      But from that hour to this, near, as I think,      Some twenty such renewals of the year      As trace themselves upon the barren rocks,      I never saw you, nor you me--unless,      Unless, indeed, through one of those dark masks      Through which a son might fail to recognize      The best of fathers.       KING.      Be that as you will:      But, now we see each other face to face,      Know me as you I know; which did I not,      By whatsoever signs, assuredly      You were not here to prove it at my risk.       SEG.      You are my father.      And is it true then, as Clotaldo swears,      'Twas you that from the dawning birth of one      Yourself brought into being,--you, I say,      Who stole his very birthright; not alone      That secondary and peculiar right      Of sovereignty, but even that prime      Inheritance that all men share alike,      And chain'd him--chain'd him!--like a wild beast's whelp.      Among as savage mountains, to this hour?      Answer if this be thus.       KING.      Oh, Segismund,      In all that I have done that seems to you,      And, without further hearing, fairly seems,      Unnatural and cruel--'twas not I,      But One who writes His order in the sky      I dared not misinterpret nor neglect,      Who knows with what reluctance--       SEG.      Oh, those stars,      Those stars, that too far up from human blame      To clear themselves, or careless of the charge,      Still bear upon their shining shoulders all      The guilt men shift upon them!       KING.      Nay, but think:      Not only on the common score of kind,      But that peculiar count of sovereignty--      If not behind the beast in brain as heart,      How should I thus deal with my innocent child,      Doubly desired, and doubly dear when come,      As that sweet second-self that all desire,      And princes more than all, to root themselves      By that succession in their people's hearts,      Unless at that superior Will, to which      Not kings alone, but sovereign nature bows?       SEG.      And what had those same stars to tell of me      That should compel a father and a king      So much against that double instinct?       KING.      That,      Which I have brought you hither, at my peril,      Against their written warning, to disprove,      By justice, mercy, human kindliness.       SEG.      And therefore made yourself their instrument      To make your son the savage and the brute      They only prophesied?--Are you not afear'd,      Lest, irrespective as such creatures are      Of such relationship, the brute you made      Revenge the man you marr'd--like sire, like son.      To do by you as you by me have done?       KING.      You never had a savage heart from me;      I may appeal to Poland.       SEG.      Then from whom?      If pure in fountain, poison'd by yourself      When scarce begun to flow.--To make a man      Not, as I see, degraded from the mould      I came from, nor compared to those about,      And then "]]]
