If you put your finger on a hot stove, in an instant a message goes on the nerve telegraph to the brain. It tells that wise thinking part that your finger will burn, if it stays on the stove.  In another instant, the brain sends back a message to the muscles that move that finger, saying: \"Contract quickly, bend the joint, and take that poor finger away so that it will not be burned.\"  You can hardly believe that there was time for all this sending of messages; for as soon as you felt the hot stove, you pulled your finger away. But you really could not have pulled it away, unless the brain had sent word to the muscles to do it.  Now, you know what we mean when we say, \"As quick as thought.\" Surely nothing could be quicker.  You see that the brain has a great deal of work to do, for it has to send so many orders.  There are some muscles which are moving quietly and steadily all the time, though we take no notice of the motion.  You do not have to think about breathing, and yet the muscles work all the time, moving your chest.  If we had to think about it every time we breathed, we should have no time to think of any thing else.  There is one part of the brain that takes care of such work for us. It sends the messages about breathing, and keeps the breathing muscles and many other muscles faithfully at work. It does all this without our needing to know or think about it at all.  Do you begin to see that your body is a busy work-shop, where many kinds of work are being done all day and all night?  Although we lie still and sleep in the night, the breathing must go on, and so must the work of those other organs that never stop until we die.   OTHER WORK OF THE NERVES.  The little white nerve-threads lie smoothly side by side, making small white cords. Each kind of message goes on its own thread, so that the messages need never get mixed or confused.  These nerves are very delicate little messengers. They do all the feeling for the whole body, and by means of them we have many pains and many pleasures.  If there was no nerve in your tooth it could not ache. But if there were no nerves in your mouth and tongue, you could not taste your food.  If there were no nerves in your hands, you might cut them and feel no pain. But you could not feel your mother's soft, warm hand, as she laid it on yours.  One of your first duties is the care of yourselves.  Children may say: \"My father and mother take care of me.\" But even while you are young, there are some ways in which no one can take care of you but yourselves. The older you grow, the more this care will belong to you, and to no one else.  Think of the work all the parts of the body do for us, and how they help us to be well and happy. Certainly the least we can do is to take care of them and keep them in good order.   CARE OF THE BRAIN AND NERVES.  As one part of the brain has to take care of all the rest of the body, and keep every organ at work, of course it can never go to sleep itself. If it did, the heart would stop pumping, the lungs would leave off breathing, all other work would stop, and the body would be dead.  But there is another part of the brain which does the thinking, and this part needs rest.  When you are asleep, you are not thinking, but you are breathing and other work of the body is going on.  If the thinking part of the brain does not have good quiet sleep, it will soon wear out. A worn-out brain is not easy to repair.  If well cared for, your brain will do the best of work for you for seventy or eighty years without complaining.  The nerves are easily tired out, and they need much rest. They get tired if we do one thing too long at a time; they are rested by a change of work.   IS ALCOHOL GOOD FOR THE NERVES AND THE BRAIN?  Think of the wonderful work the brain is all the time doing for you!  You ought to give it the best of food to keep it in good working order. Any drink that contains alcohol is not a food to make one strong; but is a poison to hurt, and at last to kill.  It injures the brain and nerves so that they can not work well, and send their messages properly. That is why the drunkard does not know what he is about.  Newspapers often tell us about people setting houses on fire; about men who forgot to turn the switch, and so wrecked a railroad train; about men who lay down on the railroad track and were run over by the cars.  Often these stories end with: \"The person had been drinking.\" When the nerves are put to sleep by alcohol, people become careless and do not do their work faithfully; sometimes, they can not even tell the difference between a railroad track and a place of safety. The brain receives no message, or the wrong one, and the person does not know what he is doing.  You may say that all men who drink liquor do not do such terrible things.  That is true. A little alcohol is not so bad as a great deal. But even a little makes the head ache, and hurts the brain and nerves.  A body kept pure and strong is of great service to its owner. There are people who are not drunkards, but who often drink a little liquor. By this means, they slowly poison their bodies.  When sickness comes upon them, they are less able to bear it, and less likely to get well again, than those who have never injured their bodies with alcohol.  When a sick or wounded man is brought into the hospital, one of the first questions asked him by the doctor is: \"Do you drink?\"  If he answers \"Yes!\" the next questions are, \"What do you drink?\" and \"How much?\"  The answers he gives to these questions, show the doctor what chance the man has of getting well.  A man who never drinks liquor will get well, where a drinking man would surely die.   TOBACCO AND THE NERVES.  Why does any one wish to use tobacco?  Because many men say that it helps them, and makes them feel better.  Shall I tell you how it makes them feel better?  If a man is cold, the tobacco deadens his nerves so that he does not feel the cold and does not take pains to make himself warmer.  If a man is tired, or in trouble, tobacco will not really rest him or help him out of his trouble.  It only puts his nerves to sleep and helps him think that he is not tired, and that he does not need to overcome his troubles.  It puts his nerves to sleep very much as alcohol does, and helps him to be contented with what ought not to content him.  A boy who smokes or chews tobacco, is not so good a scholar as if he did not use the poison. He can not remember his lessons so well.  Usually, too, he is not so polite, nor so good a boy as he otherwise would be.   REVIEW QUESTIONS.             1. How do the muscles know when to move?             2.

This juice is mostly water, sweetened with a sugar of its own. It is flavored with something which makes us know, the moment we taste it, that it is grape-juice, and not cherry-juice or plum-juice.  Apples also contain water, sugar, and apple flavor; and cherries contain water, sugar, and cherry flavor. The same is true of other fruits. They all, when ripe, have the water and the sugar; and each has a flavor of its own.  Ripe grapes are sometimes gathered and put into great tubs called vats. In these the juice is squeezed out.  In some countries, this squeezing is done by bare-footed men who jump into the vats and press the grapes with their feet.  The grape-juice is then drawn off from the skins and seeds and left standing in a warm place.  Bubbles soon begin to rise and cover the top of it with froth. The juice is all in motion.  [Illustration: _Picking grapes and making wine._]  If the cook had wished to use this grape-juice to make jelly, she would say: \"Now, I can not make my grape-jelly, for the grape-juice is spoiled.\"   WHAT IS THIS CHANGE IN THE GRAPE-JUICE?  The sugar in the grape-juice is changing into something else. It is turning into alcohol and a gas[A] that moves about in little bubbles in the liquid, and rising to the top,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25646"],["title","Child's Health Primer For Primary Classes (#3)"],["body","off into the air. The alcohol is a thin liquid which, mixed with the water, remains in the grape-juice.  The sugar is gone; alcohol and the bubbles of gas are left in its place.  This alcohol is a liquid poison. A little of it will harm any one who drinks it; much of it would kill the drinker.  Ripe grapes are good food; but grape-juice, when its sugar has turned to alcohol, is not a safe drink for any one. It is poisoned by the alcohol.   WINE.  This changed grape-juice is called wine. It is partly water, partly alcohol, and it still has the grape flavor in it.  Wine is also made from currants, elderberries, and other fruits, in very much the same way as from grapes.  People sometimes make it at home from the fruits that grow in their own gardens, and think there is no alcohol in it, because they do not put any in.  But you know that the alcohol is made in the fruit-juice itself by the change of the sugar into alcohol and the gas.  [Illustration]  It is the nature of alcohol to make the person who takes a little of it, in wine, or any other drink, want more and more alcohol. When one goes on, thus taking more and more of the drinks that contain alcohol, he is called a drunkard.  In this way wine has made many drunkards. Alcohol hurts both the body and mind. It changes the person who drinks it. It will make a good and kind person cruel and bad; and will make a bad person worse.  Every one who takes wine does not become a drunkard, but you are not sure that you will not, if you drink it.  You should not drink wine, because there is alcohol in it.   CIDER.  Cider is made from apples. In a few hours after the juice is pressed out of the apples, if it is left open to the air the sugar begins to change.  Like the sugar in the grape, it changes into alcohol and bubbles of gas.  At first, there is but little alcohol in cider, but a little of this poison is dangerous.  More alcohol is all the time forming until in ten cups of cider there may be one cup of alcohol. Cider often makes its drinkers ill-tempered and cross.  Cider and wine will turn into vinegar if left in a warm place long enough.   REVIEW QUESTIONS.             1. What two things are in all fruit-juices?             2.

[Illustration: A]LCOHOL is often made from grains as well as from fruit. The grain has starch instead of sugar.  If the starch in your mother's starch-box at home should be changed into sugar, you would think it a very strange thing.  Every year, in the spring-time, many thousand pounds of starch are changed into sugar in a hidden, quiet way, so that most of us think nothing about it.   STARCH AND SUGAR.  All kinds of grain are full of starch.  If you plant them in the ground, where they are kept moist and warm, they begin to sprout and grow, to send little roots down into the earth, and little stems up into the sunshine.  These little roots and stems must be fed with sugar; thus, in a wise way, which is too wonderful for you to understand, as soon as the seed begins to sprout, its starch begins to turn into sugar.  [Illustration]  If you should chew two grains of wheat, one before sprouting and one after, you could tell by the taste that this is true.  Barley is a kind of grain from which the brewer makes beer.  He must first turn its starch into sugar, so he begins by sprouting his grain.  Of course he does not plant it in the ground, because it would need to be quickly dug up again.  He keeps it warm and moist in a place where he can watch it, and stop the sprouting just in time to save the sugar, before it is used to feed the root and stem. This sprouted grain is called malt.  The brewer soaks it in plenty of water, because the grain has not water in itself, as the grape has.  He puts in some yeast to help start the work of changing the sugar into gas[B] and alcohol.  Sometimes hops are also put in, to give it a bitter taste.  The brewer watches to see the bubbles of gas that tell, as plainly as words could, that sugar is going and alcohol is coming.  When the work is finished, the barley has been made into beer.  It might have been ground and made into barley-cakes, or into pearl barley to thicken our soups, and then it would have been good food. Now, it is a drink containing alcohol, and alcohol is a poison.  You should not drink beer, because there is alcohol in it.  Two boys of the same age begin school together. One of them drinks wine, cider, and beer. The other never allows these drinks to pass his lips. These boys soon become very different from each other, because one is poisoning his body and mind with alcohol, and the other is not.  A man wants a good, steady boy to work for him. Which of these two do you think he will select? A few years later, a young man is wanted who can be trusted with the care of an engine or a bank. It is a good chance. Which of these young men will be more likely to get it?   REVIEW QUESTIONS.             1. Is there sugar in grain?             2.

FOOTNOTE:  [Footnote B: Car bon´ic acid gas.]     CHAPTER VI.  DISTILLING.   [Illustration: D]ISTILLING (dĭs tĭlł´ing) may be a new word to you, but you can easily learn its meaning.  You have all seen distilling going on in the kitchen at home, many a time. When the water in the tea-kettle is boiling, what comes out at the nose? Steam.  What is steam?  You can find out what it is by catching some of it on a cold plate, or tin cover. As soon as it touches any thing cold, it turns into drops of water.  When we boil water and turn it into steam, and then turn the steam back into water, we have distilled the water. We say vapor instead of steam, when we talk about the boiling of alcohol.  It takes less heat to turn alcohol to vapor than to turn water to steam; so, if we put over the fire some liquid that contains alcohol, and begin to collect the vapor as it rises, we shall get alcohol first, and then water.  But the alcohol will not be pure alcohol; it will be part water, because it is so ready to mix with water that it has to be distilled many times to be pure.  But each time it is distilled, it will become stronger, because there is a little more alcohol and a little less water.  In this way, brandy, rum, whiskey, and gin are distilled, from wine, cider, and the liquors which have been made from corn, rye, or barley.  The cider, wine, and beer had but little alcohol in them. The brandy, rum, whiskey, and gin are nearly one-half alcohol.  A glass of strong liquor which has been made by distilling, will injure any one more, and quicker, than a glass of cider, rum, or beer.  But a cider, wine, or beer-drinker often drinks so much more of the weaker liquor, that he gets a great deal of alcohol. People are often made drunkards by drinking cider or beer. The more poison, the more danger.   REVIEW QUESTIONS.             1. Where have you ever seen distilling going on?             2. How can you distill water?             3. How can men separate alcohol from wine or from                any other liquor that contains it?             4. Why will not this be pure alcohol?             5.
