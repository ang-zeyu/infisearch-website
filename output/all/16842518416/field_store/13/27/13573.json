PAUL.      Go, monster! woo thy death! Thou lov'dst me never!       POLY.      Go, seek the world! and yet I love thee ever!       PAUL.      Yes, I will go--if absence bring relief--       (Enter Severus, Fabian and Guards)       Who comes to invade, ah, not to cure my grief?      Severus! Who could guess that thou wouldst show      Revenge unworthy o'er a prostrate foe?       POLY.      Unworthy thee the thought, Pauline, for I      Severus called, and he hath heard my cry.      My importunity he will excuse,      My prayer I know that he will not refuse.      Severus--this--the treasure that was mine      To thy most tender care I now resign:      To thee, as noblest man that I have known;--      Since earthly ties and joys I must disown.      The gift is worthy thee,--I know thy worth      Is great, but she no equal hath on earth.      My life, the bar,--my death the link shall be,--      Oh, grudge me not my dear brief ecstasy!      Oh, ease the heart that once was hers,--and guide      Her doubting footsteps to the Crucified!      This my last benison! All else is poor!      Await the promised light! Believe! Endure!      But words are vain!       (Polyeucte signs to Guards to conduct him back to prison. Exeunt      Polyeucte and Guards.)       SEV.      Most vain! No word have I      Such blindness must amaze! must stupefy!      Nay, this is frenzy! I cannot conceive      A mind so strange! Mine ears cannot believe      That one who loved thee--yet, who would not love      A face that must the great immortals move?--      Blessed by thy heart!--Thy sweetest lips to taste!--      Then leave, refuse, spurn--yield with clamorous haste,      To yield a girl so dear--so pure--so fair!      And of that gift to make thy rival heir--      This beggars madness! Or the Christian bliss      Beyond man's soul to grasp! To spurn thy kiss!--      We treasure barter for a just exchange,      But to buy pain for thee! Pauline, 'tis strange!      Not thus, ye Gods! Severus had been blind      To perfect bliss--had Fortune been more kind      The only heaven for me is in thine eyes,      These are my kings, these my divinities!      To me--for thee--were death with torture dear;      But to renounce thee!       PAUL.      Nay, I must not hear!      Thy words bring back the dear, the bygone days,      When I, a maid, might listen to thy praise:      Severus, thou must know my inmost heart;      I hear the knell bids Polyeucte depart.      He dies,--the victim of thine Emperor's laws,      And thou, though innocent, art yet the cause.      Oh, if thy soul, to thy desires a slave,      See hope emerging from my husband's grave      Then will I wed with pain--despair embrace,--      But wed Severus? Never! 'Twere disgrace!      To light fresh torch from that pale, flickering fire--      Oh, bliss too monstrous! Thrice abhorred desire!      Back, hope! Back, happiness! The mate for me      When Polyeucte leaves my side--is Constancy!      Were this my will, were this, ye Gods, my fate--      To shame would memory turn, as love must yield to hate!      But generous art thou--most generous be!      His pardon will my father grant to thee.      He fears thee: more, if Polyeucte's life he take,      For thee he slays him--yes, 'tis for thy sake.      Christ died for man--let pagan virtue dim      His fame: plead for thy foe! so rival him!      No easy boon I ask, there needs a soul most rare;      But when the fight is fierce--then is the victory fair.      To help a man to be what thou wouldst be      Is triumph that belongs alone to thee!      Let this suffice thee: she, whom thou hast loved,      She, who by thy great love was not unmoved,      Of thee, and of no other dares to crave      That thou, Severus, shouldst my husband save!      Farewell! of this thy labour gauge the scope:      If thou art less than I yet dare to hope,      Then tell me not! all else Pauline can bear!       (Exit Pauline.)       SEV.      Where am I, Fabian? Has the crack of doom      Turned heaven to hell? made life a living tomb?      Nearer and dearer ever--but to go!      The prize within my grasp must I o'erthrow?      This--Fortune's brimming cup, with poison filled,      She bids me drain;--so new-born hope is killed.      Before I proffer aught, I am refused;      Thus sad, amazed, ashamed, in doubt, abused,      I see the ghost I laid, to life revive,      The more seductive still the more I strive.      Ah! must a woman, sunk in deep despair,      Teach me that shame is base, and honour fair?      And while I madly shriek, 'O love, be kind!'      Pauline, death-stricken, keeps an equal mind!      O generous, but stern! Must these dear eyes,      Because I love them, o'er love tyrannise?      'Tis not enough to lose thee, I must give      My aid--to make my faithless rival live!      'Tis not enough: his death I would not plan,      But I must save him! bless where I would ban!       FABIAN.      Ah, let the whole crew light one funeral pyre;      Yes, let the daughter perish with her sire!      This curs'd Armenian is one hornet's nest--      Crush all, then sail for Rome, ah! this were best!      She loves thee not. What canst thou hope to gain?       SEV.      A glory that shall triumph over pain;      'Tis hers, and, by the Gods, it shall be mine!      Nor God nor fiend can sully such a shrine!       FABIAN.      Speak low, for Jove has bolts, and Hell has ears!      The dangers of this course arouse my fears.      What? Decius implore a Nazarene to save!      'Tis death that hath thy heart; thou woo'st a grave.      His rage against the sect thou knowest well,      His power unbridled--his revenge is fell.      To plead for Christians is a task too great,      For man or God: thou rushest on thy fate.       SEV.      Yes, such advice, I know, is much approved,      Yet not thus can Severus' soul be moved.      To Fate unequal--equal to myself--      In duty's path I go. For power and pelf      I never swerve where honour leads the way;      Come weal, come woe, her call I must obey.      Let fate depress an all unequal scale,      Let Clothe hold her distaff--I'll not fail!      Yet one more word--this to thy private ear--      The fables that thou dost of Christians hear      Are fables only, coined, I know not why,      Distorted are they seen in Decius' eye.      They practice the black art,--so all men say.      I sought to learn the laws that they obey,      And to discover what the secret guilt      The which to expiate their blood is spilt.      Yet priests of Cybele dark rites pursue      At Rome--untrammelled--this is nothing new:      To thousand gods men build, unchecked, their fanes,      The Christians' God alone our state disdains.      Each foul Egyptian beast his temple rears,      Caligula a god to Roman ears--      Tiberius is enshrined--a Nero deified--      To Christ--to Christ alone--a temple is denied!      Such metamorphoses confuse the mind      As gods in cats, and saints in fiends we find;      As Ruler absolute Jehovah stands,      Alone o'er heaven and earth and hell commands,      While pagan gods each 'gainst the other strive,      And ne'er one queen is found o'er all the hive,      Now--(strike me dead, Jove's tarrying thunderbolt!)      So many masters must provoke revolt.      And ah! where Christians live--there life is pure,      Vice dies untended, virtues all endure.      We give these men to rack, and cord, and flame,      While they forgive us--in their Pardoner's name.      They no sedition raise, they ne'er rebel,      Rome makes them soldiers, and they serve her well.      They rage in battle, faithful ward they keep,      They fight like lions, but they die like sheep.      They serve the State: Rome's servant must defend      Those who to might of Rome such succour lend.      Pauline, I will obey, whate'er befall;      The man who loseth honour loseth all.     ACT V--FELIX. ALBIN. CLEON       FELIX.      Caught in Severus' net thy Felix see!      He hates and holds me--oh, the misery!       ALBIN.      I see a generous man, who cries, 'Forgive,      Let Pauline smile once more--let Polyeucte live!'       FELIX.      His soul thou canst not read--tho' noble heart he feigns.      The father he abhors,--the daughter he disdains!      What Polyeucte won he sought: his suit denied,      Severus sues no more,--I know his pride.      His words, his prayers, his threats for Polyeucte plead,      His _tongue_ says, 'Listen, or be lost indeed!'      Unskilled the fowler who his snare reveals:      If at the bait I snatch--my doom is sealed:      Too plain, too coarse, this web for any fly--      Shall I this spider hail in my fatuity?      His wrath is wrath arranged, his generous fire is nursed,      That I, at Decius' hand, may meet the doom accurst,      If I should pardon grant--that grace my crime would be,      For he the spoil would reap of my credulity.      No simpleton am I, each promise to believe,      Words--oaths--are but the tools wherewith all men deceive;      Too oft escaped am I to be so lightly caught;      I know that words are wind. I know that wind is naught.      The trapper shall be trapped,--the biter shall be bit,      Unravelled is the web that he, poor fool, hath knit!       ALBIN.      Jove! What a plague to thee is this mistrust!       FELIX.      Nay, those at court must fence; their weapons never rust,      If once thou yield the clue to thread the maze,      The sequence is most plain--the man betrayed betrays;      Severus, and his gifts, alike I fear!      If Polyeucte still to reason close his ear,      Severus' love is hate--his peace is strife--      First law of nature this, 'Preserve thy life!'       ALBIN.      Ah, let Pauline at least thy grace obtain!       FELIX.      If Decius grace withhold, my pardon vain!      And--far from saving this"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2543"],["title","Polyeucte (#8)"],["body"," son--      Behold us all alike entrapped, undone!       ALBIN.      Severus' promise----       FELIX.      He can never keep!      For Decius' rage and hatred never sleep:      If for that sect abhorred Severus plead,      He trebles loss--so are we lost indeed!      One only way is ours,--that way I try:      (To Guards)      Bring Polyeucte and if he still defy,      Self-doomed, insensate, this my proffered grace,      He shall the death he wooes forthwith embrace!       ALBIN.      Ah, this is stern!       FELIX.      'Tis stern, 'tis just--as fate;      When justice drags a halting foot, too late,      She is not justice--for the vengeful mob      (Whose hearts for Polyeucte ne'er cease to throb),      Usurps her place, and, spurning curb and rein,      The felon crowns, and all our work is vain.      My sceptre trembles, and all insecure      Totters my crown,--a prey for every boor.      Then, swift, Severus hears the welcome news,      The jaundiced mind of Decius to abuse.      Shall I, the rabble's lord, obey the rabble's will?       ALBIN.      Who ill in all around foresees,--but doubles ill.      Each prop thou hast is but a sword to pierce;      If Polyeucte hold their heart, the people fierce      Will gather fiercer courage from despair.       FELIX.      Death settles all; they'll find no helper there,      And if--without a head--the body should rebel,      Convulsive throes I mock, and nerveless fury quell.      Whate'er ensues the Emperor must approve,      I shall have done my part, and win his love.      Here comes the man       (Enter Polyeucte and Soldiers)       I still must try to save;      If he repent--'tis well! If not--the grave!      (To Polyeucte)      Is life still hateful? Doth death still allure?      Is earth still naught? Do heavenly joys endure?      Doth Christ still counsel thee to hate thy wife;--      To sheathe thy sword,--to cast away thy life?       POLY.      I never hated life, or wooed a grave,      To life I am a servant--not a slave.      Here service free I give upon this earth below,--      For higher service changed when to His Home I go.      Eternal life is this: to tread the path He trod;      To Him your body yield! Then trust your soul to God!       FELIX.      Yes, trust to an abyss of depth unknown!       POLY.      No, trust to Holy Cross! That Cross my own!       FELIX.      The steep ascent, my son, I too would climb,      Yes, I would Christian be,--but--give me time,--      By Jove! I'll tread thy path! This my desire.      Else at thy hand the judge may me require!       POLY.      Nay, laugh not, Felix! He thy Judge will be,      No refuge there for impious blasphemy!      Nor kings nor clowns can 'scape His righteous ire,      His slaughtered Saints of thee will He require!       FELIX.      I'll slay no more;--by Hercules I swear!      So I a Christian crown perchance may wear;      I will protect the flock!       POLY.      Nay, rather be      A goad, a scourge, for their felicity!      Let suffering purify each Christian soul,      Cross, rack, and flame but lead them to their goal;      What here they lose--in Heaven an hundredfold they find.      Be cruel,--persecute!--and so alone be kind!      My words thou canst not read; thine eyes are blinded here,      Wait the unveiling _There_! Then understand and fear!       FELIX.      Nay, nay, in truth I would a Christian be!       POLY.      In thy hard heart alone a bar I see.       FELIX (whispering).      This Roman knight----       POLY (aloud).      Severus, thou wouldst say.       FELIX.      Once let him sail, I will no more delay,      For this I anger feign;--let him depart!       POLY.      'Tis thus thou wouldst reveal a Christian heart?      To idols dumb--to Pagans blind, thy sugared poison bear,      Christ's servants quaff another cup, sure refuge from despair.       FELIX.      What is this deadly draught that thou wouldst drain?      I'll drink thy wine.--Till then, from death refrain!       POLY.      To swine no more my holy pearls I cast,      Faith,--_faith_--not reason, shall see light at last;      Soon--when I see my God--yes, face to face,      I will implore that Felix may find grace.       FELIX.      O dearest son, thy loss were death to me!       POLY.      This loss can be repaired--the remedy      Find in Severus; he will take my place;      By Decius honoured he will not disgrace      Thy house: my death will an advantage win      For thee, for her, for me.--The work begin!       FELIX.      Such my reward! Yes, insult is the child      Of injury. The grace I grant, reviled,      Shall turn to swift revenge. The gods defied      May do their will and speed the suicide!       POLY.      I thought the gods were dead, but they revive      With human passion; Felix, do not strive      Against thy nature; lay aside thy ruth;      Who loves a lie can never follow truth.       FELIX.      I humoured madness, but the mood is o'er,      I am myself again; I did implore,--      'Twas vain; the dark abyss that yawns for thee      May hold thee now, tomb to thy constancy.      The hope I cherished--fondled--now is flown      Severus will be king, and I o'erthrown;--      Shall I the gods by incense pacify?      Or by thy death? for thou, at last, must die!       POLY.      Incense might but incense; I cannot tell:       (Enter Pauline)       Pauline!       PAUL.      That word broke from thee like a knell;      Who seeks my doom to-day? Thou--or my sire?      Who fires the brand? Who lights the funeral pyre?      My father should, by nature, be my friend,      And lover's heart to love an ear should lend.      Who here is mine ally, and who my foe?      Who has a heart to feel?--this would I know.       FELIX.      Nay, to thy lord appeal.       (Pauline turns to Polyeucte)       POLY.      Severus wed!       PAUL.      Ah, this is outrage! Rather strike me dead!       POLY.      Oh, dearer than myself to me thy weal!      My love would never wound, it seeks to heal.      I see thee wrestle with thy deep distress      Alone--unless Severus bring redress;      His merit, that once gained thy maiden heart,      Hath still that worth when I from thee must part,      Once loved--and loving still--his honour grows.       PAUL.      Thy wife's true heart another treatment owes:      O base reproach! For this I crushed for thee      My former love: that I disdained might be?      This my reward for dearest victory won,--      I did that love undo--to be myself undone!      Resolve, faith, abnegation, all were vain,      For thy return is outrage heaped on pain.      Oh, sunk in tomb of shame, most vile, most mean,      Come back to life--to honour--to Pauline!      (Holds out her arms.)      To learn from her that loyalty and faith      Religion are:--and all beside but death!      Once more Alcestis wrestles with the tomb,      Arise, arise from thy enthralling doom!      And if my invocation feeble be,      Regard the tears--the sighs,--shed--breathed for thee!      Love is too weak a word--I thee adore!       POLY.      Once have I said--yet now I say once more--      'Live with Severus, or--with Polyeucte die!'      Thy tears are mine, and thy pure constancy      I share: But--I am soldier of the Cross!      Take up thine own, and count all gain but loss!      Pauline--no more!      (To FELIX.)      Thy slumbering wrath rewake!      Thy fates and furies wait! Their vengeance slake!       PAUL.      His life is saved! These fetters all undo!--      For justice never yet a madman slew;      And he is mad,--but, father, thou art sane,      And thou, his father, must his friend remain.      A father cannot less than father be,      Oh, be to him what thou hast been to me!      But cast upon thy child a kinder eye,--      Slay him?--Then know that I am doomed to die!      But even if justly done to death were he,      The sentence wrong that, with him, slayeth me.      For double death would double wrong present,      And slay the guilty with the innocent.      'Twas thou didst link us closely hand in hand,      'To live in bliss together' thy command.      Oh, shall the will that both our lives did bless      Doom both these lives to death--to nothingness?      When lips are sealed to lips, and heart to heart,      'Tis tyranny, not law, such love to part.      Oh, not a tyrant, but a father be,      Forgive,--give back--restore my love to me!       FELIX.      Dear child, thy father is thy father still,      Nothing hath parted us, and nothing will.      My heart is tender, and it beats for thee:      Against this madman let us joined be.      O wretched man, hast thou no eyes to see, no heart to feel?      Thy guilt, thy crime, I would efface, thy pardon I would seal,      _For_ thee my daughter cannot die--say, must she die _with_ thee?      A victim to the only sin which ne'er can pardoned be.      O sight most strange! Here at thy knees as suppliant I sue!      (Felix kneels.)      The evil that thyself hast wrought--that ill thyself undo!       POLY.      Arise, old man, from knees unused to bend,      Or to another ear petition send!      This artifice befits nor me nor thee,      To beg of one twice threatened!--Mockery!      First, by thy hand Nearchus felt the flame,      Then love, forsooth, thy plea--(profaned name!)      The path of Christian neophyte hast thou trod,      And, in God's name, hast mocked Almighty God!      Earth, heaven, and hell in turn have been thy tool,      And him thou hast traduced thou wouldst befool!      Go,--bully-flatterer--liar!--Every part      Thou playest, while delay doth break my heart!      Enough of dallying! While thou dost dissolve      Thy feeble soul in doubt, hear my resolve:      The God who made me--Him will I adore;      He holds my plighted faith,--and evermore      He works salvation for his ransomed race--      Who gave His Son to death that we might life embrace;      And this--Christ's sacrifice--continued day by"]]]
