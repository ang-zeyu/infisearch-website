A ladder, naively placed on the outside,       was to serve as means of communication between the dressing-room       and the stage, and lend its rude rungs to entrances as well as to       exits. There was no personage, however unexpected, no sudden       change, no theatrical effect, which was not obliged to mount that       ladder. Innocent and venerable infancy of art and contrivances!        Four of the bailiff of the palace’s sergeants, perfunctory       guardians of all the pleasures of the people, on days of festival       as well as on days of execution, stood at the four corners of the       marble table.        The piece was only to begin with the twelfth stroke of the great       palace clock sounding midday. It was very late, no doubt, for a       theatrical representation, but they had been obliged to fix the       hour to suit the convenience of the ambassadors.        Now, this whole multitude had been waiting since morning. A       goodly number of curious, good people had been shivering since       daybreak before the grand staircase of the palace; some even       affirmed that they had passed the night across the threshold of       the great door, in order to make sure that they should be the       first to pass in. The crowd grew more dense every moment, and,       like water, which rises above its normal level, began to mount       along the walls, to swell around the pillars, to spread out on       the entablatures, on the cornices, on the window-sills, on all       the salient points of the architecture, on all the reliefs of the       sculpture. Hence, discomfort, impatience, weariness, the liberty       of a day of cynicism and folly, the quarrels which break forth       for all sorts of causes—a pointed elbow, an iron-shod shoe, the       fatigue of long waiting—had already, long before the hour       appointed for the arrival of the ambassadors, imparted a harsh       and bitter accent to the clamor of these people who were shut in,       fitted into each other, pressed, trampled upon, stifled. Nothing       was to be heard but imprecations on the Flemish, the provost of       the merchants, the Cardinal de Bourbon, the bailiff of the       courts, Madame Marguerite of Austria, the sergeants with their       rods, the cold, the heat, the bad weather, the Bishop of Paris,       the Pope of the Fools, the pillars, the statues, that closed       door, that open window; all to the vast amusement of a band of       scholars and lackeys scattered through the mass, who mingled with       all this discontent their teasing remarks, and their malicious       suggestions, and pricked the general bad temper with a pin, so to       speak.        Among the rest there was a group of those merry imps, who, after       smashing the glass in a window, had seated themselves hardily on       the entablature, and from that point despatched their gaze and       their railleries both within and without, upon the throng in the       hall, and the throng upon the Place. It was easy to see, from       their parodied gestures, their ringing laughter, the bantering       appeals which they exchanged with their comrades, from one end of       the hall to the other, that these young clerks did not share the       weariness and fatigue of the rest of the spectators, and that       they understood very well the art of extracting, for their own       private diversion from that which they had under their eyes, a       spectacle which made them await the other with patience.        “Upon my soul, so it’s you, ‘Joannes Frollo de Molendino!’” cried       one of them, to a sort of little, light-haired imp, with a       well-favored and malign countenance, clinging to the acanthus       leaves of a capital; “you are well named John of the Mill, for       your two arms and your two legs have the air of four wings       fluttering on the breeze. How long have you been here?”        “By the mercy of the devil,” retorted Joannes Frollo, “these four       hours and more; and I hope that they will be reckoned to my       credit in purgatory. I heard the eight singers of the King of       Sicily intone the first verse of seven o’clock mass in the       Sainte-Chapelle.”        “Fine singers!” replied the other, “with voices even more pointed       than their caps! Before founding a mass for Monsieur Saint John,       the king should have inquired whether Monsieur Saint John likes       Latin droned out in a Provençal accent.”        “He did it for the sake of employing those accursed singers of       the King of Sicily!” cried an old woman sharply from among the       crowd beneath the window. “I just put it to you! A thousand       _livres parisi_ for a mass! and out of the tax on sea fish in the       markets of Paris, to boot!”        “Peace, old crone,” said a tall, grave person, stopping up his       nose on the side towards the fishwife; “a mass had to be founded.       Would you wish the king to fall ill again?”        “Bravely spoken, Sire Gilles Lecornu, master furrier of king’s       robes!” cried the little student, clinging to the capital.        A shout of laughter from all the students greeted the unlucky       name of the poor furrier of the king’s robes.        “Lecornu! Gilles Lecornu!” said some.        “_Cornutus et hirsutus_, horned and hairy,” another went on.        “He! of course,” continued the small imp on the capital, “What       are they laughing at? An honorable man is Gilles Lecornu, brother       of Master Jehan Lecornu, provost of the king’s house, son of       Master Mahiet Lecornu, first porter of the Bois de Vincennes,—all       _bourgeois_ of Paris, all married, from father to son.”        The gayety redoubled. The big furrier, without uttering a word in       reply, tried to escape all the eyes riveted upon him from all       sides; but he perspired and panted in vain; like a wedge entering       the wood, his efforts served only to bury still more deeply in       the shoulders of his neighbors, his large, apoplectic face,       purple with spite and rage.        At length one of these, as fat, short, and venerable as himself,       came to his rescue.        “Abomination! scholars addressing a _bourgeois_ in that fashion       in my day would have been flogged with a fagot, which would have       afterwards been used to burn them.”        The whole band burst into laughter.        “Holà hé! who is scolding so? Who is that screech owl of evil       fortune?”        “Hold, I know him” said one of them; “’tis Master Andry Musnier.”        “Because he is one of the four sworn booksellers of the       university!” said the other.        “Everything goes by fours in that shop,” cried a third; “the four       nations, the four faculties, the four feasts, the four       procurators, the four electors, the four booksellers.”        “Well,” began Jean Frollo once more, “we must play the devil with       them.”[2]        “Musnier, we’ll burn your books.”        “Musnier, we’ll beat your lackeys.”        “Musnier, we’ll kiss your wife.”        “That fine, big Mademoiselle Oudarde.”        “Who is as fresh and as gay as though she were a widow.”        “Devil take you!” growled Master Andry Musnier.        “Master Andry,” pursued Jean Jehan, still clinging to his       capital, “hold your tongue, or I’ll drop on your head!”        Master Andry raised his eyes, seemed to measure in an instant the       height of the pillar, the weight of the scamp, mentally       multiplied that weight by the square of the velocity and remained       silent.        Jehan, master of the field of battle, pursued triumphantly:        “That’s what I’ll do, even if I am the brother of an archdeacon!”        “Fine gentry are our people of the university, not to have caused       our privileges to be respected on such a day as this! However,       there is a maypole and a bonfire in the town; a mystery, Pope of       the Fools, and Flemish ambassadors in the city; and, at the       university, nothing!”        “Nevertheless, the Place Maubert is sufficiently large!”       interposed one of the clerks established on the window-sill.        “Down with the rector, the electors, and the procurators!” cried       Joannes.        “We must have a bonfire this evening in the Champ-Gaillard,” went       on the other, “made of Master Andry’s books.”        “And the desks of the scribes!” added his neighbor.        “And the beadles’ wands!”        “And the spittoons of the deans!”        “And the cupboards of the procurators!”        “And the hutches of the electors!”        “And the stools of the rector!”        “Down with them!” put in little Jehan, as counterpoint; “down       with Master Andry, the beadles and the scribes; the theologians,       the doctors and the decretists; the procurators, the electors and       the rector!”        “The end of the world has come!” muttered Master Andry, stopping       up his ears.        “By the way, there’s the rector! see, he is passing through the       Place,” cried one of those in the window.        Each rivalled his neighbor in his haste to turn towards the       Place.        “Is it really our venerable rector, Master Thibaut?” demanded       Jehan Frollo du Moulin, who, as he was clinging to one of the       inner pillars, could not see what was going on outside.        “Yes, yes,” replied all the others, “it is really he, Master       Thibaut, the rector.”        It was, in fact, the rector and all the dignitaries of the       university, who were marching in procession in front of the       embassy, and at that moment traversing the Place. The students       crowded into the window, saluted them as they passed with       sarcasms and ironical applause. The rector, who was walking at       the head of his company, had"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2610"],["title","Notre-Dame de Paris (#3)"],["body","support the first broadside; it       was severe.        “Good day, monsieur le recteur! Holà hé! good day there!”        “How does he manage to be here, the old gambler? Has he abandoned       his dice?”        “How he trots along on his mule! her ears are not so long as       his!”        “Holà hé! good day, monsieur le recteur Thibaut! _Tybalde       aleator_! Old fool! old gambler!”        “God preserve you! Did you throw double six often last night?”        “Oh! what a decrepit face, livid and haggard and drawn with the       love of gambling and of dice!”        “Where are you bound for in that fashion, Thibaut, _Tybalde ad       dados_, with your back turned to the university, and trotting       towards the town?”        “He is on his way, no doubt, to seek a lodging in the Rue       Thibautodé?”[3] cried Jehan du M. Moulin.        The entire band repeated this quip in a voice of thunder,       clapping their hands furiously.        “You are going to seek a lodging in the Rue Thibautodé, are you       not, monsieur le recteur, gamester on the side of the devil?”        Then came the turns of the other dignitaries.        “Down with the beadles! down with the mace-bearers!”        “Tell me, Robin Pouissepain, who is that yonder?”        “He is Gilbert de Suilly, _Gilbertus de Soliaco_, the chancellor       of the College of Autun.”        “Hold on, here’s my shoe; you are better placed than I, fling it       in his face.”        “_Saturnalitias mittimus ecce nuces_.”        “Down with the six theologians, with their white surplices!”        “Are those the theologians? I thought they were the white geese       given by Sainte-Geneviève to the city, for the fief of Roogny.”        “Down with the doctors!”        “Down with the cardinal disputations, and quibblers!”        “My cap to you, Chancellor of Sainte-Geneviève! You have done me       a wrong. ’Tis true; he gave my place in the nation of Normandy to       little Ascanio Falzapada, who comes from the province of Bourges,       since he is an Italian.”        “That is an injustice,” said all the scholars. “Down with the       Chancellor of Sainte-Geneviève!”        “Ho hé! Master Joachim de Ladehors! Ho hé! Louis Dahuille! Ho hé       Lambert Hoctement!”        “May the devil stifle the procurator of the German nation!”        “And the chaplains of the Sainte-Chapelle, with their gray       _amices; cum tunices grisis_!”        “_Seu de pellibus grisis fourratis_!”        “Holà hé! Masters of Arts! All the beautiful black copes! all the       fine red copes!”        “They make a fine tail for the rector.”        “One would say that he was a Doge of Venice on his way to his       bridal with the sea.”        “Say, Jehan! here are the canons of Sainte-Geneviève!”        “To the deuce with the whole set of canons!”        “Abbé Claude Choart! Doctor Claude Choart! Are you in search of       Marie la Giffarde?”        “She is in the Rue de Glatigny.”        “She is making the bed of the king of the debauchees.”        “She is paying her four deniers[4] _quatuor denarios_.”        “_Aut unum bombum_.”        “Would you like to have her pay you in the face?”        “Comrades! Master Simon Sanguin, the Elector of Picardy, with his       wife on the crupper!”        “_Post equitem sedet atra cura_—behind the horseman sits black       care.”        “Courage, Master Simon!”        “Good day, Mister Elector!”        “Good night, Madame Electress!”        “How happy they are to see all that!” sighed Joannes de       Molendino, still perched in the foliage of his capital.        Meanwhile, the sworn bookseller of the university, Master Andry       Musnier, was inclining his ear to the furrier of the king’s       robes, Master Gilles Lecornu.        “I tell you, sir, that the end of the world has come. No one has       ever beheld such outbreaks among the students! It is the accursed       inventions of this century that are ruining       everything,—artilleries, bombards, and, above all, printing, that       other German pest. No more manuscripts, no more books! printing       will kill bookselling. It is the end of the world that is drawing       nigh.”        “I see that plainly, from the progress of velvet stuffs,” said       the fur-merchant.        At this moment, midday sounded.        “Ha!” exclaimed the entire crowd, in one voice.        The scholars held their peace. Then a great hurly-burly ensued; a       vast movement of feet, hands, and heads; a general outbreak of       coughs and handkerchiefs; each one arranged himself, assumed his       post, raised himself up, and grouped himself. Then came a great       silence; all necks remained outstretched, all mouths remained       open, all glances were directed towards the marble table. Nothing       made its appearance there. The bailiff’s four sergeants were       still there, stiff, motionless, as painted statues. All eyes       turned to the estrade reserved for the Flemish envoys. The door       remained closed, the platform empty. This crowd had been waiting       since daybreak for three things: noonday, the embassy from       Flanders, the mystery play. Noonday alone had arrived on time.        On this occasion, it was too much.        They waited one, two, three, five minutes, a quarter of an hour;       nothing came. The dais remained empty, the theatre dumb. In the       meantime, wrath had succeeded to impatience. Irritated words       circulated in a low tone, still, it is true. “The mystery! the       mystery!” they murmured, in hollow voices. Heads began to       ferment. A tempest, which was only rumbling in the distance as       yet, was floating on the surface of this crowd. It was Jehan du       Moulin who struck the first spark from it.        “The mystery, and to the devil with the Flemings!” he exclaimed       at the full force of his lungs, twining like a serpent around his       pillar.        The crowd clapped their hands.        “The mystery!” it repeated, “and may all the devils take       Flanders!”        “We must have the mystery instantly,” resumed the student; “or       else, my advice is that we should hang the bailiff of the courts,       by way of a morality and a comedy.”        “Well said,” cried the people, “and let us begin the hanging with       his sergeants.”        A grand acclamation followed. The four poor fellows began to turn       pale, and to exchange glances. The crowd hurled itself towards       them, and they already beheld the frail wooden railing, which       separated them from it, giving way and bending before the       pressure of the throng.        It was a critical moment.        “To the sack, to the sack!” rose the cry on all sides.        At that moment, the tapestry of the dressing-room, which we have       described above, was raised, and afforded passage to a personage,       the mere sight of whom suddenly stopped the crowd, and changed       its wrath into curiosity as by enchantment.        “Silence! silence!”        The personage, but little reassured, and trembling in every limb,       advanced to the edge of the marble table with a vast amount of       bows, which, in proportion as he drew nearer, more and more       resembled genuflections.        In the meanwhile, tranquillity had gradually been restored. All       that remained was that slight murmur which always rises above the       silence of a crowd.        “Messieurs the _bourgeois_,” said he, “and mesdemoiselles the       _bourgeoises_, we shall have the honor of declaiming and       representing, before his eminence, monsieur the cardinal, a very       beautiful morality which has for its title, ‘The Good Judgment of       Madame the Virgin Mary.’ I am to play Jupiter. His eminence is,       at this moment, escorting the very honorable embassy of the Duke       of Austria; which is detained, at present, listening to the       harangue of monsieur the rector of the university, at the gate       Baudets. As soon as his illustrious eminence, the cardinal,       arrives, we will begin.”        It is certain, that nothing less than the intervention of Jupiter       was required to save the four unfortunate sergeants of the       bailiff of the courts. If we had the happiness of having invented       this very veracious tale, and of being, in consequence,       responsible for it before our Lady Criticism, it is not against       us that the classic precept, _Nec deus intersit_, could be       invoked. Moreover, the costume of Seigneur Jupiter, was very       handsome, and contributed not a little towards calming the crowd,       by attracting all its attention. Jupiter was clad in a coat of       mail, covered with black velvet, with gilt nails; and had it not       been for the rouge, and the huge red beard, each of which covered       one-half of his face,—had it not been for the roll of gilded       cardboard, spangled, and all bristling with strips of tinsel,       which he held in his hand, and in which the eyes of the initiated       easily recognized thunderbolts,—had not his feet been       flesh-colored, and banded with ribbons in Greek fashion, he might       have borne comparison, so far as the severity of his mien was       concerned, with a Breton archer from the guard of Monsieur de       Berry.          CHAPTER II. PIERRE GRINGOIRE.        Nevertheless, as be harangued them, the satisfaction and       admiration unanimously excited by his costume were dissipated by       his words; and when he reached that untoward conclusion: “As soon       as his illustrious eminence, the cardinal, arrives, we will       begin,” his voice was drowned in a thunder of hooting.        “Begin instantly! The mystery! the mystery immediately!” shrieked       the people. And above all the voices, that of Johannes de       Molendino was audible, piercing the uproar like the fife’s       derisive serenade: “Commence instantly!” yelped the scholar.        “Down with Jupiter and the"]]]
