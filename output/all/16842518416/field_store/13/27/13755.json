Madaline was almost too far away to take part in the conversation, she was plainly afraid of the woman in the bushes.  \"What is the rest of your name--Mary what?\" insisted Grace.  \"Reda says it is only Maid Mary, but I know the rest of it, and some day I am going to tell it!\" flashed the child with a sudden blaze of defiance.  \"Where are the twin chestnuts?\" asked Cleo, determined not to thus leave the clew they had so eagerly sought.  \"Over the mountain by the lake,\" replied Mary, and \"Good-by,\" she almost sobbed.  \"I love you!  There!\" she cried, springing over the little stream at their feet, just as the unwelcome figure of old Reda emerged from the blackberry patch.  The girls stood staring at the fleeing child.  They saw the old women put her hand up to shade her eyes, that she might better see who they were, for undoubtedly she suspected Mary had spoken to them.  Then Cleo whispered to Grace:  \"Make believe picking something!  Don't let her see us looking.\"  \"Here are some more!\" called Grace loudly to Madaline, waving a bunch of quickly gathered daisies and clover.  \"Wait a minute, and see this one.\"  The call was given to throw the old woman off the track, and give her the impression that nothing more than flower gathering had been their intent.  Madaline appeared glad enough to see Grace and Cleo coming toward her, for at that very moment she had decided to run.  \"Can you see what--the old woman is doing?\" Grace asked Cleo.  \"Don't look--back--directly but stop to pick up something, then you can see.\"  \"She must be scolding,\" replied Cleo, \"for she's wagging her head, and shaking her old brown fist.  Dear me, how I hated to let her swallow up that lovely girl.  Do you suppose we can ever rescue her?\"  \"Do I?\" flaunted Grace.  \"I just can't wait to get at that rescuing.  I guess all our scouting will have to come back to a S.O.S., for never was there a clearer case of need than this.  That hateful old woman has the child hoodooed, or hypnotized, or flimflammed,\" she declared, giving a wide choice of active transitive verbs for Cleo to choose from.  \"But isn't the girl a darling?\" enthused Cleo.  \"I could just love her like a picture in a book.  And she said she loved us!  Wasn't that quaint!\"  \"Oh, Madaline!  You missed it!\" Grace charged the girl who was too timid to interview Maid Mary.  \"We are going to find her house.  And she's just _wonderful_.\"  This last was pronounced with that effusion peculiar to the modern use of the word \"wonderful.\"  Nothing could possibly be more or at least so superlative.  \"Why didn't you lasso the old woman?\" teased Madaline, referring to the trick Grace played on another occasion told in our first volume.  \"I would have, only you were too far away to pull the rope!\" fired back Grace.  Nevertheless her tone implied she would not stop at rope or swing, if she found such a feat necessary in the rescue of Maid Mary.  \"What a queer name--Reda,\" Cleo reflected, when once again they started over the rough road toward Cragsnook.  \"It ought to be pronounced as it is spelled instead of 'ree'--she looks red enough in that blazing outfit.\"  \"But what a pretty accent the girl used,\" remarked Grace.  \"Do you suppose she's English?\"  \"Maybe from Boston,\" suggested Cleo, \"but the old woman, I should judge, is a native of the whole geography, well beaten with an oceanic egg beater, or if not that conglomeration, I should guess she owned an entire island in the wildest ocean, where there were nothing but ship-wrecked rummage sails and old crow squaks.\"  \"That's bad enough, anyway,\" commented Madaline, who seemed a trifle out of the picture, \"and I think she is all of that and more.\"  \"Just you watch the True-Treds make for the twin chestnuts!\" orated Cleo.  \"Old Lady Reda had better look out for her lace sun bonnet and flowered petticoat.  They may get mixed up in the shuffle.\"  \"How about grandpop?\" asked Grace.  \"What do you propose to do with him?\"  \"Smother him in his 'yarbs' and roots,\" pronounced Cleo dramatically, and when they entered the path to Cragsnook, busy brains were concocting marvelously daring schemes to bring about the rescue of Maid Mary.  \"Do you think your Aunt Audrey will mind?\" questioned Madaline, always sure to find an alibi for anything too risky.  \"No, indeed,\" stoutly declared Cleo.  \"I shouldn't wonder but she would want to adopt Maid Mary for a model, with those Marguerite braids, and her far-away eyes.  Oh, isn't it too exciting?  Do you think we need tell Jennie?\"  \"I--wouldn't,\" replied Grace, fully conscious such a risk was not to be even thought of.  Madaline was a nice little fat dimply girl, and no one could blame her for not wanting to run from horrid old women up on mountain tops, nevertheless she had never failed in her own peculiar way of performing scout duties, and even the braver girls loved her baby ways of accomplishing the tasks.     CHAPTER VII  WITHIN A MOUNTAIN CAVE  Mrs. Dunbar was busy in New York, taking an active part in an art convention, nevertheless she made a flying trip out to Cragsnook that afternoon, to make sure her young guests were happy and well.  Being real girls and therefore pardonably human, in telling their adventure, the scouts did not enlarge on their meeting with Maid Mary; in fact the detail involving the displeasure of Reda, the old nurse, was quite lightly passed over in their account of the day as made to the hostess.  Mrs. Dunbar enjoyed the joke perpetrated by Madaline, in her suspicion of a possible goat farm being tucked away in the mountains, thence Maid Mary and the pompous Reda were wont to lug the roots; at the same time she felt unequal to a better guess at the puzzle, for it was now conspicuously clear that roots, all kinds of roots, were being gathered continuously by the little girl and her picturesque attendant.  The three visitors and Mrs. Dunbar were enjoying a refreshing west wind on the square porch, outside the library window, for their confab, and in their summer uniforms the girls made a picture not wasted on the artistic eye of Audrey Harris Dunbar.  \"I can truthfully report,\" she remarked, smiling graciously and betraying considerable of her own good looks, \"that you three little girls are already much improved by your visit.  I have to make out a blanket statement, as we say in club work, when we make one report cover a number of items, and I would just like to illustrate that statement with a color picture of you girls.  You are positively rosy.\"  The compliment was plainly merited, for Madaline and, Grace had taken on a generous coating of tan and color, and even Cleo's usually pale face was prettily suffused with a shell-pink glow, which brightened her gray eyes, and enhanced the attractive effect of a face all but plain, too keenly intelligent to be overlooked in beauty.  \"We all feel better for getting back in service,\" Cleo replied to her aunt's favorable criticism.  \"I guess even vacation needs a little duty to keep the play part happily outlined.\"  \"Yes, little niece, you show your daddy's wisdom there, and of course that means you are very like me,\" with a swoop of her graceful arm coming up to the breast in mock dramatic fashion.  \"I always knew brother Kimball and I were very much alike, and now I am positive.  Of course Kim aimed to be practical, and he has succeeded, while I--just slosh around in my paints.  But really, children, I must be off again to that convention.  I suppose we will plan to make interior decorations in mural designs around the Capitol dome, to give neighborly effect to our friends in Mars or Saturn or even Venus.  Now be good,\" and she embraced all three with her affectionate smile, \"go hunting if you like, but better take Lucille or Lalia along.  They are older, you know, and should be wiser, although you have quite astonished me with your applied good sense thus far.  I shall send a be-ee-u-tiful report to Flosston.  You know, of course, the factory is moving headquarters to New York, and all your families may tour this way eventually.  By-by!  I hate to go, but I can't let the other ladies do all the gold work on the Capitol.\"  Sheer admiration silenced the girls for some moments after her departure.  Audrey Dunbar seemed like a breath of the refreshing west wind herself, and it was not to be wondered at that her guests should appreciate her generous hospitality and personal attention.  \"Shall we have to take Lucille and Lalia?\"  It was Grace who put the gloomy question.  \"I don't know,\" faltered Cleo.  \"You see, we don't really know what we may fall into on the other side of the mountain.\"  \"Maybe bandits and caves--and--things,\" suggested Madaline, characteristically.  \"There might be caves, natural ones, I mean,\" Cleo remarked, \"but I don't fancy we would run into any real live bandits, Mally Mack and Jack Hagan seem to monopolize that title in Bellaire, and you know what perfectly little gallants they both are.  But we have to live up to our reputation, I suppose, and be wise.  It might be wisest to take the big girls along.  When, do you suppose, will we ever be classed as big girls?\" she almost grumbled.  \"Then suppose I run over and see if they can go,\" Grace proposed, showing her impatience to be on the trail.  \"A shower might come up and then we couldn't go until to-morrow.\"  \"All right,\" agreed Cleo.  \"I'll address the postals while you run over.  I see you have both written letters home on your cards.\"  \"And I am going into the garden with Jennie,\" declared Madaline.  \"You won't really mind, Cleo, if I don't go along?\"  \"No, indeed, Madie dear.  You just suit your sweet self, and have a good time.  That's the very best way for us all to be sure of enjoying ourselves.  But look out for pinching beetles in the vines.  They bite, you know.\"  When Grace returned with Lalia, the three, including Cleo, lost little time to taking up the mountain trail towards the Twin Chestnuts,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25626"],["title","The Girl Scouts at Bellaire; Or, Maid Mary's Awakening (#6)"],["body","by Maid Mary as marking the spot where she and her mysterious grandfather, as well as the picturesque Reda, occupied some sort of cottage--just what kind even Lalia did not pretend to know.  \"We rarely go into Second Mountain,\" she explained as they started off, \"except for dogwood berries in the fall.  We do go then in classes from school, for the hills are perfectly beautiful with the red dogwood and the dark blue 'bread and butter' vines.  The berries make lovely decorations.  And the milk weed pods, too--I have some still from last year.\"  \"It must be glorious in autumn,\" Cleo answered.  \"If mother and father get back from their tour in time we might take a house out here, instead of a New York apartment.\"  \"Let's cut through the golf links, then we will be up near the mountain house and we can stop in the observatory.  Have you taken in the view yet?\" asked Lalia.  \"No, but we would love to,\" answered Cleo.  \"Auntie told us we should take her field glasses for it though.\"  \"It would be better to look through the glasses, of course, but even with the naked eye you get a wonderful view.  What's the matter, Grace? Getting too warm?\"  Grace had taken off her neckerchief, and was carrying her hat, and puffing audibly.  \"Yes, I am warm.  Your mountains are lovely to look at, but a little hard to tread even for us True Treds.  Either that or we are going to have a shower!\" surmised Grace.  \"Both!\" declared Lalia, \"just look at that cloud!  It's swooping down like a big black blanket.  Now we have got to hurry.  We must get to the mountain house or we will be drenched.  There's no other possible shelter.\"  \"Away up there?\" inquired Cleo, pointing to the hotel on top of the hill.  \"I don't believe we can ever get there before your blanket dumps its contents.  See, it threatens to burst now!\"  At that moment a vivid flash of lightning cut from one black hill in the clouds and buried itself behind another.  As if piercing the fathomless blanket and renting holes in its inky cover, a downpour of rain broke through, and even before reaching the earth it could now be seen descending in a heavy mist at the hill top.  \"There we are!\" shouted Lalia, \"and here we are--all dressed up and no place to duck!  We can't reach the Mountain House.  Let's make for that rock!  It may afford some shelter.\"  Without thought of dissent Cleo and Grace followed their leader through the now pouring shower.  The rain seemed almost solid, its sheets were so dense in the downfall, and the terrific peals of thunder, that echoed and rolled over the hills, gave such monstrous volumes of sound as only the big canyons between solid rocks emit.  It seemed the stones themselves would be torn out from their pits in the frightful vibrations.  Already thoroughly drenched, the girls in scout uniform seemed scarcely better off than Lalia in her pretty gingham, the summer weight khaki of the skirts, and the soisette blouses shedding the heavy rain more readily, only because of the uniform straight lines and absence of frilly pockets to catch the \"buckets'\" spill.  As for hats--the girls were utilizing these as shields, holding them at ever-swerving angles, to keep the blinding rain out of their eyes.  The big black rock with torrents of water how gushing down its furrows and rills, was reached at last and to the delight of the wayfarers it did offer shelter.  \"Why, just see here!\" exclaimed Grace, the first to reach port, \"here is a cave.  We said there ought to be caves in these mountains.  And we can all fit in out of the storm.  Isn't this wonderful?\"  \"Port haven in our story, surely,\" quoth Lalia, \"I thought I knew these parts, but I never before discovered these Monte Cristo apartments. Shall we ring for the janitor?\"  \"Pray do not,\" replied Cleo, swishing her reservoir hat around to empty its contents.  \"Let us woo the wooseys undisturbed.  I should like to dump the mud out of my boots!\"  The rain on the uncovered rocks was still splashing, and a strong wind howling through the trees added to the din.  Only at close range could the girls make their voices intelligible.  But it was so good to be within shelter.  Welcome indeed is any port in a storm.  \"There must be more dugouts in this rock,\" Cleo said, attempting to survey the curved bowlder that formed a huge support for the cedars growing from its top, in a great swerving hedge, clear up into Second Mountain.  \"But one is enough for us,\" Grace reminded her.  Then a sound penetrated the now ceasing roar of the torrent.  Voices surely, somewhere!  \"Hark!\"  All three girls uttered the exclamation simultaneously.  \"It's at the other side!\" whispered Cleo, \"and it's a woman's voice.\"  They listened, scarcely breathing.  \"That's Mary!\" suddenly exclaimed Grace, in the same subdued voice.  \"I know it is.\"  They waited a few seconds, listening.  The first voice was now answered by another.  It was plainly that of the old woman Reda, for the queer, rapid flow of language was not English.  \"Reda!\" whispered Cleo.  \"Is that Spanish?\"  \"Who's Reda?\" repeated Lalia.  \"The queer old woman with the little girl Mary,\" replied Cleo.  \"Are you afraid of her?\"  \"No,\" answered Lalia with something of a sneer.  \"I guess we three could manage her if we had to.  Shall we peek?\"  \"Listen!\" commanded Cleo.  Came a small voice through the jagged rocks: \"But I will not, Reda, I am not asleep.  I saw other girls just like me, and I know I have not the sleeping fever.  You always try to make me afraid!\"  This was Mary.  The angered tones of the old woman that followed this mild outburst of defiance could not be understood except through their accents and emphasis, for the dialect was part Spanish and part West Indian, such as might be used by natives of Central America.  \"She's awfully mad!\" warned Grace.  \"We better stay hiding!\"  The other girls apparently held the same view of the situation, for while keeping necks craned and ears attentive to the intermittent voices, all were careful not to allow so much as the edge of a skirt to flutter out from behind the hiding rock.  \"I do not believe grandpa has it at all,\" came the decided tones of Mary's round voice.  \"It is lost forever, and we shall never find it. And next time Janos comes I shall tell him I will not stay here.  I am not a baby, and I feel strong and able--to--to go!\" she finished, throwing a dramatic quiver into these last words, thereby proving the intensity of her emotion.  Almost a shriek from the old woman followed the declaration, and for a few seconds the girls felt as if something dreadful might happen to the child.  Then, like some wild, reckless creature, the girl Mary was seen to dash out from her shelter in the rock, unmindful of the rain still falling, and before the eavesdroppers realized it, she was speeding down the hill, the long braids dangling over her shoulders, and her perpetual white dress soon climbing like a veritable swaddling cloth about her lithe form.  As if delighted with the play of the rain drops, she would toss up her face to defy them as she ran; then flop her arms up and down in a flying motion, not really unlike a wild mountain bird.  While the girls watched spellbound, they saw presently the old woman trudge along after her, still muttering the unintelligible gibberish, easily translatable into wrath and fury, whatever its peculiar language.  \"Can we go now?\" ventured Cleo.  \"It's almost stopped raining,\" replied Lalia, and as they left the cave a sense of disappointment threw its shadow over all three.  They could not go to the Twin Chestnuts that afternoon, but they felt more positive than ever that Maid Mary was in danger, and their enforced delay in her rescue only served to heighten its purpose.  After explaining to Lalia as much as seemed due in point of politeness, the three girls stopped to arrange their disordered attire in the path, before taking the main thoroughfare through the village.  As they adjusted their hats and straightened skirts, they were suddenly conscious of being watched--had that feeling of eyes questioning them.  All three turned suddenly as if answering a voice.  As they did so they faced a man--actually confronted him, almost brushing against him.  \"Oh!\" exclaimed Grace involuntarily.  \"Pardon, miss,\" spoke the man in a distinctly foreign accent, \"but were you not with the child, the Maid Mary?  Have you seen her to-day?  Yes? No?\"  Cleo was the first to realize the possible significance of this seemingly inoffensive query, and her look to the other girls signaled them to be cautious.  \"We have only been in the mountain, and were caught in the shower,\" she replied evasively, \"and it does not seem to be all over yet so we must hurry.  Come on, girls!\" she called, and when the foreigner asked the next question he had the echo of his own voice for an answer.     CHAPTER VIII  SUNSET'S INSPIRATIONS  \"Now, you see, we will have more trouble to reach her.  That man knew we were in the cave, and he also knew Mary and old Reda were behind the next rock.  He must have followed us all the way down the hill!\"  This was Cleo's almost breathless pronouncement, made directly she and Grace reached the porch of the cottage.  Lalia had declined their invitation to rest a few minutes before getting into more comfortable attire, so she was not in the conference.  \"You could see he was related to the old woman,\" replied Grace.  \"His eyes and that kinky hair made him look so much like her.\"  \"They are surely natives of the same country,\" commented Cleo, \"but they may not be related to each other.  Oh, I'm so disappointed; I felt sure we could get to the girl's house this afternoon.  And did you hear her courage voiced in that decided threat?  That she would go away, and that it, whatever it was, is lost forever?  Could they be holding Mary for ransom?\"  \"Kidnapped, do you mean?\" gasped Grace.  \"I don't know what I do mean, but I sort of wish Uncle Guy were home. If we run into too much danger he would surely"]]]
