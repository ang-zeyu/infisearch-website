I'd like to get me 'and round some blighter's ugly neck, too.\"  A second later a trench-mortar bomb came hurtling down through the air, and fell on the parados near the two men. There was a pause, then an awful explosion, which hurled Dymond to the ground, and, as he fell, Newman's words seemed to run through his head: \"I wish as 'ow we was a bit closer to the devils so that they couldn't shell us.\" He was aware of a moment's acute terror, then something in his brain seemed to snap and everything that followed was vague, for Captain Roger Dymond went mad.  He remembered clambering out of the trench to get so close to the Huns that they could not shell him; he remembered running--everybody running, his own men running with him, and the Germans running from him; he had a vague recollection of making his way down a long bit of strange trench, brandishing an entrenching tool that he had picked up somewhere; then there was a great flash and an awful pain, and all was over--the shelling was over at last.         *       *       *       *       *  It was not until Roger Dymond was in hospital in London that he worried about things again. One evening, however, the Sister brought in a paper, and pointed out his own name in a list of nine others who had won the V.C. He read the little paragraph underneath in the deepest astonishment.     \"For conspicuous gallantry,\" it ran, \"under very heavy shell fire on    August 26th, 1916. Seeing that his men were becoming demoralised by    the bombardment, Captain Dymond, on his own initiative, led a    surprise attack against the enemy trenches. He found the Germans    unprepared, and at the head of his men captured two lines of trenches    along a front of two hundred and fifty yards. Captain Dymond lost    both legs owing to shell fire, but his men were able to make good    almost all their ground and to hold it against all counter-attacks.     \"This officer was awarded the Military Cross earlier in the war for    great bravery near La Bass√©e.\"  He finished the amazing article, and wrote a letter, in a wavering hand that he could not recognise as his own, to the War Office to tell them of their mistake--that he was really running away from the enemy's shells--and received a reply visit from a general.  \"My dear fellow,\" he said, \"the V.C. is never awarded to a man who has not deserved it. The only pity is that so many fellows deserve it and don't get it. You deserved it and got it. Stick to it, and think yourself damned lucky to be alive to wear it. There's nothing more to be said.\"  And this is the story of Captain Roger Dymond, V.C., M.C. Of the few of us who were there at the time, there is not one who would grudge him the right to put those most coveted letters of all after his name, for we were all in the shelling ourselves, and we all saw him charge, and heard him shout and laugh as he made his way across to the enemy. The V.C., as the general said, is never given to a man who has not deserved it.     V  \"PONGO\" SIMPSON ON BOMBS   \"Pongo\" Simpson was sitting before a brazier fire boiling some tea for his captain, when the warning click sounded from the German trenches. Instinctively he clapped the cover on the canteen and dived for shelter, while the great, black trench-mortar bomb came twisting and turning down through the air. It fell to ground with a dull thud, there was a second's silence, then an appalling explosion. The roof of the dug-out in which \"Pongo\" had found refuge sagged ominously, the supporting beam cracked, and the heavy layer of earth and bricks and branches subsided on the crouching man.  It took five minutes to dig him out, and he was near to suffocation when they dragged him into the trench. For a moment he looked wonderingly about him, and then a smile came to his face. \"That's what I likes about this 'ere life, there ain't no need to get bored. No need for pictcher shows or pubs, there's amusements for you for nothing.\" And as he got to his feet, a scowl replaced the smile. \"I bet I knows the blighter what sent that there bomb,\" he growled. \"I guess it's old Fritz what used to 'ang out in that old shop in Walworth Road--'im what I palmed off a bad 'arf-crown on. 'E always said as 'ow 'e'd get 'is own back.\"  Five minutes later he had exchanged the battered wreck of his canteen for a new one belonging to Private Adams, who was asleep farther down the trench, and had set to boiling a fresh lot of tea for his captain.  \"Darned funny things, bombs and things like that,\" he began presently. \"You can't trust them no'ow. Look at ole Sergeant Allen f'r example. 'E went 'ome on leave after a year out 'ere, and 'e took an ornary time fuse from a shell with 'im to put on 'is mantelpiece. And the very first night as 'e was 'ome, the blamed thing fell down when 'e wasn't lookin', and bit 'im in the leg, so that 'e 'ad to spend all 'is time in 'orspital. They're always explodin' when they didn't ought to. Did I ever tell you about me brother Bert?\"  A chorus in the negative from the other men who stood round the brazier encouraged him to continue.  \"Well, Bert was always a bit silly like, and I thought as 'ow 'e'd do somethin' foolish when 'e got to the front. Sure 'nough, the very first bloomin' night 'e went into a trench, 'e was filin' along it when 'e slipped and sat right on a box of bombs. It's gorspel what I'm tellin' you--nine of the blighters went off, and 'e wasn't killed. 'E's 'ome in England now in some 'orspital, and 'e's as fit as a lord. The only thing wrong about 'im now is that 'e's always the first bloke what stands and gives 'is place to a lady when a tram's full--still a bit painful like.\"  Joe Bates expectorated with much precision and care over the parapet in the direction of the Germans. \"It ain't bombs wot I mind,\" he said, \"it's them there mines. When I first kime aht ter fight the 'Uns, I was up at St. Eloi, an' they blew the 'ole lot of us up one night. Gawd, it ain't like nothin' on earth, an' the worst of it was I'd jest 'ad a box of fags sent out by some ole gal in 'Blighty,' an' when I got back to earth agen there weren't a bloomin' fag to be found. If thet ain't enough to mike a bloke swear, I dunno wot is. 'As any sport 'ere got a fag to gi' me? I ain't 'ad a smoke fer two days,\" he finished, \"cept a li'l bit of a fag as the Keptin threw away.\"  Private Parkes hesitated for a minute, and then, seeing Joe Bates's eyes fixed expectantly on him, he produced a broken \"Woodbine\" from somewhere inside his cap.  \"Yes,\" resumed \"Pongo,\" while Joe Bates was lighting his cigarette, \"this ain't what you'd call war. I wouldn't mind goin' for ole Fritz with an 'ammer, but, what with 'owitzers and 'crumps,' and 'Black Marias,' and 'pip-squeaks' and 'whizz-bangs,' the infantry bloke ain't got a chanst. 'Ere 'ave I been in a bloomin' trench for six months, and what 'ave I used my bay'nit for? To chop wood, and to wake ole Sandy when 'e snores. Down the line our blokes run over and give it to the Alleymans like 'ell, and up 'ere we sits jest like a lot of dolls while they send over those darned bombs. I'll give 'em what for. I'll put it acrost 'em.\" And he disappeared round the traverse with the canteen of tea for his officer.  Ten minutes later he turned up again with a jam tin bomb in his hand. \"I bet I can reach their bloomin' listening post with this,\" he said, and he deliberately lit a piece of paper at the brazier fire and put it to the odd inch of fuse that protruded from the bomb. The average jam tin bomb is fused to burn for three or four seconds before it explodes, so that, once the fuse is lit, you do not keep the bomb near you for long, but send it across with your best wishes to Fritz over the way. \"Pongo\" drew his arm back to throw his bomb, and had begun the forward swing, when his fingers seemed to slip, and the weapon dropped down into the trench.  There was a terrific rush, and everyone disappeared helter-skelter round the traverse.  Just as Corporal Bateman rounded the corner into safety he glanced back, to see \"Pongo\" sprawling on his bomb in the most approved style, to prevent the bits from spreading. There was a long pause, during which the men crouched close to the parapet waiting, waiting ... but nothing happened.  At length someone poked his head round the traverse--to discover \"Pongo\" sitting on the sandbag recently vacated by Corporal Bateman, trying to balance the bomb on the point of a bayonet.  \"'Ullo!\" said that individual. \"I thought as 'ow you'd gone 'ome for the week-end. 'E wouldn't 'urt me, not this little bloke,\" and he fondled the jam tin.  \"Well,\" said Joe Bates when, one by one, the men had crept back to the fire, \"if that ain't a bloomin' miracle! I ain't never seen nuffin' like it. Ain't you 'arf 'ad an escape, Pongo?\"  \"Pongo\" rose to his feet, and edged towards the traverse. \"It ain't such an escape as what you blokes think, because, you see, the bomb ain't nothin' more nor an ornary jam tin with a bit of fuse what I stuck in it.\"  And he disappeared down the trench as rapidly as had his comrades a few minutes before.     VI  THE SCHOOLMASTER OF PONT SAVERNE  I   \"So, you see, Schoolmaster,\" said Oberleutnant von Scheldmann, \"you French are a race of dogs. We are the real masters here, and, by Heaven, we have come to make you realise it. Your beloved defenders are running for their lives from the nation they ventured to defy a month ago. They are beaten, routed. What is it they say in your Latin books? 'V√¶ Victis.' Woe to the conquered!\"  Gaston Baudel, schoolmaster in the little village of Pont Saverne, looked out of the window along the white road to Ch√¢lons-sur-Marne, four"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25470"],["title","Mud and Khaki: Sketches from Flanders and France (#5)"],["body","away. Between the poplar trees he could catch glimpses of it, and the river wound by its side, a broad ribbon of polished silver. From the road there rose, here and there, clouds of dust, telling of some battery or column on the move. The square of the little village, where he had lived for close on forty years, was crowded with German troops; the river was dirtied by hundreds of Germans, washing off the dust and blood; the inns echoed to German laughter and German songs, and, even as he looked, someone hurled a tray of glasses out of the window of the Lion d'Or into the street. His blood boiled with hate of the invading hosts that had so rudely aroused the sleepy, peaceful village, and he felt his self-control slipping, slipping....  \"Get me some food,\" said the German suddenly. \"We have hardly had one decent meal since your dogs of soldiers began running. Bring food and wine at once, so that I may go on and help to wipe the French and British scum from off the earth.\"  The insult was too much for Gaston Baudel. \"May I be cursed,\" he shouted, \"if I lift hand or foot to feed you and your like. I hate you all, for did you not kill my own father, when your soldiers overran France forty-four years ago! Go and find food elsewhere.\"  Von Scheldmann laughed to himself, amused at the Frenchman's rage. He leant out of the window, and called to his servant and another man, who were seated on the doorstep outside.  \"Tie this fighting cock up with something,\" he ordered, \"and go to see if there is anyone else in the house.\"  An unarmed schoolmaster is no even match for two armed and burly Germans. Gaston Baudel kicked and struggled as he had never done before, but he was old and weak, his eyes were watery through much reading, and his arm had none of the strength of youth left in it. In a few seconds he lay gasping on the floor, while a German, kneeling on him, tied his hands behind his back with strips of his own bedsheets.  \"Now, you pig,\" said von Scheldmann when the soldiers had gone off to search the house, \"remember that you are the conquered dog of a conquered race, and that my sword thirsts for French blood,\" and he added meaning to his words by drawing his weapon and pricking the schoolmaster's thin legs with it. \"If I don't get food in a few minutes, I shall have to run this through your body.\"  Gaston Baudel had heard too much of war to put any trust in what we call \"civilisation,\" which is, at best, merely a cloak that hides the savage beneath. He knew that the command to kill and pillage was more than enough to bring forth all the latent passions which man has tried to conceal since the days when he first clothed himself in skins; that it was no idle threat on the part of the German officer. He lay, then, in silence, on the floor of his own schoolroom, until the two soldiers returned, dragging between them the terrified Rosine, his old housekeeper.  \"Are you the schoolmaster's servant?\" asked von Scheldmann, in French.  Rosine nodded, for no words would come to her.  \"Well, bring me the best food and wine in the house at once, or your master will suffer for it.\"  Rosine glanced at Gaston Baudel, who nodded to her as well as his position would allow him to. With tears in her eyes, the old servant hurried off to her kitchen to prepare the meal.  \"Tie the schoolmaster down to that chair,\" ordered the German officer, \"and place him opposite me, so that he may see how much his guest enjoys his lunch.\"  Thus they sat, the host and the guest, face to face across the little deal table near the window. The sun shone down on the clean cloth and the blood-coloured wine, and on the schoolmaster's grey hair. In the shade cast by the apple tree outside, sat the German, now drinking, now glancing mockingly at his unwilling host. The meal was interrupted by an orderly, who came in with a note.  Von Scheldmann read it, and swore. \"In five minutes we parade,\" he said, \"to follow on after your cowardly dogs of _poilus_. Here's a health to the new rulers of France! Here's to the German Empire!\" and he leant across the table towards the schoolmaster. \"Drink, you dog,\" he said, \"drink to my toast,\" and he held his glass close to the other's lips.  Gaston Baudel hesitated for a moment. Then he suddenly jerked his head forward, and, with his chin, knocked the glass out of the German's hand. As the wine splashed over the floor, von Scheldmann leaped to his feet.  \"Swine!\" he shouted. \"It is lucky for you that your wine was good and has left me in a kind mood, otherwise you would certainly die for that insult. As it is, you shall but lose your ears, and I shall benefit the world by cutting them off. If you move an inch I shall have to run my sword through your heart.\"  He lifted his sword, and brought it down twice. Then he called to his servant and hastened out into the sunlit street, leaving Gaston Baudel tied to his chair, with the warm blood running down each side of his face.   II  Six days later, shortly before the middle of September, an unwonted noise in the street brought the old schoolmaster from his breakfast. He walked down the little flagged path of the garden to the gate, and looked up and down the road. By the green, in the square, a group of villagers were talking and gesticulating, and from the direction of Ecury came the deep rumble of traffic and the sound of heavy firing.  The schoolmaster called to one of the peasants. \"H√©, Jeanne,\" he cried. \"What is the news?\"  \"The Boches are coming back, M. Baudel,\" said Jeanne Legrand. \"They are fleeing from our troops, and will be passing through here, many of them. Pray God they may be in too much of a hurry to stop!\" And her face grew anxious and frightened.  Old Gaston Baudel stepped out of his garden, and joined the group in the square. \"Courage, mes amies,\" he said. \"Even if they do stay awhile, even if our homes are shelled, what does it matter? France is winning, and driving the Germans back. That at any rate, is good news.\"  \"All the same,\" said fat Madame Roland, landlady of the Lion d'Or, \"if they break any more of my glasses, I shall want to break my last bottle of wine over their dirty heads.\" And she went off to hide what remained of her liqueurs and champagne under the sacking in the cellar.  \"Let us all go back to our homes,\" counselled Gaston Baudel, \"to hide anything of value. Even I, with this bandage round my head, can hear how swiftly they are retiring. There will, alas! be no school to-day. May our brave soldiers drive the devils from off our fair land of France.\"  Even as he spoke, the first transport waggons came tearing down the road, and swung northward over the river. Away in the morning haze, the infantry could be seen--dark masses stumbling along the white road--till a convoy of motor lorries hid them from view.  Gaston Baudel sat down in his stone-paved schoolroom to await the passing of the Germans, and to correct the tasks of his little pupils. He had given them a _devoir de style_ to write on the glory of France, and, as he read the childish, ill-spelt prophecies of his country's greatness, he laughed, for the Germans were in retreat, the worst of the anxiety was over, and Paris was saved. And, hour by hour, he listened to the rumble of cannon, the rattle of transport waggons and ambulances, and the heavy tramp of tired-out soldiers on the dusty road.  Suddenly he heard the clank of boots coming up his little garden path, and a large figure loomed in the doorway. A German officer, covered with dirt, entered the room, and threw himself down in a chair.  \"You still here, earless dog?\" he said, and the schoolmaster recognised his tormentor of a week ago. \"Give me something to take with me, and at once. I have no time to stop, but I shall certainly kill you this time if you don't bring me food, and more of that red wine.\"  Gaston Baudel glanced towards the drawer where he kept his revolver--though he would have never used it against any number of burglars--but a sudden idea came to him, and he checked his movement. With a few muttered words, he hastened off to the kitchen to get food for the German.  \"Rosine,\" he said, \"cut a sandwich for that German dog, and then run into my room and fetch the black sealing wax from my desk.\"  When she had gone off to obey him, Gaston Baudel opened a bottle of red wine and poured a little away. Then, fetching a small glass-stoppered bottle from his room, he emptied the contents--pure morphia--into the wine and recorked the bottle.  \"So much,\" he said to himself, \"for the doctor and his drugs. He may have told me how much to dilute it to deaden the pain of my ears, but he gave me no instructions about dosing Germans. They have strong stomachs; let them have strong drink.\"  But as he sealed the cork and mouth of the bottle, to allay any suspicions the German might have, a thought came to him. Was he not committing murder? Was he not taking away God's gift of life from a fellow creature? Unconsciously he touched the bandage that covered his mutilated ears. Surely, though, it could not be wrong to kill one of these hated oppressors? Should not an enemy of France be destroyed at any cost?  As he hesitated, the impatient voice of von Scheldmann sounded from the schoolroom. \"You swine!\" he shouted, \"are you bringing me food, or must I come and fetch it?\"  The schoolmaster seized a scrap of paper, and scribbled a few words on it. Then, slipping it between the cheese and bread of the sandwich, he made a little packet of the food, and hastened from the room. God, or Fate, must decide.  He handed the food and wine to the German, and watched him as he tramped down the garden path, to join in the unending stream of grey-coated soldiers who straggled towards the north.   III  Oberleutnant von Scheldmann sat on a bank by the roadside, to lunch in haste. Behind him, parallel to him, in front of him, went the German army; and the thunder of the guns, down by the Marne, told of the rearguard fight. As they tramped past, the"]]]
