Maybe we can put up housing in such regions, but who can live there? Even with decentralization going full blast, people must live within reasonable access to their work. No, we're just running out of room.\"  Again the car halted on signal. Over the blasting of the horns, Harry repeated his query about emigration.  Frazer shook his head, but made no attempt to reply until the horns had quieted and they were under way once more.  \"As for emigration, we're just getting some of our own medicine in return. About eighty years ago, we clamped down and closed the door on immigrants; established a quota. Now the same quota is being used against us, and you can't really blame other nations for it. They're facing worse population increases than we are. Look at the African Federation, and what's happened there, in spite of all the wealth! And South America is even worse, in spite of all the reclamation projects. Fifteen years ago, when they cleared out the Amazon Basin, they thought they'd have enough room for fifty years to come. And now look at it--two hundred million, that's the latest figure we've got.\"  \"So what's the answer?\" Harry asked.  \"I don't know. If it wasn't for hydroponics and the Ag Culture controls, we'd be licked right now. As it is, we can still supply enough food, and the old supply-and-demand takes care of the economy as a whole. I have no recommendations for an overall solution, or even a regional one. My job, the Board's job, is regulating housing and traffic and transportation in Chicagee. That's about all you can expect us to handle.\"  Again they jolted to a stop and the horns howled all around them. Harry sat there until a muscle in the side of his jaw began to twitch. Suddenly he pounded on the horn with both fists.  \"Shut up!\" he yelled. \"For the love of Heaven, shut up!\"  Abruptly he slumped back. \"Sorry,\" he mumbled. \"It's my damned headache. I--I've got to get out of this.\"  \"Job getting you down?\"  \"No. It's a good job. At least everybody tells me so. Twenty-five hours a week, three hundred bucks. The car. The room. The telescreen and liquor and yellowjackets. Plenty of time to kill. Unless it's the time that's killing me.\"  \"But--what do you _want_?\"  Harry stepped on the accelerator and they inched along. Now the street widened into eight traffic lanes and the big semis joined the procession on the edge of the downtown area.  \"I want out,\" Harry said. \"Out of this.\"  \"Don't you ever visit the National Preserves?\" Frazer asked.  \"Sure I do. Fly up every vacation. Take a tame plane to a tame government resort and catch my quota of two tame fish. Great sport! If I got married, I'd be entitled to four tame fish. But that's not what I want. I want what my father used to talk about. I want to drive into the country, without a permit, mind you; just to drive wherever I like. I want to see cows and chickens and trees and lakes and sky.\"  \"You sound like a Naturalist.\"  \"Don't sneer. Maybe the Naturalists are right. Maybe we ought to cut out all this phoney progress and phoney peace that passeth all understanding. I'm no liberal, don't get me wrong, but sometimes I think the Naturalists have the only answer.\"  \"But what can you do about it?\" Frazer murmured. \"Suppose for the sake of argument that they _are_ right. How can you change things? We can't just _will_ ourselves to stop growing, and we can't legislate against biology. More people, in better health, with more free time, are just bound to have more offspring. It's inevitable, under the circumstances. And neither you nor I nor anyone has the right to condemn millions upon millions of others to death through war or disease.\"  \"I know,\" Harry said. \"It's hopeless, I guess. All the same, I want out.\" He wet his lips. \"Frazer, you're on the Board here. You've got connections higher up. If I could only get a chance to transfer to Ag Culture, go on one of those farms as a worker--\"  Frazer shook his head. \"Sorry, Harry. You know the situation there, I'm sure. Right now there's roughly ninety million approved applications on file. Everybody wants to get into Ag Culture.\"  \"But couldn't I just buy some land, get a government contract for foodstuffs?\"  \"Have you got the bucks? A minimum forty acres leased from one of the farm corporations will cost you two hundred thousand at the very least, not counting equipment.\" He paused. \"Besides, there's Vocational Apt. What did your tests show?\"  \"You're right,\" Harry said. \"I'm supposed to be an agency man. An agency man until I die. Or retire on my pension, at fifty, and sit in my little room for the next fifty years, turning on the telescreen every morning to hear some loudmouthed liar tell me it's a beautiful day in Chicagee. Who knows, maybe by that time we'll have a hundred billion people enjoying peace and progress and prosperity. All sitting in little rooms and--\"  \"Watch out!\" Frazer grabbed the wheel. \"You nearly hit that truck.\" He waited until Harry's face relaxed before relinquishing his grip. \"Harry, you'd better go in for a checkup. It isn't just a headache with you, is it?\"  \"You're not fooling,\" Harry told him. \"It isn't just a headache.\"  He began to think about what it _really_ was, and that helped a little. It helped him get through the worst part, which was the downtown traffic and letting Frazer off and listening to Frazer urge him to see a doctor.  Then he got to the building parking area and let them take his car away and bury it down in the droning darkness where the horns hooted and the headlights glared.  Harry climbed the ramp and mingled with the ten-thirty shift on its way up to the elevators. Eighteen elevators in his building, to serve eighty floors. Nine of the elevators were express to the fiftieth floor, three were express to sixty-five. He wanted one of the latter, and so did the mob. The crushing, clinging mob. They pressed and panted the way mobs always do; mobs that lynch and torture and dance around bonfires and guillotines and try to drag you down to trample you to death because they can't stand you if your name is Harry and you want to be different.  They hate you because you don't like powdered eggs and the telescreen and a beautiful day in Chicagee. And they stare at you because your forehead hurts and the muscle in your jaw twitches and they know you want to scream as you go up, up, up, and try to think why you get a headache from jerking your head to the left.  Then Harry was at the office door and they said good morning when he came in, all eighty of the typists in the outer office working their electronic machines and offering him their electronic smiles, including the girl he had made electronic love to last Saturday night and who wanted him to move into a two-room marriage and have children, lots of children who could enjoy peace and progress and prosperity.         *       *       *       *       *  Harry snapped out of it, going down the corridor. Only a few steps more and he'd be safe in his office, his own private office, almost as big as his apartment. And there would be liquor, and the yellowjackets in the drawer. That would help. Then he could get to work.  What was today's assignment? He tried to remember. It was Wilmer-Klibby, wasn't it? Telescreenads for Wilmer-Klibby, makers of window-glass.  _Window-glass._  He opened his office door and then slammed it shut behind him. For a minute everything blurred, and then he could remember.  Now he knew what caused him to jerk his head, what gave him the headaches when he did so. Of course. That was it.  When he sat down at the table for breakfast in the morning he turned his head to the left because he'd always done so, ever since he was a little boy. A little boy, in what was then Wheaton, sitting at the breakfast table and looking out of the window. Looking out at summer sunshine, spring rain, autumn haze, the white wonder of newfallen snow.  He'd never broken himself of the habit. He still looked to the left every morning, just as he had today. But there was no window any more. There was only a blank wall. And beyond it, the smog and the clamor and the crowds.  _Window-glass._ Wilmer-Klibby had problems. Nobody was buying window-glass any more. Nobody except the people who put up buildings like this. There were still windows on the top floors, just like the window here in his office.  Harry stepped over to it, moving very slowly because of his head. It hurt to keep his eyes open, but he wanted to stare out of the window. Up this high you could see above the smog. You could see the sun like a radiant jewel packed in the cotton cumulus of clouds. If you opened the window you could feel fresh air against your forehead, you could breathe it in and breathe out the headache.  But you didn't dare look down. Oh, no, never look _down_, because then you'd see the buildings all around you. The buildings below, black and sooty, their jagged outlines like the stumps of rotten teeth. And they stretched off in all directions, as far as the eye could attain; row after row of rotten teeth grinning up from the smog-choked throat of the streets. From the maw of the city far below came this faint but endless howling, this screaming of traffic and toil. And you couldn't help it, you breathed _that_ in too, along with the fresh air, and it poisoned you and it did more than make your head ache. It made your heart ache and it made your soul sick, and it made you close your eyes and your lungs and your brain against it.  Harry reeled, but he knew this was the only way. _Close your brain against it._ And then, when you opened your eyes again, maybe you could see the way things used to be--  It was snowing out and it was a _wet_ snow, the very best kind for snowballs and making a snowman, and the whole gang would come out after school.  But there was no school, this was Saturday, and the leaves were russet and gold and red so that it looked as if all the trees in the world were on "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25776"],["title","This Crowded Earth (#3)"],["body","fire. And you could scuff when you walked and pile up fallen leaves from the grass and roll in them.  And it was swell to roll down the front lawn in summer, just roll right down to the edge of the sidewalk like it was a big hill and let Daddy catch you at the bottom, laughing.  Mamma laughed too, and she said, _Look, it's springtime, the lilacs are out, do you want to touch the pretty lilacs, Harry?_  And Harry didn't quite understand what she was saying, but he reached out and they were purple and smelled of rain and soft sweetness and they were just beyond the window, if he reached a little further he could touch them--  And then the snow and the leaves and the grass and the lilacs disappeared, and Harry could see the rotten teeth again, leering and looming and snapping at him. They were going to bite, they were going to chew, they were going to devour, and he couldn't stop them, couldn't stop himself. He was falling into the howling jaws of the city.  His last conscious effort was a desperate attempt to gulp fresh air into his lungs before he pinwheeled down. Fresh air was good for headaches....     2. Harry Collins--1998   It took them ten seconds to save Harry from falling, but it took him over ten weeks to regain his balance.  In fact, well over two months had passed before he could fully realize just what had happened, or where he was now. They must have noticed something was wrong with him that morning at the office, because two supervisors and an exec rushed in and caught him just as he was going out of the window. And then they had sent him away, sent him _here_.  \"This is fine,\" he told Dr. Manschoff. \"If I'd known how well they treated you, I'd have gone couch-happy years ago.\"  Dr. Manschoff's plump face was impassive, but the little laugh-lines deepened around the edges of his eyes. \"Maybe that's why we take such care not to publicize our recent advances in mental therapy,\" he said. \"Everybody would want to get into a treatment center, and then where would we be?\"  Harry nodded, staring past the doctor's shoulder, staring out of the wide window at the broad expanse of rolling countryside beyond.  \"I still don't understand, though,\" he murmured. \"How can you possibly manage to maintain an institution like this, with all the space and the luxuries? The inmates seem to lead a better life than the adjusted individuals outside. It's topsy-turvy.\"  \"Perhaps.\" Dr. Manschoff's fingers formed a pudgy steeple. \"But then, so many things seem to be topsy-turvy nowadays, don't they? Wasn't it the realization of this fact which precipitated your own recent difficulties?\"  \"Almost precipitated me bodily out of that window,\" Harry admitted, cheerfully. \"And that's another thing. I was sent here, I suppose, because I'd attempted suicide, gone into shock, temporary amnesia, something like that.\"  \"Something like that,\" the doctor echoed, contemplating his steeple.  \"But you didn't give me any treatment,\" Harry continued. \"Oh, I was kept under sedation for a while, I realize that. And you and some of the other staff-members talked to me. But mainly I just rested in a nice big room and ate nice big meals.\"  \"So?\" The steeple's fleshy spire collapsed.  \"So what I want to know is, when does the real treatment start? When do I go into analysis, or chemotherapy, and all that?\"  Dr. Manschoff shrugged. \"Do you think you need those things now?\"  Harry gazed out at the sunlight beyond the window, half-squinting and half-frowning. \"No, come to think of it, I don't believe I do. I feel better now than I have in years.\"  His companion leaned back. \"Meaning that for years you felt all wrong. Because you were constricted, physically, psychically, and emotionally. You were cramped, squeezed in a vise until the pressure became intolerable. But now that pressure has been removed. As a result you no longer suffer, and there is no need to seek escape in death or denial of identity.  \"This radical change of attitude has been brought about here in just a little more than two months' time. And yet you're asking me when the 'real treatment' begins.\"  \"I guess I've already had the real treatment then, haven't I?\"  \"That is correct. Prolonged analysis or drastic therapy is unnecessary. We've merely given you what you seemed to need.\"  \"I'm very grateful,\" Harry said. \"But how can you afford to do it?\"  Dr. Manschoff built another temple to an unknown god. He inspected the architecture critically now as he spoke. \"Because your problem is a rarity,\" he said.  \"Rarity? I'd have thought millions of people would be breaking down every month. The Naturalists say--\"  The doctor nodded wearily. \"I know what they say. But let's dismiss rumors and consider facts. Have you ever read any _official_ report stating that the number of cases of mental illness ran into the millions?\"  \"No, I haven't.\"  \"For that matter, do you happen to know of _anyone_ who was ever sent to a treatment center such as this?\"  \"Well, of course, everybody goes in to see the medics for regular check-ups and this includes an interview with a psych. But if they're in bad shape he just puts them on extra tranquilizers. I guess sometimes he reviews their Vocational Apt tests and shifts them over into different jobs in other areas.\"  Dr. Manschoff bowed his head in reverence above the steeple, as if satisfied with the labors he had wrought. \"That is roughly correct. And I believe, if you search your memory, you won't recall even a mention of a treatment center. This sort of place is virtually extinct, nowadays. There are still some institutions for those suffering from functional mental disorders--paresis, senile dementia, congenital abnormalities. But regular check-ups and preventative therapy take care of the great majority. We've ceased concentrating on the result of mental illnesses and learned to attack the causes.  \"It's the old yellow fever problem all over again, you see. Once upon a time, physicians dealt exclusively with treatment of yellow fever patients. Then they shifted their attention to the _source_ of the disease. They went after the mosquitoes, drained the swamps, and the yellow fever problem vanished.  \"That's been our approach in recent years. We've developed _social_ therapy, and so the need for individual therapy has diminished.  \"What were the sources of the tensions producing mental disturbances? Physical and financial insecurity, the threat of war, the aggressive patterns of a competitive society, the unresolved Oedipus-situation rooted in the old-style family relationship. These were the swamps where the mosquitoes buzzed and bit. Most of the swamps have been dredged, most of the insects exterminated.  \"Today we're moving into a social situation where nobody goes hungry, nobody is jobless or unprovided for, nobody needs to struggle for status. Vocational Apt determines a man's rightful place and function in society, and there's no longer the artificial distinction imposed by race, color or creed. War is a thing of the past. Best of all, the old-fashioned 'home-life,' with all of its unhealthy emotional ties, is being replaced by sensible conditioning when a child reaches school age. The umbilical cord is no longer a permanent leash, a strangler's noose, or a silver-plated life-line stretching back to the womb.\"  Harry Collins nodded. \"I suppose only the exceptional cases ever need to go to a treatment center like this.\"  \"Exactly.\"  \"But what makes _me_ one of the exceptions? Is it because of the way the folks brought me up, in a small town, with all the old-fashioned books and everything? Is that why I hated confinement and conformity so much? Is it because of all the years I spent reading? And why--\"  Dr. Manschoff stood up. \"You tempt me,\" he said. \"You tempt me strongly. As you can see, I dearly love a lecture--and a captive audience. But right now, the audience must not remain captive. I prescribe an immediate dose of freedom.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"You mean I'm to leave here?\"  \"Is that what you want to do?\"  \"Frankly, no. Not if it means going back to my job.\"  \"That hasn't been decided upon. We can discuss the problem later, and perhaps we can go into the answers to those questions you just posed. But at the moment, I'd suggest you stay with us, though without the restraint of remaining in your room or in the wards. In other words, I want you to start going outside again.\"  \"Outside?\"  \"You'll find several square miles of open country just beyond the doors here. You're at liberty to wander around and enjoy yourself. Plenty of fresh air and sunshine--come and go as you wish. I've already issued instructions which permit you to keep your own hours. Meals will be available when you desire them.\"  \"You're very kind.\"  \"Nonsense. I'm prescribing what you need. And when the time comes, we'll arrange to talk again. You know where to find me.\"  Dr. Manschoff dismantled his steeple and placed a half of the roof in each trouser-pocket.  And Harry Collins went outdoors.  It was wonderful just to be free and alone--like returning to that faraway childhood in Wheaton once again. Harry appreciated every minute of it during the first week of his wandering.  But Harry wasn't a child any more, and after a week he began to wonder instead of wander.  The grounds around the treatment center were more than spacious; they seemed absolutely endless. No matter how far he walked during the course of a day, Harry had never encountered any walls, fences or artificial barriers; there was nothing to stay his progress but the natural barriers of high, steeply-slanting precipices which seemed to rim all sides of a vast valley. Apparently the center itself was set in the middle of a large canyon--a canyon big enough to contain an airstrip for helicopter landings. The single paved road leading from the main buildings terminated at the airstrip, and Harry saw helicopters arrive and depart from time to time; apparently they brought in food and supplies.  As "]]]
