You and the world who have surnamed me \"Sage\"      Know that I owe that title, if my due,      To my long meditation on the book      Which ever lying open overhead--      The book of heaven, I mean--so few have read;      Whose golden letters on whose sapphire leaf,      Distinguishing the page of day and night,      And all the revolution of the year;      So with the turning volume where they lie      Still changing their prophetic syllables,      They register the destinies of men:      Until with eyes that, dim with years indeed,      Are quicker to pursue the stars than rule them,      I get the start of Time, and from his hand      The wand of tardy revelation draw.      Oh, had the self-same heaven upon his page      Inscribed my death ere I should read my life      And, by fore-casting of my own mischance,      Play not the victim but the suicide      In my own tragedy!--But you shall hear.      You know how once, as kings must for their people,      And only once, as wise men for themselves,      I woo'd and wedded: know too that my Queen      In childing died; but not, as you believe,      With her, the son she died in giving life to.      For, as the hour of birth was on the stroke,      Her brain conceiving with her womb, she dream'd      A serpent tore her entrail. And too surely      (For evil omen seldom speaks in vain)      The man-child breaking from that living tomb      That makes our birth the antitype of death,      Man-grateful, for the life she gave him paid      By killing her: and with such circumstance      As suited such unnatural tragedy;      He coming into light, if light it were      That darken'd at his very horoscope,      When heaven's two champions--sun and moon I mean--      Suffused in blood upon each other fell      In such a raging duel of eclipse      As hath not terrified the universe      Since that which wept in blood the death of Christ:      When the dead walk'd, the waters turn'd to blood,      Earth and her cities totter'd, and the world      Seem'd shaken to its last paralysis.      In such a paroxysm of dissolution      That son of mine was born; by that first act      Heading the monstrous catalogue of crime,      I found fore-written in his horoscope;      As great a monster in man's history      As was in nature his nativity;      So savage, bloody, terrible, and impious,      Who, should he live, would tear his country's entrails,      As by his birth his mother's; with which crime      Beginning, he should clench the dreadful tale      By trampling on his father's silver head.      All which fore-reading, and his act of birth      Fate's warrant that I read his life aright;      To save his country from his mother's fate,      I gave abroad that he had died with her      His being slew; with midnight secrecy      I had him carried to a lonely tower      Hewn from the mountain-barriers of the realm,      And under strict anathema of death      Guarded from men's inquisitive approach,      Save from the trusty few one needs must trust;      Who while his fasten'd body they provide      With salutary garb and nourishment,      Instruct his soul in what no soul may miss      Of holy faith, and in such other lore      As may solace his life-imprisonment,      And tame perhaps the Savage prophesied      Toward such a trial as I aim at now,      And now demand your special hearing to.      What in this fearful business I have done,      Judge whether lightly or maliciously,--      I, with my own and only flesh and blood,      And proper lineal inheritor!      I swear, had his foretold atrocities      Touch'd me alone. I had not saved myself      At such a cost to him; but as a king,--      A Christian king,--I say, advisedly,      Who would devote his people to a tyrant      Worse than Caligula fore-chronicled?      But even this not without grave mis-giving,      Lest by some chance mis-reading of the stars,      Or mis-direction of what rightly read,      I wrong my son of his prerogative,      And Poland of her rightful sovereign.      For, sure and certain prophets as the stars,      Although they err not, he who reads them may;      Or rightly reading--seeing there is One      Who governs them, as, under Him, they us,      We are not sure if the rough diagram      They draw in heaven and we interpret here,      Be sure of operation, if the Will      Supreme, that sometimes for some special end      The course of providential nature breaks      By miracle, may not of these same stars      Cancel his own first draft, or overrule      What else fore-written all else overrules.      As, for example, should the Will Almighty      Permit the Free-will of particular man      To break the meshes of else strangling fate--      Which Free-will, fearful of foretold abuse,      I have myself from my own son fore-closed      From ever possible self-extrication;      A terrible responsibility,      Not to the conscience to be reconciled      Unless opposing almost certain evil      Against so slight contingency of good.      Well--thus perplex'd, I have resolved at last      To bring the thing to trial: whereunto      Here have I summon'd you, my Peers, and you      Whom I more dearly look to, failing him,      As witnesses to that which I propose;      And thus propose the doing it. Clotaldo,      Who guards my son with old fidelity,      Shall bring him hither from his tower by night      Lockt in a sleep so fast as by my art      I rivet to within a link of death,      But yet from death so far, that next day's dawn      Shall wake him up upon the royal bed,      Complete in consciousness and faculty,      When with all princely pomp and retinue      My loyal Peers with due obeisance      Shall hail him Segismund, the Prince of Poland.      Then if with any show of human kindness      He fling discredit, not upon the stars,      But upon me, their misinterpreter,      With all apology mistaken age      Can make to youth it never meant to harm,      To my son's forehead will I shift the crown      I long have wish'd upon a younger brow;      And in religious humiliation,      For what of worn-out age remains to me,      Entreat my pardon both of Heaven and him      For tempting destinies beyond my reach.      But if, as I misdoubt, at his first step      The hoof of the predicted savage shows;      Before predicted mischief can be done,      The self-same sleep that loosed him from the chain      Shall re-consign him, not to loose again.      Then shall I, having lost that heir direct,      Look solely to my sisters' children twain      Each of a claim so equal as divides      The voice of Poland to their several sides,      But, as I trust, to be entwined ere long      Into one single wreath so fair and strong      As shall at once all difference atone,      And cease the realm's division with their own.      Cousins and Princes, Peers and Councillors,      Such is the purport of this invitation,      And such is my design. Whose furtherance      If not as Sovereign, if not as Seer,      Yet one whom these white locks, if nothing else,      to patient acquiescence consecrate,      I now demand and even supplicate.       AST.      Such news, and from such lips, may well suspend      The tongue to loyal answer most attuned;      But if to me as spokesman of my faction      Your Highness looks for answer; I reply      For one and all--Let Segismund, whom now      We first hear tell of as your living heir,      Appear, and but in your sufficient eye      Approve himself worthy to be your son,      Then we will hail him Poland's rightful heir.      What says my cousin?       EST.      Ay, with all my heart.      But if my youth and sex upbraid me not      That I should dare ask of so wise a king--       KING.      Ask, ask, fair cousin! Nothing, I am sure,      Not well consider'd; nay, if 'twere, yet nothing      But pardonable from such lips as those.       EST.      Then, with your pardon, Sir--if Segismund,      My cousin, whom I shall rejoice to hail      As Prince of Poland too, as you propose,      Be to a trial coming upon which      More, as I think, than life itself depends,      Why, Sir, with sleep-disorder'd senses brought      To this uncertain contest with his stars?       KING.      Well ask'd indeed! As wisely be it answer'd!      _Because_ it is uncertain, see you not?      For as I think I can discern between      The sudden flaws of a sleep-startled man,      And of the savage thing we have to dread;      If but bewilder'd, dazzled, and uncouth,      As might the sanest and the civilest      In circumstance so strange--nay, more than that,      If moved to any out-break short of blood,      All shall be well with him; and how much more,      If 'mid the magic turmoil of the change,      He shall so calm a resolution show      As scarce to reel beneath so great a blow!      But if with savage passion uncontroll'd      He lay about him like the brute foretold,      And must as suddenly be caged again;      Then what redoubled anguish and despair,      From that brief flash of blissful liberty      Remitted--and for ever--to his chain!      Which so much less, if on the stage of glory      Enter'd and exited through such a door      Of sleep as makes a dream of all between.       EST.      Oh kindly answer, Sir, to question that      To charitable courtesy less wise      Might call for pardon rather! I shall now      Gladly, what, uninstructed, loyally      I should have waited.       AST.      Your Highness doubts not me,      Nor how my heart follows my cousin's lips,      Whatever way the doubtful balance fall,      Still loyal to your bidding.       OMNES.      So say all.       KING.      I hoped, and did expect, of all no less--      And sure no sovereign ever needed more      From all who owe him love or loyalty.      For what a strait of time I stand upon,      When to this issue not alone I bring    "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2587"],["title","Life Is a Dream (#4)"],["body","  My son your Prince, but e'en myself your King:      And, whichsoever way for him it turn,      Of less than little honour to myself.      For if this coming trial justify      My thus withholding from my son his right,      Is not the judge himself justified in      The father's shame? And if the judge proved wrong,      My son withholding from his right thus long,      Shame and remorse to judge and father both:      Unless remorse and shame together drown'd      In having what I flung for worthless found.      But come--already weary with your travel,      And ill refresh'd by this strange history,      Until the hours that draw the sun from heaven      Unite us at the customary board,      Each to his several chamber: you to rest;      I to contrive with old Clotaldo best      The method of a stranger thing than old      Time has a yet among his records told.       Exeunt.     ACT II     SCENE I--A Throne-room in the Palace. Music within.        (Enter King and Clotaldo, meeting a Lord in waiting)       KING.      You, for a moment beckon'd from your office,      Tell me thus far how goes it. In due time      The potion left him?       LORD.      At the very hour      To which your Highness temper'd it. Yet not      So wholly but some lingering mist still hung      About his dawning senses--which to clear,      We fill'd and handed him a morning drink      With sleep's specific antidote suffused;      And while with princely raiment we invested      What nature surely modell'd for a Prince--      All but the sword--as you directed--       KING.      Ay--       LORD.      If not too loudly, yet emphatically      Still with the title of a Prince address'd him.       KING.      How bore he that?       LORD.      With all the rest, my liege,      I will not say so like one in a dream      As one himself misdoubting that he dream'd.       KING.      So far so well, Clotaldo, either way,      And best of all if tow'rd the worse I dread.      But yet no violence?       LORD.      At most, impatience;      Wearied perhaps with importunities      We yet were bound to offer.       KING.      Oh, Clotaldo!      Though thus far well, yet would myself had drunk      The potion he revives from! such suspense      Crowds all the pulses of life's residue      Into the present moment; and, I think,      Whichever way the trembling scale may turn,      Will leave the crown of Poland for some one      To wait no longer than the setting sun!       CLO.      Courage, my liege! The curtain is undrawn,      And each must play his part out manfully,      Leaving the rest to heaven.       KING.      Whose written words      If I should misinterpret or transgress!      But as you say--      (To the Lord, who exit.)      You, back to him at once;      Clotaldo, you, when he is somewhat used      To the new world of which they call him Prince,      Where place and face, and all, is strange to him,      With your known features and familiar garb      Shall then, as chorus to the scene, accost him,      And by such earnest of that old and too      Familiar world, assure him of the new.      Last in the strange procession, I myself      Will by one full and last development      Complete the plot for that catastrophe      That he must put to all; God grant it be      The crown of Poland on his brows!--Hark! hark!--      Was that his voice within!--Now louder--Oh,      Clotaldo, what! so soon begun to roar!--      Again! above the music--But betide      What may, until the moment, we must hide.       (Exeunt King and Clotaldo.)       SEGISMUND (within).      Forbear! I stifle with your perfume! Cease      Your crazy salutations! peace, I say      Begone, or let me go, ere I go mad      With all this babble, mummery, and glare,      For I am growing dangerous--Air! room! air!--      (He rushes in. Music ceases.)      Oh but to save the reeling brain from wreck      With its bewilder'd senses!      (He covers his eyes for a while.)      What! E'en now      That Babel left behind me, but my eyes      Pursued by the same glamour, that--unless      Alike bewitch'd too--the confederate sense      Vouches for palpable: bright-shining floors      That ring hard answer back to the stamp'd heel,      And shoot up airy columns marble-cold,      That, as they climb, break into golden leaf      And capital, till they embrace aloft      In clustering flower and fruitage over walls      Hung with such purple curtain as the West      Fringes with such a gold; or over-laid      With sanguine-glowing semblances of men,      Each in his all but living action busied,      Or from the wall they look from, with fix'd eyes      Pursuing me; and one most strange of all      That, as I pass'd the crystal on the wall,      Look'd from it--left it--and as I return,      Returns, and looks me face to face again--      Unless some false reflection of my brain,      The outward semblance of myself--Myself?      How know that tawdry shadow for myself,      But that it moves as I move; lifts his hand      With mine; each motion echoing so close      The immediate suggestion of the will      In which myself I recognize--Myself!--      What, this fantastic Segismund the same      Who last night, as for all his nights before,      Lay down to sleep in wolf-skin on the ground      In a black turret which the wolf howl'd round,      And woke again upon a golden bed,      Round which as clouds about a rising sun,      In scarce less glittering caparison,      Gather'd gay shapes that, underneath a breeze      Of music, handed him upon their knees      The wine of heaven in a cup of gold,      And still in soft melodious under-song      Hailing me Prince of Poland!--'Segismund,'      They said, 'Our Prince! The Prince of Poland!' and      Again, 'Oh, welcome, welcome, to his own,      'Our own Prince Segismund--'      Oh, but a blast--      One blast of the rough mountain air! one look      At the grim features--      (He goes to the window.)      What they disvizor'd also! shatter'd chaos      Cast into stately shape and masonry,      Between whose channel'd and perspective sides      Compact with rooted towers, and flourishing      To heaven with gilded pinnacle and spire,      Flows the live current ever to and fro      With open aspect and free step!--Clotaldo!      Clotaldo!--calling as one scarce dares call      For him who suddenly might break the spell      One fears to walk without him--Why, that I,      With unencumber'd step as any there,      Go stumbling through my glory--feeling for      That iron leading-string--ay, for myself--      For that fast-anchor'd self of yesterday,      Of yesterday, and all my life before,      Ere drifted clean from self-identity      Upon the fluctuation of to-day's      Mad whirling circumstance!--And, fool, why not?      If reason, sense, and self-identity      Obliterated from a worn-out brain,      Art thou not maddest striving to be sane,      And catching at that Self of yesterday      That, like a leper's rags, best flung away!      Or if not mad, then dreaming--dreaming?--well--      Dreaming then--Or, if self to self be true,      Not mock'd by that, but as poor souls have been      By those who wrong'd them, to give wrong new relish?      Or have those stars indeed they told me of      As masters of my wretched life of old,      Into some happier constellation roll'd,      And brought my better fortune out on earth      Clear as themselves in heaven!--Prince Segismund      They call'd me--and at will I shook them off--      Will they return again at my command      Again to call me so?--Within there! You!      Segismund calls--Prince Segismund--       (He has seated himself on the throne.      Enter Chamberlain, with lords in waiting.)       CHAMB.      I rejoice      That unadvised of any but the voice      Of royal instinct in the blood, your Highness      Has ta'en the chair that you were born to fill.       SEG.      The chair?       CHAMB.      The royal throne of Poland, Sir,      Which may your Royal Highness keep as long      As he that now rules from it shall have ruled      When heaven has call'd him to itself.       SEG.      When he?--       CHAMB.      Your royal father, King Basilio, Sir.       SEG.      My royal father--King Basilio.      You see I answer but as Echo does,      Not knowing what she listens or repeats.      This is my throne--this is my palace--Oh,      But this out of the window?--       CHAMB.      Warsaw, Sir,      Your capital--       SEG.      And all the moving people?       CHAMB.      Your subjects and your vassals like ourselves.       SEG.      Ay, ay--my subjects--in my capital--      Warsaw--and I am Prince of it--You see      It needs much iteration to strike sense      Into the human echo.       CHAMB.      Left awhile      In the quick brain, the word will quickly to      Full meaning blow.       SEG.      You think so?       CHAMB.      And meanwhile      Lest our obsequiousness, which means no worse      Than customary honour to the Prince      We most rejoice to welcome, trouble you,      Should we retire again? or stand apart?      Or would your Highness have the music play      Again, which meditation, as they say,      So often loves to float upon?       SEG.      The music?      No--yes--perhaps the trumpet--      (Aside)      Yet if that      Brought back the troop!       A LORD.      The trumpet! There again      How trumpet-like spoke out the blood of Poland!       CHAMB.      Before the morning is far up, your Highness      Will have the trumpet marshalling your soldiers      Under the Palace windows.       SEG.      Ah, my soldiers--      My soldiers--not black-vizor'd?--       CHAMB.      Sir?       SEG.      No matter.      But--one thing--for a moment--in your ear--      Do you know one Clotaldo?       CHAMB.      Oh, my Lord,      He and myself together, I may say,      Although in different vocations,      Have silver'd in your royal father's service;"]]]
