John seemed to be as excited a talker as any one, but his mother saw him send many a searching glance around for some one he had not found.  She managed to reach his side without attracting the attention of the others, and slyly whispered: \"Anne Stewart went out towards the Cliffs a moment ago. I saw her leave by the back pathway.\"  Then while every one was trying to make out the cloud-draped peak of Grizzly Slide, having had their attention directed to it by an exclamation from Mrs. Brewster, John backed away and ran behind the kitchen to the path that led to the Cliffs and Anne.  Jeb found it necessary to fill the wood-box in the kitchen, and it was just after John had passed there that he stumbled up the stone walk. Sary stood in the doorway grinning sympathetically as she watched John dash away after Anne Stewart, when Jeb said:  \"Lem'me get by wid this load of wood.\"  She smirked and said: \"Ah, Jeb! Thar's nuthin' in the wurruld like young love, ain't it?\"  Now Sary's would-be bewitching leer and her dangerous proximity to him, frightened Jeb worse than any Rocky Mountain avalanche ever, so that he forgot he held an armful of wood. He suddenly went lax in the muscles, dropped the wood, and turned to flee to his hay-loft where no Sary dared follow without a chaperone.  One stick of the wood fell upon Sary's toe, and not having \"feet of brass or clay,\" she uttered a yelp of pain. Jeb never stopped to inquire what had caused that cry--whether of baffled love or shooting pains in a toe.  Sary limped over to a wooden chair and sitting there with her foot held tenderly in both hands, she rocked back and forth, threatening, in an undertone, all males but Jeb in particular.  \"You-all jes' wait! Don't think Sary Dodd's a fule--cuz she hain't! Ah'll git you yit, so run away an' make-out like-es-how you are free and not lookin' to any female in pertickler!\"  Having thus unburdened her soul of its wrath against Jeb, the cook limped over to the stove to hang the kettle over the fire.  Supper was late that night, but no one noticed it. Sary had perfected a scheme she was going to try on Jeb, some day, soon, so she was all smiles and patience when the family gathered about the table.  \"I see you set the table in the living-room, mother,\" remarked John, approvingly.  \"Oh, we have wrought many changes this summer, John, but the best of all is the one whereby we eat out-of-doors when it is good weather. To-night we will eat here as it is too dark under the old oak,\" explained Mrs. Brewster, smiling.  Plans were now discussed for the trip to Top Notch the following morning, and it was decided that Jeb should go for Mike early, and secure his services as before.  \"If such a crowd of men are going, I don't see why the owners of the mine can't go, too. We are as safe there, as here,\" grumbled Polly.  \"Because we are going to make a three days' trip of this, Poll, and women-folk would not feel comfortable with such a lot of mixed men,\" explained John, pulling his sister's hair, lovingly.  \"Well, Polly and I are as good riders as any one of you, and seeing it is _our_ mine, we ought to have _some_thing to say about it,\" added Eleanor, poutingly.  \"I suppose you-all have forgotten that we invited that nice young stranger and his friend, Jim Latimer, over to spend this Sunday with us,\" now ventured Mrs. Brewster.  \"Oh, that's so! The boy Kenneth who looks like Montresor!\" Anne now added, understanding Mrs. Brewster's idea and abetting it.  \"Kenneth Evans! Is it _this_ Sunday he is coming?\" asked Eleanor eagerly.  \"We might be back on time for that; this is only Friday night, you know,\" persisted Polly, clinging to the hope of riding to Top Notch.  \"No girl or woman is going--let that end the argument!\" now said Mr. Brewster, with finality.  There was silence for a moment, then Polly laughingly said to Eleanor: \"Nolla, you and I will ride over to visit some old friends of mine to-morrow. We will take our lunch and spend the day with them. As it is half-way on the Bear Forks road we might as well ride with our boys when they go.\"  \"Polly, we plan to leave here before dawn so we can be on the climb when day breaks. Nolla and you will please remember to be fast asleep at that time. Good-night!\"  With these words, Sam Brewster got up and started to go to his room, but Polly would not allow her daddy to leave her in that frame of mind. So she ran over and jumped up to throw her arms about his neck in her usual fashion. What she whispered in his ear no one knew but he smiled and nodded his head in meek acquiescence.  \"Poll--did he say we might go?\" whispered Eleanor.  \"No--he won't give in that far, but he said we could ride with them as far as Bear Forks, if we were up in time. I'm bound to wake up, so now I'm going right to bed,\" said Polly.  But Polly and Eleanor did not wake up in the morning until seven o'clock. The riders were far up along the trail by that time, so the girls had to make the best of the day.  When the men riders were well along the trail, Jeb motioned to Mr. Brewster that he wished to speak with him, so they permitted their horses to slow up and drop behind for a time.  \"Ah'm thinkin', Mis'r Brewster, thet Ah'll have to give notice that Ah'm quittin' your ranch. Not what Ah've got any kick comin' about the fam'ly--thar never w'ar a nicer one. But Ah've got ta save mahself.\"  \"Jeb!\" gasped Sam Brewster in unbelief. \"You _couldn't_ leave us! Why, man, you're one of the family.\"  \"Yeh, Ah knows all that, Mis'r Brewster, but Ah jus' dasent stay where a female badgers my peace o' mind.\"  \"Tell me what is wrong, Jeb, and Ah'll fix it if Ah can,\" anxiously promised Sam Brewster.  Jeb gazed wildly about for some one to explain for him, and in gazing, his eye rested on John. Big splendid John who had only been a little shaver when he went to Pebbly Pit to work.  \"Oh John! Cain't you-all drop back and tell your Paw what ails me?\" shouted Jeb, certain that John, who had been to college, could do anything.  John dropped behind his companions, and Sam Brewster hurriedly explained that Jeb seemed to have a queer belief that he would be done for if he remained at Pebbly Pit.  \"Oh, did Jeb bother you about that story, Dad? Here, you ride on in my place, and let me get this thing straightened out.\"  Alone with Jeb, John said persuasively: \"Now tell me all about it, Jeb--begin from the beginning.\"  \"Wall, seein' es how you-all is in love, mebbe you-all kin understand about this love-stuff.  \"Now, yuh see, John, when that Sary Dodd come to Pebbly Pit es a widder, to help housework, she never cast an eye around fer a likely 'second' until that derned old dance at the school-house. It wuz that time when she perked up in all that borrered finery that she landed a rich ole bachelor-rancher on her ticket to dinner. But he gave one look and run. He never showed up again that night.  \"Seein' like-es-how her partner vamoosed, she grabbed me to do the Grand March with her. Mebbe it w'ar the way Ah danced, that took her fancy. But whatever it w'ar, she's ben locooed after me sence that night.  \"Now, John, yuh know Sary ain't no prize-winner fer looks, en Ah knows a good looker when Ah seez one, cuz Ah hev sat and seen lots of pritty gals on the movie sheet in Oak Crick. Gosh! Some of them peaches Ah see'd would make yuh leave a stiddy job like Pebbly Pit. So Ah saved and _saved_ till now Ah've got a tidy bit laid by fer some pritty gal, like them in the Movies.  \"Ef Sary Dodd knew Ah had money saved! Phew! She'd get at it whar Ah hid it in a hole under the barn-rafters, then she'd hold it out to tempt me, like-es-how yuh lead a balky cow to be milked. But that is one thing Sary _don't_ know!\"  John laughed loud and long at the picture Jeb graphically sketched of Sary and himself, but the orator cared nothing for John's laughing. He was too concerned over his freedom.  \"Sary's got some good points--yuh've got to hand it to her, even ef she hain't got a figger like Miss Anne's, and hair like Miss Polly's. But she can cook! Gosh, _cain't_ she cook and clean. So ef it w'ar a housekeeper er a business partner Ah wanted, Ah coulden pick a better one than Sary Dodd.  \"But yuh unnerstand me, John, don't yuh, when Ah says Ah wants something pritty sittin' afore the pianner to sing to me, or dressin' up in finery like Miss Bob's and playin' a lady? Ah've ben a hired man and worked on a ranch all mah life, but now Ah've got a bit saved up Ah kin go to the city and pick th' gal Ah wants.  \"And lem'me tell yuh, John! In the Movies them gals what looks so pritty make _fine_ farm-wives. Gosh, but one city gal with yaller curls hadn't a cent to live on when she met a feller what owned a little ranch in Arizony. They hooked up and she was that happy on the farm! She churned the butter and fed chickens and did all the chores. And he looked after the stock. Evenin's she played and sang fer him and he sat in a big arm-chair and smiled at her.  \"That's the kind of wife Ah wants, John--and how kin Ah sit and listen to Sary sing? Mebbe she kin _churn_ better'n that one I saw in the Movies, but Ah bet a plugged penny that she cain't play a pianner!\"  Jeb's tone was so emphatic at the last accusation of Sary's short-comings, that John almost rolled from his horse with laughter.  Now Jeb had said all that he had to say, so he waited patiently for John to get over his spasm of laughter. Then he looked at him as if to ask what had he to say about such positive evidence as he had brought forth, regarding the Movie girl making the best kind of a rancher's wife?  \"Oh, Jeb! How I love your innocence!\" gasped John, wiping his eyes on the back of his hand. \"I shall certainly sue the Movies for betraying your trust and faith in womankind. For they sure did more than amuse you for your dime. You took for a solid fact, all the silly mush you saw on the screen as real life. But, it was _reel_ life, Jeb,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25419"],["title","Polly and Eleanor (#8)"],["body","with two 'e's' instead of the genuine r-e-a-l way.  \"Jeb, how'd you like to spend every nickel you've saved, on a girl with dyed hair, belladonna eyes, painted lips you could never kiss, blackened eye-lashes and eye-brows, and goodness only knows what else she puts on and takes off to look pretty in the pictures?\"  Jeb listened with loose jaw and wide-opened eyes to this strange description of all the lady-loves he knew on the screen.  \"Why, Jeb, these blonde Movie beauties have a different husband every few months. The ones who play star-leads make the biggest splash in the puddles, but the little ones try to mimic the big stars and get into all sorts of trouble. I haven't heard of but two or three who could treat a good husband decently. As for sitting at home playing and singing for you--ha, ha, ha! It costs about five hundred dollars each evening to entertain one of them.  \"Churn? Did you say she looked so cute in a big bungalow apron churning the butter on a vine-clad porch? Didn't the porch open right out on a little pasture and tidy barnyard, where her devoted husband could stand admiring her? Was it a dear little one-and-a-half story vine-clad house painted white, with green wooden shutters?\"  \"Uh, huh! Just so! Did you see that gal, John?\" eagerly asked Jeb.  \"Jeb, the Movies use that same little house and painted scenery for every farm-picture they make. Sometimes a deserted wife hangs to the post of the porch and plans to kill herself. Or sometimes it is the husband who hears how his head man ran away with his foolish little wife. But, Jeb, never believe anything you see in the Movies, for they have turned more heads than you can count, by their subtle ways. Everything always ends right in the Movies, but it is seldom so in real life.  \"Now do you want my best advice, Jeb?\"  \"Ah shore do, John, cuz you-all knows what's what!\"  \"Then listen, Jeb, and think things over well before you leave Pebbly Pit and take your money away to spend on a pretty Movie gal.  \"You say that Sary is a right smart cook and houseworker. You admit that she is thrifty, and will save that money you've got hidden away in the barn.  \"Now look at that good-fer-nothing Bill Dodd she married! In less than a year she had him working on a ranch that she saved up for. Didn't she keep him at it until it was most paid up? If he hadn't gone with the flu, that ranch'd been paid for in another year.  \"Sary isn't so feeble, neither. She can save twenty more ranches before she cripples up. Any man who has ambition would make no mistake in choosing Sary. Now I believe Sary would make a big man of you, Jeb.  \"She may not dye her hair or paint her face, but she's got a square look, and we-all know what sound stock she comes of. There isn't a better family in all Colorado than the Morson's. And Sary Morson is all there! She has sterling qualities that will last after beauty and singing is worn thread-bare.  \"Of course she isn't anything like Anne Stewart--there never was any girl like her! But you make a big mistake if you go away to find a pretty girl, all dolled up like the Movie Queens, for your wife. She'd take all your money and laugh at you the next moment.  \"I've lived in big cities, Jeb, and seen a lot of the ways of pretty girls who dress up and pose for the boys, but not one of that kind is worth a shake. Take it from me, Jeb, you'd be happy and contented if you had a ranch of your own, and a sensible wife to make you toe the mark. You're too easy for any other sort, Jeb, although you figure that you need an ideal. Not so, my man!\"  Jeb heaved a mighty sigh as if he was passing on his rainbow dreams forever. Then he turned sorrowful eyes on John.  \"Wall, Ah cain't fergit that pooty gal in a hurry, even when Sary heaves in sight wid a heaped plate of puddin' fer me. Ah s'pose Ah'll hev to let _her_ marry me, er git out to onct. Sence yuh've ben talkin', Ah have a sort of weakenin' fer her capable ways, and shore ez shootin', she'll grab the first chanst Ah gives her to know the wust, because this is leap-year.\"  John shouted with laughter again, and Tom Latimer turned back his horse to ask what the joke was about.  \"Nothing that concerns little boys like you, Tom,\" laughed John, as he winked at his friend.  \"But I feel sure I can be of help to Jeb as well as to you, John,\" insisted Tom.  \"No, Mis'r Tom. It's all over,\" sighed Jeb, in a funereal tone. \"Ah've made up mah mind to take the med'cine, er beat it!\"  With that, Jeb spurred his horse on and joined his master, leaving John to merely hint at the great trouble that almost disrupted the household at Pebbly Pit. \"Now, thank Heavens, I have saved the ranch from ruin, and united two hearts that ought to beat as one, hereafter!\"  Tom laughed. \"I'm glad you confessed to your profession. I'll be wary of your match-making, in the future.\"  \"But you have to find matches before you can make them,\" laughed John.  \"You are so blind that you only see one pretty girl at Pebbly Pit, whereas there are four!\" exclaimed Tom, smilingly.  \"Four! Anne Stewart is one, and Miss Maynard may _consider_ herself lovely enough for a match--I don't. But mother and Sary will never consent to your including them in your match-making.\"  \"Hah! I thought so! You are so blind over Anne Stewart, that you fail to see how your own little sister is growing up to be a stunning miss. Why, she will be a beauty at twenty, for she is on the high-way there already.\"  \"Tom!\" gasped John. \"Wh-y--Polly is only a child!\"  \"That's what all brothers think of their pretty sisters. Some day, a fine young fellow will think differently, and you'll want to club him. But the trouble is, that Polly will think exactly as the handsome man thinks, and she will not listen to her big brother's advice to remain a little girl.  \"Besides Polly, there is Eleanor Maynard. She, too, is a fine girl and will grow to wonderful womanhood. Now, John, take more notice of your 'little' sister, for she is what we boys call a 'peach.'\"  \"Ha, ha, ha! I've never heard you say so much about a girl in my life! If I didn't _know_ better, I'd say you were half-way in love with Polly, yourself. But I know what a quitter you are whenever there is a girl in the party,\" laughed John.  Tom flushed slightly but made no reply. Before John could tease him any further, the party reached Four Mile Blaze. Mike tolled off the riders, and warned each one to give strictest attention to the going as one misstep meant a crippled horse or a serious accident.  From there on, the men rode through the lodge-pole forest to avoid the great mass of débris formed of rocks, earth, and torn-up trees that obstructed the old trail. Simms felt sure his man had escaped in some miraculous manner, after the avalanche swept him from his feet. But seeing the mountains of wood-trash that were washed down from the peak and piled up everywhere, he lost faith.  Still he and his men were bound to make the most of the least hope, so they sought thoroughly over the side where the two miners had been discovered, that day. Nothing but trees, rocks, and earth piled in toppling heaps on the steep slope of the mountain were seen, however.  While Simms and Bill sought over every foot of ground for their missing friend, Mike led Sam Brewster and his two engineers, down the opposite slope, to a blaze that told them they were going towards the cave. But the nearer they came to the claim, the greater was the destruction of the forest. Finally they could see where the ledge had been, but so massed up was the trash that had been swept down and over the side, that it was impossible to reach the ravine.  Mike chuckled: \"Him unner alla trees on Grizzly Sly--him yaller insides safe nuff!\"  \"You're right, Mike,\" laughed John. \"If the gold is in that spot it is safe enough for a long time to come.\"  \"I think this slide was the luckiest thing that ever happened to the girls,\" ventured Tom Latimer, thoughtfully.  \"Why?\" anxiously demanded Mr. Brewster, visions of his darling being carried away to school uppermost in his mind.  \"When we are ready to bore for the gold, this trash will be an easy thing to burn and clear away. Meantime, it keeps off all claim-jumpers or thieves who need a little hard yellow metal.\"  \"But you must admit that it is a tough proposition to mine here,\" said Mr. Brewster. \"A land-slide is apt to happen any moment and bury all the apparatus. All previous efforts will be wiped out and you must begin all over again. Then consider the difficulty of transportation, from this peak down the long trail, and over miles of rough country to the Oak Creek railway.\"  \"Hoh! a mere bagatelle, Mr. Brewster, when gold weighs in the other scale. Why, men will dig through the earth for gold! See what happened in Alaska. Once men found gold to be had for the pain and privation they would be forced to endure, they gladly gave up home, loved ones,--all--for the lust of gold.  \"And see what that drive did for Alaska. Railroads opened, cities founded, people settled there, and all because men fought with odds against finding buried gold!\"  \"We wouldn't have to worry over this out-of-the-way mine if father would consent to have his cliffs utilized,\" hinted John.  \"Not with my consent!\" retorted Sam Brewster.  \"Well, come on, Mike. Let's pitch camp and get something to eat,\" said John, resignedly.  \"It's not that I have any silly sentiment over the cliffs, my boys--don't mistake me there. But I have a serious reason for refusing to coin money out of that beauty--at least for a few years to come.\"  \"If I guess the truth about it, will you admit it to me some day?\" quizzed Tom Latimer, his eyes twinkling.  \"No, sir! Not even to my wife--it's _my_ secret!\"     CHAPTER V  POLLY AND ELEANOR VISIT THE BEAVERS   After breakfast the four girls asked each other what there was to do. They had had so much excitement all week, that the simple life palled on them.  \"It's exactly like drinking milk after you have been kept on"]]]
