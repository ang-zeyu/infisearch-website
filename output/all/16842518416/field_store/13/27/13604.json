I nodded encouragingly, and, to my intense relief, he produced a huge saucepan from under the counter, so that we trotted out of Bailleul with our saddle bags full, and the saucepan dangling from a piece of string round the Captain's neck.  Misfortunes never come singly. We were not more than a hundred yards from the town when the Captain handed the saucepan to me. \"You might take it,\" he said, \"while I shorten my stirrups.\"  The pack horse becomes accustomed to an enormous variety of loads, but apparently the saucepan was something in the shape of a disagreeable novelty to him. He began to trot, and that utensil rattled noisily against the bottle of liqueur protruding from my saddle bag. The more the saucepan rattled the faster went the horse, and the more precarious became my seat. In a few seconds I was going across country at a furious gallop.  If I let go my hold of the saucepan it rattled violently, and spurred the pack horse on to even greater pace; if I held on to the saucepan I could not pull up my horse and I stood but little chance of remaining on its back at all, for I am a horseman of but very little skill.  Suddenly I saw a gate barring my way ahead. I let go the saucepan and something cracked in my saddle bag. I seized the reins and dragged at the horse's mouth. Then, just as I was wondering how one stuck on a horse's back when it tried to jump, someone rode up from the other side and opened the gate.  But it was only when I was right in the gateway that I saw what lay ahead. Just before me was a major at the head of a squadron of cavalry. The next second I was amongst them.  A fleeting glimpse of the Major's horse pawing the air with its forelegs, a scattering of a hundred and fifty men before me, and I had passed them all and was galloping up the steep slope of the hill.  When at last the Captain came up with me, I was standing at the top of the Mont Noir, wiping Benedictine from my breeches and puttees. I made an attempt at jocularity. \"I shall have to speak to Parkes about this engine,\" I said. \"The controls don't work properly, and she accelerates much too quickly.\"  But the Captain saw the ruin of the liqueur bottle lying by the roadside, and was not in the mood for amusement. So we rode in silence down the hill, while the flames of Ypres gleamed and flickered in the distance.  Of a sudden, however, the Captain burst into a roar of laughter.  \"It was worth it,\" he panted as he rolled in his saddle, \"to see the poor blighters scatter. Lord! but it was lovely to hear that Major curse.\"     X  THE LIAR   For an hour and a half we had been crumped and whizz-banged and trench-mortared as never before, but it was not until the shelling slackened that one could really see the damage done. The sudden explosions of whizz-bangs, the increasing whine and fearful bursts of crumps, and, worst of all, the black trench-mortar bombs that came hurtling and twisting down from the skies, kept the nerves at a pitch which allowed of no clear vision of the smashed trench and the wounded men.  However, as the intervals between the explosions grew longer and longer the men gradually pulled themselves together and began to look round. The havoc was appalling. Where the telephone dug-out had been was now a huge hole--a mortar bomb had landed there, and had blown the telephone orderly almost on to the German wire, fifty yards away; great gaps, on which the German machine guns played at intervals, were made all along our parapet; the casualties were being sorted out as well as possible--the dead to be carried into an old support trench, and there to await burial, the wounded to be hurried down to the overcrowded dressing station as quickly as the bearers could get the stretchers away; the unhurt--scarcely half the company--were, for the most part, still gazing up into the sky in the expectation of that twisting, all too familiar, black bomb that has such a terrific devastating power. Gradually quiet came again, and the men set about their interrupted business--their sleep to be snatched, their work to be finished before the long night with its monotonous watching and digging began.  With the Sergeant-major I went down the trench to discuss repairs, for much must be done as soon as night fell. Then, leaving him to make out a complete list of the casualties, I returned to my dug-out to share the rations of rum with Bennett, the only subaltern who remained in the company.  \"Where's the rum?\" I asked. \"Being shelled makes one thirsty.\"  He handed me a cup, at the bottom of which a very little rum was to be seen. \"I divided it as well as I could,\" he said rather apologetically.  \"If you were thinking of yourself at the time, you certainly did,\" I answered as I prepared myself for battle, for nothing sets your nerves right again as quickly as a \"scrap.\"  We were interrupted, however, in the preliminaries by the Sergeant-major, who brought with him a handful of letters and pay books, the effects of the poor fellows who were now lying under waterproof sheets in the support trench.  \"Total killed forty-one, sir, and I'm afraid Sergeant Wall didn't get down to the dressing station in time. It's a bad day for us to-day. Oh, and by the way, sir, that fellow Spiller has just been found dead at the end of the communicating trench.\"  \"Which end, Sergeant-major?\" I asked.  \"The further end, sir. He left the trench without leave. He told Jones, who was next to him, that he was not going to have any more damned shelling, and he appears to have made off immediately after.\"  Bennett whistled. \"Is that the blighter whom poor old Hayes had to threaten with his revolver the day before we were gassed?\"  The Sergeant-major nodded.  \"It's just the sort of thing he would do,\" said Bennett, whose hand was still unsteady from the strain of an hour ago, \"to bunk when Brother Boche is giving us a little crumping to keep us amused.\"  I turned to the Sergeant-major. \"Let me have these fellows' effects,\" I said. \"As to Spiller, I don't expect he could have really been bunking. At all events, let the other fellows think I sent him to Headquarters and he got hit on the way. I expect he was going down with a stretcher party.\" But, in my heart, I knew better. I knew Spiller for a coward.  It is not for me to judge such a man. God knows it is no man's fault if he is made so that his nerves may fail him at a critical moment. Besides, many a man who is capable of heroism that would win him the Victoria Cross fails when called upon to stand more than a few weeks of trench warfare, for a few minutes of heroism are very different to months of unrelieved strain. However, Spiller and his like let a regiment down, and one is bound to despise them for that.  Thoughts of our \"scrap\" had entirely left us, for Bennett and I had before us one of the most uncongenial tasks that an officer can have. The news has to be broken by someone when a wife is suddenly made a widow, and the task is generally taken on by the dead man's platoon commander, who sends back home his letters and papers. There were many men who had died that afternoon, and letters of condolence and bad news are always difficult to write, so that there was silence in our dug-out for the next two hours.  The last pay book I examined had belonged to Private E. Spiller. His other belongings were scanty--a few coppers, a much-chewed pencil, and two letters. I looked at the latter for a clue as to whom I ought to write; one was in his own handwriting and unfinished, the other was from a girl with whom he had been \"walking out,\" apparently his only friend in the world, as she alone was mentioned in the little will written at the end of his pay book. But her love was enough. Her letter was ill-spelt and badly written, but it expressed more love than is given to most men.  \"Take care of yourself, Erny dear, for my sake,\" she wrote. \"I am so proud of you doing so well in them horrid trenches.... Dear Erny, you can't have no idear how pleased I am that you are so brave, but be quick and come back to me what loves you so....\"  So brave! I tried to laugh at the unconscious irony of it all, but my laugh would not come, for something in my throat held it back--perhaps I was a little overwrought by the recent shelling.  I turned to the other letter, which I have thought fit to transcribe in full:     \"DEAREST LIZ,     \"I hope this finds you as it leaves me at present in the pink. Dear    Liz, i am doing very well and i will tell you a secret--i am going to    be rekermended for the V.C. becos i done so well in the trenches. i    don't feel a bit fritened wich is nice, and, dear Liz, i hope to be    made Lance Corpril soon as my officer is so ...\"         *       *       *       *       *  And here it ended, this letter from a liar. I balanced it on my knee and wondered what to do with it. Should I tear it up and write to the girl to tell her the truth--that her lover was a liar and a coward? Should I tear his letter up and just announce his death? For some minutes I hesitated, and then I put his half-finished letter in an envelope and added a note to tell her.  \"He died like a soldier,\" I finished. \"His letter will tell you better than any words of mine how utterly without fear he was.\"  And I wish no other lie were heavier on my conscience than is the lie I told to her.     XI  THE CITY OF TRAGEDY   What does it matter that the Cloth Hall and the Cathedral are in ruins, that the homes and churches are but rubble in the streets?

CONCLUSION                  246     FRONTIER BOYS ON THE COAST     CHAPTER I  CAPTAIN BILL BROOM   \"What devilment has old Bill got on for tonight, Pete?\"  The speaker was seated on an old scarred sea chest in a dimly lighted forecastle.  \"I dunno,\" replied Pete, \"maybe he's lookin' fer a wreck.\"  \"I heard the mate say somethin' about a passel of four boys,\" put in a third man who was laying back in his bunk, \"that the skipper was a-lookin' for.\"  \"Kidnapping, eh?\" said Cales, the first speaker. \"Hold 'em for ransom, I suppose. Well, the old man has been in worse games than that. I reckon the kids' parents are rich and are willin' to pay a high price for their darlings.\"  \"You're on the wrong tack, matey,\" said the man in the bunk. \"Cap'n Brinks, who landed in San Diego from a Mexican port put the old man wise. He told him that those fellars had considerable money and a raft of jewels with 'em that they picked up in Mexico.\"  \"Ho, Ho, that's the game, is it,\" cried Cales, thumping his knee with a gnarled fist, \"that ought to be easy then.\"  \"Looks so, but it ain't,\" replied the other, \"those four boys have got somethin' of a reputation in the southwest. Hard fighters and good shots and their leader is a husky lad and about as crafty as a red Injun.\"  \"He ain't met the Old Man yet,\" said Cales significantly.  \"I don't see where you get all your news from, Jake,\" growled Pete from his seat on the chest, \"you ought to be a reporter.\"  \"I keep my eyes open and my mouth shet,\" replied Jake, \"any man can get larned if he will do that.\"  \"I'd like to have a picter of you with your mouth shet,\" remarked Pete. \"It's open even when you are asleep.\" He dodged just in time to avoid a heavy shoe flung from Jake's ready hand that crashed against the wall.  \"Don't do that agin,\" he warned, a red light showing in his eyes. \"I'll larn you boys that I ain't as old as I looks to be.\"  Jake laughed harshly.  \"You mustn't keep your own mouth open so wide, Pop, cause you'll have to swallow your own words if you do.\"  \"I guess I'll never git choked,\" replied Pete, truculently. \"Kin you tell me what the skipper means snooping down this coast with no lights showing when it's plumb dark? We are liable to sink ourselves or Californey all of a suddint.\"  \"Why don't you ask the Cap'n what he is up to?\" inquired Cales, \"that is, if you want some real useful information, Pop.\"  Pop raised himself up and glared at the speaker.  \"I ain't done living,\" he replied.  \"We are navigating pretty careful,\" remarked Jake. \"You can hardly feel the Sea Eagle moving.\"  \"Running for the cove, I reckon,\" suggested Cales, \"I'm mighty pleased not to be the man at the wheel. Well, I'm goin' to turn in for a snooze.\"  In a brief time the two men were snoring loudly, while old Pete sat smoking his pipe, as stolid as a wooden Indian and the forecastle was fogged with the smoke, through which the swinging lantern shone dimly. The air is stifling so let us go up on deck where we can breathe the salt ozone and incidentally get acquainted with Captain Bill Broom, who is to occupy such a prominent place in this narrative.  He is well worth meeting, not only as the opponent of our old friend, Jim Darlington, but because of his own unworthy but interesting character. In those days Skipper Bill Broom was known all up and down the coast and beyond. His fame, such as it was, comes down even to this recent day.  On deck it is muffling dark, with the stars obscured in some dim way by mist or fog. There is a breeze blowing steadily from the broad wastes of the ocean. The bulk of the California coast looms dimly on the port bow. Not more than a half mile distant can be seen the white rushing forward of the breakers towards the rocky coast.  Dangerous work this, navigating the Sea Eagle through the thick gloom of the night but the old man knew his business. He was on the bridge pacing back and forth like some strange animal and giving hoarse directions to the man at the wheel. He knew every inch of that coast, the sunken reefs and dangerous rocks.  \"Starboard your helm,\" he growled.  The sailor spun the wheel obediently. And the captain resumed his pacing back and forth upon the bridge. Not much could be seen of him, except that he was a powerful man, with a peculiar crouching stoop, as if he and the sea were engaged in a mysterious game. One striving to get a dangerous death-hold upon the other, both wary and using unceasing watchfulness.  There was a strange softness in Captain Broom's tread like that of a padding panther, but his arms had the loose forward powerful swing of a gorilla's. Once he stepped into the chart house to look at something and the light of the lamp will give us a square look at him.  \"That man a pirate!\" you exclaim at the first glance; one who carried the blackest name along the coast as a smuggler and wrecker, who had brought cargoes of wretched slaves from Africa in the days before the Civil War and who had had more marvelous escapes than any man in the history of piracy with the exception of Black Jack Morgan! Impossible!  \"Why that man is nothing but an old farmer,\" you exclaim in disappointment, when you see him. \"He ought to be peddling vegetables on market day.\" But just wait.  True, Skipper Broom had come from a long line of New England farmers, hard, close-fisted, close-mouthed men. Young Broom had broken away from the farm and followed his bent for sea-faring, but to the end of his days, he kept his farmerlike appearance and he affected many of the traits of the yeoman which he found to be on more than one occasion a most useful disguise.  Let's look at him. That heavy winter cap pulled down on his grizzled head gives him a most \"Reuben\" like appearance. Jeans pants are thrust into heavy cowhide boots. The deadly gray eyes soft as granite have become red rimmed from fits of fury and hard through many scenes of coldly calculated cruelty. A most dangerous customer and I for one, and I ought to know, consider that he will have the better of Jim Darlington in their approaching encounter--and yet Jim is never beaten until the last shot is fired and so it is impossible for me to foretell how this contest of wit and daring will come out.  After examining his chart closely, Captain Broom crouched out through the door and on to the deck. He took one keen look towards the shore, then he approached the helmsman. \"Git below, Bill. I'll fetch her in.\"  The helmsman relinquished the wheel gladly enough and under the Captain's masterful hand the Sea Eagle swung slowly around and pointed in towards the curving shore.  The dark form of the mate could be seen on the deck below waiting for the order that he knew must come soon. The crew of the Sea Eagle though subordinate enough were necessarily partners in Captain Broom's wicked enterprises so that the discipline was somewhat different than in ordinary vessels.  \"Call 'em up, Mr. Haffen,\" roared the skipper to the mate. \"It's chore time.\"  \"Aye, aye, sir,\" replied Mr. Haffen.  The watch was called on deck and the dark forms of the men could be seen in the bow. The pulsing of the Sea Eagle had stopped and with scarcely a sound the anchor was dropped into the "]]]
