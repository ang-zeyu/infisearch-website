Psmith watched him thoughtfully.  \"I have a suspicion, Comrade Jackson,\" he said, \"that this will prove to be a somewhat stout fellow. If possible, we will engage him in conversation. I wonder what he's got in the basket. I must get my Sherlock Holmes system to work. What is the most likely thing for a man to have in a basket? You would reply, in your unthinking way, 'sandwiches.' Error. A man with a basketful of sandwiches does not need to dine at restaurants. We must try again.\"  The young man at the next table had ordered a jug of milk to be accompanied by a saucer. These having arrived, he proceeded to lift the basket on to his lap, pour the milk into the saucer, and remove the lid from the basket. Instantly, with a yell which made the young man's table the centre of interest to all the diners, a large grey cat shot up like a rocket, and darted across the room. Psmith watched with silent interest.  It is hard to astonish the waiters at a New York restaurant, but when the cat performed this feat there was a squeal of surprise all round the room. Waiters rushed to and fro, futile but energetic. The cat, having secured a strong strategic position on the top of a large oil-painting which hung on the far wall, was expressing loud disapproval of the efforts of one of the waiters to drive it from its post with a walking-stick. The young man, seeing these manoeuvres, uttered a wrathful shout, and rushed to the rescue.  \"Comrade Jackson,\" said Psmith, rising, \"we must be in this.\"  When they arrived on the scene of hostilities, the young man had just possessed himself of the walking-stick, and was deep in a complex argument with the head-waiter on the ethics of the matter. The head-waiter, a stout impassive German, had taken his stand on a point of etiquette. \"Id is,\" he said, \"to bring gats into der grill-room vorbidden. No gendleman would gats into der grill-room bring. Der gendleman--\"  The young man meanwhile was making enticing sounds, to which the cat was maintaining an attitude of reserved hostility. He turned furiously on the head-waiter.  \"For goodness' sake,\" he cried, \"can't you see the poor brute's scared stiff? Why don't you clear your gang of German comedians away, and give her a chance to come down?\"  \"Der gendleman--\" argued the head-waiter.  Psmith stepped forward and touched him on the arm.  \"May I have a word with you in private?\"  \"Zo?\"  Psmith drew him away.  \"You don't know who that is?\" he whispered, nodding towards the young man.  \"No gendleman he is,\" asserted the head-waiter. \"Der gendleman would not der gat into--\"  Psmith shook his head pityingly.  \"These petty matters of etiquette are not for his Grace--but, hush, he wishes to preserve his incognito.\"  \"Ingognito?\"  \"You understand. You are a man of the world, Comrade--may I call you Freddie? You understand, Comrade Freddie, that in a man in his Grace's position a few little eccentricities may be pardoned. You follow me, Frederick?\"  The head-waiter's eye rested upon the young man with a new interest and respect.  \"He is noble?\" he inquired with awe.  \"He is here strictly incognito, you understand,\" said Psmith warningly. The head-waiter nodded.  The young man meanwhile had broken down the cat's reserve, and was now standing with her in his arms, apparently anxious to fight all-comers in her defence. The head-waiter approached deferentially.  \"Der gendleman,\" he said, indicating Psmith, who beamed in a friendly manner through his eye-glass, \"haf everything exblained. All will now quite satisfactory be.\"  The young man looked inquiringly at Psmith, who winked encouragingly. The head-waiter bowed.  \"Let me present Comrade Jackson,\" said Psmith, \"the pet of our English Smart Set. I am Psmith, one of the Shropshire Psmiths. This is a great moment. Shall we be moving back? We were about to order a second instalment of coffee, to correct the effects of a fatiguing day. Perhaps you would care to join us?\"  \"Sure,\" said the alleged duke.  \"This,\" said Psmith, when they were seated, and the head-waiter had ceased to hover, \"is a great meeting. I was complaining with some acerbity to Comrade Jackson, before you introduced your very interesting performing-animal speciality, that things in New York were too quiet, too decorous. I have an inkling, Comrade--\"  \"Windsor's my name.\"  \"I have an inkling, Comrade Windsor, that we see eye to eye on the subject.\"  \"I guess that's right. I was raised in the plains, and I lived in Kentucky a while. There's more doing there in a day than there is here in a month. Say, how did you fix it with the old man?\"  \"With Comrade Freddie? I have a certain amount of influence with him. He is content to order his movements in the main by my judgment. I assured him that all would be well, and he yielded.\" Psmith gazed with interest at the cat, which was lapping milk from the saucer. \"Are you training that animal for a show of some kind, Comrade Windsor, or is it a domestic pet?\"  \"I've adopted her. The office-boy on our paper got her away from a dog this morning, and gave her to me.\"  \"Your paper?\"  \"_Cosy Moments_,\" said Billy Windsor, with a touch of shame.  \"_Cosy Moments_?\" said Psmith reflectively. \"I regret that the bright little sheet has not come my way up to the present. I must seize an early opportunity of perusing it.\"  \"Don't you do it.\"  \"You've no paternal pride in the little journal?\"  \"It's bad enough to hurt,\" said Billy Windsor disgustedly. \"If you really want to see it, come along with me to my place, and I'll show you a copy.\"  \"It will be a pleasure,\" said Psmith. \"Comrade Jackson, have you any previous engagement for to-night?\"  \"I'm not doing anything,\" said Mike.  \"Then let us stagger forth with Comrade Windsor. While he is loading up that basket, we will be collecting our hats. . . . I am not half sure, Comrade Jackson,\" he added, as they walked out, \"that Comrade Windsor may not prove to be the genial spirit for whom I have been searching. If you could give me your undivided company, I should ask no more. But with you constantly away, mingling with the gay throng, it is imperative that I have some solid man to accompany me in my ramblings hither and thither. It is possible that Comrade Windsor may possess the qualifications necessary for the post. But here he comes. Let us foregather with him and observe him in private life before arriving at any premature decision.\"    CHAPTER IV  BAT JARVIS  Billy Windsor lived in a single room on East Fourteenth Street. Space in New York is valuable, and the average bachelor's apartments consist of one room with a bathroom opening off it. During the daytime this one room loses all traces of being used for sleeping purposes at night. Billy Windsor's room was very much like a public-school study. Along one wall ran a settee. At night this became a bed; but in the daytime it was a settee and nothing but a settee. There was no space for a great deal of furniture. There was one rocking-chair, two ordinary chairs, a table, a book-stand, a typewriter--nobody uses pens in New York--and on the walls a mixed collection of photographs, drawings, knives, and skins, relics of their owner's prairie days. Over the door was the head of a young bear.  Billy's first act on arriving in this sanctum was to release the cat, which, having moved restlessly about for some moments, finally came to the conclusion that there was no means of getting out, and settled itself on a corner of the settee. Psmith, sinking gracefully down beside it, stretched out his legs and lit a cigarette. Mike took one of the ordinary chairs; and Billy Windsor, planting himself in the rocker, began to rock rhythmically to and fro, a performance which he kept up untiringly all the time.  \"A peaceful scene,\" observed Psmith. \"Three great minds, keen, alert, restless during business hours, relax. All is calm and pleasant chit-chat. You have snug quarters up here, Comrade Windsor. I hold that there is nothing like one's own roof-tree. It is a great treat to one who, like myself, is located in one of these vast caravanserai--to be exact, the Astor--to pass a few moments in the quiet privacy of an apartment such as this.\"  \"It's beastly expensive at the Astor,\" said Mike.  \"The place has that drawback also. Anon, Comrade Jackson, I think we will hunt around for some such cubby-hole as this, built for two. Our nervous systems must be conserved.\"  \"On Fourth Avenue,\" said Billy Windsor, \"you can get quite good flats very cheap. Furnished, too. You should move there. It's not much of a neighbourhood. I don't know if you mind that?\"  \"Far from it, Comrade Windsor. It is my aim to see New York in all its phases. If a certain amount of harmless revelry can be whacked out of Fourth Avenue, we must dash there with the vim of highly-trained smell-dogs. Are you with me, Comrade Jackson?\"  \"All right,\" said Mike.  \"And now, Comrade Windsor, it would be a pleasure to me to peruse that little journal of which you spoke. I have had so few opportunities of getting into touch with the literature of this great country.\"  Billy Windsor stretched out an arm and pulled a bundle of papers from the book-stand. He tossed them on to the settee by Psmith's side.  \"There you are,\" he said, \"if you really feel like it. Don't say I didn't warn you. If you've got the nerve, read on.\"  Psmith had picked up one of the papers when there came a shuffling of feet in the passage outside, followed by a knock upon the door. The next moment there appeared in the doorway a short, stout young man. There was an indescribable air of toughness about him, partly due to the fact that he wore his hair in a well-oiled fringe almost down to his eyebrows, which gave him the appearance of having no forehead at all. His eyes were small and set close together. His mouth was wide, his jaw prominent. Not, in short, the sort of man you would have picked out on sight as a model"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2607"],["title","Psmith, Journalist (#3)"],["body",".  His entrance was marked by a curious sibilant sound, which, on acquaintance, proved to be a whistled tune. During the interview which followed, except when he was speaking, the visitor whistled softly and unceasingly.  \"Mr. Windsor?\" he said to the company at large.  Psmith waved a hand towards the rocking-chair. \"That,\" he said, \"is Comrade Windsor. To your right is Comrade Jackson, England's favourite son. I am Psmith.\"  The visitor blinked furtively, and whistled another tune. As he looked round the room, his eye fell on the cat. His face lit up.  \"Say!\" he said, stepping forward, and touching the cat's collar, \"mine, mister.\"  \"Are you Bat Jarvis?\" asked Windsor with interest.  \"Sure,\" said the visitor, not without a touch of complacency, as of a monarch abandoning his incognito.  For Mr. Jarvis was a celebrity.  By profession he was a dealer in animals, birds, and snakes. He had a fancier's shop in Groome street, in the heart of the Bowery. This was on the ground-floor. His living abode was in the upper story of that house, and it was there that he kept the twenty-three cats whose necks were adorned with leather collars, and whose numbers had so recently been reduced to twenty-two. But it was not the fact that he possessed twenty-three cats with leather collars that made Mr. Jarvis a celebrity.  A man may win a purely local reputation, if only for eccentricity, by such means. But Mr. Jarvis's reputation was far from being purely local. Broadway knew him, and the Tenderloin. Tammany Hall knew him. Long Island City knew him. In the underworld of New York his name was a by-word. For Bat Jarvis was the leader of the famous Groome Street Gang, the most noted of all New York's collections of Apaches. More, he was the founder and originator of it. And, curiously enough, it had come into being from motives of sheer benevolence. In Groome Street in those days there had been a dance-hall, named the Shamrock and presided over by one Maginnis, an Irishman and a friend of Bat's. At the Shamrock nightly dances were given and well attended by the youth of the neighbourhood at ten cents a head. All might have been well, had it not been for certain other youths of the neighbourhood who did not dance and so had to seek other means of getting rid of their surplus energy. It was the practice of these light-hearted sportsmen to pay their ten cents for admittance, and once in, to make hay. And this habit, Mr. Maginnis found, was having a marked effect on his earnings. For genuine lovers of the dance fought shy of a place where at any moment Philistines might burst in and break heads and furniture. In this crisis the proprietor thought of his friend Bat Jarvis. Bat at that time had a solid reputation as a man of his hands. It is true that, as his detractors pointed out, he had killed no one--a defect which he had subsequently corrected; but his admirers based his claim to respect on his many meritorious performances with fists and with the black-jack. And Mr. Maginnis for one held him in the very highest esteem. To Bat accordingly he went, and laid his painful case before him. He offered him a handsome salary to be on hand at the nightly dances and check undue revelry by his own robust methods. Bat had accepted the offer. He had gone to Shamrock Hall; and with him, faithful adherents, had gone such stalwarts as Long Otto, Red Logan, Tommy Jefferson, and Pete Brodie. Shamrock Hall became a place of joy and order; and--more important still--the nucleus of the Groome Street Gang had been formed. The work progressed. Off-shoots of the main gang sprang up here and there about the East Side. Small thieves, pickpockets and the like, flocked to Mr. Jarvis as their tribal leader and protector and he protected them. For he, with his followers, were of use to the politicians. The New York gangs, and especially the Groome Street Gang, have brought to a fine art the gentle practice of \"repeating\"; which, broadly speaking, is the art of voting a number of different times at different polling-stations on election days. A man who can vote, say, ten times in a single day for you, and who controls a great number of followers who are also prepared, if they like you, to vote ten times in a single day for you, is worth cultivating. So the politicians passed the word to the police, and the police left the Groome Street Gang unmolested and they waxed fat and flourished.  Such was Bat Jarvis.               *    *    *  \"Pipe de collar,\" said Mr. Jarvis, touching the cat's neck. \"Mine, mister.\"  \"Pugsy said it must be,\" said Billy Windsor. \"We found two fellows setting a dog on to it, so we took it in for safety.\"  Mr. Jarvis nodded approval.  \"There's a basket here, if you want it,\" said Billy.  \"Nope. Here, kit.\"  Mr. Jarvis stooped, and, still whistling softly, lifted the cat. He looked round the company, met Psmith's eye-glass, was transfixed by it for a moment, and finally turned again to Billy Windsor.  \"Say!\" he said, and paused. \"Obliged,\" he added.  He shifted the cat on to his left arm, and extended his right hand to Billy.  \"Shake!\" he said.  Billy did so.  Mr. Jarvis continued to stand and whistle for a few moments more.  \"Say!\" he said at length, fixing his roving gaze once more upon Billy. \"Obliged. Fond of de kit, I am.\"  Psmith nodded approvingly.  \"And rightly,\" he said. \"Rightly, Comrade Jarvis. She is not unworthy of your affection. A most companionable animal, full of the highest spirits. Her knockabout act in the restaurant would have satisfied the most jaded critic. No diner-out can afford to be without such a cat. Such a cat spells death to boredom.\"  Mr. Jarvis eyed him fixedly, as if pondering over his remarks. Then he turned to Billy again.  \"Say!\" he said. \"Any time you're in bad. Glad to be of service. You know the address. Groome Street. Bat Jarvis. Good night. Obliged.\"  He paused and whistled a few more bars, then nodded to Psmith and Mike, and left the room. They heard him shuffling downstairs.  \"A blithe spirit,\" said Psmith. \"Not garrulous, perhaps, but what of that? I am a man of few words myself. Comrade Jarvis's massive silences appeal to me. He seems to have taken a fancy to you, Comrade Windsor.\"  Billy Windsor laughed.  \"I don't know that he's just the sort of side-partner I'd go out of my way to choose, from what I've heard about him. Still, if one got mixed up with any of that East-Side crowd, he would be a mighty useful friend to have. I guess there's no harm done by getting him grateful.\"  \"Assuredly not,\" said Psmith. \"We should not despise the humblest. And now, Comrade Windsor,\" he said, taking up the paper again, \"let me concentrate myself tensely on this very entertaining little journal of yours. Comrade Jackson, here is one for you. For sound, clear-headed criticism,\" he added to Billy, \"Comrade Jackson's name is a by-word in our English literary salons. His opinion will be both of interest and of profit to you, Comrade Windsor.\"    CHAPTER V  PLANNING IMPROVEMENTS  \"By the way,\" said Psmith, \"what is your exact position on this paper? Practically, we know well, you are its back-bone, its life-blood; but what is your technical position? When your proprietor is congratulating himself on having secured the ideal man for your job, what precise job does he congratulate himself on having secured the ideal man for?\"  \"I'm sub-editor.\"  \"Merely sub? You deserve a more responsible post than that, Comrade Windsor. Where is your proprietor? I must buttonhole him and point out to him what a wealth of talent he is allowing to waste itself. You must have scope.\"  \"He's in Europe. At Carlsbad, or somewhere. He never comes near the paper. He just sits tight and draws the profits. He lets the editor look after things. Just at present I'm acting as editor.\"  \"Ah! then at last you have your big chance. You are free, untrammelled.\"  \"You bet I'm not,\" said Billy Windsor. \"Guess again. There's no room for developing free untrammelled ideas on this paper. When you've looked at it, you'll see that each page is run by some one. I'm simply the fellow who minds the shop.\"  Psmith clicked his tongue sympathetically. \"It is like setting a gifted French chef to wash up dishes,\" he said. \"A man of your undoubted powers, Comrade Windsor, should have more scope. That is the cry, 'more scope!' I must look into this matter. When I gaze at your broad, bulging forehead, when I see the clear light of intelligence in your eyes, and hear the grey matter splashing restlessly about in your cerebellum, I say to myself without hesitation, 'Comrade Windsor must have more scope.'\" He looked at Mike, who was turning over the leaves of his copy of _Cosy Moments_ in a sort of dull despair. \"Well, Comrade Jackson, and what is your verdict?\"  Mike looked at Billy Windsor. He wished to be polite, yet he could find nothing polite to say. Billy interpreted the look.  \"Go on,\" he said. \"Say it. It can't be worse than what I think.\"  \"I expect some people would like it awfully,\" said Mike.  \"They must, or they wouldn't buy it. I've never met any of them yet, though.\"  Psmith was deep in Luella Granville Waterman's \"Moments in the Nursery.\" He turned to Billy Windsor.  \"Luella Granville Waterman,\" he said, \"is not by any chance your _nom-de-plume_, Comrade Windsor?\"  \"Not on your life. Don't think it.\"  \"I am glad,\" said Psmith courteously. \"For, speaking as man to man, I must confess that for sheer, concentrated bilge she gets away with the biscuit with almost insolent ease. Luella Granville Waterman must go.\"  \"How do you mean?\"  \"She must go,\" repeated Psmith firmly. \"Your first act, now that you have swiped the editorial chair, must be to sack her.\"  \"But, say, I can't. The editor thinks a heap of her stuff.\"  \"We cannot help his troubles. We must act for the good of the paper. Moreover, you said, I think, that he was away?\"  \"So he is. But he'll come back.\"  \"Sufficient unto the day, Comrade Windsor. I have a suspicion that he will be the first to "]]]
