There isn't any Crinklink, to be sure; but if there had been you'd be severely whipped for breaking all those dishes.\"  [Illustration]  The Wizard now rose, took off the coat with the button heads, and spread it on the floor, wrong side up. At once there crept from beneath it a bear, a wolf, a cat, a weasel, and a field-mouse, who all rushed from the room and escaped into the mountains.  \"Come on, Toto,\" said Dorothy; \"let's go back to the Emerald City. You've given me a good scare, Wizard,\" she added, with dignity, \"and p'raps I'll forgive you, by'n'by; but just now I'm mad to think how easily you fooled me.\"  [Illustration]     TIKTOK AND THE NOME KING   The Nome King was unpleasantly angry. He had carelessly bitten his tongue at breakfast and it still hurt; so he roared and raved and stamped around in his underground palace in a way that rendered him very disagreeable.  It so happened that on this unfortunate day Tiktok, the Clockwork Man, visited the Nome King to ask a favor. Tiktok lived in the Land of Oz, and although he was an active and important person, he was made entirely of metal. Machinery within him, something like the works of a clock, made him move; other machinery made him talk; still other machinery made him think.  [Illustration]  Although so cleverly constructed, the Clockwork Man was far from perfect. Three separate keys wound up his motion machinery, his speech works, and his thoughts. One or more of these contrivances was likely to run down at a critical moment, leaving poor Tiktok helpless. Also some of his parts were wearing out, through much use, and just now his thought machinery needed repair. The skillful little Wizard of Oz had tinkered with Tiktok's thoughts without being able to get them properly regulated, so he had advised the Clockwork Man to go to the Nome King and secure a new set of springs, which would render his thoughts more elastic and responsive.  \"Be careful what you say to the Nome King,\" warned the Wizard. \"He has a bad temper and the least little thing makes him angry.\"  Tiktok promised, and the Wizard wound his machinery and set him walking in the direction of the Nome King's dominions, just across the desert from the Land of Oz. He ran down just as he reached the entrance to the underground palace, and there Kaliko, the Nome King's Chief Steward, found him and wound him up again.  \"I want to see the King,\" said Tiktok, in his jerky voice.  \"Well,\" remarked Kaliko, \"it may be safe for a cast-iron person like you to face his Majesty this morning; but you must announce yourself, for should I show my face inside the jewel-studded cavern where the King is now raving, I'd soon look like a dish of mashed potatoes, and be of no further use to anyone.\"  \"I'm not a-fraid,\" said Tiktok.  \"Then walk in and make yourself at home,\" answered Kaliko, and threw open the door of the King's cavern.  [Illustration]  Tiktok promptly walked in and faced the astonished Nome King, to whom he said: \"Good morn-ing. I want two new steel springs for my thought-works and a new cog-wheel for my speech-pro-du-cer. How a-bout it, your Maj-es-ty?\"  The Nome King growled a menacing growl and his eyes were red with rage.  \"How dare you enter my presence?\" he shouted.  \"I dare an-y-thing,\" said Tiktok. \"I'm not a-fraid of a fat Nome.\"  [Illustration]  This was true, yet an unwise speech. Had Tiktok's thoughts been in good working order he would have said something else. The angry Nome King quickly caught up his heavy mace and hurled it straight at Tiktok. When it struck the metal man's breast, the force of the blow burst the bolts which held the plates of his body together and they clattered to the floor in a score of pieces. Hundreds and hundreds of wheels, pins, cogs and springs filled the air like a cloud and then rattled like hail upon the floor.  Where Tiktok had stood was now only a scrap-heap and the Nome King was so amazed by the terrible effect of his blow that he stared in wonder.  His Majesty's anger quickly cooled. He remembered that the Clockwork Man was a favorite subject of the powerful Princess, Ozma of Oz, who would be sure to resent Tiktok's ruin.  \"Too bad! too bad!\" he muttered, regretfully. \"I'm really sorry I made junk of the fellow. I didn't know he'd break.\"  \"You'd better be,\" remarked Kaliko, who now ventured to enter the room. \"You'll have a war on your hands when Ozma hears of this, and the chances are you will lose your throne and your kingdom.\"  The Nome King turned pale, for he loved to rule the Nomes and did not know of any other way to earn a living in case Ozma fought and conquered him.  \"Do--do you think Ozma will be angry?\" he asked anxiously.  \"I'm sure of it,\" said Kaliko. \"And she has the right to be. You've made scrap-iron of her favorite.\"  The King groaned.  \"Sweep him up and throw the rubbish into the black pit,\" he commanded; and then he shut himself up in his private den and for days would see no one, because he was so ashamed of his unreasoning anger and so feared the results of his rash act.  Kaliko swept up the pieces, but he did not throw them into the black pit. Being a clever and skillful mechanic he determined to fit the pieces together again.  No man ever faced a greater puzzle; but it was interesting work and Kaliko succeeded. When he found a spring or wheel worn or imperfect, he made a new one.  [Illustration]  Within two weeks, by working steadily night and day, the Chief Steward completed his task and put the three sets of clockworks and the last rivet into Tiktok's body. He then wound up the motion machinery, and the Clockwork Man walked up and down the room as naturally as ever. Then Kaliko wound up the thought works and the speech regulator and said to Tiktok:  \"How do you feel now?\"  \"Fine,\" said the Clockwork Man. \"You have done a ve-ry good job, Kal-i-ko, and saved me from de-struc-tion. Much o-bliged.\"  \"Don't mention it,\" replied the Chief Steward. \"I quite enjoyed the work.\"  Just then the Nome King's gong sounded, and Kaliko rushed away through the jewel-studded cavern and into the den where the King had hidden, leaving the doors ajar.  \"Kaliko,\" said the King, in a meek voice, \"I've been shut up here long enough to repent bitterly the destruction of Tiktok. Of course Ozma will have revenge, and send an army to fight us, but we must take our medicine. One thing comforts me: Tiktok wasn't really a live person; he was only a machine man, and so it wasn't very wicked to stop his clockworks. I couldn't sleep nights, at first, for worry; but there's no more harm in smashing a machine man than in breaking a wax doll. Don't you think so?\"  \"I am too humble to think in the presence of your Majesty,\" said Kaliko.  \"Then get me something to eat,\" commanded the King, \"for I'm nearly starved. Two roasted goats, a barrel of cakes and nine mince pies will do me until dinnertime.\"  Kaliko bowed and hurried away to the royal kitchen, forgetting Tiktok, who was wandering around in the outer cavern. Suddenly the Nome King looked up and saw the Clockwork Man standing before him, and at the sight the monarch's eyes grew big and round and he fell a-trembling in every limb.  \"Away, grim Shadow!\" he cried. \"You're not here, you know; you're only a hash of cogwheels and springs, lying at the bottom of the black pit. Vanish, thou Vision of the demolished Tiktok, and leave me in peace--for I have bitterly repented!\"  [Illustration]  \"Then beg my pardon,\" said Tiktok in a gruff voice, for Kaliko had forgotten to oil the speech works.  But the sound of a voice coming from what he thought a mere vision was too much for the Nome King's shaken nerves. He gave a yell of fear and rushed from the room. Tiktok followed, so the King bolted through the corridors on a swift run and bumped against Kaliko, who was returning with a tray of things to eat. The sound of the breaking dishes, as they struck the floor, added to the King's terror and he yelled again and dashed into a great cavern where a thousand Nomes were at work hammering metal.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  \"Look out! Here comes a phantom clockwork man!\" screamed the terrified monarch, and every Nome dropped his tools and made a rush from the cavern, knocking over their King in their mad flight and recklessly trampling upon his prostrate fat body. So, when Tiktok came into the cavern, there was only the Nome King left, and he was rolling upon the rocky floor and howling for mercy, with his eyes fast shut so that he could not see what he was sure was a dreadful phantom that was coming straight toward him.  \"It oc-curs to me,\" said Tiktok calmly, \"that your Maj-es-ty is act-ing like a ba-by I am not a phan-tom. A phan-tom is unreal, while I am the real thing.\"  The King rolled over, sat up and opened his eyes.  \"Didn't I smash you to pieces?\" he asked in trembling tones.  \"Yes,\" said Tiktok.  \"Then you are nothing but a junk-heap, and this form in which you now appear cannot be real.\"  \"It is, though,\" declared Tiktok. \"Kal-i-ko picked up my piec-es and put me to-geth-er a-gain. I'm as good as new, and perhaps bet-ter.\"  \"That is true, your Majesty,\" added Kaliko, who now made his appearance, \"and I hope you will forgive me for mending Tiktok. He was quite broken up, after you smashed him, and I found it almost as hard a job to match his pieces as to pick turnips from gooseberry bushes. But I did it,\" he added proudly.  \"You are forgiven,\" announced the Nome King, rising to his feet and drawing a long breath. \"I will raise your wages one specto a year, and Tiktok shall return to the Land of Oz loaded with jewels for the Princess Ozma.\"  \"That is all right,\" said Tiktok. \"But what I want to know is, why did you hit me with your mace?\"  \"Because I was angry,\" admitted the King. \"When I am angry I always do something that I am sorry for afterward. So I have firmly resolved never to get angry again; unless--unless--\"  \"Unless what, your Majesty?\" inquired Kaliko.  [Illustration]  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25519"],["title","Little Wizard Stories of Oz (#3)"],["body","\"Unless something annoys me,\" said the Nome King. And then he went to his treasure-chamber to get the jewels for Princess Ozma of Oz.  [Illustration]     OZMA AND THE LITTLE WIZARD   Once upon a time there lived in the beautiful Emerald City, which lies in the center of the fairy Land of Oz, a lovely girl called Princess Ozma, who was ruler of all that country. And among those who served this girlish Ruler and lived in a cozy suite of rooms in her splendid palace, was a little, withered old man known as the Wizard of Oz.  [Illustration]  This little Wizard could do a good many queer things in magic; but he was a kind man, with merry, twinkling eyes and a sweet smile; so, instead of fearing him because of his magic, everybody loved him.  Now, Ozma was very anxious that all her people who inhabited the pleasant Land of Oz should be happy and contented, and therefore she decided one morning to make a journey to all parts of the country, that she might discover if anything was amiss, or anyone discontented, or if there was any wrong that ought to be righted. She asked the little Wizard to accompany her and he was glad to go.  \"Shall I take my bag of magic tools with me?\" he asked.  \"Of course,\" said Ozma. \"We may need a lot of magic before we return, for we are going into strange corners of the land, where we may meet with unknown creatures and dangerous adventures.\"  So the Wizard took his bag of magic tools and the two left the Emerald City and wandered over the country for many days, at last reaching a place far up in the mountains which neither of them had ever visited before. Stopping one morning at a cottage, built beside the rocky path which led into a pretty valley beyond, Ozma asked a man:  \"Are you happy? Have you any complaint to make of your lot?\"  And the man replied:  \"We are happy except for three mischievous Imps that live in yonder valley and often come here to annoy us. If your Highness would only drive away those Imps, I and my family would be very happy and very grateful to you.\"  \"Who are these bad Imps?\" inquired the girl Ruler.  \"One is named Olite, and one Udent and one Ertinent, and they have no respect for anyone or anything. If strangers pass through the valley the Imps jeer at them and make horrid faces and call names, and often they push travelers out of the path or throw stones at them. Whenever Imp Olite or Imp Udent or Imp Ertinent comes here to bother us, I and my family run into the house and lock all the doors and windows, and we dare not venture out again until the Imps have gone away.\"  Princess Ozma was grieved to hear this report and the little Wizard shook his head gravely and said the naughty Imps deserved to be punished. They told the good man they would see what could be done to protect him and at once entered the valley to seek the dwelling place of the three mischievous creatures.  [Illustration]  Before long they came upon three caves, hollowed from the rocks, and in front of each cave squatted a queer little dwarf. Ozma and the Wizard paused to examine them and found them well-shaped, strong and lively. They had big round ears, flat noses and wide grinning mouths, and their jet-black hair came to points on top of their heads, much resembling horns. Their clothing fitted snugly to their bodies and limbs and the Imps were so small in size that at first Ozma did not consider them at all dangerous. But one of them suddenly reached out a hand and caught the dress of the Princess, jerking it so sharply that she nearly fell down, and a moment later another Imp pushed the little Wizard so hard that he bumped against Ozma and both unexpectedly sat down upon the ground.  At this the Imps laughed boisterously and began running around in a circle and kicking dust upon the Royal Princess, who cried in a sharp voice: \"Wizard, do your duty!\"  The Wizard promptly obeyed. Without rising from the ground he opened his bag, got the tools he required and muttered a magic spell.  Instantly the three Imps became three bushes--of a thorny stubby kind--with their roots in the ground. As the bushes were at first motionless, perhaps through surprise at their sudden transformation, the Wizard and the Princess found time to rise from the ground and brush the dust off their pretty clothes. Then Ozma turned to the bushes and said:  \"The unhappy lot you now endure, my poor Imps, is due entirely to your naughty actions. You can no longer annoy harmless travelers and you must remain ugly bushes, covered with sharp thorns, until you repent of your bad ways and promise to be good Imps.\"  \"They can't help being good now, your Highness,\" said the Wizard, who was much pleased with his work, \"and the safest plan will be to allow them always to remain bushes.\"  But something must have been wrong with the Wizard's magic, or the creatures had magic of their own, for no sooner were the words spoken than the bushes began to move. At first they only waved their branches at the girl and little man, but pretty soon they began to slide over the ground, their roots dragging through the earth, and one pushed itself against the Wizard and pricked him so sharply with its thorns that he cried out: \"Ouch!\" and started to run away.  [Illustration]  Ozma followed, for the other bushes were trying to stick their thorns into her legs and one actually got so near her that it tore a great rent in her beautiful dress. The girl Princess could run, however, and she followed the fleeing Wizard until he tumbled head first over a log and rolled upon the ground. Then she sprang behind a tree and shouted: \"Quick! Transform them into something else.\"  The Wizard heard, but he was much confused by his fall. Grabbing from his bag the first magical tool he could find he transformed the bushes into three white pigs. That astonished the Imps. In the shape of pigs--fat, roly-poly and cute--they scampered off a little distance and sat down to think about their new condition.  Ozma drew a long breath and coming from behind the tree she said:  \"That is much better, Wiz, for such pigs as these must be quite harmless. No one need now fear the mischievous Imps.\"  \"I intended to transform them into mice,\" replied the Wizard, \"but in my excitement I worked the wrong magic. However, unless the horrid creatures behave themselves hereafter, they are liable to be killed and eaten. They would make good chops, sausages or roasts.\"  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  But the Imps were now angry and had no intention of behaving. As Ozma and the little Wizard turned to resume their journey, the three pigs rushed forward, dashed between their legs, and tripped them up, so that both lost their balance and toppled over, clinging to one another. As the Wizard tried to get up he was tripped again and fell across the back of the third pig, which carried him on a run far down the valley until it dumped the little man in the river. Ozma had been sprawled upon the ground but found she was not hurt, so she picked herself up and ran to the assistance of the Wizard, reaching him just as he was crawling out of the river, gasping for breath and dripping with water. The girl could not help laughing at his woeful appearance. But he had no sooner wiped the wet from his eyes than one of the impish pigs tripped him again and sent him into the river for a second bath. The pigs tried to trip Ozma, too, but she ran around a stump and so managed to keep out of their way. So the Wizard scrambled out of the water again and picked up a sharp stick to defend himself. Then he mumbled a magic mutter which instantly dried his clothes, after which he hurried to assist Ozma. The pigs were afraid of the sharp stick and kept away from it.  \"This won't do,\" said the Princess. \"We have accomplished nothing, for the pig Imps would annoy travelers as much as the real Imps. Transform them into something else, Wiz.\"  [Illustration]  The Wizard took time to think. Then he transformed the white pigs into three blue doves.  \"Doves,\" said he, \"are the most harmless things in the world.\"  But scarcely had he spoken when the doves flew at them and tried to peck out their eyes. When they endeavored to shield their eyes with their hands, two of the doves bit the Wizard's fingers and another caught the pretty pink ear of the Princess in its bill and gave it such a cruel tweak that she cried out in pain and threw her skirt over her head.  \"These birds are worse than pigs, Wizard,\" she called to her companion. \"Nothing is harmless that is animated by impudent anger or impertinent mischief. You must transform the Imps into something that is not alive.\"  The Wizard was pretty busy, just then, driving off the birds, but he managed to open his bag of magic and find a charm which instantly transformed the doves into three buttons. As they fell to the ground he picked them up and smiled with satisfaction. The tin button was Imp Olite, the brass button was Imp Udent and the lead button was Imp Ertinent. These buttons the Wizard placed in a little box which he put in his jacket pocket.  [Illustration]  \"Now,\" said he, \"the Imps cannot annoy travelers, for we shall carry them back with us to the Emerald City.\"  \"But we dare not use the buttons,\" said Ozma, smiling _once more_ now that the danger was over.  \"Why not?\" asked the Wizard. \"I intend to sew them upon my coat and watch them carefully. The spirits of the Imps are still in the buttons, and after a time they will repent and be sorry for their naughtiness. Then they will decide to be very good in the future. When they feel that way, the tin button will turn to silver and the brass to gold, while the lead button will become aluminum. I shall then restore them to their proper forms, changing their names to pretty names instead of the ugly ones they used to bear. Thereafter the three Imps will become good citizens of the Land of Oz and I think you will find they will prove faithful subjects of our beloved Princess Ozma.\"  [Illustration]  \"Ah, that is magic well"]]]
