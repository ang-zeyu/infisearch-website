They turned and saw the horse had stumbled and fallen. He tried to scramble to his feet before the onrush of the half-frozen earth and rock and snow could reach him, but it caught and whirled him away on its crest.  \"Father and Bill were thrown down with the shaking of the ground caused by the terrific slide, and several times they were almost sucked into the vortex caused by the overwhelming ever-growing stream. Had it not been for Mike who had heard the rumble and knew what it meant, both Bill and father would have been lost. But Mike threw out a rope that father caught and quickly wound about himself, while Bill clutched on to father's legs. Thus Mike dragged them up to the tree where he had bound himself. The horses are gone!\"  Mrs. Brewster seemed overcome at the recital of the awful ordeal the men had passed through, but Polly said encouragingly:  \"Don't take on so, mother! 'All's well that ends well' and father and Bill are safe, you know.\"  \"Oh, but this isn't all, Polly! Mike says when Grizzly starts an avalanche like that first one, the very force of its tearing away keeps on breaking away the ice-fields all around the peak. Another slide may come at any moment and pour down this side, you see. The men who had taken care of the horses when the others were fighting the fire were left stationed at the timber-line to watch. If they notice the faintest sign of another serious break on the peak, they are to signal a lookout left on the crest of this slope. And they in turn must warn Bill's son who was left sitting on top of this ledge. That is where Simms and Mike have gone now. There must have been a signal from Bill's boy to Simms.\"  Mrs. Brewster looked at her daughter to see if she could bear the rest of the story. Finding Polly as calm as she herself was, she continued:  \"Father said the experience Simms and he went through was mere child's play to what it might be should Grizzly loosen up and send down a slide on this side of the peak. Of course, the fire and smoke added to the horror on the other side, but the actual avalanche was not as tremendous because the slope was partly protected by the abrupt drop of thousands of feet from the peak to the valley, down which the greater flood must have rushed.  \"This side is on the direct down-slope from the peak, with nothing to break a snow-slide, or to carry off the bulk of the d√©bris.  \"This morning, when I rode up with Simms' party, we met two old trappers who were coming down. They had passed Old Grizzly Slide yesterday, and they said there must have been an awful thaw going on under the surface-ice of the Slide, as the yawning chasm where you discovered the crevice the other day was frightful. It made even their courageous spirits tremble at sight of it. But they turned again and rode up with us, as they said they could be useful to Bill. They are up on Top Notch now, scouting for the first symptoms of a slide.\"  Polly turned white as she heard the story, but she still had control of her voice, so she whispered: \"Why don't we-all start down-trail to-night? Why lose time cooking supper, and have the men up there watching for the trouble?\"  \"Mike says we are safer in this cave than on the trail. It is impossible to go down the Indian trail at night, and Top Notch Trail is bad enough in the daytime, so that in the dark it is forbidding. He says this cave is high enough up on the ledge and near enough to the crest to escape most of the drift. The trash will be swept clear over the entrance and down into the ravine, while any snow or ice that might lodge up on the ledge before the cave will soon melt again. Then we can get away, when all is over.\"  Polly said nothing, but she was thinking seriously. Mrs. Brewster was grateful that her daughter could bear such awesome news without a tremor. So the two completed the supper, and were ready to serve it, when Sam Brewster rode down the ledge.  \"Come on, Daddy! Just in time for a bowl of hot soup!\" called Polly, gayly waving a ladle.  Her mother admired the self-control the girl showed over any fear or danger, and followed the brave example set her. \"Yes, Sam, if Simms wants to chase a bear in the twilight, let him! You will do far better to enjoy the supper.\"  So they sat down to eat toasted bread and soup, while Polly talked vivaciously and caused many a laugh from the unsuspecting girls. As the meager supper was almost finished, however, Mr. Brewster mentioned in a casual tone: \"Girls, Ah expect John and his friends early to-morrow, you know. Mike is going down to meet them.\"  \"Oh, yes! And won't we have exciting adventures to tell him!\" exclaimed Anne, thinking only of John and his coming.  \"Mrs. Brewster is going down with Mike, to meet the boys. So we-all thought you gals would like to ride down, too, instead of sitting up in front of this cave all day and night,\" continued Mr. Brewster.  \"Why, how foolish! to kill the horses with all that climbing! Up to-day, down to-morrow, and up again the next day! No horse could stand that!\" declared Anne, amazed at her host's suggestion.  \"Well, Ah've been thinking you-all had best stay down, once you get there. This is no sort of life for women-folk, anyway. When John and Tom Latimer get here they can look after your mining interests better than you can yourselves.\"  \"But, Mr. Brewster, you haven't even seen the hole inside of that cave, where I followed after Polly the day we discovered the gold!\" exclaimed Eleanor, greatly disappointed in Polly's father.  \"Ah haven't had time, Nolla. What with the doings of the claim-jumpers and everything, Ah've had a full day. Besides, it looks as if we-all are going to have _some_ time up here, and Ah'd feel a heap easier if you women were safe at home.\"  \"Are there signs of other claim-jumpers coming up, Mr. Brewster?\" asked Eleanor, anxiously.  \"From what our scouts report, up on the Trail, we're going to have such a time, if we remain here, that we may not have another good opportunity to escape with our lives,\" returned the distracted man.  \"Oh dear me! Can't we start now? I never want to see any claim-jumpers again!\" cried Barbara, wringing her hands.  \"Keep quiet, Bob! We'll do just as Mr. Brewster says, but your whimpering won't help any,\" said Anne.  \"Well, girls, I'm so eager to see John again, that I'm willing to ride down with Mike and mother,\" said Polly, acting her part perfectly.  \"Oh, Polly! I don't want to go and leave the gold mine, but I want you to stay with me,\" cried Eleanor.  \"Goodness me, Nolla! Don't you s'pose we can ride up again when the danger blows over? A lot of good the mine would do either one of us if a dozen claim-jumpers put lead through us all at one time!\" laughed Polly, but feeling far from humorous.  \"I suppose I'll just _have_ to go, if all the rest of you do!\" cried Eleanor, stamping her foot angrily.  So, after much arguing and explaining, it was decided that every one should be ready to start down-trail at the earliest streak of daylight.  That night the girls and Mrs. Brewster slept on the pine-beds--or at least the city girls slept, while Polly and her mother rested even as they waited for the first warning call from the guard, who sat by the fire that was started to keep away the wild beasts.  The hours passed without any new signals, and at three o'clock Mike called out that he was ready to start. The girls demurred about getting up at that hour, but Polly was too energetic to give them any peace. So, shortly after three, the entire party started down Indian Trail, traveling as swiftly as possible.  \"Now see here! why do all you men come down, too? I thought it was only the womenfolk who had to get out of the way!\" exclaimed Eleanor, wonderingly.  \"If, any claim-jumpers are about to stake out our land up there who is there left to stop them?\" added Anne, suspiciously, when she saw the deep concern on every man's face as he rode single file down the path.  \"Wall, now, seem' as we-all are well along the way down, Ah may as well tell you-all: thar hain't goin' to be no danger of any claim-jumpers staking your land if Old Grizzly knows anything about it. Thar war a turrible avalanche yesterday and a leetle one at suppertime; it looks like-es-how anuther powerful one will hit the trail any moment. That's why we-all air runnin' away as fast as our hosses kin go,\" explained Bill.  \"Oh! Tell Mike to hurry!\" cried Barbara.  \"No fear but what we-all are as crazy to git down as you kin be, young leddy,\" said Bill, soothingly.  After four hours' hard traveling, the riders came to a small park where Mike said they could rest and cook their breakfast, and feed the horses. From a certain spot on the clearing on this mountain-side, the peak of Old Grizzly Slide could be seen opposite them, dazzling in the sunshine.  \"Well, the old rascal is still up there,\" declared Anne.  \"But you-all can't say how soon its skirts will whisk and send down the trash that always ruins a forest,\" added Bill.  Even as he spoke, a strange sight was presented to the group who were admiring the sparkling peak. A great mist seemed to rise suddenly from its pinnacle, spreading out and obscuring the sun for a time. Then an ominous rumble echoed along the crest, and rolled down the slopes. The mist was suddenly sucked down by some tremendous force, and then a mighty tremor shook the ground where the escaped riders stood.  The horses seemed to know instinctively that there was some upheaval of nature taking place, for they quivered along their sensitive nerves and nosed the air questioningly. Several of the highbred animals pulled at their halters and, with drawn-back lips, snapped viciously at the air as if to warn away the destruction.  \"Oh, oh! Will it hit us?\" wailed Barbara.  \"No, we are safe on this opposite up-trail now. But a few hours delay in getting away this morning"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25419"],["title","Polly and Eleanor (#6)"],["body","we would have been caught in the drift,\" said Sam Brewster, wiping beads of cold perspiration from his brow.  \"Daddy, you don't think that avalanche was on the side of our gold mine, do you?\" asked Polly, plaintively.  \"Pretty close to Choko's Find, Polly dear,\" said her father.  \"Humph! Gol' all gone dis time!\" added Mike, dramatically.  \"Oh no! don't say that, Mike!\" wailed Polly.  \"Not _our gold mine_!\" added Eleanor, with gasping breath.  \"Mebbe no! Mike t'ink yes.\"  There fell a silence at that, and each one looked at the other, while the same thought passed through their minds: \"If that slide buried Choko's Find again, where would they all have been had they remained in the cave?\"     CHAPTER IV  JOHN AND HIS FRIEND ARRIVE   Nothing could have been done to avert the catastrophe on Grizzly Slide, so the adventurers finished their breakfast in silence. Mrs. Brewster seemed the only one who appeared grateful for their safety. Doubtless, the others felt a certain _sense_ of thanks but they were so disturbed over the evident loss of the mine again, that it was paramount with them.  Having packed the camp dishes, Mike started on the trail again, silently followed by the rest. Not until they reached Bear Forks where the roads separated, was anything more said about the mine.  \"Jeb can accompany the ladies to Pebbly Pit, while Ah ride on to Oak Creek to meet the train that will bring John and his friends. It doesn't look as if we-all can use their knowledge now, but we may as well talk things over seeing that like-as-how they will have had the long trip here,\" ventured Mr. Brewster, thoughtfully.  \"We-all ought to make up a crowd to go up and try to find Haywuth's body. Mebbe it will show when the snow's melted from the slope,\" added Bill.  \"Sam, why don't you-all plan while on your ride to Oak Creek, to take Top Notch Trail the same time John and Tom take the expert up? The larger the party the less danger of accident, you know,\" suggested Mrs. Brewster.  \"Are we going with them, mother?\" Polly said, in a pleading tone.  \"No, indeed, child! Aren't you cured with what happened this time?\"  \"'Lightning never strikes in the same place twice,' Mrs. Brewster,\" said Eleanor, hopefully.  \"And you know, Maw, such a terrible slide has not occurred here-abouts in twenty years,\" quickly added Polly, dropping back into her ranch vernacular in her anxiety. \"It may be another twenty years before such another slide happens.\"  \"And we can get all the gold out of the cave that we need in a short time,\" Barbara reminded them.  This made the men laugh, as the girl's words showed how little she really understood the situation up on the peak.  \"Well, we can talk things over better when the boys are present to advise us. Meantime, you-all ride home and rest up. Ah'll bring the boys along about night-fall,\" said Mr. Brewster.  The inhabitants of Oak Creek had felt the trembling of the ground caused by the huge land-slide on Grizzly, and knowing that so many of their prominent citizens were there at the time, they were grouped about the public house anxiously talking over the chances for escape that might be had on the mountain-top.  At first sight of the returned men, a wild welcome rang out, not only from the families who feared their men-folks might never return, but also from the citizens who were genuinely glad to see Bill and his poss√©, and Simms and his boy, safely back.  After having had his hand shaken as if it were a pump-handle, Sam Brewster continued on to the station to await the train from Denver. As he sat on the edge of the horse-trough thinking over the recent thrilling experiences, he suddenly realized that if Polly had lost her mine again, she might also lose her desire to go away to school in the Fall. This seemed a happy thought, for he sat beaming at the old box-car until the whistle announced the over-due local.  Two handsome young men jumped from the rear platform the moment the train slowed down, and soon Mr. Brewster had one of them by both hands giving him a hearty welcome.  \"Now, Dad, try your muscle on Tom's arm. Mine has had enough for one day,\" laughed John, placing an arm affectionately over his father's shoulder.  With a young man on either side explaining why the expert was not with them, Sam Brewster walked down the street towards Simms' office. Both young men were eagerly talking so the older man had not told them about the avalanche.  \"I was saying to John, what a different town this will be the moment we begin operations on Polly's claim,\" said Tom Latimer.  \"As the train pulled in I tried to look at the station and streets through future glasses--seeing the rows of fine store-buildings and the thrift that always follows on the heels of a rich find,\" added John.  \"We'll drop in Simms' office, boys, as I have to borrow his horses. I came on to meet you without bringing any mounts,\" said Mr. Brewster.  Both young men laughed heartily at this admission, and Tom said teasingly: \"I suppose you were so excited over Polly's discovery of gold that you clean forgot we were city chaps who are not overfond of hiking over these trails.\"  Simms was talking to the coroner about the witnesses to the death of Bill's man, and the newly arrived young engineers heard him say: \"Sam Brewster was the other one who escaped that death.\"  \"What's he talking about, Dad?\" whispered John, anxiously, as he watched the officer take notes.  Then in as few words as possible, the boys were told all about the land-slide on Grizzly that had, most likely, buried Choko's Find under tons and tons of d√©bris--maybe, hid it completely again for all time.  They sat in Simms' office talking over the plans for the morrow when a large party was to go up Top Notch. As they sat arranging who would be the best men to take, John interrupted the conversation:  \"Isn't that Jeb riding along the road with two led horses?\"  \"Sure enough! Your mother must have remembered I had but one mount, and so Jeb was hurried here with extra horses for you,\" replied Mr. Brewster, running to the door and hailing his man.  On the way to Pebbly Pit, Tom rode alongside Mr. Brewster while John rode beside Jeb. The two latter riders had much to say to each other, for John had been Jeb's particular charge when the hired man first went to work at Pebbly Pit. Now John was a head taller than his erstwhile guardian, even if he was much the younger.  Jeb acted very morose and absentminded; instead of giving sensible replies to John's questions about the avalanche, he would mutter and say inconsequent things. Finally John said:  \"Well, it must have been a narrow escape, anyway.\"  \"That's just it, John. Ef Ah don't run away from Pebbly Pit she'll git me!\" returned Jeb, greatly troubled.  \"I'm talking about that land-slide--what do _you_ mean?\" laughed John, beginning to understand that Jeb was worried over something other than the Grizzly experience.  \"Wh--y--Ah'm meanin' that widder! It's leap-year, you know.\"  John had never heard about Sary, so he was unprepared to offer any advice, but he thought best to agree in everything with Jeb, concerning this particular one, and all \"widders\" in general.  \"Ye-es--siree! That Sary kin ketch any man she starts out to trap. Ef she laid eyes on enny of them farm-hands at Pebbly Pit, like-as-how she has on _me_, they'd roll right over and eat from her han's. But, you see, John, Ah ain't a marryin' man, so Ah wants to escape.\"  \"Jeb, I have a plan! Suppose we get Tom to flirt with Sary and then let her understand she is fickle, so that you won't consider her for a mate,\" whispered John, thinking of the fun he could have by playing this joke on his friend.  Jeb gave John a scornful look that meant volumes. \"D'ye think Sary would fall fer it? Ah tells you-all she ain't no fule. She kin see straight, an' she knows Tom Latimer ain't in her class.\"  Thus trying to plan for Jeb's peace and happiness, the two found they had reached the Rainbow Cliffs. Tom and Mr. Brewster were looking over the beautiful shining walls, and Tom sighed:  \"You wouldn't have to waste one regret on Polly's loss of the gold mine, if you would but consent to let us sell a bit of these walls.\"  \"_Ah'm_ not worryin' over her loss of gold, Tom; it's glad Ah am that it turned out so. Now she won't coax to go away to some big school where Ah can't see her for six months.\"  Tom Latimer turned about in the saddle and sent Sam Brewster a keen look and thought: \"_So that_ is why he won't consent to these stones being mined and sold!\"  Then the four men rode up the wide trail that ran from the Cliffs to the house where they found a group of girls and women eagerly awaiting them. Polly ran down the road and caught hold of her brother's stirrup in her impatience to welcome him. John laughed and jumped from his horse, then gave his sister the kiss and hug she expected.  Anne Stewart stood on the porch watching this little by-play, and when the brother and sister slowly walked along, arm linked in arm, she smiled and sighed, then turned to greet Tom Latimer. But she did not see Mrs. Brewster's watchful eye quickly turn away from her when _she_ turned from watching John.  As Tom Latimer was known to the Maynard girls and Anne, having met them at the College Prom the past year, he was warmly welcomed by them as well as by the Brewsters. Barbara felt an especial interest in him, as he was \"one of her set\" in society, and he had been invited to her home when her brother entertained a few of his college friends.  Polly now brought her brother up and introduced him to Eleanor and Barbara, but Anne was not there.  \"Wh-y--where did Anne go? She was here this minute?\" cried Polly, looking around in amazement.  Mrs. Brewster had seen Anne steal away and she understood the reason. Now she quickly diverted attention by saying: \"Of course you boys have heard about the awful land-slide?\"  As it was so recent an event, it instantly absorbed all. Then Mr. Brewster told about the plans to ride"]]]
