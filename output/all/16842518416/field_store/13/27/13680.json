Look at my face, toil-furrowed; look at my calloused hands;     Master, I've done Thy bidding, wrought in Thy many lands--     Wrought for the little masters, big-bellied they be, and rich;     I've done their desire for a daily hire, and I die like a dog in a           ditch.     I have used the strength Thou hast given, Thou knowest I did not shirk;     Threescore years of labour--Thine be the long day's work.     And now, Big Master, I'm broken and bent and twisted and scarred,     But I've held my job, and Thou knowest, and Thou wilt not judge me           hard.     Thou knowest my sins are many, and often I've played the fool--     Whiskey and cards and women, they made me the devil's tool.     I was just like a child with money: I flung it away with a curse,     Feasting a fawning parasite, or glutting a harlot's purse,     Then back to the woods repentant, back to the mill or the mine,     I, the worker of workers, everything in my line.     Everything hard but headwork (I'd no more brains than a kid),     A brute with brute strength to labour, doing as I was bid;     Living in camps with men-folk, a lonely and loveless life;     Never knew kiss of sweetheart, never caress of wife.     A brute with brute strength to labour, and they were so far above--     Yet I'd gladly have gone to the gallows for one little look of Love.     I with the strength of two men, savage and shy and wild--     Yet how I'd ha' treasured a woman, and the sweet, warm kiss of a child.     Well, 'tis Thy world, and Thou knowest. I blaspheme and my ways be           rude;     But I've lived my life as I found it, and I've done my best to be good;     I, the primitive toiler, half naked, and grimed to the eyes,     Sweating it deep in their ditches, swining it stark in their styes,     Hulling down forests before me, spanning tumultuous streams;     Down in the ditch building o'er me palaces fairer than dreams;     Boring the rock to the ore-bed, driving the road through the fen,     Resolute, dumb, uncomplaining, a man in a world of men.     Master, I've filled my contract, wrought in Thy many lands;     Not by my sins wilt Thou judge me, but by the work of my hands.     Master, I've done Thy bidding, and the light is low in the west,     And the long, long shift is over ... Master, I've earned it--Rest.     GRIN       If you're up against a bruiser and you're getting knocked about--                                                             Grin.     If you're feeling pretty groggy, and you're licked beyond a doubt--                                                             Grin.     Don't let him see you're funking, let him know with every clout,     Though your face is battered to a pulp, your blooming heart is stout;     Just stand upon your pins until the beggar knocks you out--                                                             And grin.      This life's a bally battle, and the same advice holds true,                                                             Of grin.     If you're up against it badly, then it's only one on you,                                                             So grin.     If the future's black as thunder, don't let people see you're blue;     Just cultivate a cast-iron smile of joy the whole day through;     If they call you \"Little Sunshine,\" wish that _they'd_ no troubles,           too--                                                             You may--grin.      Rise up in the morning with the will that, smooth or rough,                                                             You'll grin.     Sink to sleep at midnight, and although you're feeling tough,                                                             Yet grin.     There's nothing gained by whining, and you're not that kind of stuff;     You're a fighter from away back, and you _won't_ take a rebuff;     Your trouble is that you don't know when you have had enough--                                                             Don't give in.     If Fate should down you, just get up and take another cuff;     You may bank on it that there is no philosophy like bluff                                                             And grin.     THE SHOOTING OF DAN MCGREW       A bunch of the boys were whooping it up in the Malamute saloon;     The kid that handles the music-box was hitting a jag-time tune;     Back of the bar, in a solo game, sat Dangerous Dan McGrew,     And watching his luck was his light-o'-love, the lady that's known           as Lou.      When out of the night, which was fifty below, and into the din and           the glare,     There stumbled a miner fresh from the creeks, dog-dirty and loaded           for bear.     He looked like a man with a foot in the grave, and scarcely the           strength of a louse,     Yet he tilted a poke of dust on the bar, and he called for drinks           for the house.     There was none could place the stranger's face, though we searched           ourselves for a clue;     But we drank his health, and the last to drink was Dangerous Dan           McGrew.      There's men that somehow just grip your eyes, and hold them hard           like a spell;     And such was he, and he looked to me like a man who had lived in hell;     With a face most hair, and the dreary stare of a dog whose day is done,     As he watered the green stuff in his glass, and the drops fell one           by one.     Then I got to figgering who he was, and wondering what he'd do,     And I turned my head--and there watching him was the lady that's           known as Lou.      His eyes went rubbering round the room, and he seemed in a kind of           daze,     Till at last that old piano fell in the way of his wandering gaze.     The rag-time kid was having a drink; there was no one else on the           stool,     So the stranger stumbles across the room, and flops down there like           a fool.     In a buckskin shirt that was glazed with dirt he sat, and I saw him           sway;     Then he clutched the keys with his talon hands--my God! but that man           could play!      Were you ever out in the Great Alone, when the moon was awful clear,     And the icy mountains hemmed you in with a silence you most could           _hear_;     With only the howl of a timber wolf, and you camped there in the cold,     A half-dead thing in a stark, dead world, clean mad for the muck           called gold;     While high overhead, green, yellow, and red, the North Lights swept           in bars--     Then you've a haunch what the music meant ... hunger and night and           the stars.      And hunger not of the belly kind, that's banished with bacon and beans;     But the gnawing hunger of lonely men for a home and all that it means;     For a fireside far from the cares that are, four walls and a roof           above;     But oh! so cramful of cosy joy, and crowned with a woman's love;     A woman dearer than all the world, and true as Heaven is true--     (God! how ghastly she looks through her rouge,--the lady that's           known as Lou.)      Then on a sudden the music changed, so soft that you scarce could hear;     But you felt that your life had been looted clean of all that it           once held dear;     That some one had stolen the woman you loved; that her love was a           devil's lie;     That your guts were gone, and the best for you was to crawl away and           die.     'Twas the crowning cry of a heart's despair, and it thrilled you           through and through--     \"I guess I'll make it a spread misere,\" said Dangerous Dan McGrew.      The music almost died away ... then it burst like a pent-up flood;     And it seemed to say, \"Repay, repay,\" and my eyes were blind with           blood.     The thought came back of an ancient wrong, and it stung like a           frozen lash,     And the lust awoke to kill, to kill ... then the music stopped with           a crash,      And the stranger turned, and his eyes they burned in a most peculiar           way;     In a buckskin shirt that was glazed with dirt he sat, and I saw him           sway;     Then his lips went in in a kind of grin, and he spoke, and his voice           was calm;     And, \"Boys,\" says he, \"you don't know me, and none of you care a damn;     But I want to state, and my words are straight, and I'll bet my poke           they're true,     That one of you is a hound of hell ... and that one is Dan McGrew.\"      Then I ducked my head, and the lights went out, and two guns blazed           in the dark;     And a woman screamed, and the lights went up, and two men lay stiff           and stark;     Pitched on his head, and pumped full of lead, was Dangerous Dan McGrew,     While the man from the creeks lay clutched to the breast of the lady           that's known as Lou.      These are the simple facts of the case, and I guess I ought to know;     They say that the stranger was crazed with \"hooch,\" and I'm not           denying it's so.     I'm not so wise as the lawyer guys, but strictly between us two--     The woman that kissed him and--pinched his poke--was the lady that's           known as Lou.     THE CREMATION OF SAM MCGEE       _There are strange things done in the midnight sun       By the men who moil for gold;     The Arctic trails have their secret tales       That would make your blood run cold;     The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,       But the queerest they ever did see     Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge       I cremated Sam McGee._      Now Sam McGee was from Tennessee, where the cotton blooms and blows.     Why he left his home in the South to roam round the Pole God only           knows.     He was always cold, but the land of gold seemed to hold him like a           spell;     Though he'd often say in his homely way that he'd \"sooner live in           hell.\"      On a Christmas Day we were mushing our"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25546"],["title","Songs of a Sourdough (#4)"],["body"," over the Dawson trail.     Talk of your cold! through the parka's fold it stabbed like a driven           nail.     If our eyes we'd close, then the lashes froze, till sometimes we           couldn't see;     It wasn't much fun, but the only one to whimper was Sam McGee.      And that very night as we lay packed tight in our robes beneath the           snow,     And the dogs were fed, and the stars o'erhead were dancing heel and           toe,     He turned to me, and, \"Cap,\" says he, \"I'll cash in this trip, I guess;     And if I do, I'm asking that you won't refuse my last request.\"      Well, he seemed so low that I couldn't say no: then he says with a           sort of moan:     \"It's the cursèd cold, and it's got right hold till I'm chilled           clean through to the bone.     Yet 'taint being dead, it's my awful dread of the icy grave that pains:     So I want you to swear that, foul or fair, you'll cremate my last           remains.\"      A pal's last need is a thing to heed, so I swore I would not fail;     And we started on at the streak of dawn, but God! he looked ghastly           pale.     He crouched on the sleigh, and he raved all day of his home in           Tennessee;     And before nightfall a corpse was all that was left of Sam McGee.      There wasn't a breath in that land of death, and I hurried, horror           driven,     With a corpse half-hid that I couldn't get rid because of a promise           given;     It was lashed to the sleigh, and it seemed to say: \"You may tax your           brawn and brains,     But you promised true, and it's up to you to cremate those last           remains.\"      Now a promise made is a debt unpaid, and the trail has its own stern           code.     In the days to come, though my lips were dumb, in my heart how I           cursed that load.     In the long, long night, by the lone firelight, while the huskies,           round in a ring,     Howled out their woes to the homeless snows--O God! how I loathed           the thing!      And every day that quiet clay seemed to heavy and heavier grow;     And on I went, though the dogs were spent and the grub was getting low;     The trail was bad, and I felt half mad, but I swore I would not give           in;     And I'd often sing to the hateful thing, and it hearkened with a grin.      Till I came to the marge of Lake Lebarge, and a derelict there lay;     It was jammed in the ice, but I saw in a trice it was called the           \"Alice May.\"     And I looked at it, and I thought a bit, and I looked at my frozen           chum:     Then, \"Here,\" said I, with a sudden cry, \"is my cre-ma-tor-eum.\"      Some planks I tore from the cabin floor, and I lit the boiler fire;     Some coal I found that was lying around, and I heaped the fuel higher;     The flames just soared, and the furnace roared--such a blaze you           seldom see;     And I burrowed a hole in the glowing coal, and I stuffed in Sam McGee.      Then I made a hike, for I didn't like to hear him sizzle so;     And the heavens scowled, and the huskies howled, and the wind began           to blow.     It was icy cold, but the hot sweat rolled down my cheeks, and I           don't know why;     And the greasy smoke in an inky cloak went streaking down the sky.      I do not know how long in the snow I wrestled with grisly fear;     But the stars came out and they danced about ere again I ventured near;     I was sick with dread, but I bravely said: \"I'll just take a peep           inside.     I guess he's cooked, and it's time I looked,\" ... then the door I           opened wide.      And there sat Sam, looking cool and calm, in the heart of the           furnace roar;     And he wore a smile you could see a mile, and he said: \"Please close           that door.     It's fine in here, but I greatly fear you'll let in the cold and           storm--     Since I left Plumtree, down in Tennessee, it's the first time I've           been warm.\"      _There are strange things done in the midnight sun       By the men who moil for gold;     The Arctic trails have their secret tales       That would make your blood run cold;     The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,       But the queerest they ever did see     Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge       I cremated Sam McGee._     MY MADONNA       I haled me a woman from the street,       Shameless, but, oh, so fair!     I bade her sit in the model's seat,       And I painted her sitting there.          I hid all trace of her heart unclean;           I painted a babe at her breast;         I painted her as she might have been           If the Worst had been the Best.      She laughed at my picture, and went away.       Then came, with a knowing nod,     A connoisseur, and I heard him say:       \"'Tis Mary, the Mother of God.\"          So I painted a halo round her hair,           And I sold her, and took my fee,         And she hangs in the church of Saint Hilaire,           Where you and all may see.     UNFORGOTTEN       I know a garden where the lilies gleam,       And one who lingers in the sunshine there;       She is than white-stoled lily far more fair,     And oh, her eyes are heaven-lit with dream.          I know a garret, cold and dark and drear,           And one who toils and toils with tireless pen,           Until his brave, sad eyes grow weary--then         He seeks the stars, pale, silent as a seer.      And ah, it's strange, for desolate and dim       Between these two there rolls an ocean wide;       Yet he is in the garden by her side,     And she is in the garret there with him.     THE RECKONING       It's fine to have a blow-out in a fancy restaurant,     With terrapin and canvas-back and all the wine you want;     To enjoy the flowers and music, watch the pretty women pass,     Smoke a choice cigar, and sip the wealthy water in your glass;     It's bully in a high-toned joint to eat and drink your fill,     But it's quite another matter when you                                                   Pay the bill.      It's great to go out every night on fun or pleasure bent,     To wear your glad rags always, and to never save a cent;     To drift along regardless, have a good time every trip;     To hit the high spots sometimes, and to let your chances slip;     To know you're acting foolish, yet to go on fooling still,     Till Nature calls a show-down, and you                                                   Pay the bill.      Time has got a little bill--get wise while yet you may,     For the debit side's increasing in a most alarming way;     The things you had no right to do, the things you should have done,     They're all put down: it's up to you to pay for every one.     So eat, drink, and be merry, have a good time if you will,     But God help you when the time comes, and you                                                   Foot the bill.     QUATRAINS       One said: Thy life is thine to make or mar,     To flicker feebly, or to soar, a star;     It lies with thee--the choice is thine, is thine,     To hit the ties or drive thy auto-car.      I answer Her: The choice is mine--ah, no!     We all were made or marred long, long ago.     The parts are written: hear the super wail:     \"Who is stage-managing this cosmic show?\"      Blind fools of fate, and slaves of circumstance,     Life is a fiddler, and we all must dance.     From gloom where mocks that will-o'-wisp, Freewill,     I heard a voice cry: \"Say, give us a chance.\"      Chance! Oh, there is no chance. The scene is set.     Up with the curtain! Man, the marionette,     Resumes his part. The gods will work the wires.     They've got it all down fine, you bet, you bet!      It's all decreed: the mighty earthquake crash;     The countless constellations' wheel and flash;     The rise and fall of empires, war's red tide,     The composition of your dinner hash.      There's no haphazard in this world of ours:     Cause and effect are grim, relentless powers.     They rule the world. (A king was shot last night.     Last night I held the joker and both bowers.)      From out the mesh of fate our heads we thrust.     We can't do what we would, but what we must.     Heredity has got us in a cinch.     (Consoling thought, when you've been on a \"bust.\")      Hark to the song where spheral voices blend:     \"There's no beginning, never will be end.\"     It makes us nutty; hang the astral chimes!     The table's spread; come, let us dine, my friend.     THE MEN THAT DON'T FIT IN       There's a race of men that don't fit in,       A race that can't stay still;     So they break the hearts of kith and kin,       And they roam the world at will.     They range the field and they rove the flood,       And they climb the mountain's crest;     Theirs is the curse of the gipsy blood,       And they don't know how to rest.          If they just went straight they might go far;           They are strong and brave and true;         But they're always tired of the things that are,           And they want the strange and new.         They say: \"Could I find my proper groove,           What a deep mark I would make!\"         So they chop and change, and each fresh move           Is only a fresh mistake.      And each forgets, as he strips and runs,       With a brilliant, fitful pace,     It's the steady, quiet, plodding ones       Who win in the lifelong race.     And each forgets that his youth has fled,       Forgets that his prime is past,     Till he stands one day with a hope that's dead       In the glare of the truth at last.          He has failed, he has failed; he has missed his chance;           He has just done things by half.         Life's been a jolly good joke on him,           And now is the time to laugh.         Ha, ha! He is one of the Legion Lost;           He was never meant to win;         He's a rolling stone, and it's bred in the bone;           He's a man who won't fit in.     MUSIC IN THE BUSH    "]]]
