A STRANGE MISTAKE      114     THE TALE OF RUSTY WREN  I  A PLEASANT HOME   Now, Rusty Wren had found--and shown to his wife--a hollow apple tree and a hole in a fence-rail, either of which he thought would make a pleasant place in which to live.  But since the little couple were _house wrens_, Rusty's wife said she thought that they oughtn't to be so far from the farmhouse.  \"Why not build our nest behind one of the shutters?\" she suggested.  But Rusty shook his head quickly--and with decision.  \"That won't do,\" said he. \"Somebody might come to the window and close the shutter; and then our nest would fall to the ground. And if we happened to have six or eight eggs in it, you know you wouldn't like that very well.\"  Rusty's wife agreed with him on that point. But she still insisted that she wanted to live near the farmhouse; and she said that she expected her husband to find a good spot for their nest, for she certainly wasn't going to spend the summer in a hole in a fence-rail, or in an old apple tree, either.  Rusty Wren saw at once that there was no sense in arguing with her. If he wanted any peace, he knew that he might as well forget the old hollow apple tree and the hole in the fence-rail too. He had better forget them and resume his search for a home. So he gave his plump little cinnamon-colored body a shake and held his tail at even a higher angle than usual, just to show people that he was going to be the head of the house--when they should have one. Then with a flirt of his short, round wings he hurried over to Farmer Green's dooryard--after calling to his wife that he would come back and tell her if he had any luck.  Rusty Wren spent some busy moments about Farmer Green's buildings. And since he loved to be busy and was never so happy as when he had something important to do, he hopped and climbed and fluttered to his heart's content, looking into a hundred different holes and cracks and crannies.  But he didn't find a single one that suited him. Every place into which he peered was either too big or too little, or too high or too low; or it was where the rain would beat upon it; or maybe it was so situated that the cat could thrust her paw inside. Anyhow, every possible nook for a nest had some drawback. And Rusty was wondering what he could say to his wife, who was sure to be upset if her plans went wrong, when all at once he came upon the finest place for a house that he had ever seen. One quick look through the small round opening that led to it was enough.  He knew right away that his search was ended. So he hurried back to the orchard to find Mrs. Rusty and tell her the good news.  \"I've found the best spot for a house in all Pleasant Valley!\" he cried, as he dropped down beside her and hopped about in his excitement.  \"Is it in a good neighborhood?\" she inquired calmly.  \"Yes, indeed!\" he replied. \"It's in a tree close to Farmer Green's bedroom window.\"  \"A hole in a tree!\" she exclaimed somewhat doubtfully. \"Not an old squirrel's nest, I hope?\"  \"No, no!\" he assured her. \"It's not really _in_ a tree. It's nailed to a tree. Come with me and I'll show you.\"  At that the bustling little pair hastened toward the farmhouse. And, to Rusty's delight, the moment his wife saw what he had found she said at once that it was exactly the sort of house she had always hoped to have, some time.     II  JOHNNIE GREEN'S IDEA   It happened that just before Rusty Wren and his wife came to Pleasant Valley to look for a home, Johnnie Green had an idea.  He found the idea in the weekly paper which the letter-carrier left each Friday in the mail box at the crossroads. On the Children's Page Johnnie read a story about a pair of house wrens. And he learned then that an old tin can nailed to a tree makes exactly the sort of house that wrens like.  Well, Johnnie Green began at once to look for a tin can. He had made up his mind that he would try to coax a couple of those busy little songsters to nest near-by, where he could have fun watching them.  Not finding an _old_ tin can that suited him, Johnnie took a shiny maple syrup can, which his father said he might have. It seemed to him that it was just the kind he needed, for the only opening in it was a small round hole in the top, hardly bigger than a twenty-five-cent piece. (The story in the weekly paper said that the wrens' doorway should be as small as that, so that no ruffianly English sparrows could enter the house and disturb the little people that were to dwell there.)  Johnnie Green punched a few nail holes in the sides of the syrup can, because he thought that if _he_ lived in such a place, he would want plenty of fresh air. Then he nailed a board to the can. And next he nailed the board to a cherry tree close to the house.  After that Johnnie had nothing more to do but wait. And he had not waited two days before Rusty Wren discovered the bright tin can that was to be his summer home.  As soon as she saw it, Rusty's wife said that there must be kind people living in the farmhouse, or they never would have driven nails through a spick-and-span can just to make strangers happy.  Since their search was ended, the tiny pair began building their nest right then and there. In a surprisingly short time they had completely filled their new house with twigs. And as soon as they had done that much, in the center of the mass of twigs they built a nest of dried grasses, singing the merriest of songs while they worked.  Of course, Johnnie Green was delighted. All the time the lively little couple were at work upon their new home it was easy to find Johnnie. But it was hard to get him to do any errands, because he didn't want to stir from the dooryard, he was so interested in what was going on.  Farmer Green, too, seemed pleased. And though he didn't spend much time watching Mr. and Mrs. Rusty (he said that he had to work, the same as they), he remarked to Johnnie that he was glad to see that the newcomers were already paying rent for their house.  Johnnie Green looked puzzled.  \"Rent?\" he exclaimed. \"I don't understand.\"  \"Just hear them!\" his father replied. \"Isn't their singing pay enough for the use of a tin syrup can?\"  \"That's so!\" cried Johnnie. \"I never thought of that. Why, they've turned that can into a regular music-box!\"     III  THE ALARM CLOCK   All summer long Farmer Green rose while the world was still gray, before the sun climbed over the mountain to flood Pleasant Valley with his golden light.  One might think that Farmer Green would have had some trouble awaking so early in the morning. And perhaps he might have overslept now and then had he not had a never-failing alarm clock to arouse him.  It was not one of those man-made clocks, which go off with a deafening clatter and bring a startled body to his feet before he is really awake. No! Farmer Green had something much pleasanter than that; and it was not in his bedroom, either.  His alarm clock was in his dooryard, for it was Rusty Wren himself who always warned him that day was breaking and that it was time to get up and go to work.  Every morning, without fail, Rusty sang his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25824"],["title","The Tale of Rusty Wren (#1)"],["body","song right under Farmer Green's window. His musical trill, sounding very much like the brook that rippled its way down the side of Blue Mountain, always made Farmer Green feel glad that another day had come.  \"If that busy little chap is up----\" he often said, meaning Rusty Wren, of course--\"if he's up there's no reason why I should lie here and sleep.\"  And since everybody else in the house followed Farmer Green's custom of rising early, it happened that so small a bird as Rusty Wren aroused the whole household out of their beds.  To be sure, Johnnie Green--sitting up and rubbing his eyes sleepily--sometimes wished that Rusty would skip his dawn song once in a while. And he told his father at breakfast one day that since he was not a bird, he saw no reason why he should get up with the sun.  \"You needn't,\" said Farmer Green. \"But you know the old saying about 'early to bed and early to rise,' don't you?\"  Johnnie remembered that such habits were supposed to make one \"healthy, wealthy and wise.\" And since he hated to take medicine, and was trying to save enough money to buy him a gun, and disliked to be kept in after school for not knowing his lessons, he decided that perhaps it was just as well, after all, to follow Rusty Wren's example.  Now, Farmer Green spoke so often and so pleasantly of Rusty Wren, saying that nobody could want a better little alarm clock than he, that Rusty began to take a great deal of pride in his morning task of awakening the household. It could hardly be called a task, however, because Rusty thoroughly enjoyed singing, though when he sang--as when he did anything else--he put every ounce of his strength into the effort. With his head lifted as high as his short neck would permit, and his tail (which usually stuck pertly upwards) drooping downward, as if he had for the moment forgotten it, he poured forth his music with such fervor that his small body actually trembled.  You see, Rusty Wren never did things by halves. When he did anything he was never satisfied with less than his best.  And that was another reason why Farmer Green liked him.     IV  RUSTY IS JEALOUS   Before Rusty Wren came to live in Farmer Green's dooryard the family had been known to oversleep now and then. Working hard all day long as everybody did (except Johnnie Green, who played hard enough--goodness knows!), they slept very soundly at night. And two or three times every summer they were sure to rise late, just by accident.  Though such a mishap always annoyed Farmer Green, it never troubled either the hired man or Johnnie in the least. On the contrary, they seemed to enjoy those occasions. But with Rusty Wren to rouse them at dawn all that was changed. And Farmer Green remarked one day that one thing was certain; they would lose no time that summer by staying in bed too long.  That very afternoon he had to go to the village. And when he came home he brought several surprises with him.  Those surprises pleased Johnnie and his mother so much that when he went to bed that night Farmer Green felt even happier than was usual with him. He went to bed somewhat early because he said he had more work than ever to do the next day, on account of his having gone to the village.  But happy as he was that night, the following morning Farmer Green was quite out of sorts. For the whole family overslept. Not a soul awaked until the sun had been up at least an hour.  \"I don't understand----\" Farmer Green said at the breakfast table--\"I don't understand why I failed to hear that wren this morning. I must have been unusually sleepy.\"  The hired man helped himself to some more griddle-cakes and remarked that it was a pity. But somehow he did not _look_ sorry, in spite of what he said.  \"We'll go to bed early to-night,\" Farmer Green continued, \"so we'll be sure to wake up before sunrise.\"  And, strange to say, the next morning the very same accident happened again.  \"I don't see what's come over me,\" said Farmer Green. \"I don't hear that wren singing right under my window any more. I thought that maybe the cat had caught him. But there he is this very moment, on that limb!\"  Everybody said it certainly was odd, for the wren always sang as soon as it began to grow light.  Well, that night Farmer Green went to bed before dark, declaring that he must be up bright and early in the morning.  \"I wish that new clock I brought home day before yesterday was an alarm clock,\" he said. \"Then I wouldn't have to worry about waking up on time.... Anyhow, I ought to hear the wren again to-morrow morning.\"  But Farmer Green hoped in vain. Though the cat had not caught Rusty, and he had not moved away, either, he no longer sang beneath Farmer Green's window at dawn.  For three mornings he had gone to the orchard to trill his dawn song; and though they did not know the reason, that was why the Green family rose late for three mornings running.  Once Rusty Wren had been proud to be called Farmer Green's alarm clock. But now something had happened that made him resolve to stop waking the household.  It was all on account of one of those surprises that Farmer Green had brought home from the village. For without intending to do any such thing, Farmer Green had surprised Rusty Wren as well as Johnnie and his mother.  Now, a surprise may be one of two kinds--pleasant or unpleasant. And, strangely enough, the very thing that delighted the Green family sent Rusty Wren into a spasm of jealous rage.  Of course, it was very silly of him to lose his temper. But he was too upset to stop to think of that.     V  THE NEW BIRD   Farmer Green had not been home long, after his trip to the village, when Rusty Wren heard a sound that for once made him keep quite still for at least five seconds.  \"Cuckoo! cuckoo!\" The cry came from inside the farmhouse. And since the windows were wide open, Rusty could easily hear it from the tree near-by, where he lived.  \"There's a new bird in there!\" Rusty Wren exclaimed to himself as soon as the sound reached his ears. He listened intently. But the call was not repeated.  \"Farmer Green is not satisfied with my singing!\" Rusty cried. And thereupon he flew into such a rage that when his wife came home, a few minutes later, she was actually frightened.  \"What in the world is the matter?\" she asked her husband anxiously.  \"Matter?\" cried Rusty Wren. \"Here I've sung my best for Farmer Green all summer, and waked him at dawn every morning without fail! And what do you suppose he's done? He has brought home a strange bird from the village, because he doesn't care for my singing.\"  Mrs. Rusty Wren told her husband that he must be mistaken.  \"Maybe a bird flew inside the farmhouse by accident,\" she said. \"What kind of bird is it?\" she inquired.  \"It _said_ 'Cuckoo!'\" Rusty explained. \"But if it's a cuckoo, it's different from any other I've ever heard. You know yourself that Black Bill Cuckoo who lives in the bushes beyond the orchard says '_Cow, cow!_'\"  \"I wouldn't worry, if I were you,\" Mrs. Rusty advised her husband. \"No doubt this strange bird has already made his escape.\"  It was then after sunset. And soon Rusty Wren's family were all fast asleep, without having heard any more bird notes from the farmhouse.  The next morning Rusty awoke just as the first streaks of gray showed in the east. He was about to begin his dawn song when through the kitchen window came that \"Cuckoo! cuckoo!\" again.  Rusty knew then that the strange bird was still there.  \"Did you hear that?\" he asked his wife.  She nodded her head silently.  \"He's telling Farmer Green that it's time to get up!\" Rusty exclaimed indignantly. \"And since Farmer Green has seen fit to get somebody else to wake him, I certainly shall not trouble myself on his account any more.\"  So Rusty Wren flew away to the orchard to sing his dawn song. Jolly Robin, who lived there, in an old apple tree, was surprised to hear Rusty Wren singing in that neighborhood so early. And he was still more astonished at Rusty's melody.  His voice was so much shriller than usual that Jolly Robin knew instantly that something had displeased him.  \"What's happened to upset you?\" Jolly Robin inquired, after Rusty had finished singing.  \"I expect to come here and give my dawn song every morning,\" Rusty remarked. \"And if there's anybody living in the orchard that objects, he had better move away at once.\"  Of course Jolly Robin didn't want to do that. And he said as much, too.  \"But I hope you'll sing a little more happily,\" he told Rusty, \"because I don't like to hear people complaining--and neither does my wife.\"         *       *       *       *       *  It is easy to understand why Farmer Green and his family overslept, when one knows that Rusty Wren no longer sang his dawn song beneath Farmer Green's window. And when Rusty saw that the whole household never stirred until long after sunrise, he was so pleased that he couldn't help making a few remarks about the new bird in the farmhouse, which had annoyed him so by singing \"Cuckoo! cuckoo!\"  \"This stranger is a very poor songster!\" Rusty said to his wife. \"All he can sing is 'Cuckoo! cuckoo!' in that silly way of his. He has no trills and runs and ripples at all! And he can't even repeat his song ten times a minute, as I give mine. He has to wait at least half an hour before he cries 'Cuckoo! cuckoo!' again. And no one but a simpleton would ever attempt to awaken a hard-working farmer by such half-hearted singing.\"  Mrs. Rusty quite agreed with her husband.  \"Farmer Green will be sorry he brought home such a worthless bird,\" she said.     VI  MR. CROW TO THE RESCUE   As time went on, and the Green family overslept each morning, Rusty began to grow very weary of the monotonous \"Cuckoo! cuckoo!\" which came every half hour, all day long, through the kitchen window of the farmhouse.  \"I'd like to know what sort of bird that is!\" he exclaimed at last. \"If he'd only come out here in the yard I'd ask him his name--and tell him what I think of him, too.\"  But"]]]
