But that's a singular coincidence. That's precisely the place where the first bullet went through my hat at Solferino. At Magenta--ah! I see him,\" added the captain, as he took a musket from the hands of one of his men. \"I'll bet another month's pay that reb has fired his last shot.\"  As he spoke, he raised the gun to his shoulder, and fired up into one of the trees. A crashing of boughs, a rattling of leaves followed; and a heavy body was heard to strike the ground.  \"You owe me a month's pay, Somers,\" continued Captain de Banyan, as he handed the musket back to the soldier.  \"I think not,\" replied the lieutenant, trying to be as cool as his companion. \"I never bet.\"  \"Just so. I forgot that you were an exceedingly proper young man.\"  The skirmish-line, which had paused a moment for an observation to be taken, now moved forward again. The rebel skirmishers were discovered, and the order was given to fire at will. The enemy's sharpshooters were posted in the trees, and they began to pour in a galling fire upon a portion of the line.  \"Steady, my men!\" said Somers, when the firing commenced. \"Gunpowder's expensive; don't waste it.\"  \"Not a single grain of it, Leftenant Somers,\" added Sergeant Hapgood.  \"There, uncle!--up in that tree!\" said Somers, pointing to a grayback, who was loading his rifle, about twenty feet from the ground.  \"I see him!\" replied the sergeant as he leveled his piece, and fired.  The rebel was wounded, but he did not come down; and the captain of the company ordered his men to move forward. From the thunder of the artillery and the rattle of musketry, it was evident that heavy work was in progress on the right and left.  \"Forward, men!\" said Somers, repeating the order of Captain Benson.  The men were scattered along an irregular line, and firing into the bushes, which partially concealed the rebel skirmishers. Somers's platoon advanced a little more rapidly than the rest of the line, being favored with a few rods of dry ground. He had urged them forward for the purpose of dislodging three sharpshooters perched in a large tree.  \"Come down, rebs!\" shouted Somers, as he reached the foot of the tree, and told half a dozen of his men to point their guns towards them.  \"What d'ye say, Yank?\" demanded one of them.  \"Will you come down head first, or feet first? Take your choice quick!\" replied the lieutenant.  \"As you seem to be in arnest, we'll come down the nateral way.\"  They did come down without a more pressing invitation, and were disarmed, ready to be sent to the rear.     CHAPTER VI  THE REBEL SHARPSHOOTERS   \"Lieutenant Somers, I don't think I can stand it much longer,\" said Phineas Deane, a private, who had joined the regiment a few days before the battle, as he saluted his officer.  \"Can't stand what?\"  \"The fact on't is, lieutenant, I'm sick. I haven't felt well for two or three days. I come out here to fight for my country, and I want to do some good. I might help take them prisoners back, if you say so.\"  \"Sick, are you? What's the matter?\"  \"I've got a bad pain in the bowels,\" replied Phineas, as he placed himself on the right side of a tree, and glanced uneasily in the direction of the rebel skirmish line. \"I'm subject to sich turns, but allus git over 'em if I have a chance to lay down for a few hours.\"  \"Oh, well, you can lie down here!\" added Somers, who understood the case pretty well.  \"What! down here in the mud and water? Wal, that would be rather steep for a sick man,\" said Phineas, with a ghastly smile, as he glanced again towards the enemy.  \"I will get some medicine for you. Here, uncle, let me have one of your powders,\" continued the lieutenant, addressing old Hapgood.  \"Sartin; they've done me heaps of good, and I'm sure they're just the thing for that man.\"  Somers took one of the powders, and opened the paper.  \"Now, my man, open your mouth, and let me give you this medicine,\" he added.  \"What kind of medicine is it?\"  \"It'll make you kinder sick to the stomach; but it'll cure you in less'n half an hour.\"  \"Well, lieutenant, I don't know as I want to take any medicine,\" answered poor Phineas, who was not prepared for this active treatment; though he would have taken it quick enough if he could be sent to the rear. \"I guess I don't keer about takin' on it.\"  \"You needn't, if you don't want to get well.\"  \"I only want to go back to camp, and lay down for a spell.\"  \"We can't spare you just yet, Phineas; but, if you don't stir yourself, you will lie down here somewhere, and never get up again,\" added Somers, as a shower of bullets passed over their heads. \"Forward, boys!\"  The captain detailed a couple of men to conduct the prisoners to the rear, and the company pressed forward. The rebel sharpshooters were dislodged from the trees; a few prisoners were captured; but the heavy fighting and the heavy losses fell upon other portions of the line. The rebels had been forced back, and the movement seemed to be a success. Half the regiment moved out of the woods, while the rest remained under the trees; when a halt was ordered. Somers found himself near an old house, behind which a number of rebel sharpshooters had concealed themselves for the purpose of picking off the Union soldiers.  The firing in the immediate vicinity had diminished, though the din of battle resounded on both sides. The boys were rather nervous, as men are when standing idle under fire; but it was the nervousness of restrained enthusiasm, not of fear, unless it was in the case of invalid Phineas, and a very few others whose physical health had not been completely established.  \"Well, Somers, my dear boy, how do you get on?\" asked Captain de Banyan, as he sauntered leisurely up to the lieutenant, whose command stood next to his own.  \"First-rate; only I should like to have something a little more active than standing here.\"  \"It takes considerable experience to enable a man to stand still under fire. When I was at the battle of Alma, I learned that lesson to a charm. We stood up for forty-two hours under a fierce fire of grape and canister, to say nothing of musketry.\"  \"Forty-two hours!\" exclaimed Somers. \"I should think you would all have been killed off before that time.\"  \"In our regiment, only one man was killed; and he got asleep, and walked in his dreams over towards the enemy's line.\"  \"Captain, you can tell a bigger story than any other man in the army,\" said Somers, laughing.  \"That's because I have seen more of the world. When you have been about as much as I have, you will know more about it.\"  \"No doubt of it.\"  \"I should be very happy to be more actively employed just now; but I am very well contented where I am.\"  The position they occupied enabled the two officers to see some sharp fighting along the line. Through an opening at the right, they saw a rebel regiment, wearing white jackets, or else stripped to their shirts, march at double-quick, in splendid order, with arms at \"right shoulder shift,\" to the scene of action. It was probably some volunteer body from Richmond, whom the ladies of the rebel capital had just dismissed, with sweet benedictions, to sweep the \"foul Yankees\" from the face of the earth. They were certainly a splendid body of men; and the ladies might well be proud of them. They went into the field in good style, with the blessings of the fair still lingering fondly in their ears. But one volley from the veterans of the Army of the Potomac was enough for them, and they gave way, running off the field in wild disorder, threading their way in terror through the bushes, every man for himself. It is not likely that they were welcomed back from the gory field by the frothy feminine rebels of Richmond.  \"That's just the way the Russians ran at Palestro!\" exclaimed Captain de Banyan, as he watched the exciting scene.  \"The Russians at Palestro!\" added Somers, \"I think you have got things a little mixed, captain.\"  Before this difficult question could be settled, Captain de Banyan was ordered to take a sufficient force, and drive out the rebels who were skulking behind the old house.  \"Somers, you shall go with me,\" said he, when he had received his orders from the colonel. \"We'll do a big thing, if there is any chance.\"  \"I am ready for anything, big or little, captain,\" replied Somers heartily. \"What shall I do?\"  \"March your men over by that little knoll, and come round on the other side of the house; I will move up in another direction, and we will bag the whole squad. But mind you, Somers, the enemy are round that way; don't let them gobble you up or lay you out.\"  \"I will do the best I can, captain.\"  \"Angels could do no more.\"  The lieutenant advanced, with the men detailed for the purpose, towards the hillock. By taking a circuitous route, he avoided the observation of the rebels behind the house, and reached the other side of the knoll, where, behind the friendly shelter of a clump of bushes, he was enabled to survey the ground. Not more than a quarter of a mile distant he discovered the rebel breastworks. It was about the same distance to the house.  Between the knoll and the house there was a small patch of wheat, which, by some chance, had escaped the havoc of foraging parties. Though the grain was not full-grown, it would afford concealment to his men. In order to reach it, he must expose his men to a volley from the rifle-pits, or from any body of rebels which might be posted in the vicinity. He could not afford to lose a single man, and he was perplexed to determine how he should overcome the distance between the wheat-field and the knoll.  It seemed to him very singular that he had not already been fired upon; and he concluded that it was because his party had been mistaken for rebels, or because some of their troops were between him and the Union lines. Whether the enemy had been deceived or not, he was fully"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25886"],["title","The Young Lieutenant; or, The Adventures of an Army Officer (#7)"],["body","to afford them no further information in regard to his politics, if any of them had seen him. He therefore ordered his men to take off their coats, which some of them had done before they started on the expedition. The blue trousers could not be so easily disposed of; but as some of the boys had straw hats, some felt, and some caps, it would have been hard to determine what they were at the distance of a quarter of a mile, especially as some of the Confederates wore the plundered clothing of the Union army.  After instructing his force in regard to their future conduct, he marched them boldly into the open space. To assist the deception, he directed one of his men to halt occasionally, and point his musket in the direction of the Union pickets. Not a shot was fired at them; and when the young lieutenant reached the wheat-field he fancied that he was clever enough for any brigadier in the rebel army.  It was desirable that the rebel sharpshooters at the house should not be alarmed; and, when his men reached the grain, Somers ordered them to get down upon their hands and knees, and creep cautiously towards the point to be assailed. The lieutenant, like a good officer, led the way himself, and had advanced about half the distance to be accomplished, when he heard a rustling noise in the grain before him. It was an ominous sound, and he paused to take an observation. He could not see anything without standing up; and, as he was within twenty rods of the house, it was necessary to avoid exposing himself.  From whatever source the sounds proceeded, it was just as safe to advance as it was to retreat; and he decided to go forward. With the utmost caution, he continued to creep along through the wheat; but he was careful to assure himself that his men's muskets and his own revolver were in condition for instant use. After he had gone a few rods farther, the sounds were more apparent; and, with no little consternation, he heard voices, rich with an unmistakable Southern accent.  \"I tell you, more of our fellers is coming through the grain. You mought hear 'em, ef you weren't deafer'n a dead nigger.\"  \"I heerd 'em. You kin bet yer life they're some of our pickets. Howsomever, I'm gwine to see.\"  \"Hush, my men! don't speak a word!\" whispered the young lieutenant. \"Lie flat on the ground.\"  The rebels were nearer than he had supposed; for, as he turned from his men, he discovered a wiry grayback, with the chevrons of a sergeant on his arms, trying to stare him out of countenance. The fellow did not look wholesome; and Somers was in doubt whether to blow his brains out, or let things take their natural course.  \"Who mought you be?\" demanded the grayback, exhibiting more curiosity than of fear in his dirty face.  \"One of the people,\" replied Somers, disposed to avoid a direct issue. \"Who are you?\"  \"I'm one of the people too,\" grinned the rebel.  \"I see you are; and I suppose you belong to the army, don't you?\"  \"Bet your life I do.\"  \"Of course you won't object to telling me which army you belong to, as there may be some difference of opinion between us.\"  \"'Tain't no use to ask a officer dressed in blue, and lookin' as spruce as you be, whar he kim from. I say, Yank, what are you uns doin' in hyar?\"  \"Only taking a look.\"  \"You're as civil as a Mobile dancin'-master; and I axes yer, very perlite, to surrender.\"  \"How many men have you got, reb?\" demanded the lieutenant, as he put his hand on his revolver.  \"See hyar, Yank; play fair. You uns allers cheat playin' poker. Don't tech yer shooter yet,\" replied the grayback coolly, as he thrust the muzzle of his gun in the lieutenant's face. \"Two kin play at that game, and your wife or mine will be a lone widder quicker'n a coon kin wink at the moon. I've got seven men,\" he added.  \"I have twenty-three,\" said Somers.  \"Then yer kin whip us if yer be Yanks; for three of you uns can just lick one of we uns.\"  \"That's good logic. Will you surrender, or fight?\" demanded Somers.  \"Let me count your men. I surrender,\" he continued, after he had stood up, and counted the Union soldiers. \"Here's my shooter; fair play, even with Yanks.\"  Leaving a guard of eight men with his prisoners when they were disarmed, Somers hastened forward to complete his mission.     CHAPTER VII  AN EXPEDITION IN FRONT   The affair in the wheat-field had been conducted very quietly, and apparently had not attracted the attention of any of the rebels in the vicinity. During the brief parley, the thunder of the battle had sounded on the right and left of the parties. The enemy were in force in their works, and it was believed that there were squads of pickets in every place of concealment which the ground afforded.  Somers was very much surprised to find that he was not molested, and made all possible haste to carry out the programme with which he had been intrusted by Captain de Banyan. Followed by the balance of his men, he crept carefully towards the house till he had reached the end of the grain-field. He could see about a dozen rebels skulking behind the building, all of them so intent upon getting a shot at the Union soldiers, that they paid no attention to the events transpiring in the rear of them; probably deeming it impossible for an enemy to approach in that direction.  The lieutenant had but fifteen men left to execute his part of the scheme, and there seemed to be double that number of graybacks lurking in and about the house. Everything depended upon his effecting the requisite junction with the force of the captain. As his superior had but a short distance to march, it was probable that he was already in position to support him; and he decided to make the attack without permitting any delay to rob him of the chances of success.  \"Now, double-quick, forward!\" shouted Somers, as he rose from the ground, and led the way to a position where he could intercept the retreat of the rebels.  Agreeably to the instructions previously given, his men stretched out into an extended line, and commenced firing at will upon the luckless graybacks who were in sight. It did not take them long to find out that they were assailed by a fire in the rear.  \"Surrender!\" shouted Captain de Banyan, who at this moment appeared at the head of his men.  The rebels were not disposed to accept this polite invitation, but began to fall back from the house in good order. They discharged their pieces at the force in front, and then started at a run to effect their escape in the opposite direction. They forgot for the moment that they had been fired upon from the rear, or else thought that the fire had been directed by some of their own people at the Yankees who had so suddenly attacked in front.  \"Surrender!\" shouted Lieutenant Somers, as the retreating rebels approached his line.  They halted at this unexpected summons. The officer in command of them took a hasty survey of the situation, and then ordered his troops to cut their way through the thin line between them and the rebel field-works. The commander of the rebel pickets was a gallant fellow; and, drawing his sword, he rushed towards the spot where the lieutenant was stationed. Discharging his pistol with the left hand at Somers, he dashed forward like a festive horse.  Both parties had discharged their guns, and there was no time to reload them. Some of the rebels had bayonets, and some had not; and, with the fury of their brave leader, they attempted to break their way through the line. A sharp but very irregular conflict ensued, the rebels clubbing their muskets or grappling with the Union soldiers, each according to his individual taste. As they were two to one of the Federals, they would certainly have won the field if Captain de Banyan had not promptly come to the rescue.  The excited rebel officer manifested a most persistent desire to revenge his misfortunes upon Lieutenant Somers. After he had fired his pistol twice, and one of the balls had passed through his opponent's cap, the latter, by a sudden dash, knocked the weapon from his hand with his sword. He then attempted to use his own sword, and, if Somers had not been a \"master of fence,\" would probably have run him through the body. Some hard blows were struck with these weapons, and the age of chivalry, when men fought hand to hand with trusty blades, seemed to be revived. But the sword of the rebel officer was not so trusty as it ought to have been. It was not a regulation sword; and, while its owner was flourishing it most valiantly, the blade flew away from the handle.  \"Now, surrender!\" said Somers, out of breath with the violence of his exertions, as he drew from his belt the pistol which, being so hard pressed, he had not been able to use before.  \"Never, sir! I don't surrender! I was sent here to fight, and not to surrender!\" replied the officer, as proudly as though he had been in command of a beleaguered fortress, instead of a squad of two or three dozen men.  Somers had him at his mercy, and it seemed but little better than murder to shoot him in his defenseless state.  That was a bad mistake on his part; for the rebel officer at once proceeded to prove that he was no effeminate character, who depended upon a sword, pistol, or other weapon, to fight his battles with, but could, if occasion required, defend himself with his naked arm. He sprang upon Somers with the ferocity of a tiger. The latter fired; but the sudden movement of the former impaired his aim, and the ball whistled harmlessly over the head of the rebel. The desperate officer attempted to gain possession of the pistol; but Somers, now thoroughly aroused to a sense of his own danger, sprang at the throat of his antagonist, and, by the fierceness of the dash, bore him to the earth. His victim struggled to escape; and, being a stronger man than the other, would certainly have succeeded, if Somers had not picked up his pistol, which lay on the spot where they fell, and struck a blow with the butt of it on the temple of the rebel.
