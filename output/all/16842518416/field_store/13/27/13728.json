The Confederate soldier fought the cries of distress which came from his home,--tales of woe, want, insult, and robbery. He fought men who knew that _their_ homes (when they had any) were safe, their wives and children, their parents and sisters, sheltered, and their business affairs more than usually prosperous; who could draw sight drafts, have them honored, and make the camp table as bountiful and luxurious as that of a New York hotel. He fought a government founded by the genius of his fathers, which derived its strength from principles they formulated, and which persuaded its soldiers that they were the champions of the constitutional liberty which they were marching to invade, and eventually to destroy.  The relative strength of armies becomes a matter of secondary importance when these facts are considered. The disparity of numbers only, would never have produced the result which the combination of these various forces did,--the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia.  The Confederate soldier was purely patriotic. He foresaw clearly, and deliberately chose, the trials which he endured. He was an individual who could not become the indefinite portion of a mass, but fought for himself, on his own account. He was a self-sacrificing hero, but did not claim that distinction or any merit, feeling only that he was in the line of duty to self, country, and God. He fought for a principle, and needed neither driving nor urging, but was eager and determined to fight. He was not a politic man, but a man under fervent feeling, forgetful of the possibilities and calamities of war, pressing his claims to the rights of humanity.  The Confederate soldier was a monomaniac for four years. His mania was, the independence of the Confederates States of America, secured by force of arms.  The Confederate soldier was a venerable old man, a youth, a child, a preacher, a farmer, merchant, student, statesman, orator, father, brother, husband, son,--the wonder of the world, the terror of his foes!  If the peace of this country can only be preserved by forgetting the Confederate soldier's deeds and his claims upon the South, the blessing is too dearly bought. We have sworn to be grateful to him. Dying, his head pillowed on the bosom of his mother, Virginia, he heard that his name would be honored.  When we fill up, hurriedly, the bloody chasm opened by war, we should be careful that we do not bury therein many noble deeds, some tender memories, some grand examples, and some hearty promises washed with tears.  The following letter, written by an aged father to his only son, then a mere boy, who had volunteered as an infantry soldier and was already in the field, is an appropriate conclusion to this chapter; showing admirably well the kind of inspiration which went from Southern homes to Southern soldiers:--     AT HOME, _July 17, 1861_.     MY DEAR SON,--It may have seemed strange to you that a    professing Christian father so freely gave you, a Christian son, to    enlist in the volunteer service. My reason was that I regarded this    as a _purely defensive war_. Not only did the Southern Confederacy    propose to adjust the pending difficulties by peaceful and equitable    negotiations, but Virginia used again and again the most earnest and    noble efforts to prevent a resort to the sword. These overtures    having been proudly spurned, and our beloved South having been    threatened with invasion and subjugation, it seemed to me that    nothing was left us but stern resistance, or abject submission, to    unconstitutional power. A brave and generous people could not for a    moment hesitate between such alternatives. A war in defense of our    homes and firesides, of our wives and children, of all that makes    life worth possessing, is the result. While I most deeply deplored    the necessity for the sacrifice, I could not but rejoice that I had a    son to offer to the service of the country, and if I had a dozen, _I    would most freely give them all_. As you are now cheerfully enduring    the hardships of the camp, I know you will listen to a father's    suggestions touching the duties of your new mode of life.     1. Take special care of your health. More soldiers die of disease    than in battle. A thin piece of damp sponge in the crown of your hat    during exposure to the hot sun, the use of thick shoes and a    water-proof coat in rainy weather, the practice of drinking cold    water when you are very warm as slowly as you sip hot tea, the    thorough mastication of your food, the avoiding of damp tents and    damp grounds during sleep, and frequent ablutions of your person are    all the hints I can give you on this point. Should you need anything    that I can supply, let me hear from you. I will do what I can to make    you comfortable. After all, you must learn to endure hardness as a    good soldier. Having never slept a single night in your whole life    except in a pleasant bed, and never known a scarcity of good food,    you doubtless find the ways of the camp rough; but never mind. The    war, I trust, will soon be over, and then the remembrance of your    hardships will sweeten the joy of peace.     2. The rules of war require prompt and unquestioning obedience. You    may sometimes think the command arbitrary and the officer    supercilious, but _it is yours to obey_. An undisciplined army is a    curse to its friends and a derision to its foes. Give your whole    influence, therefore, to the maintenance of lawful authority and of    strict order. Let your superiors feel assured that whatever they    entrust to _you_ will be faithfully done. Composed of such soldiers,    and led by skillful and brave commanders, our army, by the blessing    of God, will never be defeated. It is, moreover, engaged in a holy    cause, and must triumph.     3. Try to maintain your Christian profession among your comrades. I    need not caution you against strong drink as useless and hurtful, nor    against profanity, so common among soldiers. Both these practices you    abhor. Aim to take at once a decided stand for God. If practicable    have prayers regularly in your tent, or unite with your    fellow-disciples in prayer-meetings in the camp. Should preaching be    accessible, always be a hearer. Let the world know that you are a    Christian. Read a chapter in the New Testament, which your mother    gave you, every morning and evening, when you can, and engage in    secret prayer to God for his holy Spirit to guide and sustain you. I    would rather hear of your death than of the shipwreck of your faith    and good conscience.     4. As you will come into habitual contact with men of every grade,    make special associates only of those whose influence on your    character is felt to be good. Some men love to tell extravagant    stories, to indulge in vulgar wit, to exult in a swaggering carriage,    to pride themselves on their coarse manners, to boast of their    heroism, and to give utterance to feelings of revenge against the    enemy. All this is injurious to young and impressible minds. If you    admire such things, you will insensibly imitate them, and imitation    will work gradual but certain detriment to your character. Other men    are refined without being affected. They can relax into occasional    pleasantries without violating modesty. They can be loyal to their    government without indulging private hatred against her foes. They    can be cool and brave in battle, and not be braggarts in the absence    of danger. Above all, they can be humble, spiritual, and active    Christians, and yet mingle in the stirring and perilous duties of    soldier-life. Let these be your companions and models. You will thus    return from the dangers of camp without a blemish on your name.     5. Should it be your lot to enter into an engagement with the enemy,    lift up your heart in secret ejaculations to the ever-present and    good Being, that He will protect you from sudden death, or if you    fall, that He will receive your departing spirit, cleansed in the    blood of Jesus, into His kingdom. It is better to trust in the Lord    than to put confidence in princes. Commit your eternal interests,    therefore, to the keeping of the Almighty Saviour. You should not,    even in the hour of deadly conflict, cherish personal rage against    the enemy, any more than an officer of the law hates the victim of    the law. How often does a victorious army tenderly care for the dead    and wounded of the vanquished. War is a tremendous scourge which    Providence sometimes uses to chastise proud and wicked nations. Both    parties must suffer, even though one may get the advantage. There is    no occasion then for adding to the intrinsic evils of the system the    odious feature of animosity to individuals. In the ranks of the foe    are thousands of plain men who do not understand the principles for    which we are struggling. They are deceived by artful demagogues into    a posture of hostility to those whom, knowing, they would love. It is    against such men that you may perhaps be arrayed, and the laws of war    do not forbid you to pity them even in the act of destroying them. It    is the more important that _we_ should exhibit a proper temper in    this unfortunate contest, because many professed Christians and    ministers of the gospel at the North are breathing out, in their very    prayers and sermons, threatenings and slaughter against us. Oh! how    painful that a gray-headed pastor should publicly exclaim, \"_I would    hang them as quick as I would shoot a mad dog!_\"     6. Providence has placed you in the midst of thoughtless and    unpardoned men. What a beautiful thing it would be if you could win    some of them to the Saviour. Will you not try? You will have many    opportunities of saying a word in season.

It    is not presumptuous for a young man kindly and meekly to commend the    gospel to his brother soldiers. The hardest of them will not repel a    gentle approach, made in private. And many of them would doubtless be    glad to have the subject introduced to them. They desire to hear of    Jesus, but they lack courage to inquire of his people. An unusually    large proportion of pious men have entered the army, and I trust they    will give a new complexion to military life. Let them search out each    other, and establish a fraternity among all the worshipers of God.    To interchange religious views and administer brotherly counsel will    be mutually edifying. \"He that watereth shall be watered also    himself.\"     And now, as a soldier has but little leisure, I will not occupy you    longer. Be assured that every morning and evening we remember you, at    the family altar, to our Father in Heaven. We pray for \"a speedy,    just, and honorable peace,\" and for the safe return of all the    volunteers to their loved homes. All the children speak often of    \"brother,\" and hear your letters read with intense interest. That God    Almighty may be your shield and your exceeding great reward, is the    constant prayer of your loving father.     CHAPTER II.  THE OUTFIT MODIFIED.   With the men who composed the Army of Northern Virginia will die the memory of those little things which made the Confederate soldier peculiarly what he was.  The historian who essays to write the \"grand movements\" will hardly stop to tell how the hungry private fried his bacon, baked his biscuit, and smoked his pipe; how he was changed from time to time by the necessities of the service, until the gentleman, the student, the merchant, the mechanic, and the farmer were merged into a perfect, all-enduring, never-tiring and invincible soldier. To preserve these little details, familiar to all soldiers, and by them not thought worthy of mention to others, because of their familiarity, but still dear to them and always the substance of their \"war talks,\" is the object of this book.  The volunteer of 1861 made extensive preparations for the field. Boots, he thought, were an absolute necessity, and the heavier the soles and longer the tops the better. His pants were stuffed inside the tops of his boots, of course. A double-breasted coat, heavily wadded, with two rows of big brass buttons and a long skirt, was considered comfortable. A small stiff cap, with a narrow brim, took the place of the comfortable \"felt,\" or the shining and towering tile worn in civil life.  [Illustration: THE OUTFIT OF 1861.]  Then over all was a huge overcoat, long and heavy, with a cape reaching nearly to the waist. On his back he strapped a knapsack containing a full stock of underwear, soap, towels, comb, brush, looking-glass, tooth-brush, paper and envelopes, pens, ink, pencils, blacking, photographs, smoking and chewing tobacco, pipes, twine string, and cotton strips for wounds and other emergencies, needles and thread, buttons, knife, fork, and spoon, and many other things as each man's idea of what he was to encounter varied. On the outside of the knapsack, solidly folded, were two great blankets and a rubber or oil-cloth. This knapsack, etc., weighed from fifteen to twenty-five pounds, sometimes even more. All seemed to think it was impossible to have on too many or too heavy clothes, or to have too many conveniences, and each had an idea that to be a good soldier he must be provided against every possible emergency.  In addition to the knapsack, each man had a haversack, more or less costly, some of cloth and some of fine morocco, and stored with provisions always, as though he expected any moment to receive orders to march across the Great Desert, and supply his own wants on the way. A canteen was considered indispensable, and at the outset it was thought prudent to keep it full of water. Many, expecting terrific hand-to-hand encounters, carried revolvers, and even bowie-knives. Merino shirts (and flannel) were thought to be the right thing, but experience demonstrated the contrary. Gloves were also thought to be very necessary and good things to have in winter time, the favorite style being buck gauntlets with long cuffs.  In addition to each man's private luggage, each mess, generally composed of from five to ten men, drawn together by similar tastes and associations, had _its_ outfit, consisting of a large camp chest containing skillet, frying pan, coffee boiler, bucket for lard, coffee box, salt box, sugar box, meal box, flour box, knives, forks, spoons, plates, cups, etc., etc. These chests were so large that eight or ten of them filled up an army wagon, and were so heavy that two strong men had all they could do to get one of them into the wagon. In addition to the chest each mess owned an axe, water bucket, and bread tray. Then the tents of each company, and little sheet-iron stoves, and stove pipe, and the trunks and valises of the company officers, made an immense pile of stuff, so that each company had a small wagon train of its own.  All thought money to be absolutely necessary, and for awhile rations were disdained and the mess supplied with the best that could be bought with the mess fund. Quite a large number had a \"boy\" along to do the cooking and washing. Think of it! a Confederate soldier with a body servant all his own, to bring him a drink of water, black his boots, dust his clothes, cook his corn bread and bacon, and put wood on his fire. Never was there fonder admiration than these darkies displayed for their masters. Their chief delight and glory was to praise the courage and good looks of \"Mahse Tom,\" and prophesy great things about his future. Many a ringing laugh and shout of fun originated in the queer remarks, shining countenance, and glistening teeth of this now forever departed character.  It is amusing to think of the follies of the early part of the war, as illustrated by the outfits of the volunteers. They were so heavily clad, and so burdened with all manner of things, that a march was torture, and the wagon trains were so immense in proportion to the number of troops, that it would have been impossible to guard them in an enemy's country. Subordinate officers thought themselves entitled to transportation for trunks, mattresses, and folding bedsteads, and the privates were as ridiculous in their demands.  Thus much by way of introduction. The change came rapidly, and stayed not until the transformation was complete. Nor was this change attributable alone to the orders of the general officers. The men soon learned the inconvenience and danger of so much luggage, and, as they became more experienced, they vied with each other in reducing themselves to light-marching trim.  Experience soon demonstrated that boots were not agreeable on a long march. They were heavy and irksome, and when the heels were worn a little one-sided, the wearer would find his ankle twisted nearly out of joint by every unevenness of the road. When thoroughly wet, it was a laborious undertaking to get them off, and worse to get them on in time to answer the morning roll-call. And so, good, strong brogues or brogans, with broad bottoms and big, flat heels, succeeded the boots, and were found much more comfortable and agreeable, easier put on and off, and altogether the more sensible.  A short-waisted and single-breasted jacket usurped the place of the long-tailed coat, and became universal. The enemy noticed this peculiarity, and called the Confederates gray jackets, which name was immediately transferred to those lively creatures which were the constant admirers and inseparable companions of the Boys in Gray and in Blue.  Caps were destined to hold out longer than some other uncomfortable things, but they finally yielded to the demands of comfort and common sense, and a good soft felt hat was worn instead. A man who has never been a soldier does not know, nor indeed can know, the amount of comfort there is in a good soft hat in camp, and how utterly useless is a \"soldier hat\" as they are generally made. Why the Prussians, with all their experience, wear their heavy, unyielding helmets, and the French their little caps, is a mystery to a Confederate who has enjoyed the comfort of an old slouch.  Overcoats an inexperienced man would think an absolute necessity for men exposed to the rigors of a northern Virginia winter, but they grew scarcer and scarcer; they were found to be a great inconvenience. The men came to the conclusion that the trouble of carrying them on hot days outweighed the comfort of having them when the cold day arrived. Besides they found that life in the open air hardened them to such an extent that changes in the temperature were not felt to any degree. Some clung to their overcoats to the last, but the majority got tired lugging them around, and either discarded them altogether, or trusted to capturing one about the time it would be needed. Nearly every overcoat in the army in the latter years was one of Uncle Sam's captured from his boys.  The knapsack vanished early in the struggle. It was inconvenient to \"change\" the underwear too often, and the disposition not to change grew, as the knapsack was found to gall the back and shoulders, and weary the man before half the march was accomplished. The better way was to dress out and out, and wear that outfit until the enemy's knapsacks, or the folks at home supplied a change. Certainly it did not pay to carry around clean clothes while waiting for the time to use them.  Very little washing was done, as a matter of course. Clothes once given up were parted with forever. There were good reasons for this: cold water would not cleanse them or destroy the vermin, and hot water was not always to be had. One blanket to each man was found to be as much as could be"]]]
