Come, get up, you black brute,\" noticing the big bulk of the Captain for the first time, and he hauled off and gave the skipper a hearty kick on the haunch.  Never was there a more surprised greaser in the whole ungainly length of California for this apparently gentle cow that he kicked, (not for the first time either) suddenly turned and grabbed him with a powerful hand before he could yell, though he was so frightened that he probably could not utter a squeak. Another hand got him by the throat.  \"Take me for a cow, did you, you bespangled Manuello?\" roared the Captain, and he waved the aforesaid Manuello about in his great grip as though he had been a rag.  \"No use killing the beggar, Captain,\" said the mate. \"Maybe he can tell us something.\" The Captain let the Mexican drop and he lay on the ground perfectly inert.  \"He won't be able to say much right away,\" said the Skipper.  It was now getting light, the first signs of dawn showing above the mountains. As the darkness was drawn away, they could see their position more clearly and there came the sounds of the morning from the direction of the ranch houses. The barking of dogs, the crowing of roosters, and the call of human voices.  \"I guess, lads, it's about time for us to have something to eat,\" said the Captain, \"because we have got to do some tall climbing today and I want to get an early start.\"  An expression of disgust showed itself on old Pete's face at the idea of more walking, which the Captain was quick to note.  \"How would you like to stay here, Old Bones, and look after Manuello?\" said the skipper. But Pete shook his head.  \"I'll stay by the ship, Cap'n,\" said the old fellow stoutly.  \"Durn my buttons,\" said the Captain, whose oaths were as mild as his actions were vicious, \"if you ain't a good old barnacle, Pete. I wouldn't think of leaving you in such company as this,\" and he gave the prostrate Mexican a shove with his foot. Manuello looked up at the Captain with an evil eye and a muttered curse.  This roused the fury of Captain Broom and he held him off from the ground as if he had been a rat, his jaws working ominously and a look in his eyes that made the Mexican shrivel.  Nothing was said, not even by the Skipper, and the others watched him fascinated as he glared at his victim, and even the iron composure of the saturnine mate seemed to be moved partially aside. The Mexican began to whimper and moan as his eyes shifted to avoid the terrible ones of the Captain. He was not suffering any special violence, but a strange tremor filled the soul of the Mexican, in the grip of the grizzled giant.  As the greaser began to cry, the Captain gave a roar of laughter and threw him aside upon the ground, about all the humanity he had shriveled out of him. He lay there absolutely without any power of motion in his body.  Just then the crew of the Sea Eagle became aware of the fact that a horned animal with big brown eyes was looking at them. All the farmer in the nature of Captain Broom came to the surface.  \"By Gum,\" he exclaimed, \"if here ain't a bovine cow looking at us. I ain't milked one for forty years, but I'm not afeard to try. 'Member, Pete, when we used to milk the cows back in old Connecticut on the farm. After working in the hay all day, I'd go down in the side hill pasture, that was so steep that you had to hold on with your toes and your teeth to keep from sliding down to the brook.\"  \"You bring it back to me just like it was a living picture,\" said Pete, his hard face softening under the gentle showers of memory.  \"Then I'd drive the black and white one that was breechy, and the red mooley, the yaller and white that gave the richest milk. I'd drive them into the stanchions in the old barn, with the ground floor stoned up on the side, where it was sunk into the hill.\"  \"But it was winter, Cap'n,\" said Pete, \"that it was interesting doing the chores,\" and he blew reminiscently on his fingers, \"snow two feet on the level and the sun a piece of blue ice in the sky. A condemned sight better place than Californey, where you don't feel no more alive than a enbalmed corpse.\"  The Captain began now a series of manoeuvres to get within range of one of the cows so that they might have fresh milk for breakfast. He managed it finally, and he certainly looked like a peaceful old farmer as with his gray head against a fat red cow's flank, he milked into a large tin cup. Pete selected a black mooley and soothed by the man's persuasive manner, she consented finally to give down a thin blue stream. But the saturnine mate was less successful as he knew much more about navigating a ship than he did about cows.  Finally after much awkward manoeuvring, he got a cow cornered and began operations upon the left side with the result that the cow landed upon him with her hoof and sent him sprawling on his back to the great delight of the Captain.  \"Hurt bad, Bill?\" inquired the Skipper with mock sympathy, \"I'm afeard that you will never make a farmer.\"  \"I never calkerlated to,\" replied the mate. \"It ain't my line of business.\"  \"Don't tell me that,\" said the Captain, \"I can see that for myself. Come up here and I'll give you a drink.\"  They had scarcely finished their simple breakfast when Jack Cales gave a sudden alarm.  \"Cap'n,\" he cried, \"I see two men legging it our way. They are making straight for the hill.\"  \"I guess they are coming to see why Manuello doesn't show up with the cows,\" remarked the Captain, \"we don't want to stir up this hen roost as we've got other chicken to fry. So we'll git.\"  \"Take the greaser?\" inquired Jack.  \"You and the mate fetch him,\" said the Captain.  Just as the two men were mounting the hill, the Captain and his crew made a swift sneak down the opposite slope, and were soon making their way through the bush towards the foot-hills. In a minute they heard the cries of the two men as they drove the herd of cows towards the home ranch for the morning milking. The sun had now risen above the eastern range just in front of them and was blazing down upon the plain and the sea beyond. There was something exhilarating in the air in spite of the heat.  \"We don't need the company of that greaser any further,\" said Captain Broom, after they had made some headway up a canyon back of the ranch buildings. So they took some rope grass, tough as manilla, and tied him firmly, and, after having gagged him, they left him to be found later by some of his countrymen.  Then they toiled steadily up the trail of the canyon, until about noon they reached a pocket in the canyon where there was a pool of clear water fed by an invisible spring. Coming to meet them were four boys riding up the trail on the other side of the range.     CHAPTER VIII  THE CAMP IN THE POCKET   Under the guidance of the Mexican dwarf, the four boys came at last to a halt. It seemed as if the canyon down which they had been riding had come to an end for there was a wall of rock directly in front of them.  \"Down there, Senor, is a pool of clear water,\" announced the Mexican.  \"Glad to hear it, Manuel,\" said Jim heartily.  \"Did you ever see a picture, Jim,\" put in Juarez significantly, \"of a pool where the thirsty animals have to come to drink and before they get their noses in the water the hunter shoots them?\"  But nothing of this dire nature happened and in a few minutes the famished animals were pumping the delicious water down their long, baked throats.  \"My Gracious, but that tastes good!\" cried Tom, drawing in a long, gasping breath, after he had been drinking steadily for about a minute. \"It makes my head swim.\"  \"I should think it would,\" said Jo, sarcastically, \"considering the amount you have drunk.\"  \"You weren't far behind,\" grumbled Tom. \"I thought that you were not going to leave enough for the horses.\"  \"I don't especially like this place to camp in,\" said Jim. \"We are not accustomed to get in a pocket like this. But it is too late to pull out tonight and the horses need a rest, so we will keep guard.\"  \"Better drown the brown rat first,\" remarked Juarez to Jim. But the latter only shook his head and laughed.  The camp was made about twenty feet east of the spring in a small grove of slender trees backed by a high wall of steep granite, down which poured a waterfall in the rainy season.  The fire was built upon a flat rock in the centre of the grove where there was no danger of it catching in the grass and bushes which were dry as tinder. If once a mountain fire was started at the end of the dry season there would be no stopping it until it had devastated the whole country.  The light of the fire showed the usual cheery and active scene that goes with making camp. How many times the Frontier Boys had gone through these preparations it is impossible to say. They had camped on the plains of Kansas, in the mountains of Colorado, on the Mesas of New Mexico, the banks of the Colorado river, and the Pampas of Mexico. Now we find them in the coast range of California.  It was not an especially dangerous country in which they were camped, nothing to compare with parts of Colorado and Mexico, but never were they in greater danger than at the present moment and this camp promised to be their last together, except they had unusual luck.  There was a traitor in the company, and even now four pairs of hostile eyes were watching them as they moved in the light of the fire. The Captain of the Sea Eagle and his three trusty men were hidden in some bushes at the top of the pocket on the western side.  Juarez and Jim busied themselves first in looking after their horses. Removing the saddles they rubbed down each animal thoroughly, clear to the fetlocks and then gave them a good feed of grain. Jo and Tom were on the supper committee and busying themselves making preparations for a square meal. Manuello,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25473"],["title","Frontier Boys on the Coast; Or, In the Pirate's Power (#6)"],["body"," had been with the boys on the other side of the range and was accustomed to help in odd chores about camp, now offered to aid in getting the supper.  \"I will make the coffee with your permission, Senor Jo,\" he proposed.  \"Do you savvy it all right, Manuello?\" inquired Jo.  \"Ah, yes, Senor. I can make such coffee as the Holy Father would be pleased to drink,\" he replied with fervor.  \"Not too strong because it keeps me awake,\" protested Tom.  \"No, no, Senor Thomas,\" replied Manuello with a sweeping bow, \"the coffee I make is very soothing. It will give you a long, soft sleep.\" There was an undertone of subtle irony that was entirely lost upon the two straightforward boys.  \"That's a good fellow, Manuello,\" said Jo, cordially, and he handed the coffee pot filled with water to the Mexican, who went about the preparation of it with a deftness that showed that he knew what he was about. Not one of the boys saw him slip a white powder into the coffee pot. It quickly dissolved and the coffee began to bubble innocently enough under the eyes of the hunchback Manuello.  Juarez and Jim just then came back from looking after the horses which were fastened near the wall of rock. As soon as Juarez saw the Mexican watching over the coffee pot, his eyes narrowed with suspicion.  \"Who made the coffee?\" he asked Jo, bluntly.  \"Manuello,\" replied Jo.  \"The Senor will find the coffee truly delicious,\" said the hunchback with a bow, \"only the Mexican knows how to keep its aroma when boiling it.\"  \"Humph,\" grunted Juarez, and he went deliberately to the fire and lifted the coffee pot off and poured its contents on the ground.  \"The American does not care for the aroma of your Mexican coffee,\" he said coolly.  The Mexican merely gave a peculiar hitch to his shoulder, spat on the ground and turned away apparently mortally offended as he, no doubt, was. That part of his scheme had been blocked by the craftiness of Juarez, but the Captain might make good where his spy had failed.  The Mexican sat back in the shadow on a rock smoking a cigarette, while the boys ate their supper of beans, meat, bread and coffee. He was the skeleton at the feast as it were, not only his malignant humor made itself felt, but there was a sense of depression that they could not shake off, try as they would.  This was so unusual that they could not account for it. As a rule, they were jolly and even when danger was impending, they felt a certain confidence and assurance, but not so tonight.  \"What makes us feel so on the bum tonight, do you suppose?\" asked Tom.  \"Maybe this canyon is haunted,\" proposed Jo, who had an imaginative streak in him.  \"I tell you the way I figure it,\" said Jim. \"We are not used to camping in a hollow like this, for before this we have always selected a place that we could defend, and though there is no particular danger from outlaws or Indians in these mountains, we can't shake off our old habits.\"  \"I believe there is something in that,\" acquiesced Jo.  \"It's that rat over there,\" said Juarez loudly.  The Mexican laughed coolly and insolently, and lighted another cigarette. This would have maddened an excitable person, but Juarez was in a stoical mood and he contented himself with flinging a bone that he had been gnawing at, carelessly over his shoulder, almost striking the Mexican in the face.  This set that peppery individual wild and he tore around considerably, tearing his hair, stamping his feet and sputtering with maledictions at the insult that had been offered him.  \"I am no dog that you can throw a bone to,\" and he sizzled off into a string of unpleasant remarks.  \"Here you, Manuello,\" roared Jim, rising to his feet and standing over the Mexican, \"not another yelp out of you.\"  Manuello had a respect for this big American lad much as he despised his simplicity and he sobered down. Besides he had not finished his work for the night. He had failed to get the sleeping drug to the boys in the coffee and now he must be ready to help his master, Captain Broom of the Sea Eagle, in some other way.  There was a person whom he feared and admired absolutely and he had been a most useful spy and agent for the Skipper in certain nefarious plots. It was well for the little hunchback that no one knew of his share in the betraying of old Juan Sebastian some years before.  \"You will have the first watch, Jo,\" ordered Jim. \"It is now nine o'clock. I will relieve you at eleven and stand guard until two. Juarez from two until five and Tom can have the short watch.\"  According to this arrangement, Jim and Juarez would be on guard during the danger hours.  How many times in the past had the boys stood guard over their camp. Was this to be the last guard? There were the old Kansas days, when they had to be on the watch against horse thieves. Then came the dangerous crisis in their Colorado experiences, when they had to guard against the wiles of the Indians. And most exciting of all, perhaps, the night in old Mexico when they camped on the trail of the outlaws. I wonder if Jo, the first on duty, thought of these old times that night. Probably not, his mind being fully occupied with the business in hand.     CHAPTER IX  THE ATTACK   So the three boys rolled into their blankets with the saddles for pillows and dropped immediately to sleep as they were very tired from the long, hard ride. They lay at different points around the fire, which was allowed to die down as the fog seemed like a warm gray blanket over the whole landscape.  Jo sat on a log by the slowly dying fire, with his rifle on his knees looking into the darkness and not far from him lay the Mexican a mere dark lump on the ground, apparently asleep, but keeping a wary eye on all around. Imperceptibly he crept nearer to where Jo was sitting, but he did not have the weapon he would have preferred in his hand, the stiletto, which was as natural to him as the fangs to a rattlesnake.  But it did not suit the long-headed Captain Broom to have the boys killed. He wanted their life as well as their money, but in a different sense than the adage has it. From what he had heard of them, they were boys of unusual mettle and varied acquirements. If caught young, he could train them to good purpose. If they proved worthless, he would hold them for ransom.  So Captain Broom had told Manuello briefly and to the point that there was to be no rib-sticking and the Mexican would have thought as soon of disobeying the commands of the Evil One as of going contrary to the instructions of the Captain. So as he crept towards Jo, he held not a poniard in his clenched hand, but a heavy weapon like a black-jack, made of leather with a weight at the end.  Jo, however, spoiled his first attempt, for when the greaser had got within striking distance, Jo got up and went down to the pool to get a drink. If it had not been so dark, when they arrived, the boys would have seen tracks around the pool that would have aroused their suspicions. But everything seemed to work against them this time.  Jo stooped down at the brink and scarcely put his thirsty lips to the water when some instinct of warning made him look quickly around and he saw a small dark object directly back of him.  \"Pardon, Senor, for startling you;\" it was the voice of the dwarf, \"but I, too, was very thirsty. It is in the air.\"  \"You needn't have been so quiet about it,\" said Jo, crossly. This little rat always had a way of baffling and irritating him, because he did not have Jim's force, which could beat down the dwarf when occasion demanded it, or the stoicism of Juarez, which blocked the hunchback.  \"I came softly, Senor,\" said the Mexican, imperturbably, \"because I did not wish to disturb the slumbers of the Senors who are resting.\"  \"Get down and drink, then,\" said Jo, who, though he realized that the Mexican was up to some hidden deviltry, did not know how to meet him. Jim and Juarez would have knocked him out of the camp if they had discovered him trailing them, with a warning that he would be shot if he put in an appearance again.  While the Mexican was pretending to drink, Jo satisfied his thirst at a point of the pool where he would be safe from a sudden attack by the hunchback. For Jo was not a fool by any means. Then he got to his feet and with the Mexican ahead of him, he saw to that, he made his way back to the camp.  Scarcely had Jo seated himself upon the rock again than he heard a stick snap upon the mountain side above the horses, so he got to his feet to investigate.  \"You can stay where you are, Manuello,\" said Jo. \"I don't need your company this time.\" The Mexican laughed softly to himself.  \"I hope the Senor Americano will not get lonesome,\" he said.  Jo made a careful search in the direction of the sound but found no sign of a human being lurking among the trees. Though he felt exceedingly nervous, he was unable to account therefor or give a reason.  Very quietly he went the rounds, so as not to awake the boys, who, however, were sleeping heavily. He found the horses all right standing with drooping heads as though dozing, Jo's black with his neck over Tom's bay, as these horses were great chums. But Caliente and Juarez's roan were not sociable and kept strictly to themselves.  Then Jo returned to the rock where he had been sitting. He stirred the dying fire so that it sent up a feeble spurt of flame by the aid of which he looked at his watch. It lacked a few minutes of ten. The Mexican had taken up his old place on the ground watching for his chance. He was anxious that the attack should take place during Jo's watch for he had his doubts in regard to Juarez or the redoubtable Jim proving easy victims.  All this time, Captain Bill Broom and his crew had been keeping watch upon their intended victims from the top of the cliff above the pool. They could see every move from the time the Frontier Boys had arrived until they lay down near the smouldering fire.  \"They are a husky lot,\" was the Captain's first comment. \"That tall"]]]
