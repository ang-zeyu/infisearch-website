We have completed the dissection of the body. A minute analysis of each organ is now under way, and chemical tests of the body's substances are being made. We found that differences in the skeletal structure were almost as great as those in the fleshy tissues. We find no relationship between these structures and those of any other species--human or animal--that we have ever found.\"  \"And yet Alice was not always like that,\" said Mel.  Dr. Winters looked at him sharply. \"How do you know that?\"  Mel extended the medical records he had obtained in Central Valley. Dr. Winters picked them up and examined them for a long time while Mel watched silently.  Finally, Dr. Winters put the records down with a sigh. \"This seems to make the problem even more complex than it was.\"  \"There are X-rays, too,\" said Mel. \"Alice had pelvic X-rays only a little over two years ago. I tried to get them, but the doctor said you'd have to request them. They should be absolute proof that Alice was different then.\"  \"Tell me who has them and I'll send for them at once.\"  An hour later Dr. Winters shook his head in disbelief as he turned off the light box and removed the X-ray photograph. \"It's impossible to believe that these were taken of your wife, but they corroborate the evidence of the other medical records. They show a perfectly normal structure.\"  The two men remained silent across the desk, each reluctant to express his confused thoughts. Dr. Winters finally broke the silence. \"It must be, Mr. Hastings,\" he said, \"--it must be that this woman--this utterly alien person--is simply not your wife, Alice. Somehow, somewhere, there must be a mistake in identity, a substitution of similar individuals.\"  \"She was not out of my sight,\" said Mel. \"Everything was completely normal when I came home that night. Nothing was out of place. We went out to a show. Then, on the way home, the accident occurred. There could have been no substitution--except right here in the hospital. But I know it was Alice I saw. That's why I made you let me see her again--to make sure.\"  \"But the evidence you have brought me proves otherwise. These medical records, these X-rays prove that the girl, Alice, whom you married, was quite normal. It is utterly impossible that she could have metamorphosed into the person on whom we operated.\"  Mel stared at the reflection of the sky in the polished desk top. \"I don't know the answer,\" he said. \"It must not be Alice. But if that's the case, where is Alice?\"  \"That might even be a matter for the police,\" said Dr. Winters. \"There are many things yet to be learned about this mystery.\"  \"There's one thing more,\" said Mel. \"Fingerprints. When we first came here Alice got a job where she had to have her fingerprints taken.\"  \"Excellent!\" Dr. Winters exclaimed. \"That should give us our final proof!\"  It took the rest of the afternoon to get the fingerprint record and make a comparison. Dr. Winters called Mel at home to give him the report. There was no question. The fingerprints were identical. The corpse was that of Alice Hastings.         *       *       *       *       *  The nightmare came again that night. Worse than Mel could ever remember it. As always, it was a dream of space, black empty space, and he was floating alone in the immense depths of it. There was no direction. He was caught in a whirlpool of vertigo from which he reached out with agonized yearning for some solidarity to cling to.  There was only space.  After a time he was no longer alone. He could not see them, but he knew they were out there. The searchers. He did not know why he had to flee or why they sought him, but he knew they must never overtake him, or all would be lost.  [Illustration]  Somehow he found a way to propel himself through empty space. The searchers were growing points of light in the far distance. They gave him a sense of direction. His being, his existence, his universe of meaning and understanding depended on the success of his flight from the searchers. Faster, through the wild black depths of space--  He never knew whether he escaped or not. Always he awoke in a tangle of bedclothes, bathed in sweat, whimpering in fear. For a long time Alice had been there to touch his hand when he awoke. But Alice was gone now and he was so weary of the night pursuit. Sometimes he wished it would end with the searchers--whoever they were--catching up with him and doing what they intended to do. Then maybe there would be no more nightmare. Maybe there would be no more Mel Hastings, he thought. And that wouldn't be so bad, either.  He tossed sleeplessly the rest of the night and got up at dawn feeling as if he had not been to bed at all. He would take one day more, and then get back to the News Bureau. He'd take this day to do what couldn't be put off any longer--the collecting and disposition of Alice's personal belongings.         *       *       *       *       *  He shaved, bathed and dressed, then began emptying the drawers, one by one. There were many souvenirs, mementos. She was always collecting these. Her bottom drawer was full of stuff that he'd glimpsed only occasionally.  In the second layer of junk in the drawer he came across the brochure on Martian vacations. It must have been one of the dreams of her life, he thought. She'd wanted it so much that she'd almost come to believe that it was real. He turned the pages of the smooth, glossy brochure. Its cover bore the picture of the great Martian Princess and the blazoned emblem of Connemorra Space Lines. Inside were glistening photos of the plush interior of the great vacation liner, and pictures of the domed cities of Mars where Earthmen played more than they worked. Mars had become the great resort center of Earth.  Mel closed the book and glanced again at the Connemorra name. Only one man had ever amassed the resources necessary to operate a private space line. Jim Connemorra had done it; no one knew quite how. But he operated now out of both hemispheres with a space line that ignored freight and dealt only in passenger business. He made money, on a scale that no government-operated line had yet been able to approach.  Mel sank down to the floor, continuing to shift through the other things in the drawer.  His hand stopped. He remained motionless as recognition showered sudden frantic questions in his mind. There lay a ticket envelope marked Connemorra Lines.  The envelope was empty when he looked inside, and there was no name on it. But it was worn. As if it might have been carried to Mars and back.  In sudden frenzy he began examining each article and laying it in a careless pile on the floor. He recognized a pair of idiotic Martian dolls. He found a tourist map of the ruined cities of Mars. He found a menu from the Red Sands Hotel.  And below all these there was a picture album. Alice at the Red Sands. Alice at the Phobos Oasis. Alice at the Darnella Ruins. He turned the pages of the album with numb fingers. Alice in a dozen Martian settings. Some of them were dated. About two years ago. They had gone together, Alice had said, but there was no evidence of Mel's presence on any such trip.  But it was equally impossible that Alice had made the trip, yet here was proof. Proof that swept him up in a doubting of his own senses. How could such a thing have taken place? Had he actually made such a trip and been stripped of the memory by some amnesia? Maybe he had forced himself to go with her and the power of his lifelong phobia had wiped it from his memory.  And what did it all have to do--if anything--with the unbelievable thing Dr. Winters had found about Alice?  Overcome with grief and exhaustion he sat fingering the mementos aimlessly while he stared at the pictures and the ticket envelope and the souvenirs.         *       *       *       *       *  Dr. Winters spoke a little more sharply than he intended. \"I don't think anything is going to be solved by a wild-goose chase to Mars. It's going to cost you a great deal of money, and there isn't a single positive lead to any solution.\"  \"It's the only possible explanation.\" Mel persisted. \"Something happened on Mars to change her from what she once was to--what you saw on your operating table.\"  \"And you are hoping that in some desperate way you will find there was a switch of personalities--that there may be a ghost of a chance of finding Alice still alive.\"  Mel bit his lip. He was scarcely willing to admit such a hope but it was the foundation of his decision. \"I've got to do what I can,\" he said. \"I must take the chance. The uncertainty will torment me all my life if I don't.\"  Dr. Winters shook his head. \"I still wish I could persuade you against it. You will find only disappointment.\"  \"My mind is made up. Will you help me or not?\"  \"What can I do?\"  \"I can't go into space unless I can find some way of lifting, even temporarily, this phobia that nearly drives me crazy at the thought of going out there. Isn't there a drug, a hypnotic method, or something to help a thing like this?\"  \"This isn't my field,\" said Dr. Winters. \"But I suspect that the cause of your trouble cannot be suppressed. It will have to be lifted. Psycho-recovery is the only way to accomplish that. I can recommend a number of good men. This, too, is very expensive.\"  \"I should have done it for Alice--long ago,\" said Mel.         *       *       *       *       *  Dr. Martin, the psychiatrist, was deeply interested in Mel's problem. \"It sounds as if it is based on some early trauma, which has long since been wiped from your conscious memory. Recovery may be easy or difficult, depending on how much suppression of the original event has taken place.\"  \"I don't even care what the original event was,\" said Mel, \"if you rid me of this overwhelming fear of space. Dr. Winters said he thought recovery would be "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26093"],["title","The Memory of Mars (#3)"],["body","required.\"  \"He is right. No matter how much overlay you pile on top of such a phobia to suppress it, it will continue to haunt you. We can make a trial run to analyze the situation, and then we can better predict the chance of ultimate success.\"  As a reporter, Mel Hastings had had vague encounters with the subject of psycho-recovery, but he knew little of the details about it. He knew it involved some kind of a machine that could tap the very depths of the human mind and drag out the hidden debris accumulated in mental basements and attics. But such things had always given him the willies. He steered clear of them.  When Dr. Martin first introduced him into the psycho-recovery room his resolution almost vanished. It looked more like a complex electronic laboratory than anything else. A half dozen operators and assistants in nurses' uniforms stood by.  \"If you will recline here--,\" Dr. Martin was saying.  Mel felt as if he were being prepared for some inhuman biological experiment. A cage of terminals was fitted to his head and a thousand small electrodes adjusted to contact with his skull. The faint hum of equipment supported the small surge of apprehension within him.  After half an hour the preparations were complete. The level of lights in the room was lowered. He could sense the operators at their panels and see dimly the figure of Dr. Martin seated near him.  \"Try to recall as vividly as possible your last experience with this nightmare you have described. We will try to lock on to that and follow it on down.\"  This was the last thing in the world Mel wanted to do. He lay in agonized indecision, remembering that he had dreamed only a short time ago, but fighting off the actual recollection of the dream.  \"Let yourself go,\" Dr. Martin said kindly. \"Don't fight it--\"  A fragment of his mind let down its guard for a brief instant. It was like touching the surface of a whirlpool. He was sucked into the sweeping depths of the dream. He sensed that he cried out in terror as he plunged. But there was no one to hear. He was alone in space.  Fear wrapped him like black, clammy fur. He felt the utter futility of even being afraid. He would simply remain as he was, and soon he would cease to be.  But they were coming again. He sensed, rather than saw them. The searchers. And his fear of them was greater than his fear of space alone. He moved. Somehow he moved, driving headlong through great vastness while the pinpoints of light grew behind him.  \"Very satisfactory,\" Dr. Martin was saying. \"An extremely satisfactory probe.\"  His voice came through to Mel as from beyond vast barriers of time and space. Mel felt the thick sweat that covered his body. Weakness throbbed in his muscles.  \"It gives us a very solid anchor point,\" Dr. Martin said. \"From here I think we run back to the beginning of the experience and unearth the whole thing. Are you ready, Mr. Hastings?\"  Mel felt too weak to nod. \"Let 'er rip!\" he muttered weakly.         *       *       *       *       *  The day was warm and sunny. He and Alice had arrived early at the spaceport to enjoy the holiday excitement preceding the takeoff. It was something they had both dreamed of since they were kids--a vacation in the fabulous domed cities and ruins of Mars.  Alice was awed by her first close view of the magnificent ship lying in its water berth that opened to Lake Michigan. \"It's _huge_--how can such an enormous ship ever get off the Earth?\"  Mel laughed. \"Let's not worry about that. We know it does. That's all that matters.\" But he could not help being impressed, too, by the enormous size and the graceful lines of the luxury ship. Unlike Alice, he was not seeing it at close range for the first time. He had met the ship scores of times in his reporting job, interviewing famous and well-known personages as they departed or arrived from the fabulous playgrounds of Mars.  \"If you look carefully,\" Mel pointed out, \"you'll see a lot of faces that make news when they come and go.\"  Alice's face glowed as she clung to Mel's arm and recognized some of the famous citizens who would be their fellow passengers. \"This is going to be the most fun we've ever had in our lives, darling.\"  \"Like a barrel of monkeys,\" Mel said casually, enjoying the bubbling excitement that was in Alice.  The ship was so completely stabilized that the passengers did not even have to sit down during takeoff. They crowded the ports to watch the land and the water shoot past as the ship skimmed half the length of Lake Michigan in its takeoff run. As it bore into the upper atmosphere on an ever-increasing angle of climb, its own artificial gravity system took over and gave the illusion of horizontal flight with the Earth receding slowly behind.  Mel and Alice wandered through the salons and along the spacious decks as if in some fairyland-come-true. All sense of time seemed to vanish and they floated with the great ship in timeless, endless space.  He wasn't quite certain when he first became aware of his own sense of disquietude. It seemed to result from a change in the members of the crew. On the morning of the third day they ceased their universal and uninterrupted concern for their passengers' entertainment and enjoyment.  Most of the passengers seemed to have taken no note of it. Mel commented to Alice. She laughed at him. \"What do you expect? They've spent two full days showing us the ship and teaching us to play all the games aboard. You don't expect them to play nurse to us during the whole trip, do you?\"  It sounded reasonable. \"I suppose so,\" said Mel dubiously. \"But just what _are_ they doing? They all seem to be in such a hurry to get somewhere this morning.\"  \"Well, they must have some duties to perform in connection with running the ship.\"  Mel shook his head in doubt.         *       *       *       *       *  Alice joined him in wandering about the decks, kibitzing on the games of the other passengers, and watching the stars and galaxies on the telescopic screens. It was on one of these that they first saw the shadow out in space. Small at first, the black shadow crossed a single star and made it wink. That was what caught Mel's attention, a winking star in the dead night of space.  When he was sure, he called Alice's attention to it. \"There's something moving out there.\" By now it had shape, like a tiny black bullet.  \"Where? I don't see anything.\"  \"It's crossing that patch of stars. Watch, and you can see it blot them out as it moves.\"  \"It's another ship!\" Alice exclaimed. \"That's exciting! To think we're passing another ship in all this great emptiness of space! I wonder where it's coming from?\"  \"And where it's going to.\"  They watched its slow, precise movement across the stars. After several minutes a steward passed by. Mel hailed him and pointed to the screen. \"Can you tell us what that other ship is?\"  The steward glanced and seemed to recognize it instantly. But he paused in replying. \"That's the Mars liner,\" he said finally. \"In just a few minutes the public address system will announce contact and change of ship.\"  \"Change of ship?\" Mel asked, puzzled. \"I never heard anything about a change of ship.\"  \"Oh, yes,\" the steward said. \"This is only the shuttle that we're on now. We transfer to the liner for the remainder of the trip. I'm sure that was explained to you at the time you purchased your tickets.\" He hurried away.  Mel was quite sure no such thing had been explained to him when he purchased tickets. He turned back to the screen and watched the black ship growing swiftly larger now as it and the Martian Princess approached on contact courses.  The public address system came alive suddenly. \"This is your Captain. All passengers will now prepare to leave the shuttle and board the Mars liner. Hand luggage should be made ready. All luggage stowed in the hold will be transferred without your attention. It has been a pleasure to have you aboard. Contact with the liner will be made in fifteen minutes.\"  From the buzz around him Mel knew that this was as much a surprise to everyone else as it was to him, but it was greeted with excitement and without question.  Even Alice was growing excited now and others crowded around them when it was discovered what they were viewing. \"It looks _big_,\" said Alice in subdued voice. \"Bigger than this ship by far.\"  Mel moved away and let the others have his place before the screen. His sense of uneasiness increased as he contemplated the approach of that huge black ship. And he was convinced its color _was_ black, that it was not just the monotone of the view screen that made it so.  Why should there be such a transfer of passengers in mid-space? The Martian Princess was certainly adequate to make the journey to Mars. Actually they were more than a third of the way there, already. He wasn't sure why he felt so certain something was amiss. Surely there was no possibility that the great Connemorra Lines would plan any procedure to the detriment of the more than five thousand passengers aboard the ship. His uneasiness was pretty stupid, he thought.  But it wouldn't go away.  He returned to the crowd clustered at the viewing screen and took Alice by the arm to draw her away.  She looked quizzically at him. \"This is the most exciting thing yet. I want to watch it.\"  \"We haven't got much time,\" Mel said. \"We've got a lot of things to get in our suitcases. Let's go down to our stateroom.\"  \"Everyone else has to pack, too. There's no hurry.\"  \"Fifteen minutes, the Captain said. We don't want to be the last ones.\"  Unwillingly, Alice followed. Their stateroom was a long way from the salon. The fifteen minutes were almost up by the time they reached it.         *       *       *       *       *  Mel closed the door to their room and put his hands on Alice's shoulders. He glanced about warily. \"Alice--I don't want to go aboard that ship. There's something wrong about this whole thing. I don't know what it is, but we're not going aboard.\"  Alice "]]]
