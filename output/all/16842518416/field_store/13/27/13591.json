One minute he was dwelling on his mother's troubles and the want of news from his father, and from this it was a natural transition to thinking of how grand it would be if he could prevail upon her to let him go up to that far-away mysterious city, which it took days to reach on horseback, and then he could take her letter and find where his father was lying with his regiment, and see the army,--maybe see the king and queen, and perhaps his father might let him stay there,--at all events for a time.  Then he was off to thinking about the great moat, for twice over a splash rose to his ears, and he could see the rings of water which spread out and made the lily-leaves rise and fall.  \"That was the big tench,\" he said to himself.  \"Must catch that fellow some day.  He must weigh six or seven pounds.  It ought to be a good time now.  Want a strong line, though, and a big hook, for he'd run in and out among the lily-stems and break mine.  Now, if I knew where father was, I could write and ask him to buy me one and send it down by his next letter.  No: he wouldn't want to be bothered to buy me fishing-lines when he's with his regiment.  I know,\" he said to himself, after a pause; \"old Ben has got the one he caught the big eel with. I'll make him lend me that.  Poor old Ben! who'd ever have thought that he could cry.  For it was crying just as a little boy would.  Seems funny, because he has been a brave soldier, and saved father's life once.  Shouldn't have thought a man like that could cry.\"  Roy began to whistle softly, and then picked up a little cushion-like patch of velvety green moss and pitched it down towards a jackdaw that was sitting on a projecting stone just below a hole, watching him intently, first with one eye and then with the other, as if puzzled to know what he was doing so near to his private residence, where his wife was sitting upon a late batch of eggs, an accident connected with rats having happened to the first.  It did not occur to the bird that it was quite impossible for its nesting-place to be reached without a swing down from above by a rope; but, being still puzzled, it tried to sharpen its intellectual faculties by standing on one leg and scratching its grey poll with the claws of the other, a feat which made it unsteady and nearly topple over towards the deep moat below.  \"_Tah_!\" it cried, in resentment of the insult when the little green moss cushion was thrown; and, as the bird sailed away, Roy rose and walked slowly along the rampart, through the corner tower, and then on towards the front, where that over the outer gate-way stood tall, massive, and square.  Here the boy left the rampart, entered through a low arched door, and stood in the great chamber over the main gate-way, where the rusty chains were wound round the two capstans, held fast now by their checks, and suspending the huge grated portcullis, with its spikes high enough to be clear of a coachman driving a carriage.  \"Wonder whether we could let that down?\" thought Roy.  He had often had the same thought, but it came very strongly now, and he began to calculate how many men it would take to lower the portcullis, and whether he, Ben, and a couple more could manage it.  \"Looks as if everything must be set fast with rust,\" he thought, and he was about to turn and descend; but as he reached the corner where the spiral steps led down, he stood where they also led up to another chamber in the massive stone-work, and again higher to the leads.  The result was that in his idle mood Roy began to ascend, to find half-way up, by the slit which gave light, that the jackdaws had been busy there too, coming in and out by the loop-hole, and building a nest which was supported upon a scaffolding of sticks which curved up from the stone step on which it rested, and from that to the splay and sill by the loop-hole.  \"Only an old one,\" said the boy to himself, and he brought the great edifice down with a sharp kick or two, thinking that it must be about a year since any one had come up that way.  \"What a lot of the old place seems no use!\" he said to himself, as, with the dry sticks crackling beneath his feet, he climbed up the dark stairway and entered the next chamber through its low arched door.  \"Why, what a jolly private room this would make!\" he said to himself; \"only wants a casement in and some furniture.  I'll ask father to let me have it for my play--I mean study; no, I don't--I mean odds and ends place.\"  He paused--after glancing out at the beautiful view over the woodland country dotted with meadow-like pastures in which the ruddy cattle of the county grazed--by the open fireplace with the arms of the Roylands cut in stone beneath the narrow shelf, and the sight of this opening, with the narrow, well-made chimney and some projecting stone blocks from the fire-back, set him thinking.  \"Fight differently now,\" he said, as he recalled the object of the furnace before him, and how he had heard or read that it was used on purpose to melt lead ready for pouring down upon the besiegers who might have forced their way across the drawbridge to the portcullis.  \"Fancy melting lead here to pour down upon men's heads!  What wretches we must have been in the old days.\"  He altered his mind, though, directly, as he went back to the stairway.  \"Perhaps we never did pour any down, for I don't think anybody ever did attack the castle.\"  Thinking he might as well go a little higher, he mounted the spiral instead of descending, the dry elm twigs brought in by the jackdaws which made the untenanted corners their home crackling again beneath his feet.  Passing out of the corner turret, which supported a stout, new flag-pole, he was now on the leaded roof of the great square tower, which frowned down upon the drawbridge and gazed over the outer gate-way, in whose tower old Jenkin Bray, the porter, dwelt, and whom Roy could now see sitting beside the modern iron gate sunning himself, his long white hair and beard glistening in the light.  There were openings for heavy guns in front here, and a broad, level, projecting parapet with a place where the defenders could kneel, and which looked like a broad seat at the first glance, while at its foot was a series of longish, narrow, funnel-shaped openings, over which the boy stood, gazing down through them at the entrance to the main gate-way, noting how thoroughly they commanded the front of where the portcullis would stand when dropped, and where any enemies attacking and trying to break through would be exposed to a terrible shower of molten lead, brought up from the furnace in the chamber below to pour down upon the besiegers, while those who assailed them were in perfect safety.  \"Horrid!\" muttered Roy; \"but I don't know; the enemy should stop away and leave the people in the castle alone.  But hot lead!  Boiling water wouldn't seem so bad.  But surely Master Pawson's friend is wrong; we can't be going to have war here in England.  Well, if we do, there's nothing to bring them here.\"  Roy left the machicolations and knelt upon the broad stone seat-like place to stretch himself across the parapet, and look down, over the narrow patch of stone paving, down into the deep moat, whose waters were lit up by the sunshine, so that the boy could see the lily and other water-plant stems and clumps of reed mace; at the farther edge the great water-docks and plantains, with the pink-blossomed rush.  But his attention was wholly riveted by the fish which swarmed in the sunny depths, and for a time he lay there upon his breast, kicking up his heels and studying the broad-backed carp, some of which old age had decked with patches of greyish mould.  There were fat tench, too, walloping about among the lilies, and appearing to enjoy the pleasure of forcing their way in and out among the leaves and stems; while the carp sailed about in the open water, basking in the sunshine, and seemed to find their satisfaction in leaping bodily out of the water to fall back with a splash.  There were roach, too, in shoals, and what seemed remarkable was that they kept swimming close up to where a great pike of nearly three feet long lay motionless, close to a patch of weed.  \"Must be asleep,\" thought Roy, \"or not hungry, and they all know it, because he would soon snap up half a dozen of them.\"  Then, as he lay lazily watching the fish in the drowsy sunshine which had warmed the stones, the political troubles of the nation and the great cloud of war, with its lightnings, destruction, and death, were unseen.  He was surrounded by peace in the happiest days of boyhood, and trouble seemed as if it could not exist.  But the trumpet-blast had rung out the call to arms, and men were flocking to that standard and to this, and the flash and thunder of guns had begun.  But not there down to that sleepy, retired part of Devon.  There was the castle built for defence, and existing now as Sir Granby Royland's happy country home, surrounded by its great estate with many tenants, while its heir was stretched out there in the sunshine upon his chest, kicking up his heels, and thinking at that moment that it would not be a bad amusement to bring up a very long line with a plummet at the end, to bait it, and then swing it to and fro till he could drop it right out where the great pike lay, ten or a dozen feet from the drawbridge.  \"I will some day,\" said the boy, half aloud; \"but it's too much trouble now.\"  He swung himself round and lay there, looking back over the top of the spacious building, on whose roof he was, right across the now floral old court-yard, and between the two angle towers, to the wide-spreading acres of the farms and woodlands which formed his father's estate.  The jackdaws flew about, and began to settle at the corners as he lay so still and languidly said to himself--  \"Need to lie still; it wouldn't do to slip over backward. "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25449"],["title","The Young Castellan: A Tale of the English Civil War (#5)"],["body"," I shouldn't even go into the moat, for I should come down on those stones.\"  \"Stupid to be in dangerous places,\" he said to himself directly after, and, rolling over, he let himself down upon the broad seat-like place, where he could lie and watch the prospect just as well.  \"Rather stupid of me not to come up here oftener,\" he thought.  \"It's a capital place.  I will ask father to let me have all this old empty tower to myself.  What's that?  A fight?\"  For there was a sudden rush upward of jackdaws from where they had blackened the farthest corner tower to the left, and, looking in that direction as he lay, he saw the reason of the sudden whirr of wings and outburst of sharp, harsh cries, for there upon the leads, and holding on by the little turret which covered the door-way of the spiral staircase, stood Master Pawson.  \"Feels like I do, I suppose,\" thought Roy, as the secretary cast his eyes round the old building, particularly watchful of the pleasaunce, but keeping right back by the outer crenelles as if not wishing to be seen.  At first Roy felt that the secretary saw him, and as his eyes roved on and he made no sign, the boy's hand went to his pocket in search of his handkerchief to wave to him.  He did not withdraw it, but lay lazily watching while the secretary now turned his back and stood gazing right away.  \"Never saw him do anything of that kind before,\" thought Roy.  \"What's he looking after?  I shouldn't have thought he had ever been up there in his life.\"  Roy lay quite still, with his eyes half closed, and all at once the secretary drew out his white laced handkerchief, wiped his forehead three times with a good deal of flourish, and returned it, after which he slowly stepped into the turret opening and backed out of sight.  \"Mind you don't slip,\" said Roy, tauntingly, but quite conscious of the fact that his words could not be heard.  \"Why, he has gone down like a bear--backward.  I could run down those stairs as fast as I came up.\"  Perhaps it was the warm sunshine, perhaps it was from laziness, but, whatever the cause, Roy Royland went off fast asleep, and remained so for quite a couple of hours, when, starting up wonderingly, and not quite conscious of the reason why he was there, he looked about him, and finally over the great parapet, to see the secretary beyond the farther end of the drawbridge, talking in a very benign way to the old porter, who stood with bent head listening to his words.  \"Why, it seems only a few moments ago that I saw him on the leads over his chamber staring out across country, and he must have been down since, and had a walk.--How time does go when you're snoozing,\" thought Roy, \"and how stupid it is to go to sleep in the daytime!  I won't do it again.\"    CHAPTER FOUR.  THE USE OF A SWORD.  Several days passed away, but Lady Royland always put off sending in search of news, and seemed to be more cheerful, so that Roy soon forgot his anxiety in the many things he had to think about,--amusements, studies, and the like.  But he had a few words with his father's old follower on the subject of the absence of news, one day, when Ben was busy, as usual, in the armoury.  \"Not heard lately from the master, sir?  Pish, that's nothing; soldiers have got their swords and pistols to think about, not their pens.  Best soldiers I ever knew couldn't write at all.  Enough for them to do to fight.  You'll hear from him some day, and when you do, you'll know as he has been pretty busy putting the people straight,--more straight than some on 'em'll like to be, I know.  Sarve 'em right; nobody's a right to fight agen the king.--Looks right, don't it?\"  He held up an old sword which he had rubbed and polished till it flashed in the light.  \"Splendid!\" said Roy.  \"Is it sharp?\"  \"Sharp enough to take your head off at one sweep.\"  \"Nonsense!\" said the boy, laughing.  \"Oh, it's true enough, Master Roy.  Here, you stand all quite stiff and straight, and I'll show you.\"  \"No, thank you, Ben.  Suppose I try it on you.\"  \"There you are, then,\" said the man; \"but I must have one, too, for a guard.\"  He handed the boy the sword, and took up another waiting to be cleaned from galling rust, and, throwing himself on guard, he cried--  \"Now then, cut!\"  \"No; too dangerous,\" said Roy.  \"Not a bit, my lad, because you couldn't touch me.\"  \"I could,\" said Roy, \"where I liked.\"  \"Try, then.\"  \"Not with this sharp sword.\"  \"Very well, then, take one of those; they've no more edge than a wooden one.  It's time you did know how to use a sword, sir.\"  Ben exchanged his glittering blade, too, and once more stood on guard.  \"I won't bother you now about how you ought to stand, sir,\" he said; \"that'll come when I begin to give you some lessons.  You go just as you like, and hit where you can.\"  \"No, no,\" said the boy.  \"I don't want to hurt you, Ben.\"  \"Won't hurt me, sir; more likely to hurt yourself.  But do you know you're standing just as badly as you possibly could? and if I was your enemy, I could take off your head, either of your ears, or your legs, as easily as look at you.\"  Roy laughed, but he did not seem to believe the old soldier's assertion, and, giving his blunt sword a whirl through the air, he cried--  \"Now, then, Ben; which leg shall I cut off?\"  \"Which you like, sir.\"  Roy made a feint at the right leg, and, quickly changing the direction of his weapon, struck with it softly at the old soldier's left.  \"Tchah!\" cried the old man, as blade met blade, his sword, in the most effortless way, being edge outward exactly where Roy struck.  \"Why, do you know, sir, if I'd been in arnest with you, that you would have been spitted like a cockchafer on a pin before you got your blade round to cut?\"  \"Not I,\" said the boy, contemptuously.  \"Very well, sir; you'll see.  Now, try again, and cut hard.  Don't let your blade stop to get a bit of hay and a drop of water on the way, but give it me quick.\"  \"But I don't want to hurt you, Ben.\"  \"Well, I don't, either; and, what's more, I don't mean to let you.\"  \"But I shall, I'm sure, if I strike hard.\"  \"You think so, my lad; but do you know what a good sword is?\"  \"A sword.\"  \"Yes, and a lot more.  When a man can use it properly, it's a shield, and a breastplate, helmet, brasses, and everything else.  Now, I'll just show you.  Helmet, say.  Now, you cut straight down at my head, just as if you were going to cut me in two pieces.\"  \"Put on one of the old helmets, then.\"  \"Tchah!  I don't want any helmets.  You cut.\"  \"And suppose I hurt you?\"  \"S'pose you can't.\"  \"Well, I don't want to,\" said Roy; \"so look out.\"  \"Right, sir; chop away.\"  Roy raised his sword slowly, and the old soldier dropped the point of his and began to laugh.  \"That won't do, my lad; lift your blade as if you were going to bring it down again, not as if you meant to hang it up for an ornament on a peg.\"  \"Oh, very well,\" said Roy.  \"Now, then, I'm going to cut at you sharp.\"  \"Oh, are you, sir?\" said Ben.  \"Now, if ever you're a soldier, and meet a man who means to kill you, shall you tell him you're going to cut at him sharply? because, if you do, you'll have his blade through you before you've half said it.\"  \"You are precious fond of your banter,\" cried Roy, who was a little put out now.  \"Serve you right if I do hurt you.  But this blade won't cut, will it?\"  \"Cut through the air if you move it sharp; that's about all, my lad.\"  \"Then take that,\" cried the boy.  _Clang_--_cling_--_clatter_!  Roy stared, for his sword had come in contact with that of the old soldier, and then was twisted out of his grasp and went rattling along the floor, Ben going after it to fetch it back.  \"Try again, sir.\"  Roy was on his mettle now, and, grasping the hilt more firmly, he essayed to deliver a few blows at his opponent's legs, sides, and arms. But Ben's sword was always there first, and held at such an angle that his weapon glided off violently, as if from his own strength in delivering the blow; and, try hard as he could, he could not get near enough to make one touch.  \"Arms and head, my lad; sharp.\"  Better satisfied now that he would not hurt his adversary, Roy struck down at the near shoulder, but his sword glanced away.  Then at the head, the legs, everywhere that seemed to offer for a blow, but always for his blade to glance off with a harsh grating sound.  \"There, it's of no use; you can't get near me, my lad,\" said Ben, at last.  \"Oh, yes, I can.  I was afraid of hurting you.  I shall hit hard as hard,\" cried Roy, who felt nettled.  \"But I don't want to hurt you. Let's have sticks.\"  \"I'll get sticks directly, sir.  You hit me first with the sword.\"  \"Oh, very well; if you will have it, you shall,\" cried Roy, and, without giving any warning now, he delivered a horizontal blow at the old soldier's side; but it was turned off just as the dozen or so which followed were thrown aside, and then, with a quiet laugh, the old fellow said--  \"Now, every time you hit at me, I could have run you through.\"  \"No, you couldn't,\" said Roy, sharply.  \"Well, we'll see, sir.  Put that down, and use this; or, no, keep your sword; the hilt will protect your hand in case I come down upon it.\"  He took up a stout ash stick and threw himself on guard again, waiting for Roy's blow, which he turned off, but before the next could descend, the boy's aim was disordered by a sharp dig in the chest from the end of the ash stick; and so it was as he went on: before he could strike he always received a prod in the chest, ribs, arms, or shoulders.  \"Oh, I say, Ben,\" he cried at last; \"I didn't know you could use a stick like that.\"  \"Suppose not, my lad; but I knew you couldn't use a sword like that. Now, I tell you what: you'd better come to me for an hour every morning before breakfast, and I'll begin to make such a man of you as your father would like to see when he comes back.\"  \"Well, I will come, Ben,\" said the lad; \"but my arm does not ache so much now, and I don't feel quite beaten.  Let's have another"]]]
