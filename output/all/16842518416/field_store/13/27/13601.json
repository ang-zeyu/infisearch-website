If it wasn't for your own pain, I'd wish you was blind, I would really.\"  For a long time Bill stuttered and fumbled for words, for his joy was too great. \"I am blind, Em'ly,\" he murmured at last.  And the whole ward looked the other way as Emily kissed away his fears. As for Bill Stevens, he sang and laughed and talked so much that evening that the Matron had to come down to stop him.  For, as my legless friend remarked, \"We in 'orspital is the lucky ones, an' any bloke what ain't killed ought to be 'appy and bright like we is.\"     II  A RECIPE FOR GENERALS   Everyone is always anxious to get on the right side of his General; I have chanced upon a recipe which I believe to be infallible for anyone who wears spurs, and who can, somehow or other, get himself in the presence of that venerated gentleman.  I sat one day in a trench outside my dug-out, eating a stew made of bully beef, ration biscuits, and foul water. Inside my dug-out, the smell of buried men was not conducive to a good appetite; outside, some horrible Hun was amusing himself by firing at the sandbag just above me, and sending showers of earth down my neck and into my food. It is an aggravating fact that the German always makes himself particularly objectionable about lunch-time, and that, whenever you go in the trench, his bullets seem to follow you--an unerring instinct brings them towards food. A larger piece of earth than usual in my stew routed the last vestige of my good-humour. Prudence warning me of the futility of losing my temper with a Hun seventy yards away, I called loudly for my servant.  \"Jones,\" I said, when he came up, \"take away this stuff. It's as bad as a gas attack. I'm fed up with it. I'm fed up with Maconochie, I'm fed up with the so-called 'fresh' meat that sometimes makes its appearance. Try to get hold of something new; give me a jugged hare, or a pheasant, or something of that kind.\"  \"Yessir,\" said Jones, and he hurried off round the traverse to finish my stew himself.  It never does to speak without first weighing one's words. This is an old maxim--I can remember something about it in one of my first copy-books; but, like most other maxims, it is never learnt in real life. My thoughtless allusion to \"jugged hare\" set my servant's brain working, for hares and rabbits have, before now, been caught behind the firing line. The primary difficulty, that of getting to the country haunted by these animals, was easily solved, for, though an officer ought not to allow a man to leave a trench without a very important reason, the thought of new potatoes at a ruined farm some way back, or cherries in the orchard, generally seems a sufficiently important reason to send one's servant back on an errand of pillage. Thus it was that, unknown to me, my servant spent part of the next three days big-game hunting behind the firing line.  My first intimation of trouble came to me the day after we had gone back to billets for a rest, when an orderly brought me a message from Brigade Headquarters. It ran as follows:--     \"Lieut. Newcombe is to report at Brigade Headquarters this afternoon    at 2 p.m. to furnish facts with reference to his servant, No. 6789,    Pte. Jones W., who, on the 7th inst., discharged a rifle behind the    firing line, to the great personal danger of the Brigadier, Pte.    Jones's Company being at the time in the trenches.       \"(_Signed_) G. MACKINNON,      \"_Brigade Major_.\"  \"Jones,\" I cried, \"come and explain this to me,\" and I read him the incriminating document.  My servant's English always suffers when he is nervous.  \"Well, sir,\" he began, \"it 'appened like this 'ere. After what you said the other day abaht bully beef, I went orf ter try ter git a rebbit or an 'are. I seen sev'ral, sir, but I never 'it one nor wired one. Then, on Friday, jest as I was shootin' at an 'ole 'are what I see, up kime an orficer, one o' thim Staff gints. 'Who are you?' 'e asks. I told 'im as I was a servant, and was jest tryin' ter git an 'are fer my bloke--beggin' yer pardon, sir, I mean my orficer. Then, after a lot more talk, 'e says, 'Do yer know that yer gone and nearly 'it the Gen'ril?' That's all as I knows abaht it, sir. I never wanted ter 'it no Gen'ril.\"  \"All this, and not even a rabbit!\" I sighed. \"It's a serious business, and you ought to have known better than to go letting off ammunition behind the firing line. However, I'll see what can be done,\" and my servant went away, rather crestfallen, to drown his sorrows in a glass of very mild, very unpleasant Belgian beer.  An hour or two later, I strolled across to a neighbouring billet to see a friend, and to tell him of my coming interview.  \"You'll get hell,\" was his only comfort. Then, as an afterthought, he said, \"You'd better wear my spurs; they'll help to impress him. A clink of spurs will make even your salute seem smart.\"  Thus it was that I, who am no horseman, rode over to Brigade Headquarters, a mile away, with my toes turned in, and a pair of bright and shining spurs turned away as far as possible from my horse's flanks.  Unhappy and ill at ease, I was shown into the General's room.  \"Mr. Newcombe,\" he began, after a preliminary glance at a paper in front of him, \"this is a very serious matter. It is a serious offence on the part of Private Jones, who, I understand, is your servant.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"It is also an example of gross carelessness on your part.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"I was returning from the trenches on your right on Friday last, when a bullet flew past my head, coming from the direction opposed to the Germans. I have a strong objection to being shot at by my own men, right behind the fire trenches, so I sent Captain Neville to find out who had fired, and he found your servant.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Well, can you give any explanation of this extraordinary event?\"  I explained to the best of my ability.  \"It is a very unusual case,\" said the General, when I had finished. \"I do not wish to pursue the matter further, as you are obviously the real person to blame.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"I am very dissatisfied about it, and you must please see that better discipline is kept. I do not like to proceed against officers under my command, so the matter drops here. You must reprimand your servant very severely, and, I repeat, I am very dissatisfied. You may go, Mr.\"--here another glance at the paper before him--\"Newcombe. Good afternoon.\"  I brought my heels together for a very smart salute ... and locked my spurs! For some seconds I stood swaying helplessly in front of him, then I toppled forward, and, supporting myself with both hands upon his table, I at length managed to separate my feet. When I ventured to look at him again to apologise, I saw that his frown had gone, and his mouth was twitching in a strong inclination to laugh.  \"You are not, I take it, Mr. Newcombe, quite accustomed to wearing spurs?\" he said presently.  I blushed horribly, and, in my confusion, blurted out my reason for putting them on. This time he laughed unrestrainedly. \"Well, you have certainly impressed me with them.\" Then, just as I was preparing to go, he said, \"Will you have a glass of whisky, Newcombe, before you go? Neville,\" he called to the Staff Captain in the next room, \"you might ask Andrews to bring the whisky and some glasses.\"  \"Good afternoon,\" said the General, very affably, when, after a careful salute, I finally took my leave.  Let anyone who will try this recipe for making friends with a General. I do not venture to guarantee its infallibility, however, for that depends entirely on the General himself, and, to such, rules and instruction do not apply.     III  \"MUD!\"   Those at home in England, with their experience of war books and photographs, of Zeppelin raids and crowded hospitals, are beginning to imagine they know all there is to know about war. The truth is that they still have but little idea of the life in the trenches, and, as far as mud is concerned, they are delightfully ignorant. They do not know what mud is.  They have read of Napoleon's \"Fourth Element,\" they have listened to long descriptions of mud in Flanders and France, they have raised incredulous eyebrows at tales of men being drowned in the trenches, they have given a fleeting thought of pity for the soldiers \"out there\" as they have slushed home through the streets on rainy nights; but they have never realised what mud means, for no photograph can tell its slimy depth, and even the pen of a Zola or a Victor Hugo could give no adequate idea of it.  And so, till the end of the war, the old story will be continued--while the soldier flounders and staggers about in that awful, sucking swamp, the pessimist at home will lean back in his arm-chair and wonder, as he watches the smoke from his cigar wind up towards the ceiling, why we do not advance at the rate of one mile an hour, why we are not in Berlin, and whether our army is any good at all. If such a man would know why we are not in German territory, let him walk, on a dark night, through the village duck-pond, and then sleep in his wet clothes in the middle of the farmyard. He would still be ignorant of mud and wet, but he would cease to wonder and grumble.  It is the infantryman who suffers most, for he has to live, eat, sleep, and work in the mud. The plain of dragging slime that stretches from Switzerland to the sea is far worse to face than the fire of machine guns or the great black trench-mortar bombs that come twisting down through the air. It is more terrible than the frost and the rain--you cannot even stamp your feet to drive away the insidious chill that mud always brings. Nothing can keep it from your hands and face and clothes; there is no taking off your boots to dry in the trenches--you must lie down just as you are, and often you are lucky if you have two empty sandbags under you to save you from the cold embrace of the swamp.  But if the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25470"],["title","Mud and Khaki: Sketches from Flanders and France (#3)"],["body","stretch is desolate by day, it is shocking by night. Imagine a battalion going up to the trenches to relieve another regiment. The rain comes beating pitilessly down on the long trail of men who stumble along in the blackness over the _pavé_. They are all well loaded, for besides his pack, rifle, and equipment, each man carries a pick or a bag of rations or a bundle of firewood. At every moment comes down the line the cry to \"keep to the right,\" and the whole column stumbles off the _pavé_ into the deep mud by the roadside to allow the passage of an ambulance or a transport waggon. There is no smoking, for they are too close to the enemy, and there is the thought of six days and six nights of watchfulness and wetness in the trenches.  Presently the winding line strikes off the road across the mud. This is not mud such as we know it in England--it is incredibly slippery and impossibly tenacious, and each dragging footstep calls for a tremendous effort. The men straggle, or close up together so that they have hardly the room to move; they slip, and knock into each other, and curse; they are hindered by little ditches, and by telephone wires that run, now a few inches, now four or five feet from the ground. One man trips over an old haversack that is lying in his path--God alone knows how many haversacks and how many sets of equipment have been swallowed up by the mud on the plain of Flanders, part of the equipment of the wounded that has been thrown aside to lighten the burden--and when he scrambles to his feet again he is a mass of mud, his rifle barrel is choked with it, it is in his hair, down his neck, everywhere. He staggers on, thankful only that he did not fall into a shell hole, when matters would have been much worse.  Just when the men are waiting in the open for the leading platoon to file down into the communication trench, a German star shell goes up, and a machine gun opens fire a little farther down the line. As the flare sinks down behind the British trench it lights up the white faces of the men, all crouching down in the swamp, while the bullets swish by, \"like a lot of bloomin' swallers,\" above their heads.  And now comes the odd quarter of a mile of communication trench. It is very narrow, for the enemy can enfilade it, and it is paved with brushwood and broken bricks, and a little drain, that is meant to keep the floor dry, runs along one side of it. In one place a man steps off the brushwood into the drain, and he falls headlong. The others behind have no time to stop themselves, and a grotesque pile of men heaps itself up in the narrow, black trench. One man laughing, the rest swearing, they pick themselves up again, and tramp on to the firing line.  Here the mud is even worse than on the plain they have crossed. All the engineers and all the trench pumps in the world will not keep a trench decently dry when it rains for nine hours in ten and when the trench is the lowest bit of country for miles around. The men can do nothing but \"carry on\"--the parapet must be kept in repair whatever the weather; the sandbags must be filled however wet and sticky the earth. The mud may nearly drag a man's boot off at his every step--indeed, it often does; but the man must go on digging, shovelling, lining the trench with tins, logs, bricks, and planks in the hope that one day he may have put enough flooring into the trench to reach solid ground beneath the mud.  All this, of course, is only the infantryman's idea of things. From a tactical point of view mud has a far greater importance--it is the most relentless enemy that an army can be called upon to face. Even without mud and without Germans it would be a very difficult task to feed and look after a million men on the move; with these two discomforts movement becomes almost impossible.  It is only after you have seen a battery of field artillery on the move in winter that you can realise at all the enormous importance of good weather when an advance is to be made. You must watch the horses labouring and plunging in mud that reaches nearly to their girths; you must see the sweating, half-naked men striving, with outstanding veins, to force the wheels round; you must hear the sucking cry of the mud when it slackens its grip; and you must remember that this is only a battery of light guns that is being moved.  It is mud, then, that is the great enemy. It is the mud, then, and not faulty organisation or German prowess that you must blame if we do not advance as fast as you would like. Even if we were not to advance another yard in another year, people in England should not be disheartened. \"Out there\" we are facing one of the worst of foes. If we do not advance, or if we advance too slowly, remember that it is mud that is the cause--not the German guns.     IV  THE SURPRISE ATTACK   \"Do you really feel quite fit for active service again?\" asked the President of the Medical Board.  It was not without reason that Roger Dymond hesitated before he gave his answer, for nerves are difficult things to deal with. It is surprising, but it is true, that you never find a man who is afraid the first time he goes under fire. There are thousands who are frightened beforehand--frightened that they will \"funk it\" when the time comes, but when they see men who have been out for months \"ducking\" as each shell passes overhead they begin to think what brave fellows they are, and they wonder what fear is. But after they have been in the trenches for weeks, when they realise what a shell can do, their nerve begins to go; they start when they hear a rifle fired, and they crouch down close to the ground at the whistle of a passing shell.  Thus had it been with Roger Dymond. At the beginning of the war he had enjoyed himself--if anyone could enjoy that awful retreat and awful advance. He had been one of the first officers to receive the Military Cross, for brilliant work by the canal at Givenchy; he had laughed and joked as he lay all day in the open and listened to the bullets that went \"pht\" against the few clods of earth he had erected with his entrenching tool, and which went by the high-sounding name of \"head cover.\"  And then, one day a howitzer shell had landed in the dug-out where he was lunching with his three particular friends. When the men of his company cleared the sandbags away from him, he was a gibbering wreck, unwounded but paralysed, and splashed with the blood of three dead men.  Now, after months of battle dreams and mad terror, of massage and electrical treatment, he was faced with the question--\"Do you feel quite fit for active service again?\"  He was tired to death of staying at home with no apparent complaint, he was sick of light duty with his reserve battalion, he wanted to be out at the front again with the men and officers he knew ... and yet, supposing his nerve went again, supposing he lost his self-control....  Finally, however, he looked up. \"Yes, sir,\" he said, \"I feel fit for anything now--quite fit.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Three months later the Medical Officer sat talking to the C.O. in the Headquarter dug-out.  \"As for old Dymond,\" he said, \"he ought never to have been sent out here again. He's done his bit already, and they ought to have given him a 'cushy' job at home, instead of one of those young staff blighters\"--for the M.O. was no respecter of persons, and even a \"brass hat\" failed to awe him.  \"Can't you send him down the line?\" said the C.O. \"This is no place for a man with neurasthenia. God! did you see the way his hand shook when he was in here just now?\"  \"And he's a total abstainer now, poor devil,\" sighed the Doctor with pity, for he was, himself, fond of his drop of whisky. \"I'll send him down to the dressing station to-morrow with a note telling the R.A.M.C. people there that he wants a thorough change.\"  \"Good,\" said the C.O. \"I'm very sorry he's got to go, for he's a jolly good officer. However, it can't be helped. Have another drink, Doc.\"  It is bad policy to refuse the offer of a senior officer, and the M.O. was a man with a thirst, so he helped himself with liberality. Before he had raised the glass to his lips, the sudden roar of many bursting shells caused him to jump to his feet. \"Hell!\" he growled. \"Another hate. More dirty work at the cross roads.\" And he hurried off to the little dug-out that served him as a dressing station, his beloved drink standing untouched on the table.  Meanwhile, Roger Dymond crouched up against the parapet, and listened to the explosions all around him. \"Oil cans\" and \"Minnewerfer\" bombs came hurtling through the air, \"Crumps\" burst with great clouds of black smoke, bits of \"Whizz-bangs\" went buzzing past and buried themselves deep in the ground. Roger Dymond tried to light his cigarette, but his hand shook so that he could hardly hold the match, and he threw it away in fear that the men would see how he trembled.  Thousands of people have tried to describe the noise of a shell, but no man can know what it is like unless he can put himself into a trench to hear the original thing. There is the metallic roar of waves breaking just before the rain, there is the whistle of wind through the trees, there is the rumble of a huge traction engine, and there is the sharp back-fire of a motor car. With each different sinister noise, Roger Dymond felt his hold over himself gradually going ... going....  Next to him in the trench crouched Newman, a soldier who had been in his platoon in the old days when they tramped, sweating and half-dead, along the broiling roads towards Paris.  \"They'm a blasted lot too free with their iron crosses and other souvenirs,\" growled that excellent fellow. \"I'd rather be fighting them 'and to 'and like we did in that there churchyard near Le Cateau, wouldn't you, sir?\"  Dymond smiled sickly assent, and Newman, being an old soldier, knew what was the matter with his captain. He watched him as, bit by bit, his nerve gave way, but he dared not"]]]
