[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25545"],["title","Children's Literature (#8)"],["body",", we might choose \"The Three Sillies,\" \"Little Red Riding-Hood,\" \"Cinderella,\" \"The Three Billy-Goats Gruff,\" \"The Straw Ox,\" and \"The Horned Women.\" For the third grade, somewhat longer and more complex stories might be chosen.  About half a dozen fables might also be used appropriately in each of the primary grades. Simple Aesopic fables in prose seem best for the first two grades. More complex forms might be chosen for the third grade, for example, \"The Story of Alnaschar,\" \"The Good Samaritan,\" \"The Discontented Pendulum,\" \"The Musical Ass,\" \"The Swan, the Pike, and the Crab,\" and \"The Hen with the Golden Eggs.\"  Much of the nature literature of the primary grades may be in the form of verse, but some simple nature prose may be used successfully. From the selections in this book, \"Peter Rabbit\" should be chosen for the first grade, while \"Johnny Chuck,\" and \"Mr. 'Possum's Sick Spell\" are appropriate for the second and third grades.  The simplest of Andersen's _Fairy Tales_ may be used in the third grade, and perhaps in the second. Some suitable stories are \"The Real Princess,\" \"The Fir Tree,\" \"The Tinder Box,\" \"The Hardy Tin Soldier,\" and \"The Ugly Duckling.\"  The ideal verse for the first grade is nursery rhymes, which may be chosen from the first 135 selections of this book. These may be supplemented by such simple verse as \"The Three Kittens,\" \"The Moon,\" \"Ding Dong,\" \"The Little Kitty,\" \"Baby Bye,\" \"Time to Rise,\" \"Rain,\" \"I Like Little Pussy,\" and \"The Star.\" In the second and third grades, traditional verses from those following Number 135 in Section II may be used. The poems by Stevenson are ideal for these grades, and those by Field, Sherman, and Christina Rossetti are good. In addition the teacher might select such poems as \"The Brown Thrush,\" and \"Who Stole the Bird's Nest.\"  _Fourth, fifth, and sixth grades._ Although pupils in these intermediate grades may be expected to read some library books, the teacher should read and tell stories frequently, for this is the surest way to develop in the pupil a taste for good literature. The teacher should remember, too, that the story she recommends to the pupils as suitable reading should be about two grades easier than those told or read by the teacher. Probably every poem presented as literature in these grades should be read or recited by the teacher because pupils are not likely to get the charm of rhythm, melody, and rhyme if they do the reading. Pupils who dislike poetry are pupils who have not heard good poetry well read.  Myths are appropriate for each of the intermediate grades. Most teachers prefer for the fourth grade the simpler classical myths, such as \"A Story of Springtime,\" \"The Miraculous Pitcher,\" \"The Narcissus,\" and \"The Apple of Discord.\" In the fifth grade, the teacher may use the more difficult classical myths, reserving the Norse myths for the sixth grade.  Modern fairy and fantastic stories are also appropriate for each of these grades. Suitable stories for the fourth grade are \"The Four-Leaved Clover,\" \"The Emperor's New Clothes,\" \"The Nightingale,\" and \"The Story of Fairyfoot.\" Stories appropriate for the fifth grade are \"The Happy Prince,\" \"The Knights of the Silver Shield,\" and \"The Prince's Dream.\" In the sixth grade, the teacher might use \"Old Pipes and the Dryad\" and \"The King of the Golden River.\"  Two or three symbolic stories or fables in verse from the last part of Section V should be used in each of these grades.  Nature prose should appeal more and more to children as they advance from the fourth to the eighth grade. Many pupils in the fourth grade will enjoy reading for themselves books by Burgess and Paine, while fifth- and sixth-grade pupils will get much pleasure from the simpler books by Sharp, Seton, Long, Miller, and Roberts. In the intermediate grades, the teacher may read such stories as \"Wild Life in the Farm Yard,\" \"The Vendetta,\" \"Pasha,\" \"Moufflou,\" and \"Bird Habits.\"  Stories of various other kinds may be read by the teacher in the intermediate grades. \"Goody Two-Shoes\" and \"Waste Not, Want Not,\" are suitable for the fourth grade. The biographies \"How Columbus Got His Ships\" and \"Boyhood of Washington\" are excellent in the fifth or sixth grade as an introduction to history study, and the romance \"Robin Hood and the Merry Little Old Woman\" may be used appropriately in any of these grades, especially if it is made to supplement a discussion of the Norman conquest.  Most of the poems up to about No. 342, and a few beyond that, are within the range of the work for these grades.  _Seventh and eighth grades._ Although pupils in the seventh and eighth grades may be expected to read simple narrative readily, the teacher should read to the pupils frequently. It cannot be too much emphasized that reading aloud to children is the surest way of developing an appreciation of the best in literature. In poetry especially this is a somewhat critical time, as the pupil is passing from the simpler and more concrete verse to that which has a more prominent thought content. The persuasion of the reading voice smooths over many obstacles here. Outside the field of poetry, the teacher's work in these grades is mainly one of guidance and direction in getting the children and the right books in contact. Children at this period are likely to be omnivorous readers, ready for any book that comes their way, and the job of keeping them supplied with titles of enough available good books for their needs is indeed one to tax all a teacher's knowledge and experience.  The demand for highly sensational stories on the part of pupils in the upper grades is so insistent that it constitutes a special problem for the teacher. It is a perfectly natural demand, and no wise teacher will attempt to stifle it. Such an attempt would almost certainly result in a more or less surreptitious reading of a mass of unwholesome books which have come to be known as \"dime novels.\" Instead of trying to thwart this desire for the thrilling story the teacher should be ready to recommend books which have all the attractive adventure features of the \"dime novel,\" and which have in addition sound artistic and ethical qualities. While many such books are mentioned in the bibliographies in the latter part of this text, it has seemed well to bring together here a short list of those which librarians over the country have found particularly fitted to serve as substitutes for the dime novel.

Strong for the red rage of battle; sane, for I harry them sore;     Send me men girt for the combat, men who are grit to the core;     Swift as the panther in triumph, fierce as the bear in defeat,     Sired of a bulldog parent, steeled in the furnace heat.     Send me the best of your breeding, lend me your chosen ones;     Them will I take to my bosom, them will I call my sons;     Them will I gild with my treasure, them will I glut with my meat;     But the others--the misfits, the failures--I trample under my feet.     Dissolute, damned, and despairful, crippled and palsied and slain,     Ye would send me the spawn of your gutters--Go! take back your spawn           again.      \"Wild and wide are my borders, stern as death is my sway;     From my ruthless throne I have ruled alone for a million years and a           day;     Hugging my mighty treasure, waiting for man to come:     Till he swept like a turbid torrent, and after him swept--the scum.     The pallid pimp of the dead-line, the enervate of the pen,     One by one I weeded them out, for all that I sought was--Men.     One by one I dismayed them, frighting them sore with my glooms;     One by one I betrayed them unto my manifold dooms.     Drowned them like rats in my rivers, starved them like curs on my           plains,     Rotted the flesh that was left them, poisoned the blood in their veins;     Burst with my winter upon them, searing forever their sight,     Lashed them with fungus-white faces, whimpering wild in the night;     Staggering blind through the storm-whirl, stumbling mad through the           snow,     Frozen stiff in the ice pack, brittle and bent like a bow;     Featureless, formless, forsaken, scented by wolves in their flight,     Left for the wind to make music through ribs that are glittering white;     Gnawing the black crust of failure, searching the pit of despair,     Crooking the toe in the trigger, trying to patter a prayer;     Going outside with an escort, raving with lips all afoam;     Writing a cheque for a million, drivelling feebly of home;     Lost like a louse in the burning ... or else in tented town     Seeking a drunkard's solace, sinking and sinking down;     Steeped in the slime at the bottom, dead to a decent world,     Lost 'mid the human flotsam, far on the frontier hurled;     In the camp at the bend of the river, with its dozen saloons aglare,     Its gambling dens a-riot, its gramophones all a-blare;     Crimped with the crimes of a city, sin-ridden and bridled with lies,     In the hush of my mountained vastness, in the flush of my midnight           skies.     Plague-spots, yet tools of my purpose, so natheless I suffer them           thrive,     Crushing my Weak in their clutches, that only my Strong may survive.      \"But the others, the men of my mettle, the men who would 'stablish           my fame,     Unto its ultimate issue, winning me honour, not shame;     Searching my uttermost valleys, fighting each step as they go,     Shooting the wrath of my rapids, scaling my ramparts of snow;     Ripping the guts of my mountains, looting the beds of my creeks,     Them will I take to my bosom, and speak as a mother speaks.     I am the land that listens, I am the land that broods;     Steeped in eternal beauty, crystalline waters and woods.     Long have I waited lonely, shunned as a thing accurst,     Monstrous, moody, pathetic, the last of the lands and the first;     Visioning camp-fires at twilight, sad with a longing forlorn,     Feeling my womb o'er-pregnant with the seed of cities unborn.     Wild and wide are my borders, stern as death is my sway,     And I wait for the men who will win me--and I will not be won in a day;     And I will not be won by weaklings, subtile, suave, and mild,     But by men with the hearts of vikings, and the simple faith of a child;     Desperate, strong, and resistless, unthrottled by fear or defeat,     Them will I gild with my treasure, them will I glut with my meat.      \"Lofty I stand from each sister land, patient and wearily wise,     With the weight of a world of sadness in my quiet, passionless eyes;     Dreaming alone of a people, dreaming alone of a day,     When men shall not rape my riches, and curse me and go away;     Making a bawd of my bounty, fouling the hand that gave--     Till I rise in my wrath and I sweep on their path and I stamp them           into a grave.     Dreaming of men who will bless me, of women esteeming me good,     Of children born in my borders, of radiant motherhood;     Of cities leaping to stature, of fame like a flag unfurled,     As I pour the tide of my riches in the eager lap of the world.\"      This is the Law of the Yukon, that only the Strong shall thrive;     That surely the Weak shall perish, and only the Fit survive.     Dissolute, damned, and despairful, crippled and palsied and slain,     This is the Will of the Yukon,--Lo! how she makes it plain!     THE PARSON'S SON       _This is the song of the parson's son, as he squats in his shack alone,     On the wild, weird nights when the Northern Lights shoot up from the           frozen zone,     And it's sixty below, and couched in the snow the hungry huskies moan._      \"I'm one of the Arctic brotherhood, I'm an old-time pioneer.     I came with the first--O God! how I've cursed this Yukon--but still           I'm here.     I've sweated athirst in its summer heat, I've frozen and starved in           its cold;     I've followed my dreams by its thousand streams, I've toiled and           moiled for its gold.      \"Look at my eyes--been snow-blind twice; look where my foot's half           gone;     And that gruesome scar on my left cheek where the frost-fiend bit to           the bone.     Each one a brand of this devil's land, where I've played and I've           lost the game,     A broken wreck with a craze for 'hooch,' and never a cent to my name.      \"This mining is only a gamble, the worst is as good as the best;     I was in with the bunch and I might have come out right on top with           the rest;     With"]]]
