No, after the sun;      Trying to catch hold of his glittering skirts      That hang upon the mountain as he goes.       FIFE.      Ah, he's himself past catching--as you spoke      He heard what you were saying, and--just so--      Like some scared water-bird,      As we say in my country, _dove_ below.       ROS.      Well, we must follow him as best we may.      Poland is no great country, and, as rich      In men and means, will but few acres spare      To lie beneath her barrier mountains bare.      We cannot, I believe, be very far      From mankind or their dwellings.       FIFE.      Send it so!      And well provided for man, woman, and beast.      No, not for beast. Ah, but my heart begins      To yearn for her--       ROS.      Keep close, and keep your feet      From serving you as hers did.       FIFE.      As for beasts,      If in default of other entertainment,      We should provide them with ourselves to eat--      Bears, lions, wolves--       ROS.      Oh, never fear.       FIFE.      Or else,      Default of other beasts, beastlier men,      Cannibals, Anthropophagi, bare Poles      Who never knew a tailor but by taste.       ROS.      Look, look! Unless my fancy misconceive      With twilight--down among the rocks there, Fife--      Some human dwelling, surely--      Or think you but a rock torn from the rocks      In some convulsion like to-day's, and perch'd      Quaintly among them in mock-masonry?       FIFE.      Most likely that, I doubt.       ROS.      No, no--for look!      A square of darkness opening in it--       FIFE.      Oh, I don't half like such openings!--       ROS.      Like the loom      Of night from which she spins her outer gloom--       FIFE.      Lord, Madam, pray forbear this tragic vein      In such a time and place--       ROS.      And now again      Within that square of darkness, look! a light      That feels its way with hesitating pulse,      As we do, through the darkness that it drives      To blacken into deeper night beyond.       FIFE.      In which could we follow that light's example,      As might some English Bardolph with his nose,      We might defy the sunset--Hark, a chain!       ROS.      And now a lamp, a lamp! And now the hand      That carries it.       FIFE.      Oh, Lord! that dreadful chain!       ROS.      And now the bearer of the lamp; indeed      As strange as any in Arabian tale,      So giant-like, and terrible, and grand,      Spite of the skin he's wrapt in.       FIFE.      Why, 'tis his own:      Oh, 'tis some wild man of the woods; I've heard      They build and carry torches--       ROS.      Never Ape      Bore such a brow before the heavens as that--      Chain'd as you say too!--       FIFE.      Oh, that dreadful chain!       ROS.      And now he sets the lamp down by his side,      And with one hand clench'd in his tangled hair      And with a sigh as if his heart would break--       (During this Segismund has entered from the fortress, with a           torch.)       SEGISMUND.      Once more the storm has roar'd itself away,      Splitting the crags of God as it retires;      But sparing still what it should only blast,      This guilty piece of human handiwork,      And all that are within it. Oh, how oft,      How oft, within or here abroad, have I      Waited, and in the whisper of my heart      Pray'd for the slanting hand of heaven to strike      The blow myself I dared not, out of fear      Of that Hereafter, worse, they say, than here,      Plunged headlong in, but, till dismissal waited,      To wipe at last all sorrow from men's eyes,      And make this heavy dispensation clear.      Thus have I borne till now, and still endure,      Crouching in sullen impotence day by day,      Till some such out-burst of the elements      Like this rouses the sleeping fire within;      And standing thus upon the threshold of      Another night about to close the door      Upon one wretched day to open it      On one yet wretcheder because one more;--      Once more, you savage heavens, I ask of you--      I, looking up to those relentless eyes      That, now the greater lamp is gone below,      Begin to muster in the listening skies;      In all the shining circuits you have gone      About this theatre of human woe,      What greater sorrow have you gazed upon      Than down this narrow chink you witness still;      And which, did you yourselves not fore-devise,      You registered for others to fulfil!       FIFE.      This is some Laureate at a birthday ode;      No wonder we went rhyming.       ROS.      Hush! And now      See, starting to his feet, he strides about      Far as his tether'd steps--       SEG.      And if the chain      You help'd to rivet round me did contract      Since guiltless infancy from guilt in act;      Of what in aspiration or in thought      Guilty, but in resentment of the wrong      That wreaks revenge on wrong I never wrought      By excommunication from the free      Inheritance that all created life,      Beside myself, is born to--from the wings      That range your own immeasurable blue,      Down to the poor, mute, scale-imprison'd things,      That yet are free to wander, glide, and pass      About that under-sapphire, whereinto      Yourselves transfusing you yourselves englass!       ROS.      What mystery is this?       FIFE.      Why, the man's mad:      That's all the mystery. That's why he's chain'd--      And why--       SEG.      Nor Nature's guiltless life alone--      But that which lives on blood and rapine; nay,      Charter'd with larger liberty to slay      Their guiltless kind, the tyrants of the air      Soar zenith-upward with their screaming prey,      Making pure heaven drop blood upon the stage      Of under earth, where lion, wolf, and bear,      And they that on their treacherous velvet wear      Figure and constellation like your own,      With their still living slaughter bound away      Over the barriers of the mountain cage,      Against which one, blood-guiltless, and endued      With aspiration and with aptitude      Transcending other creatures, day by day      Beats himself mad with unavailing rage!       FIFE.      Why, that must be the meaning of my mule's      Rebellion--       ROS.      Hush!       SEG.      But then if murder be      The law by which not only conscience-blind      Creatures, but man too prospers with his kind;      Who leaving all his guilty fellows free,      Under your fatal auspice and divine      Compulsion, leagued in some mysterious ban      Against one innocent and helpless man,      Abuse their liberty to murder mine:      And sworn to silence, like their masters mute      In heaven, and like them twirling through the mask      Of darkness, answering to all I ask,      Point up to them whose work they execute!       ROS.      Ev'n as I thought, some poor unhappy wretch,      By man wrong'd, wretched, unrevenged, as I!      Nay, so much worse than I, as by those chains      Clipt of the means of self-revenge on those      Who lay on him what they deserve. And I,      Who taunted Heaven a little while ago      With pouring all its wrath upon my head--      Alas! like him who caught the cast-off husk      Of what another bragg'd of feeding on,      Here's one that from the refuse of my sorrows      Could gather all the banquet he desires!      Poor soul, poor soul!       FIFE.      Speak lower--he will hear you.       ROS.      And if he should, what then? Why, if he would,      He could not harm me--Nay, and if he could,      Methinks I'd venture something of a life      I care so little for--       SEG.      Who's that? Clotaldo? Who are you, I say,      That, venturing in these forbidden rocks,      Have lighted on my miserable life,      And your own death?       ROS.      You would not hurt me, surely?       SEG.      Not I; but those that, iron as the chain      In which they slay me with a lingering death,      Will slay you with a sudden--Who are you?       ROS.      A stranger from across the mountain there,      Who, having lost his way in this strange land      And coming night, drew hither to what seem'd      A human dwelling hidden in these rocks,      And where the voice of human sorrow soon      Told him it was so.       SEG.      Ay? But nearer--nearer--      That by this smoky supplement of day      But for a moment I may see who speaks      So pitifully sweet.       FIFE.      Take care! take care!       ROS.      Alas, poor man, that I, myself so helpless,      Could better help you than by barren pity,      And my poor presence--       SEG.      Oh, might that be all!      But that--a few poor moments--and, alas!      The very bliss of having, and the dread      Of losing, under such a penalty      As every moment's having runs more near,      Stifles the very utterance and resource      They cry for quickest; till from sheer despair      Of holding thee, methinks myself would tear      To pieces--       FIFE.      There, his word's enough for it.       SEG.      Oh, think, if you who move about at will,      And live in sweet communion with your kind,      After an hour lost in these lonely rocks      Hunger and thirst after some human voice      To drink, and human face to feed upon;      What must one do where all is mute, or harsh,      And ev'n the naked face of cruelty      Were better than the mask it works beneath?--      Across the mountain then! Across the mountain!      What if the next world which they tell one of      Be only next across the mountain then,      Though I must never see it till I die,      And you one of its angels?       ROS.      Alas; alas!      No angel! And the face you think so fair,      'Tis but the dismal frame-work of these rocks      That makes it seem so; and the world I come from--      Alas, alas, too many faces there      Are but fair vizors to black hearts below,      Or only serve to bring the wearer woe!

Ask of them,      Whom, as to-night, I have so often ask'd,      And ask'd in vain.       ROS.      But surely, surely--       SEG.      Hark!      The trumpet of the watch to shut us in.      Oh, should they find you!--Quick! Behind the rocks!      To-morrow--if to-morrow--       ROS. (flinging her sword toward him).      Take my sword!

Within there!       (Enter Soldiers with black vizors and torches)       FIFE.      Here's a pleasant masquerade!       CLO.      Whosever watch this was      Will have to pay head-reckoning.

Here are two of them,      Whoever more to follow--       CLO.      Who are you,      That in defiance of known proclamation      Are found, at night-fall too, about this place?       FIFE.      Oh, my Lord, she--I mean he--       ROS.      Silence, Fife,      And let me speak for both.--Two foreign men,      To whom your country and its proclamations      Are equally unknown; and had we known,      Ourselves not masters of our lawless beasts      That, terrified by the storm among your rocks,      Flung us upon them to our cost.       FIFE.      My mule--       CLO.      Foreigners? Of what country?       ROS.      Muscovy.       CLO.      And whither bound?       ROS.      Hither--if this be Poland;      But with no ill design on her, and therefore      Taking it ill that we should thus be stopt      Upon her threshold so uncivilly.       CLO.      Whither in Poland?       ROS.      To the capital.       CLO.      And on what errand?       ROS.      Set me on the road,      And you shall be the nearer to my answer.       CLO. (aside).      So resolute and ready to reply,      And yet so young--and--      (Aloud.)      Well,--      Your business was not surely with the man      We found you with?       ROS.      He was the first we saw,--      And strangers and benighted, as we were,      As you too would have done in a like case,      Accosted him at once.       CLO.      Ay, but this sword?       ROS.      I flung it toward him.       CLO.      Well, and why?       ROS.      And why? But to revenge himself on those who thus      Injuriously misuse him.       CLO.      So--so--so!      'Tis well such resolution wants a beard      And, I suppose, is never to attain one.      Well, I must take you both, you and your sword,      Prisoners.       FIFE. (offering a cudgel).      Pray take mine, and welcome, sir;      I'm sure I gave it to that mule of mine      To mighty little purpose.       ROS.      Mine you have;      And may it win us some more kindliness      Than we have met with yet.       CLO (examining the sword).      More mystery!      How came you by this weapon?       ROS.      From my father.       CLO.      And do you know whence he?       ROS.      Oh, very well:      From one of this same Polish realm of yours,      Who promised a return, should come the chance,      Of courtesies that he received himself      In Muscovy, and left this pledge of it--      Not likely yet, it seems, to be redeem'd.       CLO (aside).      Oh, wondrous chance--or wondrous Providence!      The sword that I myself in Muscovy,      When these white hairs were black, for keepsake left      Of obligation for a like return      To him who saved me wounded as I lay      Fighting against his country; took me home;      Tended me like a brother till recover'd,      Perchance to fight against him once again      And now my sword put back into my hand      By his--if not his son--still, as so seeming,      By me, as first devoir of gratitude,      To seem believing, till the wearer's self      See fit to drop the ill-dissembling mask.      (Aloud.)      Well, a strange turn of fortune has arrested      The sharp and sudden penalty that else      Had visited your rashness or mischance:      In part, your tender youth too--pardon me,      And touch not where your sword is not to answer--      Commends you to my care; not your life only,      Else by this misadventure forfeited;      But ev'n your errand, which, by happy chance,      Chimes with the very business I am on,      And calls me to the very point you aim at.       ROS.      The capital?       CLO.      Ay, the capital; and ev'n      That capital of capitals, the Court:      Where you may plead, and, I may promise, win      Pardon for this, you say unwilling, trespass,      And prosecute what else you have at heart,      With me to help you forward all I can;      Provided all in loyalty to those      To whom by natural allegiance      I first am bound to.       ROS.      As you make, I take      Your offer: with like promise on my side      Of loyalty to you and those you serve,      Under like reservation for regards      Nearer and dearer still.       CLO.      Enough, enough;      Your hand; a bargain on both sides. Meanwhile,      Here shall you rest to-night. The break of day      Shall see us both together on the way.       ROS.      Thus then what I for misadventure blamed,      Directly draws me where my wishes aim'd.       (Exeunt.)     SCENE II.--The Palace at Warsaw   Enter on one side Astolfo, Duke of Muscovy, with his train: and, on the other, the Princess Estrella, with hers.       ASTOLFO.      My royal cousin, if so near in blood,      Till this auspicious meeting scarcely known,      Till all that beauty promised in the bud      Is now to its consummate blossom blown,      Well met at last; and may--       ESTRELLA.      Enough, my Lord,      Of compliment devised for you by some      Court tailor, and, believe me, still too short      To cover the designful heart below.       AST.      Nay, but indeed, fair cousin--       EST.      Ay, let Deed      Measure your words, indeed your flowers of speech      Ill with your iron equipage atone;      Irony indeed, and wordy compliment.       AST.      Indeed, indeed, you wrong me, royal cousin,      And fair as royal, misinterpreting      What, even for the end you think I aim at,      If false to you, were fatal to myself.       EST.      Why, what else means the glittering steel, my Lord,      That bristles in the rear of these fine words?      What can it mean, but, failing to cajole,      To fight or force me from my just pretension?       AST.      Nay, might I not ask ev'n the same of you,      The nodding helmets of whose men-at-arms      Out-crest the plumage of your lady court?       EST.      But to defend what yours would force from me.       AST.      Might not I, lady, say the same of mine?      But not to come to battle, ev'n of words,      With a fair lady, and my kinswoman;      And as averse to stand before your face,      Defenceless, and condemn'd in your disgrace,      Till the good king be here to clear it all--      Will you vouchsafe to hear me?       EST.      As you will.       AST.      You know that, when about to leave this world,      Our royal grandsire, King Alfonso, left      Three children; one a son, Basilio,      Who wears--long may he wear! the crown of Poland;      And daughters twain: of whom the elder was      Your mother, Clorilena, now some while      Exalted to a more than mortal throne;      And Recisunda, mine, the younger sister,      Who, married to the Prince of Muscovy,      Gave me the light which may she live to see      Herself for many, many years to come.      Meanwhile, good King Basilio, as you know,      Deep in abstruser studies than this world,      And busier with the stars than lady's eyes,      Has never by a second marriage yet      Replaced, as Poland ask'd of him, the heir      An early marriage brought and took away;      His young queen dying with the son she bore him;      And in such alienation grown so old      As leaves no other hope of heir to Poland      Than his two sisters' children; you, fair cousin,      And me; for whom the Commons of the realm      Divide themselves into two several factions;      Whether for you, the elder sister's child;      Or me, born of the younger, but, they say,      My natural prerogative of man      Outweighing your priority of birth.      Which discord growing loud and dangerous,      Our uncle, King Basilio, doubly sage      In prophesying and providing for      The future, as to deal with it when come,      Bids us here meet to-day in solemn council      Our several pretensions to compose.      And, but the martial out-burst that proclaims      His coming, makes all further parley vain,      Unless my bosom, by which only wise      I prophesy, now wrongly prophesies,      By such a happy compact as I dare      But glance at till the Royal Sage declare.       (Trumpets, etc. Enter King Basilio with his Council.)       ALL.      The King! God save the King!       ESTRELLA (Kneeling.)      Oh, Royal Sir!--       ASTOLFO (Kneeling.)      God save your Majesty--       KING.      Rise both of you,      Rise to my arms, Astolfo and Estrella;      As my two sisters' children always mine,      Now more than ever, since myself and Poland      Solely to you for our succession look'd.      And now give ear, you and your several factions,      And you, the Peers and Princes of this realm,      While I reveal the purport of this meeting      In words whose necessary length I"]]]
