My duty--to a father's love betrayed      Hath of thy sire a fond accomplice made;      A healing balm I bring for all thy fears,      I look for thanks, and lo--thou giv'st me tears!       PAUL.      I give no thanks--no cause for thanks I find;      I know the Christian temper--know their mind,      They can blaspheme, but ah, they cannot lie!      They know not how to yield--but they can die!       FELIX.      As bird in hand, he holds his pardon still.       PAUL.      The bird escapes, when 'tis the owner's will.       FELIX.      He death escapes--if so he do elect.       PAUL.      He death embraces--as doth all his sect.      Is't thus a father pleads for his own son?       FELIX.      Who wills his death is by himself undone.       PAUL.      He cannot see!       FELIX.      Because he chooses night.      Who loves the darkness hateth still the light.       PAUL.      O, by the Gods--       FELIX.      Nay, daughter, save thy breath;      Spurned--outraged--'tis the Gods demand his death.       PAUL.      They hear our prayers--       FELIX.      Nay, then let Polyeucte pray!       PAUL.      Since Decius gives thee power,--that word unsay!       FELIX.      He gives me power, Pauline, to do his will      Against his foes--'gainst all who work him ill.       PAUL.      Is Polyeucte his foe?       FELIX.      All Christians rebels are.       PAUL.      Thy son shall plead more loud than policy or war.      For mine is thine; O father, save thine own--       FELIX.      The son who is a traitor I disown!      For treason is a crime without redress,      'Gainst which all else sinks into nothingness.       PAUL.      Too great thy rigour!       FELIX.      Yet more great his guilt.       PAUL.      Too true my dream! Must his dear blood be spilt?      With Polyeucte, I too--thy child--shall fall!       FELIX.      The Gods--the Emperor--rule over all.       PAUL.      O hear our dying supplication--hear!       FELIX.      Not Jove alone, but Decius I fear:--      But why anticipate a doom so sad?      Shall this--his blindness--make thy Polyeucte mad?      Fresh Christian zeal remains not always new,      The sight of death compels a saner view.       PAUL.      O, if thou lov'st him still, all hope forsake!      In one day can he two conversions make?      Not this the Christians' mould: they never change;      His heart is fixed--past power of man to estrange.      This is no poison quaffed all unawares,      What martyrs do and dare--that Polyeucte dares;      He saw the lure by which he was enticed,      He thinks the universe well lost for Christ.      I know the breed; I know their courage high,      They love the cross,--so, for the cross, they die.      We see two stakes of wood, the felon's shame,      They see a halo round one matchless Name.      To powers of earth, and hell, and torture blind,      In death, for Him they love, they rapture find.      They joy in agony,--our gain their loss,      To die for Christ they count the world but dross:      Our rack their crown, our pain their highest pleasure,      And in the world's contempt they find their treasure.      Their cherished heritage is--martyrdom!       FELIX.      Let then this heir into his kingdom come! No more!--       PAUL.      O father!       (Enter Albin.)       FELIX.      Albin, is it done?       ALBIN.      It is,--Nearchus' frantic race is run!       FELIX.      And with what eye saw Polyeucte the sight?       ALBIN.      With envious eye,--as one who sees a light      That lures him, moth-like, to devouring flame.      His heart is fixed, his mind is still the same.       PAUL.      'Tis as I said--oh, father, yet once more      If thou hast ever loved me,--I implore!      Let filial duty and obedience plead      For his dear life! To my last prayer give heed!       FELIX.      Too much thou lovest an unworthy lord!       PAUL.      Thou gavest him my hand, 'twas at thy word      I gave both love and duty; what I give      I take not back; oh, Polyeucte must live!      For his dear sake I quenched another flame      Most pure. Is he my lord alone in name?      O, by my blind and swift obedience paid      To thy command--be thy hard words unsaid!      I gave thee all a daughter had to give,      Grant, father, this one prayer--Let Polyeucte live!      By thy stern power, which now I only fear,      Make thou that power benignant, honoured, dear!      Thou gav'st that gift unsought,--that gift restore!      I claim it at the giver's hand once more!       FELIX.      Importunate! Although my heart is soft,      It is not wax,--and these entreaties oft      Repeated waste thy breath, and vex mine ear,      For man is deaf to what he will not hear.      _I am the master!_ This let all men know,      And if thou force that note thou'lt find 'tis so.      Prepare to see thy cursed Christian fool,      Do thou caress when I have scourged the mule,--      Go! vex no more a loving father's ear,      From Polyeucte's self win what thou hold'st so dear.       PAUL.      In pity!----       FELIX.      Leave me, leave me here alone!--      Say more--my goaded heart will turn to stone;      Vex me no more--I will not be denied!      Go, save thy madman from his suicide!       (Exit Pauline.)       How met Nearchus death?       ALBIN.      The fiend abhorred      He hailed,--embraced: 'For Christ!' his latest word;      No sigh, no tear,--he passed without amaze      Adown the narrow vale with upward gaze.       FELIX.      And he--his friend?       ALBIN.      Is, as I said, unmoved      He looks on death but as a friend beloved,      He clasped the scaffold as a guide most sure,      And, in his prison, he can still endure.       FELIX.      Oh, wretched that I am!       ALBIN.      All pity thee.       FELIX.      With reason greater than they know. Ah, me!      Thought surges upon thought, and has its will,      Care, gnawing upon care, my soul must kill;      Love--hate--fear--pain: I am of each the prey,      I grope for light, but never find the day!      Oh, what I suffer thou canst not conceive,      Each passion rages, but can ne'er relieve;      For I have noble thoughts that die still-born,      And I have thoughts so base my soul I scorn.      I love the foolish wretch who is my son,      I hate the folly which hath all undone;      I mourn his death,--yet, if I Polyeucte save,      I see of all my hopes the cruel grave!      'Gainst Gods and Emperor too sore the strife,      For my renown I fear,--fear for my life.      I must myself undo to save my son,      For, should I spare him, then am I undone!       ALBIN.      Decius a father is, and must excuse      A father's love--oh, he will not refuse!       FELIX.      His edict is most clear:--'All Christians are my foes.'      The higher be their rank the more the evil grows.      If birth and state be high, their crime shows more notorious,      If he who shield be great, his fall the more inglorious;      And if I give Nearchus to the flame      Yet stoop to shield my own--thrice damned my name!       ALBIN.      If by thy fiat he cannot escape the grave,      Implore of Decius' grace the life thou canst not save.       FELIX.      So would Severus work my ruin quite--      I fear his power, his wrath,--for might is right--      If crime with punishment I do not mate.      How high soe'er, worth what it may, I fear his hate,      For he is man, and feels as man, and I      Once spurned his suit with base indignity.      Yes, he at Decius' ear would work may woe,      He loves Pauline, thus Polyeucte is his foe:      All weapons possible to love and war,      And those who let them rust but laggards are.      I fear--and fear doth give our vision scope--      E'en now he cherisheth a tender hope;      He sees his rival prostrate in the dust,      So, as a man he hopes--because he must.      Can dark despair to love and hope give place      To save the guilty from deserved disgrace?      And were his worth so matchless, so divine,      As to forbear all ill to me and mine      Still I must own the base, the coward hope,      'Gainst which my strength is all too weak to cope,      That hope whose phoenix ashes yet enthrall      The wretch who rises but once more to fall;      Ambition is my master, iron Fate,      I feel, obey, adore thee, while I hate!      Polyeucte was once my guard, my pride, my shield,      Yet can I, by Severus, weapons wield,      Should he my daughter wed, more tried, more true:      What wills Severus--that will Decius do.      Upheld by him, e'en Fortune I defy      And yet I shrink!--for them, thrice base were I!       ALBIN.      Perish the word! It ne'er was made for thee,      But wilt thou deal just meed to treachery?       FELIX.      I go to Polyeucte's cell,--though my poor breath      Should there be spent in vain to avert his death;      Then, then my fated child her strength shall try.       ALBIN.      What wilt thou do if both he still defy?       FELIX.      O, press me not in agony so great!      To thee alone I turn--resistless Fate!     ACT IV--POLYEUCTE. CLEON. THREE OTHER GUARDS       POLY.      What is thy will?       CLEON.      Pauline would see my lord.       POLY.      Ah, how my heart quails at that single word!      Thee, Felix, I o'ercame within my cell,      Laughed at thy threats if death and torture fell;      Yet hast thou still one arm to rouse my fears,      The rest I scorn, but dread thy daughter's tears!      One only talisman remains; great God, 'tis mine,      Sufficient for my every need His strength divine!      O thou, dear saint, thy scars all healed, white-robed, in           glory crowned,      Plead that I too may victory win, thou who hast victory found!      Nearchus, who hast clasped in Heaven that dear, that pierced hand,      Plead that thy friend, who wrestles here, may safely by"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2543"],["title","Polyeucte (#6)"],["body","stand!      Ye Guards, one last kind service, I would ask,      Well may ye grant it, 'tis an easy task:      I do not seek deliverance from these thralls,      (Looks at his chains.)      I do not care to scale my prison walls,      But, since three warriors armed can surely guard      One fettered man in safest watch and ward,      Go one, and beg of great Severus' grace      That he would deign to meet me face to face;      To him would I a secret now impart,      Which much concerns his joy and peace of heart.       CLEON.      On willing foot, my lord, do I obey.       POLY.      Severus must this kindly service pay;      Ah, lose no time, time now has fleetest wings.       CLEON.      Full soon to thee thy prayer Severus brings.       (Exit Cleon. Guardsmen retire to background.)       POLY.      The fount is pure, yet bitter waters flow,      Sin taints--men poison what was made all fair.      They will not choose immortal streams: they go      To seek for pleasure--but find only care:      Their pleasure wed to strife--ah, death the gate of life,--      Christ's servants, none but they His crown shall wear!      So pain      Is gain:      Count not the cost!      The world well lost,      His Heaven to share!      O Pleasure, think not that I sigh for thee,      Thy charms, that once enslaved, no more delight;      In Christ's dear name I bid the tempter flee,      His foes are mine,--unlovely in my sight.      The mighty from their seat He hurls beneath His feet,      His fan is in His hand, His vengeful sword is bright.      Their crown      Cast down.      All hopes most dear      They cherish here      Shall end in night.      O Decius! Tiger! Pitiless! Athirst      With quenchless rage, for blood of Christ's redeemed--      Armenia shall arise, by thee accursed,      On her at last has Light of Asia beamed,      And our Deliverer from the holy east      Shall dash the cup from thy Belshazzar feast!      Secure,      And pure,      Christ's saints shall reign,      And, purged by pain,      For aye endure!      Let Felix sacrifice me to thine ire,      Yea, let my rival captivate the soul      Of her who now with Decius doth conspire      To chain immortal hope to earthly goal;      Let earth-bound men pursue the world's desire,      Sense charms not him who doth to Heaven aspire!      Hail pain!      Disdain      All Earthly love,      To seek above      A holier fire!      Oh, Love that passeth knowledge be my stay,      And fire my heart to beat alone for thee!      Sun of my soul?--oh, flash one purest ray      In that last hour supreme--to comfort me,      So life's brief night shall merge in endless day!      Come, Death!      Last breath      Shall praise thy name,      The same, the same,      For aye! For aye!      O heavenly fire, most pure, embracing all,      Come, shield me from Pauline, else must I fall!      I see her, but no more as once I saw--      I am encased in armour without flaw:      To eyes that gaze alone on heavenly light,      Naught else is pure, or dear, or fair, or bright!       (Enter Pauline)       With what intent, Pauline, hast thou come here?      Have I a friend to aid, or foe to fear?      Is it Christ's soldier that thou com'st to greet?      Or wouldst thou sink my triumph in defeat?      If thou wouldst bid me spurn the debt I owe,      Not Decius, but Pauline, my deadliest foe!       PAUL.      All, save thyself, to thee, my love, are friends:      Love but thyself, love me,--thy torment ends.      Alone thou seal'st thy doom, alone wouldst shed      That blood by all Armenia honoured.      Yes, thou art saved, if thou for mercy plead;      Demand thy death, and thou are lost indeed.      Think of the worth of this self-hated life,      And think in pity of Pauline,--thy wife!      Think of the people that their prince adores,      Think of the honours Felix on thee pours!      Oh, I am nothing, nothing unto thee,      But, husband, think how dear thou art to me!      Think how the path of glory on thee opes,      Thou dearest lodestar of a nation's hopes!      Shall blood of kings be but the headsman's sport?      Is life a toy wherewith thy death to court?       POLY.      I think of more than this; I know what thou wouldst say.      Our life is ours to use, and we that debt must pay.      What life is this men love? An idle, empty dream,      Where nothing can endure,--where all things only seem.      Death ends their every joy which fickle Fortune leaves,      They gain a royal throne to learn how pomp deceives;      They gather wealth that men may envy their estate,      They clear a path by blood, so envy turns to hate.      Such vast ambition mine as Caesar never knew,      Death bounds it not, for death is but its servant true.      Peace that the world ne'er gave, and cannot take away,      That peace, Pauline, is mine, mine wholly, mine for aye!      Nor time, nor fate, nor chance, nor cruel war,      Can touch this peace, or this my kingdom mar.      Is this poor life--the creature of a day      For endless peace too great a price to pay?       PAUL.      'Out on these Christian dreams!' my reason cries;      Whene'er they speak of truth, they utter lies.      Thou say'st: 'To win such prize my life is naught!'      But is thy life thine own? How was it bought?      Our life an heirloom to our country due;      What gave thee birth, demands thy service too?      Pay, then thy debt to her who has the right!       POLY.      Ah, for my country I would gladly fight!      I know the glory of a hero's name,      I feel the thrill,--I recognise the claim.      My life I owe to whom I owe my sword--      But most to Him who gave it--to the Lord!      Oh, if to die for fatherland be sweet,      To die for Him--my God--what word is meet?       PAUL.      Which God?       POLY.      Hush! hush! Pauline; the God who hears      And answers prayers,--gives hopes, assuages fears.      Thy gods are deaf and senseless, maimed and weak,      Tongues, mouths they have, and yet they cannot speak.      The Christians' God alone is mine,--is thine,      Jehovah only rules--supreme--divine!       PAUL.      Adore Him in thy heart, but say no word!       POLY.      What! Can I call Jove and Jehovah--Lord?       PAUL.      One moment feign. Ah, let Severus go!      Let but my father all his kindness show!       POLY.      Another Father mine! His love most dear      Removes me from a world begirt with fear.      For life's stern race too weak, too frail am I,      So, by kind death, He gives me Victory.      Pure from the holy font--(His mercies never fail!)      He brings His barque to port, when it hath scarce set sail.      Couldst thou but understand how poor this earth,      Couldst thou but grasp how great this second birth!      And yet, why speak of treasure rare concealed      From one to whom light is yet unrevealed?       PAUL.      O cruel! I can strangle pain no more!      Is this the fruit of all thy heavenly lore?      They say thy Christ His enemies did bless,      Thou addest insult to my deep distress.      How is my soul so dark--which was so fair?--      Thou call'dst me 'lovely'--'dear'--'beyond compare!'--      Of my bereavement have I said no word,      I stilled my grief that I might soothe my lord!      They say that love has wings, and all they say is true,      For all thy love has flown; yet can I ne'er undo      The vows I made, the troth I plighted binds me still!      Thou fain wouldst quit thy wife, and thou shalt have thy will.      Oh, but to leave my side with rapture, ecstasy,      No jealous Christ can will: why grudge me one poor sigh?      This joy, this transport fierce, endeavour to conceal.      I do not share thy creed, but I, at least, can feel!      Why gloat o'er heavenly gain, crowns, palms, I know not what--      Where Polyeucte is blest, but where Pauline is not?      Soul, body, spirit, I am thy true wife, to own      That I am but a bar to happiness unknown!       POLY.      Alas!       PAUL.      O! that 'Alas!'--so faint, so tame!      Yet, if repentant from thy heart it came,      'Twould waken hope, still brief, and banish fears:      I wait the birth of thy reluctant tears.       POLY.      These tears I shed! O, might the Spirit pour      Through them the light, the light that I adore--      Then were my only grief all swept away,      For thou wouldst join me in the realms of day!      Else Heaven itself would have its bitterness,      Should I look down to witness thy distress!      O God, who lov'st the dust on which Thy breath      Hath stamped Thine image true--save her from death!      The only death that kills, and let my love      From Heaven woo her to the realms above!      Lord, hear my call! My inmost heart now see,      Who lives a Christian life must Christian be!      Her nature god-like, stamped from print divine;      She must be sealed Thine own, yes, only Thine!      Say, must she burn, condemned to depths of hell?--      Thy Will be done--Who doest all things well!       PAUL.      O wretch, what words are these? Thou dost desire----       POLY.      To snatch thee from a never-ending fire.       PAUL.      Or else?       POLY.      O God, I trust to Thy control,      Who when we think not, canst illume the soul!      The when--the how--is His--here am I dumb,--      I wait--I wait--That blessed hour will come!       PAUL.      Oh, leave illusions! Love me!       POLY.      Thee I love      Far more than self, but less than God above!       PAUL.      For love's dear sake, ah, listen to my prayer!       POLY.      For love's dear sake--await the answer _there_!       PAUL.      To leave me here is naught! Thou wouldst seduce my soul!       POLY.      Heaven is scarce Heaven for me, if thou reach not the goal.       PAUL.      O fancy-fooled!       POLY.      Nay, led by heavenly light!       PAUL.      Thy faith is blindness!       POLY.      Faith is more than sight!       PAUL.      Ah,"]]]
