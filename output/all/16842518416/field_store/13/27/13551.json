Susy's mocking-bird hung in a cage by one of the windows, and \"brother Zip\" was lounging in an arm-chair, catching flies.  After everybody was comfortably seated, and had said \"Good morning,\" then a \"silent blessing,\" according to the custom of the Friends, was asked upon the food. All sat with folded hands, and eyes reverently fixed upon their plates. Dotty knew very well they were asking to be made thankful for the excellent breakfast before them. She repeated to herself several times the sentence she had been taught; for, in spite of her intention to be naughty, she dared not omit it. When Mr. Parlin began to pass the butter, she was still looking at her plate, and startled the whole family by saying aloud, \"Amen!\"  Grandma looked at the little girl with surprise and disapproval. Dotty blushed painfully. She had not meant to be irreverent. Next moment she thought,--  \"Now they all s'pose I did that _to purpose_! I don't care if they do! I'll act worse'n that! I wonder what my father'd say if I should jump right up and down, and scream?\"  It certainly was not safe to try the experiment. Dotty contented herself by scowling at her dry toast.  But after her father had gone away to his business, and her mother had begun to make preserves in the kitchen, she went down cellar, into the wash-room, and began to tease Norah. Norah, who was fond of the child, and in general very good-natured, was not in a mood this morning to be trifled with.  \"Indeed, Miss Flippet,\" said she, indignantly, \"I shall put up with no more of your pranks! It's not your sister Prudy who would go to hidin' my soap, and me in a hurry!\"  \"She likes Prudy best. I always knew she did, and everybody else,\" thought Dotty, wrathfully,--\"everybody else but me!\"  And the temper which had been smouldering all the morning blazed up hotly.  \"Call me Miss Flippet again, if you dare!\" cried she, with battle-fires in her eyes. \"What you s'pose the mayor'll do to you, miss? He'll put you in the lockup--yes, he will!\"  At this foolish speech Norah's mouth assumed a mocking smile, which added live coals to Dotty's wrath.  \"You mizzable Cath'lic girl! You--you--you--\"  Words were choked in the smoke and flame of her anger. I mean to say that dreadful \"lion,\" which had not come out in his full strength for years, suddenly sprang up, and shook his mane. Dotty could not speak. She lost her reason. Her head was on fire. Her hands and feet began to fly out. She danced up and down. Her terrific screams brought her mother down in haste, to see what was the matter. Dotty's face was crimson; her eyes shining fiercely; her voice hoarse from screaming.  \"Indeed, ma'am,\" said Norah, really alarmed, \"I've no means of knowing what's put her in such a way, ma'am.\"  \"She called me everything!\" cried Dotty, getting her voice again. \"I was Miss Flippet! I was all the wicked girls in this town!\"  Norah looked a little mortified. She knew her mistress was very \"particular,\" and did not allow any one in her house to \"call names.\" But just now Mrs. Parlin had no time to give Norah a mild reproof, her whole attention being devoted to the half-insane Dotty, whose most unusual exhibition of temper filled her with dreadful apprehensions.  \"Alas,\" thought the good mother, \"is this child going to live over again those dreadful days of her babyhood? The Lord give me wisdom to know what to do with her!\"  Mrs. Parlin soon succeeded in quieting the turbulent Dotty; and deep silence fell upon the wash-room.  \"My dear little girl,\" said she, very gently, \"I desire you to spend the rest of the morning alone. You need not talk or play with either of your sisters. You may _think_. When the bell rings you may come to dinner; and after dinner I would like to see you in the nursery.\"  In half an hour Dotty had such a look of heartache in her face that Prudy longed to comfort her, only speech was forbidden. The little creature was out in the front yard, poking dirt with a stick, and secretly wondering if she could make a hole deep enough to lie down in and die.     CHAPTER II.  A SAD STORY.   After dinner, Mrs. Parlin was seated on the lounge in the nursery, looking very sad. Raising her eyes, she saw Dotty standing before her, twisting a corner of her apron. The child had entered as quietly as her own shadow, and her mother had not heard a footfall.  \"My dear little girl, I am going to tell you a story.\"  \"Yes, 'm.\"  Dotty looked steadily at her finger-nails.  \"A true story about a child who let her temper run away with her.\"  \"Yes, 'm,\" replied Dotty again, giving her mother a view of her rosy right ear.  Mrs. Parlin saw that Dotty was very much ashamed. Her face did not look as it had looked in the early morning. Then      \"There was a hardness in her eye,     There was a hardness in her cheek:\"  now she appeared as if she would be very much obliged to the nursery floor if it would open like a trap-door and let her fall through, out of everybody's sight.  \"The little girl I am going to tell you about, Dotty, lived in this state. Her name was Harriet Snow. Her father and mother were both dead. She had occasional fits of temper, which were very dreadful indeed. At such times she would hop up and down and scream.\"  Dotty tied the two corners of her apron into a hard knot. The story was rather too personal.  \"Was the little girl pretty?\" said she, trying to change the subject.  \"Not very pretty, I think. Her skin was dark; her eyes were black, and remarkably bright. When I saw her, she was thirteen years old; and you may know, Dotty, that by that time her face could not well be very pleasant: temper always leaves its marks.\"  Dotty looked at her little plump hands, as if she expected to see black spots on them.  \"Sometimes Harriet beat her head against the wall so violently that there seemed to be danger of her dashing her brains out.\"  Dotty looked up quite bravely. This dreadful little girl was worse than _she_ had ever been! O, yes!  \"Wasn't she crazy, mamma?\"  Mrs. Parlin shook her head.  \"No, I am afraid not, dear. Only, when she allowed anger to stay in her heart, it made her feel blind and dizzy. Perhaps she was crazy for the time.\"  Dotty hung her head again. She remembered how blind and dizzy she herself had felt while screaming at Norah that morning.  \"This little girl had no mother to warn her against indulging her temper. When she had the feeling of hate swelling at her heart, nobody told her what it was like. _You_ know what it is like, Dotty?\"  Dotty's chin drooped, and rested in the hollow of her neck.  \"I don't want to tell you, mamma.\"  \"Like _murder_, my child.\"  Dotty shuddered, though she had known this before. Her mother had often read to her from the Bible, that \"whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer.\"  \"Well, there was no one to love this poor Harriet; she was not lovable.\"  \"No, 'm, she was _hateable_!\" remarked Dotty, anxious to say something; for if she held her peace, she was afraid her mother would think she was applying the story to herself.  \"There was no one to love her; so a woman took her, and was paid for it by the town.\"  \"Town? Town, mamma? A _town_ is _houses_.\"  \"She was paid for it by men in the town. I don't know whether this woman tried to teach Harriet in the right way or not. It may be she had so much to do that she thought it less trouble to punish her when she was naughty than to instruct her how to be good.\"  \"O, yes; I s'pose she struck her with a stick,\" said Dotty, patting her forefingers together--\"just this way.\"  \"Harriet had the care of one of Mrs. Gray's children, a lively little boy about two years old.\"  \"Was he cunning? As cunning as Katie Clifford? Did he say, 'If you love me, you give me hunnerd dollars; and I go buy me 'tick o' canny'?\"  \"Very likely he was quite as cunning as Katie. You would hardly think any one could get out of patience with such a little creature--would you, my daughter?\"  \"No, indeed!\" cried Dotty, eagerly, and feeling that she was on safe ground, for she loved babies dearly, and was always patient with them.  \"I don't know but Harriet was envious of Mrs. Gray's little boy, because he had nicer things to eat than she had.\"  \"Well, it ought to have nicer things, mamma, 'cause it hadn't any teeth.\"  \"And she got tired of running after him.\"  \"No matter if she did get tired, mamma; the baby was tireder than she was!\"  \"And the parents think now it is very likely she was in the habit of striking him when nobody knew it.\"  \"What a naughty, wicked, awful girl!\" cried Dotty, her eyes flashing.  \"She had a fiery temper, my child, and had never learned to control it.\"  Dotty looked at her feet in silence.  \"The baby was afraid of his little nurse; but he could not speak to tell how he was abused; all he could do was to cry when he was left with Harriet. But one day Mrs. Gray was obliged to go away to see her sick mother. She charged Harriet to take good care of little Freddy, and give him some baked apples and milk if he was hungry.\"  \"With bread in?\" suggested Dotty.  \"Yes, I suppose so. Then she kissed her baby. He put his arms around her neck, and cried to go too; but she could not take him.\"  \"I s'pose he cried 'cause he 'xpected that awful girl was a-going to shake him,\" said Dotty, indignantly.  \"I cannot tell you precisely what Harriet did to him; but when the father and mother got home, that darling boy was moaning in great pain. They sent for the doctor, who said his spine was injured, and perhaps he would never walk again; and, indeed, he never did.\"  \"O, mamma! mamma Parlin!\"  \"Yes, my child; and it is supposed that Harriet must have hurt him in one of her fits of rage.\"  Dotty's face had grown very white.  \"O, mamma, what did the folks do with Harriet?\"  \"They took her to court, and tried her for abusing the little"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25396"],["title","Dotty Dimple At Home (#2)"],["body","oy. They could not prove that she was really guilty, though everybody believed she was.\"  \"I know what 'guilty' means, mamma; it means _hung_.\"  \"No, dear; if she hurt the baby she was guilty, whether she was punished for it or not.\"  \"Well, she did it, I just know she did it!\" exclaimed Dotty, greatly excited. \"That little tinty boy!\"  \"The judge pitied her for her youth and ignorance; so did the twelve men called the 'jury;' and she was allowed to go free.\"  \"Then did she 'buse somebody's else's baby, mamma?\"  \"I hope not. The last I heard of her she was married to a negro fiddler.\"  \"O!\"  \"Do you know why I have told you this sad story, my little daughter?\"  \"'Cause, 'cause--Harriet beat her head against the door, and hurt a baby, and--and--married black folks!\"  Dotty was very pale, and there was a tear in her voice; still her mother could not be sure that her words had made much impression. She was afraid her long story had been \"love's labor lost.\"  But I believe it had not been. Not entirely, at least. Dotty thought of Harriet all the afternoon, and walked about the house with a demureness quite unusual.  \"O, Prudy!\" said she, when they two were alone in the parlor, looking over a book of engravings, \"I'm going to tell you something; 'twill make you scream right out loud, and your hair stick up!\"  [Illustration: \"I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.\" Page 34.]  \"Don't,\" laughed Prudy, \"I've just brushed my hair.\"  \"Once there was a girl, Prudy, lived in this state; and mother thinks she was just like me. But she wasn't, truly. She was homely; and her hair was black; and her mother was dead. The woman spatted her with a stick where she lived. And she didn't love the baby any at all, 'cause he had nicer things, you know; and I guess white sugar and verserves. So she stuck a _spine_ into him--only think! In his crib! So he never walked ever again! And his father and mother were gone away, and told her to give him baked apples and milk--with bread in!\"  \"Why, that can't be true, Dotty Parlin!\"  \"Yes, _indeed_! Certain true, black and blue. Guess my mother knows!\"  \"What!\" said Prudy, \"just for baked apples and milk?\"  \"Yes. Her name was Harriet.\"  \"What did you say she did it with, Dotty?\"  \"Mamma said a _spine_. They took her to the court-house; but they didn't hang her, 'cause she--I've forgot what--but they didn't. They made her marry a black man--that's all I know!\"  \"Well, there, how queer!\" said Prudy, drawing a long breath. \"If I was Harriet I'd rather have been hung. Was he all black?\"  \"Yes, solid black. But I s'pose she didn't want to choke to death any more'n you do.\"  \"Dotty,\" said Prudy, with a meaning in her tone, \"what do you suppose made mamma tell you that story?\"  \"I don't know.\"  Dotty looked deeply dejected.  \"Little sister,\" continued Prudy, taking advantage of the child's softened mood, \"don't you wish you didn't let yourself be so angry?\"  \"Yes, I do, so there!\" was the quick and earnest reply.  Prudy was astonished. It was the first time this proud sister had ever acknowledged herself wrong.  \"Then, Dotty, what if you try to be good, and see how 'twill seem?\"  \"Won't you tell anybody, Prudy?\"  \"No, never.\"  \"Well, I _will_ be good! I can swallow it down if I want to.\"  Observe what faith the child had in herself!  Prudy clapped her hands.  \"There, don't you talk any more,\" added Miss Dimple, with a sudden sense of shame, and a desire to conceal her emotions. \"Let's make pictures on the slate.\"  Prudy was ready for anything; her heart was very light. She was too wise to remind Dotty of her new resolution; but she kept a journal, and that evening there was a precious item to make in it.  I think, by the way, that Prudy's habit of keeping a journal was an excellent thing. She learned by the means to express her thoughts with some degree of clearness, and it was also an improvement to her handwriting.      \"_July 2d._ My sister Dotty thinks, certain, positive, she _will_ be     a good girl; and this is the day she begins. But I shall not tell     anybody, for I promised, 'No, never.'      \"My mother told her about a girl that almost killed a dear little     boy because they asked her to give him baked apples and milk. I     heard my father say to my mother that he thought the story pierced     Dotty like _a two-leg-ged_ sword. So I don't think she will ever get     angry again. Finis.\"  Prudy always added the word \"Finis\" at the close of her remarks each day, considering it a very good ending.     CHAPTER III.  FIRE.   For a few days after this, Dotty Dimple had little time to think of her new resolution. Nothing occurred to call forth her anger, but a great deal to fill her with astonishment and awe.  The three little girls, for the first time in their lives, were learning a lesson in the uncertainty of human events. They had never dreamed that anything about their delightful home could ever change. If they thought of it at all, they supposed their dear father and mother, and their serene grandmamma Read, would always live, and be exactly as they were now; that their home would continue beautiful and bright, and there would be \"good times\" in it as long as the world stands.  It is true they heard at church that it is not safe for us to set our affections too strongly upon things below, because they may fail us at any moment, and there is nothing sure but heaven. Still, like most children, they listened to such words carelessly, as to something vague and far away. It was only when they were left, in one short day, without a roof over their heads, that Susy sobbed out,--  \"O, Prudy, this world is nothing but one big bubble!\"  And Prudy replied, sadly,--  \"Seems more like shavings!\"  You all know how an innocent-looking fire-cracker set Portland ablaze, but you can have little idea of the terror which that woeful Fourth of July night brought to our three little girls.  When I think of it now, I fancy I see them speeding up and down that departed staircase, trying to help the men carry water to pour on the roof. The earnestness of their faces is very striking as Susy brandishes a pail, Dotty a glass pitcher, and Prudy a watering-pot, in the delusive hope that they are making themselves useful.  After this, when the children have had a troubled sleep, and wake in the morning to find the house actually on fire, the horror is something always to be remembered. Flames are already bursting out of some of the lower windows. It is no longer of any use to pour water. There is no time to be lost. Mrs. Parlin hurries the children down stairs, and out of the house, under their grandmother's protection.  They thread their dismal way up town, through smoke and flame, Susy shedding tears enough to put out a common coal fire. It is, indeed, a bitter thing to turn their backs upon that dear old home, and know for a certainty that they will never see it again! In the place where it stands there will soon be a black ruin!  \"The fire is lapping and licking,\" says Prudy, \"like a cat eating cream.\"  \"I hope it has a good time eating our house up!\" cried Dotty, in wrath.  Susy groans. Dotty thinks they are going to be beggars in rags and jags. Prudy, always ready with her trap to catch a sunbeam, says that after all there are other little girls in the world worse off than they are. Susy thinks not.  \"O, children, you are young and can't realize it; but this is awful!\"  Dotty tries to be more wretched than ever, to satisfy her eldest sister's ideas of justice. She sends out from her throat a sound of agony, which resembles a howl.  Prudy's chief consolation is in remembering, as she says, that \"God knows we are afire.\" Prudy is always sure God will not let anything happen that is _too_ dreadful. She has observed that her mother is calm; and whatever mamma says and does always approves itself to this second daughter.  But Susy can only wring her hands in hopeless despair. She has helped save the books, still she \"expects they will burn up, somehow, on the road.\" Her pony has been trotting about through the night; his hair is singed, and she \"presumes it will strike in and kill him.\" The world is, to Susy's view, one vast scene of lurid horrors. If she couldn't cry, she thinks she should certainly die.  But this strange night came to an end. Dreadful things may and do happen in this world, but, as a general rule, they do not last a great while. The fire did its work, and then stopped. It was fearful while it raged, and it left a pitiful wreck; still, as Mrs. Parlin said, it was \"not so bad but it might have been worse.\" \"Nothing,\" she always declared, \"ought to make us really unhappy except sin.\"  \"And here we are, all alive,\" said she, with tearful eyes, as she tried to put her arms around the three little girls at once. \"All alive and well! Let us thank God for that.\"  \"I guess I shan't cry _much_ while I have my blessed mother to hold on to,\" said Prudy, pressing her cheek against Mrs. Parlin's belt-slide.  \"Nor I neither,\" spoke up Dotty, very bravely, till a sudden spasm of recollection changed her tone, and she added, faintly, \"If 'twasn't for my cunning little tea-set!\"  \"I shouldn't care a single thing about the fire,\" sobbed Susy, \"if it hadn't burnt _our_ house up, you know. You see it was where we _lived_. We had such good times in it, with the rooms as pleasant as you can think! Nothing in the world ever happened: and now that pony! O, dear, and my room where the sun rose! I don't know what's the matter with me, but _seems_ as if I should die!\"  \"And me, too,\" sighed Dotty. \"I just about know that man threw my tea-set into the Back Cove; and now we haven't any home!\"  \"It is home where the heart is, children,\" said Mrs. Parlin, tenderly; but something choked her voice as she spoke.  Though she was never known, either then or afterwards, to murmur, still it is barely possible she may have felt the loss of her precious home as much as even Susy did.  For the present the family were to remain at Mr. Eastman's"]]]
