I feel better, 'n' I'm willin' He should look.\"  \"Well, then, dear, that's right--go to sleep.\"  \"And now, Hollis, do you s'pose He'll send my spirrick back to me?\"  \"What are you talking about, Topknot? Your spirit's in your body, child. Go to sleep.\"  \"No, it isn't in my body, too! I want my nice good little spirrick to come back,\" murmured the child. \"Auntie said 'twould stay to me if I's good.\"  Fly was thinking of her unseen guardian angel.  It was a troubled night for Horace. Fly waked him no less than three times, to ask him if she had the measles.  \"No, child, no; don't wake me for that again.\"  \"Well, you ought to not go to sleep 'fore I do. You're a fast boy, Hollis!\"  Morning came, and Fly was rather languid, as might have been expected after such a night.  \"I don't see,\" mused Mrs. Fixfax, \"where she caught this dreadful cold, unless it was your keeping the room so hot yesterday, children.\"  Fly hid her face in her brother's back hair, for she was riding pickaback down stairs.  \"And can we go to see that Poland lady?\" said Dotty.  \"If you asked _me_, I answer, No,\" said Horace, bluntly. \"At any rate, Fly mustn't stir a step out of the house to-day.\"  \"I didn't ask you, Horace. I asked Mrs. Fixfax. She is the one that has the care of us.\"  \"I really don't know what to say about it,\" replied the housekeeper, hesitating. \"We will wait and see how she seems after breakfast.\"  \"Rather a cool way of setting my opinion one side,\" thought Horace, indignantly.  Fly ate only two small buckwheat cakes, but seemed lively enough, as she always did when there was a prospect of going anywhere.  \"I don't suppose it is exactly the thing, after steaming her so,\" said Mrs. Fixfax, as if talking to herself,--she did not even look at Horace;--\"but really I don't know what else to do. I couldn't keep her at home unless the rest of the children staid; and if I did I presume she'd get killed some other way. She's one of the kind that's never safe, except in bed, with the door locked, and the key in your pocket.\"  \"Let her manage it to suit herself,\" thought brother Horace, deeply wounded; \"she knows _my_ opinion.\"  When Madam Pragoffyetski came, the housekeeper went down to the parlor to introduce the children--a step which Horace thought highly unnecessary. He was charmed at once with the foreign lady's affable manners, and would have liked to go with her, if only Fly could have been left behind. Mrs. Fixfax explained that the child had been sick, and must be treated like a hot-house plant.  \"We thought last night she was in danger of her _life_,\" said Dotty. \"You expected she was going to die, Horace; you know you did.\"  \"Well, I wasn't going to,\" returned Fly, coughing. \"I knew I should live--I always do live.\"  \"What was the matter?\" said Mrs. Pragoffyetski, in alarm; for she knew as much about children's ailments as she did about the volcanoes in the sun.  \"Only a little sore throat,\" answered the housekeeper, still looking anxious, and not at all sure she was doing right.  \"Yes'm, sore froat. And Dotty wanted me to have the measles, too; but I wouldn't.\"  \"That is right,\" said Mrs. Pragoffyetski, with a musical laugh. \"Indeed, your little cousin was cruel to ask such a thing of you. I'm glad you didn't do it.\"  They took a street-car, and Dotty pressed her face against a window, expecting to see gay sights all the way. But no; the shops had their eyes shut. Yesterday how quickly everybody had moved! Now, men and women were walking quietly along, and there was no confusion anywhere.  \"How strange!\" said Prudy. \"I should think it was Sunday, only the boys are blowing tin trumpets.\"  \"Yes; and the babies are going to visit their grandmammas,\" said Mrs. Pragoff; \"look at the one in the corner in its nurse's arms, with a point-lace bib under its chin. That pretty blanket, embroidered so heavily, must weigh more than the baby.\"  Dotty kept her gaze steadily fixed on the streets.  \"It seems so funny for a steeple to be _preceding_ from the middle of those stores. 'Tisn't a very pious place for a church!\"  \"Now I hope Dotty isn't going to be pert,\" thought Prudy.  \"I know what street that is, down there,\" added Miss Dimple, jumping out of the car with both feet; \"that is Wall Street. Did they use to have walls both sides of it? Horace, you scared me so yesterday, I like to screamed. You said there were bulls and bears growling all the way along; but there wasn't a single bear, only a stuffed one sitting on top of a store, and he wasn't alive, and not on this street either.\"  Here Prudy gave her sister's little finger a squeeze, which was meant for \"hush;\" but Dotty never could understand why it was not proper at all times to say what she had on her mind, especially when people listened so politely as this Polish lady.  \"Mrs.--Mrs. Pragoff-yetski, I hope you'll excuse me, but I can't remember your name.\"  \"That is it; you have it exactly; but never mind about the last part, my love. Pragoff is enough.\"  \"Yes'm.--Well, I was going to ask you, Mrs. Yetski, will you please sit between me and Fly when we go into church? O, you don't know how funny she acts, or you never'd dare take her. I wouldn't laugh in church for anything in this world; but Fly always makes me.\"  \"Does she, indeed! Ah me, that is very unfortunate!\" said the queenly lady, looking down on little Miss Toddlekins as if she were actually afraid of her. She took care to put Dotty out of harm's way, by placing the untamable Fly between Horace and Prudy.  The interior of Trinity Church was so magnificent, the Christmas decorations so fresh and beautiful, and the service so imposing, that no one thought of such a thing as smiling.  \"How could I have been so impatient, yesterday?\" thought Prudy, as she listened to the plaintive chant, \"He was a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.\"  \"Why, if you only think of that, how our Saviour had trouble every minute, it doesn't seem as if it makes so much difference whether we people and children have a good time or not.\"  Here, as they were about to seat themselves at the close of the chant, Fly, who, in spite of her brother's warnings, had been tilting back and forth on a stool, suddenly tipped forward, and hit her nose furiously. Blood flowed from the wound; and the sight of it, together with the pain, made the child frantic. She forgot where she was and screamed. Poor Mrs. Pragoffyetski! Though a good woman in the main, she was rather proud of appearances, and had just been thinking the four children did her credit. But now! The shrill cry of distress called everybody's attention to her pew. The whole audience were looking up from their prayer-books in astonishment.  \"Tut, tut! My dear! My love! Hush, my babe, lie still,--O, can't you stop crying?\"  Horace, too, was trying to quiet the child; but Fly sincerely believed she was bleeding to death; so what did she care for proprieties?  \"O, my shole!\" piped she aloud, plunging both hands into the stream of blood, and afterwards into her hair.  Thus, by the time Mrs. Pragoff and Horace got her into the aisle, she looked as if she had been murdered.  \"I wish I was twenty-one,\" thought Horace, bitterly. \"Mrs. Fixfax had no business steaming this child. I believe it has gone to her brain.\"  The party of five marched out of church, for Mrs. Pragoff did not wish to make a second sensation by coming back after Prudy and Dotty.  \"I never go with Fly but I get mortified,\" thought Miss Dimple; \"and now, O dear, I shan't hear those Christmas chimes!\"  But Prudy was thinking how sorry she was for Mrs. Pragoff and Horace.  They all went into a druggist's, and, after a few minutes spent in the use of a sponge and water, poor Fly ceased to look like a murdered victim, but very much like a marble image. When they reached Mrs. Pragoff's, she was placed on a sofa, and for once in her life lay still. Horace bent over her with the wildest anxiety, thinking some terrible crisis was coming. As soon as she felt a little better, she began to cry. \"O, darling, what is it?\" said he, glad to see her in motion once more.  \"Cause my Uncle 'Gustus is sick.\"  \"Poh,\" said Dotty; \"crying about that? See! _I_ don't cry.\"  \"Well, you don't love Uncle 'Gustus so hard as I do,\" said Fly, with another burst.  Mrs. Pragoff looked on with interest, and tried to remember whether she had ever heard that children shed tears when they were \"coming down\" with scarlet fever. This elegant mansion was a very interesting place to visit. To say nothing of things which \"made a noise,\" there was no end of curiosities from the four quarters of the globe; and Mrs. Pragoff was so truly well-bred that the children soon felt at home. Dotty was deeply engaged in examining a sea-horse, when Prudy suddenly whispered,--  \"Dotty, what did you do last night with those two rings?\"  \"Rings? What rings?\"  Then a look of absolute terror spread over Dotty's face. She remembered slipping off her auntie's rings when she washed the dishes; but where had she put them?  \"Why, Prudy, I _persume_ I left 'em in--in--where I ought to leave 'em.\"  \"O, I'm glad you did,\" returned Prudy, quite satisfied, for she was listening with one ear to the liquid notes of \"The Wandering Sprite.\"  \"Why didn't Prudy Parlin ask me before?\" thought Dotty, in much agitation; \"and then I could have gone all round and looked to see if I'd put them in the right place.\"  [Illustration: \"DOTTY DIMPLE, YOU HERE?\"]     CHAPTER VIII.  DOTTY'S WINDPIPE.   It mattered little to Dotty, after this, what happened. She cared nothing about the elegant masters and misses who dropped in to dinner, though Prudy was too frightened to speak; nothing about the paroquets, and dried butterflies, and Japanese canoes she pretended to look at; nothing about the chatting and laughing, and very little about the Christmas plum-pudding, the oyster-pies, and ice cream. Dotty had no heart for any of these things. She was thinking continually, \"Where"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20984"],["title","Prudy Keeping House (#8)"],["body","those rings?\"  Fly did not dine, and Dotty had begged to stay with her.  \"No,\" said Mrs. Pragoff, patting Miss Dimple's cheek with her dainty hand, which did not look as if it had ever been soiled with anything coarser than rose leaves; \"I am glad to see you so kind to your dear little cousin; but she is asleep on my bed, and does not need you.\"  Prudy sat at her hostess's right hand, and in spite of her bashfulness, was as happy a child as ever broke a wish-bone. No one who has not had the care of a family can imagine the relief she felt now the cooking was off her mind. But Dotty was wringing her hands under the table-cloth, and thinking, \"I don't want to see anybody. My heart is certainly broken.\"  \"Why, Dot, what's the matter? What are you scowling at so?\" said Horace, in a low tone.  Upon that Dotty began to smile. No one must know her heart was broken, for fear the question might arise, \"What broke it?\" Of course her smile was a make-believe, nothing more nor less than a simper. The large boy across the table looked at her in surprise. \"Handsome as a picture,\" thought he, \"but no brains.\"  \"O, my sorrows! What'll I do? I can't remember whether I put those rings in my blue pocket, or carried 'em up stairs. Seems to me I dropped 'em in a salt-cellar. No; I thought I'd lay 'em in a book, but we flew round so when Fly was sick, that I shouldn't wonder if they got into the wood-box.\"  All the while Dotty went on simpering and saying, \"If you please, sir,\" every time a dish was passed her. Her singular behavior surprised Horace, and when she took three olives, which she very much disliked, and immediately afterwards tucked them under her plate, he said,--  \"Dot, I believe you are crazy.\"  It was an unfortunate remark. A little more, and there would have been a scene at the table; but Dotty, with all her self-control, forced back the tears. \"Wonder if he wanted to make me cry,\" thought she; \"but I won't cry. And he needn't think he can make me 'mad' either. S'pose I'd show temper right before these people?\"  On the whole, Dotty contrived to keep up appearances, and no one but Horace and the youth opposite noticed her much, or suspected her of being an idiot. But the moment dinner was over, she stole away from the party, and found her way up-stairs to Mrs. Pragoff's room. There, on the outside of the bed, lay Fly, half undressed, and still very pale.  \"Gas-light makes folks look _gas_-ly,\" thought Dotty, \"but she isn't much sick, or Horace wouldn't have eaten any dinner. There, when I first got a peek at this bed-quilt, I thought it was so queer; and now I'm going to see what it's made of.\"  Instead of a common coverlet, the bed was adorned with two enormous crimson satin cushions stuffed with swan's down. The cushion on the lower half of the bed was two feet deep, to cover the lower part of the body, and the one at the upper part not quite so thick, for it was to cover the shoulders. Then a sheet of the finest linen was turned over at the top and sides, and buttoned on to the cushions. The pillows were of crimson silk, the bedstead enormously high, and carved all over with figures of gods and goddesses.  Dotty stood gazing with surprise, and almost forgetting her trouble.  \"She must have brought it over from Poland when she ran away, only it's so heavy. But then I don't s'pose she ran on foot. Came in the night, in the cars, prob'ly. Poland's up by the North Pole. I'm going to ask auntie about it.\"  But the moment auntie came into her thoughts Dotty was wretched again. She went to a window, drew back the damask curtain, and gazed out.      \"The night came on alone,     The little stars sat, one by one,     Each on his golden throne.\"  \"Those stars twinkle like auntie's rings. Let's see: one was full of little pieces of glass, about as big as raspberry seeds. I shouldn't think glass would cost much. And the other was red, like a drop of blood, with ice frozen over it. That can't be so expensive, should you think, as a string of beads?\"  Dotty tried hard to comfort herself, but could not stay comforted.  \"You don't s'pose auntie's jewels cost more than my papa is worth? How he must feel to be so poor! If he has to pay for those rings, we shan't get enough to eat. Have to live on crackers and olives. And when we come to the table, father will look at me, and say, 'This is on the account of your naughty conduct, child!' O, dear! I can't speak one word, for it will be true, what he says. Grandma Read will have enough to eat; Norah will set it on her end of the table. Grandma is rich; I've seen her counting over bills in her desk; but how could I ask her for any, when she'd look right in my eyes, and say, 'What was thee doing with other folks' rings on thy thumbs?'  \"Well, I know 'twasn't right; but 'twas Prudy's fault some. If she hadn't told me not to so hard, I _persume_ I shouldn't. What made her speak up, and get me started?  \"O, did you ever see such a beautiful string of beads? One, two, three,--I guess there are a thousand.\"  Dotty threw the necklace over her head, and the air became as fragrant as a garden of spices.  \"I don't mean to meddle with other peoples' things any more; mother has taught me better. But there's one thought keeps coming into my mind: Isn't it wicked to have so much jewelry? The 'postles didn't wear any, nor Job didn't wear any, nor Moses.  \"Well, nor auntie don't, either. Nothing but a watch and wedding-ring. Horace says that's so queer.  \"Now, what's the use of it, just to lock up away from the _morths_? I don't believe auntie knows how many rings there were in that casket!\"  This was a new idea. Dotty's eyes began to sparkle. They would have made a jeweller's fortune if he could have put them in a gold setting, and sold them for sapphires.  \"The rings are somewhere round. I'm sure I can find them; but if I can't, will it be very wrong not to tell, when 'twouldn't make the least difference, and auntie never wears 'em? Ought never to have 'em at all; ought to have the ornaments of meek and quiet spirits, instead of rings.  \"Prudy would think 'twas awful not to tell; but Prudy can't say anything to me. Didn't she get mad yesterday, real, shaky mad? 'Twas a great deal wickeder for her than it is for me--her disposition is real good, and mine was born awful. So Prudy can't say a word to me about anything I do.  \"And I declare, who wants to eat olives and fried pork? Prudy wouldn't like it any better'n I do. She would _think_ she'd tell, but p'haps she wouldn't any quicker'n me.  \"All just for two old rings, that never did me any good, and didn't have much of a time keeping house, either.\"  \"Dotty Dimple, you here?\" said Prudy, appearing at her sister's elbow, like an accusing angel. \"Why, I've been hunting you all over the house. You mustn't wear that on your neck; it is a rosary; it doesn't belong to you.\"  \"Prudy little knows how my heart's broken,\" thought Dotty, \"or she wouldn't talk about beads. And me wanting to go home so I could 'most fly, just to find those rings.\"  \"I have been hunting for you,\" repeated Prudy. \"Mrs. Pragoff sent a man over to Uncle Augustus's to find out whether they came to-night in the cars; but they didn't. There was a letter that uncle wasn't able; but they'll come to-morrow afternoon.\"  \"That's splendid,\" thought Dotty; \"now I'll have to-night and all to-morrow forenoon to hunt.\"  \"And then Mrs. Pragoff said we might just as well stay here all night as to go home,\" continued Prudy.  \"O, dear, dear! we're not going to stay here. Prudy Parlin? Why didn't you come and ask if I was willing?\"  \"I did hunt for you, Dotty, but I couldn't find you. I thought you'd like to stay. They are playing so beautifully down stairs. I'm just proud of Horace; he acts like a little gentleman.\"  \"I don't care how Horace acts, and I don't want to play with people that have their hair frizzed. I want to go back to auntie's.'  \"But you can't, Dotty. Mrs. Pragoff has sent to Mrs. Fixfax for our night-dresses.\"  Dotty rolled herself up in the curtain, and screamed into the folds of it.  \"Why, Dotty, what am I going to do with you? Please come down, and behave.\"  \"O, Prudy, I don't want ever to go down again. I don't want ever to see folks, or behave, as long as I live.\"  \"But, Dotty, all these little boys and girls came here just to see us. It is our Christmas party. You'll mortify Mrs. Pragoff. You know how Fly mortified her this morning. Please _don't_ be contrary.\"  Dotty unrolled herself from the curtain with a triumphant smile.  \"You needn't say anything, Prudy Parlin! You got mad your own self, I s'pose you know!\"  Prudy's eyes dropped suddenly.  \"But, Dotty, why do you want to go back to auntie's to-night?\"  \"I want to go for something particular. I--\" Prudy's mouth was opening for another question. \"Because I---I've swallowed something the wrong way.\"  \"O Dotty, not a pin!\"  \"No; what you s'pose? Guess I've done something to my windpipe. Wish you wouldn't talk.\"  Prudy, in spite of her vexation, could not help smiling at Dotty's fierce grimaces, of which she got a vanishing view as the child went into the curtain again.  \"If we don't go home, Prudy, I'll have to go right to bed. I don't feel like sitting up.\"  \"Then I must ask Mrs. Pragoff where we are to sleep.\"  And next minute Prudy was half way down stairs, thinking,--  \"What's gone wrong? I never can find out by asking _her_. She don't think or care how impolite she is, and how hard she makes it for me.\"  It was a very brilliant party, composed of some of the most refined and accomplished little people in the city of New York. Such fine dresses and such die-away manners overawed Prudy. She did wish her mamma had sent a thin summer dress in the trunk. It was dreadful to have to wear woollen, high-necked and long-sleeved. It cost her a great effort to cross the room. She felt as awkward as a limping grasshopper in a crowd of butterflies. But reaching her hostess at last, she timidly whispered,--  \"My sister _says_"]]]
