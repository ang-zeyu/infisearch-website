An umpire marched about in leggings, and blew a whistle, and called out `Off side!  Off side!'\"  \"And what did he mean by that?\"  Ella hesitated, uncertainly.  Her knowledge of the game was of the slightest, but she was anxious to help her friend, and gallantly tried to recall odd explanations.  \"Oh, well, I think one of the wrong side hit, you know, and there is a rule that you may not send the ball straight forward to one of your own side, but must hit it back to some one behind you.\"  \"But that's silly!  If you want to get on as fast as you can, why on earth must you go _back_?  If they never hit forward, how can they win. Do you mean to say they _never_ send it forwards towards the goal?\"  \"Oh, yes, yes!  One girl was splendid.  She hit magnificently.  She ran like a man, and sent it flying before her, and made three goals herself.\"  \"Then how--why--what--what in the world did you mean by saying that you _mustn't_ do it?\" demanded Rhoda sternly, and Ella made a gesture as of tearing her hair in confusion.  \"I don't know!  It isn't easy to understand a game when you see only one match.  I was confused myself, but I know each side tries for a different goal, and there are `backs' and `half-backs' and `forwards,' just as at football, and, whatever you do, you must not raise your stick above your waist.  It's a murderous-looking game, anyhow.  I wondered that they weren't all killed; and one girl's hand was bleeding horribly. I asked her if it was very painful, and she stared and said, `Oh, I hadn't noticed it!' and mopped it up with her handkerchief.  Awfully callous, I call it.\"  \"Oh, I don't know!\" replied Rhoda, airily.  \"Those flesh wounds don't hurt.  I should never think of taking any notice of a little thing like that.  Well, I can't say I am very much wiser for your instructions, my dear, but I will pump Harold and see what I can get out of him.  I have no doubt I could hit all right, for I have a quick eye, and if you can play one or two games it helps you with the rest.  But I should be pretty mad if I made a hit and they whistled at me and made me come back.  I like to know what I am about.\"  \"You had better be a goal-keeper,\" advised Ella, wisely; \"you have no running to do until the ball comes your way, and then at it you go, tooth and nail!  Stop it somehow--anyhow--with your hands, your feet, your skirt, your stick.  I believe there is an etiquette about it, don't you know, as there is about all those things, and that it's more swagger to stop it one way than another, but the main thing is to stop it _somehow_, and that you simply must do!\"  \"Humph!  If you can!  What happens if you can't?\"  \"Emigrate to Australia by the first boat!  I should think so, at least, to judge by the faces of the other girls when one poor creature _did_ let a ball in.  Feerocious, my dear! there was no other word for it.  My heart ached for her.  But it was a stupid miss, for it looked so easy. I felt sure I could have stopped it.\"  \"It's all a matter of nerve.  If you lose your head you are sure to play the fool at a critical moment.  Fraulein was like that.  The moment the game went against her she began to hop about, and puff and pant, and work herself into such a fever that she couldn't even see a ball, much less hit it.  I kept calm, and so of course I always won.\"  It did strike Ella that victory under such circumstances would be easily gained, but she was too loyal to say so, and Rhoda leant back against the cushions of the sofa, and continued to discourse on games in general, and school games in particular, with an air of such intimacy and knowledge that no one would have suspected that the object of her visit had been to listen, rather than to teach.  Ella listened meekly to a recital of what her friend intended to do, and be; of the examinations she would pass, the honours she would gain; the influence she would exercise over her fellows; and sighed to think of her own limitations, and the impossibility of such a career ever falling to her lot.  And then Rhoda rose, and put on her gloves preparatory to saying good-bye.  \"I shall come down to see you again, of course, but I shall be very busy.  I am going to have a complete new outfit, and everything as nice as possible.\"  \"Ye-es,\" said the Vicar's daughter.  \"I shall have all my best skirts lined with silk.\"  \"Ah!\" sighed Ella, and felt a pang of keenest envy.  She had never possessed a silk lining in her life.  It seemed to her at times that if she could only hear herself rustle as she walked, there would be nothing left to wish for in life!  \"They will think you are a Princess!\" she said, and Rhoda smiled, and did not attempt to deny the impeachment.    CHAPTER FOUR.  DEPARTURE.  Mr and Mrs Chester returned from their visit to Hurst Manor with somewhat different accounts of the establishment.  The father was delighted with all he had seen, thought the arrangements excellent, and Miss Bruce a charming and lovable woman.  The mother did not see how draughts were to be avoided in those long, bare passages, considered the hours of work cruelly long, and was convinced that Miss Bruce could be very stern if she chose.  Her husband laughed, and declared that a school of two hundred girls would fare badly indeed if she could not, and the maternal fears were silenced at once by his banter, and by Rhoda's fearless confidence.  It was finally decided that the girl should join at the beginning of the term, and preparations were set on foot without delay.  It was almost like buying a trousseau, Rhoda declared; and certainly no bride-elect could have taken a keener interest in her purchases.  The big, new box with her initials on the side; the dressing-bag with its dainty fittings; the writing-case and workbox; the miniature medicine chest stocked with domestic remedies, in case she should feel feverish or chilled, have earache, toothache, or headache; be threatened with sore throat or swollen glands--they were all new possessions, and as such afforded acute satisfaction, for though the wardrobe list was disappointingly short, there were at least no restrictions as to quality.  When the key was turned in her box Rhoda heaved a sigh of satisfaction in the confidence that not one of the two hundred girls could possess a better equipment than her own.  Then she looked round her dismantled room, and felt a pang of depression.  It looked so _dead_--as if its owner had already departed, and left it to its fate.  The wardrobe door swung apart and revealed the empty pegs; the drawers were pulled open and showed piles of torn-up letters; the carpet was strewn with pins. All the treasured ornaments had been stored away, and the ugly ones looked uglier than ever, as if infected by the general dejection.  In story-books girls were wont to bid a sentimental adieu to their maiden bowers before leaving for a new sphere, but Rhoda did not feel in the least inclined to be sentimental; she took to her heels instead and ran downstairs, only too glad to escape from her dreary surroundings, and presently she and her mother _were_ driving towards the station on the first stage of the eventful journey.  The village women stood at the doors of their cottages to put their aprons to their eyes, and murmur, \"Ay, poor dear!\" as she drove past; little Tommy Banks threw a nosegay of marigolds through the carriage window, and waddled away, scarlet with confusion; and there was quite a gathering of friends on the platform.  Ella had brought a box of home-made Fuller's sweets from herself and a dainty copy of _The Christian Year_ as the Vicar's farewell offering; Mrs Ross had a stack of magazines for reading on the journey, and little Miss Jones, who owed all the comforts of life to Mrs Chester's friendship, presented the most elaborate \"housewife,\" stocked with every necessary which it seemed probable that a girl at school would _not_ require.  It was all most touching and gratifying.  Even the station- master came up to express his good wishes, and the one-eyed porter blurted out, \"Glad to see you back, Miss!\" as if it were impossible to suppress his feelings a moment longer.  Rhoda felt an insight into the feelings of Royalty as she stood at the window of the carriage, graciously smiling and bowing so long as she remained in sight, and when this excitement was over, another appeared to take its place.  Mrs Chester was discovered to be crying in quite uncontrolled fashion, and at the sight of her tears Rhoda put on her severest air.  \"Mother!  What are you doing?  You must _not_ cry!  Please remember that in half an hour we shall be at Euston, and meet the school.  I should never get over it if the girls saw my mother with a red face!\"  Mrs Chester mopped her eyes obediently, and made a valiant effort to regain her composure.  For herself, poor dear, she cared little about appearances, but Rhoda had already exhibited an intense anxiety that she should make a good impression on the minds of her future school-fellows. Each separate article of clothing had been passed in review, while the bonnet had been changed three times over before the critic was satisfied.  It would never do to spoil an effect which had been achieved with so much trouble; so the unselfish creature gulped down her tears, and tried to talk cheerfully on impersonal topics, keeping her eyes fixed on the landscape the while, lest the sight of her child might prove too much for her resolution.  Rhoda was immaculate in blue serge coat and skirt, and sailor hat with a band of school colours.  Nothing could have been simpler; but there are ranks in even the simplest garments, and she was agreeably conscious that her coat was not as other coats, neither was her skirt as other skirts.  The hand of the Regent Street tailor was seen in both, and there was a new arrangement of pleats at the back which ought in itself to secure the admiration of the school!  She was all complacency until Euston was reached, when the first"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21102"],["title","Tom and Some Other Girls: A Public School Story (#5)"],["body","at a group of \"Hurst\" girls smote her to earth.  She had sewn the band on her hat upside down, putting the wide stripe next the brim, which should by rights have been the place of the narrow!  To the cold, adult mind such a discovery might seem of trifling importance, but to the embryo school-girl it was fraught with agonising humiliation.  It looked so ignorant, so stupid; it marked one so hopelessly as a recruit; Rhoda's cheeks burned crimson; she looked searchingly round to see if by chance any other strangeling had fallen into the same error, but, so far as bands were concerned, she was solitary among the throng.  A governess, seeing the two figures standing apart from the rest, came forward and welcomed Rhoda with a few kindly words, but she was too busy to spare time for more than a greeting.  Fresh girls kept arriving with every moment--a crowd of brisk, alert, bustling young creatures, skurrying along bags in hand, and bright eyes glancing to right and left.  At every step forward there would come a fresh recognition, a nod of the head, a wave of the hand, a quick \"Halloa!\" more eloquent than elegant.  Rhoda felt a spasm of loneliness at the realisation that no greeting waited for herself, and at the strangeness of the many faces. She looked critically around and came to the most unfavourable conclusions.  \"I don't like that one--she's a fright!  I hate that one--she's so affected.  Those two look common; I won't have anything to do with _them_.  The big one with spectacles looks horribly learned.  The one with the violin has a most unmusical face.  _She_ looks fit for stratagems if you like!  The little one in brown is a cunning fox, I can see it in her eyes.  Of all the plain, uninteresting, stodgy set of girls--\"  There was a movement inside the saloon carriage opposite, and a large mamma clad in black, with a profusion of bugles, stepped on to the platform and marched stolidly away.  She steered a course clear of the crowd of girls, the ends of her mantle floating behind her, like a brig in full sail before the breeze, while her poor little daughter hung out of the doorway gazing after her, sobbing bitterly, and mouthing in pathetic, helpless misery.  Mrs Chester began to cry at once in sympathy, and even Rhoda felt a smarting of the eyes.  It was coming!  The crucial moment was at hand; the bell was ringing, the girls were crowding into the carriages, the governess stepped forward and spoke a warning word.  \"You had better come now, dear!  Please take your seat.\"  Rhoda turned and bent her tall young head to her little mother, but neither spoke--the tension was too great.  Mrs Chester's face was tremulous with agitation, the girl's white and defiant.  Then she stepped into the carriage and seated herself among the crowd of strangers.  The girls were all silent now, pale of face and red of eye, a few crying openly, the majority fighting against emotion.  The mothers came to the edge of the platform, and stared in through the windows.  \"It is like looking at animals in a cage,\" said Rhoda to herself, and then the wheels began to move, she saw her mother's quivering face--saw it from a distance--saw it no more--and realised for the first time, with a great, bitter pang of anguish, the meaning of farewell!  She had not intended to cry, she had never believed it possible that she _would_ cry, but it was hard work to resist it during the next half- hour, when every second bore her further from home, and the strangeness of her surroundings pressed more heavily upon her.  Other girls were beginning to cheer up and exchange confidences with their companions, but she had no one with whom to talk.  Two girls opposite--the foxey one and the affected one--were chatting quite merrily together.  The affected one, whose name appeared to be Hilda, had spent part of her holiday at Boulogne, and was discoursing on the delights of Continental bathing, while Foxey, not to be outdone, would have her know that Scarborough kept pace with all the Continental methods.  Another girl made the harrowing discovery that she had left her spectacles at home, and announced the same to a chum, who remarked that it was \"a ripping joke!\"  The violin girl had had a bicycling accident, and exhibited her scars with pride.  The shock of parting over, they all seemed very happy together, very friendly, very absorbed; far too much absorbed to notice a new-comer, or trouble themselves on her behalf. The governess stood by Rhoda's side for a few minutes and made remarks in an aggressively cheerful manner, but her reception was not encouraging, and presently she went away, and did not return.  Rhoda looked at the pictures in her magazines, or pretended to look, for her brain was so much occupied with other matters that she could not grasp their meaning, and after five minutes' inspection would hardly have been able to say whether she had been studying the features of a country landscape or those of a society beauty.  Then she turned and cautiously examined her neighbours.  The girl to the right was a square, stolid-looking creature, square-faced, square-shouldered, with square toes to her boots, and elbows thrust out on each side in square, aggressive fashion.  Her eyes were small and light, and her nose a defiance of classic traditions; the corners of her mouth turned down, and she had at once the solemnest and the most mischievous expression it is possible to imagine.  After a critical survey of her charms, Rhoda felt that she was not the person with whom to force a conversation, and turned her attention to the neighbour on her left.  A recruit, surely; for, though her hat-band was in order, there was in her mien an absence of that brisk, independent air which seemed to characterise the old Hurst girl.  A pretty damsel, too, with curling hair and soft dark eyes, which at the present moment were bent in elaborate scrutiny on the paper before her.  Rhoda noticed that it was the advertisement page at which she was looking, and suspected a pre- occupation kindred to her own.  She coughed slightly and ventured a gentle question--  \"Is this your first term at school?\"  The dark-eyed girl turned a fleeting glance upon her, so fleeting that it seemed as if she had never altered her position, and replied monosyllabically:  \"Yes.\"  \"You are going up, like me, for the first time?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"And you have never been to school before?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"I mean a boarding school.  A big school like this, on all the new lines?\"  \"Yes.\"  This was disconcerting!  What _did_ she mean?  It was her first term, she was a new girl, and yet she had been up before!  What was the girl thinking about!  She might really trouble herself to say more than one single word.  \"But you said--I understood you to say--\"  Brown Eyes turned fiercely upon her, and fairly snapped in indignation.  \"I don't care what I said, or what you understood.  Can't you _see_ I want to be quiet?  Can't you leave me alone?  If I am a new girl, I don't want to howl before all the others, do I!  Very well, then! don't make me talk!  Read your book, and let me read mine.\"  \"I _beg_ your pardon!\" said Rhoda, in her most stately manner.  She took up her magazine obediently, but now it was more impossible than ever to read it, for she was tingling with mortification.  Such a snub from a stranger, and when she was trying to be friendly too!  It would be a long time before she troubled Brown Eyes again.  Her thoughts went back regretfully to Ella, the loyal, the sympathetic, the faithfully admiring.  If Ella were only here now, how different it would be!  Why had she not thought of it before, and asked her parents to pay Ella's fees, so that she might have the solace of her presence?  They would have done it gladly, but, alas!  Ella could not have been spared from home.  She had to help her mother; to be governess as well as pupil, teaching the younger children for part of every day.  No!  Ella was impossible; but the craving for companionship grew so intense that it even conquered the dread inspired by her other companion, and strengthened her to make yet another effort.  The train had just left a station whose name was familiar in her ears, and she realised that they had crossed the boundary between two counties, and were now in Blankshire, in which Hurst Manor itself was situated.  To remark on this fact seemed an innocent and natural manner of opening a conversation, so she turned towards Square Face, and said brightly, \"Now we are in Blankshire, I see!  I have never been here before.  The country looks very pretty and undulating.\"  The girl turned and stared at her with a wooden stolidity of feature. Seen at close quarters she appeared to Rhoda as at once the most extraordinarily ugly and comical-looking creature she had ever beheld. Her little eyes blinked, and the thin lips flapped up and down in an uncanny fashion that refused to be likened to any ordinary thing.  There was a moment's silence, then she repeated in a tone of the utmost solemnity--  \"The country is very pretty and undulating--you are quite right.  Your remark is most apt!  May I ask if you would object to my repeating it to my friend over here?  She would be so very much interested.\"  She was so preternaturally grave, that for a moment Rhoda was taken in by the pretence, the next she flushed angrily, and tilted her head in the air, but it was of no avail, for already the next girl was tittering over the quotation, and turning to repeat it in her turn.  The simple words must surely contain some hidden joke, for on hearing it each listener was seized with a paroxysm of laughter, and face after face peered forward to stare at the originator, and chuckle with renewed mirth.  It was a good ten minutes before it had travelled round the carriage and been digested by each separate traveller, and then, so far from dying out, it acquired fresh life from being adapted to passing circumstances, as when the train having stopped at a junction and "]]]
