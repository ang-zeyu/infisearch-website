Of all our enemies Cad Prog was the most truculent, and most feared.  The sight of his red head coming round the corner was always enough to strike panic into a score of youngsters, and even we bigger boys always looked meek when Prog came out to defy us.  He was strolling guilelessly along, and didn't see us at first.  Then suddenly he caught sight of us approaching, and next moment the blue apron and red head disappeared with a bolt round the corner.  \"Come on!\" shouted Rasper, who led.  \"So we are!\" cried we, and hue and cry was made for Cad Prog forthwith.  We sighted him as we turned the corner.  He was making straight for the market.  Perhaps to get an axe, I thought, or to hide, or to tell my uncle!  \"Come on!\" was the shout.  It's wonderful how a short sharp chase warms up the blood even of a small boy of twelve.  Before we were half down the street, even Bates had no thought left of deserting, and we all four pressed on, each determined not to be last.  The fugitive Prog kept his course to the market, but there doubled suddenly and bolted down Side Street.  That was where he lived; he was going to run into his hole then, like a rabbit.  We gained no end on him in the turn, and were nearly up to him as he reached the door of his humble home.  He bolted in--so did we.  He bolted up stairs--so did we.  He plunged headlong into a room where was a little girl rocking a cradle--so did we.  Then began a wild scuffle.  \"Catch him!  Take his cap off!\" cried Bobbins.  \"He hasn't got a cap!\" cried Rasper--\"butcher-boys never have!\"  \"Then pull off his apron!\" was the cry.  In the scuffle the little girl was trodden on, and the cradle clean upset.  A crowd collected in the street.  Cad Prog roared as loud as he could, so did his little sister, so did the baby, so did Jimmy Bates, so did Joe Bobbins, so did Harry Rasper, so did I.  _I_ did not care what happened; I went for Cad Prog, and have a vague idea of my hand and his nose being near together, and louder yells still.  Then all of a sudden there was a tramp of heavy footsteps on the stairs, and all I can remember after that was receiving a heavy cuff on my head, being dragged down into the street, where--so it seemed to me for the moment--at least a million people must have been congregated; and, finally, I know not how, I was standing in the middle of my uncle's study floor, with my coat gone, my mouth bleeding, and my cap, after all, clean vanished!  It was a queer plight to be in.  I heard a dinning in my ears of loud voices, and when I looked at the bust on the top of the bookcase it seemed to be toppling about anyhow.  Some people were talking in the room, but the only voice I could recognise was my uncle's.  He was saying something about \"not wanting to shield me,\" and \"locking-up,\" the drift of which I afterwards slowly gathered, when the village policeman--we only had one at Brownstroke--addressing my uncle as \"your honour,\" said he would look in in the morning for further orders.  At this interesting juncture the bust began to wobble about again, and I saw and heard no more till I woke next morning, and found Mrs Hudson mopping my forehead with something, and saying, \"There now, Master Freddy, lie quite still, there's a good boy.\"  \"What's the matter?\" said I, putting up my hand to the place she was washing.  It was something like a bump!  \"It's only a bruise, Master Freddy--no bones broken, thank God!\" said she, motioning me to be silent.  But I was in no mood to be silent.  Slowly the recollection of yesterday's events dawned on me.  \"Did they get off Cad Prog's apron,\" I inquired, \"after all?\"  Of course, the good old soul thought this was sheer wandering of the mind, and she looked very frightened, and implored me to lie still.  It was a long time before I perceived any connection between our chase of the redoubtable Cad Prog up Side Street yesterday and my lying here bruised and in a darkened room to-day.  At last I supposed Mr Prog must have conquered me; whereat I fired up again, and said, \"Did the other fellows finish him up?\"  \"Oh, dear me, yes,\" said the terrified nurse; \"all up, every bit--there now--and asked for more!\"  This consoled me.  Presently a doctor came and looked at my forehead, and left some powders, which I heard him say I was to take in jam three times a day.  I felt still more consoled.  In fact, reader, as you will have judged, I was a little damaged by the adventure in Side Street, and the noble exploit of my companions and myself had not ended all in glory.  A day or two after, when I got better, I found out more about it, and rather painfully too, because my uncle landed one day in my bedroom and commenced strongly to arraign me before him.  He bade me tell him what had happened, which I did as well as I could. At the end of it he said, \"I suppose you are not aware that for a day or two it was uncertain whether you had not killed that child that was in the room?\"  \"I?\"  I exclaimed.  \"I never touched her!  Indeed I didn't, uncle!\"  \"You knocked over the cradle,\" said my uncle, \"and that's much the same thing.\"  I was silent.  My uncle proceeded.  \"And I suppose you are not aware that the barber who tried to take you down the stairs is now in the hospital with an abscess on his leg, the result of the kick you gave him?\"  \"Oh, I can't have done it, uncle--oh, uncle!\"  And here I was so overwhelmed with the vision of my enormities and their possible consequences that I became hysterical, and Mrs Hudson was summoned to the rescue.  The fact was, in the account of the fray I appear to have got credit for all the terrible deeds that were there done; and I, Master Freddy Batchelor, was, it appeared, notorious in the village as having been guilty of a savage and felonious assault upon one C.  Prog, of having also assaulted and almost \"manslaughtered\" Miss Prog the younger, and further of having dealt with my feet against the shin of one Moppleton, a barber, in such manner as to render him incapable of pursuing his ordinary avocations, and being chargeable on the parish infirmary; besides sundry and divers damage to carpets, crockery, glass, doorposts, kerb-stones, and the jacket of the aforesaid C.  Prog.  On the whole, when I arose from my bed and stepped once more into the outer world, I found myself a very atrocious character indeed.  At home I was in disgrace, and abroad I was not allowed to wander beyond my uncle's garden, except to church on Sunday under a heavy escort.  So on the whole I had not a very good time of it.  My uncle was terrifically glum, and appeared to think it most audacious if ever I chanced to laugh or sing or express any sentiment but deep grief and contrition in his presence.  Mrs Hudson read me long lectures about the evil of slaying small children and laming barbers, and I was occasionally moved to tears at the thought of my own iniquities.  But at the age of twelve it is hard to take upon oneself the settled gloom of an habitual criminal, and I was forced to let out at times and think of other things besides my wicked ways.  I got let off school--that was one alleviation to my woe--and being free of the garden I had plenty of opportunity of letting off the steam.  But it was slow work, as I have said; and I was really relieved when, a week or two afterwards, my uncle made the announcement with which this chapter begins.  How I fared, first at Stonebridge House, and subsequently in the City Life for which it was meant to train me, will be the theme of this particular veracious history.    CHAPTER TWO.  HOW I MADE MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH STONEBRIDGE HOUSE.  The eventful Monday came at last, and with my little box corded up, with Mrs Hudson as an escort, and a pair of brand-new knickerbockers upon my manly person, I started off from my uncle's house in the coach for Stonebridge, with all the world before me.  I had taken a rather gloomy farewell of my affectionate relative in his study.  He had cautioned me as to my conduct, and given me to understand that at Stonebridge House I should be a good deal more strictly looked after than I had ever been with him.  Saying which he had bestowed on me a threepenny-bit as \"pocket-money\" for the term, and wished me good-bye. Under the circumstances I was not greatly overcome by this leave- taking, and settled down to make myself comfortable for my long drive with Mrs Hudson to Stonebridge.  Mrs Hudson had been my nurse ever since I could remember, and now the poor old soul and I were to part for good.  For she was to see me safely inside the doors of Stonebridge House, and then go back, not to my uncle's (where she would no longer be needed), but to her own home.  Of course she was very much depressed by the prospect, and so indeed was I. For a good while we neither of us said much.  Then, by way of changing the subject and beguiling the way, she began to address to me long and solemn exhortations as to my conduct at the new school.  She knew as much about \"schools for backward and troublesome boys\" as I did; but that was no matter.  She made me promise, for one thing, that I would make a point of wearing a clean collar three times a week; and, for another, of calling the housekeeper's attention to the very first sign of a hole in my socks. (As my socks, by the way, usually showed the daylight in upon six out of the ten toes, and one out of the two heels every time I took off my boots, I was promising a lot when I made this bargain!)  Further, I was to see my Sunday clothes were always _hung_ on pegs, and not _laid_ in drawers; and my blue necktie, mind, was not to be touched till my black- and-pink was past work.  From these matters she passed on to my conduct towards my new masters and companions.  \"Mind and always tell them the truth straight out, Freddy,\" she said, \"and say `sir' whenever you speak to Mr Ladislaw--and say your prayers regularly night and day, won't you? and be very careful to use your own"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21036"],["title","My Friend Smith: A Story of School and City Life (#2)"],["body","and brush, and not lend them about to the other young gentlemen.\"  Mrs Hudson, you see, had an easy way of flying from one topic to another.  Her exhortations were crowded with pieces of good advice, which may have sounded funny when all strung together, but were each of them admirable taken separately.  I of course promised her everything.  The journey was a long one, but the day was bright, and we had a good basketful of provender, so it was not tedious.  At length the driver turned round, and said we should come in sight of Stonebridge at the next turn of the road.  My spirits began to sink for the first time.  Dismal and all as Brownstroke had been, how did I know I should not be happier there, after all, than at this strange new place, where I knew no one?  I wished the driver wouldn't go so fast.  Mrs Hudson saw my emotion, I think, for she once more opened fire, and, so to speak, gathered up the last crumbs of her good counsel.  \"Oh, and Freddy dear,\" fumbling nervously in her pocket, and letting down her veil, \"write and tell me what they give you to eat; remember, pork's bad for you, and leave your cuffs behind when you go out bird's- nesting and all that.  Mind, I'll expect to hear about everything, especially about whether you get warm baths pretty regularly, and if Mr Ladislaw is a good Christian man--and look here, dear,\" she continued hurriedly, producing a little parcel from the depths of her pocket, \"you're not to open this till I'm away, and be sure to take care of it, and don't--\"  \"That there chimbley,\" interrupted the driver at this stage, \"is the fust 'ouse in Stonebridge.\"  Five minutes later we were standing in the hall of Stonebridge House.  It didn't look much like a school, I remember thinking.  It was a large straggling building, rather like a farmhouse, with low ceilings and rickety stairs.  The outside was neat, but not very picturesque, and the front garden seemed to have about as much grass in it as the stairs had carpets.  As we stood waiting for some one to answer our ring, I listened nervously, I remember, for any sound or trace of my fellow \"backward and troublesome boys,\" but the school appeared to be confined to one of the long straggling wings behind, and not to encroach on the state portion of the house.  After a second vigorous pull at the bell by our coachman, a stern and scraggy female put in her appearance.  \"Is this Frederick Batchelor?\" she inquired, in tones which put my juvenile back up instantly.  \"Yes, this is Master Freddy,\" put in the nervous Mrs Hudson, anxious to conciliate every one on my behalf.  \"Freddy, dear, say--\"  \"Is that his box?\" continued the stern dame.  \"Yes,\" said Mrs Hudson, feeling rather chilled; \"that's his box.\"  \"Nothing else?\"  \"No, except his umbrella, and a few--\"  \"Take the box up to my room,\" said the lady to a boy who appeared at this moment.  \"Where is the key?\"  \"I've got that, marm,\" replied Mrs Hudson, warming up a little, \"and I should like to go over his things myself as they are unpacked.\"  \"Wholly unnecessary,\" replied the female, holding out her hand for the key.  \"I see to everything of that kind here.\"  \"But I _mean_ to open the box!\" cried Mrs Hudson, breaking out into a passion quite unusual with her.  I, too, had been getting the steam up privately during the last few minutes, and the sight of Mrs Hudson's agitation was enough to start the train.  \"Yes,\" said I, swelling out with indignation, \"Mrs Hudson and I are going to open the box.  You sha'n't touch it!\"  The female appeared to be not in the least put out by this little display of feeling.  In fact, she seemed used to it, for she stood quietly with her arms folded, apparently waiting till we both of us thought fit to subside.  Poor Mrs Hudson was no match for this sort of battle.  She lost her control, and expressed herself of things in general, and the female in particular, with a fluency which quite astonished me, and I did my little best to back her up.  In the midst of our joint address a gentleman appeared on the scene, whom I correctly divined to be Mr Ladislaw himself.  Mr Ladislaw was a short, dapper man, in rather seedy clothes, with long sandy hair brushed right back over the top of his head, and no hair at all on his face.  He might have been thirty, or he might have been fifty.  His eyes were very small and close together; his brow was stern, and his mouth a good deal pulled down at the corners.  Altogether, I didn't take to him at first glance, still less when he broke into the conversation and distinctly took the part of Mrs Hudson's adversary.  \"What is all this, Miss Henniker?\" he said in a quick, sharp voice, which made me very uncomfortable.  \"This is Mr Jakeman's servant,\" answered the female.  \"She was talking a little rudely about Frederick Batchelor's luggage here.\"  \"And so was I!\"  I shouted valiantly.  \"It's not _your_ luggage, and you sha'n't have it, you old--beast!\"  The last word came out half-involuntarily, and I was terribly frightened as soon as it had escaped my lips.  I do not know how Mr Ladislaw or Miss Henniker took it, for I dare not look up.  I heard Mrs Hudson utter a mild protest, and next moment was conscious of being taken firmly by the hand by Mr Ladislaw and led to the door from which he had just emerged.  \"Remain here, Batchelor,\" said he, sternly, \"till I come back.\"  There was something in his voice and manner which took the spirit out of me, and he might have spared himself the trouble of locking the door behind him.  I found myself in a small study, with shelves on the walls and a writing-table in the window, which looked out on to a playground, where, in the distance, I could catch sight of three boys swinging.  This first prospect of my future companions so interested me that I had actually nearly forgotten all about poor Mrs Hudson, when Mr Ladislaw entered the study and said--\"The person is going now, Batchelor.  If you like you can say good-bye.\"  I flew out into the hall.  Mrs Hudson was there crying, alone.  What we said, and how we hugged one another, and how desperately we tried to be cheerful, I need not relate.  I was utterly miserable.  My only friend, the only friend I had, was going from me, leaving me in this cheerless place all alone.  I would have given worlds to return with her.  Mr Ladislaw stood by as we uttered our last farewells.  \"Be a good boy, Freddy, dear; be a good boy,\" was all she could say.  \"So I will, so I will,\" was all I could reply.  Then she turned to where the coach was waiting.  But once more she paused, and drew from her pocket another parcel, this time a box, of the nature of whose contents I could readily guess.  \"It's only a few sweets, dear.  There, be a good boy.  Good-bye, Freddy!\"  And in another minute the coach was grating away over the gravel drive, and I stood utterly disconsolate in Stonebridge House, with my box of sweets in one hand and Mr Ladislaw at the other.  Some of my readers may have stood in a similar situation.  If they have, I dare say they can remember it as vividly as any incident in their life.  I know I can.  I remember instinctively ramming the box into one of my side trousers pockets, and at the same time wondering whether both the hats hanging on the pegs were Mr Ladislaw's, or whether one of them belonged to some one else.  Then suddenly it came over me that the former gentleman stood at my side, and all my misery returned as he said--  \"I will take you to Miss Henniker, Batchelor; follow me.\"  The sound of the wheels of Mrs Hudson's coach were still audible down the road, and as I turned my back on them and followed Mr Ladislaw up the carpetless stairs, it seemed as if I was leaving all hope behind me.  I found Miss Henniker in the middle of a large parlour, with my box lying open on the ground beside her, and some of my vestments already spread out on the table.  A half inclination to renew the rebellion came over me, as I thought how poor dear Mrs Hudson had been triumphed over; and all these tokens of her kindly soul, folded so neatly, inventoried so precisely, and all so white and well aired, had here fallen into strange hands, who reverenced them no more than--than the shirts and collars and cuffs of I do not know how many more \"backward or troublesome\" boys like myself.  But I restrained my feelings.  \"I will leave Batchelor in your charge for the present,\" said Mr Ladislaw.  At the same time he added something in an undertone to Miss Henniker which I did not catch, but which I was positive had reference to the dear departed Mrs Hudson, whereat I fumed inwardly, and vowed that somehow or other I would pay Miss Henniker out.  When Mr Ladislaw was gone Miss Henniker continued her work in silence, leaving me standing before her.  She examined all my clothes, looked at the mark on every collar, every sock, and scrutinised the condition of every shirt-front and \"dicky.\"  At last she came to my Sunday suit, at the sight of which I remembered all of a sudden my nurse's injunction, and said, as meekly as possible, \"Oh, if you please, Mrs Hudson says those are to be hung up, and not laid flat!\"  Miss Henniker stared at me as if I had asked her her age!  \"Silence!\" she said, when she could sufficiently recover herself; \"and--\"  \"And,\" continued I, carried away with my subject, and really not hearing her remonstrance--\"and, if you please, I'm to have three clean collars a week, and you're to darn--\"  \"Frederick Batchelor!\" exclaimed Miss Henniker, letting drop what she had in her hand, and stamping her foot with most unwonted animation; \"did you hear me order you to hold your tongue?  Don't dare to speak again, sir, till you're spoken to, or you will be punished.\"  This tirade greatly surprised me.  I had been quite pleased with myself for remembering all Mrs Hudson's directions, and so intent on relieving my mind of them, that I had not noticed the growing rage of the middle- aged Henniker.  In after years, when this story was told of me, I"]]]
