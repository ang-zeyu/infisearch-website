The scene changed; and I stood, naked and alone,       amidst the burning sand-plains of Sahara. At my feet lay crouched       a fierce lion of the tropics. Suddenly his wild eyes opened and       fell upon me. With a conclusive bound he sprang to his feet, and       laid bare his horrible teeth. In another instant there burst from       his red throat a roar like the thunder of the firmament, and I       fell impetuously to the earth. Stifling in a paroxysm of terror,       I at last found myself partially awake. My dream, then, was not       all a dream. Now, at least, I was in possession of my senses. The       paws of some huge and real monster were pressing heavily upon my       bosom—his hot breath was in my ear—and his white and ghastly       fangs were gleaming upon me through the gloom.        Had a thousand lives hung upon the movement of a limb or the       utterance of a syllable, I could have neither stirred nor spoken.       The beast, whatever it was, retained his position without       attempting any immediate violence, while I lay in an utterly       helpless, and, I fancied, a dying condition beneath him. I felt       that my powers of body and mind were fast leaving me—in a word,       that I was perishing, and perishing of sheer fright. My brain       swam—I grew deadly sick—my vision failed—even the glaring       eyeballs above me grew dim. Making a last strong effort, I at       length breathed a faint ejaculation to God, and resigned myself       to die. The sound of my voice seemed to arouse all the latent       fury of the animal. He precipitated himself at full length upon       my body; but what was my astonishment, when, with a long and low       whine, he commenced licking my face and hands with the greatest       eagerness, and with the most extravagant demonstration of       affection and joy! I was bewildered, utterly lost in       amazement—but I could not forget the peculiar whine of my       Newfoundland dog Tiger, and the odd manner of his caresses I well       knew. It was he. I experienced a sudden rush of blood to my       temples—a giddy and overpowering sense of deliverance and       reanimation. I rose hurriedly from the mattress upon which I had       been lying, and, throwing myself upon the neck of my faithful       follower and friend, relieved the long oppression of my bosom in       a flood of the most passionate tears.        As upon a former occasion my conceptions were in a state of the       greatest indistinctness and confusion after leaving the mattress.       For a long time I found it nearly impossible to connect any       ideas; but, by very slow degrees, my thinking faculties returned,       and I again called to memory the several incidents of my       condition. For the presence of Tiger I tried in vain to account;       and after busying myself with a thousand different conjectures       respecting him, was forced to content myself with rejoicing that       he was with me to share my dreary solitude, and render me comfort       by his caresses. Most people love their dogs—but for Tiger I had       an affection far more ardent than common; and never, certainly,       did any creature more truly deserve it. For seven years he had       been my inseparable companion, and in a multitude of instances       had given evidence of all the noble qualities for which we value       the animal. I had rescued him, when a puppy, from the clutches of       a malignant little villain in Nantucket who was leading him, with       a rope around his neck, to the water; and the grown dog repaid       the obligation, about three years afterward, by saving me from       the bludgeon of a street robber.        Getting now hold of the watch, I found, upon applying it to my       ear, that it had again run down; but at this I was not at all       surprised, being convinced, from the peculiar state of my       feelings, that I had slept, as before, for a very long period of       time, how long, it was of course impossible to say. I was burning       up with fever, and my thirst was almost intolerable. I felt about       the box for my little remaining supply of water, for I had no       light, the taper having burnt to the socket of the lantern, and       the phosphorus-box not coming readily to hand. Upon finding the       jug, however, I discovered it to be empty—Tiger, no doubt, having       been tempted to drink it, as well as to devour the remnant of       mutton, the bone of which lay, well picked, by the opening of the       box. The spoiled meat I could well spare, but my heart sank as I       thought of the water. I was feeble in the extreme—so much so that       I shook all over, as with an ague, at the slightest movement or       exertion. To add to my troubles, the brig was pitching and       rolling with great violence, and the oil-casks which lay upon my       box were in momentary danger of falling down, so as to block up       the only way of ingress or egress. I felt, also, terrible       sufferings from sea-sickness. These considerations determined me       to make my way, at all hazards, to the trap, and obtain immediate       relief, before I should be incapacitated from doing so       altogether. Having come to this resolve, I again felt about for       the phosphorus-box and tapers. The former I found after some       little trouble; but, not discovering the tapers as soon as I had       expected (for I remembered very nearly the spot in which I had       placed them), I gave up the search for the present, and bidding       Tiger lie quiet, began at once my journey toward the trap.        In this attempt my great feebleness became more than ever       apparent. It was with the utmost difficulty I could crawl along       at all, and very frequently my limbs sank suddenly from beneath       me; when, falling prostrate on my face, I would remain for some       minutes in a state bordering on insensibility. Still I struggled       forward by slow degrees, dreading every moment that I should       swoon amid the narrow and intricate windings of the lumber, in       which event I had nothing but death to expect as the result. At       length, upon making a push forward with all the energy I could       command, I struck my forehead violently against the sharp corner       of an iron-bound crate. The accident only stunned me for a few       moments; but I found, to my inexpressible grief, that the quick       and violent roll of the vessel had thrown the crate entirely       across my path, so as effectually to block up the passage. With       my utmost exertions I could not move it a single inch from its       position, it being closely wedged in among the surrounding boxes       and ship-furniture. It became necessary, therefore, enfeebled as       I was, either to leave the guidance of the whipcord and seek out       a new passage, or to climb over the obstacle, and resume the path       on the other side. The former alternative presented too many       difficulties and dangers to be thought of without a shudder. In       my present weak state of both mind and body, I should infallibly       lose my way if I attempted it, and perish miserably amid the       dismal and disgusting labyrinths of the hold. I proceeded,       therefore, without hesitation, to summon up all my remaining       strength and fortitude, and endeavour, as I best might, to       clamber over the crate.        Upon standing erect, with this end in view, I found the       undertaking even a more serious task than my fears had led me to       imagine. On each side of the narrow passage arose a complete wall       of various heavy lumber, which the least blunder on my part might       be the means of bringing down upon my head; or, if this accident       did not occur, the path might be effectually blocked up against       my return by the descending mass, as it was in front by the       obstacle there. The crate itself was a long and unwieldy box,       upon which no foothold could be obtained. In vain I attempted, by       every means in my power, to reach the top, with the hope of being       thus enabled to draw myself up. Had I succeeded in reaching it,       it is certain that my strength would have proved utterly       inadequate to the task of getting over, and it was better in       every respect that I failed. At length, in a desperate effort to       force the crate from its ground, I felt a strong vibration in the       side next me. I thrust my hand eagerly to the edge of the planks,       and found that a very large one was loose. With my pocket-knife,       which, luckily, I had with me, I succeeded, after great labour,       in prying it entirely off; and getting it through the aperture,       discovered, to my exceeding joy, that there were no boards on the       opposite side—in other words, that the top was wanting, it being       the bottom through which I had forced my way. I now met with no       important difficulty in proceeding along the line until I finally       reached the nail. With a beating heart I stood erect, and with a       gentle touch pressed against the cover of the trap. It did not       rise as soon as I had expected, and I pressed it with somewhat       more determination, still dreading lest some other person than       Augustus might be in his state-room. The door, however, to my       astonishment, remained steady, and I became somewhat uneasy, for       I knew that it had formerly required but little or no effort to       remove it. I pushed it strongly—it was nevertheless firm: with       all my strength—it still did not give way: with rage, with fury,       with despair—it set at defiance my utmost efforts; and it was       evident, from the unyielding nature of the resistance, that the       hole had either been discovered and effectually nailed up, or "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2149"],["title","The Works of Edgar Allan Poe — Volume 3 (#6)"],["body","      that some immense weight had been placed upon it, which it was       useless to think of removing.        My sensations were those of extreme horror and dismay. In vain I       attempted to reason on the probable cause of my being thus       entombed. I could summon up no connected chain of reflection,       and, sinking on the floor, gave way, unresistingly, to the most       gloomy imaginings, in which the dreadful deaths of thirst,       famine, suffocation, and premature interment crowded upon me as       the prominent disasters to be encountered. At length there       returned to me some portion of presence of mind. I arose, and       felt with my fingers for the seams or cracks of the aperture.       Having found them, I examined them closely to ascertain if they       emitted any light from the state-room; but none was visible. I       then forced the blade of my pen-knife through them, until I met       with some hard obstacle. Scraping against it, I discovered it to       be a solid mass of iron, which, from its peculiar wavy feel as I       passed the blade along it, I concluded to be a chain-cable. The       only course now left me was to retrace my way to the box, and       there either yield to my sad fate, or try so to tranquilize my       mind as to admit of my arranging some plan of escape. I       immediately set about the attempt, and succeeded, after       innumerable difficulties, in getting back. As I sank, utterly       exhausted, upon the mattress, Tiger threw himself at full length       by my side, and seemed as if desirous, by his caresses, of       consoling me in my troubles, and urging me to bear them with       fortitude.        The singularity of his behavior at length forcibly arrested my       attention. After licking my face and hands for some minutes, he       would suddenly cease doing so, and utter a low whine. Upon       reaching out my hand toward him, I then invariably found him       lying on his back, with his paws uplifted. This conduct, so       frequently repeated, appeared strange, and I could in no manner       account for it. As the dog seemed distressed, I concluded that he       had received some injury; and, taking his paws in my hands, I       examined them one by one, but found no sign of any hurt. I then       supposed him hungry, and gave him a large piece of ham, which he       devoured with avidity—afterward, however, resuming his       extraordinary manoeuvres. I now imagined that he was suffering,       like myself, the torments of thirst, and was about adopting this       conclusion as the true one, when the idea occurred to me that I       had as yet only examined his paws, and that there might possibly       be a wound upon some portion of his body or head. The latter I       felt carefully over, but found nothing. On passing my hand,       however, along his back, I perceived a slight erection of the       hair extending completely across it. Probing this with my finger,       I discovered a string, and tracing it up, found that it encircled       the whole body. Upon a closer scrutiny, I came across a small       slip of what had the feeling of letter paper, through which the       string had been fastened in such a manner as to bring it       immediately beneath the left shoulder of the animal.     CHAPTER 3         The thought instantly occurred to me that the paper was a note       from Augustus, and that some unaccountable accident having       happened to prevent his relieving me from my dungeon, he had       devised this method of acquainting me with the true state of       affairs. Trembling with eagerness, I now commenced another search       for my phosphorus matches and tapers. I had a confused       recollection of having put them carefully away just before       falling asleep; and, indeed, previously to my last journey to the       trap, I had been able to remember the exact spot where I had       deposited them. But now I endeavored in vain to call it to mind,       and busied myself for a full hour in a fruitless and vexatious       search for the missing articles; never, surely, was there a more       tantalizing state of anxiety and suspense. At length, while       groping about, with my head close to the ballast, near the       opening of the box, and outside of it, I perceived a faint       glimmering of light in the direction of the steerage. Greatly       surprised, I endeavored to make my way toward it, as it appeared       to be but a few feet from my position. Scarcely had I moved with       this intention, when I lost sight of the glimmer entirely, and,       before I could bring it into view again, was obliged to feel       along by the box until I had exactly resumed my original       situation. Now, moving my head with caution to and fro, I found       that, by proceeding slowly, with great care, in an opposite       direction to that in which I had at first started, I was enabled       to draw near the light, still keeping it in view. Presently I       came directly upon it (having squeezed my way through innumerable       narrow windings), and found that it proceeded from some fragments       of my matches lying in an empty barrel turned upon its side. I       was wondering how they came in such a place, when my hand fell       upon two or three pieces of taper wax, which had been evidently       mumbled by the dog. I concluded at once that he had devoured the       whole of my supply of candles, and I felt hopeless of being ever       able to read the note of Augustus. The small remnants of the wax       were so mashed up among other rubbish in the barrel, that I       despaired of deriving any service from them, and left them as       they were. The phosphorus, of which there was only a speck or       two, I gathered up as well as I could, and returned with it,       after much difficulty, to my box, where Tiger had all the while       remained.        What to do next I could not tell. The hold was so intensely dark       that I could not see my hand, however close I would hold it to my       face. The white slip of paper could barely be discerned, and not       even that when I looked at it directly; by turning the exterior       portions of the retina toward it—that is to say, by surveying it       slightly askance, I found that it became in some measure       perceptible. Thus the gloom of my prison may be imagined, and the       note of my friend, if indeed it were a note from him, seemed only       likely to throw me into further trouble, by disquieting to no       purpose my already enfeebled and agitated mind. In vain I       revolved in my brain a multitude of absurd expedients for       procuring light—such expedients precisely as a man in the       perturbed sleep occasioned by opium would be apt to fall upon for       a similar purpose—each and all of which appear by turns to the       dreamer the most reasonable and the most preposterous of       conceptions, just as the reasoning or imaginative faculties       flicker, alternately, one above the other. At last an idea       occurred to me which seemed rational, and which gave me cause to       wonder, very justly, that I had not entertained it before. I       placed the slip of paper on the back of a book, and, collecting       the fragments of the phosphorus matches which I had brought from       the barrel, laid them together upon the paper. I then, with the       palm of my hand, rubbed the whole over quickly, yet steadily. A       clear light diffused itself immediately throughout the whole       surface; and had there been any writing upon it, I should not       have experienced the least difficulty, I am sure, in reading it.       Not a syllable was there, however—nothing but a dreary and       unsatisfactory blank; the illumination died away in a few       seconds, and my heart died away within me as it went.        I have before stated more than once that my intellect, for some       period prior to this, had been in a condition nearly bordering on       idiocy. There were, to be sure, momentary intervals of perfect       sanity, and, now and then, even of energy; but these were few. It       must be remembered that I had been, for many days certainly,       inhaling the almost pestilential atmosphere of a close hold in a       whaling vessel, and for a long portion of that time but scantily       supplied with water. For the last fourteen or fifteen hours I had       none—nor had I slept during that time. Salt provisions of the       most exciting kind had been my chief, and, indeed, since the loss       of the mutton, my only supply of food, with the exception of the       sea-biscuit; and these latter were utterly useless to me, as they       were too dry and hard to be swallowed in the swollen and parched       condition of my throat. I was now in a high state of fever, and       in every respect exceedingly ill. This will account for the fact       that many miserable hours of despondency elapsed after my last       adventure with the phosphorus, before the thought suggested       itself that I had examined only one side of the paper. I shall       not attempt to describe my feelings of rage (for I believe I was       more angry than any thing else) when the egregious oversight I       had committed flashed suddenly upon my perception. The blunder       itself would have been unimportant, had not my own folly and       impetuosity rendered it otherwise—in my disappointment at not       finding some words upon the slip, I had childishly torn it in       pieces and thrown it away, it was impossible to say where.        From the worst part of this dilemma I was relieved by the       sagacity of Tiger. Having got, after a long search, a small piece       of the note, I put it to the dog’s nose, and endeavored to make       him understand that he must bring me the rest of it. To my       astonishment, (for I had taught him none of the"]]]
