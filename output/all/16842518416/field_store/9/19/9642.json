If there's a deficit let's all stump up alike.  We don't want anybody's charity.\"  This sentiment was generally applauded, and restored the captain in the good opinion of every one present.  After all, old Yorke's bark was always worse than his bite.  He wasn't going to be put upon by the other side, however much he seemed to stick up for them.  Ranger waited a few minutes after the others had gone.  \"Look here, Ranger,\" said the captain, \"you must back me up in this. You can afford to do it, because you've been beaten.  I only wish you were in my place.  I know you hate those fellows, and are cut up to have lost the secretaryship.\"  \"I'm not going to break my heart about that,\" said Ranger.  \"Of course not.  You're going to do what will be a lot more useful. You're going to work as hard for the School as if you were secretary and captain in one; and you're going to back me up in keeping the peace, aren't you?\"  \"Would you, if you were in my shoes?\" said Ranger.  \"I might find it hard, but I almost think I should try.  And if I had your good temper, I should succeed too.\"  Ranger laughed.  \"I didn't think you went in for flattery, Yorke.  Anyhow, I believe you are right.  I'll be as affectionate as I can to those Modern chaps. Ugh! good night.\"  After the day's excitement Fellsgarth went to bed early.  But no one dreamed, least of all the heroes of the exploit themselves, how much was to depend during the coming months on those five small voters who had waited patiently in Wally Wheatfield's study that afternoon to hear the clock strike 5:30.    CHAPTER FIVE.  PERCY WHEATFIELD, ENVOY EXTRAORDINARY.  The misgivings of the Classics were justified.  The Moderns did not accept their victory at Elections with a meekness which augured harmony for the coming half.  On the contrary, they executed that difficult acrobatic feat known as going off their heads, with jubilation.  For many terms they had groaned under a sense of inferiority, partly imagined but partly well founded, in their relations with the rival side.  The Classics had given themselves airs, and, what was worse, proved their right to give them.  In its early days the Modern side was not \"in it\" at Fellsgarth.  Its few members were taught to look upon themselves as altogether a lower order of creation than the pupils of the old foundation, and had accepted the position with due humility. Then certain rebellious spirits had arisen, who dared to ask why their side wasn't as good as any other?  The answer was crushing.  \"What can you do?  Only French, and book-keeping and `stinks'\"--(the strictly Classical nickname for chemistry).  \"You can't put a man into the cricket or football field worth his salt; your houses are rowdy; your men do nothing at the University; two out of three of you are not even gentlemen.\"  Whereupon the Moderns went in desperately for sports, and claimed to be represented in the School clubs.  They maintained that they were as good gentlemen as any who talked Latin and Greek; and to prove it they jingled their money in their trouser-pockets, and asked what the Classics could do in that line.  The Classics could do very little, and fell back on their moral advantages.  By degrees the new side grew in numbers, and made themselves heard rather more definitely. They put into the field one or two men who could not honestly be denied a place in the School teams; and they began to figure also among the School prefects.  The present seniors, Clapperton and his friends, carried the thing a step further, and insisted on equal rights with their rivals in all the School institutions.  To their surprise they found an ally in Yorke, who, as we have already said, hurt the feelings of many of his admirers by his Quixotic insistence on fair play all round.  The proceedings yesterday had been the most recent instance of the flow in the tide of Modern progress at Fellsgarth.  Reinforced by an unusual influx of new boys, they had aimed at, and succeeded in winning, their level half of the control of the School clubs; and Yorke had looked on and let them do it!  No wonder they went off their heads as they discoursed on their triumph, and no wonder they already pictured themselves masters of Fellsgarth!  It never does occur to some people that the mountain is not climbed till the top is reached.  \"Really, you know,\" said Brinkman, \"I felt half sorry for those poor beggars; they did look so sick when Dangle was elected.\"  \"It's my opinion,\" said Clapperton, \"you'd have been in too, if all our fellows had turned up.  I saw four or five of our youngsters come in at the last moment.\"  \"Yes--by the way,\" said Dangle, \"that ought to be looked into.  It's fishy, to say the least of it, and would have made all the difference to Brinkman's election.\"  \"Do you know who the fellows were?\" asked Clapperton.  \"I believe your fag was one of them.\"  \"Percy Wheatfield?  Catch him being shut out of anything.  But I'll ask about it.  Fancy poor Yorke's feelings if we were to demand a new election!\"  \"I tell you what,\" said Dangle, \"I don't altogether understand Yorke. He tries to pass off as fair, and just, and all that sort of thing; but one can't be sure he's not playing a game of his own.\"  \"We shall easily see that when it comes to choosing the football fifteen against Rendlesham.  I mean to send him in a list of fellows on our side.  It's only fair we should have half of them our men.\"  \"Half fifteen is seven and a half,\" said Fullerton, a melancholy senior who had not yet spoken; \"how will you manage about that?\"  \"Shut up, you ass!\"  \"I only asked,\" said Fullerton.  \"It doesn't matter to me, I don't mind going as the half man, if you like.  If you send seven names you'll be in a minority in the fifteen, and if you send eight you'll be in a majority.  It doesn't matter to me a bit.\"  \"Just like Fullerton.  Always asking riddles that haven't got an answer,\" said Dangle.  \"I wonder how Fisher will manage the treasurership,\" said Brinkman, who was evidently sore at his defeat.  \"I shouldn't have thought accounts were much in his line.\"  \"He can't have very hard work doing his own,\" said Clapperton, laughing, \"but that's not his fault, poor beggar.  Only I think it would be much better to have a fellow for treasurer who wasn't in a chronic state of being hard up.\"  \"I suppose you mean,\" said Fullerton, who had a most awkwardly blunt way of putting things, \"he'd have less temptation to steal.  I hope Fisher's not a thief.\"  \"What an idiot you are, Fullerton!\" said Clapperton; \"whoever said he was?\"  \"I didn't.  I only asked what you thought.  It doesn't much matter to me, except that it wouldn't be creditable to the School.\"  \"Of course it wouldn't; it's hardly creditable to our side to have a jackass in it,\" said Clapperton.  \"Oh, all right--I'll go.  I dare say you'll get on as well without me.\"  The others presently followed his example, and Clapperton, left to himself, proceeded to draw up his list.  \"Dear Yorke,\" he wrote, \"You will probably be making up the fifteen for the Rendlesham match shortly.  Please put down me, Brinkman, Dangle, Fullerton, West, Harrowby, and Ramshaw major, to play from our side. This will give your side the odd man.  \"Yours truly,--  \"Geo.  Clapperton.\"  This important epistle accomplished, he shouted for his fag to come and convey it to its destination.  It was not till after several calls, on an increasing scale of peremptoriness, that Master Percy condescended to appear.  When he did, he was covered with dust from head to foot, and his face, what could be seen of it, was visibly lopsided.  \"Why don't you come when you're called?  Whatever have you been up to-- fighting?\"  \"Rather not,\" said Percy, \"only boxing.  You see, it was this way; Cottle brought a pair of gloves up this term, and young Lickford had an old pair; so we three and Ramshaw have been having an eight-handed mill. It was rather jolly; only Ramshaw and Lickford had the old gloves on, and they've all the horse-hair out, so Cottle and I got it rather hot on the face.  But we took it out of them with our body blows--above the belt, you know--not awfully above.  I couldn't come when you called, because we were wrestling out one of the rounds.  It's harder work an eight-handed wrestle than four hands.  Just when you called first, I nearly had Cottle and Lickford down, but you put me off my trip, and Ramshaw had me over instead.\"  \"All very interesting,\" said Clapperton, \"but you'll have to come sharp next time or I shall trip you up myself.  Take this note over to Yorke. Stop while he reads it, and if there's any answer, bring it; if not, don't wait.\"  \"Can't Cash take it?  We're not nearly finished.\"  \"No.  Cut off, sharp!\"  \"Awful shame!\" growled the messenger to himself, as he departed.  \"I hate Clapperton; he always waits till I'm enjoying myself, and then routs me out.  I shan't stand it much longer.  What does he want with Yorke!  Perhaps it's a challenge.  Yes, by the way, very good chance! I'll see what that cad Wally's got to say about those kids I found in his room yesterday.  Nice old games he gets up to; Wally's all very well when he's asleep, or grubbing, or doing impositions, but he's a sight too artful out of school, like all those Classic kids.  One's as bad as another.\"  As if to emphasise this sentiment, a Classic kid at that moment came violently into collision with Master Percy's waistcoat.  It was Fisher minor, who had once more caught sight in the distance of the mysterious borrower of his half-crown, and was giving chase.  \"Where are you coming to, you kid.  You've nearly smashed a button. I'll welt you for that.\"  \"I beg your pardon, Wally, I--\"  \"Wally--what do you mean by calling me Wally?\" exclaimed Percy.  \"Well, Wheatfield, I beg your pardon; I was in a hurry to catch a fellow up and I didn't see you.\"  \"Didn't you?  Well, you'll feel me.  Take that.\"  Fisher minor "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21039"],["title","Boycotted, and Other Stories (#0)"],["body","and other stories  By Talbot Baines Reed ________________________________________________________________________ Here are fifteen of the most eccentric short stories you can imagine.

NH. ________________________________________________________________________ BOYCOTTED AND OTHER STORIES  BY TALBOT BAINES REED    CHAPTER ONE.  Sub-Chapter I.  THE SCHOOL CUTS ME.  I hardly know yet what it was all about, and at the time I had not an idea.  I don't think I was more of a fool than most fellows of my age at Draven's, and I rather hope I wasn't an out-and-out cad.  But when it all happened, I had my doubts on both points, and could explain the affair in no other way than by supposing I must be like the lunatic in the asylum, who, when asked how he came to be there, said, \"I said the world was mad, the world said I was mad; the world was bigger than I was, so it shut me up here!\"  It had been a dismal enough term, as it was, quite apart from my troubles.  That affair of Browne had upset us all, and taken the spirit out of Draven's.  We missed him at every turn.  What was the good of getting up the football fifteen when our only \"place-kick\" was gone? Where was the fun in the \"Saturday nights\" when our only comic singer, our only reciter, our only orator wasn't there?  Who cared about giving study suppers or any other sociable entertainment, when there was no Browne to invite?  Browne had left us suddenly.  One day he had been the life and soul of Draven's, next morning he had been summoned to Draven's study, and that same evening we saw him drive off to the station in a cab with his portmanteau on the top.  Very few of the fellows knew why he had been expelled.  I scarcely knew myself, though I was his greatest chum.  On the morning of the day he left, he met me on his way back from Draven's study.  \"I'm expelled, Smither,\" he said, with a dismal face.  \"Go on,\" replied I, taking his arm and scrutinising his face to see where the joke was hidden.  But it was no joke.  \"I am,\" said he hopelessly: \"I am to go this evening.  It's my own fault.  I've been a cad.  I was led into it.  It's bad enough; but I'm not such a blackleg as Draven makes out--\"  And here for the first time in my life I saw Browne look like breaking down.  He wasn't going to let me see it, and hurried away before I could find anything to say.  If he hadn't told me himself, I should have called any one who told me Browne had been a cad--well, I'd better not say what I should have called him.  I knew my chum had been a rollicking sort of fellow, who found it hard to say No to anybody who asked anything of him; but that he was a blackleg I, for one, would not believe, for all the Dravens in the world.  Hardly knowing what I did, I walked up to the master's study door and knocked.  \"Come in.\"  I could tell by the voice that came through the door I should do no good.  I went in.  Mr Draven was pacing up and down the room, and stopped short in front of me as I entered.  \"Well?\"  I wished I was on the other side of the door; but I wasn't, and must say something, however desperate.  \"Please, sir, Browne--\"  \"Browne leaves here to-day,\" said Mr Draven coldly; \"what do you want?\"  \"Please, sir, I hope you will--\"  I forgot where I was and what I was saying.  My mind wandered aimlessly, and I ended my sentence I don't know how.  Draven saw I was confused, and wasn't unkind.  \"You have been a friend of Browne, I know,\" he said, \"and you are sorry. So am I, terribly sorry,\" and his voice quite quavered as he spoke.  There was a pause, and I made a frantic effort to recall my scattered thoughts.  \"Won't you let him off this time, sir?\"  I gasped.  \"That, Smither, is out of the question,\" said the head master, so steadily and incisively that I gave it up, and left the room without another word.  The fellows were trooping down the passage to breakfast, little guessing the secret of my miserable looks, or the reason why Browne was not in his usual place.  But the secret came out, and the school staggered under the shock.  Mr Draven announced our comrade's departure kindly enough in the afternoon, adding that he had confessed the offence for which he was expelled, and was penitent.  Two hours later we saw his cab drive off, and as we watched it disappear it all seemed to us like a hideous dream.  We said little about it to one another.  We did not even care to inquire particularly into the offence for which he had suffered.  But we moped and missed him at every turn, and wished the miserable term were ending instead of beginning.  This, however, is a long digression.  I sat down to write the story of my own trouble, not Browne's.  But the reader will understand now why I said that, as it was, apart from my own misfortunes, the term, which had still a month more to run when my story begins, had been a dismal one.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  I was wandering about the playground one frosty November morning, beginning to hope that if a frost should come we might after all get a little fun at Draven's before the holidays came, when Odger junior, whistling shrilly, crossed my path.  Odger junior was not exactly my fag, for we had no fags at Draven's, and if we had had, I had not yet reached that pitch of dignity at which one fellow has the right to demand the services of another.  Still Odger junior had, for a consideration, done a good many odd jobs for me, and I had got into the way of regarding him as a quasi-fag.  \"Hullo, youngster!\" said I, as we met, \"there's going to be a stunning frost.  Can't you smell it in the air?  I wish you'd cut down to Bangle's and get me a pair of straps for my skates.\"  To my astonishment, not wholly unmixed with amusement, Odger junior regarded me majestically for a moment, and then, ejaculating the oracular phrase, \"Oh, ah!\" walked off, his four-foot-one drawn to its full height, his hands behind his back, and his mouth still drawn up for whistling, but apparently too overcome with dignity to emit the music which an observer would naturally be led to expect.  I was not on the whole a short-tempered youth.  My laziness saved me from that.  It certainly did occur to me on this bright frosty morning that it would be exhilarating both for young Odger and me if I were to go after him and kick him.  But what was the use?  He would enjoy it as much as I should.  There would be plenty of ways in which to pay him out less fatiguing than an undignified chase round the playground.  So I let him go, and grinned to think how much nicer monkeys are when they behave like monkeys, and not like men.  I had a lot of work to do in my study that morning before afternoon school, and so had very little time to think of Odger junior, or any one else.  As it was, I was only just in time to take my usual place in the Greek class when Mr Draven sailed into the room and the lesson began.  I had been so flurried by my hasty arrival that I did not at first observe that the desk on my right, usually occupied by a boy called Potter, was vacant.  \"Where's Potter?\"  I asked of my neighbour on the left.  \"Is he--why, there he is at Browne's old desk!\"  I added, catching sight of the deserter across the room.  Browne's desk had always been left empty since its late owner went. None of us had cared to appropriate it, and the sight of it day after day had fed our sorrow over his loss.  It seemed to me, therefore, an act almost of disloyalty on Potter's part towards the memory of my old chum to install himself coolly at his desk without saying a word to anybody.  \"What's he gone there for?\"  I inquired of Sadgrove on my left.  \"He's got no--\"  \"Don't talk to me!\" said Sadgrove.  Sadgrove was in a temper, and I wasn't surprised.  So was I, lazy as I was.  We had all stuck to Browne through the term, and it was a little too much now to find a fellow like Potter, who professed to be Browne's friend too, stepping in this cold-blooded way into his place.  Sadgrove was put up to construe, so there was no opportunity for further conversation, had we desired it.  I wasn't surprised that Potter avoided me in the playground after school.  He guessed, I supposed, what I had to say to him, and had the decency to be ashamed of himself.  However, I was determined to have it out, and that evening, after preparation, went up to his study.  He was there, and looked guilty enough when he saw me.  \"Look here, Potter,\" I began, trying to be friendly in spite of all.  I got no further, for Potter, without a word, walked out of the door, leaving me standing alone in the middle of his study.  I had seen the working of a guilty conscience once or twice before at Draven's, but never knew it to work in quite so strange a manner as it did with Potter that evening.  There was nothing for it but to give him up as a bad job, and go to bed. Which I did; and awoke next morning in a forgiving mood.  It was always a scramble at breakfast on Saturdays at Draven's to see who could get nearest to the ham, for we sickened of the cold mutton they gave us on other days.  This morning, to my gratification, I was \"well up.\"  That is, there were only two fellows before me, so that at any rate I was good for a fair, straight slice from the middle.  \"Huzza!\" said I, crowding up to Williams, who was next above me.  \"I've never had anything but knuckle all this--\"  Williams faced round as he heard my voice; and then, without waiting to hear the end of my sentence, got up and took a seat"]]]
