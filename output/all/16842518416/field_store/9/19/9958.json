Augustus had taken the helm, and I       stationed myself by the mast, on the deck of the cuddy. We flew       along at a great rate—neither of us having said a word since       casting loose from the wharf. I now asked my companion what       course he intended to steer, and what time he thought it probable       we should get back. He whistled for a few minutes, and then said       crustily: “_I_ am going to sea—_you_ may go home if you think       proper.” Turning my eyes upon him, I perceived at once that, in       spite of his assumed _nonchalance_, he was greatly agitated. I       could see him distinctly by the light of the moon—his face was       paler than any marble, and his hand shook so excessively that he       could scarcely retain hold of the tiller. I found that something       had gone wrong, and became seriously alarmed. At this period I       knew little about the management of a boat, and was now depending       entirely upon the nautical skill of my friend. The wind, too, had       suddenly increased, as we were fast getting out of the lee of the       land—still I was ashamed to betray any trepidation, and for       almost half an hour maintained a resolute silence. I could stand       it no longer, however, and spoke to Augustus about the propriety       of turning back. As before, it was nearly a minute before he made       answer, or took any notice of my suggestion. “By-and-by,” said he       at length—“time enough—home by-and-by.” I had expected a similar       reply, but there was something in the tone of these words which       filled me with an indescribable feeling of dread. I again looked       at the speaker attentively. His lips were perfectly livid, and       his knees shook so violently together that he seemed scarcely       able to stand. “For God’s sake, Augustus,” I screamed, now       heartily frightened, “what ails you?—what is the matter?—what       _are_ you going to do?” “Matter!” he stammered, in the greatest       apparent surprise, letting go the tiller at the same moment, and       falling forward into the bottom of the boat—“matter—why, nothing       is the—matter—going home—d—d—don’t you see?” The whole truth now       flashed upon me. I flew to him and raised him up. He was       drunk—beastly drunk—he could no longer either stand, speak, or       see. His eyes were perfectly glazed; and as I let him go in the       extremity of my despair, he rolled like a mere log into the       bilge-water, from which I had lifted him. It was evident that,       during the evening, he had drunk far more than I suspected, and       that his conduct in bed had been the result of a       highly-concentrated state of intoxication—a state which, like       madness, frequently enables the victim to imitate the outward       demeanour of one in perfect possession of his senses. The       coolness of the night air, however, had had its usual effect—the       mental energy began to yield before its influence—and the       confused perception which he no doubt then had of his perilous       situation had assisted in hastening the catastrophe. He was now       thoroughly insensible, and there was no probability that he would       be otherwise for many hours.        It is hardly possible to conceive the extremity of my terror. The       fumes of the wine lately taken had evaporated, leaving me doubly       timid and irresolute. I knew that I was altogether incapable of       managing the boat, and that a fierce wind and strong ebb tide       were hurrying us to destruction. A storm was evidently gathering       behind us; we had neither compass nor provisions; and it was       clear that, if we held our present course, we should be out of       sight of land before daybreak. These thoughts, with a crowd of       others equally fearful, flashed through my mind with a       bewildering rapidity, and for some moments paralyzed me beyond       the possibility of making any exertion. The boat was going       through the water at a terrible rate—full before the wind—no reef       in either jib or mainsail—running her bows completely under the       foam. It was a thousand wonders she did not broach to—Augustus       having let go the tiller, as I said before, and I being too much       agitated to think of taking it myself. By good luck, however, she       kept steady, and gradually I recovered some degree of presence of       mind. Still the wind was increasing fearfully, and whenever we       rose from a plunge forward, the sea behind fell combing over our       counter, and deluged us with water. I was so utterly benumbed,       too, in every limb, as to be nearly unconscious of sensation. At       length I summoned up the resolution of despair, and rushing to       the mainsail let it go by the run. As might have been expected,       it flew over the bows, and, getting drenched with water, carried       away the mast short off by the board. This latter accident alone       saved me from instant destruction. Under the jib only, I now       boomed along before the wind, shipping heavy seas occasionally       over the counter, but relieved from the terror of immediate       death. I took the helm, and breathed with greater freedom as I       found that there yet remained to us a chance of ultimate escape.       Augustus still lay senseless in the bottom of the boat; and as       there was imminent danger of his drowning (the water being nearly       a foot deep just where he fell), I contrived to raise him       partially up, and keep him in a sitting position, by passing a       rope round his waist, and lashing it to a ringbolt in the deck of       the cuddy. Having thus arranged every thing as well as I could in       my chilled and agitated condition, I recommended myself to God,       and made up my mind to bear whatever might happen with all the       fortitude in my power.        Hardly had I come to this resolution, when, suddenly, a loud and       long scream or yell, as if from the throats of a thousand demons,       seemed to pervade the whole atmosphere around and above the boat.       Never while I live shall I forget the intense agony of terror I       experienced at that moment. My hair stood erect on my head—I felt       the blood congealing in my veins—my heart ceased utterly to beat,       and without having once raised my eyes to learn the source of my       alarm, I tumbled headlong and insensible upon the body of my       fallen companion.        I found myself, upon reviving, in the cabin of a large       whaling-ship (the Penguin) bound to Nantucket. Several persons       were standing over me, and Augustus, paler than death, was busily       occupied in chafing my hands. Upon seeing me open my eyes, his       exclamations of gratitude and joy excited alternate laughter and       tears from the rough-looking personages who were present. The       mystery of our being in existence was now soon explained. We had       been run down by the whaling-ship, which was close-hauled,       beating up to Nantucket with every sail she could venture to set,       and consequently running almost at right angles to our own       course. Several men were on the look-out forward, but did not       perceive our boat until it was an impossibility to avoid coming       in contact—their shouts of warning upon seeing us were what so       terribly alarmed me. The huge ship, I was told, rode immediately       over us with as much ease as our own little vessel would have       passed over a feather, and without the least perceptible       impediment to her progress. Not a scream arose from the deck of       the victim—there was a slight grating sound to be heard mingling       with the roar of wind and water, as the frail bark which was       swallowed up rubbed for a moment along the keel of her       destroyer—but this was all. Thinking our boat (which it will be       remembered was dismasted) some mere shell cut adrift as useless,       the captain (Captain E. T. V. Block, of New London) was for       proceeding on his course without troubling himself further about       the matter. Luckily, there were two of the look-out who swore       positively to having seen some person at our helm, and       represented the possibility of yet saving him. A discussion       ensued, when Block grew angry, and, after a while, said that “it       was no business of his to be eternally watching for egg-shells;       that the ship should not put about for any such nonsense; and if       there was a man run down, it was nobody’s fault but his own, he       might drown and be dammed” or some language to that effect.       Henderson, the first mate, now took the matter up, being justly       indignant, as well as the whole ship’s crew, at a speech evincing       so base a degree of heartless atrocity. He spoke plainly, seeing       himself upheld by the men, told the captain he considered him a       fit subject for the gallows, and that he would disobey his orders       if he were hanged for it the moment he set his foot on shore. He       strode aft, jostling Block (who turned pale and made no answer)       on one side, and seizing the helm, gave the word, in a firm       voice, Hard-a-lee! The men flew to their posts, and the ship went       cleverly about. All this had occupied nearly five minutes, and it       was supposed to be hardly within the bounds of possibility that       any individual could be saved—allowing any to have been on board       the boat. Yet, as the reader has seen, both Augustus and myself       were rescued; and our deliverance seemed to have been brought       about by two of those almost inconceivable pieces of good fortune       which are attributed by the wise and pious to the special       interference of Providence.        While the ship was yet in stays, the mate lowered the jolly-boat       and jumped into her with the very two men, I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2149"],["title","The Works of Edgar Allan Poe — Volume 3 (#2)"],["body","lieve, who spoke       up as having seen me at the helm. They had just left the lee of       the vessel (the moon still shining brightly) when she made a long       and heavy roll to windward, and Henderson, at the same moment,       starting up in his seat bawled out to his crew to back water. He       would say nothing else—repeating his cry impatiently, back water!       back water! The men put back as speedily as possible, but by this       time the ship had gone round, and gotten fully under headway,       although all hands on board were making great exertions to take       in sail. In despite of the danger of the attempt, the mate clung       to the main-chains as soon as they came within his reach. Another       huge lurch now brought the starboard side of the vessel out of       water nearly as far as her keel, when the cause of his anxiety       was rendered obvious enough. The body of a man was seen to be       affixed in the most singular manner to the smooth and shining       bottom (the Penguin was coppered and copper-fastened), and       beating violently against it with every movement of the hull.       After several ineffectual efforts, made during the lurches of the       ship, and at the imminent risk of swamping the boat I was finally       disengaged from my perilous situation and taken on board—for the       body proved to be my own. It appeared that one of the       timber-bolts having started and broken a passage through the       copper, it had arrested my progress as I passed under the ship,       and fastened me in so extraordinary a manner to her bottom. The       head of the bolt had made its way through the collar of the green       baize jacket I had on, and through the back part of my neck,       forcing itself out between two sinews and just below the right       ear. I was immediately put to bed—although life seemed to be       totally extinct. There was no surgeon on board. The captain,       however, treated me with every attention—to make amends, I       presume, in the eyes of his crew, for his atrocious behaviour in       the previous portion of the adventure.        In the meantime, Henderson had again put off from the ship,       although the wind was now blowing almost a hurricane. He had not       been gone many minutes when he fell in with some fragments of our       boat, and shortly afterward one of the men with him asserted that       he could distinguish a cry for help at intervals amid the roaring       of the tempest. This induced the hardy seamen to persevere in       their search for more than half an hour, although repeated       signals to return were made them by Captain Block, and although       every moment on the water in so frail a boat was fraught to them       with the most imminent and deadly peril. Indeed, it is nearly       impossible to conceive how the small jolly they were in could       have escaped destruction for a single instant. She was built,       however, for the whaling service, and was fitted, as I have since       had reason to believe, with air-boxes, in the manner of some       life-boats used on the coast of Wales.        After searching in vain for about the period of time just       mentioned, it was determined to get back to the ship. They had       scarcely made this resolve when a feeble cry arose from a dark       object that floated rapidly by. They pursued and soon overtook       it. It proved to be the entire deck of the Ariel’s cuddy.       Augustus was struggling near it, apparently in the last agonies.       Upon getting hold of him it was found that he was attached by a       rope to the floating timber. This rope, it will be remembered, I       had myself tied around his waist, and made fast to a ringbolt,       for the purpose of keeping him in an upright position, and my so       doing, it appeared, had been ultimately the means of preserving       his life. The Ariel was slightly put together, and in going down       her frame naturally went to pieces; the deck of the cuddy, as       might have been expected, was lifted, by the force of the water       rushing in, entirely from the main timbers, and floated (with       other fragments, no doubt) to the surface—Augustus was buoyed up       with it, and thus escaped a terrible death.        It was more than an hour after being taken on board the Penguin       before he could give any account of himself, or be made to       comprehend the nature of the accident which had befallen our       boat. At length he became thoroughly aroused, and spoke much of       his sensations while in the water. Upon his first attaining any       degree of consciousness, he found himself beneath the surface,       whirling round and round with inconceivable rapidity, and with a       rope wrapped in three or four folds tightly about his neck. In an       instant afterward he felt himself going rapidly upward, when, his       head striking violently against a hard substance, he again       relapsed into insensibility. Upon once more reviving he was in       fuller possession of his reason—this was still, however, in the       greatest degree clouded and confused. He now knew that some       accident had occurred, and that he was in the water, although his       mouth was above the surface, and he could breathe with some       freedom. Possibly, at this period the deck was drifting rapidly       before the wind, and drawing him after it, as he floated upon his       back. Of course, as long as he could have retained this position,       it would have been nearly impossible that he should be drowned.       Presently a surge threw him directly athwart the deck, and this       post he endeavored to maintain, screaming at intervals for help.       Just before he was discovered by Mr. Henderson, he had been       obliged to relax his hold through exhaustion, and, falling into       the sea, had given himself up for lost. During the whole period       of his struggles he had not the faintest recollection of the       Ariel, nor of the matters in connexion with the source of his       disaster. A vague feeling of terror and despair had taken entire       possession of his faculties. When he was finally picked up, every       power of his mind had failed him; and, as before said, it was       nearly an hour after getting on board the Penguin before he       became fully aware of his condition. In regard to myself—I was       resuscitated from a state bordering very nearly upon death (and       after every other means had been tried in vain for three hours       and a half) by vigorous friction with flannels bathed in hot       oil—a proceeding suggested by Augustus. The wound in my neck,       although of an ugly appearance, proved of little real       consequence, and I soon recovered from its effects.        The Penguin got into port about nine o’clock in the morning,       after encountering one of the severest gales ever experienced off       Nantucket. Both Augustus and myself managed to appear at Mr.       Barnard’s in time for breakfast—which, luckily, was somewhat       late, owing to the party over night. I suppose all at the table       were too much fatigued themselves to notice our jaded       appearance—of course, it would not have borne a very rigid       scrutiny. Schoolboys, however, can accomplish wonders in the way       of deception, and I verily believe not one of our friends in       Nantucket had the slightest suspicion that the terrible story       told by some sailors in town of their having run down a vessel at       sea and drowned some thirty or forty poor devils, had reference       either to the Ariel, my companion, or myself. We two have since       very frequently talked the matter over—but never without a       shudder. In one of our conversations Augustus frankly confessed       to me, that in his whole life he had at no time experienced so       excruciating a sense of dismay, as when on board our little boat       he first discovered the extent of his intoxication, and felt       himself sinking beneath its influence.     CHAPTER 2         In no affairs of mere prejudice, pro or con, do we deduce       inferences with entire certainty, even from the most simple data.       It might be supposed that a catastrophe such as I have just       related would have effectually cooled my incipient passion for       the sea. On the contrary, I never experienced a more ardent       longing for the wild adventures incident to the life of a       navigator than within a week after our miraculous deliverance.       This short period proved amply long enough to erase from my       memory the shadows, and bring out in vivid light all the       pleasurably exciting points of color, all the picturesqueness, of       the late perilous accident. My conversations with Augustus grew       daily more frequent and more intensely full of interest. He had a       manner of relating his stories of the ocean (more than one half       of which I now suspect to have been sheer fabrications) well       adapted to have weight with one of my enthusiastic temperament       and somewhat gloomy although glowing imagination. It is strange,       too, that he most strongly enlisted my feelings in behalf of the       life of a seaman, when he depicted his more terrible moments of       suffering and despair. For the bright side of the painting I had       a limited sympathy. My visions were of shipwreck and famine; of       death or captivity among barbarian hordes; of a lifetime dragged       out in sorrow and tears, upon some gray and desolate rock, in an       ocean unapproachable and unknown. Such visions or desires—for       they amounted to desires—are common, I have since been assured,       to the whole numerous race of the melancholy among men—at the       time of which I speak I regarded them only as prophetic glimpses       of a destiny which I felt myself in a measure bound to fulfil.
