The boys moved softly around the glade, Basil going foremost.  When within range, as he thought, he raised his rifle, levelled it, and was about to pull trigger, when the squirrel, that up to this moment had not noticed him, gave a sudden start, dropped its tail, and ran down the limb as if terrified.  It did not stop until it had reached the main trunk.  There it halted, a foot or two from the head, and lay flat against the bark.  What could have alarmed it?  Not the boys, for it had not minded them before; moreover, it still kept upon their side of the tree, offering as fair a mark as ever.  Had it feared them it would, as all squirrels do, have hidden from them behind the trunk.  But no, it was not afraid of them; for, as it lay horizontally along the bark, its head was turned upward, and showed, by a peculiar motion, that it dreaded some enemy from above.  And this was the fact, for high up and directly over the tree, a large bird of prey was seen circling in the air.  \"Hold!\" whispered Lucien, laying his hand upon Basil's arm--\"hold, brother! it is the red-tailed hawk.  See, he is going to swoop down. Let us watch him.\"  Basil lowered his rifle, and all three stood waiting.  A leafy branch was over their heads, so that the bird did not see them, or, intent upon striking his prey, did not care for their presence at the moment.  Lucien had scarcely spoken, when the hawk, that had hitherto been sailing with his broad wings expanded, suddenly narrowed his tail, drew in his wings, and came down with a loud \"whish-sh-sh!\"  He dropped almost perpendicularly, grazing the squirrel so closely, that all three looked for it in his talons as he flew off again.  Not so, however.  The squirrel had been upon his guard; and, as the hawk swooped down, had doubled around the tree with the quickness of a flash of lightning.  By the guidance of his rudder-like tail the hawk soon turned, and flew round to that side of the tree on which the squirrel had now settled.  A few strokes of his powerful wings soon enabled him to reach the proper elevation; and again he swooped downward at his intended victim.  The squirrel avoided him as before, and came back on the other side of the trunk.  Again the hawk doubled, rose, darted downward at his prey, missed it, and swept on.  A fourth attempt met with like success, and the bird once more flew back into the air, but still kept circling over the tree.  \"It's a wonder old foxy doesn't take to another tree,\" muttered Francois; \"one with branches enough to shelter him, or to his own tree where his hole is.  There he would be safe.\"  \"That's exactly what he wishes to do,\" replied Lucien.  \"But see! his enemy is directly over him.  There's no tree near enough, and if he attempted to run along the open ground, the hawk would be down upon him like a shot.  You saw how suddenly he dropped before?\"  This was, in fact, the situation in which the squirrel was.  It was evident he regarded the trees at some distance with a wistful and anxious look; for, although he had succeeded so far in baffling his enemy, he still appeared to suffer from suspense and fear.  As soon as the hawk had risen a dozen yards or so above the tree, he again commenced wheeling in circles, uttering a strange cry as he flew. It was not a scream--as is often heard with these birds--but a cry of different import, as if a call to some comrade.  It was so in fact, for in a moment it was answered from a distant part of the woods; and the next moment, another hawk--red-tailed like himself, but much larger--was seen soaring upwards.  This was evidently his mate--for the female of these birds is always much larger than the males.  The two soon came together, and wheeled above the tree, crossing each other's orbit, and looking downward.  The squirrel now appeared doubly terrified--for he well knew their intent.  He began to run around the trunk, looking outward at intervals, as though he intended to leap off and take to the thick woods.  The hawks did not allow him long time to make up his mind.  The smaller one swooped first, but missed the squirrel as before, driving him around the trunk.  There the frightened creature had scarcely halted, when the great hen-hawk came at him with a whistling rush, and sent him back to the other side.  The male bird had by this time turned and now darted with such suddenness and precision, that the squirrel, unable to pass round the tree again, sprang off into the air.  Guided by his broad tail the hawk followed, and before the squirrel could reach the ground, the bird was seen to strike.  Then with a loud scream he rose into the air, with the squirrel struggling in his talons.  His triumph was a short one.  The crack of a shot gun was heard from behind, and both hawk and squirrel fell heavily to the earth.  Another crack followed, almost instantaneously, and his mate, the great hen-hawk, came tumbling down with a broken wing, and fluttered over the grass, screaming like a cat.  She was soon silenced by a stroke from the butt of Francois' gun--both barrels of which were now empty--for it was Francois that had done the business for the red-tails.  What was most singular of all, the squirrel was not killed either by the shot or the fall.  On the contrary, as Lucien was deliberately stooping to pick it up--congratulating himself all the while upon his prize--it suddenly made a spring, shook itself clear of the claws of the dead hawk; and, streaking off into the woods, ran up a tall tree.  All three followed as fast as they could run; but on reaching the tree--an oak five feet thick--they saw, to their mortification, the squirrel's hole about fifty feet from the ground, which, of course, brought that squirrel hunt to its termination.    CHAPTER SEVEN.  FRANCOIS GETS AN UGLY FALL.  The next encampment of our hunters was upon the Bayou Crocodile.  This, like all the bayous of Louisiana, is a sluggish stream, and here and there expands itself into large ponds or lakes.  It is called Bayou Crocodile from the great number of alligators that infest its waters, though in this respect it differs but little from the other rivers of Louisiana.  The spot chosen for the camp was an open space upon the bank, at a point where the bayou widened into a small lake.  The situation commanded a view of the shores of this lake all round--and a singular view that was. Giant trees rose over the water--live oaks and cypresses--and from their spreading branches the Spanish moss hung trailing down like long streamers of silver thread.  This gave the upper part of the woods a somewhat hoary appearance, and would have rendered the scene rather a melancholy one, had it not been for the more brilliant foliage that relieved it.  Here and there a green magnolia glistened in the sun, with its broad white flowers, each of them as large as a dining-plate. Underneath grew the thick cane (_arundo gigantea_), its tall pale-green reeds standing parallel to each other, and ending in lance-shaped blades, like stalks of giant wheat before its ears have shot.  Over this again rose the grey limbs of the tupeloo-tree (_nyssa aquatica_), with light leaves and thin foliage.  The beautiful palmetto (_chamaerops_) lifted its fan-like branches, as if to screen the earth from the hot sun that poured down upon it, and here and there its singular shapes were shadowed in the water.  From tree to tree huge parasites stretched like cables--vines, and lianas, and various species of convolvulus.  Some of these were covered with thick foliage, while others exhibited a surface of splendid flowers.  The scarlet cups of the trumpet-vine (_bignonia_), the white starlike blossoms of the cypress-creeper, and the pink flowers of the wild althea or cotton-rose (_hibiscus grandiflora_), all blended their colours, inviting the large painted butterflies and ruby-throated humming birds that played among their silken corollas.  As if in contrast with these bright spots in the landscape, there were others that looked dark and gloomy.  You could see through long vistas in the forest, where the trees grew out of green slimy water.  Here there was no underwood, either of cane or palmettoes.  The black trunks of the cypresses rose branchless for nearly an hundred feet, and from their spreading limbs drooped the grey weeping moss.  Huge \"knees\" could be distinguished shooting up like cones or trees that had been broken off leaving their broken trunks in the ground.  Sometimes a huge creeper, a foot or more in diameter, stretched across these gloomy aisles, as though a monster serpent were passing from tree to tree.  The lake was alive with alligators.  These could be seen basking along the low banks, or crawling away into the dark and shadowy swamp.  Some were floating gently on the surface of the stream, their long crests and notched backs protruding above the water.  When not in motion these hideous creatures resembled dead logs of wood; and most of them were lying quiet--partly from their natural disinclination to move about, and partly waiting for their prey.  Those that basked upon the banks held their jaws expanded, that at intervals were heard to close with a loud snap.  These were amusing themselves by catching the flies, that, attracted by the musky odour, flew around their hideous jaws, and lit upon their slimy tongues.  Some were fishing in the stream, and at intervals the stroke of their tails upon the water could be heard at the distance of half a mile or more.  Their croaking resounded through the woods somewhat like the noise made by bull-frogs, but loud and terrible as the bellowing of bulls.  A horrid appearance they presented; but our hunters were accustomed to the sight, and had no fear of these animals.  There were other objects around the lake more pleasing to contemplate. On a distant point stood a troop of flamingoes, drawn up in order like a company of soldiers,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21236"],["title","The Boy Hunters (#6)"],["body","scarlet plumage shining in the sun.  Near them was a flock of whooping-cranes--each as tall as a full-grown man-- at intervals uttering their loud trumpet notes.  The great egret, too, was there, with its snowy plumage and orange bill; the delicately-formed Louisiana heron, with droves of sand-hill cranes, appearing in the distance like flocks of white sheep.  Pelicans, with their pouched throats and scythe-like bills, stood in melancholy attitudes, and beside them were the white and scarlet ibis, and the purple gallinule.  Roseate spoonbills waded through the shallows, striking their odd-shaped beaks at the crabs and cray-fish; and upon projecting limbs of trees perched the black darter, his long snake-like neck stretched eagerly over the water.  In the air a flock of buzzard vultures were wheeling lazily about, and a pair of ospreys hung over the lake, now and then swooping down upon their finny prey.  Such was the scene around the camp of the boy hunters, a scene often to be witnessed among the wilderness-swamps of Louisiana.  The tent was set near the bank of the bayou, where the ground was dry and high.  The spot was open--only a few scattered palmettos growing over it--and the animals were picketed upon the grass near by.  There was venison for supper.  Basil's unerring rifle had brought down a doe, just as they were about to halt; and Basil was an accomplished butcher of such-like game.  The doe was soon skinned, and the choice pieces cut out--enough to serve for supper and breakfast upon the following morning.  The haunches were hung on a limb, to be carried along, as the next day's hunt might not turn out so successful.  There was still enough left to make a splendid supper for Marengo, and that hungry animal took full advantage of the occasion.  He knew that in an excursion like the present it was not every day that a fat doe turned up; or when it did, that such a portion of its carcass was likely to fall to his share.  It was still early, wanting full two hours of sunset, when the hunters finished their supper--dinner it should rather be called--as, with the exception of some dry mouthfuls at their noon halt, they had not eaten since breakfast.  When the meal was over, Basil again looked to repairing the harness of the mule--that had got out of order on the march--while Lucien drew out his note-book and pencil, and, sitting down upon a buffalo-robe, commenced entering his observations for the day.  Francois having no employment, resolved upon creeping around the edge of the bayou, to have a shot at the flamingoes, if he should be lucky enough to get near them. This he knew would be no easy matter, but he had made up his mind to try it; and, having told his brothers of his intention, he shouldered his gun and went off.  He was soon out of sight, having passed into some thick timber that grew along the edge of the water, through which there was a plain trail made by deer and other wild animals.  He kept along this trail, sheltering himself behind the trees, so that the flamingoes, that were several hundred yards farther down the bayou, might not see him as he approached.  He had not been out of sight more than five minutes, when Basil and Lucien were startled by the report of a gun, and then another following quickly after.  They knew it was Francois' fowling-piece; but what had he fired at?  It could not have been the flamingoes, as he had not had time to get within range of them.  Besides, the birds, where they had been sitting on the far shore, were visible from the camp; and all of them, affrighted by the reports, were now seen winging their way over the tops of the trees.  No, it could not have been at the flamingoes Francois had fired.  What then?  This was the question which Basil and Lucien put to each other, not without some feelings of anxiety. Perhaps, thought they, Francois has sprung a deer, or trampled up a flock of turkeys?  So the brothers were fain to conjecture; but their conjectures were soon ended by Francois himself, who was heard far off through the woods, shouting in a fearful manner.  Basil and Lucien seized their rifles, and ran forward to find him; but before they could reach the piece of timber, Francois was seen coming up the trail between the trees, and running as if for his life!  In front of him an object appeared, like a dead log, lying directly across the path.  It could not be that, for it was in motion.  It was a living animal--an alligator!  It was one, too, of the largest dimensions--nearly twenty feet in length, and lay right across the path.  Basil and Lucien saw it the moment they got opposite the opening.  They saw, too, it was not that which was putting Francois to his speed, for he was running directly upon it.  Something behind him occupied all his thoughts, and he did not see the alligator at all; for, although his brothers shouted to warn him, he ran on; and, stumbling over the hideous body of the reptile, fell flat upon his face--his gun pitching forward out of his hands as he fell.  He was not hurt, however, but, scrambling to his feet again, continued his race, shouting, as he emerged half breathless out of the bushes, \"A bear! a bear!\"  Basil and Lucien, making ready their pieces, looked along the trail. There, sure enough, was a bear coming up as fast as he could gallop.  It was at him Francois had fired.  The small shot had only served to irritate him; and, seeing such a puny antagonist as Francois, he had given chase.  At first they all thought of taking to their heels, and seeking safety by mounting their horses; but the bear had got too near, and one or other might be caught before they could reach the horses and loose them. They resolved, therefore, to make a stand.  Basil, who had been at the killing of a black bear before now, was not so much afraid of the encounter; so he and Lucien held their rifles in readiness to give Bruin a warm reception.  The latter came lumbering on, until he had reached the place where the alligator lay.  The reptile had turned itself half round, and was now standing on its short legs, lengthwise along the path, puffing like a pair of blacksmith's bellows.  The bear, intent upon his pursuit of Francois, did not see it until he had stumbled right upon its body; and then, uttering a loud snort, he leaped to one side.  This gave the alligator the very opportunity he would have sought; and the next moment his powerful tail was lashed with such force against the bear, that the ribs of the latter were heard to crack under the blow.  The bear--who would otherwise have left the alligator to himself--became so infuriated at this unprovoked assault, that he turned and sprang upon his new enemy, seizing him round the body in a firm hug.  Both struggled over the ground, the one growling and snorting, while the other uttered a sound like the routing of a bull.  How long the conflict would have lasted, and which would have proved victor had they been left to themselves, is not known; for Basil and Lucien both fired, wounding the bear.  This caused him to relax his hug, and he now seemed anxious to get off; but the reptile had seized one of his feet in his powerful jaws and thus held him fast, all the while crawling and dragging him down to the water.  The bear was evidently aware of the intention of his antagonist, and uttered loud and pitiful moanings, at times screaming like a hog under the knife of the butcher. It was all to no purpose.  His unrelenting enemy gained the bank; and dragging him along, plunged into the deep water.  Both went down together--completely disappearing from the eyes of the spectators--and although the boys watched for nearly an hour, neither beast nor reptile were seen to rise again to the surface.  The bear no doubt had been drowned at once, and the alligator, after having suffocated him, had hidden his carcass in the mud, or dragged it along the bottom to some other part of the bayou--there to make a meal of it at his leisure.    CHAPTER EIGHT.  ABOUT ALLIGATORS.  The boys now returned to their tent, impressed with curious feelings by the scene they had just witnessed.  They lay down upon the grass, and entered into a conversation, of which bears and alligators formed the subjects.  The latter, however, with their singular and revolting habits, came in for the greater share of their talk.  Many odd stories in relation to them were known to all, even to the little Francois; and Basil being an old hunter among the swamps and bayous, was acquainted with many of the habits of these animals.  But Basil was not much of an observer; and he had only noticed such peculiarities as, from time to time, were forced upon his attention by the incidents of the chase. Lucien, however, had more closely observed their habits, and had also studied them from books.  He was, therefore, well acquainted with all that is known to the naturalist concerning these animals; and at the request of his brothers he consented to while away the twilight hours, by imparting to them such information about them as he himself possessed.  \"The alligator,\" began he, \"belongs to the order _Sauria_, or lizards. This order is again divided into several families, one of which is termed _Crocodilida_, or crocodiles; and the family of crocodiles is subdivided into three genera, each of which has several species.\"  \"How many species in all?\" demanded Basil.  \"There are not more than a dozen varieties of the whole crocodile family--at least, there are not more known to naturalists.\"  \"Then I was thinking why there should be all this division and subdivision into orders, families, genera, and species, for a dozen varieties of the same animal, and these all so like each other in shape and habits--are they not so?\"  \"They are,\" answered Lucien, \"very similar in their characteristics.\"  \"Then, why so much classing of them?  It appears to me to be quite useless.\"  \"The object of this classing is to make the study of their natural history more easy"]]]
