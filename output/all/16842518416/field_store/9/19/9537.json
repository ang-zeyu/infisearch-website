The noblest combatants had now fallen on either side, and force of arms had proved unable to accomplish what stratagem at length effects.  It is Ulysses who now steps into the foreground and becomes the real conqueror of Troy.  By his advice a wooden horse is built, in whose inside he and other heroes conceal themselves.  The infatuated Trojans admit the horse within their walls. In the dead of night the Greeks rush out and open the gates to their comrades.  Troy is delivered over to the sword, and its glory sinks in ashes.  The fall of Troy is placed in the year 1184 B.C.  The return of the Grecian leaders from Troy forms another series of poetical legends.  Several meet with tragical ends.  Agamemnon is murdered on his arrival at Mycenae, by his wife Clytaemnestra and her paramour AEgisthus.  But of these wanderings the most celebrated and interesting are those of Ulysses, which form the subject of the Odyssey.  After twenty years' absence he arrives at length in Ithaca, where he slays the numerous suitors who devoured his substance and contended for the hand of his wife Penelope.  The Homeric poems must not be regarded as a record of historical persons and events, but, at the same time, they present a valuable picture of the institutions and manners of the earliest known state of Grecian society.  In the Heroic age Greece was already divided into a number of independent states, each governed by its own king.  The authority of the king was not limited by any laws; his power resembled that of the patriarchs in the Old Testament; and for the exercise of it he was responsible only to Zeus, and not to his people.  But though the king was not restrained in the exercise of his power by any positive laws, his authority was practically limited by the BOULE; or council of chiefs, and the Agora, or general assembly of freemen.  These two bodies, of little account in the Heroic age, became in the Republican age the sole depositories of political power.  The Greeks in the Heroic age were divided into the three classes of nobles, common freemen, and slaves.  The nobles were raised far above the rest of the community in honour, power, and wealth. They were distinguished by their warlike prowess, their large estates, and their numerous slaves.  The condition of the general mass of freemen is rarely mentioned.  They possessed portions of land as their own property, which they cultivated themselves; but there was another class of poor freemen, called Thetes, who had no land of their own, and who worked for hire on the estates of others.  Slavery was not so prevalent in the Heroic age as at a later time, and appears in a less odious aspect.  The nobles alone possessed slaves, and they treated them with a degree of kindness which frequently secured for the masters their affectionate attachment.  Society was marked by simplicity of manners.  The kings and nobles did not consider it derogatory to their dignity to acquire skill in the manual arts.  Ulysses is represented as building his own bed-chamber and constructing his own raft, and he boasts of being an excellent mower and ploughman.  Like Esau, who made savoury meat for his father Isaac, the Heroic chiefs prepared their own meals and prided themselves on their skill in cookery. Kings and private persons partook of the same food, which was of the simplest kind.  Beef, mutton, and goat's flesh were the ordinary meats, and cheese, flour, and sometimes fruits, also formed part of the banquet; wine was drunk diluted with water, and the entertainments were never disgraced by intemperance, like those of our northern ancestors.  The enjoyment of the banquet was heightened by the song and the dance, and the chiefs took more delight in the lays of the minstrel than in the exciting influence of the wine.  The wives and daughters of the chiefs, in like manner, did not deem it beneath them to discharge various duties which were afterwards regarded as menial.  Not only do we find them constantly employed in weaving, spinning and embroidery, but like the daughters of the patriarchs they fetch water from the well and assist their slaves in washing garments in the river.  Even at this early age the Greeks had made considerable advances in civilization.  They were collected in fortified towns, which were surrounded by walls and adorned with palaces and temples. The massive ruins of Mycenae and the sculptured lions on the gate of this city belong to the Heroic age, and still excite the wonder of the beholder. Commerce, however, was little cultivated, and was not much esteemed. It was deemed more honourable for a man to enrich himself by robbery and piracy than by the arts of peace.  Coined money is not mentioned in the poems of Homer.  Whether the Greeks were acquainted at this early period with the art of writing is a question which has given rise to much dispute, and must remain undetermined; but poetry was cultivated with success, though yet confined to epic strains, or the narration of the exploits and adventures of the Heroic chiefs.  The bard sung his own song, and was always received with welcome and honour in the palaces of the nobles.  In the battle, as depicted by Homer, the chiefs are the only important combatants, while the people are an almost useless mass, frequently put to rout by the prowess of a single hero. The chief is mounted in a war chariot, and stands by the side of his charioteer, who is frequently a friend.    CHAPTER III.  GENERAL SURVEY OF THE GREEK PEOPLE--NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS.  The Greeks, as we have already seen, were divided into many independent communities, but several causes bound them together as one people.  Of these the most important were community of blood and language--community of religious rites and festivals--and community of manners and character.  All the Greeks were descended from the same ancestor and spoke the same language.  They all described men and cities which were not Grecian by the term BARBARIAN.  This word has passed into our own language, but with a very different idea; for the Greeks applied it indiscriminately to every foreigner, to the civilized inhabitants of Egypt and Persia, as well as to the rude tribes of Scythia and Gaul.  The second bond of union was a community of religious rites and festivals.  From the earliest times the Greeks appear to have worshipped the same gods; but originally there were no religious meetings common to the whole nation.  Such meetings were of gradual growth, being formed by a number of neighbouring towns, which entered into an association for the periodical celebration of certain religious rites.  Of these the most celebrated was the AMPHICTYONIC COUNCIL.  It acquired its superiority over other similar associations by the wealth and grandeur of the Delphian temple, of which it was the appointed guardian.  It held two meetings every year, one in the spring at the temple of Apollo at Delphi, and the other in the autumn at the temple of Demeter (Ceres) at Thermopylae.  Its members, who were called the Amphictyons, consisted of sacred deputies sent from twelve tribes, each of which contained several independent cities or states.  But the Council was never considered as a national congress, whose duty it was to protect and defend the common interests of Greece; and it was only when the rights of the Delphian god had been violated that it invoked the aid of the various members of the league.  The Olympic Games were of greater efficacy than the amphictyonic council in promoting a spirit of union among the various branches of the Greek race, and in keeping alive a feeling of their common origin. They were open to all persons who could prove their Hellenic blood, and were frequented by spectators from all parts of the Grecian world. They were celebrated at Olympia, on the banks of the Alpheus, in the territory of Elis.  The origin of the festival is lost in obscurity; but it is said to have been revived by Iphitus, king of Elis, and Lycurgus the Spartan legislator, in the year 776 B.C.; and, accordingly, when the Greeks at a later time began to use the Olympic contest as a chronological era, this year was regarded as the first Olympiad. It was celebrated at the end of every four years, and the interval which elapsed between each celebration was called an Olympiad. The whole festival was under the management of the Eleans, who appointed some of their own number to preside as judges, under the name of the Hellanodicae.  During the month in which it was celebrated all hostilities were suspended throughout Greece.  At first the festival was confined to a single day, and consisted of nothing more than a match of runners in the stadium; but in course of time so many other contests were introduced, that the games occupied five days.  They comprised various trials of strength and skill, such as wrestling boxing, the Pancratium (boxing and wrestling combined), and the complicated Pentathlum (including jumping, running, the quoit, the javelin, and wrestling), but no combats with any kind of weapons. There were also horse-races and chariot-races; and the chariot-race, with four full-grown horses, became one of the most popular and celebrated of all the matches.  The only prize given to the conqueror was a garland of wild olive; but this was valued as one of the dearest distinctions in life.  To have his name proclaimed as victor before assembled Hellas was an object of ambition with the noblest and the wealthiest of the Greeks.  Such a person was considered to have conferred everlasting glory upon his family and his country, and was rewarded by his fellow-citizens with distinguished honours.  During the sixth century before the Christian era three other national festivals--the Pythian, Nemean, and Isthmian games--which were at first only local became open to the whole nation. The Pythian games were celebrated in every"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2096"],["title","A Smaller History of Greece: from the Earliest Times to the Roman Conquest (#3)"],["body","Olympic year, on the Cirrhaean plain in Phocis, under the superintendence of the Amphictyons.  The games consisted not only of matches in gymnastics and of horse and chariot races, but also of contests in music and poetry.  They soon acquired celebrity, and became second only to the great Olympic festival.  The Nemean and Isthmian games occurred more frequently than the Olympic and Pythian.  They were celebrated once in two years--the Nemean in the valley of Nemea between Phlius and Cleonae--and the Isthmian by the Corinthians, on their isthmus, in honour of Poseidon (Neptune).  As in the Pythian festival, contests in music and in poetry, as well as gymnastics and chariot-races, formed part of these games.  Although the four great festivals of which we have been speaking had no influence in promoting the political union of Greece, they nevertheless were of great importance in making the various sections of the race feel that they were all members of one family, and in cementing them together by common sympathies and the enjoyment of common pleasures.  The frequent occurrence of these festivals, for one was celebrated every gear, tended to the same result.  The Greeks were thus annually reminded of their common origin, and of the great distinction which existed between them and barbarians.  Nor must we forget the incidental advantages which attended them.  The concourse of so large a number of persons from every part of the Grecian world afforded to the merchant opportunities for traffic, and to the artist and the literary man the best means of making their works known.  During the time of the games a busy commerce was carried on; and in a spacious hall appropriated for the purpose, the poets, philosophers, and historians were accustomed to read their most recent works.  The habit of consulting the same oracles in order to ascertain the will of the gods was another bond of union.  It was the universal practice of the Greeks to undertake no matter of importance without first asking the advice of the gods; and there were many sacred spots in which the gods were always ready to give an answer to pious worshippers.  The oracle of Apollo at Delphi surpassed all the rest in importance, and was regarded with veneration in every part of the Grecian world.  In the centre of the temple of Delphi there was a small opening in the ground, from which it was said that a certain gas or vapour ascended. Whenever the oracle was to be consulted, a virgin priestess called PYTHIA took her seat upon a tripod which was placed over the chasm. The ascending vapour affected her brain, and the words which she uttered in this excited condition were believed to be the answer of Apollo to his worshippers.  They were always in hexameter verse, and were reverently taken down by the attendant priests.  Most of the answers were equivocal or obscure; but the credit of the oracle continued unimpaired long after the downfall of Grecian independence.  A further element of union among the Greeks was the similarity of manners and character.  It is true the difference in this respect between the polished inhabitants of Athens and the rude mountaineers of Acarnania was marked and striking; but if we compare the two with foreign contemporaries, the contrast between them and the latter is still more striking.  Absolute despotism human sacrifices, polygamy, deliberate mutilation of the person as a punishment, and selling of children into slavery, existed in some part or other of the barbarian world, but are not found in any city of Greece in the historical times.  The elements of union of which we have been speaking only bound the Greeks together in common feelings and sentiments:  they never produced any political union.  The independent sovereignty of each city was a fundamental notion in the Greek mind.  This strongly rooted feeling deserves particular notice.  Careless readers of history are tempted to suppose that the territory of Greece was divided among comparatively small number of independent states, such as Attica, Arcadia, Boeotia, Phocis, Locris, and the like; but this is a most serious mistake, and leads to a total misapprehension of Greek history.  Every separate city was usually an independent state, and consequently each of the territories described under the general names of Arcadia, Boeotia, Phocis, and Locris, contained numerous political communities independent of one another.  Attica, it is true, formed a single state, and its different towns recognised Athens as their capital and the source of supreme power; but this is an exception to the general rule.    CHAPTER IV.  EARLY HISTORY OF PELOPONNESUS AND SPARTA, DOWN TO THE END OF THE MESSENIAN WARS, B.C. 668.  In the heroic age Peloponnesus was occupied by tribes of Dorian conquerors.  They had no share in the glories of the Heroic age; their name does not occur in the Iliad, and they are only once mentioned in the Odyssey; but they were destined to form in historical times one of the most important elements of the Greek nation.  Issuing from their mountain district between Thessaly, Locris and Phocis, they overran the greater part of Peloponnesus, destroyed the ancient Achaean monarchies and expelled or reduced to subjection the original inhabitants of the land, of which they became the undisputed masters.  This brief statement contains all that we know for certain respecting this celebrated event, which the ancient writers placed eighty years after the Trojan war (B.C. 1104).  The legendary account of the conquest of Peloponnesus ran as follows:--The Dorians were led by the Heraclidae, or descendants of the mighty hero Hercules.  Hence this migration is called the Return of the Heraclidae.  The children of Hercules had long been fugitives upon the face of the earth.  They had made many attempts to regain possession of the dominions in the Peloponnesus, of which their great sire had been deprived by Eurystheus, but hitherto without success.  In their last attempt Hyllus, the son of Hercules, had perished in single combat with Echemus of Tegea; and the Heraclidae had become bound by a solemn compact to renounce their enterprise for a hundred years.  This period had now expired; and the great-grandsons of Hyllus--Temenus, Cresphontes, and Aristodemus--resolved to make a fresh attempt to recover their birthright.  They were assisted in the enterprise by the Dorians.  This people espoused their cause in consequence of the aid which Hercules himself had rendered to the Dorian king, AEgimius, when the latter was hard pressed in a contest with the Lapithae.  The invaders were warned by an oracle not to enter Peloponnesus by the Isthmus of Corinth, but across the mouth of the Corinthian gulf.  The inhabitants of the northern coast of the gulf were favourable to their enterprise. Oxylus, king of the AEtolians, became their guide; and from Naupactus they crossed over to Peloponnesus.  A single battle decided the contest.  Tisamenus, the son of Orestes, was defeated and retired with a portion of his Achaean subjects to the northern coast of Peloponnesus, then occupied by the Ionians. He expelled the Ionians, and took possession of the country, which continued henceforth to be inhabited by the Achaeans, and to be called after them.  The Ionians withdrew to Attica, and the greater part of them afterwards emigrated to Asia Minor.  The Heraclidae and the Dorians now divided between them the dominions of Tisamenus and of the other Achaean princes.  The kingdom of Elis was given to Oxylus as a recompense for his services as their guide; and it was agreed that Temenus, Cresphontes, and Eurysthenes and Procles, the infant sons of Aristodemus (who had died at Naupactus), should draw lots for Argos, Sparta, and Messenia.  Argos fell to Temenus, Sparta to Eurysthenes and Procles, and Messenia to Cresphontes.  Such are the main features of the legend of the Return of the Heraclidae.  In order to make the story more striking and impressive, it compresses into a single epoch events which probably occupied several generations.  It is in itself improbable that the brave Achaeans quietly submitted to the Dorian invaders after a momentary struggle.  We have, moreover, many indications that such was not the fact, and that it was only gradually and after a long protracted contest that the Dorians became undisputed masters of the greater part of Peloponnesus.  Argos was originally the chief Dorian state in Peloponnesus, but at the time of the first Olympiad its power had been supplanted by that of Sparta.  The progress of Sparta from the second to the first place among the states in the peninsula was mainly owing to the military discipline and rigorous training of its citizens. The singular constitution of Sparta was unanimously ascribed by the ancients to the legislator Lycurgus, but there were different stories respecting his date, birth, travels, legislation, and death.  His most probable date however is B.C. 776, in which year he is said to have assisted Iphitus in restoring the Olympic games.  He was the son of Eunomus, one of the two kings who reigned together in Sparta.  On the death of his father, his elder brother, Polydectes, succeeded to the crown, but died soon afterwards, leaving his queen with child.  The ambitious woman offered to destroy the child, if Lycurgus would share the throne with her. Lycurgus pretended to consent; but as soon as she had given birth to a son, he presented him in the market-place as the future king of Sparta. The young king's mother took revenge upon Lycurgus by accusing him of entertaining designs against his nephew's life.  Hereupon he resolved to withdraw from his native country and to visit foreign lands.  He was absent many years, and is said to have employed his time in studying the institutions of other nations, in order to devise a system of laws and regulations which might deliver Sparta from the evils under which it had long been suffering.  During his absence "]]]
