He was a great talker, and a never-ceasing boaster of what he had done, and of what he could do and would do.  As he certainly could do many of the things he talked about, it was believed that he could do everything.  Some believed in him, but others did not.  Such a person was, however, sure to have a number of followers and ardent admirers, who quoted him on all occasions,--stuck by him through thick or thin, right or wrong, and looked upon him as one of the finest fellows in existence.  Among the most constant of his followers was Robert Dawson--Bobby Dawson he was always called.  He was not a badly inclined little fellow, but he had no confidence in himself, and, consequently, wanted to lean on somebody else.  Unfortunately he chose Blackall as his supporter.  Among the smaller boys who aspired to be considered something above the common was Tommy Bouldon.  He was a determined, independent little fellow.  He was very active, and could perform more feats of activity than any other boy of his size.  He was a fair cricketer, and was sometimes chosen by some of the bigger fellows to play in their matches. This made Tommy rather cocky at times; but he was a good-natured chap, and managed to live on good terms with everybody.  Tommy, like Blackall, was rather apt to boast of what he had done, or he purposed doing; but in one respect he was different;--he never exaggerated in his descriptions of his past exploits, and seldom failed to perform whatever he undertook to do.  The boys I have described were among the many who were exercising away with all their might and main on the gymnastic poles.  Blackall was going up a ladder hand over hand, without using his feet, while Lemon was swarming up a pole.  When they reached the top, giddy as was the height, they crossed each other and descended, one by the pole and the other by the rope, head foremost; then, without stopping, each climbed on some horizontal bars.  Lemon first hung by his hands to the bar he had seized, and then he drew himself up until his chest touched the bar; then, lowering himself, he passed one of his feet through his hands, and hitched his knee over the bar; then he swung backwards, and came up sitting on the bar with one leg; it was easy enough to draw the other leg after him.  Throwing himself off, he caught the bar again by his hands, and curled his body over it.  \"That's all very fine,\" exclaimed Blackall, who had been sitting on a bar observing him; \"but, old fellow, can you do this?\"  Blackall, as he spoke, threw himself off the bar, grasping it with both hands; then he passed the left knee through the right arm, so as to let the knee rest in the elbow; then he passed the right knee over the instep of the left foot, and letting go his left hand, he grasped his right foot with it.  Thus he hung, suspended by his right hand, and coiled up like a ball.  After hanging thus for a couple of minutes, he caught the bar by his other hand, and, uncoiling himself, brought his feet between his arms and allowed them to drop till they nearly touched the ground.  Then he turned back the same way.  Once more lifting himself up, he threw his legs over the bar, and dropping straight down, hung by his bent knees, with his head towards the ground.  A little fellow passing at the moment, he called him, and lifted him off the ground; a feat which called forth the loud applause of all his admirers. This excited him to further efforts, and he was induced to continue still longer when he found that Lemon did not seem inclined to vie with him.  While the exercises I have described were going forward, the Doctor made his appearance at the door of the yard, accompanied by a boy who looked curiously round at what was taking place.  After waiting a minute or so, the Doctor led him on through the grounds.  \"I wonder who that chap is!\" observed Tommy Bouldon.  \"He looks a regular-built sawney.\"  \"Oh, don't you know?  He's the new fellow,\" answered Bobby Dawson.  \"I heard something about him from Sandon, who lives in the same county, ten or a dozen miles from his father's house.  The families visit,--that is to say, the elders go and stay at each other's houses,--but Sandon has never met this fellow himself, so he could only tell me what he had heard.  One thing he knows for certain, that he has never been at school before, so he must be a regular muff, don't you see.  His father is a sort of philosopher--brings up his children unlike anybody else; makes them learn all about insects and flowers, and birds and beasts, and astronomy, and teaches them to do all sorts of things besides, but nothing that is of any use in the world that I know of.  Now I'll wager young Hopeful has never played football or cricket in his life, and couldn't if he was to try.  Those sort of fellows, in my opinion, are only fit to keep tame rabbits and silkworms.\"  Master Bobby did not exactly define to what sort of character he alluded; and it is possible he might have been mistaken as to his opinion of the new boy.  \"Well, I agree with you,\" observed Tommy Bouldon, drawing himself up to his full height of three feet seven inches, and looking very consequential.  \"I hate those home-bred, missy, milk-and-water chaps. It is a pity they should ever come to school at all.  They are more fit to be turned into nursery-maids, and to look after their little brothers and sisters.\"  This sally of wit drew forth a shout of laughter from Bobby Dawson, who forthwith settled in his mind that he would precious soon take the shine out of the new boy.  \"But, I say, what is the fellow's name?\" asked Tommy.  \"Oh, didn't I tell you?\" answered Bobby.  \"It's Bracebridge; his Christian name is--let me see, I heard it, I know it's one of your fancy romantic mamma's pet-boy names--just what young ladies put in little children's story-books.  Oh, I have it now--Ernest--Ernest Bracebridge.\"  \"I don't see that that is so very much out of the way either,\" observed Bouldon; \"I've known two or three Ernests who were not bad sorts of fellows.  There was Ernest Hyde, who was a capital cricketer, and Ernest Eastgate, who was one of the best runners I ever met; still from what you tell me, I fully expect that this Ernest Bracebridge will turn out no great shakes.\"  While the lads were speaking, the subject of their remarks returned to the playground.  An unprejudiced person would certainly not have designated him as a muff.  He was an active, well-built boy, of between twelve and thirteen years old.  He had light-brown hair, curling slightly, with a fair complexion and a good colour.  His mouth showed a good deal of firmness, and he had clear honest eyes, with no little amount of humour in them.  He was dressed in a dark-blue jacket, white trousers, and a cloth cap.  Dawson and Bouldon eyed him narrowly.  What they thought of him, after a nearer scrutiny, they did not say.  He stood at a little distance from the gymnasium, watching with very evident interest the exercises of the boys.  He had, it seemed, when he first came in with the Doctor, been attracted with what he had seen, and had come back again as soon as he was at liberty.  He drew nearer and nearer as he gained more and more confidence, till he got close up to where Dawson and Bouldon were swinging lazily on some cross-bars. Blackall was at that moment playing off some of his most difficult feats, such as I have already described.  \"I say, young fellow, can you do anything like that?\" said Tommy, addressing Ernest, and pointing at Blackall.  \"Dawson here swears there isn't another fellow in England who can come up to him.\"  \"I beg your pardon, did you speak to me?\" asked Ernest, looking at Tommy as if he considered the question had not been put in the most civil way.  \"Yes, of course, young one, I did.  There's no one behind you, is there?\" answered Tommy.  \"What's more, too, I expect an answer.\"  \"Perhaps I might, with a little practice,\" answered the new boy carelessly.  \"I'm rather fond of athletic exercises.\"  \"I'll be content to see you get up that pole, young 'un,\" observed Tommy, putting his tongue in his cheek.  \"Take care you don't burn your fingers as you come down.\"  \"I'll try, if I may,\" replied the new boy quietly.  He advanced towards the pole, but another boy got hold of it--rather a bungler he seemed; so Ernest left him to puff and blow by himself in his vain efforts at getting up, and went on to one of the swinging ropes. He seized it well above his head, and pressing his knees and feet against it, steadily drew himself up, to the surprise of Bouldon and Dawson and several other lookers-on, till he reached the lofty cross-bar.  Was he coming down again?  No.  He sprang up and ran along the beam with fearless steps till he came to the part into which the top of the pole was fixed.  Most of the boys thought that he would come down by the ladder; but, stooping down, he swung himself on to the pole and slid down head first to the ground.  There he stood, looking as cool and unconcerned as if he had not moved from the spot.  The feat he had performed, though not difficult, was one which neither Dawson nor Bouldon had yet attempted.  It raised him wonderfully in the opinion of those young gentlemen.  \"Very well, young one,\" exclaimed Tommy in a patronising tone.  \"I did not think you'd have done it half as well.  However, I suppose it's _the_ trick you have practised.  You couldn't do, now, what that big fellow there, Blackall, is about?\"  \"Oh, yes,\" said Ernest quietly.  \"I can kick the bar, or swing on it, or circle it, or do the grasshopper, or hang by my legs, or make a true lover's knot, or pass through my arms, or hang by my feet.  You fancy that I am boasting, but the fact is this, my father won't let us do anything imperfectly.  If we do it at all, he says, we must do it well.\"  \"Oh, I dare say that's all right, young one,\" observed Tommy, turning away with Dawson.  \"I see how it is.  He has been coached well up in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21452"],["title","Ernest Bracebridge: School Days (#2)"],["body",", but when he comes to play cricket or football it will be a very different affair.  A fellow may learn one thing or so at home very well, but he soon breaks down when he comes to practice work.\"  A few only of the boys had remarked Ernest's performances.  Most of them were too much engaged in their own exercises to think of him.  He felt rather solitary when left to himself, and wished that Dawson and Bouldon would have stopped to talk to him, not that he particularly admired their manners.  He was well prepared, however, to meet all sorts of characters.  School and its inner life had been described to him by his father with faithful accuracy.  Although at the time few, if any, private schools were to be found superior to Grafton Hall, Ernest did not expect to find it as happy a place as his own home, much less a paradise.  A number of little boys were playing a game of ring-taw in a corner of the yard.  Ernest walked up to them.  No one took any notice of him, but went on with their game. \"Knuckle down,\" was the cry.  A sturdy little fellow, with a well-bronzed hand, was peppering away, knocking marble after marble out of the ring with his taw, and bid fair to win all that remained.  Ernest had long ago given up marbles himself, but he did not pretend to forget how to play with them.  He thought that if he offered to join them it might serve as an introduction.  \"If you will let me, I shall like to play with you,\" he said quietly, catching the eye of the sturdy player.  \"With all my heart,\" was the answer.  \"Thank you.  But I must buy a taw and some marbles,\" said Ernest.  \"I did not think of bringing any.\"  \"Oh, I will lend you some,\" answered the boy.  \"Here, this taw is a prime one; it will win you half the marbles in the ring if you play well.\"  Ernest thanked his new friend, and took the taw and a dozen marbles with a smile.  He was amused at finding himself about to play marbles with some boys most of whom were so much younger than himself.  His new friend had cleared the ring, and a fresh game was about to begin.  He put down eight of his marbles, and, as there were several players, a large number were collected.  The first player had shot out four or five marbles, when his taw remaining in the ring, he had to put them all back and go out.  Ernest was kneeling down to take his turn, when Blackall, tired of his gymnastic exercises, came sauntering by.  \"What are you about there, you fellows?  I'll join you,\" he exclaimed. \"How many down?  Eight.  Oh, very well.\"  Without more ado he was stooping down to shooting from the offing, when Ernest observed that he had taken his turn.  \"Who are you, I should like to know, you little upstart?\" cried Blackall, eyeing the new-comer with great disdain.  \"Get out of my way, or I will kick you over.\"  \"Indeed I shall not,\" exclaimed Ernest, who had never been spoken to in that style before, but whose whole spirit rose instantly in rebellion against anything like tyranny or injustice.  Without speaking further, he stooped down and shot his taw with considerable effect along the edges of the ring of marbles.  It knocked out several, and stopped a little way outside.  \"Didn't you hear me?\" exclaimed Blackall furiously.  \"Get out of my way, I say.\"  Ernest did not move, but took his taw and again fired, with the same effect as before.  Blackall's fury was now at its highest pitch.  He rushed at Ernest, and lifting him with his foot sent him spinning along the ground.  Ernest was not hurt, so he got up and said, \"I wonder you can treat a stranger so.  However, the time will come when you will not dare to do it.\"  \"Shame! shame!\" shouted several of the little fellows, snatching up their marbles and running away, for they were accustomed to be treated in that way by Blackall.  Ernest was left with his first acquaintance standing by his side, while the bully walked on, observing--  \"Very well; you'll catch it another time, let me promise you.\"  \"That's right!\" exclaimed Ernest's companion.  \"I'm glad you treated him so.  It's the only way.  If I was bigger I would, but he thrashes me so unmercifully whenever I stick up against him that I've got rather sick of opposing him.\"  \"Help me,\" said Ernest, \"and we'll see what can be done.\"  The other boy put out his hand, and pressing that of the new-comer, said, \"I will.\"  The compact was then and there sealed, not to be broken; and the boys felt that they understood each other.  \"What is your name?\" said Ernest.  \"It is curious that I should not know it, and yet I feel as if I was a friend of yours.\"  \"My name is John Buttar,\" answered the boy.  \"I have heard yours.  You are to be in our room, for the matron told me a new boy was coming to-day, though I little thought what sort of a fellow he was to be.  But come along, I'll show you round the bounds.  We may not go outside for the next three weeks, for some of the big fellows got into a row, and we have been kept in ever since.\"  So Johnny Butter, as he was called, ran on.  He let Ernest into the politics of the school, and gave him a great deal of valuable information.  Ernest listened attentively, and asked several questions on important points, all of which Buttar answered in a satisfactory way.  \"This is a very jolly place altogether, you see,\" he remarked; \"what is wrong is generally owing to our own faults, or rather to that of the big fellows.  For instance, the Doctor knows nothing of the bullying which goes forward; if he knew what sort of a fellow Blackall is he would very soon send him to the right-about, I suspect.  We might tell of him, of course, but that would never do, so he goes on and gets worse and worse. The only way is to set up against him as you did to-day.  If everybody did that we should soon put him down.\"  Ernest was very much interested in all he saw.  Notwithstanding the example he had just had, he thought that it might be a very good sort of place.  Buttar introduced him to several boys, who, he said, were very nice fellows; so that before many hours had passed Ernest found himself with a considerable number of acquaintances, and even Dawson and Bouldon condescended to speak rationally to him.  A number of boys having collected, a game of Prisoners' Base was proposed.  Ernest did not know the rules of the game, but he quickly learnt them, and soon got as much excited as any one.  His new friend John Buttar was captain on one side, while Tommy Bouldon was leader of the opposite party.  Each chose ten followers.  A hedge formed their base, two plots being marked out close to it, one of which was occupied by each party.  Two circles were formed, about a hundred yards off, for prisons.  \"Chevy, chevy, chevy!\" shouted Buttar, rushing out.  Bouldon gave chase after him.  They were looked upon as cocks of their set, and the chase was exciting.  Bouldon was very nearly catching Buttar, when Ernest darted out to his rescue.  Now, Tommy, you must put your best leg foremost or you will be caught to a certainty.  What twisting and turning, what dodging there was.  Now Bouldon had almost caught up Buttar, but the latter, stooping down, was off again under his very hands, and turning suddenly, was off once more behind his back.  \"'Ware the new boy; 'ware young Bracebridge,\" was the shout from Bouldon's side.  Tommy was in hot chase after Buttar, and there seemed every probability of his catching him.  On hearing the cry, he looked over his shoulder and saw Ernest close to him.  He had now to think of his own safety. From what he had observed of the new boy, he saw, that though he was a new boy, and had never been at school before, he was not to be despised. He had therefore to imitate Buttar's tactics, and to dodge away from his pursuer.  Ernest had evidently been accustomed chiefly to run straight forward; he was very fleet of foot, but had not practised the art of twisting and turning.  Another boy of Bouldon's side now ran out in pursuit of Ernest, who, having executed his purpose of rescuing Buttar, returned in triumph to his base, while one of his side ran out, and, touching the boy who had gone out against him, carried him off to the prison.  Several others were taken; Bouldon at length was caught, so was Buttar, but he was quickly rescued by Ernest, whose side was at length victorious, having committed every one of the others to prison.  Ernest, who had contributed very largely to this success, pronounced it a capital game.  He gained also a good deal of credit by the way he had played it, especially when it was known that it was for the first time, and that he had never been at school before.  The way in which his companions treated him put him in very good spirits, and he became sufficiently satisfied with himself and with everything around him.  He felt that he could do a number of things, but he was diffident from not knowing of what value they might be considered by other boys.  He had heard that some savages despised the purest pearls, while they set a high value on bits of glittering glass, and so he thought that some of his accomplishments might be very little thought of by other boys. However, by the time the tea-bell rang, he had fully established himself in the good opinions of most of the younger boys; even two or three of the elder ones pronounced him to be a plucky little chap.  The evening was spent in a fine large hall which had been fitted up for playing.  Before each breaking-up a platform was raised at one end, and speeches were delivered from it, and more than once it had been fitted up as a theatre, and the boys had got up, with some effect, some well-selected plays.  There were some tables and desks at one end, and rows of shelves on which were placed boxes and baskets, and cages with birds and tame mice, and indeed all sorts of small pets.  A few of the quieter boys went in that direction, but the greater number began to play a variety of noisy games.  \"I say, who's for a game of high-cock-o'lorum?\" exclaimed Bouldon.  \"I, I, I,\""]]]
