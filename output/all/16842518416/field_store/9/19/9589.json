Our heroes, fancying the looks neither of the matron's hall nor of the lobby upstairs, deemed it prudent to retreat as quickly as possible to the junior schoolroom, there to await, in the calm atmosphere of expectant scholarship, the ringing of the twelve o'clock bell.  Has the reader ever visited that famous resort of youth, the Zoo?  Has he stood on that terrace five minutes before dinner-time and listened to the deep-mouthed growl of the lion, the barking of the wolf, the shriek of the hyaena, as they pace their cages and await their meal?  Then, turning on his heel, has he quitted that stately scene and pushed back the door of the monkey house?  Even so it was with our heroes.  The junior schoolroom was as the matron's hall and the studies thrown into one.--At first, to the untutored eyes of the visitors, it looked like a surging sea of unkempt heads and waving elbows; then, as their vision grew accustomed to the scene, they beheld faces and legs and boots; then, amid the general din, they distinguished voices, and perceived that the sea was made up of human beings.  At the which they would fain have retreated; but, as old Virgil says-- and we won't insult our readers by translating the verses--    \"Facilis descensus Averni, Sed revocare gradum Hoc opus, hic labor   est.\"  Their retreat was cut off before they were well in the room, and, amid loud cries of \"New kids!\"  \"Bertie!\"  \"Scrunch!\" they were escorted to the nearest form, where they forthwith received a most warm and pressing welcome into their new quarters.  The top boy of the form, in his emotion, planted his feet against the wall and began to push inwards. The bottom boy, equally overcome, planted his feet in the hollow of a desk and also pushed inwards.  Every one else, in fellow-feeling, pushed inwards too, except our heroes, who, being in the exact centre, remained passive recipients of their schoolfellows' welcome until the line showed signs of rising up at the point where Aspinall's white face pointed the middle; whereupon the bottom boy considerately let go with his feet, and the occupants of the form were poured like water on the floor.  After being thus welcomed on some half-dozen forms, our heroes began to feel that even good fellowship may pall, and were glad, decidedly glad, to hear the great bell beginning to sound forth.  School that morning was rather a farce; the master was not in the humour for it, nor were the boys.  After calling over names and announcing the subjects which would engage the attention of the different classes, and reading over, in case any one had forgotten them, the rules of Westover's house, the class was dismissed for the present, all except the new boys being permitted to go out into the court or playing-fields till dinner.  It was a welcome relief to our new boys to find themselves together once more with the enemy beyond reach.  Their ranks showed signs of severe conflict.  One boy, who had rashly worn a light blue necktie in the morning, wore no necktie now; Heathcote's jacket was burst under the arm; Dick bore no scars in his raiment, but his nose was rather on one side and his face was rather grimy; Aspinall was white and hot, and the \"skeery\" look about his eyes proclaimed he had had almost enough for one day.  After dinner, at which our heroes rejoiced to find \"the Assyrians\" had something more serious to do than to heed them, Templeton went out into the fields to air itself.  There was nothing special doing.  A few enthusiastic athletes had donned their flannels, and were taking practice trots round the half-mile path.  Another lot were kicking about a football in an aimless way.  Others were passing round a cricket ball at long range.  But most were loafing, apparently undecided what to turn themselves to thus early in the term.  One or two of the Fifth, however, appeared to have some business on hand, in which, much to their surprise, our new boys found they were concerned.  The senior whose arrival they had witnessed in the morning came up to where they were, and said:  \"You're all three new boys, aren't you?\"  \"Yes,\" they replied.  \"Well, go up to the flag-staff there, and wait for me.\"  With much inward trepidation they obeyed, wondering what was to happen.  Swinstead, for that was the name of the Fifth-form fellow, continued his tour of the field, accosting all the new boys in turn, and giving them the same order.  At length, the long-suffering twenty clustered round the flag-staff, and awaited their fate.  It was simple enough.  Every new boy was expected to race on his first day at Templeton, and that was what was expected of them now.  \"Let's have your names--look sharp,\" said one Fifth-form fellow, with a pencil and paper in his hand, who seemed to look upon the affair as rather a bore.  \"Come on.  Sing out one at a time.\"  They did sing out one at a time.  \"Twenty of them,\" said the senior, running down his list.  \"Four fives, I suppose?\"  \"Yes,\" said Swinstead.  \"Clear the course, somebody, and call the fellows.\"  So the course was cleared, and proclamation made that the new boys were about to race.  Whereat Templeton lined the quarter-mile track; and showed a languid interest in the contest.  Swinstead called over the first five names on his list.  \"Take off your coats and waistcoats,\" said he.  They obeyed.  Dick, who was not in the first heat, took charge of Heathcote's garments, and secretly bade him \"put it on.\"  \"Toe the line,\" said Swinstead.  \"Are you ready?  Off!\"  They started.  It was a straggling procession.  Two of the boys could scarcely use their legs, and of the other three Heathcote was the only one who showed any pace, and, greatly to Dick's delight, came in easily first.  Dick's turn came in the second round, and he, greatly to Heathcote's delight, won in a canter.  In the fourth heat Aspinall ran; but he, poor fellow, could scarcely struggle on to the end, and had literally to be driven the last fifty yards.  For no new boy was allowed to shirk his race.  Templeton evinced a more decided interest in the final round.  It had looked on as a matter of duty on the trial heats; but it got a trifle excited over the final.  The winner of the fourth round, the youth who had been robbed of his light blue tie, commanded the most general favour.  Swinstead on the other hand secretly fancied Dick, and one or two others were divided between Heathcote and the winner of the third round.  \"Keep your elbows in, and don't look round so much,\" whispered Swinstead to Dick, as the four champions toed the line.  Dick nodded gratefully for the advice.  \"Now then.  Are you ready?  \"Go!\" cried the starter.  The hero of the blue tie led off amid great jubilation among the sportsmen.  But Swinstead, who trotted beside the race, still preferred Dick, and liked the way he kept up to the leader's heels in the first hundred yards.  Heathcote, in his turn, kept well up to Dick, and had nothing to fear from the other man.  \"Pretty race,\" said some one.  \"Good action number two,\" replied another.  \"Swinstead fancies him, and he knows what's what.\"  \"I should have said number three, myself.\"  Two hundred yards were done, and scarcely an inch had the position of the three runners altered.  Then Swinstead called.  \"Now then, young 'un.\"  Dick knew the call was meant for him, and his spirit rose within him. He \"waited on his man,\" as they say, and before the next hundred yards were done he was abreast, with Heathcote close on the heels of both.  Frantic were the cries of the sportsmen to their man.  But his face was red, and his mouth was open.  \"He's done!\" was the cry of the disgusted knowing ones.  And the knowing ones were right.  Dick walked away, as fresh as a daisy, in the last hundred yards, while Heathcote blowing hard stepped up abreast of the favourite.  It was a close run for second honours; but the Mountjoy boy stuck to it, and staggered up a neck in front, with ten clear yards between him and the heels of the victorious Dick.    CHAPTER FIVE.  HOW HEATHCOTE NEARLY CATCHES COLD.  Dick felt decidedly pleased with himself, as he walked back arm-in-arm with Heathcote, after his victory.  He felt that he had a right to hold up his head in Templeton already, and although he still experienced some difficulty in managing his hands and keeping down his blushes when he met one of the Fifth, he felt decidedly fortified against the inquisitive glances of the juniors.  In fact, in the benevolence of his heart, he felt so anxious lest any of these young aspirants to a view of the hero who had won the new boys' race should be disappointed, that he prolonged his walk, and made a circuit of the great square with his friend, so as to give every one a fair chance.  At tea, to which Templeton trooped in ravenously after their first afternoon's blow in the open air, he sat with an interesting expression of langour on his face, enduring the scrutiny to which he was treated with an air of charming unconsciousness, from which any one might suppose he harboured not the slightest desire to hear what Swinstead was saying to his neighbour, as they both looked his way.  It was a pity he could not hear it.  \"Look at that young prig,\" said Swinstead's neighbour.  \"He can't get over it.  It's gone to his head.\"  \"Young ass!\" said Swinstead; \"ran well too.\"  \"It would be a good turn to take him down a peg.\"  \"What's the use?  He'll come down soon enough.\"  For all that, the two friends could not resist the temptation, when, after tea, they caught sight of Dick and his chum going out into the Quad, of beckoning to the former to come to them.  \"Those fellows want me,\" said Dick to his friend, in a tone as much as to say, \"I'm so used to holding familiar converse with the Fifth that it's really almost beginning to be a grind.  But I don't like to disappoint them this time.\"  \"Well, how do you feel?\" said Swinstead.  \"Oh, all right,\" replied Dick,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20991"],["title","Follow My Leader: The Boys of Templeton (#8)"],["body","unmistakeable signs of intoxication.  \"Capital run you made,\" said the other.  \"Middling,\" said Dick, deprecatingly.  \"I hadn't my shoes, that makes a difference.\"  \"It does,\" said the two elders.  \"Rather a nice turf track you've got,\" said the boy presently, by way of filling up an awkward gap.  \"Glad you like it.  Some of the fellows growl at it; but we'll tell them you think it good.\"  It was rather an anxious moment to see how the fish would take it.  But he swallowed it, hook and all.  \"We used to run a good deal at our old school, you know,\" said he. \"Some of us, that is.\"  \"Ah, you're just the man we want for the Harriers.  They're badly off for a whipper-in; and we had to stop hunting all last term because we hadn't got one.\"  \"Oh!\" said Dick.  \"Yes.  But it'll be all right if you'll take it--won't it be, Birket?\"  \"Rather!\" said Birket.  \"He'd be a brick if he did.\"  \"I don't mind trying,\" said Dick modestly.  \"Will you really?  Thanks, awfully!  You know Cresswell?  No, by the way, he's not here yet.  He's in the Sixth, and has been acting as whipper-in till we got a proper chap.  He'll be here in the morning. Any one will tell you where he hangs out.  He'll bless you, I can tell you, for taking the job out of his hands.  You never saw the pace he goes at when he tries to run, eh, Birket?\"  \"Rather not,\" said Birket.  \"It's a regular joke.  A snail's nothing to him.\"  \"How has he managed to whip in?\" asked Dick, rather amused at the idea of this Sixth-form snail.  \"Bless you, we've had no runs lately, that's why.  But we shall make up now you've come.\"  Dick heartily wished he _had_ run in his shoes that afternoon.  He was sure he could have done the distance two or even three seconds better if he had.  \"If you'll really go in for it,\" said Birket, \"go to him early to- morrow, and tell him who you are; and say you are going to act as whipper-in, and that you have arranged it all with us.\"  Dick looked a little concerned.  \"Hadn't you better come with me?\" he asked, \"I don't know him.\"  \"We shall be in class.  But he'll know if you mention our names.  Say we sent you, and that you won the new boys' race.  Do you twig?\"  \"All right,\" said Dick, beginning to feel he had something really big on hand.  \"You're a young trump,\" said Birket, \"and, I say don't forget to ask him to give you the whip.  We might manage a run to-morrow.  Good-night. Glad you've come to Templeton.\"  \"Look here, by the way,\" said Swinstead, as they parted, \"don't say anything about it to anybody.  There's such a lot of jealousy over these things.  Best to get it all settled first.  Don't you think so?\"  \"Yes,\" said Dick, feeling a good deal bewildered, and doubtful whether after all he had not been foolish in undertaking so important a task.  He returned to his chum in an abstracted frame of mind.  He had certainly expected his achievement that afternoon would give him a \"footing\" in Templeton, but in his wildest dreams he had not supposed it would give him such a lift as this.  Whipper-in of the Templeton Harriers was rapid promotion for a new boy on his first day.  But then, he reflected, if they really were hard up for a fellow to take the office, it would be rather ungracious to refuse it.  \"What did they want you for?\" asked Heathcote.  \"Oh, talking about the race, don't you know, and that sort of thing,\" said Dick, equivocally.  \"Did they say anything about me?\"  \"Not a word, old man.\"  Whereat Heathcote turned a little crusty, and wondered that ten yards in a quarter of a mile should make such a difference.  Dick was bursting to tell him all about it, and made matters far worse by betraying that he had a secret, which he could on no account impart.  \"You'll know to-morrow, most likely,\" said he.  \"I'm awfully sorry they made me promise to keep it close.  But I'll tell you first of all when its settled; and I may be able to give you a leg up before long.\"  Heathcote said he did not want a leg up; and feeling decidedly out of humour, made some excuse to go indoors and hunt up young Aspinall.  On his way he encountered a junior, next to whom he had sat at dinner, and with whom he had then exchanged a few words.  \"Where are you going?\" demanded that youthful warrior.  \"Indoors,\" said Heathcote.  \"No, you aren't,\" replied the bravo, standing like a wolf across the way.  It was an awkward position for a pacific boy like Heathcote, who mildly enquired--  \"Why not?\"  \"Because you cheeked me,\" replied the wolf.  \"How?  I didn't mean to,\" replied the lamb.  \"That'll do.  You've got to apologise.\"  \"Apologise!  What for?\"  \"Speaking to me at dinner-time.\"  The blood of the Heathcotes began to tingle.  \"Suppose I don't apologise?\" asked he.  \"You'll be sorry for it.\"  \"What will you do?\"  \"Lick you.\"  \"Then,\" said Heathcote, mildly, \"you'd better begin.\"  The youthful champion evidently was not prepared for this cordial invitation, and looked anything but pleased to hear it.  \"Well, why don't you begin?\" said Heathcote, following up his advantage.  \"Because,\" said the boy, looking rather uncomfortably around him, \"I wouldn't dirty my fingers on such a beast.\"  Now if Heathcote had been a man of the world he would have divined that the present was a rare opportunity for catching his bumptious young friend by the ear, and making him carry out his threat then and there. But, being a simple-minded new boy, unlearned in the ways of the world, he merely said \"Pooh!\" and walked on, leaving his assailant in possession of the field, calling out \"coward!\" and \"sneak!\" after him till he was out of sight.  He was rather sorry afterwards for his mistake, as it turned out he might have been much more profitably and pleasantly employed outside than in.  Aspinall, whom he had come to look after, was nowhere visible, and, feeling somewhat concerned for his safety, Heathcote ventured to enquire of a junior who was loafing about in the passage, if he knew where the little new fellow was.  \"In bed, of course,\" said the junior, \"and I'd advise you not to let yourself be seen, unless you want to get in an awful row,\" added he solemnly.  \"What about?\" asked Heathcote.  \"Why, not being in bed.  My eye! it'll be rather warm for you, I tell you, if any of the Fifth catch you.\"  \"Why, it's only half-past seven?\"  \"Well, and don't you know the rule about new boys always having to be in bed by seven?\" exclaimed the junior in tones of alarm.  \"No.  I don't believe it is the rule,\" said Heathcote.  \"All right,\" said the boy, \"you needn't believe it unless you like.  But don't say you weren't told, that's all,\" and he walked off, whistling.  Heathcote was perplexed.  He suspected a practical joke in everything, and had this junior been a trifle less solemn, he would have had no doubt that this was one.  As it was, he was sorry he had offended him, and lost the chance of making quite sure.  Dick, he knew, was still out of doors, and he, it was certain, knew nothing about the rule.  But just then a Fifth-form fellow came along, and cut off the retreat.  He eyed the new boy critically as he advanced, and stopped in front of him.  \"What's your name?\" he demanded.  \"Heathcote.\"  \"A new boy?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"How is it you're not in bed?  Do you know the time?\"  \"Yes,\" said Heathcote, convinced now that the junior had been right, \"but I didn't know--that is--\"  \"Shut up and don't tell lies,\" said the Fifth-form boy, severely.  \"Go to bed instantly, and write me out 200 lines of Virgil before breakfast to-morrow.  I've a good mind to send your name up to Westover.\"  \"I'm awfully sorry,\" began Heathcote; \"no one told me--\"  \"I've told you; and if you don't go at once Westover shall hear of it.\"  The dormitory, when he reached it, was deserted.  Not even Aspinall was there; and for a moment Heathcote began again vaguely to suspect a plot. From this delusion, he was, however, speedily relieved by the appearance of a boy, who followed him into the room, and demanded.  \"Look here; what are you up to here?\"  \"I was--that is, I was told to go to bed,\" said Heathcote.  \"Well, and if you were, what business have you got here?  Go to your own den.\"  \"This is where I slept last night,\" said Heathcote, pointing to the identical bed he had occupied.  \"You did!  Like your howling cheek.\"  \"Where is my bed room then?\" asked Heathcote.  \"Why didn't you ask the matron?  I'm not going to fag for you.  There, in that second door; and take my advice, slip into bed as quick as you can, unless you want one of the Fifth to catch you, and give you a hundred lines.\"  Heathcote whipped up his night-gown and made precipitately for the door, finally convinced that he was in a fair way of getting into a row very early in his Templeton career.  The door opened into a little room about the size of a small ship's cabin, and here he undressed as quickly as he could, in the fading daylight, and slipped into bed, inwardly congratulating himself that no one had detected him in the act, and that he had a good prospect, contrary to his expectations, of getting to sleep comfortably.  The thought of the 200 lines, certainly, was unpleasant.  But \"sufficient unto the day,\" thought the philosophic Heathcote.  He was far more concerned at the fate of the unsuspecting Dick.  What would become of him, poor fellow?  Amid these reflections he fell peacefully asleep.  The next thing he was conscious of, in what seemed to him the middle of the night, was the sudden removal of the clothes from the bed, and a figure holding a light, catching him by the arm, and demanding fiercely--  \"What do you mean by it?\"  His first impulse was to smile at the thought that it was only a dream, but he quickly changed his mind, and sat up with his eyes very wide open as the figure repeated--  \"What do you mean by it?  Get out of this!\"  The speaker was a big boy, whom Heathcote, in the midst of his bewilderment, recognised as having seen at the Fifth-form table in Hall.  \"What's the matter?\" faltered the new boy.  \"The matter! you impudent "]]]
