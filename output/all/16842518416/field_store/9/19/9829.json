If he brought one to bear upon an object, that eye dragged its fellow round so that the pupil dived under the man's thick nose; and if he made an effort to see with the eclipsed one, it served its fellow in the same way.  \"You must have heard too, Ram Jennings.\"  \"Yoss, I heared,\" said the other man, a dark, rather villainous-looking fellow, whose face could not be called troubled with yellow specks, but streaked here and there with a little whitish red, the rest being one enormous freckle, which covered brow, cheeks, and chin.  \"Then why didn't you answer?\"  \"Both on us stopped,\" said the first man addressed.  \"Ay, that's so,\" said the other.  \"Why didn't you come back, then?\"  \"'Cause we see you running.  Didn't we, mate?\"  \"Ay, that's so.\"  \"It's your duty to come to me when your called,\" said Ralph hotly.  \"The man to the master, not the master to the man.\"  \"Allus do,\" said Nick, looking insolently at the lad first with one eye, and then with the other.  \"Don't be impertinent, sir.  Now then, where are you two going?\"  \"Over yonder,\" said the first man surlily.  \"Ay, over yonder,\" said the other.  \"What for?\"  \"Fads.\"  \"What?\"  \"Fads.  Young missus wants some o' they softy stones cut to build up in the yard, round a bit o' drain pipe, to make a puddle to keep fishes in.\"  \"Oh!\" said the lad, cooling down.  \"Go and do it then; I'll wait till the afternoon.\"  The men grinned, shouldered their picks, and went off, while the lad took a few paces in another direction; but turned sharply, and called the men again, with the same result--that is, they stood still and waited for him to join them.  \"They're a pair of thick-headed fools, that's what they are,\" muttered the lad.  \"I could teach a dog to be more dutiful.  Here, Nick--Ram--did you see those soldiers who came the other day?\"  \"Nay, only one o' their cloak things as they left behind.\"  \"Left a cloak behind?\"  \"Ay,\" said the second man.  \"I fun' it.\"  \"What did you do with it?\"  \"Burnt it.  Warn't good for nothing else.\"  \"Do you know where they went?\"  \"Summun said they went to Black Tor, and old Eden set 'em to work in the mine, and keeps 'em there,\" said Nick, moving his head from side to side, so as to bring his eyes alternately to bear upon his young master.  \"Oh!\" said Ralph softly to himself.  Then aloud: \"That will do.\"  The men grinned again, and went off, while Ralph walked slowly away to where he could throw himself down at the side of the cliff in the sunshine, swing his legs over the edge, where it was nice and dangerous if he slipped, and finally leaned back to rest on one elbow, and gaze in the direction of the high cliff beyond the depression, where the men were gone to chip out pieces of the soft spongy-looking tufa, which lay in beds on the slope.  \"That's bad news,\" thought the lad.  \"I wonder what father will say.  It will be horrible.  They will be so strong there, that one doesn't know what will happen, only that we shall have to fight.  Well, then,\" he cried hotly, \"we'll fight.  Let them come.  The Darleys have never been beaten yet.\"  For the next half-hour, he lay thinking about swords, and pikes, and armour, and big stones to cast down off the towers upon assailants, and then his attention was taken by one of the great black ravens, flapping its way along over the dale, and he watched it till it seemed to him to slide down toward the cliff, a quarter of a mile away.  By-and-by he saw another great bird, and thought it the same, but directly after, the first one reappeared, and he saw the pair cross in the air.  \"They've got a nest, and it must be on the High Cliff.  Wonder whether I could hit one of the great thieves with a crossbow-bolt.  Be practice,\" he thought; \"I may have to shoot at two-legged thieves.\"  Then the absurdity of his words came to him, and he laughed aloud.  \"Well, ravens have only two legs.  Rather horrible, though, to shoot at a man.  Well, I don't want to, but if they come and attack us, I'll shoot, that I will.  What are those great birds flying to and fro for? and, yes, now they're going round and round.  I know: a young lamb must have gone over the cliff, and be bleating on one of the ledges because it cannot get up.  Poor little wretch!  They'll pick its eyes out.  I'll go and see.  Better get a crossbow first.  Might get a shot at one of the ravens.--Bother! it's such a way to go and fetch it; and if I did, I'll be bound to say it would want a new string, and it would take ever so long to get ready.  Bother! it's hot, and I shan't go.  Perhaps there isn't a lamb there, after all.  Fancy.\"  He rested his head upon his hand, and watched the far-off ravens, becoming more and more convinced that a lamb had gone over.  \"Then why don't they go at it?\" he muttered.  \"Perhaps it's a sheep, and they're afraid to attack.  Must be something there, or they wouldn't keep on flying to and fro like that.  Well; bother!  I don't care. Sheep and lambs ought to know better.\"  He tried to take his thoughts back to the castle and its defensive powers, if the Edens, strengthened by the gang of mercenaries, should attack them, but it was too hard work to think of the imaginary, when the real was before him in the shape of a pair of great black ravens, flying round and round, and showing plainly against the great grey crags, threatening from moment to moment to attack something down below.  \"Here, I must go and see what there is to make them fly about like that,\" said the lad to himself, at last, his curiosity getting the better of his laziness; and, springing up, he began to descend the slope, making a circuit, so as to reach the high cliff, away from the precipice, and ascend where he could do so, unseen by the birds.  But before he was half-way down, he caught sight of the two men coming in his direction rapidly; and as soon as they caught sight of him, they began to gesticulate, beckoning, waving their caps, and generally indicating that he was to hurry to their side.  \"Oh, you idle beauties!\" muttered Ralph.  \"I should like to give you a lesson.  Spoiled by father's indulgence, you do just as you like.  I'm to run to you, am I?  Come here, you lazy dogs!\"  He waved his hand to them in turn, but instead of coming on, they stopped short, and pointed back toward the highest part of the cliff.  \"Come here!\" roared Ralph, though he knew that they were quite out of hearing.  \"You won't come, won't you?  Oh, don't I wish I was behind you with my riding-boots on!  I'd give you such a kicking, or use the spurs. Come here!\" he roared.  \"I want to send one of them for a crossbow. Well, I don't like doing it, my fine fellows, but if you won't move, I must.  One of you will have to go, though, and walk all the farther. That's it.  I'm right,\" he continued to himself, as he saw the men keep on pointing upwards.  \"Why, what's the matter with them?  Dancing about like that, and slapping their legs.  Stop a moment: went up the side gap to chip out stones for Minnie.  Why--yes--no--oh! hang the ravens! they've hit upon a vein of rich lead, and we shall be as rich as the Edens.\"  Ralph set off at a trot down the slope, and this seemed to have an effect upon the two men, who now began to run, with the result that they were bound to meet at the bottom of the hollow between the two eminences.  \"Come on, Master Ralph!\" roared Nick Garth, as they came within hearing.  \"What is it?  Found lead?\"  \"Lead, sir, no, better than that.  There's a raven's nest over the other side yonder.\"  \"Bah!  What of that?\" cried the lad breathlessly.  \"Here, Ram, go back to the castle, and get me a good crossbow and some bolts.\"  \"Going to shoot 'em, master?\" cried Nick excitedly.  \"Well done, you!\"  \"If I can hit them,\" said the lad.  \"What have they found there--a lamb?\"  \"Lamb?\" cried Nick.  \"Hor, hor, hoh!  You are a rum one, sir.  Lamb, eh? I call un a wolf cub.\"  \"Wolf cub?  Oh!\" cried Ralph excitedly; and the disappointment about the lead was forgotten, the crossbow too.  \"Come on, sir, this way.  Right atop, and you'll be able to look down on un just above the big birds' nest.  He was after the young birds.\"  \"Then that accounts for the ravens flying about so.\"  \"Yes, sir, that's it.  We was getting close to the stone quarry, when Ram, he says: `What's them there birds scrawking about like that there for?' he says.\"  \"Summut arter the young uns,\" I says: \"and we went to where we could look, and there was a young wolf cub, getting slowly down.  Let's fetch the young squire,\" I says; \"and we come after you, for I thought you'd like to have the killing on him.\"  \"Yes, of course, Nick; but I have no bow.  I can't reach him with my sword, can I?\"  \"Tchah! you'd want a lot o' pikes tied together, and then you wouldn't do it.  I'll show you.  There's plenty of big bits o' stone up yonder, and you can drop 'em on his head, and send him down into the water.\"  \"Yes,\" cried Ralph breathlessly, as he climbed the steep ascent; \"but I should like to catch him alive, and keep him in a cage.\"  \"Would you, sir?  Well, that wouldn't be amiss.  Sir Morton would like to see him, and you could tease him.  Down in one o' the dungeons would be the place, till you got tired on him, and you could kill him then.\"  \"Yes, but to think of his being on the cliff here!\"  \"Ay, it do seem a game,\" said the man, chuckling, and showing some ugly yellow teeth.  As they reached about half-way up, they caught sight of one of the ravens, shooting high above the top of the cliff, and instead of darting away at their approach, it only made a circle round, and then descended like an arrow.  \"Tackling on him,\" cried Ram Jennings.  \"Ay, and there goes the other,\" cried Nick.  \"Come on, master, or they'll finish him off before you can get there.  Real wild, they birds is, because he's meddling with their booblins.

First edition was first published in 1895.]     THE MAN FROM SNOWY RIVER AND OTHER VERSES  by A. B. Paterson (“The Banjo”)  with preface by Rolf Boldrewood      Preface    It is not so easy to write ballads descriptive of the bushland of Australia as on light consideration would appear.  Reasonably good verse on the subject has been supplied in sufficient quantity. But the maker of folksongs for our newborn nation requires a somewhat rare combination of gifts and experiences. Dowered with the poet's heart, he must yet have passed his 'wander-jaehre' amid the stern solitude of the Austral waste -- must have ridden the race in the back-block township, guided the reckless stock-horse adown the mountain spur, and followed the night-long moving, spectral-seeming herd 'in the droving days'.  Amid such scarce congenial surroundings comes oft that finer sense which renders visible bright gleams of humour, pathos, and romance, which, like undiscovered gold, await the fortunate adventurer. That the author has touched this treasure-trove, not less delicately than distinctly, no true Australian will deny.  In my opinion this collection comprises the best bush ballads written since the death of Lindsay Gordon.  Rolf Boldrewood   A number of these verses are now published for the first time, most of the others were written for and appeared in “The Bulletin”  (Sydney, N.S.W.), and are therefore already widely known to readers in Australasia.  A. B. Paterson       Prelude         I have gathered these stories afar,       In the wind and the rain,      In the land where the cattle camps are,       On the edge of the plain.      On the overland routes of the west,       When the watches were long,      I have fashioned in earnest and jest       These fragments of song.       They are just the rude stories one hears       In sadness and mirth,      The records of wandering years,       And scant is their worth      Though their merits indeed are but slight,       I shall not repine,      If they give you one moment's delight,       Old comrades of mine.

All the tried and noted riders from the stations near and far     Had mustered at the homestead overnight,    For the bushmen love hard riding where the wild bush horses are,     And the stock-horse snuffs the battle with delight.     There was Harrison, who made his pile when Pardon won the cup,     The old man with his hair as white as snow;    But few could ride beside him when his blood was fairly up --     He would go wherever horse and man could go.    And Clancy of the Overflow came down to lend a hand,     No better horseman ever held the reins;    For never horse could throw him while the saddle-girths would stand,     He learnt to ride while droving on the plains.     And one was there, a stripling on a small and weedy beast,     He was something like a racehorse undersized,    With a touch of Timor pony -- three parts thoroughbred at least --     And such as are by mountain horsemen prized.    He was hard and tough and wiry -- just the sort that won't say die --     There was courage in his quick impatient tread;    And he bore the badge of gameness in his bright and fiery eye,     And the proud and lofty carriage of his head.     But still so slight and weedy, one would doubt his power to stay,     And the old man said, 'That horse will never do    For a long and tiring gallop -- lad, you'd better stop away,     Those hills are far too rough for such as you.'    So he waited sad and wistful -- only Clancy stood his friend --     'I think we ought to let him come,' he said;    'I warrant he'll be with us when he's wanted at the end,     For both his horse and he are mountain bred.     'He hails from Snowy River, up by Kosciusko's side,     Where the hills are twice as steep and twice as rough,    Where a horse's hoofs strike firelight from the flint stones every stride,     The man that holds his own is good enough.    And the Snowy River riders on the mountains make their home,     Where the river runs those giant hills between;    I have seen full many horsemen since I first commenced to roam,     But nowhere yet such horsemen have I seen.'     So he went -- they found the horses by the big mimosa clump --     They raced away towards the mountain's brow,    And the old man gave his orders, 'Boys, go at them from the jump,     No use to try for fancy riding now.    And, Clancy, you must wheel them, try and wheel them to the right.     Ride boldly, lad, and never fear the spills,    For never yet was rider that could keep the mob in sight,     If once they gain the shelter of those hills.'     So Clancy rode to wheel them -- he was racing on the wing     Where the best and boldest riders take their place,    And he raced his stock-horse past them, and he made the ranges ring     With the stockwhip, as he met them"]]]
