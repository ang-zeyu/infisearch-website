The creature, instead of continuing its flight, again stopped, and facing the horsemen as they approached struck out with one of its hinder claws, and had not Bracewell suddenly turned his steed, so furiously did it strike that he would have been severely wounded. Turning round however he dealt it so heavy a blow on the head with his riding-whip that it staggered, and Guy firing brought it to the ground. The natives, whom we recognised as our friends of the morning, now came up and claimed the prize.  Bracewell gave them to understand that we must first cut out as many steaks as we required.  When this was done we handed the body over to them.  They appeared highly delighted and especially struck by the moderate quantity we claimed.  We had now to turn back to where we had left Toby in charge of the baggage animal.  I had some secret apprehensions that, if not honest, he might bolt with our traps and be received with open arms as a wealthy man among some of his countrymen.  I was not aware at the time that he belonged to a tribe regarded as hereditary enemies by the people inhabiting the country we were travelling through, and that he was as likely to lose his life at their hands as any white man would be.  We looked about in all directions and at length, to our no small satisfaction, espied him still standing by the horses and wondering what had become of us.  We had lost considerable time by our hunting, though we had obtained a good dinner, and of course had been delayed also by one of the party having to proceed on foot.  While we were seated round our camp-fire Bracewell said--  \"I scarcely like to make the proposal I am about to do, and yet perhaps you will not object.  If you will consent to remain in camp here and allow me to take one of your horses, I will ride forward and bring a couple of fresh ones from my station.  Should you not do this I must insist on walking, though I shall of necessity delay you.  I confess also, that I am anxious to give notice that the bushrangers are abroad, or they may be visiting my hut or some of my neighbours, and carry off arms and ammunition, which is chiefly what they come after, for they don't find much else than food in the shepherds' huts.\"  \"Pray do as you think best,\" said Guy, \"I am sure Maurice will agree with me that we should not at all mind remaining stationary for a few hours, nor will our other horses, which require rest.\"  I thought the plan a good one, and before the day had actually broken, Bracewell mounted my horse and away he rode at a rate which assured us that we should not be long alone.  As Toby had plenty of food, he did not grumble at the delay, but sat himself down contentedly at the fire which he promised to keep alight, while we took our guns and went to shoot some birds or a kangaroo if we could see one.  The great drawback to a traveller in a hot country is the impossibility of preserving fresh meat, which exposed to the sun quickly becomes uneatable.  What we killed one day was therefore unfit for food the next, and we had each morning to shoot some more game, or content ourselves with damper and tea.  We had already become pretty skilful in baking damper, which consists simply of flour and water, kneaded on a board, and baked in the form of a large biscuit under the ashes.  We saw several kangaroos, but they bounded away before we could get near enough to shoot them, and had to content ourselves as before with a couple of parrots and as many pigeons, which was an ample supply, for although the over-high kangaroo meat did not suit our palates, Toby had no objection to it.  We had been shooting for some time, and were making our way back to camp, when we caught sight in the distance of three horsemen, their heads and those of their steeds, occasionally appearing above the brushwood.  They appeared to be coming towards us.  At first we thought that they must be Bracewell and two companions; but as we could make out no led horses, and they were not approaching from the direction he would appear, we concluded that they must be strangers.  \"What if they should be bushrangers?\" said Guy.  \"If they catch Toby alone they are certain to carry off our baggage and horses, and will probably shoot him to prevent him giving information.\"  \"The sooner we get back to camp the better,\" I answered.  We hurried on, keeping ourselves concealed as much as possible.  \"It would be prudent to load our guns with ball,\" said Guy; \"the fellows won't know that we suspect them, and may think that they can stick us up with perfect ease.\"  Fortunately our horses were close to the camp, and as soon as we reached it we sent Toby to bring them in, not telling him that we suspected the character of the strangers.  As they approached we anxiously examined their appearance, which was certainly not in their favour.  They were savage-looking fellows with long beards, their unkempt hair hanging over their shoulders.  They pulled up suddenly when they saw us standing with our backs to a couple of large trees, our baggage and saddles piled on the ground, and Toby holding our horses.  \"What is your pleasure, friends?\" asked Guy.  The fellows examined us without answering.  \"You look as if you'd know us again should we come across you,\" said Guy.  \"Just take my advice.  Ride on and leave us to cook our dinner.\"  \"Who are you, young chaps, and where are you going?\" inquired one of the horsemen, who from his appearance we concluded was the leader of the party.  \"We are going our own way and are not inclined to give that information to those who have no authority to ask it,\" replied Guy in a firm voice.  \"Did you fall in with a young fellow who had been stuck up by bushrangers?\" inquired the man.  The question convinced us that we were not mistaken as to the character of our visitors.  \"I have just told you that we are not going to answer any questions from those who have no right to put them,\" said Guy.  \"Oh, oh, oh!\" cried the man, making a movement as if he was about to unsling his gun.  \"If you do that, I'll fire,\" shouted Guy.  \"Our rifles are loaded with ball; now ride on, we do not wish to take your lives, but we have no intention of being stuck up.\"  During this conversation I was looking at the other two fellows, who had not spoken but seemed to be waiting until their chief gave a sign to them to act.  As my eye ranged over the countenance of one of them, it struck me forcibly that I had seen the man before, but when or where, I could not recollect.  He was evidently very young, for while the faces of the others were covered with hair, he had but a small moustache on his lips, but exposure to the hot sun had so tanned his complexion, that had he been an intimate friend I might have failed to recognise him.  He looked at me and then at my brother, whose attention was occupied by the older bushranger and did not notice him as I was doing.  \"Oh, oh, oh!\" exclaimed the man, after the warning Guy had given him; and, without saying another word, he and his companions turned their horses' heads and rode away in the direction from whence they had come. Probably they had been attracted by the smoke of our fire, and expected to find some travellers unprepared for them; so we should have been had we not fallen in with Bracewell, and should certainly have lost our baggage and horses, and perhaps our lives.  \"We have had a narrow escape, for there is no doubt about those fellows being bushrangers,\" I observed to Guy.  \"Not the slightest,\" replied my brother.  \"I felt that there was only one way to deal with them.  Had we shown the slightest hesitation or nervousness, they would have attempted to frighten us into submission.\"  \"Did you notice the countenance of one of the others?\"  I asked.  \"I could not help fancying that I knew it well.  If it were not so very improbable, I should say that it was that of a fellow I remember at school when I first went there.  I wish that you had observed him, for as you must have known him better than I did, you would have been more sure about the matter.\"  \"What, do you mean the youngest of the three?\" asked Guy.  \"The fact is I did note him.  It struck me that he was wonderfully like a fellow I always stood clear of, though he especially tried to make friends with me.  If you remember the name of the person you think he was, tell me, and I shall better be able to judge whether I am right.\"  \"I am nearly certain then that it was Cyril Vinson.\"  \"You are right,\" answered Guy.  \"He was a clever fellow without a particle of principle; and I remember hearing it reported some time after he left school, that he had committed forgery, and that, although he was not convicted, his friends had sent him out of the country.\"  We talked over the matter, and agreed that it was very strange we should so soon after our arrival in the country have fallen in, under such extraordinary circumstances, with two old school-fellows.  The day passed by without another visit, either from the bushrangers or the blacks.  As may be supposed, we kept a remarkably bright look-out during the night.  Either Guy or I remained awake, walking up and down in the neighbourhood of our camp-fire.  Directly the bells on the necks of our horses sounded faint, we sent out Toby to drive them in, that we might run as little risk as possible of their being carried off.  Bracewell had told us that sometimes natives stole up and speared the horses at night, or tried to drive them away from the camp, though they might not venture to attack their owners.  We had chiefly therefore to fear a trick of this sort being played us, but it was almost impossible to guard against the horses being surprised during the darkness, should they be at any distance from the camp.  As those we had fallen in with appeared to be friendly, we hoped that we should escape so unpleasant a loss.  As the next day passed on we looked at our watches, anxiously"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21383"],["title","Adventures in Australia (#4)"],["body","Bracewell.  With the chance of another visit from the bushrangers, we did not like to go far from the camp; but we shot as many birds as we wanted, though Toby would have been happier had we brought him a kangaroo, that he might gorge himself to his heart's content.  As I had been awake so much during the night, I felt very sleepy, and had thrown myself on the ground to get some rest, when I heard Guy say--  \"Here come a couple of horsemen, but whether they are Bracewell and a companion, or the bushrangers returning, I cannot say.  At all events we must be prepared for them.\"  I sprang to my feet, and Toby was sent to bring in the horses.  Our apprehensions of another visit from the bushrangers were soon set at rest when we recognised Bracewell, who was followed by another man leading a spare horse.  \"I am sorry to have kept you so long,\" he exclaimed, as he threw himself from his steed.  \"Our horses had strayed, frightened by the blacks, who have killed one of them.  If we come across the fellows they must look out for broken heads in consequence.  However, Bob and I succeeded in catching three, and then lost no time in coming to you.\"  When we told him of the visit we had received from the bushrangers, he exclaimed:--  \"We must run those fellows down.  It is too bad that we should be unable to ride in security through the country without the risk of being robbed, perhaps murdered, by such villains.\"  We immediately saddled our horses, packed our traps on our baggage animal, and prepared to go forward under Bracewell's guidance.  Old Bob, his hut-keeper and factotum, dropped behind to drive on the baggage-horse at a greater speed than Toby was inclined to move.  I heard him talking to the black in a lingo which was utterly incomprehensible to me.  Bracewell was much astonished when Guy told him that we had recognised Cyril Vinson among the bushrangers.  We were once more, on account of the slow pace of our baggage-horse, compelled to camp, but as Bracewell wished to get back to his hut that night, he rode forward, leaving old Bob to guide us in the morning.  Old Bob undertook to keep watch, and as he did not look like a man who would go to sleep while so engaged, we were able to rest securely.  It was nearly evening the next day when we caught sight of the huts forming our friend's station.  He came forward to meet us.  \"I expected you somewhat sooner,\" he said.  \"As Bob was away, I was engaged in performing one of his duties--feeding the inhabitants of my farm-yard.  I have a curious lot, which I have caught and tamed at different times.  Here they are, come and have a look at them.\"  And he led the way to an enclosure with a hut on one side of it.  As he stooped down, ducks and fowls rushed forward to obtain the food he held in his hand, the pigs came grunting up, and several long-legged birds-- storks I believe they were--stood by waiting for their share, numerous parrots and parroquets were perched on the railings, as tame as the barn-door fowls, while a laughing-jackass looked on complacently from an overhanging bough, every now and then uttering its strange notes.  Bracewell directed Bob to finish feeding the birds, and ushered us into the hut.  It was about thirty feet long and twelve wide, roughly built with a verandah in front, and contained a centre room and one on either side.  The interior was far neater than I had expected from the appearance of the outside, and was furnished with tables and chairs, and several cupboards and some book-shelves; the walls were ornamented with a few pictures and native weapons, while two spare guns and some pistols were against them.  A couple of large Scotch deer hounds of a badger-like colour accompanied their master.  They were intelligent, powerful-looking animals, and were used, he told us, for hunting the kangaroo.  Before a fire in a smaller hut on one side of the main building, two joints of mutton were roasting.  \"I can give you but bush fare,\" said our host, \"mutton, damper, and tea; for of wine and spirits I have none, with the exception of a bottle of brandy, which I keep safely locked up for reasons which I will explain to you.\"  Besides the large hut I have described there were two smaller ones and a shed, which served as a stable and cowhouse.  Near them was an enclosed field and small kitchen-garden, such as is not often seen at an Australian cattle or sheep station.  To the west was a thick wood, which afforded shelter from the winds blowing at times hot and sand-laden from the interior; while in front was a slight dip, at the bottom of which was the bed of a river, but through it a trickling stream alone at present found its way to the eastward.  Here and there appeared groves of acacias, while as far as the eye could reach in every other direction were grassy downs, scattered over which we caught sight of a considerable herd of sheep wending their way homewards.  Altogether, Bracewell's station presented a more civilised aspect than any we had fallen in with on our journey.    CHAPTER THREE.  We spent a pleasant evening with Bracewell, talking over old times and our future prospects.  He gave us a great deal of good advice, by which we hoped to profit.  \"I am very glad you have come out, old fellows, for I am sure you will succeed if you stick to work,\" he observed.  \"I have not done badly.  I began with eight head of cattle, and now I have three hundred; and with forty sheep, which have become upwards of two thousand.  I should have had a larger number had I known more of the business when I commenced, but I have lost many by disease and dingoes, and the natives.  You must make up your mind to take the rough and smooth together, and not despair though you happen to get what they call a run of ill-luck--which in nine cases out of ten arises from a man's carelessness.  I confess that I have sometimes felt my solitude; but yet, with my friends on the shelves up there, and these faithful animals at my feet, I have had no great reason to complain.  I also remember that I should have been much worse off in many respects had I remained at home.\"  \"But what about the blacks and the bushrangers?\" asked Guy.  \"The blacks have been troublesome at times, but I have hitherto been able to keep them at bay,\" answered Bracewell; \"and with regard to the bushrangers, none have ever paid me a visit.  The fellows who stuck me up the other day were the first I had the misfortune to fall in with.  I wonder if Vinson recognised me; but I think not, or if he did he kept out of sight.  I am grieved to think it was him, as he will certainly, before long, come to an untimely end; for no bushranger ultimately escapes, and most of them run but a very short career: they either get shot or die of starvation and sickness in the bush.\"  When we talked of continuing our journey the next day, Bracewell would not hear of it.  \"Your relative does not expect you,\" he observed, \"and you will pick up more useful knowledge on my station than you will on a more extensive run; besides which I want you to have some hunting with me, to show you this part of the country.\"  Nothing loth, we agreed to Bracewell's proposal.  It was not until a late hour, for the bush, that we turned into our bunks in one of the side-rooms, which he told us he kept as his guest-chamber.  Bracewell slept in a hammock in the sitting-room, while old Bob occupied the other room.  The first day we spent riding over the run, visiting the cattle and inspecting the sheep.  In the evening Bracewell proposed that we should go into the neighbouring wood in search of opossum, whose skins he wished to obtain to make some rugs, which he said he wanted to sleep on when camping out or to serve as coverlets in cold weather.  His shepherd possessed a couple of small dogs, famous opossum hunters.  The sheep having been penned, their master was requested to accompany us.  The Australian opossum is a long-bodied short-legged little animal, with a furry tail by which he can suspend himself on the branches of trees, while it assists him to make rapid progress among them.  He is fond of hiding himself in the holes of decayed trees, out of which it is no easy matter to smoke him.  Being a nocturnal animal he is more generally captured during the day-time, for the bright light of the sun puzzles him and he knows not in what direction to make his escape.  We soon arrived at a large hole in a gum-tree round which the dogs began barking, leaving us no doubt that several opossums were ensconced within.  Our first care was to collect a quantity of sticks and green leaves; when, a fire being kindled inside the hole, the smoke began to ascend, filling the whole of the cavity, which extended to where the boughs branched off.  The moon having risen, we could see almost as well as in daylight.  Before long, three or four little creatures emerged from the hole and began to make their way upwards.  One, however, almost suffocated by the smoke, fell to the ground; when the dogs, instantly pouncing upon it, would have torn it to pieces had not their master pulled them off.  Guy shot another, and two more were brought to the ground by the sticks which the rest of us hove at them before they had recovered their senses, after having been so unexpectedly smoked out of their nests.  We were equally successful with two other trees, round which the dogs gave tongue, and after an hour's hunting we returned carrying our prizes, which took Bracewell and his shepherd some time to clean.  \"Of course opossum hunting is but tame work, I'll allow,\" exclaimed Bracewell while washing his hands after having cleaned the last of the beasts; \"but as you are both good horsemen and have steady nerves we will to-morrow go in chase of some wild cattle which have appeared in the bush not far off.  I should not object to kill a couple of them, as we are in want of fresh meat and I cannot afford to slaughter my sheep. Perhaps on the way we may fall in with a kangaroo, which"]]]
