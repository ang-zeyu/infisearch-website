Still, their strength went down. Since the beginning of the winter they had travelled eighteen hundred miles, dragging sleds the whole weary distance; and eighteen hundred miles will tell upon life of the toughest. Buck stood it, keeping his mates up to their work and maintaining discipline, though he, too, was very tired. Billee cried and whimpered regularly in his sleep each night. Joe was sourer than ever, and Sol-leks was unapproachable, blind side or other side.  But it was Dave who suffered most of all. Something had gone wrong with him. He became more morose and irritable, and when camp was pitched at once made his nest, where his driver fed him. Once out of the harness and down, he did not get on his feet again till harness-up time in the morning. Sometimes, in the traces, when jerked by a sudden stoppage of the sled, or by straining to start it, he would cry out with pain. The driver examined him, but could find nothing. All the drivers became interested in his case. They talked it over at meal-time, and over their last pipes before going to bed, and one night they held a consultation. He was brought from his nest to the fire and was pressed and prodded till he cried out many times. Something was wrong inside, but they could locate no broken bones, could not make it out.  By the time Cassiar Bar was reached, he was so weak that he was falling repeatedly in the traces. The Scotch half-breed called a halt and took him out of the team, making the next dog, Sol-leks, fast to the sled. His intention was to rest Dave, letting him run free behind the sled. Sick as he was, Dave resented being taken out, grunting and growling while the traces were unfastened, and whimpering broken-heartedly when he saw Sol-leks in the position he had held and served so long. For the pride of trace and trail was his, and, sick unto death, he could not bear that another dog should do his work.  When the sled started, he floundered in the soft snow alongside the beaten trail, attacking Sol-leks with his teeth, rushing against him and trying to thrust him off into the soft snow on the other side, striving to leap inside his traces and get between him and the sled, and all the while whining and yelping and crying with grief and pain. The half-breed tried to drive him away with the whip; but he paid no heed to the stinging lash, and the man had not the heart to strike harder. Dave refused to run quietly on the trail behind the sled, where the going was easy, but continued to flounder alongside in the soft snow, where the going was most difficult, till exhausted. Then he fell, and lay where he fell, howling lugubriously as the long train of sleds churned by.  With the last remnant of his strength he managed to stagger along behind till the train made another stop, when he floundered past the sleds to his own, where he stood alongside Sol-leks. His driver lingered a moment to get a light for his pipe from the man behind. Then he returned and started his dogs. They swung out on the trail with remarkable lack of exertion, turned their heads uneasily, and stopped in surprise. The driver was surprised, too; the sled had not moved. He called his comrades to witness the sight. Dave had bitten through both of Sol-leks’s traces, and was standing directly in front of the sled in his proper place.  He pleaded with his eyes to remain there. The driver was perplexed. His comrades talked of how a dog could break its heart through being denied the work that killed it, and recalled instances they had known, where dogs, too old for the toil, or injured, had died because they were cut out of the traces. Also, they held it a mercy, since Dave was to die anyway, that he should die in the traces, heart-easy and content. So he was harnessed in again, and proudly he pulled as of old, though more than once he cried out involuntarily from the bite of his inward hurt. Several times he fell down and was dragged in the traces, and once the sled ran upon him so that he limped thereafter in one of his hind legs.  But he held out till camp was reached, when his driver made a place for him by the fire. Morning found him too weak to travel. At harness-up time he tried to crawl to his driver. By convulsive efforts he got on his feet, staggered, and fell. Then he wormed his way forward slowly toward where the harnesses were being put on his mates. He would advance his fore legs and drag up his body with a sort of hitching movement, when he would advance his fore legs and hitch ahead again for a few more inches. His strength left him, and the last his mates saw of him he lay gasping in the snow and yearning toward them. But they could hear him mournfully howling till they passed out of sight behind a belt of river timber.  Here the train was halted. The Scotch half-breed slowly retraced his steps to the camp they had left. The men ceased talking. A revolver-shot rang out. The man came back hurriedly. The whips snapped, the bells tinkled merrily, the sleds churned along the trail; but Buck knew, and every dog knew, what had taken place behind the belt of river trees.    Chapter V. The Toil of Trace and Trail  Thirty days from the time it left Dawson, the Salt Water Mail, with Buck and his mates at the fore, arrived at Skaguay. They were in a wretched state, worn out and worn down. Buck’s one hundred and forty pounds had dwindled to one hundred and fifteen. The rest of his mates, though lighter dogs, had relatively lost more weight than he. Pike, the malingerer, who, in his lifetime of deceit, had often successfully feigned a hurt leg, was now limping in earnest. Sol-leks was limping, and Dub was suffering from a wrenched shoulder-blade.  They were all terribly footsore. No spring or rebound was left in them. Their feet fell heavily on the trail, jarring their bodies and doubling the fatigue of a day’s travel. There was nothing the matter with them except that they were dead tired. It was not the dead-tiredness that comes through brief and excessive effort, from which recovery is a matter of hours; but it was the dead-tiredness that comes through the slow and prolonged strength drainage of months of toil. There was no power of recuperation left, no reserve strength to call upon. It had been all used, the last least bit of it. Every muscle, every fibre, every cell, was tired, dead tired. And there was reason for it. In less than five months they had travelled twenty-five hundred miles, during the last eighteen hundred of which they had had but five days’ rest. When they arrived at Skaguay they were apparently on their last legs. They could barely keep the traces taut, and on the down grades just managed to keep out of the way of the sled.  “Mush on, poor sore feets,” the driver encouraged them as they tottered down the main street of Skaguay. “Dis is de las’. Den we get one long res’. Eh? For sure. One bully long res’.”  The drivers confidently expected a long stopover. Themselves, they had covered twelve hundred miles with two days’ rest, and in the nature of reason and common justice they deserved an interval of loafing. But so many were the men who had rushed into the Klondike, and so many were the sweethearts, wives, and kin that had not rushed in, that the congested mail was taking on Alpine proportions; also, there were official orders. Fresh batches of Hudson Bay dogs were to take the places of those worthless for the trail. The worthless ones were to be got rid of, and, since dogs count for little against dollars, they were to be sold.  Three days passed, by which time Buck and his mates found how really tired and weak they were. Then, on the morning of the fourth day, two men from the States came along and bought them, harness and all, for a song. The men addressed each other as “Hal” and “Charles.” Charles was a middle-aged, lightish-colored man, with weak and watery eyes and a mustache that twisted fiercely and vigorously up, giving the lie to the limply drooping lip it concealed. Hal was a youngster of nineteen or twenty, with a big Colt’s revolver and a hunting-knife strapped about him on a belt that fairly bristled with cartridges. This belt was the most salient thing about him. It advertised his callowness—a callowness sheer and unutterable. Both men were manifestly out of place, and why such as they should adventure the North is part of the mystery of things that passes understanding.  Buck heard the chaffering, saw the money pass between the man and the Government agent, and knew that the Scotch half-breed and the mail-train drivers were passing out of his life on the heels of Perrault and François and the others who had gone before. When driven with his mates to the new owners’ camp, Buck saw a slipshod and slovenly affair, tent half stretched, dishes unwashed, everything in disorder; also, he saw a woman. “Mercedes” the men called her. She was Charles’s wife and Hal’s sister—a nice family party.  Buck watched them apprehensively as they proceeded to take down the tent and load the sled. There was a great deal of effort about their manner, but no businesslike method. The tent was rolled into an awkward bundle three times as large as it should have been. The tin dishes were packed away unwashed. Mercedes continually fluttered in the way of her men and kept up an unbroken chattering of remonstrance and advice. When they put a clothes-sack on the front of the sled, she suggested it should go on the back; and when they had put it on the back, and covered it over with a couple of other bundles, she discovered overlooked articles which could abide nowhere else but in that very sack, and they unloaded again.  Three men from a neighboring tent came out and looked on, grinning and winking at one another.  “You’ve got a right smart load as it is,” said one of them; “and it’s not me should tell you your business, but I wouldn’t tote that tent along if I was you.”  “Undreamed "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2150"],["title","The Works of Edgar Allan Poe — Volume 4 (#0)"],["body","Works of Edgar Allan Poe  by Edgar Allan Poe  The Raven Edition  VOLUME IV.

Everybody knows, in a general way, that the finest place in the       world is—or, alas, _was_—the Dutch borough of       Vondervotteimittiss. Yet as it lies some distance from any of the       main roads, being in a somewhat out-of-the-way situation, there       are perhaps very few of my readers who have ever paid it a visit.       For the benefit of those who have not, therefore, it will be only       proper that I should enter into some account of it. And this is       indeed the more necessary, as with the hope of enlisting public       sympathy in behalf of the inhabitants, I design here to give a       history of the calamitous events which have so lately occurred       within its limits. No one who knows me will doubt that the duty       thus self-imposed will be executed to the best of my ability,       with all that rigid impartiality, all that cautious examination       into facts, and diligent collation of authorities, which should       ever distinguish him who aspires to the title of historian.        By the united aid of medals, manuscripts, and inscriptions, I am       enabled to say, positively, that the borough of       Vondervotteimittiss has existed, from its origin, in precisely       the same condition which it at present preserves. Of the date of       this origin, however, I grieve that I can only speak with that       species of indefinite definiteness which mathematicians are, at       times, forced to put up with in certain algebraic formulae. The       date, I may thus say, in regard to the remoteness of its       antiquity, cannot be less than any assignable quantity       whatsoever.        Touching the derivation of the name Vondervotteimittiss, I       confess myself, with sorrow, equally at fault. Among a multitude       of opinions upon this delicate point—some acute, some learned,       some sufficiently the reverse—I am able to select nothing which       ought to be considered satisfactory. Perhaps the idea of       Grogswigg—nearly coincident with that of Kroutaplenttey—is to be       cautiously preferred.—It runs:—“Vondervotteimittis—Vonder, lege       Donder—Votteimittis, quasi und Bleitziz—Bleitziz obsol:—pro       Blitzen.” This derivative, to say the truth, is still       countenanced by some traces of the electric fluid evident on the       summit of the steeple of the House of the Town-Council. I do not       choose, however, to commit myself on a theme of such importance,       and must refer the reader desirous of information to the       “Oratiunculae de Rebus Praeter-Veteris,” of Dundergutz. See,       also, Blunderbuzzard “De Derivationibus,” pp. 27 to 5010, Folio,       Gothic edit., Red and Black character, Catch-word and No Cypher;       wherein consult, also, marginal notes in the autograph of       Stuffundpuff, with the Sub-Commentaries of Gruntundguzzell.        Notwithstanding the obscurity which thus envelops the date of the       foundation of Vondervotteimittis, and the derivation of its name,       there can be no doubt, as I said before, that it has always       existed as we find it at this epoch. The oldest man in the       borough can remember not the slightest difference in the       appearance of any portion of it; and, indeed, the very suggestion       of such a possibility is considered an insult. The site of the       village is in a perfectly circular valley, about a quarter of a       mile in circumference, and entirely surrounded by gentle hills,       over whose summit the people have never yet ventured to pass. For       this they assign the very good reason that they do not believe       there is anything at all on the other side.        Round the skirts of the valley (which is quite level, and paved       throughout with flat tiles), extends a continuous row of sixty       little houses. These, having their backs on the hills, must look,       of course, to the centre of the plain, which is just sixty yards       from the front door of each dwelling. Every house has a small       garden before it, with a circular path, a sun-dial, and       twenty-four cabbages. The buildings themselves are so precisely       alike, that one can in no manner be distinguished from the other.       Owing to the vast antiquity, the style of architecture is       somewhat odd, but it is not for that reason the less strikingly       picturesque. They are fashioned of hard-burned little bricks,       red, with black ends, so that the walls look like a chess-board       upon a great scale. The gables are turned to the front, and there       are cornices, as big as all the rest of the house, over the eaves       and over the main doors. The windows are narrow and deep, with       very tiny panes and a great deal of sash. On the roof is a vast       quantity of tiles with long curly ears. The woodwork, throughout,       is of a dark hue and there is much carving about it, with but a       trifling variety of pattern for, time out of mind, the carvers of       Vondervotteimittiss have never been able to carve more than two       objects—a time-piece and a cabbage. But these they do exceedingly       well, and intersperse them, with singular ingenuity, wherever       they find room for the chisel.        The dwellings are as much alike inside as out, and the furniture       is all upon one plan. The floors are of square tiles, the chairs       and tables of black-looking wood with thin crooked legs and puppy       feet. The mantelpieces are wide and high, and have not only       time-pieces and cabbages sculptured over the front, but a real       time-piece, which makes a prodigious ticking, on the top in the       middle, with a flower-pot containing a cabbage standing on each       extremity by way of outrider. Between each cabbage and the       time-piece, again, is a little China man having a large stomach       with a great round hole in it, through which is seen the       dial-plate of a watch.        The fireplaces are large and deep, with fierce crooked-looking       fire-dogs. There is constantly a rousing fire, and a huge pot       over it, full of sauer-kraut and pork, to which the good woman of       the house is always busy in attending. She is a little fat old       lady, with blue eyes and a red face, and wears a huge cap like a       sugar-loaf, ornamented with purple and yellow ribbons. Her dress       is of orange-colored linsey-woolsey, made very full behind and       very short in the waist—and indeed very short in other respects,       not reaching below the middle of her leg. This is somewhat thick,       and so are her ankles, but she has a fine pair of green stockings       to cover them. Her shoes—of pink leather—are fastened each with a       bunch of yellow ribbons puckered up in the shape of a cabbage. In       her left hand she has a little heavy Dutch watch; in her right       she wields a ladle for the sauerkraut and pork. By her side there       stands a fat tabby cat, with a gilt toy-repeater tied to its       tail, which “the boys” have there fastened by way of a quiz.        The boys themselves are, all three of them, in the garden       attending the pig. They are each two feet in height. They have       three-cornered cocked hats, purple waistcoats reaching down to       their thighs, buckskin knee-breeches, red stockings, heavy shoes       with big silver buckles, long surtout coats with large buttons of       mother-of-pearl. Each, too, has a pipe in his mouth, and a little       dumpy watch in his right hand. He takes a puff and a look, and       then a look and a puff. The pig—which is corpulent and lazy—is       occupied now in picking up the stray leaves that fall from the       cabbages, and now in giving a kick behind at the gilt repeater,       which the urchins have also tied to his tail in order to make him       look as handsome as the cat.        Right at the front door, in a high-backed leather-bottomed armed       chair, with crooked legs and puppy feet like the tables, is       seated the old man of the house himself. He is an exceedingly       puffy little old gentleman, with big circular eyes and a huge       double chin. His dress resembles that of the boys—and I need say       nothing farther about it. All the difference is, that his pipe is       somewhat bigger than theirs and he can make a greater smoke. Like       them, he has a watch, but he carries his watch in his pocket. To       say the truth, he has something of more importance than a watch       to attend to—and what that is, I shall presently explain. He sits       with his right leg upon his left knee, wears a grave countenance,       and always keeps one of his eyes, at least, resolutely bent upon       a certain remarkable object in the centre of the plain.        This object is situated in the steeple of the House of the Town       Council. The Town Council are all very little, round, oily,       intelligent men, with big saucer eyes and fat double chins, and       have their coats much longer and their shoe-buckles much bigger       than the ordinary inhabitants of Vondervotteimittiss. Since my       sojourn in the borough, they have had several special meetings,       and have adopted these three important resolutions:        “That it is wrong to alter the"]]]
