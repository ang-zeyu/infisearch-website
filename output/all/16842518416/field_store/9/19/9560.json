Then he stopped short with surprise, hardly knowing the children in their strange attire; but being too dignified to laugh aloud, added, with a grim smile,--  \"The woman that brought Miss Fly home the other day is down in the dining-room, and says,'Can she see one of the family?'\"  \"A little girl with her, Nat?\"  \"Yes, sir; the blind girl is with her.\"  \"And the freckled doggie!\" asked \"the long baby,\" suddenly raising her head from her father's shoulder. \"I meant to told 'em to bringed that doggie.\"  \"Let's all go down and see,\" said Mother Hubbard.  When they entered the dining-room, Mrs. Brooks started up in dismay. She had left her sick husband, and come a long distance through the storm, only to find Mrs. Allen gone, and a parcel of children decked out like circus-riders. It seemed like a cruel mockery.  \"Beg pardon,\" said she. \"Maria, we'll go home now.\"  Maria was sitting near her mother, trying to force back the tears which would find their way through her closed eyes.  \"You poor dear girl,\" said Mother Hubbard, going up to her, and taking her hand. \"My auntie was so sorry to go off to-day, just when you were coming! but she had to, for Uncle Augustus is sick. And it looks funny to you--I mean to your mother--to see us dressed up this way; but auntie said we might, just to keep us from being so lonesome. And Mrs. Brooks, she wants you to call again the day after _the day after_ to-morrow. She thinks she'll be home then.\"  \"Yes'm,\" struck in my Lady Magnifico! \"She thinks she'll come then with Uncle 'Gustus. He isn't much sick. If he was going to die, we wouldn't dress up so, certainly.\"  \"No,\" replied Mrs. Brooks, smiling. \"It's just as well; my Maria must have patience; that's all.\"  \"Patience!\" thought Maria; \"haven't I had it, and had it?--But I do suppose God will attend to me when He thinks best. Is this what they call waiting on the Lord?\"  \"When you come nex' time, I hope you'll bring that doggie,\" said Fly.  Then they went away, and the last thing Maria listened to was Fly's melodious voice; and the last thing Fly looked at was Mrs. Brooks's nose moving up and down.     CHAPTER IV.  GOING TO HOUSEKEEPING.   It was nearly noon before Mrs. Fixfax had made her room ready for housekeeping. She turned up her bed into a press that stood beside the wall, brought in a high chair, a small rocking chair, two ottomans, some pictures and picture-books, and nearly all the curiosities she could find in the house. A cunning little cooking-stove, highly polished, was set against the chimney, and the drollest shovel and tongs seemed to be making \"dumb love\" to each other across the fireplace, like a black Punch and Judy. Then there was a pair of brazen-faced bellows, hanging, nose downward, on a brass nail; a large table in one corner, with a cake-board on it, and near it a cupboard made out of an old clothes-press, with dishes in it, and flour, sugar, raisins, spices, rolling-pin, \"aerating egg-beater,\" yellow bowls, wooden spoons, and everything that could be needed in cooking for a very large family. There were five rugs spread on the carpet, and a large oilcloth under the stove. Last, but not least, Mrs. Fixfax brought Mrs. Allen's tortoise-shell cat, and set her in a stuffed chair by the west window.  Then she called the children; and Mother Hubbard and Lady Magnifico rushed in, followed by the Man in the Moon and his baby.  \"Good morning, all; I hope I see you well,\" said Mrs. Fixfax, as sober as Nathaniel himself. \"This room is yours as long as you like. Make yourselves perfectly at home.\"  \"Thank you ever so much,\" replied Mother Hubbard, bobbing her head, while the \"pillow-sham\" ruffles waved this way and that, like a field of ripe grain.  \"Whenever you want anything, just ring this bell, and I will come; or, if you ring the other one, it will bring Rachel. And, Miss Prudy, here is the 'Young Housekeeper's Friend;' perhaps you would like to look it over.\"  Mother Hubbard blushed to her cap-border, and took the book with another \"Thank you ever so much,\" but did not know what else to say to such a dignified woman.  The truth was, Mrs. Fixfax was trying so hard to keep from laughing, that her manner was rather stiff and cold.  \"I have left the ventilator open,\" thought she. \"The children are full of talk, and I don't want to lose a word. Besides, Mrs. Allen would consider it safer for me to know all that's going on.\"  \"There, glad she's gone,\" said Lady Magnifico, as Mrs. Fixfax's stately form disappeared.  \"She isn't as pretty as the _new_ Miss _Fixfix_. 'Spect she's got the toothache,\" suggested the talking infant, who was trying to lie and coo on a rug, but was unable to do it.  \"Well said, little Toddle; false toothache, hey?\"  \"Are they false, Mr. Moony? Then that was why she puckered up her lips so funny,\" said Mother Hubbard; \"it was to keep 'em in!\"  \"Yes; and take her, teeth and all, her face has about as much expression as a platter of cold hash. I'll leave it to you if it hasn't, Prue.\"  \"Why, there, Miss Fixfix never asked me to kiss her one time,\" said Fly, with sudden astonishment.  \"Reckon you'd have wanted a lump of sugar after it, Topknot.\"  The good-natured housekeeper shook with laughter as she listened to these remarks from the next room.  \"What a terrible creature this _Miss Fixfix_ is!\" thought she. \"Well, if they've got such an idea of me, I won't try to change it. Not for the rest of the day, at any rate. I'll keep my distance, and let 'em work.\"  Mother Hubbard began to look about her with the mien of a housekeeper.  \"Let us see: what are we burning here?\" said she, taking off a stove-cover. \"Wood, I declare. Mrs. Fixfax is afraid I couldn't manage coal!\"  \"And here's a 'normous big box full of sticks,\" said Lady Magnifico. \"I didn't s'pose wood grew in New York. What now, Mr. Moon? Don't I know wood is sawed out of trees? Well, what you laughing at, then?\"  \"Laughing, my lady? Why, who can help it, to see such a jolly room, big enough to hold a mass-meeting? That's a loud-spoken clock up there. Wonder if Mother Hubbard notices it's just going to strike twelve?\"  Prudy looked up, but did not take the hint.  \"I'm so glad I remembered to bring that clock. I always used to tell my dog I prized it as much as he did his dear little tail.--Why, what's burning? That child has scorched her slip. Do take care of her, Mr.--what may I call you?--while I look over this cupboard.\"  \"Call me Dr. Moonshine, if you want to.\"  \"I'm glad I was so thoughtful as to order sugar,\" continued the landlady. \"It's excellent to drop medicine on. What's this in a bowl? Ice-cream?\"  \"Why, don't you know what that is?\" said Lady Magnifico, sweeping along to the cupboard, and dipping in her dainty finger; \"that's _condemned milk_.'  \"_Condensed_ milk, her ladyship means,\" said the doctor, \"boiled down, you know, and thickened. When you make a custard for dinner, you'll have to put in a tea-kettle full of water.\"  This was the second hint the young man had thrown out concerning dinner; but Prudy was not to be hurried.  \"What's this in a little caddy? O, it's rice. No; it's what Dotty used to call _coker whacker_.\"  \"What does she call it now, may I ask?\" said the doctor, with an irritating smile.  \"_Patti-coker_--what you s'pose?\" was the rash reply. Poor Lady Magnifico! Little tingles of shame ran down her fingers as soon as she had spoken, for she saw, by the glances between her landlady and the doctor, that she had made another mistake.  \"O, I like to keep house,\" cried Fly, holding up her trailing robes, and dancing over a carpet seam. \"What's this goldy thing?\"  \"Bellows, Toddlekins, to blow up the fire. See me fill out their leather cheeks.\"  \"What pretty little _blozers_! Let me blow 'em!\"  There was a second dash upon the stove, and another scorch in the slip.  \"There ought to be a fence built round that stove,\" said the anxious father.  \"Come, Mother Hubbard, have you seen all there is in the cupboard? Can't you give this poor old dog a bone?\"  \"Well, here I am with the care of the family on my shoulders,\" thought Mother Hubbard, winking fast behind the green spectacles, and recalling uneasily the couplet her father often repeated:--      \"Think well before you pursue it;     But when you begin, go through it.\"  \"Now what'll we have for dinner?\"  Lady Magnifico was walking languidly about, admiring herself in the mirror, Dr. Moonshine rummaging an old closet, and Baby pulling out the bureau drawers.  \"They have the easy part. But never mind; I'll show them what I can do. Mother says I have a great deal more taste for cooking than Susy has. Didn't I make pickles all one vacation?\"  Then Prudy sat down with the \"Housekeeper's Friend,\" and began at the first page to read. Half an hour passed, and no signs of her moving.  \"I'm hunger-y,\" whispered Baby, taking a sugar-coated pill out of a box, and touching it with her tongue. It was sweet till her teeth went into it, when out rolled the little ball upon the floor.  \"O, my shole! How bitter!\" groaned she, wiping her mouth on a lace cuff. \"'Spect that's a pill, and they cooked it in sugar; but I shan't eat it.\"  \"Little daughter, what are you doing there? Mustn't meddle with other folks' things.\" Dr. Moonshine sneezed as he spoke, having breathed some of the \"dust of ages\" into his nose off a top shelf, where Mrs. Fixfax kept a few herbs. Ten minutes more. The doctor stepped down from the chair-back on which he had been standing, and gazed hard at his landlady. She was turning the sixteenth page.  \"My Lady Magnifico!\"  \"Sir?\"  \"My lady, do you happen to have such a thing as a peanut in your pocket?\"  My lady shook the cat out of the armchair, and seated herself.  \"It isn't"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20984"],["title","Prudy Keeping House (#4)"],["body","to carry round peanuts.\"  \"I was only thinking,\" continued the doctor, with a side glance at Mother Hubbard, \"how nice a peanut would be to keep anybody from fainting away.\"  Mother Hubbard started from her chair. \"What unfashionable boarders! You don't expect dinner in the middle of the day, I hope! In the city of New York we don't have it till five or six o'clock. I'm afraid you came down too soon, Dr. Moonshine.\"  \"Afraid I did. Wish I was 'the man in the South.' I'd like to 'burn my mouth' on a little 'cold plum porridge.'\"  \"Haven't any for you; but I'll give you a lunch. What say to omelettes and coffee?\"  \"Excellent,\" said Dr. Moonshine, reviving.  \"Exquisite,\" drawled my lady.  \"_Exquit_,\" quoth Fly.  \"Only there isn't any coffee,\" said Mother Hubbard, going to the cupboard.  \"Call it tea,\" said the doctor, \"and hurry up.\"  \"No, chocolate is better. How do you make chocolate?\" said the landlady, turning to her cook-book.  \"I don't know, and don't care,\" fumed the doctor. \"Baked in a _slow_ oven, most likely, with a top crust. Let the chocolate slide.\"  \"Well, I will. And now I'll make the omelette. Eggs? yes; there are eggs enough; but dear me, where's the milk? This _condemned_ kind my lady tells about won't do to make omelettes. I shouldn't dare try it.\"  \"Well, well, give us a little bread and butter. I've got past being particular.\"  \"O, Dr. Moonshine, such biscuits as I'm going to bake for you at five o'clock! But now I really can't find a speck of bread!\"  \"I'll warrant it! I always heard that when old Mother Hubbard went to her cupboard she found the shelves were all bare.\"  \"Then you needn't have come here to board. Won't crackers and raisins do?\"  They had to do; and the boarders tried to be satisfied in view of the coming dinner.  All the afternoon Mother Hubbard spent between the cake-board and the mouth of the oven.  \"Queen of the rolling-pin, can't you hush up this fire?\" said Dr. Moonshine, looking at the thermometer; \"we're nearly up to 'butter melts,' and I suppose you know that's ninety degrees.\"  \"Dr. Moonshine,\" replied Mother Hubbard, nervously, \"I can't help it if the butter does melt. We've got to have something to eat.\"  \"Papa, pin up my dress,\" said the baby. \"I want to do sumpin. I want some pastry to paste a book with.\"  \"You're a real failure, Toddlekins. Your teeth have come, and you talk and keep talking. I'm afraid Mother Hubbard will charge me full price for your board. You hear what she calls for, ma'am? Can you make her a little paste? Here's an old Patent Office Report; and I'll run the risk of her spoiling it. I'll cut some pictures for her out of these papers.\"  \"Lucky I don't keep a file of my newspapers,\" thought Mrs. Fixfax, listening from the next room. \"If I did, those children would hear from me.\"  \"Yes, I'll make her some paste,\" said Mother Hubbard, dropping the aerating egg-beater, and setting the spice-box on the stove.  Dr. Moonshine laughed. Mother Hubbard had never dreamed a boarder could be so disagreeable. She snatched off the spice-box, and setting a kettle on the stove, boiled paste enough to paper the walls of a room.  Meanwhile Fly was making free with the nutmegs and soda, and the little cook could not remember how far along she had got with the cake.  \"Children don't annoy you, I hope,\" said the doctor, seating the baby at the side of the table, opposite Mother Hubbard, and giving her a stick with a rag wound around the end of it, in order to paste pictures into a scrap-book.  \"Thank you, doctor. I never did like children half as well as dogs,\" replied Mother Hubbard, forcing a smile. Then she tasted her cake slyly, to make sure whether she had put the butter in or not.  \"Madam Hubbard, mim,\" said Lady Magnifico, \"may I trouble you for a glass of water?\"  \"Mamma Hubbard, may I have a hangfiss to wipe off the pastry?\"  Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard, and got a goblet for the lady; to the closet, and found a rag for the baby.  By that time she smelt something burning; it was eggs. She had left the patent egg-beater on the stove by accident, and its contents were as black as a shoe.  \"O, what a frightful, alarming odor!\" cried Lady Magnifico. \"If somebody doesn't throw up a window! Madam, do tell us what's afire now!\"  \"Mother Hubbard's got a dumb chill,\" said the doctor; \"she won't speak.\"  But Prudy was saying under breath, \"Please, God, let me keep pleasant. They don't mean any harm, and I _should_ be ashamed to get angry just about a play.\"  \"What ails you, Mother Hubbard? 'You look as blue as the skimmiest kind of skim-milk.'\"  \"Do I? Well, no wonder, with such troublesome boarders. Suppose you and my lady go down to the parlor. I don't believe I'm a bit interesting, you know. I'll call you when dinner is ready.\"  \"Agreed! Sharp five, remember.\"  \"There,\" said Mother Hubbard, taking off her spectacles; \"now I can cook.\"  Could she?  \"Little folks we is to keep house--isn't we?\" buzzed the little torment that was left behind. \"Hush! don't you talk, Prudy. When you shake the table, then I make blots with my pastry.\"  Prudy said nothing, but thoughtfully tasted the cake again. How could she tell whether she had left out the soda?  \"Are you _blind of your ears_, Prudy, Can't you hear nuffin what I say? Rag's come off the stick. Please to tie it on. And _I_ want to eat some o' that dough.\"  Mother Hubbard did her blundering best; but ill luck seemed to pursue the cooking.  \"Needn't call that book the 'Young Housekeeper's Friend.' It's an enemy, a real bitter enemy,\" cried she, in great excitement. \"Wood is hotter than coal, too. Mrs. Fixfax must have given it to me to plague me. How it does burn things up! I hope beefsteak is cheap. I won't ask anybody to eat this, all covered with ashes. I'll never try to broil any again on top of a stick of wood! I won't try that 'steamboat pudding.' Sounds as if 'twould burn, and I know it would. Let 'em go without pudding.\"  After the most tiresome afternoon she had ever spent in her life, Mother Hubbard went down with Fly, whom she dared not leave by herself, to call her boarders to dinner.     CHAPTER V.  MOTHER HUBBARD'S DINNER.   This was Mrs. Allen's \"reception-day,\" the day on which she always staid at home, that her friends might be sure of finding her in.  \"Not at home,\" Nathaniel had kept saying to visitors that afternoon. But one of them, a queenly-looking lady, would not be satisfied with the answer.  \"Are the children here?\" demanded she. \"Those nieces and nephews?\"  Nathaniel did not know exactly what reply to make; so he invited the lady into the parlor, and went to inquire.  Dr. Moonshine and Lady Magnifico were in the drawing-room, looking over engravings.  \"Gnat, gnat, you troublesome insect,\" said the doctor. \"I heard auntie tell you we were not to be disturbed.\"  \"But what could I say?\" asked the insect, humbly. \"I couldn't tell her 'not at home.'\"  \"You must say, 'Beg to be excused;' those are the proper words,\" said my lady.  \"Yes,\" added the doctor; \"go, there's a good gnat, and sting 'em like sixty, if they don't start quick.\"  Nathaniel obeyed, looking as dignified as ever, though nothing but a strong sense of propriety kept him from smiling.  He had not crossed the hall before Mother Hubbard entered the parlor, dragging Fly, who was pinned to her skirts.  Mother Hubbard was flushed and excited, her nose dusted with flour, her cap pulled entirely over her forehead; and she was saying, in a loud tone, \"I can't take any peace of my life, Fly Clifford, you know I can't, unless I get you fastened somehow.\"  \"I don't 'low folks to _fassin_ me,\" responded Fly, shaking her lace cap in a blaze of wrath; \"the next that _fassins_ me, I'll _scwatch who did it_!\"  It was not at all like either of the children to talk in this way, any more than it was like them to be dressed in such ridiculous costume. The effect upon the lady visitor was quite startling. She started, smiled, rose from her chair, and held out her hand.  \"Now tell me if this isn't Miss Prudy Parlin. I have seen your picture, my love.\"  What eyes, to spy out a likeness under all the flour and furbelows, not to mention the green spectacles! Prudy quivered like a frightened mouse, but could not get away, for a trap was sprung upon her; a steel-gloved hand was holding her fast.  \"I am Madam Pragoffyetski, a Polish runaway. You may not have heard of me, but I know all about Prudy and little Thistledown Flyaway.\"  \"Nicely, thank you, m'm,\" responded Miss Fly, in a voice as faint as the peep of a chicken; at the same time darting forward and tearing a piece out of her slip. \"If she runned away I'd be 'shamed to tell of it.\"  \"How awful for her to come here!\" thought Mother Hubbard, stealing a timid glance at the lady's ermine muff. \"She looks nice, but I don't want anything to do with such people.\"  \"Don't be afraid of me, dears,\" said the lady, laughing; \"I call myself a runaway just in sport. I am a warm admirer of yours, and my dear friend, your auntie, has promised me a visit from you. I came on purpose to ask you, and your sister, and your cousins to my house to dinner to-morrow. Will you come?\"  Mother Hubbard gazed doubtfully at the steel-colored glove. What could she say?  \"Thank you ever so much, Mrs.--Mrs. Pradigoff, but Fly is not allowed to go out.\"  Flyaway was greatly chagrined.  \"Well, I--I _solomon_ promised,\" said she, casting down her guilty eyes, as she remembered the orange man; \"I solomon promised I would't go ou' doors, _athout_ somebody _lets_ me.\"  \"There's a tender conscience for you,\" laughed the Polish lady. \"Why was she not to go out, Miss Prudy?\"  \"Because she is so quick-motioned, ma'am. Before you know it she's lost. That's the reason I pinned her to my dress. You see, ma'am, we are playing 'keep house.'\"  \"O, if her quickness is all the trouble, I'll take the responsibility that she shan't get lost. I'll bind her fast with a silken chain. Really, children, my heart is set on your coming. My house"]]]
