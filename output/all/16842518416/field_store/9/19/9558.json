I recollect asking whether he had     showed the paper to you: he said No; but did not add any     injunction to me not to do so; indeed, if he had, I should have     stated to him the impossibility of my keeping from you a     circumstance of that importance, or of my becoming, by my     silence in it, a separate party to a business which it was my     duty fully and entirely to lay before you and to receive from     you; nor indeed at this moment is the knowledge of it confined     to Lord Shelburne; as I am pretty sure Oswald told me that Lord     Ashburton was with Lord Shelburne when he, Oswald, asked if he     might give any answer to Franklin about the paper, or rather     observed that he supposed he could not then have any answer to     it. Under these circumstances, the difficulty with regard to the     Canada paper, of which I have no copy, lies more possibly in the     indelicacy and perhaps bad policy of bringing forward Franklin     where he wished so much not to appear, than in the quoting it     from me. I do not wish to be quoted, if there exists the least     doubt whether I should. But I cannot more exactly explain to you     the whole extent of that doubt, than by showing you that it does     not exist in any specific obligation on my part, but only in the     nature of what was told to me; the subject itself carrying with     it, as you will see, many reasons for secrecy, and every mark of     it in the manner of conducting it; but as to positive engagement     or obligation upon this subject, I have none.      The remaining circumstance--of the intention mentioned to Mr.     Oswald by Lord Shelburne, of giving him a commission if it     should be necessary--stands altogether clear of the slightest     shade of difficulty upon the point of confidence; indeed, at the     time I wrote you word of it, I did not imagine I was informing     you of anything new or unknown to you; and only so far meant to     dwell upon it, as to regret its happening precisely at the     instant when it was most important it should not. I apprehended     that Lord Shelburne might have already expressed such an     intention to the rest of the King's Ministers, upon the ground     of the American share of this business, which ground, in the     present stage of it, I thought possibly you had not found it     easy to object to. In this idea it was that Lord Fitzwilliam's     appointment occurred to me, not to prevent a clandestine     negotiation, but to unite a separated one; always imagining that     you knew of, but did not resist, the intended commission to Mr.     Oswald, and therefore hinting the expediency of superseding it,     by giving to another person an appointment of such rank and     magnitude as should include a power which it seems neither for     the public interest, nor for yours and your friends' interests,     to leave separate and distinct.      To return, however, to the point of confidence: upon this last     subject there is none; and you are certainly at full liberty to     proclaim at Charing Cross that Lord Shelburne told Mr. Oswald he     supposed he would not object to a commission if it should be     necessary; and that since his last return to Paris, Mr. Oswald     has told me he found it very much Franklin's wish likewise. If I     may repeat, therefore, in a few words, what I have tried to     express to you in a good many, it is that, as to Franklin's     first intention of a private and confidential communication with     me, I hold myself so engaged in secrecy to him, that I think it     would be a breach of confidence in me to have that intention at     all spoken of. As to the Canada paper, I leave it, with the     comment I have made upon it, altogether to your discretion; and     as to the proposed commission, you are certainly at full liberty     to say of it what you please. I have it not in my power to give     you any additional proofs of sinister management in this     business. I seldom see Oswald, though upon good terms with him;     and have seen Franklin, since Oswald's coming, but once, when he     was as silent as ever, notwithstanding my reminding him of his     promise; so that I cannot help thinking that business altogether     irretrievable. But neither do I know what you will gain by     forcing Oswald's return; indeed I am inclined to think it might     be much more prudent to save appearances by leaving him here,     till you shall have completed your purpose of receiving the     propositions you wish or the refusal you wish from Versailles.     Perhaps, politically speaking, you may not think it wise to make     the conduct, or rather misconduct, of a foreign negotiation the     ground of a domestic rupture, which may betray too much weakness     and disunion; but this is too delicate a subject for me to say     anything upon, more than to assure you that, whatever is your     determination about it, you will not find me shrink from the     part I have or may have to take in it.      And one word here about the desire I have expressed to return to     England: it is impossible not to say that I feel that desire in     the strongest degree. I would not speak peevishly about my     disappointment in the unlucky check that I have met with; but I     think you will agree that the real service it might have been my     good fortune perhaps to have been assisting in, is by that check     completely annihilated, nor can any step now taken recover or     retrieve it; and that consideration weighs pretty heavily in a     situation in itself not agreeable to me. But if I repeat this     now, it is to keep you awake to the earnest solicitations I make     of returning in the first moment you may think it practicable;     till then you need have no apprehension of seeing me, but may     trust that no personal motives, however strong, can weigh     against the important reasons you state, as well as the desire     you express, for my continuing something longer at Paris.      I am writing to you on the 16th, waiting impatiently for M. de     Vergennes's answer, which he gave me reason to hope I shall have     to-morrow.       MR. THOMAS GRENVILLE TO MR. FOX.      June 21st.      I have been waiting day after day, and have not got my answer     till a few hours ago. I am sorry to have kept you so long, but     you see it was impossible to avoid it. A report prevails that     Bougainville is arrived at St. Domingo with two ships, as     likewise are the four that were at Cura√ßao. They add that Rodney     had been obliged to burn three of his captured ships. La Motthe     Peguet has twice had orders to sail from Brest with his seven     ships, and as often been recalled. They expect Guichen soon with     the fleet from Cadiz of thirty-two ships: they are said to have     sailed on the 4th.      Pray tell Sheridan to be more cautious in what he writes by the     post. If I had time I should give him a lecture; but I want to     send away the messenger.      Adieu. Oswald affects to consider me now as fully authorized,     but I believe expects different news as soon as the Independence     Bill is passed; but I cannot help thinking you had better leave     him where he is, for his going away will mend nothing. I have     bought your wine.      Ever very affectionately yours,     T.G.         *       *       *       *       *  Within a few days after this letter reached England, the Rockingham Administration had ceased to exist. The Marquis of Rockingham, whose health had been declining for some time, died on the 1st of July, and was succeeded in his title by his nephew, the Earl Fitzwilliam, who is alluded to in these letters by Mr. Thomas Grenville. The first intimation of this event conveyed to the Plenipotentiary at Paris was in a letter from his brother, Lord Temple. The circumstances that immediately followed are detailed in the letters of Lord Temple and Mr. Sheridan, written on the same day, and in a letter from Mr. Fox on the day following. The apprehension expressed by Lord Temple that Fox's resignation would be ascribed by the public to a mean contest for offices was not unfounded; although such a motive cannot be believed to have influenced the mind of that statesman, the conviction of what he felt to be his duty on this occasion being shared by Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Burke, Lord John Cavendish, Lord Althorpe and others, who instantly followed his example. The King's undisguised predilection for Lord Shelburne arose from the nearer agreement of their opinions on the American question, than existed between His Majesty and the Rockingham section of the Cabinet, who were for an unconditional recognition of the independence of America--a proceeding regarded by His Majesty with aversion. The rapidity with which the changes were adopted furnished a sufficient reason for Fox's determination not to act under Lord Shelburne, that nobleman having accepted the appointment to the Treasury immediately on the death of Lord Rockingham, without consultation with his colleagues, and Lord Grantham being appointed in the same unceremonious way to the secretaryship vacated by his Lordship. A remarkable contradiction will be observed in the language held on this occasion by Lord Shelburne, who is reported by Lord Temple to have stated that he looked naturally to the Treasury, and knew no reason why he should forego it, while to Sheridan he declared that he entered upon the office against his wish.       LORD TEMPLE TO MR. THOMAS GRENVILLE.      London, July 4th, Twelve P.M. 1782.      My dear Brother,      My letters by the post have been so unfortunate, and the subject     of the present hour is so important, that I have waited all this     day for the certainty of a courier, and I am now promised that     one shall be dispatched"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20984"],["title","Prudy Keeping House (#0)"],["body","Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustrations.

Between the ivies, tuberoses, and lilies, you caught a glimpse of gilded walls and rare paintings. Better than all, you saw four young faces looking out at a snow-storm; Dotty with eyes like living diamonds, Prudy fair and sweet, Horace lordly and wise; and the little one \"with dove's eyes\" following every motion of his head, as if she were a sunflower, and he the sun.  \"Please shut the window, quick, Horace; the plants will freeze,\" said Prudy, drawing in her powdered head.  \"Things don't freeze in cloudy weather, Prue; but you children will catch cold; so here goes.\"  \"O, Hollis, don't those snow-specks look like little bits o' birdies, athout any wings or any feathers, too?\"  \"Droll birds they would be,\" said Aunt Madge. \"That reminds me of an old riddle, children,--      \"'White bird featherless     Flew out of Paradise,     Lit on the castle wall;     Came a knight breathless,     Ate it up toothless,     Rode away horseless.'\"  \"Why, auntie, the 'bird featherless' must have been the snow; but who was the knight!\"  \"Who rides over the sky without any horse, Dotty, and melts snow by shining on it?\"  \"O, the sun--the sun!\"  \"Hollis, I want to ask you sumpin. Does those snow-specks fly down out o' heaven? Does the little angels see 'em?\"  \"No, Topknot; they only come from the clouds; they are nowhere near up to the little angels.\"  \"Not half so near as you are, Goldilocks,\" said Aunt Madge, brushing back the child's soft hair.  \"I hope you don't mean Fly's going to die,\" cried Dotty, in sudden alarm, remembering how crossly she had spoken to the child two or three times since they had been in New York.  \"No, Dotty; I only mean that we are told, in the Bible, there are 'ministering spirits,' and we believe they watch over good little children.\"  \"O, my shole!\" said Fly, folding her tiny hands, and raising her eyes to the top of the window. \"Nice, pretty little spirricks out there, only but I can't see 'em.\"  \"No, Miss Eyebright; not even you. Wait till you go where they live.\"  \"Wisht I could go up there now, a-visiting; stay all night, and three weeks and then--\"  \"Hush, Fly Clifford; you're the wickedest girl to talk,\" said Dotty. \"I shouldn't ever expect to go to heaven at all, if I said such things as you do.--O, auntie, I am so sorry it storms! Maria and her mother won't come--will they?\"  Maria Brooks was a little blind girl with whom the family were just making acquaintance. A few days before, when she was walking Broadway, led by her \"freckled doggie,\" Fly, lost on the street, had spied her, and been attracted by the dog, and Maria had persuaded the child to go home with her. Afterwards Mrs. Brooks had taken Fly back to Colonel Allen's; and in this way Aunt Madge had learned about Maria's blindness, and had offered to take her to a physician who could help her, if any one could.  \"Yes, Dotty; I presume they will come to-day, for Maria can hardly wait to have the doctor look at her eyes.\"  \"Of course they'll come,\" said Horace; \"who ever heard of _brooks_ minding the weather? Rain water agrees with 'em.\"  \"If you please, Mrs. Allen,\" said Nathaniel, appearing at the door, \"I--\"  \"O, they've come--have they, Nat?\" asked Horace. Horace was already well acquainted with the waiting man, and called him Nat, though he was a very sober youth, with velvety hair, and a green neck-tie, as stiff as a cactus.  Nat only replied by handing Mrs. Allen a letter, with a hesitating air, as if he would much rather not do it.  \"A despatch!\" cried Mrs. Allen, turning rather pale.  Dotty Dimple and Flyaway crowded close to her, and overwhelmed her with questions.  \"O, what is it?\" said one. \"Who wroted it? And why didn't Hollis bring the camphor bottle athout my asking?\" said the other.  But the older children knew better than to speak just then. As soon as Mrs. Allen could get her breath, she said,--  \"Don't be frightened, dears. It is only a message from your Uncle Augustus. He can't come home to-night, as we expected. He says, 'One of my old attacks. Nothing serious. Can you come?'\"  \"O, is that all?\" said Dotty, and ceased fanning her auntie with a book-cover.  \"O, is that all?\" echoed Fly, and left off patting her cheek with a pencil.  \"But, children,\" said Horace, \"don't you understand Uncle Augustus is sick--wants auntie to go and take care of him?\"  \"Why, he can't have her.\"  \"Indeed, Miss Dot, and why not?\"  \"She's got company, you know.\"  \"There, little sister! I wouldn't think that of you? Poor Uncle Augustus!\"  \"But he says he isn't serious,\" said Dotty, looking ashamed. \"Auntie, you don't think he's serious--do you?\"  \"No, dear; he's suffering very much, but I am not in the least alarmed. He has had just such attacks as this ever since he came out of the army. He is at a hotel in Trenton, New Jersey, and needs some one to wait upon him, who knows just what to do. I am very sorry to go and leave my company, Dotty, but--\"  \"O, auntie, you ought to go,\" cried Dotty.  \"I dislike particularly not to be polite.\"  \"O, auntie, you will be _'tic'ly_ polite,\" cried little Echo. \"Please let me go, too; I won't make no noise.\"  \"How long do you think you'll have to stay, auntie?\" said Prudy.  \"I cannot tell, dear. These attacks are usually short, and I think quite likely your uncle can come home to-morrow night; but he may not be able till next day.\"  \"How he'll feel if he can't be here to Christmas!\" said Dotty; \"and so much greens and things in the windows!\"  \"Yes; and how we shall both feel to know our little friends are keeping house by themselves!\"  \"Keeping house? O, may we keep house!\" exclaimed Prudy, her eyes suddenly brightening.  \"Why, yes, my child; you may be the lady of the mansion, if that is what you mean, and Horace the lord.\"  \"But may I cook the dinners, and not ask Mrs. Fixfax? Because I really do know a great deal, Aunt Madge. You'd be surprised! I can cook cake, and pie, and biscuit, and three kinds of pudding. Please, this once, let me manage things just as I want to.\"  \"Just as _we_ want, you mean,\" said Dotty. \"I can make gingerbread as well as you can.\"  \"And I shaked a table-cloth once,\" put in the youngest. \"Only I shan't be here if my auntie tookens me off.\"  \"Yes, auntie,\" said Horace; \"let the girls manage. They'll get up queer messes, but 'twill be good fun.\"  \"Do you believe it?\" said auntie, thoughtfully. And there entered her brain, at that moment, a singular scheme, which, to almost any other woman, would have seemed absurd.  \"Poor little souls? Their visit has been a failure. I've a great mind to make an arrangement with Mrs. Fixfax to have them keep house in her room.\" (Mrs. Fixfax was Mrs. Allen's housekeeper.) \"The novelty will amuse them. Of course they will waste flour and sugar, but not very much, probably, and Mrs. Fixfax will be on the watch to see that they don't get too hungry. It will tax her severely, but I can pay her for her trouble. Really, the more I think of it, the more I'm inclined to try it. They say I'm foolishly indulgent to children. Perhaps so; but I do want them happy when they come to my house visiting.\"  \"Have you thinked it all up?\" asked Fly, peeping into her auntie's face; \"I won't 'sturb Uncle 'Gustus.\"  \"Yes, chickie; I've thinked of talking to Mrs. Fixfax about letting you all keep house; that is, if she won't consider it too much trouble.\"  \"Trouble?\" said Prudy; \"why, I should think it would be a real help, auntie. She has so much care, you know. And if I got the meals for us four, the cook could rest, too.\"  Aunt Madge only smiled at this.  There were five servants in all: John, the coachman; Nat, the waiting-man; Mrs. Fixfax, the housekeeper; Rachel Fixfax, the chambermaid; and Patty Diggles, the cook. They were all remarkably faithful, except pretty Rachel, the housekeeper's daughter, who was rather gay and flighty, and had been something of a trial to her mistress.  Aunt Maude went into the kitchen dressed for her journey. Mrs. Fixfax had just returned from market, and was talking with the cook about the dinner.  \"That is a fine plump turkey,\" said Mrs. Allen; \"I wish I were to help eat it; but I came to tell you, Mrs. Fixfax, that Colonel Allen is sick, and I must go to him at once, and leave you with the care of these children.\"  The housekeeper, who was a fat, comfortable-looking woman, twice as large as her mistress, said, \"Indeed, mum!\" hoped Colonel Allen \"wasn't sick to speak of,\" and shook her broad sides with laughter at the idea of taking care of Fly.  \"I'll give up going to church to-morrow, mum; for, light as the child is, I can but feel as if you was sitting a ton's weight on my shoulders. And I promise to keep her alive if"]]]
