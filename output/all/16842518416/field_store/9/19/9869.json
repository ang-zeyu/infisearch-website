Bechele! What names!\"  \"Well,\" said Dick, languidly, as he sat down in a weary fashion: \"one's going to be your boy, and the other mine.  Let's call them `Black Jack' and `Black Dick.'\"  \"But they are brown,\" said his brother.  \"Yes, they are brown certainly,\" said Dick, thoughtfully.  \"Regular coffee colour.  You might call one of them `Coffee.'\"  \"That'll do,\" said Jack, laughing, \"`Coffee!' and shorten it into `Cough.'  I say, Dick, I'll have that name, and I can tell people I've got a bad `Cough.'  But what will you call the other?\"  \"I don't know.  Stop a moment--`Chicory.'\"  \"And shorten it into `chick'.  That will do, Dick; splendid!  Cough and Chick.  Now you two, one of you is to be Cough and the other Chick; do you hear?\"  The Zulu boys nodded and laughed, though, in spite of the pretty good knowledge of the English language which they had picked up from their intercourse with the British settlers, it is doubtful whether they understood the drift.  What they did comprehend, however, was, that they should make friends; and this being settled, there was the old boot.  \"Give me boot, and show you big snake,\" cried Chicory.  \"No, no, give me; show more big snake,\" cried Coffee.  Just then Dinny came up with two old pairs of the lads' boots, which he threw down upon the sandy earth; and reading consent in their young masters' eyes, the Zulu lads pounced upon them with cries of triumph, Coffee obtaining the two rights, and Chicory the two lefts, with which they danced about, flourishing them over their heads with delight.  \"Come here, stupids!\" cried Jack; and after a little contention, the boys being exceedingly unwilling to part as they thought with their prizes, he managed to make them understand that the boots ought to go in pairs; and the exchange having been made, each boy holding on to a boot with one hand till he got a good grip of the other, they proceeded to put them on.  \"Ugh! the haythen bastes,\" said Dinny, with a look of disgust.  \"Think of the likes o' them wearing the young masthers' brogues.  Ah, Masther Dick, dear, ye'll be repinting it one of these days.\"  \"Dinny, you're a regular prophet of evil,\" said Dick, quietly.  \"Avic--prophet of avil!\" cried Dinny.  \"Well, isn't it the truth? Didn't I say avore we left the owld counthry that no good would come of it?  And avore we'd been out here two years didn't the dear misthress-- the saints make her bed in heaven--go and die right away?\"  \"Dinny! how can you!\" cried Jack, angrily, as he saw the tears start into his brother's eyes, and that in spite of the sunburning he turned haggard and pale.  \"Don't take any notice, Dick,\" he whispered, in a tender, loving way, as he laid one arm on his brother's shoulder and drew him aside.  \"Dinny don't mean any harm, Dick, but he has such a long tongue.\"  Dick looked piteously in his brother's face, and one tear stole softly down his cheek.  \"I say, Dick,\" cried Jack, imploringly, \"don't look like that.  It makes me think so of poor mamma.  You look so like her.  I say don't, or you'll make me cry too; and I won't,\" he cried, grinding his teeth.  \"I said I'd never cry again, because it's so childish; and I won't.\"  \"Then I'm childish, Jack,\" said Dick, as he rubbed the tear away with one hand.  \"No, no.  You have been so weak and delicate that you can't help it. I'm strong.  But I say, Dick, you are ever so much stronger than when we came out here.\"  \"Yes,\" said Dick, with a wistful look at his brother's muscular arms. \"I am stronger, but I do get tired so soon, Jack.\"  \"Not so soon as you did, Dick; and father says you'll be a strong man yet.  Hallo! what's the matter?  Look there.\"  The brothers turned round, and hardly knew whether to laugh or to be alarmed; for a short distance away there was Dinny dancing about, waving his arms and shouting, while Coffee and Chicory, each with his kiri, were making attacks and feints, striking at the Irishman fiercely.  \"Ah, would you, ye black baste?\" shouted Dinny, as roaring now with laughter the brothers ran back.  \"Shoo, Shoo! get out, you dirty-coloured spalpeen.  Ah, ye didn't.  Kape off wid you.  An' me widout a bit of shtick in me fist.  Masther Dick, dear!  Masther Jack! it's murthering me the two black Whiteboys are. Kape off!  Ah, would ye again!  Iv I'd me shtick I'd talk to ye both, and see if your heads weren't thick as a Tipperary boy's, I would. Masther Dick!  Masther Jack! they'll murther me avore they've done.\"  As aforesaid, the two Zulu boys had picked up a great deal of the English language, but their understanding thereof was sometimes very obscure.  In this instance they had heard Dinny talking to his young masters in a way that had made the tears come in Dick's eye, and driven him and Jack away.  This, in the estimation of the Zulu boys, must be through some act of cruelty or insult.  They did not like Dinny, who made no attempt to disguise his contempt for them as \"a pair of miserable young haythens,\" but at the same time they almost idolised the twin brothers as their superiors and masters, for whom they were almost ready to lay down their lives.  Here then was a cause for war.  Their nature was to love and fight, as dearly as the wildest Irishman who was ever born.  Dinny had offended their two \"bosses\"--as they called them, after the fashion of the Dutch Boers, and this set their blood on fire.  Hardly had the brothers walked away than, as if moved by the same spirit, they forgot the beauty of the old boots in which they had been parading--to such an extent that they kicked them off, and kiri in hand made so fierce an attack upon unarmed Dinny that, after a show of resistance, he fairly took to his heels and ran back to the house, just as the brothers came up.  \"Popo give him kiri,\" cried Chicory.  \"Bechele de boy make Boss Dinny run,\" cried the other, his eyes sparkling with delight.  \"No make de boss cry eye any more.\"  \"No make Boss Dick cry eye any more,\" repeated Chicory.  The brothers looked at each other as they comprehended the meaning of the attack.  \"Why, Jack,\" said Dick, \"what faithful true fellows they are.  They'll never leave us in a time of trouble.\"  \"No, that they won't,\" cried Jack; and just then a tall, stern, sunburnt man, with grizzled hair and saddened eyes, came up to where they stood. Laying his hand affectionately on the shoulder of Dick,--  \"Come, my boys,\" he said, \"dinner is ready.  Let's be punctual while we are leading a civilised life.\"  \"And afterwards, father, as punctual a life as we can,\" said Dick, smiling.  \"Hurray!\" cried Jack, giving his cap a wave in the air.  \"Only another week, and then, father--\"  \"Yes,\" said Mr Rogers, with a quiet, sad look, \"then, my boy, good-bye to civilisation.\"  \"Only for a time, father,\" said Dick, quietly.  \"Till you win health and strength, my boy,\" said Mr Rogers, with an affectionate glance.  \"And that we'll soon find,\" cried Jack; \"for we are off to the wilds.\"    CHAPTER TWO.  WHY THEY WENT AWAY.  It was about two years before this that Mr Edward Rogers, a gentleman holding a post of importance in the City of London, had purchased some land and come out to dwell in Natal.  For physician after physician had been consulted, seaside and health resort visited, but as the time glided on the verdict of the doctors became more and more apparent as a true saying, that unless Mrs Rogers was taken to a warmer climate her days would be few.  Even if she were removed the doctors said that she could not recover; but still her days might be prolonged.  What was more, they strongly advised such a course in favour of young Richard, who was weak and delicate to a degree.  \"Then you really consider it necessary?\" said Mr Rogers to the great physician who had been called in.  \"I do indeed.  As I have said, it will prolong your wife's days, and most probably it will turn that delicate, sickly boy into a strong man.\"  On being asked further what country he would recommend, he promptly replied,--  \"South Africa.\"  \"Natal is the place,\" he continued.  \"There you have the Drakensberg, and you can choose your own elevation, so as to get a pure, temperate climate, free from the cold of the mountains and the heat of the plains.\"  Mr Rogers was a man of prompt action, for the health of those dear to him was his first consideration.  The consequence was that after rapidly making his arrangements, and providing the necessaries for his new home, he took passage to Durban, arrived there in safety with his wife, two sons, and Dennis; then made his way to Maritzburg; and soon after he had purchased an extensive tract of land, and a pleasantly situated home, with garden in full perfection, the owner of which, having made money in the colony, wished to retire to England.  Here for a time Mrs Rogers had seemed better, and undoubtedly her life was considerably prolonged.  Gardening, farming, and a little hunting formed the occupations of the father and sons, and for a time all was happiness in the sunny far-off home.  Then the much-dreaded day came, and they were left to mourn for a tender wife and mother, whose loss was irreparable.  Richard, who partook greatly of his mother's nature, was, like his father, completely prostrated by the terrible loss; and though time somewhat assuaged his grief, he seemed to have gone back in his health, and lost the way he had made up since he left England, and he had become so weak and delicate that Mr Rogers had consulted the doctor, who from time to time visited their far-off home.  \"Medicine is of no use, my dear sir,\" he said frankly.  \"I can do him no good.  I suppose he sits"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21359"],["title","Off to the Wilds: Being the Adventures of Two Brothers (#2)"],["body","a good deal and mopes?\"  \"Exactly.\"  \"Then look here, my dear sir, give him a thorough change.  You are not tied to your farming in any way?\"  \"Not in the least.\"  \"Then fit up a waggon, take your horses, and have a few months' campaign in the wilds yonder.  You want a change as badly as the boy, and you will both come back, I'll venture to say, doubled in strength.  Why, the ivory and skins you'll collect will pay your expenses.  I wish I had the chance to go.\"  It was settled then, and the waggon was being fitted up with ammunition and stores; horses, guaranteed to be well-salted, had been purchased for Mr Rogers and his boys.  The two young Zulus who had been hanging about the place for months, making little trips with Dick and Jack, were to go; and in addition a couple of trustworthy blacks, experienced as waggon-driver and foreloper, had been engaged; so that in a very few days they would say good-bye to civilisation for months, and go seek for health in the far-off wilds.  The boys were delighted, for Mr Rogers proposed that they should aim for the Zambesi River, and seek some of the seldom-traversed lands, where game abounded, and where the wonders of nature would be opened to them as from an unsealed book.  If Dick and Jack were delighted, the two Zulu boys were half mad with joy.  As soon as they knew that they were to be of the party they seemed to have become frantic, going through the actions of hunting and spearing wild beasts--knocking down birds with their kiris, which they threw with unerring aim--pantomimically fighting lions, one of them roaring and imitating the fierce creature's \"oomph, oomph,\" in a way that sounded terribly real, while the other threatened him with his assegai.  Then they were always showing their cleverness as hunters by stalking people--crawling up to them through the long grass, taking advantage of every irregularity of the ground or shrub to get nearer, and grinning with delight on seeing the surprise and fear of the person stalked.  For it was only during the past year that they had been so much amongst the settlers in Natal.  Their early days had been spent with their tribe in the north, their father being a redoubtable chief; but he had given great offence to the king, and had been compelled to fly for his life, finding refuge amongst the English, with his boys.  Mention has been made of well-salted horses, which to a sailor would immediately suggest commissariat beef in pickle in good-sized tubs; but pray don't imagine that the satisfactory condiment, salt, has anything to do with a salted horse in South Africa.  A salted horse is one that is seasoned to the climate by having passed through the deadly horse sickness, a complaint so bad and peculiar to the land that very few of the horses seized with it recover.  When one does recover he is called a salted--that is, seasoned--horse, and his value is quadrupled.  Mr Rogers had spared no expense in getting together good cattle.  His team of little Zulu oxen were the perfection of health and strength, and far more docile than is generally the case with these animals; though even these, in spite of their good behaviour, were exceedingly fond of tickling each other's ribs with their long horns, and saving the driver trouble, for the pair nearest the waggon would stir up the pair in front of them, and as these could only retaliate on their aggressors with their tails, they took their revenge on the pair in front; these again punished the pair in front; and so on, and on, to the leading oxen, the result of the many applications being a great increase of speed.  Then the horses were excellent.  Mr Rogers had three for his own riding; a big bay, a dark grey, and a soft mouse-coloured chestnut, more famous for speed than beauty, and with a nasty habit of turning round and smiling, as if he meant to bite, when he was mounted.  Dick was clever at names, and he immediately suggested \"Smiler\" as an appropriate name for the chestnut.  The dark grey he called \"Toothpick,\" because of his habit of rubbing his teeth on the sharp points of the fence; while he called the big bony bay the \"Nipper,\" from his being so fond of grazing on, and taking nips from, the manes and tails of his companions, when he could get a chance.  Mr Rogers provided three horses for his own riding, but it was with the idea of giving either of his sons an extra mount when necessary, for it was certain that there would be times when the arch-necked swift little cobs purchased for his boys would want a rest.  It was a stroke of good fortune to get such a pair, and the boys were in ecstasies when they were brought up from Maritzburg, for a handsomer pair of little horses it would have been hard to find.  They were both of that rich dark reddish roan, and wonderfully alike, the differences being in their legs; one being nearly black in this important part of its person, the other having what most purchasers would call the blemish of four white legs--it being a canon amongst the wise in horseflesh that a dark or black-legged horse has better sinews and lasting powers.  In this case, however, the theory was wrong, for white legs was if anything the stronger of the two.  The lads then were delighted, and this became increased when they found the little nags quite ready to make friends, and willing to eat apples, bread, or as much sugar out of their hands as they would give.  \"That's right, my boys,\" said Mr Rogers, who found his sons making friends in this way with the new arrivals; \"always feed your horses yourselves, and treat them well.  Pet them as much as you like, and win their confidence by your kindness.  Never ill-use your horse; one act of ill-treatment and you make him afraid of you, and then perhaps some day, when in an emergency and you want to catch your horse, he may gallop away.  Go on like that, and those cobs will follow you about like dogs. But you must each keep to his own horse.  Which one would you like, Jack?\"  \"Oh! the--\"  Jack stopped, and glanced at his brother, whose face was slightly flushed.  Dick was weak and delicate, while Jack was the perfection of boyish vigour; and feeling that his brother did not enjoy life as he did himself, he stopped short just as he was going to say White Legs, for there was something in the cob's face that he liked, and the little horse had let him stroke its velvet nose.  \"Poor old Dick has taken a fancy to him,\" he said to himself; \"and the other will do just as well for me.\"  \"Let Dick choose first,\" he said aloud.  \"Very well,\" said Mr Rogers.  \"Now then, Dick, which is it to be? though you can't be wrong, my boy, for there is not a pin to choose between them, and they are brothers.\"  \"Should you mind if I chose first, Jack?\" asked Dick.  \"Not a bit,\" said Jack, stoutly, though his feeling of disappointment was keen, for he felt now that he would dearly love to have the white-legged cob.  You may guess then his delight when Dick declared for the black-legged one.  As soon as he heard the decision Jack had his arm over the white-legged cob's neck and had given it a hug, the horse looking at him with its great soft eyes, and uttering a low snort.  \"Up with you then, my boys, and have a canter.\"  \"Without a saddle, father?\" said Dick, nervously.  Jack was already up.  \"Have it saddled if you like, my boy,\" said Mr Rogers, kindly.  But Dick flushed, gave a spring from the ground, and was on the little cob's back.  They were both skilled riders, but Dick's illness made him timorous at times.  He, however, fought hard to master his weakness; and when Jack cried, \"Come on, Dick; let's race to the big tree and back,\" he stuck his knees into the cob's plump sides and away they went, with the wind rushing by their ears, and the cobs keeping neck and neck, rounding the big tree about a mile away on the plain, and then making the dusty earth rise in clouds as they tore back, and were checked with a touch of the bridle by the home field.  \"Why, Dick, my boy, I would not wish to see a better seat on a horse,\" cried Mr Rogers, patting the cobs in turn.  \"Jack, you set up your back like a jockey.  Sit more upright, my boy.\"  \"All right, father; I'll try,\" said Jack, throwing himself right forward so as to hug his cob's neck.  \"But I say, father, isn't he lovely?  I felt all the time as if I was a bit of him, or we were all one.\"  \"You looked like it, my boy,\" said Mr Rogers, smiling in his son's animated face.  \"I wish Dick had your confidence, and you a little more of his style.\"  \"All right, father, we'll try and exchange a bit a-piece,\" laughed Jack. \"But I can't half believe it, father, that these are to be our own horses.\"  \"You may believe it, then,\" said his father.  \"And now get them to the stable.\"  \"Oh, I say, Dick, what beauties!\" cried Jack.  \"What shall you call yours?\"  \"I don't know yet,\" replied his brother.  \"He's very fast.  `Swift' wouldn't be a bad name; and we might call yours `Sure.'\"  \"Hum!  I don't think much of those names.  Hold up!\" he continued, examining the hoofs of his brother's nag.  \"I say, Dick, what fine thick shoes he has got.\"  \"That's a good suggestion,\" said Dick, laughing, and looking brighter than he had seemed for weeks.  \"Let's call him `Shoes,' and his brother with the white legs `Stockings.'\"  \"Shoes and Stockings!\" cried Jack; \"but those are such stupid names.  I don't know though but what they'll do.\"  The question was not discussed, for the lads busied themselves in bedding down their own horses; and for the rest of that, day the stable seemed to be the most important part of the house.    CHAPTER THREE.  PREPARATIONS FOR THE JOURNEY.  \"What is it ye're doing?\" said Dinny, a day or two before that proposed for the start.  Coffee and Chicory looked up from their task, grinned, and then went on sharpening the points of a couple of assegais upon a heavy block of stone, which they had evidently brought from a distance.  Their faces glistened with perspiration; their knees"]]]
