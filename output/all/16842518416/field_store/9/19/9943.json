The hut commanded a view of the river, but it, as well as the sheds, sheep-folds, and stock-yards, were placed far too high above it to be reached by the widest inundation it could cause.  Arthur did not forget his promise to Craven, and, as soon as he was able, he rode toward his hut with several books in his pockets.  The hut-keeper was very grateful, and expressed himself in a way which showed that he was really a gentleman and a man of feeling.  The brothers, as they rode away, agreed that it would be but an act of common kindness to ask him to visit them, and that they might send another man to take his place.  Craven considered a moment.  \"No; I had better not,\" he answered; \"the men about here look upon me as one of themselves, and if I were seen with you, I should no longer be trusted by them.  They are mischievously inclined; and if I can turn them from their purposes, or give you warning of their intentions, and help, if needs be, it will afford me the satisfaction of believing that I have been of some little use in the world.\"  They could not but agree with him, and expressed a hope that an employment more suited to a person of his education might be found for him.  Craven gave a sickly smile.  \"You are young, and think change is easy,\" he said.  \"The sapling is quickly bent, but when an old tree has long grown in the same direction, it cannot be straightened again.  Supply me with books and tobacco, and, a few years hence, perhaps, a pair of spectacles, and I shall have no desire to quit these wilds.\"  \"Perhaps you will change your mind,\" said James, putting out his hand, which the broken-down gentleman shook warmly.  Many years had passed since his palm had pressed that of an equal in intellect and education.  It seemed to raise him out of the state of hopeless apathy into which he had fallen.  The hut at headquarters had greatly improved in appearance since it had become the residence of the Gilpins.  There were three glazed windows, and it was partitioned off into a bedroom, a sitting-room--where books and papers could be arranged on shelves and kept clean--and a kitchen, which served as dining-room and hall.  A good-sized storeroom had been built at the back, with a door opening into the kitchen.  They and Sam Green were the only inmates of the building.  It was late at night, the Bible had been read, and family prayers had been offered up--when two or three were gathered together that custom was never departed from in that rude hut in the wilds of Australia-- thanksgivings for past, petitions for future protection.  Sam had thrown himself on his bed in a corner of the hall, and his loud snoring told that he was fast asleep.  The brothers had been reading in their sitting-room, and were on the point of retiring to bed, when a slight tap was heard at the window.  They thought it was some night bird attracted by the light, and took no notice.  A louder tap was heard; Arthur opened the window.  \"Wisht! mister, dear; just let me in, for I've something to say to ye,\" said a voice, which he recognised to be Larry Killock's.  \"I will let you in by the door, Larry, unless you like to jump through the window,\" said Arthur.  \"The quickest way's the best,\" was the answer, as Larry leaped through the opening, adding, \"shut the shutters, lest any one's eyes should be looking this way.\"  Larry was out of breath, and looked faint and weary, as if he had come a long distance.  \"What brings you here, Larry?\" said Arthur, in a tone of anxiety, which it was natural he should feel.  \"It's bad news I've to tell yer honours; but if I'd had to lose my life, I'd have come to tell it,\" he answered.  \"No matter how I found it out, but I did find it out, that the people on the station, just because you have put a stop to their robberies and rogueries, have determined to do away with you.  As villains is mostly cowards, there's none of them dares to bell the cat themselves, and so they've engaged some of them black fellows--the thieves of the world--to do the job for them.  It was to be done quickly, and I came along, ignorant entirely if I'd be in time or not to save yer honours' lives; but they've not killed you yet, and we'll see if we can't be a match for them.\"  The Irishman went on to say that the plan proposed was to set fire to the surrounding bush, and that while they ran out, as they naturally would, to stop the flames from approaching their dwelling, by cutting down the surrounding grass and bushes, they were to be knocked down with boomerangs by the blacks, and their bodies dragged into the fire.  The brothers immediately decided what to do.  Waking up Sam and telling him what they had heard, they bade Larry take care of the house and make a good supper; and, reaping-hooks and axes in hand, they sailed out to clear the ground of all fuel capable of bringing the flames up to the hut.  Beginning at the back of the building, they worked away energetically, gradually extending their circle till they had cut down and raked away all fuel, almost up to the woods, when they heard Sam's voice calling them--  \"Come back, come back! the black fellows are close upon us!  I wasn't comfortable in my mind, and went out to listen.  I heard them calling to each other, and their dogs barking.\"  Although they believed that the bullock-driver's anxiety or fears might somewhat exaggerate the danger, they felt that it was, at all events, prudent to retreat to their hut.  All remained quiet: they were beginning to hope that the alarm might be a false one.  Arthur again went out, and as, rifle in hand, he was pacing as sentry round the hut, he saw a bright light burst forth above the trees, half a mile or so off to the south-west.  He watched it for some minutes; it increased, extending on either hand, the forked points of the flames appearing high above the intervening trees.  There could be no doubt that the wood was on fire.  Thus far the information obtained by the bullock-driver was correct.  There was too much reason, therefore, to fear that their destruction would be attempted by the savages.  He hurried into the hut to consult what was best to be done.  Their horses were at hand; they might mount them and ride away from the danger; but such a proceeding was not to be thought of.  If, however, they were not secured, they would be carried off by the blacks.  Arthur and Sam accordingly went out and brought them up to the hut; there was just room for them to stand in the kitchen by removing the table; the door was then closed and barred. None of the party, however, felt inclined to wait inactive till the conflagration reached their neighbourhood without knowing what progress it was making.  There was no window at the back of the hut.  \"We will make holes in the roof,\" said Arthur; \"we shall be able to see through them what is going on, and if we are besieged in our fortress by the savages, we shall be the better able to defend ourselves and annoy them.\"  A stool, placed on the top of the table, enabled them to reach the roof, and by stringing some boards to the rafters, they found convenient standing places.  The square holes cut in the shingles forming the roof gave them a look-out.  There was enough in the spectacle they beheld to try the courage of the stoutest hearted.  In front of them, that is to say, at the back of the hut, was a narrow neck of forest, which was as yet intact, but above the branches--between the stems which stood out in bold relief--the flames were seen raging furiously, devouring, as they advanced, everything in their course, both to the right and to the left. Strange sounds, too, were heard: there was the roaring, hissing, and crackling of the fire, and ever and anon a report like that of heavy guns, as some tall tree was riven in two by the intense heat which surrounded it; the air also came like a blast from a furnace, laden with smoke, ashes, and often sparks, which threatened to ignite the dry roof of the building.  The danger was increasing, for the flames were advancing towards the confines of the wood nearest them.  Now the fire, snake-like, would be seen creeping along the grass, then catching hold of some bush, which would speedily be wrapped in its deadly embrace; next the lower boughs of the trees would catch, or the dry wood and twigs round the stumps, and upward it would mount triumphant, roaring and crackling--the slighter trees falling prostrate before it; the older and thicker still withstanding its fierce assault, though left branchless and blackened, with all vitality destroyed.  As yet the hut remained uninjured, though a semicircle of fire raged furiously close to it, and here and there, where a bush still stood, or some tufts of grass had not been closely cropped, the flames made advances, and, winding along the ground, rose up, flickered, and died. From the first outbreak of the conflagration various animals had been seen crossing the open ground, as they escaped from the burning forest. Birds innumerable, of varied plumage, aroused from their roosting places, flew by, some uttering discordant screams of terror, many, with scorched wings, falling dead before they reached the hut.  As yet no human beings had been seen.  \"I trust that the savages will not venture to attack us,\" said James; \"only in the last extremity could I feel justified in firing at them.\"  \"Arrah! it's but little of that sort of treatment they have received since the white man first put his foot on their shores,\" observed Larry. \"I've heard tell of their being shot down by scores"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21464"],["title","The Gilpins and their Fortunes: A Story of Early Days in Australia (#8)"],["body"," a time, like vermin.  Many and many's the black fellow I've seen killed, and no notice taken of it, and no thought by the man who did the deed, any more than if he had fired at a wild beast.\"  Arthur interrupted Larry's remarks by exclaiming, \"There they are, though, and in no small numbers too, just coming round the edge of the burning wood to the south-east!\"  The rest of the party looked in the direction indicated, and there, seen clearly by the light of the flames thrown on their dark bodies, armed with spears, clubs, and boomerangs, was a numerous body of savages. They appeared to be looking cautiously about, as if expecting to find their intended victims engaged in extinguishing the flames round the hut.  \"The black chaps are no cowards, Mr Gilpin.  We shall have a fierce fight of it, and our three firearms won't do much against all them, I'm thinking,\" observed Larry.  \"There are still more of them coming!\" exclaimed Arthur; \"and see! there's a fellow has just joined them who looks like a chief.  They are pointing this way.  We may look out to be attacked in a few minutes.  We may fire surely, James, if they come on?  A few shots will probably send them scampering off.  They have no firearms among them.\"  \"Not so sure of that, yer honour,\" said Larry.  \"Look, the fellow you called the chief has a gun of some sort, and he is showing it to the rest to encourage them.  He handles it like a man who knows the use of it, too.\"  In spite of the overwhelming numbers of the enemy, the little garrison resolved to maintain their position.  Little could be gained by flight, and all their property would inevitably be destroyed should they desert the hut.  The risk they ran in either case was very great.  They might pick off some of the savages, but there were so many that they might easily surround the hut and burn it to the ground.  \"If we had two or three more fellows with us, we might bid defiance to the whole mob,\" said Arthur.  \"To my mind, if we was to shoot down that chap with the gun in his hand, the rest would show us their heels,\" observed Sam Green, who had not before spoken since the appearance of the savages; \"they none on 'em shows much stomach for the fight.\"  Sam's remark was correct.  The savages were evidently aware that the defenders of the hut possessed firearms, and even the chief showed no inclination to expose himself.  From their movements, however, it appeared that they were about to make a rush towards the hut.  At that instant the tramp of horses' hoofs was heard approaching, and a voice cried out--  \"Open the door!  Be quick!  Let us in!\"  James and his brother, who had been watching the savages from the roof, jumped down at the moment that a rifle-ball whistled by.  \"That bullet was never fired by a black chap,\" said Larry to Sam, as they also descended from their perches to receive the new-comers.  The Gilpins, without hesitation, opened the door, and Craven with a stranger appeared, just dismounting from their horses, whose foam-covered bits and reeking backs showed that they had ridden at no slow rate.  \"No time for words.  If you have room for our poor brutes, take them in; if not, they must run their chance outside,\" he said.  \"Here, we have brought arms and ammunition.  We knew that you would be hard pressed, and have come to share your fate.\"  \"Come in, come in,\" said James, leading in the horses, who, trembling with fatigue, were quiet enough.  The new-comers had brought a rifle, a musket, and two fowling-pieces, with powder-flasks and bullets.  This reinforcement raised the confidence of the little party in the hut.  The blacks, discovering Craven and his companion, made a rush to intercept them.  They sprang in after the horses; but before the door was closed, a shower of darts and boomerangs rattled against it, and again a shot was heard, and a bullet flew by among them.  Those inside hurriedly closed the door; but, almost before the bar could be replaced, the blacks were thundering with their clubs against it.  James had been strongly averse to shed blood, even the blood of savages endeavouring to destroy him and his companions, yet there was no longer any other alternative; the blacks must be driven off, or they would burn down the hut.  It became James's duty to take the command, and to give the word.  Loop-holes were speedily cut in the walls.  \"Be ready, friends; pick off the leaders, each of us those more immediately in front as we stand.  Do not throw a shot away.  Fire!\"  Three of the blacks were seen to fall to the ground, the rest ran back in disorder, two of them wounded.  This gave the defenders of the hut time to reload and to make some fresh loop-holes.  The blacks were again met by the chief, who was seen urging them to return, though he showed no inclination to place himself in danger.  Craven, seeing the look-out places in the roof, proposed getting up there.  \"I think that I might bring down that fellow if I could get a steady shot at him,\" he said, taking up his rifle.  \"The fellow has disappeared!\" he exclaimed.  \"I cannot make it out, yet the rest obey him, for they are coming on again, and with fire-brands, too.  We must beat them, or they will roast us.\"  The spectacle was indeed appalling.  There were from fifty to sixty blacks, each with a burning brand in his left hand and a spear or club in the other, all leaping and shrieking in concert, as they sprang on towards the hut.  The defenders waited till they got within thirty paces, and then all together fired.  The result was the same as before. Several fell, others ran howling back wounded, the rest, throwing down their brands, followed.  Another volley was sent after them, in the hope that it might induce them to abandon the attack.  Craven reloaded, and sat watching at his post.  The crack of his rifle was again heard.  \"I have hit the scoundrel!\" he exclaimed.  \"He is no black man; he is ordering them to lift him up; they are carrying him off.  I have not the heart to send another bullet through him, but he deserves it.\"  \"We may capture him, though,\" cried Arthur.  \"Let us jump on our horses; we shall soon overtake them.\"  The proposal was instantly adopted; no one was more eager and full of animation than Craven.  The horses were led out, and, Larry remaining with the spare firearms in the hut, the party urged on the animals in the direction the blacks had gone.  The flames of the burning forest lighted up the country, and enabled them to ride at full speed, though it was with difficulty they could make the horses keep near the fire, edging along which the blacks had gone, hoping probably, if they could get round the furthest end, to place it between themselves and those they had so ruthlessly attacked.  Mounting to the top of a ridge, the horsemen caught sight of a party of natives on a hill before them, with a valley intervening.  The blacks got to the top, on some open ground, when it was seen that they were carrying a burden among them.  The white men dashed down into the valley, and, making their way across it, urged their horses up the opposite height.  The blacks saw them coming; in vain the man they were carrying ordered them to remain by him.  Oaths, entreaties, promises were of no avail.  Putting him down, they ran off as fast as their legs would carry them.  The last exclamations he uttered showed his pursuers that he was no native.  They were in English, and too horrible to be repeated.  The Gilpins reached him.  He glared fiercely at them as they dismounted, and seemed to be feeling for a pistol in his belt.  They grasped his hands to prevent his using it.  The oath he uttered betrayed him.  Though his face and arms and the upper part of his body was blackened, they at once recognised him as Basham, the late overseer.  The wretched blacks had already suffered so severely that the settlers had no desire to overtake them.  Dismounting, therefore, one of the party led the horses, and the rest, lifting up the wounded man, bore him back towards the hut.  They frequently looked behind to ascertain if the blacks were following for the purpose of recovering him, but no attempt of the sort was made.  It was hard work carrying him, for he was a heavy man.  Some deep groans which burst from him showed that he was suffering much pain.  From a feeling of mercy they stopped, and found that the bullet had entered his leg, and had probably grazed, if it had not broken, the bone.  Craven had a knowledge of surgery, especially valuable to a bushman; and while all were stooping down round the injured man, he probed the wound, and extracted some of the black cloth which had been carried into it.  Had Basham been a friend who had been fighting for them, he could not have been treated more tenderly.  He, however, scarcely spoke, and displayed no sign of gratitude.  At length they reached the hut in safety.  The horses were tethered outside, ready for instant service.  The wounded man was placed on Sam's bed, and such restoratives as the brothers possessed administered to him.  These arrangements concluded, the whole party thankfully sat down to a meal, which was rather breakfast than supper.  The Gilpins now learned from Craven that he had heard a rumour of the proposed attack of the savages, instigated by the stockmen, though he did not understand that Basham was the prime mover; that there was only one man whom he could trust, and that, having invited him, they had both set forward to their assistance.  His companion was evidently, like himself, a man of superior education and fallen fortunes.  In Craven the necessity for unusual exertion had worked a marked change, and he no longer appeared the spirit-broken man he had seemed when Arthur first met him.  The fire continued raging, but made no further progress, and, in spite of its dangerous neighbourhood, all the party except James, who insisted on remaining on watch, were fast asleep.  The hours of darkness passed by slowly and anxiously.  He kept"]]]
