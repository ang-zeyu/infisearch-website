Which bird takes the lead in building? What does the other bird do? Does he ever carry material, or does he simply act as escort? Does he ever protect his mate from other birds?  Write this out, carefully drawing your conclusions from your own observations. After the young birds have left the nest and have no further use for it, you may take the nest and examine it closely. You will find that while there is a similarity in the nests of the same kind of birds, they differ considerably in the materials of which they are composed. For example, the typical robin's nest consists of straws and hairs plastered together with mud and lined with some soft material, but others have been found made entirely of raveled rope; others of carpet rags. The bird evidently is not guided in this matter by blind instinct, but uses its reason in adapting materials that are at hand.  If you are fortunate you may find a pair of orioles building their nest. Place some bright-colored yarn or string in pieces of convenient length where the birds will see them. Some of them are almost sure to be woven into the nest. The oriole's nest may be attached to a limb by two or more cords; if it is, notice how it is prevented from swinging by side ropes. You will find it guyed against the prevailing winds. The oriole frequently ties several twigs together, and so uses these to suspend his nest. Notice the nest pouch; those built near houses are quite shallow; those near forests are much deeper. Can you tell why?  _The wings of birds._--Describe the different kinds, as short and round, or long and slender, and the effect of the wing-shape upon the bird's motion in the air. Describe the flights of different birds.  _Songs of birds._--Write the syllables which seem to you to express the different songs of birds. Notice the different songs of the same bird. A song sparrow was observed to have twelve different songs. He sang each one several times over, as if each song had a number of verses. Then changing his position, he would sing another. To most ears the robin's song is always the same, but close attention discovers that there are variations. Many birds are genuine musicians and compose as they sing, not having formal songs.  _Free description of birds._--Write description of some bird of your acquaintance, noting the following:--  _Its appearance._--Color, gait, flight, size from tip of beak to end of tail, spread of wings.  _Its common name._--Why given?  _Time of arrival and departure._  _Character._--Is it trustful, or shy and retiring?  _Song._--Season when song is most frequent, also times of day. Does it consist of many or only a few notes? Is it cheery, like the robin's, or tuneful, like the thrush's, or rollicking and rapturous, like the bobolink's, or a Romanza, like the catbird's? Notice the different emotion sounds, the notes of fear, of parental or conjugal reprimand, of joy, of anger, of deep sorrow, made by the bird at times.  _Food._--Insects (kinds), seeds, fruit, etc.  _Nest._--Where placed, how made?  _Incidents._--From the writer's knowledge of the bird.  _This bird in literature._--What writers have described, what poets have immortalized him? How did they characterize him?  Some of the following books are almost indispensable to one who wishes to know the birds:--  \"Wake Robin,\" John Burroughs; \"Birds and Poets,\" John Burroughs; \"The Birds and Seasons of New England,\" Wilson Flagg; \"Upland and Meadow,\" Charles C. Abbott; \"Bird Ways,\" Olive Thorne Miller; \"Birds through an Opera Glass,\" Florence A. Merriam; \"Birds in the Bush,\" Bradford Torrey; \"The Birds About Us,\" Charles C. Abbott; \"From Blomidon to Smoky,\" Frank Bolles.  Recent magazines should be searched and the current ones scrutinized for articles by any of the above-named writers.  _Destruction of birds._--Find out how many birds are annually slaughtered in the United States, and for what purposes.  In the report of the American Ornithologist Union published in 1886, it was estimated that about five million birds were annually required to fill the demand for the ornamentation of the hats of the American women. In 1896 it was estimated that the number thus used was ten million. \"The slaughter is not confined to song-birds; everything that wears feathers is a target for the bird butcher. The destruction of 40,000 terns in a single season on Cape Cod, a million rail and reed birds (bobolinks) killed in a single month near Philadelphia, are facts that may well furnish food for reflection. The swamps and marshes of Florida are well known to have become depopulated of their egrets and herons, while the state at large has been for years a favorite slaughter ground of the milliners' emissaries.\" An article in _Forest and Stream_, speaking of the destruction of birds on Long Island, states that during a short period of four months 20,000 were supplied to the New York dealers from a single village.  The Audubon Society of Massachusetts has looked up the figures and reports that \"it is proved that into England alone between 25,000,000 and 30,000,000 birds are imported yearly, and that for Europe the number reaches 150,000,000. Hence, the fashionable craze has annually demanded between 200,000,000 and 300,000,000 birds. From the East Indies alone a dealer in London received 400,000 humming birds, 6,000 birds of paradise, and 400,000 miscellaneous birds. In an auction room, also in London, within four months, over 800,000 East and West Indian and Brazilian bird skins, besides thousands of pheasants and birds of paradise, were put up for sale.\"  This demand for birds has been going on for a quarter of a century, and billions of rich-plumaged creatures have been slaughtered to meet it, and several of the feathered tribes have been exterminated.  Write to the following for literature upon the destruction of birds:--  Humane Education Committee, 61 Westminster Street, Providence, R. I.; George T. Angell, Boston, Mass.; Secretary of the Massachusetts Audubon Society, Boston, Mass.; Secretary of the New York Audubon Society at New York; Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C.; Secretary of the Audubon Society of Pennsylvania at Philadelphia; also write to the Department of Agriculture of your own state.     VII  PROGRAMS FOR BIRD DAY   A Bird Day exercise, in order to have much value educationally, should be largely the result of the pupils' previous work, and should not be the mere repetition of a prepared program taken verbatim from some paper or leaflet. It is, of course, better to have the pupils recite this leaflet or list of statements than it would be to have it ground out of a phonograph. The program should be prepared by the pupils under direction of the teacher.  The following general suggestions are offered:--  1. For the first observance of this day by a school it would be well to have some pupil read Senator Hoar's petition of the birds to the Legislature of Massachusetts.  PETITION OF THE BIRDS  _Written by Senator Hoar to the Massachusetts Legislature_  The petition which was instrumental in getting the Massachusetts law passed, prohibiting the wearing of song and insectivorous birds on women's hats, was written by Senator Hoar. The petition read as follows:--       To the Great and General Court of the Commonwealth of      Massachusetts: We, the song birds of Massachusetts and their      playfellows, make this our humble petition. We know more      about you than you think we do. We know how good you are. We      have hopped about the roofs and looked in at your windows of      the houses you have built for poor and sick and hungry      people, and little lame and deaf and blind children. We have      built our nests in the trees and sung many a song as we flew      about the gardens and parks you have made so beautiful for      your children, especially your poor children to play in.      Every year we fly a great way over the country, keeping all      the time where the sun is bright and warm. And we know that      whenever you do anything the other people all over this      great land between the seas and the Great Lakes find it out,      and pretty soon will try to do the same. We know. We know.       We are Americans just the same as you are. Some of us, like      you, came across the great sea. But most of the birds like      us have lived here a long while; and the birds like us      welcomed your fathers when they came here many, many years      ago. Our fathers and mothers have always done their best to      please your fathers and mothers.       Now we have a sad story to tell you. Thoughtless or bad      people are trying to destroy us. They kill us because our      feathers are beautiful. Even pretty and sweet girls, who we      should think would be our best friends, kill our brothers      and children so that they may wear our plumage on their      hats. Sometimes people kill us for mere wantonness. Cruel      boys destroy our nests and steal our eggs and our young      ones. People with guns and snares lie in wait to kill us; as      if the place for a bird were not in the sky, alive, but in a      shop window or in a glass case. If this goes on much longer      all our song birds will be gone. Already we are told in some      other countries that used to be full of birds, they are now      almost gone. Even the nightingales are being killed in      Italy.       Now we humbly pray that you will stop all this and will save      us from this sad fate. You have already made a law that no      one shall kill a harmless song bird or destroy our nests or      our eggs. Will you please make another one that no one shall      wear our feathers, so that no one shall kill us to get them?      We want them all ourselves. Your pretty girls are pretty      enough without them. We are told that it is as easy for you      to do it as for a blackbird to whistle.       If you will, we"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21266"],["title","Bird Day; How to prepare for it (#7)"],["body"," how to pay you a hundred times over. We      will teach your children to keep themselves clean and neat.      We will show them how to live together in peace and love and      to agree as we do in our nests. We will build pretty houses      which you will like to see. We will play about your garden      and flower beds--ourselves like flowers on wings, without      any cost to you. We will destroy the wicked insects and      worms that spoil your cherries and currants and plums and      apples and roses. We will give you our best songs, and make      the spring more beautiful and the summer sweeter to you.      Every June morning when you go out into the field, oriole      and bluebird and blackbird and bobolink will fly after you      and make the day more delightful to you. And when you go      home tired after sundown, vesper sparrow will tell you how      grateful we are. When you sit down on your porch after dark,      fifebird and hermit thrush and wood thrush will sing to you;      and even whip-poor-will will cheer you up a little. We know      where we are safe. In a little while all the birds will come      to live in Massachusetts again, and everybody who loves      music will like to make a summer home with you.  The signers are:--  Brown Thrasher, Robert o' Lincoln, Hermit Thrush, Vesper Sparrow, Robin Redbreast, Song Sparrow, Scarlet Tanager, Summer Redbird, Blue Heron, Humming Bird, Yellowbird, Whip-poor-will, Water Wagtail, Woodpecker, Pigeon Woodpecker, Indigo Bird, Yellowthroat, Wilson's Thrush, Chickadee, Kingbird, Swallow, Cedar Bird, Cowbird, Martin, Veery, Chewink, Vireo, Oriole, Blackbird, Fifebird, Wren, Linnet, Pewee, Phoebe, Yoke Bird, Lark, Sandpiper.  It should be noted that the result of this petition was the passage of a law by the Legislature of Massachusetts forbidding the wearing of parts of wild birds. A bill forbidding the transportation of feathers or the skins of birds from one state to another was also introduced by Senator Hoar in the United States Senate.  2. At this first exercise it would be well to have read \"Our New Neighbors at Ponkapog,\" by T. B. Aldrich.  3. The best essays that have been written by the pupils during their preliminary study may be given. If the school has not made this preliminary study, select subjects and have essays written according to the directions already given, allowing as much time as possible for original observations.  4. Have recitations from the poets. These will add a peculiar charm to the occasion. A short list of suitable poems will be given. Many others may be found in a book called \"Voices of the Speechless,\" published by Houghton, Mifflin & Co.  The works of John Burroughs, Bradford Torrey, Maurice Thompson, Mrs. Olive Thorne Miller, and Dr. C. C. Abbott abound in passages which are excellent for recitation. It is surprising how familiar the best-known novelists have been and are with birds. In appreciation of them they are second only to the poets. Charles Reade's description of the lark's song in the mines of Australia, in \"Never Too Late to Mend,\" is an inspiring recitation.  5. Short quotations from well known authors should be given, if possible, by every pupil in the school. We give a few taken almost at random:--       Away over the hayfield the lark floated in the blue, making      the air quiver with his singing; the robin, perched on a      fence, looked at us saucily and piped a few notes by way of      remark; the blackbird was heard, flute-throated, down in the      hollow recesses of the wood; and the thrush, in a holly tree      by the wayside, sang out his sweet, clear song that seemed      to rise in strength as the wind awoke a sudden rustling      through the long woods of birch and oak.--WILLIAM BLACK, in      _Adventures of a Phaeton_.       We seemed to hear all the sounds within a great compass--in      the hedges and in the roadside trees, far away in woods or      hidden up in the level grayness of the clouds: twi, twi,      trrrr-weet!--droom, droom, phloee!--tuck, tuck, tuck, tuck,      feer!--that was the silvery chorus from thousands of      throats. It seemed to us that all the fields and hedges had      but one voice, and that it was clear and sweet and      piercing.--WILLIAM BLACK, _Ibid._       Silvia could hear the twittering of the young starlings in      their nests as their parents went and came carrying food,      and the loud and joyful \"tirr-a-wee, tirr-a-wee, prooit,      tweet!\" of the thrushes, and the low currooing of the wood      pigeon, and the soft call of the cuckoo, that seemed to come      in whenever an interval of silence fitted. The swallows      dipped and flashed and circled over the bosom of the lake.      There were blackbirds eagerly but cautiously at work, with      their spasmodic trippings, on the lawn. A robin perched on      the iron railing eyed her curiously and seemed more disposed      to approach than to retreat.--WILLIAM BLACK, in _Green      Pastures and Piccadilly_.       A jay fled screaming through the wood, just one brief      glimpse of brilliant blue being visible.--WILLIAM BLACK,      _Ibid._       And as they came near to one dark patch of shrubbery, lo!      the strange silence was burst asunder by the rich, full song      of a nightingale.--WILLIAM BLACK, _Ibid._       A sudden sound sprang into the night, flooding all its      darkness with its rich and piercing melody--a joyous, clear,      full-throated note, deep-gurgling now, and again rising with      thrills and tremors into bursts of far-reaching silver song      that seemed to shake the hollow air. A single nightingale      had filled the woods with life. We cared no more for those      distant and silent stars. It was enough to sit here in the      gracious quiet and listen to the eager tremulous outpouring      of this honeyed sound.--WILLIAM BLACK, in _Strange      Adventures of a House-Boat_.       Shoot and eat my birds! The next step beyond, and one would      hanker after Jenny Lind or Miss Kellogg.--HENRY WARD      BEECHER.       There on the very topmost twig, that rises and falls with      willowy motion, sits that ridiculous, sweet-singing      bobolink, singing as a Roman candle fizzes, showers of      sparkling notes.--_Ibid._  This poet affirms that our bobolink is superior to the nightingale:--      Bobolink, that in the meadow,     Or beneath the orchard's shadow,     Keepest up a constant rattle     Joyous as my children's prattle,     Welcome to the North again,     Welcome to mine ear thy strain,     Welcome to mine eye the sight     Of thy buff, thy black and white.     Brighter plumes may greet the sun     By the banks of Amazon;     Sweeter tones may weave the spell     Of enchanting Philomel;     But the tropic bird would fail,     And the English nightingale,     If we should compare their worth     With thine endless, gushing mirth.  --THOMAS HILL.       The mocking bird is a singer that has suffered much from its      powers of mimicry. On ordinary occasions, and especially in      the daytime, it insists on playing the harlequin. But when      free in its own favorite haunts at night, it has a song, or      rather songs, which are not only purely original, but are      also more beautiful than any other bird music whatsoever.      Once I listened to a mocking bird singing the livelong      spring night, under the full moon, in a magnolia tree; and I      do not think I shall ever forget its song.       The great tree was bathed in a flood of shining silver; I      could see each twig, and mark every action of the singer,      who was pouring forth such a rapture of ringing melody as I      have never listened to before or since. Sometimes he would      perch motionless for many minutes, his body quivering and      thrilling with the outpour of music. Then he would drop      softly from twig to twig till the lowest limb was reached,      when he would rise, fluttering and leaping through the      branches, his song never ceasing for an instant until he      reached the summit of the tree and launched into the warm      scent-laden air, floating in spirals, with outspread wings,      until, as if spent, he sank gently back into the tree and      down through the branches, while his song rose into an      ecstasy of ardor and passion. His voice rang like a      clarionet in rich, full tones, and his execution covered the      widest possible compass; theme followed theme, a torrent of      music, a swelling tide of harmony, in which scarcely any two      bars were alike. I stayed till midnight listening to him; he      was singing when I went to sleep; he was still singing when      I woke a couple of hours later; he sang through the livelong      night.--THEODORE ROOSEVELT.       Amid the thunders of Sinai God uttered the rights of cattle,      and said that they should have a Sabbath. \"Thou shalt not do      any work, thou, nor thy cattle.\" He declared with infinite      emphasis that the ox on the threshing-floor should have the      privilege of eating some of the grain as he trod it out, and      muzzling was forbidden. If young birds were taken from the      nest for food, the despoiler's life depended on the mother      going free. God would not let the mother-bird suffer in one      day the loss of her young and her own liberty. And he who      regarded in olden time the conduct of man toward the brutes,      to-day looks down from heaven and is interested in every      minnow that swims the stream, and every rook that cleaves      the air.--DEWITT TALMAGE, D.D.       And how refreshing is the sight of the birdless bonnet! The      face beneath, no matter how plain it may be, seems to      possess a gentle charm. She might have had birds, this      woman, for they are cheap enough and plentiful enough,      heaven knows; but she has them not, therefore she must wear      within things infinitely precious, namely, good sense, good      taste, good feeling.
