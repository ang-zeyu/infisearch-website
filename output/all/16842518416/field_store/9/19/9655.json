I never saw any better trick animals.\"  Tip and Top had quieted down now, as had the other animals after Bob had come in to get the pigeons.  \"You'd better keep all of Uncle Toby's pets,\" she concluded. \"I'm going now. Just pull the door shut after you and it will lock. The water is turned off and the house is all cleaned out. There isn't any food to spoil, except what the animals need, and you can take that with you. Uncle Toby said I was to go as soon as you arrived to have charge of his collection, and, as you are here, I'm going. Uncle Toby has hired a man to look after the house so it will be all right. Go and get your pigeons, Bob,\" she added. \"Good-bye, everybody,\" and away she went.  For a moment Mr. and Mrs. Martin looked at each other. Then Mr. Nip, the parrot, broke the silence by saying:  \"I'm a crack-crack-cracker!\"  \"You're a fire-cracker--at least your feathers are red enough for that,\" laughed Mrs. Martin. \"Well, we seem to have the pets whether we want them or not,\" she told her husband. \"We can't go away and leave them here. We can't stay in this house, and try to sell them, if the water is turned off and there is nothing to eat. I guess we'll have to take the pets home with us, Dick.\"  Mr. Martin looked puzzled.  \"Oh, yes! Please keep them!\" begged Ted and Janet.  \"An' det a han'-ordan fo' de monkey!\" begged Trouble, speaking rather more in baby fashion than he usually talked, because he was so excited, I suppose.  \"At least we'll have to take charge of Uncle Toby's pets until we decide what to do,\" said Mr. Martin, after a while. \"We might keep some of them and sell the others.\"  \"Oh, keep them _all_!\" exclaimed Ted.  \"We'll see,\" his father answered, and from the tone of his voice Ted and his sister were almost sure they would be allowed to have all the animals for their very own. Of course Trouble could hardly expect a hand-organ to go with Jack, the monkey, but that was not much of a loss.  \"We can't get back home to-night,\" said Mrs. Martin, \"that's sure. It's too far. We'll have to stay either here, at Uncle Toby's house, or at a hotel.\"  \"I suppose we could stay here, if we had to,\" her husband remarked. \"I can turn the water on, and it is easy enough to get something to eat, even if we have to buy it at the delicatessen shop.\"  \"I just love delicatessen stuff, don't you?\" whispered Jan to her brother. \"I hope they get a lot! I'll give some to Snuff, the Persian cat.\"  \"If we stay it will be just like camping,\" agreed Ted.  While Mr. and Mrs. Martin were considering what to do, Bob, the boy who had come for the pigeons, put his head in through the doorway and called out:  \"I got 'em all, thank you! I'm going now. I hope you have good luck with Uncle Toby's pets!\"  \"Goodness knows we'll need it,\" said Mrs. Martin, and then she had to laugh. The whole affair seemed to her to be so very funny. Neither she nor her husband had imagined that Uncle Toby's \"collection\" could be anything like this--dogs, a parrot, a monkey, a Persian cat and a little alligator, not forgetting the white rats and mice.  \"Well, we'd better stay here for the night,\" finally decided Daddy Martin. \"It is warm, and Uncle Toby had quite a number of beds. The house is in good order. I'll turn on the water, and you and the children might go to the store and get things for supper,\" he added. \"It will soon be night.\"  \"Oh, what fun! We're going to stay here!\" cried Janet, dancing around the Persian cat, who was trying to rub against her legs.  \"And I'll teach Tip and Top some new tricks, so we can have a circus when we get home,\" remarked Ted.  \"There's circus enough here,\" his father said, with a smile. \"But trot along, Curlytops, if you are going to get something for us to eat. The animals have been fed and now it is time for us. I'm getting hungry.\"  \"Me hundry, too!\" declared Trouble.  \"We mustn't let that happen!\" laughed his mother. \"We'll go to the store. Come along, Curlytops!\"  As the children walked down the street with their mother to look for the nearest delicatessen store, they saw the boy Bob carefully wheeling his basket of pigeons toward his own home. He had gotten the birds out of Uncle Toby's barn.  When Mrs. Martin and the Curlytops, with Trouble, of course, came back to Uncle Toby's house, they found Daddy Martin sitting in front of the kitchen stove in which he had kindled a fire. In his lap was the Persian cat, purring contentedly, and Mr. Martin was rubbing the long, soft silky fur of Snuff.  In front of the father of the Curlytops were Skyrocket, Tip, and Top, the three dogs. They were lying asleep near the fire. In the other room were the mice, the rats, the alligator, the monkey, and the parrot, all the animals quiet, for a wonder, as Mrs. Martin said.  \"Oh, Daddy! you love 'em, don't you?\" exclaimed Jan, as she saw her father surrounded by some of the pets. \"We may keep them, mayn't we?\"  \"I'll see about it,\" was the answer, and Janet whispered to Teddy that she was almost sure this meant \"yes.\"  It did not take long to get up a little supper. Daddy Martin ran the automobile into the side yard of Uncle Toby's house, and the Curlytop family, as I sometimes call them, prepared to stay all night. There were plenty of beds, and in the morning they could turn off the water again, take the pets away, close the house, and everything would be as Uncle Toby wished it.  You can easily guess that neither of the Curlytops, nor Trouble, for that matter, wanted to go to bed early that night. The children were thinking too much of the pets. And, indeed, the pets seemed to like the children. Mr. Nip, the parrot, let Jan scratch his head, a form of caress of which he seemed very fond. Jack, the monkey, no longer snatched off Trouble's cap. But perhaps that was because baby William did not wear it near the lively chap. Snuff, the Persian cat, seemed to have taken a great liking to Mr. Martin, and as for the dogs, Tip and Top, they were hardly out of the sight of Jan and Ted. Nor was Skyrocket neglected or jealous. He entered into the fun of playing around on the lawn and porch with the white poodles after supper.  Even Slider, the little alligator, seemed very friendly. He took bits of meat from the fingers of Ted, though Janet said she was afraid of the scaly creature.  \"I'm going to teach him some tricks, so he can be in the animal circus,\" declared Ted.  \"Are you going to have a circus?\" asked his sister.  \"Sure!\" he answered, though, to tell the truth, he had not begun to think of it until he saw all the pets Uncle Toby had left. \"We'll have a fine circus!\"  The evening passed pleasantly. Finally Trouble became sleepy, even though he was much interested in watching Jack, the monkey, crack peanuts.  \"Come, laddie, you must go to bed!\" called Mrs. Martin. \"Mr. Nip, the parrot, has gone to sleep long ago, with his head under his wing, poor thing!\" and she sang part of the \"Robin Song.\"  \"Me want see head's under swing,\" murmured Trouble. \"Me see!\"  \"Oh, no! I don't want to wake up Mr. Nip. He has a cloth over his cage to keep him quiet,\" and Mrs. Martin carried Trouble over to where the parrot's cage had been covered with a table-cover for the night.  \"Goo'-bye,\" murmured the little fellow sleepily, and then he was carried up to his bed in Uncle Toby's house.  A little later Ted and Janet also went to their rooms, having given farewell pats and rubs to the dogs and cat. Mr. Martin went about, seeing that the house was locked up, and then he and his wife sat downstairs, talking while the children were asleep.  \"Do you really intend to take all those pets home with us?\" asked Mrs. Martin.  \"I don't see what else we can do,\" her husband replied. \"The children will be disappointed if we don't. And I don't really want to sell them. Uncle Toby might not like it. I think I'll take them home with us, and write to him, if I can get his address. He must have left it, even if he is going to live in South America.\"  \"But how can we take home a monkey, a parrot, three dogs, a cat, an alligator and some rats and some white mice?\" asked the mother of the Curlytops.  \"Oh, there is plenty of room in the auto,\" her husband answered. \"We'll load it up in the morning.\"  The night passed quietly enough, except that about twelve o'clock the parrot suddenly began shrieking:  \"Police! Police! Burglars! Police! I'm a crack-crack-cracker!\"  \"Dick! Dick! Wake up!\" called Mrs. Martin. \"Someone is at the front door!\"  \"Police! Police!\" chattered the parrot again.  And, surely enough, it was the police, though how the red and green bird knew it is more than I can say. A passing policeman, seeing the light in Uncle Toby's house, and having been told by Mrs. Watson, the housekeeper, on her way to her sister's, that the place was to be closed, had stopped to inquire.  \"I thought it was burglars,\" said the policeman, after Daddy Martin had gone down to the front door and explained.  \"That's what Mr. Nip did, too, I guess,\" said Mr. Martin.  \"Who's Mr. Nip?\" asked the officer.  \"The parrot,\" said the father of the Curlytops. \"He awakened us by his shrieking.\"  After the policeman had gone, the house became quiet again, and nothing more happened until morning. After breakfast the water was turned off, and the home of Uncle Toby was made ready for closing up until the old gentleman should return.  The parrot's cage, the box for the monkey, the little tank of water and pebbles in which Slider lived, and the wire cage of the white mice and rats--all these were taken out to the automobile. It was a large one, and there was plenty of room for the Curlytops and their new pets.  \"Take Snuff, the cat, in between you and Trouble, Janet,\" her father advised. \"Tip and Top can snuggle down with Skyrocket on the floor near Ted. Are we all ready now?\"  \"As ready as we ever shall be,\" his wife answered. \"My, what a queer load!\" she said, with a laugh, as she looked back"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21049"],["title","The Curlytops and Their Pets; Or, Uncle Toby's Strange Collection (#8)"],["body","the collection and the children. \"People will think we're a traveling menagerie!\"  This, however, did not worry the Curlytops. They liked it, and, a little later, they were on their way back toward Cresco. The Curlytops liked their new pets, and they also loved those they had had for a longer time--Skyrocket and Turnover.  \"We'll try to get home early,\" said Mr. Martin to his wife, as he steered the automobile through the streets of Pocono. \"We'll have to fix up a place for these pets.\"  \"Yes,\" agreed his wife. \"They are going to be quite a care. But the children will love them.\"  They stopped for lunch at a little restaurant, and the children were afraid lest some of their pets might escape while the meal was being served. But Mr. Martin saw a young man, sitting in front of a barber shop next to the restaurant, and said to him:  \"Will you watch may automobile and the animals while we are in the dining room? I'll give you fifty cents.\"  \"I'll be glad to do it,\" said the young man.  So long as he was on guard the Curlytops were satisfied. But when they came out they made a sad discovery. Ted jumped up on the running-board and looked down into the automobile to make sure all the pets were safe. The alligator, the parrot, the white mice and rats, the cat, the monkey, and two dogs were there. But there was no sign of Tip, the white poodle with a black spot on the end of his tail.  \"Where is Tip? Oh, where is Tip?\" cried Ted. \"He's gone!\"     CHAPTER VII  A FUZZY BURGLAR   \"What's that?\" asked Mr. Martin, who was the last of the Curlytop family to come out of the restaurant. \"Who is gone? One of the pets?\"  \"Tip is gone,\" answered Teddy. \"Oh, where is he?\"  \"Maybe he's hiding back of the monkey's cage,\" suggested Janet, for Jack, the pet monkey, lived in a sort of cage, or box, and he had been moved from Uncle Toby's house in it.  \"No, Tip isn't here at all,\" said Teddy. \"Top is here and Skyrocket, but Tip is gone.\"  \"That can't be,\" said the young man who had said he would guard the animals while the Curlytops ate. \"I've been here all the while, and I didn't see even one of the white mice get away.\"  He seemed to be a nice, good-natured young man, and appeared to be as much surprised as Teddy and Janet were over the loss of Tip. As for Trouble, he was not worrying much. He had climbed into the front seat of the automobile, and was playing with Snuff, the yellow Persian cat. As long as Trouble had some animal near him he did not worry much about anything else.  \"Have you been right here all the while, young man?\" asked Mr. Martin of the youth who had been left on guard. \"You didn't go away, did you, and give someone a chance to come up and take one of the dogs?\"  \"Oh, no, sir! I stayed right here all the while. I sat down on the running-board and waited. The only thing that happened was that the alligator tried to crawl out, but I put him back. I was sitting here, thinking how funny it was that anybody should have so many pets, when, all of a sudden, I felt something rough on my neck.\"  \"What was it?\" asked Janet, while Teddy was looking under the automobile, thinking that perhaps Tip might be hiding there.  \"It was the little alligator, with his rough tail,\" explained the young man, who said he was called \"Shorty\" by his chums. He was very tall, and perhaps that was why he was called \"Shorty,\" in fun you know. \"It was the little alligator that was crawling up my shoulder and scratching my neck,\" he explained. \"I put him back in his cage, or tank, or whatever you call it, though I was afraid he'd bite me.\"  \"Oh, no, Slider is very gentle,\" said Ted, who came up on the sidewalk, after having peered under the automobile. \"Oh, dear, I don't see where Tip can be!\" he said.  \"It is queer that he should go away and leave Top,\" said Mrs. Martin, for the other white poodle dog was there, safe in the automobile.  Top looked up at the friends gazing down at him, barked and wagged his tail. Perhaps he, too, was asking what had become of his chum, Tip.  \"The dog must have jumped out on the opposite side of the car from where you were sitting,\" said Mr. Martin to Shorty. \"Though if that had happened I should have thought you would have heard him,\" and the father of the Curlytops looked rather sharply at Shorty.  \"No, sir, I didn't hear a thing,\" was the answer. \"All I know is that the alligator tried to crawl up my neck. I didn't see the dog run away.\"  \"Perhaps he didn't run away,\" suggested Mrs. Martin.  \"What do you mean?\" asked Janet.  \"I mean someone may have stepped up softly, when this young man had his back turned, and, reaching over, may have lifted Tip up and taken him away. I wish you had sat in the auto, Shorty, instead of outside on the step.\"  \"Yes'm, I wish so myself,\" agreed the young man. \"But there were so many animals in there I thought I'd better be on the outside so I could chase 'em quicker in case any got away. And one did get away and I never saw him! I'm terribly sorry! I'll go down the street and see if I can find him.\"  \"I wish you would,\" remarked Mr. Martin. \"Just take a look, and ask everyone you meet if he saw a white poodle with a black tip on the end of his tail. If you find him I'll give you a dollar besides the fifty cents for watching the auto.\"  \"I'd like to earn that dollar!\" said the young man. \"I'll go look!\"  \"I'll come, too,\" offered Teddy, \"but I don't want a dollar if I find Tip. I just want to get our dog back.\"  \"So do I,\" added Janet. \"I'll come and look with you.\"  \"This was a valuable dog,\" explained Mr. Martin, as Shorty moved off down the street. \"He could do tricks. I'd like very much to get him back.\"  \"I'll do my best,\" promised the young man. \"It was my fault, in a way, that he got a chance to go away. I should have been looking on both sides of the auto at once, but I didn't. I'll see if I can't find him.\"  \"I think I'll take a look, myself,\" said Mr. Martin to his wife, who had now gotten in the automobile with Trouble. \"I don't like the way things have happened.\"  \"Why, do you think that young man had anything to do with Tip's going away?\" asked Mrs. Martin, as Ted and Janet went down the street one way while Shorty took the other direction.  \"I can't be sure,\" answered the father of the Curlytops. \"He looks like an honest young man, but if he knew what a valuable dog Tip was he might have let some friend of his step up and take away the pet animal.\"  \"But wouldn't he have allowed both of the dogs to be taken--Top as well as Tip?\" asked Mrs. Martin.  \"Maybe there wasn't time to take but the one,\" her husband explained. \"And perhaps I am wrong, and Shorty is right. Tip may have seen some other dog on the far side of the street, and have jumped out of the car to go up to him. It's too bad, but maybe we'll get him back.\"  \"I hope the children don't go so far away that they are lost, too,\" remarked Mrs. Martin.  \"I think they'll not go far,\" said her husband. \"Oh, no, you don't!\" he suddenly exclaimed. \"Come back here! We don't want to chase _you_!\" and he made a hasty grab for Slider, the pet alligator, who seemed to want to get out of his glass-sided tank. \"I'll be glad when we get Uncle Toby's menagerie safely home,\" said Mr. Martin.  \"So shall I,\" his wife added. \"Though the animals seem very nice. Trouble loves Snuff already.\"  \"Oh, I suppose we shall get to like them all,\" agreed Mr. Martin. \"We'll have to let Ted and Janet make places for them in the barn. It is warm weather now, and even the tropical animals, like the monkey, can stay out there.\"  \"I wonder if the parrot will talk much?\" ventured Mrs. Martin. \"I have always rather wished for a talking parrot. Hello, Polly!\" she called to the red and green bird in his cage.  \"Hello, Polly!\" answered Mr. Nip. \"I'm a crack-crack-cracker!\" he shouted at the top of his voice, and several persons, passing along the street, turned to smile at the Martins with their automobile load of pets. Then Mr. Nip began to whistle, so very much like a boy, that Skyrocket, Ted's dog, imagined his master was whistling to him, and barked in answer. Then Top, the remaining pet poodle, also began to bark, and Jack, the monkey, chattered in his own queer way.  \"I'm a crack-crack-cracker!\" Mr. Nip shouted at the top of his voice, and by this time quite a little crowd had gathered around the automobile.  \"I wish we were at home!\" exclaimed Mrs. Martin, who did not like so many strange persons staring at her and her husband and Trouble. But Trouble, who was trying to smooth down the fluffy fur of the Persian cat, did not seem to mind.  \"What's this--a traveling circus?\" asked a policeman, stepping up to the side of the car. \"You have to get a permit if you're going to give a parade,\" he added to Mr. Martin.  \"Oh, I'm not going to give a parade,\" answered the father of the Curlytops. \"We are just waiting to see if we can find one of our pets, a trick dog that ran away--or that was taken away,\" and he explained what had happened.  \"Do you know anything about that young man--Shorty he called himself--who watched our auto while we ate?\" asked Mrs. Martin.  \"I know him--yes,\" the policeman answered. \"Sometimes he is bad, again he is good. I'd say he was bad more often than he was good.\"  \"Just what I was afraid of!\" exclaimed Mr. Martin. \"I think Shorty knows more about the missing dog than he has told us. I don't believe he'll come back to get the dollar I promised him.\"  \"Here come Ted and Janet,\" said their mother. \"They didn't find Tip, either.\"  The Curlytops were hurrying along the street toward the automobile. They saw the policeman and began to run.  \"Oh, did you find him? Did you get Tip back?\" gasped Janet, as she reached the car. \"Did the policeman find him?\"  \"No,\" answered her mother. \"Did you see anything of our new dog, Curlytops?\"  Ted and Janet sadly shook their heads. They had looked up and down several streets, they explained, but Tip was nowhere in sight. Nor had they seen Shorty since he, also, started to look for the"]]]
