As a statesman, he never achieved a high or distinguished reputation. The American war was the blot upon his career; nor can even his devotion to the Sovereign entirely excuse him for remaining in office at His Majesty's entreaty to pursue a course of colonial policy which his reason and his conscience disapproved. This was a political fault, which no circumstances can palliate. Others have done worse, no doubt, from meaner motives; but the mere desire of serving the King does not absolve the Minister from censure for having acted contrary to his own convictions on a question of such grave importance.  Lord North continued to retain the royal favour until he entered into the coalition with the Whigs. This was a step the King could not forgive. No extremity could reconcile him to a measure so repulsive to his feelings. Yet the coalition, after all, was more discreditable to the Whigs than to Lord North, who may be pardoned for accepting it as a tribute to his personal weight, and a recantation, in some sort, of all the odium the Whigs had industriously heaped upon him during the whole period of his Administration. If they really believed him to be the base and dangerous person they had all along described him to be, the shame was theirs for consenting to associate themselves with him, and to work under him in the Government.  The Administration of Lord North lasted for twelve years--from 1770 to 1782. The most important consequence it effected, so far as political parties were concerned, was to throw the Whigs into opposition, and to draw the Tories into closer relations with the throne. This complete exchange of position exactly suited the principles of the two great factions; the loyalty and courtly aspirations of the Tories (now that all hope of restoring the Stuarts was at an end) rendering them highly acceptable in the councils of the monarch, while the popular doctrines of the Whigs pointed to the benches of the Opposition as the appropriate place for a party which is always more usefully employed in representing the people than in exercising the functions of Government. Sixty years elapsed before the Whigs recovered the ground which they had lost under the Ministry of Lord North.  The American war--for the management of which the severest reproaches were cast upon the Government--the state of Ireland, and Parliamentary Reform, were the principal public questions that agitated the term of Lord North's Administration. Amongst the Whigs who took a prominent part in these proceedings were the Grenvilles. Connected by marriage with the Pitt family, and distinguished by their own hereditary claims and high talents, they exerted as conspicuous an influence out of office as they had previously done when they had the reins of Government in their hands. It will be necessary to retrace briefly the political heraldry of the Grenvilles for the purpose of bringing the reader acquainted with the character of the three brothers whose intimate correspondence forms the substance of these volumes.  Richard Grenville succeeded his brother in the Earldom of Temple in 1752, and took an active part in the Administration of the elder Pitt (Lord Chatham), who was married to his sister, Lady Hesther, the mother of the \"Great Commoner.\" He resigned office with Pitt in 1761, on the question of the war with Spain. This circumstance estranged him from his political connection with his only brother, George Grenville, who remained in office under Lord Bute, as Treasurer of the Navy. Lord Temple, espousing the cause of Wilkes (for which he was dismissed from his Lieutenancy of the county of Bucks) continued in opposition till he was finally reconciled to his brother in 1765. He afterwards had a serious difference with Pitt on the formation of the Cabinet in 1766; but a reconciliation having been effected between them in 1768, they subsequently acted in concert except upon the taxation of America, Lord Temple invariably supporting the policy of his brother and the Stamp Act.  George Grenville had been educated for the bar, and entered Parliament for the borough of Buckingham at the instance of his uncle, Lord Cobham; joined the Administration in 1744, as a Lord of the Admiralty, afterwards as a Lord of the Treasury, then as Treasurer of the Navy, and continued in office at intervals till 1762, when, separating himself from Lord Temple and Mr. Pitt, he joined Lord Bute as Secretary of State. On the resignation of Lord Bute in 1763, he became First Lord of the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer, remaining at the head of the Cabinet till his dismissal in 1765, after which he never again accepted office.  He left three sons, George, Thomas, and William Wyndham, who variously distinguished themselves in the public service, and whose letters, chiefly those of the last, in all respects the ablest and most celebrated, constitute the bulk of the following pages.  George Grenville succeeded to the title of Earl Temple on the death of his uncle, and was afterwards created Marquis of Buckingham, and was father of the late Duke of Buckingham. He twice filled the office of Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland.  Thomas Grenville, who died recently at an advanced age, filled several high offices in the State, and accumulated one of the most splendid libraries in the kingdom.  William Wyndham Grenville, afterwards Lord Grenville, was one of the most eminent statesmen of the reign of George III., and, surviving all his great contemporaries, died in 1834. \"The endowments of his mind,\" observes Lord Brougham, \"were all of a useful and commanding sort--sound sense, steady memory, vast industry. His acquirements were in the same proportion valuable and lasting--a thorough acquaintance with business in its principles and in its details; a complete mastery of the science of politics as well theoretical as practical; of late years a perfect familiarity with political economy, and a just appreciation of its importance; an early and most extensive knowledge of classical literature, which he improved instead of abandoning, down to the close of his life; a taste formed upon these chaste models, and of which his lighter compositions, his Greek and Latin verses, bore testimony to the last. His eloquence was of a plain, masculine, authoritative cast, which neglected if it did not despise ornament, and partook in the least possible degree of fancy, while its declamation was often equally powerful with its reasoning and its statement. He was in this greatest quality of a statesman pre-eminently distinguished, that, as he neither would yield up his judgment to the clamour of the people, nor suffer himself to be seduced by the influence of the Court, so would he never submit his reason to the empire of prejudice, or own the supremacy of authority or tradition.\" The character is accurately and justly discriminated; but, however fully this searching panegyric is sustained and justified by the public acts and recorded labours of Lord Grenville, we must turn to his correspondence with Lord Temple for the complete development of that sagacity and sound judgment, that intimate knowledge of public affairs, and that remarkable comprehensiveness of view and lucidity of statement, by which he was distinguished above his contemporaries in an age of great political characters. This correspondence, extending over a long period of years, is not less remarkable for the constancy with which it was carried on than for the minuteness of its details, and the freedom of its revelations. Written with the ease of familiar intercourse, and in that confidential spirit which was the exponent of one of the most touching attachments that ever bound one man to another, it is no less valuable as a close, running commentary on the events of the day, lighting up in its course the hidden springs of parliamentary action and the policy of cabinets, than it is fascinating from the teeming evidences with which it abounds of a warm heart and a highly disciplined and accomplished mind.  The Correspondence commences in 1782, when Lord North, sinking under the odium of the American war, found his small majorities rapidly diminishing from 22 to 19, then to the vanishing point of 1, and finally to a minority of 16. Every incident connected with the war, the taxes, parliamentary reform, and all other questions upon which it was possible to raise a discussion, were seized upon by the opposition to harass the Ministry. The total surrender of York Town by Lord Cornwallis, with the whole army under his command, to Washington, and of the British vessels in the harbour to the French Admiral de Grasse in the October of 1781, awakened universal indignation; and, when Parliament met in November, it became evident that, however resolved the King or the Government might be to persevere in their policy, the doom of the Administration was near at hand. Amendments to the Address, pointing ominously to a change of counsels, were moved in both houses by Lord Shelburne and Mr. Fox; but nothing further was done till after the Christmas recess, with the exception of an announcement that Ministers had resolved not to send a fresh army to replace that surrendered by Lord Cornwallis.  About this time, very early in the session, a motion was contemplated on the subject, the object of which, as may be gathered from the following notes of the Marquis of Rockingham, was to relieve Lord Cornwallis from the disgrace that impended over him, and to throw the real responsibility upon Ministers. The Marquis of Rockingham, desirous of proceeding upon more certain information than had at that time been received, appears to have"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20982"],["title","Memoirs of the Courts and Cabinets of George the Third (#3)"],["body","a little delay, and to have been of opinion that if any motion were to be brought forward at that moment it ought to have taken the shape of a motion for inquiry. It is evident that the Marquis of Rockingham was already collecting his friends about him. The name of Lord Rockingham's correspondent does not appear, but, from a subsequent allusion, it may be presumed that these notes were addressed to the Duke of Chandos.       THE MARQUIS OF ROCKINGHAM TO THE DUKE OF CHANDOS.      My Lord,      Your Grace does me much honour in the communication of the     thoughts you entertain of bringing forward some matters of     business in the House of Lords.      I shall be very happy to concur in opinion with your Grace, but     I must say that I cannot at present think that there is anything     come to our knowledge in regard to the actual conduct of Lord     Cornwallis, as commander of a British army in America, which     calls for the honour of a vote of thanks from the House of     Lords.      The fatal event of the army under his Lordship's command, having     been reduced to the situation of being obliged to lay down their     arms and surrender prisoners of war, naturally requires that an     explanation or justification should precede anything that could     be declaratory of approbation.      As I understand your Grace's proposition, I conceive your     intentions would be, that in thanking Lord Cornwallis for his     general conduct, you would at the same time state, that the     plans he _was directed_ to pursue and which had been so fatal,     were _highly censurable_.      An inquiry into _the causes_ of the loss of that army might     certainly be a very proper and becoming measure; and I have very     little, or rather no doubt that the blame and censure would fall     heavy on many of His Majesty's Ministers, if such an inquiry was     taken up, and tried by an uninfluenced or _undeluded_ jury.      There is a particular circumstance, which possibly, as your     Grace has been out of town, may not have come to your knowledge.     I understand that Lord Cornwallis and all the officers of the     army captured at York Town and Gloucester, _are under a parole     of honour, and on their faith neither to say or do anything     injurious to the interests of the United States or armies of     America, or their allies, until exchanged_.      Your Grace will recollect, that in the Articles of Capitulation,     much doubt has been held in regard to _the propriety_ of one of     the articles, whereby Lord Cornwallis had left some Americans     (who had been in or had joined our army) to be at the mercy of     the civil authority in America.      Many Lords will think that some explanation of that conduct in     Lord Cornwallis is necessary; and I do not conceive that any     explanation could at present be got from Lord Cornwallis.      The Duke of Richmond having called upon me this morning, I had     the honour to go with his Grace to your Grace's house, hoping     that you were arrived in London. The Duke of Richmond will be     early at the House of Lords to-morrow, and intends to desire the     House to be summoned for Monday next, in order to make some     inquiry in regard to the execution of Colonel Harris, at     Charlestown, in America. I will also be early at the House of     Lords to-morrow, and I shall then hope to have the opportunity,     along with the Duke of Richmond, of having the honour of some     more discourse upon the subject matter of your Grace's letter,     and that it will not impede your Grace's intentions of some     conversation in the House, on the loss of a great army.      I have the honour to be, with great regard,      Your Grace's most obedient and most humble servant,      Rockingham.      Grosvenor Square,     Wednesday, P.M. near Five o'clock,     Jan. 30th, 1782.       THE MARQUIS OF ROCKINGHAM TO THE DUKE DE CHANDOS.      My Lord,      Having not gone to dinner till rather late, and my company     having staid with me till just now, I have not been able to     return an answer to your Grace's very obliging letter as soon as     I otherwise should have done. It also prevented my being able to     profit of the honour you proposed to me of calling here this     evening.      I will call at the Duke of Richmond's before two o'clock     to-morrow, and I hope that his Grace and I shall have the honour     of meeting your Grace at the House of Lords, between two and     three o'clock; I should imagine, any time before three o'clock     will afford us time for the honour of some conversation     together.      I have the honour to be, with great regard,      Your Grace's most obedient and most humble servant,      Rockingham.      Grosvenor Square.     Wednesday night, past Nine o'clock,     Jan. 30th. 1782       THE MARQUIS OF ROCKINGHAM TO LORD TEMPLE.      My dear Lord,      I felt myself much honoured by the very kind intimation which     you sent to me by Mr. T. Grenville, that your Lordship would not     be unwilling to come to town, to attend in the House of Lords,     in case any matter was likely to come on, which might appear to     me to be of importance in the present miserable state of the     affairs of this country.      I should have wrote to your Lordship to have apprized you of the     motions intended by the Duke of Richmond on the subject of the     execution of Colonel Harris in Charlestown in North America, and     of the proclamation which had in consequence been issued by     General Green. I was very doubtful in regard to the _probable     day_ on which the business might come to be discussed.      On the Duke of Richmond's first mentioning the subject, it came     out that the Ministers at last acknowledged that they had no     official information; but as a vessel had arrived from New York,     and some officers had also arrived from Charlestown on Friday or     Saturday last, I thought it probable that on _Monday_ or     _yesterday_ we might have heard that they had got _official     information_, and that possibly some papers would be to be laid     before the House, and the discussion of the matter would then     have been fixed for some day, and regularly proceeded upon.      The event was different: they continued to say that they had no     official information, but chose to enter into a justification of     the whole proceeding, in part urging some accounts which they     said had been in a Pennsylvanian Gazette.      I am now to inform your Lordship, that the Duke of Chandos, who     had thrown out an idea of inquiring into the causes of the loss     and capture of Earl Cornwallis and his army, has been wished and     desired to move it on Thursday next.      The Duke of Richmond, the Duke of Chandos, and Duke of     Manchester, and some friends, have been here this morning, and     have prepared the enclosed motion for the inquiry, and also     motions for papers which would be necessary. Lord Shelburne and     Lord Camden have been acquainted with the intention; the Duke of     Grafton is also in town; so that I should imagine the business     will be well supported. I have no expectation of any success in     the House of Lords; but upon such a calamity and national     disgrace, it surely will become us to propose to bring on an     inquiry. Perhaps we may learn whether the Ministers intend to     throw the blame either on their Commander-in-Chief, General H.     Clinton, or on Earl Cornwallis, or (what some suppose), on Lord     Greaves. The public at large have a right to know whether the     real cause has not arose from the neglect, inability, or some     other cause, in His Majesty's Ministers.      As the business is now fixed for Thursday next, I have taken the     liberty of apprizing your Lordship by a messenger, who I hope     will arrive before your Lordship goes to bed to-night.      I wish I could have wrote earlier. I shall be very happy in the     honour of seeing your Lordship, which I hope may be soon, even     if your Lordship could not at this time come to London.      I have the honour to be, with great truth and regard,      Your Lordship's most obedient and obliged humble servant,      Rockingham.      Grosvenor Square,     Tuesday, Four o'clock,     Feb. 5th, 1782.   On the 22nd of February, General Conway moved an Address to the King, imploring His Majesty to abandon the war. After a protracted debate, which lasted till two o'clock in the morning, the Ministers found themselves in an alarming majority of 1. But they persevered in the face of these disasters, and, sustained in office by the tenacity of the King, refused to submit to the constitutional warning of Parliament. Three months before, the Duke of Richmond, writing to Lord Rockingham, anticipated the obstinacy of the Cabinet, expressing his conviction, that \"no essential change of measures was meant, and none of men if it could be avoided. When I say the Ministry,\" he added, \"I mean the King; for his servants are the merest servants that ever were.\"  Nor was it only by protecting an unpopular Ministry that His Majesty showed his resolution to exercise his prerogative in direct opposition to public opinion. It was in the midst of these accumulating defeats and strong expressions of popular feeling, that His Majesty raised Lord George Germain to the peerage with the title of Viscount Sackville, in open indifference to the fact that his Lordship had been dismissed from the army by the sentence of a court-martial, and declared incapable of serving His Majesty in any military capacity, in consequence of his conduct at the battle of Minden. To such proceedings as these Walpole refers, when he observes at this time that \"the power of the Crown has increased, is increasing, and ought to be diminished; and it is diminished a good deal indeed.\" The diminution of its power, however, was visible only in the spirited resistance of Parliament, in the motion of"]]]
