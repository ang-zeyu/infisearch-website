That shows there's a fight going on. I've seldom seen a rookery without a mix-up in progress. That is, during the early part of the season after the cows have started to haul up. There's not nearly as much of it now, though, as there used to be.\"  \"Could I see a fight?\" the boy asked eagerly.  \"Hardly help seeing one,\" was the reply. \"Watch now. We're just at the rookery. Immediately!\"  Turning sharply to the left, the older man led the way between two piles of stones heaped up so as to form a sort of wall, and shut off at the sea end.  \"What's this for?\" asked Colin.  \"Path through the rookery. Want to count the seals every once in a while,\" the agent said. \"Must have some sort of gangway. Obviously! Couldn't get near enough, otherwise.\"  \"Why not?\" queried Colin. \"Would the beachmasters attack you?\"  \"They won't start it,\" was the reply. \"Sea-catch keeps quiet unless he thinks you're going to attack his harem. About two weeks ago, I only just escaped. Narrow squeeze. Wanted to get a photograph of one of the biggest sea-catches I had ever seen. Took a heavy camera. The sea-catch didn't seem excited. Not particularly. So, I came up quite close to him.\"  \"How close, Mr. Nagge?\"  \"Ten or twelve feet. Just about. I got under the cloth. Focused him all right. Then slipped in my plate. Just going to press the bulb when he charged. Straight for me. No warning. I squeezed the bulb, anyhow; grabbed the camera and ran. Promptly!\"  \"Did he chase you far?\"  \"A few yards. I knew there was no real danger. Best of it was that the plate caught the bull right in the act of charging! I've got a print up at the house. Show you when we get home!\"  \"I'd like to see it, ever so much,\" the boy answered.  As they came to a gap in the wall, the agent halted.  \"There!\" he said. \"That's a rookery.\"  In spite of all that he had heard before of the numbers of seals, and although the deafening noise was in a sense a preparation, Colin was dazed at his first sight of a big seal rookery. For a moment he could not take it in. He seemed to be overlooking a wonderful beach of rounded boulders, smooth and glistening like polished steel; here and there pieces of gaunt gray rock projected above and at intervals of about every fifteen to forty feet towered a huge figure like a walrus with a mane of grizzled over-hair on the shoulders and long bristly yellowish-white whiskers. For a moment the boy stood bewildered, then suddenly it flashed upon him that this wonderful carpet of seeming boulders, this gleaming, moving pageantry of gray, was composed of living seals.  \"Why, there are millions of them!\" he cried.  Right from the water's edge back halfway to the cliffs, and as far as the eye could see into the white sea-mist, every inch of the ground was covered. Looking at those closest to him, Colin noticed that they lay in any and every possible attitude, head up or down, on their backs or sides, or curled up in a ball; wedged in between sharp rocks or on a level stretch--position seemed to make no difference. Nor were any of them still for a minute, for even those which were asleep twitched violently and wakened every few minutes. And over the thousands of silver-gray cow seals, the sea-catches, the lords of the harem, three or four times the size of their mates, stood watch and ward unceasingly.  \"Why do you herd them so close together?\" asked Colin. \"I should have thought there was lots of room on the beaches of the island.\"  \"They herd themselves,\" the agent said. \"Don't go anywhere unless it is crowded. The more a place is jammed, the more anxious they are to get there. Newcomers won't go to empty harems. Unhappy with only one or two other cows. Try and find room in a crowded bunch where one sea-catch is looking after thirty females.\"  \"But,\" said Colin, looking at the group which was nearest to him, \"there are a lot of little baby seals in there! They'll get trodden on!\"  \"They are trodden on. Often,\" said the agent. \"Can't be helped. Only a few pups right in the harems and they are all small. Obviously! Go away when they are a week old. Wander from the harem to find playfellows. Make up 'pods' or nurseries. Sometimes four or five hundred in one nursery. Stay until the end of the season. There's a pod of pups,\" he continued, pointing up the beach; \"about sixty of them, I should judge. Happy-looking? Clearly!\"  \"They look like big black kittens,\" said Colin, as he watched them tumbling about on the pebbly beach, \"and just as full of fun. Can they swim as soon as they are born, Mr. Nagge?\"  \"Seals have to learn to swim. Same as boys,\" he answered. \"They teach themselves, apparently! Young seal, thrown into deep water, will drown. Queer. Become wonderful swimmers, too.\"  \"About how long does it take them to learn?\" Colin asked.  \"Don't begin until they are three weeks old,\" was the reply. \"Practise several hours a day. Swim well in about a month.\"  \"Why don't the father or the mother seals teach them?\" queried the boy.  \"A sea-catch doesn't see anything outside the harem. As long as a pup is within twelve feet of him, he will fight on the instant if the baby is in danger. Once it is in the nursery the bull seal forgets the little one's existence. He couldn't leave, anyway. Some other sea-catch would seize the harem.\"  \"You mean that the old seal can't get away at all?\"  \"Not at all,\" was the reply.  \"Then what does he get to eat?\" asked Colin in surprise, \"do the cow seals bring him food?\"  \"Not a bite. No. He doesn't eat at all. Not all summer.\"  \"Never gets a bite of anything? I should think he'd starve to death,\" cried the lad.  \"Fasts for nearly four months. From the time a sea-catch hauls up in May and preempts the spot he has chosen for his harem he doesn't leave that spot eight to sixteen feet square until late in August. Stays right there. He's active enough in some ways. No matter how much he flounders around, he keeps right on his own harem ground. He could hardly get away from it if he tried.\"  [Illustration: HOLLUSCHICKIE HAULING UP FROM THE SEA.  Rare sketch, taken before ever a camera was seen on the Pribilof Islands.

Bureau of Fisheries._]  \"Why not?\"  \"He couldn't leave his own harem without getting into the next one. Obviously!\" the agent promptly replied. \"And he'd have to fight that beachmaster. Evidently! And so on every few feet he went. Besides, the very moment his back was turned a neighboring bull would steal some of his cows. Certainly! Or, an idle bull would try and beat him out.\"  \"Which are the idle bulls?\" asked Colin.  \"Those fellows at the back who came late or were beaten in the fight for places. They would charge down and take the harem, if he left it.\"  \"Well, then, how does he sleep?\"  \"Doesn't sleep much,\" was the reply; \"just little catnaps. Five or ten minutes at a time, perhaps. Light sleepers, too. If a cow tries to leave or an intruder comes near he wakes right up. Immediately! He's on the alert, night and day.\" The agent laughed. \"Eternal vigilance is the bull seal's motto, all right!\"  \"But how can they stand it without food and without sleep?\" Colin asked. \"That's over three months of fasting. And it isn't like an animal that's asleep all winter. It seems to be their busiest time, fighting and watching and all that sort of thing!\"  \"They live on their blubber,\" the agent explained. \"In the spring they haul up heavy and fat. Can hardly move around they're so fleshy. It's the end of June now. You see! Many bulls are loaded with fat still. By the end of next month, though, they'll be getting thin. Some of 'em are like skeletons when they leave the rookeries in August. They'll fight to the end, though.\"  \"But if they leave each other's harems alone,\" Colin objected, \"I don't see any cause for a fight.\"  \"The cows don't all come at the same time. Perhaps for six weeks there are cows coming all the time. Those beachmasters who have harems nearest the water want their family first and there's fighting all along the water's edge, then. Other cows have to make their way inshore; any of the sea-catches may grab them. Wait a minute and watch. You'll see the scramble going on somewhere. There are two bulls fighting there,\" he added, pointing to a combat in progress some distance off, \"and there's another--and another.\"  \"Is that one of the new cows just coming in from the water?\" asked Colin, pointing to the shore, where a female seal, quietly and without attracting attention, had landed near one of the large harems.  \"Yes,\" the agent said. \"Just watch her a while. You'll see how the fighting begins.\"  Moving quietly and slowly and making just as little disturbance as possible, the incoming seal made her way through and over the recumbent seals, keeping as far as she could from the beachmasters. Those huge monarchs of the waterside eyed her closely, but the harems were full to the last inch of ground and they let her pass, the cow seal remaining quiet as long as the beachmaster was watching, then creeping on a yard or two.  \"She'll get caught by the next one,\" said Colin. \"See, there's just about room enough in his harem for one more.\"  But the cow managed to make her way past, the old bull being engrossed in watching a neighboring sea-catch whom he suspected of designs upon his home. She had only succeeded in reaching a point about six harems inland, however, when a bull with a small group of only about twelve cows, suddenly reached out with his strong neck, grabbed her by the back"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21008"],["title","The Boy With the U. S. Fisheries (#8)"],["body","his sharp teeth and threw her on the rocks with the rest of his company. As the sea-catch weighed over four hundred pounds and the cow not more than eighty--the poor creature was flung down most cruelly.  \"The brute!\" cried Colin.  But for some reason the cow was dissatisfied with her new master and tried to escape. The old sea-catch made a lunge forward and caught her by the back of the neck, biting viciously as he did so, in such wise that the teeth tore away the skin and flesh, making two raw and ugly wounds.  Colin's indignation was without bounds.  \"I'd like to smash that old beast!\" he said, and if the agent had not been there to stop him the boy would have jumped over the low wall and gone to the assistance of the cow seal.  \"That's going on all the time,\" the agent said. \"You can't settle the affairs of ten thousand families. Not offhand that way. You'd be kept busy if you tried to fight the battles of every female that hauls up on St. Paul rookery.\"  \"But see,\" cried Colin, \"he's going after her again!\"  This time the sea-catch was evidently angry, for he shook the cow as a dog does a rat and tossed her back into the very center of the harem, standing over her and growling angrily. The agent looked on tranquilly.  \"There's going to be trouble,\" he said. \"See that idle bull coming?\"  He pointed to the back of the rookery, and Colin saw a sea-catch of good size, though not as large as the bull whose savage attack on the cow had excited Colin's resentment, come plunging down through the rookery with the clumsy lope of the excited seal. The cow squirmed from under the threatening fangs of her captor, but just as he was about to punish her still more severely, he caught sight of the intruder, and, with a vicious snap, he whirled round to the defense. The newcomer, though powerful, showed the dark-brown rather than the grizzled over-hair of the older bull, but while he had youth on his side, he was not the veteran of hundreds of battles.  Both stood upright for a moment, watching each other keenly, but with their heads averted, then the younger bull, with a forward movement so rapid that it could hardly be followed, struck downward with his long teeth to the point where the front flipper joins the body. It was a clever stroke, but the old bull knew all the tricks of warfare and turned the flipper in so that the teeth of his opponent only gashed the skin, and at the same time the old bull jerked his head up and sidewise, and sank his teeth deep into the side of the neck of the younger bull.  \"He's got him, what a shame!\" cried Colin, whose sympathies were all with the younger fighter.  The old sea-catch, paying no attention to the roaring and whistling of his wounded rival, kept his teeth fast-clenched in a bulldog-like grip and braced himself against the repeated lunges the other made to get free. There could be but one result to this and, with an agonized wrench, the younger bull pulled himself free--tearing out several inches of skin and leaving a gaping wound from which the blood streamed down.  But he was not defeated yet!  Facing his more powerful enemy, roaring unceasingly and with the shrill piping whistle of battle, the younger bull fairly swelled with exertion and rage until he seemed almost the size of his big foe, his head darted from side to side quick as a flash, and the revengeful, passionate eyes--so different from the limpid, gentle glance of the cow seals--flashed furiously as the blood poured down and reddened the rocks around him.  Again it was the younger bull who took the aggressive and, after a couple of feints, he reared and struck high for the face, just grazing the cheek of the older bull and pulling out several of the stiff bristles on which his teeth happened to close, springing back in time to escape the double sickle-stroke of the sea-catch. The old bull roared loudly and sprang forward, getting a firm hold of the younger by the skin behind the muscles of the shoulders. But he was a second too late, for as he closed his grip, the smaller fighter shifted and struck down, a hard clean blow, reaching the coveted point and half-tearing the flipper from the body.  Undeterred by the injury, though the pain must have been intense, the old bull threw his weight upon the younger, bending him far over as though to break the spine. Seals cannot move backward, and the smaller fighter was almost overbalanced. Then, seizing his chance, the old beachmaster let go his hold upon the other's back and got in a crashing blow at the same point where he had torn open the neck before, this time sinking his teeth so far in that the muscle of the shoulder showed plainly, and an instant later, although there seemed scarcely time to strike a second blow, he swept down the body with his long, sharp teeth, catching the younger at the flipper-joint, and inflicting a wound almost exactly similar to that which he had received.  Quick as a flash, the younger combatant gave up the fight. But as he turned, instead of merely crawling away defeated, he made a sudden convulsive sprawl which the older bull was not expecting, and dug his teeth into the cow who had given rise to all the trouble, and lifted her bodily. The old beachmaster, his mane bristling with rage, made after him, but the younger bull, although he was forced to move on the stump of his wounded flipper, held fast to his prize, even when the victor inflicted a fourth fearful wound.  But before the old sea-catch could turn the plucky youngster, he saw two other bulls sidling towards his harem, intending to steal his cows while he was off guard, and he lumbered back to repel the new intruders. In the meantime, the young bull was attacked on his way to his own station by three other bulls near whose harems he had to pass, but he made no resistance and, though bleeding from a dozen wounds, he struggled on, leaving a gory trail in his wake, but gripping with grim determination the cow he had almost given his life to secure. When at last he reached his own station, he was a mass of blood from head to foot, his flesh was hanging from him in strips and one of his fore-flippers was dangling uselessly.  \"He put up a plucky fight, anyway,\" said Colin, \"even if he did get licked.\"  But it was for the poor cow seal that Colin felt the most sympathy. She lay upon the rocks where her second captor had thrown her, absolutely unconscious and seemingly almost dead, wounded in several places and covered with blood and sand, a wretched contrast to the pretty, gentle animal which the boy had seen emerge from the water not fifteen minutes before.  \"It's a shame,\" Colin said, speaking a little chokingly. \"I didn't know any animals could be so brutal.\"  The agent glanced at him quickly.  \"The beachmasters are brutes,\" he said, \"but mostly among themselves. Notice. The bull isn't even licking his wounds. He's pretty well used up, too. They're always too proud to show that they feel their hurts. Evidently! Even when they have been almost torn to pieces.\"  \"Then you think he won't die?\"  \"Not a bit of it,\" the agent said cheerfully. \"He'll be ready for another fight to-morrow.\"  \"But how about the poor cow? She looks about dead now,\" said Colin.  \"Not as bad as it looks! She's all right,\" his friend replied. \"Those wounds don't go down into vital parts. They usually just reach the blubber. There isn't a sea-catch on the rookery that hasn't had from ten to twenty fights already this year. Most of 'em have been at it for several seasons. Yet you can hardly notice a scar on them. As for the mother seal, she will probably have a baby seal to-morrow. In a week the wounds will all have healed over. Cat may have nine lives, but a seal has ninety!\"     CHAPTER III  ATTACKED BY JAPANESE POACHERS   \"That's life on a rookery,\" the agent said. \"Fight! Capture! More fight! But the holluschickie are different. Let's go to the hauling-grounds.\"  \"Is that where the killing goes on?\" the boy asked.  \"Not quite,\" was the reply. \"The road to the killing-grounds begins there, though. Naturally! We don't take any seals from a rookery.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"No use! They are all either old bulls, females, or pups,\" was the answer. \"The fur of the old sea-catches is coarse. Couldn't sell it. Never kill a cow seal under any circumstances. That's what all the trouble in killing seals at sea is about. You can't tell a holluschickie from a cow seal in the water. Cruel, too. When a cow seal is on her way to the rookery, she will have a baby seal in a few days.\"  \"The holluschickie, then,\" said Colin, \"don't come on the rookery at all?\"  \"Never! Absolutely! The bachelors, which are young male seals five years old and under, leave the rookery alone. The old sea-catches look after that. Certainly! It is mutilation or death for a holluschickie to put so much as a flipper on a rookery. They seldom try. Therefore, the hauling-grounds are at a distance. Obviously! Sometimes, though, it is impossible for the holluschickie to get to the sea without having to cross the rough, rocky ground which is suitable for a rookery.\"  \"How can they work it, then?\"  \"The sea-catches leave a road eight feet wide, no more, no less. This path through the rookery gives just room for two holluschickie to pass. The beachmasters whose harems are on either side of this road watch them. They keep their lookout from a station right beside the road. If one of the holluschickie touches a cow on either side of this clear road-space, he will be attacked savagely.\"  \"But I should think he could get away easily enough,\" Colin objected, \"because the sea-catch can't leave his harem.\"  \"Can't! Old bulls are all the way along,\" the agent answered. \"Every one will attack a holluschickie who has once been attacked. No chance to escape. But the bachelors know that. They pass up and down such a causeway by thousands, night and day. They 'don't turn to de right, don't turn to de lef', but keep in de middle ob de road,'\" quoted the agent, laughing.  \"And"]]]
