If Coote led him you and I could take cock shots at him from behind.\"  \"Oh, yes,\" said Coote, \"and hit me by mistake; not if I know it.\"  \"We might aim at Coote,\" suggested Heathcote, by way of solving the difficulty, \"and hit the mare by mistake.\"  \"Perhaps it would be rather low,\" said Dick.  \"I don't see, though, why she shouldn't carry us.  She's a long back; plenty of room for all three of us.\"  \"The middle for me,\" said Coote.  \"Think she'd kick up?\" asked Heathcote.  \"Not she, she couldn't lift with all of us on her.  Come on.  Whoa! you beast.  Give us a leg up, somebody.  Whoa!  Hold her head, Coote, and keep her from going round and round.  Now then.  By Jove! what a way up it is!\"  By a mighty effort of combined hoisting and climbing, the boys, one after the other, scaled the lofty ridge, and perched themselves, as securely as they could, well forward on the mare's long back.  Luckily for them, the patient animal endured her burden meekly, and plodded on in a listless manner, pricking her ears occasionally at the riot which went on on her back, and once or twice rattling the bones of her riders by a mild attempt at a trot, but otherwise showing no signs of renewing her former more energetic protest.  In this manner, after a weary and not altogether refreshing journey, the three jaded, tightly-packed heroes came to a standstill at the door of Mountjoy House, where, one after the other, they slid sadly from their perches, and addressed themselves to the satisfying of Mrs Ashford's natural curiosity, only hoping the interview would not be protracted, and so defer for long the supper to which they all eagerly looked forward.  \"Why, what's all this?\" said the matron.  \"Where's the waggonette, and Tom?\" chimed in Mr Ashford, appearing at the same moment.  \"Please, sir,\" said Dick, \"we didn't wait for Tom, and drove home, and there was a little accident.  I was driving at the time, sir.  We got spilt, and the trap was a little damaged.  We left word for Tom to see to it, and I'll write and get my father to pay for mending it.  We're all awfully sorry, sir.  Dr Winter sends his regards, and we shall hear the result of the exam. on Thursday.  One of the wheels came off, but I fancy it will go on again.  It was a rut did it.  We were coming along at a very good pace, and should have been here an hour ago if it hadn't been for the accident.  We're sorry to be late, sir.\"  After which ample explanation and apology the boys felt themselves decidedly aggrieved that they were not at once ushered in to supper. Mr Ashford, however, being a mortal of only limited perception, required a good deal more information; and a painful and somewhat petulant cross-examination ensued, the result of which was that our heroes were informed they were not to be trusted, that both Mr and Mrs Ashford were disappointed in them, that they ought to be ashamed of themselves, and that they would hear more about the matter to-morrow.  And what about the supper?--that glorious spread of coffee and hot toast, and eggs and bacon, the anticipation of which had borne them up in all the perils and fatigue of the day, and had shone like a beacon star to guide them home?  The subject was ignored, basely ignored; and the culprits were ordered to join the ordinary school supper and appease their hunger on bread and cheese and cold boiled beef, and slake their thirst on \"swipes.\"  Then did the spirits of Richardson, Heathcote and Coote wax fierce within them.  Then did they call Mr Ashford a cad, and Mrs Ashford a sneak.  Then did they kick all the little boys within reach, and scowl furiously upon the big ones.  Then did they wish the mare was dead and Templeton a ruin!  As, when Jove frowns and Mercury and Vulcan scowl, the hills hide their heads and the valleys tremble beneath the storm, so did the youth of Mountjoy quake and cower that evening as it raised its eyes and beheld those three gloomy heroes devour their beef and drink their swipes.  No one ventured to ask how they had fared, or wherefore they looked sad; but they knew something had happened.  The little boys gazed with awe- struck wonder at the heroes who had that day been at Templeton, and contended for Templeton honours.  The elder boys wondered if gloom was part of Templeton \"form,\" and when their turn would come to look as black and majestic; and all marvelled at the supper those three ate, and at the chasm they left in the cold boiled beef!  \"Come on, you fellows,\" said Richardson, as soon as the meal was finished.  \"I'm going to bed; I'm fagged.\"  \"So am I,\" said Heathcote.  \"So am I,\" said Coote.  And the triumvirate stalked from the room, leaving Mountjoy more than ever convinced something terrific had happened.  If Coote had had his way, he would rather have stayed up.  He slept in a different room from Richardson and Heathcote, and it was rather slow going to bed by himself at half-past seven.  But as it was evident from Dick's manner that this was the proper course to take under the circumstances, he took it, and was very soon dreaming that he and Edward the Fifth's father were trotting round the Templeton quadrangle on the mare, much to the admiration of the Templeton boys, who assembled in their thousands to witness the exploit.  Next day the uncomfortable topic of the mare and the waggonette was renewed in a long conference with Mr Ashford.  As supper was no longer pending, and as a night's rest had intervened, the boys were rather more disposed to enter into details.  But they failed to satisfy Mr Ashford that they were not to blame for what had occurred.  \"I am less concerned,\" said he, \"about the damage done to the waggonette than I am to think I cannot trust you as fully as I ought to be able to trust my head boys.  I hope during the week or two that remains of this term you will try to win back the confidence you have lost.  I must, in justice to my other boys, punish you.  Under the circumstances, I shall not cane you, but till the end of the term you must each of you lose your hour's play between twelve and one.\"  Mr Ashford paused.  Perhaps he expected an outburst of gratitude. Perhaps he didn't exactly know what to say next.  In either case, he found he had made a mistake.  The boys, with an instinct not, certainly, of self-righteousness, but of common justice, felt that they had had punishment enough already for their sin.  Mr Ashford took no account of those few seconds when the waggonette was dashing through the gate and reeling to its fall.  He reckoned as nothing the weary jolt home, the indignity of that supper last night, and the suspense of that early morning.  He made no allowance for an absence of malice in what they had done, and gave them no credit--although, indeed, neither did they give themselves credit-- for the regret and straightforwardness with which they had confessed it. He proposed to treat them, the head boys of Mountjoy, as common delinquents, and punish them as he would punish a cheat, or a bully, or mutineer.  It wasn't fair--they knew it; and if Ashford didn't know it, too--well, he ought.  \"We'd rather be caned, sir,\" said Richardson, speaking for all three.  Mr Ashford regarded the speaker with sharp surprise.  \"Richardson, kindly remember I am the best judge of what punishment you deserve.\"  \"It's not fair to keep us in all the term,\" said Dick, his cheeks mounting colour with the desperateness of his boldness.  Mr Ashford changed colour, too, but his cheeks turned pale.  \"Leave my sight, sir, instantly!  How do you dare to use language like that to me!\"  Fortunately for the dignity, as well as for the comfort, of the three boys, Dick made no attempt to prolong the argument.  He turned and left the room, followed by his two faithful henchmen, little imagining that, if any one had scored in this unsatisfactory interview, he had.  Don't let the reader imagine that any mystical glory belongs to the schoolboy who happens to \"score one\" off his master.  If he does it consciously, the chances are he is a snob for doing it.  If he does it unconsciously, as Dick did here, then the misfortune of the master by no means means the bliss of the boy.  Dick felt anything but blissful as he stalked moodily to the schoolroom that morning and growled his injuries to his allies.  But Mr Ashford, as soon as his first burst of temper had evaporated, like an honest, sensible man, sat down and reviewed the situation; and it occurred to him, on reviewing it, that he had made a mistake.  It was, of course, extremely painful and humiliating to have to acknowledge it; but, once acknowledged, it would have been far more humiliating to Mr Ashford's sense of honour to persist in it.  He summoned the boys once more to his presence, and they trooped in like three prisoners brought up on remand to hear their final sentence.  The master's mouth twitched nervously, and he half repented of the ordeal he had set before himself.  \"You said just now, Richardson, that the punishment I proposed to inflict on you was not fair?\"  \"Yes, sir, we think so,\" replied Dick, simply.  \"I think so, too,\" said Mr Ashford, equally simply, \"and I shall say no more about it.  Now you can go.\"  The boys gaped at him in mingled admiration and bewilderment.  \"You can go,\" repeated the master.  Richardson took a hasty survey of his companions' countenances, and said--  \"Will you cane us instead, please sir?\"  \"No, Richardson, that would not be fair either.\"  Richardson made one more effort.  \"Please, sir, we think we deserve something.\"  \"People don't always get their deserts in this world, my boy,\" said the master, with a smile.  \"Now please go when I tell you.\"  Mr Ashford rallied three waverers to his standard that morning.  They didn't profess to understand the meaning of it all, but they could see that the master had sacrificed something to do them justice, and with the native chivalry of boys, they made his cause theirs, and did all they could to cover his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20991"],["title","Follow My Leader: The Boys of Templeton (#4)"],["body",".  Two days later, a letter by the post was brought in to Mr Ashford in the middle of school.  Coote's face grew crimson as he saw it, and the faces of his companions grew long and solemn.  A sudden silence fell on the room, broken only by the rustle of the paper as the master tore open the envelope and produced the printed document.  His eyes glanced hurriedly down it, and a shade of trouble crossed his brow.  \"We're gone coons,\" groaned Heathcote.  \"Don't speak to me,\" said Dick.  Coote said nothing, but wished one of the windows was open on a hot day like this.  \"This paper contains the result of the entrance examination at Templeton,\" said Mr Ashford.  \"Out of thirty-six candidates, Heathcote has passed fifteenth, and Richardson twenty-first.  Coote, I am sorry to say, has not passed.\"    CHAPTER THREE.  HOW OUR HEROES GIRD ON THEIR ARMOUR.  Our heroes, each in the bosom of his own family, spent a somewhat anxious Easter holiday.  Of the three, Coote's prospects were decidedly the least cheery. Mountjoy House without Richardson and Heathcote would be desolation itself, and the heart of our hero quailed within him as he thought of the long dull evenings and the dreary classes of the coming friendless term.  \"Never mind, old man,\" Dick had said, cheerily, as the \"Firm\" talked their prospects over on the day before the holidays, \"you're bound to scrape through the July exam.; and then won't we have a jollification when you turn up?\"  But all this was sorry comfort for the dejected Coote, who retired home and spent half his holidays learning dates, so determined was he not to be \"out of it\" next time.  As for Heathcote and Richardson, they were neither of them without their perturbations of spirit.  Not that either of them realised--who ever does?--the momentous epoch in their lives which had just arrived, when childhood like a pleasant familiar landscape lies behind, and the hill of life clouded in mist and haze rises before, all unknown and unexplored.  Heathcote, who was his grandmother's only joy, and had no nearer relatives, did hear some remarks to this effect as he girded himself for the coming campaign.  But he evaded them with an \"Oh, yes, I know, all serene,\" and was far more interested in the prospect of a new Eton jacket and Sunday surplice than in a detailed examination of his past personal history.  The feeling uppermost in his mind was that Dick was going to Templeton too, and beyond that his anxieties and trepidations extended no further than the possibility of being called green by his new schoolfellows.  Richardson had the great advantage of being one of a real family circle.  He was the eldest of a large family, the heads of which feared God, and tried to train their children to become honest men and women.  How far they had succeeded with Dick, or--to give him his real Christian name, now we have him at home--with Basil, the reader may have already formed an opinion.  He had his faults--what boy hasn't?--and he wasn't specially clever.  But he had pluck and hope, and resolution, and without being hopelessly conceited, had confidence enough in himself to carry him through most things.  \"Don't be in too great a hurry to choose your friends, my boy,\" said his father, as the two walked up and down the London platform.  \"You'll find plenty ready enough, but give them a week or two before you swear eternal friendship with any of them.\"  Dick thought this rather strange advice, and got out of it by saying--  \"Oh, I shall have Georgie Heathcote, you know.  I shan't much care about the other fellows.\"  \"Don't be too sure.  And, remember this, my boy, be specially on your guard with any of them that flatter you.  They'll soon find out your weak point and that's where they'll have you.\"  Dick certainly considered this a little strong even for a parent.  But somehow the advice stuck, for all that, and he remembered it afterwards.  \"As to other matters,\" said the father, \"your mother, I know, has spoken for us both.  Be honest to everybody, most of all yourself, and remember a boy can fear God without being a prig-- Ah, here's the train.\"  It was a dismal farewell, that between father and son, when the moment of parting really came.  Neither of them had expected it would be so hard, and when at last the whistle blew, and their hands parted, both were thankful the train slipped swiftly from the station and turned a corner at once.  After the bustle and excitement of the last few days, Dick found the loneliness of the empty carriage decidedly unpleasant, and for a short time after leaving town, was nearer moping than he had ever been before.  It would be an hour before the train reached X---, where Heathcote would get in.  It would be all right then, but meanwhile he wished he had something to do.  So he fell to devouring the provisions his mother and sisters had put up for his special benefit, and felt in decidedly better heart when the meal was done.  Then he hauled down his hat-box, and tried on his new \"pot,\" and felt still more soothed.  Then he extricated his new dressing-case from his travelling-bag, and examined, with increasing comfort, each several weapon it contained, until the discovery of a razor in an unsuspected corner completed his good cheer, and he began to whistle.  In the midst of this occupation the train pulled up, and Heathcote, with _his_ hat-box and bag invaded the carriage.  \"Hallo, old man,\" said Dick with a nod, \"you've turned up, then?  Look here, isn't this a stunning turnout?  Don't go sitting down on my razor, I say.\"  \"Excuse me a second,\" said Heathcote, putting down his traps and turning to the window, \"grandma's here, and I've got to say good-bye.\"  \"Good-bye, grandma,\" added the dutiful youth, holding out his hand to a venerable lady who stood by the window.  \"Good-bye, Georgie.  Give me a kiss, my dear boy.\"  Georgie didn't like kissing in public, especially when the public consisted of Dick.  And, yet, he couldn't well get out of it.  So he hurried through the operation as quickly as possible, and stood with his duty towards his relative and his interest towards the razor, wondering why the train didn't start.  It started at last, and after a few random flickings of his handkerchief out of the window, he was able to devote his entire attention to his friend's cutlery.  One exhibition provoked another.  Heathcote's \"pot\" was produced and critically compared with Dick's.  He had no dressing-case, certainly, but he had a silver watch and a steel chain, also a pocket inkpot, and a railway key.  And by the way, he thought, the sooner that railway key was brought into play the better.  By its aid they successfully resisted invasion at the different stations as they went along, until at length Heathcote's watch told them that the next station would be Templeton.  Whereat they became grave and packed up their bags, and looked rather wistfully out of the window.  \"Father says,\" remarked Dick, \"only the new boys go up to-day.  The rest come to-morrow.\"  \"Rather a good job,\" said Heathcote.  A long silence followed.  \"Think there'll be any one to meet us?\" said Dick.  \"Don't know.  I wish Coote was to be there too.\"  Another pause.  \"I expect they'll be jolly enough fellows,\" said Dick.  \"Oh yes.  They don't bully now in schools, I believe.\"  \"No; they say it's going out.  Perhaps it's as well.\"  \"We shall be pretty well used to the place by to-morrow, I fancy.\"  \"Yes.  It'll be rather nice to see them all turn up.\"  \"I expect, you know, they'll have such a lot to do, they won't bother about new fellows.  I know I shouldn't.\"  \"They might about the awful green ones, perhaps.  Ha, ha!  Wouldn't it be fun if old Coote was here!\"  \"Yes, poor old Coote!  You know I'm half sorry to leave Mountjoy.  It was a jolly old school, wasn't it?\"  The shrieking of the whistle and the grinding of the brake put an end to further conversation for the present.  As they alighted, each with his hat-box and bag and umbrella, and stood on the platform, they felt moved by a sincere affection for the carriage they were leaving.  Indeed, there is no saying what little encouragement would not have sufficed to send them back into its hospitable shelter.  \"Here you are, sir--this way for the school--this cab, sir!\"--cried half a dozen cabmen, darting whip in hand upon our heroes, as they stood looking about them.  \"Don't you go along with them,\" said one confidentially.  \"They'll charge you half-a-crown.  Come along, young gentlemen, I'll take you for two bob.\"  \"Go on.  You think the young gentlemen are greenhorns.  No fear.  They know what's what.  They ain't agoin' to be _seen_ drivin' up the Quad in a Noah's Ark like that.  Come along, young gents; leave him for the milksops.  The like of you rides in a hansom, I know.\"  Of course, this artful student of juvenile nature carried the day, and there was great cheering and crowing and chaffing, when the hansom, with the two trunks on the top, and the two anxious faces inside, peering over the top of their hat-boxes and bags rattled triumphantly out of the station.  As Templeton school was barely three minutes' drive from the station, there was very little leisure either for conversation or the recovery of their composure, before the gallant steed was clattering over the cobbles of the great Quadrangle.  They pulled up at a door which appeared to belong to a bell of imposing magnitude, which the cabman, alighting, proceeded to pull with an energy that awoke the echoes of that solemn square, and made our two heroes draw their breath short and sharp.  \"Hop out, young gentlemen,\" said the cabman, helping his passengers and their luggage out.  \"It's a busy time, and I'm in a hurry.  A shilling each, and sixpence a piece for the traps; that's two and three makes five, and leave the driver to you.\"  Considering the distance they had come, it seemed rather a long price, and Heathcote ventured very mildly to ask--  \"The other man at the station said two shillings."]]]
