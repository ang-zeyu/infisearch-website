Come, throw away this wilful pride and obstinacy.\"  \"I wish I could,\" thought Don one moment.  \"It is as cruel as it is unjust,\" he thought the next; and he felt more obstinately full of pride than ever.  \"Don, I command you to speak,\" said Mrs Lavington, whose manner now began to change; but unfortunately the stern tone she adopted had the wrong effect, and the wrinkles in the boy's face grew deeper, and the position more strained.  If Uncle Josiah, who had never had boys of his own, had come down from the lofty perch he had assumed, taken the boy's hand, and said in kindly and frank tones, \"Come, Don, my boy, there are troubles enough in life, clouds sufficient to obscure too much sunshine; speak out, let's have all this over, and clear the storm away,\"--if he had said something like that, Don would have melted, and all would have been well; but accustomed to manage men with an iron rule, Uncle Josiah had somehow, in spite of his straightforward, manly, and just character, seemed to repel the boy whose charge he had taken, and instead now of making the slightest advance, he said to himself, \"It is not my duty to eat humble pie before the obstinate young cub.  It will be a severe lesson for him, and will do him good.\"  So the breach widened.  Don seemed to grow sulky and sullen, when he was longing to cast himself upon his mother's neck.  The poor woman felt indignant at her son's conduct, and the last straw which broke the camel's back was laid on the top of the load by Kitty, who, moved by a desire to do good, made matters far worse by running across to Don, and in an impetuous way catching his hands and kissing him.  \"Don, dear!\" she cried.  The boy's face lit up.  Here was some one who would believe him after all, and he responded to her advances by grasping her hands tightly in his.  \"Do, do speak, Don dear, and beg father to forgive you,\" she cried. \"Tell him it was a mistake, and that you will never do so again.\"  Don let fall her hands, the deep scowl came over his brow again, and he half turned away.  \"No, no, Don, dear,\" she whispered; \"pray don't be obstinate.  Confess that you did it, and promise father to do better in the future.  He will forgive you; I know he will.\"  Don turned his back with an impatient gesture, and Kitty burst into tears, and went slowly to her aunt, to whose hands she clung.  \"Laura, dear,\" said Uncle Josiah, gravely, \"I think we had better bring this painful interview to an end.  You may rest assured that I shall do what is just and right by Don.  He shall have every opportunity for clearing himself.\"  \"I am not guilty,\" cried Don, fiercely throwing back his head.  \"I thought so this morning, my boy,\" said the old merchant, gravely. \"Your conduct now is making me think very differently.  Laura, I will walk home with you, if you please.\"  \"Josiah!  Don, my boy, pray, pray speak,\" cried Mrs Lavington, piteously.  Don heard her appeal, and it thrilled him, but his uncle's words had raised up an obstinacy that was stronger than ever, and while longing to throw himself in his mother's arms--passionately longing so to do--his indignant pride held him back, and he stood with his head bent, as in obedience to her brother Mrs Lavington took his arm, and allowed him to lead her out of the office, weeping bitterly the while.  Don did not look up to meet his mother's yearning gaze, but for months and years after he seemed to see that look when far away in the midst of peril, and too late he bitterly upbraided himself for his want of frankness and power to subdue his obstinate pride.  \"He thinks me guilty!\" he said to himself, as he stood with his head bent, listening, and unaware of the fact that some one was still in the room, till a light step came towards him, his hand was caught, and his cheek rapidly kissed.  \"Kitty!\"  \"Coming, father.\"  Then there was a rapid step, the door closed, and Don stood in the same attitude, listening to the steps on the gravel, and then to the bang of the wicket-gate.  Alone with his thoughts, and they were many and strange.  What should he do?  Go right away, and--and--  \"Mas' Don.\"  He looked up, and Jem stood at the door.    CHAPTER SIX.  JEM WIMBLE TALKS SENSE.  \"May I come in?\"  Don nodded.  \"The master's gone, and took the ladies 'long with him.  Why, don't look like that, my lad.  Your uncle don't think you took the money?\"  Don nodded.  \"But your mother don't, sir?\"  \"Yes, Jem, she believes me guilty too.\"  \"I never did!\" cried Jem, excitedly.  \"But sure-_lie_ Miss Kitty don't?\"  \"Yes, Jem, they all think I'm a thief.  Everybody does,\" cried Don, passionately.  \"No, everybody don't,\" said Jem, fiercely; \"so don't talk like that, Mas' Don.  Why, even I couldn't ha' stole that money--me, as is only yard-man, and nothing o' no consequence t'other day.  So if I couldn't ha' done it, I'm quite sure as you, as is a young gentleman born and bred, couldn't.\"  \"But they think I did.  Everybody thinks so.\"  \"Tell yer everybody don't think so,\" cried Jem, sharply.  \"I don't, and as for them, they've all got dust in their eyes, that's what's the matter with them, and they can't see clear.  But didn't you tell 'em as you didn't?\"  \"Yes, Jem,\" said Don, despondently; \"at first.\"  \"Then why didn't you at last, too?  Here, cheer up, my lad; it'll all blow over and be forgotten, same as the row was about that sugar-hogshead as I let them take away.  I don't say shake hands 'cause you're like master and me only man, but I shakes hands with you in my 'art, my lad, and I says, don't be down over it.\"  \"You couldn't shake hands with a thief, you mean, Jem,\" said Don, bitterly.  \"Look here, Mas' Don, I can't punch your head because, as aforesaid, you're young master, and I'm only man; but for that there same what you said just now I hits you in my 'art.  Thief indeed!  But ah, my lad, it was a pity as you ever let Mike come into the office to tell you his lies about furren parts.\"  \"Yes, Jem, it was.\"  \"When you might ha' got all he told you out o' books, and the stories wouldn't ha' been quite so black.\"  \"Ah, well, it's all over now.\"  \"What's all over?\"  \"My life here, Jem.  I shall go right away.\"  \"Go?  What?\"  \"Right away.  Abroad, I think.\"  \"And what'll your mother do?\"  \"Forget me, I hope.  I always was an unlucky fellow Jem.\"  \"What d'yer mean?  Run away?\"  \"Yes, I shall go away.\"  \"Well, that's clever, that is.  Why, that's just the way to make 'em think you did it.  Tshah!  You stop like a man and face it out.\"  \"When everybody believes me guilty?\"  \"Don't be so precious aggrawatin', my lad,\" cried Jem, plaintively. \"Don't I keep on a-telling you that I don't believe you guilty.  Why, I'd just as soon believe that I stole our sugar and sold bundles of tobacco-leaves to the marine store shops.\"  Don shook his head.  \"Well, of all the aggrawatin' chaps I ever did see, you're 'bout the worst, Mas' Don.  Don't I tell you it'll be all right?\"  \"No, Jem, it will not be all right.  I shall have to go before the magistrates.\"  \"Well, what of that?\"  \"What of that?\" cried Don, passionately.  \"Why, that scoundrel Mike will keep to his story.\"  \"Let him!\" cried Jem, contemptuously.  \"Why, who'd ever believe him i' preference to you?\"  \"My uncle--my mother--my cousin.\"  \"Not they, my boy.  They don't believe it.  They only think they do. They're sore just now, while it's all fresh.  To-morrow by this time they will be a-hanging o' themselves round about your neck, and a-askin' of your pardon, and kissin' of you.\"  \"No, Jem, no.\"  \"Well, I don't mean as your uncle will be kissin' of you, of course; but he'll be sorry too, and a-shaking of your hand.\"  Don shook his head.  \"There, don't get wagging your head like a Chinee figger, my lad.  Take it like a man.\"  \"It seems that the only thing for me to do, Jem, is to tie up a bundle and take a stick, and go and try my luck somewhere else.\"  \"And you free and independent!  Why, what would you say if you was me, tied up and married, and allus getting into trouble at home.\"  \"Not such trouble as this, Jem.\"  \"Not such trouble as this, my lad?  Worser ever so much, for you don't deserve it, and I do, leastwise, my Sally says I do, and I suppose I do for being such a fool as to marry her.\"  \"You ought to be ashamed to talk like that, Jem.\"  \"So ought you, Mas' Don.  I've often felt as if I should like to do as you say and run right off, but I don't do it.\"  \"You have felt like that, Jem?\" cried Don, eagerly.  \"Yes, often, my lad.\"  \"Then let's go, Jem.  Nobody cares for us here.  Let's go right away to one of the beautiful foreign countries Mike told me about, and begin a new life.\"  \"Shall us, Mas' Don?\"  \"Yes; why not?  Get a passage in some ship, and stop where we like.  He has told me of dozens of places that must be glorious.\"  \"Then we won't go,\" said Jem, decidedly.  \"If Mike Bannock says they're fine spots, don't you believe him; they're bad 'uns.\"  \"Then let's go and select a place for ourselves,\" cried Don.  \"Lor!  I do wonder at you, Mas' Don, wantin' to leave such a mother as you've got, and asking me to leave my wife.  Why, what would they do?\"  \"I don't know,\" said Don, sadly.  \"They care very little for us now. You can do as you like; I shall go.\"  \"Nay, nay, you won't, my lad.\"  \"Yes, Jem, I think I shall.\"  \"Ah, that's better!  Think about it.\"  \"I should have thought that you'd be glad to come with me, Jem.\"  \"So I should, my lad; but there's a some'at as they calls dooty as allus seems to have hold on me tight.  You wait a bit, and see how things turn out.\"  \"But I shall have to appear before the magistrates, and be called a thief.\"  \"Ah, well, that won't be pleasant, my lad, of course; but wait.\"  \"Then you wouldn't go with me, Jem?\"  \"Don't tempt a man, Mas' Don, because I should like to go with you, and course I shouldn'"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21316"],["title","The Adventures of Don Lavington: Nolens Volens (#7)"],["body","like to go with you, because I shouldn't like you to go.  There, I must get on with my work.\"  At that very moment came the call of a shrill voice--  \"Jem!\"  \"There I told you so.  She see me come in here, and she's after me because I haven't got on with my casks.  Oh, how sharp she is!\"  Jem gave Don an intelligent nod of the head, and moved out, while the lad stood gazing at the opposite window and listened to the sharp voice addressing the foreman of the yard.  \"Poor Jem!  He isn't happy either!\" said Don, sadly, as the voices died away.  \"We might go right off abroad, and they'd be sorry then and think better of us.  I wish I was ten thousand miles away.\"  He seated himself slowly on his stool, and rested his arms upon the desk, folding them across his chest; and then, looking straight before him at the door, his mental gaze went right through the panels, and he saw silver rivers flowing over golden sands, while trees of the most glorious foliage drooped their branches, and dipped the ends in the glancing water.  The bright sun shone overhead; the tendrils and waving grass were gay with blossoms; birds of lovely plumage sang sweetly; and in the distance, on the one hand, fading away into nothingness, were the glorious blue mountains, and away to his right a shimmering sea.  Don Lavington had a fertile brain, and on the canvas of his imagination he painted panorama after panorama, all bright and beautiful.  There were no clouds, no storms, no noxious creatures, no trials and dangers. All was as he thought it ought to be, and about as different from the reality as could be supposed.  But Don did not know that in his youthful ignorance, and as he sat and gazed before him, he asked himself whether he had not better make up his mind to go right away.  \"Yes, I will go!\" he said, excitedly, as he started up in his seat.  \"No,\" he said directly after, as in imagination now he seemed to be gazing into his mother's reproachful eyes, \"it would be too cowardly; I could not go.\"    CHAPTER SEVEN.  DON AND JEM GO HOME TO TEA.  It required no little effort on Don's part to go home that afternoon to the customary meat tea which was the main meal of the day at his uncle's home.  He felt how it would be--that his uncle would not speak to him beyond saying a few distant words, such as were absolutely necessary.  Kitty would avert her eyes, and his mother keep giving him reproachful looks, every one of which was a silent prayer to him to speak.  The afternoon had worn away, and he had done little work for thinking. His uncle had not been back, and at last Jem's footstep was heard outside, and he passed the window to tap lightly on the door and then open it.  \"Come, Mas' Don,\" he said, cheerily, \"going to work all night?\"  \"No, Jem, no.  I was just thinking of going.\"  \"That's right, my lad, because it's past shutting-up time.  Feel better now, don't you?\"  \"No, Jem, I feel worse.\"  \"Are you going to keep the yard open all the evening, Jem?\" cried a shrill voice.  \"Why don't you lock-up and come in to tea?\"  \"There!  Hear that!\" said Jem, anxiously.  \"Do go, Mas' Don, or I sha'n't get to the end on it.  'Nuff to make a man talk as you do.\"  \"Jem!\"  \"Here, I'm a-coming, arn't I?\" he cried, giving the door a thump with his fist.  \"Don't shout the ware'us down!\"  \"Jem!\"  \"Now did you ever hear such a aggrawatin' woman?\" cried Jem.  \"She's such a little un that I could pick her up, same as you do a kitten, Mas' Don--nothing on her as you may say; but the works as is inside her is that strong that I'm 'fraid of her.\"  \"Jem!\"  He opened the door with a rush.  \"Ya-a-a-as!\" he roared; \"don't you know as Mas' Don arn't gone?\"  Little Mrs Wimble, who was coming fiercely up, flounced round, and the wind of her skirts whirled up a dust of scraps of matting and cooper's chips as she went back to the cottage.  \"See that, Mas' Don?  Now you think you've all the trouble in the world on your shoulders, but look at me.  Talk about a woman's temper turning the milk sour in a house.  Why, just now there's about three hundred hogsheads o' sugar in our ware'us--two hundred and ninety-three, and four damages not quite full, which is as good as saying three hundred-- see the books whether I arn't right.  Well, Mas' Don, I tell you for the truth that I quite frights it--I do, indeed--as she'll turn all that there sweetness into sour varjus 'fore she's done.  Going, sir?\"  \"Yes, Jem, I'm going--home,\" said Don; and then to himself, \"Ah, I wish I had a home.\"  \"Poor Mas' Don!\" said Jem, as he watched the lad go out through the gate; \"he's down in the dumps now, and no mistake; and dumps is the lot o' all on us, more or less.\"  Then Jem went in to his tea, and Don went slowly home to his, and matters were exactly as he had foreseen.  His uncle was scarcely polite; Kitty gave him sharp, indignant glances when their eyes met, and then averted hers; and from time to time his mother looked at him in so pitiful and imploring a manner that one moment he felt as if he were an utter scoundrel, and the next that he would do anything to take her in his arms and try and convince her that he was not so bad as she thought.  It was a curious mental encounter between pride, obstinacy, and the better feelings of his nature; and unfortunately the former won, for soon after the meal was over he hurried out of the room.  \"I can't bear it,\" he cried to himself, as he went up to his own little chamber,--\"I can't bear it, and I will not.  Every one's against me.  If I stop I shall be punished, and I can't face all that to-morrow. Good-bye, mother.  Some day you'll think differently, and be sorry for all this injustice, and then--\"  A tear moistened Don's eye as he thought of his mother and her tender, loving ways, and of what a pity it was that they ever came there to his uncle's, and it was not the tear that made Don see so blindly.  \"I can't stand it, and I will not,\" he cried, passionately.  \"Uncle hates me, and Mike Bannock's right, scoundrel as he is.  Uncle has robbed me, and I'll go and fight for myself in the world, and when I get well off I'll come back and seize him by the throat and make him give up all he has taken.\"  Don talked to himself a good deal more of this nonsense, and then, with his mind fully made up, he went to the chest of drawers, took out a handkerchief, spread it open upon the bed, and placed in it a couple of clean shirts and three or four pairs of stockings.  \"There,\" he said, as he tied them up tightly as small as he could, \"I won't have any more.  I'll go and start fair, so that I can be independent and be beholden to nobody.\"  Tucking the bundle under his arm, he could not help feeling that it was a very prominent-looking package--the great checked blue and white handkerchief seeming to say, \"This boy's going to seek his fortune!\" and he wished that he was not obliged to take it.  But, setting his teeth, he left the room with the drawers open, and his best suit, which he had felt disposed to take, tossed on a chair, and then began to descend.  It was a glorious summer evening, and though he was in dirty, smoky Bristol, everything seemed to look bright and attractive, and to produce a sensation of low-spiritedness such as he had never felt before.  He descended and passed his mother's room, and then went down more slowly, for he could hear the murmur of voices in the dining-room, which he had to pass to reach the front door, outside which he did not care what happened; but now he had to pass that dining-room, and go along the passage and by the stand upon which his cocked hat hung.  It was nervous work, but he went on down the first flight, running his hand slowly along the hand-balustrade, all down which he had so often slid while Kitty looked on laughing, and yet alarmed lest he should fall.  And what a long time ago that seemed!  He had just reached the bottom flight, and was wondering what to say if the door should open and his uncle meet him with the blue bundle under his arm, when the dining-room door did open, and he dashed back to the landing and stood in the doorway of his mother's room, listening as a step was heard upon the stairs.  \"Kitty!\" he said to himself, as he thrust against the door, which yielded to his pressure, and he backed in softly till he could push the door to, and stand inside, watching through the crack.  There was the light, soft step coming up and up, and his heart began to beat, he knew not why, till something seemed to rise in his throat, and made his breath come short and painfully.  His mother!  She was coming to her room, and in another moment she would be there, and would find him with the bundle under his arm, about to run away.  Quick as thought he looked sharply round, bundle in hand, when, obeying the first impulse, he was about to push it beneath the bedclothes, but cast aside the plan because he felt that it would be noticed, and quick as thought he tossed the light bundle up on the top of the great canopy of the old-fashioned bedstead, to lie among the gathering of flue and dust.  By that time the footsteps were at the door.  \"What shall I say?\"  Don asked himself; \"she will want to know why I am here.\"  He felt confused, and rack his brains as he would, no excuse would come.  But it was not wanted, for the light footstep with the rustle of silk passed on upstairs, and Don opened the door slightly to listen.  His breath came thickly with emotion as he realised where his mother had gone.  It was to his bedroom door, and as he listened he heard her tap lightly.  \"Don!  Don, my boy!\" came in low, gentle tones.  For one moment the boy's heart prompted him to rush up and fling himself in her arms, but again his worse half suggested that he was to be scolded and disbelieved, and mentally thrusting his fingers into his ears, he stepped out, glided down the staircase in the old boyish fashion of sliding down the banister, snatched his hat from the stand, and softly stole out to hurry down the street as"]]]
