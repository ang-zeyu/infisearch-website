Fisheries (#5)"],["body"," wore on the wind increased until quite a gale was blowing, and the whale-boat began to plunge into the seas, throwing spray every time her nose went into it. The oilskins shone yellow and dripping in the feeble light of a lantern and although it was nearly the end of June a cold wind whipped the icy spume-drift from the breaking whitecaps.  \"Doesn't feel much like summer, Hank!\" said Colin, shivering from cold and fatigue, also partly from reaction following his exciting adventure with the gray whale.  \"Behring Sea hasn't got much summer to boast of,\" the old whaler replied; \"leastwise not often. You may get one or two hot days, but when the sun goes down the Polar current gets in its work an' it's cold.\"  \"Where do you suppose we're going, Hank?\" the boy asked, with a firm belief that the old whaler knew everything. \"I don't like to bother Captain Murchison.\"  \"Nor I,\" the gunner answered, looking toward the stern of the boat; \"let him fight his troubles out alone. As for where we're goin', I don't know. I can't even see the stars, so I don't know which way we're headin'.\"  \"Do you suppose we'll strike Alaska?\" Colin queried. \"Or perhaps the north of Japan? Say, it would be great if we fetched up at Kamchatka or somewhere that nobody had ever been before!\"  The lad's delight in the thought of landing at some inhospitable northern island off the coast of Asia was so boyish that in spite of the discomfort of their present position, the old whaler almost laughed outright.  \"Japan's a long ways south of here,\" he said. \"We'd strike the Aleutian or the Kuril Islands before we got near there. I reckon we ought to try for some place on the Alaska coast, but as I remember, the wind was dead east when we left the _Gull_ an' I don't think it's changed much.\"  Colin gave a long yawn and then shivered.  \"I wouldn't mind being in my berth on the _Gull_!\" he said longingly; \"I'm nearly dead with sleep.\"  \"Why don't you drop off?\" Hank advised. \"There's nothin' you can do to help. Here, change places with me an' you won't get so much spray.\"  \"But you'll get it then!\" the boy protested.  \"If I had a dollar for every time I've got wet in a boat,\" the old whaler answered, \"I wouldn't have to go to sea any more.\"  He got up and made Colin change places.  \"Are you warmer now?\" he asked a minute or two later.  \"Lots,\" the boy murmured drowsily, and in a few seconds he was fast asleep. The old whaler gently drew the boy towards him, so that he would be sheltered from the wind and spray, and held him safe against the rolling and pitching of the little boat. The long hours passed slowly, and Colin stirred and muttered in his dreams, but still he slept on through all the wild tumult of the night, his head pillowed against Hank and the old whaler's arm around him.  He wakened suddenly, with a whistling, roaring sound ringing in his ears. Dawn had broken, though the sun was not yet up, and Colin shivered with the wakening and the cold, his teeth chattering like castanets. A damp, penetrating fog enwrapped them. Four of the sailors were rowing slowly, and the sail had been lowered and furled while he was asleep. Every few minutes a shout could be heard in the distance, which was answered by one of the sailors in the whale-boat.  \"Where's the mate's boat, Hank?\" asked the boy, realizing he had heard only one shout.  \"She got out of hailin' distance, a little while before breakfast,\" the other answered, \"but that doesn't matter so much, because she can't very well get lost now.\"  \"But why is the sail down?\"  The old whaler held up his hand.  \"Do you hear that noise?\" he asked.  \"Of course I hear it,\" the boy answered; \"that's what woke me up. But what is it?\" he continued, as the roar swelled upon the wind.  \"What does it sound like?\" the gunner asked him.  The boy listened carefully for a minute or two and then shook his head.  \"Hard to say,\" he answered. \"It sounds like a cross between Niagara and a circus.\"  Scotty, who had overheard this, looked round.  \"That's not bad,\" he said; \"that's just about what it does sound like.\"  \"But what is the cause of it, Hank?\" the boy queried again. \"I never heard such a row!\"  \"Fur seals!\" was the brief reply.  \"Seals?\" said Colin, jumping up eagerly. \"Oh, where?\"  \"Sit down, boy,\" interrupted the captain sternly; \"you'll see enough of seals before you get home.\"  \"All right, Captain Murchison,\" Colin answered; \"I'm in no hurry to be home.\"  In spite of his recent loss the captain could not help a grim smile stealing over his face at the boy's readiness for adventure, no matter where it might lead. But he had been a rover in his boyhood himself, and so he said no more.  \"Why, there must be millions of seals to make as much noise as that!\" Colin objected.  \"There aren't; at least, not now,\" was Hank's reply. \"There were tens of millions of fur seals in these waters when I made my first trip out here in 1860, but they've been killed off right an' left, same as the buffalo. The government has to protect 'em now, an' there's no pelagic sealin' allowed at all.\"  \"What's pelagic sealing?\" asked Colin.  \"Killing seals at sea,\" the whaler answered. \"That's wrong, because you can't always tell a young male from a female seal in the water, an' the females ought never to be killed. But you'll learn all about it. Beg pardon, sir,\" Hank continued, speaking to the captain, \"but by the noise of the seals those must be either the Pribilof or the Commander Islands?\"  \"Pribilof, by my reckoning,\" the captain answered. \"Do you hear anything of the third boat?\"  \"No, sir,\" answered the old whaler, after shouting a loud \"Ahoy!\" to which but one answer was returned, \"but we'll see her, likely, when the fog lifts.\"  \"Doesn't lift much here,\" the captain said. \"But with this offshore wind, they ought to hear the seals three or four miles away.\"  In the meantime the whale-boat was forging through the water slowly and the noise of the seals grew louder every minute. The sun was rising, but the fog was so dense that it was barely possible to tell which was the east.  \"Funny kind of fog,\" said Colin; \"seems to me it's about as wet as the water!\"  \"Reg'lar seal fog,\" Hank replied. \"If it wasn't always foggy the seals wouldn't haul out here, an' anyway, there's always a lot of fog around a rookery. Must be the breath of so many thousands o' seals, I reckon.\"  [Illustration: SPEARING SEALS AT SEA.  Pelagic sealing by Aleut natives now forbidden by the governments of the United States, Great Britain, Russia, and Japan.  _Courtesy of the U. S. Bureau of Fisheries._]  \"Pretty things, seals,\" said the boy.  \"Where did you ever see any?\" his friend queried.  \"Oh, lots of places,\" Colin answered, \"circuses and aquariums and places like that. I even saw a troupe of them on the stage once, playing ball. They put up a good game, too.\"  \"Those weren't the real fur seals,\" Hank replied; \"what you saw were the common hair seals, an' they're not the same at all. You can't keep fur seals alive in a tank!\"  \"There are two fur seals in the aquarium of the Fisheries Building at Washington,\" interposed the captain, \"but those are the only two.\"  \"There!\" cried the boy, pointing at the water; \"there's one now!\"  \"You'll see them by hundreds in a few minutes, boy,\" the captain said. \"I think I make out land.\"  As he spoke, an eddy of wind blew aside part of the fog, revealing through the rift a low-lying island. Within a minute the fog had closed down again, but the glimpse had been enough to give the captain his bearings. The noise from the seal-rookery had grown deafening, so that the men had to shout to one another in the boat and presently--and quite unexpectedly--the boat was in the midst of dozens upon dozens of seals, throwing themselves out of the water, standing on their hind flippers, turning somersaults, and performing all manner of antics.  \"Why don't we land?\" asked Colin, as he noticed that the boat was running parallel with the shore instead of heading directly for it.  \"Land on a seal-rookery?\" said Hank. \"Haven't you had trouble enough with whales so far?\"  \"Would seals attack a boat?\" asked Colin in surprise.  \"No, you couldn't make 'em,\" was the instant reply, \"but I never heard of a boat landin' at a rookery. The row would begin when you got ashore.\"  Gradually the boat drew closer to the land, as close, indeed, as was possible along the rocky shore, and then the land receded, forming a shallow bay flanked by two low hills on one side and one sharper hill on the other. The captain rolled up his chart and headed straight for the shore.  \"St. Paul, I reckon,\" said Hank, as the outlines of the land showed clearly, \"but I don't jus' seem to remember it.\"  \"Yes, that's St. Paul,\" the captain agreed. \"It has changed since your time, Hank. There has been a lot of building since the government took hold.\"  \"Why, it looks quite civilized!\" exclaimed Colin in surprise, as he saw the well-built, comfortable frame houses and a stone church-spire which stood out boldly from the hill above the wharf.  \"When I first saw St. Paul,\" said the old whaler, \"it looked just about the way it was when the Russians left it--huts and shacks o' the worst kind an' the natives were kep' just about half starved.\"  \"It's different nowadays,\" said the captain as they drew near the wharf, putting under his arm the tin box that held the ship's papers. \"The Aleuts are regular government employees now and they have schools and good homes and fair wages. Everything is done to make them comfortable. I was here last year and could hardly believe it was the same settlement I saw fifteen years ago.\"  It was still early morning when the boat was made fast to the wharf, and Colin was glad to stretch his legs after having slept in a cramped position all night. The damp fog lay heavily over everything, but the villagers had been aroused and the group of sailors was soon surrounded by a crowd, curious to know what had happened. Hank, who could speak a 'pigeon' language"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21008"],["title","The Boy With the U. S. Fisheries (#6)"],["body"," mixed Russian and Aleut, was the center of a group composed of some of the older men, while Colin graphically described to all those who knew English (the larger proportion) the fight with the gray whale, and told of the sinking of the _Gull_ by the big finback, maddened by the attack of the killers. He had just finished a stirring recital of the adventures when the other two boats from the _Gull_ loomed up out of the fog and made fast to the wharf.  Hearing that the only breakfast the shipwrecked men had been able to get was some cold and water-soaked provender from the boat, two or three of the residents hurried to their homes on hospitable errands bent, and in a few minutes most of the men were thawing out and allaying the pangs of hunger with steaming mugs of hot coffee and a solid meal. So, when the captain came looking for Colin that he might take him to the Fisheries agent's house, he found the lad--who was thoroughly democratic in his ways--breakfasting happily with the sailors and recounting for the second time the thrills and perils of the preceding day.  Rejoining the captain an hour or so later at the house to which he had been directed, Colin was effusively greeted by the assistant to the agent, a young fellow full of enthusiasm over the work the Bureau of Fisheries was doing with regard to fur seals. A natural delicacy had kept him from troubling Captain Murchison, but as soon as he discovered that Colin was interested in the question and anxious to find out all he could about seals, he hailed the opportunity with delight.  \"I've just been aching for a chance to blow off steam,\" he said. \"It's an old story to the people here. Obviously! I don't think they half realize how worth while it all is. I'm glad to have you here,\" he continued, \"not only so that we can help you after all your dangers, but so that I can show you what we do.\"  \"I'm still more glad to be here,\" Colin replied, after thanking him. \"I've been trying to persuade Father to let me join the Bureau, but this is such an out-of-the-way place that I never expected to be able to see it for myself.\"  \"It is a little out of the way,\" the official replied. \"But in some ways, I think it's the most important place in the entire world so far as fisheries are concerned. It's the one strategic point for a great industry. Of course!\"  \"Why is it so important, Mr. Nagge?\" Colin queried. \"Just because of the seals, or are there other fisheries here?\"  \"Just seals,\" was the reply, in the jerky speech characteristic of the man. \"Greatest breeding-place in the world. You'll see. Nothing like it anywhere else. And, what's more, it's almost the last. This is the only fort left to prevent the destruction not of a tribe--but of an entire species in the world of life. Certainly!\"  \"Calling it a fort seems strange,\" Colin remarked.  \"Well, isn't it? It's the heroic post, the forlorn hope, the last stand of the battle-line,\" the Fisheries enthusiast replied. \"All the nations of the world were deliberately allowing all the fur seals to be killed off. Uncle Sam stopped it. It's not too late yet. The Japanese seal-pirates must be exterminated absolutely! Could you run a ranch if every time a steer or cow got more than three miles away from the corral anybody could come along and shoot it? Of course not. Obviously!\"  \"But this isn't a ranch!\"  \"Why not? Same principle,\" the assistant agent answered. \"Ranchers breed cattle in hundreds or thousands. We breed seals in hundreds of thousands; yes, in millions. And a fur seal is worth more than a steer. Oh, yes!\"  \"Do seals breed as largely still?\" Colin asked in surprise.  \"Would if they had the chance,\" was the indignant answer. \"Undoubtedly millions and millions have been killed in the last fifty years. Takes time to build up, too! Only one baby seal is born at a time. A run-down herd can't increase so very fast. But we're getting there. Certainly!\"  \"Our gunner was telling me,\" Colin said, \"that killing seals at sea was the cause of all the trouble.\"  \"Yes. Lately. Before that, rookery after rookery had been visited and every seal butchered. Old and young alike. No mercy. Worst kind of cruelty.\"  \"But hasn't the sea trouble been stopped?\" queried the boy. \"I thought it had, but you said something just now about seal-pirates.\"  \"Stopped officially,\" his informant said. \"Can't kill a seal in the ocean, not under any consideration. That is, by law. Not in American waters. Nor in Russian waters. Nor in Japanese waters. Nor in the open sea. International agreement determines that. Of course. But lots of people break laws. Obviously! Big profit in it. There's a lot of killing going on still. Stop it? When we can!\"  \"But how about killing them on land?\" Colin asked. \"You do that, I know, because I've read that the Bureau of Fisheries even looks after the selling of the skins. While it may be all right, it looks to me as though you were killing them off, anyhow. What's the good of saving them in the water if you wipe them out when they get ashore.\"  \"You don't understand!\" his friend said. \"Got anything to do right now?\"  \"Not so far as I know,\" Colin answered.  \"You've had breakfast?\"  \"Yes, thanks,\" the boy answered, \"and I tell you it tasted good after a night in the boat.\"  \"Come over to the rookery,\" the assistant agent said. \"I'm going. I count the seals every day. That is, as nearly as I can. Tell you all about it. If you like, we'll go on to the killing grounds afterwards. Yes? Put on your hat.\"  Colin realized that his host seldom had a listener, and as he was really anxious to learn all that he could about the fur seals, these creatures that kept up the deafening roar that sounded like Niagara, he followed interestedly.  \"Looks a little as if it might clear,\" he suggested, as they left the house. \"We could stand some sunshine after this fog.\"  The other shook his head.  \"Don't want sunshine,\" he said. \"Fog's much better.\"  \"What for?\" asked Colin in surprise. \"Why should any one want fog rather than sunshine?\"  \"Fur seals do,\" was the emphatic response. \"No seals on any other groups of islands in the North Pacific. Just here and Commander Islands. Why?\"  \"Because they are foggier than others?\" hazarded Colin at a guess.  \"Exactly. Fur seals live in the water nearly all year. Water is colder than air. Seals are warm-blooded animals, too--not like fish. They've got to keep out the cold.\"  \"Is that why they have such fine fur?\"  \"Obviously. And,\" the Fisheries official continued, \"under that close warm fur they have blubber. Lots of it.\"  \"Blubber like whales?\"  \"Just the same. Fur and blubber keeps 'em warm in the cold water. Too much covering for the air. Like wearing North Pole clothing at the Equator. If the sun comes out they just about faint. On bright days the young seals make for the water. Those that have to stay on the rookery lie flat on their back and fan themselves. Certainly! Use their flippers just the way a woman uses a regular fan. See 'em any time.\"  Colin looked incredulously at his companion.  \"I'm not making it up,\" the other said. \"They fan themselves with their hind flippers, too. Just as easy.\"  \"I think they must be the noisiest things alive,\" said Colin, putting his fingers in his ears as they rounded the point and the full force of the rookery tumult reached them.  \"The row never stops,\" the assistant agent admitted. \"Just as much at night as daytime. Seals are used to swimming under water where light is dimmer. Darkness makes little difference. Seemingly! Don't notice it after a while.\"  \"The queer part of it is,\" the boy said, listening intently, \"that there seem to be all sorts of different noises. It's just as I said coming into the bay, it sounds like a menagerie. I'm sure I can hear sheep!\"  \"Can't tell the cry of a cow fur seal from the bleating of an old sheep,\" was the reply. \"The pup seal 'baa-s' just like a lamb, too. Funny, sometimes. On one of the smaller islands one year we had a flock of sheep. Caused us all sorts of trouble. The sheep would come running into the seal nurseries looking for their lambs when they heard a pup seal crying. The lambs would mistake the cry of the cow seal for the bleating of their mothers.\"  \"Why do you call the mother seal a cow seal?\" asked the boy.  \"Usual name,\" was the reply.  \"Then why is a baby seal a pup?\" asked Colin bewildered. \"I should think it ought to be called a calf!\"  The Fisheries official laughed.  \"Seal language is the most mixed-up lingo I know,\" he said. \"Mother seal is called a 'cow,' yet the baby is called a 'pup.' The cow seals are kept in a 'harem,' which usually means a group of wives. The whole gathering is called a 'rookery,' though there are no rooks or other birds around. The big 'bull' seals are sometimes called 'Sea-Catches' or 'Beachmasters.' The two-year-olds and three-year-olds are called 'Bachelors.' The 'pups,' too, have their 'nurseries' to play in.\"  But Colin still looked puzzled.  \"Our gunner was talking about 'holluschickie'?\" he said. \"Are those a different kind of seal?\"  \"No,\" was the reply, \"that's the old Russian-native name for bachelors. There are a lot of native words for seals, but we only use that one and 'kotickie' for the pups.\"  \"If the cow seals bleat,\" said Colin, \"and the pups 'baa' like a lamb, what is the cry of the beachmaster?\"  \"He makes the most noise,\" the agent said. \"Never stops. Can you hear a long hoarse roar? Sounds like a lion!\"  \"Of course I can hear it,\" the boy answered; \"I thought that must be a sea-lion.\"  \"A sea-lion's cry is deeper and not so loud,\" his friend replied. \"No. That roar is the bull seal's challenge. You're near enough to hear a sort of gurgling growl?\"  \"Yes,\" said Colin, \"I can catch it quite clearly.\"  \"That's a bull talking to himself. Then there's a whistle when a fight is going on. When they're fighting, too, they have a spitting cough. Sounds like a locomotive starting on a heavy grade. Precisely!\"  \"Do they fight much?\" the boy asked.  \"Ever so "]]]
