(I     interrupt myself here to remind you of the obligation I must put     you under not to mention this). For this very interesting     communication, which I had long laboured to get, he fixed the     fourth day, which was last Saturday; but on Friday morning, Mr.     Oswald came, and having given me your letters, he went     immediately to Franklin, to carry some to him. I kept my     appointment at Passy the next morning, and in order to give     Franklin the greatest confidence, and at the same time, too, not     knowing how much Mr. Oswald might have told him, I began with     saying, that though under the difficulty which M. de Ve. and he     himself had made to my full power, it was not the moment as a     politician, perhaps, to make farther explanations till that     difficulty should be relieved; yet, to show him the confidence I     put in him, I would begin by telling him that I was authorized     to offer the independence in the first instance, instead of     making it an article of general treaty. He expressed great     satisfaction at this, especially, he said, because, by having     done otherwise, we should have seemed to have considered America     as in the same degree of connection with France which she had     been under with us; whereas, America wished to be considered as     a power, free and clear to all the world. But when I came to     lead the discourse to the subject which he had promised four     days before, I was a good deal mortified to find him put it off     altogether till he should be more ready; and notwithstanding my     reminding him of his promise, he only answered that it should be     in some days. What passed between Mr. Oswald and me will explain     to you the reason of this disappointment.      Mr. Oswald told me that Lord Shelburne had proposed to him, when     last in England, to take a commission to treat with the American     Ministers; that upon his mentioning it to Franklin now, it     seemed perfectly agreeable to him, and even to be what he had     very much wished; Mr. Oswald adding that he wished only to     assist the business, and had no other view; he mixed with this a     few regrets that there should be any difference between the two     offices; and when I asked upon what subject, he said, owing to     the Buckingham party being too ready to give up everything.      You will observe though, for it is on that account that I give     you this narrative, that this intended appointment has     effectually stopped Franklin's mouth to me; and that when he is     told that Mr. Oswald is to be the Commissioner to treat with     him, it is but natural that he should reserve his confidence for     the quarter so pointed out to him; nor does this secret seem     only known to Franklin; as Lafayette said, laughing, yesterday,     that he had just left _Lord Shelburne's ambassador_ at Passy.     Indeed, this is not the first moment of a separate and private     negotiation; for Mr. Oswald, suspecting, by something that I     dropped, that Franklin had talked to me about Canada, (though,     by the bye, he never had), told me this circumstance as follows.     When he was in England, the last time but one, he carried with     him a paper, entrusted to him by Franklin, under condition that     it should be shown only to Lord Shelburne, and returned into his     own hands at Passy; this paper, under the title of \"Notes of a     Conversation,\" contained an idea of Canada being spontaneously     ceded by England to the Thirteen Provinces, in order that     Congress might sell the unappropriated lands, and make a fund     thereby, in order to compensate the damages done by the English     army, and even those sustained too by the royalists. This paper,     given with many precautions, for fear of its being known to the     French Court, to whom it was supposed not to be agreeable, Mr.     Oswald showed to Lord Shelburne, who, after keeping it a day, as     Mr. Oswald supposes to show to the King, returned it to him, and     it was by him brought back to Franklin.      I say nothing to the proposition itself, to the impolicy of     bringing a strange neighbourhood to the Newfoundland Fishery, or     to the little reason that England would naturally see in having     lost thirteen provinces to give away a fourteenth; but I mention     it to show you an early trace of separate negotiation, which     perhaps you did not before know. Under these circumstances, I     felt very much tempted to go over and explain them to you _vivâ     voce_ rather than by letter, and I must say, with the farther     intention of suggesting to you the only idea that seems likely     to answer your purpose, and it is this: the Spanish Ambassador     will in a day or two have the powers from his Court; the     Americans are here, so are the French; why should you not     consider this then as a Congress in full form, and send here a     person of rank, such as Lord Fitzwilliam, if he would come, so     as to have the whole negotiation in the hands of one person; you     would by that means recover within your compass the essential     part which is now out of it; nor do I see how Lord Shelburne     could object to such an appointment, which would in every     respect very much facilitate the business. Let me press this a     little strongly to you, for another reason: you may depend upon     it, people here have already got an idea of a difference between     the two offices, and consider how much that idea will be     assisted by the embarrassments arising from two people     negotiating to the same purpose, but under different and     differing authorities, concealing and disguising from each other     what with the best intentions they could hardly make known, and     common enough to each. I am almost afraid of pressing this as     strongly as I should, for fear you should think me writing     peevishly; but if I did not state the thing to you in the     situation in which I see it, I should think I was betraying your     interests instead of giving attention to them. I must entreat     you very earnestly to consider this, to see the impossibility of     my assisting you under this contrariety, to see how much the     business itself will suffer if carried on with the jealousy of     these clashing interests, and to see whether it may not all be     prevented by some such single appointment in high rank as that I     mentioned; _au reste_, I cannot but say that I feel much easier     with the hope of making over what remains of this business. I     begin to feel it weighty, and you know how much I dislike the     _publicity_ you packed off to me in that confounded silver box;     I could not bring myself to say anything civil about it in my     last letter, and you ought to give me credit for great     self-denial in not taking this opportunity of telling you my own     story at the Secretary's office, as nothing but the     embarrassment it might give you upon the sudden, prevented me.     Once more, I tell you I cannot fight a daily battle with Mr.     Oswald and _his secretary_; it would be neither for the     advantage of the business, for your interest, or your credit or     mine; and even if it was, I could not do it.      Concluding then the American business as out of the question,     which _personally_ I cannot be sorry for, you surely have but     one of two things to do: either to adopt the proposition of a     new _dignified_ peer's appointment, which being single, may     bring back the business to you by comprehending it all in one;     or Lord Shelburne must have his minister here, and Mr. Fox his;     by doing which, Mr. Fox will be pretty near as much out of the     secret, at least of what is most essential, as if he had nobody     here; and the only real gainers by it will be the other     Ministers, who cannot fail to profit of such a jumble. Besides     which, upon this latter part of the subject, I must very     seriously entreat you not to ask me to keep a situation here, in     no circumstances pleasant, and in none less so than those I have     described. The grievance is a very essential one, the remedy is     Lord Fitzwilliam.      Adieu. I recommend to Lauzun to make all the haste he can, as I     shall not stir a step till you answer this letter, and my step     then will, I hope, be towards you. Sheridan's letter of     suspicion was written, as you see, in the spirit of prophecy. I     owe him an answer, which, by word of mouth or word of letter, he     shall have very soon. The news of the day is, that the Cadiz     fleet, twenty-six of the line and five French, are sailed for     Brest, but I rather imagine they have no authentic account of it     yet.      I enclose to you P. Guemené's offer of some good champagne; if     you choose to have any, tell me what number of bottles, and let     Brooks or somebody let me know how they are to be sent to     England. I don't understand champagne, but this has a good     character.      Adieu. Let Lord Fitzwilliam answer my letter.       MR. FOX TO MR. THOMAS GRENVILLE.      (Private.)      St James's, June 10th, 1782.      Dear Grenville,      I received late the night before last your very interesting     letter of the 4th, and you will easily conceive am not a little     embarrassed by its contents. In the first place, it was not     possible to comply with your injunction of perfect secrecy in a     case where steps of such importance are necessary to be taken;"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20982"],["title","Memoirs of the Courts and Cabinets of George the Third (#7)"],["body","therefore I have taken upon me (for which I must trust to     your friendship to excuse me) to show your letter to Lord     Rockingham, the Duke of Richmond and Lord John, who are all as     full of indignation at its contents as one might reasonably     expect honest men to be. We are perfectly resolved to come to an     explanation upon the business, if it is possible so to do,     without betraying any confidence reposed in me by you, or in you     by others.      The two principal points which occur are the paper relative to     Canada, of which I had never heard till I received your letter,     and the intended investment of Mr. Oswald with full powers,     which was certainly meant for the purpose of diverting     Franklin's confidence from you into another channel. With these     two points we wish to charge Shelburne directly; but pressing as     the King is, and interesting as it is both to our own situations     and to the affairs of the public--which are, I fear,     irretrievably injured by this intrigue, and which must be ruined     if it is suffered to go on--we are resolved not to stir a step     till we hear again from you, and know precisely how far we are     at liberty to make use of what you have discovered. If this     matter should produce a rupture, and consequently become more or     less the subject of public discussion, I am sensible the Canada     paper cannot be mentioned by name; but might it not be said that     we had discovered that Shelburne had withheld from our knowledge     matters of importance to the negotiation? And with respect to     the other point, might it not be said, without betraying     anybody, that while the King had one avowed and authorized     Minister at Paris, measures were taken for lessening his credit     and for obstructing his inquiries by announcing a new intended     commission, of which the Cabinet here had never been apprized.      Do, pray, my dear Grenville, consider the incredible importance     of this business in every view, and write me word precisely how     far you can authorize us to make use of your intelligence. It is     more than possible that, before this reaches you, many other     circumstances may have occurred which may afford further proofs     of this duplicity of conduct; and if they have, I am sure they     will not have escaped your observation. If this should be the     case, you will see the necessity of acquainting me with them as     soon as possible. You see what is our object, and you can easily     judge what sort of evidence will be most useful to us. When the     object is attained--that is, when the duplicity is proved--to     what consequences we ought to drive; whether to an absolute     rupture, or merely to the recal of Oswald and the simplification     of this negotiation, is a point that may be afterwards     considered. I own I incline to the more decisive measure, and so     I think do those with whom I must act in concert.      I am very happy indeed that you did not come yourself: the     mischief that would have happened from it to our affairs are     incredible; and I must beg of you, nay, entreat and conjure you,     not to think of taking any precipitate step of this nature. As     to the idea of replacing you with Lord Fitzwilliam, not only it     would be very objectionable on account of the mistaken notion it     would convey of things being much riper than they are, but it     would, as I conceive, be no remedy to the evil. Whether the     King's Minister at Paris be an Ambassador Extraordinary or a     Minister Plenipotentiary, can make no difference as to the     question. The clandestine manner of carrying on a separate     negotiation, which we complain of, would be equally practicable     and equally blameable if Lord Fitzwilliam was Ambassador, as it     is now that Mr. Grenville is Plenipotentiary. I must therefore     again entreat you, as a matter of personal kindness to me, to     remain a little longer at Paris; if you were to leave it, all     sorts of suspicions would be raised. It is of infinite     consequence that we should have it to say that we have done all     in our power to make peace, not only with regard to what may be     expected from America, but from Europe.      The King of Prussia is certainly inclined to be our friend; but     he urges and presses to make peace if possible. If we could once     bring the treaty to such a point as that, stating the demands on     each side to him, we could have his approbation for breaking it     off, I think it not impossible but the best consequences might     follow; and with regard to North America, it is surely clear to     demonstration, that it is of infinite consequence that it should     be publicly understood who is to blame if the war continues. I     do hope, therefore, that you will at all events stay long enough     to make your propositions, and to call upon them to make others     in return. I know your situation cannot be pleasant; but as you     first undertook it in a great measure from friendship to me, so     let me hope that the same motive will induce you to continue in     it at least for some time.      What will be the end of this, God knows; but I am sure you will     agree with me, that we cannot suffer a system to go on which is     not only dishonourable to us, but evidently ruinous to the     affairs of the country. In this instance, the mischief done by     intercepting, as it were, the very useful information we     expected through you from Franklin, is I fear in a great degree     irremediable; but it is our business, and indeed our duty, to     prevent such things for the future.      Everything in Ireland goes on very well; and I really think     there is good reason to entertain hopes from Prussia and Russia,     if your negotiation either goes on or goes off as it ought to     do.      I can hardly read Monsieur de Guemené's letter, but wish to have     two hundred bottles of the champagne, if there is really reason     to think it good. By the way, I beg you will remember me to     Monsieur de Guemené, and put him in mind of our former     acquaintance in the Rue St. Pierre. If the wine in question is     as good as that he used to rob from Monsieur de Soubise, I shall     be very well satisfied. I will give Brooks directions to     acquaint you with the proper manner of sending it. I am quite     ashamed of dwelling so long upon this, after the very serious     business of this letter; but you know I cannot help being a     friend to the _poor abuses_; and besides, in a political light,     good wine is no mean ingredient in keeping one's friends in good     humour and steady to the cause.      I am,      My dear Grenville,      Yours most affectionately,      C. J. Fox.       MR. THOMAS GRENVILLE TO MR. FOX.      (Private.)      Paris, June 16th, 1782.      Dear Charles,      I received your letter of the 10th by Ogg on the night of the     14th, and would have sent him back as immediately as you seemed     to wish; but having no other messenger to carry M. de     Vergennes's answer, I was obliged to keep him till he could be     the bearer of that likewise.      I can easily conceive the embarrassment occasioned to you by my     letter, and have so much confidence in the honour of the persons     to whom you communicated it, that I am not under the smallest     uneasiness on that account; the explanation, however, that you     wish to come to, certainly has its difficulties; and amongst     them some so sacred, that unless they can be kept altogether     clear, you cannot but agree with me in thinking that they must     be buried at least in silence, though not in oblivion. In order     therefore that you may see into every part of this business, I     will, as you desire, state in the most explicit manner the     circumstances of it, as far as I think they affect any     confidence reposed in me.      In the first place, then, you will have observed, that although     Franklin has actually made me no confidence, owing, as I     believe, without doubt, to the reasons I stated, yet as the     communication he had said he would make to me was of the most     confidential nature, and in full trust that the subjects which     he should mention should not be given as propositions coming     from him, I think it would be a breach of that confidence to     make it known even that he had promised to hold such a     conversation with me; and therefore to charge Lord Shelburne     with having diverted from me that expected communication, would     be to proclaim Franklin's promise to me; which promise, though     it has not been followed up, I cannot think myself at liberty to     quote. The delicacy of Franklin's situation with respect to the     French Court was, as he said, the ground of the caution which he     observed, and which, nevertheless, he was once inclined to risk     in my trust. He would certainly have both to repent and to     complain if anything on my part should lead to betray even the     confidential disposition he had entertained. These reasons you     will, I am sure, agree with me in considering as decisive     against any mention being to be made of the expectations I had     formed from the conversation I was to have had with Franklin.      The Canada paper is not perhaps quite under the same     circumstances. The only knowledge I have of that is from Oswald;     and as I before told you, I had it from him at a moment when I     fancy he apprehended I had heard or should hear of it from     Franklin. No other reason, indeed, can account for his not     mentioning it from the end of April till the 31st of May. He     told it me under no express limitation of confidence: the words     in which he introduced it were, \"I think it right you should     know;\" and I am perfectly sure that he asked from me no     engagement of secrecy, nor do I conceive myself under any with     "]]]
