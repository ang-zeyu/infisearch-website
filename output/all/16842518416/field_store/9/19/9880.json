We trusted entirely to Bracewell's guidance, for before we had gone a mile, I confess I should have had a difficulty in finding my way back again.  \"We are in luck,\" cried Bracewell, as in less than half an hour we caught sight of four head of the wild cattle we were in search of.  As we approached they began pawing on the ground, sticking out their tails and looking anything but amiable.  \"They will charge if we don't take care,\" observed Bracewell.  \"Shout and crack your whips, that will make them show us their flanks.\"  We had, I should have said, our guns in readiness, and a brace of pistols in our belts, so that we were well armed for the encounter with a wild bull, who, looking upon human beings and every other animal as enemies, was a dangerous character to engage.  Bracewell had before instructed us how to act under such ordinary circumstances as were likely to occur.  The cracking of our whips, and our loud shouts, at length frightened the three bulls, and instead of running at us they turned tail and off they went.  \"Tally-ho!\" shouted Bracewell, and we made chase.  Our object was now to overtake them.  Bracewell having got up to a powerful red bull, for a few seconds he and the animal kept time together; then gaining a little and keeping it on his right side he fired, and the superb beast, with a low bellow, crashed headlong to the ground.  Pulling up for a moment he galloped after me, as I dashed on close to another bull I had singled out; but in consequence of a fallen tree which would have compelled me to slacken speed, I had ranged up on the wrong side, so that I could not fire with due effect.  Fearing however that the bull would escape, I took the best aim I could, fired, and wounded it.  The bull, maddened with rage, charged wildly at my horse.  \"Spur for your life,\" shouted Bracewell.  I did so, for I expected every moment to see the bull rip open my steed with his powerful horns, and I knew that if it was gored I might be trampled to death.  The bull came thundering behind me and actually touched my horse, which nearly sent me over its head as it kicked out viciously to defend itself.  Happily Bracewell was close behind, and coming up presented the muzzle of his pistol at the bull's head.  The next moment I was safe. In the meantime Guy had been pursuing a third bull.  I had heard him fire twice.  I now saw the animal rushing on, with head down, about to run at him.  Fortunately a tree was near at hand, round which he managed to guide his horse, when the bull for a moment losing sight of him he was able to take a steady aim: he fired and the monster rolled over.  \"Nervous work!\" exclaimed Bracewell.  \"You fellows have behaved capitally, though I really forgot the danger to which you might be exposed, but I am very thankful that no harm has been done.  We'll now ride back as hard as we can go, and get the cart to bring in the meat before the dingoes or black fellows or the ants have taken possession of it.\"  We agreed that hunting wild cattle was more exciting sport than galloping after kangaroos, although we fancied that the latter was the finest amusement to be found in Australia.  Not a moment was lost on our arrival at home in getting the cart under way, and Guy and I undertook to accompany it, but Bracewell could not again leave the station during the time that old Bob who drove it, and Toby who went to assist him, were away.  As we approached the scene of action, we caught sight of a number of what at a distance I should have fancied were ordinary dogs-- with sharp muzzles, short, erect ears, and bushy tails--hovering round the spot.  \"They're dingoes!\" cried Guy.  \"The rascals have already commenced operations on one of the bulls.  We must drive them off or old Bob won't have much meat to carry home.\"  We dashed at the brutes with our riding-whips, which we brought into active play.  Some well-aimed lashes on their backs made the dingoes turn tail and retreat to a safe distance, where they stood watching the operation of cutting up one of the animals.  While we were assisting Bob and Toby to load the cart with the flesh of the first bullock, the dingoes made a sudden dash at the carcase of the animal on which they had before commenced.  This was more than we could stand.  \"If I was you, sir, I'd give them a lesson they'll not forget,\" cried Bob; and throwing ourselves on our horses, we rode at the savage pack, using the butts of our whips with such good effect that we knocked over upwards of half a dozen before the rest of the pack took to flight.  To prevent their returning, we pursued them as they went off in the direction of the station, when, firing our pistols, we brought down two or three more; but we were soon thrown behind by having to pull up and reload, and the pack, keeping wonderfully well together, again managed to distance us.  Still, excited by the chase, we kept on, the dead dingoes marking the course we had taken.  Our horses, having been somewhat tired by the chase after the wild cattle and the rides to and from the station, did not make as good play as they might otherwise have done.  Neither Guy nor I thought of pulling up, however, while we had the chance of killing more of the brutes.  At last my horse, stumbling, threw me over his head, and I lost the rein; when finding himself at liberty, away he galloped, showing no inclination to be caught.  I shouted to my brother, who had got some distance on; he heard me, and seeing what had occurred went in chase of my steed, which by occasionally doubling and then galloping off again, well-nigh tired out his horse.  I ran here and there hoping to catch the animal, but it took good care to avoid me.  At length however Guy got hold of it, by which time, of course, the pack had escaped.  We now had to consider what road we should take, but when we looked round we found it was a question difficult to decide.  \"If we could but come across one of the dead dingoes, we could easily make our way back to where we left old Bob,\" observed Guy.  We felt sure that the last dingo we had killed could not be far off.  \"This is the spot where my horse threw me, and I had just before knocked over a dingo,\" I said, \"I know it by that peculiar-looking gum-tree.\"  We rode on, expecting to come upon the dead dingo, but though we searched about we could nowhere discover it.  On and on we went, still no dingoes could we see, nor could we distinguish the track made by our horses' feet.  The sky had become overcast, but though we could not see the sun, we knew that it must be near setting.  In a short time the increasing darkness made us feel somewhat uncomfortable about the chance of being benighted.  We cooeyed as loudly as we could in the hope that Bob and Toby would hear our voices, but no answer reached us.  Had we been riding horses belonging to the station, we might have let them select their course and they would probably have taken us in; but we had mounted our own beasts, which could not be depended on.  Still, as long as there was light sufficient to enable us to avoid knocking our heads against the boughs of trees, we rode on, hoping that we might at length reach the station. At last, however, we agreed that we must make up our minds to spend the night in the bush, hungry and thirsty as we felt.  Next morning we thought we should, at all events, easily find our way.  We accordingly dismounted, hobbled our horses, collected materials for a fire, and choosing a spot free from grass we soon kindled a flame, though it rather mocked us as we had nothing to cook at it.  We settled that one should keep watch and look after the horses.  The poor animals were suffering from thirst as much as we were, and were continually moving away to look for water, for without it they showed little inclination to crop the grass.  Had we thought it prudent for both of us to sleep, the night would have appeared to pass by much more quickly than it did.  I was very thankful when at length day broke, and we were saluted by the merry call of the laughing-jackass.  We did not shoot him, but we killed a couple of parrots, which we quickly roasted to satisfy the gnawings of hunger, and then mounting our horses made, as we thought, in the direction of the station.  We felt especially vexed with ourselves for losing our way, and causing Bracewell the anxiety he would naturally feel on our account, though he would guess pretty clearly what had happened from the report old Bob would give him on his return.  We had gone some distance, when we caught sight of a fire and a column of smoke rising, in the morning air.  \"Perhaps that is the camp of some people Bracewell has sent out to look for us,\" said I.  \"It may be that of bushrangers,\" observed Guy.  \"It will be prudent, at all events, to approach it cautiously.\"  Riding on, we caught sight of a black figure with his back towards us, seated before a small fire at which he was apparently engaged in cooking something.  His attention absorbed in his occupation, he did not observe us.  The delicate morsel he was preparing for his meal was, we afterwards discovered, a large snake.  When his ear at length caught the sound of horses' feet, he started up, and seizing the half-roasted snake, scampered off.  Had we not made signs to him that we wished to be friends, he would soon have been out of sight.  Seeing, however, that we did not unsling our rifles, he gained courage and returned to the fire.  We beckoned to him to continue roasting his snake, and then endeavoured to make him understand that we wanted a guide to conduct us to the station.  He seemed determined not to understand our wishes.  However, we waited patiently, hoping that when he had eaten his snake he might be more inclined to act as our guide.  Finding that we had no intention of molesting him, he took things leisurely.  The snake being roasted, he began to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21383"],["title","Adventures in Australia (#6)"],["body","it away.  \"I wonder he doesn't offer us some, though I'm not inclined to eat it,\" I observed.  \"He is a perfect savage, and has no wish to part with his dainty fare,\" replied Guy.  We thought that the fellow would soon come to an end of the meal, and that then he would pack up the rest of the snake and carry it with him. To our surprise he did not stop until he had swallowed the whole of it, and when we again made signs to him that we wanted him to guide us, he stroked his stomach and signified that he should prefer sleeping by the side of his fire.  Guy at length, losing patience, gave a flourish with his stock whip, when an idea seemed suddenly to strike the black, and getting up he made signs to us to follow him.  We naturally supposed that he intended to lead us to the station, and rode after him without hesitation.  We had not gone far, however, when a cooee reached our ears.  We replied, and presently, looking round in the direction from whence the sound came, we saw Bracewell galloping towards us, followed by Toby.  \"I am thankful that I found you sooner than I expected,\" he said. \"Where do you think you were going?\"  \"To the station,\" answered Guy.  \"You were riding, however, in an opposite direction,\" said our friend.  \"The black we fell in with, undertook to guide us,\" I remarked.  \"The rascal had no intention of taking you to my station.  He would probably have led you into the midst of a gang of his own people who, I have had notice, are encamped in the neighbourhood, and had they found you unprepared they might have speared you for the sake of your horses and clothes.  The fellow you fell in with was probably one of their scouts who had been sent forward to ascertain what we were about. Should they have found us off our guard, they might have robbed the huts and carried off some of our cattle and sheep.\"  While Bracewell was speaking, I looked round and found that the black fellow had disappeared.  This strongly corroborated the account our friend had given us.  As we were suffering greatly from thirst, we were anxious to get back as soon as possible.  We had, we found, gone at least ten miles out of our way.  Bracewell had, however, with the aid of Toby, traced us.  Though our horses were tired, their eagerness to obtain water made them exert themselves, and they did not take long to cover the ground.  Most thankful we were when we reached the stream close to the station, where we and they could take a good draught of the refreshing fluid.  We then, by our friend's advice--while old Bob was preparing dinner-- turned into our bunks and managed to get a sound snooze, awaking much refreshed.  Next morning we had completely recovered from the fatigues we had gone through, and we now felt that we ought to continue our journey to Mr Strong's.  \"But I don't like you two fellows, with only Toby, to travel through the bush, with a chance of falling in with hostile blacks or those rascally bushrangers, who would only be too glad to stick you up and revenge themselves for your setting me free,\" said Bracewell.  \"I have given notice to the police that the latter gentlemen are abroad, and before long, clever as they may think themselves, they will be run to earth; but the blacks are far more difficult customers to deal with--they are here, there, and everywhere.  One only knows where they have been when the cattle are found speared, or the hut-keeper murdered, or the sheep driven off.  I should like to accompany you myself, but I cannot at present leave my station.  However, if you will wait for a couple of days longer I will ride part of the way with you, and in the meantime we will try to ascertain the whereabouts of the mob of blacks, and I shall be able to judge whether the road will be safe for you to travel.\"  The two days passed by pleasantly enough, during which we rode round the station with Bracewell, to assist him in examining his sheep and to help in the various duties of a squatter's life.  Meantime, Toby and another native were sent out to ascertain what had become of the mob of blacks reported to be in the neighbourhood.  They came back saying that, although they had come upon their tracks, the natives had moved away westward, and that we were not likely to fall in with them.  We again, accordingly, told our host that we must go.  \"Well, if you must, you must; and according to my promise I intend to ride part of the way with you,\" he answered.  \"I wish however that you could do without your baggage, and we would see how fast we could get over the ground; but as you have to take that, we must be content with a steady pace, and I'll make play on my way back so as to be at home again by night.\"  As there was a moon in the sky, and Bracewell knew every inch of the ground, we were in our saddles long before day-break, carrying with us our breakfast and kettle in which the tea could easily be made at the camp-fire.  We had performed some ten or twelve miles before sunrise, enjoying the cool fresh air of early morning, and fresh it is even in Australia before the burning sun gains his power over the world.  We camped near a water-hole, from which we obtained all the fluid we required for our morning's meal.  We had again mounted and were going round on the opposite side, when Bracewell exclaimed--\"The blacks have been here.  See, here are the remains of their fire still smouldering. They cannot have left it very long.  We must keep a look-out for them when passing any spot from which they may hurl their lances should they be badly disposed; not that that is likely to be the case, and they certainly will not venture to attack us in the open.\"  Toby, who had examined the ground, gave it as his opinion that they had gone away to the northwards and that, being probably on a hunting expedition, they would be too intent on attacking their game to annoy us.  Toby was right, and in about half an hour, just as we reached the top of a slight ridge or elevation which had before hidden them from view, we caught sight of several dusky figures, each holding in his hand a throwing-stick with a long spear attached to it.  One of them had fixed to his left arm a shield of boughs which concealed his body as he crept towards a group of kangaroos feeding in the grassy bottom.  As the hunters did not perceive us and we had time, we stood still watching them.  The throwing or throw-stick, is to serve the purpose of a sling for casting the spear.  A heavy flat piece of wood, between two and three feet long, has at one end a slight hollow into which the end of the spear is fitted while at the other is a heavy weight, thus assisting the hunter in the act of throwing the spear.  Except a small fillet of grass the natives wore not a particle of clothing, though there were several scarifications on their bodies; and what sailors call a spritsail-yard run through their nostrils which added to the ferocity of their appearance.  As we wanted to see how they would proceed, we kept as much as possible behind the ridge, and as the wind came from the kangaroos to us, we were not discovered by the animals.  All this time the hunters were creeping forward, concealing themselves among the shrubs and trees until they got near enough to the game to hurl their spears with effect.  One fellow crept forward, holding his shield of boughs, until it seemed to us that he was almost close up to the kangaroos.  Then his spear flew from his throwing-stick with so tremendous a force that the animal was almost pinned to the ground.  Not a spear missed, and almost at the same moment three kangaroos were killed.  Three others hopped away, but were pursued by the nimble-footed hunters, who using their throwing-sticks as clubs, despatched the animals with reiterated blows on the head.  Not until the hunt was over did we show ourselves, when we astonished the savages standing over their slain game.  Fixing their spears in their sticks they threatened to launch them against us should we attempt to deprive them of their prizes.  On seeing this we directed Toby to say that we had no intention of interfering with them.  Whether or not they understood him, however, we could not tell, for they stood without altering their position, and not wishing to have an encounter with them which must have ended in bloodshed, we made a wide circuit beyond the reach of their weapons.  When we looked back we saw them joined by a large number of their fellows who were employed in dragging off the bodies of the kangaroos.  \"I am afraid you will be in some danger from them on your return,\" I observed to Bracewell.  \"No fear of that,\" he answered.  \"They will be too busy in gorging themselves with the flesh of the kangaroos; besides they will not be on the look-out for me, and a well-mounted man, provided he doesn't come unexpectedly on a mob, need have no fear of them.  My rifle can carry farther than their throwing-sticks, a fact of which they are well aware.\"  We soon lost sight of the blacks, and after riding on several miles further, our friend told us that he must bid us farewell, promising, however, to ride over to Mr Strong's station, should he find he could leave home, to see how we were getting on.  \"And remember,\" he added, \"I shall be glad if one or both of you can join me, should you not find yourselves comfortable at your relative's; and if he has moved on, as he intended doing, to another station, come back if you think fit at once; though probably, if he expects you, he will have left word that you may be forwarded on to him.  He has, I understand, a large family, but as we have never met I cannot give you a description of them.  I need not warn you to keep as good a watch at night as you have hitherto done, and to avoid either blacks or suspicious looking white men, though I do not mean to say that you are to look upon every traveller you meet with as a bushranger.\"  We having again thanked Bracewell for his advice and the hospitality he had shown us, he"]]]
