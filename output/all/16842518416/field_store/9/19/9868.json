Into this I was put, and, after a tiresome journey over some of the worst roads I had ever seen in my life, I arrived here last night, having enjoyed a three months' holiday to my great satisfaction.  Here, then, I am, waiting for death or peace to release me.  I shall now finish your box if you are not too offended with me for neglecting your commission so long.  I may tell you that Mademoiselle P--- was here this morning; tears were in her lovely eyes, and she seemed very glad to see me back, at which I somewhat wondered, especially if she esteemed me.  I should have thought she would rather have relished my escaping altogether, than being again caught.\"  Here ends Durand's narrative.  My father appends a note to the effect that, through the intervention of Sir Edward Cunliffe, one of the members for Liverpool, Durand was released from the Tower, and went to reside with Mr. P--- in Dale-street. At the date of September following there is a memorandum to the effect that M. Durand and Miss P--- had become man and wife, so that, as my father quaintly adds, he supposes M. Durand had by that time found out why it was that old P---'s niece was so glad to see him again in prison.  The House of Correction stood at the back of the present Fever Hospital, the entrance being in Mount Pleasant.  It was in Mr. Howard's time a most miserably managed place.  In 1790 it was a vile hole of iniquity.  There was a whipping-post, for instance, in the yard, at which females were weekly in the receipt of punishment.  There was also \"a cuckstool,\" or ducking tub, where refractory prisoners were brought to their senses, and in which persons on their first admission into the gaol were ducked, if they refused or could not pay \"a garnish.\"  This barbarous mode of punishment was common in Lancashire, and Cheshire.  This prison was in the course of the following years much improved, as it was found by Mr. Neild very clean and orderly through the exertions of Mrs. Widdows, the keeper.  Mrs. Widdow's salary was 63 pounds per annum.  She had resolutely put down the cuckstool, and the whipping-post was becoming in a complete state of desuetude.  A pump in the men's yard was used as a place of occasional punishment for the stubborn and refractory.  The prisoners were without any instruction, secular or religious.  No chaplain attended.  The allowance to each prisoner was a two-penny loaf, two pounds of potatoes, and salt daily.  I believe, from all I could learn, that the Liverpool prisons, bad as they undoubtedly were at the close of the last and the beginning of the present century, were in better condition than others elsewhere.     CHAPTER III.   One of my great-grandsons--a fine young fellow, has joined the Volunteers: and seems determined to work his way to a commission.  I cannot help smiling when I see him in his uniform, for he reminds me of my young days, when I was a full private in Pudsey Dawson's Liverpool Volunteers.  I don't think the volunteers of this day are so smart-looking as they were of olden time, when they wore blue coats, white breeches, gaiters and pig-tails, and used pipe-clay in abundance. When we were reviewed on Moss-Lake Fields we made a gallant show.  There are fine young fellows now, but somehow the dark rifle-dress looks sombre and dull.  Pudsey Dawson's regiment consisted of eight companies of infantry, and mustered 1200 strong.  The mettle of the Liverpool men was shown in 1797, for some time about the end of February or the beginning of March, in that year the whole town was put into the utmost fright, confusion and excitement.  Two French frigates having landed in Cardigan Bay upwards of 2,000 men, it was reported in Liverpool (the report being traced to the master of a little Welsh coasting smack, who had come from Cardigan) that the French were marching on to Liverpool to burn, sack and plunder it, in revenge for the frigates which had been launched from her yards, and the immense losses sustained by the French mercantile marine through the privateers that hailed from this port.  Owing to the low state of education then prevalent amongst the lower--and, indeed, in the middle classes--very few knew where Cardigan Bay was situated and I very much question whether, if a map of Europe, or of England and Wales, had been shown, nine people out of ten could, without much difficulty, have pointed out the place.  But that the French had landed in Cardigan Bay was a known fact; and it was firmly believed that they were on their way to Liverpool, destroying every thing on their march.  It was fully believed also that the privateers which swarmed out of our docks were the cause of this exhibition of ill-feeling towards us.  It may be fairly stated that the enormous sums obtained by captures from the enemy by Liverpool privateers proved the main foundation-stone of the present great prosperity of the port.  I must say I was and am proud of my fellow townsmen's spirit in '97, and their show of pluck.  No sooner was the report current that the French might be expected, than meetings took place at which his Worship the Mayor and the authorities generally, exhibited the most lively feeling towards supporting their fellow citizens in their intention of defending the port, their homes, and hearths, from the ruthless invaders. Men, money, and arms, came forth freely, and even boys--mere lads--urgently begged to be allowed to join the ranks of England's bold defenders.  But I must not conceal the fact that, in many cases, great cowardice was exhibited; as, when the report got current and the cry was rife that \"the French were coming\"--a cry that used to frighten naughty children to the verge of terror--numbers of the inhabitants became panic-struck, and actually packed up their furniture and valuables, and commenced a hasty exodus believing that they would be safer inland than by the seaboard.  I saw cartload after cartload of goods, toiling up Prescot-road, Brownlow-hill, Mount Pleasant, Oldhall-street, and Preston-road, accompanied by weeping and terrified women and children, with the deepest anxiety exhibited on their countenances.  The outskirt roads were like a fair.  It will scarcely be believed that the price of cartage rose so high while the panic lasted, that fabulous sums were asked and obtained for transporting goods out of town.  It at length became impossible to obtain a vehicle of any description.  Hundreds of persons might be seen camping along the high roads at some distance from the town, anxiously awaiting the expected sound of cannon, the clash of arms, and the cry of contending men.  I laugh at this now--but it was no laughing matter then.  I recollect one day passing down Dale-street (then a narrow, inconvenient thoroughfare) to muster, when the Warrington and Manchester coach was about to start: numbers of frightened people besieged it and attempted to turn out and off those who had obtained possession of its lumbering inside and its miserable basket behind.  In it I remember was seated a tremendous man, a town councillor, who fairly roared and cried like a child because the driver would not hasten his departure--the cry of \"the French\" annihilated him, and I had half a mind to let off my fire-lock and see what the result would have been.  We were not much addicted to punctuality in those good old times; so that half an hour's delay in the starting of a coach was held as nothing very important--the delay however seemed a year to the worthy magnate.  In the town the utmost excitement prevailed.  At the Pier Heads, at the Fort, and in St. Nicholas's churchyard (in the lower part of which there was a battery of six guns) might have been seen hundreds of stalwart fellows strengthening the fortifications; men in and out of uniform were marching through the town with drum and fife, some armed and some unarmed, coming and going from or to the rendezvous.  The jolly sailors in the port mustered strong, and hearty were their demonstrations of enthusiasm.  The shops were shut in many of the streets, while barricades were prepared at the street ends leading out of town, ready to be put up at any moment.  Information was then so slow in its journeyings that falsehood became as strong-looking as truth, and it was easy to keep up a ferment for some time.  Any atom of news became a mountain, until the fresh air of truth melted it away.  We were therefore kept for days in a state of great excitement, and it certainly was some time before our warlike spirit subsided, and I must say that although we were somewhat laughed at for our extraordinary haste in coming to the conclusions we did, we had nothing to be ashamed of.  We Liverpool men showed our pluck on that and many other occasions during the French war.  I fear we were a little too much alive.  We had too much pugnacity about us if anything. I recollect some poor simple looking French fishermen in that year put into Liverpool, in order to sell some oysters, when it was all once taken for granted that they were spies, sent to ascertain what we were doing. The mayor at a meeting held to consider the state of the harbour-defences, actually alluded to these poor fishermen as having in their possession the soundings and bearings of the harbour and river-entrance.  I, for one, did not believe in their being spies, never having seen such a lot of harmless, stupid-looking men.  About this period the press-gang was very actively engaged in taking men for the navy.  These gangs were made up of the very worst and most violent men in the service.  They were by no means particular whom they took: to them a man was a man, and that was a sufficient reason for securing him.  Cases of horrible cruelty and great hardship frequently occurred to individuals.  Men were constantly torn from their homes, wives, and families, without a moment's warning.  They disappeared and were not heard of for years, or perhaps not at all.

Mr Rogers is a British settler in South Africa, a \"cottage farmer\".  The earlier Dutch farmers and settlers are called Boers.  The two teenage sons, Jack and Dick, have often asked if they could all go out on a trek to visit the northern parts of the country, for a natural history collecting expedition.  They had come out to South Africa for the health of Mrs Rogers, but she had died, and of the two boys, Dick was not very strong, while Jack was very robust.  Off they go, together with two Zulu boys who live on their land, the Zulu boys' father, who is a Chieftain whom they nickname \"The General\", and an Irish cook, who is always getting into trouble in every situation, in a most infuriating manner.  There is also Peter the driver, and Dirk who is a foreloper, the man who walks ahead of the oxen to guide them into the best way.  They expect to pay for the trip with ivory from elephants, feathers from ostriches, animal skins, etc.  The various adventures include encounters with snakes, rhino, hippo, giraffes, elephants, crocodiles, cataracts, tsetse fly, marauding native tribes, a bush fire, hundreds of miles of dreary grinding effort taking many months just to cover the ground, scorching heat, and sometimes cold.  And more besides.  As usual with this author there is sustained tension throughout the book.  An interesting and instructive book.  ________________________________________________________________________  OFF TO THE WILDS, BEING THE ADVENTURES OF TWO BROTHERS, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.   CHAPTER ONE.  COFFEE AND CHICORY, BUT NOT FOR BREAKFAST.  \"Just look at him, Dick.  Be quiet; don't speak.\"  \"Oh, the dirty sunburnt little varmint!  I'd like the job o' washing him.\"  \"If you say another word, Dinny, I'll give you a crack with your own stick.\"  \"An' is it meself would belave you'd hurt your own man Dinny wid a shtick, Masther Jack?  Why ye wouldn't knock a fly off me.\"  \"Then be quiet.  I want to see what he's going to do.\"  \"Shure an' it's one of the masther's owld boots I threw away wid me own hands this morning, because it hadn't a bit more wear in it.  An' look at the dirty unclane monkey now.\"  \"He'll hear you directly, Dinny, and I want to see what he's going to do.  Hold your tongue.\"  \"Shure an' ye ask me so politely, Masther Jack, that it's obliged to be silent I am.\"  \"Pa was quite right when he said you had got too long a tongue.\"  \"Who said so, Masther Jack?\"  \"Pa--papa!\"  \"Shure the masther said--and it's meself heard him--that you was to lave your papa at home in owld England, and that when ye came into these savage parts of the wide world, it was to be father.\"  \"Well, father, then.  Now hold your tongue.  Just look at him, Dick.\"  \"It's meself won't spake again for an hour, and not then if they don't ax me to,\" said Dennis Riley, generally known as \"Dinny,\" and nothing more.  And he, too, joined in watching the \"unclane little savage,\" as he called him, to wit, a handsome, well-grown Zulu lad, whose skin was of a rich brown, and who, like his companion, seemed to be a model of savage health and grace.  For there were two of these lads, exceedingly lightly clad, in a necklace, and a strip of skin round the loins, one of whom was lying on his chest with his chin resting upon his hands, kicking up his feet, and clapping them together as he watched the other, who was evidently in a high state of delight over an old boot.  This boot he had found thrown out in the fenced-in yard at the back of the cottage, and he was now seated upon a bank trying it on.  First, he drew it on with a most serious aspect, held out his leg and gave it a shake, when, finding the boot too loose, he took it off and filled the toe with sand; but as the sand ran out of a gap between the upper leather and the sole close to the toe and as fast as he put it in, he had to look out for something else, which he found in the shape of some coarse dry grass.  With this he half filled the boot, and then, with a good deal of difficulty, managed to wriggle in his toes, after which he drew the boot above his ankle, rose up with a smile of gratified pride upon his countenance, and began to strut up and down before his companion.  There was something very laughable in the scene, for it did not seem to occur to the Zulu boy that he required anything else to add to his costume.  He had on one English boot, the same as the white men wore, and that seemed to him sufficient, as he stuck his arms akimbo, then folded them as he walked with head erect, and ended by standing on one leg and holding out the booted foot before his admiring companion.  This was too much for the other boy, whose eyes glittered as he made a snatch at the boot, dragged it off, and was about to leap up and run away; but his victim was too quick, for, lithe and active as a serpent, he dashed upon the would-be robber, and a fierce struggle ensued for the possession of the boot.  John Rogers, otherwise Jack, a frank English lad of about sixteen, sprang forward to separate the combatants, but Dinny, his father's servant, who had been groom and gardener at home, restrained him.  \"No, no, Masther Jack,\" he cried, \"let the young haythens fight it out. It'll make them behave betther by-an'-by.\"  \"I won't; I don't like to see them fight,\" cried Jack, slipping himself free, and seemingly joining in the fray.  \"Don't, Masther Jack,\" cried Dinny; \"they'll come off black on your hands.  Masther Dick, sir, tell him to lave them alone.\"  The lad appealed to, a pale delicate-looking youth, clenched his fists and sprang forward to help his brother.  But he stopped directly and began to laugh, as, after a short scuffle, Jack Rogers separated the combatants, and stood between them with the boot in dispute.  For a moment it seemed as if the two Zulu lads were about to make a combined attack, but there was something about the English lad which restrained them, and they stood chattering away in their native tongue, protesting against his interference, and each laying claim to the boot.  \"Speak English,\" cried Jack.  \"And now you two have got to shake hands like Englishmen, and make friends.\"  \"Want a boot! want a boot! want a boot!\" the Zulu lads kept repeating.  \"Well, you do as I tell you, and you shall each have a pair of boots.\"  \"Two boot?  Two boot?\" cried the boy who had lost his treasure.  \"Yes; two boots,\" said Jack.  \"You've got an old pair, haven't you, Dick?\"  \"Yes; they can have my old ones,\" was the reply.  \"Go and get them, Dinny.\"  \"And my old lace-ups too,\" said Jack.  \"Ugh!\" ejaculated Dinny, spitting on the ground in token of disgust. \"Ye'll both repint being such friends with cannibal savages like them, young gentlemen.  They'll turn round on ye some day, and rend and ate ye both.\"  \"Not they, Dinny,\" laughed Jack.  \"They'd prefer Irishmen, so we should be safe if you were there.\"  \"Ah, ye may laugh,\" said Dinny, \"but they're a dangerous lot, them savages, and I wouldn't trust 'em the length of my fut.\"  Dinny went towards the back door of Mr Rogers' roomy, verandah-surrounded cottage farm, high up in the slopes of the Drakensberg, and looking a perfect bower with its flowers, creepers, and fruit-trees, many being old English friends; and Jack proceeded to make peace between the two Zulu boys.  \"Now look here, Sepopo, you've got to shake hands with your brother,\" he cried.  \"No!\" cried the Zulu boy who had been lying down when he snatched the boot, and he threw himself in a monkey-like attitude on all fours.  \"Now you, Bechele, you've got to make friends and shake hands,\" continued Jack, paying no heed to Sepopo's defiant attitude.  \"No!\" cried the last-addressed, emphatically.  \"'Tole a boot!  'Tole a boot!\"  And he too plumped himself down upon all fours and stared at the ground.  \"I say yes!\" cried Jack; when, as if moved by the same influence, the two Zulu boys leaped up, ran a few yards, and picked up each his \"kiri,\" a short stick with a knob at the end nearly as big as the fist, ran back to where the English lads were standing, and with flashing eyes began to beat the sand with their clubs.  \"Come along, Dick!\" cried Jack.  \"They shan't fight.  You take Sepopo, I'll take Bechele.  No; don't!  It will make you hot, and you're not strong.  I'll give it them both.\"  Jack, who was very strong and active for his age, made a dash at the young Zulus just as they began threatening each other and evidently meaning to fight, when for a few moments there was a confused struggle, in which Jack would not have been successful but for his brother's help, he having overrated his strength.  But Dick joined in, and in spite of their anger the Zulu boys did not attempt to strike at their young masters, the result being that they allowed their kiris to be wrenched from their hands, and the next minute were seated opposite to each other on the ground.  \"They're as strong as horses, Dick,\" panted Jack.  \"There!  Now, you sirs, shake hands!\"  \"No!\" shouted one.  \"No!\" shouted the other; and with a make believe of fierceness, Jack gave each what he called a topper on the head with one of the kiris he held.  \"Now will you make friends?\" cried Jack; and again they shouted, \"No!\"  \"They won't.  Let them go,\" said Dick, languidly; \"and it makes one so hot and tired.\"  \"They shan't go till they've made friends,\" said Jack, setting his teeth; and thrusting his hand into his pocket he brought out a piece of thick string, the Zulu boys watching him intently.  They remained where Jack had placed them, and going down on one knee he seized the right hand of each, placed them together, and proceeded to tie them--pretty tightly too.  \"There!\" cried Jack.  \"Now you stop till you're good friends once more.\"  \"Good boy now,\" cried one on"]]]
