I was hoping he'd wear one like it this summer.\"  \"Wait!\" was Mr. Red-winged Blackbird's mysterious answer. \"Wait! And I promise you won't be disappointed.\"  \"Anyhow, he sings as well as ever,\" Mr. Meadowlark declared.     IV  SINGING FOR SOME ONE   THE first few days of early May had passed and with them had flitted--somewhere--most of the jolly company in which Bobby Bobolink had journeyed from the South. But a few of those merrymakers had stayed--as Bobby did--in Farmer Green's meadow. They had made up their minds to spend the summer in Pleasant Valley.  Even old Mr. Crow, who was no lover of music, had to admit that he had never heard such bursts of song during all the summers he had spent in the neighborhood. It seemed as if Bobby Bobolink and his companions were trying their best to out-sing one another, though nobody knew why they should do that.  But at last somebody discovered the reason. That rowdy of the woods, Jasper Jay, spied upon the harum-scarum singers one day, when they were all but bursting themselves in a frenzy of song. And he saw that they were giving what Jasper called \"a serenade.\"  They were singing not for themselves but for a dull, yellowish-brown lady of their own sort, who had not arrived from the South until Bobby and his friends had been frolicking about the meadow almost a week.  She seemed a shy creature--this young person--preferring to stay on the ground during the serenade. But Bobby Bobolink and his companions were bold as brass. Often they alighted on the ground near her, as if they thought she could not hear their songs well enough when they skimmed through the air over the grassy meadow. Amid such a jingling and tinkling of notes it was no wonder that the little lady acted somewhat confused.  Jasper Jay, who was almost as great a gossip as Mr. Crow, told everybody in the neighborhood that he had never heard such a hubbub. But then, like his cousin Mr. Crow, Jasper was not a lover of music. And it was true that sprightly Bobby Bobolink and his dashing friends made no attempt to sing together. To be sure, they sang all at the same time; but each one of them sang his own song in his own way, just as if his was the only one that was being sung.  They never tired of entertaining the lady. And whether the yellowish-brown person decided that Bobby Bobolink sang louder than the others, or whether she thought his singing was sweeter or gayer than that of his friends, nobody ever found out. Perhaps he managed to say something--in his song--that especially pleased her. Anyhow, it was only a short time before Bobby Bobolink was making such remarks as these to everybody in the meadow:  \"My wife says I have the quickest eye for a caterpillar that she ever saw!\" and \"Mrs. Bobolink and I expect to begin to build a new house at once!\"  Now, you might think that Bobby's friends, after all their singing for the little lady, would have felt quite glum. But they were not in the least downcast. Of course, Bobby Bobolink would not let them serenade his wife. Indeed he promptly chased them away as soon as he knew that he had won her.  But they were so light-hearted that they started right away to sing for another lady in another part of the meadow.  She was as like the first one as two peas in a pod. And Jasper Jay chuckled when he found out what was going on.  He said he didn't believe they knew the difference.     V  AN INVITATION   MR. MEADOWLARK was a great admirer of Bobby Bobolink. Much as he liked to sing himself, he often remained silent when Bobby's joyous music tinkled over the grass-tops in Farmer Green's meadow. And as Mr. Meadowlark was listening to one of Bobby's best songs one day an idea popped suddenly into his head. He liked this notion so well that he flew straight across the meadow to a thicket on the edge of the woods. And there in the undergrowth he found Buddy Brown Thrasher, who was exactly the person he was looking for.  \"I've come over to tell you about an idea of mine,\" Mr. Meadowlark announced. \"It's about Bobby Bobolink. You know he has come back to spend the summer here in Pleasant Valley. It seems to me he's in better voice than ever. And now that he is quite grown up--you know he has a wife--it seems to me that we couldn't do better than invite him to join the Pleasant Valley Singing Society.\"  Mr. Meadowlark had explained all this in a most eager manner. And he couldn't help being a bit disappointed over the way Buddy Brown Thrasher received it. He did not seem at all excited. To tell the truth, he was a suspicious chap. He never fell in quickly with a new plan, no matter what it might be. And more than once he had made matters somewhat difficult for the Pleasant Valley Singing Society. He was hard to please. Being a very brilliant singer himself, he was never what you might call keen to take in a new member.  When Mr. Meadowlark had told him about his idea Buddy Brown Thrasher gave a sharp whistle, \"Wheeu!\" That was the only remark he made.  \"What's the matter?\" Mr. Meadowlark inquired. \"Don't you like my scheme?\"  \"Oh! It's worth looking into, no doubt,\" Buddy told him. \"But I can't say offhand whether it's a good one or not.... Of course Bobby Bobolink would have to pass the test before we take him into the Singing Society.\"  \"If that's all that's troubling you, cheer up!\" Mr. Meadowlark cried. \"For Bobby Bobolink can pass the singing test as easily as flying.\"  \"I hope so,\" Buddy Brown Thrasher retorted. \"I promise you that I'll be present when Bobby sings before the Society. And if his singing isn't what it ought to be, you can depend on me to know it.\"  Well, Mr. Meadowlark couldn't object to that. So he told Buddy Brown Thrasher that his promise was fair enough. And then Mr. Meadowlark hurried away to call on other members of the Pleasant Valley Singing Society and tell them about his plan.  After he had seen and talked with every one, Mr. Meadowlark took it upon himself to go back to the meadow, where he found Bobby Bobolink still singing merrily. And for once Mr. Meadowlark couldn't wait for him to finish. For there was no knowing when Bobby would stop.  \"You're invited,\" said Mr. Meadowlark, \"to sing before the Pleasant Valley Singing Society. And if you can pass the test you'll become a member.\"  Bobby Bobolink was somewhat doubtful as he listened to Mr. Meadowlark's speech.  \"I'm afraid it will be difficult,\" he said.  \"Oh, no!\" Mr. Meadowlark assured him. \"You can pass the test easily enough.\"  But Bobby Bobolink told him that that wasn't what he meant.  \"I'm afraid,\" he explained, \"my wife may not consent!\"     VI  MRS. BOBOLINK CONSENTS   IT had never occurred to Mr. Meadowlark that Bobby Bobolink's wife might object to her husband's joining the Singing Society. But Bobby seemed doubtful.  \"I'll have to ask her,\" he said. \"You see, we're just about to build ourselves a house. And she may think I ought not to belong to any societies at present.\"  Just then little, yellowish-brown Mrs. Bobolink came skimming over the meadow and dropped down beside them.  \"Would you mind, my love, if I joined the Pleasant Valley Singing Society?\" Bobby asked her.  \"Perhaps you'd like to become a member yourself,\" Mr. Meadowlark suggested nervously.  But Mrs. Bobolink hastened to say that she wasn't musical. \"Of course I enjoy _hearing_ songs,\" she told him; \"but I'm not much of a singer myself.\"  \"Your husband is one of the best,\" Mr. Meadowlark told her hopefully.  \"Yes!\" she replied. \"And sometimes I think he spends almost too much of his time practicing.\"  \"Oh, I can sing and work at the same time,\" Bobby Bobolink declared. \"When we begin work on our new house I shall be singing most of the time.\"  \"How often does your Society meet?\" Mrs. Bobolink asked Mr. Meadowlark.  \"We have a little sing almost every fine day,\" he informed her. \"But your husband needn't come to every meeting--if he's too busy. And if necessary he can leave before our sings are finished--except when he takes the test.\"  \"The test!\" Mrs. Bobolink echoed. \"What's that?\"  Mr. Meadowlark explained that before becoming a member everybody had to sing before the Society. \"Those that don't sing well enough don't get in,\" he added. \"For instance, there's old Mr. Crow. His voice is too hoarse. So he doesn't belong to the Society.\"  Well, the moment she heard that, Mrs. Bobolink made up her mind at once.  \"My husband can pass any singing test that you can give him!\" she exclaimed. \"The idea of mentioning him and Mr. Crow in the same breath!\"  \"Pardon me!\" Mr. Meadowlark said hastily. \"I took several breaths just before I spoke about Mr. Crow.\" He hoped that he hadn't offended Bobby Bobolink's wife.  She wasn't really angry. But she was proud of her husband's voice. And she wanted Mr. Meadowlark to know it.  \"I wouldn't think of such a thing as not letting Bobby join your Society,\" she declared. \"And as soon as we've finished our new house he can go to every meeting you have, and stay till the end, too.\"  All this time Bobby Bobolink had been listening anxiously. And when he heard his wife's last remark he was so overjoyed that he sprang into the air and began to sing the happiest song he knew, while he darted back and forth above the heads of his wife and their caller.  \"Just listen to him!\" Mrs. Bobolink cried, with an air of pride. \"Can you beat that?\"  Mr. Meadowlark made a modest reply. He said that in his opinion Bobby Bobolink was the finest singer that had ever come to Pleasant Valley.  And Mrs. Bobolink was so pleased that she confessed she hoped her husband could take his test just as soon as possible.  \"He shall take it to-morrow!\" Mr. Meadowlark promised.     VII  PASSING THE TEST   THE time had come for Bobby Bobolink to sing before the Pleasant Valley Singing Society. Mr. Meadowlark brought Bobby to the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21412"],["title","The Tale of Bobby Bobolink (#2)"],["body","meeting, along the rail fence between the meadow and the pasture. And he told everybody that there wasn't really any need of such a test.  \"He's by far the finest singer in all these parts,\" Mr. Meadowlark declared.  There were a few who might have disputed his statement, had not Bobby Bobolink been present. They were too polite, however, to do anything like that. But Mr. Meadowlark himself had a voice of remarkable sweetness. And many thought that it couldn't be equalled.  \"Bobby Bobolink will have to sing for us, just like anybody else, before we make him a member of this Society,\" Buddy Brown Thrasher cried, after he had given a whistle, \"Wheeu!\" as if to say that he, for one, doubted Mr. Meadowlark's words. For Buddy Brown Thrasher liked his own singing about as well as any he had ever heard. In the morning, and again at night, he was fond of perching himself on the topmost twig of a tree, where nobody could help seeing him, and singing a song over and over again. It was his favorite song--and the only one he knew. And having practiced it all his life, how he could sing it!  Well, after Buddy Brown Thrasher's remarks there was only one thing to be done. Bobby Bobolink must sing for the Society. And Mr. Meadowlark turned to him and told him that he might begin at once.  So Bobby alighted on the end of a fence-rail and such a torrent of song burst upon the ears of his listeners as they had never heard before. The notes came tumbling so quickly one upon another that most of the members of the Singing Society began to look bewildered. Bobby Bobolink's singing was almost too fast for even their sharp ears.  He hadn't sung long before somebody interrupted him. Somebody called in a loud voice, \"I object!\"  It was Buddy Brown Thrasher that spoke. Bobby Bobolink stopped short in the middle of his song. And at once a great clamor arose, when all the other members asked Buddy what he meant.  \"I mean,\" said Buddy Brown Thrasher, as soon as he could make himself heard, \"I mean that Bobby Bobolink is playing a trick on us. He has about half a dozen of his friends hidden in the pasture. And they're helping him. They're singing with him.\"  Everybody was astonished. And as for Bobby Bobolink, he couldn't seem to say a word for himself.  Luckily he didn't need to. For just then his wife came bustling up and settled herself right in the midst of the Singing Society.  Proud as she was of her husband's voice, she hadn't been able to stay away from the meeting. So she had hovered near-by, where she could hear everything without being seen.  \"Sir!\" she said to Buddy Brown Thrasher. \"Kindly point out these hidden friends of my husband!\"  Buddy Brown Thrasher looked somewhat uneasy.  \"I--I haven't _seen_ anybody in the bushes,\" he stammered.  \"Find them!\" Mrs. Bobolink ordered. Her manner was so stern that Buddy Brown Thrasher did not dare disobey. He searched high and low. But he couldn't find a bird anywhere in the pasture.  \"You see you were mistaken,\" Mrs. Bobolink told him severely.  Everybody agreed with her. And then and there they made Bobby Bobolink a member of the Pleasant Valley Singing Society. There was no doubt that he had sung his song without a bit of help.  \"It was wonderful!\" everybody exclaimed--everybody but Buddy Brown Thrasher. He muttered that it was no wonder he made a mistake, for he didn't know the song himself. And he said it was much too fast for his taste.     VIII  THE HOUSE IN THE MEADOW   BOBBY BOBOLINK and his wife had talked a good deal about the home they were going to have.  And unlike some people, who are forever planning things but never begin the actual doing of them, they soon set to work to build their nest.  First, of course, they had to find a pleasant place for it. So they looked the ground over carefully. Bobby Bobolink favored the exact center of the big meadow building site, for he said that if Johnnie Green ever came into the meadow he was more likely to take a short cut across a corner of it than he was to walk straight through the middle.  \"You may not know,\" he said to his wife, \"that Farmer Green doesn't care to have the grass on the farm trampled down.\"  But Mrs. Bobolink replied that there were other things to think of. She said that she liked to live in a rather moist place--that such a spot was comfortable in hot weather. And furthermore she wanted to be near water. \"If you need a drink on a warm day it's not always convenient to go far out of your way for it,\" she pointed out.  Well, Bobby Bobolink saw at once that Mrs. Bobolink had made up her mind, and there was no use trying to change it. Besides, he wanted to please her.  \"Then, my dear, where would you like to have our house built?\" he asked.  \"I should prefer to settle in the lower end of the meadow, near Cedar Swamp,\" she replied. \"The ground thereabouts is just damp enough to suit me. And there's always plenty of water to drink in the swamp.... Besides,\" she added, \"it's somewhat marshy in that part of the meadow.  \"And you won't find Johnny Green trespassing down there. He might get his feet wet!\"  Bobby Bobolink turned his head away so that his wife wouldn't notice the smile that flitted across his face. He saw that Mrs. Bobolink didn't know Johnnie Green very well.  In summer Johnnie almost always went barefooted. And he never minded getting his feet wet any more than Paddy Muskrat did.  But if his wife wanted their nest near the swamp, Bobby Bobolink was willing to oblige her.  \"Very well!\" he said. \"Let's go down there now and look for the best place to build.\"  So off they flew. And after a careful search they discovered a snug little hollow in the ground that entirely suited them both.  Since the spot was somewhat moist, early in the season as it was the grass grew thick and high all around, making a fine screen to prevent prying eyes from seeing what was to be hidden there.  Having decided on their building site, Bobby Bobolink and his wife began to gather weed stems, leaves and coarse grasses, all left over from the year before and dried by the spring sunshine. Those served for the outside of the nest. As for the inside, they lined that with soft, fine grasses, because they expected to keep something precious in that nest before a great while.     IX  JOHNNIE GREEN INTRUDES   BOBBY BOBOLINK and his wife had finished their new nest.  \"There!\" Mrs. Bobolink exclaimed, as she gave the lining of soft grasses a final pat. \"There's not another thing to be done to it.\"  \"It's perfect!\" Bobby told her. \"But I think I can make one slight improvement, for we mustn't forget Henry Hawk.\" And while his wife looked on somewhat anxiously he bent a few grass stalks over so that they completely hid the nest from anybody passing overhead.  \"Henry Hawk will never spy our nest now,\" Bobby remarked a few minutes later, as he flew back and forth over the spot and tried in vain to catch a glimpse of their new home. \"If I can't see it as near as I am, Henry Hawk will never find it as he sails high above the meadow, for all his eyes are terribly sharp.\"  Mrs. Bobolink then told her husband that his improvement was a fine one. And Bobby was so well pleased that he sang a song for his wife, while she rested from her labors.  After that they flew off and told all their friends that their new home was built. But they didn't invite anybody to a house-warming, for that was not their way. They never so much as told people where their house was hidden. They were afraid that some gossip might drop a hint to old Mr. Crow, or his noisy cousin, Jasper Jay, or perhaps Mr. Blackbird. And later there would be something in the nest that would have made a dainty meal for any one of those rascals. No! Mr. and Mrs. Bobolink did not intend to have their nest robbed of its treasure--not if they could help it!  Now, it was only a short time later that Bobby Bobolink and his wife shared a wonderful secret. Five grayish-white eggs, each quite pointed at one end, lay in their nest. And nobody but themselves was a bit the wiser.  To be sure, the neighbors remarked that Bobby Bobolink was simply bursting with song. He was more musical than ever. But they never dreamed what it was that could make him even happier than he had always been.  At last there came a time when Bobby--though he was just as happy--seemed to have less leisure for singing. And then it was easy for the neighbors to guess the reason for that, because it was plain that the Bobolink family was not gathering great numbers of grasshoppers and caterpillars merely for the fun of it.  Hidden as the little Bobolinks were in the tall grass, no stranger found them. Of course, Mrs. Bobolink went to some trouble to keep the secret of her nest in the family. Whenever she left her home she moved along the ground a little way before rising into view. And when she returned she alighted some distance off and scurried through the grass until she reached home.  By taking such pains she kept others from knowing exactly where her nest was. And nothing had happened to alarm her until one day she caught sight of Johnnie Green. He had come into the meadow to hunt for strawberries. And to Mrs. Bobolink's dismay he was headed straight for her house.     X  FOOLING JOHNNIE GREEN   WHEN Mrs. Bobolink saw Johnnie Green, carrying a tin pail, come walking through the meadow straight towards her house she was terribly frightened. She was not afraid for herself. Her only thought was of her children, who were still too young to leave the nest.  Somehow Mrs. Bobolink felt sure that Johnnie was searching for her nest, for he had his head bent toward the ground, as if he were looking for something. And that bright tin pail! Mrs. Bobolink viewed it with alarm. She just knew that it was meant to carry off her children!  Of course Johnnie Green was only looking for strawberries. But Mrs. Bobolink didn't know that. All at once she remembered how she had objected to having her nest in the very center of the meadow, although her"]]]
