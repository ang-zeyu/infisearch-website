But, then, the radicalness of       these differences, which was excessive; the dirt; the soiled and       torn condition of the paper, so inconsistent with the true       methodical habits of D——, and so suggestive of a design to delude       the beholder into an idea of the worthlessness of the       document—these things, together with the hyper-obtrusive       situation of this document, full in the view of every visitor,       and thus exactly in accordance with the conclusions to which I       had previously arrived; these things, I say, were strongly       corroborative of suspicion, in one who came with the intention to       suspect.        “I protracted my visit as long as possible, and, while I       maintained a most animated discussion with the Minister upon a       topic which I knew well had never failed to interest and excite       him, I kept my attention really riveted upon the letter. In this       examination, I committed to memory its external appearance and       arrangement in the rack; and also fell, at length, upon a       discovery which set at rest whatever trivial doubt I might have       entertained. In scrutinizing the edges of the paper, I observed       them to be more chafed than seemed necessary. They presented the       broken appearance which is manifested when a stiff paper, having       been once folded and pressed with a folder, is refolded in a       reversed direction, in the same creases or edges which had formed       the original fold. This discovery was sufficient. It was clear to       me that the letter had been turned, as a glove, inside out,       re-directed, and re-sealed. I bade the Minister good morning, and       took my departure at once, leaving a gold snuff-box upon the       table.        “The next morning I called for the snuff-box, when we resumed,       quite eagerly, the conversation of the preceding day. While thus       engaged, however, a loud report, as if of a pistol, was heard       immediately beneath the windows of the hotel, and was succeeded       by a series of fearful screams, and the shoutings of a terrified       mob. D—— rushed to a casement, threw it open, and looked out. In       the meantime, I stepped to the card-rack, took the letter, put it       in my pocket, and replaced it by a fac-simile, (so far as regards       externals,) which I had carefully prepared at my       lodgings—imitating the D—— cipher, very readily, by means of a       seal formed of bread.        “The disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic       behavior of a man with a musket. He had fired it among a crowd of       women and children. It proved, however, to have been without       ball, and the fellow was suffered to go his way as a lunatic or a       drunkard. When he had gone, D—— came from the window, whither I       had followed him immediately upon securing the object in view.       Soon afterwards I bade him farewell. The pretended lunatic was a       man in my own pay.”        “But what purpose had you,” I asked, “in replacing the letter by       a fac-simile? Would it not have been better, at the first visit,       to have seized it openly, and departed?”        “D——,” replied Dupin, “is a desperate man, and a man of nerve.       His hotel, too, is not without attendants devoted to his       interests. Had I made the wild attempt you suggest, I might never       have left the Ministerial presence alive. The good people of       Paris might have heard of me no more. But I had an object apart       from these considerations. You know my political prepossessions.       In this matter, I act as a partisan of the lady concerned. For       eighteen months the Minister has had her in his power. She has       now him in hers—since, being unaware that the letter is not in       his possession, he will proceed with his exactions as if it was.       Thus will he inevitably commit himself, at once, to his political       destruction. His downfall, too, will not be more precipitate than       awkward. It is all very well to talk about the facilis descensus       Averni; but in all kinds of climbing, as Catalani said of       singing, it is far more easy to get up than to come down. In the       present instance I have no sympathy—at least no pity—for him who       descends. He is that monstrum horrendum, an unprincipled man of       genius. I confess, however, that I should like very well to know       the precise character of his thoughts, when, being defied by her       whom the Prefect terms ‘a certain personage’ he is reduced to       opening the letter which I left for him in the card-rack.”        “How? did you put any thing particular in it?”        “Why—it did not seem altogether right to leave the interior       blank—that would have been insulting. D——, at Vienna once, did me       an evil turn, which I told him, quite good-humoredly, that I       should remember. So, as I knew he would feel some curiosity in       regard to the identity of the person who had outwitted him, I       thought it a pity not to give him a clue. He is well acquainted       with my MS., and I just copied into the middle of the blank sheet       the words—        “‘— — Un dessein si funeste,       S’il n’est digne d’Atrée, est digne de Thyeste.        They are to be found in Crébillon’s ‘Atrée.’”     THE THOUSAND-AND-SECOND TALE OF SCHEHERAZADE   Truth is stranger than fiction.—_Old Saying_        Having had occasion, lately, in the course of some Oriental       investigations, to consult the Tellmenow Isitsöornot, a work       which (like the Zohar of Simeon Jochaides) is scarcely known at       all, even in Europe; and which has never been quoted, to my       knowledge, by any American—if we except, perhaps, the author of       the “Curiosities of American Literature”;—having had occasion, I       say, to turn over some pages of the first-mentioned very       remarkable work, I was not a little astonished to discover that       the literary world has hitherto been strangely in error       respecting the fate of the vizier’s daughter, Scheherazade, as       that fate is depicted in the “Arabian Nights”; and that the       _dénouement_ there given, if not altogether inaccurate, as far as       it goes, is at least to blame in not having gone very much       farther.        For full information on this interesting topic, I must refer the       inquisitive reader to the “Isitsöornot” itself; but in the       meantime, I shall be pardoned for giving a summary of what I       there discovered.        It will be remembered, that, in the usual version of the tales, a       certain monarch having good cause to be jealous of his queen, not       only puts her to death, but makes a vow, by his beard and the       prophet, to espouse each night the most beautiful maiden in his       dominions, and the next morning to deliver her up to the       executioner.        Having fulfilled this vow for many years to the letter, and with       a religious punctuality and method that conferred great credit       upon him as a man of devout feeling and excellent sense, he was       interrupted one afternoon (no doubt at his prayers) by a visit       from his grand vizier, to whose daughter, it appears, there had       occurred an idea.        Her name was Scheherazade, and her idea was, that she would       either redeem the land from the depopulating tax upon its beauty,       or perish, after the approved fashion of all heroines, in the       attempt.        Accordingly, and although we do not find it to be leap-year       (which makes the sacrifice more meritorious), she deputes her       father, the grand vizier, to make an offer to the king of her       hand. This hand the king eagerly accepts—(he had intended to take       it at all events, and had put off the matter from day to day,       only through fear of the vizier),—but, in accepting it now, he       gives all parties very distinctly to understand, that, grand       vizier or no grand vizier, he has not the slightest design of       giving up one iota of his vow or of his privileges. When,       therefore, the fair Scheherazade insisted upon marrying the king,       and did actually marry him despite her father’s excellent advice       not to do any thing of the kind—when she would and did marry him,       I say, will I, nill I, it was with her beautiful black eyes as       thoroughly open as the nature of the case would allow.        It seems, however, that this politic damsel (who had been reading       Machiavelli, beyond doubt), had a very ingenious little plot in       her mind. On the night of the wedding, she contrived, upon I       forget what specious pretence, to have her sister occupy a couch       sufficiently near that of the royal pair to admit of easy       conversation from bed to bed; and, a little before cock-crowing,       she took care to awaken the good monarch, her husband (who bore       her none the worse will because he intended to wring her neck on       the morrow),—she managed to awaken him, I say, (although on       account of a capital conscience and an easy digestion, he slept       well) by the profound interest of a story (about a rat and a       black cat, I think) which she was narrating (all in an undertone,       of course) to her sister. When the day broke, it so happened that       this history was not altogether finished, and that Scheherazade,       in the nature of things could not finish it just then, since it       was high time for her to get up and be bowstrung—a thing very       little more pleasant than hanging, only a trifle more genteel!        The king’s curiosity, however, prevailing, I am sorry to say,       even over his sound religious principles, induced him for this       once to postpone the fulfilment of his vow until next morning,       for the purpose and with the hope of hearing that night how it       fared in the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2148"],["title","The Works of Edgar Allan Poe — Volume 2 (#5)"],["body"," with the black cat (a black cat, I think it was)       and the rat.        The night having arrived, however, the lady Scheherazade not only       put the finishing stroke to the black cat and the rat (the rat       was blue) but before she well knew what she was about, found       herself deep in the intricacies of a narration, having reference       (if I am not altogether mistaken) to a pink horse (with green       wings) that went, in a violent manner, by clockwork, and was       wound up with an indigo key. With this history the king was even       more profoundly interested than with the other—and, as the day       broke before its conclusion (notwithstanding all the queen’s       endeavors to get through with it in time for the bowstringing),       there was again no resource but to postpone that ceremony as       before, for twenty-four hours. The next night there happened a       similar accident with a similar result; and then the next—and       then again the next; so that, in the end, the good monarch,       having been unavoidably deprived of all opportunity to keep his       vow during a period of no less than one thousand and one nights,       either forgets it altogether by the expiration of this time, or       gets himself absolved of it in the regular way, or (what is more       probable) breaks it outright, as well as the head of his father       confessor. At all events, Scheherazade, who, being lineally       descended from Eve, fell heir, perhaps, to the whole seven       baskets of talk, which the latter lady, we all know, picked up       from under the trees in the garden of Eden; Scheherazade, I say,       finally triumphed, and the tariff upon beauty was repealed.        Now, this conclusion (which is that of the story as we have it       upon record) is, no doubt, excessively proper and pleasant—but       alas! like a great many pleasant things, is more pleasant than       true, and I am indebted altogether to the “Isitsöornot” for the       means of correcting the error. “Le mieux,” says a French proverb,       “est l’ennemi du bien,” and, in mentioning that Scheherazade had       inherited the seven baskets of talk, I should have added that she       put them out at compound interest until they amounted to       seventy-seven.        “My dear sister,” said she, on the thousand-and-second night, (I       quote the language of the “Isitsöornot” at this point, verbatim)       “my dear sister,” said she, “now that all this little difficulty       about the bowstring has blown over, and that this odious tax is       so happily repealed, I feel that I have been guilty of great       indiscretion in withholding from you and the king (who I am sorry       to say, snores—a thing no gentleman would do) the full conclusion       of Sinbad the sailor. This person went through numerous other and       more interesting adventures than those which I related; but the       truth is, I felt sleepy on the particular night of their       narration, and so was seduced into cutting them short—a grievous       piece of misconduct, for which I only trust that Allah will       forgive me. But even yet it is not too late to remedy my great       neglect—and as soon as I have given the king a pinch or two in       order to wake him up so far that he may stop making that horrible       noise, I will forthwith entertain you (and him if he pleases)       with the sequel of this very remarkable story.”        Hereupon the sister of Scheherazade, as I have it from the       “Isitsöornot,” expressed no very particular intensity of       gratification; but the king, having been sufficiently pinched, at       length ceased snoring, and finally said, “Hum!” and then “Hoo!”       when the queen, understanding these words (which are no doubt       Arabic) to signify that he was all attention, and would do his       best not to snore any more—the queen, I say, having arranged       these matters to her satisfaction, re-entered thus, at once, into       the history of Sinbad the sailor:        “‘At length, in my old age,’ [these are the words of Sinbad       himself, as retailed by Scheherazade]—‘at length, in my old age,       and after enjoying many years of tranquillity at home, I became       once more possessed of a desire of visiting foreign countries;       and one day, without acquainting any of my family with my design,       I packed up some bundles of such merchandise as was most precious       and least bulky, and, engaging a porter to carry them, went with       him down to the sea-shore, to await the arrival of any chance       vessel that might convey me out of the kingdom into some region       which I had not as yet explored.        “‘Having deposited the packages upon the sands, we sat down       beneath some trees, and looked out into the ocean in the hope of       perceiving a ship, but during several hours we saw none whatever.       At length I fancied that I could hear a singular buzzing or       humming sound; and the porter, after listening awhile, declared       that he also could distinguish it. Presently it grew louder, and       then still louder, so that we could have no doubt that the object       which caused it was approaching us. At length, on the edge of the       horizon, we discovered a black speck, which rapidly increased in       size until we made it out to be a vast monster, swimming with a       great part of its body above the surface of the sea. It came       toward us with inconceivable swiftness, throwing up huge waves of       foam around its breast, and illuminating all that part of the sea       through which it passed, with a long line of fire that extended       far off into the distance.        “‘As the thing drew near we saw it very distinctly. Its length       was equal to that of three of the loftiest trees that grow, and       it was as wide as the great hall of audience in your palace, O       most sublime and munificent of the Caliphs. Its body, which was       unlike that of ordinary fishes, was as solid as a rock, and of a       jetty blackness throughout all that portion of it which floated       above the water, with the exception of a narrow blood-red streak       that completely begirdled it. The belly, which floated beneath       the surface, and of which we could get only a glimpse now and       then as the monster rose and fell with the billows, was entirely       covered with metallic scales, of a color like that of the moon in       misty weather. The back was flat and nearly white, and from it       there extended upwards of six spines, about half the length of       the whole body.        “‘This horrible creature had no mouth that we could perceive;       but, as if to make up for this deficiency, it was provided with       at least four score of eyes, that protruded from their sockets       like those of the green dragon-fly, and were arranged all around       the body in two rows, one above the other, and parallel to the       blood-red streak, which seemed to answer the purpose of an       eyebrow. Two or three of these dreadful eyes were much larger       than the others, and had the appearance of solid gold.        “‘Although this beast approached us, as I have before said, with       the greatest rapidity, it must have been moved altogether by       necromancy—for it had neither fins like a fish nor web-feet like       a duck, nor wings like the seashell which is blown along in the       manner of a vessel; nor yet did it writhe itself forward as do       the eels. Its head and its tail were shaped precisely alike,       only, not far from the latter, were two small holes that served       for nostrils, and through which the monster puffed out its thick       breath with prodigious violence, and with a shrieking,       disagreeable noise.        “‘Our terror at beholding this hideous thing was very great, but       it was even surpassed by our astonishment, when upon getting a       nearer look, we perceived upon the creature’s back a vast number       of animals about the size and shape of men, and altogether much       resembling them, except that they wore no garments (as men do),       being supplied (by nature, no doubt) with an ugly uncomfortable       covering, a good deal like cloth, but fitting so tight to the       skin, as to render the poor wretches laughably awkward, and put       them apparently to severe pain. On the very tips of their heads       were certain square-looking boxes, which, at first sight, I       thought might have been intended to answer as turbans, but I soon       discovered that they were excessively heavy and solid, and I       therefore concluded they were contrivances designed, by their       great weight, to keep the heads of the animals steady and safe       upon their shoulders. Around the necks of the creatures were       fastened black collars, (badges of servitude, no doubt,) such as       we keep on our dogs, only much wider and infinitely stiffer, so       that it was quite impossible for these poor victims to move their       heads in any direction without moving the body at the same time;       and thus they were doomed to perpetual contemplation of their       noses—a view puggish and snubby in a wonderful, if not positively       in an awful degree.        “‘When the monster had nearly reached the shore where we stood,       it suddenly pushed out one of its eyes to a great extent, and       emitted from it a terrible flash of fire, accompanied by a dense       cloud of smoke, and a noise that I can compare to nothing but       thunder. As the smoke cleared away, we saw one of the odd       man-animals standing near the head of the large beast with a       trumpet in his hand, through which (putting it to his mouth) he       presently addressed us in loud, harsh, and disagreeable accents,       that, perhaps, we should have mistaken for language, had they not       come altogether through the "]]]
