You recall the situation?\"  \"If you mean their attempts to get the things to show some signs of life, I do, naturally.\"  \"One of them got lively enough for poor old Azol, didn't it?\" Professor Mantelish rumbled from his armchair.  Trigger grimaced. Doctor Azol's fate might be one of the things that had given her a negative attitude towards plasmoids. With Mantelish and Doctor Gess Fayle, Azol had been the third of the three big U-League boys in charge of the initial investigation on Harvest Moon. As she remembered it, it was Azol who discovered that Plasmoids occasionally could be induced to absorb food. Almost any kind of food, it turned out, so long as it contained a sufficient quantity of protein. What had happened to Azol looked like a particularly unfortunate result of the discovery. It was assumed an untimely coronary had been the reason he had fallen helplessly into the feeding trough of one of the largest plasmoids. By the time he was found, all of him from the knees on up already had been absorbed.  \"I meant your efforts to get them to work,\" she said.  Commissioner Tate looked at Mantelish. \"You tell her about that part of it,\" he suggested.  Mantelish shook his head. \"I'd get too technical,\" he said resignedly. \"I always do. At least they say so. You tell her.\"  But Holati Tate's eyes had shifted suddenly to the table. \"Hey, now!\" he said in a low voice.  Trigger followed his gaze. After a moment she made a soft, sucking sound of alarmed distaste.  \"Ugh!\" she remarked. \"It's moving!\"  \"So it is,\" Holati said.  \"Towards me!\" said Trigger. \"I think--\"  \"Don't get startled. Mantelish!\"  Mantelish already was coming up slowly behind Trigger's chair. \"Don't move!\" he cautioned her.  \"Why not?\" said Trigger.  \"Hush, my dear.\" Mantelish laid a large, heavy hand on each of her shoulders and bore down slightly. \"It's sensitive! This is very interesting. Very.\"  Perhaps it was. She kept watching the plasmoid. It had thinned out somewhat and was gliding very slowly but very steadily across the table. Definitely in her direction.  \"Ho-ho!\" said Mantelish in a thunderous murmur. \"Perhaps it likes you, Trigger! Ho-ho!\" He seemed immensely pleased.  \"Well,\" Trigger said helplessly, \"I don't like it!\" She wriggled slightly under Mantelish's hands. \"And I'd sooner get out of this chair!\"  \"Don't be childish, Trigger,\" said the professor annoyedly. \"You're behaving as if it were, in some manner, offensive.\"  \"It is,\" she said.  \"Hush, my dear,\" Mantelish said absently, putting on a little more pressure. Trigger hushed resignedly. They watched. In about a minute, the gliding thing reached the edge of the table. Trigger gathered herself to duck out from under Mantelish's hands and go flying out of the chair if it looked as if the plasmoid was about to drop into her lap.  But it stopped. For a few seconds it lay motionless. Then it gradually raised its front end and began waving it gently back and forth in the air. At her, Trigger suspected.  \"Yipes!\" she said, horrified.  The front end sank back. The plasmoid lay still again. After a minute it was still lying still.  \"Show's over for the moment, I guess,\" said the Commissioner.  \"I'm afraid so,\" said Professor Mantelish. His big hands went away from Trigger's aching shoulders. \"You startled it, Trigger!\" he boomed at her accusingly.     6   The point of it, Holati Tate explained, was that this had been more activity than 113-A normally displayed over a period of a week. And 113-A was easily the most active plasmoid of them all nowadays.  \"It is, of course, possible,\" Mantelish said, arousing from deep thought, \"that it was attracted by your body odor.\"  \"Thank you, Mantelish!\" said Trigger.  \"You're welcome, my dear.\" Mantelish had pulled his chair up to the table; he hitched himself forward in it. \"We shall now,\" he announced, \"try a little experiment. Pick it up, Trigger.\"  She stared at him. \"Pick it up! No, Mantelish. We shall now try some other little experiment.\"  Mantelish furrowed his Jovian brows. Holati gave her a small smile across the table. \"Just touch it with the tip of a finger,\" he suggested. \"You can do that much for the professor, can't you?\"  \"Barely,\" Trigger told him grimly. But she reached out and put a cautious finger tip to the less lively end of 113-A. After a moment she said, \"Hey!\" She moved the finger lightly along the thing's surface. It had a velvety, smooth, warm feeling, rather like a kitten. \"You know,\" she said surprised, \"it feels sort of nice! It just looks disgusting.\"  \"Disgusting!\" Mantelish boomed, offended again.  The Commissioner held up a hand. \"Just a moment,\" he said. He'd picked up some signal Trigger hadn't noticed, for he went over to the wall now and touched something there. A release button apparently. The door to the room opened. Trigger's grabber came in. The door closed behind him. He was carrying a tray with a squat brown flask and four rather small glasses on it.  He gave Trigger a grin. She gave him a tentative smile in return. The Commissioner had introduced him: Heslet Quillan--Major Heslet Quillan, of the Subspace Engineers. For a Subspace Engineer, Trigger had thought skeptically, he was a pretty good grabber. But there was a qualified truce in the room. It would last, at least, until Holati finished his explaining. There was no really good reason not to include Major Quillan in it.  \"Ah, Puya!\" Professor Mantelish exclaimed, advancing on the tray as Quillan set it on the table. Mantelish seemed to have forgotten about plasmoid experiments for the moment, and Trigger didn't intend to remind him. She drew her hand back quietly from 113-A. The professor unstoppered the flask. \"You'll have some, Trigger, I'm sure? The only really good thing the benighted world of Rumli ever produced.\"  \"My great-grandmother,\" Trigger remarked, \"was a Rumlian.\" She watched him fill the four glasses with a thin purple liquid. \"I've never tried it; but yes, thanks.\"  Quillan put one of the glasses in front of her.  \"And we shall drink,\" Mantelish suggested, with a suave flourish of his Puya, \"to your great-grandmother!\"  \"We shall also,\" suggested Major Quillan, pulling a chair up to the table for himself, \"Advise Trigger to take a very small sip on her first go at the stuff.\"  Nobody had invited him to sit down. But nobody was objecting either. Well, that fitted, Trigger thought.  She sipped. It was tart and hot. Very hot. She set the glass back on the table, inhaled with difficulty, exhaled quiveringly. Tears gathered in her eyes.  \"Very good!\" she husked.  \"Very good,\" the Commissioner agreed. He put down his empty glass and smacked his lips lightly. \"And now,\" he said briskly, \"let's get on with this conference.\"  Trigger glanced around the room while Quillan refilled three glasses. The small live coal she had swallowed was melting away; a warm glow began to spread through her. It did look like the dining room of a hunting lodge. The woodwork was dark, old-looking, worn with much polishing. Horned heads of various formidable Maccadon life-forms adorned the walls.  But it was open season now on a different kind of game. Three men had walked briskly past them when Quillan brought her in by the front door. They hadn't even looked at her. There were sounds now and then from some of the other rooms, and that general feeling of a considerable number of people around--of being at an operating headquarters of some sort, which hummed with quiet activity.  One of the things, Holati Tate said, which had not become public knowledge so far was that Professor Mantelish actually succeeded in getting some of the plasmoids on the Old Galactic base back into operation. One plasmoid in particular.  The reason the achievement hadn't been announced was that for nearly six weeks no one except the three men directly involved in the experiments had known about them. And during that time other things occurred which made subsequent publicity seem very inadvisable.  Mantelish scowled. \"We made up a report to the League the day of the initial discovery,\" he informed Trigger. \"It was a complete and detailed report!\"  \"True,\" Holati said, \"but the report the U-League got didn't happen to be the one Professor Mantelish helped make up. We'll go into that later. The plasmoid the professor was experimenting with was the 112-113 unit.\"   He shifted his gaze to Mantelish. \"Still want me to tell it?\"  \"Yes, yes!\" Mantelish said impatiently. \"You will oversimplify grossly, of course, but it should do for the moment. At a more leisurely time I shall be glad to give Trigger an accurate description of the processes.\"  Trigger smiled at him. \"Thank you, Professor!\" She took her second sip of the Puya. Not bad.  \"Well, Mantelish was dosing this plasmoid with mild electrical stimulations,\" Holati went on. \"He noticed suddenly that as he did it other plasmoids in that section of Harvest Moon were indicating signs of activity. So he called in Doctor Fayle and Doctor Azol.\"  The three scientists discovered quickly that stimulation of the 112 part of the unit was in fact producing random patterns of plasmoid motion throughout the entire base, while an electrical prod at 113 brought everything to an abrupt stop again. After a few hours of this, 112 suddenly extruded a section of its material, which detached itself and moved off slowly under its own power through half the station, trailed with great excitement by Mantelish and Azol. It stopped at a point where another plasmoid had been removed for laboratory investigations, climbed up and settled down in the place left vacant by its predecessor. It then reshaped itself into a copy of the predecessor, and remained where it was. Obviously a replacement.  There was dignified scientific jubilation among the three.

To         F.L.S.      A MAN OF LAW   First Printed, May, 1922  32nd Edition, September, 1934  Made and Printed in Great Britain for Hodder and Stoughton Limited, by Wyman & Sons Ltd., London, Reading and Fakenham     The Angel of Terror     Chapter I   The hush of the court, which had been broken when the foreman of the jury returned their verdict, was intensified as the Judge, with a quick glance over his pince-nez at the tall prisoner, marshalled his papers with the precision and method which old men display in tense moments such as these. He gathered them together, white paper and blue and buff and stacked them in a neat heap on a tiny ledge to the left of his desk. Then he took his pen and wrote a few words on a printed paper before him.  Another breathless pause and he groped beneath the desk and brought out a small square of black silk and carefully laid it over his white wig. Then he spoke:  \"James Meredith, you have been convicted after a long and patient trial of the awful crime of wilful murder. With the verdict of the jury I am in complete agreement. There is little doubt, after hearing the evidence of the unfortunate lady to whom you were engaged, and whose evidence you attempted in the most brutal manner to refute, that, instigated by your jealousy, you shot Ferdinand Bulford. The evidence of Miss Briggerland that you had threatened this poor young man, and that you left her presence in a temper, is unshaken. By a terrible coincidence, Mr. Bulford was in the street outside your fiancée's door when you left, and maddened by your insane jealousy, you shot him dead.  \"To suggest, as you have through your counsel, that you called at Miss Briggerland's that night to break off your engagement and that the interview was a mild one and unattended by recriminations is to suggest that this lady has deliberately committed perjury in order to swear away your life, and when to that disgraceful charge you produce a motive, namely that by your death or imprisonment Miss Briggerland, who is your cousin, would benefit to a considerable extent, you merely add to your infamy. Nobody who saw the young girl in the box, a pathetic, and if I may say, a beautiful figure, could accept for one moment your fantastic explanation.  \"Who killed Ferdinand Bulford? A man without an enemy in the world. That tragedy cannot be explained away. It now only remains for me to pass the sentence which the law imposes. The jury's recommendation to mercy will be forwarded to the proper quarter....\"  He then proceeded to pass sentence of death, and the tall man in the dock listened without a muscle of his face moving.  So ended the great Berkeley Street Murder Trial, and when a few days later it was announced that the sentence of death had been commuted to one of penal servitude for life, there were newspapers and people who hinted at mistaken leniency and suggested that James Meredith would have been hanged if he were a poor man instead of being, as he was, the master of vast wealth.  \"That's that,\" said Jack Glover between his teeth, as he came out of court with the eminent King's Counsel who had defended his friend and client, \"the little lady wins.\"  His companion looked sideways at him and smiled.  \"Honestly, Glover, do you believe that poor girl could do so dastardly a thing as lie about the man she loves?\"  \"She loves!\" repeated Jack Glover witheringly.  \"I think you are prejudiced,\" said the counsel, shaking his head. \"Personally, I believe that Meredith is a lunatic; I am satisfied that all he told us about the interview he had with the girl was born of a diseased imagination. I was terribly impressed when I saw Jean Briggerland in the box. She--by Jove, there is the lady!\"  They had reached the entrance of the Court. A big car was standing by the kerb and one of the attendants was holding open the door for a girl dressed in black. They had a glimpse of a pale, sad face of extraordinary beauty, and then she disappeared behind the drawn blinds.  The counsel drew a long sigh.  \"Mad!\" he said huskily. \"He must be mad! If ever I saw a pure soul in a woman's face, it is in hers!\"  \"You've been in the sun, Sir John--you're getting sentimental,\" said Jack Glover brutally, and the eminent lawyer choked indignantly.  Jack Glover had a trick of saying rude things to his friends, even when those friends were twenty years his senior, and by every rule of professional etiquette entitled to respectful treatment.  \"Really!\" said the outraged Sir John. \"There are times, Glover, when you are insufferable!\"  But by this time Jack Glover was swinging along the Old Bailey, his hands in his pockets, his silk hat on the back of his head.  He found the grey-haired senior member of the firm of Rennett, Glover and Simpson (there had been no Simpson in the firm for ten years) on the point of going home.  Mr. Rennett sat down at the sight of his junior.  \"I heard the news by 'phone,\" he said. \"Ellbery says there is no ground for appeal, but I think the recommendation to mercy will save his life--besides it is a _crime passionelle_, and they don't hang for homicidal jealousy. I suppose it was the girl's evidence that turned the trick?\"  Jack nodded.  \"And she looked like an angel just out of the refrigerator,\" he said despairingly. \"Ellbery did his poor best to shake her, but the old fool is half in love with her--I left him raving about her pure soul and her other celestial etceteras.\"  Mr. Rennett stroked his iron grey beard.  \"She's won,\" he said, but the other turned on him with a snarl.  \"Not yet!\" he said almost harshly. \"She hasn't won till Jimmy Meredith is dead or----\"  \"Or----?\" repeated his partner significantly. \"That 'or' won't come off, Jack. He'll get a life sentence as sure as 'eggs is eggs.' I'd go a long way to help Jimmy; I'd risk my practice and my name.\"  Jack Glover looked at his partner in astonishment.  \"You old sportsman!\" he said admiringly. \"I didn't know you were so fond of Jimmy?\"  Mr. Rennett got up and began pulling on his gloves. He seemed a little uncomfortable at the sensation he had created.  \"His father was my first client,\" he said apologetically. \"One of the best fellows that ever lived. He married late in life, that was why he was such a crank over the question of marriage. You might say that old Meredith founded our firm. Your father and Simpson and I were nearly at our last gasp when Meredith gave us his business. That was our turning point. Your father--God rest him--was never tired of talking about it. I wonder he never told you.\"  \"I think he did,\" said Jack thoughtfully. \"And you really would go a long way--Rennett--I mean, to help Jim Meredith?\"  \"All the way,\" said old Rennett shortly.  Jack Glover began whistling a long lugubrious tune.  \"I'm seeing the old boy to-morrow,\" he said. \"By the way, Rennett, did you see that a fellow had been released from prison to a nursing home for a minor operation the other day? There was a question asked in Parliament about it. Is it usual?\"  \"It can be arranged,\" said Rennett. \"Why?\"  \"Do you think in a few months' time we could get Jim Meredith into a nursing home for--say an appendix operation?\"  \"Has he appendicitis?\" asked the other in surprise.  \"He can fake it,\" said Jack calmly. \"It's the easiest thing in the world to fake.\"  Rennett looked at the other under his heavy eyebrows.  \"You're thinking of the 'or'?\" he challenged, and Jack nodded.  \"It can be done--if he's alive,\" said Rennett after a pause.  \"He'll be alive,\" prophesied his partner, \"now the only thing is--where shall I find the girl?\"     Chapter II   Lydia Beale gathered up the scraps of paper that littered her table, rolled them into a ball and tossed them into the fire.  There was a knock at the door, and she half turned in her chair to meet with a smile her stout landlady who came in carrying a tray on which stood a large cup of tea and two thick and wholesome slices of bread and jam.  \"Finished, Miss Beale?\" asked the landlady anxiously.  \"For the day, yes,\" said the girl with a nod, and stood up stretching herself stiffly.  She was slender, a head taller than the dumpy Mrs. Morgan. The dark violet eyes and the delicate spiritual face she owed to her Celtic ancestors, the grace of her movements, no less than the perfect hands that rested on the drawing board, spoke eloquently of breed.  \"I'd like to see it, miss, if I may,\" said Mrs. Morgan, wiping her hands on her apron in anticipation.  Lydia pulled open a drawer of the table and took out a large sheet of Windsor board. She had completed her pencil sketch and Mrs. Morgan gasped appreciatively. It was a picture of a masked man holding a villainous crowd at bay at the point of a pistol.  \"That's wonderful, miss,\" she said in awe. \"I suppose those sort of things happen too?\"  The girl laughed as she put the drawing away.  \"They happen in stories which I illustrate, Mrs. Morgan,\" she said dryly. \"The real brigands of life come in the shape of lawyers' clerks with writs and summonses. It's a relief from those mad fashion plates I draw, anyway. Do you know, Mrs. Morgan, that the sight of a dressmaker's shop window makes me positively ill!\"  Mrs. Morgan shook her head sympathetically and Lydia changed the subject.  \"Has anybody been this afternoon?\" she asked.  \"Only the young man from Spadd & Newton,\" replied the stout woman with a sigh. \"I told 'im you was out, but I'm a bad liar.\"  The girl groaned.  \"I wonder if I shall ever get to the end of those debts,\" she said in despair. \"I've enough writs in the drawer to paper the house, Mrs. Morgan.\"  Three years ago Lydia Beale's father had died and she had lost the best friend and companion that any girl ever had. She knew he was in debt, but had no idea how extensively he was involved. A creditor had seen her the day after the funeral and had made some uncouth reference to the"]]]
