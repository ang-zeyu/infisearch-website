I shall absolutely forbid her going out of the house, unless you, or some other grown-up person, has charge of her. And really, with John, Nathaniel, and Patty to keep guard, I don't see what mischief can befall the little creature.\"  \"We'll all do our best, mum,\" replied Mrs. Fixfax, heroically.  \"I have perfect faith that you will. There is one more favor to ask. These children have had a strange visit thus far, and if I go away and leave them, I fear they will feel rather forlorn. Can you consent to let the little girls 'keep house,' as they call it? That is, cook their own meals, and set their own table?\"  The cook, who was stuffing the turkey was so surprised that she spilled a handful of sage over her apron. She would not have dared say the words, but her thoughts ran like this: \"Pretty doings, indeed! What does Mrs. Allen mean by letting children come into the kitchen to bother _me_?\"  But Aunt Madge had not finished speaking. \"Mrs. Fixfax, there is a little old cooking-stove in the attic. Don't you remember you had it in your room when you were nursing Rachel through that fever?\"  \"O, yes'm, so I had; and it shall be set right up there again, mum, if you say so,\" said the obliging housekeeper; \"and I'll carry up flour and sugar, and what not, and move out my own things, so the children can have the room pretty much to themselves.\"  \"No need of that, Mrs. Fixfax,\" spoke up the cook, very pleasantly. \"Let 'em come right into the kitchen. I should admire to see 'em enjoy themselves.\"  Patty Diggles was a singular woman. She was always full of polite speeches, just a minute too late.  \"Thank you, Patty; but I think the children may feel more at home in Mrs. Fixfax's room, with no one to watch them. And now, good bye. I hope to come back to-morrow.\"  Mrs. Fixfax left the kitchen to find Nathaniel, and get him to help her move the stove. As soon as the business was over, Nathaniel came into the kitchen, and held up his sooty hands for Patty to see. She was stabbing the turkey with a darning-needle.  \"Some folks know how to feather their own nests,\" said she.  \"Why, what have I done now, Patty?\"  \"Not you, but Mrs. Fixfax; she's going to wait and tend on those children, and of course she'll get a splendid present for it. I should admire to have the little dears round me in the kitchen; but she spoke up, and took the words right out of my mouth.\"  The young man laughed in his sleeves, as he turned them back to wash his hands. He took care not to express his mind, however. He had a few fixed ideas. One was, that Mrs. Allen could do no wrong; and another was, that he must never bandy words with Patty Diggles, because Mrs. Allen had strictly forbidden it.     CHAPTER II.  PRIDE AND ORANGES.   While Mrs. Fixfax was making her room ready for the little housekeepers, Aunt Madge went to her own chamber, and locked up her best dresses, and most valuable possessions. The children watched her with some curiosity.  \"Are you afraid of _burgalers_, auntie?\" asked Dotty. \"Because, if you are, we shan't dare stay here.\"  \"No, Dotty. I only thought, if you should play keep house, it might be rather amusing to come in here, and dress up in some of my old finery. You are welcome to whatever you can find, for I have locked up all that is worth much.\"  \"O, you darling auntie, won't that be splendid? Now we shan't feel half so sorry about your going away.\"  \"Sorry!\" said Mrs. Allen, with a mischievous smile. \"You are so delighted you don't know what to do.\"  \"There, auntie, that isn't fair,\" laughed Prudy, \"when we've been trying our best to cry. But somehow, how can we, when Uncle Augustus isn't very sick, and you're coming right back? But what made me laugh just now, was looking at that ruffled pillow-case, and thinking what a splendid cap it would make for an old lady, tied down with black ribbon!\"  \"A pretty uproar we shall find when we get back, Miss Prudy; but I am prepared for that. Only promise one thing--keep that baby in the house. Flyaway, darling, will you remember not to go out of doors?\"  \"Yes, um, I'll 'member,\" replied Fly, winking her eyes solemnly. She had expected, till the last minute, to go with her auntie.  \"There is one thing I regret. If Mrs. Brooks and Maria come, they will be very much disappointed. Tell them I'll try to attend to them the day but one after Christmas. And now, good by, children. You know you're as dear to me as the apple of my eye. Do take good care of yourselves, and be good.\"  \"The apple of your eye appears to be split in four quarters, auntie,\" remarked Horace; and on the strength of that joke, Mrs. Allen started on her journey to Trenton.  \"Now I suppose I'm to be the head of the family,\" said Prudy, with a majestic air.  \"We are the two heads, if you please, _mum_,\" said Horace, striking an attitude.  \"What am I, then?\" asked Dotty.  \"You? The foot. You must run and tend.\"  \"H'm!\"  \"What am I?\" asked Fly.  \"Why, the little finger, pet. All you have to do is to curl up in one corner.\"  \"H'm!\" responded Fly, looking at Dotty's solemn face, and trying to draw her own down to exactly the same length.  \"Pretty well, I should think,\" said Dotty, as soon as her injured feelings would allow her to speak. \"What have I done to be put down to the bottom of the foot?\"  \"But you know, little sister, one woman has to manage a house; and I am older than you.\"  \"But you can't make a bit better gingerbread, Prudy Parlin! If I've got to be _your_ hired girl, I won't play.\"  \"So I wouldn't,\" said Horace. \"I'd show 'em what I thought of such actions.\"  Upon this there was a little whirlwind, which spun Dotty out of the room before you could count two.  \"They stand very high in their own self-esteem. He's a hero, she a _hero-ess_! They think I like to be laughed at. She said it only took one woman to manage a house; but she never made any fuss when _Horace_ spoke up, and wanted to help. It's _me_ that can't manage--just because it's me. Who wants Horace for the head of the family? He don't know more'n the head of a pin! When'd ever _he_ make ginger-bread?\"  By this time Dotty had reached her own room in a tumult of rage.  \"Prudy wouldn't 'low three heads to it, I s'pose? O, no; for then I could be one! If I was a great boy, with a silver watch, that wasn't her own sister, she'd let me! Yes, if I had five heads, she wouldn't have said a word.\"  Dotty paced the floor restlessly, with her hands behind her.  \"I shan't go back. Let 'em keep their old house. I can keep house my own self up in this room--wish I'd brought Fly--she's too good for 'em. Wish I hadn't come to New York to be imposed upon.\"  As Dotty was crossing and recrossing the room, her eye fell on one of the illuminated cards on the wall, printed in red and gold, and wreathed with delicate lilies of the valley--\"God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.\"  The angry child stopped short.  \"Who put that there? What did auntie mean? She meant _me_. Everybody means me. I wouldn't have thought that of auntie.\"  Dotty turned away; but the words followed her across the room like the eyes of a portrait.  \"'God resisteth the proud.' Well, who said I was proud? People are so queer! Always think it's me wants the best things. 'Giveth grace to the humble.' There, I s'pose that means Prudy. She's just as humble! Never wants to take the best parts when we play. O, no; Prudy's humble? Prudy's a _hero-ess_!'\"  But scold as she might, those burning red words were looking right down into Dotty's soul. Though she shut her eyes, there they were still. \"'God resisteth the proud.' Am I proud?--Yes. Does God _resisteth_ me?--Yes, for the Bible can't lie. What _is_ resisteth? Something that makes you feel bad, prob'ly. That's why I can't be happy. I won't be proud another minute.\"  Dotty winked fast, set her teeth together, pinched her neck, and swallowed.  \"There, it's going down my throat like a pill,--its gone! Am I proud any more? No--_for_ I really don't s'pose I can make gingerbread quite so well as Prudy! I never made any but once, and then Norah took it out of the oven and put in the ginger and molasses. No, I'm not proud. I don't want to keep house. I shouldn't know how. It would be very much better to go back and behave, for I can't stay here without being lonesome.\"  Dotty looked again at the red and gold text. \"How different it seems to me now I'm humble! People needn't be proud if they'd swallow it down like a pill.\"  Dotty's reasoning was rather mixed; still it is worthy of notice, that she was doing a remarkable thing for her, as she slowly walked back to her auntie's room.  But all this while Prudy, too, had been suffering. She could never bear to have her young sister angry, and, if it had not been for Horace, would have gone to her with all sorts of promises--anything for peace.  \"She's an outrageous little tyrant, Prue. She ought to have a sound whipping.\"  \"O, Horace,\" said Prudy, quite shocked; \"she can't help her temper; she has to be humored.\"  \"Poh! that's just what ails her! Been humored to death.\"  \"But, Horace, can't we change our play, somehow? It never will do for me to try to order her about.\"  \"Nonsense, Prue! But if you're going to be so fussy, you might keep boarding-house, and have her for lady boarder.\"  Prudy's brow cleared.  \"Just what'll suit her, Horace! A lady boarder is so fashionable,--like the one they had at Mrs. Penny's,--always washing out laces. Now I'll go tell Dotty.\"  Just then Miss Dimple appeared at the door with an uncertain smile.  \"I--I--thought--\"  \"O, how kind of you to come back to us, my Lady Magnifico!\" cried Horace, bowing himself double. \"Your landlady was afraid you objected to your boarding-place.\"  \"You see,\" said Prudy, eagerly, \"we are making believe I keep boarders. I've 'seen better days,' or something of that kind, as they say in story-books--O, seems to me my husband died.\"  \"Yes; I saw his death "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20984"],["title","Prudy Keeping House (#2)"],["body","the papers,\" said Dotty, briskly; \"so you don't want me for your hired girl--do you?\"  Then she thought, \"How glad I am I came back! It's always better to be humble!\" and added aloud, with a fine-lady drawl,--  \"No, mim; it's not the style I've been subject to. I was _necessiated_ to leave you, mim, because I can't eat out of anything but gold teaspoons.\"  \"That sounds so like Mrs. Pitkin Smith!\" said Prudy, laughing. \"She used to board at Mrs. Penny's, Horace. Come, let's go and dress in our costumes. I'll be Mother Hubbard; and Horace, you go into uncle's dressing-room and see what you can find.\"  [Illustration: Little Miss Fly.]     CHAPTER III.  BORROWED JEWELS.   \"Of course I must take the best things,\" said Dotty; \"for I'm to have the best part.\"  So she chose a blue poplin dress, a pink sash, a scarlet bow, and a green pin. The dress was half a yard too long, and she caught it up in front with some artificial flowers she found in a box. Her head she surmounted with an old chignon, which bobbed back and forth, as she walked, like a pedler's pack.  \"O, see, Prudy,\" said she; \"here is auntie's jewel cabinet. What cunning little sliding drawers!\"  \"Don't open it; don't touch it, Dotty. I saw auntie look it up in her safe once; but I suppose she took it out again to get her watch.\"  \"No, she didn't; here's her watch,\" said Dotty, swinging open one of the little drawers.  \"That's her other watch, Dotty. She says it needs mending.\"  \"Then I'm going to wear it; it is just as good for a lady boarder, as a whole one.\"  \"Don't, Dotty; that's the watch Uncle Augustus gave her when they were married, and she thinks the world of it.\"  \"Well, he gave her the other one too--didn't he?\"  \"Yes; last Christmas: don't you know how she found it in an orange?\"  \"O, I remember. And she ought to think the most of that one, Prudy, because she loves him better now than she did when he gave her this one; ever so much better.\"  \"It's of no consequence to you if she does, or if she doesn't, Dotty Dimple. What right have you with that cabinet, I _should_ like to know? Shut it right up this minute. O please do, Dotty.\"  Dotty's contrary spirit began to rise. She opened every one of the drawers, and poured out the glittering jewels. Of course Fly was on the spot in a twinkling; but Prudy caught her, and playfully pinned her little arms down to her sides; so her prying fingers had no chance to do mischief.  \"Didn't auntie tell us to dress up in her old finery?\" said Dotty, thrusting the watch into her girdle.  \"Old finery, Dotty Dimple!\"  \"And isn't this old? 'You're welcome to whatever you can find;' that was just the words she said, Prudy Parlin.\"  \"O, how many ways there are for people to do wrong if they want to!\" cried Prudy, in despair. \"When you _do_ get started, Dotty--Will you, or will you not, put up those things? If you don't, it's my duty to call Horace, and--\"  \"_'Fore_ I'd be a tell-tale!\" said Dotty, slipping off half a dozen rings in haste. \"There, I won't wear but just two--one on each thumb. Who wants the old watch? Tick's all out of it. You don't know, Prudy, how tight those rings fit. I could wear 'em on my forefinger, but I shan't, you make such a fuss.\"  Prudy answered by a look of unutterable contempt.  \"I suppose,\" said she, speaking with a vehemence quite unusual to her--\"I suppose you know auntie's jewels are worth more money than father has in the world! If you lose one of them, I don't know who's going to pay for it; that's all.\"  Dotty looked amazed, but answered coolly,--  \"Of course I always knew that! Auntie has about as nice things as the governor's wife.\"  She was sure she was very humble, since swallowing her pride like a pill; but somehow she was determined not to take off those rings.  \"Prudy needn't speak so sharp to me! I didn't care about wearing 'em in the first place; but now I'll do it to show her what's the use to preach!\"  Prudy, having done her duty, said no more, but proceeded to look over her auntie's wardrobe in search of a dress.  \"I s'pose she thinks I'm the awfulest girl,\" mused Dotty, fluttering in and out of the closet. \"I s'pose she's thinking about that rag-bag last summer--how Jennie Vance no business to take those three dollars out of the saddle-bag pockets! Grandma said, 'You're welcome to all you can find.' Well, but that didn't mean for Jennie to steal! Prudy needn't go to thinking this is the same kind of a thing, for it isn't. I guess stealing is pretty different from borrowing.\"  Dotty viewed herself in the glass with secret satisfaction. She really looked like a Fourth of July fantastic; but we do not see ourselves as others see us.  \"She won't be the least help to me about the house,\" thought Prudy, with a feeling of envy. \"I shall have every single thing to do; and I declare I don't know what to get for dinner.\"  She chose the worst looking wrapper her aunt's wardrobe afforded, and a gingham apron with pockets. Quite good enough for a woman keeping house without a servant. And as she had decided to call herself Mother Hubbard, she made an ample cap, by folding a \"pillow-sham,\" and putting two of its ruffled edges around her face for a double border. Then, with green spectacles at her nose, a bunch of keys at her waist, and a pair of high-heeled slippers on her feet, she went to the door, and called for Fly.  \"Fly! Why, isn't she in there?\" responded Horace, appearing on the landing, \"You didn't think I had her with me--did you?\"  As Prudy wisely remarked, \"How many ways there are for people to do wrong if they want to!\"  Seeing her betters disagree, little Fly had taken her turn at pouting.  \"They don't say nuffin' 'bout fixin' _me_ up. Goin' to let me go to the party in my old clo'es? Wisht auntie'd tookened me with her. Might just's well not! Might a' worn soft slippers, and not 'sturbed Uncle 'Gustus!\" Fly wafted herself to the top of the bureau, and gazed down on the girls in stern displeasure. But she might as well have scowled at empty air, for no notice was taken of her. Dotty was giving an extra touch to her chignon, and Prudy trying on her cap. \"Hark! What's that?\"  It was the street-cry away off in the backyard--\"Fine fresh oranges.\"  \"Guess I'll go see what's the matter with that man,\" thought Miss Fly. \"Guess he's got hurted.\"  She slid down from the bureau, and stole softly out of the room backward; but her feet made no more sound on the carpet than the fall of a rose-leaf, and neither of the girls looked up.  \"For course I shan't go ou'doors, 'cause I _solomon_ promised I wouldn't,\" said she, pattering down the basement stairs.  The fact was, she had no idea any one would let her go. But it so happened that thoughtless Rachel was the one who unlocked the basement door, and it was an easy thing to slip out behind her.  \"'Cause I spect she'll send me ri' back.\"  But when Rachel looked around, and saw the pretty child with her fair hair blowing wild, she only laughed and went on gossiping with the orange boy. She saw no harm in letting Fly hop about the pavement on one foot sucking oranges, till she herself felt chilled by the keen wind; then she drew the little girl into the house, and shut the door against the snow-storm, saying,--  \"Why, how happened you out here, little Miss Fly?\"  \"She sawed me the whole time; she ought to sended me in,\" thought Fly, dancing up and down to shake off the snow. \"Twasn't me was naughty; 'twas the rest the folks. They didn't pay no 'tention where I went to.\"  But though she pretended to herself that she had done no wrong, she did not wish to be found out, and crept very softly up stairs, even as far as the cupola, and looked out of the windows with all her might.  \"Cold room up here, athout no fire,\" thought she, by and by, with a shiver; and just then she heard the girls calling.  \"Here I is,\" a voice replied, far up the height; and down ran Fly in a trice.  \"You haven't been 'up attic' all this time, Topknot?\"  \"Well, you ought to paid 'tention where I's going to,\" returned Fly, sharply. \"Nobody knows what I'll do next--auntie said there didn't!\"  Horace laughed. \"Come, fix her up, girls; she's my baby.\"  \"I thought you were the 'Man in the Moon,'\" said Mother Hubbard, \"and he isn't married.\"  \"I've been a widower some time,\" sighed Horace, laying his hand on the left pocket of his blue swallow-tail coat.  His costume was as droll as the girls'; for Uncle Augustus, who had figured the week before in some private tableaux, had a full Brother Jonathan suit.  \"The man in the Moon, if you please, Mother Hubbard, come down to inquire the way to Norridge.\"  \"Ah! I'm afraid you've 'come down too soon.' Didn't you forget your whiskers?\"  Horace rubbed his upper lip thoughtfully. \"Will you inform me, ma'am, where I can get a boarding-place? I'm sort of turned round. Growing place. Last time I was down, there were only a few houses here; now it's pretty thick settled back of the meeting-house.\"  \"I'll take you,\" said Mother Hubbard, putting her handkerchief to her face. \"How would my dog feel if he knew I had come to this!\"  \"Come to what, ma'am?\"  \"Why, to New York, to take boarders.\"  \"Are you in _indigenous_ circumstances, madam? And have you seen the first society? If so, I may possibly conclude to come too,\" said Dotty, sweeping forward, and losing a hair-pin out of her chignon.  \"O, what a fascinating creature!\" said the Man in the Moon, making an eye-glass of his thumb and forefinger, and gazing at the lady boarder. \"_Are_ you a widow, ma'am?\"  \"Well, they don't say nuffin' 'bout fixin' _me_ up! Guess I shan't go to the party!\" exclaimed Fly, opening and closing her eyes in token of outraged dignity.  Prudy took her into auntie's room, and proceeded at once to robe her in her own night-dress, with a lace night-cap, and a cologne-mat for a bib.  \"Hollis didn't say for me to be such a _long_ baby,\" sniffled Fly, trying in vain to clear her feet from the trailing skirt.  \"This is your slip, dear. You're only a baby--musn't"]]]
