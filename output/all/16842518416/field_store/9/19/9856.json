What a figure you will be in this uniform!\" Then he leaned over and said persuasively: \"Better buy it, my boy. Take the advice of a man of experience. Clothes are half the battle. They may not be so on the firing line, but they are here in Richmond.\"  Prescott looked longingly at the uniform which in colour and texture was all that the auctioneer claimed, and fingered a small package of gold in his pocket. At that moment some one bid fifty dollars, and Prescott surveyed him with interest.  The speaker was a man of his own age, but shorter and darker, with a hawk-like face softened by black eyes with a faintly humourous twinkle lurking in the corner of each. He seemed distinctly good-natured, but competition stirred Prescott and he offered sixty dollars. The other man hesitated, and the auctioneer, who seemed to know him, asked him to bid up.  \"This uniform is worth a hundred dollars if it's worth a cent, Mr. Talbot,\" he said.  \"I'll give you seventy-five dollars cash or five hundred on a credit,\" said Talbot; \"now which will you take?\"  \"If I had to take either I'd take the seventy-five dollars cash, and I'd be mighty quick about making a choice,\" replied the auctioneer.  Talbot turned to Prescott and regarded him attentively for a moment or two. Then he said:  \"You look like a good fellow, and we're about the same size. Now, I haven't a hundred dollars in gold, and I doubt whether you have. Suppose we buy this uniform together, and take turns in wearing it.\"  Prescott laughed, but he saw that the proposition was made in entire good faith, and he liked the face of the man whom the auctioneer had called Talbot.  \"I won't do that,\" he replied, \"because I have more money than you think. I'll buy this and I'll lend you enough to help you in buying another.\"  Friendships are quickly formed in war time, and the offer was accepted at once. The uniforms were purchased and the two young men strolled on together, each carrying a precious burden under his arm.  \"My name is Talbot, Thomas Talbot,\" said the stranger. \"I'm a lieutenant and I've had more than two years' service in the West. I was in that charge at Chickamauga when General Cheatham, leading us on, shouted: 'Boys, give 'em hell'; and General Polk, who had been a bishop and couldn't swear, looked at us and said: 'Boys, do as General Cheatham says!' Well, I got a bad wound in the shoulder there, and I've been invalided since in Richmond, but I'm soon going to join the Army of Northern Virginia.\"  Talbot talked on and Prescott found him entertaining, as he was a man who saw the humourous side of things, and his speech, being spontaneous, was interesting.  The day grew darker and colder. Heavy clouds shut out the sun and the rain began to fall. The people fled from the streets, and the two officers shivered in their uniforms. The wind rose and whipped the rain into their faces. Its touch was like ice.  \"Come in here and wait till the storm passes,\" said Talbot, taking his new friend by the arm and pulling him through an open door. Prescott now heard more distinctly than ever the light click of ivory chips, mingled with the sound of many voices in a high or low key, and the soft movement of feet on thick carpets. Without taking much thought, he followed his new friend down a short and narrow hall, at the end of which they entered a large, luxurious room, well lighted and filled with people.  \"Yes, it's a gambling room--The Nonpareil--and there are plenty more like it in Richmond, I can tell you,\" said Talbot. \"Those who follow war must have various kinds of excitement. Besides, nothing is so bad that it does not have its redeeming point, and these places, without pay, have cared for hundreds and hundreds of our wounded.\"  Prescott had another errand upon which his conscience bade him hasten, but casting one glance through the window he saw the soaking streets and the increasing rain, swept in wild gusts by the fierce wind. Then the warmth and light of the place, the hum of talk and perhaps the spirit of youth infolded him and he stayed.  There were thirty or forty men in the room, some civilians and others soldiers, two bearing upon their shoulders the stripes of a general. Four carried their arms in slings and three had crutches beside their chairs. One of the generals was not over twenty-three years of age, but this war furnished younger generals than he, men who won their rank by sheer hard service on great battlefields.  The majority of the men were playing faro, roulette or keno, and the others sat in softly upholstered chairs and talked. Liquors were served from a bar in the corner, where dozens of brightly polished glasses of all shapes and sizes glittered on marble and reflected the light of the gas in vivid colours.  Prescott's mind traveled back to long, lonely watches in the dark forest under snow and rain, in front of the enemy's outposts, and he admitted that while the present might be very wicked it was also very pleasant.  He gave himself up for a little while to the indulgence of his physical senses, and then began to examine those in the room, his eyes soon resting upon the one who was most striking in appearance. It was a time of young men, and this stranger was young like most of the others, perhaps under twenty-five. He was of middle height, very thick and broad, and his frame gave the impression of great muscular strength and endurance. A powerful neck supported a great head surmounted by a crop of hair like a lion's mane. His complexion was as delicate as a woman's, but his pale blue eyes were bent close to the table as he wagered his money with an almost painful intentness, and Prescott saw that the gaming madness was upon him.  Talbot's eyes followed Prescott's and he smiled.  \"I don't wonder that you are looking at Raymond,\" he said. \"He is sure to attract attention anywhere. You are beholding one of the most remarkable men the South has produced.\"  Prescott recognized the name as that of the editor of the _Patriot_, a little newspaper published on a press traveling in a wagon with the Western army until a month since, when it had come over to the Army of Northern Virginia. The _Patriot_ was \"little\" only in size. The wit, humour, terseness, spontaneous power of expression, and above all of phrase-making, which its youthful editor showed in its columns, already had made Raymond a power in the Confederacy, as they were destined in his maturity to win him fame in a reunited nation.  \"He's a great gamester and thinks that he's a master of chance,\" said Talbot, \"but as a matter of fact he always loses. See how fast his pile of money is diminishing. It will soon be gone, but he will find another resource. You watch him.\"  Prescott did not need the advice, as his attention was already concentrated on Raymond's broad, massive jaw and the aggressive curve of his strong face. His movements were quick and nervous; face and figure alike expressed the most absolute self-confidence. Prescott wondered if this self-confidence did not lie at the basis of all success, military, literary, mercantile or other, enabling one's triumphs to cover up his failures and make the people remember only the former.  Raymond continued to lose, and presently, all his money being gone, he began to feel in his pockets in an absent-minded way for more, but the hand came forth empty from each pocket. He did not hesitate.  A man only two or three years older was sitting next to Raymond, and he, too, was intent on the game. Beside him was a very respectable little heap of gold and notes, and Raymond, reaching over, took half of the money and without a word, putting it in front of himself, went on with his wagers. The second man looked up in surprise, but seeing who had robbed him, merely made a wry face and continued his game. Several who had noticed the action laughed.  \"It's Raymond's way,\" said Talbot. \"I knew that he would do it. That's why I told you to watch him. The other man is Winthrop. He's an editor, too--one of our Richmond papers. He isn't a genius like Raymond, but he's a slashing writer--loves to criticize anybody from the President down, and he often does it. He belongs to the F. F. V.'s himself, but he has no mercy on them--shows up all their faults. While you can say that gambling is Raymond's amusement, you may say with equal truth that dueling is Winthrop's.\"  \"Dueling!\" exclaimed Prescott in surprise. \"Why, I never saw a milder face!\"  \"Oh, he doesn't fight duels from choice,\" replied Talbot. \"It's because of his newspaper. He's always criticizing, and here when a man is criticized in print he challenges the editor. And the funny thing about it is, that although Winthrop can't shoot or fence at all, he's never been hurt. Providence protects him, I suppose.\"  \"Has he ever hit anybody?\" asked Prescott.  \"Only once,\" replied Talbot, \"and that was his eleventh duel since the war began. He shot his man in the shoulder and then jumped up and down in his pride. 'I hit him! I hit him!' he cried. 'Yes, Winthrop,' said his second, 'some one was bound to get in the way if you kept on shooting long enough.'\"  The place, with its rich colours, its lights shining from glasses and mirrors, its mellow odours of liquids and its softened sounds began to have a soporific effect upon Prescott, used so long to the open air and untold hardships. His senses were pleasantly lulled, and the voice of his friend, whom he seemed now to have known for a long time, came from far away. He could have closed his eyes and gone to sleep, but Talbot talked on.  \"Here you see the back door of the Confederacy,\" he said. \"You men at the front know nothing. You are merely fighting to defend the main entrance. But while you are getting yourselves shot to pieces without knowing any special reason why, all sorts of people slip in at "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21321"],["title","Before the Dawn: A Story of the Fall of Richmond (#2)"],["body","back door. It is true not only of this government, but also of all others.\"  A middle-aged, heavy-faced man in a general's uniform entered and began to talk earnestly to one of the other generals.  \"That is General Markham,\" said Talbot, \"who is specially interesting not because of himself, but on account of his wife. She is years younger than he, and is said to be the most brilliant woman in Richmond. She has plans for the General, but is too smart to say what they are. I doubt whether the General himself knows.\"  Raymond and Winthrop presently stopped playing and Talbot promptly introduced his new friend.  \"We should know each other since we belong to the same army,\" said Raymond. \"You fight and I write, and I don't know which of us does the more damage; but the truth is, I've but recently joined the Army of Northern Virginia. I've been following the army in the West, but the news didn't suit me there and I've come East.\"  \"I hope that you have many victories to chronicle,\" said Prescott.  \"It's been a long time since there's been a big battle,\" resumed the editor, \"and so I've come up to Richmond to see a little life.\"  He glanced about the room.  \"And I see it here,\" he added. \"I confess that the fleshpots of Richmond are pleasant.\"  Then he began to talk of the life in the capital, the condition of the army and the Confederate States, furnishing a continual surprise to Prescott, who now saw that beneath the man's occasional frivolity and epicurean tastes lay a mind of wonderful penetration, possessing that precious quality generally known as insight. He revealed a minute knowledge of the Confederacy and its chieftains, both civil and military, but he never risked an opinion as to its ultimate chances of success, although Prescott waited with interest to hear what he might say upon this question, one that often troubled himself. But however near Raymond might come to the point, he always turned gracefully away again.  They were sitting now in a cheerful corner as they talked, but at the table nearest them was a man of forty, with immense square shoulders, a heavy red face and an overbearing manner. He was playing faro and losing steadily, but every time he lost he marked the moment with an angry exclamation. The others, players and spectators alike, seemed to avoid him, and Winthrop, who noticed Prescott's inquiring glance, said:  \"That's Redfield, a member of our Congress,\" and he named the Gulf State from which Redfield came. \"He belonged to the Legislature of his State before the war, which he advocated with all the might of his lungs--no small power, I assure you--and he was leader in the shouting that one Southern gentleman could whip five Yankees. I don't know whether he means that he's the Southern gentleman, as he's never yet been on the firing line, but he's distinguishing himself just now by attacking General Lee for not driving all the Yankees back to Washington.\"  Redfield at length left the game, uttering with an oath his opinion that fair play was impossible in the Nonpareil, and turned to the group seated near him, regarding the Richmond editor with a lowering brow.  \"I say, Winthrop,\" he cried, \"I've got a bone to pick with you. You've been hitting me pretty hard in that rag of yours. Do you know what a public man down in the Gulf States does with an editor who attacks him! Why, he goes around to his office and cowhides the miserable little scamp until he can't lie down comfortably for a month.\"  A slight pink tint appeared in the cheeks of Winthrop.  \"I am not well informed about the custom in the Gulf States, Mr. Redfield,\" he said, \"but here I am always at home to my enemies, as you ought to know.\"  \"Oh, nonsense!\" exclaimed Raymond. \"You two can't fight. We can't afford to lose Redfield. He's going to lead a brigade against the Yankees, and if he'll only make one of those fiery speeches of his it will scare all the blue-backs out of Virginia.\"  Redfield's red face flushed to a deeper hue, and he regarded the speaker with aversion, but said nothing in reply, fearing Raymond's sharp tongue. Instead, he turned upon Prescott, who looked like a mild youth fit to stand much hectoring.  \"You don't introduce me to your new friend,\" he said to Talbot.  \"Mr. Redfield, Captain Prescott,\" said Talbot. \"Mr. Redfield is a Member of Congress and Captain Prescott comes from the Army of Northern Virginia, though by way of North Carolina, where he has been recently on some special duty.\"  \"Ah, from the Army of Northern Virginia,\" said Redfield in a heavy growl. \"Then can you tell me, Mr. Prescott, why General Lee does not drive the Yankees out of Virginia?\"  A dark flush appeared on Prescott's face. Usually mild, he was not always so, and he worshiped General Lee.  \"I think it is because he does not have the help of men like yourself,\" he replied.  A faint ray of a smile crossed the face of Raymond, but the older man was not pleased.  \"Do you know, sir, that I belong to the Confederate Congress?\" he exclaimed angrily; \"and moreover, I am a member of the Military Committee. I have a right to ask these questions.\"  \"Then,\" replied Prescott, \"you should know that it is your duty to ask them of General Lee and not of me, a mere subaltern.\"  \"Now, Mr. Redfield,\" intervened Raymond, \"don't pick a quarrel with Captain Prescott. If there's to be a duel, Winthrop has first claim on you, and I insist for the honour of my profession that he have it. Moreover, since he is slender and you are far from it, I demand that he have two shots to your one, as he will have at least twice as much to kill.\"  Redfield growled out other angry words, which stopped under the cover of his heavy mustache, and then turned abruptly away, leaving Prescott in some doubt as to his personal courage but none at all as to his ill will.  \"It is the misfortune of the South,\" said Raymond, \"to have such men as that, who think to settle public questions by personal violence. They give us a bad name which is not wholly undeserved. In fact, personal violence is our great sin.\"  \"And the man has a lot of power. That's the worst of it,\" added Talbot. \"The boys at the front are hauled around so much by the politicians that they are losing confidence in everybody here in Richmond. Why, when President Davis himself came down and reviewed us with a great crowd of staff officers before Missionary Ridge, the boys all along the line set up the cry: 'Give us somethin' to eat, Mr. Jeff; give us somethin' to eat! We're hungry! We're hungry!' And that may be the reason why we were thrashed so badly by Grant not long after.\"  Prescott saw that the rain had almost ceased, and as he suggested that he must hurry on, the others rose to go with him from the house. He left them at the next corner, glad to have made such friends, and quickened his footsteps as he continued alone.     CHAPTER II  A MAN'S MOTHER   It was a modest house to which Prescott turned his steps, built two stories in height, of red brick, with green shutters over the windows, and in front a little brick-floored portico supported on white columns in the Greek style. His heart gave a great beat as he noticed the open shutters and the thin column of smoke rising from the chimney. The servants at least were there! He had been gone three years, and three years of war is a long time to one who is not yet twenty-five. There was no daily mail from the battlefield, and he had feared that the house would be closed.  He lifted the brass knocker and struck but once. That was sufficient, as before the echo died his mother herself, come before the time set, opened the door. Mrs. Prescott embraced her son, and she was even less demonstrative than himself, though he was generally known to his associates as a reserved man; but he knew the depth of her feelings. One Northern mother out of every ten had a son who never came back, but it was one Southern mother in every three who was left to mourn.  She only said: \"My son, I feared that I should never see you again.\" Then she noticed the thinness of his clothing and its dampness. \"Why, you are cold and wet,\" she added.  \"I do not feel so now, mother,\" he replied.  She smiled, and her smile was that of a young girl. As she drew him toward the fire in a dusky room it seemed to him that some one else went out.  \"I heard your footsteps on the portico,\" she said.  \"And you knew that it was me, mother,\" he interrupted, as he reached down and patted her softly on the cheek.  He could not remember the time when he did not have a protecting feeling in the presence of his mother--he was so tall and large, and she so small. She scarcely reached to the top of his shoulder, and even now, at the age of forty-five, her cheeks had the delicate bloom and freshness of a young girl's.  \"Sit by the fire here,\" she said, as she pushed him into an armchair that she pulled directly in front of the grate.  \"No, you must not do that,\" she added, taking the poker from his hand. \"Don't you know that it is a delight for me to wait upon you, my son come from the war!\"  Then she prodded the coals until they glowed a deep red and the room was suffused with generous warmth.  \"What is this bundle that you have?\" she asked, taking it from him.  \"A new uniform, mother, that I have just bought, and in which I hope to do you credit.\"  She flitted about the room attending to his wants, bringing him a hot drink, and she would listen to no account of himself until she was sure that he was comfortable. He followed her with his eyes, noting how little she had changed in the three years that had seemed so long.  She was a Northern woman, of a Quaker family in Philadelphia, whom his father had married very young and brought to live on a great place in Virginia. Prescott always believed she had never appreciated the fact that she was entering a new social world when she left Philadelphia; and there, on the estate of her husband, a just and generous man, she saw slavery under its most favourable"]]]
