What has that good knife been doing to you that you should treat it in that barbarous manner?\"  Maitland stared back blankly into the Doctor's smiling eyes for a moment, then looked long at the penknife on the floor, and finally stooped and cautiously took it between his forefinger and thumb, eyeing it doubtfully the while.  Then he suddenly sat down, pulled out his pocket handkerchief, and mopped off the perspiration that freely bedewed his face.  \"Well, I'll be shot!\" he ejaculated.  \"What an extraordinary experience! Will you believe me, Doctor, when I tell you that as I drew this penknife out of my waistcoat pocket it actually seemed to change into an adder in my hand?  There was the flat, wicked-looking head, the malevolent eyes, the characteristic markings of the body, and, above all, there was the feeling of it writhing strongly in my grasp, as though it were trying to get enough of its length clear to turn and strike me!  Talk about Aaron's rod and those of the old Egyptian necromancers turning into serpents!  Why, I could have sworn that this knife of mine did precisely the same thing!  Now, there is a problem for you, Doctor: What sort of mental aberration was it that caused me to imagine such an extraordinary thing as that, eh?\"  \"Simply, my dear boy, that I hypnotised you `unbeknownst', so to speak, in illustration of what I have been telling you,\" answered the Doctor, laying his hand upon Dick's shoulder.  \"Hope I didn't scare you very severely, eh?\"  \"N-o,\" answered Dick slowly, \"you did not actually scare me, Doctor; but you managed to give me such a thrill of horror and disgust as I have not experienced for many a long day.  But, I say, do you really mean to tell me, in sober earnest, that that abominable experience was due to hypnotic suggestion on your part?\"  \"Yes, I do,\" answered Humphreys.  \"I wanted to bring home to you in a very convincing manner the power which the hypnotist exercises over his subject.  I could have done it even more convincingly, perhaps, by commanding you to take that perfectly cold poker in your hand, and then suggesting to you that it was red hot, when--despite the fact of the poker being cold--your hand would have been most painfully blistered. But probably the `adder' experiment was convincing enough, eh?\"  \"It was indeed,\" assented Dick with a little reminiscent shudder.  \"But look here, Doctor, you say that you hypnotised me.  When did you do it? I didn't see you do anything peculiar.\"  \"No, my boy, of course you didn't, because I adopted my own especial method, which is instantaneous and undetectable, and which I will teach you if you care to learn it; for I seem to foresee that there may be occasions, by and by, when you get out to South Africa, when you may find the power extremely useful to you, particularly if you should get any medical or surgical work to do.  In such a case just hypnotise your patient in the way that I will teach you, then powerfully suggest to him that your treatment is going to cure him--and it will do so.  As to when I got you under my influence, it was done while I asked you to lend me your penknife.\"  \"By Jove!\" exclaimed Dick; \"it is marvellous, perfectly marvellous; and if I did not know you to be an absolutely truthful man I do not think I could bring myself to believe it.  Now I can understand what you meant when you spoke of the potency of hypnotism for good or for evil, and why, as I understand, you have never yet dared to pass on the secret of your power to anyone else.  But I swear to you, Doctor, that, if you will entrust it to me, I will never, under any circumstances whatsoever, use it except for a good purpose, nor will I ever pass on the secret to anyone else except with your express permission.  And now that you have given me an idea of its capabilities I simply long to know the secret, for it seems to me that a chap with your powers could come very near to working miracles.\"  \"Yes,\" assented Humphreys quietly, \"that is so; indeed, even with my imperfect knowledge--for I have not yet nearly mastered all the possibilities of the science--I have done things that without its aid would have been impossible.  And now, if you like, I will initiate you into the secret of my power, which is very simple after all, and which, once known, will enable you to do everything that I can do.  First of all, however, I propose to throw you into a cataleptic sleep, in order that, while you are in that condition, I may imbue you with an absolute faith in yourself, without which everything that I can teach you would be practically useless, at least until you had acquired faith in yourself by the somewhat slow and laborious process which I had to pursue.  I had to acquire faith in myself and my powers by repeated experiments extending over a period of several months; but you have not time for that, so I must imbue you with it by the process of suggestion while you are in a state of trance.  Now, are you ready?\"  \"Yes, quite,\" answered Dick, with a quick indrawing of the breath; for now that it came to the point he suddenly found that to submit himself unreservedly to the hands of even his friend Humphreys, for the purposes of an experiment that smacked rather strongly of the uncanny, was something of a nerve-trying experience.  Humphreys evidently noted his momentary hesitation, for he said:  \"You need not have the least fear; you will be profoundly unconscious during the period of sleep, and will awake without the slightest trace of any unpleasant feeling.  Now, stretch yourself out comfortably on that sofa, and do exactly as I tell you.\"  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  When Dick descended to the surgery, a few minutes late, the next morning, he found his friend Humphreys, with his coat off, his shirt sleeves rolled up, and his clothes protected by a white apron extending from his throat to the tops of his boots, busily engaged in dusting his bottles and the shelves whereon they stood.  As Dick entered, the Doctor, mounted upon a step ladder, looked down at him with a smile and nod of welcome, and said:  \"Well, my boy, how did you sleep, and how do you feel after your ordeal of last night?\"  Dick laughed joyously.  \"My `ordeal'!\" he exclaimed.  \"I hope I may never have to undergo a more trying ordeal than that.  I slept like a top, thank you, and feel as fit as a fiddle this morning, indeed I don't know that I ever felt so fit in all my life before.  But that is not all: I have not the remotest idea what mysterious thing you did to me last night, but this I know, that you have imparted to me a something that I have never hitherto possessed.  I feel this morning a buoyancy of spirit that it seems to me no amount of disappointment could damp or lessen for a moment, and I have a belief in myself so complete, so boundless, that I feel I cannot help but be successful in this new venture of mine upon which I am about to embark.\"  \"Yes,\" said Humphreys, nodding his head in a manner which very clearly expressed his satisfaction, \"that is the result of your `ordeal', and it will be quite permanent.  Mind you, I don't say that you will always feel quite so buoyant and confident as you do at this moment, for it is beyond the power of any man to make another absolutely immune to circumstances; but in spite of circumstances, however adverse, you will always retain some at least of your present buoyancy and confidence.  I do not think you will ever sink into that condition of utter and abject despair which overwhelms some people and drives them to suicide.  To change the subject.  Are you still minded to go to the docks this morning in quest of a shipmaster benevolently enough inclined to allow you to work your passage out to South Africa?\"  \"Rather!\" answered Dick.  \"That is to say, if you think you can spare me for a few hours.\"  \"Of course I can spare you,\" answered Humphreys.  \"And I would advise you to go immediately after breakfast, for, as you know, `it is the early bird that catches the worm.'  But how do you propose to set about your quest?  Not quite haphazard, I suppose?\"  \"No,\" answered Dick.  \"I thought of getting the _Shipping Gazette_, and perhaps the _Telegraphy_ and consulting their advertisement pages, with the view of learning what ships are on the berth for South African ports, where they are lying, and their date of sailing.\"  \"An excellent idea,\" declared the Doctor.  \"As soon as Polly has put breakfast upon the table we will send her out to get the papers, and you can consult them and prepare a list of likely vessels before you go out.\"  This was done; and by nine o'clock, Dick, having breakfasted, was ready to sally forth on the first stage of his journey in quest of fortune, duly armed with a slip of paper containing a list of some half-dozen ships loading for South Africa, \"with quick dispatch.\"  And two hours later he returned to the surgery, his visage beaming with satisfaction.  \"Hurrah, Doctor!\" he exclaimed, as he dashed in through the open doorway.  \"I've done the trick; got the skipper of the _Concordia_ to allow me to work my passage out to Port Natal as ordinary seaman at a shilling a month.  I `sign on' at the shipping office the day after to- morrow, and have to be on board by eight o'clock the same evening in readiness to haul out of dock at daylight on the following morning.\"    CHAPTER THREE.  BEFORE THE MAST.  The remainder of Dick Maitland's time in England was pretty fully occupied in comforting and encouraging his mother, in view of the pending separation, and in getting his somewhat slender wardrobe ready and packed for the voyage.  The first-mentioned part of his task proved very much more difficult than the other, for Mrs Maitland was rather a helpless kind of person, and had already come to look to Dick"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21059"],["title","The Adventures of Dick Maitland: A Tale of Unknown Africa (#5)"],["body","advice and help in every sort of difficulty, whether great or small; the prospect, therefore, of being henceforth obliged to look after herself and manage her affairs unaided filled her at first with dismay. Besides, there was the separation from her son, the feeling that she knew not whether she would ever again set eyes on him in this world, and the terrible uncertainty generally of the future, to further distract her; but at length the buoyancy and unquenchable hopefulness of Dick's spirit had its effect upon her; and, finally, when the moment of parting came, she had been brought to a frame of mind that enabled her to say the last words of farewell almost with calmness.  As for Dick, he had already received Humphreys' assurance that he would keep in touch with Mrs Maitland, and see, in conjunction with his friend Graham, the solicitor, that she came to no harm; therefore he had few fears for her immediate future; while, for the rest, he was confident that before his mother's little capital became exhausted he would have found means to replenish it.  He spent with her the remainder of the day upon which he had interviewed the skipper of the _Concordia_, and practically the whole of that which succeeded it, finally bidding her farewell about six o'clock in the evening, in order that he might spend the remainder of the day with Humphreys, with whom he had still much of importance to discuss.  Upon Dick's return to Number 19 Paradise Street he found the genial Doctor so busily engaged in dispensing drugs and advice that the two had time for little more than a mutual nod of greeting; but later on, when the last patient had departed and business had been brought to a close for the night, they sat down together for a chat over a cup of coffee and--so far as Humphreys was concerned--a pipe.  Dick had not yet taken to tobacco, and Humphreys, although an inveterate smoker himself, so far from urging his young friend to adopt the habit, had strongly dissuaded him from having anything to do with the weed, at least until he had reached his twenty-first birthday, learnedly descanting upon the injurious effects of nicotine upon the immature constitution, and incidentally warning him to eschew narcotics generally, which, he insisted, were always injurious, and only to be resorted to, even medically, when it became a choice between a narcotic and some greater evil.  \"Well, my boy,\" remarked the Doctor, when they were at length comfortably settled in their respective chairs, \"so you have parted with your mother.  I hope you were able to cheer the poor lady and reconcile her to the separation.  It is of course very hard upon her that at her time of life she should be left absolutely alone, but necessity is a pitiless jade, exacting her tribute of sorrow and suffering from all alike, from the monarch to the pauper, and when she lays her hand upon us there is no escape.  But do not allow anxiety on behalf of your dear mother to worry you for a moment, lad, for I have promised to keep an eye upon her, and, as you know, I am a man of my word, and no harm shall befall her so long as I have the power to avert it.  No, don't thank me, Dick, there is no need; the satisfaction and pleasure that I shall derive from helping your dear mother will be reward enough for me, for I regard her as a personal friend, and shall consider it a privilege to be allowed to do all that I can for her.\"  \"And now, to pass on to another topic, let me show you the medicine chest which I intend shall be my parting gift to you.  Here it is,\"-- producing a stout case measuring about eighteen inches long by fourteen inches wide and twelve inches high.  \"It is not inconveniently bulky or heavy, but it contains a practically complete assortment of drugs, sufficient in quantity to enable you to fight successfully about half a dozen cases of almost every known disease.  More than that it would be inconvenient to carry about with you; and when any particular drug shows signs of exhaustion you must take timely steps to replenish your supply. And, with reference to that same replenishment, you will find a little manuscript book, written by myself, containing full instructions in the art of preparing several of the drugs from their parent plants, which I believe you will find exceedingly useful.\"  Here Humphreys' talk became professional and his speech surcharged with technicalities--for he was an enthusiast in everything relating to the combating and cure of disease, and far into the small hours he descanted learnedly upon his beloved science, confiding to and instructing Dick in many valuable secrets that, by dint of laborious research and much consumption of midnight oil, he had wrung from Dame Nature.  And on many an occasion in the not-far-distant future Dick Maitland had ample cause to look back with gratitude upon that long midnight conversation.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  With exemplary punctuality young Maitland presented himself at the shipping office at ten o'clock in the morning, and duly \"signed on\" as ordinary seaman in the good ship _Concordia_, bound for Natal; Mr Sutcliffe, the chief mate, privately congratulating Captain Roberts, the skipper of the ship, immediately afterwards, upon his good fortune in securing so \"likely\" a hand for the small sum of one shilling per month, and expressing his fixed determination to \"make a man of him\" before they reached the Line.  At the private suggestion of the said chief mate, Dick lost no time in conveying his belongings to the ship and depositing his bedding in the best-sheltered bunk in the forecastle; after which he returned to Number 19 Paradise Street, where he spent the few hours of freedom remaining to him in assisting his friend the Doctor, and absorbing further knowledge from him.  Finally, as the clocks in the immediate neighbourhood were striking the hour of eight in the evening, Dick stepped over the rail of the _Concordia_ and formally reported himself to the chief mate, thereafter repairing to the forecastle and making his preparations for the night.  He was the first hand to join the ship, notwithstanding the fact that the entire crew had been ordered to be on board not later than eight o'clock that evening; and it was not until close upon midnight that the remainder found their way down from the neighbouring public houses, all of them as surly and quarrelsome as bears at the termination of their short period of liberty.  Fortunately for Dick, all hands were too far gone in drink to admit of their quarrelsomeness going further than words, and eventually, by about one o'clock in the morning, he was able to compose himself to sleep, to the accompaniment of the snores and mutterings of his companions--thirteen in number.  Many lads in Dick Maitland's position, and brought up amid refined surroundings, as he had been, would have regarded with horror and loathing such a situation as that in which he now found himself, and would have been overwhelmed with self-pity at the cruelly hard luck which forced them to herd with such uncongenial companions in such a pig sty of a place as the _Concordia's_ forecastle just then presented; but Dick was something of a philosopher, and was, moreover, full of \"grit\". He held the doctrine that a man can make what he chooses of his surroundings, and always find in them something of amusement or interest, if he cares to look for it; and now he consoled himself with the reminder that life in that forecastle, and among those men, whose highest ideal of happiness seemed to be helpless intoxication, would after all be but a brief experience, out of which it would be hard indeed if he could not learn some useful lesson.  With this philosophic reflection, he curled himself up in his blankets and dropped into a sound, dreamless sleep.  At six o'clock next morning the mate came thundering upon the fore scuttle with a handspike, following up the resounding blows with a yell of:  \"All hands ahoy! tumble up there, you sleepers, and don't wait to curl your hair.  Hurry up, now, and give me a chance to see who are the `smarties' among you!\"  With low growls of disgust at such rude and untimely disturbance of their slumbers the fourteen occupants of the forecastle rolled unwillingly out of their bunks and proceeded to scramble into their garments, most of them anathematising the sea life generally, and their present ship in particular.  For forecastle Jack is a curious creature, and, if you are to believe him, \"last voyage\" is invariably the supreme period of his life, wherein has been crowded the utmost comfort and pleasure and the most remarkable adventures, while the ship on board which he happens to be at the moment is, as invariably, the slowest, ugliest, most uncomfortable, and most rotten tub that he ever had the ill luck to ship in.  And all this, mind you, as likely as not before the much-maligned craft has passed out through the dock gates, or Jack has done a hand's turn of work on board her.  Dick listened with a good- tempered grin to the chorus of grumbling that was proceeding around him, interjected a merry jest or two which caused the growlers to stop in mid-career in amazement at his audacity, and then, having slipped nimbly into his clothes, he sprang up through the hatchway and presented himself first on deck of the forecastle hands, to be greeted by the mate with a cheery:  \"Well done, youngster!  First to answer the call.  That comes of joining your ship with an unmuddled brain.  I think you and I are going to get on well together.\"  \"I sincerely hope so, sir,\" answered Dick.  \"If we don't it shall not be my fault.  And although I am rather an ignoramus at present in respect of a sailor's work generally, you will find me both willing and eager to learn.\"  The mate stared at Dick for a moment with compressed eyebrows, rather taken aback at the lad's refined tone and manner of speech; then he nodded, and remarked"]]]
