Trouble!\"     CHAPTER III  THE QUEER OLD LADY   For a little while it seemed as though something serious had happened in the automobile which was taking the Curlytops to Uncle Toby's house. Mr. Martin had all he could do to slow up the machine, bringing it to a stop beside the road, and under a tree. If a tire had burst or been punctured Daddy Martin wanted to be in the shade to fix it.  Mother Martin, holding tightly to the side of the seat when the banging noise sounded, turned to look behind her to see if the three children were all right. She saw Trouble sitting between Ted and Janet, and William was looking at something in his chubby hand.  \"What happened?\" asked Mrs. Martin. \"Were any of you hurt when the tire burst?\"  \"The tire didn't burst, Mother,\" answered Teddy.  \"Why, I heard it,\" said Mr. Martin, as he prepared to get out of the machine, which had now come to a stop. \"I must have run over a sharp stone or a broken bottle.\"  \"No, it wasn't the tire,\" said Janet, and she laughed. \"It was Trouble's toy balloon. He blew it up too big and it burst.\"  \"That's what it was! And a piece of the rubber hit me in the eye!\" laughed Ted.  \"My 'loon all gone!\" wailed William.  \"So that's what it was--a burst toy balloon,\" said Daddy Martin. \"Well, I'm glad it wasn't one of my tires.\"  \"So am I,\" said Mother Martin. \"It is too hot to have to change a tire to-day. Besides, I'm in a hurry to get to Uncle Toby's and see what it is he wants us to take charge of while he is away. I hope he doesn't go until we get there.\"  \"You never can tell what Uncle Toby is going to do,\" said Mr. Martin, smiling, now that he knew he had no tire to change. \"And so you burst your toy balloon, did you, Trouble? Well, I'll have to get you another, but not while we're on this auto ride. I don't want to be frightened again, and I might be if you blew up another balloon and it burst.\"  \"I didn't know he had one with him,\" remarked Mrs. Martin, as Trouble looked sadly at what was left of his toy.  \"I didn't either,\" Janet said. \"All of a sudden he took it out of his pocket and began to blow it up.\"  \"I was makin' be'eve it were a wed soap bubbles,\" explained Trouble.  \"Well, soap bubbles or not, it burst,\" said Teddy. \"It sure did make a noise! But now we can go on. I want to see if Uncle Toby is going to leave any guns.\"  \"And I want a spinning wheel,\" Janet murmured. \"But you can't take it to play steamboat with,\" she told her brother.  \"I shan't want it if I have a gun!\" retorted Ted.  \"Now, children, be nice,\" begged their mother.  Daddy Martin started the automobile again, first getting out to look at the four tires, to make sure none was flat, punctured or burst. They were all round, plump and as fat as big bologna sausages.  \"Now we go to Uncle Toby. Maybe I get a kittie cat!\" said Trouble, when he decided to smile after feeling so bad about his burst balloon.  \"A kittie cat!\" exclaimed Janet. \"Why, we have a lovely cat, Trouble. Don't you like Turnover?\"  \"Yep! But I 'ikes a kittie cat, too. Maybe Uncle Toby hab one for me!\"  \"Probably Uncle Toby is too old a man to bother with pet cats,\" said Mrs. Martin.  But it only goes to show that you never know what is going to happen in this world--sometimes you don't even know what you are going to have for dinner.  Along rolled the automobile, taking the Curlytops nearer and nearer to the city of Pocono, where Uncle Toby lived with his housekeeper, Mrs. Watson. But it was rather a long ride, and, about half way, the party stopped in a little village for lunch.  \"Did we bring any lunch with us, or are we going in a place to eat?\" asked Ted.  \"Oh, I hope we go in a place to eat!\" exclaimed Janet. \"I like a restaurant, don't you, Ted?\"  \"Sure!\" answered the Curlytop boy.  \"Yes, we are going to a restaurant,\" his mother told them. \"Daddy wants to get some oil and gasoline for the auto, too.\"  \"It's sort of feeding the auto, isn't it, Mother?\" asked Janet, as they alighted.  \"In a way, yes,\" admitted Mrs. Martin.  A little later the Curlytops were having a fine meal, and when I say the Curlytops I mean also Daddy and Mother Martin, and Trouble. The hair of Mr. and Mrs. Martin did not curl, though it must have done so when they were younger; or else how would Ted and Janet have had such beautiful ringlets? Nor did Trouble's hair curl, though when he was smaller his mother used to wind little ringlets around her finger, hoping he would have locks as pretty as those of Janet and Ted. But, really, the older boy and girl were the only ones who could, truly, be called Curlytops, though I sometimes speak of the \"Curlytop family.\"  So you know, when I say that the \"Curlytops\" were eating lunch, that all five of them were enjoying their meal. There were several things that Janet, Teddy and Trouble liked to eat, and toward the end of the meal there was a piece of pie for each of them. And it was toward the end of the meal that something happened, and Trouble, as usual, was the cause of it.  Just before the waiter had brought the pie there had sounded, out in the street, the music of a hand organ. No sooner had he heard this than Trouble slipped from his chair (where he had been sitting on a hassock to make him higher) and ran to the window.  \"No monkey!\" called out the little fellow, after he had stood for a moment with his nose pressed against the pane of glass, making his \"smeller,\" as he sometimes called it, quite flat. \"Hand-organ grinder got no monkey!\"  Trouble was disappointed. He had hoped to see a little monkey scrambling around to gather pennies in his cap. But this hand-organ player did not have any. And there was nothing much for Trouble to see. So the little fellow came back to the table, but not before he had stopped at the big water-cooler in one corner of the dining room. Trouble paused to watch a waiter turn the shiny little faucet and draw a glass of water for a customer.  \"Come and get your pie, William,\" his mother called to him. She very seldom mentioned him as \"Trouble,\" before strangers. So this time Mrs. Martin called her little boy by his right name.  \"Do you want me to eat your pie?\" teased Ted.  \"No! I eat my own pie!\" Trouble exclaimed, and he climbed up into his chair, being helped by his father, next to whom he sat.  The meal was almost over, and Daddy Martin was wondering what his Uncle Toby could want him to take charge of, when Mrs. Martin gave a sudden start, a sort of shiver, and said:  \"Why, my feet are getting wet!\"  \"Your feet wet!\" exclaimed her husband. \"Surely it isn't raining in here! It isn't even raining outside!\" he laughed, as he looked from a window.  \"But my feet are damp,\" went on Mrs. Martin. Then she raised the cloth, which hung down rather low on each side of the table, and glanced at the floor. \"There's a big puddle of water under our table!\" she cried.  Then Ted looked over toward the big water-cooler in one corner of the restaurant.  \"Somebody left the faucet open!\" cried Teddy. \"The ice water is all running out! No wonder your feet are wet, Mother!\"  Mr. Martin hastily left his chair and turned off the faucet, and, as he did so, he looked at Trouble. Something in the face of that youngster caused Daddy Martin to ask:  \"William, did you do that?\"  \"I--I dess maybe I turned it on a 'ittle bit!\" confessed the mischievous one.  \"A _little_ bit!\" cried Janet, as she looked under the table. \"Why, there's almost as much water as there is in our brook at home!\"  \"Oh, not quite so much,\" said her mother gently. \"Though there is enough to have wet through the soles of my shoes. I was wondering why my feet felt so damp and cold. And did Trouble turn on the water? Oh, Trouble!\"  All eyes gazed at the little fellow, and he seemed to think he should explain what he had done.  \"I 'ist turned de handle a teeny bit,\" he said, \"to make a 'ittle water come out. An' den I fordot 'bout it!\"  That was just what he had done. Seeing the waiter draw a glass of water from the cooler had given Trouble the idea that he soon afterward carried out. When he saw no monkey with the hand organ, the little fellow had gone back to his seat and, on the way, opened the faucet so that the water ran out in a little stream. Soon the drip-pan was full and then the water began trickling over the floor. No one noticed it until it had made a little puddle under the table, just at the point where Mrs. Martin's feet were.  \"Oh, Trouble! what will you do next?\" sighed the little fellow's mother.  \"No harm done at all! None whatever!\" said the waiter, coming up to the table smiling. \"That little water on the floor I will wipe up so quick you will never see it.\"  \"No, it won't hurt the floor much,\" Mr. Martin said. \"And I suppose your shoes will dry out,\" he told his wife. \"But, all the same, William should not have done it.\"  \"I won't do it any more,\" said the little fellow. \"I be good now! I sorry!\"  He generally was when he had done something like that. However, as the waiter had said, little real harm was done, and Mrs. Martin's shoes would dry, for it was a hot, summer day.  The meal was finished and they all took their places in the automobile again to finish the ride to Uncle Toby's place, about twenty miles farther on.  Once again Trouble, Ted and Janet sat in the rear seat, while their father and mother rode in front. And this time Trouble had no red balloon which he could blow up, making it burst with a noise like a punctured tire. The children talked among themselves, wondering over and over again what it could be that Uncle Toby wanted their father to come and take charge of.  \"Maybe he's got a little boy or a girl from an orphan asylum, and he wants us to take it to live with us,\" suggested Janet.  \"A boy would be all right,\" decided Ted, as he thought of this. \"I could have fun with another fellow.\"  \"And I'd like a girl,\" said Janet. \"I always wished I had a sister.\"  \"Maybe they're twins--"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21049"],["title","The Curlytops and Their Pets; Or, Uncle Toby's Strange Collection (#4)"],["body","boy and a girl,\" Ted went on. \"That would be fun!\"  \"What would be fun?\" asked his mother from the front seat, where she had heard the talk of the children. She often asked a question like this, as it sometimes stopped a bit of mischief that, otherwise, might happen. \"What fun are you talking about?\" asked Mrs. Martin.  \"Uncle Toby,\" answered Janet. \"I thought maybe what he wanted daddy to take charge of was a little orphan girl.\"  \"And I thought maybe it was a boy,\" added Ted.  \"And then we both thought maybe it was twins--a boy and a girl, and we'd each have someone to play with,\" went on Janet.  \"My! I don't believe Uncle Toby has adopted any orphan children that he wants us to take,\" Mrs. Martin said. \"I can't imagine what he really has, but we'll soon find out.\"  On and on they rode in the automobile, until, after a while, they reached the small city of Pocono and, a little later, they pulled up in front of Uncle Toby's house. It was a rambling, old mansion that once had looked very nice, but now it was rather shabby and needed painting.  \"Here is where Uncle Toby lives,\" said Daddy Martin. \"Do you children remember it?\"  \"A little,\" admitted Ted. Neither he nor Janet had been there in years, and Trouble had never visited Uncle Toby.  \"I wonder if he's at home,\" went on Daddy Martin, as he alighted from the automobile.  \"There's someone on the porch,\" said Mrs. Martin. \"Oh, it's Mrs. Watson, the housekeeper,\" she added. \"But something seems to be the matter! I wonder what can have happened?\"  As Mother Martin spoke a queer little old lady came down off the porch and along the walk, hurrying out to meet the Curlytops, all of whom were now at the front gate.  \"Wait! Don't go in! Don't go in!\" cried the queer old lady, holding up her hand like a traffic policeman stopping a fast automobile. \"Don't go in! They're having a terrible time! Oh, that Mr. Bardeen ever should have gone away and left me to look after 'em! Oh, the trouble I have had! Such trouble! Don't go in! Listen to 'em!\"  As she spoke there came strange sounds from the grim old house where Uncle Toby lived! Very strange sounds!     CHAPTER IV  UNCLE TOBY'S PETS   \"Listen to that noise!\" called Teddy, pausing with his hand on the gate that led into Uncle Toby's yard. \"It's two boys having fun. I guess Uncle Toby left two fellows that you can take home and I can have fun with,\" Teddy added laughingly to his father.  \"Two boys! Oh, my goodness!\" exclaimed Mrs. Martin.  Just then a shrill scream sounded from within the queer, old house.  \"It's girls!\" said Janet. \"Girls cry just like that when they're having fun! Oh, I'll be glad to have a sister to play with!\"  Mr. and Mrs. Martin looked at each other in surprise and wonderment. What could it mean? The queer, little old lady--Mrs. Watson, the housekeeper--murmured again:  \"Listen to 'em! I can't do a thing with 'em since Uncle Toby went away. I'm so glad you came to take charge of 'em as he asked you to. You did come for that, didn't you?\" she asked eagerly. \"You got Uncle Toby's letter, asking you to come and take charge of the collection he left, didn't you?\"  \"Oh, yes,\" answered the father of the Curlytops. \"We got Uncle Toby's letter all right, and we came to take charge. But----\"  \"We'd like to know _what_ we are going to take!\" interrupted Mrs. Martin. She felt she must say something, with all those queer noises going on in the house.  \"Maybe it's babies!\" suggested Trouble, as he listened to what seemed to be a crying sound from the old mansion.  \"They're worse than babies!\" declared Mrs. Watson. \"I don't mind children and babies. But these things make so much noise I can't hear myself think. That's why I came out on the steps to sit down and be quiet! Oh, I'm so glad you've come to take charge of 'em!\"  \"But what are they? You haven't told us what they are,\" said Mr. Martin, as the screeching, yelling noises kept on sounding from within the house. \"Do they always screech like that?\"  \"Only when they're hungry,\" said the queer old lady. \"And I expect they're hungry now. I just hate to go in to feed them, they make such a fuss, and I'm afraid some of 'em will bite me. Not on purpose you know,\" she quickly added, \"but just because they're so playful and full of fun.\"  \"My dear Mrs. Watson,\" said Mr. Martin in slow tones, \"will you _please_ tell us what it is my Uncle Toby has left for me to take charge of! Is it an insane asylum?\"  \"Yes, for goodness' sake, please tell us!\" begged the mother of the Curlytops.  \"Why, I thought you knew!\" replied Mrs. Watson, in some surprise. \"Didn't Uncle Toby speak of them in his letter?\"  \"No, he did not say what they were,\" answered Mr. Martin. \"He only mentioned a collection. Please tell us. What is making all that racket?\"  \"Uncle Toby's pets,\" was the answer. \"Uncle Toby said he was going to leave them to you when he went away on a long trip. He may be gone for several years, and he said he might live the rest of his life in South America, where he is going. So he told me to give you his pets to take charge of. You are to take them, and do as you please with them, though I guess Uncle Toby would like to have you keep them and be kind to them.\"  \"Uncle Toby's _pets_!\" exclaimed Mrs. Martin.  \"Is there a dog?\" asked Teddy, his eyes shining in delight. \"Won't Skyrocket be glad? Do you hear that, old fellow?\" went on Teddy, leaning down to pet the dog that had jumped from the automobile and was looking as if in wonder at the house whence came such strange noises. \"You're going to have another dog to play with. Uncle Toby did leave a dog, didn't he?\" Teddy asked of Mrs. Watson. \"I hear a dog barking in the house.\"  \"A dog!\" exclaimed the queer little old housekeeper. \"He left _two_ dogs, Uncle Toby did!\"  \"Two dogs!\" murmured Mrs. Martin, with a hopeless look at her husband.  \"Did he leave a cat?\" asked Janet. \"I thought I heard one mewing. And Turnover would like another cat to play with.\"  \"Yes, Uncle Toby left you a cat, also,\" said Mrs. Watson.  Just then shrill screams, barks, squeaks and squawks, all mixed together, seemed to float out of the opened windows of the old house--windows in which were strong wire screens.  \"Two dogs and a cat!\" exclaimed Mr. Martin. \"My dear Mrs. Watson,\" he went on, as he sat down on the top step of the porch rather limply, \"will you please tell us, as fast as you can, just how many and what pets Uncle Toby has left us? We may as well hear the worst at once,\" he said to his wife. \"I never imagined Uncle Toby cared for animal pets.\"  \"Oh, indeed he did,\" replied Mrs. Watson. \"Of late years he grew very fond of animals. All his pets are animals, and he'd have gotten more only I said I wouldn't stay and keep house for him if he brought in what he spoke of last.\"  \"What was that?\" Mrs. Martin wanted to know.  \"_Snakes_!\" declared the little old lady. \"I don't mind monkeys and parrots so much, but I can't bear _snakes_! They give me the shivers, though Uncle Toby said some snakes do a lot of good in this world, by catching rats and mice. But he didn't bring in any snakes!\"  \"Do you mean to say he has a parrot?\" asked Mr. Martin.  \"Don't you hear him?\" questioned Mrs. Watson. \"Listen!\"  As she finished speaking the Curlytops heard a shrill:  \"Cracker! Cracker! Give Polly a crack-crack-cracker!\"  \"Oh, it _is_ a parrot!\" cried Janet in delight.  \"And is there a monkey, too?\" demanded Ted.  \"An' a han' ordan! Is dere a han' ordan?\" asked Trouble.  \"No hand organ, child, no,\" answered Mrs. Watson. \"But there is a monkey, a parrot, two dogs, and a cat, a----\"  \"Stop! Wait a moment!\" begged Mrs. Martin. She took a seat beside her husband on the top step. \"I just wanted to sit down before I fainted when I heard the worst,\" she went on. \"Now go ahead, Mrs. Watson. Tell me the rest. I'll have something to lean against in case she tells me there's an elephant.\"  \"An elephant!\" cried Janet.  \"Oh, I don't mean I want to lean on the elephant,\" said her mother. \"I just want to lean against the piazza post. This is the worst I ever heard of--Uncle Toby leaving us a menagerie!\"  \"'Tisn't quite as bad as that, though 'tis, almost,\" said Mrs. Watson. \"There isn't an elephant, but there is an alligator.\"  \"An alligator! Oh, that's great!\" cried Ted. \"Where is it?\"  \"This is terrible!\" declared his mother.  \"It's only a little alligator,\" explained the housekeeper. \"He's real friendly, though his tail scratches when he rubs it against your hand as you feed him.\"  \"Anything else?\" asked Mr. Martin. \"Please go on. We may as well hear the worst. It sounds like a circus that Uncle Toby kept in his house. What else, Mrs. Watson?\"  \"Well? that's about all, except some white rats and mice and the pigeons. Uncle Toby didn't get the snake he wanted.\"  \"Let us be thankful for that,\" murmured Mrs. Martin, \"though it is bad enough as it is.\"  \"Bad?\" cried Teddy. \"I think it's jolly! Can't we go in and see Uncle Toby's pets?\" he asked.  \"They're going to be our pets, aren't they, Daddy?\" asked Jan. \"Didn't Uncle Toby say you could have them?\"  \"That's what he said,\" replied the father of the Curlytops. \"But I don't know whether to take him at his word or not. But we may as well go in and look at the--the menagerie!\" he said to his wife, with a smile.  \"They'll need feeding--the animals will,\" said Mrs. Watson. \"I'm glad you're here to help me. I was staying only until you came. Uncle Toby said you'd be over in a day or two. I'm leaving to-night, now you're here.\"  \"What? And make us take care of all the pets?\" cried Mrs. Martin.  \"Oh, they're real kind and gentle--every one, even the little alligator,\" Uncle Toby's housekeeper made haste to say. \"And as long as you have children the pets will be just the things for the Curlytops. Only I can't stay much longer. I was just waiting for you. I went outside as it was quieter,\" she concluded, as, once again, the pet animals set up a screeching, barking and mewing.  \"Well, let's get it over with,\" suggested Mr."]]]
