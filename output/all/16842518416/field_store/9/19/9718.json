It would be glorious a day like this!\"  \"I'm not sure old Rogers,\" (that was the disrespectful way in which, I regret to say, we were wont to designate Dr Rogers, our head master) \"would like it,\" I said; \"he's got some notion into his head about currents and tides, and that makes him fidgety.\"  \"Currents and fiddlesticks!\" broke in Hall, with a laugh; \"what does _he_ know about them?  I tell you, a day like this, with a good sailing breeze, and four of us to row, in case it dropped, there'd be no more difficulty in going over there and back than there would in rowing from here back to Parkhurst.\"  \"How long would it take to get to Shargle?\" inquired Hutton.  \"Why, only two hours, and perhaps less.  The wind's exactly right for going and coming back too.  We can be back by four easily, and that allows us an hour or two to land there.\"  It certainly was tempting; the day was perfection, and Colveston Bay had never looked more fascinating.  The headlands stood out so distinctly in the clear air that it was hard to imagine Shargle Head was five miles distant from where we sat.  When the proposition had first been made I had felt a passing uncomfortableness as to the lawfulness of such an expedition without the distinct sanction of the head master; but the more I gazed on the bay, and the more Hall talked in his enthusiastic manner of the delights of a cruise, and the longer I watched the fairy-like progress of the little white-sailed fishing-boat, the less I thought of anything but the pleasure which the scheme offered.  So when Hall said, \"Shall we go, boys?  What do you say?\"  I for one replied, \"All serene.\"  All this while one of our party had been silent, watching the fishing- boat, but taking no part in our discussion.  He was Charlie Archer, a new boy at Parkhurst, and some years our junior.  But from the first I had taken a remarkable fancy to this clever, good-humoured, plucky boy, who henceforth had become my frequent companion, and with me the companion of the others who now composed our party.  He now looked up and said, greatly to our surprise--  \"I say, I don't want to go!\"  \"Why not?\" we all asked.  \"Oh, it doesn't matter,\" he replied, in evident confusion.  \"I don't want to spoil your fun, you know, but I'd rather not go myself.\"  \"Why, what on earth's the matter with you, Charlie?\"  I asked.  \"I thought you were always ready for an adventure.\"  \"I'd rather not go, please,\" he repeated.  \"You can put me ashore.\"  \"Why not?\" again inquired Hall, this time testily.  He never liked Charlie quite as much as Hutton and I did, and was evidently displeased to have him now putting forward objections to a proposition of his own making.  \"Why not?\"  \"Because--because,\" began the boy hesitatingly--\"because I don't want to go.\"  Hall became angry.  Like most boys not sure of the honesty of their own motives, he disliked to have it suggested that what he was urging was wrong.  He therefore replied, with a taunt keener than any persuasion--  \"Poor little milksop, I suppose he's afraid of getting drowned, or of doing something his mamma, or his grandmamma, or somebody wouldn't like their little pet to do.  We'd better put him ashore, boys; and mind his precious little boots don't get wet while we're about it!\"  It was a cruel blow, and struck home at Archer's one weak point.  Plucky and adventurous as he was, the one thing he could not endure was to be laughed at.  And his face flushed, and his lips quivered, as he heard Hall's brutal speech, and marked the smile with which, I am ashamed to say, we received it.  \"I'm _not_ afraid,\" he exclaimed.  \"Then why don't you want to go?\"  He was silent for some time.  A struggle was evidently going on in his mind.  But the sneer on Hall's face determined him.  \"I do want to go.  I've changed my mind!\"  \"That's the style,\" said Hutton, patting him on the back.  \"I knew you were one of the right sort.\"  Hall, too, condescended to approve of his decision, and at once began to busy himself with preparations for our immediate start.  I, however, was by no means comfortable at what had taken place.  It was plain to see Charlie had yielded against his better judgment, and that with whatever alacrity he might now throw himself into the scheme, his mind was not easy.  Had I been less selfishly inclined towards my own pleasure, I should have sided with him in his desire not to engage in a questionable proceeding; but, alas! my wishes in this case had ruled my conscience.  Still, I made one feeble effort on Archer's behalf.  \"Hall,\" whispered I, as I stooped with him to disengage the ropes at the bottom of the boat, \"what's the use of taking Charlie when he doesn't want to go?  We may as well put him ashore if he'd sooner not go.\"  \"Archer,\" said Hall, looking up from his ropes, \"did you say you wanted to go, or not?\"  The question was accompanied by a look which made it hard for the boy to reply anything but--  \"I want to go.\"  \"And it's your own free will, eh?\"  \"Yes.\"  So ended my weak effort.  If only I had been more determined to do right; if, alas!  I had imagined a thousandth part of what that day was to bring forth, I would have set Archer ashore, whether he would or not, even if to do so had cost me my life.  But this is anticipating.  For half an hour we were busy getting our boat trim for her voyage.  She was a somewhat old craft, in which for many years past we had been wont to cruise down the seaward reaches of the Colven, carrying one lug-sail, and with thwarts for two pairs of oars.  She was steady on her keel, and, as far as we had been able to judge, sound in every respect, and a good sailor.  Certainly, on a day like this, a cockleshell would have had nothing to fear, and we were half sorry we had not a lighter boat than the one we were in to take us across to Shargle.  Hall, who assumed the command from the first, impressed us not a little by the businesslike way in which he set to work to get everything ship- shape before starting.  He knew clearly the use of each rope and pulley; he knew precisely the necessary amount of ballast to be taken, and the proper place for stowing it; he discoursed learnedly on knots and hitches, and aroused our sympathy by his laments on the absence of a bowsprit and foresail.  Hutton was sent ashore to buy provisions. Charlie was set to baling out the boat.  I occupied myself with mopping the seats, and generally \"swabbing her up,\" as Hall called it, so that in due time we were ready to sail, well provisioned and well equipped, on our eventful voyage.  Up went the sail; we watched it first flap wildly, and then swell proudly in the wind as the sheet rope was drawn in, and Hall's hand put round the helm.  Then, after a little coquetting, as if she were loth to act as desired without coaxing, she rose lightly to the rippling waves, and glided forward on her way.  \"Adams,\" said Hall, \"you'd better make yourself snug up in the bows; Hutton, sit where you are, and be ready to help me with the sail when we tack.  Charlie, old boy, come down astern, beside me; sit a little farther over, Hutton.  Now she's trim.\"  Trim she was, and a strange feeling of exhilaration filled my breast as we now darted forward before the steady breeze, dancing over the waves with a merry splash, tossing them to either side of our prow, and listening to them as they gurgled musically under our keel.  \"There's Neil!\" cried Charlie, as we passed the coastguards' boathouse, \"spying at us through the telescope.\"  \"Let him spy,\" laughed Hall; \"I dare say he'd like to be coming too. It's slow work for those fellows, always hanging about doing nothing.\"  \"What's he waving about?\" inquired I from the bows, for we could see that the sailor had put down his glass, and was apparently trying to catch our attention by his gesticulations.  Hall looked attentively for a moment, and then said--  \"Oh, I see, he's pointing up at the flagstaff to show us the wind's in the north-east.  I suppose he thinks no one knows that but himself.\"  \"Let's see,\" said Hutton, \"we are going north-west, aren't we?\"  \"Yes, so we shall be able to make use of the wind both ways, with a little tacking.\"  \"He's shouting something now,\" said Charlie, with his eyes still on Neil.  \"Oh, he's an old woman,\" said Hall, laughing; \"he's always wanting to tell you this and that, as if no one knew anything about sailing but himself.\"  And he took off his hat and waved it ceremoniously to the old sailor, who continued shouting and beckoning all the while, though without avail, for the only words that came to us across the water were \"fresh\" and \"afternoon,\" and we were not much enlightened by them.  \"I'm afraid he's fresh in the morning,\" laughed Hutton.  A short sail brought us to the bar mouth, over which, as the tide was in and the sea quiet, we passed without difficulty, although Hall had bade us have the oars ready in case of emergency, should it be necessary to lower our sail in crossing.  But of this there was no need, and in a minute we were at last in the bay, and fairly at sea.  \"Do you see Parkhurst over the trees there, you fellows?\" cried Charlie, pointing behind us.  \"I never saw the place from the bay before.\"  \"Nor I,\" I answered; \"it looks better here than from any other side.\"  We were all proud of the old school-house, and fully impressed with its superiority over any other building of the kind in the kingdom.  The view in the bay was extremely beautiful, Shargle Head stood out opposite us, distinct and grand, towering up from the water, and sweeping back to join the moorland hills behind.  On our left, close beside the bar mouth, rose Raven Cliff, where we so often had been"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21138"],["title","Love's Meinie: Three Lectures on Greek and English Birds (#0)"],["body","LOVE'S MEINIE.

BRANTWOOD, 9_th June_, 1881.  _Quarter past five, morning._  The birds chirping feebly,--mostly chaffinches answering each other, the rest discomposed, I fancy, by the June snow;[1] the lake neither smooth nor rippled, but like a surface of perfectly bright glass, ill cast; the lines of wave few and irregular, like flaws in the planes of a fine crystal.        [1] The summits of the Old Man, of Wetherlam, and Helvellyn,       were all white, on the morning when this was written.  I see this book was begun eight years ago;--then intended to contain only four Oxford lectures: but the said lectures also 'intended' to contain the cream of forty volumes of scientific ornithology. Which intentions, all and sundry, having gone, Carlyle would have said, to water, and more piously-minded persons, to fire, I am obliged now to cast my materials into another form: and here, at all events, is a bundle of what is readiest under my hand. The nature and name of which I must try to make a little more intelligible than my books have lately been, either in text or title.  'Meinie' is the old English word for 'Many,' in the sense of 'a many' persons attending one, as bridesmaids, when in sixes or tens or dozens;--courtiers, footmen, and the like. It passes gradually into 'Menial,' and unites the senses of Multitude and Servitude.  In the passages quoted from, or referred to in, Chaucer's translation of the Romance of the Rose, at the end of the first lecture, any reader who cares for a clue to the farther significances of the title, may find one to lead him safely through richer labyrinths of thought than mine: and ladder enough also,--if there be either any heavenly, or pure earthly, Love, in his own breast,--to guide him to a pretty bird's nest; both in the Romances of the Rose and of Juliet, and in the Sermons of St. Francis and St. Bernard.  The term 'Lecture' is retained, for though I lecture no more, I still write habitually in a manner suited for oral delivery, and imagine myself speaking to my pupils, if ever I am happily thinking in myself. But it will be also seen that by the help of this very familiarity of style, I am endeavoring, in these and my other writings on Natural History, to compel in the student a clearness of thought and precision of language which have not hitherto been in any wise the virtues, or skills, of scientific persons. Thoughtless readers, who imagine that my own style (such as it is, the one thing which the British public concedes to me as a real power) has been formed without pains, may smile at the confidence with which I speak of altering accepted, and even long-established, nomenclature. But the use which I now have of language has taken me forty years to attain; and those forty years spent, mostly, in walking through the wilderness of this world's vain words, seeking how they might be pruned into some better strength. And I think it likely that at last I may put in my pruning-hook with effect; for indeed a time must come when English fathers and mothers will wish their children to learn English again, and to speak it for all scholarly purposes; and, if they use, instead, Greek or Latin, to use them only that they may be understood by Greeks or Latins;[2] and not that they may mystify the illiterate many of their own land. Dead languages, so called, may at least be left at rest, if not honored; and must not be torn in mutilation out of their tumuli, that the skins and bones of them may help to hold our living nonsense together; while languages called living, but which live only to slack themselves into slang, or bloat themselves into bombast, must one day have new grammars written for their license, and new laws for their insolence.        [2] Greek is now a living nation's language, from Messina to       Delos--and Latin still lives for the well-trained churchmen       and gentlemen of Italy.  Observe, however, that the recast methods of classification adopted in this book, and in 'Proserpina,' must be carefully distinguished from their recastings of nomenclature. I am perfectly sure that it is wiser to use plain short words than obscure long ones; but not in the least sure that I am doing the best that can be done for my pupils, in classing swallows with owls, or milkworts with violets. The classification is always given as tentative; and, at its utmost, elementary: but the nomenclature, as in all probability conclusive.  For the rest, the success and the service of all depend on the more or less thorough accomplishment of plans long since laid, and which would have been good for little if their coping could at once have been conjectured or foretold in their foundations. It has been throughout my trust, that if Death should write on these, \"What this man began to build, he was not able to finish,\" God may also write on them, not in anger, but in aid,      \"A stronger than he, cometh.\"     LOVE'S MEINIE.  \"Il etoit tout convert d'oisiaulx.\"                             _Romance of the Rose._     LECTURE I.[3]  THE ROBIN.   1. Among the more splendid pictures in the Exhibition of the Old Masters, this year, you cannot but remember the Vandyke portraits of the two sons of the Duke of Lennox. I think you cannot but remember it, because it would be difficult to find, even among the works of Vandyke, a more striking representation of the youth of our English noblesse; nor one in which the painter had more exerted himself, or with better success, in rendering the decorous pride and natural grace of honorable aristocracy.        [3] Delivered at Oxford, March 15th, 1873.  Vandyke is, however, inferior to Titian and Velasquez, in that his effort to show this noblesse of air and persons may always be detected; also the aristocracy of Vandyke's day were already so far fearful of their own position as to feel anxiety that it should be immediately recognized. And the effect of the painter's conscious deference, and of the equally conscious pride of the boys, as they stood to be painted, has been somewhat to shorten the power of the one, and to abase the dignity of the other. And thus, in the midst of my admiration of the youths' beautiful faces, and natural quality of majesty, set off by all splendors of dress and courtesies of art, I could not forbear questioning with myself what the true value was, in the scales of creation, of these fair human beings who set so high a value on themselves; and,--as if the only answer,--the words kept repeating themselves in my ear, \"Ye are of more value than many sparrows.\"  2. Passeres, [Greek: strouthos]--the things that open their wings, and are not otherwise noticeable; small birds of the land and wood; the food of the serpent, of man, or of the stronger creatures of their own kind,--that even these, though among the simplest and obscurest of beings, have yet price in the eyes of their Maker, and that the death of one of them cannot take place but by His permission, has long been the subject of declamation in our pulpits, and the ground of much sentiment in nursery education. But the declamation is so aimless, and the sentiment so hollow, that, practically, the chief interest of the leisure of mankind has been found in the destruction of the creatures which they professed to believe even the Most High would not see perish without pity; and, in recent days, it is fast becoming the only definition of aristocracy, that the principal business of its life is the killing of sparrows.  Sparrows, or pigeons, or partridges, what does it matter? \"Centum mille perdrices plumbo confecit;\"[4] that is, indeed, too often the sum of the life of an English lord; much questionable now, if _indeed_ of more value than that of many sparrows.        [4] The epitaph on Count Zachdarm, in \"Sartor Resartus.\"  3. Is it not a strange fact, that, interested in nothing so much for the last two hundred years, as in his horses, he yet left it to the farmers of Scotland to relieve draught horses from the bearing-rein?[5] Is it not one equally strange that, master of the forests of England for a thousand years, and of its libraries for three hundred, he left the natural history of birds to be written by a card-printer's lad of Newcastle?[6] Written, and not written, for indeed we have no natural history of birds written yet. It cannot be written but by a scholar and a gentleman; and no English gentleman in recent times has ever thought of birds except as flying targets, or flavorous dishes. The only piece of natural history worth the name in the English language, that I know of, is in the few lines of Milton on the Creation. The only example of a proper manner of contribution to natural history is in White's Letters from Selborne. You know I have always spoken of Bewick as pre-eminently a vulgar or boorish person, though of splendid honor and genius; his vulgarity shows in nothing so much as in the poverty of the details he has collected, with the best intentions, and the shrewdest sense, for English ornithology. His imagination is not cultivated enough to enable him to choose, or arrange.        [5] Sir Arthur Helps. \"Animals and their Masters,\" p. 67.        [6] Ariadne Florentina, vi. 45.  4.
