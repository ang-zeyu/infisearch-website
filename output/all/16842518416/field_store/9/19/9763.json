It was a true _rogue_--Ossaroo had long since pronounced it one--and an \"old tusker\" at that.  It was therefore a most dangerous creature; and though they knew they would never be safe in that valley until it should be destroyed, it was agreed by all that it would be more prudent to leave it undisturbed until some more favourable opportunity occurred for effecting its destruction.  For these various reasons they resolved to remain quiet in the tree, and patiently await the termination of that curious \"ring performance,\" which the old tusker still continued to keep up.    CHAPTER THIRTEEN.  AN ODD APPEARANCE.  For the full length of another hour did the trio in the tree have their patience tested.  During all that time the \"rogue\" remained upon the ground, continuing his perambulations around the rock--until he had trodden out a path that resembled the arena of a circus at the close of a night's performance.  It is not necessary to say that the time hung heavily upon the hands of the spectators--to say nothing of Fritz, who would no doubt have been satisfied with a much shorter programme.  As regards the former, the hour might have been spent less pleasantly than it was; for it so chanced that an _interlude_ was introduced, of so interesting a character to all, but more especially to the naturalist Karl, that for a while the proximity of their savage besieger was forgotten, and they scarcely remembered that they were besieged.  Favoured by the accident of their situation, they became spectators of a scene--one of those scenes only to be viewed amid the wild solitudes of Nature.  Not far from the tree on which they had found shelter, stood another of equal dimensions, but of an entirely different species.  It was a sycamore, as even Caspar, without any botanical skill, could testify. Its smooth bark, piebald with white and green spots, its widely-straggling limbs and leaves, left no doubt about its being one. It was the sycamore, identical with its European congener, the _Platanus orientalis_.  It is the habit of this fine tree to become hollow.  Not only does the lower part of its trunk exhibit the phenomenon of great cavities, but holes are found high up in its main shaft or in the larger limbs.  The tree in question stood within a few yards of that on which Karl, Caspar, and Ossaroo were perched.  It was just before their eyes, whenever they looked in a horizontal direction; and occasionally, when tired with watching the monotonous movements of the elephant, one or other of them _did_ look horizontally.  The scanty foliage upon the sycamore enabled them to see its trunk and most of its larger limbs, without any obstruction of leaves or branches.  Caspar had not cast his eyes more than twice in the direction of this tree, when he saw there was something peculiar about it.  Caspar was a youth of quick sight and equally quick perception.  In the main stem of the tree, and about six feet above its first forking, he perceived an object that at once fixed his attention.  It looked like a goat's horn, only that it was more like the curving tusk of a rhinoceros or a very young elephant.  It was sticking out from the tree, with the curve directed downwards.  Altogether, it looked quite different from a branch of the sycamore, or anything belonging to the tree.  Once or twice, while Caspar had his eyes upon it, he thought or fancied that it moved; but not being sure of this, he said nothing, lest the others might laugh at him.  It would not have been the first time that Karl, from his superior knowledge, had indulged in a laugh at his brother's expense.  Caspar's attention being now engrossed by the peculiar appearance he had noted, he continued to scrutinise it; and soon perceived that around the curved excrescence there was a circular disc some eight or ten inches in diameter, and differing in colour from the bark of the sycamore--by being many shades darker.  This disc appeared composed of some substance that was not ligneous: for it no more resembled wood than the curved ivory-like object that protruded from its centre.  Had Caspar been asked what it did look like, he would have answered that it resembled the agglutinated mud used by swallows in building their nests--so like it, that it might have been the same substance.  Caspar continued to scrutinise these two curious objects--the tusk-like excrescence, and the dark disc from which it protruded; and not until he became fully aware that the former had life in it, did he communicate his discovery to his companions.  Of this fact he was convinced by seeing the crescent suddenly disappear--as if drawn within the tree, while in its place a dark round hole was alone visible.  Presently the yellowish horn reappeared through the hole, and protruded outside, filling it up as before!  Caspar was too much astonished by this exhibition to remain any longer the sole proprietor of such a mysterious secret, and without more delay he communicated his discovery to Karl, and indirectly to Ossaroo.  Both at the same time turned their eyes towards the tree, and bent them upon the indicated spot.  Karl was as much mystified by the strange appearance as had been Caspar himself.  Not so Ossaroo.  The moment he saw the carving ivory and the dark-coloured disc, he pronounced, in a tone of careless indifference, the simple phrase,--  \"_Hornbill_--_de bird on him nest_.\"    CHAPTER FOURTEEN.  A CURIOUS NEST.  Just then the curved projection was observed to recede within the tree; and in its place appeared a small dark hole, apparently the entrance to a larger cavity.  Karl, as Caspar had done the moment before, saw this with surprise.  \"Nest?\" repeated Caspar, astonished at the shikaree's statement.  \"A bird's nest?  Is that what you mean, Ossy?\"  \"That just it, sahib.  Nest of great biggee bird.  Feringhees him call _horneebill_.\"  \"Well,\" rejoined Caspar, not greatly enlightened by Ossaroo's explanation, \"that's very curious.  We have seen something like a horn sticking out of the tree, though it looks more like ivory than horn.  It may be the bill of a bird; but as to a bird itself, or the nest of one, where is that, pray?\"  Ossaroo intimated that the nest was inside the tree; and that the bird was on the nest just behind its beak, where it ought to be.  \"What! the bird is in that hole where we saw the white thing sticking out?  Why, it quite filled the hole, and if there's a bird there, and what we saw be its bill, I have only to say that its bill must be as big as its body--else how can it get out and in through so small an aperture?  Certainly I see no hole but the one.  Oh! perhaps the bird is a _toucan_.  I have heard there are some of that sort that can go through any place where they can pass their beaks.  Is it a toucan, Ossaroo?\"  Ossaroo could not tell what a toucan was, never having heard of such a bird.  His ornithological knowledge went no further than to the birds of Bengal; and the toucan is found only in America.  He stated that the bird in the tree was called by the Feringhees a \"hornbill,\" but it was also known to some as the \"rhinoceros bird.\"  Ossaroo added that it was as large as a goose; and that its body was many times thicker than its bill, thick as the latter appeared to be.  \"And you say it has its nest inside that hole?\" interrogated Caspar, pointing to the little round aperture, which did not appear to be over three inches in diameter.  \"Sure of it, young sahib,\" was Ossaroo's reply.  \"Well, certainly there is some living creature in there, since we have seen it move; and if it be a bird as large as a goose, will you explain to me how it got in, and how it means to get out?  There must be a larger entrance on the other side of the tree.\"  \"No, sahib,\" confidently asserted Ossaroo; \"that you see before your eye--that the only way to de horneebill nest.\"  \"Hurrah for you, Ossy!  So you mean to say that a bird as large as a goose can go in and out by that hole?  Why, a sparrow could scarcely squeeze itself through there!\"  \"Horneebill he no goee in, he no goee out.  He stay inside till him little chickees ready for leavee nest.\"  \"Come, Ossy!\" said Caspar, in a bantering way; \"that story is too good to be true.  You don't expect us to believe all that?  What, stay in the nest till the young are ready to leave it!  And how then?  How will the young ones help their mother out of the scrape?  How will they get out themselves: for I suppose they don't leave the nest till they are pretty well grown?  Come! good shikaree; let us have no more circumlocution about the matter, but explain all these apparently inexplicable circumstances.\"  The shikaree, thus appealed to, proceeded to give the explanation demanded.  The hornbill, he said, when about to bring forth its young, selects a hollow in some tree, just large enough conveniently to hold the nest which it builds, and also its own body.  As soon as the nest is constructed and the eggs all laid, the female bird takes her seat upon them, and there remains; not only until the eggs are hatched, but for a long time afterwards--in fact, until the young are nearly fledged and able to take care of themselves.  In order that she may be protected during the period of her incubation against weasels, polecats, ichneumons, and all such vermin, a design exhibiting either wonderful instinct or sagacity, is carried into execution by the male.  As soon as his mate has squatted upon her eggs, he goes to work at the masonic art; and using his great horned mandibles, first as a hod, and afterwards as a trowel, he walls up the entrance to the nest--leaving an aperture just large enough to be filled up by the beak of the female.  The material employed by him for this purpose is a kind of agglutinated mud, which he procures from the neighbouring watercourse or quagmire, and somewhat similar to that used by the common house-swallow"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21240"],["title","The Lone Ranche (#0)"],["body","Lone Ranche A Tale of the Staked Plain  By Captain Mayne Reid ________________________________________________________________________ This was quite a hard book to transcribe, and I hope there are not now too many errors remaining.  For one thing several of the people of the book speak a very rough version of the language, so that there are many hundreds of \"words\" appearing in the book, that are not in the dictionary.  And the \"new\" words are not always consistently spelt.  There are numerous Spanish or Mexican words used in the book, but I am no scholar in these tongues.  I just did my best to get them right.  Another problem was that the type used to print the book had been damaged in many places, which meant that it was sometimes very hard to decipher.  After much poring there remains only one damaged word in the book, of which I am not certain.  As if this were not enough I made the mistake of scanning the book too dark, which meant that in very many cases a full stop following the letters `t' and sometimes `e' had not come correctly through the OCR process; and also any stains on the pages obscured the letters under them.  This greatly increased the amount of work needed to transcribe the book.  I suppose this is among the very first \"cowboy and Indian\" books.

NH ________________________________________________________________________  THE LONE RANCHE A TALE OF THE STAKED PLAIN  BY CAPTAIN MAYNE REID    CHAPTER ONE.  A TALE OF THE STAKED PLAIN.  \"HATS OFF!\"  Within the city of Chihuahua, metropolis of the northern provinces of Mexico--for the most part built of mud--standing in the midst of vast barren plains, o'ertopped by bold porphyritic mountains--plains with a population sparse as their timber--in the old city of Chihuahua lies the first scene of our story.  Less than twenty thousand people dwell within the walls of this North Mexican metropolis, and in the country surrounding it a like limited number.  Once they were thicker on the soil; but the tomahawk of the Comanche and the spear of the Apache have thinned off the descendants of the _Conquistadores_, until country houses stand at wide distances apart, with more than an equal number of ruins between.  Yet this same city of Chihuahua challenges weird and wonderful memories. At the mention of its name springs up a host of strange records, the souvenirs of a frontier life altogether different from that wreathed round the history of Anglo-American borderland.  It recalls the cowled monk with his cross, and the soldier close following with his sword; the old mission-house, with its church and garrison beside it; the fierce savage lured from a roving life, and changed into a toiling _peon_, afterwards to revolt against a system of slavery that even religion failed to make endurable; the neophyte turning his hand against his priestly instructor, equally his oppressor; revolt followed by a deluge of blood, with ruinous devastation, until the walls of both _mission_ and military _cuartel_ are left tenantless, and the redskin has returned to his roving.  Such a history has had the city of Chihuahua and the settlements in its neighbourhood.  Nor is the latter portion of it all a chronicle of the olden time.  Much of it belongs to modern days; ay, similar scenes are transpiring even now.  But a few years ago a stranger entering its gates would have seen nailed overhead, and whisked to and fro by the wind, some scores of objects similar to one another, and resembling tufts of hair, long, trailing, and black, as if taken from the manes or tails of horses.  But it came not thence; it was human hair; and the patches of skin that served to keep the bunches together had been stripped from human skulls!  They were _scalps_--the scalps of Indians, showing that the Comanche and Apache savages had not had it all their own way.  Beside them could be seen other elevated objects of auricle shape, set in rows or circles like a festooning of child peppers strung up for preservation.  No doubt their procurement had drawn tears from the eyes of those whose heads had furnished them, for they were human ears!  These ghastly souvenirs were the _bounty warrants_ of a band whose deeds have been already chronicled by this same pen.  They were the trophies of \"Scalp Hunters\"--vouchers for the number of Indians they had killed.  They were there less than a quarter of a century ago, waving in the dry wind that sweeps over the plains of Chihuahua.  For aught the writer knows, they may be there still; or, if not the same, others of like gory record replacing or supplementing them.  It is not with the \"Scalp Hunters\" we have now to do--only with the city of Chihuahua.  And not much with it either.  A single scene occurring in its streets is all of Chihuahuaense life to be depicted in this tale.  It was the spectacle of a religious procession--a thing far from uncommon in Chihuahua or any other Mexican town; on the contrary, so common that at least weekly the like may be witnessed.  This was one of the grandest, representing the story of the Crucifixion.  Citizens of all classes assisted at the ceremony, the soldiery also taking part in it.  The clergy, of course, both secular and regular, were its chief supports and propagators.  To them it brought bread, and if not butter-- since there is none in Chihuahua--it added to their incomes and influence, by the sale of leaden crosses, images of the Virgin Mother, and the numerous sisterhood of saints.  In the _funcion_ figured the usual Scripture characters:--The Redeemer conducted to the place of Passion; the crucifix, borne on the shoulders of a brawny, brown-skinned Simon; Pilate the oppressor; Judas the betrayer--in short, every prominent personage spoken of as having been present on that occasion when the Son of Man suffered for our sins.  There is, or was then, an American hotel in Chihuahua, or at least one conducted in the American fashion, though only a mere _posada_.  Among its guests was a gentleman, stranger to the town, as the country.  His dress and general appearance bespoke him from the States, and by the same tokens it could be told that he belonged to their southern section. He was in truth a Kentuckian; but so far from representing the type, tall, rough, and stalwart, usually ascribed to the people \"Kaintuck,\" he was a man of medium size, with a build comparable to that of the Belvidere Apollo.  He had a figure tersely set, with limbs well knitted; a handsome face and features of amiable cast, at the same time expressing confidence and courage.  A costly Guayaquil hat upon his head, and coat to correspond, bespoke him respectable; his _tout ensemble_ proclaimed him a man of leisure; while his air and bearing were unmistakably such as could only belong to a born gentleman.  Why he was in Chihuahua, or whence he had come to it, no one seemed to know or care.  Enough that he was there, and gazing at the spectacular procession as it filed past the posada.  He was regarding it with no eye of wonderment.  In all likelihood he had seen such before.  He could not have travelled far through Mexico without witnessing some ceremony of a similar kind.  Whether interested in this one or no he was soon notified that he was not regarding it in the manner proper or customary to the country. Standing half behind one of the pillars of the hotel porch, he had not thought it necessary to take off his hat.  Perhaps placed in a more conspicuous position he would have done this.  Frank Hamersley--for such was his name--was not the sort of man to seek notoriety by an exhibition of bravado, and, being a Protestant of a most liberal creed, he would have shrunk from offending the slightest sensibilities of those belonging to an opposite faith--even the most bigoted Roman Catholic of that most bigoted land.  That his \"Guayaquil\" still remained upon his head was due to simple forgetfulness of its being there; it had not occurred to him to uncover.  While silently standing with eyes turned towards the procession, he observed scowling looks, and heard low growlings from the crowd as it swayed slowly past.  He knew enough to be conscious of what this meant; but he felt at the same time disinclined to humiliate himself by a too facile compliance.  A proud American, in the midst of a people he had learned to despise--their idolatrous observances along with them--no wonder he should feel a little defiant and a good deal exasperated. Enough yielding, he thought, to withdraw farther back from behind the pillar, which he did.  It was too late.  The keen eye of a fanatic had been upon him--one who appeared to have authority for meting out chastisement.  An officer, bearded and grandly bedizened, riding at the head of a troop of lancers, quickly wheeled his horse from out of the line of march, and spurred him towards the porch of the posada.  In another instant his bared blade was waving over the hatted head of the Kentuckian.  \"_Gringo! alto su sombrero!  Abajo! a sus rodillas_!\"  (\"Off with your hat, greenhorn!  Down upon your knees!\") were the words that came hissing from the moustached lips of the lancer.  As they failed to beget compliance, they were instantly followed by a blow from the blade of his sabre.  It was given sideways, but with sufficient sleight and force to send the Guayaquil hat whirling over the pavement, and its wearer reeling against the wall.  It was but the stagger of a sudden and unexpected surprise.  In another instant the \"gringo\" had drawn a revolving pistol, and in yet another its bullet would have been through the brain of the swaggering aggressor, but for a third personage, who, rushing from behind, laid hold of the Kentuckian's arm, and restrained the firing.  At first it seemed to Hamersley the act of another enemy; but in a moment he knew it to be the behaviour of a friend--at least a pacificator bent upon seeing fair play.  \"You are wrong, Captain Uraga,\""]]]
