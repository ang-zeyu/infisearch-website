NH. ________________________________________________________________________ THE ADVENTURES OF A THREE-GUINEA WATCH  BY TALBOT BAINES REED    CHAPTER ONE.  MY INFANCY AND EDUCATION--HOW I WAS SOLD AND WHO BOUGHT ME.  \"Then you can guarantee it to be a good one to go?\"  \"You couldn't have a better, sir.\"  \"And it will stand a little roughish wear, you think?\"  \"I'm sure of it, sir; it's an uncommon strong watch.\"  \"Then I'll take it.\"  These few sentences determined my destiny, and from that moment my career may be said to have begun.  I am old, and run down, and good for nothing now; but many a time do I find my thoughts wandering back to this far-off day; and remembering all that has befallen me since that eventful moment, I humbly hope my life has not been one to disgrace the good character with which I went out into the world.  I was young at the time, very young--scarcely a month old.  Watches however, as every one knows, are a good deal more precocious in their infancy than human beings.  They generally settle down to business as soon as they are born, without having to spend much of their time either in the nursery or the schoolroom.  Indeed, after my face and hands had once been well cleaned, and a brand- new shiny coat had been put on my back, it was years before I found myself again called upon to submit to that operation which is such a terror to all mortal children.  As to my education, it lasted just a week; and although I am bound to say, while it lasted, it was both carefully and skilfully managed, I did not at all fancy the discipline I was subjected to in the process.  I used to be handed over to a creature who took me up and examined me (as if he were a policeman and a magistrate combined), and according as I answered his questions he exclaimed, \"You're going too fast,\" or \"You're going too slow,\" and with that he set himself to \"regulate\" me, as he called it.  I was ordered to turn round, take off my coat, and submit my poor shoulders to his instrument of correction.  But why need I describe this experience to boys?  They know what \"regulating\" means as well as I do!  Well in due time I profited by the instructions received, and one day my tutor, after the usual examination, grumpily told me, \"You're right at last; you can go.\"  And I did go, and I've been going ever since.  The troubles of my infancy however were not all over.  I discovered at a very early age that the one thing a watch is never allowed to do is to go to sleep.  They'd as soon think of leaving an infant to starve as of letting a watch go to sleep.  But to my story.  Ever since I had left school--or, in other words, gone through my due course of regulation--I had remained shut up under a glass-case, lying comfortably upon a bed of purple velvet, and decorated with a little white label bearing the mysterious inscription, \"Only Three Guineas.\"  From this stately repose I was only once a day disturbed in order to be kept from sleeping, and had all the rest of my time to look about me and observe what went on in the world in which I found myself.  It was not a big world indeed, but I could see I was not the only inhabitant.  All around me were watches like myself, some of a golden complexion, and some--of which I was one--of a silvery.  Some were big, and made an awful noise, and some were tiny, and just whispered what they had to say.  Some were very proud, and showed off their jewels and chains in a way which made me blush for the vanity of my fellow- creatures--\"dear\" watches, the ladies called these, and others were as plain as plain could be.  Every now and then our case would be opened, and one of my neighbours taken out and never put back.  Then we knew he had been sold, and we who were left spent our time in gossiping about what had become of him, and speculating whose turn would come next.  A gold repeater near me was very confident the turn would be his, and so impressed us with the sense of his \"striking\" importance and claims, that when the next time our glass house was entered, and a hand came groping in our direction, I at once concluded it was his summons into publicity and honour.  Imagine my astonishment, then, when the hand, instead of reaching my gold neighbour, took hold of me and cautiously drew me out of the case!  My heart leaped to my mouth--or whatever part of a watch's anatomy corresponds with that organ--and I was ready to faint with excitement. I had always imagined I was to lie in that case for years, but now, when I was barely a month old, here was I going out into the world.  It made me quite bashful to listen to all the flattering things my master said of me.  I was worth twice the price he was selling me at, he said; in fact, if trade had been good he would not have parted with me under three times that price.  It was a relief to think the repeater could not overhear this, or he would have sneered in a way to extinguish me altogether.  As it was, no other watch was by, so that I was not very much embarrassed.  After turning me over, and feeling my pulse, and listening to the beating of my heart, and taking off my coat and waistcoat to inspect my muscle, my master's customer at last laid me down on the counter and pronounced the sentences with which I have begun my story.  \"Then I'll take it,\" he said, and pulled out his purse.  \"Stop a bit, though!\" exclaimed he; \"I'd better have a chain too, my little chap will think more of that than the watch.  Let me see some silver chains, will you?\"  So my master went and fetched a tray containing a large number of tempting-looking chains.  While he was gone my new owner took me up again in his hand and turned me over and put me to his ear; then as he laid me down again he smiled to himself and murmured.  \"Bless his little heart! how proud he'll be!\"  I was quite taken aback.  Who was this taking upon himself to bless my little heart and prophesy that I should be proud?  Then all of a sudden it occurred to me this remark may have been intended to refer not to me, but to the \"little chap\" the gentleman had just now spoken of.  So I recovered my composure, especially when I saw what a kind, gentle face my purchaser had.  He chose a neat, strong silver chain which was forthwith, in accordance with the barbarous practice of the age, fixed to my poor neck.  I could not help sighing as I felt for the first time the burden of bondage.  What had I done to be thus chained like a Roman captive, like a dog, like a parrot?  But it was no use being in a rage.  I swallowed my indignation as well as I could, and consoled myself with the reflection that every watch, even gold repeaters themselves, are subject to the same hardship.  Ah!  I was young then, and my knowledge of the world was small.  Many a time since I have blessed the chain that held me, just as the ship, could it speak, would bless the cable that saved it from the rocks. Take the advice of an old ticker, you young watches, and instead of rebelling against your chains, rather hope they may be strong and sound in every link!  \"That will be just five pounds, won't it?\" said my purchaser.  \"Here is a bank note.  Never mind about doing it up, I'll just slip it into my pocket.  Good-morning.\"  And with that I was conscious of being lowered into a dark, deep pit, and without time to bid my comrades good-bye, or to take a last look at my old master, I felt myself hurried away I knew not whither.  This, then, was my first step into the world.  I lay untouched and apparently forgotten for several hours.  Gradually getting my eyes accustomed to the darkness, and looking about me as far as I was able, I heard a ticking going on in a pocket not very far from the one I was in, which I at once concluded to proceed from the watch of my new master.  Thinking I might be able to gain some information from him, I groped about till I found a small hole in my lodgings through which I was able to peep, and call.  \"Tick!\" said I, as loud as I could, to secure the attention of my fellow-watch.  \"Who's that?\" at once exclaimed the other.  \"I'm a new watch, bought to-day.\"  \"Humph!  How much?\"  \"Three guineas.\"  \"Chain and all?\"  \"No; five pounds with the chain.\"  \"Humph, I cost thirty guineas.  Never mind, you're for the boy.\"  \"What boy?\"  \"The governor's.  I heard him say he was going to get him one.  That boy will be spoiled, as sure as I go on springs; he's made such a lot of. Have you been regulated?\"  \"I should think I have!\" exclaimed I, in indignant recollection of my education.  \"All right; keep your temper.  What time are you?\"  \"Seven minutes to six.\"  \"Wrong!  It's seven and three-quarters!\"  \"How do you know?\"  \"Because that's what I make it.\"  \"How do you know you are right?\"  I asked, wondering at my own impudence in thus questioning an old ticker.  \"Look here, young fellow,\" said the other in an awful voice; \"you don't seem to know you are addressing a gold watch that has neither gained nor lost a minute for five years!  There!  You may think yourself clever; but you're too fast.\"  \"I'm sure I beg your--\"  \"That'll do!\" said the offended"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21035"],["title","The Adventures of a Three-Guinea Watch (#1)"],["body",".  \"I want no more words.\"  I was completely shut up at this, and retired back to my pocket very crestfallen.  Presently I began to feel drowsy; my nerves seemed to get unstrung, and my circulation flagged.  It was long after the time I had generally been in the habit of being wound up; and I began to be afraid I was really going to be left to go to sleep.  That, by this time, I knew would be nothing short of a calamity.  I therefore gave a slight tug at my chain.  \"What's the matter?\" it said, looking down.  \"I've not been wound up.\"  \"I can't help that,\" said the chain.  \"Can't you let him know somehow?\"  I gasped, faintly.  \"How can I?  He's busy packing up books.\"  \"Couldn't you catch yourself in his fingers or something?  I'm in a bad way.\"  \"I'll see,\" said the chain.  Presently I felt an awful tug at my neck, and I knew the chain had managed to entangle itself somehow with his fingers.  \"Hullo!\"  I heard my master exclaim, \"I mustn't smash Charlie's chain before I give it to him.  I'd better put it and the watch away in my drawer till the morning.  Heigho! it'll be a sad day for me to-morrow!\"  As he spoke he drew me from the pocket, and, disengaging the chain from his button-hole, he laid us both in a drawer and shut it up.  I was in despair, and already was nearly swooning from weakness.  He had shut the drawer, and his hand was still on the knob, when all of a sudden he exclaimed,--  \"By the way, I must wind it up, or it'll stop!\"  With what joy and relief I saw the drawer again opened, and felt myself taken out and wound up!  Instantly new life seemed to infuse itself through my frame; my circulation revived, my nerves were strung again, and my drooping heart resumed its usual healthy throb.  Little did my master think of the difference this winding up made to my health and comfort.  \"Now you're happy!\" said the chain, as we found ourselves once more in the drawer.  \"Yes; I'm all right now, I'm glad to say,\" said I.  \"What's going to happen to us to-morrow?\"  I asked presently.  \"We're going to be given to the boy, and he's going to school;\" so the silver chain told me.  \"Nice time we shall have of it, I expect.\"  After that he went to sleep, and I fell to counting the seconds, and wondering what sort of life I was destined to lead.  About an hour after I heard two voices talking in the room.  \"Well,\" said one, and I recognised it at once as my master's, \"the packing's all finished at last.\"  \"Ah, Charles,\" said the other, and it seemed to be a woman's voice speaking amid tears, \"I never thought it would be so hard to part with him.\"  \"Tut, tut!\" said the first, \"you mustn't give way, Mary.  You women are so ready to break down.  He'll soon be back;\" but before my master had got to the end of his sentence he too had broken down.  For a long time they talked about their boy, their fine boy who had never before left his parents' roof, and was about now to step out into the treacherous world.  How they trembled for him, yet how proudly and confidently they spoke of his prospects; how lovingly they recalled all their life together, from the days when he could first toddle about, down to the present.  Many tears were mingled with their talk, and many a smothered sob bespoke a desperate effort to subdue their common sorrow.  At last they became quieter, then I heard my master say,--  \"I positively have never shown you the watch I got for him,\" and with that he opened the drawer and produced me.  \"Oh, Charles,\" cried the mother, \"how delighted he will be, and what a capital watch it is!\"  And she looked at me affectionately for a long time, for her son's sake, smiling through her tears, and then put me back.  Need I say that as these two knelt together that night, their only son was not forgotten in their prayers?  So ended the first day of my adventures.    CHAPTER TWO.  HOW I WAS PRESENTED TO A BOY, AND OF A CERTAIN JOURNEY WE TOOK TOGETHER.  Very early next morning, when my hands scarcely pointed to five o'clock, the little household was astir.  There was a noise of hurried going and coming, and of trunks being carried down stairs, and for the first time I heard mingled with the sedate voices of my master and his wife, another voice, cheery and musical, which I at once guessed to belong to my future lord and master.  It was not till after this bustle had been going on for a good while that I was taken out of the drawer and put back into the pocket in which I had spent so many anxious hours the day before.  But here I was destined not to remain long, as will be seen.  Breakfast was a sad meal to that little family.  Even the gay, high- spirited boy was sobered in anticipation of the coming parting, and as to his parents, they dared not open their lips for fear of breaking down.  Then there was a rumbling of wheels in the street, and a banging about of boxes at the hall door; then a last long embrace between mother and son.  She no longer resisted her grief, and he for the time forgot everything but her he was leaving; then father and son stepped into the cab and drove away.  I felt the father's heart beating quicker and his chest heaving deeper as we proceeded.  Presently his hand stole to the pocket where I lay hid, and he said--  \"Charlie, boy, I've said all I have to say to you.  You will remember our talk last night, I am sure, and I shall remember it too.  I have no greater wish than to see my boy brave and honest and true to himself. Remember always I am your father, and never hesitate to tell me whenever you are in trouble, or danger, or--and I hope this won't often be--in disgrace.  See here,\" said he, drawing me forth, \"this is a watch which your mother and I have got for you.  Think of us when you use it; and mind this, Charlie, make the best use of time, or time will become your enemy.\"  The poor man faltered out these words with a half-broken heart, as he handed me to his son.  The boy's eyes brightened and his face became radiant at the sight of his unexpected treasure.  What boy does not covet a watch of his own at some time or other?  \"Oh, father!\" he cried, \"how good and kind of you!  What a beauty!\"  The father smiled to see his son's delight, and helped to fasten the chain to his button-hole.  \"You and mother are bricks!\" exclaimed Charlie, feasting his eyes upon me, and half wild with delight.  \"How _did_ you know I was longing to have one?\"  \"Were you?\" inquired the father.  \"Of course I was, and you knew it.  What a swell I shall be!  And it will always be sure to remind me of home.\"  While this talk was going on I had leisure to examine my new owner. Picture to yourselves a curly-haired, bright-eyed boy of thirteen with honest, open face, good features, and winning smile.  He is big for his age, and strongly built.  At present his form is arrayed in a brand-new suit of grey; his collar is new and his tie is new, his boots are new and his socks are new; everything is new about him, down to the very guard of his hat, and he himself is the newest and purest of all.  Was ever such a radiant young hero turned loose into the world?  And now, over and above his other glories, he had me to crown all.  The graceful curve of my chain on his waistcoat gave that garment quite a distinguished appearance, and the consciousness of a silver watch in his pocket made him hold his head even higher than usual.  \"He is a beauty!\" again he broke out, \"exactly the kind I like most. I'll take ever such a lot of care of him.\"  And so saying, he began to swing me at the end of the chain, till I suddenly came sharply into collision with the door of the cab.  \"Hullo,\" exclaimed my young master, \"that won't do.  I'll put him away now.  It _was_ good of you, father.\"  With that we reached the railway station, and in the bustle that ensued I was for the time forgotten.  Charlie's trunks were duly labelled for Randlebury, and then came the hardest moment of all, when father and son must part.  \"I wonder if you'll be altered, Charlie, when I see you again.\"  \"Not for the worse I hope, anyhow,\" replied the boy, laughing.  \"Tickets, please!\" demanded the guard.  \"There goes the bell,\" said Charlie, pulling me out of his pocket. \"They're very punctual.  Hullo, we're off!  Good-bye, father.\"  \"Good-bye, boy, and God bless you.\"  And there was a close grasp of the hand, a last smile, a hasty wave from the window; and then we were off.  How many grown-up men are there who cannot recall at some time or other this crisis in their lives, this first good-bye from the home of their childhood, this stepping forth into the world with all that is familiar and dear at their backs, and all that is strange and unknown and wonderful stretching away like a vast landscape before them?  How many are there who would not give much to be back once more at that threshold of their career; and to have the chance of living over again the life they began there with such bright hopes and such careless confidence? Ah, if some of them could have seen whither that flower-strewn path was to lead them, would they not rather have chosen even to die on the threshold, than take so much as the first step forth from the innocent home of childhood!  But I am wandering from my story.  For half an hour after that last good-bye Charlie leaned back in the corner of his carriage and gave himself up to his loneliness, and I could feel his chest heaving to keep down the tears that would every now and then rise unbidden to his eyes.  But what boy of thirteen can be in the dumps for long?  Especially if he has a new watch in his pocket.  Charlie was himself again before we had well got clear of London, and his reviving spirits gradually recalled to his memory his father's parting gift, which had for a while been half forgotten amid other cares.  Now again I was produced, I was turned over and over, was listened to, was peeped into, was flourished about, was taken off my chain, and put on again with the supremest satisfaction.  At every station we came to, out I"]]]
