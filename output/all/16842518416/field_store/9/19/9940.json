As soon as he saw them he ran up exclaiming--  \"Oh, Master Gilpins, there's a chap been and run off wi' all my traps, and I've not a rag left, but just what I stand in!\"  Sam was, of course, glad enough to assist in carrying their luggage. James apologised to the stranger, saying he would not trouble him.  \"Not so fast, young chum!\" exclaimed the man.  \"You promised me a couple of nobblers, and engaged me to call a porter.  I'm not going to let you off so easily!  Down with the tin, or come and stand the treat!\"  The Gilpins were rather more inclined to laugh at the man than to be angry; certainly they had no intention of paying him.  Perhaps their looks expressed this.  He was becoming more and more blustering, when a cry from several people was heard; and looking up the street, an open carriage with a pair of horses was seen dashing down towards the water at a furious rate.  There was no coachman on the box, but that there was some one in the carriage James discovered by seeing a shawl fluttering from the side, and by hearing a piercing shriek, uttered apparently as if then, for the first time, the lady had discovered the imminence of her danger.  In a few seconds the carriage would have been dragged over the quay and into water many fathoms deep.  \"Stop the horses!  Fifty--a hundred--five hundred pounds to whoever will do it!\" shouted a man's voice from within.  Right and left the people were flying out of the way of the infuriated steeds.  There was not manhood enough left apparently in the idle, dissipated-looking loiterers who were standing near.  Two or three took their hands out of their pockets and ran forward, but quickly returned as the horses came galloping by them.  The young Gilpins heard the gentleman's offer.  \"We don't want that!\" cried James.  \"Come on, Arthur!\"  They sprang towards the carriage, one on each side; and then turning, ran in the direction it was going, grasping the head-stalls of the animals as they passed, but allowing themselves to be carried on some way, their weight however telling instantly on the galloping steeds.  Sam Green had remained standing by the luggage, having made up his mind that the suspicious-looking stranger would decamp with it, if left unguarded.  When, however, he saw that the horses, in spite of his young friends' efforts, would drag the carriage over, unless stopped, he started up, with his hands outstretched before him, uttering with stentorian voice a true English \"Woh! woho!\" and then, with an arm from which an ox would dislike to receive a blow, he seized the heads of the horses, already trying to stop themselves, and forced them back from the edge stones of the quay, which they had almost reached.  Undoubtedly the horses had been broken in by a trainer from the old country: Sam Green's \"Woh! woho!\" acted like magic; and the pacified though trembling animals allowed themselves to be turned round, with their heads away from the water.  While the elder Gilpin and Sam held them, Arthur ran to open the door, that the lady and gentleman might alight.  The one was of middle age, the other very young--father and daughter, Arthur surmised.  \"My brave lads, you have nobly won the reward I promised,\" said the gentleman, as he lifted out his daughter, who, pale and agitated, still, by the expression of her countenance, showed the gratitude she felt.  \"I am sure that my brother and I require no reward for doing our duty,\" answered Arthur, blushing as he spoke.  \"Besides, without the aid of that other lad, our fellow-passenger, we should probably have failed.\"  \"What!  I took you for labouring youths, I beg your pardon,\" said the gentleman, giving a glance of surprise at him.  \"Our intention is to labour,\" said Arthur, unaffectedly.  \"Ah! you have the stuff in you to command success,\" said the gentleman. \"But I must request you to accompany me for a short distance, as my daughter prefers walking; and if I once lose sight of you in this straggling city, I may not easily find you again.\"  \"Thank you, sir,\" said Arthur; \"we have our luggage with us, and must go to an inn; but if you will favour me with your address, we will call on you before we leave Sydney.\"  While they were speaking, the coachman, in consequence of whose carelessness in letting go their heads the horses had run away, came up, and released James and Sam.  Not a word of scolding was uttered--the gentleman thought a moment.  \"Here, Sykes, lift that luggage into the carriage, and drive these young gentleman home; leave them there, and come back for Miss Fanny and me to the club.\"  In vain the young Gilpins expostulated.  \"I am a determined person, and will have it so,\" said the gentleman.  Before they looked round, Sam had stowed away their luggage in the carriage, greatly to the disappointment of the bully, who had, it seemed, been watching for an opportunity to make off with a portion. The stranger then, almost against their will, forced them into it; and writing a few lines on the leaf of a pocket-book, gave it to the coachman.  \"Come, my friend, you must go in also,\" he added, taking Sam by the arm.  Sam drew back, and, touching his hat, exclaimed, \"Noa, sir--noa, thank ye.  It 'ud ne'er do for me to ride wi' the young squires; I know my place better nor that.\"  A mob such as Sydney, of all British ports, perhaps, can alone produce, had by this time collected round the carriage.  Sam's remark produced a loud guffaw laugh from among them, and a variety of observations came rattling down on him, such as \"Go it, young Touch-my-hat; the nob will pay you--he's a nigger with a white face.  I wonder where he was raised? His mother was a dancing mistress--little doubt of that.\"  Sam's temper had been irritated from the loss of his property, which he very naturally concluded had been stolen by some of his tormentors.  He now looked as if he were going to give way to his temper.  Instead of so doing, however, he turned calmly round with his double fist, and said slowly, \"I'll tell you what, young chaps, a man who respects himself keeps his own place, and when he meets a gentleman he'd think himself without manners nor character if he didn't touch his hat to him.  Did any on ye ever see two gentlemen take off their hats to each other? Well, then, I have; and I should just like to know which was the worst man of the two?  I'll say another thing--I have mostly found that when I have took my hat off to a gentleman he took his off to me; and I wonder if his friends laughed at him.  But I suppose some of you are great nobs yourselves, and know all about what nobs do.\"  Having thus delivered himself, Sam, giving a contemptuous glance at his opponents, slowly mounted the box by the side of the coachman.  The gentleman, who had walked on with his daughter, bowed to the Gilpins as they passed.  \"I am afraid that, from taking us to be ploughboys, he now believes we are young noblemen in disguise,\" observed Arthur.  \"This is a very different style to that in which we could have expected to have entered Sydney half an hour ago.\"  \"Perhaps he thinks more of the service we have rendered him than we should,\" answered his brother; \"however, it's a curious adventure, certainly.\"  \"Well, muster, there be rum jokes in this town o' yours,\" observed Sam to the coachman, after keeping silence for some time.  \"There be, young man,\" was the laconic answer; \"and rum things done.\"  In this Sam agreed, informing Mr Sykes--for this, he ascertained, was the coachman's name--how he had lost his property.  \"Be thou the young man who stopped the 'osses?\" inquired Sykes.  \"The young squires did it, and I helped 'em,\" said Sam.  \"And saved my bacon,\" observed Sykes.  \"I say, Muster Sykes, what's the gen'l'man's name?\" asked Sam, discovering, perhaps, by the tone of the coachman's voice, rather than by any perceptible change in his mask-like features, that he was not ill disposed towards him, and preparing therefore to be confidential.  Sykes informed him that his master's name was Prentiss, that he was a large squatter, that there were other brothers all well off, and an old father; and that, take him all in all as masters went, he was not a bad one.  Sam, in return, told him all about himself, and all he knew about the Gilpins, by which time the carriage had reached the door of Mr Prentiss's residence, in one of the best parts of Sydney.  It was a handsome house; and a respectable-looking servant-woman, after a few words from the coachman, showed the Gilpins into a well-furnished dining-room, their luggage being placed in the hall.  \"You'll go with me, young man,\" observed Mr Sykes to Sam; \"you'll be more comfortable than with the gentry.\"  To this Sam agreed; and drove round to the back of the house, where he was introduced to Mrs Sykes, who lived over the coach-house, and numerous Masters and Misses Sykes, thin, sallow, and remarkably precocious young people, the eldest not being more than ten.  Among this hopeful family Sam in a few minutes made himself a great favourite.  The young immigrants waited the arrival of their host with no little curiosity, for they knew less of him than Sam had contrived to learn. In a short time, however, the servant, placing a tray with meat, bread, fruit, and light wine, begged them to refresh themselves.  This occupied their time till the arrival of Mr Prentiss.  Perhaps James was disappointed at not seeing the young lady when her father entered the room.  Mr Prentiss put out his hand, cordially welcoming them to Australia and to his house; and, begging them to make it their home during their stay, he quickly drew out from them a statement of their plans and wishes.  \"You can make a fair start,\" he observed.  \"You have the five hundred pounds I promised, very nobly won, too; and I may give you a few hints besides as to the purchase of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21464"],["title","The Gilpins and their Fortunes: A Story of Early Days in Australia (#2)"],["body","ck.  You will, of course, become squatters--by far the best business for young men of enterprise and activity.  What do you say to it?\"  \"We should like nothing better, sir,\" answered James.  \"But--I speak again for my brother as well as for myself--we cannot accept payment for performing a mere act of duty; your advice and assistance may be of the greatest value to us, and of that we will gladly avail ourselves.  The young man who helped us to stop the horses must, of course, speak for himself.\"  \"Well, well, I admire your independence and high feeling,\" answered Mr Prentiss.  \"I doubt, however, that you will find many in this country to consider that you are right; but perhaps I may be of service to you in the way you desire.  You, of course, will make my house your home while you remain in Sydney; when you wish to commence your life in the bush, I will send you up the country to my father and some brothers of mine, who will put you in the way of a fair start.  Your young shipmate fairly earned a portion of the reward; he also deserves my gratitude.  He looks as if there was work in him, and to such a person I can be permanently of use.  Unhappily, numbers of men come out here--they may be counted by hundreds or thousands--who will not work, or who cannot work; nothing suits them.  They come with pockets full of letters, expecting first-rate situations with nothing to do.  How can such people be assisted to any advantage?  Give them money, and they squander it; place them in situations of trust, and they are dismissed as incompetent, or they throw them up as uncongenial to their tastes.  All we want in this magnificent country are people who will try to work, and if they do not succeed in one thing, will turn their hands to something else.  There is ample room, I say, for persons of every possible description, provided always that they belong to the `try' school.\"  Mr Prentiss insisted on taking his guests round the town to visit its lions; and greatly surprised they were to see the wonderful progress it had already made.  \"Wool has done it all!  Well may the golden fleece be our emblem!\" he observed.  At the late dinner hour they were introduced to Mrs Prentiss and two daughters--the young lady they had before seen and a younger sister. All awkwardness soon wore off, and they felt themselves perfectly at home.  Mr Prentiss had a conversation with Sam, the result of which made him supremely happy; his satisfaction was not decreased either when, two days afterwards, Sykes brought him his bag of clothes.  \"Don't ask questions, young man,\" he observed, as he handed them; \"there are few of the old hands I don't know, and I guessed who had your property.\"  Pleasant as the two young Gilpins found their stay in Sydney, they did not disguise their anxiety to be off into the country; and their new friend accordingly made arrangements for their journey.    CHAPTER TWO.  A dray, similar in construction to that used by brewers in England, but drawn by oxen, and laden with all sorts of stores, such as are required on an Australian farm--tea, carpenters' tools and agricultural implements, groceries and casks of liquor, clothing and furniture--was making its way towards the north-east from Sydney.  There was the bullock-driver in charge, with his chum, a newly hired hand, and Sam Green, who walked or sat on the dray; while the two Gilpins rode alongside on horses, provided by Mr Prentiss.  They were dressed more in the Australian style than when they landed, and in a way much better suited to the climate.  The road had been excellent for a hundred miles or more, with numerous villages near it, and a large proportion of houses of entertainment, so that they had no want of accommodation when they halted.  They had now for some time left the high-road, and though there were inns, and occasionally villages, and farms, and stock stations, they had sometimes to depend on their own resources, and to bivouac in the bush.  This the young immigrants found by far the pleasantest part of their journey.  The oxen were turned loose to graze at leisure; sticks were collected, and a fire lighted for boiling the tea-kettle and cooking the damper.  The old hands troubled themselves very little about their night's lodging; they, like Sam Green, were satisfied with the bare ground under the dray if it threatened rain, or anywhere near it if the weather was fine.  A small tent had been provided by Mr Prentiss, which, with some ticking filled with dry grass, gave the Gilpins a luxurious lodging for the night.  They could scarcely go to sleep on turning in for their first real night in the bush, from the novelty of the scene and the prospects opening up to them.  Before dawn they both started up, awoke by the strangest and most discordant sounds.  \"What can it be?\" cried James.  \"An attack of the blacks,\" said Arthur, rubbing his eyes.  \"But no! Listen!  They are birds, I verily believe; but the strangest birds I ever heard.\"  He was right: there was the hideous, unearthly cry of the laughing-jackass, called often the bushman's clock; the screaming cry of thousands of parrots flying here and there through the forest; there was the cackle of the wattle-bird, the clear notes of the magpie, and the confused chattering of thousands of leather-heads; while many other birds added their notes to the discordant chorus, and speedily banished sleep from the eyes of their hearers.  The stockmen started to their feet, and hurried off to bring in the oxen and horses; a fire was lighted, tea boiled, breakfast discussed with considerable rapidity; and, before the sun was up, the party had recommenced their journey along the dusty dray-track--for as yet it deserved that name rather than a road.  The scenery was varied, and often very beautiful when viewed under a clear blue sky and bright sun.  The beds of streams were frequently passed, but they were either dry altogether, or occasional holes only with water in them could be seen here and there along the course, or, if nowhere dry, they were easily forded.  The Irish bullock-driver, Larry Killock, told Sam that, in the rainy season, these were often foaming torrents, rushing on with terrific noise, and sweeping away everything they meet.  \"Many a poor fellow has been drowned in trying to cross on horseback where, perhaps, he went over with dry feet a few days before,\" said Larry.  \"That's after the snow melts,\" observed Sam.  \"Snow! man alive!  It's a small matter of snow comes down from the sky in this beautiful country, except, now and then, on the top of the Blue Mountains out there; though, as for frosts, it's cold enough on the high ground in July and August, when the south wind blows, to make a fellow blow his fingers to keep them warm, and to think a blazing fire and a blanket pleasant companions.\"  Sam thought that Larry was quizzing him, but still he did not like to accuse him directly.  \"It's a strange country this, then, muster, I'm thinking,\" he remarked cautiously.  \"Strange!  It is a strange country, faith!\" answered Larry.  \"It is summer here when, by all dacent rules, it should be winter; the south wind is cold, and the north blazing hot.  There are creatures with four legs which have ducks' heads; and birds, with long legs and no wings, as tall as horses; while some of the animals stow their young away in a bag in front of them, instead of letting them follow properly at their heels, as pigs and ducks and hens do in the old country.  The trees shed their bark instead of their leaves; and it's only just surprising to me that the people walk on their feet instead of their heads, and that the sun thinks fit to rise in the east instead of the west; and it's often when I wake in the mornin' that I look out expecting to see that he's grown tired of his old ways, and changed to suit the other things in the land.\"  Sam, who could appreciate an English style of joke, was unable to make out whether or not the Irishman was in earnest; but he thought it wise to wait till he could learn the truth from his young friends, when they camped in the evening.  \"It's only just come out, ye are?\" asked Larry.  Sam told him all about himself, as he had told Sykes, expecting an equal amount of communicativeness in return.  \"You've been some time in the country, master, I'm thinking?  How did you come out?\"  Larry looked at him with a twinkle in his eye.  \"Faith, that's just a sacret between myself and them who knows all about it,\" he answered, with a laugh.  \"It's my belief that the big-wigs across the fish-pond had just an idea of the mighty great value I'd be to the country, and sent me out free of all charge to myself and family intirely.\"  The scenery improved as the travellers advanced, and contrasted favourably with the dusty, stony, and worn-out region through which they had passed nearer the capital.  \"Horrible farming!\" observed James; \"if such were practised in England universally, the whole country would become a desert in a few years.\"  Sometimes they passed through scenery like that of a park in England, with open green pastures sprinkled with clumps of trees; some deserving the names of woods, others consisting but of a few trees.  The greater number were _Eucalypti_ the evergreen gum, and stringy-bark trees; but on the banks of streams and on the hillsides, and sometimes in rich, alluvial valleys, such as are found in the northern hemisphere and in less sunny climes, were to be seen flowers, of great size and beauty, such as flourish only in greenhouses in England; while a great variety of the orchis tribe, and geraniums, both large and small, were found in great profusion.  The trees, the names of many of which were given by Larry, bore little or no resemblance to those of the same name at home. Among the most common were the box, wattle, and cherry; but undoubtedly the most prominent everywhere in the landscape were the old gum trees, and the huge iron stringy-bark trees, which, now with shattered"]]]
