Now you shall see what I have gotten for two hundred dirty florins. _Potztausend!_ never did _you_ do such a stroke of work.\"  Then the other voice grumbled and swore, and the steps of the two men approached more closely, and the heart of the child went pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat, as a mouse's does when it is on the top of a cheese and hears a housemaid's broom sweeping near. They began to strip the stove of its wrappings: that he could tell by the noise they made with the hay and the straw. Soon they had stripped it wholly: that, too, he knew by the oaths and exclamations of wonder and surprise and rapture which broke from the man who had not seen it before.  \"A right royal thing! A wonderful and never-to-be-rivalled thing! Grander than the great stove of Hohen-Salzburg! Sublime! magnificent! matchless!\"  So the epithets ran on in thick guttural voices, diffusing a smell of lager-beer so strong as they spoke that it reached August crouching in his stronghold. If they should open the door of the stove! That was his frantic fear. If they should open it, it would be all over with him. They would drag him out; most likely they would kill him, he thought, as his mother's young brother had been killed in the Wald.  The perspiration rolled off his forehead in his agony; but he had control enough over himself to keep quiet, and after standing by the Nürnberg master's work for nigh an hour, praising, marvelling, expatiating in the lengthy German tongue, the men moved to a little distance and began talking of sums of money and divided profits, of which discourse he could make out no meaning. All he could make out was that the name of the king--the king--the king came over very often in their arguments. He fancied at times they quarrelled, for they swore lustily and their voices rose hoarse and high; but after a while they seemed to pacify each other and agree to something, and were in great glee, and so in these merry spirits came and slapped the luminous sides of stately Hirschvogel, and shouted to it,--  \"Old Mumchance, you have brought us rare good luck! To think you were smoking in a silly fool of a salt-baker's kitchen all these years!\"  Then inside the stove August jumped up, with flaming cheeks and clinching hands, and was almost on the point of shouting out to them that they were the thieves and should say no evil of his father, when he remembered, just in time, that to breathe a word or make a sound was to bring ruin on himself and sever him forever from Hirschvogel. So he kept still, and the men barred the shutters of the little lattice and went out by the door, double-locking it after them. He had made out from their talk that they were going to show Hirschvogel to some great person: therefore he kept quite still and dared not move.  Muffled sounds came to him through the shutters from the streets below,--the rolling of wheels, the clanging of church-bells, and bursts of that military music which is so seldom silent in the streets of Munich. An hour perhaps passed by; sounds of steps on the stairs kept him in perpetual apprehension. In the intensity of his anxiety, he forgot that he was hungry and many miles away from cheerful, Old World little Hall, lying by the clear gray river-water, with the ramparts of the mountains all around.  Presently the door opened again sharply. He could hear the two dealers' voices murmuring unctuous words, in which, \"honor,\" \"gratitude,\" and many fine long noble titles played the chief parts. The voice of another person, more clear and refined than theirs, answered them curtly, and then, close by the Nürnberg stove and the boy's ear, ejaculated a single \"_Wunderschön!_\" August almost lost his terror for himself in his thrill of pride at his beloved Hirschvogel being thus admired in the great city. He thought the master-potter must be glad too.  \"_Wunderschön!_\" ejaculated the stranger a second time, and then examined the stove in all its parts, read all its mottoes, gazed long on all its devices.  \"It must have been made for the Emperor Maximilian,\" he said at last; and the poor little boy, meanwhile, within, was \"hugged up into nothing,\" as you children say, dreading that every moment he would open the stove. And open it truly he did, and examined the brass-work of the door; but inside it was so dark that crouching August passed unnoticed, screwed up into a ball like a hedgehog as he was. The gentleman shut to the door at length, without having seen anything strange inside it; and then he talked long and low with the tradesmen, and, as his accent was different from that which August was used to, the child could distinguish little that he said, except the name of the king and the word \"gulden\" again and again. After awhile he went away, one of the dealers accompanying him, one of them lingering behind to bar up the shutters. Then this one also withdrew again, double-locking the door.  The poor little hedgehog uncurled itself and dared to breathe aloud.  What time was it?  Late in the day, he thought, for to accompany the stranger they had lighted a lamp; he had heard the scratch of the match, and through the brass fret-work had seen the lines of light.  He would have to pass the night here, that was certain. He and Hirschvogel were locked in, but at least they were together. If only he could have had something to eat! He thought with a pang of how at this hour at home they ate the sweet soup, sometimes with apples in it from Aunt Maïla's farm orchard, and sang together, and listened to Dorothea's reading of little tales, and basked in the glow and delight that had beamed on them from the great Nürnberg fire-king.  \"Oh, poor, poor little 'Gilda! What is she doing without the dear Hirschvogel?\" he thought. Poor little 'Gilda! she had only now the black iron stove of the ugly little kitchen. Oh, how cruel of father!  August could not bear to hear the dealers blame or laugh at his father, but he did feel that it had been so, so cruel to sell Hirschvogel. The mere memory of all those long winter evenings, when they had all closed round it, and roasted chestnuts or crab-apples in it, and listened to the howling of the wind and the deep sound of the church-bells, and tried very much to make each other believe that the wolves still came down from the mountains into the streets of Hall, and were that very minute growling at the house-door,--all this memory coming on him with the sound of the city bells, and the knowledge that night drew near upon him so completely, being added to his hunger and his fear, so overcame him that he burst out crying for the fiftieth time since he had been inside the stove, and felt that he would starve to death, and wondered dreamily if Hirschvogel would care. Yes, he was sure Hirschvogel would care. Had he not decked it all summer long with Alpine roses and edelweiss and heaths and made it sweet with thyme and honeysuckle and great garden-lilies? Had he ever forgotten when Santa Claus came to make it its crown of holly and ivy and wreathe it all around?  \"Oh, shelter me; save me; take care of me!\" he prayed to the old fire-king, and forgot, poor little man, that he had come on this wild-goose chase northward to save and take care of Hirschvogel!  After a time he dropped asleep, as children can do when they weep, and little robust hill-born boys most surely do, be they where they may. It was not very cold in this lumber-room; it was tightly shut up, and very full of things, and at the back of it were the hot pipes of an adjacent house, where a great deal of fuel was burnt. Moreover, August's clothes were warm ones, and his blood was young. So he was not cold, though Munich is terribly cold in the nights of December; and he slept on and on,--which was a comfort to him, for he forgot his woes, and his perils, and his hunger, for a time.                                   IX   Midnight was once more chiming from all the brazen tongues of the city when he awoke, and, all being still around him, ventured to put his head out of the brass door of the stove to see why such a strange bright light was round him.  It was a very strange and brilliant light indeed; and yet, what is perhaps still stranger, it did not frighten or amaze him, nor did what he saw alarm him either, and yet I think it would have done you or me. For what he saw was nothing less than all the _bric-à-brac_ in motion.  A big jug, an Apostel-Krug, of Kruessen, was solemnly dancing a minuet with a plump Faenza jar; a tall Dutch clock was going through a gavotte with a spindle-legged ancient chair; a very droll porcelain figure of Littenhausen was bowing to a very stiff soldier in _terre cuite_ of Ulm; an old violin of Cremona was playing itself, and a queer little shrill plaintive music that thought itself merry came from a painted spinet covered with faded roses; some gilt Spanish leather had got up on the wall and laughed; a Dresden mirror was tripping about, crowned with flowers, and a Japanese bonze was riding along on a griffin; a slim Venetian rapier had come to blows with a stout Ferrara sabre, all about a little pale-faced chit of a damsel in white Nymphenburg china; and a portly Franconian pitcher in _grès gris_ was calling aloud, \"Oh, these Italians! always at feud!\" But nobody listened to him at all. A great number of little Dresden cups and saucers were all skipping and waltzing; the teapots, with their broad round faces, were spinning their own lids like teetotums; the high-backed gilded chairs were having a game of cards together; and a little Saxe poodle, with a blue ribbon at its throat, was running from one to another, whilst a yellow cat of Cornelis Lachtleven's rode about on a Delft horse in blue pottery of 1489. Meanwhile the brilliant light shed on the scene came from three silver candelabra, though they had no candles set up in them; and, what is the greatest miracle of all, August looked on at these mad"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20997"],["title","The Nürnberg Stove (#7)"],["body","and felt no sensation of wonder! He only, as he heard the violin and the spinet playing, felt an irresistible desire to dance too.  No doubt his face said what he wished; for a lovely little lady, all in pink and gold and white, with powdered hair, and high-heeled shoes, and all made of the very finest and fairest Meissen china, tripped up to him, and smiled, and gave him her hand, and led him out to a minuet. And he danced it perfectly,--poor little August in his thick, clumsy shoes, and his thick, clumsy sheepskin jacket, and his rough homespun linen, and his broad Tyrolean hat! He must have danced it perfectly, this dance of kings and queens in days when crowns were duly honored, for the lovely lady always smiled benignly and never scolded him at all, and danced so divinely herself to the stately measures the spinet was playing that August could not take his eyes off her till, their minuet ended, she sat down on her own white-and-gold bracket.  \"I am the Princess of Saxe-Royale,\" she said to him, with a benignant smile; \"and you have got through that minuet very fairly.\"  Then he ventured to say to her,--  \"Madame my princess, could you tell me kindly why some of the figures and furniture dance and speak, and some lie up in a corner like lumber? It does make me curious. Is it rude to ask?\"  For it greatly puzzled him why, when some of the _bric-à-brac_ was all full of life and motion, some was quite still and had not a single thrill in it.  \"My dear child,\" said the powdered lady, \"is it possible that you do not know the reason? Why, those silent, dull things are _imitation_!\"  This she said with so much decision that she evidently considered it a condensed but complete answer.  \"Imitation?\" repeated August, timidly, not understanding.  \"Of course! Lies, falsehoods, fabrications!\" said the princess in pink shoes, very vivaciously. \"They only _pretend_ to be what we _are_! They never wake up: how can they? No imitation ever had any soul in it yet.\"  \"Oh!\" said August, humbly, not even sure that he understood entirely yet. He looked at Hirschvogel: surely it had a royal soul within it: would it not wake up and speak? Oh dear! how he longed to hear the voice of his fire-king! And he began to forget that he stood by a lady who sat upon a pedestal of gold-and-white china, with the year 1746 cut on it, and the Meissen mark.  \"What will you be when you are a man?\" said the little lady, sharply, for her black eyes were quick though her red lips were smiling. \"Will you work for the _Königliche Porcellan-Manufactur_, like my great dead Kandler?\"  \"I have never thought,\" said August, stammering; \"at least--that is--I do wish--I do hope to be a painter, as was Master Augustin Hirschvogel at Nürnberg.\"  \"Bravo!\" said all the real _bric-à-brac_ in one breath, and the two Italian rapiers left off fighting to cry, \"_Benone!_\" For there is not a bit of true _bric-à-brac_ in all Europe that does not know the names of the mighty masters.  August felt quite pleased to have won so much applause, and grew as red as the lady's shoes with bashful contentment.  \"I knew all the Hirschvögel, from old Veit downwards,\" said a fat _grès de Flandre_ beer-jug: \"I myself was made at Nürnberg.\" And he bowed to the great stove very politely, taking off his own silver hat--I mean lid--with a courtly sweep that he could scarcely have learned from burgomasters. The stove, however, was silent, and a sickening suspicion (for what is such heart-break as a suspicion of what we love?) came through the mind of August: _Was Hirschvogel only imitation_?  \"No, no, no, no!\" he said to himself, stoutly: though Hirschvogel never stirred, never spoke, yet would he keep all faith in it! After all their happy years together, after all the nights of warmth and joy he owed it, should he doubt his own friend and hero, whose gilt lion's feet he had kissed in his babyhood? \"No, no, no, no!\" he said, again, with so much emphasis that the Lady of Meissen looked sharply again at him.  \"No,\" she said, with pretty disdain; \"no, believe me, they may 'pretend' forever. They can never look like us! They imitate even our marks, but never can they look like the real thing, never can they _chassent de race_.\"  \"How should they?\" said a bronze statuette of Vischer's. \"They daub themselves green with verdigris, or sit out in the rain to get rusted; but green and rust are not _patina_; only the ages can give that!\"  \"And _my_ imitations are all in primary colors, staring colors, hot as the colors of a hostelry's sign-board!\" said the Lady of Meissen, with a shiver.  \"Well, there is a _grès de Flandre_ over there, who pretends to be a Hans Kraut, as I am,\" said the jug with the silver hat, pointing with his handle to a jug that lay prone on its side in a corner. \"He has copied me as exactly as it is given to moderns to copy us. Almost he might be mistaken for me. But yet what a difference there is! How crude are his blues! how evidently done over the glaze are his black letters! He has tried to give himself my very twist; but what a lamentable exaggeration of that playful deviation in my lines which in his becomes actual deformity!\"  \"And look at that,\" said the gilt Cordovan leather, with a contemptuous glance at a broad piece of gilded leather spread out on a table. \"They will sell him cheek by jowl with me, and give him my name; but look! _I_ am overlaid with pure gold beaten thin as a film and laid on me in absolute honesty by worthy Diego de las Gorgias, worker in leather of lovely Cordova in the blessed reign of Ferdinand the Most Christian. _His_ gilding is one part gold to eleven other parts of brass and rubbish, and it has been laid on him with a brush--_a brush!_--pah! of course he will be as black as a crock in a few years' time, whilst I am as bright as when I first was made, and, unless I am burnt as my Cordova burnt its heretics, I shall shine on forever.\"  \"They carve pear-wood because it is so soft, and dye it brown, and call it _me_!\" said an old oak cabinet, with a chuckle.  \"That is not so painful; it does not vulgarize you so much as the cups they paint to-day and christen after _me_!\" said a Carl Theodor cup subdued in hue, yet gorgeous as a jewel.  \"Nothing can be so annoying as to see common gimcracks aping _me_!\" interposed the princess in the pink shoes.  \"They even steal my motto, though it is Scripture,\" said a _Trauerkrug_ of Regensburg in black-and-white.  \"And my own dots they put on plain English china creatures!\" sighed the little white maid of Nymphenburg.  \"And they sell hundreds and thousands of common china plates, calling them after me, and baking my saints and my legends in a muffle of to-day; it is blasphemy!\" said a stout plate of Gubbio, which in its year of birth had seen the face of Maestro Giorgio.  \"That is what is so terrible in these _bric-à-brac_ places,\" said the princess of Meissen. \"It brings one in contact with such low, imitative creatures; one really is safe nowhere nowadays unless under glass at the Louvre or South Kensington.\"  \"And they get even there,\" sighed the _grès de Flandre_. \"A terrible thing happened to a dear friend of mine, a _terre cuite_ of Blasius (you know the _terres cuites_ of Blasius date from 1560). Well, he was put under glass in a museum that shall be nameless, and he found himself set next to his own imitation born and baked yesterday at Frankfort, and what think you the miserable creature said to him, with a grin? 'Old Pipe-clay,'--that is what he called my friend,--'the fellow that bought _me_ got just as much commission on me as the fellow that bought _you_, and that was all that _he_ thought about. You know it is only the public money that goes!' And the horrid creature grinned again till he actually cracked himself. There is a Providence above all things, even museums.\"  \"Providence might have interfered before, and saved the public money,\" said the little Meissen lady with the pink shoes.  \"After all, does it matter?\" said a Dutch jar of Haarlem. \"All the shamming in the world will not _make_ them us!\"  \"One does not like to be vulgarized,\" said the Lady of Meissen, angrily.  \"My maker, the Krabbetje,[A] did not trouble his head about that,\" said the Haarlem jar, proudly. \"The Krabbetje made me for the kitchen, the bright, clean, snow-white Dutch kitchen, wellnigh three centuries ago, and now I am thought worthy the palace; yet I wish I were at home; yes, I wish I could see the good Dutch vrouw, and the shining canals, and the great green meadows dotted with the kine.\"  [Footnote A: Jan Asselyn, called Krabbetje, the Little Crab, born 1610, master-potter of Delft and Haarlem.]  \"Ah! if we could all go back to our makers!\" sighed the Gubbio plate, thinking of Giorgio Andreoli and the glad and gracious days of the Renaissance: and somehow the words touched the frolicsome souls of the dancing jars, the spinning teapots, the chairs that were playing cards; and the violin stopped its merry music with a sob, and the spinet sighed,--thinking of dead hands.  Even the little Saxe poodle howled for a master forever lost; and only the swords went on quarrelling, and made such a clattering noise that the Japanese bonze rode at them on his monster and knocked them both right over, and they lay straight and still, looking foolish, and the little Nymphenburg maid, though she was crying, smiled and almost laughed.  Then from where the great stove stood there came a solemn voice.  All eyes turned upon Hirschvogel, and the heart of its little human comrade gave a great jump of joy.  \"My friends,\" said that clear voice from the turret of Nürnberg faïence, \"I have listened to all you have said. There is too much talking among the Mortalities whom one of themselves has called the Windbags. Let not us be like them. I hear among men so much vain speech, so much precious breath and precious time wasted in empty boasts, foolish anger, useless reiteration, blatant argument, ignoble mouthings, that I have learned to "]]]
