When Parliament met in November, 1775, the opposition, led as usual by Burke, made one more effort to avoid civil war; but the Ministerial party rejected all proposals for conciliation, and devoted itself to preparing to crush the rebellion.  On December 22, an Act became law which, if enforced, would have been a sentence of death to all colonial economic life.  It superseded the Boston Port Act and the restraining Acts, absolutely prohibited all commerce with the revolted colonies, and authorized the impressment into the navy of all seamen found on vessels captured under the Act.  Military and naval preparations were slow and costly.  The Admiralty and War Office, unprepared for a general war, had insufficient troops and sailors, and had to collect or create supplies and equipment.  The Earl of Sandwich showed activity but slight capacity as First Lord of the Admiralty.  Viscount {69} Barrington had been Secretary at War under Pitt during the French war, but he lacked force and influence. Hence, although Parliament voted 50,000 troops, there was confusion and delay.  To secure a prompt supply of men, the Ministry took the step of hiring German mercenaries from the lesser Rhine princes--Hesse, Waldeck, and others,--at a rate per head with a fixed sum for deaths. This practice was customary in wars when England was obliged to protect Hanover from the French; but to use the same method against their own kindred in America was looked upon with aversion by many English, and aroused ungovernable indignation in all Americans.  It seemed to show a callousness toward all ties of blood and speech which rendered any hope of reconciliation futile.  The war was not, in fact, popular in England.  The task of conquering rebels was not relished by many, and officers and noblemen of Whig connections in some cases resigned their commissions rather than serve.  The parliamentary opposition denounced the war with fiery zeal as an iniquity and a scandal.  Nevertheless, the general opinion in England supported the Ministry in its determination to assert the national strength; for the colonial behaviour seemed to the average Englishman as nothing more or less than impudent sedition, to yield to which would be disgrace.  {70}  To the Americans, the British action in 1776 showed that the only alternatives were submission or fighting; and, if the latter must be chosen, then it was the feeling of a growing number that independence was the only outcome.  There now went on a contest between conservatives, including on one side those who opposed all civil war, those who were willing to fight to defend rights but who were unwilling to abandon hopes of forcing England to surrender its claims, and those whose businesses and connections were closely interwoven with the mother country and all the radicals on the other.  Unfortunately for the conservatives they had only fear, or sentiment, for arguments, since the North Ministry gave them nothing to urge upon doubtful men. Still more unfortunately, they were, as a rule, outside the revolutionary organizations of conventions and committees, and were themselves without means of co-operating.  In the excitement and tension of the time, the ruder and rougher classes tended to regard all reluctance to join in the revolution as equivalent to upholding the North policy, and to attack as Tories all who did not heartily support the revolutionary cause.  Violence and intimidation rapidly made themselves felt.  Loyalists were threatened, forced by mobs to sign the Association; their houses {71} were defiled, their movements watched.  Then [Transcriber's note: Their?] arms were taken from them, and if they showed anger or temper they were occasionally whipped or even tarred and feathered.  In this way a determined minority backed by the poorer and rougher classes, overrode all opposition and swelled a rising cry for independence.  The Congress was slow, for it felt the need of unanimity; and such colonies as New York and Pennsylvania were controlled by moderates. But at length, in June, 1776, spurred on by the Virginia delegates and by the tireless urgings of the Massachusetts leaders, the body acted. Already some of the colonies had adopted constitutions whose language indicated their independence.  Now the Continental Congress, after a final debate, adopted a Declaration of Independence, drafted by Jefferson of Virginia and supported by the eloquence of John Adams and the influence of Franklin.  Basing their position on the doctrines of the natural right of men to exercise full self-government and to change their form of government when it became oppressive, the colonies, in this famous document, imitated the English Declaration of Rights of 1689 in drawing up a bill of indictment against George III's government.  In this can be discovered every cause of resentment and every variety of {72} complaint which the thirteen colonies were ready to put forward.  Practically all were political.  There were allusions in plenty to the wrangles between governors and assemblies, denunciations of the parliamentary taxes and the coercing Acts, but no reference to the Acts of Trade.  To the end, the colonists, even in the act of declaring independence, found their grievances in the field of government and not in economic regulation.  What they wanted was the unrestricted power to legislate for themselves and to tax or refrain from taxing themselves.  When these powers were diminished, their whole political ideal was ruined, and they preferred independence to what they considered servitude.  Such ideas were beyond the comprehension of most Englishmen, to whom the whole thing was plain disloyalty, however cloaked in specious words and glittering generalities.  It has been said that the rupture was due to a spirit of independence in America which, in spite of all disclaimers, was determined to be entirely free from the mother country.  Such was the assertion of the Tories and officials of the time, and the same idea is not infrequently repeated at the present day.  But the truth is that the colonists would have been contented to remain indefinitely in union with England, subjects of the British {73} crown, sharers of the British commercial empire, provided they could have been sure of complete local self-government.  The independence they demanded was far less than that now enjoyed by the great colonial unions of Canada, Australia, and South Africa.  It may be assumed, of course, that unless Parliament exercised complete authority over internal as well as external matters--to employ the then customary distinction--there was no real imperial bond.  Such was the position unanimously taken by the North Ministry and the Tories in 1776.  But in view of the subsequent history of the English colonies it seems hardly deniable that some relationship similar to the existing colonial one might have been perpetuated had the Whig policy advocated by Burke been adopted, and the right of Parliament \"to bind the colonies in all cases whatsoever\" been allowed to drop, in practice.  The obstinate localism of the colonies was such that not until a generation after the Revolution did a genuine American national sentiment appear.  The colonies were driven to act together in 1774-1776, but not to fuse, by a danger not to national but to local independence.  This fact indicates how sharply defined was the field which the Americans insisted on having free from parliamentary invasion.  Had it been possible for England {74} to recognize this fact, there would have been no revolution.  It is, of course, obvious that the traditional American view of the Revolution as caused by tyranny and oppression is symbolical, if not fictitious.  The British government, in all its measures, from 1763 to 1774, was moderate, hesitating, and at worst irritating.  Its action threatened to destroy the practical independence of the colonial assemblies; but the danger was political.  Even the five \"intolerable Acts\" inflicted hardship on the town of Boston alone.  It was not until the year 1775, when Parliament imposed severe commercial restrictions, that anything resembling actual oppression began; but by that time the colonies were in open revolt.  This fact only emphasizes, as Burke pointed out, the criminal folly of the North Ministry in allowing the situation to become dangerous.  It was the misfortune of the British people in the eighteenth century that, in the critical years after 1767, George III and his Ministers were unable to conceive of any value in colonies which were not in the full sense dependencies, and were narrowly limited by the economic ideas of their time and the social conventions of their class.  Since the colonies had developed, unchecked, their own political life under British government, it was not their duty humbly to {75} surrender all that had come to be identical with liberty in their eyes.  It was the duty of British statesmen to recognize the situation and deal with it. This they failed to do, and the result was revolution.     {75}  CHAPTER IV  THE CIVIL WAR IN THE EMPIRE, 1776-1778  In the war which now began, the military situation was such that neither side could look forward to an easy victory.  Great Britain outweighed the colonies in population by three or four to one, and in every element of military strength to a much greater degree.  There was a standing army, an ample sufficiency of professional officers, the most powerful navy in the world, the full machinery of financial administration, abundant credit, and wealthy manufacturing and agricultural classes which has already shown their power to carry the burdens of a world contest without flinching.  With a powerful party Ministry endowed with full discretion in the ordering of military affairs, there was little danger of divided {76} councils or of inability to secure responsible direction.

There were no prisons, no slums, no insane asylums, no cripples, no poverty, no wars.  All diseases were conquered. So was old age.  Death, barring accidents, was an adventure for volunteers.  The population of the United States was stabilized at forty-million souls.  One bright morning in the Chicago Lying-in Hospital, a man named Edward K. Wehling, Jr., waited for his wife to give birth. He was the only man waiting. Not many people were born a day any more.  Wehling was fifty-six, a mere stripling in a population whose average age was one hundred and twenty-nine.  X-rays had revealed that his wife was going to have triplets. The children would be his first.  Young Wehling was hunched in his chair, his head in his hand. He was so rumpled, so still and colorless as to be virtually invisible. His camouflage was perfect, since the waiting room had a disorderly and demoralized air, too. Chairs and ashtrays had been moved away from the walls. The floor was paved with spattered dropcloths.  The room was being redecorated. It was being redecorated as a memorial to a man who had volunteered to die.  A sardonic old man, about two hundred years old, sat on a stepladder, painting a mural he did not like. Back in the days when people aged visibly, his age would have been guessed at thirty-five or so. Aging had touched him that much before the cure for aging was found.  The mural he was working on depicted a very neat garden. Men and women in white, doctors and nurses, turned the soil, planted seedlings, sprayed bugs, spread fertilizer.  Men and women in purple uniforms pulled up weeds, cut down plants that were old and sickly, raked leaves, carried refuse to trash-burners.  Never, never, never--not even in medieval Holland nor old Japan--had a garden been more formal, been better tended. Every plant had all the loam, light, water, air and nourishment it could use.  A hospital orderly came down the corridor, singing under his breath a popular song:       If you don't like my kisses, honey,      Here's what I will do:      I'll go see a girl in purple,      Kiss this sad world toodle-oo.      If you don't want my lovin',      Why should I take up all this space?      I'll get off this old planet,      Let some sweet baby have my place.  The orderly looked in at the mural and the muralist. \"Looks so real,\" he said, \"I can practically imagine I'm standing in the middle of it.\"  \"What makes you think you're not in it?\" said the painter. He gave a satiric smile. \"It's called 'The Happy Garden of Life,' you know.\"  \"That's good of Dr. Hitz,\" said the orderly.         *       *       *       *       *  He was referring to one of the male figures in white, whose head was a portrait of Dr. Benjamin Hitz, the hospital's Chief Obstetrician. Hitz was a blindingly handsome man.  \"Lot of faces still to fill in,\" said the orderly. He meant that the faces of many of the figures in the mural were still blank. All blanks were to be filled with portraits of important people on either the hospital staff or from the Chicago Office of the Federal Bureau of Termination.  \"Must be nice to be able to make pictures that look like something,\" said the orderly.  The painter's face curdled with scorn. \"You think I'm proud of this daub?\" he said. \"You think this is my idea of what life really looks like?\"  \"What's your idea of what life looks like?\" said the orderly.  The painter gestured at a foul dropcloth. \"There's a good picture of it,\" he said. \"Frame that, and you'll have a picture a damn sight more honest than this one.\"  \"You're a gloomy old duck, aren't you?\" said the orderly.  \"Is that a crime?\" said the painter.  The orderly shrugged. \"If you don't like it here, Grandpa--\" he said, and he finished the thought with the trick telephone number that people who didn't want to live any more were supposed to call. The zero in the telephone number he pronounced \"naught.\"  The number was: \"2 B R 0 2 B.\"  It was the telephone number of an institution whose fanciful sobriquets included: \"Automat,\" \"Birdland,\" \"Cannery,\" \"Catbox,\" \"De-louser,\" \"Easy-go,\" \"Good-by, Mother,\" \"Happy Hooligan,\" \"Kiss-me-quick,\" \"Lucky Pierre,\" \"Sheepdip,\" \"Waring Blendor,\" \"Weep-no-more\" and \"Why Worry?\"  \"To be or not to be\" was the telephone number of the municipal gas chambers of the Federal Bureau of Termination.         *       *       *       *       *  The painter thumbed his nose at the orderly. \"When I decide it's time to go,\" he said, \"it won't be at the Sheepdip.\"  \"A do-it-yourselfer, eh?\" said the orderly. \"Messy business, Grandpa. Why don't you have a little consideration for the people who have to clean up after you?\"  The painter expressed with an obscenity his lack of concern for the tribulations of his survivors. \"The world could do with a good deal more mess, if you ask me,\" he said.  The orderly laughed and moved on.  Wehling, the waiting father, mumbled something without raising his head. And then he fell silent again.  A coarse, formidable woman strode into the waiting room on spike heels. Her shoes, stockings, trench coat, bag and overseas cap were all purple, the purple the painter called \"the color of grapes on Judgment Day.\"  The medallion on her purple musette bag was the seal of the Service Division of the Federal Bureau of Termination, an eagle perched on a turnstile.  The woman had a lot of facial hair--an unmistakable mustache, in fact. A curious thing about gas-chamber hostesses was that, no matter how lovely and feminine they were when recruited, they all sprouted mustaches within five years or so.  \"Is this where I'm supposed to come?\" she said to the painter.  \"A lot would depend on what your business was,\" he said. \"You aren't about to have a baby, are you?\"  \"They told me I was supposed to pose for some picture,\" she said. \"My name's Leora Duncan.\" She waited.  \"And you dunk people,\" he said.  \"What?\" she said.  \"Skip it,\" he said.  \"That sure is a beautiful picture,\" she said. \"Looks just like heaven or something.\"  \"Or something,\" said the painter. He took a list of names from his smock pocket. \"Duncan, Duncan, Duncan,\" he said, scanning the list. \"Yes--here you are. You're entitled to be immortalized. See any faceless body here you'd like me to stick your head on? We've got a few choice ones left.\"  She studied the mural bleakly. \"Gee,\" she said, \"they're all the same to me. I don't know anything about art.\"  \"A body's a body, eh?\" he said. \"All righty. As a master of fine art, I recommend this body here.\" He indicated a faceless figure of a woman who was carrying dried stalks to a trash-burner.  \"Well,\" said Leora Duncan, \"that's more the disposal people, isn't it? I mean, I'm in service. I don't do any disposing.\"  The painter clapped his hands in mock delight. \"You say you don't know anything about art, and then you prove in the next breath that you know more about it than I do! Of course the sheave-carrier is wrong for a hostess! A snipper, a pruner--that's more your line.\" He pointed to a figure in purple who was sawing a dead branch from an apple tree. \"How about her?\" he said. \"You like her at all?\"  \"Gosh--\" she said, and she blushed and became humble--\"that--that puts me right next to Dr. Hitz.\"  \"That upsets you?\" he said.  \"Good gravy, no!\" she said. \"It's--it's just such an honor.\"  \"Ah, You... you admire him, eh?\" he said.  \"Who doesn't admire him?\" she said, worshiping the portrait of Hitz. It was the portrait of a tanned, white-haired, omnipotent Zeus, two hundred and forty years old. \"Who doesn't admire him?\" she said again. \"He was responsible for setting up the very first gas chamber in Chicago.\"  \"Nothing would please me more,\" said the painter, \"than to put you next to him for all time. Sawing off a limb--that strikes you as appropriate?\"  \"That is kind of like what I do,\" she said. She was demure about what she did. What she did was make people comfortable while she killed them.         *       *       *       *       *  And, while Leora Duncan was posing for her portrait, into the waitingroom bounded Dr. Hitz himself. He was seven feet tall, and he boomed with importance, accomplishments, and the joy of living.  \"Well, Miss Duncan! Miss Duncan!\" he said, and he made a joke. \"What are you doing here?\" he said. \"This isn't where the people leave. This is where they come in!\"  \"We're going to be in the same picture together,\" she said shyly.  \"Good!\" said Dr. Hitz heartily. \"And, say, isn't that some picture?\"  \"I sure am honored to be in it with you,\" she said.  \"Let me tell you,\" he said, \"I'm honored to be in it with you. Without women like you, this wonderful world we've got wouldn't be possible.\"  He saluted her and moved toward the door that led to the delivery rooms. \"Guess what was just born,\" he said.  \"I can't,\" she said.  \"Triplets!\" he said.  \"Triplets!\" she said. She was exclaiming over the legal implications of triplets.  The law said that no newborn child could survive unless the parents of the child could find someone who would volunteer to die. Triplets, if they were all to live, called for three volunteers.  \"Do the parents have three volunteers?\" said Leora Duncan.  \"Last I heard,\" said Dr. Hitz, \"they had one, and were trying to scrape another two up.\"  \"I don't think they made it,\" she said. \"Nobody made three appointments with us. Nothing but singles going through today, unless somebody called in after I left. What's the name?\"  \"Wehling,\" said the waiting father, sitting up, red-eyed and frowzy. \"Edward K. Wehling, Jr., is the name of the happy father-to-be.\"  He raised his"]]]
