Fisheries (#1)"],["body","are just pure vicious.\"  \"You mean the orcas?\" the boy queried. \"Only just the other day Captain Murchison was talking about them. He called them the wolves of the sea, and said they were the most daring hunters among all things that swim.\"  \"Sea-tigers, some calls 'em,\" the other agreed, \"an' they're fiercer than any wolves I've ever heard about, but I never saw any of 'em attackin' a boat. I have seen as many as twenty tearin' savagely at a whale that was lyin' alongside a ship an' was bein' cut up by the crew. The California gray whale--the devil-whale is what he really is--looks a lot worse to me than a killer. He's as ugly-tempered as a spearfish, as vicious as a man-eatin' shark, as tricky as a moray, an' about as relentless as a closin' ice-floe.\"  \"There she blo-o-ows!\" came the cry again from the crow's-nest.  Hank, looking over the side, caught sight of the spout and, with a twist of the shoulder, walked aft to the first boat.  \"I'm going, too,\" Colin reminded him.  The old whaler looked at him thoughtfully and disapprovingly.  \"Orders is orders,\" he said at last, \"an' if the skipper said you could go, why, I reckon that ends it. An' if you're goin' anyway, you're safer in the big boat than in the 'prams.' Tumble in.\"  Colin clambered into the double-ended boat with its high prow and stern and settled himself down excitedly.  \"I never really believed I'd get the chance to see any whale-spearing,\" he said. \"Whaling with a cannon is only a make-believe. Now, this is something like!\"  \"Foolishness I calls it,\" put in one of the younger sailors. \"Why don't the skipper put in somewhere an' get the gun put to rights? An' Hank is just as likely to fix that gun so as he'll blow some of us up with it when he does get it goin'.\"  \"Always croakin', Gloomy,\" said the old gunner. \"Blowin' you up would be no great loss. You'd ought to be glad to see what whalin' was like when your betters was at it.\"  \"I'm glad,\" said Colin, as he pulled steadily at his long oar, \"that we did wrench the gun-frame when that heavy sea came aboard.\"  \"I don't see it,\" said the gunner; \"mebbe you'll think presently that you'd ha' done better to be satisfied with readin' about whalin' in those books of yours.\"  \"Well, it got me the chance to see the fun!\" responded Colin.  \"That wouldn't have been enough to start this business a-goin' if it hadn't been that the _Gull_ was an old whalin'-ship before they put steam into her. The little bits of whalin'-steamers they build now only carry a little pram or two, nothin' like this boat you're in now. The _Gull's_ one of the old-timers.\"  \"She hails from New Bedford, doesn't she?\"  \"She took the Indian Ocean whalin' in the sixties an' came round the Horn every season in the seventies,\" Hank replied; \"an' there's not many of her build left. Easy with that oar, Gloomy,\" he added, speaking to the melancholy sailor, who was splashing a good deal in his stroke, \"an' avast talkin', all.\"  Swiftly, but with oars dipping almost noiselessly, the boat slipped up to where the two whales were floating whose spouts had been seen from the ship. The sea was tinged with pink from the masses of shrimp-food which had attracted the whales, and the great creatures were feeding quietly. The surface was not rough, but there was a long, slow roll which tossed the boat about like a cork. Presently Hank, who was in the stern, held up one hand.  \"Hold your starboard oars,\" he said quietly; \"we'll back up to this largest one.\"  This near approach to the whales was too much for Gloomy's nerves. Instead of merely holding his long sweep steady in the water so that the stroke of the port oars would bring the boat around, he tried to make a long backward drive. As he reached back, the boat mounted sidewise on a swell, leaving Gloomy clawing at the air with his oar; then, the boat as suddenly swooped down with a rush, burying the oar almost to the row-locks; it caught Gloomy under the chin and all but knocked him overboard. The splash and the shout distracted Hank's attention for a second, and when he looked round a swirl of water was all that remained to show where the whales had been.  \"I told you what it would be!\" said Gloomy, picking himself up and speaking in an injured tone, as though he blamed everybody else for his own carelessness.  His protests, however, were silenced by a steady stream of descriptive epithet from Hank. The old gunner, without even raising his voice, withered any possible reply on the part of the clumsy sailor, whose inexpertness had caused their failure to get the whale.  \"They were only humpbacks, however,\" added Hank, after Gloomy had been reduced to silence. Indeed, so shamefaced was the luckless sailor, that when he saw a spout a minute or two later he only pointed with his finger, without saying a word.  Noticing the gesture, Colin turned and saw with amazement a tall jet of vapor that had spouted from a whale close by. He looked at Hank expectantly, hoping to hear him spur the crew to a new venture, but the old whaler looked grave.  \"Finback?\" the boy queried.  \"Gray whale, I reckon,\" answered the gunner.  \"Devil-whale? Oh, Hank!\" the boy cried, his eyes shining with excitement. \"I hope it is!\"  \"That shows how little you know,\" the other replied.  \"Are you going to harpoon him?\"  Hank looked at the boy, smiling slightly at his utter fearlessness.  \"I wish you were aboard the ship,\" he said, \"an' I would. But I reckon it's wiser to keep out of trouble.\"  \"But I don't want to be on the _Gull_,\" Colin protested; \"at least not when there's anything going on out here. And,\" he added craftily, \"I didn't think you were really afraid!\"  \"Wa'al,\" the old whaler said, his jaw setting firmly, \"I don't want anybody to think I'm backin' down, just because I'm in a boat again. But I tell you straight, I don't like it. Gloomy,\" he continued, \"an' the rest of you, stand by your oars. That's a gray whale an' I'm goin' after him.\"  \"How do you know it's a California whale, Hank?\" asked the boy, as they waited for the creature to reappear.  \"By the spout,\" was the prompt reply. \"It's not as high an' thin as a finback's, it's not large enough for the low, bushy spout of a humpback, an' it goes straight up instead of at a forward angle so it can't be a sperm. Must be a gray whale, can't be anythin' else.\"  For a few minutes the men rested on their oars, and Colin grew restless.  \"Why doesn't he come up again?\" he said impatiently. \"First thing we know he'll be out of sight!\"  The old whaler smiled again at the lad's eagerness.  \"While the gray is the fastest swimmer of all the whales,\" he said, \"you needn't be afraid that we'll lose sight of him. Most whales swim very slow, not much faster than a man can walk.\"  \"There he is,\" called another of the sailors, pointing to a spout three or four hundred yards away.  \"All right, boys,\" Hank said, \"he's makin' towards the shore.\"  The long oars bit into the water again and Colin was glad to feel the boat moving, for it rolled fearfully on the long heaving swell. But with six good oars and plenty of muscle behind them, the little craft was not long in reaching the place where the 'slick' on the water showed that the whale had come up to breathe and then dived again. Acting under the gunner's orders the crew rested on their oars a short distance beyond the place where the whale had sounded. Presently, a couple of hundred yards from the boat, on the starboard side, the whale came up to spout, evidently having turned from the direction in which it had been slowly traveling, and the rowers made for the new objective. This time there was another long wait.  \"How long do they stay down, Hank?\" asked the boy.  \"No reg'lar rule about it,\" the whaler answered; \"sometimes for quite a while, but I reckon ten to fifteen minutes is about the usual. Some of 'em can stay down a long while sulkin' when they've got a harpoon or two in 'em, but I reckon three-quarters of an hour would be about the limit.\"  Again the boat sped onward, this time without any order from Hank, for all hands had seen the whale not more than fifty yards away, and Hank grasped the shoulder harpoon-gun. But before the boat could reach the whale and turn stern on so as to give the gunner a good chance for a shot, the whale had 'sounded' or dived.  \"Next time,\" said Hank quietly, and told Scotty, one of the sailors, to clear away the first few coils of the rope in the barrel and make sure that it was free from tangles.  Colin noticed that the three places where the whale had spouted formed a slight arc and that Hank was directing the boat along a projection of this curve, so he was quite ready when a command came to stop rowing. Then, at the whaler's orders, the boat was swung round and the men held their oars ready to back-water.  The place could not have been picked out with greater accuracy if the whaler had known the exact spot where the big cetacean was going to appear. Within thirty feet of the boat the water began to swirl and boil.  \"He's right there!\" said Colin with a thrill of expectation not wholly devoid of fear.  In obedience to a wave of the old whaler's hand, the boat went astern slowly and fifteen seconds later the great back appeared near the surface and the monster 'blew,' his pent-up breath escaping suddenly when he was still a foot below the surface, and driving up a column of mixed water and air, the roar sounding like steam from a pipe of large size.  \"Stand by the line, Scotty!\" shouted Hank, as he raised the clumsy harpoon-gun to his shoulder.  The sailor who had been standing near the barrel nodded, as he drew his sheath-knife from its sheath, holding it between his teeth, ready to cut the line should a tangle occur, but keeping his hands free to attend to the coils of rope. To Colin the seconds were as years while the old whaler held the gun raised and did not fire. It seemed to the boy as if he were never going to pull the trigger, but the old gunner knew the exact moment, and just "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21008"],["title","The Boy With the U. S. Fisheries (#2)"],["body","the whale was about to 'sound' the back heaved up slightly, revealing the absence of a dorsal fin, and thus determining that it was a devil-whale in truth; at that instant Hank fired.  With the sudden pang of the harpoon the whale gave an upward leap for a dive and plunged, throwing the flukes of the tail and almost a third of his body out of water, and sounded to the bottom, taking down line at a tremendous speed. The line ran clear, Scotty watching every coil, and though the heavy rope was soaking wet, it began to smoke with the friction as it ran over the bow.  [Illustration: WHALE HARPOON GUN LOADED AND BEING TURNED SO AS TO POINT AT THE WHALE.  _Photograph by permission of Mr. Roy C. Andrews._]  [Illustration: FINBACK WHALE BEING STRUCK WITH THE HARPOON; THE INSTANT OF DISCHARGE.  A remarkable photograph, scores of plates having been used in the effort to catch the exact moment. Note the wadding in the air, the smoke, the head of the harpoon, and the slick on the water as the whale sounded.  _Photograph by permission of Mr. Roy C. Andrews._]  \"Fifty fathom!\" cried Scotty, as the line flew out.  \"Sixty!\" he called a moment later, and then, immediately after,  \"Seventy--and holding!\"  As the pressure of the brake on the line tightened, the boat began to tear through the water, still requiring the paying out of the rope. For an instant it slackened and the winch reeled in a little line. There was a sudden jerk and then the line fell slack. Working like demons, the men made the winch handles fairly fly as the line came in, and within another minute the whale spouted, blowing strongly and sounding again. He sulked at the bottom for over twenty minutes, coming up suddenly quite near the boat. Scotty had lost no time, and not more than thirty-five fathom of line was out when the monster rose.  \"He's a big un, Hank!\" called Scotty. \"Want the other line?\"  \"Got it!\" was the brief reply, and Colin saw that the harpoon-gun had been reloaded.  \"Sounding again!\" called Scotty as the rope fell slack.  \"No!\" yelled Hank. \"Stand by, all!\"  Then suddenly:  \"Back oars! Back, you lubbers! Hard as you know how!\"  The oars bent like yew-staves.  \"Back starboard! Hard!\"  With the blood rushing to his brain, Colin, who was on the starboard side of the boat, threw his whole energy into the back stroke, and the boat spun round like a top into what seemed to be the seething center of a submarine volcano, for, with a roar that made the timbers of the boat vibrate, the gray whale spouted not six feet from where the boy was sitting. Dimly he saw the harpoon hurtle through the spray and the sharp crack of the explosion sounded in his ear.  Catching his breath chokingly, Colin was only conscious of the fact that he was expected to pull and he leapt into the stroke as the six oars shot the boat ahead.  Not soon enough, though! For, as the boat plunged from the crest of a wave the whale swirled, making a suction like a whirlpool into which the craft lurched drunkenly. Then the great creature, turning with a speed that seemed incredible, brought down the flukes of his tail in the direction of the boat, snapping off the stroke oar like a pipe-stem. Avidsen, the oarsman, a burly Norwegian, though his wrist was sharply and painfully wrenched by the blow, made no complaint, but reached out for one of the spare oars the boat always carried.  Colin was not so calm. Despite his courage, the shock of that tremendous tail striking the water within arm's-length of the boat had shaken his nerve, and the sudden drenching with the icy waters of Behring Sea had taken his breath away. But he was game and stuck to his oar. Looking at Hank, he saw that the old fighter of the seas had dropped the harpoon-gun and was holding poised the long lance.  This was hunting whales with a vengeance!  The monster had not sounded but was only gathering fury, and in a few seconds he came to the surface with a rush, charging straight for the boat.  \"Stand by to pull,\" said Hank quietly.  The two forward oars, watching, dipped lightly and moved the boat a yard or two, then waited, their oars in the water and arms extended for the stroke. Colin would have given millions, if he had possessed them, to pull his oar, to do something to get away from the leviathan charging like an avenging fury for the little boat. But Hank stood motionless. Another second and Colin could almost feel the devil-whale plunging through the frail craft, when Scotty suddenly yelled,  \"Pull!\"  As Scotty yelled, Colin vaguely--for everything seemed reeling about him--saw Hank lunge with the long steel lance. The suction half whirled the boat round, but the whale sounded a little, coming up to the surface forty feet away and spouting hollowly. Even to the boy's untrained ear there was a difference, and when he noticed that blood was mixed with the vapor thrown out from the blowhole, his hope revived. The second rush of the whale was easily avoided, and Hank thrust in the lance again. Then, for the first time, the old whaler permitted himself to smile, a long, slow smile.  \"That's the way it used to be done in the old days!\" he said, with just a shade of triumph in his voice. \"Pull away a little, boys, to be clear of the flurry. Have you a buoy ready, Scotty?\"  The sailor nodded.  \"There won't be much of a flurry, Hank,\" he said; \"you got the lungs with the lance both times.\"  The old whaler looked at Colin, who was a little white about the lips.  \"Scared you, I reckon?\" he said. \"You don't need to feel bad over that. Any one's got a right to be scared when a whale's chargin' the boat. I've been whalin' for nigh on forty-five years an' that's only the second devil-whale I've ever killed with a hand-lance. He pretty near caught us with his flukes that first time, too!\"  \"Guess that's the end of him,\" said Scotty, as the big animal beat the air with his tail, the slap of the huge flukes throwing up a fountain of spray.  \"That's the end,\" agreed Hank.  Almost with the word the great gray whale turned, one fin looming above the water as he did so, and sank heavily to the bottom, the buoy which had been attached to the harpoon-line by Scotty showing where he sank, so that the ship could pick up the carcass later.  \"How big do you suppose that whale was?\" queried the boy as they started to pull back to the ship.  \"'Bout forty-five foot, I reckon,\" was the reply, \"an' we ought to get about twenty barrels of oil out of him.\"  \"That ought to help some,\" said Colin, \"and you see my coming didn't hurt anything. Just think if I had missed all that fun!\"  \"It turned out all right,\" the old whaler said, \"but I tell you it was a narrow squeak. They'll have been worryin' on board, though, if any one has been able to see that we were hitched up to a gray whale.\"  \"Isn't there any danger with other whales?\"  \"Wa'al, you've got to know how to get at 'em, of course. But all you've got to do is to keep out o' the way. There's no whale except the California whale that'll charge a boat. I did know one chap that was killed by a humpback, but that was because the whale come up suddenly right under the boat and upset it--they often do that--an' when one of the chaps was in the water the whale happened to give a slap with his tail an' the poor fellow was right under it.\"  Colin was anxious to start the old whaler on some yarns of the early days, but as the boat was nearing the ship he decided to wait for an opportunity when there would be more time and the raconteur would have full leeway for his stories.  \"Forty-five-footer, sir,\" called Hank, as they came up to the ship. \"Gray devil, sir.\"  The captain lifted his eyebrows in surprise, for he had not thought of a California whale so far north, but he answered in an offhand way:  \"More sport than profit in that. Did you have a run for your money, Colin?\"  \"I certainly did, Captain Murchison,\" the boy answered.  \"All right, tell me about it some time. Hank, you're on board just in the nick of time. I found out what the trouble was with the carriage of the gun and repaired it while you were amusing yourselves out there. Get in lively, now, there's work to do.\"  The men scrambled on board rapidly, and the boat was up in the davits in less than a minute, while the yards were braced round, and under sail and steam the _Gull_ headed north.  \"There's four whales in sight, Hank,\" said the captain; \"humpbacks, I think, and two of them big ones.\"  \"If they'll bunch up like that, sir,\" the gunner said, \"we may make a good trip out of it yet.\"  \"I hope so,\" the skipper answered, and turning on his heel, he went to the poop. Thither Colin followed him and told him all the story of the whale. The captain, who was an old friend of Colin's father when they both lived in a lumbering town in northern Michigan, was greatly taken aback when he found how dangerous the boat-trip had been, but he did not want to spoil the boy's vivid memories of the excitement.  \"I suppose,\" he said, \"that you want to go out as gunner next time.\"  Colin shook his head.  \"I'm generally willing to try anything, Captain Murchison,\" he replied, \"but I'm content to let Hank look after that end.\"  \"Hank's an unusual man,\" the captain said quietly. \"I rather doubt if any other man on the Pacific Coast could have won out with a gray whale. I'd rather have him aboard than a lot of mates I know, and as a gunner, of course, he's a sort of petty officer.\"  The canvas began to shake as the boat turned on its course after the whales, catching the skipper's eye, and he roared out orders to shorten sail.  \"Clew up fore and main to'gans'ls,\" he shouted; \"take in the tops'ls. Colin, you go and furl the fore to'gans'l, and if the men are still busy on the tops'l yards, pass the gaskets round the main to'gans'l as well.\"  \"Aye, aye, sir,\" the boy answered readily, for he enjoyed being aloft, and he clambered up the shrouds to the fore-topgallant yard and furled the sail, taking a pride in having it lie smooth and round on the top of"]]]
