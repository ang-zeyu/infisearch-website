It is       probable, indeed, that our intimate communion had resulted in a       partial interchange of character.        About eighteen months after the period of the Ariel’s disaster,       the firm of Lloyd and Vredenburgh (a house connected in some       manner with the Messieurs Enderby, I believe, of Liverpool) were       engaged in repairing and fitting out the brig Grampus for a       whaling voyage. She was an old hulk, and scarcely seaworthy when       all was done to her that could be done. I hardly know why she was       chosen in preference to other good vessels belonging to the same       owners—but so it was. Mr. Barnard was appointed to command her,       and Augustus was going with him. While the brig was getting       ready, he frequently urged upon me the excellency of the       opportunity now offered for indulging my desire of travel. He       found me by no means an unwilling listener—yet the matter could       not be so easily arranged. My father made no direct opposition;       but my mother went into hysterics at the bare mention of the       design; and, more than all, my grandfather, from whom I expected       much, vowed to cut me off with a shilling if I should ever broach       the subject to him again. These difficulties, however, so far       from abating my desire, only added fuel to the flame. I       determined to go at all hazards; and, having made known my       intentions to Augustus, we set about arranging a plan by which it       might be accomplished. In the meantime I forbore speaking to any       of my relations in regard to the voyage, and, as I busied myself       ostensibly with my usual studies, it was supposed that I had       abandoned the design. I have since frequently examined my conduct       on this occasion with sentiments of displeasure as well as of       surprise. The intense hypocrisy I made use of for the furtherance       of my project—an hypocrisy pervading every word and action of my       life for so long a period of time—could only have been rendered       tolerable to myself by the wild and burning expectation with       which I looked forward to the fulfilment of my long-cherished       visions of travel.        In pursuance of my scheme of deception, I was necessarily obliged       to leave much to the management of Augustus, who was employed for       the greater part of every day on board the Grampus, attending to       some arrangements for his father in the cabin and cabin hold. At       night, however, we were sure to have a conference and talk over       our hopes. After nearly a month passed in this manner, without       our hitting upon any plan we thought likely to succeed, he told       me at last that he had determined upon everything necessary. I       had a relation living in New Bedford, a Mr. Ross, at whose house       I was in the habit of spending occasionally two or three weeks at       a time. The brig was to sail about the middle of June (June,       1827), and it was agreed that, a day or two before her putting to       sea, my father was to receive a note, as usual, from Mr. Ross,       asking me to come over and spend a fortnight with Robert and       Emmet (his sons). Augustus charged himself with the inditing of       this note and getting it delivered. Having set out as supposed,       for New Bedford, I was then to report myself to my companion, who       would contrive a hiding-place for me in the Grampus. This       hiding-place, he assured me, would be rendered sufficiently       comfortable for a residence of many days, during which I was not       to make my appearance. When the brig had proceeded so far on her       course as to make any turning back a matter out of question, I       should then, he said, be formally installed in all the comforts       of the cabin; and as to his father, he would only laugh heartily       at the joke. Vessels enough would be met with by which a letter       might be sent home explaining the adventure to my parents.        The middle of June at length arrived, and every thing had been       matured. The note was written and delivered, and on a Monday       morning I left the house for the New Bedford packet, as supposed.       I went, however, straight to Augustus, who was waiting for me at       the corner of a street. It had been our original plan that I       should keep out of the way until dark, and then slip on board the       brig; but, as there was now a thick fog in our favor, it was       agreed to lose no time in secreting me. Augustus led the way to       the wharf, and I followed at a little distance, enveloped in a       thick seaman’s cloak, which he had brought with him, so that my       person might not be easily recognized. Just as we turned the       second corner, after passing Mr. Edmund’s well, who should       appear, standing right in front of me, and looking me full in the       face, but old Mr. Peterson, my grandfather. “Why, bless my soul,       Gordon,” said he, after a long pause, “why, why,—whose dirty       cloak is that you have on?” “Sir!” I replied, assuming, as well       as I could, in the exigency of the moment, an air of offended       surprise, and talking in the gruffest of all imaginable       tones—“sir! you are a sum’mat mistaken—my name, in the first       place, bee’nt nothing at all like Goddin, and I’d want you for to       know better, you blackguard, than to call my new obercoat a darty       one.” For my life I could hardly refrain from screaming with       laughter at the odd manner in which the old gentleman received       this handsome rebuke. He started back two or three steps, turned       first pale and then excessively red, threw up his spectacles,       then, putting them down, ran full tilt at me, with his umbrella       uplifted. He stopped short, however, in his career, as if struck       with a sudden recollection; and presently, turning round, hobbled       off down the street, shaking all the while with rage, and       muttering between his teeth: “Won’t do—new glasses—thought it was       Gordon—d—d good-for-nothing salt water Long Tom.”        After this narrow escape we proceeded with greater caution, and       arrived at our point of destination in safety. There were only       one or two of the hands on board, and these were busy forward,       doing something to the forecastle combings. Captain Barnard, we       knew very well, was engaged at Lloyd and Vredenburgh’s, and would       remain there until late in the evening, so we had little to       apprehend on his account. Augustus went first up the vessel’s       side, and in a short while I followed him, without being noticed       by the men at work. We proceeded at once into the cabin, and       found no person there. It was fitted up in the most comfortable       style—a thing somewhat unusual in a whaling-vessel. There were       four very excellent staterooms, with wide and convenient berths.       There was also a large stove, I took notice, and a remarkably       thick and valuable carpet covering the floor of both the cabin       and staterooms. The ceiling was full seven feet high, and, in       short, every thing appeared of a more roomy and agreeable nature       than I had anticipated. Augustus, however, would allow me but       little time for observation, insisting upon the necessity of my       concealing myself as soon as possible. He led the way into his       own stateroom, which was on the starboard side of the brig, and       next to the bulkheads. Upon entering, he closed the door and       bolted it. I thought I had never seen a nicer little room than       the one in which I now found myself. It was about ten feet long,       and had only one berth, which, as I said before, was wide and       convenient. In that portion of the closet nearest the bulkheads       there was a space of four feet square, containing a table, a       chair, and a set of hanging shelves full of books, chiefly books       of voyages and travels. There were many other little comforts in       the room, among which I ought not to forget a kind of safe or       refrigerator, in which Augustus pointed out to me a host of       delicacies, both in the eating and drinking department.        He now pressed with his knuckles upon a certain spot of the       carpet in one corner of the space just mentioned, letting me know       that a portion of the flooring, about sixteen inches square, had       been neatly cut out and again adjusted. As he pressed, this       portion rose up at one end sufficiently to allow the passage of       his finger beneath. In this manner he raised the mouth of the       trap (to which the carpet was still fastened by tacks), and I       found that it led into the after hold. He next lit a small taper       by means of a phosphorous match, and, placing the light in a dark       lantern, descended with it through the opening, bidding me       follow. I did so, and he then pulled the cover upon the hole, by       means of a nail driven into the under side—the carpet, of course,       resuming its original position on the floor of the stateroom, and       all traces of the aperture being concealed.        The taper gave out so feeble a ray that it was with the greatest       difficulty I could grope my way through the confused mass of       lumber among which I now found myself. By degrees, however, my       eyes became accustomed to the gloom, and I proceeded with less       trouble, holding on to the skirts of my friend’s coat. He brought       me, at length, after creeping and winding through innumerable       narrow passages, to an iron-bound box, such as is used sometimes       for packing fine earthenware. It was nearly four feet high, and       full six long, but very narrow. Two large empty oil-casks lay on       the top of it, and above these, again, a vast quantity of straw      "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2149"],["title","The Works of Edgar Allan Poe — Volume 3 (#4)"],["body"," matting, piled up as high as the floor of the cabin. In every       other direction around was wedged as closely as possible, even up       to the ceiling, a complete chaos of almost every species of       ship-furniture, together with a heterogeneous medley of crates,       hampers, barrels, and bales, so that it seemed a matter no less       than miraculous that we had discovered any passage at all to the       box. I afterward found that Augustus had purposely arranged the       stowage in this hold with a view to affording me a thorough       concealment, having had only one assistant in the labour, a man       not going out in the brig.        My companion now showed me that one of the ends of the box could       be removed at pleasure. He slipped it aside and displayed the       interior, at which I was excessively amused. A mattress from one       of the cabin berths covered the whole of its bottom, and it       contained almost every article of mere comfort which could be       crowded into so small a space, allowing me, at the same time,       sufficient room for my accommodation, either in a sitting       position or lying at full length. Among other things, there were       some books, pen, ink, and paper, three blankets, a large jug full       of water, a keg of sea-biscuit, three or four immense Bologna       sausages, an enormous ham, a cold leg of roast mutton, and half a       dozen bottles of cordials and liqueurs. I proceeded immediately       to take possession of my little apartment, and this with feelings       of higher satisfaction, I am sure, than any monarch ever       experienced upon entering a new palace. Augustus now pointed out       to me the method of fastening the open end of the box, and then,       holding the taper close to the deck, showed me a piece of dark       whipcord lying along it. This, he said, extended from my       hiding-place throughout all the necessary windings among the       lumber, to a nail which was driven into the deck of the hold,       immediately beneath the trap-door leading into his stateroom. By       means of this cord I should be enabled readily to trace my way       out without his guidance, provided any unlooked-for accident       should render such a step necessary. He now took his departure,       leaving with me the lantern, together with a copious supply of       tapers and phosphorous, and promising to pay me a visit as often       as he could contrive to do so without observation. This was on       the seventeenth of June.        I remained three days and nights (as nearly as I could guess) in       my hiding-place without getting out of it at all, except twice       for the purpose of stretching my limbs by standing erect between       two crates just opposite the opening. During the whole period I       saw nothing of Augustus; but this occasioned me little       uneasiness, as I knew the brig was expected to put to sea every       hour, and in the bustle he would not easily find opportunities of       coming down to me. At length I heard the trap open and shut, and       presently he called in a low voice, asking if all was well, and       if there was any thing I wanted. “Nothing,” I replied; “I am as       comfortable as can be; when will the brig sail?” “She will be       under weigh in less than half an hour,” he answered. “I came to       let you know, and for fear you should be uneasy at my absence. I       shall not have a chance of coming down again for some       time—perhaps for three or four days more. All is going on right       aboveboard. After I go up and close the trap, do you creep along       by the whipcord to where the nail is driven in. You will find my       watch there—it may be useful to you, as you have no daylight to       keep time by. I suppose you can’t tell how long you have been       buried—only three days—this is the twentieth. I would bring the       watch to your box, but am afraid of being missed.” With this he       went up.        In about an hour after he had gone I distinctly felt the brig in       motion, and congratulated myself upon having at length fairly       commenced a voyage. Satisfied with this idea, I determined to       make my mind as easy as possible, and await the course of events       until I should be permitted to exchange the box for the more       roomy, although hardly more comfortable, accommodations of the       cabin. My first care was to get the watch. Leaving the taper       burning, I groped along in the dark, following the cord through       windings innumerable, in some of which I discovered that, after       toiling a long distance, I was brought back within a foot or two       of a former position. At length I reached the nail, and securing       the object of my journey, returned with it in safety. I now       looked over the books which had been so thoughtfully provided,       and selected the expedition of Lewis and Clarke to the mouth of       the Columbia. With this I amused myself for some time, when,       growing sleepy, I extinguished the light with great care, and       soon fell into a sound slumber.        Upon awakening I felt strangely confused in mind, and some time       elapsed before I could bring to recollection all the various       circumstances of my situation. By degrees, however, I remembered       all. Striking a light, I looked at the watch; but it was run       down, and there were, consequently, no means of determining how       long I slept. My limbs were greatly cramped, and I was forced to       relieve them by standing between the crates. Presently feeling an       almost ravenous appetite, I bethought myself of the cold mutton,       some of which I had eaten just before going to sleep, and found       excellent. What was my astonishment in discovering it to be in a       state of absolute putrefaction! This circumstance occasioned me       great disquietude; for, connecting it with the disorder of mind I       experienced upon awakening, I began to suppose that I must have       slept for an inordinately long period of time. The close       atmosphere of the hold might have had something to do with this,       and might, in the end, be productive of the most serious results.       My head ached excessively; I fancied that I drew every breath       with difficulty; and, in short, I was oppressed with a multitude       of gloomy feelings. Still I could not venture to make any       disturbance by opening the trap or otherwise, and, having wound       up the watch, contented myself as well as possible.        Throughout the whole of the next tedious twenty-four hours no       person came to my relief, and I could not help accusing Augustus       of the grossest inattention. What alarmed me chiefly was, that       the water in my jug was reduced to about half a pint, and I was       suffering much from thirst, having eaten freely of the Bologna       sausages after the loss of my mutton. I became very uneasy, and       could no longer take any interest in my books. I was overpowered,       too, with a desire to sleep, yet trembled at the thought of       indulging it, lest there might exist some pernicious influence,       like that of burning charcoal, in the confined air of the hold.       In the meantime the roll of the brig told me that we were far in       the main ocean, and a dull humming sound, which reached my ears       as if from an immense distance, convinced me no ordinary gale was       blowing. I could not imagine a reason for the absence of       Augustus. We were surely far enough advanced on our voyage to       allow of my going up. Some accident might have happened to       him—but I could think of none which would account for his       suffering me to remain so long a prisoner, except, indeed, his       having suddenly died or fallen overboard, and upon this idea I       could not dwell with any degree of patience. It was possible that       we had been baffled by head winds, and were still in the near       vicinity of Nantucket. This notion, however, I was forced to       abandon; for such being the case, the brig must have frequently       gone about; and I was entirely satisfied, from her continual       inclination to the larboard, that she had been sailing all along       with a steady breeze on her starboard quarter. Besides, granting       that we were still in the neighborhood of the island, why should       not Augustus have visited me and informed me of the circumstance?       Pondering in this manner upon the difficulties of my solitary and       cheerless condition, I resolved to wait yet another twenty-four       hours, when, if no relief were obtained, I would make my way to       the trap, and endeavour either to hold a parley with my friend,       or get at least a little fresh air through the opening, and a       further supply of water from the stateroom. While occupied with       this thought, however, I fell in spite of every exertion to the       contrary, into a state of profound sleep, or rather stupor. My       dreams were of the most terrific description. Every species of       calamity and horror befell me. Among other miseries I was       smothered to death between huge pillows, by demons of the most       ghastly and ferocious aspect. Immense serpents held me in their       embrace, and looked earnestly in my face with their fearfully       shining eyes. Then deserts, limitless, and of the most forlorn       and awe-inspiring character, spread themselves out before me.       Immensely tall trunks of trees, gray and leafless, rose up in       endless succession as far as the eye could reach. Their roots       were concealed in wide-spreading morasses, whose dreary water lay       intensely black, still, and altogether terrible, beneath. And the       strange trees seemed endowed with a human vitality, and waving to       and fro their skeleton arms, were crying to the silent waters for "]]]
