A Story of Briton and Boer (#1)"],["body","time, when Aunt Jenny called us, and the Dutchman came and sat with us, while the great Kaffir carried his portion away, and sat under the wagon to munch.  After the meal the Boer lit his pipe, sat down on a piece of rock, and smoked and looked on till midday, by which time the fruit-trees were all planted, and the big Kaffir had trotted to and fro with a couple of buckets, bringing water to fill up the saucer-like depressions placed about each tree.  Then Aunt Jenny called us to dinner, and after that the Boer said it was time to inspan and begin the journey back.  Oh, how well I remember it all!--seeing my father opening a wash-leather bag and paying the Boer the sum that had been agreed upon, and that he wasn't satisfied, but asked for another dollar for the work done by his man.  Then father laughed and said he ought to charge for the meals that had been eaten; but he gave the Boer the money all the same; and Aunt Jenny uttered a deep grunt, and said afterwards in her old-fashioned way, \"Oh John, what a foolish boy you are!\"  Then he kissed her and said, \"Yes, Jen.  I always was.  You didn't half-teach me when I was young.\"  This was after we had watched the wagon grow smaller and smaller in the distance on its way back, and after the great black had stood and looked down at me and laughed in his big, noisy way.  Then once more we were alone in the great desert, father looking proudly down at his little orchard, and Bob walking up and down touching every tree, and counting them over again.  \"Begins to look homely now, Val,\" he said; \"but we must work, boy-- work.\"  We did work hard to make that place the home it grew to.  \"It's for you, boys,\" he said, \"when I'm dead and gone;\" and it was about that time I began to think and understand more fully how father was doing it all for the sake of us boys, and to try and ease his heart-ache.  Aunt Jenny set me thinking by her words, and at last I fully grasped how it all was.  \"I believe he'd have died broken-hearted, Val,\" she said to me, \"if I hadn't come to him.  It was after your poor dear mother passed away.  I told him he was not acting like a man and a father to give up like that, and it roused him; and one day--you remember, it was when I had come to keep house for him--he turned to me and said, `I shall never be happy in England again; and I've been thinking it would be a good thing to take those boys out to the Cape and settle there.  They'll grow up well and strong in the new land, and I shall try to make a home for them yonder.' `Yes, John,' I said, `that's the very thing you ought to do.'  `Ah,' he said, `but it means leaving you behind, Jenny, dear, and you'll perhaps never set eyes upon them again.'  `Oh, yes, I shall, John,' I said, `for I've come to stay.'  `What!' he cried; `would you go with us, sis?' `Yes,' I said, `to the very end of the world.'  So we came here, Val, where there's plenty of room, and no neighbours to find fault with our ways.\"  That's how it was; and now I can admire and think of how Aunt Jenny, the prim maiden lady, gave up all her own old ways to set to and work and drudge for us all, living in a wagon and then in a tent, and smiling pleasantly at the trees we planted, and bringing us lunch where we were working away, dragging down stones for the house which progressed so slowly, though father's ideas wore modest.  \"For,\" said he, \"we'll build one big stone room, Val, and make it into two with part of the tent.  Then by-and-by we'll build another room against it, and then another and another till we get it into a house.\"  Yes, it was hard work getting the stones, and we were busy enough one day in the hot sunshine, about a month after the wagon had been with the trees and stores, when Bob suddenly stood shading his eyes, and cried:  \"Some one's coming!\"  We looked up, and there, far in the distance, I saw a black figure striding along under a great, broad matting-hat.  \"Why, it looks like that great Kaffir, father,\" I said.  \"Nonsense, boy,\" he replied; \"the Kaffirs all look alike at a distance.\"  \"But it is, father,\" I cried excitedly.  \"Look; he's waving his big hat because he sees us.\"  I waved mine in answer; and directly after he began to run, coming up laughing merrily, and ending by throwing down three assagais and the bundle he carried, as he cried:  \"Come back, boss.\"  We gave him something to eat, and the next minute he was lifting and carrying stones, working like a slave; and at night he told me in his way that he was going to stop along with old boss and young boss and little boss and old gal, and never go away no more.    CHAPTER TWO.  OUR UGLY VISITOR.  The black fellow's arrival at such a time was most welcome; but my father put no faith in his declaration.  \"They're all alike, Val,\" he said.  \"He's a quick worker, and as willing and good-tempered as a man can be; but he'll only stay with us till he has earned wages enough to buy himself some bright-coloured blankets and handkerchiefs, and then he'll be off back to his tribe.\"  \"Think so, father?\"  I said.  \"He seems to like us all here.  He says it's better than being with the Boers.  He always says he means to stay.\"  \"He does mean it, of course,\" said my father; \"but these black fellows are like big children, and are easily led away by some new attraction. We shall wake up some morning and find him gone.\"  But seven years glided away, during which apprenticeshiplike time Joeboy, as we called him--for he would not be content with Joe when he had heard the \"boy\" after it once or twice, \"Joeboy\" quite taking his fancy--worked for us constantly, and became the most useful of fellows upon our farm, ready to do anything and do it well, as his strength became tempered with education.  In fact, it grew to be a favourite saying with my father, \"I don't know what we should have done without Joeboy.\"  One of the first persons I saw that morning, when I trotted towards the house after being called by my brother, was the great black hurrying out to meet us; and as we got closer it was to see his face puckered up and his eyes flashing, as he said to me hoarsely:  \"Won't go, Boss Val; won't go.  You tell the Boss I've run up into the hills.  Won't go.\"  \"Here, what do you mean?\"  I said.  \"Boss Boers come to fetch up go and fight.  Won't go.\"  \"Nonsense,\" I said.  \"I dare say they've only come to buy bullocks.\"  \"No,\" said the black, shaking his head fiercely.  \"Come to fetch Joeboy.\"  \"Here, don't run away.\"  \"On'y go up in kopje,\" he said.  \"Hide dar.\"  He rushed away, and I was sure I knew where he would hide himself.  Then I walked on with my brother, to find my father and Aunt Jenny by the door.  \"What's it all about, father?\"  I asked.  \"I don't know yet, my boy; but we soon shall.  There's about a score of the Boers, well mounted and armed.  Yonder they are, coming at a walk. There were only twelve; but another party have caught up to them, and maybe there are more.\"  \"Joeboy has run off in a fright,\" I said.  \"He thinks they've come to fetch him.\"  \"Oh no; it isn't that, my boy,\" said my father.  \"I fear it's something worse.\"  \"What?\"  I said wonderingly.    CHAPTER THREE.  MY FIRST REAL TROUBLE.  Before my father could reply a body of horsemen cantered up, every man well mounted, rifle in hand, and carrying a cross-belt over his left shoulder fitted with cartridges, bandolier fashion.  Their leader, a big, heavily-bearded, fierce-looking fellow, dropped from his saddle, threw the rein to one of his companions, and then swaggered up to us, scanning us with his eyes half-closed, and with a haughty, contemptuous expression in his countenance.  \"Ye're John Moray, I suppose?\" he said, turning to my father, after looking me up and down in a way I, a hot-blooded and independent lad of eighteen, did not at all like.  \"Yes,\" said my father quietly, \"I'm John Moray.  Do you want some refreshment for your men and horses?\"  \"Yes, of course,\" said our visitor; and I wondered why such a big-bearded, broad-shouldered fellow should speak in so high-pitched a tone.  That he was Irish he proved directly; but that excited no surprise, for we were accustomed to offer hospitality to men of various nationalities from time to time--Scots, Finns, Germans, Swedes, and Norwegians--trekking up-country in search of a place to settle on.  \"Will you dismount and tie up, then?\" said my father; \"and we'll see what we can do.--Val, my lad, you will see to the horses having a feed?\"  \"Yes, father,\" was on my lips, when the Irish leader turned upon me sharply with:  \"Oh, ye're Val--are ye?\"  \"Yes,\" I said, rather sharply, for the man's aggressive manner nettled me; \"my name is Valentine.\"  \"And is it, now?\" he said, with a mocking laugh.  \"Ye're a penny plain and tuppence coloured, I suppose?  Coloured, bedad!  Look at his face!\"  \"I don't see the joke,\" I said sharply.  \"Don't ye, now?  Then ye soon will, my fine chap.  Let's see, now; how old are ye?\"  I made no reply, and my father replied gravely:  \"My son is eighteen.\"  \"Is he, now?  And ye're forty, I suppose?\"  \"I am sorry to say I am over fifty,\" replied my father, as I stood chafing at the man's insolent, bullying tone.  \"Then ye don't look it, sor.  But there, we'll leave ye alone for a bit. I dare say we can do without ye this time, and take the bhoy.\"  \"What for--where?\" said my father quickly.  \"What for--where?\" cried the man.  \"For the commando, of course.\"  \"The commando?\" said my father, while I felt staggered, only half-grasping the import of his words.  \"Yes, sor, the commando.  D'ye suppose ye are to have the protection of the State, and do nothing again' your counthry's inimies?  If ye do ye're greatly mistaken.  Every man must take his turn to difind the counthry, and ye may feel preciously contented that ye don't have to join yerself.\"  \"But I have heard of no rising,\" said my father, looking at me anxiously.  \"The blacks all about here are peaceable and friendly.\"  \"Not the blackest blacks, sor,\" said the man, drawing"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21302"],["title","Charge! A Story of Briton and Boer (#2)"],["body","up and raising one hand and his voice in an oratorical way; \"the blacks I mane are white-skinned, but black in the heart through and through; the blacks who are the dispisers of progress, the foes of freedom, the inimies of the counthry, sor--the despicable, insolent Saxons.\"  \"Do you mean the English?\" said my father coolly.  \"I do that, sor,\" said the man defiantly; \"and the day has dawned at last when the down-thrampled Boers are goin' to give them a lesson that shall make the British lion snaik out of this counthry with his tail between his legs like a beaten dog.\"  \"You are a British subject, sir,\" said my father.  \"Mahn, I scorrun it,\" cried our visitor.  \"I have thrown off all fealty years ago, and am a free Irishman, and captain of the body of brave men who are going to dhrive the tyranny of England out of this colony for ever.\"  \"This is all news to me, sir,\" said my father coldly.  \"Is it, sor?\" said our visitor mockingly.  \"Then I'm proud to be the bearer of the great news.\"  \"Do you mean to tell me, then,\" said my father, \"that there is war declared by England against the Boers?\"  \"No, sor,\" cried the fellow insolently; \"but I tell you that we have declared war again' the brutal Saxon.\"  \"We, sir?\" said my father gravely.  \"But you are one of the Queen's servants--an Irishman.\"  \"Nothing of the sort, sor.  I disown England; I disowned her when I came out here to throw meself into the arrums of the brave, suffering, pathriotic race around me, and placed my sword at their service.\"  \"Then you are a soldier, I presume?\" said my father.  \"I was tin years in the arrmy, sor,\" said our visitor, drawing himself up and clapping his hand upon his chest.  \"Look at thim,\" he continued, pointing to his followers drawn up in line.  \"A part of my following, and as fine irrigular cavalry as ever threw leg over saddle.--Look here, young man, ye're in luck, for ye'll have the honour of serving in Captain Eustace Moriarty's troop.\"  \"You are Captain Eustace Moriarty?\" said my father.  \"I am, sor.\"  \"Then I must tell you, sir,\" said my father, \"that though I have taken up land here and made it my home, I claim my rights as an Englishman not to make myself a traitor by taking up arms against my Queen.\"  \"A thraitor!\" cried the captain.  \"Bah!  That for the Queen;\" and he snapped his fingers.  \"But ye're not asked to serve now.  That can wait till ye're wanted.  It's the bhoy we want, and maybe after a bit it'll be you.\"  \"My son thinks as I do,\" said my father sternly.  \"Does he, now?\" said the captain mockingly.  \"Then I shall have to tache him to think as I do, and it won't take long.  D'ye hear me, bhoy?\"  \"I hear what you say, sir,\" I replied.  \"Of course I think as my father does, and I refuse to serve against England.\"  \"I expected it,\" said the man, with cool insolence.  \"It's what I expected from a young Saxon.  But look here, me bhoy; ye've got to serrve whether ye like it or whether ye don't.  What's more, ye've got to come at once.  So get yer horse, and clap the saddle on.  Fetch him his rifle and his cartridge-bolt, and let there be no more nonsense.\"  \"You heard what my son said, sir,\" said my father haughtily.  \"If it were against a black enemy of the country we should both be willing.\"  \"Didn't I tell ye it was again' a black inimy?\" said the man mockingly.  \"I heard you insult the Queen and her Government, sir,\" said my father; \"and, once more, my son refuses to serve.\"  \"The coward!--the white-livered cub!\" cried the captain contemptuously.  \"What!\"  I cried, springing forward; but my father flung his hand across my chest, and Bob rushed in past Aunt Jenny, as if to take refuge from the scene.  \"Quite right, old man,\" said the captain, coolly stroking his beard. \"And look here, bhoy whether ye like it or not, ye're a sojer now; I'm yer shuperior officer, and it's time of war.  If a man strikes his shuperior officer, he's stood up with a handkerchief tied across his eyes to prevent him from winking and spoiling the men's aim, and then the firing-party does the rest.\"  As he spoke he made a sign, and half-a-dozen of the mounted Boers rode up.  \"Sargint,\" he said, \"the young colt's a bit fractious.  Ye'll take him in hand.  Fasten his hands behind him ready.  Two of ye go round to the pen there and pick out the most likely horse, saddle and bridle him, and bring him here.  Ye've got some green-leather thongs.  Then put him upon the horse with his face to the tail, and tie his ankles underneath. It'll be a fine lesson for the bhoy in rough-riding.\"  The men were quick enough.  Before I had even thought of trying to make my escape, two of the Boers were off their horses and made me their prisoner, while the rest of the little troop rode closer up and surrounded us.  Then other two of the men rode off behind the house, and I stood breathing hard, biting my lips, and feeling as if something hot was burning my chest as I tried hard to catch my father's averted eyes.  Just then the Irish renegade captain burst into a hearty laugh, and I wrenched myself round to look, and felt better.  A minute before, I had seen Bob disappear into the house, and had mentally denounced him as a miserable little coward; but my eyes flashed now as I saw him hurry out with three rifles over his right shoulder, a bandolier belt across his left, and two more, well filled with cartridges, hanging to the barrels of the rifles.  \"Bedad!\" said the captain, \"and he's worth fifty of his big, hulking brother!  But ye're too shmall, darlint.  Wait a year or two longer, and ye shall fight under me like a man.\"  Bob made a rush for father; but one of the Boers leaned down and caught him by the shoulder, while another snatched the rifles from his hands, and laid them across the pommel of the saddle in which he sat.  \"Give up, Bob; give up,\" cried father sternly, as my brother began to struggle with all his might.  \"It is no use to fight against fate.\"  \"Hear him now,\" said the captain.  \"He can talk sinse at times.\"  \"Yes,\" said my father, \"at times;\" and he gave the captain a look which made him turn away his eyes.--\"Val, my boy, I cannot have you exposed to the ignominy of being bound.\"  \"Sure, no,\" cried the captain.  \"I forgot to say a wurrud about stirrup-leathers across his back if he didn't behave himself.\"  \"Fate is against us for the present, my boy,\" continued my father, \"and you must ride with this party till I have applied to the proper quarters to get the matter righted.\"  \"Now, man, be aloive,\" said the captain, and I winced and looked vainly round for a way of escape; but I was seized by the wrist by another dismounted Boer, who slipped a raw-hide noose over my wrist, just as two more came riding back, leading my own horse, Sandho, between them.  The poor beast, who followed me like a dog, uttered a shrill neigh as soon as he caught sight of me, springing forward to reach my side.  \"Stop!\" cried my father loudly; \"there is no need for that.  My son will ride with you, sir.\"  \"Indade, sir, I'm obleeged to ye for the inforrmation,\" said the captain mockingly; \"but sure it's a work of shupererrogation, me dear friend, for I knew it, and that he was going to ride backward.  If, however, he gives up sinsibly, he may ride with his back to the horse's tail, and ye needn't tie his ankles togither.  Have ye ever ridden that horse before?\"  \"He has ridden it hundreds of times, ever since it was a foal,\" said my father quickly, for I felt choked.--\"Stop, man,\" he added angrily; \"your captain said my son was not to be bound.\"  \"Sure I didn't say a wurrud about his wrists, old man,\" cried the captain contemptuously.  \"Ye want too much.  I've let him off about the ankles, and let him ride face forward, so be contint.  Make his wrists fast behind him.\"  I was compelled to resign myself to my fate, and stood fighting hard to keep down all emotion while my wrists were secured firmly behind my back, the thin raw-hide cutting painfully into the flesh.  By this time Sandho was bridled and saddled, and just then my father turned to Bob.  \"Take in those rifles, my boy,\" he said.  The captain turned sharply and gave my father a searching look; but he contented himself with nodding, and my brother snatched the rifles from where they lay across the Boer's knees, and rushed indoors with them.  I knew well enough why, poor fellow: it was to hide the tears struggling to rise, and of which he was ashamed.  Just then I had harder work than ever to control my own feelings, for Aunt Jenny hurried towards me, but was kept back by my captors; and I saw her go to my father and throw her arms about his neck, while he bent over her and seemed to be trying to whisper comfort.  \"There, up with ye, me bhoy,\" cried the captain.  \"Ye can't mount, though, with yer hands behind yer like a prishner.--Lift him on, two of ye, like a sack.\"  \"That they shan't,\" I said between my teeth; and feeling now that what was to como was inevitable, I took a couple of steps to my horse's side.  \"Stand!\"  I said aloud as I raised one foot to the stirrup; and Sandho stood as rigid as if of bronze, while I made a spring, raised myself up, and threw my leg over.  \"Well done, bhoy!\" cried the captain as I sank into the saddle.--\"You, Hooger, take his rein.  Unfasten one end from the bit so as to give ye double length, and ye'd better buckle it to your saddle-bow.--Now look here, me fine fellow,\" he continued, addressing me, \"ye'll give me none of your nawnsense; for, look ye, my bhoys are all practised shots with the rifle.  They can bring down a spring-bok going at full speed, so they can easily bring ye down and yer nag too.  There's twenty of them, and I'm a good shot meself, so ye know what to expect if ye thry to escape.\"  I said nothing, for I was thinking with agony about poor Aunt Jenny, who was now coming up to me, and the captain laughed as he saw her pain-wrung countenance.  \"Good-bye, Val, my boy,\" said my father slowly; \"and bear up like a man.\"  That was all, and he"]]]
