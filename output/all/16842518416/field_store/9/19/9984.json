The late earl had left a married daughter, to whom, according to the customary courtesy of English sovereigns in similar circumstances, the title ought to have been continued; and as this lady had no children, the earl of Bath, as head of the house, felt himself also aggrieved by the alienation of family honors which he hoped to have seen continued to himself and his posterity.  In honor, probably, of the recent marriage of the king, unusually splendid justs were opened at Westminster on May-day; in which the challengers were headed by sir John Dudley, and the defenders by the earl of Surry. This entertainment was continued for several successive days, during which the challengers, according to the costly fashion of ancient hospitality, kept open house at their common charge, and feasted the king and queen, the members of both houses, and the lord-mayor and aldermen with their wives.  But scenes of pomp and festivity had no power to divert the thoughts of the king from his domestic grievance,--a wife whom he regarded with disgust: on the contrary, it is probable that this season of courtly revelry encreased his disquiet, by giving him opportunities of beholding under the most attractive circumstances the charms of a youthful beauty whom he was soon seized with the most violent desire of placing beside him on the throne which he judged her worthy to adorn.  No considerations of rectitude or of policy could longer restrain the impetuous monarch from casting off the yoke of a detested marriage: and as a first step towards emancipation, he determined to permit the ruin of its original adviser, that unpopular minister, but vigorous and serviceable instrument of arbitrary power, whom he had hitherto defended with pertinacity against all attacks.  No sooner was the decline of his favor perceived, and what so quickly perceived at courts? than the ill-fated Cromwel found himself assailed on every side. His active agency in the suppression of monasteries had brought upon him, with the imputation of sacrilege, the hatred of all the papists;--a certain coldness, or timidity, which he had manifested in the cause of religious reformation in other respects, and particularly the enactment of the Six Articles during his administration, had rendered him an object of suspicion or dislike to the protestants;--in his new and undefined office of royal vicegerent for the exercise of the supremacy, he had offended the whole body of the clergy;--and he had just filled up the measure of his offences against the nobility by procuring a grant of the place of lord high-steward, long hereditary in the great house of the Veres earls of Oxford. The only voice raised in his favor was that of Cranmer, who interceded with Henry in his behalf in a letter eloquent, touching, and even courageous, times and persons considered. Gardiner and the duke of Norfolk urged on his accusation; the parliament, with its accustomed subserviency, proceeded against him by attainder; and having voted him guilty of heresy and treason, left it in the choice of the king to bring him either to the block or the stake for whichever he pleased of these offences; neither of which was proved by evidence, or even supported by reasonable probabilities. But against this violation in his person of the chartered rights of Englishmen, however flagrant, the unfortunate earl of Essex had forfeited all right to appeal, since it was himself who had first advised the same arbitrary mode of proceeding in the cases of the marchioness of Exeter, of the countess of Salisbury, and of several persons of inferior rank connected with them; on whom capital punishment had already been inflicted.  With many private virtues, Essex, like his great master Wolsey, and like the disgraced ministers of despotic princes in general, perished unpitied; and the king and the faction of Gardiner and of the Howards seemed equally to rejoice in the free course opened by his removal to their further projects. The parliament was immediately ordered to find valid a certain frivolous pretext of a prior contract, on which its master was pleased to demand a divorce from Ann of Cleves; and the marriage was unanimously declared null, without any opportunity afforded to the queen of bringing evidence in its support.  The fortitude, or rather phlegm, with which her unmerited degradation was supported by the lady Anne, has in it something at once extraordinary and amusing. There is indeed a tradition that she fainted on first receiving the information that her marriage was likely to be set aside; but the shock once over, she gave to the divorce, without hesitation or visible reluctance, that assent which was required of her. Taking in good part the pension of three thousand pounds per annum, and the title of his _sister_ which her ex-husband was graciously pleased to offer her, she wrote to her brother the elector to entreat him still to live in amity with the king of England, against whom she had no ground of complaint; and she continued, till the day of her death, to make his country her abode. Through the whole affair she gave no indication of wounded pride; unless her refusal to return in the character of a discarded and rejected damsel, to the home which she had so lately quitted in all the pomp and triumph of a royal bride, is to be regarded as such. But even for this part of her conduct a different motive is with great plausibility assigned by a writer, who supposes her to have been swayed by the prudent consideration, that the regular payment of her pension would better be secured by her remaining under the eyes and within the protection of the English nation.  A very few weeks after this apparently formidable business had been thus readily and amicably arranged, Catherine Howard niece to the duke of Norfolk, and first cousin to Anne Boleyn, was declared queen. This lady, beautiful, insinuating, and more fondly beloved by the king than any of her predecessors, was a catholic, and almost all the members of the council who now possessed office or influence were attached, more or less openly, to the same communion. In consequence, the penalties of the Six Articles were enforced with great cruelty against the reformers; but this did not exempt from punishment such as, offending on the other side, ventured to deny the royal supremacy; the only difference was, that the former class of culprits were burned as heretics, the latter hanged as traitors.  The king soon after seized the occasion of a trifling insurrection in Yorkshire, of which sir John Nevil was the leader, to complete his vengeance against cardinal Pole, by bringing to a cruel and ignominious end the days of his venerable and sorrow-stricken mother, who had been unfortunate enough thus long to survive the ruin of her family. The strange and shocking scene exhibited on the scaffold by the desperation of this illustrious and injured lady, is detailed by all our historians: it seems almost incredible that the surrounding crowd were not urged by an unanimous impulse of horror and compassion to rush in and rescue from the murderous hands of the executioner the last miserable representative of such a line of princes. But the eyes of Henry's subjects were habituated to these scenes of blood; and they were viewed by some with indifference, and by the rest with emotions of terror which effectually repressed the generous movements of a just and manly indignation.  In public causes, to be accused and to suffer death were now the same thing; and another eminent victim of the policy of the English Tiberius displayed in a novel and truly portentous manner his utter despair of the justice of the country and the mercy of his sovereign.  Lord Leonard Grey, late deputy of Ireland, was accused of favouring the escape of that persecuted child his nephew Gerald Fitzgerald, of corresponding with cardinal Pole, and of various other offences called treasonable. Being brought before a jury of knights, \"he saved them,\" says lord Herbert, \"the labour of condemning him, and without more ado confessed all. Which, whether this lord, who was of great courage, did out of desperation or guilt, some circumstances make doubtful; and the rather, that the articles being so many, he neither denied nor extenuated any of them, though his continual fighting with the king's enemies, where occasion was, pleaded much on his part. Howsoever, he had his head cut off[8].\"  [Note 8: Many years after, the earl of Kildare solemnly assured the author of the \"Chronicles of Ireland\" in Holinshed, that lord Leonard Grey had no concern whatever in his escape.]  The queen and her party were daily gaining upon the mind of the king; and Cranmer himself, notwithstanding the high esteem entertained for him by Henry, had begun to be endangered by their machinations, when an unexpected discovery put into his hands the means of baffling all their designs, and producing a total revolution in the face of the court.  It was towards the close of the year 1541 that private information was conveyed to the primate of such disorders in the conduct of the queen before her marriage as could not fail to plunge her in infamy and ruin. Cranmer, if not exceedingly grieved, was at least greatly perplexed by the incident:--at first sight there appeared to be equal danger in concealing or discovering circumstances of a nature so delicate, and the archbishop was timid by nature, and cautious from the experience of a court. At length, all things well weighed, he judiciously preferred the hazard of making the communication at once, without reserve, and directly, to the person most interested; and, forming into a narrative facts which his tongue dared not utter to the face of a prince whose anger was deadly, he presented it to him and entreated him to peruse it in secret.  Love and pride conspired to persuade the king that his Catherine was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2151"],["title","The Works of Edgar Allan Poe — Volume 5 (#0)"],["body","Works of Edgar Allan Poe  by Edgar Allan Poe  The Raven Edition  VOLUME V.

In the internal decoration, if not in the external architecture of their       residences, the English are supreme. The Italians have but little       sentiment beyond marbles and colours. In France, _meliora probant,       deteriora _sequuntur—the people are too much a race of gadabouts       to maintain those household proprieties of which, indeed, they have a       delicate appreciation, or at least the elements of a proper sense. The       Chinese and most of the eastern races have a warm but inappropriate fancy.       The Scotch are _poor _decorists. The Dutch have, perhaps, an       indeterminate idea that a curtain is not a cabbage. In Spain they are _all       _curtains—a nation of hangmen. The Russians do not furnish. The       Hottentots and Kickapoos are very well in their way. The Yankees alone are       preposterous.            How this happens, it is not difficult to see. We have no aristocracy of       blood, and having therefore as a natural, and indeed as an inevitable       thing, fashioned for ourselves an aristocracy of dollars, the _display       of wealth _has here to take the place and perform the office of the       heraldic display in monarchical countries. By a transition readily       understood, and which might have been as readily foreseen, we have been       brought to merge in simple _show_ our notions of taste itself.            To speak less abstractly. In England, for example, no mere parade of       costly appurtenances would be so likely as with us, to create an       impression of the beautiful in respect to the appurtenances themselves—or       of taste as regards the proprietor:—this for the reason, first, that       wealth is not, in England, the loftiest object of ambition as constituting       a nobility; and secondly, that there, the true nobility of blood,       confining itself within the strict limits of legitimate taste, rather       avoids than affects that mere costliness in which a _parvenu _rivalry       may at any time be successfully attempted.            The people _will _imitate the nobles, and the result is a thorough       diffusion of the proper feeling. But in America, the coins current being       the sole arms of the aristocracy, their display may be said, in general,       to be the sole means of the aristocratic distinction; and the populace,       looking always upward for models, are insensibly led to confound the two       entirely separate ideas of magnificence and beauty. In short, the cost of       an article of furniture has at length come to be, with us, nearly the sole       test of its merit in a decorative point of view—and this test, once       established, has led the way to many analogous errors, readily traceable       to the one primitive folly.            There could be nothing more directly offensive to the eye of an artist       than the interior of what is termed in the United States—that is to       say, in Appallachia—a well-furnished apartment. Its most usual       defect is a want of keeping. We speak of the keeping of a room as we would       of the keeping of a picture—for both the picture and the room are       amenable to those undeviating principles which regulate all varieties of       art; and very nearly the same laws by which we decide on the higher merits       of a painting, suffice for decision on the adjustment of a chamber.            A want of keeping is observable sometimes in the character of the several       pieces of furniture, but generally in their colours or modes of adaptation       to use _Very _often the eye is offended by their inartistic       arrangement. Straight lines are too prevalent—too uninterruptedly       continued—or clumsily interrupted at right angles. If curved lines       occur, they are repeated into unpleasant uniformity. By undue precision,       the appearance of many a fine apartment is utterly spoiled.            Curtains are rarely well disposed, or well chosen in respect to other       decorations. With formal furniture, curtains are out of place; and an       extensive volume of drapery of any kind is, under any circumstance,       irreconcilable with good taste—the proper quantum, as well as the       proper adjustment, depending upon the character of the general effect.            Carpets are better understood of late than of ancient days, but we still       very frequently err in their patterns and colours. The soul of the       apartment is the carpet. From it are deduced not only the hues but the       forms of all objects incumbent. A judge at common law may be an ordinary       man; a good judge of a carpet _must be _a genius. Yet we have heard       discoursing of carpets, with the air “_d’un mouton qui reve,” _fellows       who should not and who could not be entrusted with the management of their       own _moustaches. _Every one knows that a large floor _may _have       a covering of large figures, and that a small one must have a covering of       small—yet this is not all the knowledge in the world. As regards       texture, the Saxony is alone admissible. Brussels is the preterpluperfect       tense of fashion, and Turkey is taste in its dying agonies. Touching       pattern—a carpet should _not _be bedizzened out like a Riccaree       Indian—all red chalk, yellow ochre, and cock’s feathers. In brief—distinct       grounds, and vivid circular or cycloid figures, _of no meaning, _are       here Median laws. The abomination of flowers, or representations of       well-known objects of any kind, should not be endured within the limits of       Christendom. Indeed, whether on carpets, or curtains, or tapestry, or       ottoman coverings, all upholstery of this nature should be rigidly       Arabesque. As for those antique floor-cloth & still occasionally seen       in the dwellings of the rabble—cloths of huge, sprawling, and       radiating devises, stripe-interspersed, and glorious with all hues, among       which no ground is intelligible—these are but the wicked invention       of a race of time-servers and money-lovers—children of Baal and       worshippers of Mammon—Benthams, who, to spare thought and economize       fancy, first cruelly invented the Kaleidoscope, and then established       joint-stock companies to twirl it by steam.            _Glare_ is a leading error in the philosophy of American household       decoration—an error easily recognised as deduced from the perversion       of taste just specified., We are violently enamoured of gas and of glass.       The former is totally inadmissible within doors. Its harsh and unsteady       light offends. No one having both brains and eyes will use it. A mild, or       what artists term a cool light, with its consequent warm shadows, will do       wonders for even an ill-furnished apartment. Never was a more lovely       thought than that of the astral lamp. We mean, of course, the astral lamp       proper—the lamp of Argand, with its original plain ground-glass       shade, and its tempered and uniform moonlight rays. The cut-glass shade is       a weak invention of the enemy. The eagerness with which we have adopted       it, partly on account of its _flashiness,_ but principally on account       of its _greater rest,_ is a good commentary on the proposition with       which we began. It is not too much to say, that the deliberate employer of       a cut-glass shade, is either radically deficient in taste, or blindly       subservient to the caprices of fashion. The light proceeding from one of       these gaudy abominations is unequal broken, and painful. It alone is       sufficient to mar a world of good effect in the furniture subjected to its       influence. Female loveliness, in especial, is more than one-half       disenchanted beneath its evil eye.            In the matter of glass, generally, we proceed upon false principles. Its       leading feature is _glitter—_and in that one word how much of       all that is detestable do we express! Flickering, unquiet lights, are _sometimes       _pleasing—to children and idiots always so—but in the       embellishment of a room they should be scrupulously avoided. In truth,       even strong _steady _lights are inadmissible. The huge and unmeaning       glass chandeliers, prism-cut, gas-lighted, and without shade, which dangle       in our most fashionable drawing-rooms, may be cited as the quintessence of       all that is false in taste or preposterous in folly.            The rage for _glitter-_because its idea has become as we before       observed, confounded with that of magnificence in the abstract—has       led us, also, to the exaggerated employment of mirrors. We line our       dwellings"]]]
