He had been walking swiftly some five minutes, moved by only one desire--that of getting away from the house--when he awoke to the fact that he was going straight towards the constable's quarters and the old-fashioned lock-up where Mike must be lying, getting rid of the consequences of his holiday-making that morning.  Don turned sharply round in another direction, one which led him towards the wharves where the shipping lay.  While this was taking place, Jem Wimble had been banging the doors and rattling his keys as he locked up the various stores, feeling particularly proud and self-satisfied with the confidence placed in him.  After this was done he had a wash at the pump, fetching a piece of soap from a ledge inside the workshop where the cooper's tools were kept, and when he had duly rubbed and scrubbed and dried his face and hands, he went indoors to stare with astonishment, for his little wife was making the most of her size by sitting very upright as she finished her tea.  Jem plumped himself indignantly down, and began his.  This was a new annoyance.  Sally had scolded times out of number, and found fault with him for being so late, but this was the first time that she had ever begun a meal without his being present, and he felt bitterly hurt.  \"As if I could help it,\" he said, half aloud.  \"A man has his work to do, and he must do it.\"  \"Five o'clock's tea-time, and you ought to have been here.\"  \"And if I wasn't here, it was your dooty to wait for me, marm.\"  \"Was it?\" cried Sally; \"then I wasn't going to.  I'm not going to be ordered about and ill-treated, Jem; you always said you liked your tea ready at five o'clock.  I had it ready at five o'clock, and I waited till half-past, and it's now five-and-twenty to six.\"  \"I don't care if it's five-and-twenty to nineteen!\" cried Jem angrily. \"It's your dooty to wait, same as it's mine to shut up.\"  \"You might have shut up after tea.\"  \"Then I wasn't going to, marm.\"  \"Then you may have your tea by yourself, for I've done, and I'm not going to be trampled upon by you.\"  Sally had risen in the loudness of her voice, in her temper, and in her person, for she had got up from her chair; but neither elevation was great; in fact, the personal height was very small, and there was something very kittenish and comic in her appearance, as she crossed the bright little kitchen to the door at the flight of stairs, and passing through, banged it behind her, and went up to her room.  \"Very well,\" said Jem, as he sat staring at the door; \"very well, marm. So this is being married.  My father used to say that if two people as is married can't agree, they ought to divide the house between 'em, but one ought to take the outside and t'other the in.  That's what I'm a-going to do, only, seeing what a bit of a doll of a thing you are, and being above it, I'm going to take the outside myself.  There's coffee bags enough to make a man a good bed up in the ware'us, and it won't be the first time I've shifted for myself, so I shall stop away till you fetches me back.  Do you hear?\"  \"Oh, yes, I can hear,\" replied Sally from the top of the stairs, Jem having shouted his last speech.  \"All right, then,\" said Jem: \"so now we understands each other and can go ahead.\"  Tightening up his lips, Jem rinsed out the slop-basin, shovelled in a good heap of sugar, and then proceeded to empty the teapot, holding the lid in its place with one fat finger the while.  This done, he emptied the little milk jug also, stirred all well up together, and left it for a few minutes to cool, what time he took the cottage loaf from the white, well-scrubbed trencher, pulled it in two, took a handful of bread out of one half, and raising the lump of fresh Somersetshire butter on the point of a knife, he dabbed it into the hole he had made in the centre, shut it up by replacing the other half of the bread, and then taking out his handkerchief spread it upon his knee and tied the loaf tightly therein.  Then for a moment or two he hesitated about taking the knife, but finally concluding that the clasp knife in his pocket would do, he laid the blade on the table, gave his tea a final stir, gulped down the basinful, tucked the loaf in the handkerchief under his left arm, his hat very much on one side, and then walked out and through the gate, which he closed with a loud bang.  \"Oh!\" ejaculated Sally, who had run to the bedroom window, \"he has gone!\"  Sally was quite right, Jem, her husband, was gone away to his favourite place for smoking a pipe, down on the West Main wharf, where he seated himself on a stone mooring post, placed the bundle containing the loaf beside him, and then began to eat heartily?  Nothing of the kind.  Jem was thinking very hard about home and his little petulant, girlish wife.  Then he started and stared.  \"Hullo, Jem, you here?\"  \"Why, Mas' Don, I thought you was at home having your tea.\"  \"I thought you were having yours, Jem.\"  \"No, Mas' Don,\" said Jem sadly; \"there's my tea\"--and he pointed to the bundle handkerchief; \"there's my tea; leastwise I will tell the truth, o' course--there's part on it; t'other part's inside, for I couldn't tie that up, or I'd ha' brought it same ways to have down here and look at the ships.\"  \"Then why don't you eat it, man?\"  \"'Cause I can't, sir.  I've had so much o' my Sally that I don't want no wittals.\"  Don said nothing, but sat down by Jem Wimble to look at the ships.    CHAPTER EIGHT.  KITTY CHRISTMAS SITS UP.  \"My dear Laura,\" said Uncle Josiah that same evening, \"you misjudge me; Lindon's welfare is as dear to me as that of my little Kitty.\"  \"But you seemed to be so hard and stern with him.\"  \"That is your weak womanly way of looking at it, my dear I may have been stern, but no more so than the matter warranted.  No, my dear sister, can you not see that I mean all this as a lesson for Lindon?  You know how discontented he has been with his lot, like many more boys at his time of life, when they do not judge very well as to whether they are well off.\"  \"Yes, he has been unsettled lately.\"  \"Exactly, and this is due to his connection with that ne'er-do-weel scoundrel, for whom the boy has displayed an unconquerable liking. Lindon has begged the man on again four times after he had been discharged from the yard for drunkenness and neglect.\"  \"I did not know this,\" said Mrs Lavington.  \"No, I do not bring all my business troubles home.  I consented because I wished Lindon to realise for himself the kind of man whose cause he advocated; but I never expected that it would be brought home to him so severely as this.\"  \"Then indeed, Josiah, you do not think Lindon guilty?\"  \"Bah!  Of course not, you foolish little woman.  The boy is too frank and manly, too much of a gentleman to degrade himself in such a way. Guilty?  Nonsense!  Guilty of being proud and obstinate and stubborn. Guilty of neglecting his work to listen to that idle scoundrel's romancing about places he has never seen.\"  \"He is so young.\"  \"Young?  Old enough to know better.\"  \"But if you could bring it home to him more gently.\"  \"I think the present way is an admirable one for showing the boy his folly.  The bird who kept company with the jackdaws had his neck wrung, innocent as he was.  I want Lindon to see how very near he has been to having his neck wrung through keeping company with a jackdaw.  Now, my dear Laura, leave it to me.  The magistrates will grasp the case at once, and Master Lindon will receive a severe admonition from some one else, which will bring him to his senses, and then we shall go on quite smoothly again.\"  \"You cannot tell how happy you have made me feel,\" said Mrs Lavington, as she wept silently.  \"Well,\" said Uncle Josiah, \"I want to make you happy, you poor timid little bird.  Now, then, try to believe that I am acting for the best.\"  \"And you will not be so stern with him?\"  \"As far as my lights will illumine me, I will do what is right by my sister's boy, Laura--the lad I want to see grow up into a straightforward Englishman, proud of his name.  There, can I say more fairly than that?\"  \"No.  I only beg that you will think of Lindon as a high-spirited boy, who, though he does not always do as you wish, is still extremely sensitive.\"  \"Proud and stubborn, eh, Laura?\"  \"I will say no more, my own brother, only leave myself in your hands.\"  \"Yes, you may well look at the clock,\" said Uncle Josiah, laughing, as he put his arm round his sister, and kissed her very tenderly; \"the young dog is unconscionably late.\"  \"You do not think--after what I said?\"  \"Think?  Nonsense.  No, no.  Lindon is too manly for that.  Here, I am sure that you have a terrible headache, and you are worn out.  Go to bed, and I'll sit up for the young rascal, and have a talk to him when he comes in.\"  \"No, no!\" exclaimed Mrs Lavington excitedly; \"I do not like you to sit up for him.  I will.\"  \"Not you.  Too tired out as it is.  No, my dear, you shall go to bed, and I will sit up for him.\"  \"Then let neither of us sit up.\"  \"Afraid I shall scold him, eh?\"  \"I cannot help being afraid of something of the kind, dear.\"  \"Very well, then we will both go, and let Jessie sit up.\"  The maid was rung for, and entered.  \"We are going to bed, Jessie.  Master Lindon has not returned yet.  You will sit up until he comes in.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  The maid left the room, and brother and sister sat looking at each other.  \"Did you speak, Josiah?\" said Mrs Lavington.  \"No; I was only thinking that I do not trust you and you don't trust me.\"  \"What do you mean?\" faltered the poor woman, who looked more agitated now.  \"You were not going to bed, but to listen for Lindon's return, and were then going to watch whether I left my room to talk to him.\"  Mrs Lavington was silent.  \"Guilty,\" said Uncle Josiah, smiling.  \"Come now, fair play.  Will you go to your room and promise to stay there till breakfast time to-morrow morning, if I give you my word to do the same?\"  \"Yes,\" said the shrinking"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21321"],["title","Before the Dawn: A Story of the Fall of Richmond (#0)"],["body","the Dawn  A Story of the Fall of Richmond  By  JOSEPH A.

He carried his left arm stiffly, his face was thin and brown, and his dingy uniform had holes in it, some made by bullets; but his air and manner were happy, as if, escaped from danger and hardships, he rode on his way to pleasure and ease.  He sat for a time gazing out of the window at the gray, wintry landscape that fled past, and then, having a youthful zest for new things, looked at those who traveled with him in the car. The company seemed to him, on the whole, to lack novelty and interest, being composed of farmers going to the capital of the Confederacy to sell food; wounded soldiers like himself, bound for the same place in search of cure; and one woman who sat in a corner alone, neither speaking nor spoken to, her whole aspect repelling any rash advance.  Prescott always had a keen eye for woman and beauty, and owing to his long absence in armies, where both these desirable objects were scarce, his vision had become acute; but he judged that this lone type of her sex had no special charm. Tall she certainly was, and her figure might be good, but no one with a fair face and taste would dress as plainly as she, nor wrap herself so completely in a long, brown cloak that he could not even tell the colour of her eyes. Beautiful women, as he knew them, always had a touch of coquetry, and never hid their charms wholly.  Prescott's attention wandered again to the landscape rushing past, but finding little of splendour or beauty, it came back, by and by, to the lone woman. He wondered why she was going to Richmond and what was her name. She, too, was now staring out of the window, and the long cloak hiding her seemed so shapeless that he concluded her figure must be bad. His interest declined at once, but rose again with her silence and evident desire to be left alone.  As they were approaching Richmond a sudden jar of the train threw a small package from her lap to the floor. Prescott sprang forward, picked it up and handed it to her. She received it with a curt \"Thanks,\" and the noise of the train was so great that Prescott could tell nothing about the quality of her voice. It might or might not be musical, but in any event she was not polite and showed no gratitude. If he had thought to use the incident as an opening for conversation, he dismissed the idea, as she turned her face back to the window at once and resumed her study of the gray fields.  \"Probably old and plain,\" was Prescott's thought, and then he forgot her in the approach to Richmond, the town where much of his youth had been spent. The absence of his mother from the capital was the only regret in this happy homecoming, but he had received a letter from her assuring him of her arrival in the city in a day or two.  When they reached Richmond the woman in the brown cloak left the car before him, but he saw her entering the office of the Provost-Marshal, where all passes were examined with minute care, every one who came to the capital in those times of war being considered an enemy until proved a friend. Prescott saw then that she was not only tall, but very tall, and that she walked with a strong, graceful step. \"After all, her figure may be good,\" he thought, revising his recent opinion.  Her pass was examined, found to be correct, and she left the office before his own time came. He would have asked the name on her pass, but aware that the officer would probably tell him to mind his own business, he refrained, and then forgot her in the great event of his return home after so long a time of terrible war. He took his way at once to Franklin Street, where he saw outspread before him life as it was lived in the capital of the Confederate States of America. It was to him a spectacle, striking in its variety and refreshing in its brilliancy, as he had come, though indirectly, from the Army of Northern Virginia, where it was the custom to serve half-rations of food and double rations of gunpowder. Therefore, being young, sound of heart and amply furnished with hope, he looked about him and rejoiced.  Richmond was a snug little town, a capital of no great size even in a region then lacking in city growth, but for the time more was said about it and more eyes were turned upon it than upon any other place in the world. Many thousands of men were dying in an attempt to reach this small Virginia city, and many other thousands were dying in an equally strenuous effort to keep them away.  Such thoughts, however, did not worry Prescott at this moment. His face was set resolutely toward the bright side of life, which is really half the battle, and neither the damp nor the cold was able to take from him the good spirits that were his greatest treasure. Coming from the bare life of a camp and the somber scenes of battlefields, he seemed to have plunged into a very whirlwind of gaiety, and his eyes sparkled with appreciation. He did not notice then that his captain's uniform was stained and threadbare enough to make him a most disreputable figure in a drawing-room, however gallant he might appear at the head of a forlorn hope.  The street was crowded, the pressure of the armies having driven much of the life of the country into the city, and Prescott saw men, women and children passing, some in rich and some in poor attire. He saw ladies, both young and old, bearing in their cheeks a faint, delicate bloom, the mark of the South, and he heard them as they spoke to each other in their soft, drawling voices, which reminded him of the waters of a little brook falling over a precipice six inches high.  It is said that soldiers, after spending a year or two in the serious business of slaying each other, look upon a woman as one would regard a divinity--a being to be approached with awe and respect; and such emotions sprang into the heart of Prescott when he glanced into feminine faces, especially youthful ones. Becoming suddenly conscious of his rusty apparel and appearance, he looked about him in alarm. Other soldiers were passing, some fresh and trim, some rusty as himself, but a great percentage of both had bandaged limbs or bodies, and he found no consolation in such company, wishing to appear well, irrespective of others.  He noticed many red flags along the street and heard men calling upon the people in loud, strident voices to come and buy. At other places the grateful glow of coal fires shone from half-opened doorways, and the faint but positive click of ivory chips told that games of chance were in progress.  \"Half the population is either buying something or losing something,\" he said to himself.  A shout of laughter came from one of the open doorways beyond which men were staking their money, and a voice, somewhat the worse for a liquid not water, sang:      \"Little McClellan sat eating a melon     The Chickahominy by;     He stuck in his spade,     Then a long while delayed,     And cried: 'What a brave general am I!'\"  \"I'll wager that you had nothing to do with driving back McClellan,\" thought Prescott, and then his mind turned to that worn army by the Rapidan, fighting with such endurance, while others lived in fat ease here in Richmond.  Half a dozen men, English in face and manner and rolling in their walk like sailors, passed him. He recognized them at once as blockade runners who had probably come up from Wilmington to sell their goods for a better price at the capital. While wondering what they had brought, his attention was distracted by one of the auctioneers, a large man with a red face and tireless voice.  \"Come buy! Come buy!\" he cried. \"See this beautiful new uniform of the finest gray, a sample of a cargo made in England and brought over five days ago on a blockade runner to Wilmington.\"  Looking around in"]]]
