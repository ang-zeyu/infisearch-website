The interior showed evident signs of a late debauch.  There was a rough table in the centre covered with tobacco-ashes, a broken black cutty, or pipe, some battered tin mugs, and a couple of empty spirit bottles on their sides, while under it lay a couple of men fast asleep, and another in the corner. Some kicks from the shoe of their more sober companion, who had brought the newly arrived party in, roused them up; and he then proceeded to eject them, telling them to go to Bateman's hut, where they would find shelter.  Grumbling, they staggered out, except two, who were too far gone to move.  The hut was, as might have been expected, in a very dirty and untidy condition--so dirty, indeed, that the Gilpins were contemplating camping outside, when Larry, going out, reported that a storm was brewing, and proceeded forthwith to bring the contents of the cart inside.  A plentiful though roughly cooked supper was soon on the table to which all hands did ample justice.  The hut was a long, narrow building, with the entrance door towards one end, where the mud-built fireplace was formed and the table stood.  In the further end were some bunks, or standing bed-places, and the stores were piled up.  Larry placed the articles he had brought in the cart across the hut, so as more effectually to screen off the inner end.  He and the hut-keeper, whom he addressed as Jonas Knoll, appeared to be old acquaintances, but very few words passed between them.  For the first time since they had landed, the Gilpins lay down to rest with a feeling that they were not as safe as they would have been in their own home in England.  Before Larry lay down, after the hut-keeper had gone to sleep, they observed that he put fresh grease into the lamp and trimmed the wick. More than once James awoke and looked around; everybody in the hut appeared to be sleeping soundly.  The two stockmen and the hut-keeper especially were snoring loudly, and not a sound from the outside was heard.  \"It is wrong to be giving way to fear,\" he said to himself. \"These coarse fellows have been indulging, according to their tastes, in a debauch, and were annoyed at being interrupted.  They would scarcely dare to harm us even if they wished it.  We must keep a tight rein on them and a careful watch on their proceedings, without allowing them to discover that they are especially observed, and we shall do well.\"  The next morning the hut-keepers and stockmen belonging to the headquarters of the station made their appearance, sobered, and tolerably respectful in their manner; though there was an expression in their eyes and a tone in their voices which made the young managers believe that it would take but little to make them break out into open mutiny.  They were, however, surprised at Larry's changed manner.  There was an impudent swagger in all he did, and when ordered to perform any duty, he invariably replied in a way which made his companions laugh, though he executed the order with promptness.  He seemed to be on familiar terms with all the people on the station, and to be a favourite among them.  The brothers at once saw that there was much to do, and many alterations to be made in every direction about the station.  The huts were in a dilapidated condition--the one intended for their residence was so dirty as to be scarcely habitable; the stock-yards required repair; and, worse than all, the books were so badly kept that it was almost impossible to ascertain the number and state of the stock, either of cattle, sheep, or horses, or of the stores.  The overseer was absent--gone to a distant run--so they took possession of the books, which had been left carelessly out, with the intention of verifying them with the actual state of things.  Having made the necessary extracts, they locked them up and started on horseback, accompanied by Sam, whose practised eye was likely to prove of great assistance in numbering the flocks of sheep and herds of cattle which were to be inspected.  They had not made their intention known, and, just as they were starting, they summoned the most civil-looking of the stockmen, and ordered him to mount his horse and accompany them as a guide.  As every flock is named, they had no difficulty in indicating the flock they wished to visit; but they did not tell him till they had got some way from the station, so that he would have no opportunity of communicating with his companions should he suspect their designs.  Arrived at a run, they immediately called the shepherd, and ordered him to make his flock pass before them, when they took careful note of their numbers, appearance, and general condition.  Having done so, they put spurs to their horses and galloped off to the next run.  As they had a pocket compass and had been furnished with a rough map of the country, they had no difficulty in assuring themselves that their guide was conducting them aright.  The shepherds and stock-keepers looked puzzled, and as not a single remark of approval or disapproval was uttered, they could not make up their minds how to proceed.  Several of them would have given much to peep into the notebook which those quiet-looking young men held in their hands.  Refreshing themselves and their steeds at a stock-keeper's hut, they returned home late in the evening, satisfied that a large amount of rascality had been going forward, and that it would require great judgment and determination on their part to put matters to right.  The next day and the following were employed in the same manner.  Each day confirmed them more and more in their opinion.  For the present, however, they could only watch the proceedings of the men under them. They could not dismiss the whole of them, nor could they ascertain who were the most guilty.  That the overseer was a great scoundrel they had no doubt, and they therefore agreed that he must at once be got rid of. James had written an account of the state of things to Mr Prentiss, but doubted whether to entrust it to Larry Killock, who had so completely identified himself with the other men, that they thought it probable he might give it to them to read, and so put them on their guard.  They were still in this state of doubt when the time arrived for Larry to take his departure.  They were sitting in the hut at supper, the work of the day over, no one but Sam being near, when the Irishman put his head in at the door.  Looking round, and assuring himself that they were the only occupants of the building, he approached them with his former civil manner.  \"It's all pretence, yer honours,\" he whispered, with his hand to his nose.  \"They're big rascals, every mother's son of them; and I'd give my right hand to be allowed to stop, if I thought that they'd be doing you any mischief; but I don't think they'll dare to work you harm.  The worst of them hasn't come yet, and when he does, he'll try to make you believe that he's the most honest man alive.  But, whist, there's some one coming.  If you'd have the goodness to kick me out of the hut, and call me an impudent thief of the world, it would keep up appearances.\"  The brothers heartily thanked the Irishman; but were not obliged to fulfil his last request, as he managed to run out of the hut before any one appeared.  The following evening, while they were sitting as before, at supper, a horse's hoofs were heard approaching, and soon afterwards a man of middle age, dressed in the usual rough costume of the bush, unceremoniously entered the hut, and, eyeing them with a scrutinising glance, drew up a stool and seated himself at the table.  \"The new managers, I presume, Mr --- I beg your pardon--I forget your name,\" he began, in a supercilious tone.  \"You have stolen a march on me, and I conclude that I am to be superseded.\"  \"That probably will not rest with us,\" said James.  \"I suppose that if the trustees of the property find that we can manage it to their satisfaction without help, they will not consider themselves justified in retaining your services.\"  The overseer, Mr Basham, as he was called, was very unlike the person they expected to see.  The shape of his features was remarkably good, though the expression was unsatisfactory; his figure was light and wiry, and capable of enduring considerable fatigue; and his manners were those of a gentleman, marred somewhat by rough companions and the hard life he had led.  He saw at once that the young men with whom he had to deal, though inferior to him in knowledge of the world, possessed an uprightness and firmness of character with which he could not trifle. He would much have liked to have entrapped them by offering them a share of his profits, but that plan, it was evident, would not answer with them.  Still he trusted that some way might be found of securing what he had obtained, if not for making more.  \"Well, well, gentlemen, I have always been an unfortunate person, and so we'll drop the subject, and discuss what is taking place in the great world.\"  Without more ado he did turn the subject, and showed that he was a man of considerable information, and had received a superior education. This only made him the more difficult to deal with.  Though he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21464"],["title","The Gilpins and their Fortunes: A Story of Early Days in Australia (#6)"],["body","now free, they suspected strongly that he had been a convict.  They could scarcely believe that with his abilities he would not otherwise have been employed in some higher position.  After their inspection of the runs, they had been engaged for a day in turning everything out of the hut, and in having it thoroughly cleansed.  They then re-arranged the furniture and contents, according to their own taste.  For several days after Mr Basham's return they saw him hunting about the hut in search of something, and at last he asked them if they had seen his books. James at once replied that he had, according to the direction of the trustees, taken possession of them, and should keep them till he received directions to the contrary.  He shrugged his shoulders as he observed, \"My hard fate again!  And so, I suppose, if anything goes wrong, those books are to be brought as evidence against me, though I may be as innocent as the babe unborn.\"  There was a sinister expression in his countenance as he spoke, of which he was probably unaware, but which convinced the young managers that they must be careful how they dealt with him till they could receive authority from Sydney to dismiss him.  In spite of all their vigilance and activity, things continued to go on wrong.  Sheep disappeared, carried off by dingoes, or by the native blacks; the shepherds asserted that cattle strayed, and could not be recovered; and two valuable horses, intended to be sent to Sydney, for shipment to India, were missing.  More than once the brothers were inclined to wish that they had commenced as squatters on their own account in a small way, with only a few honest men around them; yet, having undertaken their present task, they were not the men to shrink from it.  They came to the determination, however, not to embark any of their own small capital till they had got everything to rights, and men under them in whom they could place confidence.  At length the looked-for authority arrived to dismiss, not only Mr Basham, but any of the men who might behave ill, or be suspected of malpractices; it being suggested that, as trustworthy men were difficult to procure, it would be injudicious to proceed on light grounds, at the same time, as proof positive would in many cases be impossible, it would not be necessary to wait till it was found.  This was throwing a large amount of responsibility on their shoulders, but they determined to do their duty. Mr Basham received his dismissal with great coolness; but again his features assumed the expression the Gilpins had before observed.  He claimed as his own a couple of fine horses, and, placing his personal property on one of these and bestriding the other, early the next morning he rode off, the last glance of his cold, grey eye leaving an impression which for many a day remained fixed on the minds of the brothers.    CHAPTER FOUR.  The Gilpins found that the superintendence of a large station did not afford a bed of roses.  All day long they were in the saddle, overlooking twenty stockmen and shepherds, examining the herds and flocks, and often themselves doctoring any which were found diseased or injured.  This they were obliged to do, in consequence of the ignorance or carelessness of the people in charge of them.  These, with few exceptions, had been convicts.  Of those who had been convicts, some were still working out their sentences with tickets-of-leave, while others, who were free to go where they liked, were too old and destitute of energy to venture on a change of occupation, and remained as before, hut-keepers or shepherds.  At each inferior station there was a hut with a hut-keeper, whose duty was to look after the hut, to cook the provisions, and to tend the sheep or cattle brought for any special purpose into the fold or pen.  The office was usually held by some old convict or other person unfit for hard labour.  Though occasionally there is enough to do, it is considered an idle, lazy life.  The brothers often rode together to the stations, to assist each other; but they had lately, for the sake of covering more ground in the course of the day, taken separate districts, that the stockmen might be kept constantly on the alert, not knowing any moment when the active young managers might pay them a visit.  Notwithstanding this, cattle and sheep continued to disappear as before, and they came to the resolution of making every man responsible who lost an animal, and stopping his wages till it was replaced.  One day, after a hard morning's work, Arthur Gilpin found himself approaching the rear of a hut, on an out station, at the extreme end of the territory over which the cattle ranged--the whole being considerably larger than many a German principality.  The ground was soft, and his horse's hoofs making no noise, it was not till he got in front of the hut that the dog, ever found as its guardian (either well-bred deer-hound or cur of low degree), came bounding up towards him, barking loudly.  In this case the animal was a remarkably handsome deer-hound, of a size and strength sufficient to drag him from his horse.  The hut-keeper was seated in a rough sort of easy-chair, and was apparently fast asleep.  \"Hillo, my man, call off your dog, or he and I may do each other an injury,\" shouted Arthur; \"he is a noble brute, and I should not like to hurt him, if I could help it!\"  The man started up, a book dropping from his hand.  \"Come back, good Brian; come back, sir!\" he cried out.  \"I must apologise, Mr Gilpin, for not hearing you; but I was overcome, I believe, by the heat,\" he added, as he took the horse from which Arthur had just dismounted.  As the stock-keeper unsaddled the animal, Arthur's eye fell on the open page of the book from which he had been reading.  It was a superior edition of Horace, well used.  Roughly clad and unshorn and haggard in his looks as the man was, Arthur could not but conclude that he had once moved among the educated classes of society.  The ever-ready damper and pot of tea were produced; and Arthur, having satisfied his appetite, made the usual inquiries about the station.  Everything seemed to be satisfactory.  \"You appear to be fond of reading,\" said Arthur, glancing at the Horace, which had been placed on a shelf among a few other books.  \"Ah! a friend of my early days.  He serves to beguile many a weary hour,\" answered the hut-keeper, with a sigh.  Arthur did not like to ask questions.  \"We brought a few books with us into the bush; I shall be glad to lend them to you,\" he said.  \"They will be most acceptable, sir,\" said the hut-keeper, his countenance brightening; \"my own stock is small, and I have read each volume over and over again till I know them by heart.  I believe that if a chest of new books were to reach me, like the half-starved wretch who suddenly finds himself in the midst of plenty, I could sit down and read till my eyesight or my wits had left me.\"  \"I can enter into your feelings,\" said Arthur kindly.  \"The life you lead must indeed be dull.\"  \"Ah! it might be far worse, though,\" answered the hut-keeper; \"poverty out here can scarcely be said to pinch.  I often ask myself what might it have been, or what certainly would it have been, had I remained in London till my last shilling was gone.  To rot in a poorhouse or to sweep a crossing would have been my lot, or there might have been a worse alternative.  I had enough left to pay my passage out here.  It was a wise move--the only wise thing I ever did in my life.  My expectations on landing were foolish, and before I could realise them I had the chance of going to gaol or becoming a hut-keeper.\"  The last remarks were made as he stood holding the rein of Arthur's horse.  Arthur rode round the run, inspected the flock, and had to pass near the hut again on his return homeward.  The hut-keeper, Charles Craven he called himself, was on the watch for him.  \"I must have a word with you, Mr Gilpin,\" he said.  \"You are the first man I have met since I landed on these shores who has sympathised with me.  I would do something to serve you.  First, I must warn you never to be unarmed, either in your hut or out of it; and especially advise you and your brother, when you ride out, always to keep together.  Many of the hands on the station are exasperated with you for your style of proceeding, and they think that if they could get rid of you they would have things their own way.\"  Thanking Craven for his advice, Arthur pushed on towards home as rapidly as his grey would carry him.  He was relieved on finding that James had just before arrived.  He told his brother of the warning Craven had given him.  James was at first inclined to laugh at it.  \"The scoundrels dare not injure us!\" he exclaimed.  Then he remembered Basham's revengeful looks, and the surly manner of several of the hands, and finally agreed with his brother that it would be wiser to go armed, and keep together.  They had removed the hut-keeper to another post, and placed Green in charge of their abode.  This would have been necessary, if for no other reason, for the purpose of having it kept clean and habitable, which the dirty habits of the former occupant rendered impracticable.  The exact situation of the hut has not been described.  It stood on a hillside, the ground immediately round it cleared, but with bush both above it and on either side, extending to a considerable distance.  In some places the trees were fine and lofty, in others only stringy-bark or low bushes.  A river passed in front at the distance of less than a quarter of a mile, full and flowing in winter, but after the heats of summer consisting of a succession of water-holes connected by a trickling rill. During the shearing season the river was a scene of the greatest animation, as all the flocks from far and near were driven up to it, that the sheep might be washed before being deprived of their fleeces. After a sudden downfall of rain, the quiet stream became a roaring, "]]]
