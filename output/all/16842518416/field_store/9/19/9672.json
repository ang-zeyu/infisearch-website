Merely selecting a position, therefore, for my chest, and leaving to the wretched lad, whom adverse fortune had made the attendant of the place, the task of lashing it down, I hastened on deck again, and presenting myself once more before the first lieutenant, announced that I was now ready to execute any commission with which he might be pleased to intrust me.  \"Very well,\" said he.  \"I want you to take the gig and proceed on board the _Saint George_ with this letter for the first lieutenant of that ship.  Wait for an answer, and if he gives you a parcel be very careful how you handle it, as it will contain articles of a very fragile character which must on no account be damaged or broken.\"  The gig was thereupon piped away, and when she was in the water and her crew in her I proceeded in my most stately manner down the side and flung myself in an easily negligent attitude into the stern-sheets.  I felt at that moment exceedingly well satisfied with myself.  I had joined the ship but a bare half-hour before; yet here I was, singled out from the rest of the midshipmen as the fittest person to be intrusted with an evidently important mission.  I forgot not only my father's caution against vanity but also my sorrow at parting with him; my _amour propre_ rose triumphant above every other feeling; the disagreeable lump in my throat subsided, and with an unconscious, but no doubt very ludicrous, assumption of condescending authority, I gave the order to--  \"Shove off, and get the muslin upon her, and see that you crack on, coxswain, for I am in a hurry.\"  \"Ay, ay, sir,\" returned that functionary in a very respectful tone of voice.  \"Step the mast, for'ard there, you sea-dogs, `and get the muslin on her.'\"  With a broad grin, whether at the verbatim repetition of my order, or in consequence of some pantomimic gesture on the part of the coxswain, who was behind me--I had a sudden painful suspicion that it might possibly be _both_--the men sprang to obey the order; and in another instant the mast was stepped, the halliard and tack hooked on, the sheet led aft, and the sail was all ready for hoisting.  \"What d'ye say, Tom; shall us take down a reef!\" asked one of the men.  \"Reef?  No, certingly not.  Didn't you hear the gentleman say as how we was to `crack on' because he's in a hurry?  Give her whole canvas,\" replied the coxswain.  With a shivering flutter and a sudden violent jerk the sail was run up; and, careening gunwale-to, away dashed the lively boat toward the harbour.  It was blowing fresh and squally from the eastward, and for the first mile of our course there was a nasty choppy sea for a boat.  The men flung their oil-skins over their shoulders, and ranging themselves along the weather side of the boat, seated themselves on the bottom-boards, and away we went, jerk-jerking through it, the sea hissing and foaming past us to leeward, and the spray flying in a continuous heavy shower in over the weather-bow and right aft, drenching me through and through in less than five minutes.  \"I'm afeard you're gettin' rayther wet, sir,\" remarked the coxswain feelingly when I had just about arrived at a condition of complete saturation; \"perhaps you'd better have my oil-skin, sir.\"  \"No, thanks,\" I replied, \"I am very comfortable as I am.\"  This was, to put it mildly, a perversion of the truth.  I was _not_ very comfortable; I was wet to the skin, and my bran-new uniform, upon which I so greatly prided myself, was just about ruined.  But it was then too late for the oil-skin to be of the slightest benefit to me; and, moreover, I did not choose that those men should think I cared for so trifling a matter as a wetting.  But a certain scarcely-perceptible ironical inflection in the coxswain's voice, when he so kindly offered me the use of his jumper, suggested the suspicion that perhaps he was quietly amusing himself and his shipmates at my expense, and that the drenching I had received was due more to his management of the boat than anything else, so I set myself quietly to watch.  I soon saw that my suspicion was well-founded.  The rascal, instead of easing the boat and meeting the heavier seas as he ought to have done, was sailing the craft at top speed right through them, varying the performance occasionally by keeping the boat broad away when a squall struck her, causing her to careen until her gunwale went under, and as a natural consequence shipping a great deal of water.  At length he rather overdid it, a squall striking the boat so heavily that before he could luff and shake the wind out of the sail she had filled to the thwarts.  I thought for a moment that we were over, and so did the crew of the boat, who jumped to their feet in consternation. Being an excellent swimmer myself, however, I managed to perfectly retain my _sang-froid_, whilst I also recognised in the mishap an opportunity to take the coxswain down a peg or two.  Lifting my legs, therefore, coolly up on the side seat out of reach of the water, I said:  \"How long have you been a sailor, coxswain?\"  \"Nigh on to seven year, sir.  Now then, lads, dowse the sail smartly and get to work with the bucket.\"  \"Seven years, have you?\"  I returned placidly.  \"Then you _ought_ to know how to sail a boat by this time.  I have never yet been to sea; but I should be ashamed to make such a mess of it as this.\"  To this my friend in the rear vouchsafed not a word in reply, but from that moment I noticed a difference in the behaviour of the men all round.  They found they had not got quite the greenhorn to deal with that they had first imagined.  When at last the boat was freed of the water and sail once more made upon her, I remarked to the coxswain:  \"Now, Tom--if that is your name--you have amused yourself and your shipmates at my expense--to your heart's content, I hope--you have played off your little practical joke upon me, and I bear no malice. But--let there be no more of it--do you understand?\"  \"Ay ay, sir; I underconstumbles,\" was the reply; \"and I'm right sorry now as I did it, sir, and I axes your parding, sir; that I do.  Dash my buttons, though, but you're a rare plucky young gentleman, you are, sir, though I says it to your face.  And I hopes, sir, as how you won't bear no malice again' me for just tryin' a bit to see what sort o' stuff you was made of, as it were?\"  I eased the poor fellow's mind upon this point, and soon afterwards we arrived alongside the _Saint George_.  I found the first lieutenant, and duly handed over my despatch, which he read with a curious twitching about the corners of the mouth.  Having mastered the contents, he retired below, asking me to wait a minute or two.  At that moment my attention was attracted to a midshipman in the main rigging, who, with exaggerated deliberation, was making his unwilling way aloft to the mast-head as it turned out.  A certain familiar something about the young gentleman caused me to look up at him more attentively; and I then at once recognised my recent acquaintance, Lord Fitz-Johnes.  At the same moment the second lieutenant, who was eyeing his lordship somewhat wrathfully, hailed him with:  \"Now then, Mr Tomkins, are you going to be all day on your journey? Quicken your movements, sir, or I will send a boatswain's mate after you with a rope's-end to freshen your way.  Do you hear, sir?\"  \"Ay ay, sir,\" responded the _ci-devant_ Lord Fitz-Johnes--now plain Mr Tomkins--in a squeaky treble, as he made a feeble momentary show of alacrity.  Just then I caught his eye, and, taking off my hat, made him an ironical bow of recognition, to which he responded by pressing his body against the rigging--pausing in his upward journey to give due effect to the ceremony--spreading his legs as widely apart as possible, and extending both hands toward me, the fingers outspread, the thumb of the right hand pressing gently against the point of his nose, and the thumb of the left interlinked with the right-hand little finger.  This salute was made still more impressive by a lengthened slow and solemn twiddling of the fingers, which was only brought to an end by the second lieutenant hailing:  \"Mr Tomkins, you will oblige me by prolonging your stay at the mast- head until the end of the afternoon watch, if you please.\"  As the answering \"Ay ay, sir,\" came sadly down from aloft, I felt a touch on my arm, and, turning round, found my second acquaintance, Lord Tomnoddy, by my side.  As I looked at him I felt strongly inclined to ask him whether _he_ also had changed his name since our last meeting.  \"Oh, look here, Hawksbill,\" he commenced, \"I'm glad you've come on board; I wanted to see you in order that I might repay you the sovereign you lent us the other day.  Here it is,\"--selecting the coin from a handful which he pulled out of his breeches pocket and thrusting it into my hand--\"and I am very much obliged to you for the loan.  I _really_ hadn't a farthing in my pocket at the time, or I wouldn't have allowed Tomkins to borrow it from you--and it was awfully stupid of me to let you go away without saying where I could send it to you.\"  \"Pray do not say anything further about it, Mr --, Mr --.\"  \"I am Lord Southdown, at your service--_not_ Lord Tomnoddy, as my whimsical friend Tomkins dubbed me the other day.  It is perfectly true,\" he added somewhat haughtily, and then with a smile resumed: \"but I suppose I must not take offence at your look of incredulity, seeing that I was a consenting party to that awful piece of deception which Tomkins played off upon you.  Ha, ha, ha! excuse me, but I really wish you could have seen yourself when that mischievous friend of mine accused you of--of--what was it?  Oh, yes, of playing fast and loose with the affections of the fictitious Lady Sara, or whatever the fellow called her.  And then "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21060"],["title","The Congo Rovers: A Story of the Slave Squadron (#6)"],["body","again, when he remarked upon your extraordinary resemblance to Lord--Somebody--another fictitious friend of his, and directed attention to your `lofty intellectual forehead, your proud eagle-glance, your--' oh, dear! it was _too_ much.\"  And off went his lordship into another paroxysm of laughter, which sent the tears coursing down his cheeks and caused me to flush most painfully with mortification.  \"Upon my word, Hawksbill--\" he commenced.  \"My name is Hawkesley, my lord, at your service,\" I interrupted, somewhat angrily I am afraid.  \"I beg your pardon, Mr Hawkesley; the mistake was a perfectly genuine and unintentional one, I assure you.  I was going to apologise--as I _do_, most heartily, for laughing at you in this very impertinent fashion.  But, my dear fellow, let me advise you as a friend to overcome your very conspicuous vanity.  I am, perhaps, taking a most unwarrantable liberty in presuming to offer you advice on so delicate a subject, or, indeed, in alluding to it at all; but, to tell you the truth, I have taken rather a liking for you in spite of--ah--ahem--that is--I mean that you struck me as being a first-rate fellow notwithstanding the little failing at which I have hinted.  You are quite good enough every way to pass muster without the necessity for any attempt to clothe yourself with fictitious attributes of any kind.  Of course, in the ordinary run of events you will soon be laughed out of your weakness--there is no place equal to a man-of-war for the speedy cure of that sort of thing--but the process is often a very painful one to the patient--I have passed through it myself, so I can speak from experience--so _very_ painful was it to me that, even at the risk of being considered impertinent, I have ventured to give you a friendly caution, in the hope that your good sense will enable you to profit by it, and so save you many a bitter mortification.  Now I _hope_ I have not offended you?\"  \"By no means, my lord,\" I replied, grasping his proffered hand.  \"On the contrary, I am very sincerely obliged to you--\"  At this moment the first lieutenant of the _Saint George_ reappeared on deck, and coming up to me with Mr Austin's letter open in his hand, said:  \"My friend Mr Austin writes me that you are quite out of eggs on board the _Daphne_, and asks me to lend him a couple of dozen.\"  (Here was another take-down for me; the important despatch with which I--_out of all the midshipmen on board_--had been intrusted was simply a request for the loan of two dozen eggs!) \"He sends to me for them instead of procuring them from the shore, because he is afraid you may lose some of your boat's crew.\"  (Evidently Mr Austin had not the high opinion of me that I fondly imagined he had.) \"I am sorry to say I cannot oblige Mr Austin; but I think we can overcome the difficulty if you do not mind being delayed a quarter of an hour or so.  I have a packet which I wish to send ashore, and if you will give Lord Southdown here--who seems to be a friend of yours--a passage to the Hard and off again, he will look after your boat's crew for you whilst you purchase your eggs.\"  I of course acquiesced in this proposal; whereupon Lord Southdown was sent into the captain's cabin for the packet in question; and on his reappearance a few minutes later we jumped into the boat and went ashore together, his lordship regaling me on the way with sundry entertaining anecdotes whereof his humorous friend Tomkins was the hero.  We managed to execute our respective errands without losing any of the boat's crew; and duly putting Lord Southdown on board the _Saint George_ again, I returned triumphantly to the _Daphne_ with my consignment of eggs and handed them over intact to Mr Austin.  After which I dived below, just in time to partake of the first dinner provided for me at the expense of His Most Gracious Majesty George IV.  For the remainder of that day and during the whole of the next, until nearly ten o'clock at night, we were up to our eyes in the business of completing stores, etcetera, and, generally, in getting the ship ready for sea; and at daybreak on the second morning after I had joined, the fore-topsail was loosed, blue peter run up to the fore royal-mast head, the boats hoisted in and stowed, and the messenger passed, after which all hands went to breakfast.  At nine o'clock the captain's gig was sent on shore, and at 11 a.m. the skipper came off; his boat was hoisted up to the davits, the canvas loosed, the anchor tripped, and away we went down the Solent and out past the Needles, with a slashing breeze at east-south-east and every stitch of canvas set, from the topgallant studding-sails downwards.    CHAPTER FOUR.  A BOAT-EXCURSION INTO THE CONGO.  Our skipper's instructions were to the effect that he was, in the first instance, to report himself to the governor of Sierra Leone; and it was to that port, therefore, that we now made the best of our way.  The breeze with which we started carried us handsomely down channel and half-way across the Bay of Biscay, and the ship proving to be a regular flyer, everybody, from the skipper downwards, was in the very best of spirits.  Then came a change, the wind backing out from south-west with squally weather which placed us at once upon a taut bowline; and simultaneously with this change of weather a most disagreeable discovery was made, namely, that the _Daphne_ was an exceedingly crank ship.  However, we accomplished the passage in a little over three weeks; and after remaining at Sierra Leone for a few hours only, proceeded for the mouth of the Congo, off which we expected to fall in with the _Fawn_, which ship we had been sent out to relieve.  Proceeding under easy canvas, in the hope of picking up a prize by the way--in which hope, so however, we were disappointed--we reached our destination in twenty- three days from Sierra Leone; sighting the _Fawn_ at daybreak and closing with her an hour afterwards.  Her skipper came on board the _Daphne_ and remained to breakfast with Captain Vernon, whom--our skipper being a total stranger to the coast--he posted up pretty thoroughly in the current news, as well as such of the \"dodges\" of the slavers as he had happened to have picked up.  He said that at the moment there were no ships in the river, but that intelligence--whether trustworthy or no, however, he could not state--had reached him of the daily-expected arrival of three ships from Cuba.  He also confirmed a very extraordinary story which had been told our skipper by the governor of Sierra Leone, to the effect that large cargoes of slaves, known to have been collected on shore up the river, awaiting the arrival of the slavers, had from time to time disappeared in a most mysterious manner, at times when, as far as could be ascertained, no craft but men-o'-war were anywhere near the neighbourhood.  At noon the _Fawn_ filled away and bore up for Jamaica--whither she was to proceed preparatory to returning home to be paid off--her crew manning the rigging and giving us a parting cheer as she did so; and two hours later her royals dipped below the horizon, and we were left alone in our glory.  On parting from the _Fawn_ we filled away again upon the starboard tack, the wind being off the shore, and at noon brought the ship to an anchor in nine fathoms of water off Padron Point (the projecting headland on the southern side of the river's mouth) at a distance of two miles only from the shore.  The order was then given for the men to go to dinner as soon as that meal could be got ready; it being understood that, notwithstanding the _Fawn's_ assurance as to there being no ships in the river, our skipper intended to satisfy himself of that fact by actual examination.  Moreover, the deserted state of the river afforded us an excellent opportunity for making an unmolested exploration of it--making its acquaintance, so to speak, in order that at any future time, if occasion should arise, we might be able to make a dash into it without feeling that we were doing so absolutely blindfold.  At 1:30 p.m. the gig was piped away; Mr Austin being in charge, with me for an _aide_, all hands being fully armed.  The wind had by this time died away to a dead calm; the sun was blazing down upon us as if determined to roast us as we sat; and we had a long pull before us, for although the ship lay only two miles from the shore, we had to round a low spit, called, as Mr Austin informed me, Shark Point, six miles away, in a north-easterly direction, before we could be said to be fairly in the river.  For this point, then, away we stretched, the perspiration streaming from the men at every pore.  Fortunately the tide had begun to make before we started, and it was therefore in our favour.  We had a sounding-line with us, which we used at frequent intervals; and by its aid we ascertained that at a distance of one mile from the shore the shallowest water between the ship and Shark Point was about three and a half fathoms at low water.  This was at a spot distant some three and a half miles from the point.  Half a mile further on we suddenly deepened our water to forty-five fathoms; and at a distance of only a quarter of a mile from the point as we rounded it, the lead gave us fifteen fathoms, shortly afterwards shoaling to six fathoms, which depth was steadily maintained for a distance of eight miles up the river, the extent of our exploration on this occasion.  On our return journey we kept a little further off the shore, and found a corresponding increase in the depth of water; a result which fully satisfied us that we need have no hesitation about taking the _Daphne_ inside should it at any time seem desirable so to do.  Immediately abreast of Shark Point is an extensive creek named Banana Creek; and hereabouts the river is fully six miles wide.  On making out the mouth of this creek it was our first intention to have explored it; but on rounding the point and fairly entering the river, we made out"]]]
