Burns having fortunately       been rescued by his humble station from the contaminating society       of the “Best models,” wrote well and naturally from the first.       Had he been unfortunate enough to have had an educated taste, we       should have had a series of poems from which, as from his       letters, we could sift here and there a kernel from the mass of       chaff. Coleridge’s youthful efforts give no promise whatever of       that poetical genius which produced at once the wildest,       tenderest, most original and most purely imaginative poems of       modern times. Byron’s “Hours of Idleness” would never find a       reader except from an intrepid and indefatigable curiosity. In       Wordsworth’s first preludings there is but a dim foreboding of       the creator of an era. From Southey’s early poems, a safer augury       might have been drawn. They show the patient investigator, the       close student of history, and the unwearied explorer of the       beauties of predecessors, but they give no assurances of a man       who should add aught to stock of household words, or to the rarer       and more sacred delights of the fireside or the arbor. The       earliest specimens of Shelley’s poetic mind already, also, give       tokens of that ethereal sublimation in which the spirit seems to       soar above the regions of words, but leaves its body, the verse,       to be entombed, without hope of resurrection, in a mass of them.       Cowley is generally instanced as a wonder of precocity. But his       early insipidities show only a capacity for rhyming and for the       metrical arrangement of certain conventional combinations of       words, a capacity wholly dependent on a delicate physical       organization, and an unhappy memory. An early poem is only       remarkable when it displays an effort of _reason,_ and the rudest       verses in which we can trace some conception of the ends of       poetry, are worth all the miracles of smooth juvenile       versification. A school-boy, one would say, might acquire the       regular see-saw of Pope merely by an association with the motion       of the play-ground tilt.        Mr. Poe’s early productions show that he could see through the       verse to the spirit beneath, and that he already had a feeling       that all the life and grace of the one must depend on and be       modulated by the will of the other. We call them the most       remarkable boyish poems that we have ever read. We know of none       that can compare with them for maturity of purpose, and a nice       understanding of the effects of language and metre. Such pieces       are only valuable when they display what we can only express by       the contradictory phrase of _innate experience._ We copy one of       the shorter poems, written when the author was only fourteen.       There is a little dimness in the filling up, but the grace and       symmetry of the outline are such as few poets ever attain. There       is a smack of ambrosia about it.       TO HELEN  Helen, thy beauty is to me     Like those Nicean barks of yore, That gently, o’er a perfumed sea,     The weary, way-worn wanderer bore To his own native shore.  On desperate seas long wont to roam,     Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face, Thy Naiad airs have brought me home     To the glory that was Greece And the grandeur that was Rome.  Lo! in yon brilliant window-niche     How statue-like I see thee stand! The agate lamp within thy hand,     Ah! Psyche, from the regions which Are Holy Land!        It is the tendency of the young poet that impresses us. Here is       no “withering scorn,” no heart “blighted” ere it has safely got       into its teens, none of the drawing-room sansculottism which       Byron had brought into vogue. All is limpid and serene, with a       pleasant dash of the Greek Helicon in it. The melody of the       whole, too, is remarkable. It is not of that kind which can be       demonstrated arithmetically upon the tips of the fingers. It is       of that finer sort which the inner ear alone _can_ estimate. It       seems simple, like a Greek column, because of its perfection. In       a poem named “Ligeia,” under which title he intended to personify       the music of nature, our boy-poet gives us the following       exquisite picture:      Ligeia! Ligeia! My beautiful one,     Whose harshest idea Will to melody run,     Say, is it thy will, On the breezes to toss,     Or, capriciously still, Like the lone albatross,     Incumbent on night, As she on the air,     To keep watch with delight On the harmony there?        John Neal, himself a man of genius, and whose lyre has been too       long capriciously silent, appreciated the high merit of these and       similar passages, and drew a proud horoscope for their author.        Mr. Poe had that indescribable something which men have agreed to       call _genius_. No man could ever tell us precisely what it is,       and yet there is none who is not inevitably aware of its presence       and its power. Let talent writhe and contort itself as it may, it       has no such magnetism. Larger of bone and sinew it may be, but       the wings are wanting. Talent sticks fast to earth, and its most       perfect works have still one foot of clay. Genius claims kindred       with the very workings of Nature herself, so that a sunset shall       seem like a quotation from Dante, and if Shakespeare be read in       the very presence of the sea itself, his verses shall but seem       nobler for the sublime criticism of ocean. Talent may make       friends for itself, but only genius can give to its creations the       divine power of winning love and veneration. Enthusiasm cannot       cling to what itself is unenthusiastic, nor will he ever have       disciples who has not himself impulsive zeal enough to be a       disciple. Great wits are allied to madness only inasmuch as they       are possessed and carried away by their demon, while talent keeps       him, as Paracelsus did, securely prisoned in the pommel of his       sword. To the eye of genius, the veil of the spiritual world is       ever rent asunder that it may perceive the ministers of good and       evil who throng continually around it. No man of mere talent ever       flung his inkstand at the devil.        When we say that Mr. Poe had genius, we do not mean to say that       he has produced evidence of the highest. But to say that he       possesses it at all is to say that he needs only zeal, industry,       and a reverence for the trust reposed in him, to achieve the       proudest triumphs and the greenest laurels. If we may believe the       Longinuses and Aristotles of our newspapers, we have quite too       many geniuses of the loftiest order to render a place among them       at all desirable, whether for its hardness of attainment or its       seclusion. The highest peak of our Parnassus is, according to       these gentlemen, by far the most thickly settled portion of the       country, a circumstance which must make it an uncomfortable       residence for individuals of a poetical temperament, if love of       solitude be, as immemorial tradition asserts, a necessary part of       their idiosyncrasy.        Mr. Poe has two of the prime qualities of genius, a faculty of       vigorous yet minute analysis, and a wonderful fecundity of       imagination. The first of these faculties is as needful to the       artist in words, as a knowledge of anatomy is to the artist in       colors or in stone. This enables him to conceive truly, to       maintain a proper relation of parts, and to draw a correct       outline, while the second groups, fills up and colors. Both of       these Mr. Poe has displayed with singular distinctness in his       prose works, the last predominating in his earlier tales, and the       first in his later ones. In judging of the merit of an author,       and assigning him his niche among our household gods, we have a       right to regard him from our own point of view, and to measure       him by our own standard. But, in estimating the amount of power       displayed in his works, we must be governed by his own design,       and placing them by the side of his own ideal, find how much is       wanting. We differ from Mr. Poe in his opinions of the objects of       art. He esteems that object to be the creation of Beauty, and       perhaps it is only in the definition of that word that we       disagree with him. But in what we shall say of his writings, we       shall take his own standard as our guide. The temple of the god       of song is equally accessible from every side, and there is room       enough in it for all who bring offerings, or seek in oracle.        In his tales, Mr. Poe has chosen to exhibit his power chiefly in       that dim region which stretches from the very utmost limits of       the probable into the weird confines of superstition and       unreality. He combines in a very remarkable manner two faculties       which are seldom found united; a power of influencing the mind of       the reader by the impalpable shadows of mystery, and a minuteness       of detail which does not leave a pin or a button unnoticed. Both       are, in truth, the natural results of the predominating quality       of his mind, to which we have before alluded, analysis. It is       this which distinguishes the artist. His mind at once reaches       forward to the effect to be produced. Having resolved to bring       about certain emotions in the reader, he makes all subordinate       parts tend strictly to the common centre. Even his mystery is       mathematical to his own mind. To him X is a known quantity all       along. In any picture that he paints he understands the chemical       properties of all his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2147"],["title","The Works of Edgar Allan Poe — Volume 1 (#3)"],["body","ors. However vague some of his figures       may seem, however formless the shadows, to him the outline is as       clear and distinct as that of a geometrical diagram. For this       reason Mr. Poe has no sympathy with Mysticism. The Mystic dwells       in the mystery, is enveloped with it; it colors all his thoughts;       it affects his optic nerve especially, and the commonest things       get a rainbow edging from it. Mr. Poe, on the other hand, is a       spectator _ab extra_. He analyzes, he dissects, he watches      “with an eye serene,      The very pulse of the machine,”        for such it practically is to him, with wheels and cogs and       piston-rods, all working to produce a certain end.        This analyzing tendency of his mind balances the poetical, and by       giving him the patience to be minute, enables him to throw a       wonderful reality into his most unreal fancies. A monomania he       paints with great power. He loves to dissect one of these cancers       of the mind, and to trace all the subtle ramifications of its       roots. In raising images of horror, also, he has strange success,       conveying to us sometimes by a dusky hint some terrible _doubt_       which is the secret of all horror. He leaves to imagination the       task of finishing the picture, a task to which only she is       competent.       “For much imaginary work was there;      Conceit deceitful, so compact, so kind,      That for Achilles’ image stood his spear      Grasped in an armed hand; himself behind      Was left unseen, save to the eye of mind.”        Besides the merit of conception, Mr. Poe’s writings have also       that of form.        His style is highly finished, graceful and truly classical. It       would be hard to find a living author who had displayed such       varied powers. As an example of his style we would refer to one       of his tales, “The House of Usher,” in the first volume of his       “Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque.” It has a singular charm       for us, and we think that no one could read it without being       strongly moved by its serene and sombre beauty. Had its author       written nothing else, it would alone have been enough to stamp       him as a man of genius, and the master of a classic style. In       this tale occurs, perhaps, the most beautiful of his poems.        The great masters of imagination have seldom resorted to the       vague and the unreal as sources of effect. They have not used       dread and horror alone, but only in combination with other       qualities, as means of subjugating the fancies of their readers.       The loftiest muse has ever a household and fireside charm about       her. Mr. Poe’s secret lies mainly in the skill with which he has       employed the strange fascination of mystery and terror. In this       his success is so great and striking as to deserve the name of       art, not artifice. We cannot call his materials the noblest or       purest, but we must concede to him the highest merit of       construction.        As a critic, Mr. Poe was aesthetically deficient. Unerring in his       analysis of dictions, metres and plots, he seemed wanting in the       faculty of perceiving the profounder ethics of art. His       criticisms are, however, distinguished for scientific precision       and coherence of logic. They have the exactness, and at the same       time, the coldness of mathematical demonstrations. Yet they stand       in strikingly refreshing contrast with the vague generalisms and       sharp personalities of the day. If deficient in warmth, they are       also without the heat of partisanship. They are especially       valuable as illustrating the great truth, too generally       overlooked, that analytic power is a subordinate quality of the       critic.        On the whole, it may be considered certain that Mr. Poe has       attained an individual eminence in our literature which he will       keep. He has given proof of power and originality. He has done       that which could only be done once with success or safety, and       the imitation or repetition of which would produce weariness.     DEATH OF EDGAR A. POE   By N. P. Willis        The ancient fable of two antagonistic spirits imprisoned in one       body, equally powerful and having the complete mastery by       turns-of one man, that is to say, inhabited by both a devil and       an angel seems to have been realized, if all we hear is true, in       the character of the extraordinary man whose name we have written       above. Our own impression of the nature of Edgar A. Poe, differs       in some important degree, however, from that which has been       generally conveyed in the notices of his death. Let us, before       telling what we personally know of him, copy a graphic and highly       finished portraiture, from the pen of Dr. Rufus W. Griswold,       which appeared in a recent number of the “Tribune”:        “Edgar Allen Poe is dead. He died in Baltimore on Sunday, October       7th. This announcement will startle many, but few will be grieved       by it. The poet was known, personally or by reputation, in all       this country; he had readers in England and in several of the       states of Continental Europe; but he had few or no friends; and       the regrets for his death will be suggested principally by the       consideration that in him literary art has lost one of its most       brilliant but erratic stars.        “His conversation was at times almost supramortal in its       eloquence. His voice was modulated with astonishing skill, and       his large and variably expressive eyes looked repose or shot       fiery tumult into theirs who listened, while his own face glowed,       or was changeless in pallor, as his imagination quickened his       blood or drew it back frozen to his heart. His imagery was from       the worlds which no mortals can see but with the vision of       genius. Suddenly starting from a proposition, exactly and sharply       defined, in terms of utmost simplicity and clearness, he rejected       the forms of customary logic, and by a crystalline process of       accretion, built up his ocular demonstrations in forms of       gloomiest and ghastliest grandeur, or in those of the most airy       and delicious beauty, so minutely and distinctly, yet so rapidly,       that the attention which was yielded to him was chained till it       stood among his wonderful creations, till he himself dissolved       the spell, and brought his hearers back to common and base       existence, by vulgar fancies or exhibitions of the ignoblest       passion.        “He was at all times a dreamer dwelling in ideal realms in heaven       or hell peopled with the creatures and the accidents of his       brain. He walked the streets, in madness or melancholy, with lips       moving in indistinct curses, or with eyes upturned in passionate       prayer (never for himself, for he felt, or professed to feel,       that he was already damned, but) for their happiness who at the       moment were objects of his idolatry; or with his glances       introverted to a heart gnawed with anguish, and with a face       shrouded in gloom, he would brave the wildest storms, and all       night, with drenched garments and arms beating the winds and       rains, would speak as if the spirits that at such times only       could be evoked by him from the Aidenn, close by whose portals       his disturbed soul sought to forget the ills to which his       constitution subjected him—close by the Aidenn where were those       he loved—the Aidenn which he might never see, but in fitful       glimpses, as its gates opened to receive the less fiery and more       happy natures whose destiny to sin did not involve the doom of       death.        “He seemed, except when some fitful pursuit subjugated his will       and engrossed his faculties, always to bear the memory of some       controlling sorrow. The remarkable poem of ‘The Raven’ was       probably much more nearly than has been supposed, even by those       who were very intimate with him, a reflection and an echo of his       own history. _He_ was that bird’s      “‘Unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore— Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore     Of ‘Never—never more.’        “Every genuine author in a greater or less degree leaves in his       works, whatever their design, traces of his personal character:       elements of his immortal being, in which the individual survives       the person. While we read the pages of the ‘Fall of the House of       Usher,’ or of ‘Mesmeric Revelations,’ we see in the solemn and       stately gloom which invests one, and in the subtle metaphysical       analysis of both, indications of the idiosyncrasies of what was       most remarkable and peculiar in the author’s intellectual nature.       But we see here only the better phases of his nature, only the       symbols of his juster action, for his harsh experience had       deprived him of all faith in man or woman. He had made up his       mind upon the numberless complexities of the social world, and       the whole system with him was an imposture. This conviction gave       a direction to his shrewd and naturally unamiable character.       Still, though he regarded society as composed altogether of       villains, the sharpness of his intellect was not of that kind       which enabled him to cope with villany, while it continually       caused him by overshots to fail of the success of honesty. He was       in many respects like Francis Vivian in Bulwer’s novel of ‘The       Caxtons.’ Passion, in him, comprehended many of the worst       emotions which militate against human happiness. You could not       contradict him, but you raised quick choler; you could not speak       of wealth, but his cheek paled with gnawing"]]]
