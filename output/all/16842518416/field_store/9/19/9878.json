We ate the honey with a small supply of biscuit, and found it far more satisfactory food than the tough parrots had proved.  Having taken a last drink and filled up our waterbottles, we parted on friendly terms with the natives; when, saddling our horses, we continued our journey.  \"There is little chance of our reaching another river with more water in it than the last, to camp by,\" observed my brother; \"I see none marked down on the maps for leagues ahead.\"  We passed through the same sort of scenery as before, with the same dreary views on either side, so that we might have fancied that we had already crossed the country a dozen times.  We at length came to the bed of a stream, no longer however containing water, though I doubt not that we should have obtained it by digging beneath the surface.  The appearance of the bee-hunters had warned us that there were natives about, and we had been cautioned against trusting them.  We heard that they had at different times murdered a number of unfortunate hut-keepers and shepherds up the country, so that we were inclined to form very unfavourable opinions of the aborigines.  Toby, to be sure, was faithful enough, but then he was semi-civilised.  We now asked him if he thought that there were many natives in the neighbourhood to whom the bee-hunters belonged.  He shook his head--\"May be!\" he said; \"bad mans, keep out of him way.\"  This advice we were ready enough to adopt, and we had no fear, should we meet them on the open ground, of keeping them at bay; but we wished especially to avoid being caught asleep, either at night or resting during the noon-day heat.  We had, at this time, literally no experience about Australia.  We had read a few books, to be sure, but Mr Strong had not described the country, and only advised our father to send us out without incumbrances of any description--a small stock of serviceable clothes, a few books and a box of pills apiece.  We followed out his injunctions almost to the letter, adding only some well-made tools, a fowling-piece each, and a supply of ammunition, to which we added on our arrival a few necessaries for travelling in the bush.  Thus we found that one animal could carry all our worldly possessions, a few odd articles for immediate use being packed in our saddle-bags.  We were now, as the day was wearing on, looking out for a convenient place to camp.  We tried to make Toby understand that we wished for one in which we could not easily be surprised by natives, or if surprised, where we could defend ourselves with some hope of success.  The nature of the ground had changed since the morning, and we now entered a rocky and wild-looking district.  Here we should have no difficulty, we thought, in selecting a spot for our camp.  We were looking about, when we spied in the distance what appeared to be the figure of a man standing against a tree.  My brother instantly rode forward and I following him saw a person who, to all appearance, though in bush costume, was a gentleman, bound with his hands behind his back, and secured firmly to a tree.  He was deadly pale and seemed so much exhausted that he did not even speak to us as we approached.  To leap from our horses and release him without asking questions, was the work of a minute.  Having put him on his feet and waited until he had somewhat recovered, we inquired how he had been placed in the position in which we had found him.  \"Some rascally bushrangers surprised, and `stuck me up,'\" he answered. \"I had just dismounted, when three of them, who had been lying in ambush, suddenly sprang on me, and before I could draw my revolver, knocked me down.  \"I fully believed that they intended to murder me, but they contented themselves with carrying off my horse and arms and ammunition and everything I had about me; having lashed me to this tree, and then galloped away, leaving me to the chance of dying of thirst and starvation, or being gnawed to death by the dingoes.  Had you not come up, such might have been my fate; and, believe me, I am deeply grateful to you for rescuing me from it.\"  We had been aware of the possibility that we might meet with natives, but had not thought of the likelihood of encountering bushrangers, indeed we fancied that the country was no longer infested by such characters.  We, of course, having assured the stranger that we were very glad to have been of use to him, invited him to accompany us until he could obtain another horse, and offered to let him ride one of ours by turns.  \"I should like however to try and catch the fellows who robbed you;\" exclaimed Guy.  \"Is there any chance of overtaking them?  Surely they will encamp not far from this, and if we follow their tracks we might come upon them as suddenly as they surprised you.\"  \"Very little chance of that,\" observed the stranger.  \"They are desperate fellows, and, knowing that every man's hand is against them, keep a strict watch.  They are aware that it is possible that I might be released, and will probably ere this have got a good many miles away, I am, however, grateful to you for your offer, though I am sorry to delay you.  I confess that, without a gun or flint and steel, I should be very sorry to perform the rest of the journey on foot by myself.  I am going to the north-west, and I judge, from the direction you were riding, that our roads lie the same way.\"  Guy told him that we were bound for Mr Strong's station, which we understood was nearly a hundred miles off; and at the rate we could travel with our baggage-horse, we did not expect to reach it for three or four days.  Observing how ill the stranger looked I suggested that we should at once look out a good spot for camping.  \"I can help you, as I know the country,\" said the stranger.  \"A short distance further on there is a water-hole in what during the rainy season is sometimes a torrent; we can there obtain all the requisites for a camp.\"  I now insisted that he should mount my horse, and we set out.  Pushing forward, we soon reached the spot he spoke of.  Our new companion, after examining the ground, told us that the bushrangers had been there, and after watering their horses had ridden on, as he supposed they would, and that we need have no apprehensions of an attack from them.  We soon hobbled the horses in the usual fashion, fastening their legs together with leathern straps in such a way as to make it impossible for them to move beyond a slow walk, so that if they were inclined to stray they could not go far.  Toby quickly lighted a fire, while the stranger by our advice rested near it.  Guy and I taking our guns went out in different directions in search of game, which is usually to be found near a water-hole in Australia.  We soon came back, Guy with a brace of pigeons and I with three parrots, so that we had ample food for all hands.  As we had damper and tea, we enjoyed a satisfactory meal which greatly revived our new friend.  While we were seated round the fire--Toby watching the horses--the stranger inquired if we were related to Mr Strong.  This led us to give him a brief sketch of our history.  \"May I ask your name?\" he said.  \"Mine is Norman Bracewell.\"  \"And ours is Thurston,\" said my brother.  \"What!  Guy Thurston?\" exclaimed Bracewell, leaning forward and grasping Guy's hand; \"I thought from the first that I knew your features.  We were at school together. `Little Guy' we used to call you, and you haven't forgotten me?\"  \"No indeed!\" said Guy warmly, \"you always stood my friend when the big fellows tried to bully me, and I have a perfect recollection of your countenance.  I have often wished to know what had become of you, but could only hear that you had gone abroad.\"  \"I thought of writing to let you know, in case you should ever come out to Australia; but I fancied that that was so unlikely and the chances of meeting you so small that I did not carry out my intention.  You must stop at my hut.  The longer you stay the better.  We will have many a talk about old times and I think I can put you up to all sorts of information which will be useful to you in the country.  To tell you the truth, I doubt if you will find your cousin, Mr Strong, as I heard that he had gone northwards to occupy a new station, some hundreds of miles off, and if so you will probably find no one to give you a welcome at his house except some old hut-keeper.\"  On hearing this, Guy and I gladly agreed to stop a few days with Bracewell until we could obtain some definite information as to the movements of our cousin.  We told him of our meeting with the two bee-hunters.  \"This proves that there are some natives in the neighbourhood.  They may be honest, but they may also be ill-disposed, as are many of the blacks in this region.  I advise that we keep a strict watch at night, and I offer to stand guard part of the time,\" observed Bracewell.  We agreed to keep a watch, but after the trying time he had gone through we thought that he ought to have a quiet night's rest so as to be the better able to continue his journey the next morning.  Toby had put up a rough hut of boughs, which would afford two of us at a time sufficient shelter from the night air.  Of rain there was no fear. Toby erected a hut for himself with a few boughs stuck upright in the ground, which formed all the protection he required.  I undertook to keep the first watch, and I promised my brother that I would call him when I could no longer remain with my eyes open.  From past experience we knew that it would not do to trust Toby, who would be very certain to be down as soon as he found that our eyes were off him. Guy and Bracewell were quickly asleep and I commenced walking to and fro, keeping a look-out on every side and sometimes stopping to throw a few sticks on the fire.  I could see the horses safely feeding hear at hand, and so perfect was the silence which reigned "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21383"],["title","Adventures in Australia (#2)"],["body","that I could not fancy that there was any real necessity for keeping awake.  Still, as I had undertaken to do so, I should not have felt justified in lying down.  I should probably have let the fire out, and the smoke from that was at all events useful to keep mosquitoes and sandflies somewhat at bay.  Should the fire go out it was no more than possible that a pack of dingoes might creep up, and while we were in darkness drive the horses away, or carry off our saddle-bags, or tear our saddles and sleeping-rugs to pieces.  I persevered therefore, stopping every now and then to amuse myself by looking up at the star-lighted sky and trying to make out the various constellations, conspicuous among which was the brilliant cross of the southern hemisphere.  Except the occasional croak of a frog, the cry of a night bird, or the chirp of a cricket, not a sound had reached my ears; when suddenly, as I was watching the moon rising above the rocks on one side of the camp, the most unearthly shrieks and yells rent the air.  Guy, awakening, started to his feet.  \"What's the matter?\" he exclaimed.  \"I dreamed that savages were upon us, and expected the next moment to have a spear through me.\"  \"I haven't seen any savages, but those sounds seem scarcely human, I wonder Bracewell hasn't been awakened by them.  We must rouse up Toby and learn what he thinks they are.\"  The fearful noise still continued.  We stood with our arms ready expecting every moment to see a herd of savages rush in upon us, for that the sounds were produced by natives we could have no doubt.  We quickly made Toby spring to his feet.  \"What's all that noise about?\" asked Guy.  \"He-he-he, ho-ho-ho! dat corroborree,\" answered Toby who did not appear, as we expected would be the case, at all astonished at the uproar.  Bracewell at length awoke and confirmed what Toby had said, that the savages were indulging in one of their native dances.  \"I should like to go and see it,\" I exclaimed; \"can we do so without risk of being discovered?\"  Taking Toby to guide us, while Bracewell remained in camp, we set out. We were scarcely prepared for the strange and weird sight which we saw as we looked over some low bushes we had just reached.  Before us was an open glade, beyond which the moon was rising brightly.  In the centre of the glade burned a fire.  Seated on the ground were a number of figures rattling sticks together.  Suddenly there burst forth out of the darkness a score of skeleton-like figures who threw themselves into every possible attitude, now stretching out their legs, now springing up and clapping their hands, and all the time shrieking, laughing and singing, and following a big black fellow who acted as fugleman and stood on one side with stick in hand to direct the proceedings.  Not for a moment did they cease, though every now and then we might have fancied that they had disappeared had we not distinguished their black backs turned towards us.  We watched until we grew weary of the sight, but the dancers appeared in no way tired; and as we saw no chance of their giving in, we retreated to our own camp, pretty well tired out and assured that they would not molest us during the night.    CHAPTER TWO.  The night passed as Bracewell had predicted, without a visit from the natives; and as he assured us that they were not at all likely to attack four armed men in the day-time, we, being anxious to become better acquainted with them, agreed before setting off to pay a visit to their camp.  They were sure indeed to find ours out; so that it would be as well to show that we had no fear of them, and to gain their friendship. On examining the birds we had cooked the previous evening we found they had been nearly devoured by the white ants, a large nest of which we discovered a short distance from the camp.  We had therefore to look out for some fresh provisions.  Bracewell was a much better shot than either of us; and, taking my gun, in a few minutes he killed a small kangaroo which he found as it was about to spring out of the bush where it had spent the night, scarcely a hundred yards from the camp.  Having skinned it in the most scientific fashion, the joints were put on to roast.  We had now an abundance for our noon-day meal; for, as the animal was about four feet long, including the tail which was nearly half its length, it afforded us a good supply of meat.  We should have preferred starting at day-break, but without food we none of us felt inclined to commence our journey.  Toby indeed gave us to understand that he could not think of leaving while so much good meat remained to be eaten.  Having given him as much as we all three consumed, we packed up the remainder in our saddle-bags and then--I insisting that Bracewell should mount my horse while I walked--we set off for the native village which we caught sight of a short distance to the north of our camp.  The inhabitants were lying about in front of it, evidently enjoying the _otium cum dignitate_.  The men mostly stretched on the ground surrounded by their dogs, while the women were squatting outside their leafy bowers.  The huts, if so they can be called, were placed in a semi-circle, and were formed by thick boughs stuck in the ground joining at the top on which other boughs were lightly thrown.  They were scarcely more than four feet in height and might be described rather as screens than huts, as their only object appeared to be to keep off the wind from the inhabitants and the small fires which burnt before them.  On the outside were stuck their spears ready for instant use.  Except some pieces of opossum skin round their loins, the men wore no garments, though several of them had fillets bound round their brows.  Two or three were smoking short clay pipes obtained from shepherds or hut-keepers with whom they had come in contact.  Several of the men started up, and seizing their spears advanced as they saw us approach, but the greater number lay gorged with food on the ground, not apparently noticing us.  Bracewell, who could speak Toby's lingo, told him to say to the black fellows, that we wished to be their friends; that their corroborree had afforded us a good deal of amusement; and that if we could kill a kangaroo we would give it to them to make another feast the next night.  As soon as Toby had translated what had been said, the blacks began chattering away in the most extraordinary fashion.  As they ceased Toby informed us that they were highly pleased with our offer.  They wished to remain friends with the white men, and if we chose to stop with them we should be welcome.  Of course, we had no inclination to do this, but we asked if two or three of them would accompany us to carry home any game we might kill.  They however declined the invitation, saying that they were well filled already, of which fact their distended condition was sufficient evidence.  \"Well then, as we cannot turn back, you will have to go without a kangaroo, even though we may shoot one,\" said Bracewell, and telling Toby to wish them a friendly farewell we rode on.  As I was very active and had been accustomed to running at school, I easily kept up with the horses.  At length however, as the sun grew hotter, I should have been glad enough to remount.  Bracewell, observing that I was becoming fatigued, insisted on getting off his horse, but of this I would not hear.  He however dismounted, when Guy made him get on again and put me on his own horse.  Before long, however, my brother was nearly knocked up, and seeing this I proposed that he should remount, and that I should ride Toby's horse.  Toby made a wry face, for, although better able to run than any of us, he considered that it was more dignified to ride.  As we rode along we kept a look-out for kangaroos, as we should have been glad to kill one for ourselves, although our black friends were not likely to benefit by it.  We had gone some way when we caught sight of a dark object appearing just above a thick mass of leaves some two hundred yards away.  Standing up in my stirrups I saw that it was the head of a kangaroo who was engaged in pulling off the foliage.  I called to Bracewell and my brother, hoping that if we could get nearer before the creature moved away, we might shoot it.  Throwing the halter of the baggage-horse, which I had been leading, to Toby, I rode towards the spot, unslinging my rifle and as I did so ramming down a ball.  The creature was more wide-awake than I had supposed.  I had just got near enough to fire, when it broke from its cover in fine style and, after taking a few jumps to see in what direction to go, it started forward over the open ground without apparent effort.  \"That's a large _boomer_, an old one!\" shouted Bracewell, \"he'll give us a long run.  If we had dogs we should soon however catch him.\"  In the excitement of the chase, forgetting that we ran great risk of knocking up our horses, away we started.  Although the animal had only two legs to run on and had an enormous tail to carry, which does not, I really believe, help it, though it serves to balance itself in its upright position, so far did it get ahead of us that it was useless firing.  I had scarcely noticed the direction it was taking, but on looking round I found that it was leading us back to the spot from which we had come.  How far it had got I cannot say, when four or five black fellows started up with spears in their hands uttering loud shouts and shrieks.  The _boomer_ saw that it had no chance of escape in that direction, being perhaps better acquainted with its black enemies than with the strange creatures on four legs which had been pursuing it.  It therefore stopped and gave us time to approach before it bounded round and made off to the right.  I had thrown myself from my horse, for I had no notion at that time of firing from my saddle.  I took a steady aim and pulled the trigger.  My bullet must have hit it on the hinder leg, for it slackened"]]]
