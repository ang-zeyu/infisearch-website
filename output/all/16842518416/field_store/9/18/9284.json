A crowd of idle and flashily-dressed servants, all of whom were serfs, lounged about the new and stately palace, and found exhilarating amusement in setting their ferocious dogs upon the unoffending farmers who happened to pass that way. The greater the fear evinced by the victims, the greater was the delight of the humorously inclined menials, and if perchance a dog succeeded in fixing his fangs in the garments or calf of a pedestrian their mirth found vent in ecstatic shouts of laughter. Basilivitch had on more than one occasion been upon such errands as that which brought him to-day, and seemed on terms of familiarity with the liveried guardians of the palace. They obligingly called off their dogs, and at once announced the innkeeper to his excellency, General Drudkoff. The Governor had dined sumptuously and received his henchman graciously.  Stretching himself upon a sofa and lazily rolling a cigarette, he said:  \"Well, Basilivitch, what news do you bring? How fare my good subjects at Togarog?\"  \"I have bad news, your excellency,\" answered Basilivitch. \"My heart is sad at the information I have to impart. Insurrection is rife in our village, and not only your excellency, but also his majesty the Czar is in imminent danger.\"  The Governor sprang up from his couch, and his face became ashen white with fear. There was perhaps no man in all Russia more cruel, and at the same time more cowardly, than this General Drudkoff.  \"Explain yourself,\" he cried, at length recovering from his terror. \"What do you mean?\"  Thereupon the loyal Basilivitch began a recital of the events of the previous evening. Nor did he spare exaggeration where it suited him to strive for effect. According to his version, Podoloff had incited his fellow-peasants to march at once to Alexandrovsk and attack his excellency in the palace. The line of march had already been formed with the arch agitator, Podoloff, at the head.  \"I saw,\" said Basilivitch, waxing warm as his recital progressed, \"I saw that it would fare ill with your excellency if the progress of the mob was not arrested. With a handful of friends, therefore, I threw myself in front of the insurgents and commanded them to disband.\"  \"Well done,\" cried the Governor, upon whom every word made a profound impression. \"What did Podoloff do?\"  \"He would have come on alone, but I overpowered him and secured him in my barn, where he spent the night in imprecations against your excellency.\"  \"You did well, Basilivitch, and I shall not forget you. But who were Podoloff's accomplices? You say a number of men supported him in his treasonable utterances.\"  \"Yes; there were fully a dozen of them,\" said Basilivitch, counting upon his fingers, and enumerating a number of poor innocents, whose only offence lay in the fact that Basilivitch owed them some private grudge. \"There were quite a number of Jews in the assembly,\" continued the innkeeper; \"and their presence seemed to cause a great deal of ill-feeling.\"  Now it happened that there was not a single Jew in the tavern on that memorable Sunday. The twelve Israelitish families of Togarog found sufficient relaxation and entertainment in their own circle, and did not in the least yearn after the boisterous and uncivil companionship of Russian _moujiks_. Alas! they knew but too well that taunts and insults would be their portion, if they but dared to show themselves at one of these public gatherings. Moreover, the Jews were in the midst of their Passover, a time during which the partaking of any refreshments not prepared according to their strict ritual is sternly interdicted.  Be that as it may, Basilivitch did not allow such simple facts to stand in his way. He had come with a very pretty and effective tale, and drew largely upon his imagination to make it dramatic.  \"Ah, the Jews again!\" hissed the Governor. \"Did they take an active part in the insurrection?\"  Basilivitch was forced to admit that they did not.  The Governor appeared disappointed.  \"Well, what matters it?\" he said. \"They have been a menace to us long enough. I doubt whether they have a legal right to live in this part of Russia. We must investigate the matter. In the meantime, we will make an example of them. Give me the names of those Hebrews that were present.\"  Basilivitch's powers of improvisation failed him. In vain he endeavored to remember the names of the Jews who would most likely have been implicated in such an affair, but the names had slipped his memory.  \"Your excellency,\" he stammered, \"I never could tax my memory with their outlandish names.\"  \"It is of no consequence,\" said the Governor. \"A Jew is a Jew. We will make an example of the entire tribe. And now, good Basilivitch, of what do the people complain?\"  \"It is a mere bagatelle, your excellency. They would like to imitate their betters and live a life of ease and luxury; as though a serf were created for anything but labor. They complain that they cannot lie upon a bed of roses. They want their taxes remitted and would like their children to be sent to school, to be brought up to detest honest work.\"  \"Preposterous!\" exclaimed the Governor. \"What else have they to complain of?\"  \"They say that, while they must toil from morning till night, the Jews do nothing but amass wealth; that they must provide men for the army, while the Jews remain at home.\"  \"Stop!\" cried the Governor in a fury. \"Is what they say concerning the Jews true?\"  \"It is, your excellency. They do not work in the fields, they have no trades, they simply buy and sell and make money.\"  The Governor paced the room in silence, an occasional vehement gesture alone giving evidence of the agitation or fear that was raging within him. Finally, he stopped and stood before the obsequious Basilivitch.  \"We will find a plan to humble the haughty race,\" he said. \"Return to Togarog and keep your eyes open. Make out a list of the Jews in the village, and find out exactly how many boys there are in each family, and what are their ages. We will remove the brats from their parents' influence and send them to the army, where they will soon become loyal soldiers and faithful Catholics. Bring me the names of the _moujiks_ who supported Podoloff in his rebellion. I shall send them to Siberia to reflect on the uncertainty of human aspirations. Now, go! Here is a rouble for you. Should any new symptoms of revolt show themselves, send me word at once.\"  Scarcely had the door closed upon Basilivitch, before the Governor rang for his Secretary.  \"Send two officers to Togarog at once,\" he commanded. \"It appears my good serfs are becoming unruly, and would like a taste of freedom. Let the officers disguise themselves as peasants, and carefully observe every action of Podoloff and his friends. Let our faithful Basilivitch also be watched. I have my suspicions concerning that fellow. He is too ready with his information.\"  The Secretary left the room to fulfil the Governor's instructions, while Basilivitch remounted his horse and returned to his _kretschma_, to serve, with smiling countenance and friendly mien, the men whom he had devoted to irretrievable ruin.     CHAPTER III.  A FAMILY IN ISRAEL.   In a remote portion of Togarog, and separated from the main village by a number of wretched lanes, lay the Jewish quarter. A decided improvement in the general condition of the houses which formed this suburb was plainly visible to the casual observer. The houses were, if possible, more unpretentious than those of the serfs, yet there was an air of home-like comfort about them, an impression of neatness and cleanliness prevailed, which one would seek for in vain among the semi-barbarous peasants of Southern Russia. To the inhabitants of these poor huts, home was everything. The ordinary occupations, the primitive diversions of the serfs, were forbidden them. Shunned and decried by their gentile neighbors, the Jews meekly withdrew into the seclusion of their dwellings, and allowed the wicked world to wag. Their \"home\" was synonymous with their happiness, with their existence.  The shadows of evening were falling upon the quiet village. Above, the stars were beginning to twinkle in the calmness of an April sky, and brighter and brighter shone the candles in the houses of the Jews, inviting the wayfarer to the cheer of a hospitable board.  It is the Jewish Sabbath eve, the divine day of rest. The hardships and worry of daily toil are succeeded by a peaceful and joyous repose. The trials and humiliations of a week of care are followed by a day of peace and security.  The poor, despised Hebrew, who, during the past week, has been hunted and persecuted, bound by the chain of intolerance and scourged by the whip of fanaticism; who, in fair weather and foul, has wandered from place to place with his pack, stinting, starving himself, that he may provide bread for his wife and little ones, has returned for the Sabbath eve, to find, in the presence and in the smiles of his dear ones, an ample compensation for the care and anxiety he has been compelled to endure.  At the end of the street, and not far from the last house in the settlement, stands the House of Prayer. Thither the population of the Jewish quarter wends its way. Men arrayed in their best attire, and followed by troops of children, who from earliest infancy have been taught to acknowledge the efficacy of prayer, enter the synagogue.  It is a poor, modest-looking enclosure.  A number of tallow candles illumine its recesses. The _oron-hakodesh_, or ark containing the holy Pentateuch, a shabbily-covered pulpit, or _almemor_, and a few rough praying-desks for the men, are all that relieve the emptiness of the room. Around one side there runs a gallery, in which the women sit during divine service. In spite of its humble plainness, the place beams with cheerfulness; it bears the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20756"],["title","Rabbi and Priest: A Story (#3)"],["body","of holiness. Gradually the benches fill. All of the men, and many of the boys who form the population of the quarter, are present.  Reb Mordecai Winenki, the reader, begins the service. Prayers of sincere gratitude are sent on high. The worshippers greet the Sabbath as a lover greets his long-awaited bride--with joy, with smiles, with loving fervor. The service is at an end and the happy participants return to their homes.  Beautiful is the legend of the Sabbath eve.  When a man leaves the synagogue for his home, an Angel of Good and an Angel of Evil accompany him. If he finds the table spread in his house, the Sabbath lamps lighted, and his wife and children in festive attire, ready to bless the holy day of rest, then the good Angel says:  \"May the next Sabbath and all thy Sabbaths be like this. Peace unto this dwelling!\"  And the Angel of Evil is forced to say, \"Amen.\"  No one, indeed, would, before entering one of these poor, unpainted huts expect to find the cheerful and brilliant interior that greets his eyes. Let us enter one of the houses, that of Reb Mordecai Winenki.  The table is covered with a snow-white cloth. The utensils are clean and bright. The board is spread with tempting viands. An antique brass lamp, polished like a mirror, hangs from the ceiling, and the flame from its six arms sheds a soft light upon the table beneath. A number of silver candlesticks among the dishes add to the illumination.  On this evening, Mordecai returned from the synagogue with his son Mendel, a lad of thirteen, and his brother-in-law, Hirsch Bensef, a resident of Kief. Mordecai was a thin, pale-faced, brown-bearded man of forty or thereabouts, with shoulders stooping as though under a weight of care; perhaps, though, it was from the sedentary life he led, teaching unruly children the elements of Hebrew and religion. He had resided in Togarog for fourteen years, ever since he had married Leah, the daughter of Reb Bensef of Kief. His wife's brother was a man of different stamp. He was a few years younger than Mordecai. His step was firm, his head erect, his beard jet black, and his intellect, though not above the superstitious fancies of his time and race, was, for all ordinary transactions, especially those of trade, eminently clear and powerful. He was, as we shall see, one of the wealthiest Jewish merchants in Kief, and therefore quite a power in the community of that place.  Leah met the men at the door.  \"Good _Shabbes_, my dear husband; good _Shabbes_, brother,\" said the woman, cheerfully, her matronly face all aglow with pride and pleasure. \"You must be famished from your long trip, brother.\"  \"Yes, I am very hungry. I have tasted nothing since I left Kharkov, at five o'clock this morning.\"  \"How kind of you to come all that distance to our boy's _bar-mitzvah!_ He can never be sufficiently grateful.\"  \"He is my god-child,\" said the man, affectionately stroking his nephew's head. \"I take great pride in him. It has pleased the Lord to deny me children, and the deprivation is hard to bear. Sister, let me take Mendel with me. I am rich and can give him all he can desire. He shall study Talmud and become a great and famous rabbi, of whom all the world will one day speak in praise. You have still another boy, while my home is dreary for want of a child's presence. What say you?\"  But the mother had, long before the conclusion of this appeal, clasped the boy to her bosom, while the tears of love forced themselves through her lashes at the bare suggestion of parting from her first-born.  \"God forbid,\" she cried, \"that he should ever leave me; my precious boy.\" And she embraced him again and again.  Meanwhile, the husband had crossed the room to where a little fellow, scarcely six years of age, lay upon a sofa.  \"Well, Jacob, my boy; how do you feel?\" he asked, gently.  \"A little better, father,\" murmured the child. \"My arm and ear still pain me, but not so much as yesterday.\"  The boy sat up and attempted to smile, but sank back with a groan.  \"Poor child, poor child,\" said the father, soothingly, \"Have patience. In a few days you will be about again.\"  \"Is uncle here? I want to see uncle,\" cried the boy.  Hirsch Bensef obeyed the call, and, going to the sufferer, kissed his burning brow.  \"Why, Jacob; how is this?\" he said. \"I did not know that you were sick. What is the trouble, my lad?\" The child turned his face to the wall and shuddered.  Reb Mordecai shook his head mournfully, while a tear he sought to repress ran down his furrowed cheek.  \"It is the old story,\" he said. \"Prejudice and fanaticism, hatred and ignorance.\"  And while the Sabbath meal waited, the father told his tale in a simple, unaffected manner, and the uncle listened with clenched hands and threatening glances.  The day following the events in the _kretschma_, little Jacob had wandered, in company with some Christian playmates, through the village, and seeing the door of a barn wide open, his childish curiosity got the better of his discretion, and he peeped in. A brindled cow, with a pretty calf scarcely three days old, attracted his attention, and for some minutes he gazed upon the pair in silent ecstasy. Then, knowing that he was on forbidden ground, he retraced his steps and endeavored to reach the lane where he had left his companions. The master of the farm, however, having witnessed the intrusion from a neighboring window, did not lose the opportunity to vent his anger against the whole tribe of inquisitive Jews. On the following day the cow ran dry. In vain did the calf seek nourishment at the maternal breast; there was nothing to satisfy its cravings.  The farmer, slow as he was in matters of general importance, was far from slow in tracing the melancholy occurrence to its supposed source.  \"That accursed Jew has bewitched my cow,\" was his first thought, and his second was to find the author of the deed and mete out punishment to him.  Throughout the whole of Russia, and even in parts of civilized Germany, Jews are accused of all manner of sorcery. The _Cabala_ is the principal religious authority of the lower classes among the Russian Jews, and this may perhaps inspire such a preposterous notion. The Jews, themselves, frequently believe that some one of their own number is in possession of supernatural secrets which give him wonderful and awful powers. Many were the tortures which these poor people were doomed to endure for their supposed influence over nature's laws.  It was an easy matter to find little Jacob. His hours at the _cheder_ (school) were over. He was sure to be playing upon the streets, and his capture was quickly effected. Seizing the innocent little fellow by the arm, the irate peasant lifted him off his feet, and dragged him by sheer force into the barn, where he confronted the malefactor with his victim.  \"So, you thought you could bewitch my cow,\" he hissed. \"But I saw you, Jew, and, by our holy Czar, I swear that, unless you repair the damage, I shall feed your carcass to the dogs.\"  Poor Jacob was too terrified to understand of what crime he had been accused. He looked piteously at his tormentor, and burst into tears.  \"Well?\" cried the peasant, impatiently; \"will you take off the spell, or shall I call my dog?\"  The child, knowing that such threats were not made in vain, endeavored to plead his innocence, but the bellowing of the hungry calf outweighed the sobbing of the boy, and with an angry oath Jacob was struck to the ground, and a ferocious bull-dog, but little more brutal than his master, was set upon the helpless little fellow.  \"Please, Mr. Farmer, don't kill me,\" he pleaded, groaning in pain.  \"Will you cure my cow?\" demanded the peasant.  \"I'll try to; I'll do my best,\" sobbed the boy, whose pain made him diplomatic at last.  The dog was called off, and the child, after promising to restore the cow to her former condition, was turned out into the lane, where his mother found him an hour later, unconscious, his body lacerated, one arm broken, and a portion of his right ear torn off.  When Reb Mordecai concluded his sad narration, all about him were in tears.  \"Just God!\" exclaimed the uncle; \"hast Thou indeed deserted Thy people, that Thou canst allow such indignities? How long, O Lord! must we endure these torments?\"  \"Nay, brother,\" sobbed the poor mother, while she caressed her ailing boy; \"what God does is for the best. It is not for us to peer into his inscrutable actions. But come, Mordecai, banish your sorrows. This is _Shabbes_, a day of joy and peace. Come, the table is spread.\"  Father and mother placed their hands upon the heads of their children, and pronounced the solemn blessing:--\"May God let you become like Ephraim and Manasseh!\" and the family took their places at the table.  Then Mordecai made _kiddush_, which consisted in blessing the wine, without which no Jewish Sabbath is complete, and having pronounced _motzi_, a similar prayer over the bread, he dipped the latter in salt, and passed a small piece to each of the participants. It is a ceremony which no pious Jew ever neglects.  In spite of the recent affliction, the meal was a merry one. The poorest Israelite will deny himself even the necessaries of life during the six working-days, that he may live well on the Sabbath. Reb Mordecai was a poor man. He had a small income, derived from teaching the Talmud to the children in the vicinity, from transcribing the holy scrolls, and from sundry bits of work for which he was fitted by his intellectual attainments. He was the most influential Jew in the settlement and not even the fanatical serfs of the village could find a complaint to make against his character or person.  The theme of conversation was naturally the family festival, which would take place upon the morrow. Mendel having attained his thirteenth year and acquired due proficiency in the difficult studies of the Jewish law, would become _bar-mitzvah_; in other words, he would take upon himself the responsibility of a man"]]]
